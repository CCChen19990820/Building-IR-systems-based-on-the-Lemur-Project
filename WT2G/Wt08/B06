<p>Be a responsible consumer and buy sustainable Rainforest products.  Sustainability is when the functions and processes of an ecosystem can be maintained (or sustained) while the needs of the present are met without compromising the needs of future gen
erations. Our present economic model ignores environmental degradation when assessing profits.  For an economy whose growth and health is defined by the intensive exploitation of natural resources, principles of sustainability must become integrated if w
e are to survive. <p>

As we promote products like those listed below, be aware that there is a limited amount which can be consumed.  The concept of sustainability transcends the traditional rules of "supply and demand" as each ecosystem determines the ceiling of its producti
vity.  Overconsumption is a driving force behind deforestation.  The primary question for us must be, not which herbal supplement, ice cream, or candy should I buy, but, do I need to buy this? <p>

There are many factors that must be taken into consideration.  The first step is to support the land and resource rights and economies of indigenous peoples.  These knowledgeable people have inhabited rainforests for millenia without destroying them.  We
 need them to teach us how to use the forests without damaging them.  There are medicines, foods and other unknown treasures that can be harvested without jeopardizing the future. Preserving indigenous cultures is key to saving the rainforest.  Those fro
m developed countries have much to learn from indigenous peoples in terms of our relationship with the Earth.  By respecting and allowing them to lead the way towards a true, stable utilization of this bountiful resource, if they choose to utilize it in 
any commercial way at all, we have the potential of achieving true sustainability. <p>

Being a responsible consumer is hard work.  How can you  tell if a product has been sustainably harvested?   It is difficult.  Ask questions.  Find out where your purchases really come from, where are your dollars really going? Who is benefitting from th
e profit? Is any of the profit returned to the indigenous people supplying rainforest products or raw materials?  How much? Who receives the funds there?  As a consumer, you are directly affecting the economy and ecology of the globe. You do have power -
 it's called purchasing power!  Use it!<br>

<blockquote>
The Raintree Group, Inc. is sponsoring several human studies in 1996 to determine the applications and effectiveness of different Amazon and Rainforest plants.  Many of the studies will be conducted by Dr. Donna Schwontkowski.<P>

Dr. Schwontkowski has a doctorate degree in Chiropractic Medicine and a Master's Degree in Nutrition. She has been researching and using rainforest herbs in her chiropractic practice since 1991.<BR> More information on her background can be found in the  <A HREF="resume.htm">Biography Section</A> and a series of three articles she authored on rainforest herbs that were published in the <I>Healthy & Natural Journal</I> can be seen in the <A HREF="articles.htm">Article Section.</A> <P>

There are two human studies available for immediate enrollment.  If you are interested in participating in either study, you may sign up to do so in this section of the website.
Additional human studies will be announced in this section and will include Study descriptions and participation guidelines as well as enrollment information.<P>
The Impotency Study enrolling now is an investigation to determine if two natural herbal extracts are useful in reducing impotency.  To learn more about the study and the requirements to participate, hyperlink to the <A HREF=#one> Impotency Program Guidelines</A>.<P>

The Virility Study, also enrolling now,  is an investigation to determine if these two natural herbal extracts are useful in increasing virility and libido in healthy males.   To learn more about the study and the requirements to participate, hyperlink to the <A HREF=#two> Virility Program Guidelines</A>.<P>

There is no financial compensation to participate in either study.  There are no costs associated with participation in the study, other than long distance telephone calls to check in on a scheduled  basis. Required written reports can be submitted by email to avoid postage. The Rainforest  herbal extracts used in the study will be supplied to participants free of charge by The Raintree Group, Inc. of Austin, Texas.  and/or Rainforest Bio-Energetics, of Jupiter, Florida. After completion of  the study, a one to three month supply of the herbal extracts used in the studies will be given free  to all participants which have successfully completed the program. 

The names and identify of all study participants will be kept confidential. The results of these studies will be provided in the <A HREF="clinic1.htm">Clinical Trials Section</A><P>

Please read the Study Requirements to determine if you qualify before enrolling.  To enroll in either study from this page, you can do so one of two ways:<P> 

You can print out the <A HREF="question.htm">Health Questionnaire Form and either the Impotency or Virility Questionnaire now</A>, and fill out both completely. Then mail the completed forms by regular mail directly to Dr. Schwontkowski at the address shown on the top of the form.<P>   

Or you may select this link to the <a href="forms/index.html">On-Line Form</a>.  When you select this link, you can fill out a form now on your computer and the information will be automatically e-mailed to us.<p>

<center><font size=6><b><a name="one"> IMPOTENCY STUDY</a></b></font></center>

<H3>BACKGROUND:</H3>
Previous studies and trials indicate that some herbs may have positive beneficial effects on impotency.  Specifically, yohimbe, and an alkaloid extraction of yohimbe called yohimbine,  has been used by the medical profession for several years. However, yohimbe is not without side effects.  Some herbs from the Amazon Rainforest are reported to work faster than herbs like yohimbe.  Most recently, Dr. Jacques Waynberg, at the Institute of Sexology in Paris, France, has demonstrated the Amazon herb, Muira puama to be effective in many cases of impotency.  To see a copy of Dr. Waynberg's two clinical trials on Muira puama, go the <A HREF="clinic1.htm"> Clinical Report</A>  section.  To learn more about this herb, go to the <A HREF="plants9.htm#MARA">Plant Description</A> section on Muira puama.<P>

It is the goal of this investigation to determine if two natural products are useful in reducing impotency. A concentrated extract of Muira puama will be provided to one-half of the participants and the other half will receive an herbal extract called Male Plus which contains Muira puama and three other concentrated herbs. To learn more about Male Plus, please go to the  Raintree <A HREF="rtmprod.htm#male">Product Section </A>. <P> The Amazon herbal extracts used in the study will be supplied by Rainforest Bio-Energetics, of Jupiter, Florida, and/or The Raintree Group, Inc. of Austin, Texas.  The herbs have been used for centuries by the tribes in the Rainforests. The herb, Muira puama, used in this study,  has been used by thousands of Americans over the past 4 years with very few side-effects noted.  The other herbs used in the Male Plus formula have a long history of use as aphrodisiacs and male tonics and/or are ethnic herbs used to treat impotency.<P>

This study will be conducted by Dr. Donna Schwontkowski, D.C., M.S. Nutrition.  Dr. Schwontkowski has had much experience in this area and is conducting other research studies on Amazon herbs. <P>

<H3>ABOUT THE STUDY:</H3>
The Study is enrolling presently and will be limited to 100 participants.  <H4>To qualify to participate in the study, you must :</H4>
<OL>
<LI>Be a male between and 21 to 65 years of age.
<LI>Currently have a steady sexual partner.
<LI>Be able to communicate freely and articulate about sexual matters.
<LI>Have a good memory and ability to write legibly.

<UL>
<LI>Age 
<LI>Chemical causes (result of current medications)
<LI>Organic causes
<LI>Psychological disorders
</UL>
<LI>Reside in the continental United States.
</OL>

The length of time you must commit to participate in the study will depend on the individual's cause(s) of impotency and will range from 1 to 3 months. During the first two weeks you  will record  baseline data only.  At the end of two weeks, the Amazon herbs will be provided free of charge and new data will be recorded as the herbal extracts are taken. There are no costs associated with participation in the study, other than long distance telephone calls to check in on a weekly basis.  At the successful completion of the study, you will be given an additional two month supply of your choice of either herbal extract used in this study.<P> 
<H4>To participate, you will be required the following:</H4>
<OL>
<LI>Supply medical records from your primary physician if requested.
<LI>Check in by telephone once weekly with Dr. Schwontkowski, or as often as necessary during the study.
<LI>Keep all necessary records provided on symptoms during the study and take the
herbal products as instructed during the study.
<LI>Agree not to change your diet during the study.
<LI>Contact Dr. Schwontkowski if any unusual symptoms occur.
</OL>

If you have any questions concerning participating in the Impotency Study, please email  <A HREF="mailto:raintree@bga.com">The Raintree Group</A>.  All questions will be forwarded to Dr. Schwontkowski and a response will be emailed back to you within a few days.  All information, names and identity of the participants will be kept confidential. <P>

<p>
This is another section of the Raintree website that will continuously be under construction as new clinical trials are made accessible in this section. Our goal is to make full clinical trials accessible here rather than just abstracts.  We are currently negotiating with various authors and publishers to gain permission to re-publish almost 100 clinical trials on Rainforest plants in this section.  Please keep checking back as this section continues to grow.<P>  

We are pleased to make available the latest trial published by Dr. Jacques Waynberg at the Institute of Sexology in Paris, France utilizing "Testor-Plus" with 100 men with impotence and/or decreased libido. This trial has been translated from French to English.  Testor-Plus is a liquid extract of Muira Puama (Ptychopetalum olacoides).  Dr. Waynberg's first trial with 262 men, referred to in several publications here in the US, is still under translation and will be posted here soon.<P>

<h4>We would like to thank you <br>for your interest in the Raintree Group of Companies.</h4></center>
<blockquote>

Raintree specializes in herbal products from the Amazon Rainforest with over 50 rainforest plants currently under research. A small but highly ethical line of Rainforest products under the Raintree Nutrition label is available to retailers for wholesale
purchase from our subsidiary company, <a href= "whole.htm">Raintree Marketing, Inc.</a><p>

Currently,  26 rainforest plants are available from The Raintree Group Inc. in whole plants, dry extracts, and/or liquid extracts including many of the Rainforest plants featured in the <a href="plist.htm">Plant Section.</a> of this web site.  Blended herbal formulas are also available in bulk.  All herbal products sold by the Raintree group of companies are researched and documented thoroughly prior to marketing and are ecologically harvested and backed by independent  assays.  These assays not only provide the standard microbial tests, but include state-of-the-art assays that identify the active constituents found in each plant source (alkaloids, terpenes, phytosterols, etc.). These important standards ensure ethical products, which is one of the cornerstones of our corporate mission and an important part of Raintree's quality assurance and good manufacturing process.<p>
<h3>The results. . . </h3>

<blockquote>
<li>Raintree, in concert with industry experts, developed the first methods in the U.S. to isolate and quantitatively measure through independent assays,  the  active oxindole alkaloids in the new and important Peruvian herb, Cat's Claw (Uncaria tomentosa).<p>

<li>Utilizing tested and proven methods of plant selection, harvesting, shipping and manufacturing, the Cat's Claw  available from Raintree with an alkaloid content of 1.55% is much higher than other tested products in the market, assayed independently at between .13% to .9%. <p>

<li>New extraction methods were developed  and utilized in Raintree's Cat's Claw liquid extract. Utilizing  organic apple vinegar and wildcrafted honey produces a Raintree product with an alkaloid content 3-5 times higher than other  water or alcohol based liquid extracts currently available in the marketplace. A Raintree exclusive.<p>

<li>Raintree's Muira puama (Ptychopetalum olacoides) liquid extract has 2-3 times the active constituents of other available Muira puama extracts. <p>

<li>Raintree's new Amazon formula "Male Plus" for men,  containing Muira puama and three other synergistically supportive extracts,  is now being utilized by medical doctors in treating cases of impotency, and as  a replacement for  the only available FDA approved drug, yohimbine hydrochloride. Also a Raintree exclusive.<p>
</ul>

Raintree's research and documentation procedures are an integral part of our commitment to consumer education, knowledge and truth in the marketplace.  In this endeavor, as a  market leader in knowledge and information on  Cat's Claw, Raintree published "Cat's Claw, A Documentation." It is referred to as the most up-to-date compilation of worldwide research, clinical and medical studies and printed articles available on this important product. In an October, 1995 Whole Foods magazine article, Cat's  Claw was listed as the 11th top selling herbal supplement in the U.S., garnering 2.9% of all herbal supplement sales. In the Whole Foods survey however,  it was shown as the Number 1 herbal supplement  in "Up-and-coming herbs for 1996,"  where they reported: "Based on this tabulation, we discovered that cat's claw was by all accounts the most promising herb currently on the market. Standing alone at the head of the pack, it garnered 23.2% of all possible points awarded, twice as much as its closest rival..."   We are pleased with any part we have played in increasing consumer and market awareness and attention to this valuable new medicinal plant.<p>

We hope you will think of The Raintree Group, Inc. as your Number One source for Rainforest products, plants, research and documentation.  If we don't currently carry a Rainforest product you are looking for, we'll be happy to use our extensive network to track it down for you.  Please review our partial list of available Rainforest plants and extracts following the first link below.  Due to sustainable harvesting practices used and harvesting periods affecting product availability and pricing, only a partial list is provided.  Please contact us for a full list with current pricing which is updated monthly.
<p>
The Raintree Group also provides contract formulation services and proprietary Rainforest Herbal Formulas to marketing companies and companies which market nutritional products under their own label.  Please follow the link below to learn more about Raintree's contract services.

Many of these methods are proprietary and exclusive  Raintree.  Several liquid extract formulas are available, many without alcohol , however, some plants require the use of alcohol to yield the best results and efficacy in finished product and Raintree is committed to provide only the highest quality product which provides noticeable benefits<p>

Raintree Marketing, Inc. and The Raintree Group, Inc.  are  recognized industry experts on this dynamic new Peruvian herb, called Cat's Claw or Una de Gato.  After a full year of worldwide research, Raintree has published a book on Cat's Claw called <a href=#ccbook>"Cat's Claw, A Documentation"</a> to help educate consumers about this important new Rainforest resource.  Some of the active ingredients documented, researched, and proven effective in Cat's Claw are 6 oxindole alkaloids.  These alkaloids have been researched and documented world-wide to have the following properties: immune stimulating, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic (anti-tumor), and anti-viral.  Only after completing this in-depth product research, Raintree selected a Peruvian source of Cat's Claw to be sold under the Raintree Nutrition label.  Then, in concert with this supplier, Raintree developed the new assaying technology required to test Cat's Claw for quality and efficacy by quantitatively assaying samples for alkaloid content. We wanted to assure our customers of the quality of our product AND substantiate it - so this type of validation was vital to us. For more information on comparing Cat's Claw products, go to the <a href="ccfaq.htm">Cat's Claw FAQ</a> for imporatnt information.<p><p>

All Cat's Claw sold by Raintree Nutrition has been ecologically harvested in Peru, insuring its continued growth and availability. It's species is certified by the Ministry of Health in Peru prior to exportation. Due to the care and methods employed in harvesting and shipping, Raintree's Cat's Claw is NEVER fumigated or irradiated.  Most other available Cat's Claw products have either been fumigated or irradiated. Only the alkaloid-rich inner bark of the Cat's Claw vine is dried, ground and used to manufacture Raintree's Cat's Claw products.  Recently, we've seen that some manufacturers are grinding the entire vine, thereby diluting the alkaloid content and reducing efficacy.  For more information on comparing Cat's Claw products, go to the <a href="ccfaq.htm">Cat's Claw FAQ</a>.

<p><b> Based on independent assays, Raintree's Cat's Claw capsules has the highest alkaloid content of  any standard inner bark capsules available.  Total alkaloid content of tested samples from other available products range from .13% to 1.05%. This represents a huge difference in quality and efficacy. Because of our commitment for quality,  Raintree's alkaloid content has always assayed in a range of 1.32% to  1.58%. <p>

Our current supply of Cat's Claw capsules has an alkaloid content of 1.55% which is the highest available. Please see a copy of an <a href="assay1.htm"> independent assay </a>from Industrial Labs on Raintree's available Cat's Claw capsules for verification.</b><p>

<b>IMPORTANT!</b><br>
Several companies are selling Cat's Claw root supposedly under a special Peruvian permit.  Marketers selling cat's claw root refer to European research that was performed using the "root" and advertises that the root is better based on this research or has higher alkaloids than inner bark.  If you actually read the research they cite, it was conducted NOT on the whole ground root that these marketers sell, but only on the BARK of the root. The percentage of root bark to whole root in these root supplements is quite small, therefore alkaloid contents are not much different between whole root products and quality inner bark products.  These product's alkaloid contents are NO HIGHER than Raintree's Cat's Claw inner bark. <br>There is no reason to harvest the root and endanger the supply of this Rainforest plant! <br> PLEASE, do not purchase Cat's Claw root, and help ensure the continued ecological supply of this important Rainforest resource. For more information on alkaloid contents of root in comparison to bark, go to the <a href="ccfaq.htm">Cat's Claw FAQ</a>. <p>

The second Cat's Claw product available from Raintree is the result of months of research on the alkaloids of Cat's Claw and different extraction methods to extract the alkaloids from the bark. It utilizes state-of-the-art technology and is truly unique, providing the first <b>100% all-natural, <b>non-alcoholic</b>, high alkaloid concentrated extract</b> of  Cat's Claw. The finest grade raw honey and organic apple vinegar is used in a cold process which actually reacts to form a separate complex with a highly bioavailable alkaloid content.<p>
Using  the same high quality Cat's Claw inner bark, the alkaloids are extracted and stabilized by repeated maceration with premium organic apple vinegar and then mixed with wildcrafted organic honey for taste, stabilization and even it's own added health benefits.  The difference between raw and processed honey is like the difference between whole wheat and white bread. Heat treatment reduces the honey to a simple syrup as opposed to the enzyme-rich food raw honey is. Organic apple vinegar  provides the perfect extraction ingredient for Cat's Claw because it releases more alkaloids from the tannins in the bark which make them more active and bioavailable than alcohol or water extracts. The apple vinegar  also provides it's own active enzymes and phytonutrients for an even more synergistic effect. This process takes approximately three weeks to produce, and is more expensive and time consuming than standard water or alcohol extracts. <br><b> But the results.... </b><br>Raintree's liquid extract has 3-4 times more  alkaloids than  any other alcohol or water/glycerin Cat's Claw extract sold, including GAIA and HerbPharm. Raintree's concentrated Cat's Claw extract delivers <b>9.75 milligrams of pure oxindole alkaloids in every dropper-full </b>in a extracted and bioavailable form for maximum absorption and benefit.  Please read important information in the <a href="ccfaq.htm">Cat's Claw FAQ</a> concerning the difference of bioavailability in Cat's Claw extract products.<p>

Rigorous testing on this concentrate  has found it to be highly stable, with a long shelf-life without crystallization. During this testing, the concentrate  was inoculated with 30 known spoilage organisms and bacteria. After 48 hours of incubation at 95 degrees F, all organisms had died.<p>

This high quality extract is sold in two ounce amber glass bottles with glass eye-dropper tops. Each 2 ounce bottle has approximately 28-30 thirty-drop dosages. Look for this high quality product under the Raintree Nutrition label in your local health food store. If you can't find it there, order it directly from Raintree Marketing.<br><p>

Male Plus was developed exclusively for men and contains four powerful herbs from the Amazon Rainforest that have been used for centuries as male aphrodisiacs, male tonics, and supportive of male sexual organs and systems.  The key ingredient of this dynamic new formula is a highly concentrated extract of Muira puama.  Recent clinical research has shown an herbal extract of Muira puama  to be highly effective in over 64% of 362 men studied in increasing libido and in successfully treating organic- and psychogenic-related impotency.  Compared to a clinically established effectiveness rate of only 14% to 34% for yohimbine, the only available drug prescribed for impotency and lack of sexual desire, these are significant and important new findings. <p>
   The remaining ingredients in Male Plus work synergistically with Muira puama, calming nervous tension and stress, supporting male hormones, acting as tonics to the prostrate and the male endocrine system, as well as supporting  sexual desire and libido.<p>
Exclusive to Raintree, this herbal formula combines <a href="plants9.htm#MARA">Muira puama</a> with <a href="plants3.htm#CATUABA">Catuaba</a>, <a href="plants15.htm#SARSAPARILLA">Sarsaparilla</a>,

<p><b><font size=+2>T</font>he Amazon Rainforest, the world's greatest natural resource,  is the most powerful and bio-actively diverse natural phenomenon on the planet. Since the dawn of man this foreboding  and sometimes frightening frontier has been the source of countless intoxicating  legends, myths and mysteries.  Both Western and European cultures have been drawn to its door in the hopes of finding riches beyond comprehension and artifacts from civilizations that have long since expired with the passage of time. Indigenous inhabitants of the Rainforest often bore the brunt of marauding explorers and conquistadors. Intoxicated by dreams and fantasies of wealth and endless youth, they left behind decimated cultures in their ravenous wake. Although the fabled Fountain of Youth was never  discovered many treasures in gold and gems were spirited away by the more successful invaders of the day.  Little did they know that the true wealth of this priceless resource remained. . . the untold wealth of the indigenous plants. Rich in beneficial nutrients, phytochemicals and active constituents,  the Rainforest Indians and Indigenous People have used them for centuries for  their survival, health and well-being.

<p>Thousands of years ago, the native peoples of the Rainforest had developed great centers of learning, including medical schools that taught the role of medicinal plants in healthcare. Given the Age, archaeologists and historians alike have long since documented the high level of sophistication in their knowledge and teachings. With the natural decline of these civilizations, sometimes encouraged by the invaders of the day, many cultural practices, including the teaching of this information declined or were labeled blasphemous and banned entirely by the inquisition that remained.<p>

Among teachings destroyed were the great writings which contained this wealth of knowledge about the uses of plants in medicine and health care. In addition,  the intergenerational transmission of this information shifted from a written to an oral tradition. This has unfortunately led to the realization that,  as a result of the refining of this information over the generations,  this valuable knowledge is probably in greater danger of extinction than the plants themselves. Sadly, modern times have led to the further loss of a great deal of information about plant use. This is a direct byproduct of the Western and European techno-pharmaceutical complexes which have developed and maintained a synthetic-chemical model for the treatment of illness and disease.  Ironically many of the patented chemical pharmaceutical compounds available and marketed today are in fact based on or derived from the active ingredients found naturally occurring in plant sources found in the Rainforest. <p>

<img src="rain4a.jpg" alt="Rainforest pic 2" width=239 height=165 align=right><p>

Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by shamans, healers and the indigenous people of the Rainforest Tribes. So alluring are the mysteries of indigenous medical knowledge that over 100 pharmaceutical companies and even the US government  are currently funding projects studying the  indigenous plant knowledge. This has fueled a ground swell of demand for ethnobotanists from around the world.  Their work in the Rainforest has resulted in the rediscovery of this long thought lost information. It is the invaluable work of the ethnobotanist to chronicle this information, to document the remains of what once existed, and make it freely available for all to benefit, including future generations.<p>

Extracting these secrets from the jungles is no easy task and sadly, this state of affairs may not last long enough into the future for man to unlock all their secrets. Tragically,  Rainforests once covered  14% of the earth's land surface; now they cover a mere 6% and experts estimate that the last remaining rainforests could be consumed in less than 40 years. Experts agree that by  leaving the Rainforests intact and harvesting it's wealth of  nuts, fruits, oil-producing plants, and medicinal plants, the Rainforest has more economic value than if they were cut down to make grazing land for cattle as so much of it is being lost to.<p> 

<img src="rain5a.jpg" alt="Rainforest pic 3" width=240 height=164 align=right><p>

The Raintree Group of companies advocates the preservation of the Rainforests by promoting the use of sustainable and renewable botanical sources like these important medicinal plants and herbal products found on the following pages. Raintree has assured that all Rainforest products featured here have been ecologically harvested using the assistance of  the Indigenous People, to support their local economy to ensure the plant regeneration for future use.  Please do not support Rainforest products that are not provided in this manner.  In addition, a portion of the sales from the products featured are sequestered and donated to nonprofit  organizations and associations specifically administered for the ongoing study and preservation of the Rainforest and its valuable reserves.<p>

Raintree is proud to a part of this growing awareness and education of the Rainforest and its undeniably documented wealth of medicinal herbs and plants. By creating a market and income from Rainforest herbs and plants, we are enjoined by many others to provide a morally and ecologically balanced relationship that is not only supportive of  the monetary needs of the indigenous peoples of the Rainforest but also the rest of the world's needs for the life supportive ingredient rich botanicals found in this marvel of nature. We hope that you will join us in our endeavors.<p>

Raintree has been privileged to become  associated with the top professionals in the field of Ethnobotany from around the world, and through them we have come to know individuals from the traditional communities of the Rainforest.  We all share a common thread in this relationship, and that is  the preservation of the Rainforest, and the sustaining and supporting of  present and future research and documentation of the medicinal benefits of  Rainforest plants.  This Web page is an extensive compilation of specific information on these plants; their history of use, benefits and clinical documentation.  <p></b>

This high alkaloid liquid concentrate is the result of months of research on the alkaloids of Cat's Claw and different extraction methods to extract the alkaloids from the bark. It utilizes state-of-the-art technology and is truly unique, providing the first <b>100% all-natural, <b>non-alcoholic</b>, high alkaloid concentrated extract</b> of  Cat's Claw. The finest grade raw honey and organic apple vinegar is used in a cold process which actually reacts to form a separate complex with a highly bioavailable alkaloid content.<p>

Using  the same high quality Cat's Claw inner bark, the alkaloids are extracted and stabilized by repeated maceration with premium organic apple vinegar and then mixed with wildcrafted organic honey for taste, stabilization and even it's own added health benefits.  The difference between raw and processed honey is like the difference between whole wheat and white bread. Heat treatment reduces the honey to a simple syrup as opposed to the enzyme-rich food raw honey is. Organic apple vinegar  provides the perfect extraction ingredient for Cat's Claw because it releases more alkaloids from the tannins in the bark which make them more active and bioavailable than alcohol or water extracts. The apple vinegar  also provides it's own active enzymes and phytonutrients for an even more synergistic effect. This process takes approximately three weeks to produce, and is more expensive and time consuming than standard water or alcohol extracts. To learn more about different extracts and some important information, go to the <a href="cc_faq.htm">Cat's Claw FAQ</a>.

<p><b> But the results.... </b><br>Raintree's liquid extract has 3-4 times more  alkaloids than  any other alcohol or water/glycerin Cat's Claw extract sold, including GAIA and HerbPharm.
Raintree's concentrated Cat's Claw extract delivers <b>9.75 milligrams of pure oxindole alkaloids in every dropper-full </b>in a extracted and bioavailable form for maximum absorption and benefit.

<p>Rigorous testing on this concentrate  has found it to be highly stable, with a long shelf-life (3 years plus) without crystallization. During this testing, the concentrate  was inoculated with 30 known spoilage organisms and bacteria. After 48 hours of incubation at 95 degrees F, all organisms had died.

<p>This high quality extract is sold in two ounce amber glass bottles with glass eye-dropper tops. Each 2 ounce bottle has approximately 28-30 thirty-drop dosages.

<center><h1>Herbal Treasures from the Amazon
</h1></center>
<h4><i> by Dr. Donna Schwontkowski</i></h4>
<h3>Part 1:<br>
Blood-Sugar Regulating and
Immune-Enhancing Herbs</h3>

July 30, 1994<br>
<i><b>The following is the first in a three part series:</i></b><br>

Case History: Anne<br>
        Anne, a distraught 54-year-old woman, had just returned from an annual check-up that uncovered a fasting blood sugar level of 190 mg/dl (normal levels are 80-120 mg/dl).  Although she had no symptoms other than occasional fatigue, she was told that she
has a prediabetic condition; a condition which, if left unchecked for long periods of time, can result in diabetes mellitus.<p>
        Diabetes mellitus affects about 14 million Americans and is the fourth leading cause of death by disease in the United States.  Diabetes takes the lives of more than 150,000 people each year.  It is a major cause of heart disease, stroke and kidney dise
ase, and is the number one cause of new cases of blindness and amputations in the U.S.<p>
        Everyone knows that there is no cure for diabetes and that once told they have it, patients must learn to live with the disease.  The overall objectives of treatment are to prolong life and improve the quality of life as much as possible.  Treatment is
directed specifically toward: (1) relieving the symptoms; (2) improving the body's ability to metabolize glucose and correcting faulty metabolism; (3) preventing or correcting complications; and (4) assuring adequate nutrition.<p>
        Anne's doctor sent her home with advice to lose weight, exercise, and "hope that next month's blood sugar  levels will return to normal." The Midwestern winter, however, prevented her from long, regular outdoor walks-her only feasible method of exercise
.  She felt she needed additional help.<p>
Anne came to me with the hope that somewhere in the deepest jungles of the Amazon were plants that the natives had discovered to treat similar conditions.  She was willing to use these plants on a trial basis to prevent diabetes from becoming a reality.<
p>
        <b><center><h3>Help From the Amazon Rainforests</h3></center></b>
        My own research into the medicinal effects of Brazilian and Peruvian herbs had uncovered several plants with reported activities of lowering blood sugar levels, normalizing the frequency of urination, and eliminating glucose in the urine of diabetics.
Much of the research was ethnobotanical; however, several scientific studies showed the effectiveness of these herbs in cases of adult-onset diabetes in reducing blood sugar levels, sometimes up to 35%.  These herbs were true treasures for Anne.<p>
        Anne took a combination of the herbs<b> Pata de vaca, Pedra hume caa, Stevia</b> and <b>Cashew</b> plant daily in-between meals when her blood sugar levels needed regulation.<i> (See Table 1 for scientific names of these plants.) </i>The results were qu
ite exciting.  After one month, her blood sugar level fell to 140 mg/dl.  After two months, it was down to 110 mg/dl (within normal range), and it stayed there for her next annual checkup.  She hadn't lost any weight through dietary modification or exerc
ise.<p>

        <center><h3><b>Other Medicinal Effects Reported from Plants in the Amazon </b></h3></center>
             Plants with blood sugar-regulating activity are only one category of helpful herbs with medicinal effects from the Amazon.  Of the more than 200,000 plant species in the Amazon, many have been found to have antiviral, antifungal and antibacterial a
ctivity - activity which stimulates the body's immune system.<p>
        The most powerful immune-enhancing herb is <b>Una de gato</b>.  Research from 1970 through the present (by Klaus Keplinger and others in Austria, Germany, England, Hungary and Italy) has shown beneficial effects of<b> Una de gato</b> in the treatments f
or cancer, genital herpes, systemic candidiasis and AIDS.  Six alkaloids isolated from the plant root have been found to significantly enhance the ability of the white blood cells to attack, engulf and digest harmful micro-organisms or foreign matter, th
us assisting the process of phagocytosis in the body.<p>
        My own preliminary studies on the immune-enhancing properties of <b>Una de gato</b> have uncovered the following:
<ol>
<li>An ability to stop viral infections in the early stages (when an individual feels an infection starting and/or already has a fever, fatigue, muscle aches and sore throat).  One patient reported that his viral infection symptoms cleared within 8 hours
 after taking Una de gato.
<li>An ability to help patients who are chemically-sensitive, decreasing the fatigue which accompanies this problem and reducing the severity of symptoms.
<li>An ability to significantly enhance emotional stability, even in the midst of extreme stress from personal problems.  One patient commented, "I just can't get depressed anymore, no matter what happens.  It's this Amazon herb!"
<li>An ability to help the body fight infections better in AIDS patients.  One patient reported, "I ran out of the fungicide for the skin rash on my face and used a bacteriocidal agent until I could get a new prescription.  The bactericide didn't work an
d the rash started coming back.  I used Una de gato and after just three days, the rash cleared up on my face.  I feel that it's my own body working against the fungus as a result of the Una de gato."
<li>An ability to decrease the visible size of some skin, tumor or cyst growths within two weeks.
</ol><br>

Stevia  </td> <td><i>Stevia rebaudiana bertoni</i></td> </tr> <tr><td>
Cashew Plant</td> <td>  <i>Anacardium occidentale</i></td> </tr></table> </center><br><br>

        <b>Una de gato</b> also has anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties.  These properties explain its usefulness in the treatment of arthritis, bursitis, allergies and numerous bowel and intestinal disorders.  There have been several case
 histories cited in literature where Una de gato has been linked with the remission of intractable brain and other tumors and give relief to the side-effects of chemotherapy.<p>
        Although <b>Una de gato</b> is probably the most powerful immune system enhancer from the Amazon, there are other herbs that can make a significant difference in immune status.  When combined together, they can decrease the course of time that allergic
reactions and infections normally run.  They may clear up the sinus congestion which occurs with ragweed sensitivities.  Immune-system enhancing herbs that work well together include<b> Pau d'Arco, Espinheira Santa, Jatoba, Suma</b> and <b>Una de gato</b
>.<i> (See Table 2 for the scientific names of these herbs.)</i><p>

           <b>Pau d' Arco</b> is thought to eliminate toxins in the body and purify the blood, and it has anti-fungal properties.  In an original weight loss research study performed in Chicago in 1992, 1 found that women's chronic yeast infections cleared up p
romptly when Pau d'Arco was added to the formula.  <b>Pau d'Arco</b> also has anti-inflammatory characteristics, making it useful in the treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory diseases.  Some researchers report its ability to increase red blood ce
ll counts and eliminate some symptoms associated with cancer.<p>
        <b>Espinheira santa's</b> effects also include the elimination of toxins in the body.  This plant is sometimes used as an anti-asthmatic agent.  <b>Espinheira santa</b> benefits the intestinal tract and the immune system indirectly by inhibiting pathoge
nic bacteria and helping restore the intestinal flora, a characteristic shared with <b>Una de gato</b>.<p>
        <b>Suma</b>, called "Brazilian ginseng," strengthens the immune system and reduces tumor formation.  Of  six pfaffic acid sugar compounds isolated from this plant, five of them were shown to inhibit cultured tumor cell melanomas.  The nutrient compositi
on of Suma shows it especially high in the trace element germanium, very important for proper immune system function.  <b>Suma</b> is also a cellular oxygenator and contains two plant hormones, sitosterol and stigmasterol, which encourage estrogen produc
tion and reduce high serum cholesterol levels.  Some patients report an increased resistance to extreme highs or lows in the temperature of their environment from Suma.<p>
These natural healing remedies from the Amazon are true treasures from the environment to those in need of blood sugar regulation or immune system enhancement, and many people find them very beneficial.<p>

<H3>Part Two: Male and Female
Hormone Regulation Herbs</H3>

When Mary Ellen, at 46 years of age, started to go through change of life symptoms - hot flashes, sweating, heart palpitations, depression, mood changes, increased feelings of stress and vaginal dryness - it reminded her of her mother's complicated menopausal years.  Her mom had been given estrogen replacement therapy, an effective but somewhat risky treatment for menopausal symptoms.<P>Researchers have found that the greater the exposure to estrogen over a lifetime, the greater the risk of breast cancer.  After having taken estrogen replacement therapy for twenty years, Mary Ellen's mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Subsequent surgery and follow-up treatment successfully removed the cancer, and her doctor took her off estrogen replacement therapy because it is contraindicated in cases of breast cancer.<P>
Mary Ellen's mother had such a severe  reoccurrence of menopausal symptoms,  however, that she begged her doctor to put her back on estrogen replacement therapy.  He consented only after a year of persistent pleading, warning her of its dangers.  Five years later, Mary Ellen's mother thought she beat the odds against a reoccurrence of cancer; however, shortly thereafter her body was riddled with cancer that had spread to most of her major internal organs.  Mary Ellen feared she would experience a similar fate.<P>
In addition to the symptoms experienced by Mary Ellen and her mother, menopause increases the rate of bone loss leading to osteoporosis. Approximately 50% of women in the U.S. experience moderate to severe menopausal and post-menopausal symptoms.  These symptoms also include loss of muscle tone, thinning of the vaginal wall, and increased risk of bladder infections and prolapsed uterus.<P>

<H3>HELP FROM THE AMAZON RAINFORESTS</H3>
Luckily Mary Ellen came across some herbs from the Amazon during this difficult time in her life.  Of the more than 200,000 plant species found in the Amazon, many have been found to contain hormone-like compounds that are quite similar to estrogen and testosterone.  These plants have been traditionally used to treat women with PMS, menopause and miscarriages, and men with impotence and prostatitis.<P>
One of the most effective herbs from the Amazon for female problems is <B>Suma.</B> <B> Suma</B> is called "Brazilian ginseng" because of the wide variety of conditions it is used to treat in Brazil.  Researchers report that it acts primarily as a regulator of the endocrine, nervous, musculoskeletal and digestive systems.  <B>Suma</B> is classified as a  true adaptogen.  Adaptogens differ from other herbs in that they can be used safely on a daily basis.  Their action is normalizing, as opposed to stimulating or inhibitive.<P>
Two plant hormones, sitosterol and stigmasterol, occur naturally in <B>Suma</B>.  These two plant hormones are phytoestrogens, plant compounds that mimic some of the properties of estrogen.  Another plant compound found in <B>Suma</B>, beta-ecdysone, facilitates cellular oxygenation.<P>
Mary Ellen found that by taking a combination of Amazon herbs containing phytoestrogens, her menopausal symptoms stopped quickly.  Her fears about taking estrogen replacement were eliminated along with her fears of following in her mother's health footsteps.  Plants containing phyto-estrogens have been found to be protective against female hormonal-related cancers, including breast cancer, cancer of the cervix, and endometriosis.<P>
The incidence of female reproductive system problems such as breast cancer, endometriosis and PMS has increased dramatically within the past thirty years.  Ironically, some experts suggest that organochloride pesticides from the environment (DDT, aldrin, chlordane) - which also mimic estrogen in the body - are responsible for these increases.  Women with these disorders have a higher concentration of pesticides in their bodies than women without these disorders.<P>
Other herbs from the Amazon which help establish balance during the menstrual cycle or during menopause include<B> Abuta, Maracuja, Marapuama, Star anise</B> and <B>Una de gato</B>.  Many of these herbs do this indirectly by regulating the nervous system.<P>	
<B>Abuta</B> is always carried by midwives in the Amazon for menstrual cramps and pain before and after childbirth.  They report that it prevents miscarriages.  In Ecuador, it has also been known to stop uterine hemorrhages<P>
<B>Maracuja</B>, also call Passion Flower, is known throughout the world for its natural sedative properties.  <B>Maracuja</B> is especially helpful in cases of PMS.  It is traditionally used for nervous crises,  hysteria, depression, and headaches of nervous origin - symptoms that often occur prior to onset of the menstrual period in susceptible women.<P>
                                                                                                                                                                       
<CENTER><H3>Scientific Names of Amazon Herbs <BR>Used For Female Disorders</H3> 
<TABLE><TABLE BORDER><TR><TH><B>Common Name</B></TH> <TH><B>Scientific Name</B></TH><TR><TD>
<TR><TD>

Una de gato</TD> <TD><I>Uncaria tomentosa</I></TD> </TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR><BR>


According to Brazilians, <B>Marapuama</B> is used frequently for menstrual cramps, premenstrual syndrome and frigidity.  It is also a tonic for the nervous system and helps alleviate symptoms of depression.<P>
<B>Star anise</B> functions as a female tonic.  Herbal texts from Brazil report on its ability to eliminate sad thoughts during the menses.  <B>Una de gato's</B> long history of use for treatment of irregularities of the female cycle and other conditions is well-known in Peru.<I> (See Oct. 1994 issue.)</I><P>
I have found that for female disorders, combinations of herbs from the Amazon are the most effective.  One 35-year-old woman stated that she used to have two-to-four menstrual cycles per month, each lasting one week.  Amazon herbs regulated her periods and slowed down blood flow.  After about six weeks on Amazon herbs, she began having only one period a month.<P>
Other women report total elimination of bloating, irritability and fatigue, and markedly reduced severity of cramps.  It is as if their bodies cycle effortlessly without any physiological strain from cycle to cycle.  Without calendar vigilance, they don't realize their next cycle has arrived.  They appear to have reached a physiological state that expresses "femaleness" without pain and dysfunction. But what about the men?

<H4>AMAZON HERBALS FOR MEN</H4>
By the time Mary Ellen's husband, Sam, hit his 40's, he had experienced what an estimated eighteen million American men between the ages of 40 and 70 currently experience - some aspect of male impotency.  Sam didn't want to end up as part of a statistic; 10% of men are completely impotent, according to a recent Massachusetts study.  He decided to try Amazon herbs.<P>
Three herbs from the Amazon act as aphrodisiacs and have traditionally been used for impotence:<B> Marapuama, Catuaba and Cajueiro</B>.  A recent study at the Institute of Sexology in Paris, France, found that <B>Marapuama</B> was more effective than Yohimbine (pharmaceutical extract from the plant  Yohimbe) for erectile dysfunctions. Sam tried Marapuama, and Mary Ellen reported great results.<P>
<B>Catuaba</B> is used not only for male impotency, but also as a tonic for the male organs and nervous system.  It has been used for extreme fatigue.  <B>Marapuama</B>, also used for impotency, is a tonic for the nervous system.  It helps both males and females.<P>
<B>Cajueiro </B>has aphrodisiac properties and is a general tonic for the body.  Tonics increase vitality by strengthening and rejuvenating either a specific organ, a system, or the whole body.  The value of tonic herbs lies in their normalizing and nurturing effect on the body.<P>
<B>Abuta </B>is used by men in the Amazon for inflammation of the testicles.  It is also helpful for kidney stones and other minor kidney problems. <B> Pau d' Arco</B> and <B>Jatoba</B> are helpful in the treatment of prostate inflammations.<P>
	  Psychological and physiological problems resulting from imbalances in sex hormones are difficult to treat.  Some treatments, like estrogen replacement therapy and testosterone replacement therapy, carry high risks with them.  Amazon herbs, however, offer a risk-free, side-effect-free option to individuals with these disorders.<P>

<H2>Part 3:<BR>
Amazon Herbs for Athletic Performance and Recovery </H2>    <H4> <I> by Dr. Donna Schwontkowski</I></H4>

In 1982, a spinal cord injury of the lower cervical spine changed Brenda Cole's life.  Doctors told her she would be bedridden the rest of her life, never able to sit up again.  Slowly, over time, her positive attitude, determination and faith helped her progress to using a wheelchair and even driving a car.  But that wasn't good enough for Brenda.<P>
	Physically active before her injury, she decided to enter some quadriplegic rugby and wheelchair races.  At first, she experienced a lot of muscle soreness and fatigue both during and after the races.  "I was at a standstill in my recovery," she says.  "I wasn't super strong by any means.  In fact, I would often come in last place.  I recall one wheelchair race when I looked behind and saw a motorcycle cop following me, along with all this traffic.  All the spectators thought the race was over!  I was so embarrassed."<P>
	Shortly thereafter, Brenda was introduced to two Amazon/Chinese herbal combinations that dramatically changed her performance.  In a short period of time, she won her first gold medal in the wheelchair races. Her normal twice-a-week, 3-hour practices for quad rugby never left her out of breath. "Some of the male quad rugby players still get upset with me because I'm not even winded. They're half-dead and sore after practice.  Not me anymore.  Not even during the strenuous rugby training clinics when we work out for two full 8-hour days.  Since I started taking the herbs, no motorcycle cops follow me anymore.  In my last race, even though I didn't get first place, I was right on the winner's wheels for the whole race... It was so close.  One more good breath and I could have beat her." Brenda Cole doesn't count how many gold medals she's won anymore, losing track after twelve.<P>
	Brenda used an Amazon/Chinese herbal formula before training and competitive events and another Amazon/Chinese combination after her workout.  The Chinese herb base in both formulas originated from Shaolin monastery martial artists in China, who used them prior to battles and then afterwards to speed recovery.  Amazon herbs had been added to the basic Chinese formula for increased circulation, nervous system balance, anti-inflammatory effects on muscles, ligaments and joints, and for the relief of soreness.<P>
	The primary Amazon herbs used for their synergistic effects during athletic training and recovery include the following: Catuaba and Marapuama as strong tonics and nervous system fortifiers; Marapuama also for its anti-rheumatic properties; Sarsaparilla to increase circulation, clear  toxins and stimulate metabolism; Iporuru for support of muscle and joint structure; Samambaia for detoxification of waste products and anti-rheumatic properties; Una de gato for antioxidant properties; Tayuya to remove lactic acid accumulations; and Suma for anabolic (muscle-building) effects.

	Of these eight herbs, Suma (Pfaffia paniculata) is by far the most well-researched. Studies by Okui and Otaka dating back to 1968 revealed that the plant enhanced muscle-building without producing the negative hormonal effects steroids are noted for. By 1976, the Russian scientist V.N. Syrov was convinced that the anabolic agent in Suma was beta-ecdysterone. This gave the Russians the competitive edge in the Olympics, and Suma began to be called "the Russian Secret."<P>
A dosage of 500 mg. of Suma twice a day helped all athletes during any stage of their training, according to a research report by Health Research which studied amateur athletes.  Experiment participants first noted a "sense of well-being" within 3-5 days, and a new increased desire to get to their next training session.  Weight lifters experienced much less pain during heavy lifts when they took Suma.  These researchers recommended 500 mg. for every 40 lbs. of body weight, spread out evenly in two divided doses, for the maximum gain in muscle strength and size.  During a 54-day period (almost 8 weeks), the dosage was only taken on days 1-10, 16-25, and days 31-40.  Despite the 24 days off  the herb, researchers  reported that Suma's effects were still felt by the athletes on the off days.<P>

<H4>RESULTS OF A PROMISING NEW STUDY ON AMAZON HERBS</H4>
Christopher Castellano, an exercise physiologist from Orlando, FL, released the final results of his rowing ergometer performance study in January of 1995.  This single-blind study tested eight male and female volunteers, 18-58 years old, using each subject as his or her own control.  Between October 1994 and January 1995, each subject performed to the best of his ability on the rowing ergometer for a distance of 2500 meters; the time was recorded.  Attempts were made to avoid influence from other variables.  For example, all subjects were tested at the same time, every other
day, to avoid significant differences due to the effects of meals and circadian rhythms.<P>
Five trials were used as a control with no supplemental herbs; only water with a small
amount of food coloring to match the experimental beverage was given to the subjects.  The five experimental trials were supplemented with not only the Amazon/Chinese formula for mental focus, power, strength and endurance, but also with a specific Amazonian combination with blood sugar-regulating effects and one which enhanced circulation in the body.<P>
	Not many research projects produce the results recorded in this study.  Every trial using the supplemental herbal combinations was better than the control for every individual in the study. Subjects with the lowest level of fitness seemed to benefit most from the products, although this could be an effect due to conditioning.  Christopher Castellano believes that the Amazonian herbs probably assisted the body in increasing respiratory volume and blood circulation, and in greater lactate removal during aerobic and anaerobic respiration.  Additional studies will need to be done to confirm the exact physiological mechanisms.<P>

<H4>AMAZON HERBS FOR THE NERVOUS SYSTEM</H4>
	Testimonials bring out not only the ability of these herbs to oxygenate the system, but also the important role they play in balancing the nervous system. Good hand, foot and eye coordination - essential for sports - depends on a finely-tuned nervous system.  Amazon herbs traditionally used as nervous system tonics or fortifiers include Catuaba, Lemon Balm, Passion Flower, Marapuama, Mulungu, Star Anise, Suma, and Una de gato.  <I>(See Table 2 and Table 3)</I><P>
	Catuaba is not only a strong tonic and fortifier of the nervous system, according to the tribal folklore, but is also capable of giving strength to people with general fatigue.  This herb has been known to eliminate restless sleep and insomnia, and also to help failing memories.<P>
	Lemon Balm relaxes the nervous system as well as helping to produce sleep.  It has been used traditionally for epilepsy, nerve disorders, insomnia, fainting, hysteria, migraine headaches, hypochondria and vertigo.<P>
	Passion Flower is known throughout the world for its natural sedative properties.  It promotes sleepiness without disorientation, and soothes general pain.  It is consistently used with good results for nervous system disorders such as insomnia, nervous crises, hysteria, depression, as well as headaches of nervous origin.<P>
	Marapuama is a good tonic for the nervous system and useful in treating symptoms of neuralgia or nervous depression.  Mulungu is used in Brazil and Peru as a mild hypnotic sedative to calm the nervous system, eliminate hysteria, decrease insomnia and promote healthy sleeping patterns by sedating overactive neurotransmitters.  Mulungu has also been used to treat epilepsy.<P>
	Star Anise is used as a sedative and induces sleep.  It is thought to prevent fainting.  Suma is used as an adaptogen and known for its oxygenating properties in Brazil.  Una de gato is used to treat cases of organic depression.<P>
 	Many people have reported beneficial effects from a combination of Amazon herbs that enhance the functioning of the nervous system.  Effects include feelings that stress is immediately relieved, feelings calm in the midst of an emotional chaotic situation, and negating the hyperactivity associated with high caffeine consumption.  But what about the ability of the Amazon herbs to facilitate recovery?  Is it possible that some natural substances can work a lot quicker than things our own culture uses now?<P>

<H4>AMAZON HERBS THAT FACILITATE RECOVERY</H4>
The testimonials and case studies speak for themselves.  Charlie Mark, now 45 years old, suffered multiple fractured bones in an airplane accident in 1980.  Prior to the accident, he was a boxer and active in many other sports.  Arthritis affected his hands so much that he would have to give up his golf game after the 3rd or 4th hole.  Charlie tried the Amazon herb Iporuru, and felt an improvement instantly.  The pain is completely eliminated when he takes the Amazon/Chinese combination for recovery.  Recently, Charlie was trimming a gemstone and almost cut off the tip of his index finger.  The cut required 5 stitches.  He began using Amazon herbs directly on the injured area.  Two days later he noticed completely new skin at the wound site.<P>
	Fifty-two year old Rose R. found out she had colon cancer after intense abdominal pain sent her on a trip to the emergency room.  The cancer was so far advanced that a colostomy was performed immediately.  Rose started taking Amazon herbs.  "I would go to sleep at night and could actually see a big difference in the colostomy opening the next morning." She continued to take the herbs, and has had no serious side effects from the chemotherapy.<P>

	One hot summer day in 1993 while Anna B. was giving a seminar, a bee flew in and stung her right cheek.  Immediately swelling resulted, and the only first aid treatment available was Amazon herbs.  A drop of a combination containing samabaia, sarsaparilla, tayuya and Iporuru visibly reduced swelling and allowed the area to heal within two days.<P>
	Massage therapists and chiropractors report a significant reduction in muscle spasms when the herbs are rubbed directly into the affected muscle. Mothers state that having their children gargle with the Amazon herbs (in tincture form) eliminates a sore throat within seconds.  Individuals with skin grafts report a visible improvement daily and healing time cut in half.<P>

	More research is being done on the mechanism of how these herbs work.  In my ongoing series of articles, I have focused on the ability of Amazon herbs to facilitate blood sugar regulation, immune system enhancement, optimal functioning of the nervous system, restoration of hormonal balance in the male and female reproductive systems, enhanced athletic performance, and recovery and accelerated healing times.  In my practice, I have seen these herbs turn around many seemingly impossible health situations.  As our awareness of the efficacy of natural healing increases, more people will discover and benefit from the value of Amazon herbs and incorporate them into their daily wellness programs.<P>

	<I>Dr.  Donna Schwontkowski obtained her doctorate degree in Chiropractic Medicine from National College of Chiropractic in Lombard, IL, simultaneously with a Master's Degree in Nutrition from Northern Illinois University in 1990.  Her long-standing interest in natural healing therapies and her extensive experience in the field of nutrition prompted a research project in 1991 on the effects of an Amazonian herbal combination on weight loss in adults.<P>
	She continues to research the Rainforest herbs, and is currently on a nationwide radio circuit to educate people on how they may benefit from the use of these herbs.  Her chiropractic practice in Salt Lake City emphasizes the natural healing treasures from the Amazon Rainforest.<P>
	Schwontkowski has written a book called Herbs from the Amazon: Traditional and Common Uses.

<h3><i>Printed in The American Journal of Natural Medicine, November 1994, Vol. 1, No. 3, Page 8</i></h3>


        <h2>Yohimbine vs. Muira puama in the treatment of erectile dysfunction</h2>

        The term "impotence" has traditionally been used to signify the inability of the male to attain and maintain erection of the penis sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual intercourse. Impotence, in most circumstances, is more precisely referred to as e
rectile dysfunction as this term differentiates itself from loss of libido, premature ejaculation, or inability to achieve orgasm.<p>
        An estimated 10 to 20 million men suffer from erectile dysfunction.  This number is expected to increase dramatically as the median age of the population increases. Currently, erectile dysfunction is thought to affect over 25% of men over the age of 50.
<p>
        Although the frequency of erectile dysfunction increases with age, it must be stressed that ageing itself is not a cause of impotence. Although the amount and force of the ejaculate as well as the need to ejaculate decrease with age, the capacity for er
ection is retained. Men are capable of retaining their sexual virility well into their 80's.
        Erectile dysfunction may be due to organic or psychogenic factors. In the overwhelming majority of cases the cause is organic, i.e., it is due to some physiological reason.  In fact, in men over the age of 50, organic causes are responsible fro erectile
 dysfunction in of 90%.  In the past, a man with impotence who was able to have nighttime or early morning erections was thought to have psychogenic impotence. However, it is mow recognized that this is not a reliable indicator.<p>

<h4>Yohimbine</h4>
        The only FDA approved medicine for impotence is yohimbine - an alkaloid isolated from the bark of the yohimbe tree (Pausinystalia yohimbe) native to tropical West Africa.  Yohimbine hydrochloride increases libido, but its primary action is to increase b
lood flow to erectile tissue. Yohimbine is a selective alpha-2 receptor antagonist. Contrary to a popular misconception, yohimbine has no effect on testosterone levels.<p>
        When used alone, yohimbine is successful in 34% to 43% of cases. It is effective in both psychogenic and organic cause of impotence.  The standard dose of yohimbine is 15 to 20 mg per day, however, higher doses, up to 42 mg of yohimbine, may prove to be
 more effective.<p>
        To illustrate the benefits to be expected in clinical practice, let's examine the results from one of the more recent double-blind studies. In the study, 82 men with erectile dysfunction selected from a Veterans Administration population with a high inc
idence of diabetes and vascular disease underwent a multifactorial evaluation, including a determination of penile brachial blood pressure index, caver nosography, sacral evoked response, testosterone and prolactin determination, sexual dysfunction and a
rousal test.<p>
        After one month of treatment with the maximum of 42.0 mg oral yohimbine hydrocholride daily 14% of the patients experienced restoration of full and sustained erections. 20% reported a partial response to the therapy and 65% reported no improvement.  In
comparison, only three patients reported a positive effect in the placebo group. Maximum effect with yohimbine takes two to three weeks to manifest itself.  Yohimbine was active in some patients with arterial insufficiency and a unilateral sacral reflex
arc lesion, and in one with low serum testosterone levels. The 34% response is somewhat encouraging given the study population.<p>
        Side effects often make yohimbine very difficult to utilize. Yohimbine can induce anxiety, panic attacks, and hallucinations in some individuals. Other side effects include elevations in blood pressure, and heart rate, dizziness, headache, and skin flus
hing. Yohimbine should not be used in individuals with psychological disturbances.<p>
        Although crude yohimbe bark preparations are available commercially, use of pure yohimbine hydrochloride is preferred.  There are no commercial sources of yohimbe bark that are available to physicians or in health food stores which actually state the le
vel of yohimbine per dosage. Without knowing the content of yohimbine, it is virtually impossible to prescribe an effective and consistent dosage. Because of the yohimbine content of yohimbe bark, the FDA classifies yohimbe as an unsafe herb.<p>

<h4>Muira puama</h4>
        Preliminary research indicates one of the best herbs to use for erectile dysfunction or lack of libido may be Muira puama (also known as potency wood). This shrub is native to Brazil and has long been used as a powerful aphrodisiac and nerve stimulant i
n South American folk medicine. A recent study has validated its safety and effectiveness in improving libido and sexual function in some patients.<p>
        At the Institute of Sexology in Paris, France, under the supervision of one of the world's foremost authorities on sexual function, Dr. Jacques Waynberg, a clinical study with 262 patients complaining of lack of sexual desire and the inability to attain
 or maintain an erection demonstrated Muira puama extract to be effective in many cases    Within two weeks, at a daily dose of 1 to 1.5 grams of the extract (4:1), 62% of patients with loss of libido claimed that the treatment had dynamic effect while 5
1% of patients with "erection failures" felt that Muira puama was of benefit. These results are extremely promising and seem to indicate that Muira puama may provide better results than yohimbine without side effects.<p>
        Presently, the mechanism of action of Muira puama is unknown, From the preliminary information, it appears that it works on enhancing both psychological and physical aspects of sexual function. Future research will undoubtably shed additional light on t
his extremely promising herb for erectile dysfunction.<p>

<h2> Muira Puama</h2>

        Muira puama,  a.k.a. potency wood (Ptychopetalum olacoides), is a shrub native to Brazil that has long been used as a powerful aphrodisiac and nerve stimulant in  folk medicine.  A recent clinical study has validated its safety and effectiveness in impr
oving libido and sexual function in men.<p>

        At the Institute of Sexology in Paris, France, a clinical study with 262 patients complaining of lack of sexual desire and the inability to attain or maintain an erection demonstrated Muira puama extract (4:1) to be effective in many cases. Within two w
eeks, at a daily dose of 1 to 1.5 grams of extract, 62% of  patients with loss of libido claimed that the treatment had dynamic effect while 51% of patients with "erection failures" felt that Muira puama was of benefit.<p>

        Presently, the mechanism of action of Muira puama is unknown. Future research will undoubtedly shed additional light on this extremely promising herb for impotence.<p>

The number of potentially useful medicinal plants growing in the world's rainforests is estimated to be in the thousands.  Certainly, mankind would benefit from the application of these plants.  In future years, we might witness the discovery of cures for many serious diseases in rainforest plants.  But there are serious questions about how we should go about achieving these goals.  For example: who should do it?  Drug companies?  Herb companies?  Indigenous peoples?  Government agencies?  Other questions are equally important.  How do we protect the natural resources from over harvesting?  How do we protect the native peoples from cultural shock?  Who should do the research?  How do you train people for this enterprise and who should hire them?  Literally pages of these kinds of questions could be asked; and they are all important.<P>
As much as we would like to see immediate results from rainforest exploration, the rule of thumb must be to go slowly.  We can not expect to see a plethora of rain-forest remedies come pouring out of jungles overnight.<P>
The only currently obvious trend in rainforest development is the phenomenon of drug companies rushing to South America and South Pacific Islands, usually under sponsorship of the National Cancer Institute, in search of novel compounds.  Tagging along with them are dozens of North American herbalists whose motives are not clear, but which appear to be education, rather than profit-oriented.  One of the greatest of all medical ironies is that the very companies that disparage herbal remedies rely themselves on herbal remedies to an overwhelming extent as the source for successful drugs.  We have seen video clips of drug seekers gazing in awe at the effective application of rainforest medicinals by local shamans and herbal medicine men, barely able to contain their excitement about getting the herbs back to the laboratory to discover how it "really" works.<P>
Meanwhile, left to his own devices, the indigenous peoples of the rainforest and other 'uncivilized' places on the earth seem to do just fine utilizing methods passed down from generation to generation in accordance with a great variety of ingenious religious, social and medical customs.  These people typically try to resist the encroachment of the Western invasion, many refusing to accept Western medicine.  Others eventually succumb to the fascination of modern gimmicks and the promise of a better life.
Our primary task, it would seem, is to respect and preserve all aspects of the rainforest, including the plants and people, while finding ways to benefit ourselves from these great storehouses of the earths healing agents.<P>

<font size=+2><B>Important Herbs From South American Rainforests</B></font><BR>
	
The remainder of this article will discuss remedies from the rainforests of South America, since this is the area that is currently of most interest to North Americans.  Although there are literally thousands of rainforest plants that would make wonderful additions to the world's pharmacopoeia, there are only a handful that have reached that status.  While most current attention is directed at the rainforest remedies of Peru, Belize, Columbia, Ecuador and Amazonian Brazil, several of the well-known and commercially available remedies of South American rainforests come from other areas.<P>

Some of the following herbs you may have heard of and others I am sure you have never heard of.  These are just but a handful of the many herbal remedies that plants supply us with.  And they are also the same herbal remedies that the large drug companies do not want you to know about.<P>

<font size=+1> <B>Lapacho</B> <I>(Tabebuia avellandedae, and T. Impetiginosa).</I></font><BR> Also commonly known as Pau D'arco, this is perhaps the best known South American remedy available in the U.S. It has been recommended for many ailments, including cancer (esp.  Leukemia), candida and a host of other infections, relief of pain in chemotherapy, arthritis, etc.  It demonstrates a marked anti-oxidant effect and has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi.  In folklore it is also listed as a diuretic, sedative, decongestant, and hypotensive.  It is considered one of the world's great tonic herbs.<P>

<font size=+1> <B>Yerba mate</B> <I>(Ilex paraguariensis).</I><BR> </font>  Another popular South American herb, growing in the rainforests, but. now cultivated in large sub-tropical plantations, is this member of the holly family, renowned for its stimulant and nutritive effects.  Yerba mate has been used by natives, especially the Guarani Indians, as a dietary staple during times of drought or famine.  They thrive on it due to its high nutritive content.  Mate is also used as a treatment for hay fever and asthma and is often combined with lapacho to enhance the action of that herb.  The plant is often used to improve digestion, to both curb and enhance the appetite, to combat fatigue, as a cardiotonic, and an immunotonic.  Like other xanthine-containing plants, mate's most consistent application is as a mild stimulant.  Unlike similar plants (coffee, tea, guarana, kola nut), mate use does not lead to caffeinism, upset sleep, physical tolerance, and adrenal stress.<P>

<font size=+1> <B>Guarana</B> <I>(Paullinia cupana). </I><BR> </font> Another xanthine-containing plant, guarana is widely used throughout South America as a stimulant.  Certain guarana-based.drinks are also popular in the U.S. and Europe. Considered to be a more powerful stimulant than yerba mate, guarana exhibits properties and side effects more closely aligned with the other caffeinaceous plants.<P>

<font size=+1> <B>Passion flower</B> <I>(Passiflora incarnata).</I></font><BR>  This is perhaps one of the earliest (1569) rainforest plants to be exported and eventually cultivated in Europe and the U.S. It has always been used as a sedative, to reduce anxiety and tension.  It also has a mild analgesic action.  Passion flower is a favorite remedy for PMS and insomnia.<P>

<font size=+1> <B>Suma</B><I> (Pffafia paniculata).</I></font><BR>  From the Amazonian rainforest, was introduced to the U.S. market in the mid-to-late 80's.  Suma is known as 'Para Toda' by the indigenous people of Brazil, and was labeled 'Brazilian ginseng' by Japanese citizens of Brazil, the latter term giving some clue as to what benefits the consumer might expect to realize from its use.  Para Toda, the Portuguese term, apparently means "for everything." Among the claims for Para Toda are these: aphrodisiac, tonic, energizer, anti-cancer aid, immune enhancer, and diabetic remedy.<P>


<font size=+1> <B>Cat's Claw</B><I> (Uncaria tomentosa).</I></font><BR>   Also known as "Una de Gato" this is the most recent rainforest product to emerge in commercially available quantities.  It hails from Peruvian forests.  It is currently being touted as a possible remedy for cancer and AIDS, and appears to demonstrate considerable immunostimulant action.  Available research is encouraging.  Strenuous efforts are being implemented to prevent endangering supplies, a problem that has threatened both lapacho and suma.<P>

<font size=+1> <B>Muira Puama</B> <I>(Liriosma ovata).</I></font><BR>  A native folk medicine of Brazil, muria puama is best known as an aphrodisiac.  Although it has been known for hundreds of years, its popularity waxes and wanes, and it has struggled to gain a foothold in the U.S. Early Italian research discovered an androgenic action similar to that of yohimbe, but without the side effects that yohimbe is known to possess.  Muira Puama is cited in the conservative British Herbal Pharmacopoeia as an astringent and aromatic and reluctantly acknowledges its possible aphrodisiac action.  It is recommended in the treatment of dysentery and impotence.<P>

<font size=+1> <B>Stevia</B><I> (Stevia rebaudiana).</I></font><BR>  The leaf of the stevia plant, a native of rainforest in Paraguay and Brazil, is several hundred times sweeter than sugar, calorie-free, health promoting, completely free of side effects, and poses a great threat to the giants of the artificial sweetener business.  For this reason the FDA has banned the import of stevia for many years.  Recently, the ban was lifted, probably because some large manufacturer is planning to utilize it in the artificial sweetener industry.  Suppliers are still prohibited from making sweetener claims for stevia.  At any rate, pure stevia leaf and various extracts of stevia are currently available and make wonderful additions to the diet.<P>
	
<font size=+1> <B>Boldo</B><I> (Pneumus boldus). </I></font><BR> Found in Chile and Peru, boldo leaves have been used by indigenous peoples for liver ailments and in the treatment of gallstones.  It is recommended by Western scientists as a diuretic, laxative and liver tonic.  Boldo comes to the U.S. via certain European manufacturers.  It is still not commonly found in our health food stores, but will certainly become more popular in the future.<P>

<font size=+1> <B>Cinchona</B> <I>(Cinchona species).</I></font><BR>  The entire modern era of ethnobotany and search for drugs in the world's rainforests began with cinchona, the only source of natural quinine, the original cure of malaria.  Quinine was eventually synthesized, but it is still possible to obtain cinchona bark and to use it as an immunostimulant.  It not only cures (but does not prevent) malaria, but has antiviral and antipyretic properties.  It can also be used to as a tonic and stimulate the appetite, treat headaches, leg cramps and colds.<P>


<font size=+1> <B>Jaborandi </B><I>(Pilocarpus pennatifolius).</I></font><BR>
This native of Central and South America is perhaps the only 'true' diaphoretic currently known.  Diaphoretics stimulate profuse sweating, usually through the action of glycosides.  But in jaborandi, alkaloids have been found that directly and powerfully stimulate the sweat glands and salivary glands.  Whereas other diaphoretics require concomitant heat, jaborandi can be consumed cold and still be effective.  The drug pilocarpine is derived from this plant, but the action of the whole plant is more effective, and devoid of serious side effects unless consumed in copious amounts.<P>

<font size=+1> <B> Papaya</B> <I>(Carica papaya).</I></font><BR>  Papaya, or the pawpaw tree, is the source of the powerful proteolytic digestive enzymes papain and chymopapain.<P>

<font size=+1> <B>Ipecac, lpecacuanha</B><I> (Cephaelis ipecacuanha).</I></font><BR>  Hailing from Brazil, ipecac is principally known as an expectorant, but is also an emetic, and care must be used in its application.  Many European doctors still use ipecac as the agent of choice in bronchitis.  However, in this country, ipecac is seldom used for this purpose, and other products are rapidly replacing ipecac in all areas of application.  Nevertheless, for many decades ipecac was one of our most important medicinal agents.<P>

<font size=+1> <B>Coca</B><I> (Erythoxylum coca).</I></font><BR>  One hesitates to list a plant with dubious reputation and which, as a source of cocaine, is a controlled drug in the U.S., but it should be noted that the indigenous dwellers of the rainforest chew coca leaves on a regular basis to relieve hunger and quench thirst and overcome fatigue, and only rarely become addicted.<P>

<font size=+1> <B>Common Nasturtium</B><I> (Tropaeolum majus).</I></font><BR>  In Peru, this plant is commonly used to improve the healing of wounds.  As a plant of commerce, it is the source of an important antibiotic, one of the few to come from a higher plant species.  Its advantage over antibiotics from lower plants is a greater margin of safety since patients do not develop resistance or allergies to it.<P>


<font size=+2> <B>The Future.</b></font><BR>
Although great effort is being expended in cataloging the thousands of uses of rainforest plants, it is very difficult to accurately predict which remedies may emerge as viable commercial products.  There is not only the problem of supply, but consideration must be given to legal, political, cultural, sociological, and phytomedical research problems.  The recent of emergence of cat's claw represents an apparently successful convergence of these many factors.<P>
Perhaps our most immediate concern should be the preservation of rainforest biodiversity while discovering ways and means to benefit from the potential remedies to serious health problems that exist there.  Again, using cat's claw, or even Suma, as examples, should a cure for AIDS be forthcoming, then the exploitation of these plants may be justified.<P>
The excitement surrounding rainforest remedies is building in this country, as is the effort to protect them from destruction.  There is a need for all of us to become more involved in this effort if we expect to continue to enjoy our rainforest remedies. <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">1.</A>  "Passion flower is known throughout the world for its natural sedative properties.  It is consistently used with good results for nervous system related disorders such as insomnia, nervousness, hysteria, neurasthenia*, depression and headaches of nervous origin.  It promotes sleepiness without disorientation and soothes general pain.  Passion flower is used to safely relax hyperactive children. Passion flower has disinfectant and diuretic properties.  It is also a vermifuge.<BR>  *Neurasthenia is a psychosomatic disorder characterized by easy fatiguability, lack of motivation and feelings of inadequacy."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">2.</A> "Passion flower has a calming effect.  It is great for hypertensive children.  It is a mild sedative which soothes the nerves, helps with hemorrhoids, headaches, menopause and is an antispasmodic.  It regulates mood swings and high blood pressure.  It has been used for seizures, hysteria, colic, diarrhea and has an antibiotic activity.  Passion flower balances excess heart yang and fortifies heart yin."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">3.</A>  "ACTIONS: Promotes calm, Encourages healthy sleep patterns, Regulates mood swings.  TRADITIONAL USE: Passion Flower is known world wide as a natural sedative.  It has been used effectively for all types of nervous excitation, hysteria, neurasthenia as well as depression.  Indicated for all types of insomnia, as it promotes sleepiness without disorientation.  Honored by Brazilian mothers for its effectiveness to calm hyperactive children and believed helpful in controlling convulsions.  MERIDIAN INDICATIONS: Calms excessive Heart Yang, Fortifies Heart Yin, Calms Shen. EVA POINTS:  Heart, Circulation"<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">6.</A>  "Actions: sedative, anodyne, hypnotic, antispasmodic. CAUTION: Avoid high doses in pregnancy."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">8.</A> "Brazilan uses and Folklore: Maracuja tea is a natural sedative.  Dr. Alberto Seabra, a well known homeopathic physician, states "Today it [Maracuja] is known world wide and used by itself or combined in different formulas by many laboratories and under various names.  It provokes natural sleepiness, without causing nervous depression, and because of this it is indicated for all types of insomnia.  The ill person, under its action, mantains complete lucidity, and the ability to think, speak and act and feels better right up to failing asleep.  Continuing use, where necessary, has no counter indications because it is not toxic or addictive. It should be recommended for all types of nervous excitation, hysteria, neurastenia and in cases of obsessive depression."* A cup of Maracuja tea or 2 glasses of juice will naturally calm down the most hyperactive child, and for this reason it is highly valued by Brazilian mothers.  Maracuja is also good for treating chronic alcoholism, infantile convulsions, delirium tremens and nervous headaches.  A. Balbach also prescribes Maracuja for diarrhea, intestinal worms and respiratory problem* Uses: Helpful for nervousness and insomnia, useful in controlling convulsions, irritative and neuralgic pains, nervous headaches, spasms.  Improves circulation and nutrition to nerve centers.<BR>  * Prof.  Alfons Balbach, -A Flora Nacional na Medicina Domestica Vol. II  p. 712. (Edicoes "A Edificacao do Lar ", Sao Paulo)"<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">10.</A>  "Passiflora edulis  Sims.  Passifloraceae.  "Maracuya, "Purple granadilla".  Cultivated.  Fruits edible.  Brazilians on Rio Tapajos drink the pure fruit juice for the heart (BDS), using the leaf tea as a sedative."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">11.</A>"Maracuja, also call Passion Flower, is known throughout the world for its natural sedative properties.  Maracuja is especially helpful in cases of PMS.  It is traditionally used for nervous crises,  hysteria, depression, and headaches of nervous origin - symptoms that often occur prior to onset of the menstrual period in susceptible women."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">14.</A>"Passion flower, like valerian root, has a long, colorful history of use as a sedative.  Passion flower usually takes the back seat to valerian, but in a recent survey of popular herbal sedatives in Great Britain, passion flower narrowly outscored valerian root for top honors.  Passion flower is used primarily as a sedative or nervine to combat excess nervousness and anxiety, to tranquilize, and to induce sleep; as an anodyne, anti-spasmodic and anti-convulsant to treat dysmenorrhea and muscle cramps.<BR>Primarily, passion flower is used world wide as a mild sedative or nervine that reduces anxiety, nervous tension, high blood pressure, and encourages sleep.  It has also been employed as an antispasmodic (or spasmolytic) in the treatment of muscle cramps, convulsions, premenstrual tension, and even epilepsy.  Passion flower preparations have been observed to overcome nervous symptoms and cramps that inhibit sleep, and to produce a restful and deep sleep free from frequent awakenings and disturbances.  The antispasmodic action is also successfully used in the treatment of bronchial asthma.<BR>Passion flower is well known for its analgesic or anodyne action.  Topically it has been used in Europe and America on burns and in compresses and has a marked effect against inflammations, especially hemorrhoids.  It is used in South America as a diuretic and for hemorrhoidal inflammations.  In Brazil it is used as an antispasmodic and sedative.  The Brazilians even have a favorite passion flower drink, called maracuja grande, that frequently used to treat asthma, whooping cough, bronchitis and other tough coughs.  North American applications include use a an analgesic and anticonvulsant, with some success noticed in cases of tetanus.  Italian physicians have placed great emphasis on passion flower in the treatment of asthma, and in Poland is used in a proprietary drug for treating neurasthenia, hysteria and abnormal sexual excitability.  Throughout Europe, passion flower is used to treat nervous conditions and pain that accompany female complaints ranging from dysmenorrhea to PMS disturbances of menopause.<BR>Other uses of passion flower, several of which have receive some support in the experimental literature, include the treatment of nervous, high-strung, and easily excited children, cardiovascular neuroses, coronary sickness, circulation weakness, and concentration problems in school children.<BR>The analgesic, sedative, sleep-inducing and spasmolytic effects of passion flower are closely related and seldom occur in isolation.  Early investigators sometimes noticed that the herb worked especially well in those cases where sleeplessness could be traced to inflammation of the brain-it appeared to act as an analgesic and anticonvulsant.  Neuralgia is commonly treated with passion flower.  The analgesic or anodyne action of passion flower is regularly cited in noted codexes around the world."<P>

Passion Flower Family<BR>

This family has twelve genera and some 600 species of warm and tropical regions, especially South America.  They are herbaceous or woody vines provided with tendrils.  Several species, especially of the genus Passiflora, are cultivated for their edible fruits.  They are believed to be related to the Caricaceae, the Papaya Family.
Alkaloids, phenols, tannins and cyanogenic compounds are known in the family.  Glycosyl favonoids have been found in several species (Ulubelen, 1983).  Therapeutic use of certain members has been reviewed (Lutomski, 1981).  Antibiotic activity (Birner, 1973) is due, probably, to the presence of an acetylenic compound.<BR>
<B>Passiflora </B>Linnaeus<BR>
The 12 genera and more than 500 species of herbaceous and woody plants, usually climbers, are distributed in warm and tropical regions mainly in the Americas but with a few in Asia, Australia and Madagascar.The chemistry described for the family refers primarily to this genus.<BR>

It is recommended on a basis of confirmed experience, in the treatment of disorders of the nervous system .... Through the latest physiological and therapeutic experiments done in Paris by Dr. Rebourgeon, the efficiency of this plant has been confirmed... giving good results in gastrointestinal and circulatory asthenia and in impotency of the genital organs." (p. 258).  G. L.

 "The primary Amazon herbs used for their synergistic effects during athletic training and recovery include the following: Catuaba and Marapuama as strong tonics and nervous system fortifiers; Marapuama also for its anti-rheumatic properties;<BR>
     Three herbs from the Amazon act as aphrodisiacs and have traditionally been used for impotence: Marapuama, Catuaba, and Cajueiro.  A recent study at the Institute of Sexology in Paris, France, found that Marapuama was more effective than Yohimbine (pharmaceutical extract from the plant Yohimbe) fore erectile dysfunctions.

     Amazon herbs traditionally used as nervous system tonics or fortifiers include Catuaba, Lemon Balm, Passion Flower, Marapuama, Mulungu, Star Anise, Suma, and Una de gato.  Marapuama is a good tonic for the nervous system and useful in treating symptoms of neuralgia or nervous depression.<BR>  
     Other herbs from the Amazon which help establish balance during the menstrual cycle or during menopause include Abuta, Maracuja, Marapuama, Star anise and Una de gato.  According to Brazilians, Marapuama is used frequently for menstrual cramps, premenstral syndrome and frigidity.  It is also a tonic for the nervous system and helps alleviate symptoms of depression."<P>

<A HREF="refkey.htm">13.</A>"The only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medicine for impotence is yohimbine - an alkaloid isolated from the bark of the yohimbe tree (Pausinystalia yohimbe) native to tropical West Africa. Yohimbine hydrochloride increases libido, but its primary action is to increase blood flow to erectile tissue.  Contrary to a popular misconception, yohimbine has no effects on testosterone levels.<BR>
	When used alone, yohimbine is successful in 34-43 percent of cases.(1)  However, side effects often make yohimbine very difficult to utilize. Yohimbine can induce anxiety, panic attacks, and hallucinations in some individuals. Other side effects include elevations in blood pressure, and heart rate, dizziness, headache, and skin flushing. Yohimbine should not be used by individuals with kidney disease, by women, or by individuals with psychological disturbances. Because of the yohimbine content of yohimbe bark, the FDA classifies yohimbe as an unsafe herb.<BR>
	One of the best herbs to use for erectile dysfunction is Muira puama (Ptychopetalum olacoides). This shrub is native to Brazil and has long been used as a powerful aphrodisiac and nerve stimulant in South American folk medicine. A recent clinical study has validated its safety and effectiveness in improving libido and sexual function in some patients.(2)<BR>
	At the Institute of Sexology in Paris, France, under the supervision of one of the world's foremost authorities on sexual function, Dr. Jacques Waynberg, a clinical study with 262 patients complaining of lack of sexual desire and the inability to attain or maintain an erection demonstrated Muira puama extract to be effective in many cases.    Within 2 weeks, at a daily dose of 1 to 1.5 grams of the extract, 62 percent of patients with loss of libido claimed that the treatment had dynamic effect while 51 percent of patients with "erection failures" felt that Muira puama was of benefit.<BR>
	Presently, the mechanism of action of Muira puama is unknown, From the preliminary information, it appears that it works on enhancing both psychological and physical aspects of sexual function.

	<CENTER><H2>Male Sexual Asthenia-<BR>
	Interest In A Traditional <BR>
	Plant-Derived Medication:<BR>
	"Testor-plus"</H2></CENTER>

<blockquote>
The primary care physician frequently encounters patients complaining of fatigue, which has been estimated to afflict 10% of adult male patients in an urban setting.  The physical, psychosomatic or purely emotional manifestations of this problem tend to follow patterns set by the constitution and personality of the individual patient.  Sexual dysfunction is becoming more and more prominent among these symptoms of fatigue.  It is associated with social and cultural risk factors, as well as with age.  After the age of 40, 50% of patients giving a history of a deficiency state of the asthenic type focus their clinical history on the areas of erection and libido.  It is frequently noted that the  therapeutic response to the commonly used treatments for these conditions is not satisfactory.  The use of a botanical product, whose active principal is currently used in a French overseas territory for these functional asthenias of a sexual type, is an alternative that at least offers an assurance of harmlessness and tolerance in subjects otherwise in good health.<P>


<H3>Asthenia As A Cause of Male Impotence</H3>
Though asthenia has been the subject of studies confirming its etiologic role in numerous psychosomatic syndromes, studies regarding its role in male sexual dysfunction are absent from the sexological literature.  The principal works in the field say nothing of the various fatigue states in the inventory of non-organic causes of impotence and weak libido.  This is the case for example in two classics: Sexual Pathology by Magnus Hirschfeld (1920) and  Human Sexual Inadequacy by Masters and Johnson (1970).<P>

Three reasons could be given to explain the fact that the links between the symptoms of asthenia and certain male sexual problems have only been remarked upon in the last twelve years:<P>

<UL>
<LI>	-   The neurophysiological interpretation of the asthenic syndrome is quite recent.  The role of the reticular activating system not only supplies  a common denominator to the various clinical presentations of asthenia, however variable they may be, but also allows us to group together in the same etio-pathogenic  current certain behavioral dysfunctions, including the sexual, that  are dominated by a lack of motivation and  maladaption to stress.  It is thus quite pertinent in practice to isolate from the otherwise heterogeneous group of male sexual dysfunction a category of deficiency states, which the usual division between organic and psycho-affective does not allow us to distinguish.<P>

<LI>	-   Even a superficial reading of the psychotherapeutic research allows us to refute the lumping together of all the different forms of inhibition of action under the single label of "depressive syndromes."   If the asthenia is part of the picture of a reactive depression, or of a neurotic depression, it truly constitutes a clinical entity.  Its diagnosis allows us to take into consideration, without "psychiatrizing" them, the sufferings that take place within the confines of normal, everyday existence.  It is against this background that the practitioner is called upon, today more than previously, to understand and manage disorders that can be quite disruptive of intimacy.<P>

<LI>  The human cost of asthenia, finally, is more and more understood as an unavoidable consequence of urban life, of fatigue and boredom, and of professional constraints that affect the structure of sleep, digestive balance, and sexuality.  Ecological thinking and the incessant mobilization of opinion by the media offer patients a new understanding of disease, a new vocabulary and attendant prejudices.  Wrong or right, asthenia finds itself  understood in terms of personal defeat, of which the failures of conjugal performance are the most painful expressions.
</UL>


It is important to consider that this explanatory scheme offers not only a more comprehensive understanding of asthenic states; by taking more seriously our habitual responses, it obliges us to redefine our therapeutic tools in the face of these modes of expression of a socio-cultural morbidity which places the course of mainstream medicine and in opposition to the demands of patients in good health but sick in their mode of living. Historically, the first observations found refuge in the anti-psychiatric movement and the therapeutic innovations that took place during the 1980's in the United States, among Neo-Reichian groups, ideological behaviorists, and body work therapies of various kinds, responding to a need for the ritualization of personal development.<P>

<H3>Standard Therapeutic Modalities</H3>

Thus, the principal diagnostic criterion for this symptomatology of male sexual dysfunction being a lack of organic etiology, the usual pharmaceutical treatments are manifestly subject to criticism.  It is currently notable that, in the absence of specifically sexually therapeutic products, many practitioners hold to the use of medications whose primary indications are more or less foreign to erectile function and libido.<P>
These commonly used drugs fall mainly into four categories:  androgenic hormones, vaso-dilators, psychotropics, and tricyclic (and related) antidepressants.

The use of androgens  follows a now abandoned theory that the "prime mover" of the physiology of erection is the plasma testosterone level.  It has been clearly established at this time that in healthy subjects, the transient elevated blood levels of testosterone achieved by androgen injections have no effect on erections... but can have, besides the iatrogenic effects on the prostate, an effect on aggressiveness through its unnecessary stimulation of the limbic-hypothalamic axis.<P>

Relying likewise on a warmed-over combination of obsolete physiological arguments, the use of oral agents reputed to be vasodilators is entirely futile and dangerous in the realm of psychogenic disturbances of erection.  Very often, patients will resort to self-medication at doses higher than prescribed, aggravating the undesirable side-effects.  Such is the distance between the action of vasodilator drugs and the intimate mechanisms of erection that it is necessary to create in-situ, by intra-cavernous injections, a veritable intoxication of the erectile tissues in order to achieve an iatrogenic rigidity of the member.  The risks of such methods are not only at the organic level, but also medico-legal and judicial.<P>

Everyone recognizes the frequent use of psychotropic medications and the risk of habituation that they incur, and not necessarily only after long use.  As an element of depression is often associated with the disruption of relationships caused by sexual dysfunction, recourse to tranquilizers and hypnotics appears if not indispensable, at least logical.  This fails to consider the context, more conflictual than psycho-pathologic, to impose on the libido and erection, a class of medications notorious for their iatrogenic effects, especially in the older subjects who are often under treatment for sexual problems: orthostatic hypotension, falls, malaise or confusional states can all arise from the use of such vain and imprudent prescriptions.<P>

The polycyclic antidepressants are characterized by their  weak effects in the sexual sphere.  It would seem that their activating effect on the general constitution would have a beneficial effect on the transitory instability of the erection, but this is not the case.  The complexity of erotic functioning poses an obstacle to such a simplistic hypothesis.  Furthermore, these prescriptions are usually accompanied by wonderful promises of their effectiveness... enhancing the placebo effect for some, but worsening the disappointment for those who do not achieve the promised "cure."<P>

We close finally with the therapeutic jokes that take advantage of the remarkable laxity of regulation: the arsenal of medications made freely available to the public through "sex shops."  If some of these are swindles pure and simple, consisting of nothing more than food colorings, others- notably some imported clandestinely from Germany- are identical to pharmaceutical products  and present a significant risk of toxicity to consumers who are duped and encouraged to take overdoses.<P>

	<CENTER><H2>Testor-plus and the Traditional Use
	of "Muira Puama"</H2></CENTER>


Confronted with demands for help whose frequency and authenticity need not be re-emphasized, the medical profession has available an alternative to these ill-advised prescriptions and crude efforts.  Within the current state of  our knowledge it is possible to appeal to the resources of ethnobotanical pharmacology, once the choice of a plant product has been validated, and its safety ascertained.<P>

As far as we are concerned, the publication in 1987 by Orstom of a traditional pharmacopoeia of Guyana provided the definitive impetus for pharmacological research and initial clinical trials on a shrub that is commonly used for treating sexual asthenia by French populations living in the Amazon region. <P>

It is our intention to illustrate by a diligent ethno-pharmacological investigation in Guyana, the sound basis for the use of this Amazonian shrub, and also to show that our clinical observations, toxicological studies and chemical analyses corroborate the conclusions of the literature regarding the lack of toxicity of this product.<P>

From the pharmaceutical point of view we have constructed around the plant extract a simple dietetic environment (sugars and fish milt) to allow a presentation and oral absorption more familiar to European consumers, but the sole  active principal remains Muira Puama.<P>


	<CENTER><H3>Extemporaneous Clinical Observations</H3></CENTER>


The use of Testor-plus by itself was studied in 100 subjects being seen for sexual difficulties associated with a functional asthenia.  Inclusion in the study was limited to men over 18 years of age, presenting with a complaint of impotence, loss of desire, or both.  Criteria for exclusion included asthenias associated with organic disease, psychiatric syndromes, concurrent treatment known to have iatrogenic effects in the sexual sphere, occurrence of a serious intercurrent illness, or premature cessation of treatment.<P>

The dosage regimen consisted of six oral doses a day for a ten day period.  Successive evaluations were done at T0, the first day; T1 at 15 days from the start of treatment; and T2 on the 30th day.<P>

<B>1) The requisite male population</B><P>

The one hundred subjects came in nine out of ten cases from an urban population, who were consulting general physicians.  The average age was 45 years, ranging from 26 to 69.  82% were married or living conjugally, 14% currently celibate, four of whom were without partners for three months or more.<P>

It is important to note that two thirds of the subjects had no significant personal or family history, and could be considered perfectly healthy aside from the current episode of asthenia and the sexual difficulties in question.  In summary, there were 14% with treated hypertension, 6% with prior gastric or duodenal ulcer, and 6% with depression that could be considered chronic but not under current treatment with medication.  Three patients gave histories of episodes of renal colic, and one case of controlled hypercholesterolemia, one asthmatic, one with chronic bronchitis, one case of sinusitis, one case of surgical hemorrhoids and one case of psoriasis.<P>

Impotence was the sole reason for referral in 82% of the cases, and 18% also indicated  a loss of libido.<P>

<B>2) The psycho-somatic environment</B><P>

Outside of the classical criteria for the clinical  evaluation of the patient who complains of feeling tired, a more subjective approach to asthenia relies on five parameters that allow us to measure the initial severity, and also the degree of change in the various stages of treatment, using a scale of one to five:<P>

1 : very little improvement<BR>
2 : a little<BR>
3 : a moderate amount<BR>
4 : a lot<BR>
5 : great improvement<P>

This involves estimating, based on the patient's own evaluation, the impact of fatigue on the comfort and efficiency of everyday life, the quality of sleep, the state of digestive functions, an inventory of possible functional problems belonging to the classical psychosomatic complications of asthenia, and finally to note evidence of recent psychological difficulties as witnessed by an excess of personal problems.<P>

	a)  Fatigue is considered by 30 patients as causing little disability, 64 consider themselves to be genuinely tired, and six describe a state of exhaustion.<P>

	b)  Sleep may represent an index of the validity of these observations, since the disorganization of its cycles is never absent in an episode of asthenia that has not begun to improve within two weeks.  It is thus important to note here that four out of the six subjects who described themselves as being "exhausted" all described very severe sleep disturbances.  On the other hand, since forty six patients expressed no difficulty in this regard, one has reason to believe that the asthenia in question had only a minimal degree of  morbidity, on either the physical plane or on the emotional.  Morning insomnia is characteristic of a major increase in morbidity, as it signifies the arrival of a true depressive state in the asthenic.  In our study, two patients described such morning insomnia.  Thirty eight others indicated difficulties primarily with falling asleep, so revealing that it is in the mode of anxiety that they react and struggle against obstacles, to which they owe their waking in the middle of the night in an unaccustomed manner and without apparent reason.  In sum, though it is simple and non-invasive on the psychological level, the questionnaire regarding sleep is extremely interesting.  It permits the practitioner to assign a thymic character to the asthenia that he is in the process of exploring, placing it on a depressive gradient, either dominated by anxiety, or as having a priori, as is the case in this study for half the sample population, no  adverse effects on the biorhythms of the patient.  The correlation's between biorhythms, perturbations in the affective sphere and asthenia constitute the cornerstone of the prognostic evaluation and consequently, for the initial choice of therapy.<P>

	c)  The appetite is principally regulated by the cycle of energy consumption of the organism, obviously, but we all know from experience that its structure  is not free of the influence of the emotional universe: appetite is lost, as one says, in an atmosphere of general anxiety, and grows abnormally large to reach the critical threshold of bulimia under the control of a marked depression.  Certainly, the reality of the individual escapes in its complexity any such rigid binary system:  let us not forget however that we have deliberately chosen a population of urban males with a normal health profile in 70% of cases.  On understands better in this way that more than half the patients do not mention any significant change in their eating habits, and that a third mention only a noticeable loss of appetite, associated with the onset of the sexual-asthenic syndrome.  Eight subjects attribute to it an unaccustomed slight increase in appetite.  It is important to note that the correlation between sleep and appetite is significant:  theses are the same subjects who, despite the alleged sexual troubles and state of fatigue that they indicate, continue to sleep and eat well.<P>

	d)  The functional problems not directly linked to sexuality also conform to this dichotomy:  fifty four subjects do not report any, and the forty six others mention minimal symptoms that illustrate a transitory somatization against a background of asthenia:  muscle spasms, cardiac arrhythmias, exertional dyspnea, dizziness and headaches, backaches, stomach pains, colitis and myalgias of the lower extremities.<BR>
	The wide range of complaints is not surprising, and one recognizes easily the loss of function due primarily to the increase in emotional tension;  the choice of organ systems on which the force of psychosomatic symptoms manifest themselves is clearly a "personal choice."  No single locus of symptoms is thus representative of psychosomatic drift of asthenia, and by virtue of this all symptoms	 are acceptable and significant.  Is this to say that the expression of a new symptom is necessary and sufficient to diagnose an aggravated asthenia?  No, an isolated somatization is without prognostic value.  On the other hand, its association with sleep disturbance and appetite is significant.<P>
	Of the one hundred patients studied, forty six indicated at the time, disturbances of sleep and a loss  of appetite; it is within this group, who show a greater incidence of more advanced complications of asthenia, that we find reported twenty two instances of a recent worsening of a psychosomatic complaint. On the other hand, it is very significant to note that the twenty eight subjects who describe themselves as only mildly or minimally  fatigued did not experience any alteration in sleep or appetite; and,  in twenty six cases, we find a complete absence of functional complaints.  On the strength of these elementary statistical correlations, it is possible to describe the study population as falling along a continuum according to the severity of the asthenia at the time of diagnosis, ranging from such a slight asthenia that the sexual problems represent the only reason for referral, to a genuine invalidism in which one's entire being is subjected to the same sort of pathogenic disturbance. <P>

	e)  The psychological problems brought to light in the diagnostic interview serve to reinforce this classification.  In fact, among the forty diagnosed with currently active psychological problems, we find the entire group of our twenty six sickest patients.  One notes ten cases of anxiety, six cases of psycho-asthenia, six reactive depressions and four cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder.<P>

	As for the other patients, without engaging in undue speculation, one finds a certain emotional fragility, an abnormal propensity to dramatize one's professional life, a tendency to reclusiveness, absence of a spouse, overwork, rivalry within the family... In sum, one could advance the idea that the common denominator or all these diagnoses as it refers to the subjectivity of these patients is on the order of a social maladaption.  This maladaption often becomes the object of concern of the treating physician, without the vicissitudes of daily life that serve as the point of contact with the physician being clearly stated, but the difficulties of communication with one's family, lack of self-confidence in the face of socio-professional competition, the weight of hierarchies, all overwhelm the personality and its defenses.  Finally, the exteriorization of these affective injuries achieve, with repetition, a form that is predetermined according to the intellectual structure of each individual in which we find again the abdications and strains, the pair that comprises anxiety and depression.<P>

<font size=+3><b>3) The Sexological Inquiry</b><p></font>

	The methodological difficulties in approaching the  erotic life of patients are considerable.  The methodological convenience that arises from the logic of the interview and clinical certitudes is totally negated by the invisibility of the symptoms.  The avowal does not make the symptom.  The invasive exploration of the corpora cavernosa does not illustrate the erection.  The divide between the surgical realities that inspire the urologist and the humility of the clinician who must listen to the which remains unsaid, is an irreconcilable one since the continuity between their observations is today known to be a delusion.<p>
	Certainly, in the clinical cases where one can prove a genital dysfunction due purely to physiological lesions which results in behavioral problems, the clinical side must take the lead in making prognostic evaluations; but, aside from the fact that such examples are rare in a male population in good general health and under fifty, hopes for a cure cannot reasonably center on anatomical repairs.<p>

	Since the degree of organic involvement in sexual dysfunction is difficult to approach- at least in the case of this sample- it is necessary from the beginning to accept the path laid out by the patient.  The verb is at the center of  the evaluations of these subjective representations.  Seven items however appear to serve as a rational set of markers of male sexuality:<p>

	<ul>
<li> the frequency of intercourse
<li> interpersonal communication
<li> desire
<li> morning erections
<li> the stability of the erection during intercourse
<li> the asthenia of the refractory period
<li> overall self-evaluation of the situation
</ul>


	a)  Frequency of intercourse is one of the few parameters of the inquiry that can resist trickery and dissimulation (does not the counter-visit of the partner tend to correct this?), even though arithmetic does not have the force of law in sexology for two reasons:  the interview borrows the lay term "sexual relations" whose ambiguity favors simulations.  The very real weight of social conventions also sets a norm, which patients do not wish to deviate from.<p>

	In this study, 90% of patients indicated a severe disruption of normal coital frequency.  In twenty eight cases, there had not been any sexual activity for more than six months, and for eighty other subjects, the average frequency of initiation of erotic activity for  the previous twelve months was three of fewer times per month.  The remainder of the patients in this sample, for the same twelve month period, reported three to six sexual acts per month. <p>

	One notices at once that, whether or not it is the immediate reason for seeking medical help, the progressive nullification of erotic behavior poses a serious prognostic problem in terms of the burden it places on the couple's relationship.  It is this abdication of the conjugal relationship that will thwart any attempts at a cure that only address the male dilemma: this abdication is the keystone to restoring the balance, for the practitioner must be prepared, should the occasion arise, to deal with this sense of resignation.<p>

	b)  Emotional understanding and communication between the couple provides for them the only relief, by defining the dividing line between a sex life left progressively and deliberately to go fallow, and a conjugal intimacy twisted by dysfunctions and intolerable stretches of emptiness.  A rule of conduct for the interviewer deserves to be recalled: the information gathered in the interview cannot constitute a basis for diagnostic and prognostic evaluation without being compared with the previous situation.  To put it differently, if the misunderstanding predates the onset of the current clinical picture, it is no longer possible to analyze the cause and effect relations with the asthenia.  Thus, of the eighty seven patients who live as couples, either in a stable manner or in a more or less itinerant manner for at least six months, exactly 50% state that they have maintained good communication with their partner, despite the onset of the difficulties in question, while the other 50% assert that communication has been severely degraded.<p>

	c)  Sexual desire is the most robust parameter of the interview.  The distance between one's subjective viewpoint and his various modes of behavior is considerable, since the number and strength of the inhibitory barriers that structure the emotional life can alter it in so many ways.  Loss of desire thus plays the role of a loudspeaker for depression, hatred or an appeal for help...<p>

	More than 50% of patients describe a decrease in motivation, and additionally sixteen have lost their appetite for sex; thirty eight on the other hand indicate no manifestation of asthenia as regards the usual manifestations of their sexual appetite.  In total, asthenia and/or perturbations of the sex life  seem clearly to disrupt desire in the two levels of cases in our series.<p>

	d)  Morning erections require little comment.  Their diagnostic significance is well known; its review here allows us to separate out the cases of impotence closely linked to a chronic or evolving pathology, and those due to sequelae of the iatrogenic effects of drug treatment.  One remark however: in the manner of psychometric tests that end up being fooled by subjects too familiar with their protocols, certain patients who wish to have their impotence evaluated exclusively in organic terms - the advantage of a reduction in personal questions is evident - will deny having observed morning erections, or will minimize their frequency.  In this regard, clinical experience allows us to expect that 10% of patients will present with such a determination, a percentage that is found again here, since irregular and unstable morning erections are cited by nine patients.<p>

	Do these nine more serious cases belong to the group of twenty six patients identified as being at the worst level of psychosomatic dysfunction?  Not at all.  The major complaint of this "group of 26" is centered on the fading of desire, and erection is not their principal concern: they all respond that morning erections are normal.  The nine histories in question share other features in common: seven of the nine reveal a symptomatic triad including poor interpersonal communication, inhibition of desire, and of course the symptom of infrequent morning erections.<p>

	e)  Stability of the erection during intercourse.  This item constitutes the major axis of the study since it was the reason for 80% of the referrals.  It is also the item that offers the most pertinent clinical indications to appreciate the specificity of the problem and its evolution with treatment.  We cannot fall back on the imprecision of the term impotence;  to allow for greater semantic precision, we must at least distinguish between instability of erections during the "foreplay" stage of lovemaking, and its weakness occurring only during intercourse.  The first case is less likely to be related to the practitioner as a complaint,  the second on the other hand constitutes a significant motive for consultation since the loss of an erection causes an unwelcome interruption of relations, with all the complications that entails.  It is to avoid the reef of this imprecision that this work selects exclusively the blockages of sexual conduct, and not all the vicissitudes more or less secondary to emotional vacillations.<p>

 	In sum, the male population studied here presents a certain homogeneity since, in all cases, the clinical history develops into a handicap that is gravely disabling for the couple in rendering coitus unattained or impossible.<p>

	f)  The asthenia of the refractory period - could it also constitute a criteria for exclusion in the same category as stability of the erection during coitus?  To put it differently, concerning patients found to be asthenic on the occasion of a sex therapy consultation, must one consider asthenia following ejaculation as necessary to confirm the diagnosis?  In reality, a more or less disabling degree of fatigue always occurs immediately after ejaculation, and its vividness, one's tolerance for it, its ability to provoke anxiety are not universal.  Everything depends first of all on the age of the subject, but also on his experience and motivation, before being modulated by psychological considerations.<p>

	It is thus remarkable that we find twelve patients who do not report regularly experiencing a phase of exaggerated fatigue following intercourse, although their histories reveal a perfect coherence in their complaints of instability of the erection and the weakening of libido.  Overall, it is more accurate to consider fatigue in the refractory period as a parameter for prognostic evaluation of contamination between problems of a sexual order and the subjective expression of asthenia.<p>

	g)  Self-evaluation of problems.  As a general rule patients suffering from erectile dysfunctions are exaggeratedly severe concerning their own unfitness; it is important to remember that some will lay traps for the practitioner to make the case for an organic cause.  Along with asthenia, erectile problems and the faltering of desire lack, despite all efforts, the function of this sort of theatrical appeal, and, all things considered, this is understandable since in some sense to speak of fatigue is to make it real.  Thus, we should not be surprised to find that their current problems are of little seriousness, and at the other extreme only  six describe them as "very serious."  So the majority of them suffer in silence, with resignation, hampered by a fatigue that takes away even their pessimism.<p>



		<center><h3>Results</h3></center>
	
 	<b>a)  Testor-plus and the Psychosomatic Realm</b><p>

	<ul>
<li>Concerning fatigue, sixty two patients out of ninety four (six eventually left the study) described themselves as less fatigued, but thirty two did not feel that there had been any change.
<li>	  Concerning sleep, the opposite is true; eighteen patients relate an improvement in the quality and quantity of sleep, while the rest did not notice any positive change.
<li>	  Appetite was only improved in eight instances, while the rest noticed no change.
<li>	  Of the forty six subjects presenting with functional problems of a non-sexual nature, twenty considered them to be partially or completely relieved.
<li>	  As regards the psychic perturbations reported, the commentaries gathered at the end of the study did not show any significant incidence of benefits from treatment on the psychopathology of these "aggravated" asthenias.
</ul>


	<b>b)  Testor-plus and Sexual Problems</b>
	<ul>
<li>Frequency of intercourse was significantly increased for sixty two couples, versus thirty two who did not note any change in the rhythm of their intimate life and remained in their state prior to treatment.
<li>	  Improvement in communication was only noted by fourteen out of forty six; thus two thirds of patients still describe a severe disruption of dialog a month after their first consultation.
<li>	  Thirty two patients indicate a strengthening of their libido, out of forty six cases of weakening of desire revealed at the beginning of the study; for the others their was no change noted in the realm of motivation.
<li>	  In twelve cases, morning erections were said to be improved at the end of the study.
<li>	  The stability of erection during intercourse was said to be re-established in fifty two cases out of the ninety four cases comprising this study.
<li>	  Post-coital asthenia affected 88% of patients;  forty said that by the end of the study they were less exhausted by the psychological inhibition of the refractory period.
<li>	  Self-evaluation of problems, finally is unchanged at thirty days for 50% of patients, as opposed to forty six improved overall, in terms of more indulgent and optimistic appraisals.
</ul>


		<center><h3>Discussion</h3></center>

	Every clinical study realized with the participation of an urban population raises the problem of weak case effects in each diagnostic category, and we have not been spared from this.  In order to palliate this handicap we have taken the position of emphasizing the commentaries concerning the two extreme groups in our population and side-stepping the intermediate group in which the results of treatment are less statistically significant.  It is the synthesis of the correlations within these two groups of cases which must serve as a last resort to show us the optimal range of indications for the prescription of Testor-plus in male sexual dysfunctions associated with asthenia.<p>

	In effect, an overall examination of the results derived from the eleven items of the study gives rise to two hypotheses:<p>

	  <ul>
<li>The first is familiar and concerns the weakness of responses when the collection of data comes solely from the verbal statements and subjective evaluations, on the part of patients as well as researchers.  We have decided here however that the correlations within the extreme groups are strong enough to validate the data.
<li>	  The second in unavoidable, resulting from the placebo effect, and is inevitably more pronounced in questions relating to intimacy.  If it is not possible to avoid the presence of artifacts in the results, we can at least minimize them by only allowing in our final discussion the items that are consistent with the most significant variations seen at the end of the study.
</ul>



	<b>1)  Results among astheno-dependent patients</b><br>
	In this series of twenty six patients with common sexual asthenia, without overt signs of psychosoma	tic involvement, treatment was effective in 100% with asthenia, 85% with diminished libido, 90% with instability of erection during coitus and in twenty out of twenty six with pessimism in self-evaluation.  Overall, the scores corresponding to weekly frequency of relations, vicissitudes of communication within the relationship and asthenia during the refractory period were not significantly affected.<p>

	The least optimistic interpretation would be the following: Testor-plus lifts the inhibition of erection in common asthenia and re-establishes the free circulation of sexual desire.  Treatment does not influence the content or the modalities of communication between the partners, and one could add that this fact helps support the authenticity of the reported results, since the contrary would be astonishing.  In addition, 60% of patients maintain the same monthly rhythm of erotic activities and - the two parameters being closely linked in terms of physical involvement and profitability of behavioral experience - the same unfortunate but inevitable degree of post-coital fatigability.<p>

	<b>2)  Results in the psycho-asthenic group</b><br>

	The therapeutic efforts made here are first and foremost centered on the amelioration of symptoms of psychosomatic origin and, from the sexological point of view, on the recovery of a minimum of sexual activity, the rekindling of desire, and the minimization of the asthenia of the refractory period.<p>

	If fatigue is considered to be decreased for sixteen of the twenty patients in this series, it is indeed the only sign modified by treatment, since neither sleep disturbance, loss of appetite nor any of the other psycho-somatic symptoms are ameliorated by treatment.  The most significant index of the resistance of these symptoms of psychological abdication is the stability of the sleep disturbance which Testor-plus is unable to vanquish.<p>

	Regarding complaints of an erotic nature, no single item showed a statistically significant improvement by the end of the study.  The frequency of relations was unchanged in 3/4 of cases, libido only improved in half (which is within the limits of placebo effect), but above all erectile function was not recovered.<p>
 
	Overall, the optimal indications for Testor-plus involve patients who present with an asthenic state of recent onset which has not contaminated the general state of health or the psyche, but nonetheless is affecting sexual function.  The more involvement there is of psychosomatic signs and symptoms, the less efficacious the treatment, to the point of no longer being desirable in patients diagnosed with true psychological instability.  These reservations are intended to restrict to the most appropriate patient population a botanical medication whose effectiveness remains by definition selective, a finding notably demonstrated by this ambulatory study.  The interest in such a product is not diminished by this, since the relevant category of men with functional sexual asthenia without biological overtones represents more than two thirds of the fatigue states presenting to the generalist.<p>


		<center><h3>Conclusions</h3></center>

	The frequency in everyday practice of the association of psychosomatic problems attributable to a transient asthenia and a functional deficit in male sexuality does not simplify the problem of diagnosis.  These difficulties arise in an acute fashion with the problem of using prescription medications as palliatives in patients who are otherwise in good general health.<p>

	Relying on the traditional use for similar indications of a plant that grows in the Amazon, Ptychopetalum olacoides or "Muira Puama," the product Testor-plus could represent a botanical therapeutic alternative without risk of side effects.<p>

	Mitigating the iatrogenic risks of routine prescription drugs or the covert use of fraudulent products, Testor-plus also has the advantage of not masking, since its mode of action remains very controlled, either an organic diagnosis that might unfortunately be missed, or a grave deterioration of the marital relationship that might not have been elicited.<p>

	In our current state of knowledge about human sexuality, and faced with the more and more frequent presentation to the practitioner of patients with sexually related complaints, Testor-plus could constitute a first-line treatment.<p>

Conformational analysis of antileukemic tropoloisoquinoline alkaloids isolated from Cissampelos pareira was conducted by thermodynamic proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) studies.

Abstract<br>
Bisbenzylisoquinoline (BBI) alkaloids are anti-inflammatory constituents of plants of the families <b> Menispermaceae</b> and Ranunculaceae, which have been used as folk remedies in Japan and China. Five BBI alkaloids (cepharanthine, chondocurine, cyclea
nine, isotetrandrine and tetrandrine) were tested for suppressive effect on in vitro nitric oxide (NO) production by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, which were induced with thioglycollate or bacillus Calmette-Guerin in mice. All the
se BBI alkaloids significantly suppressed NO production at 5 micrograms/mL. Cepharanthine, isotetrandrine and cycleanine were slightly more inhibitory than tetrandrine and chondocurine. The suppression persisted for at least 48 hr. As NO is one of the critical mediators in inflammation, these results may explain some aspects of the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of BBI compounds. <p><HR>

From 52 plants screened for antifungal activity, 26 (50%) were active against dermatophytes. This paper reports further evaluation of seven American plants against four pathogenic fungi (Aspergillus flavus, Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton rubrum), the part showing most activity, the best solvent and, in three cases, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the fungus in pure culture. Antifungal activity was confirmed in all of the plants, but not all parts; the most active parts were the bark and leaves. The most active species were Byrsonima crassifolia, Cassia grandis, Gliricidia sepium and <B>Malpighia glabra</B>. Diphysa robinioides, Rhizophora mangle and Cassia occidentalis were less
active. The most susceptible fungi were E. floccosum and T. rubrum; A. flavus was not
susceptible. Ethanol was usually the best solvent and the MIC of C. grandis, C.  occidentalis and D. robinioides was 50 micrograms/ml. <P><HR>

were treated with Cynarin, the 1,5-dicaffeyl ester of quinic acid, the constituent of the
artichoke (Cynara scolymus). The dose tested was 250 mg and 750 mg daily. The mean
 serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were not significantly changed within 3  months. Cynarin, administered per os, has no hypolipidaemic effect in familial Type II
  hyperlipoproteinaemia.<P><HR>

     The state of research on plants used in traditional medicine and its development in Egypt is indicated by the number of scientific institutions devoted to this problem: Universities, the  National Research Centre, the Desert Institute and the Horticulture Department of the  Ministry of Agriculture. Moreover, the use of certain medicinal plants has been "industrialised',   e.g., Ammi visnaga, Cymbopogon proximus, Nigella sativa and Aloe vera. Other plants are  under investigation: Urginea maritima, Phytolacca americana and Euphorbia sp. (known for its claimed antitumour properties), Glycyrrhiza glabra, <B>Cynara scolymus</B> and Solanum laciniatum.<P><HR>

<b><a name="AL1">Flavonoids as antioxidants evaluated by in vitro and in situ liver chemiluminescence. </a></b><br>
Fraga CG; Martino VS; Ferraro GE; Coussio JD; Boveris A <br>
Biochem Pharmacol 36: 717-20 (1987) <br>
Abstract<br>
Administration of eriodyctiol and (+)-catechin (10 mg/100 g of body weight) to mice inhibited the enhancement of in situ liver chemiluminescence produced by CCl4 (0.5 ml/100 g) by 32 and 38% respectively. 3,4-Dicaffeoylquinic acid was less effective (13%
), and cynarin had no effect. Previously, these compounds and other polyphenols were assayed as in vitro antioxidants by their abilities to inhibit the tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH)-initiated chemiluminescence of mouse liver homogenates, and the IC50
 (microM) values were as follows: (+)-catechin, 3; eriodyctiol, 9; myricetin and 4,2',4'-trihydroxy-6'-metoxychalcone, 15; 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 20; isochlorogenic acid, 30; caffeic acid, 5,6,3'-trihydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxyflavone and cynarin, 50; chlorogenic acid and apigenin, 150; quercetin, pedalitin, sylimarin and quercetin-3-methyl ester, 200; 7,4'-dihydroxy-5-methoxyflavonone and kaempferol-3,7-dirhamnoside, 500; quercitrin, 900; and galangin-3-methyl ether, genkwanin, hesperidin, ombuoside, phloridzin, quinic acid, rhoifolin, rutin and sophoricoside, greater than 1 mM. The in vitro and in vivo effects of these flavonoids and polyphenols may be related to their antioxidant abilities, making them promising substances to be investigated as water-soluble protectors against lipid peroxidation and other free radical-mediated cell injury. <p>

Institute for Pharmaceutical Biology, University of Dusseldorf, Germany.<br>
Planta Med 61: 435-8 (1995) <br>
Abstract<br>
To gain more insights into structure-activity relationships, four 3',4'-dihydroxyflavonols differing in the substitution of the A and C rings and 1,5-dicaffeolyquinic acid were evaluated for their ability to inhibit chemiluminescence of human neutrophils
 stimulated with opsonized zymosan or FMLP as wellas  in an enzymatic system with H2O2 and horseradish peroxidase. It could be shown that an additional o-dihydroxy structure in the A-ring, or a 6-methoxy group, respectively, has no significant influence,
 thus confirming the o-dihydroxy group of the B-ring as the most important structural feature for the radical scavenger activity. It can be supposed that the main effect of the tested flavonols is based on their inhibition of myeloperoxidase, besides inhibition of enzymes involved in activating the NADPH-oxidase, and a direct reaction with oxygen radicals. Inhibition of chemiluminescence by 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid was in the same order as those observed with the flavonols. <p><HR>


<a name="AL3"><b> Structure-activity relationship of caffeic acid analogues from Cynara on xanthine oxidase inhibition.</b> </a><br>
Chan WS; Wen PC; Chiang HC <br>
School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, R.O.C. 
Anticancer Res 15: 703-7 (1995) <br>
Abstract<br>
Caffeic acid has been reported to have activity on xanthine oxidase inhibition which is related to several diseases, e.g. gout, hepatitis and tumors. Based on this study, the alpha, beta-unsaturated COOH moiety in the molecule of caffeic acid plays a very important role on the xanthine oxidase inhibition because hydrocaffeic acid was inactive and the activities of coniferyl aldehyde and coniferyl alcohol were reduced as compared with ferulic acid. Moreover, chlorogenic acid showed a weaker activity than
 caffeic acid. On the other hand, the phenolic OH group present in the molecule of caffeic acid makes an important contribution to the activity, e.g. transcinnamic acid in which the absence of the phenolic OH group in the structure reduced its activity as compared with caffeic acid. Ferulic acid, isoferulic acid and 3,4-dimethoxy cinnamic acid also had reduced activity due to the methoxy groups replacing the phenolic OH group in the structures. However, m-coumaric acid displayed the strongest activity (IC50 = 63.31 microM) and induced uncompetitive inhibition with respect to the substrate xanthine (Ki = 21.568 microM). Caffeic acid (IC50 = 74.6 microM) showed the second strongest activity, followed by p-coumaric acid (IC50 = 111.09 microM). <p>

This study focused its attention on four medicinal plants (Carapa guianensis, Elephantopus scaber, Piper umbellatum, Stachytarpheta cayenensis) used by Caboclo communities on  Marajó, the main island of the Amazon delta. In the field, interviews were conducted with  Caboclos and the medicinal usages and preparation procedures of the four plants were  recorded. In the laboratory, the plant extracts were subjected to bioassays and their crude  chemical composition was established. All four plants showed significant bioactivity and the chemical tests confirmed the presence of bioactive compounds. In addition, the results of both  the field and laboratory studies corresponded well with those of a literature search. The ethnopharmacological significance of the four plants is discussed. <P><HR>

Suitable drugs for the elimination of adult Onchocerca volvulus are still needed since ivermectin, the new microfilaricide, appears to be ineffective against this parasite stage. Herein we report on the identification of filaricides in three medicinal plants. The compounds carapolide A, mexicanolide-methylangolensate mixture from Carapa procera and oliverine from Polyalthia suaveolens or Pachypodanthium staudtii when tested at 10-100 micrograms.ml-1 were found to exhibit considerable microfilaricidal activity after 24 hours of   incubation. Oliverine was found to be filaricidal when tested against adult female worms at 100 micrograms.ml-1. Preliminary toxicity studies in mice showed carapolide A and the  mexicanolide-methylangolensate mixture to be relatively non-toxic, whereas, oliverine had a  minimal lethal dose of 8 mg.Kg-1 of body weight. Based on the above results further  pharmacologic studies are recommended to determine, the potential application of the active  compounds on the treatment of onchocerciasis. <P><HR>

Many traditional ointments are utilized in Senegal because of their local effects. We report the  case of a new born girl deeply burned by the application of "Touloucouna" (Carapa Procera)  on her skin. The berries of the tree contain cyclic terpens (Meliacine) well known for inducing  inflammation by contact with the skin. They are most likely responsible for that burn until now,  such injuries have never been described with Touloucouna.<P><P><HR><P>

On several occasions, many Latin American countries have shown interest in the economic      potential of industrializing the exploitation of the pigment in Annatto seed (Bixa orellana, L)      used as a natural coloring agent in the food industry. Production of the pigment leaves the   seed as a by-product, which once characterized chemically and nutritionally, could contribute  to a more profitable exploitation of Annatto seed. The main objective of the present study was to obtain information in regard to this matter. The results of chemical analyses of the seed  showed a relatively high amount of protein, which fluctuated between 13 and 17%. Crude fiber levels were also high, about 16%; however, more than 50% of this fiber can be  eliminated through sifting of the seed flour. This operation also increases protein content. Annatto seeds have a high phosphorus and a low calcium content. Its protein contains adequate levels of tryptophan and lysine, but is low in methionine, isoleucine, leucine,  phenylalanine and threonine. The protein quality of Annatto seed flour was about 65% that of  casein, which was used as reference protein. Partly responsible for this low biological value are the amino acid deficiencies, mainly that of methionine, and the low digestibility of the  protein. The latter was 57% as compared to 94% for casein, a finding which can be attributed  to the crude fiber content of Annatto seed flour, since partial elimination of the fiber resulted in  an increase in digestibility up to a value of 65%. In order to utilize more effectively this potential feedstuff in combination with other feeds, further studies should confirm the amino  acid deficiencies and digestibility of the Annatto seed protein. <P><HR>

Annatto seed (Bixa orellana, L.) contains colored pigments (bixin and orelline) on its outer surface which at present are currently used as coloring agents in the food industry. This seed  was analyzed, with and without the pigment--which was extracted by the vegetable oil  method--so as to establish the possible use of the extracted seed which nowadays is considered as waste. Different dehulling and defatting treatments were applied to the annatto seed in order to obtain a flour with a greater protein content, and to diminish its crude fiber level. The different flours were then subjected to proximate analysis; protein quality was determined by amino acid analysis, and toxicological factors, mineral and vitamin contents, fatty acid profile, breakdown potential by measurement of feed digestion in the rumen of fistulated goats, fiber fractions, and bacteriological determinations were also performed. A
protein content of 13.7% was determined in the seed without pigment, which increased to 14.8% with the dehulling and defatting procedures, thus reducing the crude fiber level from 14.4% to 6.5%. The results showed that the limiting amino acid is tryptophan. The toxicity level was found to be of no importance, and the vitamin and mineral content as well as the fiber fractions were very similar to those determined in cereals, but with a higher level of carotenoids. A satisfactory dry matter degradation index was obtained in the digestibility test done in ruminants. According to the above-mentioned results, it is possible to use this resource as a feed and, when mixed with other materials, as a food in human nutrition. <P><HR>

Annatto dye is an orange-yellow food coloring extracted from the seeds of the tree Bixa  orellana. It is commonly used in cheeses, snack foods, beverages, and cereals. Previously reported adverse reactions associated with annatto dye have included urticaria and  angioedema. We present a patient who developed urticaria, angioedema, and severe  hypotension within 20 minutes following ingestion of milk and Fiber One cereal, which  contained annatto dye. Subsequent skin tests to milk, wheat, and corn were negative. The  patient had a strong positive skin test to annatto dye, while controls had no response. The nondialyzable fraction of annatto dye on SDS-PAGE demonstrated two protein staining bands in the range of 50 kD. Immunoblotting demonstrated patient IgE-specific for one of these bands, while controls showed no binding. Annatto dye may contain contaminating or  residual seed proteins to which our patient developed IgE hypersensitivity. Annatto dye is a  potential rare cause of anaphylaxis. <P><HR>

The red powdery extract from the seeds of the annatto, Bixa orellana, is a well known food  colouring. In an oil suspension it is used as a folk remedy (bush tea) in the West Indies, for diabetes mellitus. Detailed investigations on this extract, yielded a methyl ester, trans-bixin,  molecular weight 394 and molecular formula C24H30O4. This purified substance was  demonstrated, in anaesthetised mongrel dogs, to cause hyperglycaemia. Concomitant electron microscopy of tissue biopsies, revealed damage to mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum  mainly in liver and pancreas. When dogs were fed on a diet fortified with riboflavin, there was  neither demonstrable tissue damage nor associated hyperglycaemia. These findings point to:  (i) the potential dangers of informal medications such as 'bush teas'; (ii) the possible role of  plant extracts/food additives in the development of diabetes mellitus especially in the  undernourished state. <P><HR>

An analytical method using either thin layer or liquid chromatography is proposed for the detection of 4 pigments (bixin, lycopene, canthaxanthin and beta-apo-8'-carotenal) that can be used fraudulently to intensify the natural color of products derived from red pepper  (oleoresins, paprika, paprika paste, etc.). Similarly, the addition of other colorant natural  products containing some of these pigments as major pigments (such as tomato for lycopene  and Bixa orellana seeds for bixin) can be detected. The method proposed can also be used to control the aforementioned pigments in their natural sources as well as in food products. <P>

Babassu (Orbignya phalerata), a palm-tree coconut fruit, mixed with mandioca (Manihot
utilissima) is the staple food of people living in the endemic goiter area of Maranhao in Brazil,  where goiter prevalence among schoolchildren was still 38% in 1986 despite an adequate iodine intake in most of the population. Therefore, the question arose as to whether or not the ingestion of babassu alone or mixed with mandioca contributed to the persistence of endemic goiter in this area of Brazil. In this investigation we examined the potential antithyroid effects of babassu and mandioca by means of in vivo studies in Sprague-Dawley rats, in vitro studies in porcine thyroid slices and using a purified porcine thyroid peroxidase (TPO) system. Samples of various edible parts of babassu and mandioca flour were homogenized and extracted in goitrogen-free water (GFW) for in vivo experiments, and in methanol (100 g/l), GFW or 0.06 mol/l phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for in vitro experiments. The edible parts of babassu produced significant in vivo antithyroid effects (p < 0.05- < 0.001) in rats on a high iodine     intake (14 micrograms I- day-1.rat-1), as well as distinct and reproducible antithyroid and anti-TPO activities in both in vitro systems, their action being similar to that of the
thionamide-like antithyroid drugs propylthiouracil and methimazole.(ABSTRACT

During a survey of 30 patients with chromoblastomycosis followed at the Hospital dos
Servidores do Estado do Maranhão, the authors observed in 2 (6.6%) patients with lesions on the buttock. This is an uncommon site for the initial lesions of chromoblastomycosis. There  is often a history of microtraumatism during the farming job hence the more frequent development of lesions in the lower limbs. Both patients had 10 years disease, with the presence of nodules and vegetant warty lesions in coalescent plaques on the right buttock. Etiologic diagnosis made through histopatologic and culture exams, with Fonsecaea pedrosoi  isolated. The epidemiological exposure of the patients, was suggested by the fact that both
worked as babaçu coconut cutters a common activity in Maranhão State. The relation
between this kind of professional activity and the development of infection merits for the  investigation. <P><HR>

Abstract<br>
Boldine is an alkaloid present in Peumus boldus (popularly called "boldo-do-chile" in Brazil) which has healing properties and is used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. The possible clastogenic effect of the drug was tested in vitro on human peripheral blood lymphocytes by evaluating the induction of chromosome aberrations and sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs). Cultures from different individuals were treated with boldine at concentrations of 10, 20 and 40 micrograms/ml of culture medium.
 The effect of the alkaloid was also tested in an in vivo assay using BALB/c mouse bone marrow cells. Boldine was administered to the animals by gavage at the concentrations of 225, 450 and 900 mg/kg body weight. Under the conditions used, boldine did not induce a statistically significant increase in the frequency of chromosome aberrations or SCEs in either test system. <p>

Abstract<br>
The aporphine alkaloid boldine, present in Peumus boldus (boldo-do-Chile) widely used all over the world, was tested for the presence of genotoxic, mutagenic and recombinogenic activities in microorganisms. This alkaloid did not show genotoxic activity with or without metabolic activation inthe SOS chromotest and Ames tester strains TA100, TA98 and TA102. It was not able to induce point and frameshift mutations in haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. However, mitotic recombinational events such as crossing-over and gene conversion were weakly induced in diploid yeast cells by this alkaloid. Also, boldine was able to induce weakly cytoplasmic 'petite' mutation in haploid yeast cells. <p>

Abstract<br>
Contractions evoked by noradrenaline (1 microM) or a depolarizing solution of 60 mM KCl were concentration dependently depressed by the aporphine alkaloids (S)-boldine and (R)-apomorphine in rat aorta. Both drugs had a greater inhibitory potency on the contraction elicited by noradrenaline. Dose-response curves for noradrenaline were shifted to the right in presence of (S)-boldine. (R)-Apomorphine acted by a complex mechanism at alpha 1-adrenoceptors and its inhibitory effect was irreversible. The conformational features of these alkaloids may explain their different behaviour at alpha 1-adrenoceptors. In Ca(2+)-free solution, the alkaloids inhibited the contraction evoked by noradrenaline but did not modify (apomorphine) or increase (boldine) the contractile response induced by caffeine. Both alkaloids interacted with [3H]prazosin binding and with the benzothiazepine binding site of the Ca2+ entry receptor complex but had no effect at the dihydropyridine binding site in the rat cerebral cortex. Both
drugs showed some selectivity as inhibitors of [3H]prazosin binding as opposed to [3H]d-cis diltiazem binding. (R)-Apomorphine slightly inhibited one of the two forms of the Ca(2+)-independent, low Km cyclic AMP-phosphodiesterase (type IV), whereas it did not have a significant effect on the other phosphodiesterase forms. (S)-Boldine had negligible inhibitory effects on all phosphodiesterase forms. The present study provides evidence that (S)-boldine and (R)-apomorphine have interesting properties as Ca2+ entry blockers (through the benzothiazepine receptor site in the Ca2+ channel) and at alpha 1-adrenoceptors. <p>

Abstract<br>
The naturally occurring antioxidant boldine and its di-methoxy analogue glucine, as well as the drug antioxidant probucol, all inhibit TPA-induced downregulation of gap junctional intercellular communication in WB-F344 rat liver epithelial cells in dose-
dependent manners. The compounds were essentially 100% inhibitory to the effect of TPA (10 nM) at 50 microM each. Analysis of the mechanism of the antitumor promotive action of these agents in vitro revealed that boldine and probucol (both at 10 microM)
totally inhibited the TPA-induced accumulation of intracellular oxidants. Additionally, boldine, glaucine, and probucol, each at 50 microM, inhibited TPA-induced translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) to the particulate fraction of the cells, with concomitant inhibition of TPA-induced hyperphosphorylation of gap junctional connexin 43 (cx43) and TPA-induced internalisation of cx43 protein from the plasma membrane of the cells. None of the compounds inhibited the binding of (3H)-PDBu to TPA-specific binding sites in the cells. The results indicate that antioxidant molecules, irrespective of structure, possess common antitumor promotive potential in this model of gap junctional intercellular communication. The data also indicate that the compounds may interfere with the promotive function of TPA, at least in part, by the destruction of oxidants within the cells. Xanthine oxidase was excluded as a major source of such intracellular oxidants because allopurinol (50 microM) did not significantly affect either the accumulation of oxidants in the cells or the downregulation of gap junctional communication in response to TPA. Taken together, these data also suggest that TPA-induced oxidants play a role in the translocation of  PKC to cellular membranes and it is at this level where the antioxidants may interfere in TPA-induced downregulation of gap junctional function. <p>

Abstract<br>
The antioxidative properties of the aporphines boldine, glaucine and apomorphine, and of the benzyltetrahydroisoquinolines (+/-)-coclaurine and (+/-)-norarmepavine were compared in the brain  homogenate autoxidation model. The IC50 values found lay in the 16-20 microM range for the aporphines and were 131.7 microM, and 79.3 microM for coclaurine and norarmepavine, respectively. These results indicate that the antioxidative capacity (AC) of these compounds is related to the presence of the biphenyl system rather than phenol groups. The non-phenolic glaucine inhibited the 2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane)(AAP)-induced inactivation of lysozyme with an IC50 value of 12 microM, while the corresponding values for the phenolic coclaurine and norarmepavine were 10 and 20 microM, respectively. N-Methylation of glaucine to its quaternary ammonium reduced its protective effect by two-thirds. This result suggests that a benzylic hydrogen neighbouring a nitrogen lone electron pair may be the key to the protective effect of non-phenolic aporphines. <p>

Arch Biochem Biophys, 235: 1, 1984 Nov 15, 254-66 <BR>
Abstract:<BR>
Ascaridole, an asymmetric monoterpene endoperoxide with anthelmintic properties, occurs asa major constituent (60-80%) in the volatile oil of American wormseed fruit (Chenopodium ambrosioides: Chenopodiaceae), and as a lesser component in the leaf pocket oil of the boldo tree (Peumus boldus: Monimiaceae). Determination of optical activity and chromatographic resolution of naturally occurring ascaridole, and several synthetic derivatives, showed that both wormseed and boldo produce ascaridole in racemic form. The biosynthesis of ascaridole from the conjugated, symmetrical diene alpha-terpinene (a major component of the oil from wormseed) was shown to be catalyzed by a soluble iodide peroxidase isolated from homogenates of C. ambrosioides fruit and leaves. The enzymatic synthesis of ascaridole was confirmed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry of the product, which was also shown to be racemic. Optimal enzymatic activity occurred at pH 4.0 in the presence of 2.5 mM H2O2 and 1 mM NaI. Soluble enzyme extracts were fractionated by gel filtration on both Sephacryl S-300 and Sephadex G-100, and were shown to consist of a
high-molecular-weight peroxidase component (Mr greater than 1,000,000, 30% of total
activity) and two other peroxidase species having apparent molecular weights of 62,000 and 45,000 (major component). Peroxidase activity was susceptible to proteolytic destruction only after periodate treatment, suggesting an association of the enzyme(s) with polysaccharide material. Ascaridole biosynthesis from alpha-terpinene was inhibited by cyanide, catalase, and reducing agents, but not by compounds that trap superoxide or quench singlet oxygen. A peroxide transfer reaction initiated by peroxidase-generated I+ is proposed for the conversion of alpha-terpinene to ascaridole. <P>

Abstract:<BR>
Dried hydro-alcoholic extract of Peumus boldus (Monimiaceae) has been evaluated for hepatoprotective, choleretic and anti-inflammatory effects in mice and rats, in order to validate or to invalidate traditional therapeutic indications. This extract exerted a significant hepatoprotection of tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced hepatotoxicity in isolated rat hepatocytes (in vitro technique) by reducing the lipid peroxidation and the enzymatic leakage of  LDH; this in vitro efficacy was reinforced by a significant hepatoprotection on CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in mice (in vivo technique), the plant extract reducing the enzymatic leakage of ALAT. Boldine, the main alkaloid of P. boldus appears to be implicated in this hepatoprotective activity. Choleretic effects, often mentioned in traditional indications, have not been confirmed in rats. Finally, significant and dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effects were obtained on an acute inflammatory process (carrageenan-induced edema test in rats). Boldine does not appear to be involved in such properties. <P>

Abstract:<BR>
An ethnobotanical survey was conducted among the Carib population of Guatemala in  1988-1989. In general terms, the sample surveyed possessed a relatively good standard of living. Results indicated that health services were utilized by the population, and that domestic  medicine, mainly plants (96.9%) was used by 15% of the population. One hundred and  nineteen plants used for medicinal purposes were collected, of which 102 (85.7%) could be  identified; a list of these together with the information provided for each plant is presented. The most frequently reported plants used as medicine are: Acalypha arvensis, Cassia alata, Cymbopogon citratus, Melampodium divaricatum. Momordica charantia, Neurolaena lobata,Ocimum basilicum, Petiveria alliacea and Solanum nigrescens. Most of these plants are found  in the region, but some are brought from the Highlands or outside of the country, such as  Malva parviflora, Matricaria chamomilla, Peumus boldus, Pimpinella anisum, Rosmarinus  officinalis and Tagetes lucida. This survey demonstrated that the Carib population of  Guatemala has survived in a transcultural environment of African and native Amerindian  beliefs.

Pharmacol Res, 29: 1, 1994 Jan-Feb, 1-12 <BR>
Abstract:<BR>
Boldo (Peumus boldus Mol.), a Chilean tree traditionally employed in folk medicine and recognized as a herbal remedy in a number of pharmacopoeias, mainly for the treatment of  liver ailments, has recently been the subject of increasing attention. Boldine, in particular, the major and most characteristic alkaloidal constituent of this plant species, now emerges as its  most interesting active principle from the pharmacological viewpoint. The recent  demonstration that boldine is an effective antioxidant in both biological and non-biological  systems has opened up the perspective of a broad range of uses in medicine and industry.  Given the toxicological data on this alkaloid, its antioxidative properties situate it as a  potentially useful substance in many disease states featuring free-radical related oxidative  injury. This review attempts to cover and discuss the studies conducted over the last four   decades on the chemical and pharmacological properties of boldo and its main constituent. <P>

Abstract:<BR>
Boldine, an antioxidant alkaloid isolated from Peumus boldus, exhibits a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activity in the carrageenan-induced guinea pig paw edema test with an oral ED50 of 34 mg/kg. Boldine also reduces bacterial pyrogen-induced hyperthermia in rabbits  to an extent which varied between 51% and 98% at a dose of 60 mg/kg p.o. In vitro studies carried out in rat aortal rings revealed that boldine is an effective inhibitor of prostaglandin biosynthesis, promoting 53% inhibition at 75 microM. The latter in vitro effect may be  mechanistically linked to the anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects of boldine exerted in  vivo.

Nutr Cancer, 21: 3, 1994, 203-12 <BR>
Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) is one of very few consumable products with exceptionally high levels of selenium. The mean selenium concentrations of two shipments of Brazil nut used in the present study were determined to be 16 and 30 micrograms/g. In contrast, most common foods contain much less selenium, from 0.01 to 1 micrograms/g. Previous research on selenium cancer chemoprevention invariably used a pure compound, whereas little information is available on the efficacy of selenium delivered naturally in a food form. This paper reports the results of two mammary cancer prevention experiments in the rat  dimethylbenz[a]anthracene model by continuous feeding of selenium-rich Brazil nut (processed to a smooth-textured nut material for mixing in the diet). A dose-dependent  inhibitory response was observed at dietary selenium concentrations of 1-3 micrograms/g.  Interestingly, Brazil nut was found to be just as powerful as sodium selenite, if not more so, at  similar levels of dietary selenium intake. Mammary cancer protection gland, and plasma. The  magnitude of tissue selenium accumulation was proportional to the amount of Brazil nut added to the diet. The nutritional biopotency of selenium in Brazil nut was also evaluated by the repletion of two selenoenzymes, glutathione peroxidase and type I 5'-deiodinase, in selenium-deficient rats. Supplementation with Brazil nut as the sole source of selenium produced an efficient gradient of enzyme restoration at 0.05-0.2 microgram/g of dietary  selenium. A parallel comparison with sodium selenite indicated that the selenium in Brazil nut and selenite selenium were equally bioactive. Although at this point it can only be inferred that the above biologic effects are likely to be attributable to the high selenium content of Brazil nut, there is persuasive evidence to suggest that the models under investigation are responding to the selenium rather than to the other components of Brazil nut. <P><HR>

Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa) natively contain very high concentrations of selenium. Since  dietary selenium, including Brazil nuts, have been associated with protection against tumor  development in laboratory animal studies, it was of interest to determine the selenium content of the nuts from different nut-growing regions of Brazil. In the work reported, 162 nuts from each of two regions (Acre-Rondonia and Manaus-Belem) were individually analyzed for selenium. The average +/- standard deviation and range of selenium concentrations in ppm, fresh weight for nuts from Acre-Rondonia and Manaus-Belem regions were, respectively,  3.06 +/- 4.01 (0.03-31.7) and 36.0 +/- 50.0 (1.25-512.0). The toxicology of Brazil nut consumption is discussed. <P><HR>

An abundant seed protein, which is exceptionally rich in the sulfur-containing amino acids,  methionine (18%) and cysteine (8%), is synthesized in Brazil nut embryos about 9 months after flowering. This sulfur-rich protein consists of two low-molecular-mass polypeptide components, a 9-kDa polypeptide and a 3-kDa polypeptide. The two-subunit polypeptides associate through disulfide linkage(s) to form a 12-kDa protein molecule. We have demonstrated through in vitro translation studies, using RNA from 9-month-old embryos, that the sulfur-rich protein is synthesized as a larger precursor polypeptide of 18 kDa. In addition,data from in vivo labelling studies of 9-month-old Brazil nuts suggest that there are two  intermediate precursors of the sulfur-rich protein, one of 15 kDa and another of 12 kDa. One of these precursors, the 12-kDa polypeptide, accumulates for a 2-month period in the  developing embryos. From these data we infer that at least three stepwise cleavages are  involved in the maturation of the sulfur-rich protein from its 18-kDa precursor. <P><HR>

Storage proteins of the albumin solubility fraction from seeds of Bertholletia excelsa H.B.K.  were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and their primary  structures were determined by gas-phase sequencing on intact polypeptides and on the  overlapping tryptic and thermolysin peptides. The 2S storage proteins consist of two subunits  linked by disulphide bridges. The large subunit (8.5 kDa) is expressed in at least six different  isoforms while the small subunit (3.6 kDa) consists of only one form. These proteins are  extremely rich in glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine and the sulphur-containing amino acids  cysteine and methionine. One of the variants even contains a sequence of six methionine  residues in a row. Comparison with known sequences of 2S proteins of other dicotyledonous  plants shows limited but distinct sequence homology. In particular, the positions of the  cysteine residues relative to each other appear to be completely conserved, suggesting that tertiary structure constraints imposed by disulphide bridges dominate sequence conservation. It has been proposed that the two subunits of a related protein (the Brassica napus storage protein) is cleaved from a precursor polypeptide [Crouch, M. L., Tenbarge, K. M., Simon, A. E. & Ferl, R. (1983) J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 2,273-283]. The amino acid sequence  homology of the Brazil nut protein with the former suggests that a similar protein processing  event could occur. <P><HR><BR><BR><BR><HR>

Abstract:<BR>
Pretreatment of mice with hot water and alkaline extracts of Catuaba casca (Erythroxylum catuaba Arr. Cam.) effectively protected them from lethal infection of Escherichia coli and  Staphylococcus aureus. The extracts significantly inhibited both the human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV)-induced cytopathic effect and the expression of HIV antigen in HIV-1HTLV-IIIB or HIV-2ROD infected human lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1)  positive MT-4 cells. The 50% effective concentrations of the active fractions (21-263 micrograms/ml) were 1/4 - 1/43 of their 50% cytotoxic concentrations. Their anti-HIV activity was shown to be induced, at least in part, via the inhibition of HIV adsorption to the cells.

A systematic search for solasodine, an important starting material for the partial synthesis of steroidal hormones as well as other potentially bioactive constituents of various Solanum species of Brazil has been undertaken. Thus, the fruits of S. paludosum, S. asperum, <B>S. sessiliflorum</B> and Solanum sp. were found to contain significant amounts of solasodine. The  root bark of S. paludosum which showed curare like activity yielded tomatidenol and another  yet unidentified alkaloid responsible for the biological activity. The fruits of S. asperum yielded  a new spirosolane alkaloid, solaparnaine. The stem bark of S. pseudo-quina showed     convulsive and excitatory activity from which (25S)-isosolafloridine was identified as the  active principle. In addition, the latter alkaloid was also found to show antimicrobial activity. <P><HR>

The repellent effect of the molluscicides Niclosamide (Bayluscide WP 70), Anacardium  occidentale and the latex of Euphorbia splendens on Biomphalaria glabrata was observed through the investigation of the occurrence of escape behavior among molluscs that were  exposed to dosages lower than the LD 50. The total number of individuals out of water  among the surviving snails in the control group provided a "Natural Escape Index". The  comparison between this total and the total number of surviving snails in each group exposed  to the different dosages of the molluscicides after 24 hr provided the "Molluscicide Escape  Index" and the detection of a "Repellency Range" to these snails. The escape indexes for  Niclosamide, A. occidentale and E. splendens were 10%, 6.22% and 6.44% respectively.  Repellency occurred at the following concentration ranges: 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 ppm Bayluscide, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 ppm A. occidentale and 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20 ppm E.  splendens.

Abstract<br>
Anacardic acids, 2-methylcardols, and cardols isolated from various parts of the cashew [Anacardium occidentale] (Anacardiaceae) fruit have been found to exhibit tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Kinetic studies with the two principal active compounds, 6-[8(Z),11(Z),14-pentadecatrienyl]salicylic acid and 5-[8(Z),11(Z),14-pentadecatrienyl]resorcinol, have indicated that both of these phenolic compounds exhibit characteristic competitive inhibition of the oxidation of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) by mushroom tyrosinase. <p><HR>

A mixture of tannins (hydrolysable and non-hydrolysable) obtained from the bark of  Anacardium occidentale L., on i.p. injection, demonstrated apparent anti-inflammatory activity  in carrageenan- and dextran-induced rat paw oedemas, cotton pellet granuloma test and adjuvant-induced polyarthritis in rats. At higher doses orally administered tannins also had  activity in carrageenan paw oedema and adjuvant arthritis experiments. The tannins i.p. also inhibited acetic acid-induced "writhing responses" in mice and were found to antagonise the  permeability-increasing effects in rats of certain mediators of inflammation and to inhibit the migration of leucocytes to an inflammatory site. While not appearing to act by the release of adrenal hormones, tannins may produce effects in a non-specific manner by their astringent properties on cell membranes thus affecting cell functions. The above results should be  considered while studying the anti-inflammatory actions of plant extracts which contain tannins.<P><HR>

Cashew kernel lipids from high-yielding varieties have been characterised. Neutral lipid  accounted for 96% while glycolipid and phospholipid accounted for the remaining 4%.  Triglycerides were very rich in unsaturated fatty acids (oleic and linoleic) while glycolipids  were rich in saturated fatty acids (lauric and myristic). Varietal difference was noticed with  respect to the composition of neutral and glycolipids. Composition of phospholipid did not differ among high-yielding varieties. <P><HR>

Twelve plants used for the traditional treatment of diabetes mellitus in northern Europe were  studied using normal and streptozotocin diabetic mice to evaluate effects on glucose  homeostasis. The plants were administered in the diet (6.25% by weight) and/or as decoctions or infusions in place of drinking water, to coincide with the traditional method of preparation. Treatment for 28 days with preparations of burdock (Arctium lappa), <B>cashew   (Anacardium occidentale)</B>, dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), elder (Sambucus nigra),  fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), guayusa (Ilex guayusa), hop (Humulus lupulus), nettle  (Urtica dioica), cultivated mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus),  sage (Salvia officinale), and wild carrot (Daucus carrota) did not affect the parameters of  glucose homeostasis examined in normal mice (basal plasma glucose and insulin, glucose  tolerance, insulin-induced hypoglycaemia and glycated haemoglobin). After administration of streptozotocin (200 mg/kg) burdock and nettle aggravated the diabetic condition, while  cashew, dandelion, elder, fenugreek, hop, periwinkle, sage and wild carrot did not significantly affect the parameters of glucose homeostasis studied (basal glucose and insulin,  insulin-induced hypoglycaemia, glycated haemoglobin and pancreatic insulin concentration).  Guayusa and mushroom retarded the development of hyperglycaemia in streptozotocin  diabetes and reduced the hyperphagia, polydipsia, body weight loss, and glycated haemoglobin. Mushroom also countered the initial reduction in plasma insulin and the  reduction in pancreatic insulin concentration, and improved the hypoglycaemic effect of exogenous insulin. These studies suggest the presence of potentially useful antidiabetic agents  in guayusa and mushroom. <P><HR>

The molluscicide activity of hexanic extract from Anacardium occidentale L. (cashew) nut  shell, of copper (II) complex, of lead (II) complex and anacardic acid has been compared in  the laboratory in an attempt to obtain better stability than anacardic acid. This was obtained from the hexanic extract of the cashew nut shell by precipitation with lead (II) hydroxide or cupric sulfate plus sodium hydroxide or (II) cupric hydroxide followed by treatment of lead  (II) complex with a diluted solution of sulfuric acid. Ten products of the mixture obtained  were tested on adults snails of Biomphalaria glabrata at 1 to 10 ppm. The most active  products were copper (II) complex, obtained by cupric sulfate plus sodium hydroxide, and  anacardic acid (sodium hydroxide) which presented activity at 4 ppm. The anacardic acid's lead content was above the limits accepted by the United States standards. <P><HR>

The commercially available oil derived from the shell of cashew nut (Anacardium occidentale)   was tested for its potency in promoting the DMBA-initiated cells into papillomas in a murine   two-stage skin tumorigenesis model system. Male Swiss albino mice (9-10-weeks-old) were  assorted into different groups and treated topically with single sub-carcinogenic doses of   DMBA (50 micrograms in 0.1 ml acetone) followed by application of 1% and 2% shell oil in  acetone three times a week. Animals were sacrificed after 20 weeks from the commencement  of the experiment. The results imply a weak tumour promoting effect of cashew nut shell oil as  the mean tumour incidences were found to be 1.1 and 2.5 in 1% and 2% oil treatment  groups, respectively, while the corresponding figure vas 6.6 in the positive control group (DMBA and 1% croton oil in acetone). Few speculative mechanisms for the observed effect  of cashew nut shell oil on initiated skin are discussed. <P><HR>

B. sarothroides (desert broom)   was placed in an aqueous solution containing 500 ppm of T-2 toxin and showed visible signs  of toxicity on the twigs at 21 h after exposure but not at 6 h, indicating some resistance.  Samples of the twigs harvested 6 and 21 h after treatment contained, respectively, T-2 (0.03 and 2.2 micrograms/g), HT-2 (0.09 and 7.6 micrograms/g), and T-2-tetraol (2.1 and 2.6  micrograms/g). The hybrid FS1 showed no signs of toxicity 6 h after treatment, and its twigs  contained T-2 (0.8 micrograms/g), HT-2 (10.2 micrograms/g), and T-2-tetraol (10.8   micrograms/g). The leaves at 6 h contained 0.5 micrograms of T-2, 1.7 micrograms of HT-2,   0.01 microgram of 3'-hydroxy-HT-2, and 41 micrograms of T-2-tetraol per g.

The oleoresin from Brazilian Copaifera species yielded copalic acid and sesquiterpenes and showed marked anti-inflammatory activity using various experimental models in rats. The oleoresin significantly inhibited carrageenin-induced pedal edema following oral doses from  0.70 to 2.69 ml/kg, but was somewhat less effective than 50 mg/kg calcium phenylbutazone.  Repeated administration of the oleoresin at a dose of 1.26 ml/kg for a 6-day period reduced  granuloma formation with a response comparable to that of 20 mg/kg of calcium  phenylbutazone. This same dose of oleoresin also reduced the vascular permeability to  intracutaneous histamine. The LD50 value of the oleoresin in rats was estimated to be 3.79 (3.21-4.47) ml/kg.<P>

Abstract<br>
Isoflavones are natural plant phytoestrogens which have been shown to have anticancer proliferation, differentiation and chemopreventive effects. In order to determine structure-function requirements, we compared the effects of several isoflavone derivatives and one flavone on mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cell growth and differentiation. All chemicals tested are closely related in structure to genistein (4',5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), a known differentiation inducer and tyrosine protein kinase inhibitor. Genistein, daidzein (4',7-dihydroxyisoflavone) and genistin (7-glucoside of genistein) induced differentiation of MEL cells based on benzidine staining. Biochanin A (5,7-dihydroxy-4'-metho-xyisoflavone) and apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone) had no differentiation inducing effect. The potency of these chemicals on cell growth inhibition was apigenin > genistein > genistin > biochanin A > daidzein. These results suggest that the isoflavone structure and 4'-hydroxyl group are essential for the differentiation induction effect, whereas trihydroxyl derivatives are good growth inhibitors. Daidzein is a potent differentiation inducer with the least cytotoxic effect. <p><HR>

Abstract<br>
Treatment of human endothelial cells with cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or interferon-gamma induces the expression of specific leukocyte adhesion molecules on the endothelial cell surface. Interfering with either leukocyte adhesion or adhesion protein upregulation is an important therapeutic target as evidenced by the potent anti-inflammatory actions of neutralizing antibodies to these ligands in various animal models and in patients. In the present study we re
port that cotreatment of human endothelial cells with certain hydroxyflavones and flavanols blocks cytokine-induced ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin expression on human endothelial cells. One of the most potent flavones, apigenin, exhibited a dose- and time-dependent, reversible effect on adhesion protein expression as well as inhibiting adhesion protein upregulation at the transcriptional level. Apigenin also inhibited IL-1 alpha-induced prostaglandin synthesis and TNF-alpha-induced IL-6 and IL-8 production, suggesting that the hydroxyflavones may act as general inhibitors of cytokine-induced gene expression. Although apigenin did not inhibit TNF-alpha-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B(p50(NFKB1)/p65(RelA)) we found this flavonoid did inhibit TNF-alpha induced beta-galactosidase activity in SW480 cells stably transfected with a beta-galactosidase reporter construct driven by four NF-kappa B elements, suggesting an action on NF-kappa B transcriptional activation. Adhesion of leukocytes to cytokine-treated endothelial cells was blocked in endothelial cells cotreated with apigenin. Finally, apigenin demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenan induced rat paw edema and delayed type hypersensitivity in the mouse. We conclude that flavonoids offer important therapeutic potential for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases involving an increase in leukocyte adhesion and trafficking. <p><HR>

Abstract<br>
Flavonoids are pigments of edible plants. We have recently reported that most flavonoids induce G1 arrest in human cancer cells, and that genistein (an isoflavone) specifically inhibits their cell cycle at G2-M phase. In the present study, apigenin (a flavone) was found to inhibit the proliferation of B104 rat neuronal cells, and flow-cytometric analysis showed that apigenin arrested their cell cycle at G2-M phase. This effect was dose-dependent and reversible when apigenin was removed from the culture medium. Microscopic observation showed that apigenin did not significantly increase the mitotic index compared with the control. Further, apigenin induced morphological differentiation, that is, elongation and arborization of neurites in B104 cells. This is the first report to show that apigenin inhibited the proliferation of malignant tumor cells by G2-M arrest and induced morphological differentiation. <p><HR>

     Use was made of Wistar albino rats in which an inflammation was
     induced via the simultaneous injection of caraginan and prostaglandin
     E1 in order to evaluate the antiinflammatory activity of 6 freeze
     dried plant extracts. It was found that with such model of
     inflammation the inflammatory effect of caraginan was strongly
     enhanced, which was accompanied by the rapid and prolific white blood
     cell extravasates. The freeze-dried extracts of St. John's-wort
     (Hypericum perforatum L.), potmarigold calendula (Calendula
     officinalis L.), camomile (Matricaria chamomilla L.) and plantain
     (Plantago lanceolata L. et Pl. major L.) were found to suppress both
     the inflammatory effect and the leukocyte infiltration. The extracts
     of symphytum (Symphytum officinale L.) and those of flax seed (Linum
     usitatissimum L.) did not inhibit the inflammation, however, they
     suppressed the leukocyte infiltration at the 3rd and 4th hour of the

In the high Amazonian basin a plant named chuchuasha, (or chuchuaso) is used in traditional medicine for several purposes in the form of an alcoholic extract. This plant, a Maytenus species, most probably Maytenus laevis, grows in the subandean region of the Amazonian basin (Peru, Ecuador, Colombia). Antitumor and anti-inflammatory properties were recently attributed to the extracts of the root bark of the plant. The composition of the extract of M. laevis from the Putumayo area of Colombia was studied in order to establish the active principle responsible for these activities. The presence of phenoldienones (tingenone, 22-hydroxytingenone), a catechin (4'-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin) and proanthocyanidins (Ouratea-proanthocyanidins A and B) was established. The biological activities of these compounds confirm the properties of the extracts of the plant claimed by traditional medicine. <P><HR>

Eleven cases of patients bearing basic cellular carcinoma, and one case of patient bearing  Kaposi's sarcomatosis, all treated with antibiotics isolated by Goncalves de Lima and  Co-workers at the Instituto de Antibióticos, are presented by the authors. Primin, an antibiotic extracted from a vegetal named Miconia sp. (Herb. I.A.-1903) with a  2-metoxi-6-n-pentil-p benzoquinone structure, presented a strong antineoplastic action in the cases treated. Plumbagin isolated from Plumbago scandens in local use, was responsible for a complete healing of the injuries treated. Maytenin extracted from Maytenus sp. (Herb.I.A.-1750) showed less activity than the two previous mentioned, but with a low irritant action and late antineoplastic properties. The authors are going on these experiments. They believe that these antibodies, in local use, may advantageously substitute the surgery and the radiotherapy, meanly in those external ear tumidities and back of the nose, owing to a hurtful action in cartilage, provoked by radiotherapy. <P><HR>

Leaves of Maytenus species are used in the popular medicine of Brazil for their reported antacid and antiulcerogenic activity. The present work examined the effects of a boiling water  extract of equal parts of M. aquifolium and M. ilicifolia leaves on acute administration in rats  and mice, in an attempt to detect any general depressant, hypnotic, anticonvulsant and  analgesic effects. General depressant and hypnotic effects were seen only after intraperitoneal  administration. After chronic administration, the overall behavior of animals did not change  and they continued to gain weight at the same rate as controls. Several biochemical and  hematological parameters as well as pathological examination of different organs did not show any significant alterations after 3 months of treatment. A search for the potential effects of the extract on the fertility of female and male rats and on the course of pregnancy as well as a search for potential teratogenic effects did not reveal any significant differences from controls.
Taken together, the results indicate that these Maytenus species may be safe for human use and deserve further investigation. <P><HR>

Leaves of Maytenus species are commonly used in Brazil for the treatment of gastric ulcers, dyspepsias and other gastric problems. The present study evaluated the antiulcerogenic potential of a boiling water extract of equal parts of M. aquifolium and M. ilicifolia leaves against ulcer lesions induced by indomethacin and cold-restraint stress in rats. Ranitidine and cimetidine were used as reference drugs. The oral and intraperitoneal administration of the  extract had a potent antiulcerogenic effect against both types of ulcers. The extract was shown to cause an increase in volume and pH of gastric juice of the animals with the pH effects comparable to those of cimetidine. The results tend to confirm the popular use of the plant. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
The 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,3',4'-pentamethoxyflavone (artemetin) from Cordia verbenacea DC
(Boraginaceae) showed marked anti-inflammatory activity using various experimental models in rats. Artemetin significantly inhibited carrageenin-induced paw edema following oral doses from 30.4 to 153.9 mg.kg-1. The doses of 102.6 and 153.9 mg.kg-1 showed an inhibitory effect similar to that of 50.0 mg.kg-1 of calcium phenylbutazone. The ED50 value of artemetin in rats was estimated to be 67.07 mg.kg-1. Repeated administration of artemetin at doses of  67.07 mg.kg-1 for a 6-day period reduced granuloma formation with a response comparable to that of 20.0 mg.kg-1 of calcium phenylbutazone. This same dose of artemetin also reduced the vascular permeability to intracutaneous histamine. Sub-acute toxicological experiments indicated a very low toxicity.  <P><HR>

Folidago Microglossa DC, and Petiveria Alliacea. Concentrations of the elements Al, Br, Ca, Cl, Co, Cs, Fe, K, La, Mg, Mn, Na, Rb, Sb, and Zn have been determined in dried extracts of these herbs by short and long irradiations under a thermal neutron flux of 10(11)-10(13) n/cm2s in the IEA-R1 nuclear reactor. The NBS Tea Leaves (1572) and NIES Pepperbush (1) reference materials were analyzed simultaneously with the plant extracts. The results obtained in these analyses have shown a good accuracy and reproducibility of the method.  The relative errors and the relative standard deviations were less than 10% for most of the  elements analyzed.  <P><HR>

Topical application of the extract at a dose of 0.09 mg/ear in mice was clearly more effective than 1.0 mg/ear of naproxen in the reduction of the ear oedema induced by corton oil. At antiinflammatory doses, the extract showed an important protective effect on the gastric mucosa, reducing significantly the number of gastric lesions.  <P><HR>

Leaf preparations of several species of Cordia are used in traditional medicine as remedies for osteoarticular diseases. The analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activities in the rat of different extracts of C. francisci, C. martinicensis, C. myxa, C. serratifolia and C. ulmifolia leaves were studied. The results obtained showed that the petroleum ether and alcoholic extracts especially of C. francisci, C. myxa and C. serratifolia leaves have a significant analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activity in the rat. The flavonoids and phenolic derivative content of the five species of genus Cordia leaves was investigated by TLC and  determined by reversed-phase HPLC with an acetonitrile/water/acetic acid buffer solvent  gradient. UV detection was carried out at 255 and 280 nm. Four flavonoid glycosides, robinin, rutin, datiscoside and hesperidin, one flavonoid aglycone, dihydrorobinetin, two phenolic derivatives, chlorogenic and caffeic acid, were evidenced and determined.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
We assayed rheumatoid factor by instrumental latex particle counting. The calibration curve ranged from 12.5 to 500 int. units/mL. Maximal within- and between-assay CVs were 5 and 11%, respectively. Analytical recoveries ranged from 92.4 to 108%, and the relation between results and dilutions was linear in the range of 15 to 400 int. units/mL. Correlation with an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA, Cordia kit) was r = 0.934 (n = 58), with turbidimetry r = 0.825 (n = 100), and with the Waaler-Rose test r = 0.834 (n = 73). Of 260 blood donors, 95% gave a value less than 10 kilo-int. units/L, which was taken as the upper normal limit. In a population of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 47), 87.2% had rheumatoid factor  greater than 10 kilo-int. units/L. <P><HR>

Abstract<br>
We have examined the antiviral activity of the crude extract prepared from the root of Saussurea lappa Clarks, a Chinese medicinal herb which is widely used for many illnesses including cancer.  Two active components, costunolide and dehydrocostus lacton
e, were identified which show strong suppressive effect on the expression of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in human hepatoma Hep3B cells, but have little effect on the viability of the cells. Both costunolide and dehydrocostus lactone suppress
the HBsAg production by Hep3B cells in a dose-dependent manner with IC50s of 1.0 and 2.0 microM, respectively. Northern blotting analysis shows that the suppression of HbsAg gene expression by both costunolide and dehydrocostus lactone were mainly at the
 mRNA level.  Furthermore, the suppressive effect of costunolide and dehydrocostus lactone on HBsAg and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), a marker for hepatitis B viral genome replication in human liver cells, was also observed in another human hepatoma cel
l line HepA2 which was derived from HepG2 cells by transfecting a tandemly repeat hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA. Similarly, the mRNA of HBsAg in HepA2 cells was also suppressed by these two compounds. Our findings suggest that costunolide and dehydrocostus
 lactone may have potential to develop as specific anti-HBV drugs in the future. <p>

Abstract<br>
Aqueous extracts of seven species used in Brazilian popular medicine (Achyrocline satureoides, Iodina rhombifolia, Desmodium incanum, Baccharis anomala, Tibouchina asperior, Luehea divaricata, Maytenus ilicifolia) were screened to the presence of mutagenic activity in the Ames test (Salmonella/microsome). Positive results were obtained for A. satureoides, B. anomala and L. divaricata with microsomal activation. As shown elsewhere (Vargas et al., 1990) the metabolites of A. satureoides extract also show the capacity to induce prophage and/or SOS response in microscreen phage induction assay and SOS spot chromotest. <p><HR>

In the high Amazonian basin a plant named chuchuasha, (or chuchuaso) is used in traditional medicine for several purposes in the form of an alcoholic extract. This plant, a Maytenus species, most probably Maytenus laevis, grows in the subandean region of the Amazonian basin (Peru, Ecuador, Colombia). Antitumor and anti-inflammatory properties were recently attributed to the extracts of the root bark of the plant. The composition of the extract of M. laevis from the Putumayo area of Colombia was studied in order to establish the active principle responsible for these activities. The presence of phenoldienones (tingenone, 22-hydroxytingenone), a catechin (4'-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin) and proanthocyanidins (Ouratea-proanthocyanidins A and B) was established. The biological activities of these compounds confirm the properties of the extracts of the plant claimed by traditional medicine. <P><HR>

Eleven cases of patients bearing basic cellular carcinoma, and one case of patient bearing  Kaposi's sarcomatosis, all treated with antibiotics isolated by Goncalves de Lima and  Co-workers at the Instituto de Antibióticos, are presented by the authors. Primin, an antibiotic extracted from a vegetal named Miconia sp. (Herb. I.A.-1903) with a  2-metoxi-6-n-pentil-p benzoquinone structure, presented a strong antineoplastic action in the cases treated. Plumbagin isolated from Plumbago scandens in local use, was responsible for a complete healing of the injuries treated. Maytenin extracted from Maytenus sp. (Herb.I.A.-1750) showed less activity than the two previous mentioned, but with a low irritant action and late antineoplastic properties. The authors are going on these experiments. They believe that these antibodies, in local use, may advantageously substitute the surgery and the radiotherapy, meanly in those external ear tumidities and back of the nose, owing to a hurtful action in cartilage, provoked by radiotherapy. <P><HR>

Leaves of Maytenus species are used in the popular medicine of Brazil for their reported antacid and antiulcerogenic activity. The present work examined the effects of a boiling water  extract of equal parts of M. aquifolium and M. ilicifolia leaves on acute administration in rats  and mice, in an attempt to detect any general depressant, hypnotic, anticonvulsant and  analgesic effects. General depressant and hypnotic effects were seen only after intraperitoneal  administration. After chronic administration, the overall behavior of animals did not change  and they continued to gain weight at the same rate as controls. Several biochemical and  hematological parameters as well as pathological examination of different organs did not show any significant alterations after 3 months of treatment. A search for the potential effects of the extract on the fertility of female and male rats and on the course of pregnancy as well as a search for potential teratogenic effects did not reveal any significant differences from controls.
Taken together, the results indicate that these Maytenus species may be safe for human use and deserve further investigation. <P><HR>

Leaves of Maytenus species are commonly used in Brazil for the treatment of gastric ulcers, dyspepsias and other gastric problems. The present study evaluated the antiulcerogenic potential of a boiling water extract of equal parts of M. aquifolium and M. ilicifolia leaves against ulcer lesions induced by indomethacin and cold-restraint stress in rats. Ranitidine and cimetidine were used as reference drugs. The oral and intraperitoneal administration of the  extract had a potent antiulcerogenic effect against both types of ulcers. The extract was shown to cause an increase in volume and pH of gastric juice of the animals with the pH effects comparable to those of cimetidine. The results tend to confirm the popular use of the plant. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
The use of medicinal plants by the patients at the outpatient clinics of five health-care centers in Puerto Rico was evaluated. Medication histories were obtained for 802 patients ranging in age from two months to 91 years. The most frequent medical diagnosis was cardiovascular disease (54% of the patients). Respiratory and digestive disorders were the least frequent conditions, identified in only 9% and 6% of the cases, respectively. Medicinal plants were used by 57% of the population. Patients 65 years or older tended to use herbal remedies more often. Seven of the 11 most commonly used plants were used to treat gastrointestinal disorders. Other medicinal uses given were for sedation, sleep disorders, elevated blood pressure, kidney disorders, and respiratory ailments. The most frequently used plant was Citrus aurantium L. (sour orange), which was used as a sedative by 39% of the patients and for gastrointestinal disorders by 17%. Two potentially toxic plants, Solanum americanum and Annona muricata, were among the most commonly used plants. Medicinal plants were used widely by the outpatient population studied. Most herbs were used to treat self-limiting conditions but some were used to treat potentially serious medical problems, such as hypertension. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
The leaves of Annona muricata have yielded eight monotetrahydrofuran Annonaceous
acetogenins. Two of them, annomuricins A [1] and B [2], whose chemical structures were deduced by ms, nmr, ir, and uv spectral and chemical methods, are novel and unusual. Compounds 1 and 2 each possess five hydroxyl groups; two hydroxyl groups are vicinal, with the vicinal group of 1 threo and that of 2 erythro. The absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were determined by Mosher ester methodology. Six monotetrahydrofuran acetogenins, previously described in the seeds, were found in the leaves; these are gigantetrocin A, annonacin-10-one, muricatetrocins A and B, annonacin, and goniothalamicin. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
The leaves of Annona muricata have yielded the novel monotetrahydrofuran Annonaceous acetogenins, muricatocins A [1] and B [2]. Each compound possesses five hydroxyl groups, with two hydroxyl groups at the C-10 and C-12 positions. The absolute configurations of 1 and 2 (except for positions C-10 and C-12) were determined by Mosher ester methodology. The C-10, C-12 acetonides (1c, 2c) suggested relative stereochemistry and significantly enhanced cytotoxicity against the A-549 human lung tumor cell line. Three known monotetrahydrofuran acetogenins, annonacin A, (2,4-trans)-isoannonacin, and (2,4-cis)-isoannonacin, were also found. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Guaraná is considered an ideal crop for supplementing the incomes of small peasant farmers in the Amazon basin. A fast-growing perennial, guaraná can be planted in the midst of manioc crops, allowing the formation of extensive orchards in the place of regenerating scrub once the manioc has been harvested. Traditional forms of guaraná agriculture practised by the Saterê-Mawé Indians compare favourably with the plantation system favoured by government agronomists. Indigenous techniques of hand-processing guaraná are also shown to produce better quality in the finished product than those practices adopted by industrial concerns. A detailed comparison of two systems of production show the Indians' implicit concern to avoid oxidization of the phenolic compounds in the seed, since this leads to the guaraná becoming dark in colour, bitter in taste, and irritating to the gastrointestinal tract. The short-term medicinal effects of guaraná are commonly thought to result from a high content of caffeine and associated alkaloids, as well as from considerable amounts of tannin. Future research may well show that various saponins also play an important part in the drug's pharmacology, particularly with regard to its long-term influence as a general tonic and prophylactic. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
A reversed-phase high-performance liquid-chromatographic method for the determination of caffeine and theophylline in commercial guarana samples (drug obtained from the seeds of Paulinia cupana Kunth, Sapindaceae of the Amazon Region) and in Cola spp. samples is described and discussed. The methodology developed is simple and rapid with a minimum of samples preparation required. A comparison of five different techniques for the extraction of caffeine and theophylline is discussed. Furthermore the quantitative determination of caffeine and theophylline in five samples of Brasilian guarana, in two samples of dietetic products containing guarana, in two samples of Cola extract and in three of Cola seed powder are reported. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Aqueous extracts of guaraná were studied in terms of effects on the aggregation of human and rabbit platelets. Guaraná extracts have anti-aggregatory and de-aggregatory actions on  platelet aggregation induced by ADP or arachidonate but not by collagen. The active material was shown to be water soluble and heat resistant and appeared to be different from salicylates, nicotinic acid or known xanthines. Guaraná extracts inhibited platelet aggregation in rabbits following either intravenous or oral administration. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
The effects of an aqueous extract of guaraná (Paullinia cupana) on rabbit platelet aggregation and thromboxane synthesis were examined. The guaraná extract (100 mg/ml) and fractions separated by TLC (origin and xanthines) decreased platelet aggregation (37, 27 and 31% of control values, respectively) and platelet thromboxane formation from [14C]-arachidonic acid (78, 70 and 50% of control values, respectively). The decreased thromboxane synthesis could be responsible, at least in part, for the antiaggregatory action of guaraná. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Tannins are increasingly recognized as dietary carcinogens and as antinutrients interfering with the system's full use of protein. Nevertheless, certain tannin-rich beverages, masticatories, and folk remedies, long utilized in African, Asiatic, Pacific, and Latin American countries, are now appearing in North American sundry shops and grocery stores. These include guarana  (Paullinia cupana HBK.) from Brazil, kola nut (Cola nitida Schott & Endl. and C. acuminata Schott & Endl.) from West Africa, and betel nut (Areca catechu L.) from Malaya. The betel nut, or arecanut, has long been associated with oral and esophageal cancer because of its tannin content and the tannin contributed by the highly astringent cutch from Acacia catechu L. and Uncaria gambir Roxb. and the aromatic, astringent 'pan' (leaves of Piper betel L.) chewed with it. In addition to the constant recreational/social ingestion of these plant materials, they are much consumed as aphrodisiacs and medications. Guarana and kola nut enjoy great popularity in their native lands because they are also rich in caffeine, which serves  as a stimulant. Research and popular education on the deleterious effects of excessive tannin intake could do much to reduce the heavy burden of early mortality and health care, especially in developing countries. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Aqueous extracts of Paullinia cupana (guarana), a species that belongs to the Sapindaceae family, were analyzed for the presence of genotoxic activities in bacterial cells. The extracts of  guarana were genotoxic as assessed by lysogenic induction in Escherichia coli and they were also able to induce mutagenesis in Salmonella typhimurium. Addition of S9 microsomal fraction, catalase, superoxide dismutase or thiourea counteracted the genotoxic activity of guarana, suggesting that oxygen reactive species play an essential role in the genotoxicity of aqueous guarana extracts. The genotoxic activity in the extracts was related to the presence of a molecular complex formed by caffeine and a flavonoid (catechin or epicatechin) in the presence of potassium. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Tropical rain forests offer enormous prospects for the discovery of new drugs for use in  Western medicine. The Amazon supports 80,000 species of higher plants and a diverse  Indian population. Focusing attention on those plants used as medicines by indigenous  peoples is the most efficient way of identifying the plants that contain bioactive compounds.  There is an urgent need for more ethnobotanists and ethnopharmacologists to be trained to  document as much information as possible before it and the plants are lost through destruction of the rain forest and acculturation of the indigenous peoples. Ethnobotanical studies have  identified plants documented by early travellers; these include Paullinia yoco and Ilex guayusa  which are used as stimulants and have been shown to be rich in caffeine. Studies of the   hallucinogen prepared from Banisterioposis caapi have shown that the native people know which plants to add to the mixture to lengthen and intensify the intoxication produced by the beta-carboline alkaloids in the plant. Three major snuffs are used in the Amazonia; the plants from which they are derived have been identified. One of the snuffs also has antifungal and curare-like activities; chemical analysis on the active principles has not been done. Several  plants are considered as prime candidates for scientific study as sources of useful chemicals for medicine or industry. These include some used to prepare teas or other infusions for treatment of various symptoms of senile dementia.  <P><HR>

Herbarium and field specimens (over 300) of all of the Flacourtiaceae of New Caledonia were analysed for nickel in order to identify hyperaccumulators (greater than 1000 microgram/g dry mass) and to assess nickel accumulation in relation to the evolutionary status of 'nickel plants' of New Caledonia. One hyperaccumulator was identified in the genus  Lasiochlamys, ten among Xylosoma, one among Casearia and seven among Homalium. Although these Homalium nickel plants had previously been recorded, fresh data for these and other Homalium are presented. The remarkable tolerance of Flacourticeae to ultrabasic rocks is shown by the fact that 75% of the species are found on such substrates. The number of hyperaccumulators was greatest in the genera Xylosoma and Homalium. The  Flacourtiaceae are among the most primitive of all angiosperms and in common with other primitive hyperaccumulators, contain nickel as a complex with citric acid. The only advanced New Caledonian nickel plant (Psychotria douarrei) has most of its nickel bound with ligands other than citric acid, a feature of other advanced hyperaccumulators. It is postulated that nickel complexing with citric acid may be a primitive character. Most of the New Caledonian nickel plants belong to the order Violales of subclass Dilleniidae. It is suggested that hyperaccumulation of nickel is an evolutionary character which occurs in long-indisturbed floras such as that of New Caledonia. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Haitian empirical medicine sprang from both European (16th to 19th century) and African  (especially voodoo) traditional therapies. The use of medicinal herbs is highly developed. Our  purpose was to list the plants held to be antifertility agents in the island. We identified about  twenty species more or less currently used by the women as abortifacients or emmenagogues. The chemistry and active components of a few species are well-known. However, for most of them, some were partially studied, and no relation could be established between their chemical composition and their potential activities, and the rest are chemically unknown. We chemically screened extracts of Casearia ilicifolia, Eleutherine bulbosa, Rhoeo spathacea and Stemodia durantifolia, and identified flavonoids, triterpenes and sterols in the leaves of C. ilicifolia, and naphthoquinones, and a new anthraquinone,  anthracene-9,10-dione-1,5-diol-4-methoxy-3-methyl-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester, in the  bulbs of E, bulbosa. R. spathacea showed a stimulative activity on mouse uterus. Antifertility screening tests of C. ilicifolia and E. bulbosa showed activity in rats, but also probably toxicity. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
An ethanol extract of the leaves of Brazilian Casearia sylvestris, given orally, inhibited gastric secretion in pylorus-ligated rats. At a prophylactic dose of 57.5 mg/kg, the extract showed a reduction of gastric juice more effective than misoprostol (500 micrograms/kg). In reducing hydrochloric acid output, the extract was less effective than misoprostol, cimetidine (32.0 mg/kg) and atropine (5.3 mg/kg). With the extract, the pH of the stomach contents was not  significantly different from that of controls. Stress-induced lesions produced by restraint and water immersion were significantly prevented by the extract for all levels of severity when compared with the controls. The extract appeared more effective than misoprostol in suppressing light lesions, was equivalent to cimetidine and misoprostol for moderate lesions, and less effective than cimetidine and misoprostol for severe lesions. Toxicological experiments indicated a low acute toxicity, confirmed by subchronic daily testing. The oral LD50 value of greater than 1840 mg/kg was over 32 times higher than the antiulcerogenic ED50 (57.5 mg/kg). <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
We have observed that several plants used popularly as anti-snake venom show anti-inflammatory activity. From the list prepared by Rizzini, Mors and Pereira some species have been selected and tested for analgesic activity (number of contortions) and anti-inflammatory activity (Evans blue dye diffusion--1% solution) according to Whittle's technique (intraperitoneal administration of 0.1 N-acetic acid 0.1 ml/10 g) in mice. Previous oral administration of a 10% infusion (dry plant) or 20% (fresh plant) corresponding to 1 or 2 g/kg of Apuleia leiocarpa, Casearia sylvestris, Brunfelsia uniflora, Chiococca brachiata,Cynara scolymus, Dorstenia brasiliensis, Elephantopus scaber, Marsypianthes chamaedrys, Mikania glomerata and Trianosperma tayuya demonstrated analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory  activities of varied intensity. <P>

A review has been made of the ethnobotanical and pharmacological data of 43 medicinal plants of the tree-savannah used by the Diola against infectious diseases. The traditional use of ten plants can be explained by pharmacologically active principles: Adansonia digitata, Azadirachta indica, Carica papaya, Cassia tora, Fagara leprieurii, Guiera senegalensis, Khaya senegalensis, Mangifera indica, Psidium guajava and Voacanga africana. Four of these herbs are recommended for use in Primary Health Care. The therapeutic value of the other plants discussed is not absolutely clear. It is, however, obvious that herbal medicine has a large potential, which is still insufficiently explored, for utilization in Primary Health Care. <P><HR>

Studies were carried out on the suppression of both exploratory and spontaneous locomotor  activities in the mouse by a non-polar fraction from a methanol extract of the dried leaves of  Psidium guajava. Shortly after intraperitoneal administration of this fraction, typical  narcotic-like effects were observed, including catalepsy, analgesia, Straub tail, shallow respiratory movements and exophthalmos. The dose for 90% suppression of exploratory activity was between 3.3 and 6.6 mg/kg intraperitoneally and the onset of action was 6-8 min. The duration of activity was dose-dependent and, for a dose of 13.2 mg/kg given intraperitoneally, it was found to be more than 6 h. Qualitatively similar results on exploratory activity were obtained when the extract was administered orally. Doses of 3.3-6.6 mg/kg i.p. depressed spontaneous locomotor activity and tunnel running was curtailed. Higher doses abolished the spontaneous locomotor reflex action. A flavonoid compound or compounds appear to account for the activity seen.  <P><HR>

The electrically stimulated guinea-pig ileum and spontaneously contracting guinea-pig ileum preparations were employed in studies on the effects of an alcoholic extract and two flavonoid compounds, quercetin and quercetin-3-arabinoside, extracted from the leaves of Psidium  guajava. The extract showed a morphine-like inhibition of acetylcholine release in the coaxially stimulated ileum, together with an initial increase in muscular tone, followed by a gradual decrease. The morphine-like inhibition was found to be due to quercetin, starting at concentrations of 1.6 micrograms/ml. The glycoside did not show any such action at concentrations of up to 1.28 mg/ml. The extract inhibited spontaneous contractions in the unstimulated ileum with a concentration-response relationship.  <P><HR>

Gastrointestinal disorders are important causes of morbidity in developing countries. Natural  healing is the traditional way of treating these diseases in Guatemala. Ethnobotanical surveys  and literature reviews showed that 385 plants from 95 families are used in Guatemala for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. The activity of 84 of the most commonly used plants  was screened in vitro against five enterobacteria pathogenic to man (enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae and Shigella flexneri). Results indicate that 34 (40.48%) plants inhibit one or more of the enterobacteria tested. The most commonly inhibited bacterium was S. typhi (33.73%) and the most resistant was E. coli (7.35%). The plants of American origin which exhibited the best antibacterial  activity were: Byrsonima crassifolia, Diphysa robinioides, Gnaphalium stramineum, Guazuma ulmifolia, Psidium guajava, Sambucus mexicana, Simarouba glauca, Smilax lundelii, Spondias purpurea and Tagetes lucida. These results indicate a scientific basis for use of these medicinal plants for attacking enterobacterial infections in man. <P><HR>

An experimental in vitro model was developed for the study of plant extracts reported by traditional medicines in the treatment of diarrhea. The guinea-pig isolated ileum is perfused with the plant extract using an intraluminal approach. The peristaltic reflex is induced by electrical stimulation while the plant extract is perfused. The spasmolytic effects of Psidium guajava leaf methanol, hexane and water extracts were demonstrated suggesting the existence of  two different types of active components. The results obtained allow to propose this in vitro method as a useful model to reproduce some of the characteristics of the oral way of administration of plant extracts. <P><HR>

Measurement of rates of propulsion in the small intestine in control and experimental groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were carried out as a means of assessing antidiarrhoeal activity of aqueous extracts of the leaf of Psidium guajava (L.), using morphine as the standard drug of reference. Hyperpropulsion (diarrhoea) was induced by gavaging rats in a control group with Microlax, using phenol red mixed into it as a marker in the intestine, and the mean rate of the hyperpropulsion was determined. The normal rate of propulsion, defined as the percentage of the length of the ileum traversed by the front of the dye in 1 h after gavaging animals with a liquid paraffin-phenol red meal, was also determined in another control group. In experimental groups pretreated with enteral administration of either morphine or aqueous extracts, 1 h before the challenge with Microlax, the percentage inhibition to the hyperpropulsive rate (antidiarrhoeal activity) was calculated. Both morphine and the extracts produced a dose-response relationship in their antidiarrhoeal effects. A dose  of 0.2 ml/kg fresh leaf extract produced 65% inhibition of propulsion. This dose is equiactive  with 0.2 mg/kg of morphine sulphate. The antidiarrhoeal action of the extract may be due, in  part, to the inhibition of the increased watery secretions that occur commonly in all acute  diarrhoeal diseases and cholera. <P><HR>

Ethnobotanical surveys and literature review identified 408 plants used in Guatemala for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. The screening of 84 showed that 34 inhibit one or  more enterobacteria; 16 of these were selected for further investigation. Extracts were obtained with three solvents of different polarity (n-hexane, acetone and alcohol) and the in vitro activity was demonstrated against enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis and Shigella flexneri. The activity of nine ethanolic extracts against enterobacteria,  particularly Acalypha guatemalensis, Diphysa robinioides, Lippia dulcis, Psidium guajava and Spondias purpurea was confirmed. The plants with antibacterial activity are discussed. <P><HR>

The water and chloroform extracts of guava were tested for their antimutagenicity. The water extract was effective in inactivating the mutagenicity of direct-acting mutagens, e.g.,  4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine, sodium azide, and the S9-dependent mutagen, 2-aminofluorene,  in the tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium. The chloroform extract was inactive.  Autoclaving of the water extract for 15 min did not reduced its activity appreciably. The enhanced inhibitory activity of the extracts on pre-incubation suggests the possibility of desmutagens in the extracts. Besides ascorbic acid and citric acid, the major constituents of the extracts, the role of other antimutagenic factors in the extracts cannot be ruled out.  <P><HR>

The traditional herbal remedy from Psidium guajava leaves has been medically proposed in Mexico as effective treatment of acute diarrhea. A methanolic leaf extract was subjected to a  bioassay-guided isolation of spasmolytic constituents. Six fractions were separated on a polyvinylpolypyrrolidine (PVPP) column using a water methanol-gradient. The fraction containing flavonols inhibited peristalsis of guinea pig ileum in vitro. A trace of quercetin aglycone together with five glycosides was isolated from this active fraction and identified as quercetin 3-O-alpha-L-arabinoside (guajavarin); quercetin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside (isoquercetin); quercetin 3-O-beta-D-galactoside (hyperin); quercetin  3-O-beta-L-rhamnoside (quercitrin) and quercetin 3-O-gentobioside. Biological activity of  each pure compound was studied in the same bioassay. Obtained results suggest that the spasmolytic activity of the Psidium guajava leaf remedy is mainly due to the aglycone quercetin, present in the leaf and in the extract mainly in the form of five flavonols, and whose effect is produced when these products are hydrolyzed by gastrointestinal fluid.<P><HR>

The antidiarrheal properties of water and methanolic extracts of Psidium guajava leaves have been demonstrated with anteriority and their spasmolytic effect was attributed to quercetin, a flavonoid contained in this plant. The present paper reports the intestinal smooth muscle relaxation produced by quercetin on isolated guinea pig ileum previously contracted by a depolarizing KCl solution. Quercetin also inhibited intestinal contraction induced by different concentrations of calcium, shifting the contraction curve to the right showing a clear calcium-antagonistic effect. Quercetin effect on ileal and aortic smooth muscles are compared, the ileum being more sensitive to this flavonoid. The calcium-antagonist property of quercetin is discussed and also its contribution to explain the spasmolytic effect of this popular herbal remedy.  <P><HR>

Fifty-seven Thai herbs and spices were examined for their retroviral reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity. All herbs and spices were extracted with hot-water and methanol. Reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity of the extracts was determined by using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptase (M-MuLV-RT) reacted with 3H-dTTP and radioactivity measured with a scintillation counter. Eighty-one per cent (46/57) of hot-water extracts and 54% (31/57) of methanol extracts showed inhibitory activities. At a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml, 13% (6/46) of hot-water extracts, namely Eugenia caryophyllus Bullock et Harrison, Phyllanthus urinaria Linn., Terminalia belerica Roxb., Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn., Psidium guajava Linn. and Lawsonia inermis Linn., had a relative inhibitory ratio (IR) over 50%. They showed ratios of 100%, 91%, 75%, 74%, 61% and 60%, respectively. For methanol extracts, only 10% (3/31) had IR values over 50%. They  were T. belerica, E. caryophyllus and N. nucifera which exhibited IR values of 83%, 54% and 54%, respectively. <P><HR>

OBJECTIVE. To investigate antigiardiasic activity in plants used in Mexico as antidiarrheics  and/or antiparasitics. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Fourteen species were evaluated.  The antigiardiasic activity was measured in vitro in a blinded fashion using trophozoites of  Giardia duodenalis incubated with plant extracts. The viability of trophozoites was ascertained using MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-il]-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) which is reduced  to MTT-formazan by the activity of live trophozoites. The reduced MTT was extracted with an acidified alcohol (2-propanol with HCI 0.04 M) and measured in a spectrophotometer at  570 nm. Negative (trophozoites without extract) and positive controls (incubated with tinadazol) were included. RESULTS. The scientific and trivial names of the plants are given  (trivials in Spanish marked by an asterisk). They had the following trophozoite mortality (mean +/- SD in percent): Justicia spicigera (muicle*) = 91 +/- 0.5; Lipia beriandieri (oregano) = 90 +/- 0.6; Psidium guajava (guava) = 87 +/- 1.0; positive control of tinidazol = 79 +/- 1.9;  Punica granutus (granado*) = 78 +/- 1.3; Magnifera indica (mango) = 77 +/- 1.0; Plantago  major (lante*) = 76 +/- 1.2; Cupressus semperbirens (cipres) = 73 +/- 1.2; Castella  tormentosa (chaparro amargoso*) = 70 +/- 0.7; Hematoxilon campechanum (palo de  Campeche*) = 67 +/- 1.2. Without or with a low mean activity were Prosopis juliflora  (mesquite*) and Rizophora mangle (mangle*) with 0%, Oriza sativa (rice) with 5%, Capsicum annum (pimiento*) with 21% and Persea americana (avocado) with 23%. There  were no associations of the antigiardiasic effect with concentration or osmolality of the extracts. CONCLUSIONS. A clear in vitro antigiardiasic effects was seen in nine species.  Three of them were superior to tinidazol which is a drug of common use in the treatment of  giardiasis. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
In spite of many references to Pilocarpus Jaborandi Holmes in ethnological and botanical sources and suggestions of its employment for a variety of diseases, it has not been possible  to pin down the use of its leaves to any particular purpose amongst South American Indians. While the medically important jaborandis are species of Pilocarpus, it is true that this vernacular name is commonly applied to other rutaceous and numerous piperaceous plants as  well. The introduction of jaborandi leaves to western medicine goes back to 1873, when  Symphronio Coutinho went to Europe, taking with him samples of the leaves. The copious  sweating and salivation brought about by the leaves attracted the attention of French physicians. Soon jaborandi leaves were being employed in the treatment of many diseases. In 1875, Hardy and Gerrard independently discovered the alkaloid pilocarpine. Most therapeutic applications of jaborandi leaves and pilocarpine fell into disuse and were
discontinued. What remained was the use of the latter in ophthalmology, where it had been introduced as a miotic by Weber in 1876. The mixture of pilocarpine and another natural product, physostigmine, remains to this day one of the mainstays in ophthalmology.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Iontophoresis is the process of introducing ionic drugs into the body for therapeutic purposes. Although iontophoresis has the potential for systemic therapy, it has mainly been used for local therapy at body surfaces. Many ionic drugs are available including lidocaine, epinephrine, methylprednisolone succinate, dexamethasone phosphate, several antivirals, various antibiotics, and other specific drugs. The use of an indicated ionic drug by iontophoresis offers a broad potential for promoting the development of more effective therapies in dermatology. Iontophoresis of ionized drugs provided a 20-60 fold increase in penetration over topical application. Iontophoresis for dermatological use requires that: a) a charged drug be placed at an electrode having a polarity the same charge as the drug, b) the condition or disease under  treatment be at or near the body surface, and c) a modern, sophisticated source of direct current, with appropriate accessories, be used. The current source must have features that make it not only effective, but also safe for application to the patient. Modern systems for application of drugs by iontophoresis have features that make the process simple and efficient for use in practice. Iontophoresis has a long history of use, having been suggested for various therapies for many years in medicine, physical therapy and dentistry. Pilocarpine iontophoresis  is a preferred method for cystic fibrosis detection. Also, lidocaine iontophoresis has been  advocated to anesthetize the tympanic membrane before myringotomy. Anesthesia of the skin to a depth of 1.0 cm or more has been reported in double-blind studies of human volunteers.  Local anesthesia by iontophoresis was reported to be effective for: 1) cutaneous cutdowns in  patients requiring kidney dialysis, 2) delicate eyelid surgery, as the sole anesthetic, 3)  preinjection topical anesthesia, and 4) shave biopsies of skin lesions. The use of iontophoresis  for treating difficult cases of hyperhydrosis is quite popular among dermatologists. The present  report emphasizes uses of iontophoresis in dermatology and is divided into discussion of studies using iontophoresis for postherpetic neuralgia, local anesthesia, antiviral therapy, and for corticosteroid therapy of nonspecific inflammatory lesions. Over 1250 patients have been treated for postherpetic neuralgia by corticosteroid iontophoresis at 6 medical centers with 60-80% of patients showing a major therapeutic response with return to a tolerable pain level.  Double-blind studies of varicella zoster (active and postherpetic) and herpes simplex have  proven that iontophoresis is a valuable modality for treating viral diseases of the skin. Many  other uses for iontophoresis have been proposed in the literature that involve several hundred  research papers, several textbooks and many book chapters. Review of the literature  supports the concept that iontophoresis provides an optimal method for drug application in  therapy of surface tissues.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Pilocarpine (P) is of potential utility in the treatment of xerostomia. Because optimal development of P dosage forms for humans requires that its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics be defined, this intravenous study of its disposition and associated salivary responses was performed. In a hospital setting, two healthy female subjects were given a series of graded doses of intravenous P or placebo to stimulate salivary secretion. Plasma levels of P, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate were simultaneously monitored. Other objective and subjective physiological parameters were assessed. Plasma concentrations of P declined either mono- or bi-exponentially with time, and brisk initial salivation was followed by prolonged salivation at doses > or = 1 mg. At doses between 0.5 and 3.5 mg, dose-independent pharmacokinetic parameters included a small steady-state volume of distribution (2.4 to 3.0 L/kg), a high plasma clearance (0.026 to 0.03 L/kg/min), and a mean residence time of approximately 100 min. The cumulative volume of whole saliva  secreted during the first 3 h post-dose was linearly related to the area under the plasma concentration-time curve. Plasma concentrations from 1 to 42 ng/mL were associated with significant levels of salivation. The pharmacokinetic linearity of the system and proportionality between the area under plasma concentration-time curves and overall salivary response have  important implications for the design and utilization of pilocarpine dosage forms. <P><HR><BR><BR><BR>

Abstract<BR>
Bark infusions of Zizyphus joazeiro Mart. (Rhamnaceae) have been employed in  Northeastern Brazil as a remedy for fever. This study investigated the antipyretic activity of an aqueous extract of the plant in rabbits rendered febrile by intravenous injection of E. coli endotoxin. Fever responses were significantly decreased (P less than 0.05) by the oral  administration of a bark infusion of Z. joazeiro Mart. These results lend support to the popular use of infusions of this plant in folk medicine as a remedy for fever and suggest that the characterization of the principle(s) responsible for such activity deserves further investigation.<P><HR><BR><BR><BR>

Abstract<BR>
Fatty acid profiles were obtained for macadamia nut oil and several other cooking oils.  Macadamia nut oil contained the highest level (79%) of monounsaturated fatty acids.  Macadamia nut oil is low (4%) in the omega-6 fatty acid 18:2n-6 and saturated fatty acids. Fatty acid profiles for popcorn cooked in several oils were obtained for comparison because of public awareness and concern over high levels of saturated fat found in popcorn sold in theaters. The nutritional implications of using macadamia nut oil are discussed.<P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Palmitoleic acid is a minor monounsaturated fatty acid in the human diet and in blood plasma. Because macadamia oil is at least one potentially large source of palmitoleic acid, we tested  its effect on plasma lipid levels against two other dietary fatty acids, oleic acid and palmitic  acid. The dietary adjustments, through the use of supplements, provided comparisons of the three test fatty acids in which palmitoleic could be judged as behaving either like a saturated or a monounsaturated acid. Thirty-four hypercholesterolemic men ate the three test diets in  random order in 3-week periods. Plasma total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were similar with palmitoleic and palmitoleic acids and significantly higher than with oleic acid. High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was significantly lower  with palmitoleic than with palmitic acid. The study confirms that, at least in hypercholesterolemic men, a modest increase in palmitic acid (+4% en) raises LDL cholesterol relative to oleic acid (+3% en), even when dietary cholesterol is low (< 165 mg/day). Palmitoleic acid (+4% en) behaves like a saturated and not a monounsaturated fatty acid in its effect on LDL cholesterol. <P><BR><BR><HR><BR>

Abstract<BR>
Some activities of seven vegetable extracts and an association of them given by oral route were tested on the C.N.S. of the mouse. Among these, Crataegus oxyacantha and, less clearly, Valeriana officinalis show some sedative activity, whereas the extract from Passiflora incarnata gives some anxiolytic effect. Matricaria chamomilla and Piscidia erythrina stand in an intermediate position between the previous ones. Hyoscyamus niger proved to be active in only one of the tests performed, whereas Atropa belladonna did not show any activity on the C.N.S. The association of the seven extracts seemed to act in a synergetic way, the resulting activity being sedative at high dosage and anxiolytic at low dosage. <P><BR><BR><HR><BR>

Abstract<BR>
The effect of mangiferin, a tetrahydroxy pyrrolidone saponin extracted from the leaves of  mango (Mangifera indica), against herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in vitro was studied.  The 50% effective concentration (EC50) of it against HSV-2 plaque formation in HeLa cells was 111.7 micrograms.ml-1, and the concentrations of 33 and 80 micrograms.ml-1 reduced  the virus replicative yields by 90% (EC90) and 99% (EC99), respectively. The therapeutic index (IC50/EC50) was 8.1. Mangiferin did not directly inactivate HSV-2. The results of the drug addition and removal tests suggest that mangiferin inhibits the late event in HSV-2 replication.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
An unusual fatty acid, cis-9,cis-15-octadecadienoic acid, has been identified in the pulp lipids of mango (Mangifera indica L.) grown in the Philippines. To our knowledge, the occurrence of cis-9,cis-15-octadecadienoic acid in higher plant lipids has not been previously reported. The structure confirmation was based on the results of chromatographic (capillary GC, argentation thin-layer) and spectrometric (GC-MS, infrared, ultraviolet) analysis and chemical treatment. This butylene-interrupted dienoic fatty acid is concentrated in the pulp part of mango fruit and occupies 5.4% of total acyl groups in the pulp lipids; whereas a common octadecadienoic acid, linoleic acid, is a minor component (1.1%) in the same lipids. If a trivial name is desired, it is suggested that cis-9,cis-15-octadecadienoic acid be called "mangiferic" acid.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
This chapter provides an updated report of carotenoprotein-related research. Very few carotenoproteins have been purified; however, their presence in aqueous extracts may be indicated by spectroscopic evidence. Carotenoproteins have been isolated, purified, and characterized from the ectoderm, exoskeleton, eggs, and ovaries of marine invertebrates, especially crustaceans. Water-soluble and detergent-soluble carotenoid-protein complexes have also been isolated from the cytoplasmic membrane of some cyanobacteria, Mangifera indica, and carrots. Recently, we have been able to partially purify a beta-carotene-protein complex from fresh livers of rats fed beta-carotene. Studies are currently in progress to purify and characterize the protein. This is the first successful isolation of a vertebrate carotenoprotein. The isolation of carotenoproteins is generally by standard techniques of protein chemistry. Purification, crystallization of the complex, and reconstitution of apoprotein and carotenoid components have been achieved for some crustacean carotenoproteins. The complex is very sensitive to bright light and to temperatures above that of refrigeration. However, it is best preserved in solutions of high ionic strength or as a precipitate in strong ammonium sulfate solutions.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Administration of large oral doses of retinyl palmitate has become the most widely practised vitamin A deficiency prevention strategy in developing countries. We conducted a follow-up study among 220 Senegalese children aged 2-7 years suffering from moderate undernutrition to determine the efficacy of vitamin A treatment on their vitamin A status assessed by biochemical and cytological (impression cytology with transfer) methods. The first examination (T = 0 m[onth]) was carried out during April 1989, before the mango (Mangifera indica L,) harvest. The second examination (T = 2 m) was carried out 2 months after vitamin A treatment during June 1989 when ripe mangoes become widely available. Conjunctival cells of the eyes of the children with or without ocular inflammation were responsive to vitamin A administration (P < 0.01). There was a significant increase (P < 0.001) in mean serum retinol  and beta-carotene levels between T = 0 m and T = 2 m. Mean serum retinol-binding protein  (RBP) and transthyretin (TTR) levels did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) at T = 0 m and T = 2 m. Despite the intake of vitamin A, 54% of the children who had abnormal cytology at T = 0 m remained abnormal at T = 2 m. This was due to inadequate levels of TTR and RBP, presumably due to the cereal diet eaten by the Senegalese population. children with abnormal eye cytology had lower serum retinol levels than those with normal eyes at T = 0 m, and beta-carotene values did not correlate with eye cytological abnormalities at T = 0 m. Children with normal cytology had higher serum retinol and also beta-carotene levels than those with  abnormal cytology after massive oral doses of vitamin A and consumption of mangoes at T = 2 m. Retinyl palmitate may, therefore, only lead to partial cytological improvement due to a lack of retinol-carrier proteins but dietary beta-carotene may also be involved.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Though a number of plants and their parts are used for dental ailments among population in rural and urban areas of developing countries, in India however, the most common house-hold, road-side plants are mango (Mangifera indica), neem (Azadirachta indica; Melia azadirachta), ocimum (Ocimum basilicum), tea-dust (Camellia sinensis) and uncommonly  murayya, i.e., currey leaf (Murayya koenigi) [Chopra et al. 1958, Kirtikar and Basu 1935, Nadakarni 1954, Satyavati 1984]. The leaves of these plants are folded and brushed  (massage with teadust) against the teeth. Therefore, the present study is restricted only to the fleshy leaf extracts [Jindal et al. 1975] (except tea) of these plants inspite of certain limitations in the methodology and arbitrations in the microbial identification and isolation in the light of recent advances in folk dentistry. The investigation was carried out in two parts: 1) Experimental study: The efficacy of various dentifrices (commonly available in the market) and the potentiating effect of the leaf extract (LE) of the aforesaid indigenous plants when amalgamated with the tooth-paste against pathogens, were investigated. Further, the protection afforded by the said plant extracts (PE) over the conventional allopathic medicines on the human plaque cultures and gram negative bacteria from patients were studied. 2) Clinical study: The therapeutic effects of the said PE (individually) on clinical application among severely infected patients were examined.  <P><HR>

The volatile acids extracted by pentane/dichloromethane (2 + 1) from tropical fruit pulps were identified and determined by capillary gas chromatography (HRGC) and combined capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using EI- and CI mode (HRGC-EI/CIMS). In cherimoya (A. cherimolia, Mill.) fruit pulp 47 acids were characterized; major compounds were hexanoic (3 mg/kg) and octanoic (1 mg/kg) acid. Fifty one acids were identified in guava (P. guajava, L.), 54 in mango (M, indica, L., var. Alphonso) and 56 in papaya (C. papaya, L.). (E)-cinnamoic acid (0.4 mg/kg) and (Z)-3-hexenoic acid (0.2 mg/kg) were determined as major constituents in guava; in mango 5-hydroxy-(Z)-7-decenoic acid (2 mg/kg) and 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid (1.1 mg/kg) and in papaya pulp butanoic acid (1.2  mg/kg) were established as major constituents.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
The pharmacological effects of 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (chrysin), a naturally occurring  monoflavonoid that displaces [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the central benzodiazepine (BDZ)  receptors, were examined in mice. In the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety, diazepam (DZ, 0.3-0.6 mg/kg) or chrysin (1 mg/kg) induced increases in the number of entries into the open  arms and in the time spent on the open arms, consistent with an anxiolytic action of both compounds. The effects of chrysin on the elevated plus-maze was abolished by pretreatment with the specific BDZ receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 (3 mg/kg). In the holeboard,  diazepam (1 mg/kg) and chrysin (3 mg/kg) increased the time spent head-dipping. In contrast,  high doses of DZ (6 mg/kg) but not of chrysin produced a decrease in the number of head dips and in the time spent head-dipping. In the horizontal wire test, diazepam (6 mg/kg) had a  myorelaxant action. In contrast, chrysin (0.6-30 mg/kg) produced no effects in this test. These data suggest that chrysin possesses anxiolytic actions without inducing sedation and muscle relaxation. We postulate that this natural monoflavonoid is a partial agonist of the central BDZ  receptors. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
4-Hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone is responsible for the anti-bacterial activity of an extract of  leaves from Passiflora tetrandra with minimum inhibitory doses (MID) of ca. 10 micrograms/disk against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  4-Hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone is also cytotoxic to P388 murine leukemia cells (IC50 of less than 1 microgram/ml). <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>The four major C-glycosidic flavonoids isolated from Passiflora incarnata were identified as schaftoside, isoschaftoside, isovetexin-2''-O-glucopyranoside and  isoorientin-2''-O-glucopyranoside on the basis of mass spectral and 13C NMR data. The daughter ion spectra of [M + H]+ ions of schaftoside and isoschaftoside showed differences for the [M + H - 104]+ ions, which could be rationalized by hydrogen bonding effects. In the  negative-ion mode, pronounced differences were found for the [M - H - 90]- and [M - H - 120]- ions, formed by prevalent fragmentation in the C-6-linked sugar moiety. With respect to isovitexin-2''-O-beta-glucopyranoside and isoorientin-2''-O-beta-glucopyranoside, the  daughter ion spectra of both the [M + H]+ and [M - H]- ions provided evidence for a 1----2  linkage in the diglucosidic moiety. Support for C-6 glucosylation was obtained by recording  the daughter ion spectra of [M - H - 162]- ions, which were in good agreement with that obtained for [M - H]- ions of isovitexin. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Chrysin (5,7-di-OH-flavone) was identified in Passiflora coerulea L., a plant used as a sedative in folkloric medicine. Chrysin was found to be a ligand for the benzodiazepine receptors, both central (Ki = 3 microM, competitive mechanism) and peripheral (Ki = 13  microM, mixed-type mechanism). Administered to mice by the intracerebroventricular route, chrysin was able to prevent the expression of tonic-clonic seizures induced by  pentylenetertrazol. Ro 15-1788, a central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, abolished this effect. In addition, all of the treated mice lose the normal righting reflex which suggests a myorelaxant action of the flavonoid. The presence in P. coerulea of benzodiazepine-like compounds was also confirmed. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
In this paper we have studied the rat under chronic treatment with Passiflora oral. For a three week period we have recorded, once a week, weight, rectal temperature, tail flick, motor coordination and general activity in a one-arm radial maze. At the end of the third week surface (SEEG) and deep (DEEG) EEG were recorded from treated animals. The findings  are: 1) no change was observed in weight, rectal temperature, tail-flick and motor  coordination. 2) The treated rats, when in a one-arm radial maze showed a diminished general  activity. 3) SEEG and DEEG recordings showed "normal" electric activity. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Flavonoid production and accumulation during the ontogenic cycle of Passiflora incarnata L. was studied. The highest concentration of isovitexin occurred between pre-flowering and flowering stages. The greatest accumulation of flavonoids took place in the leaves. Furthermore some pharmacodiagnostic characteristics of the drug of P. incarnata were specified using a Scanning Electron Microscope. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Some activities of seven vegetable extracts and an association of them given by oral route were tested on the C.N.S. of the mouse. Among these, Crataegus oxyacantha and, less clearly, Valeriana officinalis show some sedative activity, whereas the extract from Passiflora incarnata gives some anxiolytic effect. Matricaria chamomilla and Piscidia erythrina stand in an intermediate position between the previous ones. Hyoscyamus niger proved to be active in only one of the tests performed, whereas Atropa belladonna did not show any activity on the C.N.S. The association of the seven extracts seemed to act in a synergetic way, the resulting activity being sedative at high dosage and anxiolytic at low dosage.<P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
The fatty acid composition of the oil content of seeds from native fruits of the American Tropics was analyzed. The species studied were maracuyá (Passiflora edulis), morro (Crescentia alata), zapote (Calocarpum mammosum) and icaco (Chrysobalanus icaco). The findings for maracuyá are in agreement with the data found in the literature. There is no information pertaining to the fatty acid composition of the seed oil for the other species. Icaco oil showed 4 unusual signals in its GC profile, two of which were identified as geometric  isomers of licanic acid. The structure of parinaric acid was assigned to the second pair. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Screening of 132 extracts from Argentine folk-medicinal plants for antimicrobial activity has  been conducted using a penicillin G resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Aspergillus niger as test microorganisms. Cephazolin, ampicillin and miconazole were used as standard antibiotics and concentration-response curves were obtained using the  agar-well diffusion method. Boiling water extracts of plant materials were tested and 12  species were active against Staphylococcus aureus, whereas 10 were effective against  Escherichia coli and 4 against Aspergillus niger. Tabebuia impetiginosa bark, Achyrocline sp.  aerials parts, Larrea divaricata leaves, Rosa borboniana flowers, Punica granatum fruit pericarp, Psidium guineense fruit pericarp, Lithrea ternifolia leaves and Allium sativum bulbs produced some of the more active extracts.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
The methanol extracts of the leaves and stem bark of four Bignoniaceae plants Jacaranda  mimosifolia D. Dol., Tecoma stans Linn., Tabebuia rosea (Bertol) D.C., and Crescentia  cujete Linn. were studied for their antimicrobial activity using a wide range of Gram-positive  and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Extracts of both the leaves and stem bark of majority  of plant species studied showed variable but remarkable broad spectrum antimicrobial  activity. However, methanol extracts of Tecoma stans leaves was found to be effective against  only Candida albicans at the concentrations employed. It was observed that the extracts of  stem bark generally showed better antimicrobial activity than those of the leaves and some organisms were selectively more sensitive to the extracts than others. Preliminary phytochemical screening of these plants revealed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, quinones and traces of saponins. The antimicrobial activity observed are discussed  in relation to the chemical constituents reportedly isolated from these plants and their traditional uses.  <P><BR><BR><HR>

The protocol with each plant lasted 56 days. 2. After the ingestion  of infusions of 3 g leaves/day of M. uniflora and B. forficata leaves, no acute or chronic  effects on plasma glucose levels or glycated hemoglobin were found in either group.  However, plasma insulin levels in the diabetic group were lower after M. uniflora than after  placebo. 3. Among other clinical parameters tested, a statistically significant difference was  found only in the alkaline phosphatase level after placebo compared with that after M. uniflora  in the normal group. 4. There were no differences in any clinical parameters after the use of  placebo or of B. forficata. 5. We conclude that infusions prepared from the leaves of M. uniflora or B. forficata have no hypoglycemic effect on normal subjects or Type II diabetic  patients. <BR><BR><<BR>HR>

Abstract<BR>
Several metabolic parameters were used to determine the evolution of the diabetic state of streptozotocin diabetic rats treated with aqueous leaf extracts from Myricia uniflora, a plant widely used in northern Brazil for treatment of diabetes. The effect of the extracts on the intestinal absorption of glucose and on the evolution of diabetes of diabetic rats adapted to a high protein, carbohydrate-free diet were also investigated. Treated rats received twice a day,  by gavage, during three weeks, 7.5 mg of lyophilized powder, corresponding to about 60 mg  of dried leaves, prepared from percolations with boiled water, Treatment of diabetic rats fed a stock, balanced diet did not affect body weight gain but reduced the hyperglycemia, polyphagia, polydipsia, urine volume and the urinary excretion of glucose and urea. Myrcia administration for 3 weeks had no effect on the weight of epididymal and retroperitoneal  adipose tissue, or on the concentrations of pancreatic and serum insulin. The intestinal absorption of glucose, measured with a perfusion technique in situ, was markedly inhibited by Myrcia (7.5 mg of lyophilized powder per ml of perfusion solution). The effects of Myrcia treatment on diabetic rats adapted to a carbohydrate-free diet were similar to those obtained  in rats fed the stock diet. The data show that aqueous extracts of Myrcia has a beneficial effect on the diabetic state, mainly by improving metabolic parameters of glucose homeostasis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract<BR>
Infusions of Phyllanthus sellowianus or P. niruri (Euphorbiaceae) are a popular remedy in Brazil for kidney and bladder stones. This study describes the isolation of an alkaloid from P. sellowianus, denoted ALK-1, and compares its antipasmodic activity with that of papaverine on isolated strips of guinea pig ileum and rat uterus, and rat aorta rings. ALK-1 and papaverine promoted a dose-dependent flattening of the dose-response curves obtained to acetylcholine and histamine on ileum strips and of the dose-response curves to acetylcholine and oxytocin on uterine strips. A non-competitive antagonism of noradrenaline-induced contractions by the P. sellowianus alkaloid was also demonstrated on aortic rings. Whereas  the antispasmodic potency (pD'2 values) of papaverine did not depend on the muscle  preparation and agonist used, ALK-1 exhibited a greater potency on the ileum strips than on  the uterine or aortic preparations. Because of this selective antispasmodic action on the ileum,  ALK-1 was equipotent to papaverine on this tissue, but was about 10-fold less potent than  papaverine on uterine smooth-muscle. The dose-response curves to CaCl2 obtained for potassium-depolarized uterine strips were shifted to the right by both antispasmodics. Similar pA2 values with slopes not differing from unity -1.0 were obtained from Schild plots of the data, suggesting that competitive antagonism of calcium entry into the cell is a mechanism of  action common to both alkaloids. The presence of at least one potent antispasmodic alkaloid  in P. sellowianus justifies the popular use of infusions of this plant. Smooth muscle relaxation  within the urinary or biliary tract probably facilitates the expulsion of kidney or bladder. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
An aqueous extract of the plant Phyllanthus niruri inhibits endogenous DNA polymerase of   hepatitis B virus and binds to the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus in vitro. The extract also  inhibits woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) DNA polymerase and binds to the surface antigen  of WHV in vitro. The extract, nontoxic to mice, was tested for antiviral activity in  woodchucks (Marmota monax). In a trial using six long-term WHV-carrier woodchucks, five  treated animals showed a faster decrease in woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen titer  compared to one untreated control. In animals recently infected with WHV, the extract was  effective when administered i.p. in three out of four animals in reducing and within 3-6 weeks  eliminating both the surface antigen titer and DNA polymerase activity in serum. The treatment  was discontinued after 10 weeks, and the treated animals have remained free of detectable  markers of WHV for more than 45 weeks. In contrast, three untreated controls remained  positive for both markers for WHV. One of the controls died after 8 weeks; the other two  controls have remained positive for WHV markers for more than 45 weeks. In a third trial  with long-term carriers, test animals treated subcutaneously with the extract for 12 weeks did not respond; but on switching the mode of administration to i.p., two out of the five animals  showed a significant decrease in woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen titer compared to controls.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Aldose reductase (AR) inhibitory activity-directed fractionation of the 70% ethanolic extract  of Para-parai mí, Phyllanthus niruri, has led to the isolation of three active components, ellagic  acid (1), brevifolin carboxylic acid (4) and ethyl brevifolin carboxylate (5). Among them, 1  showed the highest inhibitory activity, being about 6 times more potent than quercitrin, which is a known natural inhibitor of AR.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Picroliv (active principle from Picrorrhiza kurroa), its major components picroside I, catalpol,  kutkoside I, kutkoside, andrographolide (active constituent of Andrographis paniculata),  silymarin and Phyllanthus niruri extract were tested for the presence of anti hepatitis B virus  surface antigen (anti HBs) like activity. HBsAg positive serum samples obtained from hepatitis B virus (HBV) associated acute and chronic liver diseases and healthy HBsAg carriers were used to evaluate the anti-HBs like activity of compounds/extract. The latter were mixed with serum samples and incubated at 37 degrees C overnight followed by HBsAg screening in the Elisa system. A promising anti-HBsAg like activity was noted in picroliv (and its major components) catalpol, P. niruri which differed from the classical viral neutralization. Picroliv also inhibited purified HBV antigens (HBsAg and HBsAg) prepared from healthy HBsAg carriers. The in vitro testing system appears to be a suitable model to identify an agent active against HBV, prior to undertaking detailed studies.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
An aqueous extract of Phyllanthus niruri (Euphorbiaceae) inhibited human immunodeficiency  virus type-1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1-RT). The inhibitor against HIV-1-RT in this plant  was purified by combination of three column chromatographies, Sephadex LH-20, cellulose,  and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The inhibitor was then identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra as repandusinic acid A monosodium salt (RA) which was originally isolated from Mallotus repandus. The 50% inhibitory doses (ID50) of RA on HIV-1-RT and DNA polymerase alpha (from HeLa cells) were 0.05 microM and 0.6  microM, respectively, representing approximately a 10-fold more sensitivity of HIV-1-RT compared with DNA polymerase alpha. RA was shown to be a competitive inhibitor with  respect to the template-primer while it was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to the  substrate. RA as low as 10.1 microM inhibited HIV-1-induced cytopathogenicity in MT-4 cells. In addition, 4.5 microM of RA inhibited HIV-1-induced giant cell formation of SUP-T1  approximately 50%. RA (2.5 microM) inhibited up to 90% of HIV-1 specific p24 antigen production in a Clone H9 cell system.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic effect of the methanolic extract from callus culture of Phyllanthus tenellus, P. corcovadensis and P. niruri in several models of pain in mice. The extracts (medium containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) of P. corcovadensis,  P. niruri and P. tenellus (3-90 mg kg-1, i.p.) caused graded inhibition of abdominal constrictions induced by acetic acid (0.6%), with ID50 (i.e. dose that reduced response of control by 50%) values of about 30, 19 and > 30 mg kg-1, respectively. The extract of callus of Phyllanthus obtained in indole-3-butyric acid and indole-3-acetic acid media (3-90 mg  kg-1, i.p.) caused a similar analgesic effect. In the formalin test, the extract of P. tenellus obtained in indole butyric acid medium (3-100 mg kg-1, i.p.) inhibited only the second phase of formalin-induced pain with an ID50 value of about 100 mg kg-1. Both the indole acetic acid and indole butyric acid methanolic extracts of P. tenellus and P. corcovadensis (10-100 mg kg-1, i.p.) dose-dependently inhibited both phases of formalin-induced pain (ID50 values  for the second phase were approx. 100 and 52 mg kg-1, respectively). However, the extract  of callus from Phyllanthus failed to affect formalin-induced paw oedema, as well as the response to radiant heat in the tail-flick test. In addition, the analgesic effect of morphine, but  not the analgesic effects caused by Phyllanthus callus extract, was fully antagonized by  naloxone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
It has been suggested that herbs of the Phyllanthus family may have antiviral activity. We  therefore tested the effects of three different Phyllanthus extracts on the serologic status of  123 patients with chronic hepatitis B. Eleven patients received an extract of Phyllanthus  amarus (L) provided by S.P. Thyagarajan, Madras, India. Forty-two patients received  Phyllanthus niruri (L), gathered from Hainan Province in China, and 35 patients received an  extract of Phyllanthus urinaria (L), which had been gathered in Henan Province. Thirty-five control patients received no herbal therapy. The patients receiving Phyllanthus urinaria (L)  were both more likely to lose detectable hepatitis B e-antigen from their serum and more  likely to seroconvert hepatitis B e-antibody status from negative to positive than were patients  given either of the other two preparations. No patient changed status with respect to hepatitis  B s-antigen. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Sangre de Grado extract used by Peruvian natives as a cicatrizant agent, was collected from trees of the species Croton lechleri growing in the Peruvian jungle. The Sangre de Grado was found to contain one alkaloid identified as taspine and which was shown to be the active  cicatrizant principle by an in vivo test in mice. This alkaloid exhibited a dose-related cicatrizant effect and an ED50 of 0.375 mg/kg. Experiments with taspine hydrochloride in order to study its mechanism of action in cell culture systems showed that the alkaloid was non-toxic to human foreskin fibroblasts at concentrations below 150 ng/ml and that it had no effect on cell proliferation. On the other hand, taspine hydrochloride was found to increase the migration of human foreskin fibroblasts. This effect on the migration of fibroblasts is probably the  mechanism by which Sangre de Grado and taspine hydrochloride accelerate the wound  healing process. Using the two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis system, we have been able to show that neither Sangre de Grado nor taspine hydrochloride had carcinogenic or tumour  promoter activity after 17 months of treatment.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Dragon's blood is a red viscous latex extracted from the cortex of various Croton spp. (Euphorbiaceae), most commonly Croton lechleri, Croton draconoides (or Croton palanostigma), and Croton erythrochilus. It is used in South American popular medicine for several purposes, including wound healing. Bioassay-guided fractionation of dragon's blood, using an in vitro test system for the stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, has resulted in the isolation of a dihydrobenzofuran lignan, 3',4-O-dimethylcedrusin or   4-O-methyldihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol  [2-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-2,3-dihydro-7-methoxybenzo furan-5- propan-1-ol] [1] as the biologically active principle. A related compound, 4-O-methylcedrusin [2-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-2,3-dihydro-7-hydroxybenzo furan-5- propan-1-ol] [2], and the alkaloid taspine [3], also isolated from dragon's blood, were not active in the same assay. A cell proliferation assay, measuring the incorporation of tritiated thymidine in endothelial cells, showed that compound 1 did not stimulate cell proliferation, but rather inhibited thymidine incorporation, while protecting cells against degradation in a starvation medium.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Three in-vitro assays have been adopted to examine the cytotoxicity and anti-bacterial activity of the blood-red sap of Croton lechleri from Ecuador, and to examine its effect upon the proliferation of endothelial cells. The sap was found not to be cytotoxic. Several simple phenolic compounds and diterpenes showed a potent anti-bacterial activity. The sap has little effect upon the proliferation of endothelial cells, and no single active ingredient was identified.  A mechanism for the wound-healing property of the sap has been proposed.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
The development of sensitive chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques for the isolation  and structure determination of natural products has greatly facilitated phytochemical investigations. Chemical investigations of herbarium material have resulted in the isolation of  indole, quinoline and isoquinoline alkaloids from a wide number of plants. Examples of novel  natural products from higher plants are given and include alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolics and  quinones. Some plants investigated have not yielded the types of constituents which would have been predicted from them. Plant tissue cultures provide alternative sources of biologically active compounds and examples investigated include Cinchona, Ailanthus, Brucea and Artemisia for antiprotozoal compounds and Datura for tropane alkaloids. Biological tests are useful for bioassay-guided fractionation of plant extracts and examples of the isolation of a series of natural products with antiprotozoal and cytotoxic activities are given. Chemical and biological  investigations into the traditional medicine Dragon's blood (Croton lechleri) from S. America and a Chinese prescription for the treatment of atopic eczema are described. The use of radio-ligand binding assays for the detection of a wide range of biological activities is discussed. Sensitivity of chemical and biological techniques has greatly improved prospects  for finding new drug entities from plants and for investigating traditional medicines. Basic phytochemical investigations should continue to be encouraged especially in view of the rapid loss of plant species.  <P><BR><BR><BR>

Abstract<BR>
Gastrointestinal disorders are important causes of morbidity in developing countries. Natural healing is the traditional way of treating these diseases in Guatemala. Ethnobotanical surveys and literature reviews showed that 385 plants from 95 families are used in Guatemala for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. The activity of 84 of the most commonly used plants was screened in vitro against five enterobacteria pathogenic to man (enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae and Shigella flexneri). Results indicate that 34 (40.48%) plants inhibit one or more of the enterobacteria tested. The most commonly inhibited bacterium was S. typhi (33.73%) and the most resistant was E. coli (7.35%). The plants of American origin which exhibited the best antibacterialactivity were: Byrsonima crassifolia, Diphysa robinioides, Gnaphalium stramineum, Guazuma ulmifolia, Psidium guajava, Sambucus mexicana, Simarouba glauca, Smilax lundelii, Spondias
purpurea and Tagetes lucida. These results indicate a scientific basis for use of these medicinal plants for attacking enterobacterial infections in man. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Skin infections are common diseases in developing countries, of which dermatophytoses are of particular concern in the tropics, especially in infants. Through ethnobotanical surveys and literature review 100 plants were detected as being used in Guatemala for the treatment of dermatophytoses. Of these, 44 plants were screened for in vitro activity against the most common dermatophytes (Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum). Results showed that aqueous extracts from 22 of the plants tested inhibit one or more of the dermatophytes. The most commonly inhibited dermatophytes were E. floccosum (43.2%), T. rubrum (36.0%), and T. mentagrophytes (31.8%); the less inhibited were M. canis (22.7%) and M. gypseum (24.0%). Plants of American origin which exhibited anti-dermatophyte activity were: Byrsonima crassifolia, Cassia grandis, Cassia occidentalis, Diphysa carthagenensis, Gliricidia sepium, Piscidia piscipula, Sambucus mexicana, Smilax regelii, Solanum americanum and Solanum nigrescens. Fungicidal and fungistatic activities as well as the minimal inhibitory concentration were demonstrated. These results provide a scientific basis for the use of these plants for the treatment of dermatophyte infections in man. <P><HR>

<b>TAP 29: an anti-human immunodeficiency virus protein from Trichosanthes kirilowii that is nontoxic to intact cells. </b><br>

Abstract<br>
An anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) protein capable of inhibiting HIV-1 infection and replication has been isolated and purified to homogeneity from Trichosanthes kirilowii. This protein, TAP 29 (Trichosanthes anti-HIV protein, 29 kDa), is di
stinct from trichosanthin [also known as GLQ 223 (26 kDa)] in size, N-terminal amino acid sequence, and cytotoxicity. In addition to three conservative substitutions--namely, Arg-29 to Lys, Ile-37 to Val, and Pro-42 to Ser--a total difference of residues
 12-16 was found. TAP 29 yielded -Lys-Lys-Lys-Val-Tyr-, whereas trichosanthin has -Ser-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Val-. Although the two proteins exhibit similar anti-HIV activity, as measured by syncytium formation, p24 expression, and HIV reverse transcriptase activity, they differ significantly in cytotoxicity, as measured by their effects on cellular DNA and protein syntheses. At the dose level of the bioassays, 0.34-340 nM, trichosanthin demonstrates a dose-dependent toxic effect on host cells. TAP 29 displays no
 toxic effect, even at 100 X ID50, whereas trichosanthin demonstrates 38% and 44% inhibition on cellular DNA and protein synthesis, respectively. These results indicate that the therapeutic index of TAP 29 is at least two orders of magnitude higher than
that of trichosanthin. Thus TAP 29 may offer a broader safe dose range in the treatment of AIDS. <p>

Abstract<br>
We have established transformed ("hairy") root cultures from Trichosanthes kirilowii Maxim. var japonicum Kitam. (Cucurbitaceae) and four related species to study the biosynthesis of the ribosome-inactivating protein trichosanthin (TCN) and other root-specific defense-related plant proteins. Stable, fast-growing root clones were obtained for each species by infecting in vitro grown plantlets with Agrobacterium rhizogenes American Type Culture Collection strain 15834. Each species accumulated reproducibly a discrete protein pattern in the culture medium. Analysis of the extracellular proteins from T. kirilowii var japonicum root cultures showed differential protein accumulation in the medium during the time course of growth in batch cultures. Maximum protein accumulation, approaching 20 micrograms/mL, was observed at mid-exponential phase, followed by a degradation of a specific protein subset that coincided with the onset of stationary phase. Two major extracellular proteins and one intracellular protein, purified by ion-exchange and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, were identified as class III chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) based on N-terminal amino acid sequence and amino acid composition homologies with other class III chitinases. T
he Trichosanthes chitinases also showed reactivity with a cucumber class III chitinase antiserum and chitinolytic activity in a glycol chitin gel assay. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis of intracellular
proteins showed that normal and transformed T. kirilowii var japonicum roots accumulated only low levels of TCN (approximately 0.5% total soluble protein). Storage roots from the plant displayed protein and antigen patterns different from root cultures and produced TCN as the dominant protein. Roots undergoing secondary growth and differentiation exhibited patterns similar to those of storage roots, including increased TCN levels, indicating that high production of TCN is associated with induction of secondary growth in roots. <p>

Abstract<br>
A new abortifacient protein, named karasurin, was isolated from fresh root tubers of Trichosanthes kirilowii MAXIMOWICZ var. japonicum KITAMURA (Cucurbitaceae, Japanese name: kikarasuuri) by the procedure involving acetone fractionation and ion-exchange
chromatography on Toyopearlpak SP 650S. Homogeneity of Karasurin was demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Karasurin was a highly basic protein of pI 10.1 and the molecular weight was estimated as 28000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Karasurin showed a strong abortion effect in pregnant mice. <p>

To search for possible anti-tumor-promoters, we carried out a primary screening of twenty-four 29-nor-cucurbitacin glucosides isolated from the roots of Cayaponia tayuya (Cucurbitaceae) using an in vitro synergistic assay system. Of these glucosides, cayaponosides B (5), B3 (7), D (8), D3b (22) and C2 (23) exhibited significant inhibitory effects on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) activation induced by the tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Furthermore, 5 and 23 exhibited remarkable  anti-tumor-promoting effects on mouse skin tumor promotion in an in vivo two-stage carcinogenesis test. <P><HR>

We have observed that several plants used popularly as anti-snake venom show anti-inflammatory activity. From the list prepared by Rizzini, Mors and Pereira some species have been selected and tested for analgesic activity (number of contortions) and anti-inflammatory activity (Evans blue dye diffusion--1% solution) according to Whittle's technique (intraperitoneal administration of 0.1 N-acetic acid 0.1 ml/10 g) in mice. Previous oral administration of a 10% infusion (dry plant) or 20% (fresh plant) corresponding to 1 or 2 g/kg of Apuleia leiocarpa, Casearia sylvestris, Brunfelsia uniflora, Chiococca brachiata, Cynara scolymus, Dorstenia brasiliensis, Elephantopus scaber, Marsypianthes chamaedrys, Mikania glomerata and Trianosperma tayuya demonstrated analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory activities of varied intensity. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
The investigation on steroidic fraction of Uncaria tomentosa, commonly called Una de gato,  showed the presence of beta-sitosterol (60%), stigmasterol, and campesterol. The percentage  of sterols have been carried out by GLC. The spectroscopic data 1H-NMR and MS of the  three compounds are also reported, with the beta-sitosterol as the main sterol. Preliminary  pharmacological investigations prove a moderate antiinflammatory activity. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Mutagenic and antimutagenic activities of extracts and chromatographic fractions of Uncaria tomentosa bark are reported. The plant extracts and fractions show no mutagenic effect in different strains of Salmonella typhimurium with and without metabolic activation. However, the plant extracts and fractions show a protective antimutagenic effect in vitro against photomutagenesis induced by 8-methoxy-psoralen (8-MOP) plus UVA in S. typhimurium TA 102. A decoction of U. tomentosa ingested daily for 15 days by a smoker decreased the mutagenicity induced in S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100 by the subject's urine.<P><BR><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Some dietary polyphenolic substances have been shown to inhibit oxidation of LDL. "Mate" is a polyphenol-containing beverage, brewed from the dried and minced leaves of Ilex paraguariensis. In the present work we studied the effect of water and alcohol extracts of Ilex paraguariensis on the initiation and propagation of LDL copper or H2O2-induced autoxidation. Our data show that substances in water extracts of Ilex paraguariensis are capable of inhibiting the initiation and the propagation of LDL oxidation. They inhibit lipid peroxidation, monitored by diene conjugates and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, as well as protein modification as shown through direct measurement of free amino groups, electrophoretic mobility, and fluorescence. This inhibition is a concentration dependent effect  that becomes already apparent at concentrations of extracts as low as 7.5 micrograms/ml. Inhibition is almost complete at 37.5 micrograms/ml. Alcohol extracts show similar effects  though with less potency. The substances implicated in this antioxidant activity are largely nondializable. In terms of mass, water extracts of Ilex paraguariensis were more potent antioxidants than either ascorbic acid, or butylated hydroxytoluene.  <P><HR>

1. The mutagenic and genotoxic effects of mate (Ilex paraguariensis) aqueous solutions were  analyzed in bacterial cells. 2. Mate solutions showed mutagenic activity in the Ames test (TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102 strains) at concentrations of 20 to 50 mg/plate (mutagenic factors of 3.5 to 5.6) and genotoxic activity in the inductest (WP2s (lambda) strain), with a maximal phage induction at concentrations of 10 to 20 mg/plate. Above these concentrations the mate solutions were cytotoxic. 3. Addition of 5 U/ml catalase, 20 microliters/ml S9 rat liver microsomal fraction, 100 mM thiourea or 10 mM dipyridyl completely inhibited the lysogenic induction produced by mate; however, the addition of 1,000 U/ml superoxide  dismutase was almost ineffective. 4. Oxygen reactive species may be present in mate solutions  playing an essential role in its genotoxicity.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
The importance of the research works on mate rests on the fact that this is greatly consumed in many South American countries. Our interest in this subject has increased because, in Europe, it use as an infusion seems to be increasing. The Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn contents were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry techniques. Prior to this, samples were incinerated and dissolved in an acid mixture (HCl/HNO3). Results apparently show a high content of mineral elements, especially K. Mg and Mn, in mate, findings which we consider to be of great relevance.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
A case-control study of oral and pharyngeal cancer involving interviews with 108 cases and 286 controls was carried out in the University Hospital of Montevideo, Uruguay. The study was restricted to males and cases afflicted with lip, salivary gland and nasopharyngeal cancer  were excluded. Point estimates of RR associated with smoking variables, alcohol variables,  nutritional items and ingestion of hot infusions of the herb Ilex paraguariensis ('Mate') were  obtained by logistic regression analysis. Dark tobacco smokers showed a RR 3.4 times higher than light tobacco users and heavy drinkers of wine displayed an OR of 17.2. Mate exposure  showed a significant dose-response, after adjustment for age, tobacco and alcohol intake, with a fivefold increase in risk for heavy consumers. Joint exposure to black tobacco and  wine displayed very high risks and no significant interactions were observed. The results suggest that the high rates of oropharyngeal cancer could be explained by the multiplicative effect of black tobacco smoking, wine drinking and mate ingestion.  <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
A case-control study of bladder cancer involving interviews with 111 incident cases and 222  controls was carried out in Montevideo, Uruguay. The analysis was conducted separately for  each sex. Point estimates of relative risk associated with smoking variables, ingestion of  infusions of the herb Ilex paraguariensis (maté), and selected dietary items were obtained by  stratified and logistic regression analysis. Among men, smokers of black tobacco showed a  relative risk (RR) 2.7 higher than blond tobacco smokers and maté exposure showed a significant dose-response, after adjustment for age, residence, social class, hospital, type of  tobacco, smoking intensity, smoking duration, and vegetable consumption, with a seven-fold increase in risk for heavy consumers. Joint exposure to type of tobacco and maté  consumption showed a multiplicative effect. Women showed a similar increase in risk with  maté consumption. The results suggest that the high mortality rates of bladder cancer observed in Uruguay could be explained by the combined effect of black tobacco smoking and maté ingestion. <P><HR>

Abstract<BR>
Consumption of maté, a tea-like infusion of the herb Ilex paraguariensis, is common in South America. Drinkers have high risks of upper aerodigestive tract cancers, but it is conceivable  that this high risk may be attributable to confounding by smoking alcohol, and other exposures. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the data from a case-control study of upper aerodigestive tract cancers conducted in Southern Brazil. We matched noncancer controls (N = 756) to cases (N = 378) on the basis of age, sex, and period of admission. We estimated the effect of mateé consumption by conditional logistic regression with adjustment for  smoking, alcohol, sociodemographics, and several dietary items, considered as confounders. The unadjusted relative risk (RR) for all upper aerodigestive tract cancers was 2.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.6-2.7]. Some excess risk persisted after adjustment for potential confounders (RR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2-2.2). Most of the excess risk for maté drinkers was for oral (RR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.1-3.3) and laryngeal (RR = 2.2; 95% CI = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.1-4.5) cancers. There was no evidence of associations with coffee and tea drinking. We conclude that the association of maté consumption with upper aerodigestive tract cancer risk  is unlikely to result from insufficient control of confounding by critical exposures. Owing to its
high prevalence in Southern South America, maté drinking may be linked to as many as 20% of all cases occurring in this region. <P>

<CENTER><H1>Cat's Claw FAQ</H1></CENTER>

Because Cat's Claw is a relatively new supplement in the American market, many  retailers, consumers and practitioners don't have all the facts and information about it.  It's popularity has grown tremendously, and already misinformation has circulated in the market due to unethical marketing practices as well as a true lack of knowledge of the facts regarding Cat's Claw.  Most consumers and retailers are also unaware of the difference between various Cat's Claw products in the market and have no way to judge the many different products that are now being offered.<P>

<B>How to tell which Cat's Claw is better</B><P>
The only available  standard to evaluate the quality of Cat's Claw offered today is by the amount of alkaloids independantly assayed in the product.  The oxindole alkaloids, one of the main active constituents, are some of the most studied phytochemicals in the plant to date.  Always demand to see an alkaloid assay before purchasing any cat's claw product.  We have tested many retail products and have monitored the bulk market that sells cat's claw to various manufacturers and are quite alarmed at what has been happening.  Several months ago 20 tons of "cat's claw bark" was sold to various manufacturers and private labelers with an alkaloid content of only .137 % Compared to Raintree Nutrition's alkaloid content of 1.55%, this is HUGE difference in quality and efficacy and we believe the only way to get an alklaoid measurement this low is to grind the entire vine and not just the inner bark.   This low potency, poor quality product is now on retail shelves throughout the country under various labels.    Know what you are buying by demanding to see independant alkaloid assays!  <P>

Raintree provides independant assays on our bottled cat's claw capsules showing an alkaloid content of 1.55%.  Peruvian Rainforest Botanicals, another leading retail label,  publishes their alkaloid assays in trade journals showing an alkaloid content of .91%.  Vita Vital, which sells Cat's Claw Root touting that the root is higher in alkaloids than the bark,  recently published their alkaloid assay in  Whole Foods Magazine showing an alkaloid content of .61%.  Despite Peruvian's marketing claim of selling the highest quality cat's claw  available, Raintree delivers 70% more alkaloids than Peruvian.  Despite Vital Vital's claim that their [much higher priced] Cat's Claw root has more alkaloids than inner bark, Raintree delivers 151% more alkaloids than Vita Vital.  An article printed in the June, 1996 New Editions Health World Magazine comparing Peruvian Imports and Vital Vital's alkaloid contents sheds further light on both of these products.  The article titled, "<I>CAT'S CLAW BARK VS. ROOT CONTROVERSY</I>," states: 
<blockquote>
<I>"Recently, an independent laboratory conducted an analysis of an equal measurement of Cat's Claw powder from both Vida Vital and Peruvian Rainforest Botanical to determine their total percentage of alkaloid content, considered to be the herbs most important component.  The result? The total alkaloid content of Peruvian Rainforest Botanical's Cat's Claw was approximately 35% higher than Vida Vital's.... Consumers should take note that paying an exorbanant price for Cat's Claw does not insure that they will obtain a higher quality."</I><P>
</blockquote><P>
<B>The New Standardized Extracts</B><P>
Several companies now offer standardized extracts with 2% or 3% total alkaloids in capsules.  When faced with buying a product with an unknown alkaloid content which could be as low as .137%, this is a better option - as least consumers know the alkaloid content.  Since Cat's Claw is new and many different methods are employed to concentrate and standardize these products, some caution must be used.  One standardized extract we tested employed methylene gas in their extraction process and the final product (sold in health food stores today) was so toxic and volitile, it exploded when it hit boiling water.  Also consider that are many other phytochemicals in Cat's Claw which provides benefits and work synergistically with the alkaloids. These include glycosides, triterpenes, phenols, phytosterols and others.  When a nautral product is chemically alterered to standardize it to just one of these phytochemicals (like alkaloids), it will also alter and sometimes eliminate these other important phytochemicals.  We have not seen a full spectum analysis of available standardized Cat's Claw extracts which show what is happening to the other phytochemicals found in the natural bark during the chemically altered standardization process.<P>


<B>The Cat's Claw Liquid Extracts; An even bigger confusion.</B><P>

Klaus Keplinger's group in Austria are, by far, the most knowledge in the subject of Cat's Claw, having researched it and its extraction methods for over ten years and filed three patents on the alkaloids in Cat's Claw.   The following is quoted from some of Keplinger's published information to Doctors and Pharmacists which can be found in "Cat's Claw, A Documentation" but has not been widely distributed in the U.S.:<P>

<I>Quoted from an English translation of: "Radix Uncaria tomentosae: Informative Literature by Klaus Keplinger"  by the Title of "Der Krallendorn Tee" </I>
<blockquote>
	<I>"Introduction:<br>
	    The active substances in the Cat's Claw Tea are alkaloids which occur in the plant and its watery extract as a complex bound to tannins. In this form, only little of them can be absorbed or activated. The complexes get split by the acidic milieu of the stomach; the alkaloids get transformed into their hydrochloride form and, in this way, get well absorbed.<BR>
	    It is therefore, important to beware of giving Cat's Claw Tea along with antacids or H2-blockers. The Cat's Claw Tea is also ineffective when there is no stomach acid available due to a diseased condition. Based on experience, however, only a few milligrams HCL suffices for the conversion."</I>
</blockquote><P>
It is well known in herbal medicine that plants containing both alkaloids and tannins will form a complex that reduces or eliminates the bioavailablity and therefore benefits of either phytochemical.  Many herbalists will not combine different plants with active constituents of  both  alkaloidal and/or tannic forms  in a herbal formula for this reason.<P>

Ground Cat's Claw bark capsules and tablets are usually effective (with exceptions noted above) because the stomach acid dissolves the complex and releases the tannins from the alkaloids.  When the consumer is taking cat's claw for stomach or bowel disorders, capsules are preferred because the alkaloids are released immediately into the site of action where it is needed. <P>

If there is not enough stomach acid due to a diseased condition, a teaspoon of cider vinegar or lemon juice in 2-4 ounces of water is recommended to take with the capsules.  Also when brewing cat's claw tea, a spoonful of lemon juice in the tea while it is seeping will increase the bioavailability of the alkaloids.<P>

Bark tannins are responsible for much of the coloring in herbal extracts.  Many of the available cat's claw extracts are dark red to dark reddish-brown and consumers incorrectly believe, that "the darker the color - the more concentrated the extract".  This is not true!  In fact with Cat's Claw, the opposite is true.  A darker cat's claw extract means more tannin has been extracted and is present and the beneficial alkaloids of the bark are locked up within these tannins which have formed  a poorly absorbed complex.<P>

When a concentrated extract is taken by mouth, more extract is absorbed sublinqually in the mouth, throat and upper stomach than ever hits the lower stomach and/or the  stomach acid.  Consumers believe that sublingual absorption of these extracts will get the active constituents more quickly into the blood stream, however with these  high-tannin extracts this is not correct. The sublingual absorption of these Cat's Claw alkaloid-tannin complexes greatly reduces bioavailablity, and greatly reduces the benefits and desired results that the alkaloids can provide.  <P>

If  consumers are using these types of high-tannin extracts, they should be informed of the best method of use to counteract this problem.  Sublingual absorption should be avoided! The desired dosage of extract should be placed in at least 6 ounces of water to minimize the sublingual action and to get the solution to the stomach acid.  Again, adding lemon juice or vinegar to the water and extract will help to increase the bioavailability of these high-tannin solutions and release the alkaloids from the tannins.<P>

The Cat's Claw liquid extract offered under the Raintree Nutrition label is very different than any other  available liquid extracts.  In addition to developing and utilizing a proprietary extraction method, Raintree uses organic apple vinegar in place of the water or alcohol of other extracts.  This natural acid releases the alkaloids from the tannins in the manufacturing process and very little tannin is extracted.  This can be evidenced in the light golden color of  Raintree's finished extract.  For this reason also, the assayed alkaloid content of Raintree's liquid extract is 3-5 times higher than other available water/glycerine or alcohol extracts (which for the most part aren't bioavailable unless you are administering it as described above). Using vinegar in the process is  not only releasing the alkaloids from the tannins, it is actually extracting more alkaloids from the bark in the process.  Sublingual absorption of this type of extract can be more beneficial in getting the alkaloids into the system more quickly.<P>

We'd also like to take this opportunity to correct some misinformation that has circulated about a contraindication of use with cat's claw in this regard.  Some marketers/labelers and authors show that cat's claw is contraindicated in ulcers or use with ulcer medications. This is only because of the lack of stomach acid or the presence of antacids reduce or eliminate the ability of releasing the alkaloids from the tannin complex by the stomach acid as described herein. It is not because the cat's claw will irritate or worsen ulcerous conditions.   In fact, some recent studies with cat's claw have shown it to be effective in reducing ulcer formation in mice and rats when they chemically induced ulcers in a laboratory.  If you follow the methods described herein by pre-extracting the alkaloids with lemon juice or vinegar in tea or water, it is possible overcome the problems of taking cat's claw in these conditions.

Gourd Family<BR>
The Gourd Family comprises about 90 genera and some 700 species, mostly coarse climbing annual and perennial herbs of tropical and subtropical regions around the world, extending even into the temperate zones.  The fruit is usually a fleshy berry, often called a pepo, and many cultivated varieties have been important as foods.  A number of tropical species are believed to be toxic.  The family is classified into two quite distinct sections on the basis of morphology of the tendrils and seeds; and nine tribes primarily of floral characters and pollen types.  Some of the larger, hard-shelled fruits provide gourds (Lagenaria, Trichosanthes).  Species with edible fruits, such as pumpkins, squashes (Cucurbita) and melons (Cucumis) have been cultivated for millennia and have developed many strains or "varieties." There are several medicinally valuable species, and some are considered in primitive societies to be poisonous or to have value as medicines.<BR>
Alkaloids have been reported in the family which, however, is noted for a class of compounds called the cucurbitacins.  Saponins, sterols, phenolics are also known.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">1. </A>"Una de Gato is considered one of the most important botanicals in the rainforest.  In Peru, Una de Gato tea is used as a medicinal herb with almost unlimited curative properties.  This herb is a powerful cellular rejuvenator.  It has been used for the treatment of gastritis (inflammation of the stomach), ulcers, cancer, arthritis, rheumatism, irregularities of the female cycle, and acne.  It is also used to treat organic depression. External applications of Una de Gato include the treatment of wounds, fungus, fistulas and hemorrhoids. European research shows that Una de Gato activates the immune system by increasing lymphocytic (white blood cell) activity. Other sources commend the effectiveness of leaf compresses against venereal diseases like syphilis.  It has a positive treatment effect in cases of rheumatic disorders, neuralgias, chronic inflammation (vaginal or intestinal), and viral diseases like herpes zoster (shingles).  It can also help restore proper intestinal flora and has diuretic properties."<P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">2. </A> "Una de Gato from the Peruvian rainforest is a favorite for stimulating the immune system.  World wide research done on this powerful herb has led scientists to patent many of the single chemicals found in it for use in healing cancer, arthritis, AIDS and other diseases.  However, traditional wisdom shows that using the whole plant can be far more powerful than any one isolated ingredient. Dr. Brent W. Davis referred to Una de Gato as "the opener of the way" because of its remarkable ability to cleanse the entire intestinal tract.  Because of this ability, Una de Gato can be used for Crohn's Disease, hemorrhoids, parasites, leaky bowel syndrome, ulcers, gastritis, allergic disorders, diverticulitis, stabilizing intestinal flora and other gastrointestinal issues. Una de Gato is also a powerful anti-inflammatory which makes it very useful for arthritis and other inflammatory diseases.  It also helps to increase T-lymphocyte and microphage production, tonify the blood, and can be used as a broad spectrum infection fighter.  Una de Gato also helps repair the lipid matrix in the cell walls and is particularity good for stopping the expansion of virus laden cells. At the University of Milan, Renato Rizzi led an experiment with Una de Gato as it relates to cancer causing (mutagenic) substances in smokers.  It is well known that the urine of smokers contains mutagenic substances.  When given Una de Gato for two weeks, the smoker's urine returned to normal.  This is important because it shows Una de Gato can help lesson the risk of developing cancers and other degenerative diseases."<P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">3. </A>"ACTIONS:  Immune system booster,  Tumor inhibitor,  Infection fighter, Dispels inflammation. TRADITIONAL USE:  It is considered one of the most important botanicals in the rainforest.  By supporting and enhancing immune system function, Una  De Gato is indicated in a broad spectrum of  conditions including all types of infections.  Urarina tribesman of Peru tell stories of Una De Gato curing tumors.  Una De Gato was one of the plants research by the National Institute for Health as an anticancer agent.

Widely used in Peru for antiinflammatory, contraceptive, and cytostatic activities, the plant has yielded an antiinflammatory antiedemic glycoside (JNP54(2):453. 1991).  In Piura, the bark decoction, considered antiinflammatory, antirheuniatic, and contraceptive, is used in treating gastric ulcers and tumors (FEO).  In her latest edition, Nicole Maxwell (1990) has added much information which may reflect the potential of the cat's claw.  She informs us that Sidney McDaniel submitted samples to the NIH cancer screen."<P>

<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">11. </A> "The most powerful immune-enhancing herb is Una de gato.  Research from 1970 through the present (by Klaus Keplinger and others in Austria, Germany, England, Hungary and Italy) has shown beneficial effects of Una de gato in the treatments for cancer, genital herpes, systemic candidiasis and AIDS.  Six alkaloids isolated from the plant root have been found to significantly enhance the ability of the white blood cells to attack, engulf and digest harmful micro-organisms or foreign matter, thus assisting the process of phagocytosis in the body.<BR>
	My own preliminary studies on the immune-enhancing properties of Una de gato have uncovered the following:
<OL>
<LI>An ability to stop viral infections in the early stages (when an individual feels an infection starting and/or already has a fever, fatigue, muscle aches and sore throat).  One patient reported that his viral infection symptoms cleared within 8 hours after taking Una de gato.
<LI>An ability to help patients who are chemically-sensitive, decreasing the fatigue which accompanies this problem and reducing the severity of symptoms. 
<LI>An ability to significantly enhance emotional stability, even in the midst of extreme stress from personal problems.  One patient commented, "I just can't get depressed anymore, no matter what happens.  It's this Amazon herb!"
<LI>An ability to help the body fight infections better in AIDS patients.  One patient reported, "I ran out of the fungicide for the skin rash on my face and used a bacteriocidal agent until I could get a new prescription.  The bactericide didn't work and the rash started coming back.  I used Una de gato and after just three days, the rash cleared up on my face.  I feel that it's my own body working against the fungus as a result of the Una de gato."
<LI>An ability to decrease the visible size of some skin, tumor or cyst growths within two weeks.
</OL>
Una de gato also has anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties.  These properties explain its usefulness in the treatment of arthritis, bursitis, allergies and numerous bowel and intestinal disorders.  There have been several case histories cited in literature where Una de gato has been linked with the remission of intractable brain and other tumors and give relief to the side-effects of chemotherapy."<P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">21. </A>"RUBIACEAE<BR>
Madder Family<BR>

One of the largest of the plant families and extremely well represented in the northwest Amazon, the Rubiaceae has 7000 species in 500 genera.  Although it is cosmopolitan, most of the species are tropical.  The family is a very natural group, but distinction between some of the genera is frequently difficult and controversial.  Two subfamilies, based on the number of ovules per locule, and four tribes with 19 groups have been recognized, but a more recent classification dividing the family into three different subfamilies and 29 tribes based on a variety of characters has been proposed.  Many ornamentals are rubiaceous.  The family is best known as the source of coffee, quinine, a dye (madder) and ipecac.<BR>
The family is rich in chemical constituents of potential biodynamic activity.  These include iridoids, several types of alkaloids, triterpenes and their glycosides, sterols, anthraquinones, naphthalene derivatives, polyphenols, tannins, cyanogenic compounds and a few other miscellaneous products.  The family has been reviewed as a source of emetine type alkaloids (Wiegrebe, 1984).<BR>
<B> Uncaria</B> Schreber<BR>
The 60 species of  this genus are pantropical.  They are coarse, scandent shrubs, climbing by means of spines.  One Asiatic species is a commercial source of tannin.
Alkaloids of the yohimbine and roxburghine types, oxindole bases, catechin and catechin tannins are reported from the genus.  Rutin has been found in U. elliptica (Balz, 1979), ursene carboxylic acids in U. thwaitsii (Herath, 1978) and biflavonoids in U. gambler (Monaka, 1980).  Effects of the alkaloids on blood pressure (Endo, 1983) and on muscle contraction (Harada, 1976) have been studied.<BR>
<B>Uncaria guianensis</B> (Aubl.) Gmelin, Syst. (1796) 370.<BR>
SC 12827,13083<BR>
A tea of this vine is valued amongst the Indians of the Rio Apaporis in the treatment of dysentery.  A similar use of the species is reported from the Guianas (Uphof, 1968).<BR>

"Cajueiro is said to be good for bronchitis and cough.  It is a good throat rinse when there is inflammation of the tonsils. It is used for its aphrodisiac properties and as a general tonic, increasing vitality. The leaves are indicated in cases of intestinal colic and the treatment of diarrhea.  The roots are said to purge the system.  Some sources comment on its ability to reduce glucose in the urine of diabetics."<P>

Juice from green fruits used to treat hemoptysis.  The leaf infusion is used to treat diarrhea.  Oil used for warts; good for teeth.  Wine obtained from fruit is a good antidysenteric.  Seeds used as worm medicine to kill bot-fly larvae (MJP).  A gum like gum-arabic is extracted from sap; fruit juice used as a permanent marker for clothing (SOU).  Bark decoction used to treat diarrhea (RVM).  Important products are: the cashew nuts, and the cashew nut shell liquid, also called cardol.  Containing phenol it is an important raw material for the plastic and resin industry (RVM).  From the tender shoots they make expectorants (RVM).  Fruit juice used for warts.  The "Wayapi" use the bark as a remedy for infants (GMJ).  "Tikunas" use the "apple" juice for flu. (Fruit juice contains three antitumor compounds JAFC 41:1012. 1993.) Bark decoction, taken each month during the menses, is said to be contraceptive (SAR).

Cashew Family, Sumac Family<BR>

This is a family of 60 genera and nearly 600 species of trees or shrubs, rarely climbers, usually with resinous bark.  They are distributed primarily in the tropics of both hemispheres, but some species range into the temperate zones.  It is the family of the mango, cashew nut, poison ivy and other economically important plants.
The family is best known for its phenols and phenolic acids causing serious skin irritation - anacardol, anacardic acid and relatives.  Terpenes, triterpenes, polyphenols and tannins are also common.  Anacardic acid has been reported to have anthelminitic activity (Chattopadhya, 1969).  A review of the toxins has been published (Baer, 1977).<BR>
	<B>Anacardium</B><BR>
	The 15 species of Anacardium are found in the New World tropics; they are small to very tall trees.  The centre of speciation is Brazil.  The most noteworthy economic species is the cashew nut, A. occidentale: the fruit and swollen receptacle are both edible-the fruit yields the cashew nut, the peduncle is fleshy, yellow or red, and is pleasantly acidic.  The bark is resinous in some species and has a gum resembling gum arabic and is valuable for making varnish.<BR>

	G 61; S 3920, 8176; SRS 24037<BR>
		The juice squeezed from the peduncle is considered medicinal against influenza by the Tikunas.  A tea of leaves and bark is ingested in treating diarrhea.  Taken each month during menstruation, a bark decoction is held to be contraceptive.  The chemical principles responsible for the irritating properties of the oil of cashew shell are primarily cardol and anacardic acid. The fresh leaves of SRS 24037 are alkaloid-positive.<BR>

It is reported that after drinking 3-4 cups of tea steadily over a period of time the first symptoms are usually erotic dreams, and then increased sexual desire. Uses: Influential in the treatment of sexual impotence; aphrodisiac, tonic for the genitals. <BR> *Chiang Sing, Cura com Yoga e Plantas Medicinais (Freitas Bastos, Rio de Janeiro, 1979) p. 126."

The three or four genera and 260 species of trees and shrubs occur primarily in tropical America, centered in the Andes and the Amazon basin.  Some are found also in Africa, southeast Asia and Australia.  The principal genus is Erythroxylon, several species and varieties of which are the source of cocaine.  The leaves of one species are used as a stimulant by the Indians in the Andes and the western Amazon; they were widely employed for this purpose long before the Spanish arrived in Peru.	A review of the constituents of the family and its taxomony has been published (Hegnauer, 1981).

<A HREF="refkey.htm">21.</A>  "LEGUMINOSAE<BR>
Pea Family, Bean Family, Pulse Family<BR>
One of the largest of the plant families, the Leguminosae, with 600 genera and approximately 13,000 species, is cosmopolitan.  The species show an extraordinary diversity of habits: herbs, shrubs, trees, lianas, aquatics, epiphytes and xerophytes.  Some-especially those inhabiting xerophytic regions-are armed with thorns.  Many have roots with nitrogen-fixing bacterial nodules which serve to enrich the soil with nitrates.  The rotation of leguminous crops with non-leguminous plants was practiced by the ancient Romans.<BR>
The Leguminosae is of inestimable value to mankind, second in economic importance only to the Gramineae or grasses.  Undoubtedly, its greatest significance lies in its food value because of its high content of protein, and often starch and oil as well (peas, various beans, lentils), making leguminous species usually an essential element of the human diet.  Some leguminous plant is part of the diet of every race of man.  Numerous species are also excellent animal feed (alfalfa, lupines, lespedeza, clover), and the flowers of many are sources of honey.  The legumes supply gums (tragacanth, arabica); resins, dyes (indigo, logwood, brazilwood); timbers (rosewood, locust, acacia); medicines (senna, licorice, tamarind); poisons (locoweeds), fish poisons (Tephrosia, Lonchocarpus, Derris); narcotics (yopo, mescal bean, jurema); essential oils (Acacia, black locust); vegetable oils (soy bean, peanut).  Some 150 species of legumes are grown as ornamentals.<BR>
This large family is the source of many biodynamic constituents.  It is one of the richest families in alkaloids.  Several reviews have appeared: alkaloids (Salatino, 1981), phenolic compounds (Salunkhe, 1982), flavonoids (Torck, 1976), phytoalexins (Ingham, 1982).  The antibiotic and toxic effects of mimosine (Mendoza, 1982), toxic factors in tropical species (Di Mello, 1982) and a book on the chemistry and biochemistry of the family (Arora, 1983) have been published.  The literature is extensive.<BR>

<B>Erythrina </B>Linnaeus<BR>
There are more than 100 species of Erythrina-trees, shrubs, and rarely herbs with woody rootstocks.  They occur in the tropical and subtropical regions of both hemispheres, rarely in temperate areas.  Most species are heavily armed with spines.  The branches take root easily, and many species are employed as living fences or hedges.  Several are fish poisons.  The flowers of some are edible.<BR>
A few have alkaloids used as medicine or as insecticides; alkaloids are prominent in the species which have been chemically examined.  A review of their chemistry has appeared (Chawla, 1983).  The alkaloids of E. indica (Nguyen, 1983) and E. americans (Aguilar, 1981) have been described as hypnotic.  Cyanogenic glucosides were found in E. americans (Lucas, 1984) and E. sigmoidea (Formum, 1983) and isoflavonoids in E. cristigalli (Inamura, 1981).<BR>

<A HREF="refkey.htm">11.</A> "Sarsaparilla to increase circulation, clear toxins and stimulate metabolism."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">13.</A>"Sarsaparilla's medicinal use has been as a tonic and a blood purifier. A blood purifier or depurative refers to an agent that cleanses and purifies the system. Sarsaparilla's reputation in this regard probably stems from its importation from the Caribbean and South America to Europe in the sixteenth century for the treatment of syphilis.<BR>
	During military operations in Portugal in 1812, a British Inspector General of Hospitals noted 	that the Portuguese soldiers suffering from syphilis who used sarsaparilla recovered much faster and more completely than their British counterparts, who were treated with mercury.<BR>
	Sarsaparilla was also used by the Chinese in the treatment of syphilis.  Clinical observations in China demonstrated that sarsaparilla is effective, according to blood tests, in about 90 percent of  acute cases and 50 percent of chronic cases.<BR>
	An interesting note is that sarsaparilla species have been used all over the world in many different cultures for the same conditions, namely gout, arthritis, fevers, digestive disorders, skin disease, and cancer.<BR>
  	The mechanism of action of sarsaparilla is largely unknown, although the plant does contain several saponins and has been shown to be clinically effective in the treatment of psoriasis. This evidence points to a possible effect on binding of cholesterol and bacterial toxins in the intestines.<BR>
	Evidence seems to support sarsaparilla as an endotoxin binder.  Endotoxins are cell wall constituents of bacteria that are absorbed from the gut.  Normally, the liver filters out these and other gut-derived compounds before they reach the general circulation.  If the amount of endotoxin absorbed is excessive or if the liver is not functioning adequately, the liver can become overwhelmed, and endotoxins will spill into the blood.  In a controlled study of ninety-two patients, an endotoxin-binding saponin (sarsaponin) from sarsaparilla greatly improved the psoriasis in 62 percent of the patients and resulted in complete clearance in 18 percent."<P>

<A HREF="refkey.htm">14.</A>"Smilax is another herb with a reputation as a remarkable tonic and male rejuvenator.  This herb has been receiving considerable attention lately, but not of a research nature.  Rather it has become a favorite of the body-building crowd.  Is there any justification for this interest?<BR>
	As a tonic, smilax has been used primarily to increase vitality and virility, and is used throughout 	Central and South America and some parts of southern North America to treat the symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases.  This practice has even spread to Europe.  Chinese physicians verified the antisyphilis property of sarsaparilla.  In clinical observations, its effectiveness on primary syphilis was rated at 90 percent. Allowing  for some halo effect, the results are still staggering. This may help explain how the herb came to used that way in Europe.  It was simply effective.<BR>
	Worldwide opinion also concurs on other uses for smilax, including an anti-inflammatory effect in arthritis and gout, and a detoxification effect in cancer and skin disorders.<BR>
	The effectiveness of smilax in the treatment of skin disorders, such as the acne of adolescence caused by raging androgens, has received some experimental support.<BR>
	The tonic effect of smilax may be the result of its ability to stimulate the removal of accumulated waste products from the cells, blood and lymph.<BR>
	One final note: Smilax contains a wide variety of saponins, mainly sarsasapogenin, smilagenin, sitosterol and stigmasterol.  These substances commonly occur in plants with immune enhancing action, in the adaptogens, in tonics, and in herbs used for their nutritive value.  Smilax saponins have not been investigated thoroughly, but they may hold the key to the popularity of the plant for body-building purposes.  Sarsaparilla saponins have, for example, been used in the synthesis of sex hormones."<P>

<A HREF="refkey.htm">21.</A>"SMILACACEAE<BR>
Sarsaparilla Family<BR>

The four genera and 375 species of the Smilacaceae are mainly tropical and subtropical climbing shrubs; a few species occur in temperate zones.  The family is very closely allied to the Liliaceae, in which some taxonomists classify the members which we consider here as a separate family.  Several species are sources of commercial sarsaparilla; some species are of value as medicines.<BR>
Steroidal glycosides and occasional flavonoids have been found in Smilax.  More recently, glutamic acid derivatives have been reported from S. china (Kasai, 1984), choline and acetyl choline from S. hispida (Miura, 1984) and diosgenin from S. zeylanica (Kar, 1984).<BR>

	"Gerard, in his Great Herbal, mentions that the Honduran and Peruvian sarsaparilla "are a remedy against long continual pain of the joints and head, and against the cold." Spanish "sarza parilia", S. aspera, he takes to be similar, but weaker in action(11).<BR>
	According to Monardes, the Spanish botanist, Mexican sarsaparilla was introduced into 	European medicine about 1536 at Seville (12).  Other species soon followed from Guatamala and Honduras.  They were highly regarded as a remedy for syphilis, which was also imported from the new world in the late 1400's, and for rheumatism.  From Spain, the herb found its way into the pharmacists shops all over Europe and England.<BR>
	Few plants have had the rise and fall in popularity that sarsaparilla has had.  When it was introduced it was considered remarkably effective for diverse chronic diseases, and many doctors of the time wrote about its benefits.  Generally considered an alterative tonic, blood purifier, diuretic and diaphoretic, it was given alone or in combination with other herbs, as well as with mercury for long-standing venereal disease.<BR>
	Pereira, a leading physician in London in the mid-nineteenth century, felt that sarsaparilla works 	when "the malady is of long continuance, and the constitution is enfeebled and emaciated, either by the repeated attacks of the disease, or by the use of mercury," and that it is "the great restorer of a appetite, flesh, colour, strength and vigour."<BR>

<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">14. </A>"For reasons unknown at this time, echinacea in high doses tends to promote continued immune system stimulation rather than balanced immune function.

	"Of the many immunomodulators in the plant kingdom, I think the best are lapacho, echinacea, astragalus, yerba mate', licorice root and all species of ginseng."<BR>	"Smilax together with ginseng and yerba mate' would act to enhance the physical development of muscle tissue. These would help oxygenate cells and help them burn calories. The entire musculoskeletal system would benefit.". . .<BR>
	" Last but certainly not least, I believe a modern elixir should address energy production. The solution in a liquid extract is to combine the only really good herbs for this effect, yerba mate' and ginseng species. First, it contains significant amounts of the South American herb yerba mate'.This would give the product a natural energy wallop not shared by other liquid herbal extracts. This natural energy would not interfere with the ability to sleep. On the contrary, it would help regulate sleep cycles and produce a better sleep. It would also allow one to work longer without fatigue, get more done, and feel better about doing it.

For one of them, Damiana, such a reputation was even carried into its botanical name, Turnera aphrodisiaca.  Actions: Nerve tonic, anti-depressant, urinary antiseptic, laxative. Indications: Damiana is an excellent strengthening remedy for the nervous system.  It has an ancient reputation as an aphrodisiac.  Whilst this may or may not be true, it has a definite tonic action on the central nervous and the hormonal system.  The pharmacology of the plant suggests that the alkaloids could have a testosterone-like action (testosterone is a male hormone).  As a useful anti-depressant, Damiana is considered to be a specific in cases of anxiety and depression where there is a sexual factor.  It may be used to strengthen the male sexual system."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">15.</A>  "Mexican damiana is classed as aphrodisiac, stimulant, tonic, and diuretic. The herb has been scientifically accepted in Mexico as a reliable remedy for exhaustion, catarrhal inflammation of the bladder, and cases of sexual impotence especially when caused by excesses.  It is also used for orchitis (inflammation of a testicle) and spermatorrhea (involuntary emissions). The plant is said to exert a favorable influence on the spinal column, and some Mexican physicians employ it as a brain tonic. It is also prescribed in nephritis (kidney inflammation).<BR>
In England and Germany, damiana is used for its aphrodisiac properties. In Holland, medical herbalist Steinmetz states that the herb is so esteemed not only for its sexual enhancing qualities, but also for "its excellent effect on the reproductive organs."

"These tubers have been used in some cultures as a coffee substitute.  It helps support the spleen, lungs and kidneys.  Dioscoreae contains up to thirteen percent diosgenin.  Diosgenin has been processed and given to patients to relieve arthritis, asthma, eczema, regulate metabolism and control fertility.  Diosgenin provides the steroid building blocks for developing human sex hormones and can be used for developing muscle mass and strength.  It has been used for emotional instability, chronic cough, diarrhea, and diabetes."<P>

<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">9.</A> "Botanical name: Dioscorea oppositae   Pharmaceutical name: Radix Dioscoreae Oppositae. English: Chinese Yam Root.  Properties: sweet, neutral.  Channels entered: Spleen, Lung, Kidney. Functions and clinical use: Tonifies and benefits the Spleen and Stomach: used in cases of Deficient Spleen or Stomach with such symptoms as diarrhea, fatigue, spontaneous sweating, and lack of appetite.  Benefits the Lungs and nourishes the Kidneys: used for Wasting and Thirsting syndrome.  Because this herb moistens and is neither hot nor cold, it benefits both the Yin and the Yang of the Lungs and Kidneys.  It is also used for spermatorrhea, frequent urination, and leukorrhea."<P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">14.</A>  "Wild yam root has been used for hundreds of years to treat rheumatism and arthritis-like ailments.  The discovery of steroidal glycosides (diosgenin) in the root validated this ancient practice.  Most species of yams contain large amounts of plant steroids, primarily diosgenin, a saponin precursor in the synthesis of progesterone.  Without the yams, the industrial complex would not be able to meet the worldwide demand for synthetic corticosteroids.  But with them, scientists can derive animal or human steroids in a fairly straightforward multi step process.  Wild yams are the only really good source of plant steroids for such purposes.<BR>
Diosgenin provides about 50 percent of the raw material for steroid synthesis.  It must be emphasized that there is not an equivalency between diosgenin and human steroids.  It takes many synthetic steps to get from one to the other.  If yam has steroidal effects on the body, it is not because it contains steroidal hormones, but because the steroidal precursors have similar effects.  The body does not recognize them or mistake them for its own hormones, but uses them in a similar manner.<BR>
Research has shown that yam, yam extract and/or diosgenin possess good to excellent anti-inflammatory action.  In one series of studies, yam was found to induce a short-lived decrease  in blood pressure and an increase in coronary flow when injected intravenously into rabbits.  Also in rabbits, the saponins of yam, fed orally, prevented large increases in blood cholesterol levels.  The good therapeutic effect of dioscorea saponins on patients with atherosclerosis combined with hypertension was confirmed in Clinical practice.<BR> The British Herbal Pharmacopoeia recognizes wild yam root as a spasmolytic, mild diaphoretic, anti-inflammatory, antirheumatic and cholagogue, for use in the treatment of intestinal colic, diverticulitis, rheumatoid arthritis, muscular rheumatism, cramps, intermittent claudication, cholecystitis, dysmenorrhea, and ovarian and uterine pain.  Bilious colic and rheumatoid arthritis are specific indications for the use of yam."

"Dong quai has been called the "female ginseng" and is excellent as an all purpose women's herb.  It has been used for centuries in China for regulating the menstrual cycle and easing menstrual pain and cramping.  It can be used to help women regain normal menstrual cycles after taking "the Pill." It has proven helpful for relieving hot flashes during menopause.  Dong quai can be used for insomnia and blood pressure stability for both men and women. (The affect on blood pressure can be an overall lowering although sometimes it may rise slightly first, followed by a decline).  It can reduce PMS and may help anemia, suppressed menstrual flow, uterine bleeding, abdominal pain after childbirth, dry intestines, chronic pelvic disorders and constipation and headaches due to blood deficiency.  Dong quai helps the liver utilize more oxygen and therefore can be useful in treating hepatitis and cirrhosis.  It may also help with abnormal protein metabolism.  Dong quai helps dilate peripheral blood vessels, increase circulation, and has been used as a mild laxative.<BR> <B> PRECAUTION: </B>Not to be used during pregnancy."<P>

"The root, dang gui [Angelica sinensis], is valuable in anemia and menstrual pain, or as a general tonic after childbirth. It clears liver stagnation  (of both energy and toxins) and can relieve constipation, especially in the elderly."<P>

<B>Properties:</B> sweet, acrid, bitter, warm.<BR>  <B>Channels entered: </B>Heart, Liver, Spleen<BR>
<B>Functions and clinical use:</B> Tonifies the Blood and regulates the menses: used for Deficient Blood patterns with such symptoms as a pale ashen face, tinnitus, blurred vision, and palpitations.  Used also for Deficient Blood patterns with menstrual problems such as irregular menstruation, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, etc. Invigorates and harmonizes the Blood: an important herb used to stop pain from Congealed Blood.  Commonly used for abdominal pain, traumatic injuries, and carbuncles from Congealed Blood.  Used also in the treatment of Deficient Blood with chronic Wind Damp Painful Obstruction. Moistens the Intestines and moves stool: used for Dry Intestines from Deficient Blood.<BR>
<B>Cautions and contraindications: </B> Use cautiously in diarrhea or cases of abdominal distension due to Damp Obstruction.<BR>
<B>Pharmacological and clinical research: </B> Effect on the uterus: as long ago as the 1920s, decoctions of Radix Angelicae Sinensis (Dang Gui) on the uterus was the object of research.  At that time it was shown to have a contractile effect when given intravenously to anesthetized dogs and rabbits.  The exact mechanism or ingredient that is responsible for this effect has not been elucidated, but it does cause contractions in in situ uteri and relaxation in uterus specimens.  In some studies using direct measurement of the myometrium, administration of Radix Angelicae Sinensis (Dang Gui) enabled the contractions of the uterus to be more orderly.  In the opinion of some researchers, this may be the mechanism underlying its effectiveness in treating dysmenorrhea.  The herb does not appear to have any estrogenic effect.
<P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">13.</A> "For several thousand years. Dong quai has been cultivated for medicinal uses in the treatment of a wide variety of disorders, in particular "female disorders". It is often referred to as "female ginseng.". In Asia, angelica's reputation is perhaps second only to that of ginseng. Predominantly, regarded as a "female" remedy, angelica has been use to treat such conditions as dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation), amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), menorrhagia (abnormal menstruation, menopausal symptoms (especially hot flashes), and to assure a healthy pregnancy and easy delivery. Angelica is also used in the treatment of abdominal pain, anemia, injuries, arthritis, migraine headache, and many other conditions.  Some of the pharmacological activities demonstrated include phytoestrogen activity, analgesic activity, immunomodulating activity and antibacterial activity."<P>

<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">14.</A>  "Next to Panax ginseng, the root of dong quai is undoubtedly the most honored and respected herb in China, and is quickly gaining an equal reputation among users in the rest of the world..  Dong quai is used medicinally as a tonic, cardiotonic, respiratory tonic and liver tonic.  It is used to promote circulation, to regulate the menstrual cycle and stop discomforts of menstruation.  That means it's good for PMS.  In Western herbal terms, it is used for dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation), metrorrhagia (too much menstruation) and amenorrhea (too little, or no, menstruation).  Dong quai is also often recommended during pregnancy to ease delivery, reduce pain and discomfort and eliminate complications as much as possible. Most of the actions of  dong quai depend on the presence of coumarins, phytosterols, polysaccharides, and flavonoids.<BR>
	Dong quai contains estrogenic substances that may exert some regulating effect on estrogen levels and on estrogenic biological mechanisms.  They seem to enhance estrogenic effects when estrogen levels are too low, and compete when levels are too high.  This would be in keeping with the idea of a menstrual tonic.  It is doubtful if dong quai has any direct estrogenic effects.<BR>
	Substantial pharmacological research has validated these properties in dong quai.  Anticramping, hypotensive, tonic, antiasthmatic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic properties in the root have all been demonstrated by basic research.  It has also been shown to be effective against several strains of microorganisms, especially fungi such as Candida albicans, the primary causative agent in vaginal yeast infections.  This constellation of properties would help explain the plant's sometimes dramatic effect on the PMS symptoms."

<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">14.</A>  "Its very name suggests the primary application of balm - a soothing, calming agent for stressed nerves.  Balm, like the various members of the mint family, is invigorating and yet relaxing to the nervous system because it is highly aromatic.  These effects are felt throughout the body, and have earned balm the reputation of being a mild panacea.<BR>
Balm is a common constituent of  relaxants, nervines and sleeping aids throughout the world.  Seldom used alone, it seems to interact with and enhance the activity of other beneficial tonics for the nervous system. In folk medicine, balm is used as a stomachic (to reduce turmoil in the GI tract), antispasmodic (to reduce tension and cramping in both smooth and striated muscle throughout the body), and carminative (to neutralize the effects of gas on the stomach and intestines).  Balm is frequently employed in treatments for female discomforts of all kinds, for nervous system problems, for insomnia, cramps, headache, muscle tension and soreness.  Science has yet to investigate the medicinal properties of balm thoroughly, yet what work has been done has established the nervine, antispasmodic, antihistamine, carminative,  and antimicrobial properties of the plant."<P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">15.</A>  "Balm is classified as antispasmodic, calmative, emmenagogue, carminative, and diaphoretic. Its uses in herbal medicine are many, but it is especially valued as a soother of nerves and a reliever of tensions, especially for women troubled by the stress of PMS or by the emotional upset that may accompany menstrual or menopausal problems.  Balm is also used to ease menstrual cramps, and as an emmenagogue it is recommended in cases of delayed menstruation."

"Abuta has been traditionally used by women who have problems with their menses.  Midwives in the Amazon carry Abuta with them for menstrual cramps and pre- and postnatal pain.  They report that it prevents threatened miscarriages.  In Ecuador, it has been known to stop uterine hemorrhages during childbirth and it is used by men for inflammation of the testicles. Abuta is helpful for kidney stones, other minor kidney problems, and acts as a diuretic."

<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">8.</A> 
"Brazilian uses and Folklore: Abuta is a very useful herb for women's affections. It's antispasmodic action makes it influential in treating cramps, painful menstruation and pre and post-natal pain. Brazilian Indian women have for centuries valued its analgesic powers, and satchels of almost all midwives contain the root of this plant. In their book, "Medical Botany" (John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1977) Walter H. Lewis and Memory Lewis state, "Cissampelos Pareira roots are used in tropical countries to prevent a threatened miscarriage. The herb is also used to stop uterine hermorrhages" (p. 324)  Uses: Helpful for menstrual cramps and difficult menstruation, pre and post-natal pain. Aids poor digestion, drowsiness after meals and constipation. Also used in homeopathy, in the form of a mother tincture."<P>

<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">11.</A>"Abuta is used by men in the Amazon for inflammation of the testicles.  It is also helpful for kidney stones and other minor kidney problems.  Other herbs from the Amazon which help establish balance during the menstrual cycle or during menopause include Abuta, Maracuja, Marapuama, Star anise and Una de gato.  Many of these herbs do this indirectly by regulating the nervous system.  Abuta is always carried by midwives in the Amazon for menstrual cramps and pain before and after childbirth.  They report that it prevents miscarriages.  In Ecuador, it has also been known to stop uterine hemorrhages"<P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">21.</A>"MENISPERMACEAE
Moonseed Family<BR>
The Menispermaceae comprises 65 genera and approximately 400 species native to the tropics and subtropics of both hemispheres; a few are found in temperate regions of North America and Asia.  They are mostly lianas, sometimes small trees or shrubs and occasionally perennial herbs.  The family is divided into eight tribes based on characters of the fruit and seeds.<BR>
Alkaloids of several structural types are found in the family along with well characterized isoprenoid bitter principles.  Saponins and sterols are common; occasional triterpenes, ethereal oils, polyterpenes, and polyphenols also are present.   Reviews of the alkaloids in general (Kametani, 1976), the aporphine alkaloids (Guinaudeau, 1975) and their role in the preparation of curares (Martini-Bettolo, 1981) have been published.  One of the alkaloids, isoboldine, is said to have insecticidal activity.<BR>
<B> Cissampelos</B> Linnaeus<BR>
The 30 or 40 species of vines occur in the tropics of both hemispheres.  The genus contains alkaloids characteristic of other members of the family.<BR>
	<B>Cissampelos pareira </B> Linnaeus, Sp.  Pl. (1753) 1031.<BR>
	Garcia-Barriga (1974)<BR>
	    This woody climber, according to Garcia-Barriga, is "one of the principal components of 	    curare." It occurs widely in Colombia, including the Amazon region.  The Ketchwas of      Ecuador use it as an arrow poison.<BR>

"Alcachofra is Brazilian artichoke.  It effectively flushes uric acid from the system and is used as a diuretic.  It increases gall bladder secretions and is used as an auxiliary remedy for digestive disorders.  Liver disorders, especially those associated with alcoholism and malaria benefit from Alcachofra.  It is thought to have a cleansing and healing effect on both the liver and gall bladder. Alcachofra's high content of iron nourishes the blood.  It has also been found to decrease cholesterol and blood pressure.<B> Caution:</B> Avoid if breast-feeding.  Alcachofra may decrease milk production."

"Artichoke leaf has a reputation as a choleretic (stimulates bile), diuretic and general stimulant.  It helps to neutralize excessive acid in the body.  It has been used for jaundice and dropsy."

"ACTIONS:  Aids elimination of uric acid,  Fortifies liver and gallbladder, Nourishes blood.  TRADITIONAL USE: Alcachofra (Brazilian Artichoke) has a cleansing and healing effect on the liver and gallbladder. Also know to neutralize acidity in the system. High in nutrients known to have diuretic effects.  Flushes uric acid from the system.  Augments the secretion of bile.  Used as an auxiliary in the treatment of liver and digestive disorders.  Nourishes the blood and relieves arterial pressure.  Helpful in treating rheumatoid arthritis.
MERIDIAN INDICATIONS: Clears liver congestion, Nourishes liver blood, Increases Kidney Yang
EAV POINTS: Liver, Gallbladder, Spleen."<BR><P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">14.</A>  "Artichoke extract and/or cynarin, the main active consituent, has cholagogue [increases bile production by the liver]/ choleretic [increases flow of bile from the gallbladder] / choliokinetic action [ increases the contractive power of the bile duct].<BR>
	Research has shown that caffeic acid, a component of cynarin, is almost as effective as pure cynarin, suggesting that caffeic acid is the substance responsible for the choleretic action.<BR>
Artichoke has been shown to increase the production and volume of bile flow by as much as four times normal in a 12-hour period.<BR>
	Artichoke protects liver from poisonous effects of toxins in a manner similar to silymarin from milk thistle.  It is able to prevent liver damage from the same wide range of poisons as milk thistle.  Artichoke extract is also able to stimulate the regeneration of liver cells in much the same manner as does silymayin. The usefulness of artichoke for preventing blood and liver cholesterol elevation in the presence of toxins such as alcohol is also of note.  Application in today's world would also include the prevention of liver damage due to air-, water- and food-borne toxins.  A French patent describes an artichoke extract for treating liver disease, high cholesterol levels and kidney insufficiency. Cynarin, and not pure caffeic acid, appears to be the component most responsible for this action.<BR>
	Artichoke has lipid-producing and anticholesterolemic action. Artichoke reduces blood fats.  It reduces cholesterol and cholinesterase levels.  In simplest terms, the net effect of artichoke extract appears to be the result of both an activation of and an interference with cholesterol metabolism.  That is, it mobilizes fat stores from the liver and other tissues such as white adipose tissue, and these fats pour into the blood from which they are subsequently excreted from the body. Cynarin decreases the rate of cholesterol synthesis in the liver, enchances biliary excretion of cholesterol, and increases conversion towards the bile acids.  Not only cholesterol but other blood fats such as triglycerides can be reduced through the use of artichoke."<P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">15.</A>  "Scientific evidence supports the use of artichoke as a liver remedy. Cynarin is the active ingredient contained in the plant, and its highest concentration is in the leaves. According to reports, cynara (artichoke leaves) extract has demonstrated significant liver regenerating and protecting effects."

"Alfalfa has been used for centuries by people world-wide for overall support and rejuvenation.  Because of its deep root system, alfalfa is a rich source of the minerals calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, iron, potassium, and trace minerals.  Specifically, it is one of the best sources for protein and is very high in chlorophyll, carotene, the vitamins A, D, E, B-6, K, and several digestive enzymes.  This may be why it is said to help reconstitute bone and when fresh, is beneficial for rickets. Alfalfa is one of the most studied plants.  Research suggests that it may inactivate dietary chemical carcinogens in the liver and small intestine before they have a chance to do the body any harm. It is commonly used for bladder infections. Used on the skin or in the bath, Alfalfa is good for fatigue or muscle tenderness.  It is also used to reduce the pain and inflammation of rheumatism and arthritis. Alfalfa is used as an appetite stimulant, a vitality augmenter (tonic), a digestive stimulant, for insomnia, and to relax the nervous system."<P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">2.</A> 
"Because of a long root system which absorbs abundant minerals, alfalfa is very high in minerals and vitamins, particularly iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, trace minerals and vitamin K. It helps to remove toxins and neutralizes acids.  It is good for anemia, menopause, arthritis, gout, stabilizing blood sugar levels, balancing the pituitary gland, and detoxifying the blood and kidneys.  Alfalfa helps soothe ulcers, the liver and acts as a heart tonic.  It helps with estrogen production and morning sickness.  It has in it a natural fluoride and is a mild diuretic.  Alfalfa may be used for reducing fevers and rheumatism and has a mild laxative effect.  It is good for cystitis or an inflamed bladder and relief from bloating and water retention."<P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">5.</A> 
"High in chlorophyll and nutrients. Alkalizes the body and detoxifies the body, especially the liver. Good for all colon disorders, anemia, hemorrhaging, diabetes, ulcers, and arthritis. Promotes pituitary gland function. Contains an antifungus agent."<P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">14.</A>   Alfalfa contains an enormous quantity of nutrients, in a form that is easily digested and assimilated by man.  It is up to 50% protein, contains a good quantity of beta-carotene, chlorophyll and octacosanol. Herbalists have used alfalfa for many different purposes. Most of those applications bear a one-to-one correspondence to the various nutrients in the plant. The one word that keeps appearing is "tonic". The plant is a kidney tonic, prostatic tonic, reproductive tonic, musculoskeletal tonic, glandular tonic and so forth.  Alfalfa has traditionally been one of the best herbal treatments for arthritis, gout, and rheumatism. Clinical research suggests that atleast one or two persons in ten will respond very well to the use of alfalfa, experiencing an almost total reduction in painful symptoms. Alfalfa has a proven cholesterol-lowering effect. Steriodal anti-inflammatory action is suggested by its content of plant steriods, and by some research that found an estrogenic effect on ruminants (grazing animals).  Alfalfa has also been shown to possess antibacterial action against gram-negative bacteria (such as <I>Salmonella typhi</I>), and it contains atleast one protein with known antitumor activity."

It has been used for colic in children, as an antispasmodic, and an antifungal.  It can help prevent fermentation and gas in the stomach and bowels, thus relieving bloating and belching after meals.  Anis is a mild diuretic and can stimulate added production of milk in nursing mothers.  It has been mostly used for digestion issues including indigestion, nausea and gallbladder cleansing.  It can also help asthma, bronchitis, and insomnia.  Folklore says that if you place anis in your pillow it will ward off bad dreams."<P>

"Boldo's medicinal properties were discovered when sheep grazing in a field of Boldo no longer had constipation and liver trouble.  Its fragrant minty leaves contain an essential oil that is useful for digestive upsets, liver and bile problems, and kidney and urinary tract illnesses. In Chile, it is customary to use Boldo as a vermifuge to kill intestinal worms. (A vermifuge is a substance that helps eliminate parasites.) Chronic digestive problems such as gas and poor digestion respond well to this bile-stimulating herb.  It reduces excess gastric acidity and is often used as a treatment for gall bladder stones. Boldo is one of the most popular herbs in South America and is considered to be an excellent general tonic."

"Boldo is a widely used herb in South America.  It has been used to treat liver, gallbladder and bowel dysfunctions.  It helps promote fat digestion by stimulating the secretion of bile.  It helps neutralize acid and is good for digestion.  It has been used in Latin America for urogenital inflammations such as gonorrhea.  Elsewhere it has been used for gout, hepatitis, rheumatism, syphilis and worms.  It has been shown to be an antiseptic and diuretic which is good for urinary infections and uric acid elimination."

"Boldo is a specific for gall-bladder problems like stones or inflammations. It is also useful when there is visceral pain due to other problems in the liver or gall-bladder. Boldo has mild urinary demulcent and antiseptic properties and so would be used in cystitis.  Actions: Cholagogue, hepatic, diuretic, sedative."<P>

<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">8.</A> 
"Brazilian uses and folklore: "The medicinal uses of this plant were discovered by chance. One day many years ago, a Chilean shepherd perceived that his sheep were livelier and healthier than before and were no longer suffering from constipation and liver trouble.  He investigated and discovered that his flock was eating the leaves of a certain plant - there being no other vegetation around.  This plant was Boldo, and since then it has been used by man, in the form of a tea, to help treat liver and bowel dysfunctions.  Boldo tea is also an excellent general tonic for the organism. In 1874 Doctors Bougin and Verne did some scientific research on the plant.  They extracted from the leaves of Boldo an alkaloid which came to be known as Boldina.. Many people believe that this alkloid is the reason Boldo is so helpful. Boldo helps the liver function well.  The liver is the builder of the blood, and blood nourishes the body.  Boldo is also influential in treating chronic affectations of the digestive organs. Uses: Useful in treating symptoms of liver dysfunctions and diseases (hepatitis, liver congestions), constipation, gases and poor digestion.  Acts as a tonic for the organism, helps combat weakness,dizziness."<P>

<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">18.</A> "The dried leaves of Peumus boldus Mol. (family Monimiaceae), an evergreen shrub native to Chile, have an ancient reputation as a "hepatic tonic," diuretic, and laxative.  The herb contains about 2 percent of a volatile oil, the principal constituents of which are ascaridole, eucalyptol, and p-cymol, About 0.25 to 0.5 percent of an alkaloidal mixture is also present.  Boldine, an aporphine alkaloid, constitutes about one-fourth of the total; the remainder consists of about 16 different alkaloids.59 Boldine is responsible for both the choleretic and diuretic activity of the leaves.64 Although the herb may increase the flow of urine substantially, the mechanism of action is still unknown, so it is uncertain if  boldine's action is one of true  diuresis or simply aquaresis, as is the case with most herbs in this category.<BR>
Although Commission E has approved the use of  boldo for the treatment of dyspepsia as well as for stomach and intestinal cramps, it must be noted that the volatile oil in the leaves contains about 40 percent ascaridole, a rather  toxic component.  Since no chronic toxicity testing has been carried out, Hansel has recommended that prolonged use of the herb or any consumption by pregnant women be avoided."<BR>

<center><h3>REFERENCED QUOTES ON CHAMOMILE</h3></center>
<blockquote>
<a href="REFKEY.htm">1.</a>
"Chamomile has calming and soothing properties.  It is used for nervousness, headaches, anxiety, and hysteria.  It is also beneficial for colds and flu. Its antispasmodic properties (See herbal fact at the bottom of this page.)  benefit cramps and spasms
, probably due to the easily assimilable form of calcium found in it.  One tablespoon steeped in a covered cup of boiling water with two slices of fresh ginger is reported to be a very effective treatment for menstrual cramps and other pains and spasms.
Chamomile is frequently used for digestive complaints and taken regularly will gently regulate the bowels.  The same tea may be used for minor digestive problems such as acid indigestion and gas, weak stomach, stomach pains, lack of appetite, and colic p
ain.  It is also effective against intestinal parasites, like worms. Chamomile has tonic, diaphoretic (causes sweating), and analgesic (pain-relieving) properties."<p>
<a href="REFKEY.htm">2.</a>
"Chamomile is a slightly bitter herb that helps soothe nerves, increase mental awareness, settle the stomach and promote digestion.  It is used as a tea to calm hyperactive children, menstrual cramps, and asthma.  It is a diuretic and has been used for b
ladder problems.  It helps with fevers, colds, headaches, insomnia, rheumatism, relieving gas and expelling worms.  Chamomile is good for the liver and lungs and helps reduce jaundice, swelling, and ease withdrawal from drugs.  It acts as a mild laxative
 and can bring on menses.  It is good for crying, whining babies and helps soothe the pain of teething.  Chamomile can be used as a mouthwash for gingivitis and externally for inflammation."<p>
<a href="REFKEY.htm">4.</a>
"Medicinal Action: and Uses: Tonic, stomachic, anodyne, and antispasmodic. It has a wonderfully soothing, sedative and absolutely harmless effect."<p>
<a href="REFKEY.htm">5.</a>
"A good nerve tonic, sleep aid, appetite stimulant, and digestive aid. Relieves the bladder, colds, asthma, colitis, diverticulosis, fever, headaches, hemorrhoids, muscle cramps, and pain.  Effective in the treatment of rheumatism, arthritis, worms, and
jaundice. Warning: Do not use for long periods of time. Do not use if allergic to ragweed."<p>
<a href="REFKEY.htm">7.</a>
"Chamomile is renowned for its medical and household uses. The apparently endless list of conditions it can help all fall into areas that the relaxing, carminative and anti-inflammatory actions can aid. It is an excellent, gentle sedative, useful and saf
e for use with children."<p>
<a href="REFKEY.htm">14.</a>"Chamomile contains a wide variety of active constituents, each of which comes to the fore under certain conditions and plays an important supportive role in other situations. Thus bisabolol is thought to be the major anti-inf
lammatory constituent, but the total anti-inflammatory effect of whole chamomile depends upon the presence of the flavonoids, such as apiginine and luteoline. Likewise, for years researchers attributed the antispasmodic effect to the flavonoids, but it h
as recently been demonstrated through numerous trials that other constituents also contribute substantially to the total sedative action.  Furthermore, the importance of chamazulene and its precursor, matricine, has been demonstrated in virtually all of
the actions of chamomile.  Chamomile is as much used as a carminative as a mild sedative. One of the most amazing things about chamomile is that, in spite of the fact that the herb was being used throughout Europe and North America for the treatment of a
cute and chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions, for heartburn, for constipation, for stomachache, and so forth - in spite of all that, it wasn't until 1979 that experimental verification of its protective and healing effect on the mucosa of th
e GI tract was reported."<p>
<a href="REFKEY.htm">15.</a> "German Chamomile is classed as sedative, anodyne carminative, and tonic. It has a well-established reputation as a remedy for soothing the nerves, strengthening digestion, and relieving certain forms of colic."<p>
<a href="REFKEY.htm">18.</a>"Another extremely popular herb for the treatment of indigestion, as well as various other conditions, is chamomile. . .   Its popularity as a traditional medicine is so great that in Germany it was declared the medicinal plan
t of the year for 1987.50
        The literature on the chamomiles is extensive.  Die Kamille, a 152-page book by H. Schilcher, provides comprehensive coverage. 51  Mann and Staba's 1986 review is the most recent one in the English language. 52 It provides 220 references to various agro
nomic, botanical, chemical, and pharmacological aspects of the herbs.

                The chamomiles are used internally for digestive disturbances.  Like peppermint, they possess carminative (antispasmodic) effects, but unlike peppermint, they exert, in addition, a pronounced anti-inflammatory  activity on the gastrointestinal tract.
In this country, chamomile tea is most widely used for this purpose.   The German Commission E considers German chamomile effective internally for gastrointestinal (GI) spasm and inflammatory conditions of the GI tract.  It was also found to be effective
 when used as a mouthwash for irritations and minor infections of the mouth and gums."<br>

to.  The most common use in this region is for rheumatism.  To prepare the herb for pain, the bark is soaked overnight in cane liquor, and the resulting tincture is drunk.  In Colombia, the Siona Indians take a "piece of the trunk" (5 cm) and boil it in
water (two liters) until the decoction reduces to half.  To "cure" arthritis and rheumatism, they take "a small cupful" three times a day for a week.  They also regard the decoction as a stimulant.  In the lowland rain forest of eastern Ecuador, the Quij
os Quichua Indians use the stem-bark of chucchu huashu (trembling back).  A decoction of chucchu huashu (Maytenus krukovii A.C. Smith) is taken for rheumatism, aching muscles, menstrual aches, stomach aches, and general aching.  For rheumatism, the males
 occasionally take the herb steeped in alcohol.  For a blood-building tonic, the reddish inner bark of this species, which is described as extremely bitter, is chewed or decocted.  This is given to patients recovering from tuberculosis or who display a p
ale complexion, and to those suffering from bronchitis, stomach ache, or fever.  No limit is placed on the quantity the patient may drink, but it must be taken before breakfast for a period of one month."<p>
<a href="REFKEY.htm">17.</a>  "Tourist shops selling tribal artifacts were opening everywhere, and many of the better bars were beginning to serve some jungle drinks, especially chuchuwasi.  That is probably the best known of all jungle remedies, in Colo
mbia as well as Peru.  It is also a favorite drink, second only to aguardiente in popularity among men living along the rivers.<br>
Chuchuwasi is prepared by chopping the root bark of a very large tree, Maytenus ebenfolia (Celastraceae), and letting it steep for a week in aguardiente or white rum.  The resulting infusion is one of numerous jungle potions known as "aphrodisiacs." Thes
e are reputed to cure male impotence, whether due to age or illness, and to enhance the virility of the healthy.  But more important are the claims made for its ability to cure all types of rheumatism, and to act as a general tonic for women as well as m
en.  I have seen it restore to good health two women who had each, for some months, been in a very debilitated state of health from some undiagnosed illness.  And I know many people who insist that it is the best of all antirheumatic medicines.  I have a
lso heard reports of its curing cancer and, after several months' dosage, restoring to normal activity an arm paralyzed by long contact with a toxic insecticide."<p>

The bark of this tree is famous in the western Amazonia as a medicinal for a number of ailments.  It is soaked usually overnight in aguardiente which is then drunk as a pain killer-almost always in connection with rheumatism-and as a stimulant.  This use
 is most frequent amongst people living in urban societies; Indians not commonly in communication with more advanced inhabitants usually do not consider this plant to be such an important medicine.  However, a species of Maytenus from the Rio Ica in Braz
il contains in its aril 0.85% caffeine and is used locally as a diuretic (Fiese, 1935).<br>
According to Garcia-Barriga, the Sionas boil a 5 cm piece of the trunk in two liters of water and reduce the liquid to one liter.  This decoction is taken thrice daily over a week-one small cupful each time-to "cure" rheumatism and arthritis.  It is also
 valuable as a stimulant.<br>

<a href="REFKEY.htm">22.</a> "Chuchuhuasi (Maytenus macrocarpa (R. & P.) Briq.) is the bark of the trunk or root of a large extremely strong tree that grows in many parts of the Amazon.  Several botanical names are given for the same tree (M. macrocarpa=
M. laevis=M. ebenifolia). 33 <p>
Chuchuhuasi means "trembling back," a name that may refer to its most prevalent uses.48 The bark is commonly soaked in aguardiente rum and taken as a cure for arthritis and rheumatism, and as an aphrodisiac.27,33<p>
In addition to being a treatment for rheumatism and arthritis, in Peru, the bark is boiled to prepare a tea used to treat dysentery, diarrhea, upset stomach, and irregular menstrual perlods.33   In Colombia, the Siona Indians boll a small piece of the ba
rk (5 cm) in water (2 liters) until one liter remains.  To treat arthritis and rheumatism, a cup of the decoction is taken three times a day for more than a week.34<p>
During the 1960s, an American pharmaceutical company discovered that when taken orally by mice, the leaf extract produced a potent stimulating effect on the immune system, and phagocytosis was increased to a significant degree.49  Researchers from the Ca
tholic University in Rome, Italy, learned that the trunk bark is placed in alcohol to make a solution used to treat skin cancer.  After analyzing the bark, they noted it contains high amounts of the naturally occurring antitumor substances tingenone and
pristimeran, compounds classified as triterpenes.50<p>
The constituents responsible for various uses of the tree in folk medicine was the sub'ect of an article by Italian researchers at the Universita Cattolica del S. Cuore in 1982.  Extracts of the trunk bark of the Colombian chuchuhuasi (M. Laevis) had sho
wn definite anti-inflammatory activity.  Based on constituents found in the root bark, they attributed the antiinflammatory and radiation protectant action of a water extract of the trunk bark to antioxidants, such as catechin tannins and procyanidins.
They also deduced that certain triterpenes (tingenone and 22-hydroxytingenone) in chuchuhuasi, having shown antitumor activity, could account for the traditional use of the tree in treatments of skin tumors. 51<p>
Renewed interest in this intriguing herbal medicine appeared in 1993.  Researchers at the Tokyo College of Pharmacy isolated a number of alkaloids from the tree.  They note that in Peru the Indians use the "reddish-brown stem bark" soaked in rum (aguardi
ente) as a tonic extract taken before breakfast to treat rheumatism.52  Perhaps in a few years we will be hearing about their success at isolating the more active constituents of this famous remedy.  In the U.S., Sphinx Pharmaceutical Corporation of Durh
am, North Carolina, has also shown interest in chuchuhuasi.  Their focus is on protein kinase C (PKC)-inhibitory components of the bark of the Ecuadorian chuchuhuasi, Maytenus krukovii. 53  Inhibitors of the PKC enzyme are of great interest today because
 there is evidence the enzyme, in an over-active state, is involved in a wide array of disease processes.  Among the diseases in which PKC may be overtly involved are rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, brain tumors, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.54<p>

"It was more intriguing to learn that like the shaman in Peru, who uses the bark of chuchuhuasi, Professor Accorsi mixed pau d'arco with a species of Maytenus <I>(M. ilicifolia Mart.)</I>, which is commonly known in Brazil as Espinheira santa. And elsewhere in the tropics, there are reports of Maytenus in African folk medicine for treating excessive mucus discharge, wounds,and cancer.<BR>
These plants contain antibiotic compounds that in animals have shown potent antitumor and antileukemic activities at very low dosages (of micrograms per kilogram of  body weight).  In Brazil, as part of ongoing research with local herbs to find cancer treatments, earlier clinical studies found good results with the compound mayenin, a quinoid triterpene derived from the roots of <I>Maytenus ilicifolia</I>. Applied topically to treat carcinomas, it showed little irritation .Other tests using the compound intravenously in patients with resistant carcinomas found best results in epidermal carcinoma (larynx, tongue base, and tonsil pillars).  No toxic effects were found, but neither were there any "cures". It appears that the best results are from topical uses, just as indicated by folk medicine.<BR>
Records in Brazil hold that the leaves of espinheira santa <I>(Maytenus ilicifolia)</I>, which appear remarkably like those of  holly, are applied as an analgesic (pain reliever), an intestinal antiseptic, and a tonic. Applications of the leaves include an ointment for treating skin cancer and a decoction as a wash for cancers.  Other names in Brazil include limaosinho and cancerosa . This is the species Professor Accorsi combined with Pau d'arco.<BR>
According to various herbalists in Brazil, espinheira santa is widely available and more commonly used for such problems as acne, anemia, stomach ulcers, cancer of the uterus, and constipation.  Comparable activity to a well-known anti-ulcer drug (cimetidine) was shown with a water extract of two Maytenus species <I>(M. aquafolium and M. ilicifolia) </I>in animals.  Gastric ulcers, chronic gastritis, and dyspepsias have long been treated with Maytenus in Brazilian folk medicine, but this was the first time an anti-ulcerogenic effect was demonstrated scientifically.  Oral administration showed a protective effect against ulcer formation.  Maytenus also caused an increase in gastric juices and a higher pH."<P>

"Fennel helps to release gas from the stomach and bowels and relieve its associated pain and cramping.  It helps to clear phlegm from the lungs.  It can act as a stimulant and diuretic which calms the nerves, improves appetite and digestion, and acts as an antispasmodic.  It is helpful for nursing mothers as it promotes lactation and calms colic.  Fennel helps regulate energy to the spleen, stomach, liver and kidneys and can be used topically for joint inflammation.  The dried powder is said to keep fleas away from kennels and stables.  Folklore indicates it can be used as a poultice for cancerous wounds and indurations (hardening) of the mammary glands."<P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">4.</A> 
"Medicinal Actions and Uses: On account of its aromatic and carminative properties, Fennel fruit is chiefly used medicinally with purgatives to allay their tendency to griping and for this purpose forms one of the ingredients of the well-known Liquorice Powder."<P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">5.</A> "A sweet herb used as an appetite suppressant and as an eyewash. Promotes function of the spleen, liver and kidneys, and also clears the lungs. Used for acid stomach. It relieves gas, gastrointestinal tract spasms, abdominal pain, and colon disorders. Effective in the treatment of gout, and good for the cancer patient after chemotherapy and radiation."<P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">6.</A>  "Actions: Carminative, circulatory stimulant, anti-inflammatory, promotes milk flow, mild expectorant, diuretic.  Soothing for the digestion, the seeds also promote milk flow in breastfeeding.   CAUTION: Fennel is a uterine stimulant, so avoid high doses of the herb in pregnancy; small amounts used in cooking are safe."<P>
<A HREF="REFKEY.htm">9.</A>"Botanical name: <I>Foeniculum vulgare.</I>  Pharmaceutical name: Fructus Foeniculi Vulgaris Properties: acrid, warm.   Channels entered: Stomach, Liver, Kidney.  Functions and clinical use:  Regulates Qi and alleviates pain: used to warm and encourage movement in the Live Channel or the Lower Burner as in Cold hemia-like disorders, or any kind of lower a dominal pain from Cold.  Warms the Middle Burner and opens the Stomach: used for Cold Stomach patterns wit such symptoms as abdominal pain, indigestion, decreased appetite, and vomiting.<BR>
	Pharmacological and clinical research:Gastrointestinal effect: the oil of Fructus Foeniculi Vulgaris <I>(Yiao Hui Ciang)</I> regulates the peristaltic functions of the gastrointestinal tract, thereby reducing emptying time and increasing the passage of gas.  It also relieves spasms of the intestines.  This latter effect is destroyed by local anesthesia and therefore may be caused by a nervous reflex.  Antibiotic effect: anethole contributes to the inhibitory effect of streptomycin against tuberculosis in guinea pigs, but has no effect by itself. Treatment of hernias: in one series of 26 patients with incarcerated hernias, preparations of Fructus Foeniculi Vulgaris <I>(Xiao Hui Xiang) </I>given orally reduced the hernias in 22 cases.  After the preparation was administered, the patients were asked to lie supine with their knees bent.  Usually the hernia and symptoms were reduced within half an hour.  If there was no resolution within one and a half hours, surgery was immediately performed.  The principal factor that determined the outcome was the duration of the incarceration: the longer the duration, the less effective the treatment. Use in urology: a preparation of Fructus Foeniculi Vulgaris <I>(Xiao Hui Xiang)</I>, together with salt and other ingredients taken at bedtime with rice wine, was used in 64 cases of hydrocele of the tunica vaginalls.  After six weeks, 59 cases were cured and one was improved."

Also used as an antidote to a variety of toxic substances, both internally and topically.<BR>
<B>Cautions and contraindications: </B> Contraindicated in cases of Excess Dampness, nausea, or vomiting."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">13. </A>  "The medicinal use of licorice in both Western and Eastern cultures dates back several thousand years. It was used primarily as a demulcent, expectorant, antitussive, and mild laxative.  Its traditional use include the treatment of peptic ulcers, asthma, pharyngitis, malaria, abdominal pain, insomnia and infections. Licorice is known to exhibit many pharmacological actions, including estrogenic, aldosterone-like; anti-inflammatory (cortisol-like); antiallergic; antibacterial, antiviral; and anti-Trichomonas; antihepatotoxic; anticonvulsive; choleretic; anticancer; expectorant; and antitussive activities. Although much of the pharmacology focuses on glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid, remember that licorice has many other components, such as flavonoids, that may have significant pharmacological effect."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">14. </A>  "Licorice can be recommended for just about everybody, for male and female alike, young and old, well or sick.  It is the grand tonic of the world, in this author's opinion. For that reason, I recommend it as an important tonic in the maintenance of the musculoskeletal system.  The amazing anti-inflammatory actions of licorice root extend to the entire surface area of the body, both outside and inside.  Not only the skin, but the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal tract yield to the soothing and healing action of licorice root.  The plant reinforces the body's ability to withstand attack from virtually any kind of pathogen, and should therefore be considered a tonic for the musculoskeletal system. If one is looking for a broad-spectrum tonic to protect, maintain health, and heal injuries, there is no herb better than licorice root."<P>

<A HREF="refkey.htm">6.</A>  "Actions: Astringent, stops bleeding, diuretic, anti-inflammatory, tissue healer.  Its brittle jointed stems are rich in healing silica, and since the time of the Ancient Greeks, horsetail has been used for wounds.  The astringent, healing stems check bleeding in wounds, nosebleeds and heavy menstruation. A strong diuretic for urinary tract and prostrate disorders, they also tonify the urinary mucous membranes, can control bed-wetting, and help with skin problems. The other main use is for deep-seated damage in lung disease."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">7. </A>"Horsetail is an excellent astringent for the genito-urinary system, reducing hemorrhage, and healing wounds thanks to the high silica content. Whilst it acts as a mild diuretic, its toning and astringent actions make it invaluable in the treatment of incontinence and bed wetting in children. It is considered a specific in cases of inflammation or benign enlargement of the prostrate gland."<P>

<A HREF="refkey.htm">14.</A>  "Externally, both the American Indians and the Chinese use horsetail to stop bleeding and accelerate the healing of wounds and broken bones.  The effectiveness of horsetail in external applications is related to the solubility of silica in the fluids of wounds or in the poultice materials, and its absorption directly into blood and cells at the site of the wound.<BR>	Internally, horsetail is often used as a source of minerals, especially silica and calcium, in a form that can be easily used by the body in the production and repair of bone, skin and connective tissue.  As a diuretic and astringent it is widely used in the treatment of genitourinary problems such as gravel and inflammations.  Europeans, Asians, and Americans use horsetail in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, cystitis, cramps of the bladder, kidney stones, enuresis, lithiasis, dropsy, internal bleeding, fevers, eye disease, nephritis, cystic ulceration, gonorrhea, gout rheumatism, and miscellaneous hemorrhaging conditions of the bladder, kidneys and prostrate.  Horsetail has even found its way into folk medicine treatments for cancer.<BR>	Research in Europe has shown that horsetail stops bleeding and helps build up the blood.  It also possesses good antibiotic action.  The use of horsetail to treat atherosclerosis is also currently being validated in European research. Modern research has validated long-standing folk medicine practices of using horsetail to mend connective tissue and bone."<P>

<A HREF="refkey.htm">1.</A> "There are 25-30 species of Peppermint.  It is a stimulant, a tonic, and helps digestive system disorders.  Studies have found that it is effective for the treatment of conditions such as dysentery.  It is an anti-diarrheal agent, a vermifuge (a substance that works well against worms) working especially well against hookworms, and it is often used to stimulate bile flow. Peppermint's antispasmodic properties have produced a total and immediate resolution of blockage of Oddi's sphincter (located in the intestinal tract) in animal studies. Because of its anti-inflammatory properties, Peppermint is used to treat rheumatism. Laboratory research studies with Peppermint have found antiviral, antifungal and antibacterial activity."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">2.</A> "Peppermint is known in Columbia as "heirba buena" or the "good herb" and has been classically used as a digestive aid.  It helps stimulate the stomach, cools indigestion, relieves flatulence, strengthens and soothes the bowels and helps with cramping.  Peppermint also stimulates excretion of saliva and warms the entire system.  It stimulates menstruation, the bronchioles and sinuses.  It is said to help with diverticulitis, insomnia, headaches, nausea, nerves, morning sickness and congested lungs."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">3.</A> "Peppermint works on the salivary glands, the first process in digestion. It acts as a sedative to the stomach and helps strengthen the bowels. Peppermint strengthens and soothes the bowels, helping to avoid cramping."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">4. </A>"Peppermint oil is the most extensively used of all the volatile oils, both medicinally and commercially. The characteristic anti-spasmodic action of the volatile oil is more marked in this than in any other oil, and greatly adds to its power of relieving pains arising in the alimentary canal. From its stimulating, stomachic and carminative properties, it is valuable in certain flatulence and colic. <P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">5.</A>  Peppermint, Increases stomach acidity. Irritates mucous membranes and the gastrointestinal tract. Use for chills, colic, fever, nausea, diarrhea, heart trouble, rheumatism, convulsions, spasms, and headaches."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">6. </A>"These [peppermints] relax the muscles of the digestive tract and stimulate bile flow, so are useful for indigestion, flatulence, colic, and similar conditions. They reduce nausea and can be helpful for travel sickness; they also promote sweating in fevers and influenza."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">13. </A>"Peppermint is used medicinally to treat indigestion and intestinal colic, as well as colds, fever, and headache. The pharmacology of peppermint focuses almost entirely on its menthol components. Peppermint and menthol possess carminative, antispasmodic, and choleretic properties, and are also used as an external analgesic and nasal decongestant. The mechanism behind peppermint oil's antispasmodic effects has recently been determined. Researchers believe that peppermint oil's inhibition of isolated smooth muscle contractions occurs via blockage of calcium influx into the muscle cells. Researchers hypothesize that the clinical effectiveness of peppermint oil in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome results from inhibition of the hyper contractility of intestinal smooth muscle, thereby returning the muscle to its proper tone.  The pharmacological effects of peppermint and peppermint oil are useful in a number of clinical situation; the most notable include irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal colic, gallstones, musculoskeletal pain, and the common cold."<P>

<A HREF="refkey.htm">14.</A>"Peppermint is one of the most popular tonic herbs known to modern man.  Its use as a flavoring agent is well known.  Medicinally, it is mainly used to aid the various processes of digestion: combating gas, increasing the flow of bile, healing the stomach and liver, etc.  The active constituents are found in the essential oil, mainly menthol and carvone.<BR>The volatile ingredients of peppermint make it an ideal choice for invigorating the mind, for improving the mood and relaxing a tension-filled, anxiety-ridden nervous system.  These properties of  the oils have been experimentally verified, as have the spasmolytic, antiulcer, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.<BR>The spasmolytic property of peppermint has been established through comparisons with a wide variety of convulsant drugs, including acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin, anaphylaxotocin.  The smooth muscle spasmolytic effect is exerted primarily on the neuromuscular junction.  Peppermint extract has been found to decrease the tone of the lower esophagus sphincter so that the escape of air is made easier."<P>

<A HREF="refkey.htm">18.</A>"Peppermint oil has long been an extremely popular flavoring agent in  products ranging from chewing gum to after-dinner mints.  It is probably the most widely used carminative, acting in the broad sense defined by Schilcher(40). The German Commission E has found peppermint or its volatile oil to be effective as a spasmolytic (particularly useful for discomfort caused by spasms in the upper digestive tract), a stimulant of the flow of bile, an antibacterial, and a promoter of gastric secretions(46). On the other hand, in 1990, the United States Food and Drug Administration declared peppermint oil to be ineffective as a digestive aid and banned its use as it nonprescription drug for this purpose in this country(47).  What this actually means is that the FDA was not presented with evidence proving the efficacy of peppermint as a digestive aid.  As previously explained, this would not be financially feasible in this country.  It does not mean that peppermint oil is an ineffective aid to digestion."<BR>

Mint Family<BR>

This is a large, cosmopolitan family of 180 genera and some 3500 species, primarily annual or perennial herbs but with some shrubs or climbers; a few are small trees.  The centre of distribution is the Mediterranean area where occasionally they are dominant members of the flora.  Some 60 genera are cultivated in America.  The family is classified in eight groups based on highly technical characters.  It is closely related to the Verbenaceae.  Most of the economically important species are employed because of their essential oils and bitter principles.  Lavender, pachouli, rosemary, sage, spearmint, peppermint, basil, thyme, marjoram, savory, oregano, pennyroyal, catnip, bee balm, horehound, yerba buena, hyssop and others are important as herbs or spices or in perfumery, medicine or other minor applications.  The family is easily recognized because of the zygomorphic flower, one lobe of the corolla of which is altered into a lip.  The stem is usually square.  Most of the species grow in open areas, but some occur as undershrubs; while a few occur in rain-forests, many are adapted to xerophytic conditions.<BR>
The mint family is noted for the accumulation of an assortment of mono-, sesqui-, di- and triterpenes; caffeif acid and flavones are also present. The flavonoids (Zinchenko, 1969), cloeons and rouleonones (Eugster, 1983), tannis and cinnamic acids (Litvinenko, 1975) and the pharmaceutical uses (Wagner, 1977) of the family have been reviewed. Alkaloids have been reported (Kudryasheva, 1979).<BR>
<B> Mentha</B> Linnaeus<BR>
	The 25 to 30 species of mints-erect, branching herbs, twining shrubs or trees comprise this genus.  Many are perennials with leafy runners, stolons or underground rootstocks.  Almost all have essential oils and half a dozen species are cultivated.  All are native to north temperate regions, Australia and South Africa.  About half of the species are native to or naturalized in North America.<BR>
Two recent reviews of the constituents, their chemistry, bioactivities and medicinal importance have appeared (Baslas, 1983, 1983a).<BR>
The Tikunas take one-half cupful of leaf-decoction thrice daily to treat diarrhea. A Tikuna treatment for stomach ache consists of a hot leaf-decoction in single-cup doses.<BR>

Spurge Family<BR>

This family of 300 genera and around 5000 species of trees, shrubs and herbs is almost cosmopolitan.  It is so variable in structure that there have been suggestions that it may be polyphyletic.  It is economically important, providing foods, rubbers, medicinals, oils, dyes and other useful products.  Most species have a white latex; that of some members of the family is highly toxic or caustic.<BR>
Classification of the subfamily divisions needs careful revision.
The family is rich in constituents of potential biodynamic activity.  The inflammatory, tumor-promoting and antitumor actions of the diterpenes (Evans, 1983), the chemical and biological properties of the alkaloids and triterpenoids (Hirata, 1975), as well as those of the diterpenes (Schneider, 1979) have all been reviewed.  Much of the recent work on the chemical and pharmacological properties of the genus Euphorbia has also been summarized (Baslas, 1981, 1982; (Van Os, 1981).  Digestive tract neoplasms are referable to the irritating substances found in several species of Euphorbia (Hecker, 1984).<BR>
<B>Alchornea</B> Swartz<BR>
There are 70 species of this pantropical genus.  They are shrubs to medium-sized trees.
The insect antifeedants of A. triplinervia have been studied (Hankinson, 1982); alkaloids have been found in A. floribunda (Khuong-Huu, 1972); the structure of the alkaloid alchomeine has been established (Cesario, 1970).<BR>

	Amongst the Tikunas, a decoction of the bark, in one-tablespoon doses before meals, is considered to be a treatment for diarrhea.  The crushed leaves are also rubbed on painful  joints for relief.  In Venezuela, a species of Alchornea is used in the form of cataplasm for wounds inflicted by the sting ray.<BR>

<A HREF="refkey.htm">21.</A>  "LEGUMINOSAE<BR>
Pea Family, Bean Family, Pulse Family<BR>

One of the largest of the plant families, the Leguminosae, with 600 genera and approximately 13,000 species, is cosmopolitan.  The species show an extraordinary diversity of habits: herbs, shrubs, trees, lianas, aquatics, epiphytes and xerophytes.  Some-especially those inhabiting xerophytic regions-are armed with thorns.  Many have roots with nitrogen-fixing bacterial nodules which serve to enrich the soil with nitrates.  The rotation of leguminous crops with non-leguminous plants was practiced by the ancient Romans.<BR>
The Leguminosae is of inestimable value to mankind, second in economic importance only to the Gramineae or grasses.  Undoubtedly, its greatest significance lies in its food value because of its high content of protein, and often starch and oil as well (peas, various beans, lentils), making leguminous species usually an essential element of the human diet.  Some leguminous plant is part of the diet of every race of man.  Numerous species are also excellent animal feed (alfalfa, lupines, lespedeza, clover), and the flowers of many are sources of honey.  The legumes supply gums (tragacanth, arabica); resins, dyes (indigo, logwood, brazilwood); timbers (rosewood, locust, acacia); medicines (senna, licorice, tamarind); poisons (locoweeds), fish poisons (Tephrosia, Lonchocarpus, Derris); narcotics (yopo, mescal bean, jurema); essential oils (Acacia, black locust); vegetable oils (soy bean, peanut).  Some 150 species of legumes are grown as ornamentals.<BR>
This large family is the source of many biodynamic constituents.  It is one of the richest families in alkaloids.  Several reviews have appeared: alkaloids (Salatino, 1981), phenolic compounds (Salunkhe, 1982), flavonoids (Torck, 1976), phytoalexins (Ingham, 1982).  The antibiotic and toxic effects of mimosine (Mendoza, 1982), toxic factors in tropical species (Di Mello, 1982) and a book on the chemistry and biochemistry of the family (Arora, 1983) have been published.  The literature is extensive.<BR>

Hymenaea has two dozen species of tall unarmed, resiniferous trees distributed in tropical parts of South America, Mexico and Cuba; the centre of speciation lies in the Amazon.  Some yield excellent varnish resins.  One, H. courbaril, has a yellowish or orange-colored resinous gum, collected in lumps at the base of the tree or by wounding the bark; it is employed as incense in churches and in the manufacture of varnishes.
Terpenes and phenolics are responsible for the inhibition of growth of leaf fungus on these plants. (Arrhenius, 1983).<BR>

Nightshade Family, Potato Family<BR>

The Solanaceae comprises up to 3000 species in some 90 genera of herbs, shrubs and a few trees.  It is cosmopolitan, occuring around the world except in the arctic areas; its principal centre lies in Andean South America.  The family has been divided into five tribes based mainly on ovarian structure.  It is one of the most important economic families, a source of many useful species: numerous ornamentals, edible fruits (tomato, egg plant, green peppers, tree tomato, Cape gooseberry, pepino, cocona, naranjillo; a fumatory (tobacco), medicines and narcotics (belladonna, mandrake, datura, etc.); poisons (deadly nightshade, henbane, etc.); a starchy tuber (white potato); a spice (red pepper).<BR>
The chemistry of the family is complex but, because of its economic importance, is well known.  Tropane alkaloids are characteristic of some sections of the family, steroidal alkaloids of others and several miscellaneous structural types are found.  Polyphenols including benzoic acids, coumarins and flavonoids, tannins, steroidal saponins and sapogenins, steroidal lactones, pentacyclic triterpenes, resins, waxes, and ethereal oils along with the pungent principles of Capsicum have all been recorded in the family.    

<B> Solanum </B>Linnaeus<BR>
With some 2000 species of great variability in form and ecological preference, this genus is one of the largest of the Plant Kingdom.  It occurs in temperate and tropical regions around the world and includes herbs, shrubs, vines, often small trees; some species are climbers, a few are stongly spiny.  The genus is the source of numerous toxic and medicinal species as well as several food plants: the white potato (Solanum tuberosum), the eggplant (S. melongena), the pepino (S. muricatum), and the naranjillo (S. quitoense).  The tomato is frequently classified as a species of Solanum, but it is now evident that its assignment to the allied genus Lycopersicon is fully warranted.
The genus is rich in potentially biodynamic principles, particularly alkaloids (Ripperberger, 1981) which are of the tropane, steroid and other miscellaneous types.<BR>

<B>Plant Medicine's Importance Stressed by CSU Professor</B><BR>
"Frank Stermitz, professor at Colorado State University, believes that plant medicine has become important again, and, although some plant study is a random process, many leads to potentially useful plants come from folklore.  Stermitz says,"A number of pharmaceutical companies now have groups of researchers looking at the medicinal potential of various plants in endangered areas of the tropical rain forest." He concentrates on folklore plants found in Costa Rica and Peru.<BR>
The Incas have described thousands of plants," he says.  "One book I read claims 30% of the plants are still actively in use in Peru.  It's a poor country, there are few doctors there and people use plants for human medicine."<BR>
Among the plants Stermitz and his colleagues recently identified which showed promise as medicinal tools are <B>Lepidium meyenii,</B> a tuber from the high Peruvian Andes that the Indians recommended as a fertility aid for humans and animals; Tecoma arequipensis, the bark of which is used in Inca medicine, mainly for hypoglycemia and diabetes; and Mussatia hyacinthina, a tree of the high upper Amazon and Bolivia, whose bark is chewed alone or with coca leaves to fight fatigue.  (Rocky Mountain News Sunday Magazine, Nov. 6, 1988)<P>

<B>MACA (LEPIDIUM MEYENII)</B><BR>
"Maca is a root vegetable or tuber related to the potato family.  It grows in the mountains at altitudes of  9 to 11 thousand feet, making it the highest cultivated plant in the world.  Native Peruvians have used Maca as a food since before the times of the Incas for both it's nutritional and medicinal properties.  The herb contains significant amounts of amino acids, carbohydrates and minerals including calcium, phosphorus, zinc, magnesium, iron, vitamins B1, B2,  B12, C and E and a number of steroid glycosides.<BR>

Traditionally Maca has been used to increase energy, stamina and endurance in athletes, promote mental clarity, as an aphrodisiac for both men & women, for male impotence, menstrual irregularities & female hormonal imbalances including menopause and chronic fatigue syndrome.  More recently, athletes are finding Maca to be an excellent alternative to anabolic steroids.  In March of this year I attended the Natural Products Expo West in Anaheim, California.  At the show, I was given a sample bottle of Maca to use while I was there.  I was amazed at how I was able to work long hours maintaining a high energy level throughout the show.  I took approximately 1,000 mg of Maca three times a day along with my usual amount of Cat's Claw.  I will be conducting additional research on the herb and report my findings in future newsletters."<P>

<B> Brunfelsia </B>Linnaeus<BR>
The 40 species of Brunfelsia are woody shrubs or small trees native to tropical South America and the West Indies.  Several species are cultivated as ornamentals in warm regions.<BR>
Species of Brunfelsia are rich in scopoletin, a furocoumarin which is claimed to be antiinflammatory (Iyer, 1977).  An alkaloid, hopeanine, has been described from B. hopeana (Gellert, 1978) and its pharmacology has been reported (Iyer, 1978).  The chemistry and medicinal uses of the genus have been reviewed. (Plowman, 1977).<BR>

	The type collection of Brunfelsia grandiflora subsp. schultesii -SRS 24108-is very positively alkaloidal.  The subspecies is widely cultivated (in Bolivia, Peru and Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela), whereas B. grandiflora itself is still found wild.  Both are employed as additives to the ayahuasca hallucinogen, and both have a broad therapeutic spectrum ranging from the treatment of yellow fever to snake bite.  The most effective parts of the plants are considered to be the roots.  The most widely employed medicinal uses are those to treat syphilis and rheumatism and for their diuretic and diaphoretic properties.  Both are highly regarded as agents to treat fevers because of the curious sensation of chills which they produce.  Brunfelsia grandiflora has been employed as an ichthyotoxic plant; both are toxic to cattle, and subsp. schultesii has been the source of problems to owners of cattle in the Trapecio Amazonico of Colombia.  The Kofans and the Siona-Secoyas of Ecuador utilize this species as a hallucinogen, the latter group using it also as an abortifacient.<P>

<B>Pharmacological and clinical research:</B> Effect on the uterus: decoctions of Fructus Citri seu Ponciri Immaturus (Zhi Shi) from three different provinces (Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Hunan) inhibited uterus specimens from mice and stimulated those from rabbits, as well as stimulating that organ in situ.  These findings were the same for both pregnant and nonpregnant animals.  An alkaloid-like substance from Fructus Ponciri Trifoliatae (Zhi Shi) has a definite contractile effect on uterus specimens from rabbits, especially when under the contractile influence of oxytocin.  When alkaloids were removed from the herb, it produced a relaxing effect on the tissues. Effect on intestines: Fructus Aurantii Immaturus (Zhi Shi) from three different provinces had an inhibitory effect on intestinal specimens and in situ intestines in mice and rabbits.  The effect varied with the dosage, and in some cases very small doses (on the order of 1:10,000) showed a transient inhibition followed by an increase in both the intensity and frequency of peristalsis. Cardiovascular effect: small doses of Fructus Aurantii Immaturus (Zhi Shi) have a stimulatory effect on frog heart specimens, while large doses are inhibitory.  Intravenous administration of decoctions of this herb to anesthetized dogs leads to a marked rise in blood pressure.  It has been noted that there was no reflex drop in blood pressure after the herb had worn off.  While the a receptors appeared to be affected, leading to vasoconstriction, there was actually an increase in coronary, brain, and renal blood flow.  This may be due in part to the positive inotropic effects leading to an increase in stroke volume.  There was a reduction in blood flow through the femoral arteries.  Experiments on animals have shown a low incidence of mild supraventricular arrhythmias from intravenous use of this herb.  This, in addition to the findings noted above, has led some researchers to conclude that this herb may have some use in treating cardiogenic shock."<P>

<A HREF="refkey.htm">21.</A>RUTACEAE<BR>
Rue Family, Citrus Family<BR>
The Rutaceae is distributed in warm and tropical areas of both hemispheres, with its centres of speciation in South Africa and Australia.  There are 150 genera and some 900 species which have been divided into four or five subfamilies on characters of the carpels and structure of the fruit.  Many of the species have oil glands in the leaves.  Commercially, Citrus is the most important genus.  Many species are sources of essential oils of use in perfumery and medicine.<BR>
The family is especially rich in secondary metabolites of potential, if not acutal, biodynamic activity.  These include ethereal oils, a variety of alkaloids, amides, occasional cyanogenic compounds, several types of coumarins, flavonoids, aromatic acids, polyphenols and tannins, lignans, tetracyclic triterpenes, limonoids, a variety of terpenes as well as saponins.  The literature is vast.  Reviews of the berbine alkaloids (Kametani, 1976) and degraded triterpenes (Dryer, 1982) have appeared, as well as a general review of the pharmacologically active compounds of the family (Lewis, 1983).<BR>

<B>Citrus </B>Linnaeus<BR>
The 12 or 15 species of Citrus are small, often spiny shrubs and trees of the tropics and subtropics native to Asia and Malaysia.  A number of the species are cultivated for their edible fruit: citron, orange, sweet orange, lemon, lime, pomelo, grapefruit, mandarin orange and tangerine.  The bergamot orange is valuable in the perfume industry.
Aside from the well known chemical contributions of the genus as sources of essential oils, vitamins, pigments, etc., the chemistry is similar to that of the family as a whole.  The use of the bioflavonoids in medicine and nutrition (Robbins, 1980) and the chemistry of the flavonoids and limonoids (Maier, 1983) have been reviewed.  Additional acridone alkaloids and coumarins have been isolated from C. depressa (Wu,	1983).<BR>

This priest was a diabetic.  In the early 1950's, Friar Luiz Maria heard about a plant that could cure the symptoms of diabetes.  He travelled to Campo Grande in search of a doctor named Christophe, who made preparations from this plant.  Dr. Christophe himself had learned about this plant from the Indians and local farmers.  The Friar met Dr. Christophe, took the extract made from Pata-de-Vaca, and in 40 days he was in fine condition (p. 160). Pata-de-Vaca has been widely used for years, but it is only recently that clinics and pharmacologists have begun to study the plant that has so long received public praise.

<A HREF="refkey.htm">21.</A>  "LEGUMINOSAE<BR>
Pea Family, Bean Family, Pulse Family<BR>
One of the largest of the plant families, the Leguminosae, with 600 genera and approximately 13,000 species, is cosmopolitan.  The species show an extraordinary diversity of habits: herbs, shrubs, trees, lianas, aquatics, epiphytes and xerophytes.  Some-especially those inhabiting xerophytic regions-are armed with thorns.  Many have roots with nitrogen-fixing bacterial nodules which serve to enrich the soil with nitrates.  The rotation of leguminous crops with non-leguminous plants was practiced by the ancient Romans.<BR>
The Leguminosae is of inestimable value to mankind, second in economic importance only to the Gramineae or grasses.  Undoubtedly, its greatest significance lies in its food value because of its high content of protein, and often starch and oil as well (peas, various beans, lentils), making leguminous species usually an essential element of the human diet.  Some leguminous plant is part of the diet of every race of man.  Numerous species are also excellent animal feed (alfalfa, lupines, lespedeza, clover), and the flowers of many are sources of honey.  The legumes supply gums (tragacanth, arabica); resins, dyes (indigo, logwood, brazilwood); timbers (rosewood, locust, acacia); medicines (senna, licorice, tamarind); poisons (locoweeds), fish poisons (Tephrosia, Lonchocarpus, Derris); narcotics (yopo, mescal bean, jurema); essential oils (Acacia, black locust); vegetable oils (soy bean, peanut).  Some 150 species of legumes are grown as ornamentals.<BR>
This large family is the source of many biodynamic constituents.  It is one of the richest families in alkaloids.  Several reviews have appeared: alkaloids (Salatino, 1981), phenolic compounds (Salunkhe, 1982), flavonoids (Torck, 1976), phytoalexins (Ingham, 1982).  The antibiotic and toxic effects of mimosine (Mendoza, 1982), toxic factors in tropical species (Di Mello, 1982) and a book on the chemistry and biochemistry of the family (Arora, 1983) have been published.  The literature is extensive.<BR>

<A HREF="refkey.htm">1.</A>  "Pau d' Arco has been revered by the Rainforest Indians for centuries.  It is one of the most useful Brazilian herbs.  It is called the "divine tree." It is helpful in rheumatism and arthritic inflammation, prostatitis, cystitis, and beneficial for controlling fungus and yeast overgrowth in the body.  This multi-purpose herb helps prevent tumor formation and is thought to eliminate toxins and purify the blood.  Pau d' Arco became very popular in 1967 after Dr. Walter Accorsi of the Municipal Hospital in Santo Andre talked to a magazine reporter who printed his story. He said:- "From my first experiments with Ipe Roxo (Pau d'Arco), I learned two important things which, greatly encouraged me in regards to cancer: First, that it eliminates the pain caused by the disease; and second, that it multiplies the number of red blood cells." This bark is used  to treat stomatitis (swelling of the mucus membranes in the mouth), ulcers in the throat, gastric ulcers, syphilitic chancres, itchiness, wounds, eczema, and boils."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">2.</A> "Brazilians call pau d'arco the "divine tree." It helps to increase red blood cell production and helps respiratory disorders, ulcers, candida excess, and athlete's foot.  Pau d'arco can fortify the blood, helps to dissolve phlegm and is an antifungal.  Research in both the United States and South America shows that pau d'arco has ingredients found to be effective against some forms of cancer and parasites.  It helps lower blood sugar levels and promotes digestion.  Lapachol, from pau d'arco, was recently listed by Purdue University as among the most important antitumor agents from plants."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">3.</A>  "ACTIONS:  Fortifies blood, Antifungal activity,  Combats Candida overgrowth.  TRADITIONAL USE:  Pau D'Arco tea has been revered by the Indians for centuries as one of the most useful Brazilian herbs.  They call it the "Divine Tree'.  It has been the subject of experiments with encouraging results.  Dr. Walter Accorsi, in an article March 1967, states it multiplies the amount of red corpuscles.  Experiments have been conducted at the Municipal Hospital at Santo Andre, Sao Paulo using Pau D'Arco in the treatment of respiratory problems, ulcers and a variety of other ailments.  Pau D'Arco is highly regarded for its effectiveness in controlling Candida excess. MERIDIAN INDICATIONS: Disperses damp, Dissolves phlegm, Aids regulation of Lung / Stomach, Relieves stagnation in all meridians. EVA POINTS:  Liver, Kidney, Large and Small Intestine."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">5.</A>  "Bitter herb that contains a natural antibacterial agent, has a healing effect, and cleans the blood. Good for candidiasis, smoker's cough, warts, all types of infection, diabetes, ulcers, rheumatism, allergies, tumors, AIDS, leukemia, cancer, and liver disease. NOTE: Resistant strains of Candida develop rapidly due to genetic mutation. Rotating treatment programs will be beneficial."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">8.</A>   "Brazilian uses and Folklore: If you stop any Brazilian on the street and ask him "What is Ipe Roxo?"... not only will he know immediately what you are talking about, he will begin to explain enthusiastically the wonders and uses of the tea made from the inner bark. Ipe Roxo is undoubtedly one of the most valued and useful of all Brazilian herbs. Used as a health tonic and revered by the Indians for centuries, Ipe Roxo first came to the attention of botanists and doctors about 100 years ago.  Since then, the uses and wonders of this tree have
been studied and prescribed.  In March of 1967 "O Cruzeiro" magazine published an article about the results doctors were getting with the tea at the municipal hospital in Santo Andre, Sao Paulo.  The article quotes Dr. Walter Accorsi, as stating: "From my first experiments with it [IPE ROXO], I learned two important things which greatly encouraged me in regard to cancer: Firstly, Pau D'Arco eliminates the pain caused by the disease; and secondly, it multiplies the amount of red corpuscle. Our amazement grew: This bark cured everything!  Ulcers, diabetes, and rheumatism - the medicine cleared them all up".After the publication of this article, the demand for Ipe Roxo grew tenfold and today Ipe Roxo bark, extract and homeopathic mother tincture are to be found in health food stores, drugstores and pharmacies all over Brazil.  Ipe Roxo can be taken alone, or with other herbal teas for which it acts as a catalyst.  Uses:Influential in the treatment of symptoms of: cancer, diabetes, respiratory problems, ulcers, colitis, arthritis, rheumatism, poor circulation, prostatitis, cystitis, constipation."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">11.</A> "Pau d' Arco is thought to eliminate toxins in the body and purify the blood, and it has anti-fungal properties.  In an original weight loss research study performed in Chicago in 1992, I found that women's chronic yeast infections cleared up promptly when Pau d'Arco was added to the formula.  Pau d'Arco also has anti-inflammatory characteristics, making it useful in the treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory diseases.  Some researchers report its ability to increase red blood cell counts and eliminate some symptoms associated with cancer."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">13.</A>    "During the past century, LaPacho has come under scientific scrutiny. The first active constituent to be studied was lapachol; however, it is interesting to note that many of the studies show significantly better results with the whole extract and diminishing effectiveness as the extracts are refined or individual chemicals are tested."<P>

<A HREF="refkey.htm">14.</A>   "The native Indians of Brazil, northern Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia and other South American countries have used lapacho [T. impetiginosa] for medicinal purposes for thousands of years; there are indication that its use may actually antedate the Incas. Lapacho is applied externally and internally for the treatment of fevers, infections, colds, flu, dysentery, gastrointestinal problems of all kinds, debilitating conditions such as arthritis and prostatitis, and circulatory disturbances. Other conditions reportedly cured with lapacho include lupus, diabetes, Hodgkin's disease, osteomyelitis, Parkinson's disease and psoriasis...<BR>
	Independent of Meyer, a Physician in Brazil, about 1960, after hearing a tale of its miraculous curative powers, used lapacho to treat his brother who was lying in a Santa Andre, Brazil hospital, dying of cancer. His brother recovered, and the physician, Dr. Orlando dei Santi, began to use the herb to treat cancer patients at the hospital. other physicians joined the team and after a few months, several cures were recorded.  In the typical case, pain disappeared rapidly and sometimes complete remission was achieved in as little as four weeks. Because of the work at the Municipal Hospital of Santo Andre, lapacho has become a standard form of treatment for some kinds of cancer and for all kinds of infections in medical establishments throughout Brazil.  It should be noted that after the first reports of "miraculous" herbal cures appeared in Brazil, the national government ordered a blackout of any more public statements by doctors involved in the research.  The silence was finally broken by Alec De Montmorency, who in 1981 published a lengthy review of the ongoing clinical work in Brazil.  This report succeeded in stimulating worldwide interest in the plant."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">21.</A>   "BIGNONIACEAE
Bignonia Family, Catalpa Family, Trumpet Vine Family<BR>

These trees, lianas and shrubs, almost exclusively of  the tropical regions of  both hemispheres, number more than 600 species in over 100 genera.  Their centre of speciation is in northern South America, where lianas occupy a major place in the tropical vegetation.  Many are ornamental, and some are the source of valuable woods. <BR> The family  is divided into four tribes based primarily on floral and seed differences.Quinones, pseudoindicans and flavonoids are found throughout the family; occasionally triterpenes, coumarin, alkaloids, tannins and saponins have been reported.<BR>
	<B>Tabebuia</B> <BR>
	Tabebuia has approximately 100 species of evergreen trees or shrubs native to the warmer parts of the Americas.  Several chemical compounds have been identified in the genus; lapachol is common (Paredes, 1975).  The constituents of the following species have been summarized: <I>T. guyacan</I> (Manners, 1977), <I>T pallida </I>(Prakash, 1980a; Prakash, 1980), <I>T. rosea </I>(Nair, 1982) and <I>T. chrysantha</I> (Wasicky, 1967).

Rose Family<BR>

This large family of some 100 genera and 2000 species includes trees, shrubs and usually perennial herbs.  A few genera consitute the source of many of our edible fruits (apples, pears, strawberries, raspberries, plums, etc.); some are important in perfumery and many are horticultural favorites.<BR>
The economic importance of the family has led to a large literature on its chemistry:	cyanogenic glycosides, simple and polyphenols and phenolic acids, catechin and gallic/ellagic tannins, pentacyclic triterpenes and saponins, sterols and occasional ethereal oils have been reported.<BR>

<B>Prunus</B> Linnaeus<BR>
The approximately 300 species of small to medium-sized trees and shrubs are cosmopolitan, usually in temperate regions. The chemistry of the genus follows that of the family in most important respects.  Extracts of P. emarginata are claimed to inhibit fertility (Barfknecht, 1968), those of P. mume to have antitubercular activity (Ma, 1968).  Extracts of P. lusitanica have been patented as bacteriocides and fungicides (Fr.  Pat., 1968).<BR>

<A HREF="refkey.htm">21.</A>  "MYRTACEAE<BR>
Myrtle Family<BR>

There are some 85 genera in this family with an estimated 3000 species of woody plants, some trees but mostly shrubs and a few vines.  Many are fragrant with oil glands in the leaves; some have edible fruits.  They are distributed in tropical South America and especially in Australia.  The family is divided into two sections on the basis mainly of the fruit; Myrtoideae (berries, rarely drupes); Leptospermoideae (dry fruit).  It is economically important primarily as the family of cloves, (Syzygium aromaticum) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.).<BR>
The family is rich in ethereal oils containing several types of chemical structures; polyphenols, occasional alkaloids, tannins, sterols, triterpenes and some cyanogenic compounds are also found.  A group of triketones has been reported in the oils (Hellyer, 1968); pentacyclic triterpenes have been isolated from Myrtus commutlis (Erlacin, 1984).<BR>
<B>Myrcia </B>DeCandolle<BR>
The more than 150 species of Myrcia are distributed in tropical South America and the West Indies.  They are shrubs and small to large trees.
Terpenes and sesquiterpenes have been found in the genus (Gottlieb, 1981).  Amyrin and eucalyptin have been identified in M. citrifolia (Gottlieb, 1972); a patent covering the antitumor constituents of M. fallax has been issued (Hecht, 1984).<BR>

Plant has proven antihepatotoxic, antispasmodic, antiviral, bactericidal, diuretic, febrifugal, and hypoglycemic activity (TRA)."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">12.</A> 
"The pitirishi (P niruri) is widely recognized as a diuretic used in the treatment of urinary tract infections as well as fevers. In Brazil, a tea made from the whole plant is a folk treatment for painful kidneys . In the Bahamas, it goes by the name hurricane weed, or gale-wind grass.  The locals boil this bitter-tasting plant to make a tea to treat poor appetite, constipation, typhoid fever, and, provided the patient doesn't have an upset stomach, flu and colds.
P niruri has attracted world medical attention after significantly inhibiting replication of the hepatitis B virus, a slow-acting pathogen linked to liver cancer that is now carried by some 300 to 500 million people worldwide.
Could an herbal medicine help?  That was the question posed by a group at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, where a massive search of the world's herbal literature was initiated for plants used against jaundice (acute hepatitis) and other liver diseases.  Phyllanthus turned up as one of the most promising for follow-up. The hope for Phyllanthus is to provide an abundantly available nontoxic alternative not only to treat the disease, but ideally to render carriers sero-negative for the virus so they won't pass it on to others.  Combined with vaccines, Phyllanthus, or perhaps other herbs combined, might make a significant contribution to the eradication of viral hepatitis.
In Peru, the most common name for P niruri is chanca piedra, meaning "shatter stone." More than one physician there has prescribed the feathery-leafed herb to cure kidney stones and gallstones, problems from which the plant takes its common name and for which the remedy is regarded infallible This herb is now available in the United States as quebra pedra or chanca pedra ("stonebreaker"), the more common names in Brazil."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">17.</A>  "One of the people who looked me up was a Dr. Wolfram Wiemann, who came to  Iquitos to  buy medicinal materials for his store in Nuremberg, Germany. The chief purpose of his trip was to replenish his stock of chanca peidra (Phyllanthus niruri), which he considered a most important cure for gallstones and kidney stones.  The plant loses none of its effectiveness when dried, so it can be shipped anywhere. Dr. Weimann kept careful records of all his sales, and he told me that he had over a hundred case histories of this one.  In ninety-four percent of these, chanca peidra had completely eliminiated the calculi within a week or two; the other six percent were people who did not keep the required promise to report results or those he had been unable to locate after they failed to show up.  According to his records, not only was the herb infallibly successful in healing, but the only evidence of any side effect was an occasional case of cramps during the expulsion of stone. Dr. Weimann believed the healing to be permanent. His description of  the effects of chanca peidra duplicated first-hand accounts I had received from acquaintances who had used it, and also the information given me long ago by my own Iquitos physician, Dr. Gil Villacorta.  He told me he had been prescribing it for years and had never known it to fail or to cause any unpleasant side effects."<P>

	Kidney stones.  A tea from the shrub ita-mira 'kidney stone-tree' is made from the leaves of Phyllanthus urinaria (which is not a tree, but a small herb) for treating kidney stones (ita) and kidney infections in general. This species and several of its conspecifics are widely used in Brazil 	and Amazonia by rural people for the same purposes.  Recent research suggests that the anti-spasmodic effect of certain (as yet unidentified) substances in Phyllanthus may be responsible	for a genuinely remedial effect with regard to kidney stones; these species also appear to be 	effective against viral hepatitis (Sousa et al. 1991:377-378)."<P>

Spurge Family<BR>

This family of 300 genera and around 5000 species of trees, shrubs and herbs is almost cosmopolitan.  It is so variable in structure that there have been suggestions that it may be polyphyletic.  It is economically important, providing foods, rubbers, medicinals, oils, dyes and other useful products.  Most species have a white latex; that of some members of the family is highly toxic or caustic.<BR>
Classification of the subfamily divisions needs careful revision.
The family is rich in constituents of potential biodynamic activity.  The inflammatory, tumor-promoting and antitumor actions of the diterpenes (Evans, 1983), the chemical and biological properties of the alkaloids and triterpenoids (Hirata, 1975), as well as those of the diterpenes (Schneider, 1979) have all been reviewed.  Much of the recent work on the chemical and pharmacological properties of the genus Euphorbia has also been summarized (Baslas, 1981, 1982; (Van Os, 1981).  Digestive tract neoplasms are referable to the irritating substances found in several species of Euphorbia (Hecker, 1984).<BR>
<B>Phyllanthus</B> Linnaeus<BR>
The 600 species of shrubs, small trees and annual or biennial herbs are distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions of both hemispheres.  Several are cultivated in South America as fish poisons.  Phyllanthus fluitans is a small, free-floating aquatic plant, a habit unique in the Euphorbiaceae.<BR>

Polypody Family<BR>

The Polypodiaceae, a fern family, comprises approximately 50 genera.  Most of the species are low epiphytes without a trunk but with creeping rhizomes.  They differ widely in habit.  The family, which makes up three quarters of all ferns, has 6000 species widely distributed in both hemispheres, mostly in the tropics.  Recently, a number of new families have been proposed for some of the tropical species.
Numerous potentially biodynamic compounds have been found in the family, including flavonoids, polyphenols, tannins, cyanogenic compounds, phloroglucides, tetracyclic triterpenes (Arai, 1984) and unnamed alkaloids.  Extracts of various members of the family show antimicrobial activity (Shcherbanovski, 1979).  Most of the recently reported work refers to the genus Polypodium.<BR>

Spurge Family<BR>

This family of 300 genera and around 5000 species of trees, shrubs and herbs is almost cosmopolitan.  It is so variable in structure that there have been suggestions that it may be polyphyletic.  It is economically important, providing foods, rubbers, medicinals, oils, dyes and other useful products.  Most species have a white latex; that of some members of the family is highly toxic or caustic.<BR>
Classification of the subfamily divisions needs careful revision.
The family is rich in constituents of potential biodynamic activity.  The inflammatory, tumor-promoting and antitumor actions of the diterpenes (Evans, 1983), the chemical and biological properties of the alkaloids and triterpenoids (Hirata, 1975), as well as those of the diterpenes (Schneider, 1979) have all been reviewed.  Much of the recent work on the chemical and pharmacological properties of the genus Euphorbia has also been summarized (Baslas, 1981, 1982; (Van Os, 1981).  Digestive tract neoplasms are referable to the irritating substances found in several species of Euphorbia (Hecker, 1984).<BR>
<B>Croton </B>Linnaeus<BR>
The 750 species of trees and shrubs in Croton are distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of both hemispheres.  Several are well-known medicinal plants used as purgatives and tonics, others produce valuable lacs and resins utilized in making varnishes. In addition to the constituents normally reported in the family, C. persicaria (C. bonplandianum ?) was found to contain morphine-type alkaloids (Tiwari, 1981).  An association between C. flavens and esophageal cancer in the West Indies has been studied (Hecker, 1983).  The genus is well-furnished with alkaloids.<BR>

 <A HREF="refkey.htm">21.</A>  "CUCURBITACEAE<BR>
Gourd Family<BR>
The Gourd Family comprises about 90 genera and some 700 species, mostly coarse climbing annual and perennial herbs of tropical and subtropical regions around the world, extending even into the temperate zones.  The fruit is usually a fleshy berry, often called a pepo, and many cultivated varieties have been important as foods.  A number of tropical species are believed to be toxic.  The family is classified into two quite distinct sections on the basis of morphology of the tendrils and seeds; and nine tribes primarily of floral characters and pollen types.  Some of the larger, hard-shelled fruits provide gourds (Lagenaria, <B>Trichosanthes</B>).  Species with edible fruits, such as pumpkins, squashes (Cucurbita) and melons (Cucumis) have been cultivated for millennia and have developed many strains or "varieties." There are several medicinally valuable species, and some are considered in primitive societies to be poisonous or to have value as medicines.<BR>
Alkaloids have been reported in the family which, however, is noted for a class of compounds called the cucurbitacins.  Saponins, sterols, phenolics are also known.  The chemistry of the cucurbitacins has been reviewed (Guha, 1975); these and other tetracyclic triterpenes are growth-regulating substances (Shrotria, 1976).<BR>

 <A HREF="refkey.htm">1.</A>  "The dried leaf of Stevia was described as having sweet properties as early as 1899.  It contains Stevisoid, a natural sweetener, which is 300 times as sweet as sugar, yet is not absorbed by the body and contains practically no calories.  These properties make it useful in weight loss programs. Despite Stevia's sweetness, it does not produce tooth cavities.  This may be due to its high fluoride or other high mineral content.  It is frequently used by Rainforest Indians to sweeten foods and herbal teas.  They also speak of the wonders of Stevia to treat diabetes, hypertension, and infections. It has been frequently reported that Stevia exhibits a hypoglycemic (lowers blood sugar) action.  In one double blind study of 25 hospitalized patients, mean blood sugar dropped 35.2% six to eight hours after ingestion of Stevia. Other research reports suggest that it has hypotensive (lowers blood pressure) activity.  One study found that a single oral dose of aqueous extract resulted in a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 9.5 %. Another study found that the use of Stevia for 30 days resulted in a decrease of both systolic and diastolic pressures.  Stevia may also be effective against Candida albicans (yeast infection)."<P>

<A HREF="refkey.htm">8.</A>  "Stevia is a small bush which grows near Brazil's southern border, on the frontier with Paraguay, It contains Stevisoid, a natural sweetener.  It is 300 times as sweet as sugar, yet is not absorbed by the body and contains hardly any calories. Brazilian uses and folklore: Stevia has long been used by the Guarani Indian tribe to sweeten other herbal teas and foods.  The plant was first studied scientifically in 1899 by Paraguayan botanist Moises S. Bertoni, who recognized the plants incredible sweetening power.  He suggested that Stevisoid might substitute saccarhine as a sweetening agent being completely non-toxic.  In Rio de Janeiro studies on Stevia are continuing and it is considered to be the sweetener of the future.  Stevia is grown in the interior of Sao Paulo.  In the city of Birigui the plant is so popular that the tea made from it is sold at almost all bars and restaurants.  Milkshakes, juices and coffee are sweetened with Stevia.  The inhabitants in this little town speak of the wonders of Stevia and the positive results it has given in cases of diabetes, hypertension and infections. Stevia is considered to be a great help in weight loss programs because it is very low in calories and its sweetness is so concentrated.  Chewing a few leaves of Stevia will satisfy anyone's sweet tooth, and the shredded leaves are an excellent substitute for sugar in cooking.  Uses: Natural herbal sweetener; useful in treating the symptoms of diabetes, high blood pressure, infections."<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<A HREF="refkey.htm">1.</A> "Suma is called "Brazilian ginseng" because it is a near panacea in Brazil.  Although it is not a true ginseng from the Panax plant family; like ginseng, it has both adaptogenic and immune-enhancing properties.  Some researchers report that it has the ability to strengthen the immune system and reduce tumors.  Other researchers have found that Suma acts primarily as a regulator of the endocrine, nervous, musculoskeletal and digestive systems without stimulatory or inhibitory effects, thus classifying it as a true adaptogen. An important ingredient in Suma is the saponin nortriterpenoid.  Six different pfaffic acid sugar compounds have been isolated from nortriterpenoid.  Five of these six pfaffic acid derivatives inhibit cultured tumor cell melanomas and some of them have been reported to regulate blood sugar levels. Two plant hormones, sitosterol and stigmasterol, also occur naturally in Suma.  They have been reported to encourage estrogen production and reduce high serum cholesterol levels.  Beta-ecdysone, another plant steroid isolated from Suma facilitates cellular oxygenation.  Nutritional analysis has found that Suma contains 19 different amino acids, a large number of electrolytes and trace minerals including iron, magnesium, cobalt, silica, zinc and the vitamins A, B-1, B-2, E, K, and pantothenic acid.  It is especially high in the trace element germanium which is considered an oxygenator and is used as a nutritional supplement for the immune system. Suma is reported to increase chi (energy flow in the body).   It has been used as a tonic, an aphrodisiac, a calming agent, and in the treatment of ulcers for at least 300 years."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">2.</A> "Suma has been called "para todo" which means "for all things" by the Brazilians.  It is said to be the South American version of ginseng.  It contains up to eleven percent saponins.  Derivations from saponins have been patented as antitumor compounds.  Suma has been used to help many chronic diseases including leukemia, arthritis, asthma, high blood pressure, mononucleosis, candida, hypoglycemia, Epstein Barr Syndrome, high cholesterol, and the early stages of cancer.  It seems to balance female hormones and is good for menopause.  It is also used for impotency and frigidity."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">3.</A> "ACTIONS:  Increases energy, Boosts immunity, Inhibits tumors, Regulates blood sugar levels, Balances hormones. TRADITIONAL USE: Suma has been proved to increase oxygen in the system, boosting energy and immunity. In the Amazon it is called "Para Todo' which means "for everything'.  Studies conducted by scientists on three continents suggest that unique chemicals present in Suma inhibit tumor cell growth.  Research indicates the presence of germanium as one of the active constituents in Suma.  Because of this it is an excellent catalyst and increases oxygen at the cellular level.  Based on years of clinical experiments, researchers believe Suma is both safe and effective. Suma balances hormones and increases energy by increasing oxygen at the cellular level. MERIDIAN INDICATIONS:  Increases Qi, Liver blood tonic, Increases Yang in Lung and Heart meridian, Regulates Triple Warmer, primarily Upper Burner. EVA POINTS: Triple Warmer (endocrine system), Spleen, Liver, Heart"<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">5.</A> "Suma has properties that combat anemia, fatigue, stress, and diabetes. An immune system booster. In Brazil suma was reported to be more powerful than ginseng, and it is referred to as Brazilian ginseng. Research in Japan found that the suma root contains pfaffic acid, which is capable of inhibiting certain types of cancerous cells. Dr. Takemoto was the first to study suma in Japan."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">11.</A>  <B> Article 1:</B>  "Suma, called "Brazilian ginseng," strengthens the immune system and reduces tumor formation. Of six pfaffic acid sugar compounds isolated from this plant, five of them were shown to inhibit cultured tumor cell melanomas. The nutrient composition of Suma shows it especially high in the trace element germanium, very important for proper immune system function. Suma is also a cellular oxygenator and contains two plant hormones, sitosterol and stigmasterol, which encourage estrogen production and reduce high serum cholesterol levels. Some patients report an increased resistance to extreme highs or lows in the temperature of their environment from Suma."<P>
<B>Article 2: </B> "Of the more than 200,000 plant species found in the Amazon, many have been found to contain hormone-like compounds that are quite similar to estrogen and testosterone.  These plants have been traditionally used to treat women with PMS, menopause and miscarriages, and men with impotence and prostatitis. One of the most effective herbs from the Amazon for female problems is Suma. Suma is called "Brazilian ginseng" because of the wide variety of conditions it is used to treat in Brazil.  Researchers report that it acts primarily as a regulator of the endocrine, nervous, musculoskeletal and digestive systems.  Suma is classified as a  true adaptogen.  Adaptogens differ from other herbs in that they can be used safely on a daily basis.  Their action is normalizing, as opposed to stimulating or inhibitive. Two plant hormones, sitosterol and stigmasterol, occur naturally in Suma.  These two plant hormones are phytoestrogens, plant compounds that mimic some of the properties of estrogen.  Another plant compound found in Suma, beta-ecdysone, facilitates cellular oxygenation. Mary Ellen found that by taking a combination of Amazon herbs containing phytoestrogens, her menopausal symptoms stopped quickly.   Plants containing phyto-estrogens have been found to be protective against female hormonal-related cancers, including breast cancer, cancer of the cervix, and endometriosis."<P>
<B>Article 3:</B>  "Of these eight herbs, Suma (Pfaffia paniculata) is by far the most well-researched. Studies by Okui and Otaka dating back to 1968 revealed that the plant enhanced muscle-building without producing the negative hormonal effects steroids are noted for. By 1976, the Russian scientist V.N. Syrov was convinced that the anabolic agent in Suma was beta-ecdysterone. This gave the Russians the competitive edge in the Olympics, and Suma began to be called "the Russian Secret."<P>
A dosage of 500 mg. of Suma twice a day helped all athletes during any stage of their training, according to a research report by Health Research which studied amateur athletes.  Experiment participants first noted a "sense of well-being" within 3-5 days, and a new increased desire to get to their next training session.  Weight lifters experienced much less pain during heavy lifts when they took Suma.  These researchers recommended 500 mg. for every 40 lbs. of body weight, spread out evenly in two divided doses, for the maximum gain in muscle strength and size.  During a 54-day period (almost 8 weeks), the dosage was only taken on days 1-10, 16-25, and days 31-40.  Despite the 24 days off  the herb, researchers  reported that Suma's effects were still felt by the athletes on the off days."<P>  
<A HREF="refkey.htm">15.</A>" A number of other herbs have been receiving good reports as strengtheners of the immune system. Among the most prominent of these are chaparral, Pau d'Arco, tang-kuei, hoelen, various Chinese formulas, and the Suma brand of Pfaffia paniculata."
	"(Pfaffia paniculata). Enhances energy and vitality and shows great promise as a healing agent in chronic disorders believed to result from a lowered immune response."<P>
<A HREF="refkey.htm">21.</A>"AMARANTHACEAE<BR>
Cockscomb Family, Amaranth Family<BR>
The herbs, shrubs or vines of the Amaranthaceae, numbering 400 to 500 species in 40 genera, occur in temperate, tropical and subtropical zones in both hemispheres.  The family has been classified into two subfamilies based on the structure of the stamens and ovaries.  There are many weedy species.  Ornamentals are numerous.  The edible seeds and young plants of several species have been valued as food in Central, and South America and the Himalayas.<BR>
Saponins are widespread in the family; cyanogenic compounds are found to a limited extent.  More characteristic is a group of  nitrogen-containing protoalkaloids (betacyanins and betaxanthines).  Some members accumulate nitrate (potentially carcinogenic).  The occasional presence of alkaloids has been reported; saponins are widespread in the family.<BR>
	<B>Pfaffia </B><BR>
In the warmer parts of Central and South America this genus comprises approximately 50 mostly shrubby species.  One,<B> P. paniculata</B>, is known as Brazilian ginseng.  It contains up to 11% of saponins (Howard-Williams, 1977).  These are glycosides of nortriterpenes (Nishimoto, 1984; De Oliveira, 1980), derivatives of which have been patented as antitumor compounds (Takemoto, 1972).<BR>

<h2>Hiring English Teachers</h2>
</center>

All the schools listed here hire English teachers on a regular basis. 
Also, most of them have branch schools throughout Taiwan, so you may be able to work in a city of your choice. 
There are several things you might want to consider when choosing a school.  Do they offer a resident visa? Training? Guaranteed hours? 
Help finding accomodations? Contact the schools directly for more information.

Although the links below mainly concern English teaching, we would like to include sites for teaching any language.

<UL>
	<LI><P><A  HREF="#Teachers">Resources for Teachers</A><BR>

 we link to, however, contain extensive lists of other resources.</P></LI>

This list of sites is by no means exhaustive, but as with the list above, the sites we link to are more extensive.</P></LI>

The sites listed here are the main sites we know of for posting English teaching jobs.  <a href="mailto:joh@anjes.com.tw">Suggestions</a>

 teaching.</P></LI>

	<LI><P><A  HREF="http://www.scu.edu.tw/campus/language/master.htm">Soochow University Language Center Homepage</A><BR>

Pretty interesting page in several ways.  There is a list of abstracts of MA dissertations, a list of on-line resources for Applied Linguistics,

it also provides detailed information on the English Language Institute itself.</P></LI>

 anything.  Check out the idioms and the quizzes.</P></LI>

This is a list of links for penpals either by e-mail or snail mail.</P></LI>

	<LI><P><A  HREF="http://www.penpals.com/">Pen Pal Connection</A><BR>
Check this one out, especially Romance Rendezvous.  It's a good idea to set fairly strict criteria in the search as some of the pen pals
 are a little raunchy or just looking for a date.  On the other hand, maybe you like that.</P></LI>

	<LI><P><A  HREF="http://schmooze.hunter.cuny.edu:8888">schMOOze U.</A><BR>
This is a MOO.  In other words, it's a place that students can go to and move from room to room in a virtual "university" communicating with 
others.  It's quite confusing at first, but it's worth spending some time with.  Make sure to get all the background info.</P></LI>

If you are planning to come to Taiwan to make tons of money by teaching English, 
read no further.  Those days have long since gone.  Living costs have risen dramatically.  
A bottle of cold beer at a pub is about US$4.00 and a small room is about US$250.00 
a month.  That's not to say you can't make money. On average, an English teacher can 
make about US$20 (1 U.S. dollar = 27 New Taiwan dollars) an hour teaching at English schools or bushibans as they are known in Taiwan. 
Schools that offer bulk hours and benefits may often pay a bit less than at schools that offer less hours, but in the end 
it can work out better.  Also, part time hourly pay at a university is not significantly better than at the language schools. 
In either case, you can definitely save a small hoard to take back home or go 
<a href="../trav.htm">traveling</a>.<p>

One of the factors which will have a major impact on your teaching experience 
will be where you teach because the <a href="../information/overview_climate.htm">weather</a> differs a lot depending on your 
geographic location. In general, the north is relatively sticky and wet, whereas 
the south is dry and hot. Also, if you work in a large city like Taipei or Kaohsiung, 
traffic and pollution can be discouraging.  However, the vibrant, modern cities with 
all their interesting places and social events more than compensate for the 
negative aspects.<p>

Another important factor will be whether you teach children or adults. 
Teaching kids is physically more demanding than teaching adults. The good news is 
that Taiwanese kids are generally attentive, humorous, and diligent. On the flipside, 
teaching ABCs to 8 year olds isn't as intellectually stimulating as having a 
discussion in English with adults about relationships and Taiwanese society. 
You may find it neccessary, however, to teach both children and adults if not 
contractually tied to a school and guaranteed enough working hours.<p>

Whether you teach children or adults, you will find that most people are very 
enthusiastic about learning English. Don't be surprised if taxi drivers try to 
practice their English with you. And you're bound to get numerous offers to do 
<a href="../educ.htm">language exchanges</a>.<p>

But what's so great about teaching English in Taiwan, you ask? Well, for one thing 
you'll have lots of free time.  On average, you might teach about 20-25 hours a week 
working at an English school. You can then spend your free time studying Chinese. 
During the holidays, you can hop on an airplane and visit the neighboring countries like Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. 
Also, teaching English is usually a one or two 
year commitment, after which you can move on.  Since Taiwan has one of the most dynamic 
economies in Asia, finding a job in a business or information related field is a 
definite possibility.<p>

<!-- Following two paragraphs written by Eddy Moran-->
So what kind of qualifications do you need to have to get an English teaching job?  
Language centers in Taiwan are not very picky about qualifications, but you do need 
a BA or BS to qualify for a resident visa. There is a very strong bias towards North 
American accents in Taiwan, but those without the prized twang still do okay. Experience
out-weighs everything else.<p>

For English teachers who have an MA or a PhD, universities and colleges may
be an attractive alternative.  These jobs have become quite hard to obtain
in the past two years as the Ministry of Education is raising standards
across the board and highly qualified candidates are applying in greater
numbers than before.  Full-time teachers with MAs work a minimum of 10 class
hours per week (plus office hours) and are paid year-round.  It is also
possible to work part-time at other institutions in addition to this.<p>

We would like to invite all language teachers, both native and non-native, to take part in this forum. 
It doesn't matter if you are a high school teacher, a bushiban teacher, or in a university. 
Likewise, we would especially like to hear from teachers of any foreign language. 
If you have any questions you would like to post here, please let the <a href="mailto:joh@anjes.com.tw"><I>webmaster</I></a> know.</P>

<h2>Bushibans</h2>
</center>

Bushibans are ideal for those who prefer to learn Chinese at their own pace rather than
follow a rigid curriculum. Generally, the Chinese teachers are younger than their counterparts
at the Chinese language centers and so the class tends to be far more informal. Also, there
are no financial incentives such as scholarships to encourage daily attendance nor rules
regarding absences. Thus for a small group class, daily class size can vary from one to six
students. Many students who want to study Chinese immediately upon arriving in Taiwan find
it convenient to study at a bushiban while waiting to attend a Chinese language center.

<h2>Language Centers</h2>
</center>

Language centers provide an excellent learning environment for students from all over the
world to come and study Chinese. Most centers have lounges, reading rooms, and language
labs. Generally, language centers have better facilities than bushibans. However, language
centers are stricter than bushibans. For example, language centers assign homework and
conduct exams. In addition, students must attend class on a regular basis or they will not be
allowed to register again next semester.<b>

Survival Chinese teaches the casual browser basic Chinese. It is <i>not </i>  a comprehensive guide to learning Chinese. There is, however, enough information to keep even those with some knowledge of Chinese amused.
<p>
If you are a first time visitor, please click on <a href="learnchinese/learnintro.htm">Learn Chinese</a>. Once you become familiar with Chinese grammar and sentence structure, you should check out the <a href="dictionary/chineseframes.htm">Dictionary</a> of useful words and phrases.
<p>
Good luck with your Chinese!

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The major obstacle in learning Chinese is the tones.  
Mandarin Chinese has four tones: high tone ( -- ), rising tone ( / ), falling-rising tone ( \/ ), and falling tone ( \ ). 
To try to teach them would be beyond the scope of this page, so we will dispense with them. 
This is probably unwise since changing the tone of a word changes its meaning. 
However, it does simplify things and can lead to pretty amusing situations.
<p>
Another frustrating thing about Chinese is that the writing system is completely different from spoken Chinese.  
Whereas English uses an alphabet, Chinese uses characters or 'idea-pictures', sort of like hieroglyphics but with a lot more squares. 
Approximately 50,000 Chinese characters exist of which 5,000 are currently used.  You <i>only</i> need to know about 2,000 to read a newspaper. 
Although we include the characters in our translations, we do not expect you to memorize them. 
If you can remember them effortlessly, then you're probably a genius.
<p>
The good news, for those who know English anyway, is that the sentence structure is similar to English: subject-verb-object. 
Also, the grammar is fairly simple. 
There are no verb conjugations to indicate the different tenses.
<p>
Pronunciation is a bit tricky. 
We've used the Pinyin system to Romanize Chinese characters. 
Although most of the letters in Pinyin sound the same as in English, there are some exceptions.  
For example, 'c' sounds like 'ts' as in 'its', 'q' sounds like 'ch' as in 'cheese', 'x' sounds like 'sh' as in 'shin', and 'zh' sounds like 'j' as in 'jerk'.   

<p>
Although patience and diligence are required, you will definitely walk away with some knowledge of Chinese!

<h2>Universities in Ireland</h2>
</center>

Education is very important to the people of Ireland and its universities have excellent reputations around the world. 
Ireland is a popular destination for foreign students, but not many Taiwanese students have gone there so far. 
This may be because Ireland itself is not very well known here. 
However, if you want to study in a really friendly and safe English speaking country with high academic standards and a distinct culture, Ireland would certainly be a good choice.
<p>
The official place to get information on universities in Ireland is:
<p>
Institute for Trade and Investment for Ireland<BR>
Rm. 7B-09, #5, Sec. 5, <BR>
Hsin Yi Rd. <BR>
Taipei <BR>

<h2>Taiwan Overview: Climate</h2>
</center>

<p><a href="http://www.cwb.gov.tw">Taiwan's weather</a> changes unpredictably and varies a lot depending on
the region. In the north, winter is surprisingly cold for a subtropical
island. Rainy and cloudy weather is very common. In contrast, winter is
dry and sunny in the south. From December to March, temperatures range
from 12-20C (54-68F). Coats are necessary. Spring is pleasantly warm. However,
there are frequent rains starting in May. The rainy season lasts until
June. Buying a pair of water-proof shoes is a good idea. Summer is hot
and very humid. From May to September, temperatures range from 25-35C (77-95).
T-shirts, shorts, and sandals are recommended. Summer is also characterized
by typhoons. October and November is the driest time of the year and is
also the best time to visit the island. </p>

You can say anything you like here. 
The only things we will moderate will be racist comments and things we believe are untrue. 
We also hope to have a good balance of both negative and positive comments.
<p>
Some examples of topics that we hope to see are:

<UL>
<LI>Telling people you're available to teach.</LI>
<LI>Simple requests for information.</LI>
<LI>Teaching problems and solutions.</LI>
<LI>Informal requests for substitute and take-over teachers.</LI>

I'm looking for weekend work teaching kids in the Mu Cha, Ching Mei, Hsin Tien areas of Taipei.  Any suggestions?<BR>
<I>Phil, Taipei</I></P>

<P>Webmaster: Try our <A  HREF="teacher_hire.htm">Hiring English Teachers</A> page.</P>

<P><I>11/1/96</I><BR>
Why is it that so few schools in Taiwan have resource centers where teachers can go for new ideas and materials on file?  You get the job, 
they throw you a dog eared copy of "Side by Side" or "Peter and Jane" and when the students complain that you don't have interesting classes, 
you get fired.  They don't even have a photocopier in one of the schools I work at.  Has anyone out there succeeded in getting a school to 
get a few extra books in?<BR>
<I>Mike, Taichung</I></P>

<P><I>11/2/96</I><BR>
Mike in Taichung is right on the button.  When I came here 2 years ago, I wasn't very experienced.  The first school I worked at didn't 
provide any backup and I had a hard time with the students because they really liked the teacher before me.  I went out and got a couple of 
decent books and that saved the day.  I left that school fairly quick and I suppose the next teacher had a similar problem to me.  I expect 
that bushiban has the same problems every few months because they're too bloody cheap to buy some books.  I dont' think there is 
any point trying to change things.  Just go get another job.  It's not as if it's hard to do around here.<BR>
<I>Bill, Taoyuan</I></P>

<P><I>11/2/96</I><BR>
I want to get an MA in Teaching English.  I'd appreciate it if anyone who has done this would let me know of a good place to do one.  The cost
is important, but I am more interested in what I can learn. <BR>
<I>Mike, Taipei</I></P>

<P>Webmaster: Take a look at the MA courses at Newcastle University in England.  They have an ad at the top of this page.  Also, try our 
very own <A  HREF="../education/60902uni.htm">Overseas University Homepage</A> page.</P>

<P><I>11/4/96</I><BR>
I worked in Taiwan for three years as the OUP rep, my English wife still
works in Taipei and I get to come back sometimes to give seminars.
</P>

<P>A year or so off I may want to return to teach in a Taiwan university if
you can tolerate me being a Brit (but a creative one with Masters in
Linguitsics for ELT).
</P>

<P>Right now I am associate professor at Josai International University in
Chiba teaching mainly writing, reading and conversation to real, real,
low-level students.  Contact me on jraby@jiu.ac.jp if you want info on Japan.

<P><I>11/11/96</I><BR>
I teach English at a bushiban, but I don't know too much about teaching
English at other places.  I was wondering, in terms of wage and working
conditions, what's the best place to teach English?  Is it at a
university? If so, how do I go about getting hired?  Do I need to have
connections or should I regularly check the newspapers?  Is it possible
to get hired even though I don't have a masters?</P>

<P>Also, does anyone know the answer to this question?  Which English
bushiban pays the most salary?
<BR>
<I>Joe, Taipei</I></P>

<P><I>11/13/96</I><BR>
I like the motorcycle picture.  I guess it's supposed to be an English teacher 
going to work or something.  It gave me this idea for rating bushibans.  You could 
have a scale of 1 to 5, where a really good bushiban would be a 5 motorcycle bushiban
 and a bad one would be 1 motorcycle.</P>

<P>My own ratings based on personal experience would be Joys with one and a
 half motorcycles, Hess would be half a motorcycle, and ELSI would be just the
 exhaust.<BR>
<I>John Davies, Mu Cha, Taipei</I></P>

<P>Webmaster: I think you should clarify your ratings criteria, but I do look forward to
 cleaner air.  More ratings suggestions are most welcome.</P>

<P><I>11/13/96</I><BR>
I went to the ETAROC conference held last weekend at Shih Da.  I thought it was 
a very good way to learn new ideas and meet other teachers.  The only trouble 
was that I didn't hear about it till the last minute, but I'm definitely going to go again 
next year if they have Jack Richards and David Nunan speaking again.<BR>

My name is Shawn Perry (from the USA), and I'm looking for work teaching 
in Taiwan starting in the Fall of '97.  I have an MA in TESOL from 
Illinois State University and a BA in English from Carleton College.  I 
have two years of experience teaching in ISU's English Language 
Institute and almost two years (still here) at Murray State University's 
ELI.  Personal goals for stay in Taiwan include learning Mandarin, Tai 
Chi and/or Wing Chung, and maybe even some Japanese if schooling is 
available (I'd like to teach in Japan as well.  I'm planning to spend 
one-two years in Taiwan and Japan. Thank you for your advice and 
suggestions.<BR>

<P><I>12/03/96</I><BR>
I am writing in response to some of the earlier postings about teaching
English in Taiwan.</P>

<P>Mike from Taichung - I agree wholeheartedly with your comments about the
lack of materials at most schools in Taiwan. I think this puts a large
burden on the teacher to search for new materials. What about forming a
local group of teachers who meet on a weekly (monthly) basis to swap
ideas and materials?</P>

<P>Mike from Taipei - I just got my MA in TEFL a few months ago. If you
have any questions about the degree you can contact me at
hhouston@mail.inetlife.com</P>

<P>Joe in Taipei - For answers to all or most of your questions, consult my
freshly updated article, <A  HREF="http://www.u-net.com/eflweb/taiwan0.htm">"Teaching English in Taiwan"</A>, at
http://www.u-net.com/eflweb/taiwan0.htm  The article contains lots of
tips on finding work, and it includes a list of over 60 schools in
Taipei that hire foreign teachers (yes, fellow teachers, you don't have
to work at Gl*b*l V*ll*g*  or H*ss forever). </P>

<P>The highest wage I have ever been offered is N.T. $1000 an hour, which
is not easy to find. University jobs are getting harder to come by, but
not impossible if you have teaching experience and a MA in TEFL.<BR>

I will be coming to Taiwan in late '97 so this may be a bit premature. I am looking for a language teaching job either in Taichung or in
Puli, Nantao County. At this time I am completing my studies and getting a TEFL Certificate. I am also teaching at Berlitz Language School.
 This summer I should be teaching in our public schools so I will have quite a bit of experience. Please contact me
 even if you don't know of any positions. I would love to hear from anyone over there and find out what to expect. </P>

<P>Thanks</P>

<P>Thaks for the chance to get in touch with other teachers on the island. My name is Les Davy, and I do a weekly comic for the China
 News on Sundays, called Made In Taiwan. Let me know some of your teaching experiences, or funny things that happen to you. I'm
 always looking for some good material that is funny without being racist or bitter, which can be very difficult at times, I know. E-mail me at:
<a href="mailto:lesdavy@ms7.hinet.net?cc=joh@anjes.com.tw">lesdavy@ms7.hinet.net</A>.    If I use your idea, I'll be sure to give you the credit!</P>

<P>The Community Services Center (No. 25, Lane 290, Chungshan N. Road, Sec. 6: Tel. 836-8134) has an ESL Teacher Reach-Out, which
meets the first and third Sundays of every month as a support group for teachers who are experiencing problems and frustration with
 teaching. I have not spoken with them or attended a meeting, but it sounds very interesting. This information comes from last week's
 China News.</P>

<P>I have heard that the Ministy of Ed. has a new regulation requiring Masters degree holders who wish to teach at the junior college
 level or above to have written a thesis. Can anyone tell me when this will take effect and whether, or not, it applies to prospective native
 speaking ESL instructors? <BR>
Thanks.
</P>

<P><a href="mailto:rob@speakeasy.org?cc=joh@anjes.com.tw">Bruce, Seattle</A></P>

<P>Webmaster:  I asked the Director of a university language center about this and she 
told me this is not true.  She pointed out that it is possible for Taiwanese college professors
to use publications to substitute for an MA and this might be the source of the confusion.  In 
addition, college professors are now under pressure to publish in the same way that American
 university teachers are, so that might also be something to do with what you heard.</P>


<P><I>12/30/96</I><BR>
First, if I were to first arrive in Taiwan, look for work, then apply
for a visa then could you go through the itinerary and its costs
(arrive, find job, fill documents, leave country, come back etc.).  What
kind of a time frame are we looking at here?   How fast can jobs be
found?  Also, what is required for a visa and where to get it (photos,
documents, medical, blood tests etc.)?</P>

<P>Second, if I bring all I need to teach and live with me, where can I
store it securely (like a laptop computer) while hunting for a
job/touring and then when I am away to get the appropriate visa?</P>

<P>Third, how difficult and/or expensive is it to get internet services in
Taiwan?  I thought that I could use it there to get teaching materials
and keep in touch with home?  Is this realistic?</P>

<P>The reason I ask you these questions is because no postings up to now
offer answers to them.  I need to know from someone who knows.  Maybe
others will be interested in the answers too.</P>

<P>By the way, I'm planning to arrive in Taiwan mid-February, right after
Chinese New Year (Feb 14).  Is this a good time to find jobs?
</P>

<P><a href="mailto:a6556@mail.public.net?cc=joh@anjes.com.tw">David C. Wilson</A></P>

<P>Webmaster:  First of all, thanks for the questions.  They are certainly very pertinent.</P>

<P>Second, do not take this as the gospel truth.  Nothing in Taiwan is constant for very long and such things as visa regulations are applied
 with varying strictness from one police area to another.  In addition, people vary in how picky or decisive they are about jobs and
 accomodation.  What we have written below is very approximate, so don't quote us.</P>

<P><B>Itinerary</B><BR>
Assuming you mean to arrive on a two month visitor visa and therefore have more time to pick and choose, here is a possible itinerary.</P>

<P>Getting into town (see our <A  HREF="/information/loadthg/61021inf.htm">Taiwan FAQ</A> for transportation details) and checking into
 whatever hotel or hostel you want (try <A  HREF="http://hotel.cybertaiwan.com">Hotel Guide Taiwan</A>; this is a bit light on budget
 hostels, but does have details for lower price business hotels) will take up most of the first day.</P>

<P>You could find a job within a week, if you are not too fussy and are prepared to start off by teaching kids.  The employer should sponsor
 you for a resident visa and give you about 20 hours a week for between NT$30,000 and NT$40,000 per month.  You can top this up with a
 bit of outside work if you're in a city area.  Tax starts at 6% and most teachers end up paying less than 10%.  Some schools will take 10%
 automatically and you get the difference back when you file.  Pay periods are either biweekly or monthly and some schools keep a couple
 of weeks back as security.  The school may also help with finding you an apartment, especially if it is not in a city area.</P>

<P>Costs per day for the initial job finding period are as follows:</P>

<P><B>Accomodation:</B> NT$200 (dorm bed in Taipei Hostel) to NT$1700 (average businessmens' hotel)</P>

<P><B>Restaurant Food:</B><BR>
Basic Chinese b/fast, lunch and dinner - NT$175<BR>
American fast food b/fast, lunch and dinner - NT$275 </P>

<P><B>Transportation: </B>Getting around in taxis may cost you NT$600 per day if you make a couple of long trips.</P>

<P><B>Deposit for apartment:</B>  This is usually 3 months rent and is returnable.  Monthly rents for a room in a typical 3 bedroom apartment vary
 from NT$5,000 to NT$12,000.</P>

<P><B>Visa stuff</B><BR>
You do not need to leave the country to do a resident visa now.  The paperwork takes a couple of weeks and you could probably work
 during this period.  The application fee is NT$1,000 and the medical tests cost over NT$2,000.  Our directory of hospitals will tell you
 which ones are approved for the test.  The tests are a one-price package deal.</P>

<P>For further details on visa requirements check out <A  HREF="http://www.amcham.com.tw/">AmCham's home page</A>.</P>

<P><B>Storage</B><BR>
It depends how much you have, but usually people leave stuff with their hostel manager.  If you have so much that you can't leave it there,
 then you'd better get an apartment first.</P>

<P><B>Internet Connection</B><BR>
For a comprehensive treatment of this, check out our <A  HREF="/information/isp/60731pro.htm">ISP page</A> in the Information section.</P>

<P><B>Arrival Time</B><BR>
About one month after Chinese New Year is a good time, but immediately after it should be OK.</P>

<h2>General Travel Info and Links</h2>
</center>

<P><A  NAME="CN"></A><A  HREF="http://city.net/"><IMG  SRC="asia_cnet.gif" BORDER=0>City.Net</A><BR>
City.Net is a web navigation aid that contains links to pages that will give you things such as maps, weather information and 
entertainment guides for the city you choose.  The amount of information you can get varies, but it's always worth a try.</P>

<P><A  HREF="http://www-sci.lib.uci.edu/~martindale/Ref.html">Martindale's</A><BR>
This is pretty close to being an encyclopedia.  It's full of information such as TV schedules (want to know what's on in Estonia tonight?),
 databases of all kinds, and scientific information resources.  Country information is only one of the sections, but there is a lot of
 other complimentary stuff like on-line currency conversion.  Well worth checking out if you are looking for some obscure resource.</P>

<P><A  HREF="http://www.webscope.com/travel/"><IMG  SRC="asia_webscope.gif">Hotels and Travel on the Net</A><BR>
A pretty good set of links to homepages for airlines, airports, hotels and the like.  Not very complete at the moment, but should
 get better very quickly.</P>

<P><A  HREF="http://www.infohub.com "><IMG   SRC="asia_infohub.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=17>InfoHub</A><BR>
A very good site - good graphics combined with common sense.  Gives you a main choice of general travel information such as accomodation and airline links or adventure
 holidays which gives you links to activity holiday sites for sailing or scuba diving and so on.  Clearly laid out with sections such as Traveller's
 Aid which gives maps and embassy information.</P>

<P><A  HREF="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~noeljc/backpackers_guide.htm">Backpackers' Guide to the Internet</A><BR>
Good links for budget travel and other stuff like car rentals.</P>

<P><A  NAME="LP"></A><A  HREF="http://www.lonelyplanet.com.au/lp.htm"><IMG  SRC="asia_lplanet.gif" BORDER=0>Lonely Planet</A><BR>
Very similar to the books.  There's a lot of indispensible information for travelers, but no details on accomodation (i.e. phone/fax numbers).
  The addition of a bulletin board and articles written by Lonely Planet's authors also distinguish the web page from the books.  The
 Travelers' Reports section makes fascinating reading if you are into traveling vicariously.</P>

<h2>Internet Service Providers: the least you need to know</h2>

<HR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><A  NAME="need"></A>What Do You Need to Have?</FONT><BR>
You need a modem to connect your computer to the telephone line. 
Get a 28,800 bps modem. 
Less than that isn't worth it these days. 
To sign up with an ISP, you'll have to show your passport and resident visa.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><A  NAME="companies"></A>Types of Companies</FONT><BR>
Internet service providers (ISPs) in Taiwan fall into two basic categories, government and private sector. 
The government companies are cheap, but the degree of service provided corresponds to the price. 
The private sector companies vary greatly in price and the deals they offer and in some cases, they can be as cheap as the government companies.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><A  NAME="accounts"></A>Your Own Needs and Types of Accounts</FONT><BR>
The deals offered by ISPs vary so much that users who only use e-mail and therefore spend very little time on-line could pay a lot to one ISP and very lttle to another. 
The reverse could easily be true for a surfer spending hours every day on the net. 
To help you compare, we have provided a set of three price estimates for each ISP listed. 
Some companies differentiate between "shell accounts" for e-mail and "PPP accounts" for full Internet connection. 
The trend now, however, seems to be towards charging by time only and providing a PPP connection to all customers.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><A  NAME="service"></A>Service and Home Page</FONT><BR>
From the point of view of a foreign resident whose Chinese isn't very good, it's important that the ISP has English speaking support. 
It's also helpful if the ISP has an English homepage to keep you updated and provide good links and software.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><A  NAME="hardware"></A>Hardware</FONT><BR>
Some providers experience connectivity problems because their ratio of telephone lines to subscribers is too poor. 
In North America, the ratio is supposed to be about ten subscribers to one line. 
This is rare in Taiwan, which explains why it is so common to get a  busy signal when users dial their provider.
<P>
This leads to something called bandwidth (e-mail users don't need to worry about this).
For practical purposes, this is a combination of the speed  of the modems that the provider has and the capacity of the connection between the provider and Hinet, the government internet company (or whatever other internet "backbone" there may be).
The standard for modems now is 28,800 bps.
To help you understand how important the line to Hinet is, here's a yard stick.
If the provider has one 64K line, then probably only about 12 simultaneous users could be supported without noticeable loss of performance (assuming that one third of these are using 14,400 bps modems at home).
Some ISPs that are just starting up only have 128K, so you'd better hope they increase their bandwidth as they get more customers.
For better connections, you should be looking for a provider with 512K or a T1 line, which is the best at the moment.
<P>
Internet companies can now lease their own international line, and in the near future, you can expect more of them to do this.
You should ask about this as you'll find that your internet connection is faster and more reliable.

<H2>Survey Icons and Rating System</H2>

<P>
We are not attempting to give a ranking of internet providers in Taiwan. 
Some are better than others in certain respects, but quality of service and hardware can improve or deteriorate in a very short time. 
What we do attempt is to let you know if they have an English language home page and/or English speaking staff, and which areas they serve. 
We can also tell you how good their bandwidth is. 
If you don't see these icons, it means they don't have these services (or, at least, they didn't when we last checked!).
<p>

<IMG SRC="isp_where.gif" ALIGN="middle" WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=50 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5>Areas served.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="isp_enghelp.gif" ALIGN="middle" WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=50 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5>This company has English language service.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="isp_homepage.gif" ALIGN="middle" WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=50 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5>This company has an English language home page.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="isp_connect.gif" ALIGN="middle" WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=50 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5>Connectivity (bandwidth).  

<p>
<br>

We will also give you some idea of how much you would have to pay over a one year period for an internet connection. 
For more specific details, please contact the ISPs directly. 
As people vary in the their connection time, we provide three figures. 
These are the icons we use and what they mean:
<p>
<IMG SRC="isp_boss.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=46 HEIGHT=51>VERY careful with money. 
Limited use by those who mainly use e-mail, but still do some browsing on the internet (1 hr per week). 
This type of user would have to pay NT$3000 per year to the Internet provider.
<p>				
<IMG  SRC="isp_homer.gif" WIDTH=47 HEIGHT=73>Just an ordinary guy. 
Average use based on the <A  HREF="http://www.nielsenmedia.com/commercenet/exec_sum.html">Nielsen</A> survey of internet usage (5 hrs 28 mins per week). 
This type of user would have to pay NT$6000 per year to the internet provider.
<p>				
<IMG  SRC="isp_clown.gif" WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=44>This is what you'll look like if you use the Internet too much. 
Hard core internet enthusiasts (20 hrs per week). 
This type of user would have to pay NT$12000 per year to the internet provider.

<A NAME="BC"></A>
<H2>Business Cards</H2>

<P>It is a good idea to have name cards even if you don't have a permanent address in Taiwan.  There will be many occasions
 when you will be given name cards and you will make a good impression if you have one to give back.  You can get a box of cards
 printed in a couple of days from a stationary store or a shop that sells chops (see below).  Name cards are presented with both hands
 and taken in the same way; it's quite a ceremony in it's own way.  Get yourself a Chinese name after you arrive and have that printed
 on the cards, too.  Anyone you know reasonably well will be happy to give you one and it's a great talking point.</P>

<hr>

<A NAME="BH"></A>
<H2>Business Hours</H2>

<P>Office hours: 9:00am to 6:00pm Mon-Fri and 9:00am to 12:30pm Sat.</P>

<P>Banks: 9am to 3:30pm Mon-Fri and 9:00am to 12:00pm Sat.</P>

<P>Post Offices: 9:00am to 6:00pm Mon-Sat.</P>

<hr>

<A NAME="Ch"></A>
<H2>Chops</H2>

<P>Chops are name stamps that Chinese people use in the same situations that we use a signature.  They do this because it is quite
 easy to copy hand written Chinese characters and chops provide greater security.  It is a good idea to have one if you want to open a
 bank account or do something like get married.  Signatures are usually acceptable, but Chinese people are not used to them and
 are suspicious of them.</P>

<P>What kind of chop should you buy?  Carved stone chops are a favorite with tourists, but for everyday purposes (and economy), it is
 better to get a simple cheap wooden one made.</P>

<P>From April through to November, you only need light clothing even at night.  From December to March, you may find a
 sweater is necessary during the day, and a jacket at night.</P>

<P>Regarding local customs for clothing, people in Taiwan tend to dress quite modestly and neatly.  As in most places in Asia, sandals,
 vests and shorts are viewed as working or relaxing clothes that are not suitable for wearing to, say, a good restaurant.  For working
 situations, smart clothes are required, but the Chinese have a healthy attitude to such things and you won't get strange looks if your suit
 isn't blue.</P>

<hr>

<A NAME="Co"></A>
<H2>Computers</H2>

<P>Most computer users in Taiwan use an IBM compatible rather than a Mac.  Batteries for notebooks and any other piece of computer
 equipment you might need are easily obtainable.  Most hotel rooms don't have modem connections, so you would have to make use
 of the business center in your hotel.  English language software and books are quite easy to find, if you need them.</P>

<hr>

<A NAME="El"></A>
<H2>Electricity</H2>

<P>110 volts, 60 cycles, AC.  The supply is very reliable except in the summer when there are occasional power cuts due to so many
 aircons working at the same time.</P>

<hr>

<A NAME="ElEq"></A>
<H2>Electronic equipment</H2>

<P>If you need to get something fixed, most large companies will have official dealerships in Taipei and other major cities.</P>

<hr>

<A NAME="Fo"></A>
<H2>Food</H2>

<P>Disposable chopsticks are the norm in most restaurants. 
If you can't use chopsticks, bring your own fork. </P>

<H3>Food Preferences</H3>

<P>Vegetarian food is quite widely available and there are also quite a few Moslem restaurants around.  Finding Kosher food, however, is
 difficult.  For further information about this click here.  If you need Western food, there are lots of the usual fast food places, steak
 restaurants, and coffee shops.  There are also lots of tea houses around.  These may also serve food  and are a great place to 
sample the real Taiwan.</P>

<H3>Detailed Information</H3>

<hr>

<A NAME="HS"></A>
<H2>Health and Sanitation</H2>

<P>The most serious health risks to visitors are crossing the road and eating too
 much.  Taiwan has no malaria, cholera or typhoid.  There isn't supposed to be any rabies, but don't bite any dogs.  Every year, there is a
 small seasonal bout of dengue fever, a mosquito-born viral infection, but this is not a serious consideration for most people as it is very
 limited in range and in the number of people who catch it.  Health and sanitation are of a relatively high level.  It's not as clean as
 Singapore, but then you are permitted to chew gum.  Unless you want something like a brain transplant (you might need one after a while),
 there is a high standard of medical and dental care.  Air and water pollution are seriously bad.</P>

<hr>

<A NAME="MC"></A>
<H2>Money Changing</H2>

<P>Money can be changed at many high street banks and at the airport.  Hotels also change money for guests.  When you by NT$,
 be careful to keep the receipt as you are supposed to present this in order to change money back when you leave.</P>

<P>Travelers' checks can be used at hotels and banks, but not in most other places.</P>

<P>US$ are not accepted as a substitute for NT$ in shops and restaurants.  Those days are long gone.</P>

<hr>

<A NAME="PP"></A>
<H2>Passport Photos</H2>

<P>If you intend to stay in Taiwan for a while and expect to do things such as extend your visa, then get a negative of your passport photo
 that you can use to have prints made.  There are very few photograph machines in Taiwan.  Chinese people tend to use photograph 
stores that develop passport photos from negatives, which most people seem to have.  The photographers will usually offer to make
 you look a lot better than you actually do, so if you are self-conscious about the picture in your passport, this is your chance to fix it up.</P>

<hr>

<A NAME="Ta"></A>
<H2>Taxis</H2>

<P>All taxis have meters.  There are no exceptions to this.  The meter starts at NT$50 and there is a NT$15 surcharge on all journeys.
  After 11 PM, the meter goes faster.</P>

From Taipei train station to the airport, the fare is NT$111 and it takes about 40 minutes in reasonable traffic with buses every 15 or 20
 minutes.</P>

<P>From the domestic airport, which is quite convenient if you are in the main business district, the fare is NTS115 and it takes about 30
 minutes in reasonable traffic.  If you can, take this one.  It is generally faster to take this when there is heavy traffic in Taipei  (which is
 almost always) as it gets on the freeway straight away.</P>

<P>From the airport, the fare downtown is the same, NT$111 with buses every 15 to 20 minutes.  When you get off the bus, you are often
 approached by taxi drivers who quote large sums for short rides.  Don't go for it.  Walk down the road a short distance and you'll be able
 to flag down an honest taxi very quickly.</P>

<P>The bus to the domestic airport is good if you are staying in the north of Taipei.  Even if you're not, you can get off at the Miramar
 Hotel and be in south Taipei very quickly.  It might be more expensive to get to other parts of Taipei this way, but it's a good way to avoid
 the congestion downtown.  The fare for this bus is NT$115.</P>
			</LI>
			<LI><P>Taxis<BR>
The standard calculation for fares from the airport is the meter fare multiplied by 1.5.  To get downtown (Taipei train station) from the
 airport should cost about NT$1200.  To get a taxi to the airport, it should be just the meter charge or you might have to bargain since the
 airport is out of town.</P>

Approval has just been given (November18, '96) for helicopter services around the island.  The fare from the domestic airport to CKS is

<h2>Taiwan Overview: History</h2>
</center>

<p>People inhabited Taiwan for at least 10,000 years. The earliest inhabitants
migrated from the Pacific Islands. The Chinese, mostly from the Fujian
province, first arrived in the 15th century. They replaced the aboriginals
in the fertile west coastal plain. </p>

<p>The Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in Taiwan. They aptly
named the island Ihla Formosa which translates into 'Beautiful Island'.
The Dutch invaded Taiwan in 1624, but were expelled by mainland armies
of Ming Dynasty loyalist Koxinga in 1661. Taiwan became a province of China
in 1887. </p>

<p>As a result of the Sino-Japanese War, China ceded Taiwan to Japan in
1895. The Japanese ruled Taiwan for 50 years until the end of World War
II. </p>

<p>Meanwhile in mainland China, Dr. Sun Yatsen became the first president
of the Republic of China (ROC) after successfully leading a rebellion that
overthrew the Ching Dynasty in 1911. After he left office, a power struggle
ensued. The Nationalist army led by Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek restored
order. The Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang (KMT), soon encountered more
difficulties: imperial Japan in Manchuria and Communism in the countryside.
</p>

<p>Although Japan was defeated in WW II, Commmunism continued to grow stronger.
In 1949, the Communists led by Mao Zedong, gained control of mainland China.
The KMT withdrew to Taiwan. Approximately 1.5 million Chinese fled the
mainland. The KMT built infrastructure and introduced land reforms. The
economy soared due to rapid industrialization and trade. In 1971, the KMT
was forced out of the United Nations seat. In 1979, the United States withdrew
their support for the ROC and recognized the Communist regime on mainland
China. Most countries followed suit. Despite mainland China's tactics to
pressure countries to break all ties with Taiwan, most countries continue
to maintain economic ties. </p>

<p>In 1975, Chiang Kai Shek passed away. His son, Chiang Ching Kuo became
president of the Republic of China in 1978. He died in 1987 after being
re-elected for a second term. Lee Teng Hui, a native Taiwanese, succeeded
him in becoming president. </p>

<p>In retaliation to Lee's historic, high profile visit to the United States
in 1995, mainland China increased its efforts to isolate Taiwan. In an
attempt to influence the presidential elections, mainland China held intense
military exercises near the coast of Taiwan. The United States responded
by sending two carrier groups to monitor the tense region. </p>

<p>On March 23, 1996, the first direct presidential elections were held.
The incumbent Lee triumphed with a 54% of the vote. </p>

<h2>Taiwan Overview: Geography</h2>
</center>

<p>Taiwan is located 160 kilometers (100 miles) off the southeastern province
of Fujian in Mainland China. Korea and Japan is in the north and the Philippines
is in the south. At maximum, Taiwan is 394 kilometers (245 miles) long
and 144 kilometers (89 miles) wide. The total area of the leaf-shaped island
is 35,563 square kilometers (13,896 square miles). Mountains bisect the
island from north to south. Yushan, or Jade Mountain, reaches a height
of 3,952 meters (12,963 feet). 90% of the population reside on the west
side where the land is flat and fertile in contrast to the rocky east coast.
</p>

<p>The Penghu Islands, formerly called the Pescadores, are also part of
Taiwan. In addition to these 64 islands, Taiwan controls three small islands
directly off the coast of mainland China, Kinmen, Matsu, and Wuchiu islands.
Taiwan also lays claim to the Spratly Islands. </p>

<h2>Taiwan Overview: People</h2>
</center>

<p>According to 1991 statistics, the population of Taiwan is 20,489,000.
Despite the declining population growth rate, Taiwan is still one of the most densely populated places in the world with 569.1 persons per square kilometer (1,470 persons per square mile). 
An estimated 2,724,800 live in Taipei, 1,398,700 in Kaohsiung, 764,700 in Taichung, 685,400 in Tainan, and 353,600 in Keelung.</p>

<p>About 14,317,800, or 70% of the population are Taiwanese, or those whose
family resided in Taiwan prior to 1949. 349,120, or 2% of the population,
are aborigines. There are 10 aboriginal tribes: the Ami, Atayal, Bunun,
Paiwan, Puyuma, Rukai, Shao, Saisiat, Tso, and Yami. The <a href="http://www.softidea.com/twhakkausa/">Hakka</a>,
ethnic Chinese from the Henan province in northern China, comprise a tiny
fraction of the population. The rest of the population are mainlanders,
or those who came after 1949. Over 92% of the people are literate. </p>

<h2>Taiwan Overview: Language</h2>
</center>

<p>The official language of Taiwan is Mandarin Chinese which is taught
in schools. Most people however <a href="http://www.formosa.com/taibun/classroom.html">speak
Taiwanese </a>at home while reserving Chinese for outsiders. Mandarin Chinese
spoken in Taiwan is virtually identical to the mainland. However, 50 years
of separation have resulted in some slight differences, the most noticeable
being the use of 'si' instead of 'shi' in Taiwan. Taiwanese similar to
the Fujian dialect spoken on the mainland. It has no written script. </p>

<p>Both Mandarin and Taiwanese are tonal languages. Words with the same
spelling and pronuniciation can have different meanings depending on the
tone. Mandarin has four tones. Therefore, it is easier to learn
Mandarin</a> than other Chinese dialects which may have as many as nine
different tones. Learning to speak is easier than learning to write since
there is no alphabet in Chinese. Instead there are characters. Currently,
there are 5,000 Chinese characters in use of which a minimum of 2000 characters
is required for reading a newspaper.</p>

<p>English is becoming increasingly important and widespread. An English-speaking
foreigner will have no problem finding English teaching
jobs or finding English-Chinese language
exchange</a> partners. Students formally start to learn English in junior
high school. The government is presently considering making English a required
subject in elementary school. Many parents send their kids, some as young
as six, to English bushibans where they get a head start. </p>

<p>As a result of the 50-year Japanese occupation of Taiwan, most of the
older generation can speak some Japanese. Some youngsters are capable of
a limited number of phrases, such as 'bakayaroo' or 'arigatoo gozaimas'
due to the wide availability of Japanese cartoons and TV programs. </p>

<p>Other languages spoken on the island are Hakka and the 10 tribal languages.
Their use is on the decline, however. </p>

<p>The predominant religions in Taiwan are <a href="http://www.kosone.com/people/ocrt/buddhism.htm">Buddhism</a>
and Taoism. Most Chinese believe in both. Buddhist temples usually house
an image or statue of Kuan Yin, the goddess of mercy, whereas Taoist temples
house Matsu, the goddess of the the sea. Due to active missionaries, an
ever increasing number of people are becoming Christians. </p>

<h2>Taiwan Overview: Culture</h2>
</center>

<p>The Chinese culture is one of the oldest surviving civilizations in
the world. <a href="http://www.npm.gov.tw/english/">The National Palace
Museum</a> in Taipei, the world's largest collection of Chinese artefacts,
paintings, and calligraphy, represents more than 3000 years of culture.
</p>

<p>Confucianism contributed to Chinese thought and conduct. Hence, the
Chinese emphasize respect for elders, importance of family and friends,
and awareness of relationships and obligations. </p>

<p>Taiwan today is an interesting mix of new and old. The booming export
driven economy has brought enormous wealth, new technology, as well as
Western tastes in music, food, clothing, and entertainment to the island.
Basketball and McDonalds are popular among the youngsters. Japanese influence
is visible in Taiwan also. For example, KTVs, or karaokes, pachinko parlors,
tatami rooms, Japanese cartoons such as Slam Dunk, and video games are
common.</p>

<h2>Taiwan Overview: Government</h2>
</center>

<p>According to Article 1 of the <a href="http://peacock.tnjc.edu.tw/ADD/constitution/main.htm">Constitution
of the Republic of China</a>, "The Republic of China, founded on the
Three Principles of the People, shall be a democratic republic of the people,
to be governed by the people, and for the people."</p>

<p>The central government consists of the Office of the President, the
National Assembly, and five branches, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative
Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Examination Yuan, and the Control Yuan. </p>

<p>Until recently, the people elected the members of the National Assembly
which then chose the president and the vice-president. With the passage
of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law on July
21, 1995, however, the people will directly elect the president and vice
president.</p>

<h2>Taiwan Overview: Politics</h2>
</center>

<p>Currently, there are three major parties in Taiwan, the <a href="http://www2.best.com/~kmtroc/">Kuomintang</a>
(KMT), the <a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/dpp/">Democratic
Progressive Party</a> (DPP), and the <a href="http://www.np.org.tw/">New
Party</a> (NP).</p>

<p>The Kuomintang, formed in 1894, is the current ruling party with an
estimated 1.9 million members. The Democratic Progressive Party, formed
on September 28, 1986 has 90,000 members. The New Party, formed in August
1993, claims about&nbsp; 60,000 members. The DPP advocates Taiwan independence,
whereas the KMT and the NP favor unification with mainland China. </p>

<p>The minimum age for voting is 20. There are no gender, property, or
educational requirements.</p>

<P>Hinet is cheap, but there are just too many people signed up with them.  From 3:30PM to dinner time and from 9:30PM to midnight,
 you will be lucky to get through to them and if you do, the server will be working so slowly that you could get timed out while your 
waiting for your password to be accepted.  During the day, they are just fine, however, and if you don't use the Internet much, they're not a
 bad deal for the money.</P>

<P>From the point of view of service, SEEDNet is pretty much the same as Hinet.  It is a bit cheaper, but the advantage of this may be offset 
by SEEDNet's slower modems and dependence on Hinet.</P>

<P>SEEDNet has two different deals, both of which require an NT$200 application fee.  One is based on a basic monthly fee of NT$170 plus
 NT$0.4 for every minute used.  With the other, you just pay in advance for a certain number of hours.  The latter deal works out much 
cheaper for all concerned.  All prices given below include the application fee.</P>

			<P>This company is the IBM ISP in Taiwan.  Their English home page makes a good impression, but we'd like to see the price 
structure explained in English.  The price structure is somewhat complicated as it's based on a "card" system for casual users (NT$1,000
 per card, buy 5 get 1 free) and a separate 3 monthly deal (NT$3,200 per month for 30 mins/day plus NT$0.4 for every extra minute).  We
 suppose this is for more convenience rather than economy because the numbers work out a bit odd.  Homer's boss 
would use the card system and so would Crusty the Clown.  On the other hand, Homer would go with the 3 monthly deal (assuming he has
 a computer to work out the numbers).</P>

<P>This company has a reputation for friendly service and its main customer base seems to be foreigners.  They give 8 hours of
 Internet training in either English or Chinese with every account.

<P>Their price structure for individuals is very simple.  There are only two prices, one for a shell account (for practical purposes, e-mail),
 which costs NT$7,000 per year, and the other for a PPP account (Internet connection), which costs NT$10,000 per year.  A bit expensive,
 but all accounts are unlimited usage, which makes the arithmetic easy for us!

<h3>A New Director for AIT</h3>

<P><IMG SRC="interview_darryl.jpg" ALT="Photo of Darryl Johnson" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=10>There are certain jobs in certain places in this world that require a lifetime of experience.  Being the Director of the American Institute
 in Taiwan is one such job and the latest person to hold this position, Darryl Johnson, is a man whose long and distinguished diplomatic
 career combined with a long association with this region make him an ideal fit.</P>

<P>Sitting back in a comfortable armchair in his office, setting you at ease with his own relaxed manner, Darryl Johnson is every inch a
 diplomat.  Amiable and articulate, he reels off his list of postings to places like Beijing and Moscow with a modesty that belies
 their difficulty and somehow manages to forget to mention that he's just done a stint in Bosnia.</P>

<P>What led him to decide on a career as a diplomat?  Born in 1938 in Chicago, he grew up in Seattle, Washington.  His grandparents
 were settlers in the Mid-West.  His father learned to fly the same year that Lindberg flew the Atlantic, "When flying really was an
 adventure", and he feels that there's a certain "frontier spirit" in his blood.  After getting his BA from the University of Washington, he
 did graduate studies at the Universtiy of Minnesota and at Princeton.  In 1963, he went to Thailand with the Peace Corps.</P>

<P>It was his two years experience of living in Thailand, he says, that helped him decide on a career in the foreign service.  Why?
  Because, in his own words, "The mid-sixties was a time of great confrontation in Asia and I was at an age when my own attitudes to
 Asian culture and politics were still being formed."  He wanted to do something about it and it seemed to him that the best way to make
 a contribution to reducing confrontation was to become a diplomat.</P>

<P>After being accepted into the foreign service, he was posted to New Delhi and in 1969 he was sent to Taiwan to learn Chinese for
 a year in Taichung.  "It's unrecognizable now", but, surprisingly, he says the traffic is better now than it was then - "not so many ox-carts
 and bicycles."  From here, he went to Hong Kong for four years from '69 to '73 and then to Moscow, so he has a perspective on relations
 with Mainland China that includes both Russia and India.  Following 3 years in Beijing, he was posted to Poland, where he witnessed the
 first ever occasion on which a Communist government was ousted in a democratic election.  Since then, apart from a period in
 Washington and at the UN, he served in Yugoslavia, and had the honor of opening the US Embassy in Lithuania.</P>

<P>Asked if Taiwan has any lessons for the new democracies of Eastern Europe, he says that the process of democratization took
 place at much the same time in both places, so it is a matter of shared experience rather than one giving a lesson to the other.  On the
 other hand, in terms of maintaining a stable currency, encouragement of hi-tech industry, and education, Taiwan certainly has some 
lessons for Eastern Europe.</P>

<H3>Helping American Business in Taiwan</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>"This is a field in which we hope the solid base from which we are beginning will grow yet further ... Promoting American business
 interests is part of our job and it's one in which we think there is more progress to be made."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>On promoting American business interests in Taiwan, Director Johnson seems very positive, asserting that America is only asking
 for a level playing field for businesses to compete on and it is in the interests of everyone to have this, including the citizens of Taiwan;
 prices will come down and services will be made available more efficiently.  In addition, he says, some in the ROC government see this
 as consistent with making Taiwan a regional center.  His aim is therefore to have any factors which distort free trade removed.</P>

<P>Darryl Johnson would like small and medium sized businesses to become more aware that there is a market here.  He points out
 that most of the 30,000 or so US citizens in Taiwan are here for business, so a lot of people do know about Taiwan; however, many
 of these are with larger companies and AIT does what it can to reach out to a broader spectrum of small and medium sized US businesses
 and help them learn about opportunities here.  To further this aim, information on Taiwan enterprises that want to establish a business
 relationship with a US company is sent back to the US where it is distributed throughout the country to commerce field offices.
  In addition, AIT helps businesses to come to Taiwan to develop relationships.</A></P>

<a name="ait"></a>
<hr>
<H3>What else does AIT do?</H3>

<P>For Taiwanese people, the main service AIT provides is issuing visas.  Last year, AIT issued more than 370,000 visas, which is more
 than any other US Foreign Service post in the world.  Director Johnson also pointed out that almost everyone who applies receives a visa.
  For American citizens, AIT provides notarial services, registration for US citizens living in Taiwan so that they can be contacted in
 emergency, voter registration together with postcard applications for absentee ballots, and tax services.</P>

<a name="internet"></a>
<hr>
<H3>AIT and the Internet</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>"We would like to feel that we are at the forefront of information technology and in Taipei we have sought to make use of the facilities
 provided by the Internet to get our message out to a broader audience ... We are only limited by our capacity to think of ways to use the
 Internet."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A  HREF="http://ait.org.tw/">AIT</a> has a very good homepage. The reason for this, according to Director Johnson, is that there are a lot of people in Taiwan who
 are on the Internet - many more than would come through the doors of AIT to go to the library or an event that they are sponsoring - so the
 purpose of the homepage is to make maximum use of the Internet to reach out to this audience.  The homepage is also used to broadcast
 commercial information which might be useful to American or Taiwan businesses.</P>

<a name="message"></a>
<hr>
<H3>Cyber-message</H3>

<P><When asked if he had a message for our readers, Director Johnson had this to say,</P>

<p>


<A NAME="Q1"></A>

<HR>

<H3>
1. Thank you for sparing the time to talk to us Mr. Yen.  To begin with, could you tell us who the members of the Taiwan Visitors Association are?
</H3>

<p>
<IMG SRC="interview_stanley1.jpg" WIDTH=210 HEIGHT=139 ALIGN="left" HSPACE=10>
Well the TVA consists of the government bodies which are the Tourism Bureau and also the Provincial Government. 
Also, we have various associations such as those in the counties. 
We also have all the major airlines and most of the travel associations related to the travel industry. 
In addition, of course, the bulk of members are the travel agents who handle inbound and also outbound tourism. 
All the five star hotels on the island are members. 
There are also members from the publishing business, amusement parks, and museums. 
So, the membership consists basically of all those whose business is related in some way to tourism.
Our board members meet on a monthly basis to review tourism events and activities. 
This is also a vehicle for the private sector and the government to get together to talk about issues that concern us.</P>



<A NAME="Q2"></A>
<HR>

<h3>
2. Can you tell us something about the history of the TVA?
</H3>

<P>The TVA is celebrating it's fortieth anniversary this year. 
It is the oldest travel organization on the island. 
Before the government established the Tourism Bureau, the TVA was responsible for overall promotion of tourism in Taiwan, so the very first Chairman was the mayor of Taipei at that time. 
Still today, we have former vice-president, Mr. Hsieh, as our Honorary Chairman.</P>


<A NAME="Q3"></A>

<HR>
<H3>
3. What is the role of the TVA?
</H3>

<P>The TVA has many roles to play. 
We do a lot of promotion, sending delegations all over the world to promote the country. 
On average, we have to go to Japan and Europe a minimum of twice a year and a few times to the US. 
In addition, we do promotional trips to Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand - anywhere we think there might be a potential market.</P>  

<P>We help local county associations in packaging tourist attractions and improve facilities and we do whatever we can to help the private sector solve problems. 
Two years ago, the TVA launched a campaign through public hearings to lobby the government to remove visa requirements for foreign countries. 
As a result of that, over the last two years the number of tourists has increased by 700,000. 
I wouldn't say that we should take all the credit for this, but we can claim a good portion of it.</P>



<A NAME="Q4"></A>

<HR>



<H3>
4. How would you describe the typical tourist in Taiwan?
</H3>

<P>We have a lot of the traditional type of tourist who comes here to eat good food, go to the museum and see the scenery.  But, in addition, what we are trying to focus on right now is to let people see Taiwan as a unique destination to see Chinese culture.  Taiwan's food industry has been tremendously successful.  Taiwan has a variety of Chinese food and over the last few years, we have managed to improve the quality.  Just not long ago, writers in the New York Times and the Readers Digest recognized that Taiwan has the best Chinese food in the world.  Certainly, we have the best variety here.</P>

<P>We are now trying to promote Taiwan with the younger generation.  We also promote a lot of female visitors, for example, from Japan, which we believe is becoming a major trend.  We have just been doing some promotion in Hong Kong for the same reason.</P>  



<A NAME="Q5"></A>

<HR>


<H3>
5. What are the attractions that Taiwan has for these tourists?
</H3>

<P>I just hosted 20 journalists from Hong Kong.  They loved it.  Every night they visited three different pubs.  They went to Kiss Disco.  They went to the Indian Beer House.  I took them to Chou Fen, an old gold mining town which has now almost disappeared.  A lot of artists live there and the scenery is fantastic.</P>

<P>There's a lot to be said for Green Island.  I just went there two days ago to do some research.  It's really open now and the Tourism Bureau has done a lot there.</P>

<P>As for museums, the National Palace Museum is one of the best Chinese museums in the world.</P>

<P>I guess it's a matter of how you package.  We have a very good convention center, but we only have 20 international conventions a year.  Singapore has nothing much to see compared to Taiwan.  They have six million visitors a year and last year they had over 200 international conventions.  If the government would pay a little bit more attention to the tourism industry, we would be doing a far better job than Singapore could do.</P>

<P>Taiwan needs so many friends right now. 
We lost our seat in the UN. 
Not too many countries recognize us and tourism is one of the best vehicles to promote the image of this country - I believe that. 
Unfortunately, I don't think our government understands that. 
The Singapore government subsidizes these conventions, but they get all the money back from increased tourism. 
Even, Lee Kwan-Yu speaks at these conventions.  Lee Kwan-Yu is Singapore. 
If we had a convention with Japanese people and our president spoke to them in Japanese the way that Lee Kwan-Yu speaks to people, those Japanese people would love him.</P>


<A NAME="Q6"></A>

<HR>


<H3>
6. Are FITs an important market sector for tourism in Taiwan?  Is there anything you can do to help them?
</H3>

<P>Yes, I think so. I would like to see more and more independent travelers.  As the travelers become more sophisticated, they like to have that flexibility.  I think Taiwan should try to make the tourist feel comfortable to travel by themselves, to feel safe and to feel welcomed. 
Taiwan does these things quite well, but I think how to make them feel safe in the traffic and how to get enough directions are areas where we could improve.</P>


<A NAME="Q7"></A>

<HR>

<H3>
7. From the tour operators' point of view, what are the advantages of bringing a group to Taiwan?
</H3>

<P>I just went to Europe and I spoke to tour operators there.  I told them that everybody is crazy about going Hong Kong, but they go there for one week. 
Hong Kong is a place you must go to, but it's so expensive right now and it's hard to get hotel space. 
It would make their life a lot easier if they could spend five days in Taiwan and two days in Hong Kong. 
There are a lot of things you can only do in Taiwan. 
I've taken people to pick tea and show them the fermentation process. 
I've taken people early in the morning to see the opera students practicing.</P>

<A NAME="Q8"></A>

<HR>


<H3>
8. Are there any promotional events organized by the TVA?  Do you have any involvement in the numerous festivals that are held around Taiwan?
</H3>

<P>We are also involved with a lot of local activities such as the Taipei International Travel Fair which is a biannual event organized by the TVA. 
In addition, we are involved in the Lantern Festival which is an annual event.  We also do many medium sized events. 
Every August, we have a Sino-Japanese folk dance festival where we have close to 200 folk dance troupes from Japan and Taiwan also organizes some aboriginal and other local cultural dancing artists to perform.</P>

<P>We are also involved in some food activities. 
I am the Chairman of the Chinese Food Promotion Council which is one of the committees under the TVA.  We, overall, help to upgrade the food industry in Taiwan in terms of training and managing some necessary lectures and exhibitions to promote food as one of the tourist attractions for people to visit this country.</P>

<A NAME="Q9"></A>

<HR>

<H3>
9. There is a lot of talk about direct links to the Mainland. 
From the TVA's point of view, if this ever happened, would it have any consequences for tourism in Taiwan?
</H3>

<P>We would like to see it opened up. 
From my personal view point, we shouldn't look at this as a business opportunity.  We should look at it as a way to communicate, as a way to let both parties learn more about each other.  We need more people, especially high ranking government officials and other leaders to come to see the real Taiwan.  Once you get to appreciate each others problems, I think we will have better understanding.</P>

<A NAME="Q10"></A>

<HR>

<H3>
10. Do you have an Internet home page? 
Do you think that having a presence on the Internet is important to tourism promotion?
</H3>

<P>As far as our hotel is concerned, we have an Internet link up, but so far we haven't been able to link it up to every room.</P>

<P>I think it will take a little while, but I think it will become more important <A HREF="#Q11">in the near future.</A></P>


<A NAME="Q11"></A>

<HR>
<H3>
11. What do you see for the future of tourism in Taiwan?
</H3>

<IMG SRC="interview_stanley2.jpg" WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=160 ALIGN="left" HSPACE=10>
I would like to see more convention business and I'd like to see this country become more sophisticated. 
I'd like to see more independent travelers and more young people come to Taiwan to see the country by themselves. 
Also, I'd like to see more good hotels open up in the south of Taiwan.</P>

<P>Tourism should not only be regarded as a business operation, but also as a vehicle to promote the image of this country and establish friendship with the world. 
That should be an important element of this business.</P>

</ul>

<p>

<A NAME="Q1"></A>

<HR>
<H3>
1. Thank you for sparing the time to talk to us Mr. Tuo. 
To begin with, could you tell us what the role of the TTB is?
</H3>

<p>

<IMG SRC="interview_tuo.jpg" ALT="Photograph of Mr. Tuo" align=left hspace=10>
The TTB has three roles.  First, we oversee the development of scenic areas and construction related them and we assist local governments with this, too.  Second, we provide service to the tourism industry in the form of licensing hotels, travel agents and tour guides. 
Included in this service role is assistance in management and training and we help to solve problems such as waste disposal.  Thirdly, we promote inbound and outbound travel.  With regard to outbound travel, we provide assistance to Taiwan tourists who may have problems while traveling.


<A NAME="Q2"></A>

<HR>


<H3>
2. How important is tourism to the economy of Taiwan?
</H3>


<P>As a percentage of our GDP, tourism is not very important compared to what it is in other countries and also compared to other industries in Taiwan. 
However, it is very important in certain local areas such as Kenting.</P>


<A NAME="Q3"></A>
<HR>

<H3>
3. Do you have any overseas offices?  If so, what do these offices do to promote tourism in Taiwan?
</H3>



<P>
We currently have nine overseas offices. 
They do promotion in the form of distributing information - brochures and things like that - and they assist tour operators who bring groups to Taiwan. 
These offices also help Taiwan tourists in those countries.</P>

<A NAME="Q4"></A>

<HR>


<H3>
4. What is the greatest challenge in marketing Taiwan as a tourist destination?
</H3>

<P>Our greatest challenge is international competition. 
Everybody wants new products. 
Everybody wants their own uniqueness and it is very hard to maintain uniqueness. 
As soon as one country has a good idea, all the others will copy it if they can.</P>

<P>Another problem is that the TTB just does not have enough money or manpower to do what we know we could do. 
With more money we could do much better.</P>


<A NAME="Q5"></A>

<HR>


<H3>
5. Is there any particular market sector that you are trying to develop? If so, what?
</H3>


<P>Well, the biggest market is Japan. 
Japanese have a very high spending power. 
Within that market, we are targeting young females. 
We are also targeting the Hong Kong market. 
You might think that is strange because the change over in 1997 may have some influence on that market, but we think young Hong Kong FIT travelers will be interested in coming to Taiwan.</P>

<P>The European market and, in particular, the convention market is something we’re looking at now.  Recently, we’ve found a lot of interest in this from Europeans.  Now we have new visa regulations, visitors can get a 14 day visa on arrival and we are hoping business travelers will stay on a little longer to enjoy the island. 
The new visa regulations have been very helpful to us.</P>


<A NAME="Q6"></A>

<HR>


<H3>
6. From the individual or group tourists' point of view, what are the advantages of coming to Taiwan as opposed to a neighboring country such as Korea?
</H3>


<P>Taiwan has a central location and it is very safe and hospitable. 
Maybe I could say convenience is one of our strong points because we have everything in a small place. 
For the tourist, I like to compare Taiwan to a department store. 
We don't have the best, but what we have is very good and we do have everything. 
High mountains, beautiful beaches, good food - you name it, we have it. 
And, again, I would emphasize that Taiwan is very safe.</P>


<A NAME="Q7"></A>

<HR>

  
<H3>
7. There are quite a few festivals and holidays in Taiwan, such as the Dragon Boat Festival and the Lantern Festival. 
Do you play any part in supporting or arranging such events? 
Which of these events are the most important in attracting foreign tourists to Taiwan?
</H3>


<P>We are responsible for the Lantern Festival and this is the most important festival in terms of attracting tourists. 
The Lantern Festival was first held in 1990 and attracted only a few hundred tourists. 
This year we had 4000 tourists in groups. 
We don't know the number of FITs who went to see it, but there must have been quite a few of those.</P>

<P>For other festivals we provide manpower to help with the language problem. 
For example, the Dragon Boat Festival attracted 16 foreign teams this year so we helped the organizers with training in how to deal with foreign guests and promotion in the form of newsletters and brochures overseas.</P>


<A NAME="Q8"></A>

<HR>


<H3>   
8. There is a lot of talk about possible direct links to the Mainland.  From the TTB's point of view, if it ever happened, would it have any consequences for tourism in Taiwan?
</H3>

<P>This is a very hot issue right now. 
If it happens, Mainland Chinese might be allowed to come in as tourists. 
Whether this will happen overnight or in 20 years, we don't know. 
For sure, if we opened the door, their would be a flood, but for the long term we don't know what effects there would be on tourism here.</P>


<A NAME="Q9"></A>

<HR>


<H3>
9. We see that you have an Internet home page?  Do you think that having a presence on the Internet is important to tourism promotion?
</H3>

<P>At the moment, not really, but the next two or three years will be much more important. 
We are considering providing more information for FITs. 
For example, we might put Internet machines in the train station.</P>

<A NAME="Q10"></A>

<HR>

<H3>
10. What do you see for the future of tourism in Taiwan?
</H3>

<P>People are getting richer and travel is getting easier. 
For us, the most important point is how to use our uniqueness to survive the competition. 
We have to increase the supply of hotel rooms with a range of prices to suit all budgets.  We want to have more clean, safe, comfortable, budget hotels just like you can find in Europe. 
All together, I believe we have a very bright future.</P>

<center><H1>The Taipei International<BR> Express Chinfon Marathon</H1></center>

<BR>

<P>This month our feature article is on the Taipei International Express Chinfon Marathon.  To hold a marathon in Taipei is a feat
 of determination and organization.  We see why this is so and why the organizers are so determined to carry on their work.

<TABLE ALIGN=left>
	<CAPTION ALIGN=bottom><B>Winner of the Men's Race: Victor Boukanov</B></CAPTION>
		<TR>
			<TD><IMG SRC="event_marathon_run.jpg" ALT="Victor Boukanov" ALIGN="left" VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5></TD>
		</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>Someone once said that if you are considering running in a marathon and doing the necessary training for it, you should consult
 your doctor and that if you were considering doing this in Taipei, you had better consult your psychiatrist.  But, things are changing.  Early
 on the morning of Sunday, November 24, some 1,400 intrepid souls, including 400 or so international participants, set off on the fifth
 Taipei Marathon.</P>

<P>The course was mostly flat, with approximately 300 meters of gradual incline to get up onto the highway section, which made up
 32.4 km of the race. The race was run in near perfect weather conditions for a marathon - 22&#186; C with a very light wind and no rain.  In the
 men's race, Victor Boukhanov of the Ukraine won the first prize of US$20,000 with a time of 2:21:00, closely followed by Vladimir Epanov
 of Russia with 2:21:06 and Knut Hevgold of Norway with 2:21:17.  The highest placed Taiwanese runner was W. Wu, who came
 in seventh with 2:24:31.</P>

<P>In the women's race, performances were more respectable.  Kryza Violetta won with 2:42:58, followed by Lutsia Beliaeve of Russia
 with 2:47:05 and Beverly Lucas of Australia with 2:47:26.</P>

<TABLE ALIGN=right>
	<CAPTION ALIGN=bottom><B>Winner of the Women's Race:<BR> Kryza Violetta</B></CAPTION>
		<TR>
			<TD><IMG  SRC="event_marathon_woman.jpg" ALT="Kryza Violetta" ALIGN="center"></P></TD>
		</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>Marathon experts will note that the times are not impressive, but these don't tell the whole story.  Just having the race in Taipei is a
 feat in itself.  What the event can do to get Taiwan noticed on the world scene and to encourage distance running amongst Taiwanese are
 considerations that are much more important than winning times.  Over the years, this race has faced huge problems.  To hold a marathon
 race in any large city is no easy task when you consider traffic problems.  Especially in a city like Taipei, with its pollution,
 construction, and congestion, then you'd better think twice before organizing such an event.</P>

<P>The first Taipei International Marathon was held in 1987, but because of the horrendous amount of construction going on, the race was
 not held in 1988, 1989, 1990,  or 1991.  This might have been the end of the marathon, but for three factors.  First, according to Sunny
 Chen, Secretary General of the Chinese Taipei Road Running Association, organizers of the race, the CTRRA wanted to use the race to
 encourage people to take up running.  Second, as an international event, the marathon presented an ideal opportunity to let the rest of the 
world know about Taiwan and to further relations between Taiwan and other countries (even if only on the level of personal friendships).
  Last, the construction and traffic problems are being solved; runners will not get bronchitis, fall into large craters, or get stuck in traffic
 jams.  There is a much greater danger of international participants having a seriously good time while they are here.</P>

<P>Obstacles the CTRRA does face in organizing the race are financial.  The entry fee is only NT$300 and they receive no financial help
 other than free police support from the city government.  Funding is completely from corporate sponsors such as this year's main sponsor,
 Chinfon.  This means that publicity for the race is not as good as it should be.  The race is now an established annual event, however,
 and the organizers are determined to keep it going.</P>

<P>The date for 1997's race is November 23.  For further information, on the 1996 marathon and next year's marathon, try

<h2>Police</h2>
</center>

The following police numbers can be used by foreigners who need help or those applying for visas. 
Please note that these are not the only English speaking police services. 
Local police headquarters also have departments that handle foreign affairs and these often have English speaking staff. 
You may also find that some staff at the stations below speak languages other than English.
<p>
Something else to note is that these are not neccessarily the stations to report to for the annual foreigners' census. 
For this you need to go to your local police headquarters. 
You can find out where this is from the station where you apply for your visa.

<h2>The Community Services Center</h2>

The Community Services Center is a non-profit organization which offers services to meet the mental health, educational, and social service needs of the international community (both individuals and companies) in Taipei.

<h2>Gateway</h2>

<p>
Gateway is people and it's information.  
When you first arrive in Taiwan, there are times when you feel lonely and unable to cope with so much that is new and different.  
You don't have to struggle on alone.  
Gateway has a coffee break every Wednesday at 10am - for newcomers and oldtimers alike.  
Come and make new friends.
<p>
They have information on all kinds of things - from getting around and shopping to coping with household pests.  
Their reception area is well-stocked with information from other community organizations, and offers an active bulletin board with notices of events, activities, and personals including help wanted/available and buy/sell opportunities.

<h2>The National Network of Foreign Spouses</h2>

<P>This organization advises foreign spouses on how to negotiate the bureaucratic maze involved with visas, work permits, Alien Resident Certificates, property ownership, children's schooling, health care, and other issues relevant to their livelihood.  
They publish a bilingual "Basic Information Packet" (BIP) which is available from the address given in the Directory of Expatriate Social Services above.  
The minimum donation for this weighty document, as of April 18, 1996, is

	<UL>
		<LI>Individual or family:  NT$1250
		<LI>Organization, corporate, etc.:  NT$1500
	</UL>

<P>
For more information on methods of payment etc., you'd better write them or look for their ad in the China Post.

<h2>Understanding Chinese Addresses</h2>
</center>

Chinese addresses seem complicated but once you understand the system, it's usually easy to find the place you want.  
Addresses include roads and street and then lanes and alleys which are numbered.  
The number of the lane or alley is the number of the house on the corner.  
Long roads have sections with the numbers getting higher as you go out of town. 
Let's say you're looking for the following address:
<P>
<CENTER>Chung Shan N. Rd., Sec. 5, Lane 27, Alley 10, #31</CENTER></P>
<P>
Once you find section 5, you have to look for house number 27.  
Here, you should find a lane.  
Go down this lane to house number 10.  
Here, you will find an alley leading off.  
Your destination is in this alley.

<h1 align=center>Crisis Response</h1>
<hr noshade>
<p>If a client falls victim to an acute crisis, such as an abduction, a product extortion or a political detention, Control Risks 
will immediately deploy a consultant to evaluate the circumstances, advise on possible options and explain the likely 
sequence of events. The consultant will remain with the client to advise on negotiation strategies, liaison with local law 
enforcement and (in the case of kidnap or detention) rehabilitating the victim. Control Risks&#146; role is strictly advisory - 
we do not intervene. We help bring order and a decision-making structure to what is usually a chaotic and 
emotionally-charged situation, often with many competing interest groups. Control Risks has handled over 650 such 
crises - more than any other company in this field. Drawing directly on this expertise, our consultants prepare crisis 
management plans which enable clients to anticipate events and retain the initiative in handling crises.</p>

<p>Control Risks advises organisations on developing and implementing an overall corporate 
security strategy. In particular, we advise organisations how to reduce the risks to their 
people, information and physical assets. When the threat to business is particularly acute, 
Control Risks deploys specialist security co-ordinators to operations such as mines, 
construction sites or oil installations. The co-ordinators identify security requirements and 
remain on site to provide daily protection management. Most of Control Risks&#146; security 
consultants have government service or engineering backgrounds.</p>

<p>Proper appreciation of political and security risks will influence how - and where - you do business. Failure to take

which could affect your ability to conduct operations and by forecasting developments. Our two online services provide 
daily analysis of worldwide events for both corporate management and the individual business traveller. For longer-term 
assessments and detailed forecasts, clients commission specific reports on a country, region or topic. Our in-house team 
of analysts is supported by a worldwide network of retained correspondents.</p>

<h2><a name="Business fears instability">Business fears
instability</a></h2>
<p><i>Political instability and legal inadequacies pose the
greatest threats to companies operating in emerging markets,
according to an international poll commissioned by Control Risks.
Managing director </i><b><i>Nigel Churton</i></b><i> looks ahead
to a turbulent 1996.</i></p>
<p>The results of the poll (which was conducted by the Industrial
Research Bureau among top companies in the UK and US) are
contained in <i>Business Security Outlook</i>, Control Risks'
annual preview of international political and business
developments.</p>
<p>That the respondents to the poll saw political instability and
regulatory inadequacies as the biggest threat to business in
emerging markets reflects a definite shift in business thinking.
The findings contrast sharply with a similar survey in late 1994,
when fraud and crime were rated the biggest threats to business.
Executives are becoming used to organised crime and fraud, but -
as the full impact of the end of the Cold War is felt - they are
increasingly worried about factors over which they have little
control, such as political instability and inadequate
legislation.</p>
<h3><b>Political instability</b> </h3>
<p>At first glance, political worries in 1996 are perhaps greater
than they have been for some time. Elections are due in some of
the world's biggest emerging markets, including Russia and India,
and the prospect of new leadership in China appears increasingly
likely - though paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's health continues
to defy conventional medical prognosis. In the Middle East, much
will depend on the Israeli electorate, which goes to the polls in
October: a victory for the right-wing Likud party could derail
the entire peace process.</p>
<h3><b>Legal inadequacies</b></h3>
<p>Lack of stable political systems can lead to regulatory
anomalies. In many developing countries, where opportunities far
outstrip legislation, business has to contend with arbitrary
rulings or piecemeal reforms. As a result, companies have no
clear framework in which to operate, and have to keep constantly
looking over their shoulders. While political uncertainty
persists, administrations will lack the resources or
determination to rectify the problem.</p>

        <h2><b>a conflict for British industry?</b> </h2>
    </dd>
</dl>
<p><b>By John Conyngham<br>
Director, International Investigations</b></p>
<p>As information becomes the most strategic asset a company can
possess, companies are increasingly conducting industrial
espionage against their competitors. For example, National Car
Parks in the UK allegedly retained a company to infiltrate and
spy on its competitor Europarks. A female former Army officer
gained the position of personal assistant to Europarks' chairman
and then passed sensitive information to NCP. </p>
<p>Business must also guard against the entrepreneurial spy whose
actions are motivated solely by profit - the 'information
broker'. Again in the UK, the Channel Tunnel project suffered in
this respect, with a project manager found guilty of selling
confidential data to an information broker. It has been estimated
that more than half of all acts of industrial espionage are
committed by insiders. </p>
<p>So how can business properly respond to these threats? Since
information is the key to gaining an advantage on one's
competitors, it follows that information is also the key to
defending oneself against industrial espionage. In order to
address these legitimate needs for information, recent years have
witnessed the growth of a vast new business intelligence
industry. </p>
<p>Here, the lines become blurred. Where does strategic
intelligence-gathering end and industrial espionage begin? Given
the fractured state of the law on this issue, an adequate legal
distinction is often hard to draw. As the judge in the NCP case
observed, &quot;It is no crime to commit industrial espionage.
You are not making a moral judgement in this case. Trespass is
not a crime. Infiltration is not a crime.&quot; The distinction
between wrongful industrial espionage and proper
intelligence-gathering frequently depends upon the dictates of
professional ethics. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the business intelligence industry has
developed something of a reputation for a readiness to take the
law into its own hands or to side-step it altogether. Electronic
bugging, wiretapping, computer hacking and even blackmail are
often thought to be standard tools of the trade. This false
assumption is fostered by the activities of the unscrupulous few
whose methods are avoided by those who regard the provision of
business intelligence as a profession. </p>
<p>Business intelligence acquirers are available to serve their
clients' <b>legitimate</b> needs for strategic information and
for security and business risk analysis. In doing so, they should
be guided by a professional ethic which recognises that a
client's needs are best served by working within the law and -
where appropriate - alongside law enforcement officials. Those
who feel that they may serve their clients better by operating
outside the law are no better than the criminals they purport to
oppose. Moreover, their activities compromise their client's
integrity and reputation, and may leave them vulnerable to
possible legal action. Such individuals have no place in this
business. </p>
<p>The professional business intelligence providers do not,
therefore, transfer confidential documents. They do not employ
illegal or illicit means of data-gathering. They do not tap
people's phones, hack into their computer systems or seek to
obtain information through bribes. Nor do they advise their
clients to adopt these methods. </p>
<p>Rather, the professionals serve their clients' needs for
strategic intelligence by subjecting publicly available
information to rigorous and multi-disciplinary analysis, allowing
for the conversion of raw data into useful intelligence. </p>
<p>Business therefore needs such information to monitor the
activities of competitors, plan entry strategies into new areas,
analyse potential merger or acquisition targets, know of the
availability of high-calibre potential employees, know of
potential legislative changes which would impact on its business,
and know what technological innovations could affect its
business. </p>
<p>The professional business intelligence provider will help
companies address these needs by analysing information gained
from public records, commercial databases, systematic
interviewing of industry and country specialists, perceptions of
the relevant industry's future structure, and due diligence
enquiries in relation to target companies. </p>
<p>Therefore, there should be no conflict of interest between law
enforcement and industry. Industry must not allow an important
management tool to be outlawed by the excesses of the few, but it
equally must ensure that its ethics match those expected by the
public.</p>

<h2><a name="Stalkers: a new form of fear, threat and violence"><b>Stalkers:
a new form of fear, threat and violence</b></a></h2>
<p><b>By Clint van Zandt</b></p>
<p>What have Princess Anne, Madonna and Helena Bonham Carter got
in common? Answer: they've all been 'stalked'. They've all
suffered the unwanted, obsessive attention of men who tabloid
newspapers can conveniently label as social or sexual misfits. </p>
<p>But stalking is not confined to famous, glamorous women. Some
5% of US women - a staggering 6.5m women - are stalked at some
point in their life. In many cases, the 'stalker' is a former
husband or boyfriend who believes that all he has to do is pursue
her a little harder, a little further, and she will give in to
him. But many other victims may never have had or even considered
a relationship with their pursuer. In fact, they may not even
know them.</p>
<p><b>Violence in the workplace</b> </p>
<p>Stalking is also behind the rise in incidents of violence in
the workplace. In the US, some 6,000 people suffer work-related
fatalities each year. Around 20% of these fatalities are the
result of homicides in the workplace. Some crime experts believe
that workplace murder is the fastest growing kind of homicide:
according to the US Department of Justice, one in six violent
crimes occurs in the workplace. </p>
<p>This should not, perhaps be surprising. A victim can move
house or change telephone number, but she (the vast majority of
victims are female) cannot simply change her place of employment.
That is the one place where a stalker knows he can find his
intended victim. So how can you stop the determined stalker? How
can you even tell when they are going to strike? </p>
<p>A stalker does not just &quot;snap&quot; one day and assault
his victim or those around her. There are almost always warning
signs for those who choose to look. Stalkers may make repeated
contact with their victims through any number of means: letters,
fan mail, telephone calls, E-mail messages, acts of vandalism or
unanticipated gifts. How dangerous such communications are can
partly depend on how threatening they are, though any behaviour
which verges on the obsessive should be considered a clear
threat. The most dangerous type of stalker is usually the person
who believes he has been rejected by his victim. He now seeks to
correct, reverse or &quot;revenge&quot; the rejection he feels. </p>
<h3>Intervention techniques </h3>
<p>Intervention techniques are manifold, and run from the <i>laissez-faire</i>
&quot;do nothing and he'll eventually go away&quot; to
recommending law enforcement intervention and criminal
prosecution - though even a temporary restraining order is only a
piece of paper, not a shield. It cannot protect every stalking
victim and should not necessarily be viewed as the generic
solution to difficult situations - indeed, it may aggravate
certain types of stalker. In any event, you may wish to
supplement your chosen course by retaining written messages,
making tape recordings of inappropriate telephone calls,
photographing the resulting acts of vandalism and so on. </p>
<p>Whichever course you choose should be tailor-made to suit the
victim and her employer. Personal security is just that -
personal to meet the assessed level of the threat. A private,
&quot;outside the employment arena&quot; stalking matter can
quickly escalate into a &quot;violence in the workplace&quot;
situation with potentially life-threatening consequences. If a
stalker gains access to the workplace with the intention of
resolving his relationship with his intended victim once and for
all, he may turn violent against the first person he encounters -
whether he knows them or not. </p>
<p>A corporate goal of zero tolerance, together with timely
professional council, will allow you to identify and deal with
any potentially violent situation before it becomes a full-blown
crisis. These practical steps will also allow both the victim and
the corporation to meet their personal and corporate
responsibilities.</p>
<h3>False allegations </h3>
<p>Regrettably, not all allegations of stalking are true. An
individual may invent a stalker or falsely accuse someone of
stalking for many reasons: a need for attention, an attempt to
re-establish a former relationship, or even a desire to punish a
colleague or supervisor. These are delicate matters, and great
sensitivity is needed if they are to be resolved without harming
the 'victim', her employer or her alleged assailant. Achieving
this, and successfully coping with something which is entirely in
the imagination of the 'victim', can be as hard as suppressing
the most real of threats from the most dangerous of stalkers.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Control Risks Group is experienced in helping clients assess
danger in such situations and in the development of corporate
crisis management plans. These provide a tested framework and
recourse for meeting such individual and corporate challenges.</p>

<h2><a name="No Hiding Place">No Hiding Place</a></h2>
<p><b>By Richard Fenning<br>
Business Development Manager</b></p>
<p>Environmentalist pressure will be one of the key risks for
business operating in emerging markets over the next five years.
The IRB research commissioned by Control Risks in November 1995
(see page 1) shows that 26% of British companies and 47% of US
firms believe that environmental activism will rise in the near
future. Recent events, such as the campaign against Shell in
Nigeria, have been just a taster of what is to come. This is not
a fad. Environmentalism is not going to go away. It is something
businesses have got to take seriously. </p>
<p>Control Risks has been commissioned by the Royal Institute of
International Affairs (Chatham House) to write a report on the
changing relationship between business and the environmental
'movement' in its broadest sense. The report, entitled <i>No
Hiding Place</i>, will provide a practical and comprehensive
guide to the political and moral minefield through which
companies must now pick their way. </p>
<p><i>No Hiding Place</i> argues that the rise of global
environmental activism in the past five years has left
international business with nowhere to hide. Companies are
increasingly perceived as accountable to a constituency far wider
than merely their shareholders, and can no longer rely solely on
regulatory and scientific approval. Instead, they must win public
acceptance of their &quot;licence to operate&quot;. </p>
<p>Those who do not gain such acceptance risk condemnation on a
worldwide scale. For the impact of environmental degradation is a
global issue. Advances in technology have allowed Western
pressure groups to co-ordinate their activities with counterparts
in developing countries, where they are increasingly managing to
fuse the issues of local economic advancement and environmental
activism. Business therefore faces demands which go beyond
legislation and beyond frontiers. </p>
<p>Organisations which fail to satisfy such demands risk severely
damaging their profits and their reputation. Domestic political
pressure recently prompted the US Overseas Private Investment
Corporation (OPIC) to cancel $100m worth of political risk
insurance on a massive copper-gold mining project operated by
Freeport McMoran in Indonesia. OPIC withdrew the cover on the
grounds that the mine posed &quot;an unreasonable or major
environmental health or safety hazard&quot; - although Freeport
McMoran had apparently received &quot;all necessary environmental
approvals from the government of Indonesia&quot;<i>.</i> </p>
<p><i>No Hiding Place</i> argues that companies cannot succeed
without understanding the<b> </b>changing landscape of society.
Electorates and consumers are becoming less trusting of those in
authority, and public activism is increasing in line with the
growing unpopularity of government and &quot;big&quot; business. </p>
<p>The public, administrations and corporations find themselves
locked together in an uneasy triangle as the parameters of
&quot;acceptable&quot; protest become increasingly wide. Public
activism can prompt consumer boycotts and falling share prices,
undoing decades of hard work. It can also shape government
actions and policies, which in turn can rebound on business:
Shell reckons to have lost around &#163;100m through the boycotts
which followed the Dutch and German governments' decision to
withdraw support for the deep-sea disposal of Brent Spar. </p>
<p>Add an increasingly militant public to a world being made
rapidly smaller by advances in technology, and the threats to big
business are plain to see. Satellite communications bring simple
media images to huge audiences with maximum impact, and worldwide
computer networks allow pressure groups to co-ordinate activities
and spread information globally. Such groups combine central and
regional expertise to switch local issues on to the international
stage (for example, BHP is being sued in Melbourne for alleged
environmental damage in Papua New Guinea). In contrast, some
large and cumbersome multinationals end up resembling oil
supertankers: once corporate courses are set, it is difficult to
stop them or turn them around. </p>
<p>But business should not regard the new environmentalism as a
negative force. For the green revival has given industry the spur
to innovate. Corporations can gain a significant advantage over
their competitors if they conduct themselves in an
environmentally-friendly fashion, or at least mitigate any
environmental damage which their activities cause. However, many
companies will only be persuaded to seek 'green' solutions if
they are at least as profitable as other courses. Building
environmental considerations into decision-making structures is
therefore not simply a case either of conscience-salving or of
enlightened pragmatism. It can be a commercial imperative which
business ignores at its peril.</p>

<h2><a name="Opportunities knocked">Opportunities knocked</a></h2>
<p><i>Business' perception that Africa is a place of high risk
and low opportunity is all wrong. Respondents to the IRB survey
believe that Africa offers fewer prospects and more threats than
any other emerging markets. </i><b><i>Tara O'Connor</i></b><i>
and </i><b><i>Roger Dunn</i></b><i>, Control Risks' Africa
analysts, explain why Africa has been largely undersold.</i></p>
<p>On a scale of one to ten, British firms rate opportunities in
Africa at just over three and dangers at more than six. Only
South Africa bucks the trend. </p>
<p>These figures reflect a widespread belief that problems in
Africa apply across the continent, rather than being confined to
specific countries. Many people only hear about wars in Rwanda,
violence in Sierra Leone and crime in Nigeria. They then think
that all African countries are like that. </p>
<p>But that's simply not true. Africa is a place of amazing
diversity. Algeria, which has one of the most hazardous operating
environments in the world, is right next to Tunisia, which has
very few security problems. Similarly, Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire
- one virtually a no-go area, the other an increasingly popular
location for foreign investment - border each other in West
Africa. Companies shouldn't write the entire continent off just
because a few countries' problems make the news. </p>
<p>British businesses which ignore the opportunities in Africa
risk losing out to Asian and US business, both of which are
aggressively targeting African markets. Many corporate
strategists have been surprised to find how eager governments are
to attract foreign investment. The outlook is particularly
promising for mining companies, </p>
<p>which are spending some $200m annually just on exploration.
Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Niger and Tanzania have all
recently revised and liberalised their mining investment
regulations, and telecommunications companies are also eyeing a
potentially lucrative market. </p>
<p>Of course, business still faces substantial risks in Africa.
Investors may suffer problems such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>corruption (which can increase a project's development
        costs by some 7%), </li>
    <li>bureaucracy (excessive official interference can
        seriously hinder imports and exports) </li>
    <li>legal difficulties (legislative reforms may be incomplete
        or arbitrary) </li>
    <li>and labour problems (unions can call strikes to vent
        grievances often unrelated to work conditions or
        corporate policy) </li>
</ul>
<p>But such problems are often no worse than in other emerging
markets, particularly those in Asia and the former Soviet Union.
Africa's problem is as much one of image as anything else, and
this image is increasingly misleading. Tinpot dictators
unaccountable to anyone but their Swiss bank managers are on
their way out.</p>
<h3>Fortune favours the brave in Angola</h3>
<p>Foreign companies prepared to brave Angola's uncertain
immediate future may find their commitment handsomely rewarded by
the turn of the century. The operating climate for foreign firms
is better than in many other African countries: the manager of a
major Western firm in Luanda said that &quot;a contract in Angola
is honoured in the same way as in the West.&quot; </p>
<p>It is therefore little surprise that foreign oil firms are
keen to exploit Angola's vast resources - Agip, BP, Elf, Texaco
and Total have all expressed interest. Oil is the most important
source of export earnings and government income for the Angolans.
Most of the oil sector is located offshore, which helped it to
largely escape the ravages of war, and government troops continue
to ensure the security of operations in the oil-rich Cabinda
enclave. </p>
<p>Of course, there are opportunities in other industries. Much
of Angola's infrastructure will have to be completely rebuilt:
with the exception of Luanda, Benguela and Lobito, all cities
have been badly damaged, and big transport and telecommunications
projects will also be needed. Diamond companies have been the
main beneficiaries of the abolition of the state's monopoly over
mineral rights. </p>
<p>But the road to recovery will be rocky. It is only two years
since the UN described the Angolan conflict as the 'world's worst
war', and the fallout will continue for some time. Some 120,000
troops from both sides have been or are being demobilised, and
many will turn to crime if a major rehabilitation programme is
not introduced. Rising crime - exacerbated by the easy
availability of weapons - already poses a major security threat
in the capital Luanda. Moreover, sporadic outbreaks of fighting
between government and rebel units will probably continue until
all units have been successfully assembled in cantonment areas. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, such problems are surmountable. It is easy to be
cynical about Angola's political future given its recent history,
but the picture now is very different to that of 1992 when the
transition to democracy broke down. External forces will no
longer control Angola's future - the Cold War and apartheid are
both over. All parties involved want peace, and the need to get
it right will provide the impetus for reconciliation.</p>

<h2><a name="Covering the damage">Covering the damage</a></h2>
<p><b>By William Mountain<br>
Insurance Liaison Manager</b></p>
<p>'The &#163;200m bomb'. It was February 10, the day after the
IRA had bombed Canary Wharf, and the media had picked out the
bomb's most shocking statistic. Not the number of human
casualties, but the amount of physical damage caused. &#163;200m.
A figure to make any insurance underwriter's heart sink. </p>
<p>Terrorist 'spectaculars' such as Canary Wharf and Oklahoma
tend to grab the headlines, but in reality even a small bomb can
cause havoc - not only by damaging buildings and equipment, but
also by disrupting business processes and deterring prospective
investors. Many terrorist attacks worldwide are specifically
aimed at business premises: the two City of London bombs in 1992
and 1993, for example, or the 1993 attack on the World Trade
Center in New York. </p>
<p>It is against this background that Control Risks has teamed up
with the Hiscox Group to provide a terrorist damage policy. The
policy goes beyond those offered by competitors in several ways.
It can be structured to cover any malicious damage, regardless of
motivation - so damage caused by rioting, attacks by strikers,
confiscation by governments and personal accident all fall within
the policy's remit. Following such events, your policy can
provide up to $20m for categories such as loss of earnings
through business interruption and repair to damaged property. </p>
<p>Moreover, the Hiscox policy (unlike that of the UK-government
backed Pool Re) can pay out for damage caused by an unclaimed
attack. And Hiscox will contribute up to 10% of a client's
premium to fund preventative work carried out by Control Risks. </p>
<p>We offer three main preventative services to subscribers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>threat assessments. These can be either general to the
        country or region, or specific to the actual or intended
        site of operations. In both cases, our team of in-house
        analysts will examine the dangers posed by terrorist
        groups and also by factors such as racial or ethnic
        tensions, political instability and crime. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>security surveys. Control Risks will provide a consultant
        to visit your site and advise on how the threat from
        terrorism can be countered. The consultant will undertake
        a detailed analysis of the terrorist threat, assess the
        risk this poses to the operation, and make
        recommendations on how security could be enhanced in
        order to reduce risks to manageable levels. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>contingency planning. We will draw up and help implement
        emergency management plans designed either to ensure that
        business continues or, in extremis, to facilitate
        emergency evacuation in the event of terrorist attack.
        Regular simulation exercises give management teams the
        confidence and methodology to tackle real crises. </li>
</ul>
<p>Terrorist attacks can happen anywhere at any time, and the
less expected they are, the more shocking they are: the bomb
against the National Guard in Riyadh last November is a good
example. Many businesses in London were lulled into complacency
during the IRA ceasefire. They have now been jolted out of such
complacency in the rudest possible way. Of course, the IRA is not
the only potential terrorist threat in the UK: animal rights
activists consistently target businesses perceived to be involved
with animal abuse, and the power of Middle Eastern terrorists was
dramatically shown in the bombing of the Israeli embassy in
London 18 months ago. </p>
<p>Of course, the terrorist damage policy is not confined to the
UK. Less developed countries offer many of the world's best
commercial opportunities, yet it is also these regions which can
pose the greatest dangers to business. The combination of western
technology and capital can be too precious for these countries to
lose - which is why local opposition groups target foreign
investors in a bid to undermine the regime.</p>

<h2><a name="Country survey: Brazil">Country survey: Brazil</a></h2>
<p><i>Western companies are increasingly investing in Brazil's
expanding economy - a vote of confidence in President Fernando
Cardoso's programme of reforms. But how likely is it that this
favourable operating environment will continue? Control Risks'
Brazil analyst </i><b><i>Bryan White</i></b><i> reports.</i></p>
<p>The environment for foreign business in Brazil is challenging,
but can be profitable. Inflation is running at around 2-3% per
month - a massive improvement on 1994, when the annual figure was
1,250%. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is now seeking
congressional approval for major economic reforms and is also
promoting social reform - not least because this would go some
way towards combating high crime rates, which pose an immediate
threat to business.</p>
<h3>Opportunities </h3>
<p>Brazil offers plenty for the investor. The government is keen
to attract outside business, the internal market is vast, and
Brazil is a member of Mercosur (the trade organisation which also
includes Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay). Structurally, Brazil's
economy is relatively strong, with a buy-back plan to reduce its
$130bn foreign debt already in operation. Planning Minister Jose
Serra expects Brazil's extensive privatisation programme to yield
some $21bn by 1999. This money will help finance a highly
ambitious social and infrastructure expenditure plan which is
intended to promote growth and consolidate the anti-inflation
programme. </p>
<p>Such opportunities have attracted foreign investors by the
truckload: between them, 69 of the largest international
companies intend to commit $27bn by the year 2000. Pilkington, TI
and Willett have recently set up operations, Rover has just
established a diesel engine joint venture, and many other
companies (including Coca-Cola, General Motors and Toyota) are
either entering Brazil or increasing their investments there.</p>
<h3>Risks </h3>
<p>Although the government argues that the Brazilian economy is
not vulnerable to the type of pressure which caused Mexico to
devalue in late 1994, the future remains far from clear.
Businessmen and trade unionists alike are concerned that the
emphasis on controlling inflation will lead to recession. In
contrast, government economic advisers fear that an explosion in
consumer demand will bring back high rates of inflation. </p>
<p>President Cardoso may also find himself having to compromise
on certain economic priorities. He needs the support of 60% of
congress in order to push through the constitutional reforms
essential to his programme, but he is hampered by the quicksand
of shifting allegiances within and between the parties: vested
interests oppose any reforms which reduce their traditional
powers and perks. Cardoso has so far been able to achieve most of
his objectives by bargaining item by item, but he may find this
increasingly difficult. He also needs the continuing goodwill of
the business sector to keep his economic policies on course. </p>
<p>Crime is also a major problem. The wide and visible gulf
between rich and poor means that Brazilian crime levels are very
high, with kidnapping common (particularly in Rio). Most kidnap
victims are wealthy local businessmen, but Rio's kidnap gangs
have broadened their targets to include members of the
professional classes whose security is generally laxer.
Expatriates have also been targeted. </p>
<p>Organised criminal gangs can also pose problems for foreign
business. They often steal valuable goods to order, and are
prepared to use violence if they meet resistance. Companies
should keep security procedures under constant review. </p>
<p>You should consider locating in Sao Paulo instead of Rio. Not
only are crime levels lower in Sao Paulo, but most of the
business community is located there - thus mitigating the
difficulties caused by Brazil's dubious transport infrastructure.
Alternatively, some foreign companies are opting to locate in
smaller towns (i.e. those with populations of less than 1m) which
have good communications, power supplies and labour resources. </p>
<p>Foreign business should also be prepared for corruption. A
recent survey by the anti-corruption group Transparency
International ranked Brazil as the fifth most corrupt country in
the world: only Indonesia, China, Pakistan and Venezuela scored
higher. An official report published in December 1994 claimed
that officials, contractors and suppliers stole some $20bn,
mainly by deliberately over-pricing public contracts and
pocketing the difference. The report did not state the length of
period over which the money had been stolen, but the scale of the
theft has led to calls for its prevention - or at least for its
containment. In September 1995, a senate committee approved
proposals to abolish bank account secrecy for politicians and
state-owned enterprise officials. However, an end to corruption
is not likely in the immediate future. </p>
<p>Brazil is a massive market, and it has massive potential.
There are risks, but they are by no means unmanageable. Although
returns are slow, the sensible investor should ultimately
prosper.</p>

<h2><a name="RUSSIAN ROULETTE ">RUSSIAN ROULETTE </a></h2>
<p><i>June's presidential elections will be the most important political event in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet 
Union. Despite all the media hype, however, few - if any - commentators have really established what 
repercussions the polls will have on foreign business. Control Risks' Russia analyst </i><b><i>Guy Dunn</i></b><i> examines what 
effect a victory for each of the three main candidates would have on the operating environment for foreign 
companies.</i> </p>
<p>The majority of foreign companies are delaying investment until after the elections. They are worried by the prospect of 
a communist or nationalist president, and equally hopeful that a moderate or reformist president will tackle many of the 
obstacles currently facing foreign investment. These obstacles include political uncertainty, hostility towards foreign 
investment, state interference, tax problems, legal shortcomings, excess bureaucracy, rampant corruption and rising 
crime. </p>
<p>Because the president is so powerful (see attached box), his policies could have a major effect on the climate for foreign 
business. The following table divides the operating climate into five major sections - political instability, attitudes towards 
foreign investment, economic reforms, tax and legal structures, and corruption and crime - and gives each main 
candidate a mark out of 10<i> </i>in terms of how favourable his policies would be towards foreign investors. The total mark 
is then doubled to make a percentage and represented as a 'favourability factor', where zero would represent a 
complete ban on foreign investment and 100 would indicate a perfect operating climate. </p>
<p>A much fuller assessment of the elections can be found in <i>Russia 1996: the make or break year?</i>, a two-part report 
published by Control Risks at &#163;250. The first part is now available. The second part (which will be published in 
September) will expand on these themes in the light of the election results, examining how the business environment 
might develop under the new President and assessing the main implications for foreign companies. For further

<table border=1 bordercolor="#000000">
<tr><td width=602><b>Presidential powers</b> <p><i>Under the constitution, the Russian president has powers similar to those of a French 
president combined with the authority of a US president. The president is elected for a 
maximum of two four-year terms, appoints the prime minister and must approve all the 
ministerial appointments. He also appoints the chairman of the Central Bank, military 
leaders and diplomats. The president sets domestic and foreign policy guidelines and can 
reject any legislation passed by the State Duma (lower parliamentary house). He can 
dissolve the Duma by forcing a vote of confidence in the government, though if he does not 
achieve this he has the right to dissolve the Duma within seven days. The president can also 
declare a state of emergency.</i> </p>

<h2><a name="Hostages to misfortune">Hostages to misfortune</a></h2>
<p><b>By Madeleine McCormick</b> </p>
<table border=1 width=80%>
<tr><td width=80%>Worldwide in 1995, 138 foreign nationals were kidnapped. Of these, 30 were aid workers or 
missionaries, 29 were tourists, and 25 were engineers or technicians. </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The wave of media alarmism which followed the kidnap of Greek businessman George Fraghistas in London last month 
should not obscure the fact that, in some countries, kidnapping remains a way of life. Latin America continues to 
account for the vast majority of kidnaps recorded by Control Risks. In 1995, more than 80% of kidnaps occurred in 
Latin America, and 75% of these took place in one country - <b>Colombia</b>. </p>
<p>As ever, figures vary widely according to the source: the 464 Colombian kidnaps we recorded is less than half the 
1,060 issued by the Pais Libre organisation. Although the Pais Libre figures represent a 23% drop from 1994, the 
authorities still consider the problem to be a serious one: last September, Dr Alberto Villamizar was appointed 
'anti-kidnap tsar' with responsibility to co-ordinate the fight against kidnapping. </p>
<p>Similar measures have been taken in <b>Brazil</b>, though lack of resources will severely hamper the anti-kidnap police's 
efforts. The problem is particularly acute in Rio, where pre-kidnap extortion threats are also increasingly common. Nor 
are the authorities having mucb success in <b>Guatemala</b>, whose president has stated his willingness to mobilise the army 
in the streets of Guatemala City to combat the problem. </p>
<p>In a more positive development, the Guatemalan human rights organisation CONADEHUA has for the first time 
publicised the plight of a kidnap victim over the Internet. The victim, eight-year-old Maurel Noel Interiano, was released 
safely late last year after 40 days in captivity. However, a disturbing new trend in Guatemala is towards <i>rapisecuestros</i>, 
where children are snatched (sometimes off school buses) and ransomed for up to Q2000 (just over &#163;200). </p>
<p>A similar pattern can be seen in <b>Peru</b>, where the <i>secuestro al paso</i> is becoming commonplace. Here, gangs of around 
10 kidnappers (some of whom are thought to be corrupt ex-security force personnel) abduct their victims and force 
them to hand over as much money as they have available. Around 50 such kidnaps were reported in the second half of 
1995 alone. </p>
<p>In <b>Mexico</b>, kidnappers continue to use the media as a means of communication in kidnap negotiation. In January, the 
kidnappers of publisher Jose Antonio Perez Porrua demanded that a member of the victim's family, a negotiator and a 
priest appear on the '24 Horas' news programme and agree to pay the final ransom (85% of the original demand). 
Porrua was released after the family paid as requested. Similar tactics were employed by the kidnappers of Banamex 
president Alfredo Harp Helu (kidnapped in 1994) and businessman Joaquin Vargas (1992). </p>
<p>Early indications in 1996 are that trends continue largely as usual. By April, Control Risks had recorded 218 kidnaps 
worldwide - all but 16 of them in Latin America. It seems that the authorities are yet again facing a mammoth task in 
their quest to dent Latin America's image as the kidnap capital of the world.</p>

<h2><a name="The man who terrorised a nation">The man who terrorised a nation</a></h2>
<p><i>The Unabomber terrorised America for almost 20 years. Last year, two newspapers took the controversial 
decision to publish a 35,000 word manifesto purportedly written by the Unabomber. A few weeks later, former 
FBI Chief Negotiator </i><b><i>Clint van Zandt</i></b><i> was called in to follow up a possible lead on the case. This is his story.</i> </p>
<p>When I retired from the FBI's renowned Behavioral Science Unit last year, I thought my public career had ended. How 
wrong I was. Last December, I was contacted by a private investigator from Chicago who wanted to know if I could 
compare two letters with a public document. </p>
<p>The two letters were typed copies, unsigned and undated. The public document was anything but unknown. It turned 
out to be one of the most notorious of recent publications - the 35,000-word rambling 'manifesto' against modern 
technology which was purportedly written by the Unabomber and which the <i>Washington Post</i> and<i> New York Times</i> 
had published. </p>
<p>I was asked to prove if the letter writer was the same person who had written the manifesto, though of course it was 
(and still is) not certain that the author of the manifesto is the Unabomber himself. As with other such cases, my 
analytical team comprised a psychiatrist and a Ph.D. linguist. Between the three of us, we examined aspects such as the 
closeness of phrasing between the letters and the manifesto, the unusual similarity in the non-construction types of 
phrasing, and the unique stylistic context of both. </p>
<p>We found enough points of comparison to suggest that the manifesto and the letters were probably written by the same 
person. I provided a full report to the Chicago investigator outlining our conclusion and the reasons behind it. Just as 
importantly, I attached a message: 'get your client and this information to the FBI as soon as possible'. The Unabomber 
was a serial killer. He had sent mail bombs for almost 20 years without being caught, and he had threatened to blow an 
airliner full of passengers out of the sky. He was a man who could strike again at any moment. We had to make every 
effort to catch him as soon as possible. </p>
<p>But equally, we could not take any chances. What if we were wrong, and the letter-writer was <b>not</b> the author of the 
Unabomber manifesto? So I assembled a second team of analysts, both of them Ph.D academics and widely 
experienced in communication analysis. They conducted a completely independent review of the letters and the 
manifesto, and came to a similar conclusion: the documents were probably written by the same person. They too 
insisted that the information be given to the FBI as a matter of urgency. </p>
<p>At this stage I still did not know who the supposed author was. I provided a profile suggesting that the writer was: </p>
<ul>
<li>a male aged between 45 and 55, </li>
<li>an academic achiever, probably with a Ph.D </li>
<li>a loner who might think about people rather than interact with them </li>
<li>a man who disliked technology and probably lived alone in a rural area </li>
<li>a person who held his own personal view of right and wrong, totally uninfluenced by society. </li>
</ul>
<p>As we know now, the man who provided the letters for analysis was David Kaczynski, whose brother Theodore (Ted) 
dropped out of society soon after receiving a Ph.D from Harvard in order to live a hermit's existence in rural Montana. 
David had seen the Unabomber's manifesto and feared that his brother had written it - fears which my analysis only 
served to confirm. </p>
<p>Armed with David's information and my work, the FBI conducted a highly secret three-month investigation of Ted 
Kaczynski, which culminated in his arrest last month. FBI agents who searched his small log cabin found various 
bomb-making tools and materials, notes on bomb making, a possible list of the Unabomber's former and potential 
victims, and a completed, packaged bomb which was ready to mail. </p>
<p>It is now up to the authorities to prepare the criminal case against Ted Kaczynski, and for the courts to decide his guilt 
or innocence. If he is the Unabomber, then the longest, widest and most expensive criminal investigation in the history of 
law enforcement may finally be closing, and the relatives of the three innocent people killed and the 22 injured by the 
Unabomber may finally have some peace. </p>
<p>If Theodore Kaczynski is the Unabomber, then it will be indeed ironic that his own words helped us to capture him, We 
at CRG applaud the many hundreds of law enforcement officers who have worked so hard these past 18 years to 
identify the Unabomber, this invisible man who terrorised a nation and who made so many of us think twice before 
opening a strange package. </p>

to take a hardline stance 
against crime and

<h2><a name="When the going gets tough">When the going gets tough</a>....</h2>
<p><b>By Tom Jackson</b> </p>
<p>&quot;Foreign nationals who do not leave Algeria by Saturday will be killed.&quot; <i>Letter from the Armed Islamic Group, 
January 1995</i> </p>
<p>&quot;The US is evacuating its embassy in Sudan because of the terrorist threat. Washington is also urging 2,100 American 
citizens to leave.&quot; <i>Daily Telegraph, February 1996.</i> </p>
<p>Direct threats against foreigners are a fact of life in some parts of the world. In poorer countries, the combination of 
Western technology and substantial capital is too precious to lose - which is precisely why local opposition groups so 
often target foreign investors in a bid to undermine the regime. </p>
<p>It is no use simply reacting to such threats on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis once they have been made. The safety of your employees 
and their dependants is too important to be left unconsidered until anarchy reigns or there is a serious breakdown in law 
and order. You should draw up a detailed business continuity plan which aims to maintain operations without posing 
unacceptable danger to staff. </p>
<p>The use of the phrase 'business continuity' is crucial. In many cases, your interests will not necessarily be best served by 
mass evacuation. If you do need to remove people, you may be able to continue longer by gradually reducing the 
number of foreign personnel - it is easier to evacuate two people rather than 200 - and handing over to local 
management for the duration of the crisis. </p>
<p>Nor should you rely solely on diplomatic advice and evacuation plans. This is not because such advice is inadequate or 
erroneous, but because diplomats and senior executives may well use different criteria when assessing whether to 
evacuate or not. Unlike embassies, foreign companies may have projects in remote areas and may employ people of 
many different nationalities, posing an entirely different set of logistical and ethical problems. </p>
<p>Personnel are the first priority, but other aspects are also important. How should you go about protecting sensitive 
commercial information, critical data, financial assets, valuable equipment, property and personal possessions? Can 
these be taken out of country? If not, can they be stored safely, or will they have to be abandoned and lost? </p>
<p>Of course, political instability or terrorist violence are not the only reasons for swift evacuation. Employees may also be 
in danger from natural disasters (such as the Kobe earthquake), nuclear leaks (Chernobyl), raging forest fires (Australia, 
California), epidemics (Zaire, India), famine (Africa) and so on. Such events are likely to seriously disrupt the transport 
infrastructure and the supply of essential services. </p>
<p>Plans cannot provide the answers to every eventuality, but they do provide a co-ordinated framework within which you 
can operate. The importance of a coherent plan is evident from the following examples. In the first case (Moscow), the 
company's plan helped maintain calm and a sense of perspective. In the other example (Yemen), the lack of any 
structured plan caused many problems which could easily have been avoided.</p>
<p><b>Moscow.</b> In October 1993, Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi and parliamentary chairman Raslan Khasbulatov 
attempted to overthrow President Boris Yeltsin. Fighting centred around the White House (parliament) building, and 
more than 150 people were killed. A Western financial services company based in Moscow had several months earlier 
commissioned Control Risks to write a clear local evacuation plan, which outlined actions to be taken at any of four 
states of alert, detailed possible evacuation routes, and allocated individual responsibilities in times of crisis. 
Responsibility was shared between the firm's Moscow office and head office in London, though the Moscow staff had 
the authority to make and implement unilateral decisions if necessary. Widespread uncertainty and media hyperbole 
made local conditions hard to assess accurately. By following the evacuation plan and its guidelines, however, staff were 
able to make a reasoned decision to halt visits from outside but not to evacuate themselves. Business continued largely 
as usual and the violence was over in a matter of days - vindicating the firm's decision and proving the plan's 
effectiveness. </p>
<p><b>Yemen. </b>In May 1994, North and South Yemen (which had only merged four years previously) went to war with each 
other. Airports and airspace were closed, national and international telephone networks were cut, and looters took to 
the streets. In the capital Sanaa, supporters fought running battles and missiles hit residential and business districts alike. 
Although foreigners were not being directly targeted, they were in obvious danger of being caught up in attacks. Unlike 
people in the Southern capital Aden (who were evacuated to Djibouti) and in the Masila oilfield (who were taken to 
Oman via the port of Mukalla), those foreigners in land-locked Sanaa had no easy way out. They had to wait for 
diplomatically-organised flights, which took several days to organise - days during which they lived in constant fear of 
their lives.</p>
<p>One of those people evacuated from Sana'a made the following criticisms - <b>all</b> of which could have been negated by a 
good crisis plan put in place long before it was needed: </p>
<ul>
<li>the only international communications from Sanaa were through the radio network to the oilfield, which had 
satellite communications </li>
<li>contact with the embassy and other foreigners was maintained by bicycle </li>
<li>the BBC World Service proved the main source of information </li>
<li>Once initiated, the evacuation process proved long and tiring - especially for those with small children. Proof of 
nationality was vital, and many people were unaware that the amount of luggage they could take was restricted. 
They arrived at the assembly point with all their personal possessions, most of which had to be abandoned there. </li>
<li>It is important to have a good supply of cash to help 'smooth over' last-minute local bureaucracy. </li>
<li>When the evacuees arrived back in the UK, the company did not have any reception plans to help them after 
their tiring and traumatic experience. </li>
<li>The evacuees' relatives in the UK found it very difficult to get reassurance about their safety. </li>

<h2><a name="A rocky road to reconstruction">A rocky road to reconstruction</a></h2>
<p><i>Before joining Control Risks as a crisis response consultant, </i><b><i>Matthew Burnford</i></b><i> worked in Bosnia-Hercegovina 
for the EC Monitor Mission and for the International Conference on the region. Earlier this year, he returned to 
the country to assess the opportunities and risks for foreign business in the aftermath of the Dayton Accord 
signed last December. Here is what he found.</i></p>
<p>Few international issues have been as widely covered and as imperfectly understood as the conflict in 
Bosnia-Hercegivina (BiH). For all the acres of newsprint and hours of airtime devoted to the fighting, very few people - 
be they politicians, soldiers or business executives - really know what is going on. From a commercial point of view, the 
danger is that this ignorance will lead to companies missing out on the vast spectrum of opportunities in the country. </p>
<p>BiH needs massive reconstruction. There has been extensive damage to water supply, power generation, roads and 
central telecommunications facilities. A few statistics serve to illustrate the shocking effect which the conflict has had. 
BiH's industrial output in 1994 was just 5% of its 1990 output. Almost 80% of electrical generating capacity has been 
damaged or is out of operation. The reconstruction effort has also been complicated by the human cost of the conflict - 
almost 500,000 people have been killed or wounded since 1991, a figure compounded by mass migration and 
mobilisation into the military. </p>
<p>For foreign companies, opportunities exist in virtually every sector of the economy. In the medium-term, large contracts 
will probably be put out to tender in areas such as energy, health, housing, heavy industry, telecommunications, 
transportation and water supply. The international community has pledged more than $2bn this year alone for the 
reconstruction effort. </p>
<p>However, many foreign companies are still reluctant to invest capital in a country whose political future remains so 
uncertain. Balkan history demonstrates only too well that the region is unstable and fickle and that its people are 
passionate and determined. Companies prepared to invest time and staff in the region should not take continued peace 
for granted - particularly if elections scheduled for September do not return some sort of legitimate government. </p>
<p>One of the major features of the conflict has been the rapidity with which situations escalate - an area which may be 
peaceful and trouble-free one day may see heavy fighting the next. You cannot assume that impending hostilities will be 
signposted and will build gradually. This unnerving speed can cause fear and panic, which can be diffused by having 
competent local drivers and interpreters. </p>
<p>Most of the recent fighting has been concentrated in BiH, and it is here that personnel are at highest risk - Control Risks 
still ranks BiH at Risk Level Four (Danger), in comparison to Risk Level Two (Vigilant) in Zagreb (Croatia) and 
Belgrade (Serbia). The Dayton accord has by no means ended all fighting: since the accord was signed, around 40 
foreign soldiers and aid workers have been injured by mines or sniper fire. Being plunged into a former war zone - even 
one temporarily at peace - can be a frightening experience for those who are used to working in a secure civilian 
environment. </p>
<p>All staff working in BiH should therefore undergo training before they go. Evacuation plans should be drawn up, and 
emergency communications systems should be established - particularly for teams operating in remote regions. In order 
to ensure that the right people receive the right instructions, training can be layered: all personnel receive basic training, 
with field operators, team leaders, managers and planners undertaking further courses on crisis planning, mine 
awareness, driver training, and so on. </p>
<p>One of the biggest dangers for new arrivals in BiH is the attitude held by many on the ground that such figures - which 
do represent an easing of the situation - mean that the area is now safe. It is not. It may be better than before, but 
personnel who accept casual assumptions about safety do so at their peril. When I was in BiH earlier this year, a senior 
NGO official told me that the chances of a grave security incident taking place were almost non-existent. Despite his 
assurances, I found myself twice within walking distance of such an incident (a serious abduction and robbery in 
Sarajevo on the day I arrived, and a bomb blast in Mostar on the day I left). </p>
<p>Almost all international organisations have suffered theft of vehicles or equipment. It is such an accepted part of 
operating in BiH that no insurance company will cover drivers for any more than third party damage. When vehicles 
worth tens of thousands of pounds are liable to be stolen at some stage, this is a serious financial consideration. </p>
<p>There is little formal accommodation in Sarajevo or Mostar, and a good part of this is private accommodation. 
International personnel working in these towns often live in private houses, which are generally secure. Hotel security 
standards are fairly lax, though again there have been no major security-related incidents. BiH still functions on a cash 
economy, where Deutsche Marks are the most widely-used tender. Credit cards are rarely accepted, and only select 
banks and hotels will change traveller's cheques (sometimes with savage commissions). </p>
<p>Since the telephone system is unreliable, many organisations operating in BiH use VHF radio sets, either for inter-office 
communication and for use between operators working in close proximity on field work. VHF is portable, simple to 
operate, relatively cheap and reliable, though its range is limited. Companies should also seriously consider purchasing 
satellite communication equipment: this is expensive to buy and expensive to run, but it also ensures that emergencies 
can be handled with minimum delay. In BiH, something like this could still literally prove the difference between life and 
death.</p>

<h2><a name="Country survey: India">Country survey: India</a></h2>
<p>By John Bray, Head of Research </p>
<p>The inconclusive results to India's 1996 general elections mean that the country is set for a period of intense political 
jockeying, backstabbing and - almost certainly - fresh elections before the end of 1997. This year's polls are barely 
completed, but the country's politicians are already positioning themselves for the next round. </p>
<p>None of the three main political forces won sufficient seats to form a government on its own in 1996, and it is far from 
certain who will come out ahead in the next 18 months. The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged as 
the largest group in the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) with 194 out of 534 seats declared by 20 May. The 
BJP is India's most coherent political party and it is pro-business: in mid-May Bombay's stock exchange warmed to the 
news that it had been invited to form a government. But the party also has serious disadvantages. The most serious is its 
association with Hindu chauvinists responsible for inciting anti-Muslim riots, notably in late 1992. Its more responsible 
leaders are trying to shake off this reputation, but so far with limited success. Indian politics now revolves around 
alliance-building: the BJP's reputation will make it difficult to find coalition-partners. </p>
<p>The former ruling Congress party's result is the worst in the party's history: despite drawing more votes than the BJP, it 
won only 138 seats. In part this is the result of inept political alliances in the run-up to the polls. However, the deeper 
reasons for Congress's long term decline include the breakdown of internal party democracy, and a pervasive sense of 
corruption. The party's long-term survival in its present form is now in doubt. </p>
<p>The National Front-Left Front (NL-LF) coalition came third with 116 seats. In late May Karnataka Chief Minister HD 
Deve Gowda was preparing to abandon his regional fiefdom to lead a national coalition, supported by Congress. Deve 
Gowda is a pragmatic political manager, and his home state has a good record of attracting foreign investment. But any 
NF-LF administration is bound to be marked by internal quarrelling and party splits. It will not last. </p>
<p><b>achievements.</b> The prospect of protracted political squabbling in New Delhi should not distract investors' attention 
from India's achievements. One of the most important - elections followed by uncontested transfers of power - are now 
taken for granted. Secondly, economic liberalisation - the issue of most concern to foreign investors - no longer counts 
as a major source of controversy, and was scarcely discussed in the campaign. Regional governments ranging from 
Communist West Bengal to the Janata Dal's Karnataka and the BJP-led Gujarat and Maharashtra are actively 
competing for foreign investment. Foreign direct and portfolio investment has risen from a mere $30m in 1990 to some 
$5bn by early 1995. The question is not whether further economic reform will take place, but how fast it will proceed 
and how well it will be managed. </p>
<p><b>investors' concerns</b>. Here there are some grounds for concern. The complex balancing act required of any 
government in New Delhi will make it more difficult to act decisively on controversial issues such as labour law. 
Moreover, insecure governments will be tempted to spend their way to electoral popularity. </p>
<p>The risk of fiscal irresponsibility is greatest at regional level. One of the main lessons of the 1996 elections is the growing 
importance of regional parties. This is one of India's strengths, because it means that growing demands for greater 
regional authority are expressed - and contained - within the country's democratic system. However, it also raises the 
risk that inexperienced or maverick administrations will make foolish economic decisions which deter investors. </p>
<p>Broader 'cultural' issues also continue to impede foreign business. India has many legitimate reasons for national pride 
and - unlike the former Soviet Union - its economy did not collapse before it embarked on its liberalisation programme. 
Attitudes are changing, but many Indians have yet to accept that they need foreign companies, and continue to regard 
them with suspicion if not hostility. </p>
<p>Foreign businessmen frequently bring up the problem of corruption. One senior businessman recently told Control Risks 
that his company had decided not to compete in certain sectors because it believed it was impossible to do so 
effectively without compromising its ethical standards. On the other hand, many Indians suspect that foreign companies 
use their financial muscle to force deals which are not in their country's interest. Foreign companies will be judged by 
higher standards and cannot afford to succumb to the view that corruption is part of the 'Indian way'. </p>
<p>Finally, there is the question of security. Despite the country's poverty, the streets of India's cities are safer than their 
African or Latin American equivalents. But the growing influence of populist leaders dabbling in inflammatory communal 
politics raises the risk of further Hindu/Muslim disturbances, especially in northern India. </p>
<p>None of these concerns should deter investors. With a growing consumer-oriented middle class, India remains one of 
the world's largest unexploited markets. Business may be slow and arduous, but most clients consulting Control Risks 
on India have already decided to back the country. Rather the questions have concerned the outlook in specific states 
and the reputations of individual political leaders and businessmen. As in so many other areas of business, the details will 
be decisive. </p>

<H4>Business Security Outlook is divided into six main parts - one dealing with global issues, and five regional sections examining political and security risks in :</H4>
<H4>
<UL>
<li>Africa</li>
<li>Asia</li>
<li>the Americas</li>
<li>Europe and the former Soviet Union</li>
<li>the Middle East and North Africa.</li>
</UL>
</h4>
<H4>Each regional section begins with a chart assessing political and security risks in major countries. <A HREF = "risklev.html">Risks</A> are rated according to a four-point scale (Insignificant-Low-Medium-High). This year’s report also contains a new feature - notes on the environment for business in each country. These notes not only examine how risks may change in 1996, but also assess wider business issues such as the helpfulness of the bureaucracy, the incidence of corruption, and local attitudes to foreign trade and investment.</H4>
<H4>Business Security Outlook incorporates research on business attitudes carried out by the Industrial Research Bureau (IRB) for Control Risks. IRB surveyed 200 businesses in the UK and US about their perceptions of risks and opportunities in emerging markets. The results -together with Control Risks’ analysis - forms the backbone of Business Security Outlook.</H4>

<h1 align="center">Companies embrace the new capitalists</h1>

<p><font size="2">Companies are riding the wave of capitalism
which is sweeping through emerging economies - despite very real
concerns over their potential partners. A survey published today
by international political and business risk consultancy Control
Risks reveals that:<br>
</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2">76% of companies with international
        operations are currently investing in emerging economies,
        with Asia seen as offering the best rewards</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">The greatest concerns for investors
        operating in such economies are political stability and
        the security situation, both rated at 8 out of 10.
        Environmental issues (5.5) and a democratic framework
        (5.6) present the least serious concerns</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Two-thirds of respondents favour some form
        of local partnership, while only 12% of respondents
        definitely prefer to invest alone. However, such
        partnerships may cause problems: fraudulent activity
        (9.4) and criminal connections (9.0) are the major concerns
        for investors when selecting local business partners</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">The best and worse of emerging economies
        are:</font><p><font size="2"><b>China</b> - currently
        seen as the most attractive of emerging economies, rated
        at 7.2 out of 10 in terms of opportunity and operating environment</font> </p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>India</b> - seen as the most
        promising market for the future: more than 80% of
        respondents forecast increased opportunities over the
        next five years</font> </p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>Nigeria</b> - of the 40 countries
        assessed, Nigeria is seen as the least attractive, not
        only now (it is rated at 3.2), but also in the future (it is
        the only country for which predictions of decreased
        opportunity outweigh predictions of improvement)</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><font size="2">Given the apparent popularity of emerging
        economies, a surprisingly high proportion of respondents
        - almost 25% - had no clear opinion on whether
        opportunities in these countries will increase or
        decrease in the next five years</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2">David Battman, head of research at Control
Risks, says: &quot;The results of this survey clearly reflect the
rise of capitalism in the world's principal emerging markets
following the demise of state-controlled economies and the
adoption of more liberal trade policies. But the survey also
indicates that many companies still face considerable challenges
on at least two fronts: adjusting to often ambiguous business and
political environments, and combatting problems of corruption and
organised criminal activity.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">However, such challenges are far from
insurmountable, says John Conyngham, head of Control Risks'
international investigations division. &quot;Information is the
key. Investors must be able to shine a torch on the often murky
interplay between business, politics and crime. Once they do
this, they can make an informed decision on how best to
proceed.&quot; </font></p>

<h1><a name="a11">Companies embrace the new capitalists</a></h1>

<p><i>Western companies are riding on the wave of new capitalism
which is sweeping through emerging economies. 76% of companies
with international operations are investing in emerging
economies, according to a survey published today by international
business and political risk consultancy Control Risks. Only 12%
of companies are not currently investing and have no immediate
plans to do so.</i></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Control Risks comment</i></b>: &quot;We feel that
    this 12% is missing out. Many developing countries are actively
    seeking foreign investment for the first time, and they are
    crying out for Western technology in fields as diverse as
    mining, telecommunications and sanitation. There is so much
    potential for Western business almost anywhere you look - the
    Pacific Rim, Latin America, China and Africa, which is still erroneously
    regarded by many as a hopeless case.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><img src="IMG00001.gif"
alt="are you currently investing in an emerging economy"
align="middle" border="2" width="522" height="281"> </p>

<hr noshade>

<h2>Concerns </h2>

<p><i>Respondents place political stability and the security
situation at the top of their list of concerns when investing in
emerging economies. Both are rated at eight out of ten, where ten
indicates a very serious concern. At the other end of the scale,
environmental issues (5.5) and a democratic framework (5.6) are
seen as the least of companies' problems.</i> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Control Risks comment</i></b>: &quot;The extent to
    which business and politics overlap means that some degree of
    political stability is crucial. Most people associate
    instability with wars and coups, but there are many other
    more subtle forms of instability which can be equally
    damaging. Uncertainty in government can slow down
    decision-making processes, disrupt policy formulation and
    prompt bureaucratic inertia. Dealing with inadequate
    legislation and officials who are constantly changing can
    seriously jeopardise a project. </p>
    <p>&quot;However, we feel that respondents have overestimated
    the security threat. Media reports often make places seem much
    more dangerous than they actually are. Our experience at
    Control Risks has shown us that physical security, even in
    extremely hostile environments, can be managed. For example,
    many oil and gas companies operate successfully in Algeria,
    despite the often savage Islamic extremist insurgency there. </p>
    <p>&quot;In contrast, respondents have underestimated the
    increasing importance of issues such as the environment,
    labour conditions and human rights. If a company is seen as
    falling down in any of these areas anywhere in the world,
    then the global repercussions - such as consumer boycotts and
    insurance withdrawals - can be vast. Whether or not you have complied
    with local regulatory standards is often irrelevant when
    faced by the shifting sands of international political and
    public pressure.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<hr noshade>

<h2>Partners </h2>

<p><i>Some kind of partnership with local organisations is
preferable, according to the survey: two-thirds of respondents
favour some form of local partnership, while only 12% of
respondents definitely prefer to invest alone. At least 37% of
respondents have experienced some kind of serious problems with a
local business partner</i>. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Control Risks comment</i></b>: &quot;Foreign
    investors are caught in a cleft stick. They need local
    partners because they need someone who has contacts and
    understands how local business works. In some countries,
    partnership with a local company is a legal requirement. But
    foreign investors are equally aware that such ventures can go
    drastically wrong - particularly in Asia and in the former
    Soviet Union, where the distinction between business,
    politics and crime is sometimes blurred. </p>
    <p>&quot;Choosing the wrong joint venture partner can cause
    all kinds of problems. Examples from the former Soviet Union are
    all too common, but businesses operating in Asia are
    increasingly susceptible: foreign executives in China's Guangdong
    province are far more concerned by possible 'official'
    abduction on behalf of a powerful local partner than by the
    greatly exaggerated threat of kidnap by common criminals.&quot; </p>

<p><i>When selecting local partners, business rates fraudulent
activity and criminal connections as their key concerns: both
score over nine out of ten. At the other end of the scale,
political and government involvement (6.8) is rated as the least
of investors' worries.</i> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Control Risks comment</i></b>: &quot;It is worrying
    that investors are not more concerned with the political connections
    of potential partners. Our experience suggests that
    investments can be seriously jeopardised by ignorance or
    naivety concerning such connections. Investors are often so
    preoccupied with macro-political risk, such as wars and
    coups, that they forget about micro-political risk. </p>
    <p>&quot;While any worthwhile joint venture partner will be
    well-connected, you cannot afford to be ignorant of where
    these connections lead. If your partner has access to a
    senior local politician or civil servant, this may help you
    to have licences approved - but such high-profile figures may
    be unable to offer long-term solutions, and might even have
    other interests that will do you more harm than good. Without
    a full investigation of your partner's funding, corporate
    history, business associates and litigation record, you risk
    dealing with businesses which are either in financial
    difficulties or else involved in illegal or unethical
    activities. </p>
    <p>&quot;Another aspect of political involvement became
    apparent in the spring of 1996, when a number of Control
    Risks' clients operating in Russia found their local
    associates behaving increasingly strangely. This behaviour
    ranged from demands for major credit extensions to prolonged
    and unexplained absences from Russia. Research revealed that,
    in almost all cases, this was caused by the jockeying for
    patronage and influence in anticipation of June's
    presidential elections.&quot; </p>

<p><i>When it comes to obtaining information on prospective
business partners, executives rate on-the-ground research as the
most useful source of information (8.1 out of 10). Other sources,
such as services provided by accountancy firms (6.4), corporate
investigative agencies (6.3) and law firms (5.8), are rated much
lower.</i> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Control Risks comment</i></b>: &quot;Proper
    financial information in emerging markets can be almost non-existent.
    Companies conducting their own research should be very
    careful: there is a big difference between knowing what you
    are looking for and knowing where to look. In places like the
    former Soviet Union, information is simply not available:
    they don't have the comprehensive system of databases and
    records which we in the West are used to.&quot; </p>

<h2>Type of investment </h2>

<p><i>Opinion is split several ways over the relative merits of
existing and greenfield ventures. A third of all respondents
express some kind of preference for greenfield ventures, with 42%
coming down on the side of existing ventures. A quarter of
respondents give no clear response.</i> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Control Risks comment</i></b>: &quot;The lack of any
    clear majority on this issue proves that both types of investment
    have their advantages - and their problems. Companies
    investing in greenfield ventures are better able to control
    the project from the start, but will face high initial costs.
    Existing ventures may be more attractive in the short term,
    since they have production lines and workforces already in
    place, but there may be immense difficulties in streamlining
    unprofitable operations and dealing with potentially hostile
    interested parties engaged in organised criminal activity. </p>
    <p>&quot;In many formerly communist countries, nominally
    illicit parallel production lines have long been tolerated.
    Attempts by western investors to close them down have met
    fierce resistance, not just from the incumbent management -
    who stand to lose an established part of their income - but
    from a wider network of wholesalers, distributors and
    retailers. In towns and cities which have been traditionally reliant
    on a single major employer, any attempt to disrupt entrenched employment
    patterns (however corrupt by western standards) can be
    extremely difficult.&quot; </p>

        this is a low ranking for a country whose potential is so
        vast. But this is exactly Russia's problem: it has yet to
        turn this potential into concrete commitments from the

        will continue to rank lower than other much smaller

large companies chosen at random. Those who took part were all
specifically responsible for their company's overseas operations.
A variety of sectors were represented, including aerospace,
brewing, chemicals, commodities trading, communications,
construction, electricity, engineering, food manufacturing,
health, hotels, insurance, media, metals, mines, paper, tobacco,
transport and water.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The aims of the survey were twofold:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2">to secure the views of business leaders on
        current and future opportunities in countries classified
        as emerging economies</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">to gauge attitudes towards local business

<H1>Country Profile - Mexico</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>Crises undermine government</P>
<P>Economic crisis stemming from the devaluation of the peso in December 1994 has undermined the credibility of President Ernesto Zedillo's government, which came to power that month. Pressure for political reform has grown. Mexicans increasingly see the entrenched system of government, in which the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has ruled uninterrupted for 67 years, as a root cause of the economic crisis. The PRI has maintained power through a combination of privileged access to state and media resources, authoritarianism, electoral fraud - and genuine popularity. This structure is increasingly challenged by demographic and social change, and modernisation. Traditional party loyalties are weakening, and the PRI is facing an internal crisis over its role in contemporary Mexico. Zedillo has pledged reform, but faces obstacles from powerful interests. </P>
<P>Meanwhile, the PRI continues to win key election victories. The two main opposition parties, the conservative National Action Party (PAN) and the left-wing Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), compete with each other and split the anti-PRI vote. Disillusion with the PRI-dominated system has not yet moved PAN and PRD followers to put aside ideological differences in favour of a broad front pressing for democracy. The PAN has its sights set on national legislative elections in 1997. Although the PAN scored notable electoral successes in 1995, including three state governments and the cities of Morelia, Puebla and Oaxaca, it is still some way from offering a national alternative to the PRI. Recession will help attempts to mobilise a broad-based movement in favour of reform. </P>
<P>Meanwhile, the PRI's absolute majority in congress limits its need to negotiate with opposition parties, at least until legislative elections in 1997. The PRI will need opposition support only to make changes to the constitution. </P>
<P>Drug-trafficking: an emerging narco-democracy?</P>
<P>Drug-traffickers undermine state institutions, weaken the rule of law and undermine moves towards democracy. Powerful drug mafias bribe and intimidate officials. There are suspicions that drug-trafficking interests were involved in the assassinations in 1994 of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and PRI general-secretary Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu. If drug-traffickers in league with PRI elements were involved in either of these assassinations, this would reflect cartels' increasing power and confidence: their influence has apparently already penetrated the upper echelons of official institutions. Any alliance between drug-traffickers and conservative PRI forces will obstruct democratic reform. </P>
<P>Business faces potential risks from a judiciary, police force and state infrastructure influenced by drug barons. However, most barons have no objection to foreign business. Foreign business has operated successfully in countries such as Paraguay, where drug-traffickers have infiltrated state institutions to a greater extent than in Mexico.</P>
<P>ECONOMIC CRISIS</P>
<P>Prospects </P>
<P>Following the devaluation of the peso in 1994, the economy contracted by 7% in 1995, fuelling unemployment. Inflation rocketed. A $20bn rescue package led by the US Treasury and the IMF, together with a restructuring programme, was designed to combat the immediate economic emergency. The worst of the crisis may now be over; Mexico's repayment of $1.3bn in loans at the end of January 1996 is indicative of healthier finances. Mexico's competitive exports (up 31.2% in 1995) combined with the higher cost of imports resulted in a $7.4bn trade surplus. However, confidence is still shaky and economic recovery will be slow. Optimistic government forecasts see growth being restored late in 1996. Mexico will continue to suffer from high unemployment and inflation in 1996.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Around 1m Mexicans lost their jobs in 1995 as a result of the recession that followed devaluation. The recession has fuelled a crime wave. Mexico City's attorney-general Jose Antonio Gonzalez Fernandez claims that crime in the capital rose by 28% in 1995 compared to 1994. Street crime, car theft, break-ins, armed hijacks of trucks and armed hold-ups of commercial establishments are the principal concerns for business. Corruption and criminality are widespread within the police. Policemen are involved in burglary, extortion and organised crime (particularly drug-trafficking and prostitution). They frequently manipulate the law to secure bribes. There is a risk of banditry in rural areas.  </P>
<P>Kidnapping</P>
<P>Kidnapping for ransom affects wealthy locals nationwide, particularly in the states of Sonora, Sinaloa, Michoacan and Guerrero. Most cases are short-term, for the purposes of robbery or to secure small ransom payments. Foreigners are rarely affected. </P>
<P>A high-profile case ended in January 1996 with the release of Mexican publisher Jose Antonio Perez Porrua, probably after the payment of a ransom. The victim's family had made a television appearance pledging to pay 85% of the original ransom demand; the size of the demand was not  reported. Perez Porrua was kidnapped in December 1995 in the upmarket residential Polanco district of Mexico City. </P>
<P>The Perez Porrua kidnap was the highest-profile incident since 1994, when kidnappers abducted Angel Losada Moreno, the son of a supermarket tycoon, and Alfredo Harp Helu, the head of Mexico's largest financial group Banamex-Accival. Those responsible for the Perez Porrua kidnap may have been involved in the 1994 cases. The kidnappers of Harp Helu, who was released after a reported payment of $30, demanded that his family make a televised pledge to pay the ransom. </P>
<P>The brief abduction of Japanese expatriate Koji Sato Kunabayashi in August 1995 is a rare example of a kidnap of a foreigner. Sato, an employee of a Japanese joint venture between Itochu Corporation and Yamaha, was stopped by a five-strong armed gang in his car while driving home from work in the Roma district of Mexico City. The kidnappers demanded 50,000 pesos ($8,500) from Yamaha. Police rescued Sato along with another victim, a Mexican executive kidnapped earlier. The small ransom demanded and the fact that the gang had earlier abducted locals, suggest that Sato was the victim of an opportunistic kidnap. Gangs target luxury cars on quiet roads near wealthy residential areas. More professional kidnappers have not singled out foreigners. </P>
<P>Drug-trafficking </P>
<P>Drug-trafficking is the principal source of violent crime. Violence between drug-trafficking gangs is increasing as gangs fight for control of potentially lucrative markets. The US government estimates that 50-70% of the cocaine entering the US comes through Mexico, which is also the main source of marijuana and opium latex (used for heroin) imported into the US. The attorney-general's office estimates the street value of confiscated drugs at $350bn, about three times Mexico's external debt. </P>
<P>Some 1,700 heavy trucks cross the US-Mexican border every day, making it difficult to police. Since the introduction of NAFTA, the increased volume of trade between Mexico and the US has made it more difficult to intercept drug shipments. Colombian cocaine cartels have invested in warehouses in northern Mexico to take advantage of opportunities offered by NAFTA.</P>
<P>The drug trade has led to feuding between rival trafficking organisations. Western areas, particularly Sonora, Chihuahua, Durango, Nayarit, Jalisco, Guerrero and Sinaloa, are the worst affected. Drug-traffickers are heavily-armed, typically with AK-47 automatic rifles. Occasionally, incidents pose risks to bystanders. Five people were killed and up to 20 injured in a car bomb attack at the luxury Camion Real hotel in Guadalajara (Jalisco) in June 1994. The Guero Palma drug gang is believed to have ordered the attack against the rival Car Quintero drug family whose members were attending a party.</P>
<P>Drug-related violence does not generally affect foreign business operations. Mexican drug gangs do not stage indiscriminate or large bombings similar to those which Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel used  to confront the threat of extradition to the US. Mexico will not threaten drug barons with extradition (the Gulf cartel's Garcia Abrego has US citizenship). However, the government is tackling the growing use of Mexico as a transit point for cocaine entering the US.</P>
<P>Rural violence</P>
<P>Rural poverty, land disputes and political oppression of Amerindians by caciques (local bosses linked to landowning interests and the PRI) lead to violence, particularly in the backward rural south. Tensions in the southern state of Chiapas led to rebellion by the leftist Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) in January 1994. Fighting lasted two weeks. The EZLN, which comprises predominantly poor campesinos (landless labourers or smallholders) from local Tzetzal and Tzotzil Amerindian communities, includes a core of well-armed fighters. The EZLN is likely to include radical leaders from outside the region.</P>
<P>Despite dialogue between the EZLN and the government, a lasting solution to the Chiapas insurgency remains remote. The EZLN remains determined not to disarm until fundamental political reform has been implemented at a national level. The continuing presence of armed EZLN rebels in the jungles of Chiapas does not pose a direct threat to business, but undermines investor confidence and, indirectly, national economic and political stability.</P>
<P>The EZLN has set a precedent by being seen to achieve political leverage through armed action. This could encourage other anti-PRI activists to resort to violent tactics. Rural violence is high, particularly in Guerrero state, where police killed 17 members of the Peasant Organisation of the Southern Sierra (OCSS) in an ambush in June 1995. Rural poverty, land disputes and corrupt and repressive local authorities have not improved in the state since Guerrero saw armed guerrilla insurgency in 1967-74. Police act with impunity to repress opposition campesino groups, and such repression has reportedly worsened under PRI state governor Ruben Figueroa.</P>
<P>Urban terrorism</P>
<P>Urban terrorism is rare, though the Chiapas uprising prompted EZLN threats to carry out attacks in Mexico City and elsewhere. An anonymous caller claiming to represent the group admitted responsibility for a car bomb attack in Mexico City in January 1994 which injured at least one person. Further attacks targeted a military base and two electricity towers in Naucalpan and Cuautitlan districts in the neighbouring state of Mexico. No one was injured in these attacks, which were claimed by (PROCUP-PDLP). The attacks were designed to show solidarity with the EZLN. Anti-government unrest can have an anti-US flavour. In June 1995 Citibank received hoax bomb threat at two branches in Mexico City. Risks from ad hoc groups using terrorist tactics are slim, but rise during moments of tension in US-Mexican relations.</P>
<P>Unrest and election-related violence</P>
<P>Recession and economic instability have fuelled fears that discontent will lead to more widespread anti-government unrest. The latest recession comes after a period of zero growth in the 1980s, during which real wages fell by 50%. Serious unrest was avoided during this period, mainly through the effective control of organised labour by the government and the PRI through the Mexican Workers' Confederation (CTM). Control of industrial workers is less effective now than in the past as structures associated with the PRI regime are increasingly challenged. </P>
<P>About 1,000 election contests are held annually at various levels.  Despite electoral reforms, vote counts are often disputed and followed by brief outbreaks of violence. PRI activists continue to intimidate the opposition, particularly the leftist PRD. Election-related violence generally takes the form of marches, occupations of town halls and shootings between rival party militants in provincial towns and villages. Election-related violence does not directly affect foreign corporations.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>The government is keen to attract foreign investment, but economic and political instability has undermined investor confidence. Many potential investors seek detailed information and analysis before making decisions on investment in Mexico.  </P>

<H1>Country Profile - France</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>France's fundamental political stability is not in doubt, though rightist President Jacques Chirac and his government are struggling to regain the level of popularity gained following Chirac's election in May 1995. His victory ended 14 years of Socialist Party (PS) rule under Francois Mitterrand and consolidated the political power of the right, which now controls 80% of seats in parliament.</P>
<P>France's resumption of nuclear testing in September 1995 provoked domestic and international condemnation and consumer boycotts of French exports. (France ended all tests in January 1996.) A series of policy blunders and setbacks has fuelled scepticism over Chirac's election promises of increased employment and lower taxes. Chirac and his prime pinister, Alain Juppe, changed their policy priority from unemployment - which stands at 12% - to cutting the budget deficit, including an overhaul of the welfare system. This switch encouraged business, which had feared that the government's policies to cut unemployment would prove inflationary and undermine the longstanding policy of maintaining a strong franc. However, the policy change provoked a wave of public sector strikes and mass demonstrations in November-December 1995. The protests receded after Juppe gave some ground over pensions and the planned reorganisation of the railways, but further cuts - reported to total some $10bn by the end of 1997 - could again provoke unrest.</P>
<P>Chirac's drive to cut the budget deficit is seen to underline his commitment to European economic and monetary union (EMU). However, Chirac is keen to ensure popular approval of further steps towards integration. His position reflects popular ambivalence on the issue: only 51.05% of voters backed the Maastricht Treaty on European union in a referendum in September 1992.</P>
<P>Splits in the centre-right coalition threaten to widen over austerity measures and European integration, particularly if public unrest spreads. Francois Leotard, head of the Democratic Union (UDF - part of the ruling coalition) pledged allegiance to Juppe after being elected in April 1996.  However, Leotard and Edouard Balladur (of Rally for the Republic (RPR) - the senior coalition member) argue that only a promise of tax cuts and an end to austerity measures will ensure that the centre-right retains its predominance in the 1998 elections. Moreover, a number of RPR deputies are wary of the extent of the planned budget cuts and oppose closer European political ties.</P>
<P>A series of corruption scandals has tarnished political and business leaders. Chirac and Juppe have come under attack for the provision of subsidised Paris apartments to government, state and municipal figures and their relatives. Voters tend to assume a measure of venality among public servants, and involvement in corruption is not necessarily a crippling blow to individual politicians. Parliament in December 1994 banned corporate funding of political parties' election campaigns and large individual donations in a bid to curb corruption. However, the prominence of corruption as a political issue is prompting fears that businesses will use the issue to try to damage rivals.</P>
<P>The record 15% vote given to far-right National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen in the first round of the 1995 presidential voting underlines widespread concern over immigration: the FN seeks to exploit popular fears that immigrants are taking jobs and boosting unemployment. Chirac has promised to maintain strict immigration policies and tighten border checks.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Transnational terrorist groups</P>
<P>France has traditionally played a prominent role in Middle Eastern politics, and its high profile in the region raises the risk of attacks by radical Arab groups angered by controversial French policy decisions. Algerian Islamic extremists opposed to France's political and financial backing for the Algerian regime are prime suspects for a series of bombings in public places in the Paris and Lyons areas in July-October 1995. The attacks, in which eight people were killed and 100 injured, included bombs against the rail network and crowded marketplaces. </P>
<P>The Armed Islamic Groups (GIA) - Algeria's most violent extremist group - made an unsubstantiated claim of responsibility for the bombing campaign. In December 1994 four GIA extremists hijacked an Air France airliner with 233 people on board at Algiers airport. They killed three hostages and released 63 passengers before being allowed to fly to Marseilles (southern France), where French commandos stormed the aircraft, killing the hijackers. According to French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, the hijackers had intended to blow up the airliner over Paris on Christmas Day, (25 December).</P>
<P>The authorities suspect that more than one terrorist cell is responsible for the 1995 attacks, and that the attackers include extremists from outside France and disaffected elements resident in France. A network of Algerian-linked Islamic extremists and arms caches is believed to exist in France, and the police believe that some extremists are trafficking drugs and staging robberies in France in order to raise funds. More than 2m Muslims live in France, the vast majority of them of North African origin, and poor socio-cultural conditions have pushed a minority towards Islamic fundamentalism. The vast police clampdown following the attacks may serve to alienate these elements further: North Africans are regularly singled out for security checks.</P>
<P>More than 100 suspected Islamic extremists were in custody in May 1996, and Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre has warned that further attacks are possible. He has only partially relaxed security measures introduced during the bombing campaign.</P>
<P>Further attacks are likely to continue to take the form of bombings in public places in a bid to maximise disruption, public unease and embarrassment to the government. However, attacks could single out state targets and the premises of businesses investing in Algeria.</P>
<P>Middle Eastern groups occasionally play out feuds in France. Attacks are specifically targeted, but pose a slight threat to passers-by. A petrol bomb attack by suspected Kurdish militants against a branch of the Turkish-owned Bosphorus Bank in Paris in October 1993 injured two clients and two staff members. The government subsequently banned three organisations deemed to be fronts for the separatist Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) of Turkey.</P>
<P>Separatist violence</P>
<P>Factions of the separatist Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) are the most active terrorist elements. However, they pose a negligible threat to business personnel and premises outside their Corsican heartland. Bomb and gun attacks on the island are aimed at targets connected with the tourist trade, notably holiday complexes under construction. Other common targets include government buildings, French banks, police stations and French holiday homes. The attacks target property rather than personnel.</P>
<P>The FLNC mounts occasional attacks on the French mainland. These have been restricted to Paris and Provence, with the exception of three bombs against a courthouse and tax and education offices in February 1994 in Mende, capital of the south-central department of Lozere (Languedoc-Roussillon). The devices caused damage, but no injuries. Bombings in Paris are usually small-scale and take place at night.</P>
<P>The government stepped up efforts in early 1996 to combat Corsican violence. It has resisted calls for a security clampdown on the island, fearing that repression will generate sympathy for the separatists. Instead it has begun behind-the-scenes talks with the biggest group, the FLNC's Historic Wing (FLNC-HW), and possibly others. In March 1996 Paris unveiled plans to grant Corsica tax exemptions in a bid to revive the island's economy and give it the special status that Corsican nationalists demand. The FLNC-HW responded by declaring a truce until October in expectation of concessions. The EU is expected to question the economic proposals - which would set a precedent for other regions in the EU -  but France's political weight should ensure the EU's eventual approval. However, hardline separatists are likely to maintain attacks rather than accept a compromise with Paris, while rivalry over racketeering and other commercial interests will continue to provoke violent feuding.</P>
<P>The French Basque separatist group Iparretarrak (IK) is small (it probably has no more than 12 members) and capable of only small-scale bomb attacks. The bombing of a police station in south-western Paris in January 1993 was IK's first attack in the capital. IK action is concentrated in the Basque Country and is generally directed against symbols of the French state, such as tax offices and police stations. French holiday homes and estate agents also are targets. Attacks aim to generate damage and publicity and casualties are rare. IK opposition to a gas pipeline under construction across the Pyrenees prompted IK bomb attacks in the Basque Country against offices of the French oil company Elf Aquitaine in October 1992 and against the pipeline in May 1993.</P>
<P>Ultra-rightist violence</P>
<P>The government has clamped down on immigration and crime, partly in order to gain ground from the National Front (FN). There are occasional right-wing extremist bomb, arson and vandalism attacks, usually against immigrant hostels, synagogues and Jewish cemeteries. Racial violence is most likely in the southern Provence-Alpes Maritimes region, the FN's power base.</P>
<P>Ultra-leftist groups</P>
<P>Ultra-leftists mount isolated terrorist attacks. The tiny Gracchus-Babeuf (GB) group has targeted US interests, but its attacks pose only a minor threat.</P>
<P>Violent protests</P>
<P>Labour disputes can spark off street violence, posing a risk to business personnel and premises. Police clampdowns on drug-dealing, crime and illegal immigration fuel social and ethnic tensions in poor immigrant-dominated suburbs of major cities, including Paris. Violence sporadically erupts in poor urban areas. It is unlikely to single out foreign business interests, but may spread to commercial and tourist areas.</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Crime rates in France are lower than in many other advanced industrial countries, including Germany and the UK. Violent crime is comparatively rare, and petty crime is generally a problem only in urban areas and on public transport. There have been few recorded kidnaps; they do not affect foreign business.</P>
<P>Organised crime affects golf courses, casinos, private clinics, property agencies, public works and the supply and maintenance of slot machines. Such areas, especially those with a high cash turnover, lend themselves to money-laundering. Organised crime is likely to continue to focus on money-laundering opportunities rather than other mafia-style activities such as extortion and kidnapping. In January 1993 the French parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission concluded that special legislation in France was at present unnecessary. However, the Italian Mafia provides a model for organised crime and France offers manifold opportunities for such activities. Italian Mafia groups are active in France, particularly in the south.</P>
<P>Concern at the influence of organised crime in Provence and at links between politicians and organised criminals escalated following the assassination of rightist parliamentary Deputy Yann Piat near the southern port of Hyeres (Provence) in February 1994. The motive for the assassination has not been confirmed, but Piat was a member of the Anti-Mafia Commission and had campaigned vociferously against organised crime and drug-trafficking in the region.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>Foreign business continues to enjoy a broadly favourable political and economic environment. The government acknowledges that inward investment could boost growth and jobs, and is taking steps to improve the environment for foreign business. Finance Minister Jean Arthuis in April 1996 unveiled a series of measures: foreign firms may now bring management-grade staff from abroad (rather than verify first that no suitable French candidates exist), and can have their tax structure approved in advance with guarantees that it would not subsequently be challenged.</P>
<P>However, foreign business involved in new tourist-related enterprises in Corsica has met hostility from local nationalist-minded political organisations. Moreover, sustained strikes and protests such as those of November-December 1995 can seriously disrupt the conduct of business.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - Czech Republic</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>The Czech Republic</P>
<P>The Czech Republic had expected to benefit from losing the less-developed Slovakia when Czechoslovakia broke up in January 1993, but was initially damaged by a large decline in Czech-Slovak trade. This has affected inflation, but unemployment, at below 5%, remains the lowest in Europe - though this could begin to rise dramatically if Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus implements new bankruptcy laws.</P>
<P>Political and social protests in the Czech Republic are extremely rare. However, some 60,000 workers demonstrated against government cuts in social security benefits in Prague's central Wenceslas Square on 25 March 1995 - the biggest anti-government protest since the collapse of communism in 1989. The only other sizeable demonstration took place in March 1994, when some 40,000 people protested against government plans to raise the retirement age. Further occasional protests on labour issues are likely, but will be peaceful. Long-term strikes which would seriously affect business operations are unlikely. </P>
<P>With its many western borders and sizeable foreign investment, the Czech Republic looks set eventually to become as affluent as western Europe.</P>
<P>Slovakia</P>
<P>Slovakia has suffered economically from the separation more than the Czech Republic: unemployment by the end of 1995 is expected to be about 14%, while inflation will be around 10% (down from its 1993 high of 23.2%). An opinion poll released in 1994 found that more than 55% of Slovaks would prefer to renew links with the Czech Republic.</P>
<P>Economic problems are prompting political squabbles and uncertainty. Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) government were ousted in a parliamentary vote of no confidence on 11 March 1994 in protest at Meciar's alleged dictatorial nature. A five-party caretaker government was formed the same day under former Foreign Minister Josef Moravcik, but fared badly in elections on 30 September-1 October 1994. Meciar's HZDS became the largest party, but it has needed to form alliances with the extreme nationalist Slovak National Party (SNP) and the leftist Slovak Workers' Party (SWP) in order to be able to govern.</P>
<P>There are fears that this coalition will pass new measures making Slovakia an unattractive option for foreign investment. For instance, the parliament scrapped the mass voucher privatisation programme on 12 July, replacing it by a bond system, which will effectively exclude ordinary citizens from the privatisation process. Foreign companies will still be able to make bids under the new system, but their chances of success are limited. Control of privatisation has been passed to the National Property Fund (NPF), which is only nominally independent. Foreign companies are likely to find that the NPF favours Slovak companies in privatisation bids, even if foreign bids are higher.</P>
<P>They may also find that the process fosters corruption: for example, Control Risks' sources indicate that during a recent closed-seal bid for a Slovak company, a British company offered more than fives times the amount offered by its closest competitor, a local company. Despite this, the company was sold to the Slovak bidder. Two weeks after the bid, the Slovak company approached the British bidder and sold it the privatised company for the amount first tendered by it - it is not known how the profit was divided.</P>
<P>In a sinister twist in internal politics, there are suspicions that the short-term kidnap of Michal Kovac, the Slovak president's son, by eight men in Bratislava on 31 August 1995 may have been politically, rather than criminally, motivated. President Michal Kovac has asserted that the kidnap was part of a political intrigue against him and implicitly linked Meciar to the affair, declaring that 'Meciar wants my downfall'. The investigation into the incident is likely to take several months to resolve.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Crime poses the greatest security threat facing foreign investors in the Czech and Slovak republics.</P>
<P>Crime in the Czech Republic</P>
<P>Crime rates are higher in the Czech Republic than in Slovakia. Crime rates dropped in 1994, though this masks an overall rise of about 300% since 1989. Some 3-4,000 organised criminals - including many from Russia - are believed to operate in the capital Prague; some 200 Russian mafia members were temporarily detained at a Prague nightclub in May during a party for one of Moscow's major criminals.</P>
<P>These gangs tend to concentrate on extortion and protection rackets, drug- and arms-trafficking, armed robbery and money-laundering. Prague is a major transit point for drug-smuggling; about 70% of all drugs entering Germany are believed to come via the Czech Republic. Mafia feuding may be partly responsible for the quadrupling of the murder rate since 1989. However, these activities will impinge only slightly on Western and Japanese companies: gangs have concentrated on extortion demands and other activities against Russian and local companies. In mid-May 1995, for example, a Russian gang which had extorted over $12,000 from the Blue Duck Restaurant in central Prague was arrested.</P>
<P>Economic crime also is a growing problem in the Czech Republic. In August 1995 the Czech Ministry of Justice drafted a money-laundering bill. The government is concerned that lax banking regulations, coupled with the ongoing mass privatisation programme, have made the country a haven for money-launderers. The police's economic crime department claims that billions of crowns are being laundered every year, much of it by local and international organised criminal gangs.</P>
<P>Crime in Slovakia</P>
<P>Although Slovakia's crime rate dropped slightly in 1994, crime has more than doubled since 1989 and rates in the capital Bratislava have grown five-fold since 1989. Burglaries and car break-ins have risen fastest in Bratislava. Much of the crime in the city is perpetrated by foreigners - particularly illegal immigrants from the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union (FSU).</P>
<P>Personnel in Bratislava should ensure that their cars are secure: foreign-made vehicles are popular targets for thieves. However, crime levels remain below those in Prague, Budapest, Warsaw and most western European cities.</P>
<P>Violent crime is unusual. A suspected mafia car bomb which exploded in central Bratislava on 6 July 1995, killing the car's two occupants and injuring several passers-by, is the first incident of its kind in Slovakia. The police have hinted that the victims, believed to have been brothers, had links with the city's gypsy criminal underworld. The attack highlights increasing organised criminal activity in Slovakia. Much of this is carried out by international syndicates, who use the country as a transit-route for drugs- and arms-smuggling. The sophisticated nature of the attack suggests the involvement of a foreign, perhaps Italian, organisation.</P>
<P>Ethnic tensions</P>
<P>The federal split has increased ethnic tensions in Slovakia. The overwhelming majority of the former Czechoslovakia's 586,000-strong ethnic Hungarian population live in the republic. Ethnic Hungarians and the large gypsy population feel threatened by the prospect of a nationalistic Slovak state. The issue has not prompted violence, but there is a slight risk that economic hardship or disputes with Hungarian nationalists could lead to protest action by Slovak nationalists.</P>
<P>In the Czech Republic, the influx of refugees resulting from Germany's new asylum laws could lead to an increase in ultra-rightist violence (which has previously been very low compared to Germany, Austria and Hungary).</P>
<P>Environmental problems</P>
<P>Like the rest of eastern Europe, the Czech and Slovak Republics have acute environmental problems: more than half the forests and 70% of rivers are badly polluted. However, economic preoccupations have prevented the issue from generating significant public protest.</P>
<P>Terrorism</P>
<P>The Czech and Slovak Republics do not have a history of transnational terrorism. However, there is a slight risk of Serb attacks on Czech government and state-related premises and personnel in retaliation for Czech President Havel's denunciation of Bosnian Serb actions in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The Czech Interior Minister reported in May 1993 that a group from Montenegro (Serbia's staunchest ally) had plotted to assassinate Havel; this was later denied.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>The Czech Republic is eastern Europe's brightest prospect for economic success. New laws allow foreign business to operate under the same conditions as domestic enterprises, workers are largely well-trained and wages are low. The Czech Republic has more viable firms than Slovakia - which is overburdened with obsolete heavy industries - and its geographical proximity to western Europe makes transport costs attractively low for business. Foreign investors in Slovakia are likely to be deterred by the HZDS' re-emergence as the main political party.</P>
<P>German companies make up almost one-third of foreign firms currently investing in the Czech and Slovak Republics. Austrian business has also invested heavily. Although there is widespread recognition that economic progress is impossible without Germany and, to a lesser extent, Austria, there is some resentment at this preponderance of German and Austrian investment. So far, protests against Western business have been small-scale: 20 environmentalists protested in Plzen (Pilsen) in January 1993 against German company Siemens' alleged plans for a nuclear construction project in the city following its acquisition of the Plzen Skoda firm.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - Poland</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>Political divisions</P>
<P>Poland has achieved broad political stability and attracted a reasonable amount of foreign investment since the end of the communist era in 1989.  However, problems remain: the transition towards a market economy has caused increasing unemployment, sharp price rises and conflict between political parties and different power blocs. The resulting popular disillusionment helped the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD - the former ruling communist Polish United Workers' Party (PUWP)'s successor) and the conservative agrarian Polish Peasants' Party (PSL - formerly the communists' loyal ally) to win most support in elections in September 1993. The SLD-PSL coalition has 303 seats in the 460-seat Sejm (lower house of parliament).</P>
<P>PSL leader Waldemar Pawlak assumed the premiership in return for his party joining the coalition, but was later replaced by the SLD's Jozef Oleksy. However, Oleksy was replaced by the SLD's Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz in February 1996 after a formal investigation began into allegations that he had spied for the Soviet Union and then for Russia between 1982 and 1995. The investigation was dropped in late April 1996 without any charges being brought.</P>
<P>Cimoszewicz's appointment is unlikely to jeopardise Poland's fundamental political stability. However, the turmoil surrounding Oleksy's departure will reinforce foreign investors' impression of Poland as a country in which a growing economy and promising investment opportunities are hampered by quarrelling politicians.</P>
<P>Severe tensions within the coalition government, particularly over economic policy, were exploited by the populist anti-communist president, Lech Walesa, during his 1990-95 tenure. However, it is hoped that the victory of SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski in the November 1995 presidential elections will bring more cohesion and reduce infighting.</P>
<P>Labour unrest</P>
<P>Budget-balancing cuts and a sharp rise in unemployment to about 15% have angered workers. There is disappointment that the left-wing coalition government has not heeded workers' demands for higher pay and greater job security. In particular, the Solidarity trade union has sought to mobilise its members to undermine the government and press its demands, which include an end to wage restrictions. However, strikes, though widespread, are generally small-scale and affect individual enterprises rather than whole sectors.</P>
<P>The population at large is generally in favour of foreign investment. However, some people view foreign investment with suspicion, fearing that foreign ownership will further fuel unemployment as investors restructure inefficient state-owned firms, and that profits will be repatriated rather than invested in Poland.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Crime rates continue to rise. Of all the former Soviet bloc states, only Russia and Bulgaria have a worse problem. Almost 975,000 crimes were committed in 1995, almost 8% more than in 1994. Violent crime rose most rapidly. There were an estimated 100 bomb attacks in 1995. The police claim to have solved 54.1% of all crimes during this period. (The Interior Ministry claims that crime rates fell by 12% in the first quarter of 1996 compared to the same period in 1995, but violent crime continues to rise; there were at least 11 bombings in Warsaw and its surrounds alone during that time.)</P>
<P>Organised crime </P>
<P>The Polish National Security Bureau (BBN) claims that about 150 organised criminal gangs are operating in Poland (60 of them come from Russia, Ukraine and former Yugoslavia). About 30-40 of them are large and well-organised. The 11 biggest gangs and their areas of activity are: Pruszkow (nationwide), Wolomin (nationwide), Nikosia (northern coast), Sandokan (upper Silesia), Otwock (Warsaw), Schwarzenegger (Gdansk), Yugoslavia (Krakow), Princes (Lodz), Spring (Gdansk), 'Mr C'(Wloclawek) and 'Mr W' (Bydgoszcz).</P>
<P>Feuds between rival gangs are increasingly leading to violence. In 1995 the Pruszkow gang was involved in a brutal turf war over control of narcotics, prostitution, protection and car-smuggling rackets with its main rival, the Wolomin gang. At least 17 bombings and 12 deaths are attributable to this conflict. In one instance in August 1995 two people were killed in a bombing in Goleniow (north-eastern Warsaw). In March 1995 two Wolomin gang members were killed when a bomb exploded at a luxury villa on the outskirts of Warsaw. The violence was not confined to Warsaw; in February 1995 a car bomb killed two suspected Pruszkow gang members in Lublin (eastern Poland).</P>
<P>Extortion</P>
<P>The increasing threat of extortion is proving to be the major security threat to foreign companies operating in Poland. Before 1994 most extortion demands were made against local business (or against Russian companies by Russian gangs), and foreign companies were not targeted. However, there have been several extortion demands against foreign companies since late 1994, especially those operating in the retail industry.</P>
<P>In April 1996 a bomb explosion at a petrol station of the Anglo-Dutch company Shell in Warsaw killed a bomb defusal expert. The bombing was designed to back up an extortion demand of $2m. It was claimed by the previously unknown anti-foreign GN 95 terrorist group, though this may well be a front for a criminal gang. Shell was most probably targeted because a shop was attached to its petrol station: this generally attracts extortionists (as well as armed robbers).</P>
<P>The other factor that has marked the rise of extortion in recent years is the greater use of violence to back up demands. The bomb attack against Shell was the second bombing connected to a foreign company in Warsaw in less than a month: a bomb damaged a garage selling and repairing German Volkswagen cars on 29 March 1996 as part of a presumed extortion campaign. However, this attack was most probably aimed at the garage rather than the Volkswagen motor company.</P>
<P>Bus hold-ups</P>
<P>Criminal gangs from the former Soviet Union (FSU) are continuing to prey on FSU nationals on roads in eastern Poland. The police claim that there have been 'hundreds' of such assaults in eastern Poland since the start of 1994. For example, an armed Russian gang held up an Estonian bus with 50 foreigners on board near Wyszkow (30 miles (50km) from Warsaw) in August 1995, stealing almost $11,000 in foreign currency. In July another Estonian tour bus with 44 passengers was stopped by a gang of armed men (some of them dressed as policemen), who stole $23,000. The police in August arrested a gang suspected of staging hold-ups, but several other gangs continue to operate in the country. </P>
<P>So far, the gangs have concentrated mainly on FSU nationals, presumably because they assume that this will attract less police and media attention than if they target Westerners or Poles. Nevertheless, many foreign companies transporting goods in the region travel in convoys and employ local security companies to guard their vehicles when in transit and at night.</P>
<P>Car crime</P>
<P>Car crime is a major concern. According to a statement published by the Interior Ministry in January 1996, there were five times as many car thefts in 1995 as in 1994. The 1994 figure already represents a four-fold increase from 1989. Much of this crime is carried out by organised criminal gangs from Russia, where there is a ready market for stolen cars. An estimated 20% of all foreign-made cars driven in Moscow are stolen.</P>
<P>Companies should pay serious attention to their choice of cars and anti-car theft precautions. Locally-made cars and less high-profile foreign cars (including mid-range Japanese makes, for which there is reportedly no market in Russia) are less likely to be stolen than expensive German makes (such as Mercedes, BMWs and Volkswagen Golfs) and four-wheel-drive vehicles. Companies should provide off-street parking for their cars, especially if they deem more expensive makes essential.</P>
<P>Armed car-jackings also are increasing. More than 20 foreigners were held up in their cars in Warsaw in January 1996 alone.</P>
<P>Economic crime</P>
<P>As in Russia, organised criminal gangs are increasingly turning their attention to more sophisticated economic crimes. The number of crimes more than doubled between 1992 and 1995 and is likely to continue growing at a similar rate over the next few years. Crimes include bribery, forgery, fraud and money-laundering. Prosecutors are frequently ignorant of the workings of the modern banking system; they are thus reluctant to pursue banking crime and often delay or discontinue investigations. As a result, more than a quarter of investigations into economic crimes begun since 1992 have been shelved. Many foreign banks operating in Poland carry out extensive due diligence enquiries into prospective partners and deals.</P>
<P>Official response to crime</P>
<P>The government considers organised crime to be the major threat to state security, and a special task force has been set up to tackle the problem. The police force has been undergoing radical reform since 1989. Superficial reforms have included a name change (in 1989) from 'milicja' to 'policja' to give the force a less military tone. Recruitment policy has also been reformed to introduce greater levels of 'community policing', and the authorities have sought to distance the police from its perceived close links with the old repressive regime by hiring younger, better-educated officers in an attempt to foster better relations with the public.</P>
<P>However, it will take some time for these reforms to take effect. The police force is short of funds and continues to face strong public criticism for its apparent ineffectiveness. For example, though many new vehicles have been introduced, limits on petrol mean that it is often difficult to use the vehicles effectively. In addition, low rates of pay mean that corruption is a problem - an estimated 70% of Warsaw's police officers are easily bribed. </P>
<P>Ultra-rightists</P>
<P>Several ultra-rightist groups have emerged and anti-Semitism is a problem. There have been several arson attacks on synagogues and Jewish cultural centres. In March 1996 neo-Nazi 'skinheads' staged a march through the former Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz to protest against the alleged pro-Jewish bias of the local government.</P>
<P>There also is much animosity towards Germans, largely fuelled by historical antipathy resulting from the Second World War. However, the murder of two Germans in the city of Szczecin in January 1996 is unconnected: the victims are believed to have been criminals and were killed by a prostitute. However, the killing of a German truck driver in Krakow by ten skinheads in October 1992 and the bombing of a German cultural centre in Lubon (western Poland) a few months later were both specifically anti-German attacks. Nevertheless, the overall security environment for German and other foreign business is good. Most German companies will not encounter any specific problems, and a sustained violent campaign against personnel or property is unlikely.</P>
<P>Environmentalism</P>
<P>Like other eastern European states, Poland has acute environmental problems. The government has sought to oblige investors to observe environmental standards, but economic hardship has prevented the issue from generating significant public protests.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>The authorities are keen to attract foreign investment and have pressed on with economic reforms, including mass privatisation. A major boom in the influx of foreign investment is expected in 1996 and 1997. Foreign companies are attracted by the fact that wage levels remain low, that private enterprise is expanding and that Poles are entrepreneurial.</P>
<P>Although political instability has deterred foreign investors in the past, it is believed that Walesa's defeat in November 1995's presidential elections will reverse this tendency. </P>
<P>There are few security problems facing companies. Neo-Nazi activity is small-scale and will not single out business. Crime is a growing problem, but levels are lower than in Russia and the threat should be kept in perspective. Companies are likely to have more problems coping with car crime than with extortion demands.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - Turkey</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>The political environment</P>
<P>Civil society and democratic institutions have flourished since the military withdrew from political life in 1983. However, government corruption, political patronage, petty party squabbling and the low calibre of senior public officials alienate the dynamic entrepreneurial classes in Istanbul, Izmir and Adana from the government, and obstruct economic development. These problems are also contributing to the rise of the Islamist Refah party, which emerged as the largest single party in the December 1995 general election.</P>
<P>The two largest secularist parties, Mesut Yilmaz' Motherland (Anap) and Tansu Ciller's True Path (DYP), agreed in March 1996 to form a coalition after weeks of difficult negotiations. Yilmaz will serve as prime minister in 1996; Ciller in 1997 and 1998; and a third, as yet undecided figure, in 1999. However, the coalition depends on the support of the small Democratic Left Party (DSP) to survive: fresh general elections are likely from mid-1997.</P>
<P>The military</P>
<P>The military officially withdrew from politics in 1983 and is content to exercise its influence through the powerful National Security Council. The escalation since 1992 of the Kurdish insurgency in the east and south-east prompted President Suleyman Demirel to give the army a free hand against the insurgents. While prime minister in1994, Ciller courted the military's approval by dissolving the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP) and putting all 16 of its deputies on trial, a move that prompted major criticism of Turkey's human rights record in Europe and the US.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Western Turkey</P>
<P>Kurdish separatist terrorism in western cities</P>
<P>Kurdish separatist terrorism targeting Turkish state and tourist-related interests has replaced ultra-leftist activity as the prime security threat in western Turkey. Istanbul in particular has been affected by Kurdish terrorism. Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) sympathisers and agents planted bombs in front of popular tourist sites in the city in 1994, killing a total of four foreigners. The group also detonated bombs in up-market shopping centres; in bus stations; in front of Turkish businesses, usually in wealthier districts; on cross-Bosphorus ferries; and at railway stations. In February 1995 a PKK bomb exploded at a railway station crowded with reservists, killing five and injuring more than 50.</P>
<P>The PKK has in the past targeted foreign business, and is the prime suspect for a spate of bomb attacks on commercial targets such as Toyota-Sa, the US-owned Bank of Boston, the US-Turkish Koc-Amerikan Bank and Coca-Cola company, and the 5-star Marmara Hotel in Istanbul in September 1992.</P>
<P>Kurdish terrorism in tourist resorts</P>
<P>The PKK also aims to damage Turkey's economy by frightening off tourists. The group's sympathisers staged a series of bombings in places frequented by tourists in Istanbul in 1994 and again in 1995, killing a total of three foreign tourists and injuring more than 40. After repeated warnings, the group planted three bombs in June 1994 in the popular Mediterranean resorts of Fethiye and Marmaris. A foreign tourist was killed and nine others were injured. Twelve foreign tourists were injured in three attacks between June and August 1993 in Antalya and Kusadasi. Combined with the campaign in Istanbul, these bombings caused significant damage to Turkey's tourist trade. The PKK is expected to resume the campaign in Istanbul and seaside resorts in 1996.</P>
<P>Ultra-leftist terrorism</P>
<P>Ultra-leftist terrorism is a persistent but declining menace. Security force crackdowns and internal in-fighting have reduced the capabilities of ultra-leftist terrorists to strike at Turkish and foreign interests in Istanbul and other western cities, and bombings occur much less frequently than in 1991-92. The arrests in 1993 of up to 100 Dev Sol (Revolutionary Left) members has restricted the group to a handful of attacks, such as the killings of policemen and bombings of state symbols. However, Dev Sol re-emerged following the arrest in September 1994 of its leader Dursun Karatas in France for the assassination of a former Justice Minister in Ankara in that month. (Dev Sol adopted the name the People's Revolutionary Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) at about this time.)</P>
<P>Ultra-leftist groups have not been eradicated, and are capable of inflicting serious damage at any time. In 1991 Dev Sol assassinated three Western businessmen (two US nationals and a Briton) in Istanbul and Adana. In January 1996 DHKP-C gunmen murdered one of Turkey's leading industrialists in his office in Istanbul. Ultra-leftists have also targeted Western and (less frequently) Japanese interests in western Turkish cities, staging small-scale bomb attacks on the US-Turkish company General Motors, the Japanese-Turkish company Toyotasa and US and British diplomatic premises in Istanbul and Izmir during 1992.</P>
<P>Islamic extremism</P>
<P>Islamic radicalism and extremism have historically flourished on the fringes. The latest active group, the Great Islamic Eastern Raiders-Front (IBDA-C), is suspected of being linked to hardline nationalists within military intelligence. The group mounts occasional waves of bombings of secularist and state targets in Istanbul and Ankara and, less often, of historic mosques. Fundamentalist unrest is rare, but can be volatile. In July 1993 fundamentalists attacked the organisers of a leftist cultural festival in Sivas. Thirty-six people, including a German tourist, were killed when the mob burnt down a hotel.</P>
<P>Iranian-backed Islamic extremists pose a minor but growing threat in the east and south-east. The main groups, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad of Turkey (IJT), stage occasional well-planned attacks, usually assassinating pro-PKK journalists, politicians and civilians. The Iranian-backed Islamic Action (IA) in January 1993 murdered prominent journalist Ugur Mumcu and narrowly failed to kill Jewish-Turkish businessman Jak Kahmi.</P>
<P>Alevi unrest</P>
<P>The large, mainly secularist Alevi minority is increasingly resentful at what it perceives as institutionalised discrimination and is a potential source of unrest. In March 1995 three people were killed and 25 injured in four days of rioting sparked off by shooting attacks in Istanbul's predominantly Alevi district of Gaziosmanpasa. Islamic extremists were presumed responsible.</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>A rise in petty crime has accompanied Turkey's increasing popularity as a European tourist destination. However, strict policing keeps crime down in most areas. Crime levels in Istanbul are considerably lower than in Western cities of equivalent size. A local 'mafia' controlled by 'babas' (fathers) runs the drugs and vice trade, and shares control with the PKK of drugs routes from Iran and Lebanon through Istanbul on to Europe.</P>
<P>The east and south-east</P>
<P>The Kurdish insurgency</P>
<P>The insurgency by the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) had claimed the lives of more than 19,000 people by November 1995. Kurdish demands range from improved civil rights and ethnic recognition to a separate Kurdish nation state. The PKK originally adopted a Marxist platform, but by 1995 was trying to present itself as an Islamic nationalistic organisation. Ciller plays the popular nationalist card by refusing to grant any real language or education rights and insisting that Kurds are 'integrated' in Turkish society. The government also insists that the PKK is a terrorist organisation and tries to drive a wedge between pro- and anti-PKK Kurds with its system of pro-government village guards. Most secular Turks reject any substantial concessions to Kurdish ethnicity as inimical to the constitution.</P>
<P>The PKK's leadership is based in Lebanon, Syria and Europe, and this gives the organisation's field commanders a large degree of freedom. The guerrillas operate mainly in remote mountainous areas - the lowlands north of the Syrian border are rarely affected by guerrilla activity - from which they launch roadblock ambushes against the security forces and, increasingly, civilians. They also frequently raid security installations, police stations and, occasionally, towns.</P>
<P>The insurgency has affected foreign business operations in Kurdish areas, and few companies operate in remote parts of the region. In October 1993 the US Mobil oil company suspended operations at its Selmo field following several PKK attacks and extortion attempts over the previous thirteen months. The attacks included the killing of three Turkish staff in September 1992 and culminated in the abduction of seven local Kurdish staff from a Mobil rig in August 1993. Guerrillas also attacked rigs belonging to the British-Dutch Shell combine twice in 1993.</P>
<P>In a bid to gain international attention, in 1993 the PKK abducted 19 Westerners in remote areas of the east or south-east, releasing them unharmed after a few weeks. Although the organisation staged only two kidnaps in 1994-95, foreign visitors and Turkish security force personnel remain prime targets for kidnaps in east and south-east Turkey. Most Western embassies have warned their nationals not to visit the east or south-east unless essential.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>The economy was hampered by a major currency crisis in early 1994, but an austerity programme drawn up by then prime minister Ciller, combined with the economy's inherent resilience, had turned the situation around by mid-1995. Istanbul is one of the most dynamic business centres in the Mediterranean, and hundreds of foreign companies are making profitable investments in the country. At present, urban terrorism represents no more than a minor irritant for investors.</P>
<P>Slow progress on privatisation, endemic government corruption and the low calibre of public officials block Turkey's development into a 'Pacific rim'-type economy. Nevertheless, Turkey will remain attractive to foreign investors in the medium term. The fiscal benefits of a planned customs union with the EU will outweigh the inconvenience of initial economic disruption. </P>

<H1>Country Profile - Russia</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>Political instability is the major deterrent to foreign investors in Russia. Events in 1996 are dominated by the 16 June presidential elections. Assuming that the elections take place - rumours abound that President Yeltsin will cancel the elections if he feels he cannot win - they appear set to be a two-horse race between Yeltsin and Communist Party (CPRF) leader Gennady Zyuganov. Neither candidate is likely to secure an overall majority in the first round of voting and a run-off vote will then take place in early July.</P>
<P>Regardless of who wins, there are no easy solutions to Russia's problems.  Most foreign companies favour Yeltsin, despite his alleged alcoholism, ill-health and mishandling of the Chechen crisis: a Yeltsin victory would give the appearance of continuity and stability that investors need. However, there is little reason to believe that Yeltsin will be any more effective at tackling the problems faced by investors (such as crime, corruption, legal shortcomings and bureaucratic hurdles) than he was during his first term in office. Similarly, though a Zyuganov victory would not be a precursor to a return of Soviet totalitarianism, it would not bring about the kind of social democracy seen in Hungary, Poland and other former Soviet bloc countries, where reformed communists have returned to power. At the very least, companies would find themselves operating in an unwelcoming investment climate, and be hampered by crippling taxes and the stalling of the privatisation programme.</P>
<P>Moreover, a Yeltsin victory could entail great long-term problems. Yeltsin suffered two heart attacks in 1995, and it is unlikely that he will live through another four-year term in office. Moreover, Yeltsin outlawed the position of vice-president after the rebellion of the then incumbent Aleksandr Rutskoi in September-October 1993 and has no legal successor. If he were to die in office, fresh elections would have to be held and Russia would face a protracted period of political uncertainty.</P>
<P>War in Chechenia</P>
<P>The war in the rebel breakaway republic of Chechenia has done much to undermine Yeltsin's popularity. Russian efforts to prevent the republic from seceding have resulted in as many as 50,000 deaths since the fighting began in December 1994. Yeltsin will be hoping that the death of Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev in a Russian air attack in April 1996 will end the war. However, this is unlikely, at least in the short term: Chechen fighters will be keen to show that they are not spent forces following Dudayev's death and are likely to step up their campaign.</P>
<P>In the longer term, Dudayev's death could damage the Chechen cause. In a republic where more than 30 ethnic clans vie for predominance, Dudayev had benefited from the fact that he was considered to be above the political fray, having spent his entire military career living elsewhere in the Soviet Union. There is a real danger that violence will break out among Chechen clans as rival deputies (including Shamil Basayev and Aslan Maskhadov) vie with new leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev to succeed Dudayev. The potential for feuding and uncertainty was highlighted by incorrect reports - most probably based on calculated misinformation released by the Russians - that Yandarbiyev was killed in a battle with rivals in April.</P>
<P>Operations in Chechenia are unacceptably dangerous, even for charities and relief agencies. A Belgian working for the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) and her Chechen interpreter were kidnapped near the capital Groznyy by a group of armed men in April 1996. They were held for two weeks before being released; it is not known whether a $200,000 ransom demand was paid. MSF had just resumed its operations in the republic after leaving Groznyy when heavy fighting resumed there in March.</P>
<P>Russia's other regions and republics</P>
<P>Yeltsin is concerned that if Chechenia succeeds in gaining independence, this could set a dangerous precedent for Russia's other 88 republics and regions.</P>
<P>So far, Chechenia is the only republic (or region) to declare independence, but some (particularly Dagestan, Tatarstan and Ingushetia, which are not ethnically Russian) are watching events there closely. However, the almost total destruction of Groznyy by the Russian army is likely to discourage any of the republics from following suit, at least in the short term. The republics have so far contented themselves with more limited demands, including greater control over their natural resources and foreign trade. Most of them recognise that their economies are so intertwined with Moscow that it is unrealistic to consider operating alone. In particular, breakaway republics could find themselves paying high tariffs to transport goods across Russian territory.</P>
<P>Yeltsin has increasingly devolved more power to the regions in return for their support on national issues. The Federation Council, Russia's upper parliamentary house, consists entirely of representatives from the regions and republics.</P>
<P>Foreign businesses may find that upheavals at the national level lead to a similar change at a regional level. Under such circumstances, foreign businesses may be obliged to renegotiate contracts and establish working relationships with new local officials.</P>
<P>Relations with Ukraine, other former Soviet states</P>
<P>The other former Soviet republics are determined to avoid replacing domination by the Soviet central authorities with domination by Russia, which contains half of the Commonwealth of Independent State (CIS)'s population and most of its natural resources, and has taken over much of the former Soviet central state apparatus. However, many of the former Soviet republics now feel that their sovereignty is secure. At the same time, they have to grapple with economic reform without expected large-scale investment. Some are thus looking to revive economic ties with Russia. The leaders of Russia, Belarus, Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan in March 1996 signed an agreement aimed at intensifying economic co-operation, and Belarus and Russia signed a 'union' treaty in April 1996. A Yeltsin victory in the presidential elections would probably encourage even wary former Soviet republics to continue moves towards integration for economic reasons. The republics would be more hesitant about closer co-operation, particularly in the political and military spheres in the event of a Zyuganov victory.</P>
<P>At the same time, Russia's neighbours fear that it will intervene to protect the interests of the 30m ethnic Russians living outside Russia (mainly in northern Kazakstan and Ukraine). Events in Chechenia will have exacerbated these fears. Relations with Ukraine - which have prompted fierce disputes over the control of the former Soviet Black Sea fleet and Ukraine's nuclear status - give most cause for concern. Russian-Ukrainian relations have been further strained by disputes over the fate of the autonomous republic of Crimea in southern Ukraine, where ethnic Russians form the majority. The two countries are determined to avoid conflict over the issue, but may find it difficult to check extremists, who may stage terrorist-style incidents against military targets. Such attacks - and any conflict between the two states - will be confined to Ukrainian territory, most probably in Crimea.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Chechen terrorism </P>
<P>Fears that Chechen extremists will stage terrorist attacks in Moscow and southern Russia have been exacerbated by Dudayev's death. An attack in southern Russia is likely to be similar to the June 1995 seizure by several hundred Chechen extremists of a hospital containing some 2,000 civilian patients in the southern town of Budennovsk. Several hostages were killed, though most were later released. A similar incident in the Dagestan town of Kizlyar in January 1996 confirmed speculation that Chechens are systematically carrying out attacks.</P>
<P>In Moscow, an attack would most probably take the form of an indiscriminate bombing in a public place (for example, against public transport). Chechens have already staged bomb attacks in Moscow and heightened security measures have been in force since mid-December 1994. A suspected Chechen terrorist bomb was defused on a bus on Kutuzovsky Prospekt in the residential district of Kuntsevo in March 1996. The device, which weighed almost 11lb (5kg), would have caused many casualties if it had exploded. In December 1995 a bomb exploded in the parliamentary offices of far-right deputy Nikolai Lysenko in the city centre, causing damage but no injuries. Lysenko, whose party is effectively fascist, has been an outspoken supporter of Russia's intervention in Chechenia. The bombing followed the discovery of a Chechen-planted radioactive package in Izmailovski Park (north-eastern Moscow) in November 1995. The package was found after a tip-off from Basayev. The fact that three of Moscow's six main mafia gangs are Chechen - and are well armed and enjoy close links with the Chechen rebels - adds to the Chechen threat in the city.</P>
<P>Chechens may also hijack domestic flights, particularly in the northern Caucasus. Attacks are less likely in St Petersburg, where Chechen gangs are not as powerful.</P>
<P>Chechen sympathisers have also staged attacks outside Russia in an effort to attract media attention in the run-up to the presidential elections. A pro-Chechen Turkish national hijacked a Turkish Cypriot plane with 101 passengers on board in March 1996. He seized the North Cyprus Turkish Airlines plane en route from Turkish Nicosia to Istanbul and later surrendered in Munich (Germany). Ethnic Abkhaz and Tatar sympathisers resident in Turkey also hijacked a Turkish ferry in January 1996 in sympathy with the Chechen cause.</P>
<P>Chechen attacks on energy sector</P>
<P>Chechens also have staged sabotage attacks on industrial and energy installations in and around Chechenia. Suspected Chechen rebels in March 1996 blew up a gas pipeline in Dagestan. In late February-early March, Chechens twice blew up a pipeline carrying natural gas from Baku (Azerbaijan) to Stavropol (Russia) in the same area of central Chechenia. Although no injuries have been reported in any of the incidents, the damage has been significant. In addition to the pipeline attacks, several arson attacks on pipelines and refineries have been attributed to Chechens.</P>
<P>Chechen militants consider the oil and gas industry to be a legitimate target because it supports Russian interests in the region. The attacks highlight the risk to the main Baku-Novorossiysk pipeline, which will carry 70,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the Caspian Sea through Chechenia. Russian officials admit that they cannot guarantee the pipeline's safety because 12 miles (20km) of it runs through territory controlled by Chechen rebels. Rebel control of a stretch of the pipeline also significantly increases the cost and danger of carrying out repair work on it.</P>
<P>Other terrorism </P>
<P>Other types of terrorism in Russia are rare. A rocket-propelled grenade attack against the US embassy in Moscow in September 1995 - which caused significant damage but no injuries - was a one-off incident. There were no claims of responsibility and the attack appears to have been the work of a Russian nationalist resentful of repeated NATO attacks on Bosnian Serb positions in former Yugoslavia (Serbia and Russia are traditional Orthodox allies). Similarly, the hijack of a tourist bus in central Moscow in October 1995 was the work of a deranged individual rather than a terrorist. Some 27 tourists, mainly South Koreans, were held hostage by the gunman, who demanded a ransom of $10m. All but five of the passengers were released before elite Alpha anti-terrorist troops stormed the bus, killing the hijacker and freeing the remaining passengers unharmed.</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Escalating crime is the most pressing security problem facing foreign businesses in Moscow and elsewhere. Crime has more than doubled since 1991. In 1995 it rose by 6% compared to 1994. Prosecutor-General Yuri Skuratov in May 1996 predicted that crime would rise 2.5 times by 2000. Skuratov in April also claimed that the crime rate was three times worse than official figures suggested because many people believe the police to be so ineffective that they see no point in reporting crimes.</P>
<P>Violent crime and crime against foreigners have risen most rapidly. Crime in Russia is characterised by its brutality. There were more than 31,000 murders in Russia in 1995, a per capita rate almost three times that in the US. About 25 Western and Japanese business people are murdered in Russia each year. A UK businessman was shot dead in St Petersburg's luxury Nevsky Palace hotel in February 1996 after being caught up in a mafia shoot-out, and two US nationals were murdered in their flat in the far-eastern town of Khabarovsk in March 1995.</P>
<P>St Petersburg has the highest crime rates, followed by Moscow, Yekaterinburg and Vladivostok. Steps can be taken to lessen the risk. Most importantly, foreign business personnel should be made aware of the threat and businesses should keep abreast of latest developments.</P>
<P>Extortion</P>
<P>All foreign businesses should be prepared to receive extortion demands. Up to 80% of local and foreign companies are believed to have received such demands from criminal gangs. Businesses that refuse to pay are at risk of violent reprisals. A grenade attack against a building in central Moscow in March 1995, which damaged the offices of several foreign firms - including the Finnish oil firm Neste Oy, the French Paribas bank and the US firms Caterpillar and General Electric - turned out to be an intimidatory attack against an unnamed Japanese company that had refused to pay an extortion demand. The violence is not restricted to Moscow: a large bomb that damaged the premises of a dealer in second-hand Japanese cars in Vladivostok in 1995 also was designed to back up an extortion demand.</P>
<P>The problem can damage investor confidence in Russia. In January 1995 three leading Austrian construction firms - Porr AG, Maculan International and Bau-Holding - reportedly decided to end their operations in Russia because of criminal pressure. A Porr spokesman explained that, despite the presence of security guards, construction sites were 'plundered' and extortion demands were backed up with threats against staff members.</P>
<P>There are no hard-and-fast rules for dealing with extortion demands, and each case should be dealt with individually. Carefully constructed resistance may be possible. Any firm that decides to pay should ensure that it is paying the right gang: demands may be issued by more than one group. However, business should be aware that any company that gains a reputation for paying demands risks receiving further demands in other cities and countries.</P>
<P>Economic crimes</P>
<P>Spiralling economic crime - such as money-laundering, fraud and computer hacking - is posing an increasing threat to foreign companies in the banking, investment and financial sectors. Only about one sixth of economic crimes are believed to be reported. The six major organised criminal gangs in Moscow (and elsewhere) are stepping up their semi-legal business operations - such as money-laundering, currency fraud, and smuggling of metals, timber and other raw materials. Much money is laundered through businesses that are being privatised: the mafia allegedly owns more than 40,000 companies nationwide.</P>
<P>Kidnapping</P>
<P>Kidnaps of foreigners are likely to become an increasing problem over the next few years. A US businessman was kidnapped in Moscow in September 1995 and held in the city for 12 days while his kidnappers demanded a ransom of $40,000. The Russian police, in co-operation with US embassy officials, arrested the two kidnappers when they attempted to pick up the ransom. The businessman, an employee of an unnamed US company, was released unharmed.</P>
<P>The case was the only reported kidnapping of a foreigner in 1995, though the long-term nature of many kidnappings means that information about them can take several months to become public. Information about half of the 20 kidnaps of foreigners that took place in 1994 did not become known until well into 1995. The only kidnap victim who is known to have been killed in 1994 was US businessman Mark Aulov, who was abducted in St Petersburg in March 1994; his burnt remains were found four months later.</P>
<P>Russians working for foreign companies also face at growing risk of abduction. This is because foreign companies may pay ransom demands for their local employees while the police will be less thorough in their search for a Russian than they would be for a foreigner.</P>
<P>In addition to the more traditional kidnap and ransom cases, there were an estimated 40 short-term abductions of foreigners in Moscow in 1995, carried out to back up extortion demands or to force the victim to clear unpaid debts.</P>
<P>Counterfeiting</P>
<P>Criminal gangs are expected to increase production of counterfeit goods over the next few years. Luxury goods with Western brand names command a high price on the black market, and there are many large (now defunct) factories in which counterfeit goods can be produced. Gangs are most likely to counterfeit alcohol and cigarettes, but all foodstuffs could be copied. So far, counterfeit goods have been of poor quality, but standards will improve and will threaten the markets of legitimate business in these sectors.</P>
<P>Competition</P>
<P>Businesses may be targeted for attack if they represent unwelcome competition to businesses run by organised criminals. This may be the motivation behind the assassinations in Moscow of Yugorsky Bank's vice-president Vadim Yafyasov in April 1995 and president Oleg Kantor in July 1995. Yugorsky Bank has close contacts with the oil and energy industry and the police suspect that the bank may have infringed on the interests of a criminal gang operating in this sector. Some experts even consider Yugorsky Bank to be little more than a mafia-controlled bank.</P>
<P>The police </P>
<P>Official attempts to crack down on rising crime have proved ineffective. Until the political situation stabilises there will be no real political will to tackle the problem effectively. The police are under-resourced and under-staffed. Morale is low and corruption is endemic. In October 1995, for example, Moscow's deputy police chief, Boris Kondrashov, stated that about 1,000 Moscow police officers had been dismissed for corruption in the first ten months of 1995; another 6,000 had faced disciplinary action pending further investigation. The admission followed another senior police chief's comment in January 1994 that 'more than 90% of the city's police officers accept bribes'.</P>
<P>The problem of police corruption is not limited to Moscow. In August 1995 Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov went to great lengths to discover the extent of police corruption. He sent a truck-load of vodka from Vladikavkaz in Ingushetia to the city of Rostov, 400 miles (640km) to the north. The driver was stopped at 24 traffic-police posts and forced to pay two million roubles ($470) in bribes on trumped-up charges. Those responsible were immediately dismissed.</P>
<P>Official attempts to crack down on corruption have only a superficial effect as many police officers consider accepting bribes an acceptable way to supplement their meagre salaries. This type of corruption is particularly common in Moscow, the Caucasus and in Stavropol and Sverdlovsk regions.</P>
<P>Industrial espionage </P>
<P>Some companies may be at risk of industrial espionage. Such activities are most likely to target technological companies and high-profile commercial companies. The president of a US medical company was expelled for alleged 'espionage activities'in May 1996. Most companies will not be affected. However, foreign businesses should bear in mind that:</P>
<P>- any employee, foreign or local, is a potential target for an approach; in particular, personnel caught in compromising situations may be exploited;</P>
<P>- close attention should be given to the recruitment of local employees to sensitive positions; potential partners and agents also should be carefully checked in order to eliminate, as far as possible, any connections with the intelligence services;</P>
<P>- most telecommunications can be intercepted;</P>
<P>- executives should be discreet about discussing business matters in public places (such as offices and restaurants) and in hotel rooms, as they may be bugged;</P>
<P>- commercial information should always be kept in sight (even when leaving the room during meetings outside company premises, such as for lunch); and</P>
<P>- office security, particularly control of access and protection of sensitive information (including payroll or currency movements), should be of a high standard.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>The opportunities for investment in Russia are potentially enormous. The country has a large market and a huge, exceptionally well-educated workforce. It is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas, coal, gold, timber, nickel and diamonds. As a result, more than 5,000 foreign companies are now operating there (about 2,200 had been accredited by mid-1996). However, the level of foreign direct investment is small; according to the UN, by March 1996 the figure was about $4.4bn. This is less than the amount invested in either Hungary, Poland or the Czech Republic, and about a 30th of the amount invested in the other emerging giant, China.</P>
<P>It would seem that many companies - attracted by Russia's potential, but deterred by the risks - are operating in Russia in little more than a market research capacity. Continuing political instability, legal and tax shortcomings, bureaucratic hurdles, rampant corruption and rising crime are deterring mass foreign investment. Foreign companies are hoping that the presidential elections will go some way towards overcoming these deterrents, but this is unlikely. Foreign business should not expect quick returns on investments, but realise that any commitment has to be long-term.</P>

<h1>Country Profile - Honduras</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</p>
<p>POLITICAL STABILITY</p>
<p>The President</p>
<p>President Carlos Roberto Reina is continuing to reform the police, the judiciary and the armed forces. 
Reina's ruling Liberal Party (PLH) and the main opposition National Party (PNH) are both conservative 
and hold broadly similar views on major policy issues. There are occasional rumours of assassination 
plots against Reina, some involving the military.</p>
<p>The armed forces</p>
<p>The semi-autonomous armed forces remain resistant to reductions in their strength or their expenditure. 
The armed forces are the eighth-largest business concern in the country, mainly through their Social 
Security Institute (IPM) pension fund. Business interests include finance companies, a real estate 
agency, military supply companies, private schools, an advertising agency, a funeral parlour, a football 
team and a commercial radio station. The armed forces also control (but do not own) the state-owned 
telephone company Hondutel. Local businesspeople complain that this constitutes unfair competition. 
The military is prepared to use strong-arm tactics to obstruct competition from rival enterprises. It could 
use similar tactics in response to intrusion by foreign companies into commercial sectors where they are 
active.</p>
<p>Reina is tackling the reform of the military. Col Mario Hung Pacheco, who was appointed chief of the 
armed forces in January 1996, will be the last to hold that position. When Reina appointed a new 
defence minister in February 1996, he ignored the recommendations made by the armed forces. The 
National Assembly has passed legislation to transfer the police from military to civilian control, and 
Reina will continue to press for a reduction in military expenditure. In an indication of the government's 
commitment to the normalisation of civil-military relations, a civilian court in October 1995 arrested 
military officers suspected of involvement in rights abuses. </p>
<p>Reina has to balance his reforms of the armed forces with an awareness of military sensibilities. The 
armed forces oppose human rights investigations. Human rights organisations saw the deployment of 
tanks in the capital Tegucigalpa in August 1995 as an attempt by the army to intimidate the judiciary into 
abandoning trials of armed forces members. Intimidation of civilian judges involved in such cases will 
continue. </p>
<p>Despite Reina's declared policy of ending immunity for armed forces members accused of abuses, 
former chief of armed forces Gen Luis Alonso Discua Elvir was appointed special alternate ambassador 
to the UN in January 1996. Some saw the appointment as a way of securing Discua diplomatic 
immunity; he is implicated in charges of human rights abuses during the 1980s. However, the 
appointment was probably a trade-off with Discua to avoid opposition to reforms of the military.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that Reina's limited reforms will prompt a military coup to overthrow civilian government, 
though coup rumours are possible during times of political tensions. An internal coup within the armed 
forces remains possible, but this would not affect political stability.</p>
<p>Corruption</p>
<p>Reina has promised an anti-corruption drive, but it is doubtful whether this will yield rapid results. 
Former Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar was jailed in 1995 on corruption charges, but was later 
released for lack of evidence. Proceedings were also brought against a former president, interior 
minister and education minister. The anti-corruption drive may disrupt some contacts between foreign 
companies and governmental bodies as officials are investigated*, and it is likely to encourage human 
rights organisations and others to press for a continuing clean-up.</p>
<p>Links with the US</p>
<p>Security concerns, the weak economy (Honduras remains the poorest country in Central America), and 
historical ties keep the government close to the US. But the provision of base facilities to US troops 
(with whom the armed forces conduct joint manoeuvres) and national sensitivities over Honduras' 
former image as a 'banana republic' fuel latent anti-US sentiment. The US has drastically cut back 
military aid to Honduras, but maintains a reduced military presence at Palmerola air base (Comayagua). 
Civilian aircraft carrying Honduran agricultural produce to the US now use the airfield.</p>
<p>The economy</p>
<p>Reina's structural economic programme has attracted significant interest from foreign investors. In 
October 1995 the government announced a $4.2bn investment plan by Taiwanese business. Reform of 
the tax collection system has increased revenue, and the government will continue with the planned 
privatisation of the state telephone and electricity companies. However, there are doubts over the 
PLH's ability to cope with severe economic difficulties, and in particular to reduce its growing public 
debt without increasing already high unemployment. Labour militancy is likely to grow in opposition to 
austerity measures. Honduras has the highest proportion of unionised labour in Central America. </p>
<p>THREATS TO SECURITY</p>
<p>Border areas</p>
<p>Honduras is still affected by past regional conflicts, when insurgent violence in El Salvador and 
Nicaragua spilt over the borders into Honduras. Some 10,000 Salvadoreans formerly linked to 
guerrillas live in areas the International Court of Justice (ICJ) awarded to Honduras in September 1992. 
However, demarcation is imprecise and there is a risk of clashes between Honduran security forces and 
former Salvadorean citizens, some of whom have arms from Salvadorean guerrillas. El Salvador and 
local clergy have called for people in the area to be granted dual nationality, but the Honduran 
constitution bans dual nationality. Foreigners are not allowed to own land within 25 miles (40km) of the 
border. The dispute is unlikely to prompt military confrontation, but occasional incidents may raise 
tensions.</p>
<p>Criminal gangs occasionally cross the border from Nicaragua to raid isolated farms and hamlets in 
southern departments of Honduras. The area continues to be affected by uncleared explosives near 
former Nicaraguan Contra guerrilla camps abandoned in 1990. The army is engaged in a gradual 
operation to clear an estimated 50,000 land mines from a 55-mile (90km) area adjoining the frontier 
with Nicaragua. </p>
<p>Honduran patrol boats are occasionally involved in minor clashes with Salvadorean and Nicaraguan 
patrol boats in disputed waters in the Gulf of Fonseca in the Pacific. Nicaragua has also disputed the 
maritime border in the Caribbean, claiming it should lie at the 17th parallel. The issue has been 
exacerbated by Honduras' granting of oil exploration concessions in waters south of the parallel claimed 
by Nicaragua. The dispute has led to the seizure of fishing vessels and occasional bellicose speeches, 
but tensions are unlikely to escalate into major armed conflict, neither in the Pacific nor the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Ultra-leftist terrorism</p>
<p>Two indigenous ultra-leftist terrorist groups, the Morazanist Patriotic Front (FPM) and a residual faction 
of the Popular Liberation Movement (MPL-Cinchoneros), carry out increasingly rare 
politically-motivated shootings and bombings. These generally target current or former members of the 
security forces. In April 1995 a leaflet bomb exploded outside three foreign news agencies in 
Tegucigalpa causing minor damage.</p>
<p>Leftist groups oppose the presence of US troops in Honduras: US military and diplomatic offices and 
staff are obvious targets for ultra-leftist attack. The FPM and other, previously unheard-of ad hoc 
groups occasionally make threats against US interests, but the last significant attack was in 1990. </p>
<p>Rightist groups</p>
<p>The activities of rightist paramilitary groups rarely affect foreign business: their usual targets are leftists, 
and labour and human rights activists.</p>
<p>Banana industry problemsBanana workers have become less militant following an agreement in 1995 
with the EU to increase Latin American banana import quotas. Banana plantations are occasionally 
affected by campesino (landless rural worker and smallholder) land occupations. </p>
<p>Amerindian movement</p>
<p>About 10% of the population, an estimated 500,000 people, are indigenous. Indigenous peoples live in 
remote rural areas and are slowly engaging in protest action in defence of land and, for example, human 
rights. They are increasingly demanding increased welfare investment. Indigenous peoples hold 
occasional demonstrations, mainly in rural areas, but in 1995 held protests in Tegucigalpa.</p>
<p>Crime</p>
<p>Violent crime, including armed robbery, burglary and assault is growing, as is organised crime. The 
problem is worst in major cities. People increasingly carry guns for self-protection. Police estimate that 
there are at least 500,000 illegal firearms in circulation. Police report 2,185 murders and $29m worth of 
drug seizures in 1995; the average police to population ratio is 1:1,500-2,000.</p>
<p>Serving or former military personnel and police are involved in drug-trafficking and other crime. Two 
security force members were captured in a bank raid in November 1995. Arms-trafficking is a 
particular problem in the departments of Choluteca and Valle.</p>
<p>San Pedro Sula suffered from several bombings and other violent incidents in 1995. These have been 
attributed to feuding between rival mafia groups or attempts to intimidate the authorities into halting 
plans to crack down on corruption and small-scale mafia-type crime in the local area. Three policemen 
were charged with the murder in May 1995 of a local police inspector working with Interpol 
investigating car thefts near San Pedro Sula.</p>
<p>The police mount frequent roadblocks and security checks, and the army is sometimes brought in to 
patrol the streets of main cities. This has little impact on crime levels. A reform of the police, including 
expansion of the Public Security Force (FUSEP - police) and improved training and equipment, are 
needed before police can combat crime effectively.</p>
<p>Petty crime is a hazard for individual executives in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, but less so 
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Kidnapping</p>
<p>Kidnapping mainly affects local businesspeople and does not involve foreigners. In January 1996 a 
nephew of Reina was abducted and tortured. Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas occasionally engage in 
kidnapping in southern border areas.</p>
<p>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</p>
<p>The political environment for foreign investment is favourable. Labour unions generally recognise the 
advantages derived from investment by foreign companies. However, economic difficulties persist and 
medium-term prospects for higher growth are bleak, despite US economic assistance. Increasingly 
militant labour unions threaten to impede the painful economic restructuring process demanded by 
international lending agencies. </p>

<h1>Country Profile - Venezuela</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</p>
    <p>POLITICAL STABILITY</p>
    <p>The government</p>
    <p>President Rafael Caldera (centrist Independent Electoral
    Political Organising Committee (Copei) President (1969-74))
    assumed office in February 1994 following elections in
    December 1993. The elections followed the impeachment of
    President Carlos Andres Perez in May on charges of
    embezzlement.</p>
    <p>Caldera has failed to consolidate his National Convergence
    Movement (CN) as a national political party. In local
    elections in December 1995, CN won only one of the 22 state
    governorships contested. The low turnout reflected widespread
    pessimism about the economy. However, the fact that the
    centre-leftist Democratic Action (AD) and the leftist
    Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) did well in the elections
    suggests that Caldera has successfully forged a broad
    consensus behind government economic policy despite CN's weak
    legislative base. Formally an opposition party, AD broadly
    supports Caldera's policies.</p>
    <p>Economic crisis is forcing Caldera to renege on his
    populist campaign pledges (which included the abolition of
    value-added tax, a slowing down of the privatisation process
    and the maintenance of low petrol prices). His government
    faces recession, inflation, a huge budget deficit and
    increasingly burdensome foreign debt payments. Any IMF deal
    is likely to prove unpopular because it will involve the
    lifting of price controls and other consumer subsidies.</p>
    <p>The military</p>
    <p>Caldera has strong control over the military and the
    chances of a coup are very slim. The high command generally
    supports the constitution; it will not intervene unless
    civilian politicians prove incapable of containing unrest.
    This is increasingly unlikely (see ANTI-GOVERNMENT UNREST,
    below).</p>
    <p>Army rebels staged two coup attempts, centred on Caracas,
    in 1992. Rebels attacked strategic sites, including the
    Miraflores presidential palace, the La Carlota military
    airport and television stations: around 200 people were
    killed. Grievances stemmed from the rejection of Perez's free
    market reforms, which the rebels considered imposed from
    abroad by international creditors thus offending their
    nationalist sensibilities; a rejection of corruption in the
    governing elite; a decline in pay; and suspicion that the
    government would give away territory in border negotiations
    with Colombia.</p>
    <p>The 1992 coup attempts failed because the rebels had
    insufficient support within the military high command. If
    junior nationalist officers (who were behind the coup
    attempts) seek to take advantage of political uncertainty by
    launching another coup attempt, lack of support from the
    military high command will again prevent them from
    succeeding. Caldera's conciliatory approach towards the
    military has in any case eased the risk of further military
    unrest. Caldera has released most of the 1992 coup leaders
    and has replaced controversial Defence Minister Gen Radames
    Munoz Leon, whom the rebels strongly opposed. </p>
    <p>The military in politics</p>
    <p>The lack of a clearly-defined role for the military in
    modern Venezuela lies at the root of military unrest. The
    armed forces remain key players, but for the most part
    anti-government sentiment is channelled through legitimate
    political mechanisms. One of the key coup leaders, Lt-Col
    Francisco Arias Cardenas, is now governor of oil-rich Zulia
    state following the December 1995 elections as a result of an
    alliance of convenience with the leftist Causa Radical (Causa
    R).</p>
    <p>The leader of the February coup attempt, Lt-Col Hugo
    Chavez Farias, maintains a more intransigent opposition to
    established political mechanisms. Chavez leads the
    nationalist/populist Bolivarist Revolutionary Movement
    (MBR-200), which gained the status of a legal party in March
    1994, but which boycotted the December 1995 elections,
    alleging that established electoral procedures are biased and
    corrupt. MBR-200 espouses an unclear military nationalism and
    generally keeps a low profile. The government on occasion
    accuses the MBR-200 of being behind protests and
    demonstrations which turn violent, and arrests alleged
    MBR-200 members. However, there is no evidence linking the
    MBR-200 to specific cases of violence. Many believe that
    government accusations against MBR-200 stem from fears that
    the charismatic maverick Chavez could rally wider support for
    his anti-government campaigns if price rises and shortages
    became more widespread.</p>
    <p>THREATS TO SECURITY</p>
    <p>Crime</p>
    <p>Rising crime, fuelled by increasing poverty, is the main
    security risk. Poorer areas ringing main towns are worst
    affected, though city centres can be unsafe at night. Crime
    is worse in Caracas than in other cities. Muggings and
    assaults are common and cars and houses are frequently broken
    into after dark in residential areas and main shopping
    centres.</p>
    <p>Anti-government unrest</p>
    <p>The government of former President Carlos Andres Perez was
    caught unawares in February-March 1989, when shortages and a
    rise in gasoline prices sparked off widespread looting and
    rioting. Around 300 people were killed when the security
    forces intervened. Violence on this scale has not recurred,
    and the frequency of unrest has declined under Caldera. The
    security forces now generally contain protests, which are
    typically led by students and take place in campus areas of
    main cities or in outlying poor suburbs and shanty towns.
    Unrest can spread to city centres, disrupting traffic and
    commerce as buses and private vehicles are often destroyed.
    The security forces use force to repress any sign of serious
    trouble.</p>
    <p>'Subversive groups'</p>
    <p>Organised radical agents provocateurs may well be involved
    in anti-government unrest. However, government claims that a
    mysterious 'hairy hand' (mano peluda) promotes sporadic
    violent protests against price rises to destabilise the
    government are frequently a smokescreen intended to distract
    attention from the legitimate economic grievances of those
    who oppose government economic policy, but who do not support
    widespread violent protests.</p>
    <p>Terrorism</p>
    <p>Domestic terrorism remains rare. Wealthy market spectators
    were responsible for the most serious outbreak of urban
    terrorism seen in Venezuela, a wave of bomb attacks in
    July-August 1993. The bombings were apparently designed to
    create a climate of instability in the financial markets to
    allow the speculators to make a quick profit by buying shares
    at depressed prices. Nine people found guilty of the bombing
    conspiracy were jailed in May 1995. There has been no
    repetition of such attacks.</p>
    <p>Colombian guerrillas</p>
    <p>The only significant continuing terrorist threat is
    confined to the border area with Colombia (see below).</p>
    <p>Other groups</p>
    <p>Ad hoc ultra-leftist groups occasionally appear, but they
    are generally short-lived and rarely pose a threat to
    business activities. For example, a group called Popular
    Liberation Front (FPL) surfaced on 2 May 1994 with a single
    attack: a small homemade bomb which injured five passengers
    on a Caracas Metro (subway) train. No further evidence of the
    group's existence has come to light since the May 1994
    incident.</p>
    <p>Previous anti-government sentiment on the part of the
    military has generally been successfully channelled into
    mainstream politics (see above - THE MILITARY IN POLITICS).</p>
    <p>Western border areas</p>
    <p>The activities of drug-traffickers, smugglers, Colombian
    Simon Bolivar Guerilla Co-ordination (CGSB) guerrillas and
    bandits make the Colombian border region hazardous,
    particularly in Apure and Tachira departments. Colombian
    guerrillas mount regular incursions into Venezuelan
    territory, where they clash intermittently with the
    Venezuelan security forces. CGSB guerrillas killed eight
    Venezuelan marines in an attack on a Venezuelan naval base on
    the Meta river (Apure) in February 1995, prompting the
    government to establish military control over certain areas
    bordering Colombia and to deploy 5,000 troops in the border
    region. This was the most serious clash between CGSB
    guerrillas and the Venezuelan security forces for years.</p>
    <p>Guerrillas also carry out an estimated 20 kidnaps each
    year of local ranchers and their dependants. In an isolated
    incident affecting a foreign firm, a Chilean oil worker was
    killed in November 1992 as he tried to escape from
    ultra-leftist Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (FARC)
    guerrillas.</p>
    <p>The frequency of attacks by Colombian guerrillas against
    foreign operators is expected to rise as foreign
    participation in the oil sector increases. Oil companies
    taking advantage of new opportunities in border states as a
    result of the January 1996 licensing round potentially face
    some of the same risks, if not to the same degree, as those
    facing companies on the Colombian side of the border.
    Companies may initially be approached by guerrillas asking
    for food or clothing: this may be a precursor to a more
    ambitious extortion attempt or even kidnap. Seismic companies
    are particularly vulnerable because they operate in remote
    areas without permanent bases and surveys are carried out in
    predictable and regular grid patterns.</p>
    <p>Colombian drug-traffickers take advantage of the largely
    unpatrolled and unpopulated border to move drugs by air or
    boat. Venezuela is not a significant producer of cocaine, but
    is an important operational centre and shipment route for
    drugs going to the US and Europe. Drug-traffickers are
    probably responsible for the hijack in February 1993 of a
    light aircraft in remote rural areas. Colombian
    drug-traffickers are probably responsible for the hijack in
    February 1993 of a light aircraft with Canadian tourist site
    owner Clayton Lufgren and US tourist Jean Lamarque on board.</p>
    <p>Despite government efforts, security conditions in border
    areas are unlikely to improve significantly; the border area
    is more than 1,250 miles (2,000km) long and poor
    communications stretch already limited resources.</p>
    <p>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</p>
    <p>Venezuela is opening up its economy to make it more
    attractive to foreign investors. Opportunities exist in the
    manufacturing and energy sectors. The government is seeking
    to speed up the privatisation process in 1976, the oil sector
    is being opened up to private - including foreign -
    investment. However, legal guarantees for investors remain
    inadequate. Government-imposed exchange and price controls
    distorted the economy in 1995, deterring foreign investment
    through restrictions on capital repatriation and damaging the
    ability of local business to secure vital imports. Caldera's
    government will pursue a broadly pragmatic middle course
    between populism and liberal structural reform, but will be
    hampered by the continuing economic crisis.</p>

<H1>Country Profile - Peru</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>Fujimori in second term</P>
<P>President Alberto Fujimori is set to govern until 2000 following his re-election in April 1995, when he swept to a comfortable victory with 65% of the vote. Such a clear popular mandate strengthens Fujimori's democratic legitimacy, which has been in question since April 1992 when he dissolved Congress and the judiciary and ruled by decree with the backing of the armed forces.</P>
<P>However, despite his mandate, Fujimori's victory does not augur well for democracy, which is weak and will be prevented from developing further by his strong authoritarian tendencies. His administration will not be subject to rigorous checks and balances or other forms of democratic scrutiny to help ensure good government.</P>
<P>Fujimori's Change 90/New Majority (NM) coalition has a majority in the 120-seat unicameral chamber, a dominance that may persuade him to delay much-needed judicial reform. Furthermore, the disarray of the traditional political parties, re-confirmed by congressional elections held concurrently with the presidential elections, limits the opportunities to articulate and organise opposition and healthy debate. Fujimori's Change 90-NM is a loose coalition, which was designed to ensure Fujimori's re-election, rather than a traditional political party attracting firm ideological loyalties.</P>
<P>The armed forces</P>
<P>Fujimori's main support base is the armed forces. He retains the conditional backing of most of the high command, though his relationship with armed forces head Gen Nicolas de Bari Hermoza is difficult. Fujimori has protected the armed forces from accusations of human rights abuses and given them wide powers to fight ultra-leftist insurgency.</P>
<P>In 1995, Fujimori pushed through an amnesty law releasing members of the Colina Group army death squad found guilty of the 1992 killings of nine university students and a tutor. Attempts by some legislators and judges to oppose the law provoked unusual military manoeuvres in Lima - a thinly veiled threat to the courts against pursuing human rights investigations. The episode illustrates both Fujimori's autocratic style of government and the extent to which the army wields behind-the-scenes influence.</P>
<P>Tensions between Fujimori and the armed forces have arisen over a border conflict with Ecuador; the military may put pressure on the government for greater investment in weapons. However, the army is unlikely to attempt an overthrow of civilian government. In any case, the military does not feel that it can manage the economy any better than the present government.</P>
<P>Guerrilla insurgency</P>
<P>The capacity of the extreme leftist group Sendero Luminoso (SL) to wage guerrilla war and intimidate the population has declined significantly since the arrest of leader Abimael Guzman Reynoso in September 1992. Attacks in Lima are rare and increasingly confined to small bombings and shootings in low-income residential districts. However, two car bombs in Lima in 1995 show that SL hardliners are still capable of larger attacks.</P>
<P>During SL's periods of strength, it represented a serious threat to the state, not because it was ever likely to gain power but because it made military takeover of government a constant threat. SL attracted support from the rural and urban poor and increased the power of the movement further by intimidating poor communities. The government succeeded in resisting the spread of SL partly by arming the civilian population into 'rondas campesinas' (rural civilian self-defence militias).</P>
<P>SL is divided between Guzman's supporters who argue that armed struggle no longer serves their ends and the 'Red Path' faction, led by Oscar Durand Ramirez (alias 'Feliciano'), which continues the guerrilla war. Feliciano controls SL's organisational structure. Leading pro-Guzman activists are in prison. The division has speeded up the demise of SL as a threat.</P>
<P>Feliciano is believed to be involved in guerrilla activity in eastern coca-growing regions of Apurimac or Ayacucho. SL's hardline faction is strongest in the coca-growing regions of the Huallaga valley (Huanuco and San Martin departments) where the guerrilla presence frequently results in clashes with the army. Within the Red Path faction there are thought to be tensions between Feliciano and the SL leader in the Huallaga valley, believed to be Eulogio Cerdon Cardoso ('Artemio').</P>
<P>The economy</P>
<P>Economy Minister Jorge Camet has pledged to reinforce the economic reforms of the last five years to encourage domestic savings and healthy, stable growth rates. Peru's growth rates have been among the highest in Latin America in recent years, partly as result of the 'Fujishock', a tough programme of economic austerity measures introduced by Fujimori following his election in 1990. Camet's predecessor Carlos Bolona had succeeded in reducing inflation from more than 7,000% to 56.7%, the lowest rate in 15 years, but at a cost of deep recession and growing poverty.</P>
<P>The mining sector has led the way in attracting foreign investment. Fujimori's liberalisation of mining laws and the near-defeat of the ultra- leftist insurgency under his government have led to forecasts that spending on mining projects will reach $9bn over the next ten years. Some 80 foreign mining companies are currently exploring in Peru, mainly for gold.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Terrorism</P>
<P>States of emergency restricting individual constitutional rights apply in departments, provinces and cities covering 32% of the country's territory (where up to 50% of the population lives). The military has maintained extensive powers of control in these areas despite a decline in guerrilla insurgency. The emergency areas include metropolitan Lima and Callao and most of Lima department. Guerrilla violence is worst in isolated eastern jungles areas, particularly in Huanuco, San Martin and Junin.</P>
<P>SL targets</P>
<P>SL has assassinated mayors, local officials and civilians participating in government-sponsored community aid projects in a bid to deter the population from co-operating with the government. Guerrilla violence most frequently takes the form of clashes with the army in coca-growing regions. Bombings, assassinations and coercion are other favoured SL tactics. Most attacks take place in low-income areas, where they do not pose a risk to corporate offices or expatriates.</P>
<P>Attacks on other traditional targets are less frequent than before, but remain possible. Targets include: political party offices; local or national government offices; electricity installations; police and armed forces premises; banks; vital centres of production (mines and large farms); communications networks; and more luxurious places of entertainment such as hotels and restaurants. An SL car bomb killed four at the Maria Angola hotel in Lima's up-market Miraflores district in May 1995.</P>
<P>Anti-foreign attacks</P>
<P>SL opposes foreign investment and occasionally targets the interests of foreign companies for attack. In July 1995, SL murdered a Peruvian geologist under contract to Denver (US)-based mining company Crown Resources in La Libertad department. Pinned to the victim's body was a general threat to other foreign companies.</P>
<P>SL has a history of hostility towards interests representing 'white' or 'mestizo' (mixed race) supremacy or foreign assistance to the government; this includes foreign business. The most common foreign targets have been diplomatic premises of donor countries, particularly the US but also Japan, China, Chile, France, Spain and others. Foreign development agency workers have received threats, and on occasion have been killed by SL terrorists. The election of Fujimori, who is of Japanese descent, focused SL's attention on Japan: SL has targeted Japanese aid projects and their employees as well as Japanese business and diplomatic premises. However, there have been few attacks on foreign targets in recent years, a development consistent with SL's overall decline.</P>
<P>MRTA</P>
<P>Arrests in late 1995 indicated that Peru's second guerrilla group, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), was attempting to make a comeback. Police arrested MRTA activists in November-December and foiled a plot to storm Congress and seize leading legislators. Among those arrested was MRTA's second-in-command Miguel Rincon Rincon. Also in November, MRTA activists in Bolivia kidnapped prominent local businessman and former planning minister Samuel Doria Medina. The victim was released in December 1995 after the reported payment of a ransom.</P>
<P>Under its leader, Nestor Cerpa Cartolini, MRTA probably has the capability to carry out occasional further high-profile operations, including kidnaps. MRTA is more likely to target the local business community rather than foreign executives. The group may continue to present a threat to foreign business because of its practice of targeting companies for extortion.</P>
<P>Border conflict with Ecuador</P>
<P>Border tensions with Ecuador erupted into an undeclared border war with almost daily military clashes in January-February 1995. An informal ceasefire is in place, and is monitored by Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the US. The dispute is unlikely to escalate into wider conflict, as this would endanger both countries' economic recovery. Nationalist pressure on both sides means that there may be occasional skirmishes in the border area, though these pose little threat to foreign oil and mining companies' operations in the region.</P>
<P>Colombian border area</P>
<P>Foreign oil companies operate in the Amazon region. Security is poor in Colombian border areas of the Amazon. Peruvian and Colombian guerillas and drug-traffickers operate in the tropical rainforests which largely cover Loreto department.</P>
<P>Kidnapping</P>
<P>Criminal gangs frequently kidnap local middle-income, or even low-income, business people such as shopkeepers. Local wealthy business people in Lima also face the threat of kidnapping by MRTA or criminal gangs. No foreigners have been kidnapped in recent years, though there is a slight risk that kidnappers could target a resident foreign national or local employee of a foreign business. Wealthy Peruvians of Japanese descent are targeted because of their financial resources rather than their Japanese connections.</P>
<P>Narcotics</P>
<P>Peru, and in particular the Huallaga Valley (San Martin and Huanuco), is the world's largest producer of coca leaf. Coca is produced and refined in highland valleys and shipped to Colombia and the Caribbean for transport to the US. SL, MRTA, drug-traffickers and corrupt army officers compete for control of the drug trade. Their presence poses a major security risk in San Martin, eastern Junin and Ucayali. The involvement of army officers in the drug trade may undermine their loyalty to constitutional government.</P>
<P>US involvement in combating drug-trafficking has brought the US into direct conflict with ultra-leftist guerrillas. Some 25 US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents assist police from a joint US-Peruvian base at Santa Lucia (San Martin): SL has attacked the base in the past.</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Lima suffers from high levels of violent and petty crime, and the old city centre is overcrowded and unsafe even during business hours. The residential/business districts of San Isidro and Miraflores are considerably safer. Provincial cities generally have a lower level of crime. Highway robbery on main and side roads outside Lima and other main cities is a concern.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>Foreign companies with interests in Peru generally welcomed President Alberto Fujimori's</P>
<P>second presidency as it represents continuity in free market policies attractive to foreign investors. Inflation is falling and economic growth has been restored. IMF-inspired reforms will broadly continue. Economic liberalisation is partly designed to attract foreign investment; Fujimori is pushing through the privatisation of state companies, including the state oil company Petroperu, despite opposition from unions. The weakness of democratic institutions will remain a long-term issue of concern to investors.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - Chile</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>In the first transfer of power between two democratically-elected governments since 1970, Eduardo Frei of the ruling centre-left Coalition of Political Parties for Democracy (CPPD) assumed the presidency in March 1994 after winning a convincing victory in presidential elections in December 1993. He will govern for six years.</P>
<P>Frei is a businessman and a senator of the largest party in the CPPD, the centrist Christian Democrat Party (PDC). He has maintained the CPPD coalition, while bringing new personnel into government. Former President Patricio Aylwin's policies have been continued - these aim to reduce the size of the state apparatus and to promote a free-market economy while simultaneously promoting social justice.</P>
<P>The armed forces</P>
<P>Despite the continued consolidation of democracy, full political reform is obstructed by the right and provokes tensions between the military and the government. The constitution, drawn up by former dictator Gen Augusto Pinochet in 1980, ensures that the right is over-represented in the Senate and that Pinochet remains army Commander-in-Chief until 1997. The CPPD has a comfortable majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies, but Frei will have to reach agreement with the rightist opposition if he is to secure the two-thirds majority required for constitutional reform.</P>
<P>Civil-military tensions also stem from demands for investigations into large-scale human rights abuses under the former military dictatorship. The imprisonment in October 1995 of former DINA intelligence service chief Gen Manuel Contreras resolved a key civil-military dispute. Contreras had been evading arrest since the Supreme Court in May 1995 upheld jail sentences against him and his deputy Brig-Gen Pedro Espinoza for their involvement in the 1976 assassination of exiled former Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier. However, tensions continue to surface over the government's attempts to legislate a new framework for tackling the remaining human rights cases. There has been only a handful of prosecutions.</P>
<P>The government is caught between the conflicting pressures from human rights groups (supported by the Socialist Party (PS)) and the military (supported by right-wing parties such as Independent Democratic Union (UDI)). Human rights groups oppose government efforts to speed up the pace of prosecutions on the grounds that this hampers efforts to conduct thorough investigations. The military is hostile to all prosecutions. The government must pursue demands for justice while being careful to avoid any actions which could prompt an outbreak of civil-military tensions. Tensions are unlikely to escalate to a point where the armed forces would consider interrupting civilian government. However, the eruption of civil-military tensions can prompt violent demonstrations which in the short-term damage Chile's image in the international community and in the longer term prolong the whole civil-military dispute.</P>
<P>However, the government's relations with the armed forces are workable. In current circumstances, the military is most unlikely to intervene in politics and Frei is unlikely to insist on reforms that might significantly increase the risk of a coup. Broad economic stability and a commitment by parties across the political spectrum to resolve disputes through institutional mechanisms further reduces the prospect of military intervention.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Terrorism</P>
<P>There have been no terrorist attacks by international terrorist groups.</P>
<P>On the domestic front, divisions have weakened the armed left since the return of civilian government. Hardliners have regrouped and continue to carry out occasional attacks, but the level of extremist violence is decreasing.</P>
<P>Small-scale sporadic terrorism by small guerrilla organisations generally targets the security forces, the infrastructure and the political establishment. Government offices, electricity installations, security force premises and transport are the most common targets. Attacks are not designed to kill or injure; they are generally staged outside business hours, and rarely cause casualties. Ultra-leftists frequently mark significant anniversaries with attacks. The ultra-leftist Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Movement (FPMR) claimed a series of small bomb attacks in Santiago on 21-22 October 1995 to mark the anniversary of the 1988 killing of two FPMR activists in clashes with the military. The bombings damaged government buildings and political party headquarters but did not cause any injuries.</P>
<P>High-profile foreign companies, particularly those involved in labour disputes, are an occasional target. Guerrillas are ideologically opposed to the US and US foreign policy initiatives in Latin America have prompted attacks. However, these are now rare: the most recent spate of bombings against US targets occurred in Santiago on 27-29 March 1992, when a bomb damaged a branch of the US-owned Citibank.</P>
<P>Armed ultra-leftists will continue to operate as long as Pinochet heads the army and until institutional structures associated with the former military regime are dismantled. Armed leftists are supported by a small but significant proportion of Chile's poor, who have yet to benefit economically under civilian democracy or to see human rights crimes under Pinochet resolved. In addition, ultra-rightists are widely believed to have infiltrated leftist guerrilla groups with the aim of destabilising the country and discrediting civilian democracy.</P>
<P>Amerindian tensions</P>
<P>There are up to 100 land disputes in southern Chile involving Amerindians. Chile's 1m indigenous inhabitants, predominantly Mapuche Indians, mostly live in urban areas, but an estimated 135,000 remain in 3,000 communities in the forested regions of southern Chile, many in extreme poverty. Under civilian democracy, Amerindians have stepped up their demands for restitution of their ancestral lands.</P>
<P>Local Amerindian groups are opposed to all ventures which encroach on lands which they claim are ancestral. Currently, protests by local Amerindian groups focus on energy projects and foreign timber companies in southern Chile. Protests are generally small-scale, posing few serious threats to business operations. For example, Amerindian pressure groups have led peaceful takeovers of land, some of which is owned by forestry companies. Most Amerindian protest action has been peaceful, but extremists may exploit indigenous anger to mount small attacks against domestic and foreign timber companies. Mapuche Indians protesting against construction in their territory clashed with police in Temuco (La Araucania) and Santiago in October 1994. Ultra-leftists have occasionally carried out attacks to exploit the issue.</P>
<P>The environmentalist and Amerindian lobbies will attract increasing interest and support from the international green lobby in the light of Chile's efforts to gain access to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Businesses alleged to be infringing environmental laws or encroaching on indigenous lands are likely to come under closer scrutiny.</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Crime has increased in recent years, particularly in Santiago, but remains low by Latin American standards. However, house-breaking, bank robberies and violent assaults do occur. Foreigners have been mugged. Kidnaps are rare and involve wealthy locals rather than foreigners.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>There is a broad consensus among all the major parties about the importance of a democratic political system and a free-market economic system. Government policy under Frei is favourable to foreign business and foreign investors benefit from open market policies, political stability and a transparent straightforward regulatory framework for business. Foreign companies operating in Chile generally enjoy the same conditions as local counterparts. But continued economic success hangs largely on the ability of the government to contain and appease high social expectations.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - Columbia</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>President to fall?</P>
<P>A political crisis in 1995-96 has tested the country's traditional institutional stability. There are allegations that President Ernesto Samper has links to the Cali cartel. A judicial investigation into alleged Cali cartel funding of Samper's 1994 election campaign and his own personal enrichment could mean that his position becomes untenable. </P>
<P>Evidence against Samper includes testimony from his former close aide, campaign manager and Defence Minister Fernando Botero. Botero resigned his post in August 1995. Only Congress can remove Samper. Vice-President Humberto de la Calle is not implicated in the judicial investigations and would be Samper's natural replacement. However, Samper's removal from office may prompt calls for fresh Congressional elections before a new president is appointed. </P>
<P>Samper's government was elected on a platform to encourage economic growth and maintain foreign investment, while increasing social spending and countering violence. But the political crisis has distracted Samper from giving full attention to these issues and to other initiatives, such as renewing the peace process with the CGSB.</P>
<P>A new constitution introduced in 1991 confirmed an end to the ruling Liberal Party (PL) and conservatives' institutionalised hold on power. The constitution also introduced reforms relating to the rights of individuals, the structure of government and the justice system. However, a gulf remains between what the constitution promises and what the government delivers, particularly in the judicial field. The traditional parties' control of power remains as strong as ever.</P>
<P>Violent opposition to the government </P>
<P>Colombia's history of rebellion and resistance to central government means that the state is used to withstanding high levels of violence. Ultra-leftist insurgency currently represents the main challenge to government authority.</P>
<P>The ultra-leftist Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Co-ordination (CGSB), with approximately 12,000 guerrillas, is unlikely to be defeated militarily. The peace process resulted in the surrender of six guerrilla groups between 1989 and 1994, but there is currently little prospect of reviving the peace process. There are in any case doubts that any peace deal will result in the surrender of all guerrillas. A hard core may continue fighting, and some may surrender only to resort to violent crime.</P>
<P>The economy</P>
<P>The political crisis will inevitably reduce the confidence of business and investors, but its full impact on the economy cannot yet be quantified. For several years the economy has performed surprisingly* well, reflecting sound fiscal policy. Colombia's wealth of natural resources, the entrepreneurial spirit of its citizens and to a certain (usually overstated) extent the profits from the illegal drug trade. GDP growth reached an estimated 5% in 1995.</P>
<P>In the longer term, the government is planning action to limit the impact on the currency (and therefore on exports) from the anticipated major surge in oil earnings as new fields enter full production by creating an offshore fund which could contribute to social spending. Oil and coffee are the main export earners, but the economy is reasonably well diversified. Manufacturing and agriculture are important sectors, with bananas, cut flowers, rice and sugar the main export crops after coffee.</P>
<P>Economic development is hampered by endemic political and criminal violence, particularly in rural areas.  Labour protests and strikes are common, but rarely prompt serious unrest.  </P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Guerrilla violence</P>
<P>Guerrilla violence affects much of the country, but does not seriously threaten the state.  The Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (FARC) and National Liberation Army (ELN) work together under the Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Co-ordination (CGSB) banner, staging attacks on the security forces and economic targets nationwide. CGSB activities in rural areas can seriously hamper the operating environment for business and present a risk to personnel and property. CGSB groups do not always attack foreign and domestic business interests directly, but may seek to extort money from them.</P>
<P>The extractive sector (oil/gas and mining industries) is a principal guerrilla target. For example, there have been nearly 400 guerrilla attacks on the Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline since it began operating in 1985. The attacks have caused the spillage of tens of thousands of barrels of oil. ELN in particular is opposed to foreign involvement in the exploitation of Colombian natural resources - even forestry operations have been attacked. Companies operating in these sectors are at high risk of extortion, backed up by threats or attack. Compliance with extortion demands incurs government sanctions and is no guarantee of safety.</P>
<P>The security forces are unable to guarantee security in all areas. In rural areas in particular, guerrilla attacks frequently distract the army. Substantial areas of remote countryside are unsafe for unescorted travel because of banditry, the presence of guerrillas, the activities of the drug trade, or a combination of these factors.</P>
<P>Urban areas</P>
<P>The CGSB is traditionally weak in urban areas, where the security forces have kept it in check. But guerrillas are seeking to increase their strength in main cities, and have set up urban militias in poorer areas. Occasional urban bombings generally take the form of low-level, night-time attacks against banks and attacks on the security forces. High-profile foreign business premises have been bombed in the past and remain potential guerrilla targets. </P>
<P>Ultra-rightist paramilitaries</P>
<P>Paramilitary groups, which are illegal, do not usually threaten foreign business. But their violent vigilante activities erode law and order and worsen the overall environment for foreign business. Paramilitaries could engage in criminal activity, such as drug-trafficking, kidnapping and extortion.</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Violent crime is a serious hazard, especially in cities. Foreigners are prime targets for robbery, burglary, car theft and extortion by armed criminals, as they are considered wealthy and are ignorant of local threats. The risk from crime can be reduced significantly by taking precautions.</P>
<P>Violent settlement of personal disputes is common: National Police statistics released in February 1996 indicated that violent crime increased in 1995, with 25,330 registered homicides, most of which will have been bar-room fights and settling of scores rather than politically-motivated violence. Many crimes go unpunished. Police reported that 97% of homicides in Medellin were unresolved in 1995. Most statistics are conservative estimates. Most of the victims of crime are Colombians.</P>
<P>Kidnapping</P>
<P>Colombia has one of the highest kidnap rates in the world. Colombians constitute the vast majority of kidnap victims. The police reported that 1,158 people were kidnapped in 1995 (623 by criminals, 535 by guerrillas); at least 111 of the victims were killed. Many kidnaps are not reported.</P>
<P>The CGSB carries out approximately 60% of all kidnaps. CGSB's main motive is financial but, by seizing foreigners, CGSB raises its profile internationally and embarrasses the Colombian government in front of foreign administrations. This puts pressure on the Colombian government to assist in the recovery of their citizens. More than 90 foreigners have been kidnap victims in the past three years, including Danish, German, French, British, Japanese, Brazilian, Italian, Swedish and North American nationals. Most foreign kidnap victims are expatriates working in rural areas. Expatriates working on rural projects, particularly in the extractive sectors, face significant risks. The risk in urban areas is lower, but precautions are still necessary.</P>
<P>Anti-kidnap law</P>
<P>The Supreme Court ruled in November 1993 that key elements of stiffer anti-kidnap legislation introduced in January 1993 were unconstitutional. This has effectively prevented implementation of the new law, which sought to impede ransom payments. However, government anti-kidnap 'czar' Alberto Villamizar, the first person appointed to this co-ordinating role, is expected to introduce new initiatives to combat kidnapping. In the meantime, there is a degree of confusion governing government policy in this area. </P>
<P>The drug mafia</P>
<P>Colombia's multibillion-dollar cocaine trade presents a potential source of considerable violence, as does the newer heroin trade. Drug-trafficking is a concern for business mainly because it erodes law and order and distracts the security forces and judiciary from concentrating on the guerrilla insurgency and crime. The pervasive nature of the drug trade means that it is necessary to vet possible joint venture partners and new employees. In addition, strict  - and transparent - accounting methods are vital in case they are subject to review by the authorities within Colombia or abroad. </P>
<P>The Medell¡n cartel in the late 1980s and early 1990s used indiscriminate terrorism to protect its interests from government action. In December 1993 the security forces killed cartel leader Pablo Escobar, and other  Medell¡n cartel traffickers who did not take advantage of a government surrender offer were arrested or killed. Under US pressure, the government then turned its attention to the other main cartel, based in Cali. Virtually the entire Cali cartel leadership surrendered or was captured during a government clampdown in early to mid-1995.</P>
<P>Smaller drug mafias and the CGSB will keep trafficking levels high. The CGSB guards drug crops, taxes the drug mafia's operations and produces, transports and exports cocaine. Drug crop cultivation is concentrated in the Llanos, particularly the southern Llanos, and in the central and southern departments of Meta, Vichada, Guiania, Guaviare, Putumayo, Caqueta, Huila, Tolima, Valle and Cauca. Drug crops also are grown in the Sierra Madre mountain range along the north coast. </P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>Foreign companies have operated in Colombia for many years and have established mechanisms to work profitably despite the security risks: advantages include low political risks and an expanding economy. The government favours foreign business and promotes it through the Invest in Colombia Corporation (Coinvertir) organisation. The government is liberalising the rules for foreign oil and gas companies. Foreign investment is again rising, particularly in the hydrocarbons and manufacturing sectors. Political uncertainties created by the crisis over Samper do not directly affect foreign business. </P>
<P>Most ordinary Colombians welcome responsible foreign companies, but foreign business must be sensitive to local political concerns, including the environment. Insensitive behaviour can sour local relations and, in extreme cases, prompt violent (possibly CGSB) retaliation.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - Bolivia</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>Democratic rule</P>
<P>Bolivia is essentially stable. Democratic rule is now firmly established following the peaceful transition to a third elected government in August 1993, notwithstanding the government's declaration of a state of siege in mid-April 1995 in response to a spate of labour unrest (see below). Military intervention has in the past frequently interrupted civilian democratic rule, but the military options were exhausted by the early 1980s. Congress confirmed Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the candidate of the centre-rightist Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR), as president on 4 August 1993. He secured a coalition government dominated by the MNR, with the populist Civic Solidarity Union (UCS) and the smaller leftist Free Bolivia Movement (MBL) playing minor roles.</P>
<P>Economic policy</P>
<P>The government's economic policy is both anti-inflationary and favourable to foreign business. It includes plans for the total or partial privatisation of state-owned companies. The government (and most of the opposition) regards privatisation as essential to secure much-needed capital and to retain Bolivia's international credibility. But complete privatisation of certain key industries remains a politically emotive issue.</P>
<P>Therefore, Sanchez de Lozada on 31 January 1994 announced plans for a 'capitalisation' - rather than privatisation - programme, for the partial sell-off of six of Bolivia's key industries. A number of smaller companies are being fully privatised: during 1995, the government raised $70m through the sale of 28 small state concerns.</P>
<P>The capitalisation programme, which relies on substantial investment by the private sector in the companies concerned, is a compromise. It aims to increase private investment without completely yielding state control (though private investors will have managerial control). The government may offer 50% of the equity for no payment to private concerns which demonstrate an intent to make (previously-agreed) investments in the firms concerned. No restrictions will be placed on foreign investors. In a bid to win public support for the programme, the remaining 50% of shares will be divided among Bolivia's 3.2m citizens over 18 in the form of small pensions - a considerable boost in a country lacking even basic social security provisions. The pension funds also are meant to galvanise Bolivia's capital markets. Investors will be pleased to see that companies will be transferred free of debt and environmental and labour obligations.</P>
<P>Despite a series of technical and administrative delays which considerably slowed the process, the government during 1995 achieved the capitalisation of the national electricity company ENDE, the telecoms firm ENTEL, the LAB national airline and the ENFE state railway company. This process attracted total investment of more than $800m. The remaining two sectors to be capitalised - the oil and gas monopoly YPFB and the tin and antimony smelting company EMV (commonly referred to as Vinto) - are considered the jewels in the national crown.</P>
<P>The government expects to complete the YPFB and Vinto capitalisations by mid-1996. To meet this deadline, it will need to overcome the opposition of trade unions, civic organisations and political parties averse to relinquishing control of these key industries to foreign investors.</P>
<P>The Bolivian Workers' Central (COB) labour federation has consistently opposed privatisations, which it fears will result in job losses and poorer employment conditions. Its campaign of opposition to the government's economic policy disrupted the public sector and led to the declaration of a state of siege in mid-April 1995. This is a reasonably common step for Bolivian governments to take and the imposition did not lead to a major crackdown, though protests were banned and union leaders arrested. The COB can offer no serious alternatives to the government's neo-liberal economic policy and it will not make the government change tack. COB strength has been in decline since thousands of state-employed miners were laid off in the mid-1980s. Furthermore, oil workers' support for the COB's stance has dwindled. The government appears to have eased oil workers' concerns over the sale of YPFB through a targeted public relations campaign which has stressed the need for foreign investment to secure the sector's long-term profitability. COB members may become more receptive to change if they become persuaded that capitalisation initiatives will lead to new employment opportunities.</P>
<P>Gas pipeline scheme</P>
<P>Development of Bolivia's promising gas fields provides the government with some cheer. Construction of a 2,200km-long pipeline to link Bolivian gas fields to the major energy market in the Brazilian industrial heartland in and around Sao Paulo is to begin in mid-1996. The project should earn Bolivia $200m a year when it begins to carry gas.</P>
<P>YPFB and the Brazilian state oil company Petrobras have already established strategic alliances with foreign companies which will provide the main private sector input. YPFB has allied with Enron Corporation of the US to construct its half of the pipeline, while Petrobras has chosen a consortium comprising British Gas, Tenneco Gas and BHP Power as partners for its end of the project.</P>
<P>Bolivia also plans to continue selling gas to Argentina and to establish new links to Chile and Paraguay.</P>
<P>Outlet to the sea</P>
<P>A Friendship, Co-operation and Integration Agreement signed by then President Jaime Paz Zamora and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori in January 1992 gained Bolivia unhindered access to the Pacific. The treaty gives Bolivia access to two free zones at the Pacific port of Ilo, as well as guaranteed free transit of imports and exports along a corridor to the Peruvian border town of Desaguadero. In return, Peru receives free access to the River Plate basin and then on to the Atlantic Ocean. Bolivia already has free-zone outlets both to the Pacific and to the Atlantic: three in Chile, two in Brazil, and one each in Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay. The new option in Peru reduces dependency on Chile and relieves tensions between Bolivia and Chile. (Bolivia lost a Pacific outlet in a war with Chile in 1879: its demands for the return of this land still sour relations between the two countries and explain the continued existence of the Bolivian navy.) </P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Labour unrest</P>
<P>The main concern for foreign business is the disruption caused by protests against economic stringency. The COB has a history of calling frequent strikes and labour protests to register opposition to government economic policy, particularly privatisation plans. Such action rarely causes lasting disruption. Companies investing in certain sectors (particularly mining) face the prospect of labour protests, including occupations of sites. But union members are starting to realise that their jobs may become more secure through the injection of new capital; they may stop opposing government initiatives if given adequate guarantees.</P>
<P>Rural unrest</P>
<P>Peasant union strength has grown, largely in reaction to official coca-eradication programmes. Rural unrest can result in land seizures and blockades. This led to clashes with anti-narcotics police and government officials on several occasions in 1995. For this reason, foreign business operating in the eastern coca-growing region is at higher risk than businesses elsewhere.</P>
<P>Terrorism</P>
<P>Despite its turbulent political history, Bolivia has remained largely free of ultra-leftist terrorism. The risk posed by several ultra-leftist groups which emerged in the late 1980s-early 1990s has decreased as a result of police crackdowns and lack of public support.</P>
<P>The security forces have long been wary of a spill-over of Peru's leftist insurgencies. The kidnap on 2 November 1995 of prominent local businessman Samuel Doria Medina was the work of the Peruvian ultra-leftist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). Doria Medina was released on 17 December: the local media speculated that a ransom worth millions of dollars may have been paid to secure his release. The kidnap shocked Bolivians: it was the first crime of its kind since June 1990. It raised fears that the MRTA could stage further kidnaps of wealthy locals to fund an escalation of its activities in Peru. However, MRTA's attempts to make a comeback in Peru have been dealt a serious blow since the Doria Medina kidnap. In November-December 1995, Peruvian police arrested a group of MRTA activists -including its second-in-command Miguel Rincon Rincon - and foiled a plot to storm Congress and seize leading legislators. In Bolivia, the security forces conducted a major search operation after Doria Medina was freed which resulted in the arrest of several alleged MRTA activists. The government claims to have dismantled MRTA operations in Bolivia. This may be over-optimistic, but it has eased fears that the MRTA could stage further kidnaps of wealthy locals in the near future.</P>
<P>Anti-US sentiment, whipped up from time to time among students, workers and peasants, does not put foreign business in La Paz at direct risk.</P>
<P>The cocaine trade</P>
<P>Bolivia is the world's second-largest producer of coca leaf (Peru is the largest producer). The cocaine trade, valued at an estimated $3.6bn each year, is a prime source of income for many peasants in the eastern lowlands. For example, displaced miners have taken up coca leaf cultivation. It is not illegal to grow coca provided that the leaves are used for traditional purposes: chewing and in coca leaf tea. Growing coca for 'surplus' uses (ie for sale to drug-traffickers) is illegal. The authorities must cut the amount of land used to cultivate coca in order to qualify for much-needed US aid (which is pegged to specific eradication targets each year). Peasant organisations have tried to co-operate with  eradication programmes, but they encourage peasants to resume open cultivation of coca if they believe that the government is not providing sufficient help to develop alternative crops. Moreover, peasant organisations resist forcible crop eradication: this prompts isolated, but sometimes fatal, clashes between coca-growers and the police.</P>
<P>US pressure obliges Bolivian anti-narcotics forces to co-operate with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in combatting drug-trafficking. Repressive tactics are reserved for drug-traffickers and those involved in cocaine-refining operations, which have sprung up since 1990 with the spread of Colombian drug mafia operations to neighbouring countries. A special armed forces unit, FELCN, provides logistical support to the UMOPAR anti-narcotics police. Anti-narcotics operations have been stepped up under the current administration and a comprehensive extradition treaty with the US entered the final stages of negotiation in early 1996. Although extradition proved a contentious issue when it was first suggested, it has not so far stirred up major controversy. However, this could change, particularly if the US government decides to phase out its economic aid to Bolivia (outgoing US Ambassador Andres Petricevic suggested in October 1995 that this might happen). The government insists that US economic assistance must continue if agreed anti-narcotics targets are to be achieved.</P>
<P>In coca-growing areas, such as Chapare (Cochabamba) and Beni and Santa Cruz provinces, local opposition to DEA assistance in eradicating coca production gives rise to strong anti-US sentiment. Anti-US feeling in coca-growing areas could be translated into violence against US business concerns as well as official US interests. US oil companies in Santa Cruz department reinforced security in early 1993 after an anonymous threat from a presumed drug-trafficker in retaliation for US anti-narcotics operations locally. (No attacks took place.) The risk of anti-US attacks will increase if an extradition treaty results in the arrest and extradition of sizeable numbers of Bolivians; this is unlikely to happen, at least in the short term.</P>
<P>The drug mafia</P>
<P>President Sanchez de Lozada in January 1996 expressed the fear that Bolivia could in the future experience Colombian-style drug-related violence. Sanchez de Lozada earlier warned that drug-traffickers in El Chapare had become heavily armed and could form cartels, or even become 'narco-guerrillas'. We believe that drug-related violence is likely to remain confined to Bolivia's eastern coca-growing areas and that even in these areas there is little risk that drug-related violence will reach levels comparable with those in Colombia.</P>
<P>A number of factors will prevent the 'Colombianisation' of the drug trade in Bolivia. It is significant that the Bolivian drug trade does not impinge on the main business centres as much as it does in Colombia; violent crime related to drug-trafficking is usually restricted to rural areas. Drug trade money is laundered through Bolivian businesses, particularly in the eastern commercial centre of Santa Cruz, but intimidation of local and foreign business by drug dealers is rare outside coca-growing areas.</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Levels of crime are relatively low compared with other countries in the region. In  Andean areas, the Aymara and Quechua peoples observe strong ethical standards and crime is socially unacceptable. However, these standards have tended to drop when Amerindians move into cities and their  traditions are abandoned. There appears to be a clear link between poverty and crime.</P>
<P>Overall, the level of violent crime remains low (though the risk is higher in areas of Beni and Cochabamba which are frequented by drug-traffickers). Petty crime such as pickpocketing is prevalent in main cities, for example, El Alto municipality adjacent to La Paz, but more serious crimes, such as kidnapping, are rare.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>The government favours foreign participation in most sectors of the economy. Foreign companies are being encouraged to acquire full or part interests in state-owned companies (depending on the sector concerned). But workforce resistance to foreign involvement in traditionally militant sectors, such as mining, is often strong if the labour force fears that major down-sizing will result. As a consequence, the privatisation and liberalisation process has suffered delays, with previous administrations proceeding cautiously. President Sanchez de Lozada is proving determined to push through restructuring, but is himself now behind schedule. The terrain and climate make overland travel between major cities difficult, but air services are good.</P>

<h1>Country Profile - Argentina</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</p>
    <p>POLITICAL STABILITY</p>
    <p>Carlos Menem of the Justicialist Party (PJ or Peronists)
    was re-elected president in May 1995. Menem, who has been
    president since 1989, has established a reputation as a
    pragmatic politician who is committed to neo-liberal economic
    policies which ensure stability but require tough austerity
    measures (see below). These have hit sections of the
    population hard; poverty remains widespread and unemployment
    had exceeded 16% by the end of 1995. Nevertheless, there is
    broad acceptance of Menem's reforms and the opposition offers
    few alternatives. All serious alternatives to Menem broadly
    support the government's free market economic policies and
    welcome foreign investment.</p>
    <p>The economy</p>
    <p>Under Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's 'convertibility
    plan', the government between 1992 and 1994 restored price
    stability, brought inflation down to single figures;
    negotiated the rescheduling of foreign debt; and sustained
    economic growth. However, in 1995 recession led to record
    unemployment and a contraction of some 2.5% in GDP. Capital
    flight in the wake of the December 1994 devaluation of the
    Mexican peso helped trigger off and then exacerbate the
    recession. The government is determined to press ahead with
    austerity measures - including major cuts in state spending
    and attempts to increase tax receipts - to help resolve the
    country's economic problems. Growth is expected to resume
    gradually as the credit squeeze is relaxed; inflation is
    expected to remain low.</p>
    <p>Outstanding problems include the convertibility of the
    peso to the dollar, which causes the currency to be
    overvalued.</p>
    <p>Deal with UK on South Atlantic oil fields</p>
    <p>British and Argentinian officials in September 1995 issued
    a Joint Declaration on offshore activities in the South
    Atlantic. The understanding seeks to avoid further conflict
    between the two countries by allowing for mutually
    advantageous commercial exploitation of oil fields thought to
    exist under the South Atlantic seabed, much of it in disputed
    waters. The declaration was quickly followed by a meeting in
    New York between British Prime Minister John Major and Menem,
    the first between leaders of the two countries since the 1982
    military conflict over the Falkland Islands/Malvinas.
    Relations with the UK have more recently improved through the
    pragmatic 'umbrella' policy, under which all commercial
    relations are conducted on the understanding that they do not
    affect either side's underlying claims to the islands.</p>
    <p>Had the declaration not been agreed, companies operating
    in and around the Falklands/Malvinas ran the risk of legal
    action by Argentina, based on its claim to sovereignty over
    the islands. Joint ventures between Argentinian and other
    international oil companies are now being encouraged. The
    state oil company YPF in late 1995 announced a joint venture
    with UK's British Gas.</p>
    <p>The armed forces</p>
    <p>Relations between the civilian government and the military
    have improved significantly since the 1980s. Conscription was
    abolished in August 1994 and the government has begun to
    modernise the armed forces. The modernisation process will
    include privatising the military's extensive industrial
    holdings and streamlining its command structure.</p>
    <p>Ultra-nationalist junior officers staged four rebellions
    between 1987 and 1990. They demanded changes in the military
    high command and government economic policy, and opposed
    budget cuts and prosecutions of officers accused of human
    rights violations during the 'dirty war' of the 1970s.
    Menem's swift defeat of the last army uprising in December
    1990 strengthened his position, though a minority element
    within the military remains unhappy at playing a subordinate
    role to civilian government and would like to increase the
    prestige of the armed forces. Morale in the army is low
    because of its reduced political role and a shrinking budget.
    Dissent and indiscipline within the military will continue to
    pose problems and recalcitrant rebel leaders will continue to
    press for their demands to be met. However, serious military
    unrest is unlikely. Broad popular support for democratic
    institutions and the memory of the large-scale human rights
    abuses and financial mismanagement which took place under
    military rule prior to 1983 ensures that civilian support for
    military involvement in politics is virtually non-existent.
    Any attempt by the military to challenge civilian political
    institutions would receive scant support, and is unlikely.</p>
    <p>THREATS TO SECURITY</p>
    <p>Crime</p>
    <p>The general level of crime is lower than in most other
    Latin American countries and Argentina compares favourably to
    many European countries in this respect. But crime has
    increased in recent years. Central Buenos Aires is generally
    safe, but mugging and petty crime can occur anywhere and are
    prevalent in poorer areas of main cities. Argentina is used
    as a conduit for smuggling cocaine from Andean countries to
    Europe and drug-related violent crime is on the increase.
    Police corruption (mostly embezzlement and acceptance of
    bribes) is common.</p>
    <p>Social unrest</p>
    <p>There is a persistent threat of social unrest in the form
    of rioting and looting. Continuing discontent over economic
    difficulties has been fuelled by the Menem government's
    perseverance with IMF-style austerity measures and reforms to
    liberalise the economy. Industrial unrest can disrupt
    communications and commerce, but strikes are announced in
    advance, allowing businesses to make alternative arrangements
    if necessary. Most unrest takes place in distant provincial
    towns, where near-bankrupt state apparatuses are frequently
    the main local employer. Isolated outbursts of unrest are set
    to continue, and may escalate as the government proceeds with
    further spending cuts. However, renewed widespread unrest is
    unlikely; most Argentinians are resigned to the need for
    austerity measures and prefer these to a possible return to
    the hyperinflation of the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
    <p>Domestic terrorism</p>
    <p>Overall levels of political violence have decreased since
    the mid-1980s. There are no major domestic terrorist groups
    currently active, and business faces few threats from
    organised violence.</p>
    <p>Ultra-rightists linked to the carapintada ('painted
    faces') military rebellions of 1987-90 occasionally bomb
    union and leftist party offices, government, judicial
    targets. These actions are increasingly rare, and pose few
    threats to business operations. The main threat from ultra-
    rightist activities stems from possible links to anti-Jewish
    bombings (see below).</p>
    <p>The ultra-leftist People's Revolutionary Organisation
    (ORP), which emerged in 1992, has targeted foreign banks,
    government offices and companies scheduled for privatisation.
    It may be made up of former members of the ultra-leftist and
    nationalist Che Guevara Brigade and Eva Peron Command, which
    targeted security forces and high-profile foreign business
    until 1991. However, its capability is limited and the group
    may now be inactive: it has staged no significant attacks
    recently. It denied responsibility for a teargas attack on
    the Japanese embassy in May 1994.</p>
    <p>Various ad hoc or small local extremist groups carry out
    isolated attacks and union and political party militants
    occasionally use violent intimidation against opponents and
    journalists. However, these rarely cause injuries and pose
    few threats to business operations.</p>
    <p>International terrorism</p>
    <p>Two huge carbombings against Israeli and Jewish targets
    since 1992 have brought international terrorism to Argentina.
    In July 1994 86 people were killed in a car bomb at the
    offices of the Israeli-Argentine Mutual Association (AMIA)
    and the Argentine-Jewish Congress (DAIA) in Buenos Aires'
    traditionally Jewish Once district. Hundreds more were
    injured. A large bomb explosion in March 1992 destroyed the
    Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. That attack killed at least
    28 people and injured more than 250.</p>
    <p>Middle East-linked radicals (possibly terrorists from the
    pro-Iranian Lebanon-based radical Shia Muslim organisation
    Hezbollah) are presumed responsible for both attacks, but it
    is still unclear whether they were carried out with the
    co-operation of local pro-Palestinian extremists. A series of
    fresh arrests in December 1995 in connection with
    investigations into the bombings included ten army officers
    suspected of supplying explosives for the AMIA/DAIA attack.
    However, it has been impossible to draw any firm conclusion
    from these arrests. There have been many highly-publicised
    arrests during the investigations, but only one suspect - who
    is accused of supplying the vehicle used in the AMIA/DAIA
    attack - has been formally charged.</p>
    <p>There is a risk that transnational terrorists could stage
    further attacks in Argentina. Argentina's heightened
    international profile under Menem, in particular its
    involvement in Middle Eastern affairs, contributes to this
    risk. Argentina's large Jewish and Arab populations
    (Argentina has the largest Jewish community in the Americas
    outside the US) and less stringent security than in Europe
    (where Middle East-based terrorists have carried out
    occasional spectacular attacks) are further attractions for
    international terrorists. Any further incidents would most
    likely target Jewish interests or symbols of the Israeli
    state. The authorities have stepped up security at buildings
    with public access, particularly Jewish- and Israeli-linked
    premises, as well as ports and airports in the wake of the
    two attacks, but local Jewish groups are angered at the
    inconclusive nature of the investigations into the bombings.
    Hoax bomb threats occasionally force the evacuation of
    government offices, shops and other business premises in
    Buenos Aires.</p>
    <p>Kidnaps</p>
    <p>Occasional kidnaps are the work of criminal gangs and
    target local businessmen and their families. Foreign
    executives are extremely unlikely to be kidnapped.</p>
    <p>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</p>
    <p>The government's attitude towards foreign business is
    favourable; Menem has abandoned Argentina's traditionally
    confrontational attitude towards the international financial
    community in a bid to secure further loans. Foreign
    investment is sought in the privatisation of certain state
    industries. Measures have been introduced to encourage
    investment by eliminating some of the minor taxes and duties
    - known as the 'Argentinian cost' - and simplifying others.</p>
    <p>There has been a greater focus on corruption in business,
    which is expected to decline, not least because of the extra
    publicity. But a favourable operating climate for foreign
    business depends largely on the economy; if this falters,
    then high unemployment and poverty will lead to increased
    outbreaks of unrest.</p>

<H1>Country Profile - Egypt</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>The regime</P>
<P>President Hosni Mubarak's military-backed regime is well-established and accepted - if not liked - by the majority of Egyptians. The regime relies on patronage and a network of supporters in key positions, an environment that encourages corruption. The ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) represents the closely-knit elite of senior military officers, technocrats and professionals.</P>
<P>However, Mubarak's regime suffers from a lack of legitimacy. Its persistent refusal to allow genuine democratic reforms has frustrated and alienated many people, and only 27% of eligible voters are registered. Although many of the regime's members are devout Muslims, they espouse modern, moderate socialist ideas and increasingly support free market policies. Kamal Ganzouri, a career technocrat, replaced Atef Sidki as prime minister in January 1996.</P>
<P>Opposition</P>
<P>Disaffection with the government is manifested mainly as apathy. The Muslim Brotherhood (MB) is increasingly seen as the only viable vehicle of opposition. The MB is banned from standing in elections, but in recent years has extended its influence into Egyptian institutions such as professional associations, the media and the education system. As support for the MB grows, the regime has adopted some of the leadership's agenda. At the same time it is clamping down on grassroots activists, claiming that they support the Islamic extremist fringe.</P>
<P>Economic restructuring</P>
<P>In 1990 Egypt embarked an IMF-inspired reform programme, including privatisation, deficit reduction and trade and banking liberalisation. However, by mid-1995 just three of several hundred public companies had been sold outright, though shares had been offered for sale in another ten. The government is proceeding slowly for fear that sell-offs will increase unemployment and eventually spark off a new wave of social unrest (the last occurred in 1986). The opposition - particularly the strengthened MB - is quick to exploit tensions.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Islamic extremism</P>
<P>Modern Egyptian Islamic extremism combines two traditions: the radicalism developed by the MB from the 1930s to the 1970s, and the clan-based crime and vendetta culture long established in southern Middle Egypt (the four Nile governorates of Minya, Asyut, Sohag and Qena). The most active groups are Jamaat Islamia (JI - the Islamic Groups) and New Jihad, an incarnation of Jihad (Holy War). A cyclical pattern of violence was established in southern Middle Egypt in the 1970s, with the most recent period starting in March 1992. By late 1995 nearly 900 people (mainly members of the security forces) had been killed, the majority in southern Middle Egypt.</P>
<P>Although JI has established footholds in Cairo and Alexandria through migration, it remains strongest in southern Middle Egypt. It is particularly well-supported in towns with high unemployment and a relatively high Christian minority population (Dayrut, Asyut, Faiyum, Qena, Minya and Mallawi), and also in rural areas. Repeated clampdowns resulted in a 30% fall in political violence in 1994, forcing JI to leave its traditional stronghold of Asyut and concentrate its activities in and around the town of Mallawi (Minya governorate), though there are occasional flare-ups elsewhere in southern Middle Egypt. The regime has not resolved the problem, and its repressive tactics will ensure a steady stream of recruits to JI.</P>
<P>Both JI and Jihad occasionally try to assassinate state officials. JI claimed responsibility for a failed assassination attempt against Mubarak in June 1995 in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia).</P>
<P>Jihad activists infiltrate the armed forces: the group tried unsuccessfully to kill Interior Minister Hassan al-Alfi in Cairo in August 1994, and has reportedly plotted to assassinate Mubarak.</P>
<P>Attacks on the tourist trade</P>
<P>Southern Middle Egypt has been the focus of JI's sporadic terrorist campaign against the tourist trade. The campaign aims to retaliate for security clampdowns and to step up pressure on the regime. By late 1995 JI had killed 12 foreigners and injured more than 50 in periodic attacks against tour buses, Nile cruise boats and trains. The campaign occasionally affects other areas: a bomb exploded in Luxor in June 1992; tour buses were fired on and bombs exploded in public places in Cairo in 1993-94; and a German tourist was killed and another injured in September 1994 in the popular Red Sea resort of Hurghada. After an eight-month lull, extremists in November 1995 fired on two trains within two days near Nag Hammadi.</P>
<P>JI embarked on a campaign designed to terrorise foreign business in Cairo in early 1994, but this was largely unsuccessful. After warning all foreigners to leave, it singled out ten Egyptian and foreign banks in the city between February and April 1994 for small bombings. The attacks were designed to cause minimal injury and damage.</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Crime rates are low by Western standards, but petty theft is a problem in Cairo.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>The regime is committed to increasing foreign investment in all sectors of the economy, and is privatising many state-owned concerns. However, the foreign business community is frustrated by the slow pace of reform and the regime's refusal to devalue the Egyptian pound. Widespread bureaucratic corruption is another irritant.</P>
<P>The Islamic extremist threat is inhibiting further growth in the tourist industry, which is Egypt's chief source of foreign currency with more than $1bn-worth of foreign investment planned. Apart from its Cairo campaign in 1994, Islamic extremists have not targeted foreign business, despite repeated threats to do so. Any future attacks are likely to be small-scale. </P>

<H1>Country Profile - Libya</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>Col Gadhafi</P>
<P>Col Muammar Gadhafi has ruled almost single-handedly since a military coup brought him to power in 1969. He has evolved a unique mix of tribalism, socialism and Islamism, but relies on a centralised police state that brutally represses all anti-regime and pro-democracy sentiment. The elite Republican Guard, commanded by Brig Abd al-Qasim al-Ganga, is the key prop of Gadhafi's regime. With few exceptions, members of Gadhafi's own Qadhadifa tribe hold the most important bureaucratic positions. The closely-controlled parliament (General People's Congress (GPC)) and local councils (Basic People's Congresses (BPCs)) exercise mass political mobilisation. </P>
<P>Internal opposition</P>
<P>Despite Gadhafi's efforts in the 1970s, Libya remains a highly tribalised country. The concentration of power in the hands of the Qadhadifa has alienated the powerful Warfalla and Megarha tribes. In the most recent of eight coup attempts, the security forces savagely repressed a ten-day mutiny by 2,000 soldiers from the Warfalla tribe in October 1993. The rebels aimed to establish a more moderate system of government: their grievances may also have been linked to economic problems caused by UN sanctions (see below). In the following year, Gadhafi eased out the last surviving members of the original clique of officers who participated in the 1969 coup. In February 1994 he sought to undermine the opposition by granting the Republican Guard greater powers to mete out 'Islamic' punishments to clamp down on potential dissidents. Despite years of repression, Islamist groups are active throughout northern coastal towns, particularly Benghazi. </P>
<P>UN sanctions</P>
<P>UN sanctions, imposed in April 1992 and extended in December 1993, have been unsuccessful in securing Libyan co-operation with Western investigations into aviation terrorism. Hydrocarbons revenues, which accounted for 95% of hard currency earnings in 1992-93, are unaffected. The extended sanctions include: </P>
<P>- a freeze on Libyan assets abroad, including investments, stocks and dividends. Funds derived from oil, gas, petroleum products or agricultural products are excluded; </P>
<P>- a ban on the sale of specified oil-related equipment for refineries and for transporting oil, and on the supply of aircraft or aviation components or of aircraft engineering and maintenance services; </P>
<P>- the closure of Libyan airline offices in UN member states. </P>
<P>UN members have been obliged to sever air links with Libya, halt sales of arms, aircraft and aircraft parts, and reduce staffing levels at their embassies in Tripoli since April 1992. However, Italian and German opposition prevented the imposition of a total oil embargo, and the sanctions are frequently broken using routes through Tunisia and Malta. </P>
<P>The measures aim to secure the extradition to the US or the UK of two Libyans allegedly involved in the bombing of a US Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie (UK) in December 1988; to ensure Libyan co-operation with a French investigation into the bombing of a French UTA airliner over Niger in September 1989; and to secure French access to a Libyan-based Palestinian terrorist suspect. Gadhafi has repeatedly reneged on pledges to co-operate while trying to appear conciliatory. However, reliable sources have cast doubts on Libya's sole responsibility for the incidents.</P>
<P>Sanctions have not greatly affected the operating environment for foreign business. Transport has been disrupted, and internal flights by the national carrier have been reduced due to the lack of aircraft parts. The regime occasionally closes its borders temporarily to protest against the measures. Sanctions have delayed a much-needed overhaul of the oil sector. The nationalisation of most oil companies in the early 1980s, the slow pace of oil exploration, and poor oilfield management have all contributed to the precarious state of the industry, though several west European and Asian firms stepped up involvement in 1993-94. Sanctions have also forced the regime to halt its economic liberalisation programme introduced in 1987, pushed up inflation and unemployment and lowered the living standards of many Libyans. </P>
<P>Libya's relations with Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia have deteriorated, particularly after Algeria hosted a conference for Libyan dissident groups in October 1993. Uncharacteristically, Libya bowed to international pressure in June 1994 by withdrawing from the 42,000 sq m (100,000 sq km) of northern Chad known as the Aouzou Strip, which it had occupied since 1973.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>The regime</P>
<P>Regime-sponsored actions pose the only significant threat to foreign interests: demonstrators ransacked the Venezuelan embassy and protested outside the Austrian, Belgian (which looks after US interests), French, Hungarian and Russian embassies during officially-organised protests in April 1992. The regime arbitrarily detained foreign nationals in the mid-1980s to exert pressure on their governments (see POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS). In September 1994 the authorities seized a Greek ship in Tripoli on the dubious grounds that it contravened Libya's boycott of Israel (the ship had been built for an Israeli company).</P>
<P>Islamic activists</P>
<P>Domestic opposition outside the military is confined to Islamic activism. Since the imposition of sanctions in 1992, Islamist groups have exploited growing public resentment at unemployment to denounce the regime. By 1995 the Islamists had formed an alliance with the fundamentalist Senoussi sect, particularly strong in the Benghazi/Al-Bayda area. </P>
<P>Between July and September 1995 Islamist groups were involved in a series of clashes with the security forces in Benghazi and other north-eastern towns, resulting in more than 20 deaths. In October militants assassinated a senior intelligence officer in Benghazi. However, Islamist organisations will not pose a serious challenge to the regime unless they win the army's support, and this is unlikely. Disturbances tend to occur in main towns of the north-east, not in rural oil- and gas-producing areas.</P>
<P>Dissidents</P>
<P>Domestic- and foreign-based dissident groups pose a minor threat to the regime, but do not target foreign business. Dissident elements have reportedly been behind sporadic anti-regime demonstrations in Tripoli and Benghazi since August 1992, and may also target state symbols. Unidentified gunmen ambushed and killed three policemen near Benghazi in January 1993. </P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Although low by Western standards, crime levels have risen since the early 1990s. Criminal attacks against foreigners are increasing. Criminals in December 1994 shot and killed a German tourist in Sebha province. In April 1994 a German couple were clubbed to death in Sirte, apparently during a robbery. Foreign men are treated courteously, but women are sometimes molested, particularly if they violate Islamic conventions of dress or behaviour. Security officials often confiscate cameras from foreign nationals, claiming that they pose a threat to security.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>UN sanctions have made business conditions in Libya difficult: transport is time-consuming; there is a shortage of hard currency for foreign exchange; communications are unreliable and subject to surveillance; and operating costs are rising.</P>
<P>However, the regime's efforts - so far mostly unsuccessful - to improve its international image and attract increased foreign investment are presenting foreign companies with new opportunities, particularly in the oil and gas sectors. The regime appears to have abandoned its habit, occasionally used in the 1980s, of arbitrarily detaining expatriates to exert pressure on their governments. </P>

<H1>Country Profile - Algeria</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>Political crisis</P>
<P>Algeria is suffering from a major political, security and economic crisis. Up to 50,000 people may have been killed between February 1992 and December 1995. The crisis began in October 1988 with nationwide riots against 30 years of authoritarian rule. In a bid to prevent the military-backed elite that had ruled the country since 1962 from losing power, President Chadli Bendjedid embarked on an ambitious programme of democratisation in 1989-90. However, the regime's political mouthpiece, the National Liberation Front (FLN), was beaten in multiparty local and provincial elections in June 1990 by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS).</P>
<P>Despite warnings from the military, Algeria's first-ever open parliamentary elections went ahead in December 1991. In the first round, the FIS took 80% of the seats won outright. Fearing that a FIS government would compromise Algeria's secular nature, the military conclave persuaded Chadli to resign, replaced him with a military-dominated and unconstitutional Higher State Committee (HCE) and granted the army wide-ranging powers over internal security under a nationwide state of siege (emergency). It cancelled the second round of elections and banned the FIS in March 1992.</P>
<P>The appointment of retired general Lamine Zeroual as president in January 1994 began to turn the situation around. Zeroual has managed to retain the confidence of the military conclave, as well as winning the trust of the FIS leadership. Zeroual held three rounds of talks with jailed FIS leaders Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj in April 1994, August 1994 and July 1995, with each one coming closer to securing agreement from hardliners within the military and the FIS. In November 1995 Zeroual's gamble of holding a multiparty presidential election paid off, when he won 61% of votes in a respectable 75% turnout.</P>
<P>Although the election gave the regime legitimacy for the first time, two key issues remain unresolved. The immediate question is whether the regime should relegalise the FIS, while the more vital, underlying question involves the religious content of the constitution. Despite his military background, Zeroual represents the majority view, that the constitution should be a mixture of conservative Islam and Western modernism. Few Algerians support either the secularist or Islamist extremists.</P>
<P>The economy</P>
<P>Algeria's economy is beginning to emerge from a decade of crisis. Although inflation and unemployment remain high, in 1995 the government managed to secure major debt rescheduling agreements with sovereign and commercial lenders. The regime is keen to increase earnings from the hydrocarbons sector, where more than 30 companies have signed exploration agreements with the state hydrocarbons corporation Sonatrach.</P>
<P>International relations</P>
<P>In an attempt to secure EU aid, Zeroual is trying to improve relations with EU states damaged by the interruption of the democratisation process. Ties with the US and Japan remain good. The regime's ambiguous stance towards the Sahrawi separatist organisation Polisario, whose camps are situated in south-west Algeria, damages relations with its Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) partner Morocco. Libya began openly to support the FIS after Algeria hosted a conference of Libyan opposition figures in 1993.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY </P>
<P>Islamic extremists</P>
<P>There are up to 650 terrorist cells active across northern Algeria, owing nominal allegiance to either of two 'coalitions' - the Armed Islamic Groups (GIA) or the official armed wing of the FIS, the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS). The AIS wants to force the regime to relegalise the FIS; the GIA believes - misguidedly - that it will be able to overthrow the regime by force. Although the two groups united in May 1994, they split again in July 1995.</P>
<P>The best-organised cells have sophisticated command structures and modern telecommunications and computer equipment, and are well armed. Some rural groups operate with up to 100 men, though the urban cells are usually smaller. Rural guerrillas stage frequent hit-and-run attacks in towns and cities near their base areas. The worst-affected areas are: the north-west (Tlemcen to Sidi Bel Abbes); the Chlef-Relizane-Tiaret area; the Blida-Medea-Boumerdes-Tizi Ouzou area; the Batna-Mila-Djidjel area; south of Annaba; Djelfa; Laghouat and el-Oued.</P>
<P>AIS members are generally drawn from the FIS, while GIA militants tend to be former fighters in the Afghanistan war. The AIS kills members of the security forces and government officials, and sabotages infrastructure such as utilities and state-run factories. The GIA goes further and also assassinates those whom it perceives to be supporters of the regime: secular politicians, intellectuals, civil servants, journalists, Berbers and unveiled women (even schoolgirls). In August 1994 the GIA threatened to 'punish' any student or teacher attending state educational establishments. Extremists have infiltrated the security forces; attackers are frequently dressed in security force uniforms and sometimes drive police vehicles. Extremists mount 'faux barrages' (fake checkpoints) in rural areas to trap and kill their victims.</P>
<P>Urban terrorism</P>
<P>The security forces began to make advances against the AIS and GIA in late 1994 and throughout 1995. This forced extremists to take refuge in the cities, particularly Algiers, where they have stepped up carbombings: these include occasional presumed suicide attacks. The worst carbombing killed 42 people in central Algiers in January 1995. Blida and Boufarik also are particularly affected by carbombings. A curfew has been force in Algiers and nine surrounding provinces since December 1992.</P>
<P>Attacks on foreigners</P>
<P>Islamic extremists began in September 1993 to target foreign nationals in a bid to frighten away foreign companies and further damage the economy. Extremists had killed almost 110 foreigners by December 1995. The GIA has emerged as the predominant threat to foreigners, and has issued numerous deadlines for foreigners to leave Algeria or face death.</P>
<P>Victims have included short- as well as long-term expatriates, journalists, diplomats, sailors and religious workers. Attacks have occurred most frequently in Greater Algiers and in the Blida Atlas regions, though extremists have also struck in the Oran/Sidi Bel Abbes area, Djidjel and the northern Sahara. The worst single incident took place in December 1993, when some 50 GIA guerrillas stabbed to death 12 Croatian technicians near the Blida Atlas town of Tamezguida.</P>
<P>Extremists began to target the hydrocarbons sector in July 1994 with the murder in an Algiers suburb of five east Europeans working for the state oil company Sonatrach. In May 1995, guerrillas raided a pipeline installation in Ghardaia, killing five foreigners. In October 1994 guerrillas raided an oil rig at Negrine, on the northern margins of the Sahara, killing two west European engineers. The attackers are likely to have been acting on inside information. Although the authorities have imposed 'exclusion zones' around other hydrocarbons centres in the central and southern Sahara such as Hassi Messaoud, stringent security should be maintained.</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Armed robbery is a growing problem in Greater Algiers. Car break-ins and theft of car parts from parked cars and other petty crimes are increasingly common. The police are unlikely to respond to emergency calls for fear of extremist ambush, particularly in Algiers and the Blida Atlas. Tuareg insurgents operating in the southern Sahara hijacked the vehicles of two German tourists and a foreign aid organisation in August 1992. Vehicle hijacking is also a problem in and around Algiers.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>Although the regime is determined to increase the level of foreign investment following the removal in 1992 of cumbersome regulations, the security environment has forced the suspension of most new foreign investment (except in the hydrocarbons sector). However, there are signs that the election of Lamine Zeroual as president in November 1995 will lead to a slow reversal in the situation. Firms that continue to operate take maximum security precautions.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - Cote d'Ivoire</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>Cote d'Ivoire is one of West Africa's most stable countries. Several factors have contributed to this, most importantly the length of first post-independence President Felix Houphouet-Boigny's term in office. The second is the political weight of the rural agricultural community, which is still committed to the traditional hierarchical social structure, a structure mirrored in the political system. Respect for elders is paramount and, by the time of his death in 1993 at an estimated age of 94, Houphouet-Boigny was almost deified. The constitution dictated that Henri Konan Bedie, the speaker of the Assemblee Nationale (parliament), replace Houphouet-Boigny on his death.</P>
<P>The 1995 elections</P>
<P>Presidential elections in October 1995 came close to undermining Cote d'Ivoire's reputation for stability. Some 32 people were killed in election-related violence and voting was disrupted in Abidjan, Muslim areas of the north and in the opposition stronghold of Gagnoa in the cocoa-growing south-west. Election monitors left some opposition areas after they received death threats.</P>
<P>Both the presidential polls and the legislative elections in November 1995 proved controversial, though Bedie and the ruling Parti Democratique de la Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI) won landslide victories in both. A controversial electoral law introduced in 1995, which excluded former premier Alassane Ouattara from standing for president, prompted an opposition boycott of the October elections. This law and the subsequent exclusion of two key opposition figures, Front Populaire Ivoirien (FPI) leader Laurent Gbagbo and Rassemblement Democratique Republicain (RDR) leader Djeny Kobina, from the legislative polls were an unnecessary fetter to democracy; few analysts considered any opposition candidate capable of successfully challenging the PDCI political machine. In the event, the PDCI took 145 of the 175 seats in the National Assembly, though this was less that its pre-poll majority of 163. The Rassemblement des Republicains (RDR), a PDCI breakaway party, became the principal opposition, with 13 seats. The Front Populaire Ivoirien (FPI), which spearheaded the campaign for multiparty democracy in the late 1980s, won only nine seats.</P>
<P>Political tensions had eased significantly by the time municipal elections took place in February 1996. Again the PDCI won resoundingly, taking 156 out of the 196 town halls. Violence is now unlikely to recur until the country's next polls, scheduled for 2000.</P>
<P>Duncan Kablan</P>
<P>The reappointment in January 1996 of Daniel Duncan Kablan as Prime Minister was crucial for continued business confidence as he effectively led the country out of the recession of the late 1980s. A minor cabinet reshuffle followed, but key business portfolios remained unchanged, underlining Duncan's commitment to stability and continuity.</P>
<P>New divisions</P>
<P>The election campaign highlighted new divisions, which will characterise Bedie's presidential term. The campaign brought to the fore the growing divide between the Muslim opposition in the north and the Christian south, between nationalists and foreign Africans resident in Cote d'Ivoire, and between Baoule, Bete and other ethnic groups. In October 1995 attacks by the Bete (who are dominant around Gagnoa) on the migrant Baoule (of which Bedie is a member) claimed at least 14 lives and forced 2,000 Baoule to return to their villages in central Cote d'Ivoire.</P>
<P>The electoral law (which excludes candidates from standing if they cannot prove that both parents were born in Cote d'Ivoire, have renounced Ivorian nationality, or have not been resident in Cote d'Ivoire continuously for five years prior to the elections) illustrates the country's new-found xenophobia.</P>
<P>This is a potential source of tension. Immigrant communities have played an important role in the Ivorian economy since before the Second World War, when the French colonists forced the inhabitants of neighbouring countries to work in the Ivorian cocoa and coffee plantations. Houphouet-Boigny operated an open border policy out of which a relatively peaceful multi-cultural society emerged; several million foreign Africans (Mossi) have been resident in Cote d'Ivoire for generations. In 1993, almost 30% of the population was non-Ivorian and close to 4% was non-African, mostly Lebanese and French.</P>
<P>However, resentment of foreign workers, particularly those dominating the small business and informal sector, is growing. Bedie has nurtured nationalist sentiment among Ivorians, raising tensions further between different communities (see Threats to Security).</P>
<P>The economy</P>
<P>Cote d'Ivoire boasts West Africa's most significant economy after Nigeria. Between 1960 and 1980 the country's economic and social development rate was outstanding, based on cash crops for export such as cocoa (of which it is the world's largest producer), coffee, tropical woods and, more recently, cotton. However, the economy's dependence on these export commodities made it vulnerable to international markets, and Cote d'Ivoire was badly hit by depressed prices in the 1980s. This forced the economy into recession and the government into a series of Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs).</P>
<P>The role of the Franc Zone</P>
<P>Cote d'Ivoire is also the most powerful economy within the Franc Zone, which binds 13 west and central African countries together in two monetary zones. The West African Monetary Union (UEMOA) comprises Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Senegal and Togo (Guinea-Bissau is negotiating membership terms). The foundation of the system is the relationship with France, defined in a 1973 treaty: the Banque de France gives full backing to the fixed value of the zone's currency, the CFA franc, and in return the zone's central bank, the Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO), maintains at least 65% of foreign exchange reserves in French francs in an account at the French treasury. The BCEAO has representatives in member states, but operates its monetary and foreign exchange controls through the commercial banks; it also acts as the banking regulator for member states.</P>
<P>The key practical features of the Franc Zone system include:</P>
<P>- a guarantee of currency convertibility at the official rate through the banking system;</P>
<P>- the use of the same banknotes throughout the West African Franc Zone;</P>
<P>- the free movement of funds throughout the West African Franc Zone;</P>
<P>- and a ban on conversion of CFA notes outside the Zone.</P>
<P>Devaluation</P>
<P>From 1990 onwards, Cote d'Ivoire's terms of trade deteriorated to such an extent that the currency, the CFA franc, was estimated to be overvalued by as much as 60%. Prices paid to Ivorian producers far exceeded those paid to producers in competitor countries such as Malaysia and Brazil. In addition, the high value of the region's only hard currency attracted cheap manufactured goods from Asian and Pacific countries and poorly- refined petroleum from Nigeria, undermining the manufacturing sector. Persistent rumours of an impending devaluation prompted large-scale capital flight and disinvestment. Pressure for devaluation mounted through 1992 and 1993 and the official fixed exchange rate was halved on 12 January 1994. All other key features of the Franc Zone system were retained.</P>
<P>The devaluation has been a success. Cote d'Ivoire has exceeded 1994 growth targets agreed with the IMF, wage and inflation levels have been kept acceptably low, revenue and incomes have improved substantially and returning capital has resulted in surplus liquidity in the financial sector for the first time since the mid-1980s. Economic growth is projected at 6.5% for 1995 and 7.5% for 1996.</P>
<P>Political implications of devaluation</P>
<P>Cote d'Ivoire survived the devaluation - which effectively cut the real incomes of the poorest by more than 20% - without large-scale protests. The devaluation has generally benefited the key agricultural sector - but there has been little effort to cushion the blow to the country's urban dwellers. The urban population is increasing by around 5% a year and, from the end of 1995, is expected to dominate. Popular pressure in the cities for jobs, housing and services will grow. Real unemployment levels are probably higher than official estimates of 13-15% - themselves more than double the figures seen during the boom years.</P>
<P>Economic reform will cost jobs before it creates them. As job losses are felt in the formal (tax-paying) sector, the informal sector is expected to grow substantially: currently it employs some 1.2m people and is thought to contribute to 60% of GDP. Equally, resentment of foreign workers, particularly those which dominate the informal sector such as Ghanaians, is likely to grow.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>The principal threat to foreign business is violent crime. Banditry and armed robbery are particular problems in Liberian border areas, but have risen throughout the country since the early 1990s. The issue of violent crime was brought to international attention in 1991, when the Italian ambassador was killed in an armed robbery in an Abidjan restaurant. Since then, armed robbery has claimed the lives of several wealthy Ivorians and a number of foreigners in Abidjan and provincial towns.</P>
<P>Most petty crime is the work of gangs whose members are aged between 15 and 20, while violent crime is committed by armed bands, some of them comprising former Liberian combatants. Most violent crime in Abidjan takes place at night: in 1994, just under ten serious crimes were reported nightly, mostly in the city's working-class areas, Treichville and - to a lesser extent - Adjame. Outside Abidjan, these gangs roam the countryside, erecting impromptu roadblocks at night. Favoured targets are goods trucks and four-wheel-drive vehicles.</P>
<P>Car theft and theft from cars are the most common crimes. Most stolen four-wheel-drive vehicles are sold in neighbouring franc zone states. The market for these vehicles is such that many Ivorians claim that they are 'stolen to order'. However, it is important to put Cote d'Ivoire's violent crime problem into a wider context: crime levels in Abidjan are below those, for example, in Johannesburg, Lagos or Nairobi.</P>
<P>The police claim that Cote d'Ivoire's growing importance as a transit route for heroin smuggled from Asia's Golden Triangle and for cocaine from South America is behind much of the country's crime.</P>
<P>The government's response</P>
<P>Fears of burglary and car theft among Abidjan's diplomatic community have prompted the government to step up its efforts to combat crime. The Secretariat for State Security within the Interior Ministry was granted full ministerial status in late 1993 under the former Secretary of State, Gaston Ouasena Kone. Kone was instrumental in increasing police numbers and creating several new specialist units, among them the Force d'Intervention Rapide (FIR). The FIR, though only 100-strong, has quickly established a reputation for being more efficient than the regular police force, which had become increasingly brutal.</P>
<P>Other units include: the Section Antivol et Anti-criminalite (SAVAC), which deals with general theft and petty crime; the Brigade Auto, which deals with car theft and theft from cars; and the elite Unite d'Intervention de la Police Nationale (UPIN), which specialises in anti- terrorism and kidnap prevention.</P>
<P>All Cote d'Ivoire's specialist units were trained by French and Israeli security specialists, and have proved effective in Abidjan: reported serious crimes had by early 1995 fallen to an average of three a night. This success is limited to the capital because resources do not permit the deployment of these units outside the city. For example, FIR's ten vehicles are rationed to 20 litres of petrol daily, though even these limited resources are better than those provided, for example, in Nairobi and Lusaka.</P>
<P>The Liberian border</P>
<P>Fighting between warring factions in neighbouring Liberia occasionally spills over Cote d'Ivoire's south-western border. Thirty-two people were killed in the area in June 1995. Thousands of Liberian refugees are camped in the region, adding to its security problems. The situation is set to remain poor: the military is unable to maintain control of the 300-mile (500km) border with Liberia.</P>
<P>The military</P>
<P>The local presence of a French military battalion has given the government the confidence not to give the military too much power - a trap which other West African countries have fallen into. Senior officers are appointed or dismissed depending on their loyalty to the ruling party. Nevertheless, uncertainties during the election led to fears over long-term stability within the armed forces, particularly after Bedie dismissed influential Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Gen Robert Guei. Guei, a northern officer, had opposed the deployment of the army in a situation of civil unrest.</P>
<P>Other examples of military unrest are few and far between. Soldiers disgruntled at low pay and conditions mutinied twice in 1993: in March they took over the presidential buildings in Abidjan and in early April they seized the president's residence in Yamoussoukro, the official capital. The president was in no danger: the soldiers made it clear that they were protesting against measures introduced by then Prime Minister Ouattara. The government met the troops' demands, and tensions eased.</P>
<P>In times of political unrest the army, notably the Compagnie Republicaine de Securite (CRS), will step in to help. The army is unpopular among Abidjanais because of the brutal way it suppressed student protests at the University of Abidjan in May 1991. Four students were killed and several were injured and raped as the army put down the pro-democracy demonstrations.</P>
<P>Terrorism</P>
<P>Cote d'Ivoire has no known terrorist groups and a rise in terrorist activity in the country is not in prospect.</P>
<P>International relations</P>
<P>Nigeria is Cote d'Ivoire's only major foreign policy problem: bilateral relations have been strained in recent years because of both countries' involvement in the Liberian conflict. Cote d'Ivoire has consistently denied supporting Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) in the face of considerable evidence to the contrary. Nigeria supplied the main body of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) peacekeeping force in Liberia, ECOMOG. Persistent allegations that the Ivorian authorities were violating international economic and military blockades against Liberia led to two attacks by Nigerian-led ECOMOG forces in February and May 1993 in the south-western border region of Danane. Tensions between the two countries were also raised in the late 1980s, when recession-hit Cote d'Ivoire found itself dealing with a flood of illegally-imported Nigerian products which were exchanged for hard currency CFA francs. The CFA franc outflow contributed to the country's serious capital flight problem.</P>
<P>Relations with Ghana are periodically strained by outbreaks of local hostility towards the large immigrant Ghanaian population. Close to 2,000 Ghanaian immigrants were forced to take refuge in their ambassador's Abidjan residence, hostels and churches in early November 1993 as Ivorians went on the rampage in low-income districts of the city following Ivorian claims that Ghanaians had stoned a bus carrying Ivorians home from a soccer match in Ghana. More than 50 Ghanaians were killed, some 10,000 repatriated and more than 1,000 businesses destroyed.</P>
<P>Cote d'Ivoire was the first African country to establish diplomatic relations with South Africa on the release from jail of African National Congress (ANC) leader Nelson Mandela in 1990. Mandela's accession to the South African presidency and the advent of multipartyism in Cote d'Ivoire will see relations between the two countries strengthen.</P>
<P>Attitudes to foreigners</P>
<P>The prolonged recession has resulted in increased hostility towards foreigners. This is directed mainly against other Africans and, to a lesser extent, against people of Lebanese origin. The CFA franc devaluation prompted anti-French feeling, though there have been no related attacks against French personnel.</P>
<P>Ivorians are well-educated and proud. Abidjanais in particular are proud of their city's sophistication and suggestions that Cote d'Ivoire belongs to the 'Third World' are greatly resented. These attitudes need to be borne in mind during business negotiations: Ivorians will resent - and react against - any comment which might be regarded as patronising.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>Despite a certain degree of xenophobia, the political climate for foreign business is excellent. The government has made great efforts to improve conditions for foreign investors. Prime Minister Duncan has worked hard to dismantle the privileged status of French business in Cote d'Ivoire and has been forceful in his insistence that the country is no longer the 'chasse guardee' (literally, private hunting ground) of the former colonial power. France lost much of its hold on the local market when it agreed to devalue the currency while, at the same time, refusing to bale out its former colonies financially unless they had IMF programmes up and running. There is no doubt that France still holds sway because it underpins the currency, but Cote d'Ivoire is keen to attract non-French foreign business.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - Nigeria</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>Political crisis</P>
<P>Nigeria is facing a political crisis both at home and in the international arena. Military ruler Gen Sani Abacha is proving unable to govern efficiently a country of Nigeria's size, ethnic complexity, wealth and international and regional importance. Despite his promises, it is doubtful whether Abacha will hand over power to a civilian government on 1 October 1998. Nigeria's poor human rights record has resulted in a dramatic deterioration in its international standing, with the execution of ethnic Ogoni leader Ken Saro-Wiwa in November 1995 drawing worldwide condemnation. Nigeria is now considered Africa's new pariah state.</P>
<P>Background to the crisis</P>
<P>The political crisis began with the annulment of the results of the June 1993 presidential elections, which brought to an abrupt end a seven-year transition to civilian rule. Abacha, the former Defence Minister in the Interim National Government (ING), assumed power in a bloodless coup in November 1993. Since then, the political situation has deteriorated sharply.</P>
<P>Abacha is reclusive and rarely leaves the presidential palace at Aso Rock in Abuja (Federal Capital State). He has shown himself to be a poor judge of character and ability in others. For the first eighteen months in power, Abacha entrusted most government decisions to Secretary to the Government (civil service head) Aminu Saleh, a radical nationalist and economic interventionist. Abacha allowed Saleh to act as a buffer against members of Abacha's appointed government, as well as diplomats and business people. </P>
<P>Without authority, ministers and ministries became redundant. General policy drift enabled Abacha to dismiss the entire government in February 1995, and another government was not appointed until March. Saleh was dismissed in mid-1995. Apart from Minister of Finance Anthony Ani and Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, Abacha rules on the advice of a key group of advisers in his 'kitchen cabinet'.</P>
<P>The military</P>
<P>Abacha's ability to remain in power depends on his retaining the support of the military and the security agencies (mainly the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and the State Security Service (SSS)), either by fear or through the distribution of lucrative posts. Abacha is less generous than his predecessor, President Gen Ibrahim Babangida, but his cabinet contains several members of the military.</P>
<P>Although his lack of generosity makes him unpopular, Abacha is an adept tactician. Officers and key units are repeatedly reshuffled, rotated around national military bases or sent to serve abroad to prevent coup plots - frequent in Nigeria - from taking root. An alleged coup plot between December 1994 and March 1995 appears to have been a fabrication by Abacha and the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) to rid the military and civilian political scene of potential rivals. </P>
<P>Among those sentenced were former military ruler Gen Olusegun Obasanjo and his former deputy Shehu Musa Yar'Adua. Gen Obasanjo - Nigeria's only military leader to have handed over to a civilian government - had been openly critical of Abacha's assumption of power. The diplomatic community had approved of Yar'Adua as an acceptable leader in any political formula aimed at resolving the '12 June' political crisis.</P>
<P>A renewed transition</P>
<P>Nigeria's second transition to civilian rule in a decade began in March 1996 with voting for ward delegates. The elections were run on a non-party system to produce a nationwide structure comprising councillors and chairmen who are prepared to work with the military junta. There were few candidates of significant standing. Nevertheless, turnout was fair. Voters ignored boycott calls by the opposition coalition Joint Action Committee (JAC). Turnout was low in Rivers State, where 35 Ogoni candidates were disqualified on suspicion of being members of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP). </P>
<P>However, the arrests of Gen Obasanjo and Yar'Adua raise serious doubts about Abacha's willingness to step down, despite his announcement in October 1995 that he will hand over power to a civilian government on 1 October (Independence Day) 1998. Doubts about Abacha's willingness to concede any power were again raised on 22 March, when two decrees giving Abacha power to abolish councils were published.</P>
<P>Domestic opposition</P>
<P>The domestic opposition is weak and divided. Political parties were banned in 1995, though restrictions were eased marginally ahead of the March 1996 polls. Several attempts to form a nationwide coalition opposed to military rule before Abacha took control failed, as much because of ethnic and religious as political divisions. Moreover, there is no obvious successor to Abacha. Nigeria has failed to produce a strong leader capable of uniting the country's disparate regions. Even though the international community favours Yar'Adua, he is unpopular in south-western Nigeria.</P>
<P>The regime's opponents have systematically been arrested and detained. In July 1994 Abacha imprisoned Chief Moshood Abiola, a millionaire businessman and southern Muslim Yoruba who is presumed to have won the June 1993 presidential elections. Abiola's trial - for treason - proved farcical and dragged on for a few months. He remains in jail, but has not been sentenced. Other opponents such as Beko Ransome Kuti, founder of the Campaign for Democracy (CD) and National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), were rounded up in mid-1995 and given long sentences for their alleged involvement in the December 1994-March 1995 coup plot.</P>
<P>External opposition</P>
<P>A number of Nigerian writers, artists and academics, such as Wole Soyinka, have formed a loose external opposition coalition, which is more radical than the domestic opposition. This group has joined up with international human rights groups and environmentalist pressure groups to ensure that external pressure on Nigeria is sustained. The external opposition's greatest success has been in maintaining worldwide media interest in Nigerian affairs.</P>
<P>International relations</P>
<P>The execution in November 1995 of the writer and environmental and minority rights activist Ken Saro Wiwa and eight fellow activists from the Ogoni clan in November 1995 prompted an unprecedented international outcry. The executions took place on the eve of a meeting of Commonwealth Heads of State Summit, most of whom had appealed for clemency. The incident underlined Abacha's poor understanding of the machinery of international diplomacy. Nigeria's membership of the Commonwealth was immediately suspended for two years and many ambassadors were recalled for consultation. </P>
<P>More crucially, the executions launched a campaign - led by South Africa's President Nelson Mandela - for disinvestment and sanctions. This pressure is unlikely to subside until Abacha and his military regime are replaced. The following low-level sanctions are in place:</P>
<P>- the EU and US have banned arms sales to Nigeria;</P>
<P>- the EU, South Africa and US have imposed travel restrictions on Nigerian government officials and their families (though most continue to grant visas to unofficial representatives of the regime;</P>
<P>- the EU and South Africa have banned sporting links;</P>
<P>- EU aid of around $292m has been suspended.</P>
<P>In addition, there are restrictions on US businesses operating in Nigeria. In June 1993 Nigeria was de-certified for its failure to take action against local drug barons; this has impeded trade between the US and Nigeria and limited Nigerian access to fresh US capital.</P>
<P>The economy </P>
<P>The economy is starting to recover from a disastrous budget produced under Saleh's guidance in January 1994, which reversed ten years of economic reform and plunged Nigeria into recession. Several multinationals, among them Wellcome, ICI and Volkswagen Nigeria, had disinvested; artificially low interest rates (which were retained in the 1995 and 1996 budgets) resulted in an excessive demand for cheap credit; and inflation stood at 100% by the end of 1994.</P>
<P>A free exchange rate has been re-introduced, and the lifting of a decree limiting foreign ownership to 40% has prompted some renewed investment. However, the oil sector and the government are still restricted to a fixed exchange rate of 22 Naira (N) to the US$, while the market rate is around N80. Interest rates are fixed at an artificially low 21%. Most worrying for multinationals is a plan (re-iterated in March 1996) to re-nationalise the country's four main commercial banks.</P>
<P>Oil dominates the economy, contributing to 90% of export earnings and 75% of government revenues. Exploration and development in the oil sector accounted for $1.9 bn investment inflows in a recession year in 1994. Recent finds will see exploration and development move increasingly into the deep offshore and, short of an oil embargo, the sector will remain buoyant and dominant well into the next century.</P>
<P>Relations between the oil industry and the government have been strained for the past couple of years by the government's failure to meet its cash-call commitments and because of the fixed exchange rate. Relations have improved since mid-1995 as the government has stepped up efforts to clear the $800m debt to the industry. However, oil companies will increasingly become the focus of international sanctions and disinvestment campaigns. Campaigns may also extend to other high-profile companies with interests in Nigeria.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>High rates of violent crime pose the greatest threat to foreign companies and their personnel. Crimes include armed robberies of work compounds and shops, car-hijacks (car-jacking), highway robbery, break-ins and mugging, even during daylight hours. As a result of a sharp rise in the incidence of criminal attacks on business personnel, the risk rating in the commercial capital Lagos was raised to HIGH in March 1996.</P>
<P>Soldiers returning from peacekeeping in Liberia to unemployment and salary arrears are forming violent gangs. Residents in Lagos are most at risk from crime; there are daily incidences of armed burglary, armed attack, armed robbery, car-jacking, mugging and extortion. The risk of crime on the route to the airport is so acute that foreigners arrange armed police escorts to cover the route, particularly at night. The following incidents took place in late February-early March 1996:</P>
<P>- a Japanese and a Pakistani diplomat were attacked. The Pakistani was returning from the airport when armed criminals opened fire on his car, forcing it off the road. Police opened fire on the robbers, injuring one. The Mobile Police Unit (locally known as 'Kill and Go' because of their brutality) took the diplomat to a police station, where police attempted to extort money from him;</P>
<P>- a German diplomat and a Nigerian friend were reportedly abducted by an armed gang at the entrance to the compound where the German diplomat lived on Victoria Island. They were raped and left in the boot of the diplomat's car;</P>
<P>- armed robbers stole the car of a prominent Lebanese businessman outside the Lagoon restaurant. He was abducted and threatened with murder before being released in Ikeja;</P>
<P>- a gang of seven armed criminals attacked a Lebanese woman outside the American School. The woman was not harmed, but the incident is a source of concern as several foreign nationals and diplomats send their children to the school; and</P>
<P>- armed criminals attacked a Nigerian judge at his house on Ikoyi (the principal residential island for diplomats and senior civil servants).</P>
<P>There is little immediate prospect for improvement. An Israeli-trained anti-crime unit was formed in 1995, but has been confined to barracks since then because of instability within the military.</P>
<P>Fraud</P>
<P>Fraud is endemic in business. Exhaustive security checks are necessary when making new business contacts. </P>
<P>The most common form, 419 fraud (named after the section of the criminal code that deals with it), often involves complex schemes. It generally targets companies based overseas: US business is thought to have lost some $1bn to 419 fraud in 1992. This type of fraud has soared since Abacha assumed power, causing several European governments and the US State Department to issue renewed warnings to the business community.</P>
<P>The basic fraud technique as identified by the State Department operates as follows:</P>
<P>- victims are identified through business mailing lists, membership lists of business associations, or computer databases;</P>
<P>- they are then sent letters or faxes offering a range of business opportunities, which typically promise huge profits. Criminals often use impressive stationery;</P>
<P>- victims are enticed with the prospect that large sums will be transferred into their personal bank accounts for 'safekeeping' if they agree to make an initial payment when the business deal is agreed. They also can be offered potential contracts with promises of large commissions provided that they pay an initial 'fee;</P>
<P>- victims have been enticed to Nigeria to finalise a deal only to be abducted, physically threatened or prevented from leaving until they agree to pay off the criminals. </P>
<P>Businesses are frequently invited to bid for false government contracts on which bid bonds have to be paid with applications to participate. Those behind the fraud are often well-connected, with access to the official headed paper of, for example, the Ministry of Defence or Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). A well-known Lagos lawyer, who has been freed and has reportedly been assigned an armed escort, apparently threatened to implicate senior government and former government officials at his impending trial for 419 fraud. Despite widespread local knowledge of his activities, no Nigerian would testify against him. </P>
<P>Social, political unrest</P>
<P>Election violence erupted unexpectedly in the north during the ward delegate elections in March 1996. One person was killed and several others were injured when a riot broke out in Kaduna (Kaduna state). Minor disturbances were reported in Katsina State and Kano (Kano State). The incidents illustrate how growing urban poverty and unemployment have started to erode traditional northern loyalties to Islam and the military. Kaduna is the traditional heartland of the military; many senior military officers hail from these states and security force deployment was light. </P>
<P>There is a constant risk of a military coup. A coup by officers from an ethnic group other than the northern Hausa-Fulani would result in widespread bloodshed. Abacha is firmly entrenched and serious attempts to oust him - even by northern officers - would involve the mobilisation of troop and tank divisions and would result in conflict between Abacha's henchmen and coup plotters.</P>
<P>The south and south-west have been the centres of most political and social unrest since 1990, but an unprecedented security clampdown in these areas has reduced unrest since 1993, when some 100 people were killed in protests against cancellation of the 12 June elections.</P>
<P>Religious violence resulted in some 3,000 deaths between 1990-95: there were clashes between religious communities in Kano in May 1995.</P>
<P>Labour unrest</P>
<P>Large-scale labour unrest has eased. Abacha has systematically dismissed, replaced or arrested senior trade unionists. Until 1995, labour unions, notably in the oil sector, were powerful instruments of political opposition. A two-month strike by the oil and gas workers' unions NUPENG and PENGASSAN from July 1994 paralysed business across the country. Demonstrations in support of the strike were brutally suppressed: the security forces killed several students and injured 100 others on campuses in Benin City and at the University of Ekpoma (Edo State) in August 1994.</P>
<P>A precedent of sabotage and threats against foreign oil firms was set during the strike. Sabotage in August 1994 forced the temporary closure of the Shell-operated Forcados oil terminal, which produces 5,000 barrels per day (bpd). Other attacks against pipelines and installations prompted Shell (the largest onshore operator) to suspend exports and pull staff out of the most vulnerable fields. The French company Elf, Italian Agip and the US companies Texaco and Mobil all received threats from unions: most were forced to temporarily close fields and move expatriate staff - some of whom were harassed and temporarily detained - away from oilfields.</P>
<P>Pressure groups</P>
<P>Oil companies operating in the Niger Delta region face sometimes violent opposition from local communities demanding regional development. Prominent among these is the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), of which the late Ken Saro-Wiwa was a founding member. The execution of nine of its members and occupation by the mobile police units and army of Ogoniland during 1995 has rendered the movement inactive, but has increased regional hostility to the regime and to oil companies operating in the region. </P>
<P>MOSOP still has a strong leadership and a clear political agenda, namely the provision of funds to develop the region. The movement had successfully internationalised its cause, but the execution of the nine has made Saro-Wiwa and, to a lesser extent, MOSOP a household name in much of Europe and the US. Other groups are little more than small clans that attack oil installations in a bid to extract extortion payments. Oil companies operating in the Niger Delta estimate that attacks by these groups have cost up to $200m in lost production since 1993.</P>
<P>Local 'direct action' aimed at extorting funds from oil companies in the Niger Delta has included attacks on new pipelines and remote drilling stations, as well as sabotage of supply barges. Agip was forced to close its Obama and Clough creek flow stations in October 1993 following a spate of incidents targeting its operations. The closure cost Agip 270,000 barrels in lost production. In the same month, Elf Aquitaine was forced to shut down its Obaki oilfield some 35 miles (50km) north of Port Harcourt following disturbances by local activists. </P>
<P>Local security arrangements of companies faced with such attacks have come under increasing international media scrutiny following the London Observer newspaper's reports in early 1996 that the Shell Petroleum Development Corporation of Nigeria (SPDC) had admitted importing weapons and supplying them to the local police to protect its installations. London-based Shell International Ltd (SI) denied that the SPDC had imported weapons into Nigeria, but admitted to local purchase of 107 handguns for 'supernumerary police' assigned to protecting SPDC staff and installations in the 1980s. SI insisted that Nigeria Police Force rules governed the storage and issue of SPDC-purchased guns. The SPDC said that it had recently rejected subsequent plans to upgrade weapons used by the police. There have been 600 criminal incidents against SPDC staff and operations in two years, 10% of which have involved the use of weapons.</P>
<P>Terrorism</P>
<P>Terrorism is likely to play a more important role in politics because of weakness of the official opposition and the suppression of legitimate opposition to military rule. Attacks in the early days after Abacha assumed power in 1993 were limited to firebombings of houses belonging to key individuals in the regime. In 1995-96 attacks have become more sophisticated and more dangerous. Little is known about the bombers: warnings are not given, political demands are not presented and bombings are not reliably claimed by any group. </P>
<P>Two bombs exploded in northern Nigeria on 19 January 1996. The first explosion extensively damaged Kano airport's terminal. The second damaged the Durbar Hotel in Kaduna, which is owned by El Hadj Dan Kabo, a close business associate of Abacha. Abacha's wife, Miriam, had been scheduled to stay in the hotel over the weekend. Miriam was also the target of a bomb in May 1995, which killed at least three people at a government political rally in a sports stadium in Ilorin (Kwara state). </P>
<P>The January bombings added to speculation that a presidential jet crash two days earlier had been an assassination attempt on Abacha. The previously unknown United Front for Nigeria's Liberation (UFNL) claimed responsibility, but there was no evidence of sabotage and the claim is implausible. Abacha's son Ibrahim was killed in the crash.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS </P>
<P>The political and economic climate for business is poor, while security problems mean that Nigeria is among the world's most dangerous places in which to do business. There has been no effective administration since Abacha took power in 1993, and important decisions affecting business are not being made: the coterie surrounding Abacha is motivated by self-interest and personal gain. The infrastructure is crumbling, and businesses frequently have to ensure their own electricity, water and telecommunications links, making business locally expensive. Unpaid state sector employees frequently turn to extortion to survive.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, established businesses are accustomed to the hazards presented by local business conditions and have adapted strategies to do business. Newcomers to the Nigerian market are at higher risk of being directly affected by frequent political disruption, endemic corruption and the constant threat of fraud.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - Zaire</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>President Mobutu</P>
<P>President Mobutu Sese Seko has resisted sustained domestic and international pressure to stand down and give way to multiparty democracy. A five-year period for transition to democratic rule ended in July 1995 with no progress towards holding legislative and presidential elections. Zaire is now back where it started in 1990, with power vested solely in the executive presidency. Mobutu is based in Gbadolite, 1,000 miles (1,600km) from Kinshasa.</P>
<P>The transitional parliament in June 1994 elected former Attorney-General Kengo Wa Dondo prime minister, ending a political stalemate prompted by Mobutu's dismissal of transitional Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi in March 1993. The UN recognised Kengo's administration in August 1995.</P>
<P>Kengo was head of the centrist Union For Independent Democrats (UDI), one of approximately 180 political parties, before he assumed the post of prime minister, and he comes from Equator province, Mobutu's home territory. He twice served as prime minister while a member of Mobutu's Popular Movement of the revolution (MPR). Charged with implementing two tough IMF reform programmes in the late 1980's, he often publicly criticised corruption. However, apart from instigating audits of a few state-owned enterprises and dismissing some officials, he took little action to stop widespread corruption among officials.</P>
<P>Kengo's period in office was extended in July 1995 (apparently indefinitely or until the government manages to organise presidential and legislative elections) and his prolonged period in power has had positive results. He has encouraged the arrival of two permanent UN human rights monitors in an effort to reduce Zaire's isolation from the international community since May 1990 because of human rights violations.</P>
<P>The economy</P>
<P>The economy has been in decline since 1989, but under Kengo prospects have improved slightly. Kengo has reintroduced annual budgets after a three year gap: reduced spending and high revenue targets have been imposed in an attempt to impress multilateral lending agencies. He has taken control of the Bank of Zaire and stopped it printing money, cutting annualised inflation from 6,000% to 350% as a result. IMF representatives visited the capital Kishasa in December 1995 and praised the governments efforts. The visit marks the first step to restored links with multilateral lending agencies.</P>
<P>Kengo has used de facto privatisation as a pragmatic solution to near bankruptcy in the state sector. In mid-1995, management of the national railway, Sizarail, was awarded to a Belgian and South African consortium. Sizarail links the crucial economically productive areas - the diamond mines in Kasai, gold and agriculture in Maneima and copper mining in southern Shaba. Sizarail had been barely operating since 1990 because of theft of receipts by officials,mismanagement and repeated pay strikes. In the three months following the takeover, its revenues increased from $2m to $9m.</P>
<P>The country's main exports, copper, cobalt and diamonds, have fallen significantly in recent years. The drop in copper production is due to a general disintegration of the mining system in Katanga (or Shaba province). However, the decline in diamond and gold exports is largely due to illegal smuggling.</P>
<P>If Kengo remains in power through 1996 and continues reforms, he could pave the way for an IMF-and World Bank-backed recovery package. Relations between Zaire and the two institutions  have been poor since 1989, when Zaire's IMF Programme collapsed and the country defaulted on payments.</P>
<P>The opposition</P>
<P>Kengo has made efforts to resolve a long-running political crisis, but his appointment was a blow to Tshisekedi, who has never dropped his claims to be the rightful prime minister. In December 1995 Tshisekedi rejected Kengo's offers to participate in a cross-party government. In the wake of Kengo's offers to participate in a cross-party government. In the wake of Kengo's appointment, Tshisekedi had called for a strike at MIBA, the state-owned mining concern, and for a consumer boycott of key French companies deemed to have links with Mobutu.</P>
<P>The call for a boycott of French goods underlined the anti-Western element that forms a key element of opposition tactics. In June 1994 pro- opposition newspapers called for an anti-french 'holy war'. The opposition coalition Sacred Union gave all foreigners one week from 5 September 1994 to quit Kinshasa to allow it to start a 'liberation struggle'. The threat, like previous ones, proved to be hollow. Tshisekedi's Sacred Union has been weakened by internal divisions: few of the party's calls to strike are heeded.</P>
<P>The international response</P>
<P>The success of Kengo's reforming efforts depends largely upon the degree of support he receives from the three countries with a traditional interest in Zaire: France, Belgium and the US.</P>
<P>A policy discussion paper leaked in Brussels in February 1995 appeared to indicate that Belgium was to broaden its aid provision to include non-colonial states. This would mean that - when aid resumes - Zaire would receive less under multilateral provisions. Belgium's proposed modification to its aid programme indicates that confidence in the country's political development, though beginning to grow, remains weak. In October 1994 Kengo made the first official visit by a member of Mobutu's regime to Paris and Madrid, where he attended the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Military unrest</P>
<P>The greatest security threat to business stems from discontent within the ranks of the regular army. There is a constant risk that soldiers who are now paid on time (in the last week of every month) will resort to rioting and looting. In January 1993 soldiers angered  by shopkeepers' refusal to accept a new banknote rampaged through Kinshasa, looting shops. Many people, including the French ambassador and three other Europeans, were killed in the ensuing violence. French and Belgian paratroopers subsequently supervised the evacuation of most foreign nationals from Kinshasa and provincial towns.</P>
<P>Sporadic outbreaks of military unrest have continued since then: Payment delays in April 1994 prompted soldiers and civilians to go on a looting spree in Kimpese (Bas Zaire), 120 miles (200km) from Kinshasa. One person was killed and seven were injured. Shops, clinics and churches were the prime targets of the looters. Unconfirmed reports also claim that there have been disturbances at the army's tank division base in Mbanza Ngungu (Bas Zaire), 95 miles (150km) south-east of Kinshasa.</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Rates of petty and violent crime are high nation-wide. Businesses, notably those involved in trading commodities or cash crops, are at risk of extortion. This can include the abduction of expatriate staff or the seizure of goods with rising international market values. Members of the gendarmerie, army and intelligence services are involved in armed robberies in Kinshasa. Their involvement in cases of illegal detention for extortion and commodity theft is commonplace.</P>
<P>Extortion cases can be difficult to resolve because of the lack of functioning civic or commercial law, and operations in Kinshasa depend on links with key figures in the city's hierarchy. A feud between two rival private telecommunications companies providing satellite telephone links illustrates Zaire's scant regard for company law. The Ministry of Telecommunications in April 1994 overturned the terms of a contract held since 1987 by Telcel, a majority US-owned company. The move was designed to favour a domestic telecommunications company owned by a local businessman  with strong government connections. Telcel's apparent refusal to comply with the ministry's demands prompted a bomb attack against its transmitters in Kinshasa in April 1994.</P>
<P>Foreigners living and working in rural areas are at risk from repeated harassment by local villagers, abduction for extortion, false arrest and imprisonment by the security forces. High levels of lawlessness in eastern Zaire are a threat to foreign nationals. Armed bandits killed four Italian NGO workers and two Italian children in eastern Zaire in August 1995; another Italian was injured. The attack took place at Aimoto near the Virunga National Park, about 85 miles (140km) from Goma. The park is renowned for its gorillas, and the armed criminals may have been poachers. Poaching gangs, which operate throughout the eastern region, are ruthless and pose a particularly high risk.</P>
<P>Ethnic tensions</P>
<P>Mobutu has fuelled ethnic divisions in the provinces. The human rights organisation Amnesty International claims that the army carried out widespread massacres of opponents of Mobutu's regime in October-December 1993, and troops are believed to carry out extra-judicial executions in all Zaire's provinces. Fighting between the army and rebels in Kivu province in eastern Zaire in January-February 1993 reportedly led to hundreds of casualties. Tens of thousands of civilians have sought refuge from the conflict by fleeing across the border into neighbouring Uganda.</P>
<P>Rwandan border areas</P>
<P>Border areas with Rwanda are volatile, notably around Rwandan refugee camps at Goma, Bukavu and Kivu (Eastern province). Extremist Rwandan Hutu militias and their political masters in the former Rwandan Hutu government control the camps and organise food distribution. Much of the food provided by aid agencies is feeding the militias and the defeated army of the former government, which is re-forming and threatens to restart Rwanda's civil war. Cross-border clashes have occurred and border roads are now heavily mined.</P>
<P>In addition, the influx of Hutu refugees has exacerbated ethnic tensions in Kivu. Reports of clashes between Zairean Hutus who have lived in the region for generations and new arrivals emerged in early November 1994: more than 200 people were reportedly killed and an estimated 30,000 left homeless. Other ethnic groups have also reportedly attacked the Hutus. In response to the deteriorating security environment in the area, non-governmental organisation (NGOs) in November 1994 demanded UN protection.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>Despite Kengo's efforts at reform, the political climate for foreign business is hazardous. The infrastructure, telecommunications network, roads and railways are in an advanced state of decay. Civil servants rely on bribes for income and corruption is widespread. Foreign business personnel in major cities rarely travel without a group of armed escorts paid in foreign currency. The state's desperation to find new sources of finance raises the risk that foreign businesses could be taken over or subjected to arbitrarily-imposed regulations.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - Angola</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>Fragile peace</P>
<P>A tense and fragile peace has been in place since UNITA rebels and the MPLA government signed a ceasefire agreement in the Zambian capital Lusaka in November 1994, ending nearly 18 years of civil war. The peace process is gradually succeeding. Demobilisation began in February 1996, and the full integration of government and rebel forces should be completed by late 1996. A Joint Commission of UNITA, MPLA and UN officials was established in Luanda in early 1995. The commission's task is to organise the disengagement of the rival forces and help the UN to monitor the ceasefire.</P>
<P>The peace process was given a boost in September 1995 when the rival leaders, President Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, met donors at an EU-sponsored conference in Brussels (Belgium). The meeting has helped to consolidate the fragile peace by focusing on the reconstruction of Angola: donors pledged $1bn in aid, substantially more than expected.</P>
<P>UNITA's weakened military position has assisted the peace process. At the height of its military success, UNITA sought to derail negotiations, forcing frequent delays for 'consultation' in the belief that a military victory was in sight. From mid-1994 onwards, UNITA negotiators became increasingly desperate to reach a negotiated solution. In a key concession, in September 1994 UNITA dropped demands for the governorship of Huambo and its province in the aftermath of the war. However, key MPLA military commanders increasingly saw the talks as futile, and pushed for the military neutralisation of UNITA.</P>
<P>UNITA's loss of large areas of the diamond mining regions was a significant blow: illegal prospecting by the rebels had been worth more than $200m a year, money which was largely used to finance UNITA's war effort. Despite a UN embargo on arms sales to the rebel movement, European middlemen had continued to acquire materiel, often using the covert channels set up during the Cold war when Western governments, notably the US, supported UNITA.</P>
<P>Savimbi's position</P>
<P>Despite the Brussels talks, Savimbi's future is a key stumbling block to full peace. Savimbi has hinted that he will accept the vice-presidency offered to him in mid-1995. The post will be conditional on the demobilisation of UNITA rebel forces and the integration of many of them into a new joint army. Savimbi may take up the post once the government of national unity is formed in mid-1996.</P>
<P>The MPLA must take steps to incorporate Savimbi into the political process, though hardliners within the MPLA remain convinced that the best route to a secure peace lies in Savimbi's death. The increasingly moderate stance of army Chief-of-Staff Gen Joao de Matos has undermined the hardliners' position: they had looked to De Matos as their leader. By February 1996 De Matos appeared to have fully accepted the incorporation of Savimbi and UNITA into government.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Sporadic fighting</P>
<P>Despite the ceasefire and ongoing peace process, fighting has continued fitfully in a number of key areas. The Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul diamond mining regions are the main flashpoints. FAA commanders have made no secret of wanting to flush out UNITA rebels still illegally mining diamonds in the region. In September 1995 FAA reinforcements were flown in to conduct operations against bandits and smugglers. By March 1996 government forces had regained more ground, but were still unable to control more than around half the diamond region.</P>
<P>UNITA rebels abducted four South Africans in Lunda Norte in October 1995: the men were still being held in March 1996. Landmines also continue to pose a major security risk in Lunda Norte. In January 1996, two Britons were among several people killed when their truck hit a landmine near N'zaji.</P>
<P>Small-scale guerrilla attacks have continued in the post-war period: suspected rebels in February 1996 shot down a private Antonov-12 aircraft belonging to a Luandan air charter company. All five crew plus three civilians were killed when the aircraft crashed. The incident happened as the aircraft approached the town of Lucapa (Lunda Norte).</P>
<P>Lawlessness in Luanda</P>
<P>Crime is a growing problem in the capital Luanda: foreigners are favoured targets because of their perceived wealth. Nevertheless, crime is less of a problem in Luanda than in Lagos (Nigeria) or Nairobi (Kenya). The newly-retrained police force is cracking down on crime and there is a heavy police presence in the areas of the city where most foreigners work and live. Police are efficient and responsive. Luanda's 'musseques' (shanty towns which ring the city) are blackspots for crime, and the harbourside Marginal area is a favourite spot for muggers.</P>
<P>Tensions between former soldiers disabled in the war (mutilados) and police have led to a number of clashes in the capital. In September 1995 police fired on and killed several ex-soldiers during a street riot. The mutilados are angry that serving troops will receive a financial and training package on demobilisation. The government appears to have abandoned the mutilados and further clashes are likely.</P>
<P>The oil industry</P>
<P>Angola's war-damaged main onshore oilfield at Soyo in Zaire province began operations again in February 1996. Soyo had been out of action since mid-1993 when UNITA rebels captured the oil facilities. UNITA had almost destroyed Soyo when the FAA forced it to withdraw from the oil installations in August 1994.</P>
<P>With UNITA now involved in the demobilisation programme, the main security threat in the Soyo area is the presence of large numbers of anti-personnel mines and booby-traps. Small bands of renegade rebels are likely to stay outside the demobilisation process and may turn to banditry. </P>
<P>Cabinda</P>
<P>Oil production in the Cabinda enclave continued throughout the civil war. </P>
<P>Despite a number of small raids (there was one on Cabinda City and the airport in mid-August 1995), rebel FLEC guerrillas are not very effective. FLEC has little chance of military success against the FAA and the frequency of its operations has declined significantly since 1992.</P>
<P>The MPLA government's ceasefire agreed with one faction, FLEC-R, in late 1995-early 1996 has improved the prospects for peace. However, because the FLEC-FAC faction remains outside the nascent peace process, the overall security environment has not changed greatly.</P>
<P>Despite a decline in attacks on foreigners, abductions still take place in Cabinda. FLEC-FAC kidnapped two South Africans and a Sao Tome national in January 1996. The men were working on an alluvial gold-mining project near the northern town of Buco Zau. </P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>In 1995 and early 1996 Portuguese and Brazilian companies continued to increase their investments in Angola. Business is expected to increase rapidly once the government of national unity is formed in mid-1996 and the new integrated army is in place. </P>
<P>Despite continued political and security problems, the MPLA government is making a sustained effort to attract foreign investment; foreign companies with investments in the country have found the government reliable, quick to respond to requests for decisions or action and pragmatic in business relations. The government is continuing to address the following key issues: the need to continue with the design and implementation of a comprehensive economic reform package; the establishment of a stable atmosphere of reconciliation; restructuring the onerous foreign debt burden; and attracting concessionary finance for rehabilitation projects.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - Zimbabwe</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>Mugabe, ZANU consolidate power</P>
<P>President Robert Mugabe consolidated his position in presidential elections in March 1996. His opponents largely boycotted the polls, claiming that they were rigged. The main opposition candidate, Rev Ndabaningi Sithole, withdrew just one week before the poll in protest at alleged attempts to implicate him in a plot to assassinate Mugabe.</P>
<P>Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980. His ruling Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) consolidated its monopoly of power in the April 1995 parliamentary elections. Mugabe's moves to develop a de facto single-party state have been aided by incompetence on the part of the opposition. In the March 1996 elections the opposition parties were fragmented, amateurish and riven with disagreements and personality clashes.</P>
<P>This situation is unlikely to change until legislative and presidential elections in 2000 and 2002 respectively. By then internal opposition will be stronger and the independent opposition led by Harare MP Margaret Dongo will be able to oppose Mugabe. In 1996 the popular Dongo did not meet the age requirement of 40 to be able to stand against Mugabe. A former guerrilla fighter, Dongo was expelled from ZANU in 1994 for criticising internal vote-rigging within the party. She is one of just three opposition MPs in parliament and the country's only independent.</P>
<P>Economic reform</P>
<P>The death in October 1995 of Finance Minister Ariston Chambati was a blow to Zimbabwe's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Programme (ESAP) of economic reform. Chambati, who replaced Bernard Chidzero in April 1995, was drafted in from the private sector. It had been hoped that his business experience would bring some much-needed financial discipline to government. His short term of office saw the beginnings of change, but these could be wiped out by his successor.</P>
<P>Despite continuing pressure from international donors for more economic liberalisation, Mugabe claims to want to preserve socialist policies in key sectors of the economy. This may be to keep favour with the Marxist old guard, but it means that the international business community often receives confusing signals about his intentions. It is clear that Mugabe lacks sincerity regarding fundamental economic change.</P>
<P>Mugabe often holds up the state-funded, but loss-making, Grain Marketing Board as an ideal enterprise. The board buys maize from farmers at market prices, but sells it at subsidised rates. However, ZANU's commitment to socialist policies will be increasingly tempered by economic concerns and fears that foreign investment is declining. Privatisation has been slow in coming, though Mugabe in late 1996 promised a major round of divestiture up to 2000.</P>
<P>The ESAP has caused social hardships that have prompted unrest: rioting and clashes with police broke out on several occasions in the centre of the capital Harare in November and December 1995. Several outbreaks of violence in Harare's townships in October 1995 were less well reported. On all occasions police used tear gas, batons or bullets to break up the rioters. Urban disillusionment with economic reform was reflected in the low urban turnout (around 30%) in the April 1995 and March 1996 elections. Additionally, Dongo's by-election victory in November 1995 sent a clear signal to Mugabe that his popularity in urban areas is at an all-time low.</P>
<P>Land issue</P>
<P>Land and ownership rights will remain a political problem over the next six years if Mugabe's rule continues until 2002. Mugabe made several threatening speeches about seizing white-owned land during the run-up to presidential elections in March 1996. The threats have added to the uncertain security environment for business, giving rise to fears of wider expropriation. This is unlikely; Mugabe was probably just voicing the wishes of his more radical supporters.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, Mugabe faces conflicting political demands over the issue. Poor rural blacks have stepped up demands for Mugabe to deliver his pre-independence promise to nationalise and redistribute white-owned land. The 4,500 all-white commercial farmers argue that land redistribution will result in large farms being split into smallholdings unable to sustain a viable commercial farming sector.</P>
<P>The 1992 Land Acquisition Bill allows for compulsory acquisition of white farms at a fixed price and was originally intended to redistribute land owned by the white minority to poorer blacks. But in late 1992 the government reviewed its programme, setting up ways of assessing the agricultural skills of candidates wanting resettlement rather than expropriating property purely for political gain. </P>
<P>Agreements over land purchase collapsed amid controversy in 1994. White farmers, the international community and government supporters were incensed when it was discovered that all the white-owned farms purchased under a compromise scheme agreed in 1993 had been leased to government officials. Public and international pressure prompted Mugabe in May 1994 to reverse 72 controversial farm leases allowing senior officials to occupy state-owned land.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Crime rates in Zimbabwe are lower than in neighbouring South Africa, though they have risen in recent years. Massive youth unemployment is largely responsible for pushing up crime levels. Formal jobs are available for a maximum of 15% of the 200,000 school leavers entering the job market each year.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>Foreign businesses will continue to enjoy a relatively stable security environment. The ruling party's March 1996 election victory will guarantee continuity of economic policy, though this might slow down reform. President Robert Mugabe and his party need to become more business-friendly to ensure a better overall environment for business.</P>
<P>Economic performance since independence has been above average by sub-Saharan African standards, largely as a result of a diversified sectoral structure, an abundance of natural resources and pragmatic economic management since 1990. However, problems remain, particularly unemployment.</P>

<h1>Country Profile - South Africa</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</p>
    <p>POLITICAL STABILITY</p>
    <p>Government policy</p>
    <p>South Africa's first non-racial elections in April 1994
    marked the start of a five-year Transitional Government of
    National Unity (GNU) comprising a 27-member cabinet dominated
    by the African National Congress (ANC) (which polled 62.6% of
    the vote). The principal role of the transitional government
    is to formulate a new constitution under which general
    elections will be held in 1999, marking the end of the
    coalition government and consensus politics. The coalition
    members National Party (NP - or whatever party emerges from
    it in the next two years) and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP)
    will become fully fledged opposition parties.</p>
    <p>A programme to redress the political and economic
    imbalances of 40 years of apartheid rule dominates government
    policy. The Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP)
    has gained a reputation for being ineffective through trying
    to please all sides. Nevertheless, in two years the RDP has
    accumulated funds that should make it more dynamic. The RDP
    aims to encourage: democracy and institutional change; urban
    renewal and rural development; a new mass culture of paying
    for services; and a growing economy, which will provide wider
    opportunities. Between now and 2000 the RDP aims to raise and
    spend SAR40bn through restructuring the national budget;
    containing expenditure and improving tax collection; the sale
    of state enterprises and assets; the introduction of state
    lotteries; and contributions from business and foreign
    financing for development assistance.</p>
    <p>Despite the availability of funds, implementation of key
    elements of the programme has been slow; these include:</p>
    <p>- the construction of 1m homes;</p>
    <p>- bringing electricity to 2.5m homes;</p>
    <p>- the creation of 2.5m jobs;</p>
    <p>- and providing free compulsory education for ten years to
    cut illiteracy to 50%.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, political change and a growing recognition
    of the political as well as social need for RDP successes
    raise the prospect that large sections of the programme will
    be implemented. Moreover, Jay Naidoo, the minister charged
    with its implementation is hardworking and determined to
    deliver results.</p>
    <p>Government stability</p>
    <p>Although both junior partners have threatened to pull out
    of the GNU, the administration is fundamentally stable.
    Nevertheless, the government must resolve a number of
    contentious issues before the end of this parliament. Most
    crucial are: regional autonomy, particularly in
    KwaZulu/Natal; right- wing (Freedom Front) demands for an
    Afrikaner homeland; land reform; and the Truth and
    Reconciliation Commission.</p>
    <p>The Madiba factor</p>
    <p>What happens when Mandela goes? This is the most-asked
    question in South African politics. The domestic and
    international business communities attribute South Africa's
    successful political change to the 'Madiba' (Mandela) magic.
    Fears that Mandela is indispensable to continuing political
    stability are misplaced, but have already had a tangible
    effect. From 16-23 February 1996 the currency crashed 5% to
    an all-time low of SAR4.04:$1 because of unfounded rumours
    that Mandela had suffered a heart attack.</p>
    <p>Mandela has repeatedly stated his determination to step
    down in 1999 and his succession is assured. Vice-President
    Thabo Mbeki is his chosen heir. Mbeki will have to work hard
    to win the confidence of his party and the people: during
    1995 he has come under serious criticism for missing
    appointments and for arriving at international investment
    conferences late and unprepared.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, Mandela in February 1995 elevated Mbeki to
    the status of super minister charged with speeding up reform
    and co-ordinating economic policy. Mbeki's new role is more
    prime ministerial, but he will have to start producing clear
    results. If Mbeki continues to make a poor impression, he is
    likely to give the advantage to ANC secretary-general (third
    in ANC ranks) and ultimately, chief rival for the presidency,
    Cyril Ramaphosa. However, Ramaphosa is young and is currently
    unlikely to challenge Mbeki's position in 1999.</p>
    <p>After almost two years in office, several ANC ministers
    are emerging as capable, confident and diligent. These
    include Ramaphosa, Trevor Manuel, Labour Minister Tito
    Mboweni, RDP minister Jay Naidoo, Justice Minister Dullah
    Omar and Land Minister Derek Hanekom. In the event of
    Mandela's death, a nucleus of strong ANC ministers will
    ensure that the transition continues.</p>
    <p>The economy</p>
    <p>After nearly two decades of declining growth, and
    recession from 1989, South Africa is firmly on the road to
    recovery. Global economic recovery, domestic political
    stability and the lifting of sanctions have all had a
    positive effect on the economy. A growth rate of 3.5% is
    forecast for 1995, rising to 4% in 1996. Inflation by
    September 1995 had fallen to single digits - 8% lower than in
    1993.</p>
    <p>Confidence in the economy led in March 1995 to the
    abolition of the dual exchange rate system, a move designed
    to pave the way for the abolition of key exchange controls.
    However, the 5% collapse of the currency in February 1996 has
    delayed lifting exchange control regulations to late in 1996
    or early 1997. Nevertheless, the currency's re-alignment will
    have a beneficial effect on the balance of trade in 1996: it
    will boost exports as South African goods become cheaper, and
    cut costly imports.</p>
    <p>The ANC has followed dual policies of gradual
    liberalisation of the siege economy it inherited while
    recognising the importance of meeting the social and economic
    demands of the population. The RDP has been crucial. Budget
    allocations to the RDP have been met: SAR2.5bn was set aside
    in the 1994 budget, and rose to SAR5bn in 1995. Budget
    allocation is planned to rise thereafter to SAR12bn and
    ultimately to SAR40bn.</p>
    <p>THREATS TO SECURITY</p>
    <p>The KwaZulu/Natal problem</p>
    <p>KwaZulu/Natal is South Africa's most pressing political
    and security problem. Zulu nationalist Chief Mangosuthu
    Buthelezi's intransigence combined with political and
    criminal violence in KwaZulu/Natal are at the root of the
    problem. Buthelezi is bitter that democracy has assigned him
    to a minor position in the cross-party government. President
    Nelson Mandela's assumption of the presidency is particularly
    galling since, during the Cold War, the US and the UK sought
    to present Buthelezi as the acceptable face of black
    nationalism - raising his leadership expectations
    considerably.</p>
    <p>Buthelezi routinely boycotts Mandela-led initiatives.
    Buthelezi in January 1996 rejected the president's call for
    the IFP to return to the Constitutional Assembly, the body
    responsible for writing the new constitution. Buthelezi has
    boycotted constitutional discussions since January 1994 as
    part of his and the IFP's strategy to press for greater
    autonomy for KwaZulu/Natal. Although the drafting of the
    constitution will go ahead and is likely to be passed in May
    irrespective of KwaZulu/Natal's participation, the IFP's
    absence from the constitution will strengthen Buthelezi's
    federalist position.</p>
    <p>The issue of KwaZulu/Natal's autonomy is controversial.
    Buthelezi only agreed to participate in South Africa's first
    non-racial democratic elections in April 1994 on condition
    that the GNU agreed to international mediation on his
    constitutional demands. KwaZulu/Natal is one of two provinces
    not controlled by the ruling African National Congress (ANC).
    The IFP took 50.32% of the regional vote in the April 1994
    elections to gain a narrow majority in the regional assembly,
    though allegations of IFP electoral fraud were widespread. In
    comparison, the party fared poorly at a national level,
    taking only 10% of the vote. Buthelezi uses his influence as
    IFP president to control the KwaZulu/Natal assembly, though
    moderate IFP member Dr Frank Mdlalose is officially premier.</p>
    <p>Buthelezi has threatened to present a separatist
    constitution to the KwaZulu/Natal provincial assembly.
    Advised by US constitutional lawyer Mario Oriano-Ambrosini,
    Buthelezi continues to push for a confederacy that would
    limit central government control of the province. However,
    with only a narrow majority in the regional assembly (41 out
    of 81 seats), Buthelezi would be hard-pressed to achieve the
    two-thirds majority required to make constitutional changes.
    This is in any case unacceptable to the ANC and will be
    prevented. Buthelezi's unpopularity is growing and has given
    the ANC and urban democrats confidence that they would defeat
    the IFP in the future electoral challenge to ratify
    constitutional changes.</p>
    <p>The ANC's strategy has been one of consistent
    conciliation. It has sought to appease rural Zulu
    nationalists by formally establishing a constitutional
    monarchy. Mandela (himself a Tembu prince) has accorded Zulu
    King Goodwill Zwelithini traditional courtesies and has
    sought to restore traditional hierarchies which would put
    Buthelezi in his traditional place as chief advisor to the
    Zulu king, but deriving his authority directly and
    exclusively from the king and Zulu council of chiefs. Public
    closeness between Mandela and Zwelithini is increasingly
    displayed.</p>
    <p>King Zwelithini plans to hold a traditional imbizo or
    gathering of Zulu chiefs at which he will press for peace.
    However, this is unlikely to bring an early end to political
    violence in KwaZulu/Natal. No date has yet been set for the
    imbizo and it is uncertain whether Buthelezi will be present
    - Buthelezi rather than the king holds sway over the Zulu
    impis (warriors) who are at the root of most violence in the
    province. Without his participation, the imbizo will achieve
    little.</p>
    <p>KwaZulu/Natal violence intensifies</p>
    <p>The IFP backs its political demands by stirring up
    political violence in the province, which has been beset by
    political violence since the early 1980s. Close to 14,000
    people have since been killed as impis have sought to
    eradicate the ANC's influence. Some 1,200 have been killed in
    violence since elections in April 1994. ANC activists have
    formed so-called Self- Defence Units (SDUs), which have
    contributed to high levels of violence in the province.
    Deteriorating social and economic conditions and a culture of
    revenge attacks have ensured continuing violence. Clashes
    between IFP and ANC militants are also possible in the East
    Rand; nearby business centres of Durban and Pietermaritzburg
    are not affected by violence.</p>
    <p>Buthelezi's political aspirations and armed IFP militants'
    access to arms ensure that the situation in KwaZulu/Natal
    remains potentially explosive. The government appears ready
    to take a tough stand; in February 1996 Mandela announced
    that this parliament would introduce a ban on carrying
    dangerous weapons in public. However, a total security
    clampdown, including a state of emergency, a weapons round-up
    and the arrest of suspected IFP-linked warlords would be
    necessary to end the violence.</p>
    <p>Truth and Reconciliation Commission</p>
    <p>Buthelezi's popularity at a national level looks set to
    decline as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission gets off
    the ground in May 1996. Headed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
    the Commission is expected to highlight collusion between the
    IFP and the apartheid regime. Buthelezi and the IFP came
    under the spotlight as the trial of former police commander
    Eugene de Kock started in early March 1995. De Kock is named
    by members of the police force and the IFP in the
    commission's precursor, the Goldstone investigation into
    political violence. De Kock's former Vlakplaas unit is
    accused, among other charges, of supplying the IFP with
    automatic rifles, rocket launchers and grenades.</p>
    <p>Ultra-rightists</p>
    <p>Violence from white ultra-rightists diminished in the wake
    of 1994's polls. Before the elections, extremists opposed to
    majority rule tried to disrupt polling with a series of large
    attacks in April targeting election-linked premises in
    Johannesburg's Central Business District (CBD), a
    black-frequented bar in Pretoria and Johannesburg
    International Airport. A 200lb (90kg) car bomb exploded
    outside the ANC's headquarters in Johannesburg's CBD on 24
    April 1994, killing nine people and injuring 92. Although 32
    extremists were immediately imprisoned for the bombings four
    key members broke out of jail, prompting fears of a renewed
    threat.</p>
    <p>The residual threat from the extreme right persists and
    could escalate into sporadic incidents of violence during
    1996 prompted by the failure to agree to an Afrikaner
    homeland, issues of Afrikaner education, language and
    culture. Extremists firebombed an office in a school in
    Potgeitersrus (Northern Province) in March 1996 after the
    Supreme Court ruled that the school should not refuse to
    admit any child on the grounds of race, ethnic or social
    origin, culture, colour or language.</p>
    <p>Crime</p>
    <p>Crime, notably in Gauteng province, poses an unacceptable
    risk to foreign and domestic business personnel and assets.
    According to the latest police statistics, 10,161 people were
    murdered in the first seven months of 1995, and more than 1m
    serious crimes were reported. Insurance agencies claim that
    the total value of cars stolen in 1995 amounted to SAR4.5bn
    ($1.2bn).</p>
    <p>A nationwide crackdown on crime announced by Mandela in
    February 1996 will focus on car-hijacking ('car-jacking') and
    burglary, but will also tackle white-collar crime, organised
    crime and corruption at local government level. In
    KwaZulu/Natal, political violence exacerbates insecurity
    caused by crime.</p>
    <p>South Africans routinely carry guns. Eight people were
    killed and more than 20 injured in a gun-battle outside a
    Johannesburg factory in January 1996. A group of men
    reportedly tried to jump a queue of 2,000 people seeking
    temporary work: many of those queueing were carrying weapons
    and opened fire on the queue-jumpers.</p>
    <p>A new ban on dangerous weapons at public gatherings means
    that IFP supporters will no longer be able to carry
    'traditional' weapons, such as spears, during rallies and
    demonstrations. The IFP will resist such a ban, and clashes
    with the security forces are possible in KwaZulu/Natal.
    Spending on security was increased in the March 1996 budget
    for the first time since elections in April 1994, but the 4%
    rise may be insufficient to to attract enough new police
    recruits.</p>
    <p>Extreme black militancy</p>
    <p>The black radical Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA)
    emerged in the mid-1980s. The group declared war on whites in
    December 1992 and launched a series of attacks in 1993. A gun
    and grenade attack on a golf club in King William's Town
    (eastern Cape Province) in July killed four whites and
    injured 17. Minor APLA attacks against isolated white farm
    houses in the Orange Free State took place throughout the
    year. APLA forces have now been incorporated into the defence
    force and the risk of black extremist terrorism has eased.</p>
    <p>Mini-bus taxi wars</p>
    <p>Cape Town and Johannesburg are plagued by mini-bus taxi
    wars, which are played out at central taxi ranks and in the
    townships. Rival operators are waging a violent campaign to
    secure the most lucrative routes. Competition between rival
    firms has prompted violence since the late 1980s. Violence
    will continue until central and regional governments regulate
    the industry, but this will take several years.</p>
    <p>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</p>
    <p>South Africa is eager to do business. Successful elections
    and a credible cross-party administration have brought the
    prospect of a political stability not seen in South Africa
    for two decades. South Africa's established body of
    commercial law, strong financial sector and developed
    infrastructure make it an ideal base from which to enter
    markets elsewhere on the subcontinent.</p>
    <p>However, crime rates in Gauteng reached unacceptable
    levels during 1995. Even though Gauteng is the commercial
    centre, foreign business planning to enter the southern
    African market should consider setting up temporary offices
    in regional capitals like Winhoek or in cities such as Cape
    Town, Durban and Bloemfontein which have lower crime rates,
    until government crime-fighting plans start to show results. </p>

<H1>Country Profile - Yemen</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>The regime</P>
<P>The Republic of Yemen was formed by the merger in May 1990 of conservative North Yemen and Marxist South Yemen. The political scene is dominated by the relationship between two powerful tribal confederations - the Hashid and the Baqil - and the military. Central government control barely extends outside main towns and cities, and traditional tribal society flourishes in remote mountainous and desert areas. However, a mercantile middle class is increasingly undermining tribal influence in Sanaa, Hodeida, Taiz and Aden. The fact that President Ali Abdullah Saleh is the longest surviving leader in Yemen's history attests to the strength of his alliances with the military and elements within the Hashid federation.</P>
<P>Civil war</P>
<P>Saleh increased his authority with his successful marshalling of the tribes and pro-unity forces against a bid by the former leader of South Yemen, Ali Salem al-Beidh, to redivide Yemen in 1994. Although free parliamentary elections - the first in the Arab world - in April 1993 resulted in a carefully-balanced coalition between Saleh's General People's Congress (GPC), Beidh's Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) and the Northern tribal-based Islamist party al-Islah (Yemeni Reform Group), Beidh felt that Saleh was trying to marginalise the YSP's role in government.</P>
<P>In February 1994 Saleh agreed to act on Beidh's demands for greater checks on official abuses of power and constitutional changes guaranteeing greater autonomy for the former South Yemen. But Saleh was unable to fulfil his promises. Three months of skirmishes between pro- and anti-unity army units (roughly corresponding to former Northern and Southern troops) developed in May 1994 into a civil war in which Saleh tried to remove Beidh by force. Sanaa and Aden came under missile attack. Beidh managed to persuade a core group of YSP leaders and a handful of former Southern opposition figures to support his unilateral secession from the union on 22 May (declaring the 'Democratic Republic of Yemen'). Fighting stabilised along the former Yemeni Arab Republic (YAR)-People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) border and, later, around Mukalla, but the secessionist forces were defeated by 7 July.</P>
<P>The secessionists' defeat tipped the balance of power further in favour of the north and increased Saleh's personal authority to its highest-ever level. Saleh formed a new coalition government between his GPC and the conservative/Islamist Islah party in September 1994. Parliament amended the Constitution, creating a presidency and a new upper house (composed of tribal dignitaries). Parliament elected Saleh as president until 1999, and he in turn appointed southern GPC member Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi as vice-president. Saleh is making few gestures of reconciliation to the south, despite his decision to designate Aden Yemen's 'winter capital'.</P>
<P>Relations with Saudi Arabia</P>
<P>Yemen remains politically and economically dependent on Saudi Arabia, despite strains rooted in Sanaa's support for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 1990-91. In March-May 1992 Saudi Arabia warned six Western oil companies in Yemen that they were trespassing on Saudi territory, a warning that it reiterated to four foreign firms in August 1993. The border dispute was re-ignited with a series of border clashes between December 1994 and February 1995, leading to a series of bilateral negotiations and a provisional border agreement. However, relations with Saudi Arabia have yet to be normalised and the potential for fresh confrontation remains.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Kidnapping</P>
<P>Armed tribesmen sporadically kidnap foreigners in remote areas to the north and east of Sanaa and in Marib, Shabwa and Hadhramaut governorates, usually to exert pressure on the government or on rival tribes. Oil workers are the most frequent victims, despite the regime's efforts to protect them (a 'special force' was established in September 1993) and so attract increased foreign participation in the oil sector. Captors usually treat their hostages relatively well and release them after a few days, though three Dutch aid agency employees were held for an unprecedented three months from March-June 1994 after being seized on the Sanaa-Marib road.</P>
<P>The government's attempts to reward its tribal supporters in the 1994 civil war kept down the incidence of kidnap in early 1995, but the lull ended with the kidnap of a Dutchman near Reda in June 1995. The incident was connected to a land dispute and the hostage was released after five days. The authorities in September 1995 rescued a US national who had been kidnapped in Hadhramaut as part of a dispute between his employers and local tribesmen. In October 1995 two Austrian tourists were held for a week in Shabwa governorate, again in connection with a land dispute.</P>
<P>Vehicle hijacking</P>
<P>Armed tribesmen traditionally resort to vehicle hijacking ('carjacking') as a means of obtaining highly-prized four-wheel-drive vehicles for rough terrain. Most oil firms consider the problem to be an 'acceptable' risk. Traditionally, Marib, al-Jawf, Shabwa and Hadhramaut have been the worst-affected areas, though incidents have occurred in Sanaa itself and on the Sanaa-Hodeida and Sanaa-Aden roads, particularly around Dhamar.</P>
<P>Hijacks rarely involve violence and passengers are usually unharmed if they offer no resistance, though tribesmen shot and injured a Canadian during a hijack attempt near Mukalla in April 1995. There is usually a marked upsurge in carjackings in the weeks before the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.</P>
<P>Tribal clashes</P>
<P>Tribal clashes are rare in main towns and cities, but common in remote locations, where they occasionally disrupt oil operations.</P>
<P>Islamic extremist attacks</P>
<P>Most of Yemen observes Islamic law, and the activities of Islamic extremists are largely confined to the more liberal south, particularly the south-west. After waging a small-scale terrorist campaign against the PDRY (former South Yemen) government in the 1970s and 1980s, Islamic extremist 'Salafis' operating as the Jihad group emerged in 1991 with occasional assassinations of YSP officials and, rarely, bombings at Western diplomatic premises in Sanaa. In December 1992 Jihad staged the worst ever anti-foreign attack in Yemen, when an Austrian tourist and a Yemeni hotel worker were killed and five Austrians and two Yemenis injured by a bombing at Aden's Gold Mohur Hotel. The group attempted to bomb two other hotels in Aden on the same day and has occasionally attacked Western diplomatic premises in Sanaa, though none of these incidents has caused injury or extensive damage.</P>
<P>Jihad fought alongside government troops in the 1994 civil war but, with its hopes of a government clampdown on liberal behaviour dashed, in September 1994 its militants destroyed religious sites in Aden's Crater district and reportedly blew up a Swiss charter aircraft at the city's International Airport. Jihad activists also attacked shops and restaurants serving alcohol in Aden immediately after the war. In September 1995 extremists used a hand grenade and tear gas at a wedding party in Aden in protest at the mixing of sexes; the investigation led to the rounding up of an extremist gang led by an Algerian. Further outbreaks of violence in south-western Yemen are likely, though zealots are not capable of attacks elsewhere in the country.</P>
<P>Economic unrest</P>
<P>The government encounters popular resistance to controversial economic reforms that the World Bank has been urging, with mixed success, since 1992. The government's decision to double the price of petrol and other energy commodities sparked off riots against reform in Aden in March 1995, with the unrest spreading later to Sanaa and Dhamar. Similar unrest took place on a larger scale in January 1994 and December 1992. The government is prepared to weather economic disorder and will permit the security forces to use force during demonstrations. Protesters have not targeted foreign interests.</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Petty crime is rare in main towns and cities, and violent assault is virtually unknown. Car theft is increasing in the former North, but remains almost unheard of in southern regions.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>Foreign business has normalised since the end of the civil war, but still has to contend with the threats of kidnap and vehicle hijack. Few oil exploration firms have been encouraged by initial results and Yemen will never be a major oil-producing nation. Foreign companies must respect outward Islamic observances, though these do not usually impede operations.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - Central Asia</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>The Central Asian states gained independence in December 1991 after the break-up of the Soviet Union, suddenly facing increased economic, social, ethnic and political problems. Republican leaderships allowed substantive growth of democracy only in Kyrgyzstan and (to a lesser extent) Kazakstan, and have since reasserted control over non-compliant parliaments in both. Former communist structures have retained or regained power in all the states except Kyrgyzstan, adopting nationalist policies to differing degrees. In Kazakstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan the president has used referendums to gain extensions beyond the initially prescribed presidential term. Kyrgyzstani leader Askar Akayev used a referendum to gain greater presidential powers after being re-elected in 1995.</P>
<P>Economic problems</P>
<P>The impact of Russia's economic reforms and the desire to establish independent economic structures have prompted the states - to a varying extent - to move away from the communist-era command economy. Inflation, dislocation of the Soviet trading network and the loss of central funding have caused severe price rises and exacerbated social tensions. Unemployment has increased sharply; many workers are on part-time or enforced leave.</P>
<P>Tajikistan's near-civil war with a coalition of Islamist and pro-democracy groups in 1991-92 has badly damaged its economy and left it heavily dependent on Russia. Tajikistan's experience has provided a warning to the other states, where the populations' chief priority has been to safeguard and improve their living standards rather than to gain democracy. There have been no significant upsurges of popular unrest elsewhere, but continuing hardship could prompt popular protests and labour unrest. The exodus of skilled Russians has damaged the states' economic and administrative infrastructures.</P>
<P>Regional groupings</P>
<P>The states remain fearful of Russian domination, but have begun to diverge in their attitudes. Tajikistan is economically reliant on Russia, and its government needs the 25,000-strong Russian border guard force deployed there to stave off the continuing threat from Islamist rebels. Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan acknowledge Russia's key geopolitical and economic role while holding on to their sovereignty. An agreement that they signed with Belarus and Russia in March 1996 to form a 'community of integrated states' proposes economic integration and a customs union, but creates no supranational bodies. Neither Kazakstan nor Kyrgyzstan plans to give up its independent currency, and both reacted negatively to a subsequent union treaty between Russia and Belarus. Uzbekistan prefers bilateral accords and emphasises self-reliance, while Turkmenistan's natural gas reserves allow it to maintain an independent stance. Turkmenistan has declared itself a neutral state, but remains on friendly terms with Russia, which has joint control over its armed forces.</P>
<P>Kazakstan and Uzbekistan are rivals for regional leadership. However, they have made some joint movement towards defusing the conflict in Tajikistan. They and Kyrgyzstan view it as a threat to regional stability, and are keen to remove the pretext for the Russian military presence in Tajikistan. In May 1996 the three states agreed to set up a 500-strong joint peacekeeping force. They also pressed on with plans to establish a 'common economic space'.</P>
<P>Relations with Russia</P>
<P>Russia, the key power of the former Soviet Union (FSU), has reasserted its traditional dominance over its neighbours since 1993, notably in Tajikistan. Russia views the other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) states - which it calls the 'near abroad' - as within its legitimate sphere of interest. It is eager to preserve sympathetic regimes, maintain its military presence and prevent the growth of Islamic fundamentalism. Russia's main sources of leverage are its economic power (derived from its status as a key trading partner and transit route for oil and gas pipelines) and the former Soviet (now Russian-controlled) troops still garrisoned in all the Central Asian states.</P>
<P>Russia's influence has allowed its oil and gas firms to become increasingly active in Kazakstan. They hold stakes in the main Karachaganak and Tengiz fields and the planned CPC export pipeline from Tengiz to the Russian terminal at the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. Russia's control of pipelines to the West allowed it to limit Kazakstan's export capacity in a bid to maintain control over Kazakstan and to restrict competition for its oil exports. However, Russia has become more co-operative, fearing that it could be bypassed by plans for a new pipeline through Azerbaijan to Turkey. In return, it has obtained the largest single stake in the CPC scheme.</P>
<P>A growth in the influence of nationalists in Russia would fuel tensions. Kazakstan in particular is uneasy at Russian nationalist proposals to annex parts of northern and eastern Kazakstan abutting Russia, where more than 4m ethnic Russians are concentrated. However, Russian direct military intervention is improbable: the stakes are too high for both sides.</P>
<P>Turkism and Islam</P>
<P>Turkey and Iran have been depicted as the chief rivals for political and economic influence in the region. Turkey has sought to portray itself as the model combination of a secular Islamic society and a market economy to the Turkic republics of Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Iran seeks to exploit Persian cultural links with Tajikistan and potential economic ties to Turkmenistan. However, the states recognise that neither Iran nor Turkey has the political or economic weight to give decisive help, and are eager to court other international aid and trade. Islamism is a powerful force only in Tajikistan and in the Fergana valley shared between Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.</P>
<P>Ethnic problems</P>
<P>The region contains a large number of ethnic groups. Some autonomous republics and regions within the states are campaigning for greater independence or a redrawing of boundaries: this provokes tensions and in some cases clashes. Moreover, borders drawn in Tsarist and Soviet times often do not coincide with mixed ethnic populations.</P>
<P>Nuclear missiles</P>
<P>The West has pressed Kazakstan - and the other former Soviet nuclear states, Belarus and Ukraine - to hand over its nuclear weapons to Russia in order to retain a unified nuclear command. The three states completed the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to Russia in May 1992. However, regional tensions and the desire to maximise political leverage could stall the transfer of strategic nuclear arms (which will take several years to complete).</P>
<P>KAZAKSTAN</P>
<P>Political and social protest has so far been minimal. President Nursultan Nazarbayev is determined to maintain order: when thousands of opposition protesters established an encampment in central Almaty in June 1992, Nazarbayev told parliament that 'stability must be preserved at any price...including the use of force'. State paratroopers pulled down the encampment after six days.</P>
<P>Nazarbayev cohabited uneasily with the first post-independence parliament elected in March 1994. Deputies rejected his initiatives to privatise land and make Russian a state language alongside Kazak (in a bid to reassure the Russian minority), and passed a vote of no confidence in the government. Nazarbayev used the pretext of an electoral irregularity effectively to dissolve parliament. In April 1995 a referendum extended his presidential term to 2000, and elections to a new bicameral parliament in December 1995 produced a parliament that Nazarbayev can bend to his will. The Communist Party was the only party standing that did not openly back Nazarbayev: even the Lad party, which represents the Slavic community, acknowledged that Nazarbayev was its favoured leader. Nazarbayev subsequently introduced a new constitution greatly strengthening his presidential powers. Moves to privatise land are under way, and Russian has been declared the 'language of inter-ethnic communication'. New regulations have severely restricted the right of assembly: in March 1996 the Interior Ministry threatened to ban the Communist Party after it had held unauthorised rallies calling for the revival of the Soviet Union.</P>
<P>However, declining economic and social conditions threaten to undermine stability. Economic dislocation as a result of market reforms and sharp rises in fuel prices have caused production cutbacks. Unemployment figures are unavailable, but joblessness could be as high as 20%. The risk of unrest is greatest in the energy-intensive heavy industry in northern and eastern Kazakstan.</P>
<P>Although Nazarbayev's new powers have allowed him to push through decrees to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment, key economic decrees have proved less satisfactory than expected. Legislation can be erratic and inconsistent, and is often poorly implemented.</P>
<P>Many of those affected by economic problems in the north and east are ethnic Russians. Although few have been vocal in calling for greater autonomy and closer links with Russia, relations between native Kazaks and the ethnic Russian community are delicate. The Russians face loss of political and economic power, and the Russian government is keen to defend their position. Relations between the Kazak-dominated central and regional authorities and the Cossack community also are sensitive. Nikolai Gunkin, leader of the southern Kazakstan-based Semirechye Cossacks, was jailed in November 1995 for staging illegal demonstrations; the verdict reflected official irritation at the Cossacks' defence of their traditional links to Russia and right to bear arms.</P>
<P>Oil export revenues promise to boost the economy, which should return to growth by the end of 1996. The tenge currency strengthened against the US dollar in early 1996, while annual inflation had fallen from more than 1,000% in 1994 to about 50%. Several large-scale oil and gas deals have been struck since independence, at least on a preliminary basis. The US oil firms Chevron and Mobil together have 75% of the massive Tengiz field, while British Gas and the Italian Agip have rights (together with Russia's Gazprom) to the Karachaganak gas field. The Kazakstankaspiyshelf consortium of seven Western oil and gas firms is prospecting for oil and gas reserves in the Caspian Sea.</P>
<P>However, the lack of agreement on export pipelines has restricted progress and deterred international creditors. After months of negotiations Kazakstan, Russia, Oman and eight foreign oil firms in April 1996 signed a protocol to build an oil export pipeline from Kazakstan to Novorossiysk (Russia). Despite the agreement, doubts persist over Russia's intentions: Moscow continues to block Kazakstan's gas exports through its pipeline system. It could renege on the accord should President Boris Yeltsin be ousted in June's Russian presidential elections, or could co-operate only during the first stage of the project. Moreover, both Novorossiysk and Turkey's Bosphorus straits are potential bottlenecks for the 60m tonnes of oil that Kazakstan plans to export annually through the pipeline. These risks make a second pipeline which avoids both Russia and the Bosphorus highly desirable. Meanwhile, the Kazakstankaspiyshelf consortium's operations are overshadowed by the unresolved issue of the Caspian Sea's legal status. Russia and Iran favour joint control over all resources; Kazakstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan want the sea divided into five separate sections.</P>
<P>Street crime is a growing problem, and Nazarbayev has made it one of his chief priorities. Foreign business personnel have been victims of burglary and robbery. The police are often ineffective: in May 1994 a member of the Anti-Crime Council declared that one-third of officers involved in combatting organised crime and corruption were useless.</P>
<P>KYRGYZSTAN</P>
<P>Kyrgyzstan's President Askar Akayev is the region's only leader with a non-communist background: he was a scientist during the Soviet era. Akayev has a fairly secure power base in Kyrgyzstan's clan-based political culture through his native Chu valley region, which has supplied many leading politicians. Two distinct political groupings are emerging: a conservative bloc, led by the clan-based former Communists; and a democratic umbrella organisation with nationalist leanings. Both are represented in parliament; they keep a distance from Akayev while seeking to influence him. Akayev is a pragmatist and is prepared to work with both groupings. However, there also is a potentially destabilising political divide between the traditionally dominant north and the south, which resents its perceived political weakness and is cut off from the north by snow during the winter. The south also contains a large minority of ethnic Uzbeks who rely economically more on trade with Uzbekistan than with the rest of Kyrgyzstan.</P>
<P>Akayev has won praise and substantial aid from the international community for moves towards democracy and for Kyrgyzstan's drive towards a market economy. However, the country suffers from a lack of natural resources - apart from hydro-electric power - and a mountainous topography. An influx of refugees from Tajikistan has strained resources, while ethnic Russians continue to leave, taking with them vital expertise. The need for reform has prompted Akayev to adopt a more autocratic approach. In September 1994 he persuaded the government to resign and allowed his supporters to boycott parliament in order to paralyse the legislature. Elections were held in February 1995 for a new bicameral parliament with a small standing chamber - allowing Akayev to play a dominant role - and an assembly of regional delegates broadly supportive of Akayev. Akayev was re-elected in December 1995 and held a referendum in February 1996, which granted him extensive additional powers. These include the right to appoint the government; the president must obtain parliamentary approval for his choice of prime minister, but can dissolve parliament if it rejects three successive candidates.</P>
<P>TAJIKISTAN</P>
<P>An alliance of former Soviet officials, industrial managers and technocrats from the northern Leninabad region and Kulyab in the south gained power following the near-civil war in 1991-92. The war and natural disasters have virtually bankrupted Tajikistan, the poorest state in the CIS.</P>
<P>The regional-based tradition of patronage that underpins the political system foments political divisions and corruption. Leninabad and Kulyab were united only by their opposition to an Islamist-dominated regime, and victory over the rebels has opened the way to feuding between the two regions. President Imomali Rakhmonov has favoured his fellow Kulyabis in the echelons of power, to the frustration of the Leninabadis - who dominated Tajikistan's ruling class in Soviet times - and other regions. The first post-independence parliamentary elections in February 1995 produced a legislature dominated by haqim (local administrative heads) loyal to Rakhmonov. The opposition's refusal to participate in the polls - including the Leninabad-dominated Party of Popular Unity - has undermined Rakhmonov's legitimacy. Separatist sentiment may now grow in Leninabad, which contains much of Tajikistan's industry and is cut off from the rest of the country by snow for several months each year.</P>
<P>Competition for political power and for control of Tajikistan's few sources of wealth - notably cotton and aluminium - is liable to provoke violence among rivals who still control armed groups. In January 1996 two armed groups - led by men who had fought for the current regime in the 1991-92 war - took over the towns of Kurgan-Tyube and Tursunzade and marched to within a few miles of Dushanbe. They forced Rakhmonov to dismiss the powerful First Deputy Prime Minister Makhmadsayid Ubaidullayev, whose ascendancy had deprived one of the warlords of control over the cotton trade, and the other of influence over aluminium production. The warlords were non-Kulyabis and also protested against Kulyabis' political predominance. However, Rakhmonov failed to replace Ubaidullayev with non-Kulyabis, and in May 1996 violent protests broke out in the Leninabadi capital Khojand and nearby Ura-Tyube in protest at the presence of Kulyabi officials in Leninabad. The government was forced to dismiss several senior Kulyabis.</P>
<P>A ceasefire with Islamist rebel leaders has been repeatedly extended - and repeatedly breached. Rebel elements continue to mount attacks from Afghanistan and in the central Tavildara region. Islamist rebels, Pamiri separatist elements and Tajik/CIS border guards co-exist uneasily in the large but sparsely-populated Gorno-Badakhshan (Pamir) region. The UN-backed peace process looks increasingly lame.</P>
<P>The security environment for business will remain poor. A local journalist working for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was shot dead in December 1995 on a university campus in Dushanbe. The motive for the killing is unknown, but he was at least the 30th journalist to have been killed in Tajikistan since 1991.</P>
<P>Rebel attacks will be concentrated along the Afghan border where the Russian peacekeeping force is deployed. High crime rates and political violence will continue in Dushanbe. In February 1995 a presumed Islamist rebel rocket attack on a bus carrying Russian military medical staff killed a nurse and injured six others. The large number of weapons has fuelled the growth of armed criminal gangs nationwide. The killing of one of Tajikistan's four deputy prime ministers, Moyonsho Nazarshoyev, in Dushanbe in March 1994 may have been the work of the organised criminal underworld seeking to prevent the government from curbing its activities as part of a drive to restore stability.</P>
<P>TURKMENISTAN</P>
<P>President Saparmurad Niyazov exerts tight control to preserve political stability and win foreign investment. The population is politically conservative and the nascent opposition presents little challenge. Islamic forces remain weak, and Iran is likely to place the preservation of good relations and trading links with Turkmenistan above support for Islamic fundamentalism. Niyazov has won a referendum allowing him to extend his rule unelected until 2002. According to official results, only 212 voters out of almost 2m voted against Niyazov.</P>
<P>The economy will become increasingly important in ensuring political stability. Niyazov must satisfy popular expectations of wealth, which he has stoked in order to win support: following the referendum he pledged that GNP would triple by 2000. Although Turkmenistan has potential riches in the form of vast natural gas supplies, only small quantities have been extracted and a lack of pipelines will inhibit export for hard currency for some years. Political stability is attracting increasing foreign investment, notably from Turkey, but the implementation of a rapid privatisation programme in 1994-95 will increase unemployment and fuel social tensions. Living standards remain low, and the launch of the independent manat currency in November 1993 has been only partially successful. Only 2% of land is arable and food has to be imported.</P>
<P>UZBEKISTAN</P>
<P>President Islam Karimov, the communist-era leader, exercises strong political control and has introduced only limited economic reforms, in the name of preserving political and social stability. Parliamentary elections in December 1994 were conducted in the old Soviet style and produced a tame parliament: opposition candidates were prevented from standing, and multiple voting was common. Only one opposition party, the government-sponsored Progress of the Fatherland party, is allowed to function; activists of the banned Erk (Freedom Democratic Party), Birlik (Unity Popular Front) and Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP) are harassed and repressed. Karimov received overwhelming support in a referendum in March 1995 to extend his rule to 2000.</P>
<P>About 50% of the population is under 20, and Karimov fears the consequences of large-scale unemployment and shrinking job opportunities. Uzbekistan is the poorest former Soviet state after Tajikistan, and the economy relies heavily on the export of raw materials, notably cotton, oil, gas and precious metals. Karimov has increasingly embraced market reforms.</P>
<P>The country has been calm since disputes over price rises in January 1992 provoked mass student protests in Tashkent. However, socio-economic pressures are increasing, notably in the crowded Fergana valley in the east, where Islam is most influential. Ethnic Tajiks comprise a quarter of the population and mourn the inclusion of their historic cities of Bukhara and Samarkand in Uzbekistan, but there are no signs of significant active separatism.</P>
<P>Uzbekistan's large population and the number of ethnic Uzbeks in other states give it geopolitical significance. Neighbouring states have noted with unease Uzbekistan's semi-clandestine military involvement in support of pro-communist forces in the conflict in Tajikistan.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Crime and corruption</P>
<P>New political and economic orders and declining living standards have fuelled crime (albeit from a very low base), which now poses the greatest security threat to foreign business personnel. Although petty crime rates remain well below those in Russia and the West, foreigners are conspicuous and may be targeted because of their perceived wealth.</P>
<P>Organised criminal gangs are less developed than in Russia, but could become equally powerful. Gangs are involved in numerous activities, such as smuggling, prostitution and money-laundering. Gangs also may attempt to extort money from foreign companies, notably in Almaty. Threats may be backed up by damage to assets, machinery or power lines, attacks on personnel or attempts to discredit the company politically. There also is a risk of involuntary association with local firms with criminal links. Foreign firms investing in Central Asia should seek to gain intelligence about potential partners. Organised criminal syndicates will aim to take control of enterprises put up for tender in the privatisation process.</P>
<P>Bombings and feuding between rival gangs are rare outside Tajikistan, and most drugs produced in Central Asia are for export. Kidnap for ransom is exceptional, but is likely to spread, as it has in Russia.</P>
<P>Official corruption is hampering efforts to tackle crime and raises obstacles and costs for potential foreign investors. Companies should expect demands for bribes in return for services such as granting licences and agreeing deals. Low pay encourages corruption among bureaucrats and the police, but greater resources are unavailable. All the states also need to streamline their bureaucracies, a complex and politically sensitive task.</P>
<P>Islam</P>
<P>The Muslim faith shared by the majority in Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan has raised fears of fundamentalist Islamic regimes there. However, nationalism and self-interest rather than religion dominate policy. Russian backing should enable the survival of Tajikistan's government - the most vulnerable to Islamic forces.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>All five states are eager to embrace joint ventures and other foreign investment, and - with the exception of Tajikistan - offer a politically stable operating environment for foreign companies. The difficulties lie mainly in implementing projects: government inconsistency and bureaucratic hurdles will persist. Officials and entrepreneurs are still adjusting to the demands of the new economic and power structures. Entrenched interests, inadequate legal structures and safeguards and bureaucratic obstacles impede investment. Moreover, the importance of personal relationships means that talks and contracts may become invalid if officials are replaced - a common occurrence as fundamental political and economic change continues.</P>
<P>Economic difficulties have generated social and ethnic tensions, and opportunities for rapid accumulation of wealth have fuelled crime and corruption.  Organised criminals do not impinge on foreign business to the same extent as in Russia, but could become a similar threat. Uncertainty also continues over profit repatriation.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - Japan</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>Political manoeuvring</P>
<P>Japanese politics since mid-1993 has been marked by increasing instability and sudden political change. An eight-party coalition government came to power after general elections in July 1993. It ended 38 years of conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) rule, though the LDP remained the largest single party in the 511-seat Diet (parliament).</P>
<P>The divergent political interests of the coalition - which included new and traditional groups from the left, centre and centre-right, as well as a trade union grouping - led to major internal strains. In particular, a hard-left faction within the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which distrusted some members of the coalition who were formerly in the LDP, hampered policy formulation and forced coalition leader Morihiro Hosokawa to compromise on some of his more radical political reforms, particularly those aimed at checking official corruption. </P>
<P>The government, already weakened by the dispute over Hosokawa's reform package, was further undermined by his resignation on 8 April 1994 and the debate over his replacement. The SDP left the coalition shortly after Foreign Minister Tsutomo Hata was elected as the new Prime Minister on 25 April, leaving it without a majority. Hata headed a minority coalition government for less than two months. Following the passing of the 1994-95 budget in June, the LDP tabled a no-confidence motion against the government. Hata failed to persuade the SDP to rejoin the coalition and was forced to step down.</P>
<P>On 29 June 1994 SDP leader Tomiichi Murayama was elected prime minister to head a coalition dominated by the LDP. However, the LDP's resumption of power has not brought a return to political stability. Serious rifts in the coalition have emerged, and Murayama's position at the head of the coalition is by no means secure: pressure has built on him to call fresh elections in the latter half of 1995 (he is not obliged to do so until 1997). His political opponents have argued that electoral reform introduced in late 1994 demands fresh elections, and defections of key SDP politicians to form a fresh party in May 1995 further undermined the coalition's legitimacy.</P>
<P>Elections were widely anticipated in early 1995, but political machinations were postponed by a massive earthquake in Kobe and apprehension following a gas attack on the Tokyo subway in April 1995. Nevertheless, the government's handling of the crises incurred severe criticism from the public and opposition parties and increased the pressure on Murayama. Murayama's resignation would prompt another round of political alliance-forging, but would have little effect on business. The ideologies of the two major political parties are now so similar that a change in government would not prompt a significant alteration of economic or foreign policy. Moreover, local elections in 1995 demonstrated the public's disillusionment with politics. Low turnouts and the election of independent candidates reflect the small choice which voters feel they are being offered as tactical alliances between the two main parties increasingly replace party ideology as the basis for election. </P>
<P>Corruption</P>
<P>The LDP's election defeat in 1993 followed a series of large-scale corruption scandals involving key LDP figures, including dominant faction head Shin Kanemaru. Murayama has not mounted a serious anti-corruption campaign, and graft in politics has continued. The close relationship between government officials and big business may count against foreign companies when competing for a government tender. Many of Japan's trading partners maintain that illegal collusion between Japanese corporations is a major obstacle for foreign companies trying to penetrate the Japanese market.</P>
<P>International relations</P>
<P>Tensions between the US and Japan over the continuing trade imbalance between the two countries periodically threatens commercial relations. Several rounds of trade talks since July 1993 proved inconclusive and, in July 1994, the US decided to initiate trade sanction proceedings against Japan, alleging obstruction of imports of US medical equipment and telecommunications. Trade relations were further soured by a bitter dispute in April-May 1995 over access to the Japanese domestic market for US car parts manufacturers. The US responded to perceived Japanese inflexibility on the issue by imposing punitive tariffs on luxury Japanese imports, unilateral action which Japan said was in breach of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. Trade disputes do not have a significant impact on business security in either country.</P>
<P>The territorial dispute over the Kurile Islands (which were seized by the Soviet Union in 1945 and are now held by Russia) is the major obstacle to good relations with Russia. An economic accord agreed in November 1994 is an important step towards improving bilateral relations, but occasional incidents, such as Russian attacks on Japanese fishing vessels, have continued. However, the Kuriles are predominantly a political issue in Japan rather than a matter of national importance and territorial tensions over the Kuriles are is unlikely to evolve into anything but a diplomatic dispute.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Japan is one of the best-policed societies in the world and the overall security environment for foreign business is excellent.</P>
<P>Religious sects</P>
<P>Investigations into a sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March 1995 which killed 12 people revealed the size, complexity and wealth of religious cults in Japan. The chief suspect in the attack, the Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth) cult, claimed a membership of more than 10,000 spread across many different professions. More significant than its size was the destructive capability which the sect appeared to have at its disposal. Police found large quantities of chemicals at Aum's headquarters which are likely to have been used in the manufacture of sarin, and also uncovered experiments which appeared dedicated towards the development of biological weapons. Aum had apparently also used connections in the army to obtain conventional weaponry.</P>
<P>What Aum intended to do with its destructive capability is not certain. The cult is based on millenarian and apocalyptic lines rather than founded in a clearly defined ideology, and the attacks ascribed to the cult followed no pattern. Its broad aim may be to overturn all government institutions and replace them with its own, but the Tokyo attack and a subsequent gas attack at Yokohama railway station demonstrated an indiscriminate approach.</P>
<P>The influence of the cult was reduced following the arrest of its leader and other key members in May 1995. The confiscation of Aum's weaponry and more effective police surveillance make it unlikely that it can stage further large-scale attacks. Sporadic, small-scale gas incidents at subway and railway stations in Tokyo and Yokohama have continued, but these may be the work of individuals using the notoriety of the cult to give their actions added significance. Foreign business interests are at minimal risk from such attacks. </P>
<P>The JRA</P>
<P>The ultra-leftist Japanese Red Army (JRA) is no longer active within Japan, but surviving members operate from Lebanon. The group has conducted no major operations since 1977. However, the group retains links with Middle Eastern terrorist networks, and is capable of isolated attacks against US and Japanese interests abroad. </P>
<P>Far-left fringe</P>
<P>Japan's far-left fringe is represented by an array of divided and often mutually hostile factions with a total membership of some 30,000. Chukaku-ha (Middle Core Faction) is the most prominent, with an annual budget of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Since the 1970s it has led bombing and arson campaigns against runway construction at the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita, which it opposes on environmental grounds and because of the threat it poses to farmers' land rights. Chukaku-ha has in the past sabotaged local firms involved in the construction of the Narita runway. The group signed an agreement with airport authorities in late 1994, but small-scale attacks at the airport have continued: leftists are believed responsible for a small bomb in a lavatory on 13 May 1995. No one was injured. The attack was typical, involving primitive explosive devices which do not pose a serious threat to airport users.</P>
<P>Chukaku-ha has campaigned against proposals to send Japanese troops abroad (peacekeeping forces went to the Gulf in 1990-91 and to Cambodia in 1992-93). It launches sporadic low-level arson attacks against Japanese military targets. The group also agitates against any apparent revival of veneration for the emperor and stages arson attacks against buildings associated with the imperial family. </P>
<P>Nationalist fringe</P>
<P>There are some 40 nationalist fringe groups with a total membership of 3,500, but fewer than 10% of the members engage in violence. Many of the rightist groups have links with yakuza criminal syndicates. They have concentrated their anger on Japanese accused of betraying the national interest or insulting the Emperor. Rightists also are angered by the presence of US military bases in Japan and the Russian occupation of the Kurile Islands. Although right-wing fringe groups have been involved in attacks on Russian and Chinese consulates, they have not targeted foreign business.</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Crime rates are gradually rising, but remain very low by international standards. Gun-related crime in particular has increased rapidly in recent years, but still remains far below the levels experienced in the US and many western European countries. There is nevertheless growing concern that gun-related crime, previously almost exclusively the domain of yakuza gangsters, is becoming a more widespread phenomenon. The shooting of a doctor by a disgruntled former patient at a Tokyo railway station in October 1994 was symptomatic of a broadening gun culture which has been fuelled by a marked increase of weapons smuggled in from China and the former Soviet Union.</P>
<P>Yakuza</P>
<P>Yakuza crime syndicates have an estimated membership of nearly 90,000 and an annual income of around $10bn. Yakuza gangs engage in prostitution, extortion and gun-running rackets, and have extended their activities to Japanese communities abroad. There is growing concern over yakuza involvement in Latin American drug cartels' attempts to penetrate the Japanese market. </P>
<P>Gun battles between rival syndicates can put passers-by at risk, but remain rare. Japanese companies are subjected to various forms of extortion, including threats to disrupt shareholders' meetings. Japanese business personnel are also targeted: at least three executives of the Sumitomo bank were shot in 1994. The bank attracted particular attention from criminal gangs since it began collecting bad debts from loans made in the late 1980s. Despite these attacks, foreign companies are rarely affected by yakuza violence. </P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>Recent political machinations have had little effect on foreign business in Japan and a change in government will have few serious consequences for foreign business. Electoral reform and the realignment of the political opposition will benefit foreign business in the long term by reducing the power of vested political interests. </P>
<P>However, the more immediate consequences will be less positive. As competition for parliamentary seats becomes keener, factional and personality politics are likely to hamper economic liberalisation measures. Preliminary deregulation plans unveiled by the government in March 1995 failed to address fully the bureaucratic problems confronting foreign companies trying to enter the Japanese market. According to the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan (ACCJ), the high cost of doing business resulting from strict government regulation was the main cause for a 43% drop in foreign direct investment since 1991.</P>
<P>Despite political turmoil and slow moves to deregulate the economy, Tokyo will remain one of the world's main business centres. A downturn in the economy belies the country's fundamental economic strength and the strong influence of the bureaucracy (which has a tradition of autonomy) will continue to act as a stabilising factor.</P>

<h1>Country Profile - Sri Lanka</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</p>
    <p>POLITICAL STABILITY</p>
    <p>The government </p>
    <p>People's Alliance (PA) leader Chandrika Kumaratunga was
    elected president in November 1994 having taken the post of
    prime minister after winning parliamentary elections in
    August. The PA took 105 of the 225 parliamentary seats and
    has formed a coalition with the Muslim Congress and a Tamil
    independent. Kumaratunga's position as president means that
    the PA is able to override the constraints imposed by its
    slim parliamentary majority.</p>
    <p>Kumaratunga is an extremely popular figure and comes from
    a famous political dynasty. She has a socialist background,
    but since coming to power has demonstrated a pragmatic free
    market approach to the economy.</p>
    <p>Kumaratunga assumed control of key government ministries,
    and runs the PA's policy through her mother, longstanding
    politician Sirimavo Bandaranaike, whom she has appointed as a
    puppet prime minister. Kumaratunga pledged to abolish the
    executive presidency and replace it with a ceremonial form of
    the office by July 1995, reverting to the uniquely
    parliamentary system of government which existed before 1978.
    However, her preoccupation with the Tamil secessionist
    problem in the north and east has forced her to postpone this
    constitutional amendment.</p>
    <p>THREATS TO SECURITY</p>
    <p>The Tamil campaign</p>
    <p>The main source of political violence - and the greatest
    threat to national integrity - is the Tamil insurgency. The
    Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) is fighting for the
    creation of 'Eelam', an independent state to be carved out of
    northern and eastern Sri Lanka.</p>
    <p>The LTTE campaign escalated sharply following anti-Tamil
    pogroms in Colombo and the south of the island in 1983. By
    1987 Tamil guerrillas had established effective control of
    the Jaffna peninsula and much of the rest of Northern
    province. Ill-fated Indian involvement in Northern and
    Eastern provinces (the Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF))
    ended in 1990, and the LTTE quickly established its authority
    over the north and east.</p>
    <p>United National Party (UNP) President Ranasinghe Premadasa
    was assassinated in Colombo on 1 May 1993 - along with 23
    others - by a suspected LTTE suicide bomber. UNP political
    initiatives failed to provide a solution to the insurgency.
    However, the PA government has sought to solve the Tamil
    problem through negotiation. It initiated a series of
    measures aimed at winning the trust of Tamil groups and talks
    began with leading LTTE negotiators in early October 1994.
    The assassination of UNP leader and presidential candidate
    Gamini Dissanayake, almost certainly by an LTTE suicide
    bomber, that month provoked criticism of Kumaratunga's
    conciliatory approach. She nevertheless pressed on with
    negotiations, which resulted in an unofficial truce in
    January 1995. Both sides made demands and set conditions for
    further talks, but the government's refusal to move a
    strategic army base prompted the LTTE into breaking the truce
    with an attack on a naval ship on 19 April 1995. Fighting in
    the north and east has since escalated.</p>
    <p>A peace plan put forward by Kumaratunga in August 1995
    proposing a devolution of power to Tamils in the north and
    east was a bold government initiative towards solving the
    ethnic problem. A suicide bomb in Colombo which killed 24
    people soon after the peace proposal was published indicated
    that the LTTE would not accept its terms.</p>
    <p>Implications for foreign business</p>
    <p>The threat of occasional large-scale LTTE bomb attacks
    against political targets in Colombo persists. Alongside the
    LTTE threat to political targets, a Tamil militant group
    called Ellalan Force in August 1995 issued threats against
    foreign companies involved in tourism and other industries.
    The threat was similar to one it issued in June when claiming
    responsibility for an abortive bomb attack in a car park at
    Colombo's international airport. Ellalan Force is probably a
    front for the LTTE, which is thought to use its name when
    threatening foreign interests in order not to jeopardise
    foreign sympathy for its cause. Ellalan Force claimed
    responsibility for a series of small bomb blasts at popular
    resort hotels in April 1994.</p>
    <p>Neither Ellalan Force nor the LTTE have mounted
    large-scale attacks against foreign business. Small-scale
    attacks on the tourist industry similar to those in 1994
    remain possible, but in the absence of a concerted campaign
    against foreign targets Colombo and other areas of the south
    remain acceptably safe for foreign business. Large LTTE bombs
    can cause major disruption to business and present an
    incidental risk to foreign business personnel.</p>
    <p>Sinhalese terrorism</p>
    <p>In the Sinhalese south and centre of the island, where
    most foreign companies operate, the principal terrorist
    threat has stemmed from the Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (JVP).
    The government launched a ruthless counter-insurgency
    campaign in 1989 using extra-legal killings by pro-government
    hit squads. Remnants of the group retain support among
    semi-educated rural youth, and, though a large-scale campaign
    is no longer possible, the JVP may reclaim some support in
    the wake of Kumaratunga's devolution proposals, which have
    attracted fierce criticism from Sinhalese who fear excessive
    concessions to Tamils.</p>
    <p>Crime</p>
    <p>The Tamil insurgency has created a wider climate of
    insecurity. The army has become politicised and
    undisciplined, and members of the security forces are
    believed to have participated in the pro-government hit
    squads which assassinated JVP suspects. However, since the
    suppression of the JVP in the south, political violence and
    other crimes, including armed robbery, have decreased
    markedly.</p>
    <p>Labour unrest</p>
    <p>The close links between the PA and labour unions during
    the party's 17 years in opposition are likely to have been
    the reason for an outbreak of serious labour unrest at
    foreign-owned factories soon after the PA came to power in
    late 1994. Managers at two plants were held captive by their
    workforce and some companies closed down operations while the
    problem was addressed. The PA has distanced itself from such
    disruptive action and has stressed that it will not allow
    union militancy to obstruct its free-market economic
    policies. It set up a commission to investigate the unrest
    and established special police units to deal with illegal
    strikes. While violent strikes have become much less frequent
    in 1995, the government's plans to privatise some key
    state-owned industries are likely to provoke further labour
    union agitation.</p>
    <p>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</p>
    <p>The economy is resilient in the face of the island's
    terrorist problems and foreign business has maintained a
    steady presence. The previous UNP government was successful
    in attracting foreign companies to investment zones in the
    Colombo area and, since 1990, the economy has grown
    dramatically. The UNP initiated a privatisation programme and
    pressed ahead with the relaxation of investment and exchange
    controls for foreign companies.</p>
    <p>The PA government in August 1994 announced a review of all
    foreign contracts signed by the UNP, which it accused of
    gross corruption in its business dealings. A $500m deal
    negotiated between the European Airbus consortium and the
    former government was temporarily suspended. The PA did not
    cancel major contracts with foreign companies. The review was
    in part intended to demonstrate the PA's firm line on
    corruption, a policy which won it much support in the general
    elections.</p>
    <p>The PA has continued the market reforms initiated by the
    UNP, in which foreign investment plays a major part. It
    launched a wide-ranging privatisation programme in early 1995
    and has invited foreign companies to invest in key sectors of
    the economy while still retaining overall control for itself.
    However, Sri Lanka's economy faces serious problems if the PA
    proves incapable of achieving peace with the LTTE. Defence
    spending has drained the national coffers and necessitated an
    IMF rescue package. The budget passed in early 1995 was based
    on a drastic reduction in defence spending in expectation of
    a peace settlement, but continuing hostilities forced the
    government in June 1995 to introduce additional taxes to fund
    the war effort. Continuing conflict threatens to ruin the
    government's financial calculations and make it increasingly
    dependent on outside economic help.</p>
