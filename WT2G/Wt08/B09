I own a 1995 200HP Johnson Oceanrunner outboard and am having a problem
with the idea that I should spend twice as much for OMC TCWlll oil,than
what I pay for Lubrimatic TCWlll oil.Anyone have any thoughts on this
subject?

Wanna bet there's no difference?  I been using Lubrimatic from WalMart
and it works just fine.  I think the big difference is probably the
200% dealer markup.  OMC is NOT an oil company.  They sell overpriced
motors.  I'm sure, just like SG-CD oil, most all of this is industry
regulated by the API who rates all this anyways.  The rest is sales
hype and advertising.  The Lubrimatic runs fine....at least THEY are
an oil company.  Wanna bet OMC buys theirs from the lowest bidder
offering the highest profit margin??

This oil topic comes up every now and then. We (RBBI) took the
liberty the last few times (July 95, Feb 96, Apr 96) to record
the Rec.boats oil chat and post it on our site for the manufacturers.

Thought if we "stuck their nose in it" like a bad doggie they
might get a clue.

The info is still posted there (I think you can judge if they
got a clue or not)

There are about 60 messages there

Recreational Boat Building Industry Home Page

http://www.virtualpet.com/rbbi

On the main page about 2/3 of the way down there
are a bunch of "manila folders" pick the one
labeled "rec.boats newsgroup"
It provides a sort of FAQ on the two stroke
oil questions and pricing as well as some
editorial comments from us to the manufacturers.

name" (Texaco, Quicksilver, OMC, etc.) TCWIII oils protected the engines 
equally.  They didn't see any reason to spend the extra money for the engine 
manufacturers oil.  Since I only use ~6 quarts a year, I use OMC oil for my 
Johnson outboard.  If I had a 200 hp Johnson, I would consider using a 
cheaper oil like Texaco.

Would you believe LUBRIMATIC and QUICKSILVER TCW-3 are the same?  Yes. 
The same batch is just bottled for the different companies under their
individual brand.  I know this from my many years as a Mercury factory
test boat owner.  It's their "dirty little secret".  The marine engine
manufacturers do not make oil.  They buy it from Lubrimatic,for one,which
is a KENDALL Company.  Call Kendall and ask.

And WalMart has the best price.  Overpaying for TCW-3 is stupid!  No
engine manufacturer makes "better" TCW-3 oil!  Like Sears, and others,
they put out bids to see how cheap they can buy oil with the rating
and the lowest bidder gets the nod.  They'd be stupid to do anything
else....after all....It only HAS to run until we're out of the
warrantee period, doesn't it?

Believe it or not, selling oil for 1/2 price at Wally World DOESN'T
make it work 1/2 as much, either.  This stupid idea of paying double
at a boat dealer for some imagined "quality" never ceases to amaze me,
no matter which engine manufacturer pretties it up with his logo.

Actually, there is a difference between different brands of TCW 3 oil.  For 
example, OMC has additional additives over and above the minimum requirements 
needed to get the TCW 3 certification.  These additives are put in to increase 
engine life by reducing carbon and wear.

You get what you pay for.. the lower the price the lower the quality.....

SPECIFICALLY, what are these "additives".  Why would OMC want to
extend life of the engine past the warrantee?  Why would ANY
manufacturer make a motor to "last longer".  Hogwash.  That's why
they're made out of pot metal!  If OMC wanted you to have "longer
life", you'd have a stainless steel foot on that outdrive...Hogwash.
 
I stand by what I say, OMC is buying TCW-3 oil from the lowest bidder,
just like all the rest.  I called Lubriplate and talked to a very nice
man in sales.  He told me, "We make TCW-3 oil for many boat
manufacturers."  He would not tell me who, though.  He also said the
oil was all the same coming from the same plants.  WallyWorld
Lubriplate comes off the same cracking plant as SooperDooper at
$45/gallon.

Sorry to interupt here, but I have been using OMC/Merc oil, and am 
appaleed at the price but even more appalled by the price of a new 
engine.  It sure would be great to get factual confirmation that 
Lubrimatic is the same as either OMC or Merc.

All oils are not created equal. One very important point is that if an
engine (yours) suffers  catastrophic failure, It is not any of the oil
companies or any of the X-marts that sold it too you that will honor your
warranty. All Outboard builders have Technical representatives that
ultimately decide warranty claims. 
Your claim can be denied if engine failure is caused by inferior oil that
has gelled or provided adequate lubrication. ..............Phil

Only if that oil fails to meet the spec the manufacturer publishes like
TCW-III.

Speaking of Xmarts, I stopped by Kmart today and looked in the auto
oil department.  There was Genuine Texaco TCW-3 for $5.99/gallon!
Think Texaco knows anything about the oil business or shall I go to my
Johnson dealer's OMC who-know-who oil company?  You OMC lovers should
also check out Kmart for your TCW-II oils.  They have the Genuine OMC
oil CHEEP!  Gallons and poplid cans in sixpacks.  Kmart is also now
stocking GENUINE Mercury Marine Quicksilver blue TCW-3 oils in the
squatty gallon jugs.  Do you all think these OEM oils will be 1/2 as
effective at 1/2 the boat dealer price??  It's like buying wholesale.

BTW, wait a week for the Summerville Kmart to restock the Texaco.  I
could only buy up the 8 gallons on the shelf.  Guy said he'd make sure
there was more on the truck next week....(c;

$18-20/gallon.....LIKE HELL!

   What's the recommended ratio of this Lubrimatic? Is this Amzoil stuff
also TCWIII?
I know someone who is running this oil at 100:1 and swears by it. I'd try
it to get rid of some smoke but would like to hear some other users
comments before I bet my motor on any oil at 100:1.

As TCW3 is a standard of the oil industry, all TCW3 must meet this
standard before it's stamped on the bottle.  I would ONLY run the
ratio recommended by the manufacturer.  100:1 is AWFUL thin.  It
doesn't smoke but it doesn't lubricate much either.  I'd MUCH rather
have a long running smoker myself than a seized up clean burner.

Just to clarify, when you say "recommended by the manufacturer",
you're talking about the manufacturer of the MOTOR.

Just because the jug of oil says it can run at 100:1 doesn't mean
100:1 is the right amount of oil for your outboard. Countless motors
have been KILLED by running without enough oil.

No outboard manufacturer, and almost no oil manufacturer will say that
it's OK to use less oil than the motor manufacturer originally
specified at the time the motor was made. One exception is AMSOIL, who
says their products can be used in any outboard 1960 or newer at
100:1, but withold any comment about motors prior to 1960. Since
AMSOIL could not have reasonably tested every model of outboard made
since 1960, some of which were designed to run on 16:1, 24:1, 50:1,
etc., there's a good chance they're making claims based on testing a
select sample. Folks who say that running their old 16:1 motors at
100:1 with Amsoil has caused no problems generally do not put many
hours on their motors (like 5 per year), nor have they taken
micrometer measurements of any critical tolerances to make any
scientific determination of how much wear has occured. So, they just
know the problems havent become obvious yet.

Nope, I'd go with the original instructions that came with the motor,
regardless of what the oil jug says.

jorg, OMC dealers price their oil like they do their Extended warranty
100% over wholesale.$1450.00 to customer $725.00 to the dealer. I just
read on boating mag site that Amsoil is used at 100-1 if you mix it.If
your engine has vro just fill tank as usual.Dont know price of it but
synthetic oil is usually fairly pricey.Getting back to TCWlll I think I'm
leaning towards using OMC oil buying it in bulk in my container,if I only
could get over my distrust of most marine dealers.who knows what they are
putting in those 50 gal.drums.

All oils are not created equal, period. First of all, the rating TCW-III

Geez, it's time to change motor manufacturers!  If OMC is having these
problems and has to go to mechanic-in-a-can to fix their crappy
motors, maybe you need to think about another motor company!  I'd hate
to think I had to put $20 in fuel...then $15 in special oils,
additives, and pretty bottled saving-miracle-fluids in a motor just to
keep the cheap construction from disintegrating.  Come on....

WallyWorld sells Frams....much cheaper.  Fram must have a special line
for WallyWorld's filters that leaves out the paper.  Things at
WallyWorld, like Frams, cost 1/2 because Brown's Marina buys 1 case at
a time, from some middle man.  WallyWorld goes to Fram and says, how
much if I buy 480,000 cases this month and 560,000 cases next month??
Fram's salesman, dreaming about his promotion to executive VP from
being the guy who cemented down the "WallyWorld Deal-of-the-Century",
whips out the iron-clad contract for 1/2 what your wholesale is!
WallyWorld sends their fleet of trucks to pick 'em up, the plant runs
3 shifts, Mikey makes VP.  THAT's why WallyWorld is cheaper.

I'm requesting. Why does ordinary fuel seek out OMC 90 degree outboards to
stick rings? Why are
the non-V engines immune?

Well Larry, I'd just love to spend hours typing responses to your drivel
about what you think you know about outboards, but I haven't the time nor the
desire to spar with yet another tech wannabe. I do what I can to try and
disseminate fact from fiction in this newsgroup (which could be a full time
job in itself) but I trust that enough readers will make decisions based on
supported information and gradually tune the likes of you out.
 
The arguments about which brand is better started back when Thor and his
buddy each designed and built their own wheel and I'm quite sure that your
input, no matter how significant *you* think it might be, will add nothing
new to the centuries old arguments. I've spent the better part of my life
fixing marine engines and have a great deal of respect for all the current
motor manufacturers. Like all manufactured things in this world, sometimes
the maker gets it right and sometimes they get it wrong. The fact that marine
engines must rely on automotive fuels and therefore counteract it with
additives for use in two strokes, does not diminish their quality and, in
fact, demonstrates their commitment to the product already in the field.

As I suspected you would, you missed the Fram analogy altogether. Suffice to
say that if Wal-Mart were selling OMC or Quicksilver oil (if they were
allowed to), it would not be the same price as the Wal-Mart TCW-III because
it isn't the same oil.

Wow! Thanks, Larry. You have that uncanny ability to take the incredibly
obvious and, well, errrrr, state it! Of course, the fact that this
shortsightedness might well put your friendly local marina out of business
(and therefore unable to service those tough service problems that the
Internet/Wal-Mart can't solve for you) seems to have been lost on you. For
your information, I buy all of my supplies through buying groups which
provide the same discounts that Wal-Mart gets. The big difference is that I
have access to OEM parts and accessories and choose to stock and sell them
instead. In Canada, my biggest competition does not come from Wal-Mart, but
from a national chain called Canadian Tire and I have no problem matching and
often beating their prices so your argument is moot. Otherwise, I'd be
retired now with nothing to do but complain about how much money *you* make
doing your job. BTW, Larry, what *do* you do for a living so I can return
some of the incoming crap you're throwing my way?
 
 sp> So, How much does OMC SooperDooper TCW-3 sell for on the dock at
 sp> Brown's Marina?  Do we get a newsgroup discount if we buy by the case?
 
Remembering that the exchange between the US & Cdn dollar fluctuates daily,
and that we're metric up here, I'll try and do a quick conversion and see how
it turns out:  A quart of OMC-TCW III works out to about $3.50 US. I have
access to (but choose not to sell) non-OEM brands that would obviously sell
for less. I always encourage my customers to buy in volume and pass along the
savings to them. Gallon, 2.5 gallon, 5 gallon, and 45 gallon quantities are
available with substantial reductions offered for increased volumes. Most
customers buy the 2.5 gallon size which seems to last for the season. I do
not recommend anyone buy outside their geographic region. Warranty/buy-
locally issues aside, there's no reason why you couldn't find someone nearby
who will give reasonable prices without the hassles of
shipping/exchange/customs etc. I provide information only in the interest of
fostering better information in this newsgroup.
 
Getting back to the original thread, I disassembled countless two stroke
engines and can tell you that even *you* could tell the difference between
one that's been running OEM and one that's been running no-name. Like I said
before, I personally don't care which oil you use, it makes no difference
whatsoever to me. You should ask yourself this question though, if I have
nothing to gain (financially or otherwise) from recommending OEM oils, why
would I do so unless it were true? <shrug>

Here's an eye opener for you then Larry. Call your friend back and ask him
if any of the OEM oils they manufacture have different formulations and ask
him if they're allowed to sell that same formulation under their Lubrimatic
name. If he's honest, you'll find he admits that while OMC/Merc/Yamaha/etc
all buy & sell TCW-III oils, each has its own formulations and that
Lubrimatic is under license to manufacture and bottle it for them. Under the
terms of this license, they can't manufacture and re-label it for any one
else (including themselves). OMC's oil was not manufactured by Lubrimatic
last year so that leaves one OEM off your list to deduce who they're making
it for.
 
Try this next year to see if it doesn't prove my point with another oil. Buy
OMC's Hi-Vis gear oil and a bottle of Lubrimatic's equivalent. Squirt some
on your fingers and compare the feel. Smell it. Run it in you lower unit for
50 hours and compare it. If you *still* think it's the same stuff, you should
be extra careful when operating heavy machinery.

Ok, went to Wally World yesterday to get the numbers and would like to
post them here.  WalMart's own brand at about $6.50/gallon has the
NMMA's own TCW-3 registration number of 3-42020.  There was a
$16.50/gallon Itasca brand synthetic oil also there from a company
called Specialty Oils, 2740 Valley View Dr, Shreveport, LA 71148 with
an NMMA registration number of #3-74020.  These were stocked with the
oils in the auto department, for some stupid reason known only to the
marketing Phds.  Over in boat stuff, LubriMatic's (about $6.29/gallon)
had an NMMA registration number of 3-32030.
 
I'm researching the web for NMMA's data today, if I get the time.
Interested parties please help the searching.  Mr Brown, please post
the actual NMMA registration numbers on all the oils you sell for us
so we won't have to run all over town visiting boat dealers finding
them.  It's TOO DANGEROUS going into boat dealers and marine supply
places, we all end up with a truckload of goodies every  time we go.
You can save us all lots of money by just posting the
numbers...Please?
 
I'm not interested in a flame war with you, in spite of your insults.
I think it would be very interesting to just know the real truth.  I
couldn't find Specialty Oils on the net, so have mailed them snailmail
asking them for SPECIFIC information on who they provide TCW-3 oil to.
It will be interesting if they reply.  There was no telephone number
on the bottles, I guess I could call Louisiana information.  Maybe
later.
 
Let's all try to remain civil, just for a change.  No need to explode

Woah!!!
I'm Gary Polson and I webmaster the RBBI site your are
discussing. I'm on the end users side on  this one.
If you will read my comments at the top of that page
I am telling the manufacturers they need to be able to
prove their oils are better and justify the higher price.
They need to have documented tests showing increased
performance and tell you why in order to demand premium
pricing.
 
I put a post in this newsgroup when this thread started
again a couple of weeks ago and pointed the site out and
told you I had "tried to rub their noses in it like
a bad dog".
 
Anyway come by and see the posts on this issue in the past.
You can go to the address above or just come in the front
door.
 
http://www.virtualpet.com/rbbi
 
and look for the rec.boats Folder.
 
You are very welcome to visit the site and we are trying to
encourage online participation between the manufacturers and
end users.
 
Yes I am "watching you" but I am trying to help you by
pulling out specific messages the manufactures should be
paying attention to and calling them to their attention.
In real life, few of them are even seeing them on my site,
none of them (US mfg) are making concerted efforts to see
them in the newsgroup because they have to sift them out from
all the other messages. We try to make it a little easier
for them to see the messages. We are seeing the most interest

all the other messages. We try to make it a little easier
for them to see the messages. We are seeing the most interest
and participation from foreign manufacturers.

Geez, Gary.  RBBI looked like some kind of manufacturer society!  I
thought I'd gotten a sneak look in OMC's secret dealer web sites.
Does anyone know the dealer 6 digit number and zip code we can use to
get into these secrets at OMC?  Sure would like to look at the recall
lists, techie data, problem children we mere mortals aren't allowed to
see under the pretty-pretty fluff.

I think I'm leaning towards using the OMC oil if I can find a dealer that
I can trust. Somwhere along the way I read that OMC TCW-2 oil was colored
blue and OMC TCW-3 oil was red. Then I read that one fellow got purple oil
from his dealer. He pointed out that blue and red make purple. So, I was
wondering if we could at least have a color we could depend on, I would
feel a lot better about purchasing OMC oil in bulk for a little more money
than the Lubrimatic. Just to be on safe side in case the Pro OEM folks are
correct.
Any comments on this sure would be appreciated.

All the TCW-3 I ever got was blue.  Relax, you're in luck!  Kmart
today had OMC TCW-II oil in gallons and poplid cans CHEAP!  They also
had Mercury Marine Quicksilver TCW-3 at $6/gallon and Genuine Texaco
TCW-3 for $5.99/gallon!  Why pay more?  Do you think OEM oils are 1/2

*This* is what we'd all like to see, instead of all these honchos just
saying "this is better" or "that is better" off the tops of their heads.
 
Maybe a boating or saltwater fishing magazine could run a test that would
go something like:
 
1. Three twin-engine boats.
 
2. On each boat, one engine uses manufacturer's oil, the other the
$6-a-gallon
   stuff from XMart. Both TCW-III, of course. Running them on twin-engine
rigs would ensure that both motors operated under identical conditions.
 
3. After X number of running hours, take the heads off the motors and look
   for differences.
 
Heck, you could do it with ONE boat. I'm not sure, though, that these
magazines would have the guts to run a test that might cost their biggest advertisers
millions of dollars in profits from oil sales. Maybe a resourceful private
individual could run the test on his own boat and put the results on a web
page, or perhaps a company who makes the cheaper oil could do it.
 
One thing for sure, though, it would get a *lot* of attention!

This would be a great idea!  What I would REALLY like to see is a good
Consumer's Reports TCW-3 test.  This would eliminate all the bribery
associated with your favorite sport boat mags.  You know, the company
picking the mag execs up in a limo full of whores for a night on the
town just BEFORE giving them an order for $50K in new ads for next
month.  We ALL know those tests in boat mags would be REAL objective.
Consumer's Reports would really smoke that oil over, so to speak.
We'd even find out who was telling the truth, for a change.

OMC oil is the test oil used for BIA testing. It is a high grade oil
with 16 chemical additives used to clean and further protect the
engine.
Most all name brand TCW3 oil (base) is similar but it is the expensive
chemical additive formula that set the OMC oil appart. We could leave
out many of the chemicals and lower the price while increasing profit
but we would also run the risk of increased engine wear. This we elect
not to do.
 
OMC purchases base oil stock from major suppliers and has our
exclusive formula added. Remember, to be TCW3 certified you only
have to pass the minimum BIA test. You do not have to add additional 
chemicals or be the top grade. OMC meets the highest standard 
and continues to set the standard for the top grade TCW3 outboard oil.

Editors notes:
 
Notice all the SPECIFIC information as to the manufacturers names,
SPECIFIC standards, etc.  Ok, now can anyone name 16 chemical
additives added to 2-stroke oil ABOVE what is already added to "major
suppliers" stock oils?  Think hard!  After reading this, I was
wondering...If we have "major suppliers" already TCW-3 oils, add in 16
more kinds of chemicals to it, HOW MUCH LUBE OIL CAN BE LEFT to save
my engine!!??  There MUST be 50% "additional chemicals" in there!  At
some point, the oil will be so diluted there'll be almost no oil left!
I'm still chewing on this statement.  Maybe when OMC reads this we can
find out how much actual lube oil is left or, more specifically, are
we talking about traces of 16 more chemicals?  I researched the
American Petroleum Institute and oil chemical manufacturer's sites and
can't seem to find anyone with 16 chemicals to add to oil....most
interesting.  More news later..............     .GIF at 11

Life was much simpler bumming SAE 30 off my grandfather to add to the
tractor gas I got from his farm tank to put in my Elto 1HP from the
QUART jug I used to take fishing......(sigh)  I still got the Elto, it
still uses SAE 30 mixed tractor gas 40 years later...runs fine.
..(c;  Is this progress??

The following information was found in a publication from North Coast
Oil Company, Inc.
&quot;NMMA TC-W3 Lubricants are a major improvement over TCWII fluids, both
in water-cooled and air-coolde applications.  With the introduction of
the new TC-W3 additives, the additive companies, that once were
skepitical of performance quality of TC-WII oils generally marketed
for air-cooled applications, are now confident of adequate air-cooled,
two-cycle engine protection, using their approved TC-W3 formulas.
Therefore a true &quot;Universal&quot; two-cycle lubricant is now available
UNTIL!! &quot;JASO&quot; and &quot;GLOBAL&quot; fluids are required.&quot;

On the issue of brand X being better than brand Y and the engine maker
that claims only their brand Z  TCW3 oil can be used in their
respective engines. TCW3 oil in itself is a specific formula. If the
Oil lable states it is a TCW3 with an approval code of 3-15020 located
above, below, or on either side of the TCW3 logo, it is the aproved
oil for use this year in all outboard engines.

Is one Brand of TCW3 coded 3-15020 better than the other. Yea, the one
with the lower price is better cause it leaves more of the green stuff
in your pocket where it belongs and not turned into excess profits for
the engine makers. 

According to GOA company, North Coast Oil, Inc. ST Paul, MN. If you
use TCW3 coded 3-15020 all engine makers must honor any warranty
claims without regard to the brand of TCW3 oil used in the engine.

In Sumary, I use TCW3 oil coded 3-15020 sold directely by oil
companies.  I know I am paying a fair price for an approved product
and not contributing to unearned profits the engine makers try to
make.

  By the way, in the United States, this is also Federal Law.  It is called
the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act.  An engine manufacturer can indeed require a
certain brand of lubricant be used in their engine though.  How?  There is
only one way; *if* the manufacturer were to provide the specified lubricant
for *free*, or if it can be *proven* that the engine will only run properly
with said specified *brand* lubricant.
   So if some unscrupulous store is telling you that you *must* use a certain
bran oil in order to maintain any warranty, say to them &quot;Okay.  Where is my
FREE oil?&quot;  If they do not give you the oil for FREE, then tell them that
maybe it is time for you to call the Federal Trade Commission and report their
*illegal* activities and efforts to rip-off the public.
   Engine, or equipment manufacturers can not legally specify *brands* of oils.
Only RATINGS of oils.
    Yes, there are indeed differences amongst brands of oils in a given rating
, i.e. TC-W3.  A lubricant rating ensures a *minimum* standard.  There are
lubricant manufacturers that are not content with manufacturing lubricants
to minimum standards, AMSOIL INC. being one of them with their complete line
os superior quality synthetic lubricants.
    In general, any synthetic TC-W3 oil is going to perform much better than
any petroleum TC-W3 oil, without question.  High quality synthetic oils also
can save some money for the consumer.  But then, better quality products
ususally do.

Thanks Steve for the additional input, however, TCW3 oil is not a
synthetic, it is a natural oil and the formulation &quot;TCW3 code 3-15020&quot;
means that it is a natural ashless oil used in low temp outboards. 

TCW3 oils blended with a synthetic are no longer a true TCW3 code
3-15020 oil. 

Once Again, there is no difference amoung the brands of TCW3 oils
using the approval code of 3-15020. The only difference in the oil is
the Price you pay for the label. 

Folks, its your money - demand more, and If you are looking for a low
cost TCW3 oil with code 3-15020 contact me via E-mail and I will
provide you with information on both product &amp; pricing. For those
outside the USA pricing information may take a little longer.

Synthetics and Synthetic blends on the other hand perform far better
in high or extreme temps such as racing engines, snowmobiles,
cahinsaws, ect.

  Then why am I looking at a bottle of synthetic 2-cycle oil that clearly
states is is TC-W3? You might want to look into checking that.  TC-W3
does
not automatically denote a petroleum oil.   It is simply a performance rating
for an oil and there are many synthetic oils out there that are TC-W3 rated,
AMSOIL included.

I believe that code 3-15020 is the certificate number for a particular 
manufacturer.  It will be different for each brand of TCW3.  I was in a 
store last week and looked for this.  Three brands on the shelf that were 
TCW3 all had different certificate numbers.  Am I right???

If price is your only criteria.

True.

Mercury Marine sells three different types of TC3 oil.  One of their
publications even rates these three oils on a 1-10 scale according to
a set of criteria.  In some cases, say carbon buildup, they might rate
one oil as a 7, one as a 9, and one as a 10.  All three passed the TC3
test, which might have had a cutoff of 5 for this criteria.

Some people buy a boat and use it only once or twice a year.
Some people buy a boat and use it an average of 50 times a year.
Some people buy a boat and use it every day for work.

Its a matter of how much carbon buildup, how much piston wear, etc.
you want or need.  Lubrication is more critical for some horsepower
and design of engines than for others.  It's too late when you have a
broken piston ring and/or a scored cylinder.

I'm tired of defending the OEM's TC3 oils to people that want to think
that all TC3 oil provides the same amount of engine protection.  
If someone can provide some FACTS, I'll be the first one to point the
finger (you know which one) and raise hell with the OEMs.
Until then, the FACTS that I have seen indicate that all TC3 oils are 
not the same.  Certain additives, which are expensive, provide more
protection.  The OEM's do not start the oil design process trying to
design the cheapest oil which will pass the test.  They are looking
for oils which will protect their engines and also be affordable.

As they say, your mileage may vary.... and the quality of the oil you
use in your engine is one reason why!

There is a big difference between TC-W3 oils. Some blends barely meet
the specification, others exceed it. Those sold by the outboard companies
tend to be the best because they are formulated to meet the powerhead's 
individual requirements. In other words, Mercury oil in black engines, 
OMC oil in Evinrudes and Johnsons.

&gt; 
I'm sure some others will have a lot to say about this but I'll put in my 
2 pennies worth....Most of the TCW3's are blended by the same oil 
companies to meet the requirements of the TCW3, however the engine 
manufacturers-OMC, Merc, Yamaha, Suzuki all (to the best of my knowledge) 
require additional ingredients to the basic formulae to improve 
performance of their oils to their specifications. In all the engines I 
rebuild for my customers I require them to be run on only the mfg.'s oils.

These oils burn much cleaner and therefore leave less deposits of carbon 
and gummy residue in the combustion cahmbers and also have less tendency 
of causing the rings to stick in their lands, therefore increasing the 
life of the engine.

They are all the same.  TCW-III is a spec put together by a consortium of the
major engine builders.   They want you to but their own overpriced brand and
talk out of both sides of their mouths when they say that other oils made to
the spec they helped write are somehow not as good.

PMFJ,

the TCW3 specification is a minimum quality standard. There are 
many different oils that are superior to others. Some oils just 
meet the specification and others exceed it, sometimes by a large 
margin.

All oils are NOT the same. The best ones are made by the motor 
manufacturers, who are blending the best oil to protect thier 
engines. Many other brands are made and sold solely for profits 
from oil sales. They don't always consider the protection of the 
engine and blend an oil that JUST meets the TCW3 specification.

For all those that doubt this your mechanics love you. For those 
that want to see it for themselves, run a &quot;cheap oil&quot; through 
your motor for approximately 100 hours then take it apart and 
look, not only at the wear, but also the carbon build up.

One final note. Find out what the cost of rebuilding your motor 
is. Then calculate how much &quot;cheap oil&quot; you would have to burn to 
save you the money it'll cost for a rebuild. Unless you are a 
commercial user you probably won't burn that much oil in your 
lifetime.

Good luck,          Peter Hopwood

Steve,

while the motor companies do not have blending labs, as you said, 
they do stipulate the precise formula that the contracted oil 
company must blend to. This blend is then tested by independent 
labs to verify that they do meet the motor manufacturer's 
prescribed formula. 

If you doubt that there is a difference I recommend that you have 
two different brands analyzed. This will be the most accurate 
method. However, it can be VERY expensive.

The fact is that there is a difference.

I was not aware of that law and apologize to you for being ignorant of 
it. In the future I will stipulate that if engine damage is the result of 
excess carbon buildup or stuck rings due to the use of lesser quqlity 
oils, the damage may be excluded. The end result we are looking for is a 
longer life for the engine and most importantly a satisfied customer who 
brings repeat business and a few friends back with him- a situation I 
have seemed to accomplished with my liberal warranty policy, so far.
Good Boating,
Tom

Hi Tim;
         Oil quality, (for warranty purposes), is determined by the
ratings of the oil, like TCWIII.  Not by the brand, for *warranty*
purposes anyway. :-)

This has been brought up before, but nobody's really addressed it
beyond, &quot;well, one guy I talked to said he heard....&quot;

Does anyone have any good, reliable information on this subject? 
Name brand TCW-III oils, e.g. Mercury Quicksilver, is bloody
expensive, running $16-$19 a gallon. If you're use a big V6
outboard (150HP+) very often, this can add up to some real
money.

In contrast, Walmart's oil is $7 a gallon. TCW-III. Says right
there on the label, &quot;meets or exceeds all specifications.&quot; They
have Lubrimatic TCW-III for $8 a gallon.

Somebody here blurbed recently, &quot;you didn't take up boating to
save money.&quot; I think that's a little spurious. We didn't get to
the point of being able to afford a boat by being financially
reckless, either. If there's really no difference between these
cheaper oils and the &quot;name&quot; brands, if you're really just &quot;paying
for the name,&quot; when you shell out almost twenty bucks a jug full
for that Mercury Quicksilver, I want to know about it.

The local Johnson/Evinrude dealer in Pacific City, Oregon sells 
Johnson TCW-III oil in bulk for $10/gallon.  Maybe if you find
somebody that sells in bulk somewhere in *your* area???  Only 
problem is that you have to supply your own jugs (maybe some of
the left over jugs from all the oil you have bought in the past?

Hope this helps,

Be careful, in Atlanta, dealers have been &quot;caught&quot; selling TCW-II
as TCW-III, etc. Seems like you might be engaging in false
economy here.

FYI, Robin, one of the Yamaha factory reps that hits the shows
made several key points about oil:

	- The TCW-III spec is very tight. Any oil that meets
	TCW-III is acceptable.

	- The above comment is not true for TCW-II.

	- All three major brands (Merc/OMC/Yam) are produced by
	the same mfgs. Mainly the dye is different.

	- All three major brands worked together to develop the 
	TCW-III spec because II was so loose.

	- Fuel quality is as big of an issue. Additive for cars
	are usually not helpful to 2 strokes. They end up
	producing ash. They like Chevron and Texico gas, as they
	both have Chevron Techron. Yamaha also sells Ringfree,
	which is simply Techron. It is very good for the fuel
	system, and removing carbon deposits. (Caused by ash)

My feelings:

Avoid unmarked &quot;Bulk oil&quot;. TCW-II smells like ammonia as well. 

Use a quality brand of TCW-III. I use Yamalube, Castroil, and
texaco. Castroil and Texaco is cheap enough not to go with brand X.

How did that happen? There was a very distinct color difference in the 
OMC oils. The TCW-II was blue, the TCW-III was red and purple. My 
mechinic (OMC factory dealer) said that they dropped the red colored oil 
because the red dye used stained gel-coat.

Add red dye to blue TCW-II, and you get purple TCW-III looking stuff.

Suppose you had 2-3 55 gal drums of TCW-II stocked up, and out
comes TCW-III. Your old stuff is worthless. What do you do?

I buy my oil in sealed containers. :-)

 All the OMC TCW-III  oil I have bought (both bulk and in original
 packaging) has been red. I have spilled it on my gelcoat and it
 has not stained it. I would call OMC to get the facts before I bought
 blue OMC &quot;TCW-III&quot; oil. I have not see any dealer in South Florida
 selling TCW-III oil that was not red. I'm not saying your mechanic
 is wrong, but I would want indepedent verification before I believed it.

OMC makes two kinds of TCW III oil. One has a Johnson label on it 
and it is red. The other has an Evinrude label on it and it is blue. 
I talked with an OMC service rep(actually with OMC)a while ago, he 
said it is the same oil just dyed differently. Like Johnsons are 
white and Evinrudes are blue...

Mike,
What you here is correct in the coloring process.  I fish Professionaly on
the
Cabela's NAWA circuit and the question has come up by some of the anglers
that
run OMC's.

One word of caution with the new TCW-III oils is the grade of fuel that you 
run along with it.  With the new oil there is a lot of dtergent that is mixed
right in with it.  This is also true with the higher grade fuels.  We have 
been advised by Mercury and OMC not to mix the two.  If you run TCW-III run
a 87 or 88 Octoane.  If you run a TCW-II run a higher octane 90-92.

I run a 19'6&quot; Champion Walleye boat with a 225hp Mercury and have seen no
difference in performance going to the cheaper 87 octane fuel.

&gt;OMC makes two kinds of TCW III oil. One has a Johnson label on it 
&gt;and it is red. The other has an Evinrude label on it and it is blue. 
&gt;I talked with an OMC service rep(actually with OMC)a while ago, he 
&gt;said it is the same oil just dyed differently. Like Johnsons are 
&gt;white and Evinrudes are blue...

 I had always bought my oil from a Johnson dealer - I presumed the
 oil was red to differentiate TCW-III from TCW-II. Guess I was wrong.
 Seems that that would have been the sensible way for OMC to do it so
 that we could be sure we were getting the real thing.

I've been a river guide for many years and have always used Johnson oil 
until this year when I switched to Wal-mart TCW-III oil at something like 
$6.00 per gallon here in Alaska. Our motors tell NO difference!!! I have 
yet to change a plug or have any sign of problems. If an oil meets or 
exceeds the requirements----use it!

 The OMC TCW-II oil is blue while the TCW-III is red. Unless the dealers
 are dying the oil it would be tough for them to pass TCW-II off as TCW-III.
 I don't know if Yamaha or Mercury oil can be identified so easily.

 Most of the dealers that resell bulk oil in South Florida use it 
 as a loss leader - it features prominently in their ads and some
 have limits on the quantity they will sell to a customer. I don't think
 there is a great risk in buying it from a reputable dealer.

There is alot of mis-information about TC-W3 50:1 2-cycle oil.  I 
recently had the opportunity to discuss this with OMC, Mercury, and CITGO.
  CITGO formulates the oil for OMC, Mercury, Yamaha, and Suzuki to name a 
few.  They all agree that there is a difference in the protection 
provided by different  TC-W3 oils, even though they all exceed the TC-W3 
specifications.

Mercury, for example, now sells three different grades of TC-W3 oil.  
They sell a &quot;Premium&quot;, &quot;Premium Plus&quot;, and &quot;BIO-2&quot;.  Their TC-W3 
&quot;Premium&quot; oil is a formulation that is very close to their old TC-W2 
&quot;Premium&quot; oil, and it does pass the TC-W3 specification.  Their TC-W3 
&quot;Premium Plus&quot; has a different formulation with more additives for 
&quot;engine protection in extreme conditions and higher horsepower 
applications&quot;.  Mercury even has a matrix chart of the three oils graded 
according to 12 criteria.  For example, on the criteria &quot;Reduces carbon 
buildup in exhaust system&quot;, &quot;Premium&quot; rates a 7.0, &quot;Premium Plus&quot; rates a 
9.0, and &quot;BIO-2&quot; rates a 9.0.  On the criteria &quot;Provides increased 
lubrication and detergency to combat the effect of low-grade fuels in all 
brands and horsepower ranges of outboard engines&quot;, &quot;Premium&quot; rates a 7.5, 
&quot;Premium Plus&quot; rates a 9.0, and &quot;BIO-2&quot; rates a 8.5.

OMC's one and only TC-W3 lubricant is very close in additives to 
Mercury's &quot;Premium Plus&quot; grade of TC-W3 oil.  CITGO's &quot;Extra Range&quot; TC-W3 
oil is better than Mercury's TC-W3 &quot;Premium&quot;, but does not have as many 
additives as Mercury's TC-W3 &quot;Premium Plus&quot; oil.  The TC-W3 oils of 
Yamaha and Suzuki also have alot of additives like the OMC and Mercury 
&quot;Premium Plus&quot; TC-W3.

Conclusion:  There is a difference in different TC-W3 oils.

How do you know which to buy?  You need to decide what level of 
protection you need.  Do you know that you are using good quality fuel?  
If not, then you need an oil that provides additional protection.  How 
critical is engine lubrication to your engine?  If you have a high 
horsepower (70HP and higher) or will be using your engine under extreme 
conditions (extended full throttle operation), then you need the best oil 
that you can get.  The real problem is in determining which brands 
provide the best additives.  Too bad TC-W3 does not require a matrix 
showing how well a particular oil did on the criteria required for the 
specification.  A safe bet would be to buy the oil formulated buy the 
engine manufacturer.  It stands the best chance of being formulated to 
address the needs of your specific engine.       

I hope this helps!

&gt; Name brand TCW-III oils, e.g. Mercury Quicksilver, is bloody

I just purchased a 95 Johnson 150 FastStrike motor. In the owners manual
it mentions to use BIA Approved TCW-III oil. I neven mentioned that you
are required to use OMC or Mercury brands. 

I've read artical about using off brand oils and it said all you're doing
is paying for the name.

Finally, call OMC or Mercury's warranty number and ask them if using off
brand oil will void the warranty.

I know I will save money and buy and use less expensive, TCW-III oils.

I can't comment on TCW-III (I haven't experimented with the generic stuff), 
but in the days when TCW-II was king, there was a _LARGE_ difference between 
brands.  It showed up very quickly in fouled plugs, stuck rings, etc.

I've spoken with my mechanic (OMC) about this a couple of times. He 
claims that OMC has their oils made for them by someone else, the only 
difference is that they own exlusive rights to some of the additives that 
are used. The same applys to Merc and Yamaha oils. Some of other oils 
brands may have additives that work as well, maybe better but you just 
never know what's in 'em. I buy the OMC TCW-III from him in bulk for 
$10.38/gallon. I use so much fuel/bait/ice on a trip that I'll pay $3-4 
extra for the peace of mind to know that I have a quality oil in my 
reservior, but then again, I burn premium fuel when I can get it, 
anything that may/will extend the life of my motor is worth any resonable 
price. The idea of buying a new motor at ~$10,000 doesn't appeal to me 
one little bitty bit.

Well, I think you've said it all.  

It boils down to this....  TCWIII is TCWIII. Period, the end.  HOWEVER, 
if like myself, You've spent additional bucks for an extended warranty, 
best get down to the dealer and by the name brand bulk oil for a buck or 
two more a gallon.  ON THE OTHER HAND, if your not under warranty, Who is 
going to care.  Certainly not the manufacturer, your gonna pay the same 
for the repair regardless of whose oil your using.  So, it boils down to 
peace of mind.  For the record, I called Mercury about the ITASCA brand 
oil because of the advertised (meaning not verified) benefits to the 
ecology.  They would not say Itasca oil would void my 5 year warranty, 
they just restated the users manual &quot;use of other than QUICKSILVER oil 
may void your warranty&quot; line.  Bottom line.  If you are under warranty, 
make sure the oil you use has the right color die in it.  If not,  I'm 
sure it doesn't matter..  Your choice.  The Idea is to catch a fish, 
right?, not save a buck a gallon on oil.

Hope the fishin&quot; good and the run to &quot;em short!!!

This leads into another good subject....Fuels.  
I know you're not supposed to use any alcohol based fuels, but is there 
any advantage to using 89 octane vs. 87 in an old Johnson OB?  I've heard 
that if you use higher octane fuels in your car, that the engine can 
become octane dependant and start pinging if you quit using it.

I pulled the heads off my 200 plus hp merc. I was using merc/omc tcw3 at the
time. I turn any where from 4000 up to 7000 plus. The piston tops had very
little carbon and no scoring accured. I n this case I feel you get what
you pay for. I work ed on 5-6 6 clyinder outboards, I seem scoring/ and
clyinder damage, build up carbon in the exhaust chest. just buy the best you
can afford. I'am currently using ansoil. by the way my motor is oil injected.

&gt;&gt;the same as you pay for the Mercury down there.  And we only get 4
&gt;&gt;litres not a full gallon. 
&gt;
&gt;  I'd gladly take a full 4 litres having paid for only a gallon.

Not if it was an imperial gallon as it is here in Canada. (4.5 l)

There was a report done in one of the boating mags last year regarding
this.  While I don't have this mag or the report it went something like
this. (In everday language of course).. The oil classifications have
specs which must be met to qualify them for a specific grade i.e. TCW
II or TCWIII.  Within these specs lies a certain tolerance.  Best
described as .. If the oil was to carry a rating of TCWIII then it
would need to fall in the tolerance range of 5 - 10. This is where the
less expensive oils come into play.  They fall within the lower portion
of this tolerance range somewhere around 5 or 6.  Your name brands, and
BTW, Yamaha Lube was rated the highest, fall in the higher end of this
tolerance range. Does this answer your question ?? I'm not sure it did
but perhaps it helped.

One problem with &quot;store brand&quot; oils is that their quality is
not consistent from batch to batch. The big chains often buy
from different refiners at different times, so you may get
Texaco one time and Citgo the next.

I would stick to a name brand myself.

No, this isn't official info, but my nose doesn't lie. Smell the Quicksilver 
and then the Wal-mart or Lubrimatic and you'll find one 
difference..........Mercury puts ALOT of ammonia in as a cleaning solvent.
The dealer where I last bought an engine stated that some of the oils other 
than Quicksilver had a tendency to plug injection systems.........
  I usually alternate between the good stuff and the cheapies or mix it in the 
resevoir on my engine
It's a good question, though. Anyone out there from one of these companies????

Now, that's a classic example of the baloney I was referring to. For one
thing, I'll be you a dollar to a donut that that dealer was a mercury
dealer, right? He's not going to say, &quot;no, don't buy Mercury oil, buy
Evinrude oil...&quot;

So all those millions of people using &quot;other oils&quot; are running around
with plugged injection systems? I haven't noticed. The point about the
ammonia is noted, though.

My brothers in the oil and petroleum business and he's always used Texaco 
outboard oil and insisted that as long as the oil met the same specs it was 
the same. He finally convinced me and I was happily using &quot;other than Mercury&quot; 
oil for a while and then I ate a ring. The mechanic who worked on my boat told 
me he thought he could tell the difference between motors who'd used the 
quicksilver oil and those who hadn't.

Now what's the real story? I don't know. On one hand I know that Mercury 
doesn't own an oil refinery so someone else must manufacture their oil. But on 
the other hand when you're writing that check to pay for rebuilding your 
motor, some doubt sneaks in. 

I finally decided if I was going to pay for a motor overhaul ...It wasn't 
going to be because I was trying to save a few bucks on oil. I buy quicksilver 
from a dealer in bulk. There's not that much money to be saved and I at least 
won't have to listen to one of my smart fishin' buddies tell me how I screwed 
up if my motor breaks again.

Just a point for the anal-retentive. I understand its not good to

C'mon guys.  This is no different from buying a generic or house brand of
aspirin for 50% less than Bayer.

There is also a very high probablity that your favorite generic oil is EXACTLY the
same as one of the name-brands because they all ultimately come from the same
oil company (Exxon, Mobil, etc).  What's even funnier is that this may change
from year-to-year as these resellers change their suppliers due to better deals
or other business reasons.  So your WalMart oil may be OMC oil this year and
Yamalube next year.

The specs for oils are tight enough that you would have to run an engine for 100000
hours to see a difference between the upper and lower end.  The manufacturing
variance alone could easily account for an oil even from the same manufacturer
wandering between the low and high end of the various TCW-III specs.

This is all simply misplaced brand-name loyalty and succumbing to hype.  I 
challenge any reader to post proof that the brand-name oils are in fact better.

This is exactly the kind of response that led me to make the original post.
Do you, sir, have *any* factual basis on which to take this position, or is
this just knee-jerk jaw-wagging?

I'm reminded about hearing the same thing with regard to gasolines. Sure, a
lot of them come from the same source, but the difference is in what different
companies *do* with it. For example, cheap, off-brand gasolines may have a
half a dozen additives to improve its performance (rust inhibitors, what have
you). Top &quot;name&quot; brands like Exxon might have as many as *seventy* additives.
They might even change the formula to match a geographic location, in 
consideration of weather variations, that sort of thing. I got this information
from a book (I forgot the name) written by a former president of the Society
of Automotive Engineers on how to extend the life of your car.

So, it's entirely possible that even though different companies might get
their oil from the same source (&quot;Gulf&quot;), the actual oil that gets out on
the shelf might vary greatly between brands. One poster, for example, 
noticed a *greatly* enhanced odor of ammonia in Quicksilver, compared to
cheaper brands.

So for me, the jury's still out on this question.

This is a fact i pulled the heads on my 200 plus horse power Merc. I turn
600 rpm some of the time and over 7000 for short burst. using Omc/mer oil
there was no cylinder scoring and very little carbon on the piston tops.
If you use other brands, on test is to pull spark plug on look in the cylinders
for carbon build up. better yet pull the head and see if there is any scoring.

   Powerboat Reports article was my source - HOWEVER, in followups they have also
   taken the position that they would NOT take a position against the manufacturer's
   recommendation for the same reasons as stated in this thread.  It is just not
   worth running afoul of warranty problems when $10K+ engines are involved.



|&gt; So, it's entirely possible that even though different companies might get

   I'd like an opinion from someone who doesn't work in the petroleum industry.
   Sorry but I have a great deal of cynicism toward what drives American business.
   I don't believe the highly profitable oil companies spend their R&amp;D dollars
   tinkering with combinations of 70 additives so their gas will be &quot;just perfect&quot;
   (Yes they do adjust by region but it's very gross level adjustment).

   OMC/Merc/Yam were all involved in writing the TCW-III standard.  I can't see 
   that they would then take OEM oil to those specs and tinker with it (essentially
   saying that they didn't believe their own input to the spec) thus wasting lots
   of R&amp;D money when all they have to do is:  
        - Intimate the name brand is better
        - Suggest that since they make the engine, the oil must somehow be more
          closely match.
        - Suggest or outright state that you will have warranty problems***

   to insure sales of their high-profit-margin oil.


*** This is unenforceable in court - same as GM trying to tell you you void your
    can warranty if your don't use GM oil filters - they can't

I ran into the same problem earlier this year.  I spoke to the Mercury
High performance people and it was suggested that my warranty might be
voided if I did not use Quicksilver oils.  I have two 200 offshore Mercs
driving a Fountain 31 SFC and these motors burn oil and fuel rapidly when
we are running above cruise.  I belong to Sam's Club and Texaco TCWIII is
$16.90 for three gallons.  I called the Texaco people and was informed
that if Mercury required Quicksilver Oil, they would have to furnish the
oil for the period of the warranty.  I believe that it is the Magnunson
Act that requires the manufacturer to furnish required solvents.  The
people at Texaco were most helpful and furnished several papers on TCWIII
oils and indeed it seems that there is little difference in them other
than price.  I also read an article in Powerboat reports that indicated
that the real difference was between TCW II and TCW III.  I am using the
Texaco I buy from Sam's Club.  Good Fishing.

My Mercury dealer buys Mercury Quicksilver Oil in 55-gallon drums and 
resells it to his customers for about $9 a gallon, a little less if you
bring your own container.

I was in Walmart tonight and looked more closely at the labels for 
their house brand, Lubrimatic, and Quicksilver TCW-III oils. They
all say, &quot;EXCEEDS WARRANTY REQUIREMENTS.&quot; They also all claim to

No. Minimums are minimums, not an indication of relative quality.

I'd like to know _what_ these minimum requirements are, and what the

I just bought Chevron Delo 400 30w for $6.75/Gallon in cases of six (6).
I bought two cases thru my local marine distributor.  Delo 400 has been
'widely' recommended to me by people I respect and 'exceeds' the so-called
requirements for my Ford Diesel engines.  They also make a multi-grade
version of Delo 400, but I won't get in to why I like straight 30w.
I would consider the Chevron product to be more reliable than some
generic from Walmart/'Discounts are us'.  I'm not convinced that
one must spend $10-20/Gal for some 'Marine' grade oil.  If I was going
to do that I'd buy Synthetic oil.  I believe synthetics are much better
than filtered dinasour juice, but figure that for my older main diesels
I'm better off to just change the oil/filter more often (~100hrs).  In
my 'newer' (100 hrs) Genset I do in fact use Mobil-1 10-30w because it
only holds a few quarts (instead of 14) and I think the service hours
are more harsh.
Just my $0.02

The club that I am in most people run Merc's from 150-225 XRi.  For the past two seasons I know that two of these peole have only used OMC TCW-III and have never had a problem.  The reason is that we have a local dealer that sells bulk OMC TCW-III for 9.95 a gallon.  

This dealer also claims that OMC and Quicksilver are the same, except for the die that is added.  He told me that both come from Gulf oil, and he knows of dealers getting OMC oil in Quicksilver jugs, and Quicksilver in OMC jugs.  

I have an 150 Intruder and he told me I could run either of these with no warranty problems, just don't buy the cheap stuff.  For $2.00 dollars a gallon difference I will continue to buy bulk from him.  

The one thing I can't figure out is if OMC and Quicksilver are the same, why is the best price on bulk Quicksivler in $13-14 range?

&gt;I have a 150 V6 and it doesn't use that much oil, about a gallon for

 Should be using less than that - I don't think any injection system
 uses more than a 50:1 ratio. Unless you run wide open all the time
 you should be using less than that.
  
 In South Florida many dealers buy oil in bulk (55-gallon drums) and
 will refill used oil containers for significantly less than the 
 price of an original 1-gallon container. I believe I pay $10-99
 a gallon for OMC TCW-III oil - I have seen it as low as $7-99.

I buy my TCW-III oil from a Boater's World store for around $9 a gallon. 
The store manager told me that according to the buyers for the company
that there are only two refineries in the U.S. that make the stuff and all
labels are a product of one or the other plant and the specs are
identical.  I can't say how factual this.  I have a 16 flats boat with a
Merc 90 and my father in law has a 16fter with a Yamaha 90.
I use lubramatic and he has yamalube for his.  His engine smokes less than
mine. Other than that we can't notice any difference.  Of coarse his
engine has 1800+ hours on it and mine 300 so maybe time will tell.

&gt;They may MEET all requirements but the name brands will EXCEED
&gt;the requirements. Spercifically ash residue. Mercury Quicksliver
&gt;has the lowest ash residue of any of them. I don't think any of the
&gt;others would void your warranty but......

Interestingly enough, the manufacturer of my SeaDoo (I know -
yuck, a PWC) recommends use of a low ash oil - NOT an ashless
type - go figure.

<hr>

Atlas Weathering Services Group in Chicago says elements of weathering that cause deterioration include sunlight, moisture, temperature, and pollutants. Currently the industry is working on validating some testing methods that take shorter times.<p>

Two basic types of testing are available: long term, real-time testing outdoors and accelerated artificial weathering both indoors and outdoors. South Florida Test Service (a Miami FL division of Atlas) provides real time sites at Miami FL and Whitman Arizona for subtropical and desert test conditions. The article has a photo of the main test site in Miami where nearly a million samples are tested daily. They also have smaller facilities for high altitude exposure (Prescott AZ), temperate climates with light industrial pollution (Chicago IL and Cedar Knolls NJ), temperate climate with acid rain (Louisville KY), and high moisture (Seattle).<p>

Outdoor weathering usually involves mounting products or test specimens on racks at fixed angles to the sun. The samples are evaluated at regular intervals. Indirect weathering (used to test color fastness and durability of indoor materials) involves exposing the materials under glass.<p>


Real time testing takes a great deal of time. Accelerated weathering is an attempt to reduce this time. Usually the test is specifically trying to find the damage caused by long term exposure to sunlight. Sunlight is a major cause of damage to plastics, textiles, paints, and other organic materials according to a spokesman from Q-Panel Company in Cleveland. Accelerated testing uses a variety of light sources to simulated sunlight and the damage it causes.<p>

Fresnel-reflecting solar-concentrator mirror systems are commonly used. Atlas has a machine called the EMMAQA that tracks the sun with its target board. This speeds up environmental testing up to 8 times. Several artificial lights have been tried in the past but they are expensive. Now fluorescent ultraviolet lights mimic the short UV wavelengths that cause the main damage to most materials. Some of the lights actually cause certain materials to fail that are "ok" in outdoor testing. The most reliable means of simulation is filtered xenon-arc lamps. Atlas also manufactures these.  They can be programmed for light - dark cycles, temperature and humidity, water spray, dew, and irradiance control and can hold more than 100 samples at once.<p>

Next to sunlight, humidity is the major concern. Environmental testing usually involves relative humidity, while industrial testing involves absolute humidities.  Panametrics in Waltham MA manufactures  a line of humidity sensors based on capacitive solid state sensors. Blue M Electric in Watertown WI manufactures ultra-low humidity, cascade humidity, and steady state chambers.<p>

The story also includes a photo of some output from Universal Software a program from Hunter Lab of Reston VA that displays, analyzes, and reports color-measurement results for paints, foods, plastics, textiles, and paper. It includes statistical process requirements and spreadsheet-type data displays.<p>

<center><H3>
   TOYOTA MAY HAVE THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD
</h3></center><P>

At an otherwise humdrum media reception in Tokyo on Nov. 8, a Toyota Motor Corp. executive, Finance Director Ryuji Araki, let slip a bit of information that sent shock waves through Detroit. He said a new engine his company is introducing has far fewer parts than the norm and could be as much as one-third cheaper to build. Immediately, faxes flew between Detroit and Tokyo as worried U.S. executives tried unsuccessfully to dope out what Toyota (which quickly went mum) has up its sleeve. The reason: Engines are rapidly becoming the new competitive battleground among cost-conscious auto makers. ''It is the next frontier in cost-cutting for all manufacturers,'' says Wesley Brown, auto consultant at CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich.<p>
''DELICATE BALANCE.'' Engines account for $1,500 to $5,000 of a car's total cost and can contain more than 1,000 parts. The quandary for Japanese auto makers is that they have built their reputations on developing costly, high-tech overhead cam engines that pack plenty of power into a small footprint. But Toyota realized two years ago that its engines had become too costly and complex, and initiated a program, known as PC21, to cut costs 50% by 2000. ''They have to strike a delicate balance between cutting cost and maintaining their reputation [for performance and quality],'' says Dave Andrea, an analyst with Roney & Co. in Detroit.<p>
   Just how to achieve big cost savings from engines is rekindling an old debate that pits General Motors Corp. against the rest of the industry. GM, because it could not afford to develop costly overhead cam engines, has stuck with the old push-rod design on most models. Such engines kick out lots of power and were the warhorses that made Detroit famous. Rods push upward from a camshaft located down in the engine's block and force open the valves that allow fuel and air into the cylinders. The problem is that push-rods historically have been gas-guzzlers and pollution-belchers. Overhead cams, by contrast, are peppy gas-sippers, because they push open the valves more efficiently, from the engine's top.<p>
   But GM has vastly improved the performance and fuel economy of push-rods and argues that such engines are the low-tech answer to the industry's affordability crisis. They're cheap to produce, for one thing, because they can have one-third fewer parts than overhead cam engines. ''Most of the American public has no idea what an overhead cam is,'' argues Don Pozniak, manager of technical applications for GM Powertrain Group. ''Your competitive advantage is in your pricing.''<p>
   Still, the rest of Detroit is taking the same road as the Japanese. By 2000, Ford and Chrysler will equip the majority of their vehicles with overhead cam engines. Indeed, on Nov. 12, Chrysler introduced a new family of overhead cam engines that are 10% more fuel-efficient and 25% more powerful than the mostly push-rod ones they replace. ''Eventually, GM will have to spend some money and get with the rest of the world,'' predicts James Clarke, Ford's chief engineer of advanced power-train development.<p>
   Some Detroiters optimistically speculate that Toyota will retreat to push-rod engines to achieve startling cost savings. But the greater fear is that Toyota has found a way to make its high-tech overhead cam engines much more cheaply. ''They may very well have made some breakthrough,'' says Francois Castaing, Chrysler's executive vice-president for engineering. If so, Detroit will once again be playing catch-up.<p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Toyota Motor Plans to Unveil<br>
Low-Cost Engine Next Month</h2>

<b></b></p>
<p>Toyota Motor Corp., the world's
most efficient auto maker, is about to unveil a new weapon -- the
dirt-cheap engine.</p>
<p>Japan's No. 1 auto maker says a new car it will introduce in Japan next
month will be equipped with a "simple and powerful" engine developed by
Toyota that will be one-third cheaper to produce because it has one-third
fewer parts.</p>
<p>Although Toyota isn't disclosing many details, auto-industry experts say
that means an engine that would normally cost about $600 to produce will
cost Toyota just $400. In an industry that tries to shave nickels and dimes
off production costs to seize any edge, that amounts to a huge competitive
advantage. And the potential weight savings could have a ripple effect on
the overall design of a car.</p>
<p>Toyota's extraordinary claim is certain to stun its rivals in the East
and the West -- particularly Detroit's Big Three auto makers. If it has
found ways to make itself even more efficient, Toyota has raised the bar
for rival auto makers that still hadn't caught up to Toyota's already-tough
standards.</p>
<p>"When you look at Toyota, and what they can bring to cost and
manufacturing efficiencies, they are always the benchmark," says Dave
Andrea, an auto industry analyst with Roney &amp; Co. in Detroit. "This
just ups the ante."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Savings Through Designs</b></p>
<p>Toyota's director of finance, Ryuji Araki, confirmed that Toyota is
seeking cost reductions through better designs. In addition to engines, Mr.
Araki said other "power-train" components such as transmissions, axles and
drive shafts are also being targeted, as well as vehicle platforms, or
chassis. That shifts Toyota's focus in cutting costs from the plant floor
-- where it has long led the industry -- to the drawing board.</p>
<p>The cost-cutting potential in most of Toyota's current designs "has been
played out," Mr. Araki said. "Now we need to change the platforms, and once
we do that, we'll see a strong effect" on profitability.</p>
<p>Already, Toyota says it saved $500 million during the six months ended
Sept. 30, mostly through design innovations adopted during vehicles'
concepts stage. Such claims are unnerving for Detroit's auto makers, which
just last year were benefiting from a distinct pricing advantage over
Japanese rivals created by an usually strong yen.</p>
<p>The yen has since weakened against the dollar, while cost-cutting
efforts in the interim have made Japanese auto makers much more
competitive. Many 1997 models from Toyota,
Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Corp. made their debuts this fall with
freezes or cuts on base prices. That has sent U.S. auto makers such as
Ford Motor Co. scrambling to trim costs from key models such as
the Taurus sedan in a bid to remain price-competitive.</p>
<p>Toyota's competitors "are basically going to take it in the heart,
particularly if you can offer more value at a lower price," says Bill
Pochiluk, publisher of AutoFacts, an industry newsletter based in West
Chester, Pa.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Forward to the Past</b></p>
<p>Industry experts speculate that Toyota's new engine may be nothing more
than a simple push-rod engine. Such engines require fewer parts than the
high-tech, multivalve, overhead-cam engines that populate many of today's
vehicles, including most Toyotas. Although they cost hundreds of dollars
more per vehicle, such complex engines have been popular with consumers
because of their fuel economy and have been seen as a competitive
advantage.</p>
<p>General Motors Corp., however,
has won grudging praise in recent years for sticking with its old-tech
push-rod engines in the face of an industrywide rush to overhead-cam
technology. The No. 1 U.S. auto maker didn't have the money to invest in
developing new engines, so it put engineers to work solving push-rod
engines' fuel-economy and emissions problems -- in which they ultimately
succeeded.</p>
<p>There is some skepticism in the industry about Toyota's latest claims of
significant cost-cutting in engines. Jim Harbour, an auto-industry
consultant, says an austere engine from Toyota would represent a marked
departure from its recent strategy of giving its Camry and Corolla cars
near-luxury qualities.</p>
<p>"The Toyotas, Hondas and Nissans have put a lot of technology, content
and features into their cars to make them more palatable," Mr. Harbour
says. "I haven't seen them take a dime of cost out of anything."</p>
<p>Still, word of a new efficiency drive at Toyota is being taken seriously
by those who appreciate Toyota's culture. Toyota encourages engineers and
suppliers to hunt for big savings, not cost reductions of a few yen per
part. Suppliers also are given financial rewards based on the savings their
designs generate.</p>
<p>"This is just further and continuing evidence that Toyota is the master
out there at cost reduction," says Christopher Cedergren, an industry
analyst in Santa Ana, Calif.</p>
<p>Toyota's commitment to lower costs is also backed by a hefty
research-and-development budget. Research-and-development costs at Toyota
soared by 52.5 billion yen ($468.6 million) over original plans during the
six months ended Sept. 30 alone. It plans to sink 300 billion yen into
capital expenditures in the fiscal year that ends March 31.</p>

<B>Low-Emission Engines from Russia</B><p>

Technology: Three different engines, using different fuels: hydrogen, extracted within the engine from methanol, using catalysis and the heat of the exhaust; the axial engine, which automatically changes piston stroke depending on load, and comes in gasoline and diesel versions.
Markets: Automotive, trucks, small vehicles, stationary engines, aircraft.<BR><BR>
Advantages: The developers claim that the hydrogen engine can meet the zero-emissions requirement set for California and other states for 1998. By generating the hydrogen onboard, no new distribution and storage system is needed. Alternatively, the engine can run on methanol or other fuels directly. Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons are reduced by 99%, and NOx by 85%, according to the developers.<BR><BR>
	The axial engine, with its novel arrangement of five or seven cylinders, can reduce fuel consumption by 35-40%, engine weight by 30-40%, and emissions by 40-45%, compared to similar horsepower (120/130) gasoline engines.

<b><center><h4>Industry Research Desk</h4>
<h3>Sponsor Information Page</b></center></h3>
<p>

At this moment  (Mid December) we are focusing on trying to promote the site in various publications. The "How To Learn About .." page  is now well established and being used by many researchers. It provides an opportunity to reach business researchers in institutions, industries, and private practice around the globe. The Industry Home Pages page is still being developed and will be used by researchers as well as those in industry looking for a home page for their industry.  The Manufacturing Processes Home Pages page is also still rapidly adding content and will used by business researchers as well as those in industry trying to improve their processes and stay on 'the cutting edge". The pages available for Sponsorship have a small rectangular sponsor box in the top right corner and an advertising Banner in the middle of the page. Examples of them are shown below.<p>


<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="../artwork/sponsors/ssrchds.gif" WIDTH="145" HEIGHT=
"58" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>
<p><br><br><br.<br><br><br><br.<br><br><br><br.<br>


<CENTER><IMG WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="60" SRC="../artwork/sponsors/sblankb.gif" ></A></CENTER>
<p><p>

When visitors click on either box they will be sent to your web site and you can supply them with any information you desire. If you do not have a web site - we can establish one for you on this site. We would encourage you to establish your own web site with your provider and begin to apply this technology so you can grow with it. If you are unable to do that at this time, we can establish a site with some of your basic product or service information and provide your phone and fax numbers. We have the ability to scan photographs and brochures. E-mail us at 
<a href="mailto:polsongi@virtualpet.com">polsongi@virtualpet.com</A> or give us a call at (800) 443-6543 with your needs.<p>


We envision the small upper right sponsor box remaining at it is shown, and just adding your company name. The Banner Ad can included some basic information about your company and its products or services as well as any current specials. We can use your company colors and logos if desired. The banner is 60 X 468 Pixels and we can help you design it if you wish. We do not allow animations in the banner. <p>

Additionally have a <a href="sponsors.htm">sponsors page</A> (with the yellow box link in the Folders section of the Home Page) which lists all the current sponsors with links to their sites.


<hr>
We will be regulating the type of advertising on the site to make sure it is appropriate for and of interest to our users. Also will keep the site "G-Rated" so you don't have to worry about seeing some X-Rated Materials here or on those sites sponsoring our site. <p>




<hr>


Following is a list of pages on this site that are setup for Sponsorship.<p>


<ul>
<li>HOW TO LEARN ABOUT AN INDUSTRY OR A SPECIFIC COMPANY <p>

<li>INDUSTRY HOME PAGES<p>

<li>MANUFACTURING PROCESSES HOME PAGES<p>

<li>INDUSTRY DATA SOURCES PAGE<p>

<li>OFFICE TOOLS<p>

<li>SEARCH ENGINES - no ads on this page<p>

<li>INTRODUCTION TO THE INTERNET<p>

<center><h4>The Front Lines Column by Thomas Petzinger Jr.</h4></center>
<center><h4>14 July 1995</h4></center>
<center><b><h3>At Deere They Know A Mad Scientist May Be A Firm's Biggest Asset</h3></b></center>

Celebrate your eccentrics.<p>

They are under utilized corporate assets, too often dismissed as unmanageable loners who traffic in peculiarity. Yet with the slightest encouragement, eccentrics display a gift for conceiving the unforeseen - which explains why Deere & Co. is applying the science of sexual reproduction to the assembly of farm equipment.<p>

Meet Bill Fulkerson, staff analyst. A rumpled man who one taught math at Central Missouri State, he toiled anonymously in Deere's engineering labs for nearly two decades. He has received precisely one promotion over the years.<p>

But today he is a hero, recognized as a problem-solver extraordinaire by Deere's top executives. "They know who Bill Fulkerson is now," says Robert Wismer, Deere's corporate engineering director.<p>

The story involves planters, ungainly contraptions that farmers use to drop seeds into the soil. Some farmers want four-row planters, others 24-row planters or something in between. Some planters apply liquid fertilizer, others no fertilizer. A farmer can order a planter form Deere according to more that a million permutations. <p>

In bygone days, Deere filled orders from inventory, shipping planters in pieces for assembly by local dealers. But to enhance quality and cut inventories, Deere in 1992 began assembling at the factory. Workers were organized into self-directed teams, each devoted to a particular system on the planter with its endless combinations.<p>

Imagine an assembly line that produces Yugos, Jaguars and school buses each month, one after the other. Deere's scheduling challenge was no smaller. Half-assembled machines were soon bunching at one station while another remained idle. With incentive pay at stake, worker teams began bickering. In the scheduling department, frenzied staffers compiled spreadsheets by hand trying to smooth the flow of machines and reconcile it with the dispatching of delivery trucks.<p>

Deere had re-engineered itself into a corner. 'It became obvious we had an ongoing problem," says engineer Dick McKinnon. "I made some phone calls." One of the calls went to Bill Fulkerson.<p>

Purely by chance a short time earlier, a Deere executive had stopped by Mr. Fulkerson's cubicle. Looking at the mathematician's notoriously messy desk, the boss made a comment about a book on the emerging science of chaos theory, then wished him a Merry Christmas and walked away. That was in December 1992.<p>

Mr. Fulkerson responded by spending the holidays absorbed in the book He became enthralled with chaos theory, and soon the adjunct speciality of "complex systems" research. During a fact-finding mission to the University of Illinois, Mr. Fulkerson listened to a professor expound on complex-systems research involving genetics.<p>

Eureka! "It was kind of a visceral response," Mr. Fulkerson recalls. "It just clicked."<p> 

As species reproduce, those with the best characteristics tend to live long enough to reproduced themselves, gradually reducing the number of bad characteristics in the population. Scientists had begun modeling this process with formulas called <b>genetic algorithms</b>. <p>

Perhaps, Mr. Fulkerson thought, the algorithms could compile planter schedules. Instead of having people (or computers) randomly test schedules, perhaps the genetic algorithms could use an improvement in any one schedule as a basis for seeking a further improvement, until a near perfect schedule emerged.<p>

Mr. Fulkerson was energized. He had often felt discouraged at Deere, relegated to supporting other people's projects. He was 50 years old. "If I'm ever going to do anything on my own," he told himself, "now's the time."<p>

This was 1993, long before the Internet had been hijacked by  teenagers and voyeurs. Mr. Fulkerson found a site where scientist exchanged information about genetic algorithms. He posted a note.<p>

Did anyone, he asked , know anything about scheduling a production line? The answer came a week later.<p>

A high-tech defense contractor, Bolt Beranek & Newman Inc., had used genetic algorithms to schedule work at a U.S. Navy lab. The engineers on the project were planning to establish their own software company to develop commercial applications. They visited Moline and told Mr. Fulkerson they'd be delighted to make Deere their first commercial client.<p>

Though Mr. Fulkerson encountered skepticism within Deere, it was no match for the overall eagerness to cure the bottlenecks at the seeding division. A pilot system was developed on a PC adjacent to the loading dock. By last year, a former shop worker named Larry DeClerck was cranking up the software before going home each day, leaving the machine to "breed" more than 600,000 schedules, each an improvement over the last. Planters now flow smoothly through the assembly line, with monthly output up sharply. Overtime has nearly vanished.<p>

Mr. Fulkerson, meanwhile, has turned his attention to ant colonies and other subjects of "swarm" theory and what promise it might hold for manufacturing. His business card ways "project manager, adaptive manufacturing systems," but it's an invented position, he admits, a substitute for his official title, which remains staff analyst. "I haven't been promoted," But, he says, 'I'm having more fun."

<P>In the scheduling method disclosed herein, a genetic algorithm is employed
 to improve a population of possible schedules represented by respective
 chromosomes, where the chromosomes upon which the genetic algorithm
 operates are not a direct encoding of a possible schedules. Rather, the
 details of the scheduling problem and the real life constraints typically
 associated with such problems are hidden from the genetic algorithm by the
 use of a deterministic schedule builder which operates on lists of the
 desired tasks and which generates legal schedules, i.e. schedules which do
 not violate hard constraints. The legal schedules so generated are
 evaluated or scored and the scores are provided to the genetic algorithm
 as feedback for influencing subsequent operation of the genetic algorithm.

	The FUNNEL CHART illustrates how we select among leisure alternatives. Leisure alternatives begin at the top of the funnel. Steps in the process of leisure alternative selection are shown as levels in the funnel. Constraints are shown as filters between the various levels. The decreasing cross sectional area of the funnel indicates we may be capable of investigating several activities at their earlier stages but only a few at later stages. Time required to go "through the funnel" is typically dependent upon the financial and time requirements of the activity. The size of the PARTICIPANTS  RESERVOIR represents the capacity of the facilities and support structure (clubs, coaches, referees, leagues, newsletters) for the activity.<p>

	Once an activity is encountered with one of our senses we have an AWARENESS of it. We tend to prefer certain types of activities such as sports, home based (tv, reading, crafts), motorized vehicles, or nature activities. If the activity fits one of our leisure areas and does not involve anything we fear (heights, flying, water, darkness) we begin to gain KNOWLEDGE about it. We screen the activity with our demographic (sex, age, income, marital status) situation, our physical characteristics and abilities (sex, size, strength, left handed, blind, disabled), and local availability. If we don't see others who look like us participating, if our body is not "up to" the physical requirements of the activity, or the activity is not available locally we will usually drop our investigation. We also mentally use this filter when purchasing leisure items as gifts for others. Those who cease to progress at the various filters are DEFECTORS.<p>



	The next step is PARTICIPATION in the activity. In some cases we may only visualize ourselves participating. The quality of our first few experiences determines if we continue to progress toward LIKING the activity. We begin to compare it to other activities (alternatives) and  to develop PREFERENCES for it. Hassles consume time or money and must be done before or after participation in the activity such as purchasing a fishing license, paying a lake use fee, and cleaning fish. If we and our family continue to have good experiences with the activity, we decide if activity is worth  the value of time, money, and hassle required. If it is, we develop a CONVICTION to purchase the needed equipment or services and participate more fully. High ticket items will often require approval of your spouse and financial arrangements. Some time consuming activities may be put off until more leisure time is available. When the decision to buy is reached we begin SHOPPING for one or more suppliers of new or used equipment or services. Brands, models, and options are compared to select the attributes needed which may include soft side issues such as warranty, service, and financing. Some general shopping is usually done at earlier stages but the major shopping decisions are made at this time. If the proper equipment or service is available at a fair price we will PURCHASE it.<p>


	After acquiring the equipment or service we become NORMAL PARTICIPANTS in the activity. Typically 15 to 25% of the normal participants develop a zeal for the activity and desire to commit additional time and resources to it. They purchase the latest equipment, subscribe to magazines, join clubs, talk with others about the activity, influence new people to join in the activity, advise others in equipment selection, and account for almost 75% of  the participation in the activity. This RECREATIONAL SPECIALIZATION often begins to focus on a specific area of the activity. A few become highly skilled PROFESSIONALS. Once in the professional or recreational specialization groups, individuals may regress to the prior level. Some participants will  EVAPORATE (cease to participate) from a leisure activity due to age and other causes. Others may be driven off by OVERCROWDING of the facilities or support structure.<p>



	The funnel chart can be used to forecast participation, equipment, and facility needs. Equipment manufacturer's, sports organizations, and rec directors can use the chart to identify ways to increase participation. <p>

<center><h3>Census Concentration Ratio Page</h3></center>

 "Concentration Ratios"  indicate what percentage of the total business in a four digit SIC code is being done by the largest firms in the industry. <p>

The Manufacturing Census  report is called "Concentration Ratios in Manufacturing" and is numbered MC(yr)-S-6 (where yr is last two digits of the census year). It indicates the percentage of business done by the top 4, 8,20, and 50 companies in each four digit SIC code industry. The full 1992 printed report is expected to be available in December of 1996; however, some of the data is already available on-line and we have provided it below.  More information about the Census of Manufactures is available at <a href="http://www.census.gov/pub/econ/www/ma0100.html">http://www.census.gov/pub/econ/www/mc0100.html</A>. You can read the page and then you can click on "VIEW" in the top left corner to move on into the census.<p>

Similarly the Retail Census has a report called 1992 Establishment & Firm Size Subject Series #RC92-S-1. This report provides information on the size of the companies, sales statistics, employment size, multi-unit info, payroll, and concentration of the largest firms. We have copied the concentration information pertaining to Boat Dealers to our Concentration Ratio Page.<p>

If you try comparing your firm to this data, be sure to use your 1992 figures.<p>

Note the Boat Dealer industry is far less concentrated than the other 2 industries examined earlier (top 4 firms only account for 3.9% of the business). Also it is very apparent that most dealers only have one location. In the future we may post some "average calculations" with this data. Meanwhile, you might want to go ahead and calculate some of the averages yourself.<p>

The government requires a 12 character hull ID code on all boats built or sold in the U.S. The first 3 digits are called the MIC (Manufacturer's ID Code). These codes can be searched and provide addresses and phone numbers of boat builders either currently building or selling in the U.S. The codes are available on the MIC search page on the U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Navigational Center page. We have a link to the MIC search page in the <a href="../../../links/boatl.htm#boatref">Boat Reference Information segment </A>of our Boating Links page. You can search with one letter at a time to get all the manufacturers that begin with that letter.<p>
<hr>

The EPA also did a large boat population study before enacting the current legislation. The 1993 study is available in our <a href=../../../ftp/ftp.htm#popstudy>FTP section</A> and includes a great deal of boat size, length, horsepower information for various areas of the country. It consists of two large spreadsheets and a descriptive file.<p>

An older reference is the "Recreational Boating in the Continental United States in 1973 and 1976: The Nationwide Boating Survey" .  The final report was delivered March 1978. It was prepared for the U.S. Dept of Transportation, U.S. Coast Guard, Office of Boating Safety. The report is numbered  No. CG-B-003-78. Oklahoma State University Library call  #ETP57 CH5 CG-B no.78-3. It is an excellent report detailing the uses, types, quantities, ages and fuel consumption of boats in use at that time.<p>

Manufacturing USA is printed every few years by Gayle Research (800) 877-GALE. It takes industries by SIC code and delivers an number of statistics for them. It also identifies a number of companies in the industry, has data on the inputs (materials consumed) and the geographical distribution of the industry. SIC code 3519 is  for Internal Combustion Engines, nec (not elsewhere classified). This is where the marine engines are. SIC code 3732 covers the Boat Building and Repairing Industry and the book similarly covers the inputs and outputs of the industry and its geographical distribution. It also provides some ratio information for the industry such as the number of employees per establishment, payroll per employee, hours per production worker, shipments per employee, investment per employee, and investment per Production Worker. Oklahoma State Library call# 338.4767 M294.<p>

The government did a large study quite some time ago (published in 1984?) called, "Statistics on Outdoor Recreation" Part I, The Record through 1956. Edited by Marion Clawson. Part II, The Record since 1956. Edited by Carton S. Van Doren and Associates. Both parts have a section titled, "Sales of Boats, Motors, and Trailers as an index to Water-Based Recreation". Together, these two studies document the growth of the boating industry from the very beginning. <p>
<hr>

Price Waterhouse did a study for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Coast Guard in 1992 titled, "National Recreational Boating Survey". Most of the existing studies of annual sales. This study is of all the registered boats in existence. It has statistics on the size, type, propulsion units, and age of the boats. The age of boats is very useful data, in that it can be used to attempt to forecast replacement or disposal times. <p>
<hr>


Each January, Boating Industry Magazine prints the Boating Business Annual Statistical Review in its regular issue. This is the best single source of free data available. It pulls information from the various sources available and does an excellent job of graphically presenting the data. The resulting 10 to 15 pages of information are easy to understand and completely cover the industry. If you can only come up with one report of the industry, you need this one.<p>

<hr>
The state of Florida provides some nice boat registration statistics at a web site called, <a href="http://www.dep.state.fl.us/nwd/DEMANDS/E24BOATS.htm">Commercial and Recreational Boat Registrations</A>.<p>

<center><h3>1995 New Boat Sales Data</h3></center>

<hr>
 Our <a href="../ref.htm">Boat Building Industry Statistics <b>REFERENCES</b> Page</A> has extensive references to additional sources of marketing statistics in on-line and printed form. Many industry statistics are also available from our <a href="../../census/census.htm">Census Data Page</A>.

<hr>
<b>The data and information on this page come from the January 1996 issue of Boating Industry</b>. It has a special report in it which contains much more information than is reproduced here. It also contains clarifications for some of the data that is presented here. We are presenting portions of it so you can see the kind of data in  the report and "get a feel" for the whole industry. We strongly suggest you obtain the complete report. Most of the data originated with the NMMA (National Marine Manufacturers Association) and is for the U.S. only.<p>

<hr>

<b><h4>Introduction</h4></b><p>

The NMMA estimates retail pleasure boating expenditures increased by 22.4% in 1995, reaching $17,226,203,000. Looking at historical data and inflation, the organization recognizes that boating is loosing market share to other discretionary expenditures. They cite new boat expenditures declining from 6% of disposable income in 1980 to 4% of disposable income in 1993.<p>

To encourage growth they are encouraging expansion beyond the traditional white middle aged male market. PWC sales were up 40% in 1995 to 200,000 units. This is an example of expanding the traditional market. <p>

The price of outboards was influenced by the increase in the costs for aluminum. Unit sales were up 5% but average cost was up 21% to $6,175. This is the first year the NMMA has reported jet boat sales. The 14,839 units had an average cost of $9,646 and were seen as a "step up" purchase for PWC riders.<p>


The total ownership of boats is reported graphically below. The difference between power units and boats is attributable to the use of twins or triples on some boats.<p>

<hr>

<b><h4>Stern Drive Boats</h4></b><p>

Stern drive boat sales increased 4% in 1995 to 93,600. Average boat costs were up 3.2% to $19,138. The 3 most popular sizes were reported to be 18-footers, 20-footers, and 22- to 23-footers with roughly 26, 23,an 15 % of the market respectively. Bowriders claimed 75% of all stern drive sales. Cruisers claim the bulk of the remaining units with boats over 28 feet getting twin installations.<p>

<hr>
<b><h4>Inboard Boats</h4></b><p>

Inboard Cruiser sales increased 30% to 5,460 with cost only increasing 1% to $214.195. Twin engines are found in more than 95% of these boats. Gas engines are favored under 40 feet and diesel engines dominate the over 40 foot market.<p>

Inboard Runabout sales decreased 4.1% to 6,900 units while their average cost increased 7.9 % to $21,400. Over 90% of these boats are tournament ski boats.<p>

<hr>
<b><h4>Jet Boats</h4></b><p>

!4,700 units were shipped by wholesalers. Motorsport dealers and boat dealers are both handling the units.<p>


<hr>
<b><h4>Exports</h4></b><p>

U.S. exports of American made recreational boats decreased 2.3% in <b>1994</b> to $507.2 million. Canada is our largest customer and also had a 15.5% increase in <b>1994 </b>to $134.7 million.<p>


<hr>
<b><h4>Imports</h4></b><p>

Boat imports increased 32.8% in <b>1994</b> to $564,346,000. Canadian manufacturers sent almost half of that ($274.2 million) to the U.S. being helped by the weaker Canadian dollar. Even with higher yen values Japanese imports increased 94.3% to $106.3 million strongly due to PWC's.<p>


<hr>
<b><h4>Marine Retailers</h4></b><p>

There are roughly 10,000 Marine Retailers. They are broken into categories in the graphic below.<p>

<p>
<br>

<hr>
<b><h4>Marinas & Yards</h4></b><p>

There are also  roughly 10,000 marinas and boat yards. They are broken into categories in the graphic below. <p>

The U.S. Dept of Commerce maintains the NTDB (National Trade Databank) which contains a wealth of boat industry market reports filed by overseas U.S. representatives. This is an exceptional collection of International Trade information.  Several of the older reports are accessible below. They and many more like them are accessible through the INQUERRY link in the Marketing Links segment of out Other Useful Links section. Just select the INQUERRY link, then select the demonstration link under the Inquerry heading. You can now word search the NTDB reports.<p>

<hr>

The information accessed above is often dated 1991 -1993. To access more current information you need to access the NTDB database itself, which is available at many public libraries. A link to an indepth discussion of the NTDB and an on-line access link are provided in the <a href="../../../../links/otherl.htm#international">International Business Research Links</A> segment of our Other Useful Links page.<p>

<P>
The accident happened about 6 p.m. EDT, shortly after the 
Baywatch water ski show, named after the popular television 
series, began before a crowd of 4,000 spectators. 
</P>

<P>
The show includes a simulated rescue scene where an actor 
jumps from the boat as it skips across the water in front of 
the crowd.
</P>

<P>
According to a Sea World spokeswoman, the boat "collided with 
the stadium."
</P>

<P>
Sea World spokesman Ted Molter said the injured ranged in age 
from 2 to 78.  Five were given medical attention at the 
scene, and 17 were taken to area hospitals, where at least 
four were listed in critical condition.
</P>

<P>
Molter said most of the injured were treated for bumps and 
bruises.
</P>

<P>
Barry Benoit of Cortland, Ohio, who was sitting about 10 rows 
back from where the craft hit, said, "Everyone thought the 
boat would just continue on. But then it went right up, maybe 
three or four rows deep. It hit a lot of people and you could 
hear the thud as it went into the grandstands."
</P>

<P>
"All around, everyone just stood up and was looking at this 
and  kind of gawking and wandering if this could be part of 
the show," Benoit said.
</P>

<P>
A man on board jumped out of the boat as it crashed. He was 
not injured. Other actors in the show ran into the stands, 
lifted the boat up and helped rescue people caught under it.
</P>

<P>
"The women were screaming and the men started running down to 
help," Kerri Tykare of Cortland said.
</P>

<P>
Sea World of Ohio is operated by the Busch Entertainment 
Division of Anheuser-Busch Inc. of St. Louis, and is located 
about 20 miles southeast of Cleveland.

<center><h2>CNN - Mechanical failure blamed for boat accident<br>
at Sea World - Aug. 19, 1996</h2></center>

 AURORA, Ohio (AP) -- Sea World canceled ski shows at all four of  its parks after a 1,500-pound speedboat careened into a lakeside  grandstand, injuring 23 people who were expecting only to be splashed.  <p>

State investigators on Sunday blamed the accident on a mechanical failure. They declined to elaborate. <p>

 Videotape of Saturday's show showed the operator turning the  steering wheel away from the crowd. The 18-foot boat failed to   cooperate, however, and instead hit a guard rail, became airborne and crashed five rows deep into the grandstand at Sea World of   Ohio.  <p>      "It looked to me like someone lost control even though at first I thought it was a stunt," said Don Glassmire, 44, of Coudersport, Pennsylvania, one of 4,000 spectators watching the show on Geauga Lake.   <p>

The boat's driver passed drug and alcohol tests ordered by police after the accident, said Stephen D. LeResche, vice president  of public communications for Sea World's parent, Anheuser-Busch  Inc. of St. Louis.  <p>

Four people remained hospitalized Monday, one in critical  condition. The others had been released after treatment for cuts  and bruises.   <p> 

The Busch Entertainment Corporation, a division of   Anheuser-Busch, the nation's second-largest theme park operator,  runs Sea World parks in Aurora -- 22 miles southeast of Cleveland --  San Diego, San Antonio and Orlando, Florida.  <p>

 Sea World spokesman Fred Jacobs said ski shows were canceled  Sunday at the four parks. Other attractions remained open.  <p>     

 In the 35-minute Baywatch water ski show, an actor who appears to be operating the boat leaps from it to perform a rescue. The  boat -- actually piloted by a driver hidden from view -- is supposed  to veer toward the stands and splash the crowd before speeding out into the lake.  <p>

 Instead, the boat hit the guardrail in front of the grandstand. <p>    

"When it landed, my only thought was that the thing is on top  of people and that we need to do something," said John Clark, who was sitting about 12 feet from where the boat slammed into the   bleachers.  <p>  

He joined about 15 people, including actors from the show, who rushed to lift the 18-foot inboard motorboat off the trapped people. <p>    


 It was the first major accident at the park in 27 years, and the  first in 20 years of water ski shows, said Ted Molter, another Sea World spokesman.<p><p><p><em>Copyright 1996 Associated Press  All rights reserved.

<center><h3>Sea World boat crash caused by engine failure, investigators say</h3></center>

AURORA, Ohio (AP) - A power boat that vaulted into the grandstand at Sea world of Ohio, injuring 23 people, was missing a crucial part of its steering system, investigators said Monday.<p>

Videotape of Saturday's accident showed the operator turning the steering wheel, but the 18 foot boat stayed on a straight course toward shore, where it plowed five rows deep into the crowded grandstand on Geauga Lake.<p>

The jet-drive boat had lost part of its steering system sometime after the water-skiing performance began, the Ohio Division of Watercraft said.<p>

Jet-drive boats produce thrust by pumping a stream of water at high speed. The boat used Saturday lost part of a plate that steers the boat by controlling the direction of that stream of water, the agency said.<p>

"There was no steering control because of that," said division spokesman Dennis Evans.<p>

Ohio does not require a state inspection of boats used in such shows. Sea World shut down the ski shows at all four of its parks - Aurora, San Diego, San Antonio, and Orlando, Fla.- pending a safety review.<p>

The boat was owned by World Entertainment Services Inc. of Winter Park, Fla, which also provides performers and mechanics for TV's "Baywatch" and is responsible for maintaining the equipment, Sea World said.<p>

World Entertainment said only that it is cooperating with investigators.<p>

Four of the injured remain hospitalized, one in critical condition. The operator of the boat was not hurt.<p>

<h3>Movie Stunt Goes Bad, One Dead, Others Hurt</h3>

NAPLES, Fla, (AP) - A boat used in a stunt on the set of a Walt Disney movie careened out of control today and landed in a group of people, killing one person and injuring several others.<p>

Eyewitnesses described the victims as stunt men or extras for the movie "Gone Fishin", which stars Joe Pesci and Danny Glover.<p>

The number of people injured and the extent of their injuries was not immediately available, Collier County Sheriff's Sgt. Jimmy Snell.(sic)<p>

Details were sketchy, but officials said the boat was due to go up a ramp and fly through the air and land in a group of boats. Instead, it came off the ramp to one side and flipped upside-down.<p>

"Something went wrong and the boat landed in a crowd of people," Snell said.<p>

The movie, which also stars Rosanna Arquette,,, Lynn Whitfield, and Nick Brimble, is a comedy about what can go wrong when two New Jersey guys (Pesci and Glover) win a dream fishing trip to Florida.<p>

It was being filmed in the Big Cyprus Swamp, on the southwest tip of the state in the Everglades.<p>

<center><h3>1 Killed in Disney Film Stunt</h3></center>

NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- With cameras rolling, a boat being used for a stunt in a Disney comedy careened off a ramp and landed in a crowd of extras Tuesday, killing one person and injured four others.<p>

The scene in "Gone Fishin", starring Joe Pesci and Danny Glover, required the boat to go up a ramp, fly over a hedge of mangroves, land between two boats and stop in the water, said Collier County sheriffs Sgt. jimmy Snell.<p>

Instead, the boat came off to one side of the ramp and flipped upside-down, hitting the two boats, which then hit the extras.<p>

Stunt doubles for Pesci and Glover were in the boat, witnesses said. Extra Gary Beyrent and another extra who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they saw the stuntman for Glover dangling as the boats flipped off the ramp.<p>

"The last I saw him, he was clinging on with one hand to the boat while ... the two legs and his other arm were straight up in the air," the extra said. "He survived but I know he's injured."<p>

The Florida Marine Patrol identified the victim as Janet Wilder, 29. A police source said she was holding the hand of her stuntman husband, Scott, when hit.<p>

Neither Glover nor Pesci was believed hurt.<p>

The movie, which also stars Rosanna Arquette, Lynn Whitfield, and Nick Brimble, is about what can go wrong when two New Jersey guys (Pesci and Glover) win a dream fishing trip to Florida.<p>

It is being filmed in the Big Cypress Swamp on Florida's southwest tip in the Everglades.<p>

Numerous calls to a Disney publicist in Naples were not returned. Calls to Disney's film production headquarters in Los Angeles were referred to the Naples spokeswoman.<p>

On Monday, the crew filmed the aftermath of the boat scene in which the boat cleared the mangrove jump and careened into a bandstand  area where a bathing suit contest was being held, Beyrent said. On Tuesday, the filming was the jump itself.<p>


Interviewed for a story about  the film Monday, director Christopher Kane said he did't like the way the stunt came out.<p>

"It's not an exact science," he said."This particular frame has never been done before. Most times you do a stunt it's the first time it's been done. You're guessing how fast, how far."<p>

He said after Monday's shooting that the boat wasn't going fast enough, "so tomorrow it will probably go too fast and go further than we expected."<p>

"Beyrent said he and other extras were concerned they were in a dangerous position for Tuesday's shot.<p>

"I was standing there, like everyone else, saying I think we're a little too close for this," he said. "We didn't have any direction. They let us stand wherever we wanted.<p>

"They really didn't look into the other possibilities, if this guy doesn't hit this ramp right , where's this boat going to go?" Beyrent said. "It can only go right or left of this ramp. If it went right, Joe Pesci wouldn't be here anymore.<p>

The stunt wasn't the first fatal accident for Hollywood.<p>

On March 31, 1993, actor Brandon Lee was accidentally killed by a .44 \-caliber slug during the filming of "The Crow." The slug was fired from a prop gun that was supposed to be loaded with blanks.<p>

On January 3, 1992, a worker was crushed to death between two lighting equipment cranes on the set of the Kevin Costner movie "The Bodyguard."<p>

In 1982, actor Vic Morrow and two children were killed when a helicopter fell on them during filming of a special-effects sequence for the movie "The Twilight Zone."

<center><h3>Woman Killed in Movie Stunt Gone Awry</h3></center>
By Phil Long<br>
Herald Staff Writer<p>
It was to be a routine movie stunt: a runaway fishing boat jumps a ramp, goes airborne and bursts through a stand of mangrove trees.<p>

Bur filming for a Walt Disney comedy turned into a real-life tragedy near Naples on Tuesday when the vessel spun into a crowd of actors, killing a stunt woman who was standing in a fishing boat nearby holding hands with her husband.<p>

Four other stunt people were hurt by flying debris.<p>

The dead woman was identified as Janet Wilder, 29, of California. Her husband Scott was slightly injured. Also hurt were Glen WIlder, Tony Brubaker, and Roy Farfel, all from California, the Florida Marine Patrol reported.<p>

The accident occurred north of Goodland Bay about 15 miles south of Naples, near Marco Island.<p>

The movie being filmed was <i>Gone Fishin</i> which stars Joe Pesci, Danny Glover, and Rosanna Arquette. It's a comedy about what can go wrong when two New Jersey guys (Pesci and Glover)win a dream fishing trip to Florida.<p>

"Our entire crew is terribly saddened by the death of this talented performer." said Claire Raskin, spokesman for the Disney production company. "We extend our deepest sympathies to her family and friends."<p>

The stunt required the boat to go up a ramp, soar over a stand of mangrove trees and land between two boats, said Collier County Sherrifs Sgt. Jimmy Snell.<p>

But the boat apparently missed a V-shaped guide groove in the center of the ramp that would have kept it on the right path.<p>

It slid to one side, spun and flipped over, then smashed into two boats, which then hit the people. The two stunt actors in the airborne boats were not hurt.<p>

The site is a popular place for filming, said Don Bonsall, a worker at Goodland Bay Marina. He had pumped $10 worth of fuel into the 21-foot Ranger boat less than an hour before the 10:57 a.m. accident. The boat was powered by twin Mercury Outboards, he said.<p>

The Disney crew had been filming along the canal for about three weeks. There were usually more than 100 people around the site, Bonsall said.<p>

Interviewed Monday by the "E" Entertainment cable network, director Christopher Kane had said that he did't like the way the filming had been done for the second half of the stunt, in which the boat clears the mangroves and lands in the middle of a bathing suit contest.<p>

"It's not an exact science," Kane said in the interview, "This particular frame has never been done before. Most times you do a stunt, it's the first time it's been done. You're guessing how fast, how far."<p>

He said after Monday's shooting the boat wasn't going fast enough, "so tomorrow it will probably go too fast and go further than expected."<p>

<H3>Stunt woman killed during filming</H3>

<A HREF="disney.jpg"><IMG SRC="disney.gif" ALT="accident scene" ALIGN=right WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=113 border=1></A>

<P>NAPLES, Florida (CNN) - A stunt woman was killed and several 
others were injured when a boat flew out of control during 
the filming of a movie in south Florida. </P>

<P>The accident occurred in Big Cyprus Swamp in the Florida 
Everglades during the filming of the Disney movie "Gone 
Fishin'."  The boat was to go off a ramp and fly into a stand 
of mangrove trees.  It went off the side of the ramp, spun 
into two other boats and sent them into a group of observers. </P>

<P>Janet Wilder, 29, who was among the observers, died at the 
scene. Four others, including Wilder's husband, were injured. </P>

<P>"Our entire crew is terribly saddened by the death of this 
talented performer," said a spokeswoman for the local 
production company.  "We extend our deepest sympathies to her 
family and friends." </P>

<P>"Gone Fishin'," starring Joe Pesci and Danny Glover, is a 
buddy film in which two men take a weekend fishing trip 
together. </P>

<center><h3>A Darkened Spring</h3></center>
<center><h4>A Boating Mishap Takes the Lives of Two Cleveland Pitchers</h4></center>
<hr>
<pre>
People Weekly Magazine
5 April 1993
Vol. 39 No. 13
Pages 45 and 46
By William Plummer and Don Sider 
with additional reporting by Cindy Dampier, Johnny Dodd, and Ken Myers
</pre>
In the gathering gloom, Bob Feller, the greatest pitcher Cleveland has ever known, stood by the Florida lake and stared out at the long pier, as if trying to commit it to memory. "I'll have to tell people back home about where these young men ended their lives," said Feller, 74. "I wand to have the correct answers."<p>

Everybody in the game was searching for those answers last week in the wake of major league baseball's first fatalities since 1979, when Yankees' Thurman Munson crashed his Cessna Citation in Akron. On March 22, Cleveland pitchers Steve Olin, Tim Crews, and Bob Ojeda, out after dark on Clermont's Little Lake Nellie in Crews's 18-foot bass boat, hurled into the wooden pier at as much as 60 m.p.h. Olin, 27, the Indians top reliever, was killed instantly, Crews, 31, died of injuries the next morning at Orlando Regional Medical Center, Ojeda, 35, who suffered lacerations on the head, was spared and may soon be released from the hospital. Baseball's spring training, a time of hope and renewal for fans everywhere, was suddenly blighted with grief.<p>

It was meant to be a day of family fun. On their only day off from training, some Indian players planned trips to Universal Studios. But Ojeda and Olin - along with his wife, Patti, their 3-year-old daughter and 7-month-old twins - accepted Tim and Laurie Crews's invitation to join them and their three young kids at their new ranch, 25 miles outside Orlando. "Tim was so proud of the house," says Jim Macaluso, Crews's former coach at Tampa King HIgh School. "It was something he'd worked really hard for, and now he was going to just sit back and enjoy it."<p>

A fishing party, originally planned for the afternoon, was delayed by rain. A little after 7, Crews cranked up the 150-hp outboard and with Olin and Ojeda beside him, took a spin around the 125-acre lake before heading for shore to pick up buddy Perry Brismond. "I heard them hit something," Brismond told the press. But Brismond didn't know they were in trouble until he heard Ojeda screaming for help.<p>

According to reports, all three men's heads hit the pier, which stands three feet above the water's surface. The boat continued on, stopping 50 feet farther on a nearby grassy island. Investigators found its throttle almost fully open. They also found an unopened six-pack of beer and a "mostly filled" bottle of vodka.<p>

As Laurie Crews and Patti Olin turned their attention to their children and last Wednesday's memorial service in Winter Haven - and the team, with the help of a therapist, grappled with the tragedy - friends and mentors grieved openly. "I've known Timmy since he was 8 or 9 in Little League," says Macaluso, who describes Crews, who grew up in Tampa as a "caring, loving soul," an overachiever who made the majors on sheer desire.<p>

Just two Friday's ago, Macaluso organized a ceremony in which Tampa King High School retired Crews's uniform. "I don't know how many times Timmy came up-to thank me for the evening," says Macaluso. "I'd say, 'No, we're here to thank <i>you</i> tonight because we're so proud of you."<p>

Meanwhile, across the country in Vancouver, Wash., people were remembering Steve Olin. "We used to call him Yoda," says Dwight Boss, 29, a summer league teammate, referring to the gnomelike character in <i>Star Wars</i>, "because he was so skinny and had such little shoulders."<p>

During the off-season, Olin would return to Portland (Oreg.) State University, where he played college ball, to practice with coach Jack Dunn. "Our roles kind or reversed," says Dunn, "because he'd come back and show me the things he had learned in the majors. Before he left this year" Dunn continues, "I gave him a gin hug. It was at practice, and I was kind of afraid it might embarrass him in front of the other guys. But now I'm glad I did it."<p>

Heading to his car after his vigil at the pier, Feller put the terrible accident in perspective. "They were good men," said the leathery Hall of Famer, "But the game must go on. You've got to go on."<p>

<center><h3>The Ripples From Little Lake Nellie</h3></center>
<hr>

<pre>
Sports Illustrated July 12, 1993
Vol. 79 No. 2
Pages 18-31 plus cover photo
by Gary Smith
</pre>

This lengthy article begins with the header, "Four months after Cleveland pitchers Tim Crews and Steve Olin died in a boating accident, their families and friends are coming to grips with the grief that still washes over them."<p>

The Issues' cover full page photo of the two wives (Laurie Crews and Patti Olin) with their husbands jerseys is titled, "The Survivors - Loved ones and teammates try to cope with the tragic deaths of Cleveland Indian pitchers Steve Olin and Tim Crews.<p>

The article begins with a very large photo of the dock they hit and the Crews's home in the background.<p>

The article has very little about the accident in it. It focuses entirely upon the grief of friends and family and how they are learning to go on with their lives. It is an exceptional story and is probably the only story of this nature dealing with a boating death. It is further unique in that the deaths occurred within sight of one of the family's homes and their children still play on the dock. Dealing with situations like that can be terribly difficult. <p>

This article really re-raised the public awareness of the crash 4 months later. Due to the length and copyright of the article and the fact that it is easily obtainable in most libraries it is not reproduced here. We do hope to scan some of the photos in as time permits. Again it has essentially no information about the crash in it, it is instead an article about dealing with the aftermath of problems the crash created for the family and friends.<p>

<P>An improved liquid seal for a stern drive bell housing gear shift shaft.
 The upper end of the gear shift shaft is positioned within the designed
 water free drive shaft gimbal passageway in the bell housing while the
 majority of the remaining portion of the gear shift shaft extends through
 the adjacent exhaust passageway in the bell housing which is designed to
 have sea water passing therethrough. The seal is disposed within an
 aperture in the partition between the gimbal and exhaust passageways
 through and within which the gear shift shaft is held for operable
 rotation. The seal includes a rigid bushing having an upper and a lower
 portion, the upper portion adapted for forced watertight fit within the
 bell housing partition aperture. The lower portion of the seal is enlarged
 and adapted to sealably receive at least one replaceable enlarged
 annular-shaped water and oil seal which operably engages against the gear
 shift shaft.

Krylov Shipbuilding Research Institute, St Petersburg, Russia: An Update</H3>


<B>2. Summary</B><P>

Present newsletter provides an update on the home of Russian ship
research, the Krylov Shipbuilding Research Institute (KSRI), based on
my visit of its facilities on 14 and 15 May, 1996. <P>


<B>3. Background</B><P>

The Krylov Shipbuilding and Research Institute, which celebrated its
centenary two years ago, had been established in 1893 as a towing tank
facility for ship resistance and powering research--just as the US Navy's
Carderock Division of Naval Surface Warfare Center began as the Experimental
Model Basin (EMB) about the same time.  Much the same way as Carderock,
KSRI soon became a world leader in fundamental and applied research in
the fields of ship hydrodynamics, acoustics, structures, and related
systems.  During the 1940s this research center was named after Krylov,
a pioneer in mathematical formulation of ship wave resistance mechanisms.<P>

Today, research in ship and propulsor hydrodynamics still dominates the
activity at KSRI.  The facility in this area comprises a deep water towing
tank, a shallow water towing tank, a high-speed towing tank, a seakeeping
and maneuvering basin, a rotating-arm basin, five propulsor cavitation
tunnels, a cavitation basin, an ice model basin, a wind tunnel, and a
number of test units for pressure vessels.<P>


<B>4. Research Emphasis Today</B><P>


<I>4.1.1<b> High Speed Marine Propulsors</b></I><P>

Propulsors requiring special features for dynamically-supported high speed
marine vehicles have in the recent years received special attention
throughout the world.  The principal challenge in the design of such a
propulsor is in attaining a high efficiency at low speeds.  KSRI's most
notable development in this area has been that of the <b>Ventilated Waterjet
Propulsor.</b>  The design-point efficiency of this propulsor has been shown
to be higher than that of a subcavitating propeller.  However, ventilated
waterjets do have a problem in providing a steady craft acceleration at
intermediate speeds, which can be corrected by means of an active system
modifying blade hydrodynamics instantaneously.  However, this problem can
also be alleviated through design modifications allowing the propulsor to
operate in different hydrodynamic regimes at different speeds.  <u>There does
exist considerable interest among the KSRI scientists and management in a
US-Russian collaborative effort for further research on this concept.</u><P>

<I>4.1.2 <b>Ship Resistance Reduction by Gas Cavities on Hull Surface</b></I><P>

This is a KSRI concept towards which considerable effort is expended today
both in theoretical research and in towing-tank measurements for empirical
parameters.  Conceptually, this approach applies and maintains a gas film
separating a large part of the ship bottom from hull boundary layer, thereby
eliminating the associated skin-friction drag.  First introduced more
than a century ago, implementation of this concept has so far not been
possible because of the instability of such a gas film.  Beginning
with a two-dimensional development of theory and its experimental
validation, KSRI has extended this concept to three-dimensional hull
forms and obtained rather promising preliminary model test results.  There
is no particular interest on the part of KSRI at this time to extend this
project into a collaborative effort.<P>

<hr>


SCRIMP (Seeman Composite Resin Infusion Molding Process) is being tested as a hull forming method that reduces emissions and hand labor intensiveness.<p>

A recent NIST net posting discusses its status. The article is titled, <A href="http://spidey.nist.gov/atp/prev_comp/comp/9400/9402/94020033.htm">"High-Performance Composites for Large Commercial Structures" </A> describes an ongoing ARPA project..<p>

An <a href="http://sbir.gsfc.nasa.gov/95abstracts/06.01/951275.html">SBIR project involving SCRIMP</A> is also ongoing in the aircraft industry.<p>

A large sailboat has been built using the SCRIMP technology. Some nice photos of the construction are available on the web site <a href="http://paw.com/sail/jboats/j32updte.htm">http://paw.com/sail/jboats/j32updte.htm.<p>


<a href="5439635.htm">Patent 5,439,635</a> was recently granted for a bag used in the process.<p>

A basic article describing the current use of fiberglass in boat hulls, "Fiberglass: Just for the Hull of It" can be found in the July 27, 1995 issue of Machine Design on pages 54-58.<p>

<H3>IBM Wants Your Body<br>
For a Very Personal PC</H3><p>

By BART  ZIEGLER Staff Reporter <p>

LAS VEGAS -- It sounds a bit far-fetched, but an
International Business Machines Corp.
researcher has devised a way to transmit information via a tiny pocket
computer and current running through your body.</p>
<p>Using the setup, a person could send an electronic business card merely
by shaking hands with someone similarly equipped -- the name, address and
other data would be zapped from hand to hand, then to the other person's
pocket computer. The technology also could replace phone cards, allowing
your hand to transmit the calling-card number to the phone system when you
touch the receiver of a public phone.</p>
<p>The scheme devised by Tom Zimmerman may sound a bit crazy, but the
researcher has a track record in popularizing wild ideas: His "data glove"
became a hit for Mattel Inc., as a
way to manipulate Nintendo games by moving one's hand in the air while
wearing a special glove.</p>
<p><b>Electronic Identification</b></p>
<p>"Anything you touch you could be telling it electronically who you are,"
says Mr. Zimmerman of the IBM system, which stemmed from early work he did
with others at the Media Lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
before he joined IBM. He envisions the system replacing the jumble of
credit cards, identification cards, keys and other paraphernalia in
people's pockets.</p>
<p>IBM Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Louis V. Gerstner Jr. is so
enthusiastic that he has been trotting out the researcher before
closed-door gatherings of CEOs to demonstrate the electronic-handshake
trick. Mr. Zimmerman will reprise the role in public for the first time at
this week's giant Comdex computer trade show here.</p>
<p>In a demonstration, Mr. Zimmerman showed how the concept works. He held
a device about the size of a pack of cards, and this reporter placed a
slightly smaller device under one foot-this device in its early form needs
to make contact with the ground to ensure the weak electric current it
generates flows in the right direction. Then, when Mr. Zimmerman and the
reporter shook hands, Mr. Zimmerman's business-card information was
transferred from the device under the reporter's foot to the box Mr.
Zimmerman was holding. Then via a conventional wire, the information was
sent from the box to a laptop computer, where it could be viewed.</p>
<p><b>Charged Body</b></p>
<p>The system, which Mr. Zimmerman claims will be inexpensive, takes
advantage of the body's ability to transmit electricity. He says the
current his system uses from a battery is one-thousandth as strong as the
current created when a balloon is rubbed against a sweater to make it stick
on the wall. The system sends signals using a portion of the AM band below
the frequency used by radio transmissions, and transmits data about as fast
as a 2400-baud modem.</p>
<p>Among other uses, Mr. Zimmerman says his setup could create a "personal
area network" over one's body to link the various electronic devices a
person carries. For instance, it could allow a pager attached to one's belt
to transmit a phone number it receives to a cellular phone carried in a
pocket. The researcher even imagines a version of the small computers that
could be built into shoes, with the electricity to power them being
generated by a person's steps.</p>
<p>So far, though, it's all just a novel concept. Mr. Zimmerman filed a
patent application for the technology only last week, and IBM hasn't
decided whether it will commercialize it. But Mr. Zimmerman adds that "I
probably wouldn't be working as hard on it and IBM probably wouldn't have
filed a patent on it if it didn't think it could be a product."</p>

 AUSTRALIA - SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY PROFILE - IMI930121
 
 SUMMARY
 
 This article is derived from a telegraphic report dated 21 January 1993,
 prepared at the American Consulate - Perth.  It discusses the shipbuilding
 industry in western Australia.  The article consists of 2 pages.

 AMCONSUL PERTH
 
 SUBJECT: IMI: SHIPBUILDING ACTIVITY INCREASES IN WESTERN
 AUSTRALIA.
 
 1. THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN (WA) SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY IS
 SET TO CONTINUE ITS STEADY GROWTH OF THE PAST FEW YEARS.
 FIGURES RELEASED BY THE GOVERNMENT LATE LAST YEAR
 INDICATE THAT THE INDUSTRY NOW HAS AN ANNUAL TURNOVER OF
 USDOLS 175 MILLION AND EXPECTATIONS ARE IT WILL MORE
 DOUBLE THAT FIGURE BY THE TURN OF THE CENTURY.  MAJOR
 MARKETS FOR THE WA SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY ARE SOUTH EAST
 ASIA, GULF COUNTRIES AND BRITAIN.
 2. GROWTH HAS BEEN AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE IN
 THE AREAS OF ALUMINIUM PLEASURE CRAFT; MARINE POLICE
 PATROL <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG>; HIGH-SPEED <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> FOR OFFSHORE OIL SPILL
 RECOVERY; AIR CUSHION CATAMARANS; AND FERRIES CAPABLE OF
 CARRYING PASSENGERS/CARS/BUSES AND/OR TRUCKS.   REFITTING
 OF A GUIDED-MISSILE GAS-TURBINE POWERED FRIGATE IS ALSO
 UNDERWAY.  IF THIS MAJOR REFIT IS CARRIED OUT TO THE
 SATISFACTION OF THE ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY (RAN) THE
 CONTRACTORS ARE HOPEFUL IT WILL LEAD TO ON-GOING
 MAINTENANCE AND MAJOR REFIT CONTRACTS BEING AWARDED TO
 LOCAL COMPANIES, PARTICULARLY IF ADDITIONAL FRIGATES ARE
 BASED IN WA.
 3.  AUSTRALIAN CONTENT OF LOCALLY DESIGNED <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> IS ABOUT
 60-70 PERCENT, HOWEVER, MOST ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS ARE
 IMPORTED AS ARE THE ENGINES.  THE FOLLOWING COMPANIES ARE
 UNDERSTOOD TO BE NEGOTIATING CONTRACTS FOR THE

 DENMARK - PLEASURE <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> - ISA9302
 
 SUMMARY
 
 This article is derived from a report titled: "The Pleasure <STRONG>Boats</STRONG> Market in
 Denmark", dated February 1993, prepared by Inga Frederiksen, American
 Embassy - Copenhagen.  This article consists of 10 pages and contains the
 following subtopics:
 
     OVERVIEW
     STATISTICAL DATA
     MARKET ASSESSMENT
     BEST SALES PROSPECTS
     COMPETITIVE SITUATION
     MARKET ACCESS
     TRADE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A.  OVERVIEW
 
 The boating industry in Denmark has suffered much in recent years because of
 the effects of the unfavorable economy.  Danes previously traded their old
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> for new ones every fourth or fifth year, but because of the economic
 situation are presently reluctant to make such an investment in new <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 Most of the Danish-produced pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are currently being exported.
 
 Relative to the size of the country, Denmark is a large and well-respected
 producer of wind and motor-assisted <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  Total production of motorboats
 is relatively small (see "Important Statistical Notes").  The quality of
 Danish-produced pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> is excellent by industry standards, but
 Danish boatbuilders have encountered problems in selling their <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in
 Denmark due to the present downturn in the economy and unemployment
 uncertainty.  The companies are therefore making a strong effort to export
 their <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, and appear to be doing fairly well, as 801 units were exported
 in 1992, including some used <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 Among Danish buyers there seems to be a clear and growing preference for
 buying motorboats and the sailboat market has dropped commensurately.  The
 market seems to be slightly increasing for small motorboats and small
 sailboats, and the <STRONG>boat</STRONG>-chartering market also seems to be increasing.  The
 market for U.S.-built <STRONG>boats</STRONG> has become more favorable, because American
 boatbuilders are now producing <STRONG>boats</STRONG> to Nordic requirements and are keeping
 prices comparatively low by Danish standards.  High-quality <STRONG>boat</STRONG> equipment
 and accessories are required by Danish yachtsmen and this industry is
 well-represented in Denmark by local manufacturers.  Best sales prospects
 are to be found in: advanced electronic equipment, motors, GPS navigators,
 high-quality hardware, etc.

 IMPORTANT STATISTICAL NOTES:  Official Danish import/export statistics on
 pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are used, but local production statistics are estimates, as
 the official statistics are inadequate.  The total market is therefore
 estimated.  The import market share is also estimated, because the official
 Danish market share statistics by country for the whole of 1992 are not yet
 available.  The above statistics include the following Harmonized System
 (HS) codes: 8903.91.10.0, 8903.91.93.0, 8903.91.99.0, 8903.92.10.0,
 8903.92.91.0, 8903.92.99.0, 8903.99.91.0, 8903.99.99.0.  They do not include
 inflatable <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, small sailboats (max 100 kg.) and those with auxiliary
 motors, canoes, small rowing <STRONG>boats</STRONG> (under 100 kg.), kayaks, dinghies, and
 surfboards.
 
 
 C.  MARKET ASSESSMENT
 
 * Market Demand.  Denmark's population is slightly over 5 million people.
 Relative to the size of the country, it is a large producer of quality
 sailboats and cruising <STRONG>boats</STRONG> .  Additionally, Denmark is a respected
 manufacturer of electronic equipment and other accessories for the boating
 industry, despite the low level of local motorboat production.  This strong
 position in the industry stems from the high number of Danes who sail along
 Denmark's unusually long coastline.  Few Danes live more than an hour's
 drive from the sea.
 
 Unfortunately, the Danish pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> industry has suffered much in recent
 years.  The sailboat market has dropped 80 percent since 1986.  Cautious
 optimism is the guiding philosophy of the boating industry, despite fears
 that <STRONG>boat</STRONG> sales would be negatively affected by the unfavorable outlook for
 the global economy.  The motorboat market has, since 1986, been fairly
 good.  Danish-produced motorboats (length approx. 35-45 feet) are of high
 quality and relatively expensive compared with U.S.-produced <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  The
 price of second-hand <STRONG>boats</STRONG> dropped 20-30 percent in 1989, but <STRONG>boat</STRONG> prices
 are now stable.  The <STRONG>boat</STRONG> accessories market remains stable and is even
 increasing slightly, especially for the maintenance of used <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 There are several reasons why the Danish pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market may be
 interesting for U.S. companies.  Though the Danish market itself is small,
 Danish dealers (both at home and through their branch offices abroad) export
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> to other European countries.  The charter business has also begun to
 blossom (<STRONG>boats</STRONG> are being rented for 1 or 2 weeks).  As previously mentioned,
 there seems to be a tendency in Denmark towards buying motor-driven pleasure
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> instead of sailboats.  Water transportation and sea-to-land
 communication in Denmark is good and the exchange rates are favorable.  Tt
 is also anticipated that a watersports industry is emerging in Eastern
 Europe, which can be supplied by West European or U.S. companies.
 Unemployment in Denmark is presently high, and the estimated annual growth
 of <STRONG>boat</STRONG> sales for the next 3 years depends very much not only on local
 economic conditions, but on those in the rest of Europe.  If the situation
 improves and unemployment drops, the sailboat market could increase by
 approximately 10 percent and the total market by 2.5 percent (according to
 industry sources), due to the Danes' pent-up demand.
 
 * End-user Profile
 
 It is estimated that the total number of pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> (over 20 feet in
 length) in Denmark is around 40,000, of which approximately 25,000 are
 sailboats and 15,000 are motorboats and other types.  This total will
 probably remain unchanged.  However, many <STRONG>boats</STRONG> will be refurbished in 1993
 with new sails and possibly with new motors.
 
 Danish yachtsmen are considered some of the world's very best  and have
 proven it for generations at numerous small <STRONG>boat</STRONG> world championships and at
 the Olympic Games.  Many, therefore, make strict demands on the <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and
 the equipment they purchase.
 
 
 D.  BEST SALES PROSPECTS
 
 *Motorboats
 *Motor-assisted sailboats
 *Sailboats (small)
 *Accessories: Motors, electronic equipment, GPS navigators, high-quality
 hardware, etc.
 
 The market for small, reasonably priced motorboats and small sailboats is
 increasing, and the market for second-hand <STRONG>boats</STRONG> has increased
 considerably.  Best export markets for Danish pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are Germany
 (including the former Eastern Germany), Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, the
 Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, and Japan.  A new market is
 expected to emerge in Poland and the Baltic countries, especially for small
 and second-hand <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  These markets can also be serviced by Danish
 companies for U.S. manufacturers.
 
 E.  COMPETITIVE SITUATION
 
 * Domestic Production
 
 Denmark is a relatively large producer of quality sailboats and cruising
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, though the production of motorboats is small.  The <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market has
 suffered much in recent years.  Statistical data from 1992 show a
 considerable increase in Danish exports of pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, some of which
 were probably unsold <STRONG>boats</STRONG> from previous years, some were reexports and a
 considerable number were used <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 Most Danish-produced pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are exported worldwide.  The 1992
 estimates of major importers of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> from Denmark are: Germany 45 percent,
 Sweden 9.4 percent, Switzerland 7.2 percent, France 6.8 percent, Italy 6.6
 percent, The Netherlands 4.1 percent, the United Kingdom 3.5 percent and the
 United States only 0.9 percent.  The price of the Danish-produced <STRONG>boats</STRONG> is
 fairly high because of the high quality and labor costs.  A number of Danish
 boatbuilders have had to close down because of the decreased market.  Only
 approximately 20 boatbuilders are left, and they are doing reasonably well
 because most of their <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are exported.  Danish boatbuilders who are also
 in the repair business are doing fairly well, because the Danes are
 presently reluctant to spend money on new <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and are therefore
 maintaining and keeping their old <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, longer.  The sale of new sailboats
 within Denmark has almost stopped.  Only 10-15 percent of new Danish-built
 sailboats are being sold by Danish shipbuilders, compared with the figures
 in the good years of 1985-86.  The Danes are also producers of high quality
 electronic equipment and accessories for the boating industry.
 
 
 * Imports
 
 Total imports of pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> to Denmark for 1992 amounted to 15.2 million
 (sailboats, $6 million and motorboats and other <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, $9.2 million).  This
 represents a decrease of 68.2 percent compared with 1991.  Imports are
 estimated to decrease to $13.9 million in 1993.  The market is dominated by
 major suppliers from Sweden, the United States, Finland, and Norway.  It
 should be noted, however, that some of the imported <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are sold directly
 to end-users in other countries.
 
 * U.S. Market Position and Share
 
 According to estimated Danish statistics, the United States had, in 1992, a
 market share of 3.4 percent for sailboats (incl. motor-assisted sailboats)
 and 32 percent for motorboats and other <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  Some U.S. <STRONG>boat</STRONG> brands which
 are already in the Danish market are: Bayliner, Maxum,  Sea-Ray, MacGregor,
 Grand Banks, Formala, Regal, and Chaparral.  It is impossible to estimate a
 U.S. market share of <STRONG>boat</STRONG> accessories, but some of the companies already
 selling here are Mercury motors (American Marine Power), Johnson and
 Evinrude.
 
 The sale of American motorboats has definitely improved.  Part of the reason
 may be that American boatbuilders are now producing <STRONG>boats</STRONG> according to
 Nordic requirements and in their <STRONG>boat</STRONG> promotions in Europe are keeping
 prices comparatively low.  The low U.S. dollar rate is also a positive
 selling factor.
 
 * Competitive Factors
 
 The main competitive factors are effective marketing and reasonable price
 according to the quality of the <STRONG>boats</STRONG>/accessories.
 
 
 F.  MARKET ACCESS
 
 * Import Climate
 
 Denmark is a full member of the European Community (EC), and as such applies
 the EC external duty tariff to products entering from third countries.  Once
 cleared by customs of an EC country, goods may move duty-free within the
 EC.  There are no specific non-tariff barriers in Denmark, which might
 impede foreign competition.
 
 It should be mentioned that Denmark's Value Added Tax (VAT) at 25 percent,
 is the highest in the EC, whereas neighboring Germany, has the lowest VAT
 (15 percent).  This fact really hits the Danish <STRONG>boat</STRONG> retailers hard, and
 has resulted in the establishment of a number of Danish <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealers'
 offices in Germany (thus saving their customers 10 percent VAT).  The Danish
 Government is also suffering from this difference in the VAT between the two
 countries.  According to trade sources, a number of Danish-produced <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 will, because of the VAT, be exported to Germany and then reexported into
 Denmark in order to save the 10 percent difference.
 
 Danish businesspeople are very experienced in international trade, and
 virtually all have at least a working knowledge of spoken and written
 English.  Customs clearance is very quick and efficient, and the
 infrastructure of the country is excellent.
 
 U.S. companies may find it advantageous to use Denmark as a central
 distribution point/gateway for sales to the rest of Scandinavia and the
 Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.  Other possible export
 markets of interest serviced by Danish boatbuilders and dealers are Germany
 and Poland. Danish <STRONG>boat</STRONG> companies are active in the whole of Europe.
 
 No approval is required for the importation of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> into Denmark.  However,
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> for chartering must be approved by the Danish Maritime Authorities
 (Sofartsstyrelsen).  The import duty rates for pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are
 0 to 3.8 percent.
 
 * Distribution/Business Practices
 
 U.S. exporters of pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and accessories should consider entering
 the Danish market by appointing an agent or distributor or an exclusive
 agent for Scandinavia (or Northern Europe), because the Danes speak several
 languages and are very active in the international market due to the small
 size of their domestic market.
 
 * Financing
 
 The Danish currency, the Krone (DKK), is part of the European Monetary
 System (EMS), a European-wide monetary foreign exchange agreement set up for
 the purpose of stabilizing European currency.  There are no Danish foreign
 currency restrictions impeding the transfer of funds between Denmark and the
 United States.  Practically all Danish banks have correspondent banks in the
 United States.
 
 Terms of financing vary considerably depending on conditions of the
 agreement, such as volume of business, type of loan (whether <STRONG>boats</STRONG> or
 accessories), credit rating, etc.  It is recommended that all business be
 done on a secured basis, at least in the initial phase of a business
 relationship.  U.S. <STRONG>boat</STRONG> accessories manufacturers should eventually be
 expected to extend a credit of 30-60 days from date of invoice, and
 individual agreements and financing must be negotiated between the
 exporter/distributor with regard to <STRONG>boat</STRONG> purchases.
 
 The most active and well-known pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> financing institute in Denmark,
 So-Finans A/S (owned by the Danish bank Aktivbanken A/S), has recently
 ceased its financing activities.  The company was financing private
 purchases of pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> (of which approximately 80 to 90 percent were
 used <STRONG>boats</STRONG>).  A couple of other private <STRONG>boat</STRONG> financing companies are still
 in business, and offer financing of both used and new pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 Otherwise, financing of private pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> purchases in Denmark is a
 matter between a private individual and his or her commercial bank.

 SUMMARY:
 
 This article is derived from a report titled:  "The <STRONG>Boats</STRONG> and Accessories
 Market in Finland", dated April 1990, prepared by Tarja Kunnas, American
 Embassy, Helsinki.  This article consists of 3 pages and contains the
 following subtopics:

 Market Assessment
 
 When one discusses the Finnish pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market it is worth bearing some
 facts in mind: Finland is sparsely populated, the inhabitants amount to just
 under five million, and the northern climate makes the boating season very
 short. The waters remain free of ice half a year and even then the
 temperatures provide an enjoyable season for only a couple of months.  On
 the other hand, Finland enjoys a high standard of living, long and light
 summer nights and excellent boating conditions in its sheltered archipelago
 and thousands of lakes.
 
 According to the latest estimates there are some 700,000 watercraft in
 Finland (including canoes and rowing <STRONG>boats</STRONG>).  The high number of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in
 comparison with the population speaks of a long boating tradition and well
 developed <STRONG>boat</STRONG> markets.
 
 Sailboats do not need to be registered in Finland.  It is estimated that
 there are approx. 20,000 sailboats and about 90,000 registered motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 in Finland.  A law to make registration compulsory is under preparation
 which would exclude only small row <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and small <STRONG>boats</STRONG> with smaller
 outboard engines.  At present the total number of watercraft registered is
 expected to grow by 50,000 units a year.
 
 The <STRONG>boat</STRONG> industry has developed favourably during the past few years.
 Growth has been specially brisk in the domestic market and there are high
 expectations for the 1990 season.  The increase in the imports of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and
 yachts continued to the extent that half of all the <STRONG>boats</STRONG> sold in Finland in
 1989 were foreign-made.
 
 Four major import lines (Sea Ray, Bayliner, Wellcraft and Chris Craft)
 dominate the Finnish market.  In addition, there are dozens of small
 importers whose fate is questionable once the markets reach saturation.
 Although pre-eminent U.S. motorboats are not the only marine imports that
 are growing.  British powerboats of more than 30 ft are appearing in growing
 numbers.  On the sailboat side, Sweden has increased its sales of sailboats
 to Finland as well as Denmark and the United Kingdom.  Also French imports
 continue at a high level.
 
 According to local sources, sales of <STRONG>boat</STRONG> engines may reach 25,000 in 1990.
 After a six-year battle between Yamaha and OMC for the market lead, it is
 still difficult to determine which one is the market leader at present.
 Sales of big engines are still growing and the three-cylinder models between
 30 to 90 hp are particularly popular.  The average  engine rating is already
 clearly above 30 hp, having quadrupled in the past 15 years.
 
 1989 was the first time in history that the value of imports exceeded
 exports in the Finnish <STRONG>boat</STRONG> industry.  Adding to that the sales of engines,
 equipment, spare parts and services, the total retail sales came to nearly
 FIM 2 billion (USD 477.2 million).
 Imports of <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, principally motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, continued to rise sharply, and
 totalled FIM 220 million
 (USD 51 million) last year.  Nearly half of motor <STRONG>boat</STRONG> imports were from the
 United States with a visible increase in imports of U.S. fast motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 In Finland's <STRONG>boat</STRONG> business it is the dollar rate that plays a fundamental
 role in imports and exports.
 
 Competitive Situation
 
 Finland produces around 30,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> a year, including dinghies, ocean-going
 sailing yachts and motor sailers, sailboats and motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG> for leisure and
 work.  The Finnish boating industry manufactures a wide range of boating
 equipment and accessories including fittings, compasses and other
 instruments, heaters and ovens, foul weather gear and sailing clothes.
 Finnish <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are targetted to the local, chilly boating conditions; they
 feature hard enclosed cabins with heating systems to extend the short season.
 
 Finland's biggest motor <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturer is Flipper <STRONG>Boats</STRONG> which exports
 mainly to Sweden (55 percent) and the rest of Europe (10 percent).  The
 three big Finnish sailboat yards, Nautor, Baltic, and Siltala have
 traditionally exported up to 90 percent of their output, the most important
 market having been USA.
 
 Exports of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> from Finland grew 10.5 percent in 1989
 compared to 1988 and Finland exported <STRONG>boats</STRONG> to 40 countries.  The Nordic
 countries had the biggest market share (38.7 percent) of the value of total
 Finnish exports followed by United Kingdom (USD 10.4 million), France (USD
 8.1 million), Federal Republic of Germany (USD 5.6 million), United States
 (USD 4.9 million) and Italy (USD 3.1 million).  The biggest single market
 for Finnish <STRONG>boats</STRONG> continued to be Sweden.
 
 Total sales and exports of Finnish sailboats take up a substantial share of
 Finnish boating industry figures as a whole.  Sailboat manufacturers'
 expectations for 1990 are twofold.  On the one hand, the future appears
 somewhat bright though there are some dark aspects.  It is expected that:
 
 - sales to the southern Europe will increase (Italy, France)
 - sales to the U.S. will remain weak due to, among other things, an
 unfavourable rate of exchange
 - Germany will continue to have a strong market potential
 - export to Japan will increase (though currently low).
 
 The industry is much under the influence of labour costs and the strong rise
 in which weakens companies' competitiveness on the export market.  The
 prevailing high level of interest rates have also put a strain on both
 profitability and domestic sales.  The over-valued Finnish mark has also
 weakened export possibilities.

 Finland's import climate is favorable to the marketing of U.S.-made <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 and accessories.  However, according to local sources, Finnish companies who
 import <STRONG>boats</STRONG> from the EFTA countries and Ireland only have to pay the
 equalization tax (2 percent) and not the average import duty of 6.2 percent.
 
 The appointment of a local distributor is essential to a successful entry
 into the Finnish market.  It is counterproductive to appoint a regional
 distributor in Sweden or other Nordic country to service the Finnish market
 as well.  Finnish buyers are reluctant to deal with a representative located
 outside the country.
 
 Significant Trade Events
 
 The following event offers a good promotional venue for U.S. suppliers of
 U.S. <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and accessories:
 
 A.  HELSINKI INTERNATIONAL <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> SHOW - VENE 91 BAT
     February 8-17, 1991
     Organizer: The Finnish Fair Corporation
               on behalf of the Finnish <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> and
               Motor Association (FINNBOAT)
     Held at: Helsinki Fair Center (annually)
 
 Helsinki International <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Show was held at the Finnish Fair Center,
 February 9-18, 1990.  The exhibition had 369 domestic and 547 foreign
 exhibitors covering sail <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, <STRONG>boat</STRONG> engines, equipment,
 accessories etc.
 
 During the ten-day period a total of 115,908 visitors including 5686 with
 Trade Day cards as well as 1846 foreigners and 515 representatives of the
 press attended the exhibition.
 
 In addition to the major Helsinki International <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Show there are some
 smaller shows in Turku, Kuopio and Savonlinna.   Among floating exhibitions
 Helsinki rates as number one with Naantali a clear second.  Also, the first
 event in Savonlinna proved the need for the lake district to hold its own
 floating exhibition as it ranks high as a potential growth area.

 OVERVIEW
 
 The French boating industry is the largest in the European Community (EC)
 and the second largest in the world, after the United States.  This industry
 produces one fourth of the European nautical markets' turnover and one fifth
 of the European fleet is supplied by the French nautical industry.  Despite
 fears that <STRONG>boat</STRONG> sales would be negatively affected by the unfavorable
 outlook for the global economy, dealers and <STRONG>boat</STRONG> producers are reporting a
 brisk business.  France remains a strong market for U.S. motorboat exporters
 and trade sources seem confident that the U.S. share in France will keep
 growing due to superior technology and a competitive dollar.

 MARKET ASSESSMENT
 
 1. Market Demand
 
 The French pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> industry represents a brisk market in spite of the
 turbulence which has shaken the country's boatbuilding industry.  According
 to the French nautical trade association, the turnover in the pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 industry for 1990 is likely to reach $1.6 billion, up 6 percent from 1989
 figures.  Motorboats hold the strongest share with $440 million; of a total
 of 750,000 pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in use in France, 70 percent are motorboats.
 Demand for sailboats has decreased as motorboats have become increasingly
 popular.  18,500 motorboats were registered in 1990, an increase of five
 percent for the year, while the number of registered sailboats dropped from
 3,000 in 1989 to 2,660 in 1990.
 
 Overall, France has a per capita rate of one <STRONG>boat</STRONG> per 75 persons, which
 places France at the same level as Germany, but far behind the United States
 which has one <STRONG>boat</STRONG> for every 17 people.  National demand for motorboats
 remains strong (up 13.3 percent over 1989 figures).  Between 1987 and 1989,
 motorboat imports grew 200 percent with the United States taking on an
 increasing share of this very promising market.
 
 2 End-User Profile
 
 Over the past 10 years, a particular characteristic of the French nautical
 market has been that while French industry manufactures sailing <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, the
 French public is buying motorboats.  Over and beyond the fact that the
 industry is sensitive to economic ups and downs, this evolution reflects the
 changes introduced in recent years in the length of annual vacation in
 France.  While total vacation time is longer, the French tend to take their
 vacation in segments throughout the year.
 
 While sailing demands much time and effort, motorboats are easier and more
 practical for short periods.  40 percent of all motorboats are bought by the
 35-45 age group.  However, purchases by the older age bracket are rising,
 and consequently <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealers and manufacturers are beginning to highlight
 larger, longer, faster and fancier <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in ads appealing to consumers who
 purchased smaller <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in the 1980s.  The majority (64 percent in 1989) of
 motorboat owners live on the coast, 25 percent in the Paris and Lyon
 region.  Day excursions are by far the most popular form of use in France;
 only 20,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are used for "cruises" lasting more than two days.
 
 
 COMPETITIVE SITUATION
 
 1. Domestic Production
 
 Notwithstanding the decreasing number of domestic <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builders over the
 past ten years, 1989 registered an upturn with superior results both in the
 value of watercraft sales (24 percent higher than 1988) and in the number of
 units sold (7 percent higher).  An analysis of sales figures based on the
 top 20 boatbuilders in France shows an 11 percent increase in domestic sales
 and 39 percent increase in exports.
 
 
 There are currently 102 boatbuilders in France.  It is noteworthy that six
 of these account for 70 percent of total nautical sales and that the 10
 largest represent 80 percent of the market.  Production of motorboats in
 1989 registered an increase of 37.6 percent in value and 7 percent in the
 number of units when compared with the previous year.  As opposed to
 sailboats, half of which are exported, the motorboat industry builds for the
 French market.  However, French shipyards are handicapped by the lack of a
 national motor manufacturer, which affects their competitiveness.  For
 example, of the 37,000 outboard engine motors sold in 1989, all were
 imported.

 2. Imports.
 
 Motorboat imports (up 12 percent in sales value in 1990 over 1989 figures,
 and up 19 percent in number of units) supply approximately 40 percent of the
 domestic market.  The trend in France is toward bigger <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  Noteworthy
 was the 265 percent increase in total sales of motorboats over 12 meters in
 length between 1987-1989.  According to trade sources, demand for <STRONG>boats</STRONG> over
 12 meters in length will grow by 30 percent over the next three years,
 notwithstanding the lack of adequate infrastructure (e.g., marinas).

 The United States is France's second largest supplier of motorboats,
 preceded only by Italy (34 percent), and followed by the United Kingdom (21
 percent). In 1990, imports of U.S. motorboats totalled
 22 percent of overall imports, with a skyrocketing performance in 1990 (up
 98 percent over the previous year).
 
 France runs a sizeable deficit on the import of marine motors.  Total
 imports in this sector amounted to 570 million francs ($114 million) of
 which 50 percent represented outboard motors.  Belgium, where major U.S.
 companies have manufacturing facilities, is the main supplier of outboard
 motors to France.  The propulsion systems selected by French shipyards for
 powering their pleasureboats are used internationally and diesel engines are
 predominant in inboard and outboard <STRONG>boat</STRONG> configurations.  This trend is even
 more accentuated in France.  Fuel economy cannot be considered the only
 influencing factor.  The dominant criterion is safety and for this reason
 installation of two independent engines has become a standard at sea.
 
 Nautical motor construction in France is dominated by two major <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 builders, Jeanneau and Beneteau.  These two shipyards, specialized in the
 construction of both sail and motorboats, accomplish two-thirds of their
 overall sales through the construction of pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  Beneteau's total
 sales reached 900 million francs ($180 million) in 1990 and the company
 holds about 15 percent of the French motorboat market with its flyer type
 motorboat division (Beneteau has a U.S. operation based in Marion, S.C.).
 The Jeanneau firm, whose sales volume is equivalent to that of Beneteau, is
 the leading French motorboat manufacture and hopes to become one of the
 three European leaders with its "Prestige" speedboat units.
 
 
 MARKET ACCESS
 
 U.S. motorboat manufacturers are still enjoying a favorable import climate
 for their sales on the French market, with a particular emphasis on larger
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and high speed motorboats.  All types of U.S. motorboats (day
 cruisers, runabouts, motor-yachts and cabin cruisers) are faring very well.
 Due to lower production costs in the United States and the present favorable
 dollar exchange rate, this results in very competitive prices, except
 perhaps for small-size <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, where the transportation costs involved trim
 down the price advantage.
 
 -  Many observers at the Paris <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Show, held in December 1990, commented
 that U.S. production costs are about 20 percent lower than French costs, and
 thus U.S.-made motorboat sales are booming.
 
 One of the major concerns of the industry in the future is likely to be
 safety.  While boating is not subject to many of the restrictions that
 govern automobile driving, with the increasing number of boaters many
 coastal areas have become congested, resulting in a greater number of
 boating accidents.
 
 Distribution and Business Practices:  Domestic manufacturers usually sell
 directly to end users.  Imported <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are generally retailed by
 distributors who carry a full spectrum of product lines.  These importers
 tend to represent more than one manufacturer, frequently three or four,
 specializing in a specific product segment.  The ability to meet specific
 client needs for optional equipment as well as timely delivery are the most
 important factors for selling U.S. motorboats in France.
 
 The programs available through the US & Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)
 of the American Embassy in Paris also offer an excellent way for U.S. firms
 to enter this market.  In particular, the Gold Key Service, for a nominal
 fee, provides scheduled appointments with pre-qualified, pre-selected
 potential agents, distributors, joint venture partners and other French
 firms that can help ensure the success of the U.S. firm's product in
 France.  US&FCS Trade Specialists accompany our American Gold Key business
 visitors to all calls, help analyze the results of the meetings, and develop
 a campaign to maximize the opportunities that exist here.  For details on
 this and other US&FCS programs that can help your firm better understand and
 exploit this market, contact the Commercial Minister, American Embassy
 Paris, APO New York NY 09777, or the U.S. Department of Commerce District
 Office nearest you in the United States.
 
 Future Trends: France remains a significant market for U.S. motorboat
 exporters and should continue to expand over the next several years.
 However, the overall performance of the French economy will have a major
 impact on the market, since this industry is greatly influenced by consumer
 expectations and purchasing power.  With today's weak dollar, American <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 are great value and likely to remain so.
 
 Furthermore, by unifying the standards of its 12 member nations, the EC will
 become an easier market for U.S. <STRONG>boat</STRONG> exporters.  Currently, there is
 concern in the U.S. industry about what that standard will be.  The National
 Marine Manufacturers Association is presently lobbying to ensure that the EC
 adopts <STRONG>boat</STRONG> building standards compatible with those in the United States.
 
 Customs Duty and Import Requirements:
 
 All <STRONG>boats</STRONG> over two tons' gross gauge need a certificate of
 compliance/comformity issued by the French Naval Department.  It is normal
 practice for the importer/dealer to obtain homologation.  There are no
 custom duties for U.S. imported motorboats over 12 meters in length (approx.
 39 feet).  A 2.5 percent duty rate applies to <STRONG>boats</STRONG> less than 12 meters in
 length.  Motorboats carry a value-added-tax (VAT) at a standard rate of 18.6
 percent.
 
 If a company intends to sell its <STRONG>boats</STRONG> for use in French waters, the <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 must obtain approval of the French Maritime Bureau which, after inspection,
 issues the French importer with a "Homologation Certificate."  Only French
 nationals may apply for such approval.  All <STRONG>boats</STRONG> exceeding 12 meters in
 length require an import license issued by Safico, (a department within the
 French customs).

 SUMMARY
 
 This article is derived from a report titled: "The <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> and Marine
 Accessories Market in Germany", dated May 1990, prepared by S. Glar,
 American Consulate, Dusseldorf.  This article consists of 9 pages and
 contains the following subtopics:

 Statistical Data
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. MARKET ASSESSMENT
 
 This report is based on German production and foreign trade statistics for
 the following nine categories of the boating and marine accessories
 industry:  motor/pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, motor yachts, sailboats and sailing yachts,
 inflatable <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, small watercraft (rowing and paddle <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, canoes),
 surfboards, sails, outboard motors, nautical instruments and equipment.
 
 For 1989, the combined <STRONG>boat</STRONG> and marine accessories market in Germany totaled
 DM 715 million ($380.3 million).  German products accounted for 20.3% or DM
 145 million ($77.1 million) of the market while imports captured the lion's
 share with 79.7% or DM 570 million ($303.2 million).  In 1989, 77% or DM 485
 million ($260 million) of German manufactured <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and marine accessories
 were exported.
 
 Focusing on <STRONG>boats</STRONG> only, the German market amounted to DM 516 million ($274.5
 million).  Of this amount, domestic production supplied 32.2% or DM 166
 million ($88.3 million), while imports provided 67.8% or DM 350 million
 ($186.2 million).  German exports of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> reached DM 184 million ($97.9
 million), 52.6% of German <STRONG>boat</STRONG> production that year.
 
 According to industry experts, 1990 production of German <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and marine
 accessories might increase by 2 to 3%.  In addition, German exports are
 expected to grow slightly (about 1%), while imports are anticipated to grow
 3 - 5% that year.
 
 B. COMPETITIVE SITUATION
 
 Competition is strong in the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market in Germany.  Seven European nations
 and the USA supply 83.8% of German imports in this sector.  In 1989, the
 three leading suppliers of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> to Germany were the U.S., with an import
 market share of 19.6% or DM 68.7 million ($36.5 million);  The Netherlands,
 with an import market share of 18.6% or DM 65.2 million ($34.7 million); and
 the U.K., with 11% or DM 38.8 million ($20.6 million).  Closely following
 the top three were Sweden with 8.9% or DM 31.3 million ($16.6 million),
 France and Denmark, both with 7.9% or DM 27.7 million ($14.7).  In 1989, the
 U.S. changed places with The Netherlands, which until 1988 had been
 Germany's leading <STRONG>boat</STRONG> supplier.
 
 If <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and marine accessories imports are added, Germany's leading three
 suppliers were: the U.S. with DM 97.0 million ($51.6 million), The
 Netherlands with DM 74.8 million ($39.8 million) and Sweden with DM 71.5
 million ($38.0 million).
 
 German marine accessories imports totaled DM 220 million ($117 million) in
 1989.  The three leading suppliers to Germany in this market segment were
 Sweden, with an import market share of 18.3% or DM 40.2 million ($21.4
 million), followed by the U.S. with 12.9% or DM 28.3 million ($15 million),
 the U.K. with 11.4% or DM 25.0 million ($13.3 million), and Hong Kong, with
 10.6% or DM 23.3 million ($12.4 million).
 
 C. MARKET ACCESS
 
 Whereas <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are sold through <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealers in Germany, surfing equipment is
 sold through special surf retail shops, surf schools and the sports
 divisions of the department stores.  Below is a list (A) of some of the

 D. TRADE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES
 
 In Germany, trade fairs play an important role in product marketing.  U.S.
 companies wishing to enter the German market may wish to make their first
 approach through a major trade fair.  There are three important
 international trade fairs held annually in Germany in this sector:

 E. BEST SALES PROSPECTS
 
 The best sales potential during the period 1990-1993 for U.S. <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and
 marine accessories is expected to be in the following categories:
 SIC NUMBER                PRODUCT
 
 37322, 37325        Motorboats, cabin <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, motoryachts
 3662416             Radar equipment, marine electronics
 3662417             Marine navigational systems
 3429711             Marine hardware
 3732713             Sailboats
 3949598             Surfboards, windsurfing accessories
 During 1988/1989 German <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealers signed numerous new representation
 agreements with U.S. motorboat manufacturers.  At present, many German
 firms represent more than one U.S. company, some represent up to five U.S.
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> brands.  Since the representation capacities of most German <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 dealers are filled, US&FCS Dusseldorf does not anticipate that U.S. <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 manufacturers not yet represented in Germany will easily find a
 representative during 1990/1991.  Because of these tight capacities, recent
 ADS surveys done by US&FCS Dusseldorf on behalf of new-to-the-market U.S.
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturers revealed increased desinterest in additional U.S. <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 brands on the part of German <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealers.

                      Hong Kong         10.6%
 
 THE EC INTERNAL MARKET 1993
 
 German <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturers and <STRONG>boat</STRONG> importers/dealers do not expect their
 business to be affected to a large extent by the forthcoming EC Internal
 Market.  They believe however, that the already existing heavy competition
 will sharpen further and that price slumps will be the logical
 consequence.  The <STRONG>boat</STRONG> importers fear  the extreme U.S. Dollar fluctuations
 which affect their business much more than any imaginable evil of the
 future EC Internal Market possibly could.

 A. OVERVIEW
 
 This report covers the German market for pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> consisting of
 motorboats and yachts, sailboats and sailing yachts, small watercraft
 (rowing and paddle <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, canoes, kayaks) and inflatable <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 In 1991, the pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market in Germany totaled DM 660 million ($397.6
 million).  Domestic production accounted for 28.8% or DM 190 million ($114.5
 million) while imports captured the lion's share with 71.2% or DM 470
 million ($283.1 million). Exports reached DM 270 million ($162.7 million),
 or 58.7% of production.
 
 Almost two-thirds (65%) of German <STRONG>boat</STRONG> imports are motorboats and nearly 30%
 are sailboats.  The major supplier was the United States with 27.7%, or DM
 130 million ($78.3 million), an increase of 50.6% over 1990.  The
 Netherlands followed with 13.6% and France with 9.7%.
 
 Trade experts believe the market may grow by 3% in 1992 with a 2% growth in
 exports and 3 - 5% in imports.

 November 1991 issues, published by the Federal Statistics Office in
 Wiesbaden; production statistics were supplied by BWVS,
 Bundeswirtschaftsvereinigung Freizeitschiffahrt, Koeln).
 
 
 C.  MARKET ASSESSMENT
 
 In 1991, the German pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market developed well.  It increased 14.2%
 over 1990 to DM 660 million ($397.6 million), of which imports had a share
 of 71.2%, and local production supplied only 28.8%.
 
 German <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builders traditionally export a large share of their
 production.  In 1991, this export share was "only" 58.7%, due to sharp sales
 decreases in some of Germany's most important export markets.  The Gulf War
 and the civil war in Yugoslavia were mainly responsible for the German
 pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> industry's export losses in the Mediterranean markets in
 1991.  Demand was weak in other important export markets, such as France,
 the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States, as well, which suffered
 from marked economic recessions.  The decrease in exports was more than
 offset by a strong domestic demand.  The new eastern states' contribution to
 this demand was insignificant; interest from eastern Germany centered on
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> motors and other <STRONG>boat</STRONG> accessories rather than on new <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 U.S. motorboats play an important role in the German pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market;
 U.S. <STRONG>boat</STRONG> brands - as German <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturers grudgingly admit - control
 the market.  Almost every German <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealer sees to it that his product
 line includes at least one motorboat line from a U.S. manufacturer.
 
 Trade experts believe that the growth rates of 1991 (<STRONG>boat</STRONG> imports grew 19%
 over 1990, while the total market increased 14.2%) cannot be repeated in
 1992/93, since the market seems to be saturated.  They anticipate the German
 pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market will grow by about 3%.  Imports might increase 3 - 5%,
 while domestic production could grow 3%.  Exports might increase by 2% in
 1992. Considering the fact that U.S. motorboats sold exceptionally well in
 Germany during 1991 (imports increased 50% over 1990), <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealers believe
 that 1991's imports cannot be reached again in 1992 and might decrease about
 10%.

 E.  COMPETITIVE SITUATION
 
 In 1991, almost two-thirds (65%) or DM 305 million ($183.7 million) of the
 German <STRONG>boat</STRONG> import market amounting to DM 470 million ($283.1 million)
 resulted from motorboats, whereas sailboats had a share of nearly 30% or DM
 140 million ($84.3 million).
 
 Competition is strong.  In 1991, seven European nations and the United
 States supplied 81.2% of German <STRONG>boat</STRONG> imports.  The three leading suppliers
 of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> were the United States, with an import market share of 27.7% or DM
 130 million ($78.3 million); the Netherlands, with 13.6% or DM 64 million
 ($38.6 million); and France with 9.7% or DM 45.5 million ($27.4 million).
 Closely following the top three were the United Kingdom with 9.2% or DM 43.4
 million ($26.1 million), Sweden and Denmark with 5.9% and 5.6% of the German
 import market or DM 27.7 ($16.7 million) and DM 26.1 million ($15.7 million)
 respectively.  Norway and Italy tied for seventh place with DM 22.5 million
 ($13.6 million) each, or 4.8% of the German <STRONG>boat</STRONG> import market.
 
 <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> sales from the three Scandinavian countries consisted almost entirely
 of sailboats.  Other leading suppliers of sailboats were France, whose
 sailboat sales to Germany made up 60% of its <STRONG>boat</STRONG> exports to the country,
 and the Netherlands, whose sailboats had a share of 29% of its total <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 exports to Germany.  Two-thirds of the Netherlands' <STRONG>boat</STRONG> exports to Germany,
 however, consisted of motorboats/yachts.  Other important motorboat
 suppliers to Germany, beside the United States and the Netherlands, were the
 United Kingdom with DM 31.1 million ($18.7 million) and Italy with DM 16.7
 million ($10.1 million).
 
 In the German sailboat market, the United States does not play an important
 role as a supplier.  Scandinavian suppliers (such as Hallberg Rassy), French
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builders (such as Jeanneau and Beneteau), Dutch and, of course, German
 firms control the market. According to trade experts, U.S. sailing yachts,
 in general, do not meet the German preferance for sleek, fast, almost
 care-free fiberglass sailboats built by European competitors for sailing in
 rough waters and weather.  We suspect that this may reflect a lack of
 marketing by U.S. builders of such <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  The U.S. suppliers offer mostly
 traditional <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, often with extensive exterior woodwork and finishing.
 
 The United States does lead by far in the two most important sectors of the
 German motorboat market:
 
 a) motorboats up to 7.5 meters in length:
    German imports of U.S. motorboats reached about DM 58 million
    ($34.9 million), or 73.4% of total German imports in this class;
 
 b) motorboats of 7.5 meters to 12 meters in length:
    German imports from the U.S. amounted to DM 50 million
    ($30.1 million), or 32.5% of total imports in this class.
 
 In the "sportsboats" segment, the U.S. import market share was 36%, or DM 9
 million ($5.4 million).  In a fourth market segment, "oceangoing inboard
 motoryachts," the United States ranked second, after Italy, with 18.5% or DM
 8.8 million ($5.3 million).
 
 As can be seen from the attached list of leading <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealers, U.S.
 motorboats are well represented in Germany.  In fact, almost all U.S.
 manufacturers have a German representative.  Many dealers represent more
 than one U.S. company, and some sell up to five U.S. <STRONG>boat</STRONG> brands.  Since the
 representation capacities of most German <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealers are filled, U.S.
 motorboat manufacturers not yet represented in Germany will not easily find
 an agent during 1992/93.
 
 Germany is an exceptionally weak market for sport fishing <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, due to the
 fact that the country has only two relatively small strips of coast on the
 North and Baltic Seas, and about all lakes are closed to motorboating.
 There are two exceptions, Lake Constance and the Starnberger See, for which
 a limited number of motorboating licenses is issued, but even on these lakes
 fishing can only be done from shore and is not permitted from <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.

 In addition, a 14% import turnover tax is charged on all <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, which will
 be raised to 15% on January 1, 1993.
 
 There are no special ways of financing for pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in Germany.
 Payment within 30 days of receipt of shipment is the general rule.  Letters
 of credit, even irrevocable letters of credit, are customary with new
 customers.
 
 The majority of foreign <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturers sells through its German or other
 European distributors/dealers or agents.  Most U.S. motorboat manufacturers
 are represented.
 
 The EC Commission is working on a directive concerning recreational craft
 (<STRONG>boats</STRONG>), which it says will be effective January 1, 1994.  The German
 Boating Association, however, expects the EC directive's earliest possible
 date of implementation to be January 1, 1996.  The directive defines
 recreational craft as <STRONG>boats</STRONG> between 2.5 and 24 meters in length. The
 directive excludes racing craft (speedboats), commercial craft, kayaks,
 windsurfers, jet-skis, historical craft, experimental craft, submersibles,
 and air cushion vehicles.
 
 According to a June 1991 draft, there will be two essential requirements:
 For integrity and structure, and for installation. The integrity and
 structural requirements address the <STRONG>boat's</STRONG> structure, stability, buoyancy,
 carrying capacity, compartmentation, escape hatches, mooring and towing
 capabilities and removal of water.  The installation requirements comprise
 propulsion systems, fuel systems, gas systems, steering systems, electrical
 systems, fire protection, and navigation lights.
 
 The Commission foresees the need for approximately 35 standards for the
 implementation of the directive.  There are, at present, two issues still
 awaiting settlement:
 
 a) whether craft under 6 meters can be self-certified (if production is
 fewer than 20 units a year);
 
 b) whether the machine safety directive will continue to apply to inboard
 and outboard engines.
 
 On the U.S. side, Mr. Lars Granholm, Director of Engineering at the National
 Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA), 401 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 1150,
 Chicago, IL 60611, phone: (312) 8364747, worked with the EC technical
 committee that drafted the technical content of the directive.

 G.  TRADE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES
 
 In Germany, international trade fairs play the major role in product
 marketing, with an importance in the market far exceeding that of trade
 shows in the United States.  U.S. companies should consider participating,

 prelude for entering the German market, but for finding potential customers
 and representatives worldwide.  For manufacturers and exporters of pleasure
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, the most important trade fairs are:

 SUMMARY
 
 This article is derived from a report titled:  "The Pleasure <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Market in
 Greece", dated December 1990, prepared by George Bonanos, American Embassy,
 Athens.  This article consists of 11 pages and contains the following

 A.  OVERVIEW:
 
 As his flight touches down in Athens airport, a visitor looking out of his
 window and seeing the numerous tightly packed marinas can observe that there
 is a good market for pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in Greece.  Once on the ground and on
 his way to his hotel, the visitor sees <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealer after <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealer along
 the boulevard.  From a first glance, one would think that the pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 market is thriving.  In reality, certain difficulties, caused by a lack of
 infrastructure, set restrictions on the market's growth.
 
 Although most of the major foreign pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> firms are represented in
 Greece, U.S. firms can still find capable businessmen interested in
 generating sales for products new to the market.  U.S. firms, however, must
 be aware that pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are a luxury item in Greece and that their
 sales depend on people having extra money to spend.
 
 Presently, Greece's market for motorboats and cruisers is estimated to be
 around U.S. dollars 32 million and, its growth is expected to continue if
 peace and stability remain in the region (especially in the Gulf).
 
 U.S. firms hold nearly one third of the import market, and they lead the
 market for imported motorboats and small cruisers ranging from 6 to 8 meters
 in length.

 C. MARKET ASSESSMENT:
 
 Greece's total market for motorboats and cruisers in 1989 was estimated to
 be nearly U.S. dollars 29 million.  Nearly 40 percent of this market is
 supplied by imports.  The total market appears to have an annual growth
 rate of over 10 percent, while the growth of imports is expected to be
 double that; i.e. 20 percent per year.  However, imports from the United
 States are expected to grow at an even faster rate of 30 percent per year.
 Industry contacts explain that the reasons for this growth are the
 following:
 
 -    the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the drachma has been more
      favorable compared to the exchange rates of the British pound and the
      Italian lira;
 -    the U.S. <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builders have not increased their prices due to the
      industry's recessionary situation;
 -    Greek <STRONG>boat</STRONG> fans have realized the advantages and benefits of the
      guarantees which U.S. firms provide; and
 -    growth of the import market is achieved at the expense of domestic
      production.
 
 Industry contacts commenting further on the high receptivity to U.S.
 pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> explain that this is due the following factors:
 
 -    competitive price;
 -    product reliability;
 -    a belief that a U.S. manufacturer and his agent will honor guarantees;
      and
 -    high resale value.
 
 Although the overall picture for the market is very optimistic, there is one
 negative factor for at least 1991.  Some industry contacts express concern
 that due to the crisis in Gulf the market may actually fall in 1991.  This
 is because the Greek boating industry is heavily influenced by recession and
 higher fuel prices, both of which would be a likely outcome for Greece in
 the event of a war in the Gulf.
 
 As for actual market size, there is a significant difference between data
 concerning imports as presented by Greek and U.S. official statistics.
 There may be several explanations for the difference, such as U.S.
 statistics include Greek-owned vessels which end up under a foreign flag,
 while such <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are not included in Greek statistics.  The reasons for
 flying a foreign flag are that an owner either wants to avoid the Greek tax
 authorities or that a specific flag was prescribed to him by the bank which
 issued the loan for the purchase of the <STRONG>boat</STRONG>.  In reality, these <STRONG>boats</STRONG> fly a
 foreign flag and are usually owned by a Liberian, Panamanian, or Cypriot
 company which is ultimately controlled by the person who uses the <STRONG>boat</STRONG>.
 Another explanation for the difference in statistics is that certain Greek
 businesspersons purchase pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> from the U.S. and then sell them in
 the markets of nearby countries, such as Cyprus.  These purchases would be
 captured in U.S. statistics but would show up in Greek statistics as
 reexports.  Both of these explanations may be true to some extent.
 
 Greece has hundreds of islands and an endless coastline.  Very few of the
 lakes are navigable while there are no waterways at all.  Therefore,
 practically all pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are used in the sea, and the models purchased
 are all seagoing vessels.  Traditionally, low budget <STRONG>boat</STRONG> owners had to be
 content with small rowboats which were sometimes fitted with an inboard or
 outboard engine.  Today, they have the option to purchase an inflatable <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 which is light, fast, reliable and available in all sizes.  The light weight
 of the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> makes it ideal for being towed on a trailer or strapped to a car
 rack without requiring a powerful vehicle.  However, inflatable <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are
 not only for low budget <STRONG>boat</STRONG> enthusiasts.  Every year, larger and better
 models become available.  When fully fitted with motors and equipment, this
 can require a $30,000 - $40,000 budget.  The statistics presented in the
 statistical chart do not include inflatable <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, but their widespread use
 is directly related to the difficulties of owning a larger, better <STRONG>boat</STRONG> in
 Greece.
 
 Greece's large pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market has its foundations on the desire of
 individual Greeks to own their own <STRONG>boat</STRONG>.  The sea is accessible within a one
 or two hour drive for the majority of Greece's residents.  However, three
 negative factors make this desire difficult to fulfill.  These factors are
 cost, the lack of marinas, and government taxation.  Provided the <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 enthusiast can overcome the negative factors of cost, marinas, and taxation,
 he will often chooses to purchase a small cruiser.  Local production
 satisfies the less demanding customers, with exports made on an irregular
 basis to some E.C. and Middle Eastern countries.  The more demanding
 customers show a preference for imports.  Industry contacts described the
 purchaser of U.S.-made pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> as the successful businessperson or
 professional with two homes, two cars, and with excess money which he wants
 to spend entertaining his friends.
 
 Industry contacts say that in the area which surrounds Athens, where 80
 percent of the market for pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> is, there is a shortage of 5,000
 mooring places.  On a nationwide scale, the shortage is 10,000 places.  This
 shortage creates a black market for mooring places and the congestion in
 most marinas is unbearable.  The government has an ambitious program for
 privatizing existing marinas and allowing the private sector to build
 additional ones.  Most contacts commented that new marinas will improve the
 situation but will not be able to satisfy demand entirely.
 
 Practically all pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> sold in Greece are sold for private use.  The
 reason why they are not sold for chartering is that Greek law prescribes
 that they have a skipper.  This adds to the cost and when the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> is small
 the renter has no privacy.  There have been several requests to the
 government to remove this requirement, but, according to industry contacts,
 this will not happen for another year or two.  If and when this requirement
 is dropped, the market will acquire a new and important category of
 clientele, the motorboat rental firm.
 
 Another important factor which make prospective purchasers reluctant to
 purchase a <STRONG>boat</STRONG> is the lack of credit offered.  Although Greece's investment
 laws offer grants and subsidies to purchasers of sailing <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, such
 incentives are not available for the purchase of motorboats.  However, some
 purchasers of motorboats obtain credit directly from foreign banks, either
 directly or with the guidance of the Greek pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> representative.
 Industry contacts suggested that if U.S. <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturers become more
 involved with assisting their overseas customers to obtain credit, the terms
 of the credit could be better and therefore they could secure additional
 sales.
 
 D.  BEST SALES PROSPECTS:
 
 89.03.92.99 Motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG> of a length exceeding 7.5 meters
 
 89.03.92.99 Motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG> of a length not exceeding 7.5 meters
 
 The segment of the market where U.S. firms have best prospects is that of
 motorboats and small cruisers ranging from 6 to 8 meters in length.  These
 sizes partially fall in both of the above product categories.
 
 E.  COMPETITIVE SITUATION:
 
 The market for motorboats is broken down into two categories:  those over
 and under 7.5 meters.  U.S. <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturers are highly successful in
 selling <STRONG>boats</STRONG> ranging from 6 to 8 meters.  The U.S. import market share here
 is approximately 50 percent.  Competition comes from Taiwan, Italy, and the
 U.K.  According to industry contacts, the market segment for <STRONG>boats</STRONG> under 6
 meters is dominated by local production, while Italy and France have the
 leading shares in the limited market for larger pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> over 8 meters
 in length.
 
 Most major U.S. firms, such as Bertram, Boston Whaler, Hatteras, Bayliner,
 and Cris Craft have a presence in the Greek market.  Additionally, their
 major competitors such as Princess, Sunseeker (U.K.), Riva, Ferretti
 (Italy), and Jeanneau (France) are also present.  Most of the major agents
 represent U.S. as well as other foreign firms, in order to be able to carry
 a broad product range.  Most firms carry a limited volume of stock, with
 only one or two vessels on display.  There are, however, a few distributors
 which display 10 to 15 vessels.
 
 According to industry contacts, the advantage of U.S. firm is based on
 quality, reputation and service.  Price is also an important advantage, and
 U.S. pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> not only sell at fairly affordable prices when new, but
 they also succeed in maintaining good prices when sold secondhand.
 Promotion is also important but <STRONG>boat</STRONG> enthusiasts appear quite knowlegeable
 about the subject from reading reports and tests in local and foreign <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 magazines.
 
 F. MARKET ACCESS:
 
 Motorboats imported into Greece from non EC countries are subject to an
 import duty of 2.5 percent applicable on the CIF value.  There is also a
 Value Added Tax of 18 percent, which is applied to all motorboats (including
 locally produced) regardless of their origin.
 
 In order to enter the Greek market, U.S. firms must appoint an agent or a
 distributor.  Greek businesspersons frequent major international <STRONG>boat</STRONG> shows
 held in Europe, and U.S. firms can make good contacts at these shows.
 However, before making any commitments, U.S. firms are advised to obtain
 some information, such as a credit report, providing good information about
 the prospective agent.  One major <STRONG>boat</STRONG> importer commented that a U.S. firm
 seeking representation in Greece must be very careful when appointing an
 agent or distributor because the market is full of semi-knowlegeable <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 importers.  He added that pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are expensive items with a seasonal
 market.  To make thing more difficult, style preferences change from time to
 time.  More than once, a successful Greek businessperson, such as a car
 importer, has diversified into the pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market, and then panicked
 when the summer went by with a portion of his stock unsold.  These
 businesspersons are accustomed to the auto market which moves much faster.
 Another problem is that several people visit trade shows outside of Greece
 and pick a <STRONG>boat</STRONG> that they like.  If the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> is not represented in Greece,
 they suggest that they be appointed agents for Greece hoping to reduce the
 actual cost of their own personal acquisition.  The result is that the <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 manufacturer ends up with an agent, who may not actually be interested or
 capable of promoting the product.
 
 According to industry contacts, there are no difficulties related to meeting
 specific safety standards for pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in Greece.  In order to
 register a pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG>, the only documents required are the following:
 
 -  If the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> is under 6.5 meters in length, a certificate of suitability
    issued by the manufacturer is sufficient.
 -  If the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> is over 6.5 meters in length, the manufacturers
    specifications and a bill of safety are required.
 
 In preceding sections, we have mentioned several factors related to credit
 and financing which are important to the success of U.S. firms.  Following
 are several items related to the financing of exports to Greece in general
 which U.S. firms should be aware of.
 
 Over the past year, the government has liberalized the import payment
 process.  Banks are now virtually free to finance imports as they see fit
 and to make payments in foreign exchange without approval from the Bank of
 Greece.  As a consequence, the import payment process is similar to that
 used in the rest of Europe utilizing cash against documents, sight drafts,
 time drafts, and irrevocable letters of credit.  Greek banks have extensive
 correspondent relationships with U.S. banks, and Citicorp, Bank of America,
 Chase, and American Express all have offices in Athens.
 
 However, U.S. exporters should know that letters of credits and drafts are
 very expensive for Greek importers.  Banks require that the cash equivalent
 be on deposit before issuing any guarantees.  In a country where working
 capital loans now cost more than 34 percent in interest, this poses a heavy
 economic burden on the Greek importer.  To get around this, Greek businesses
 often seek cash against documents or extended credit terms of 30-60 days or
 longer from their suppliers.  European companies routinely deal on this
 basis making U.S. products less competitive, since U.S. suppliers unfamiliar
 with the market correctly require more stringent payment terms.
 
 An additional problem concerns the size of the Greek importer.  He is
 normally a small businessperson representing a number of different
 products/lines.  His orders are usually small, and he often cannot afford to
 keep large stocks on hand.  Therefore, he will request special consideration
 if a U.S. supplier demands large orders or asks him to carry a large
 inventory for reasons of service.  European supplies know the Greek market
 better, visit it more often, understand its peculiarities, and because of
 transportation distances are able to supply stock more quickly than their
 American counterparts.  Thus, they are often willing to provide easier
 credit terms to Greek importers than are American suppliers.
 
 U.S. banks and business should exercise caution in extending credit to Greek
 business.  It is important to obtain full credit background checks on any
 prospective recipient of liberal financing terms.  Most Greek businesses
 have an unhealthy debt/equity ratio and are highly vulnerable to changing
 interest rates.  Therefore, it is a good idea to run periodic credit checks,
 even on businesses which have good payment records.
 
 As a final caveat, we should point out that we occasionally experience
 payments disputes involving Greek banks which have inadvertently released
 documents, and therefore goods, before payment has been received from sight
 drafts and even letters of credit.  We can only conclude that in such cases
 we are dealing with an inexperienced Greek banking system and one in which
 personal relations (i.e. between bank employee and businessperson) can lead
 to actions which are detrimental to the supplier.  Therefore, we recommend
 that the U.S. exporter exercise caution at all times in selling to Greece.
 Drafts and letters of credit should clearly spell out all requirements for
 the release of goods, specify all currencies, payment terms, and details of
 quality/quantity of goods.  In short, nothing should be left to chance or
 interpretation.  Ninety-five percent of business with Greece is
 straightforward without problems.  It is the other five percent which U.S.
 bankers and businesses have to pay attention to.  In short, if you do not
 know your customer, exercise every precaution.  Above all, never/never make
 subsequent shipments to an importer who has been unable or unwilling to pay
 for earlier shipments.

 G.  TRADE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES:
 
 As stated earlier, leading international <STRONG>boat</STRONG> shows are frequented by Greek
 businesspersons and prospective buyers.  In Greece, several competing and
 conflicting <STRONG>boat</STRONG> shows have been held over the past few years.  The industry
 has finally decided to sort things out and to settle on one show which will
 be held twice a year.  The show is the International <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Exhibition, and it
 is organized by Helexpo, the official organizer of the Thessaloniki
 International Show.  The International <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Exhibition has been scheduled to
 be held in Athens from March 9 to 17, 1991, and in Thessaloniki from
 November 2 to 10, 1991.  The address of Helexpo is the following:
 
 Helexpo S.A.
 154 Egnatia Street
 GR-546 36 Thessaloniki
 Greece
 Phone: 01130/31/239221
 FAX: 01130/31/229116
 Telex: 412291
 
 There is also the possibility of participating in the Thessaloniki
 International Show, where the American-Hellenic Chamber of Commerce has its
 own pavilion.  The show is held every year, is horizontal, and attracts over
 a million visitors from all over the Greece.  The next show will be held
 from September 7 to 16, 1991.  Participating in this show could offer good
 publicity, provided the U.S. firm has already reached a working relationship
 with an agent.  However, participating in this show without an agent is not
 recommended.  The address of the American-Hellenic Chamber of Commerce is
 the following:

SUMMARY

This article titled:  "The Boating Equipment and Supplies Market in Hong
Kong", dated June 1993, was prepared by Willien Ha, American Embassy - Hong
Kong.  The article consists of 19 pages and contains the following subtopics:

    OVERVIEW
    STATISTICAL DATA
    MARKET ASSESSMENT
    BEST SALES PROSPECTS
    COMPETITIVE SITUATION
    MARKET ACCESS
    TRADE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES







A.  OVERVIEW

Sector Summary

Boating in Asia Pacific waters, or "Asia's Caribbean", remained firmly in
the world industry spotlight during 1992-1993 as increasing numbers of North
American, South American, European and Australasian builders set up sales
networks in this fast-growing sector.

Two-thirds of the world's population live in Asia's Caribbean, and
increasing wealth led by Japan and then the so-called "four tigers" of
Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore is filtering down through class
levels and rubbing off on neighboring countries which are themselves now
experiencing economic upturns.

Leisure time is a right, sporting lifestyles an achievable expectation, and
watersports are suddenly in vogue.

In 1992, Hong Kong had a total import market of US$ 31.2 million worth of
boating equipment and supplies.  The USA had a big share, holding up 47.6
percent (US$ 14.85 million) of the import market.  Ninety-one percent of
this US$ 14.85 was for the import of outboard motors.  As compared to the
1991 figure, there was a drop of 36 percent in the import of outboard
motors, mainly as a result of new legislation aimed at restricting large
engines.  Please refer to section (E) below for detailed explanations.

Subsector Summary

Hong Kong is an island and is surrounded with pleasure boating harbors.
While most of the pleasure <B>boats</B> are locally constructed "junks", these
<B>boats</B> are generally equipped with a wide variety of modern accessories,
where American manufacturers excel.  American made motors are also in heavy
demand.  Up-scale pleasure <B>boats</B> also constitute a small, but highly
lucrative market.

Hong Kong itself has experienced mixed fortunes since Tiananmen Square,
which sparked a massive middle-class exodus to Canada and Australia and
depressed the <B>boat</B> market.  Large infrastructure projects, such as the new
airport, mean an influx of multi-national engineers and construction
executives who are historically inclined to buy <B>boats</B> during their stay.
Many emigres are returning with their "safety valve" passports, and massive
industrial investment in Southern China, particularly by Hong Kong and
Taiwanese businessmen, seems likely to make the China Coast the world's
economic dynamo this decade.  Demand to support this development is already
strong, spearheaded by sales of modern commercial ferries and inter-island
craft that now ply between Hong Kong, Macau and various Pearl River ports in
the hinterland.  Heavy car and truck traffic gets clogged at the Hong
Kong-China border, and ferry timetables are not always convenient, so
new-breed businessmen have begun turning to private motor yachts, nicely
tax-deductible, to fulfil their needs.

For the purpose of this Industry Subsector Analysis report, a number of
subsector products were selected for the study.  The selected products are
outboard motors, radar apparatus and navigational aid apparatus, and other
navigational instruments and apparatus such as sonar, echo sounder, fish
finder, aquameter, speedometer, fuel gauge sensor, direction finder, GPS
receiver, radar, VHF transmitter, etc.  Please note that every effort has
been made to identify statistical data related to marine (specifically
pleasure craft related) use only, but census figures available are gathered
in accordance to the "make" of the product, rather than to their use.
Besides that when the boating equipment and supplies are imported into Hong
Kong, the importers did not specify in great detail the goods imported.
Sometimes the items are merely grouped into categories as "other
navigational instruments" without identifying statistics for each item.
Therefore, statistics indicated below are estimates for reference only.

Receptivity Score (1-5):  3

The receptivity score (5 means extremely receptive) reflects the degree of
satisfactory performance of the U.S. manufacturers.  The reason for the
rating mainly lies in the competitive price of the boating supplies and
equipment.

C.  MARKET ASSESSMENT

Market Demand.  In 1992, a total of 5,461 pleasure <B>boats</B> were registered
with the Marine Department.  A detailed breakdown of the number of vessels
by type and length are indicated below.  The purpose of this chart is to
give the readers an idea of the number of pleasure vessels registered in
Hong Kong.  Through the figures, U.S. manufacturers will have a better
picture of the size of the Hong Kong market, in terms of the number of
vessels and need for boating equipment and supplies.

In 1990, Hong Kong imported a total of 118 motorized pleasure <B>boats</B> with 22
vessels from the U.S.  The U.S. took up 14 percent (US$ 3.64 million) of the
total import market (US$ 26 million).  The following year, U.S.'s share was
18 percent (US$ 5 million) of the total import market of US$ 27.5 million.
In 1992, the Hong Kong Government modified the "Imports and Exports
Classification List" from the previous edition (1988) upon full adoption of
the harmonized system.  The statistics showed that a total of 648 sailboats
(non inflatable), non-inflatable rowing <B>boats</B>, and canoes, and vessels for
pleasure or sports were imported into the colony.  These imports accounted
for US$ 36.7 million with U.S. taking up 19 percent (US$ 6.9 million) of the
total import market.  The overall statistics show that Italy is U.S.'s main
competitor in terms of high end pleasure crafts while Taiwan dominates the
low end market.  It is important to note that most Taiwan manufactured
vessels use American engines and accessories.

End-User Profiles.  As mentioned above, large infrastructure projects, such
as the new airport at Chek Lap Kok, mean an influx of multi-national
engineers and construction executives who are historically inclined to buy
<B>boats</B> during their stay.

Hong Kong has long been an important regional center in the Asia-Pacific
region.  Its central location and excellent external communication links
have made Hong Kong attractive to overseas companies not only for business,
but also as a convenient base from which to supervise other offices in
neighboring countries.  With the significant economic development in the
Asia-Pacific region in recent years, Hong Kong's regional role has become
increasingly important.  A recent survey conducted by the Hong Kong
Government Industry Department identified 1,345 regional representatives by
overseas companies in Hong Kong.  They include 588 regional headquarters and
757 regional offices.  The U.S. has the largest number of regional
headquarters in Hong Kong, with 206 companies, followed by Japan (74
companies) and the UK (73 companies).  The major lines of business of the
regional headquarters included wholesale, retail, import and export
activities, followed by real estate and business services, manufacturing and
finance and banking.

The multi-national companies, large trading companies, banks and financial
companies are end-users of medium-priced and up-scale pleasure <B>boats</B>.
Pleasure <B>boats</B> are bought as symbols of wealth and fortune, as entertainment
tool for business contacts, and as recreational benefits for staff.  These
end-users also tend to have large offices and budgets.  They are image
conscious and have a comparatively high portion of Western employees, with a
preference of high quality pleasure <B>boats</B> and boating equipment.

The political uncertainty of Hong Kong after 1997 caused an exodus of
wealthy, learned upper and middle class Hong Kong citizens to flee to
advanced countries such as USA, Canada, Australia.  Many emigres are
returning with their "safety valve" passports.  These are also another group
of end-users of the boating industry.

E.  COMPETITIVE SITUATION

Domestic Production.  According to statistics available from the Hong Kong
Trade Development Council, 1991 recorded 429 establishments in the local
ship building industry, with 7,184 employed in this industry.
Pleasure/sport yachts and cabin cruisers are major export items of Hong
Kong's ship building industry.  In 1991, Hong Kong exported 42 motorized
pleasure crafts valued at US$ 11.2 million and 103 non-motorized pleasure
crafts worth US$ 593,000.  Hong Kong also manufactures workboats for local
users, including trawlers for fishing; dredgers, barges and landing crafts
for cargo-handling; fire-fighters, police/customs' patrol <B>boats</B>.

Ships produced include passenger coasters such as ferries and catamarans.
Hong Kong companies have also set up manufacturing bases in China to produce
ocean-going liners and container ships.

Local <B>boat</B> builders fall into two categories.  One, the traditionalists who
use wood hull construction methods and build junks.  Two, yards which use
modern hull construction techniques using fiberglass and steel for the
production of high unit value motor cruisers.  The traditional Chinese junk,
the backbone of the local <B>boat</B> building industry, only recorded sales of US$
2.37 million in 1990.  Hong Kong <B>boat</B> builders have seen the bottom knocked
off their business by inexpensive imports from Taiwan, Thailand and the
Philippines and quality yachts from Europe.

About 80 percent of the <B>boat</B>/shipyards are small establishments having 10 or
fewer employees, majority of which are repairers servicing local fishing
<B>boats</B> and pleasure crafts.  There are only 10 shipyards employing more than
100 workers.  They are mostly <B>boat</B>/ship builders as ship building is a very
labor intensive industry requiring highly specialized technicians.  Hong
Kong mainly manufacturers <B>boats</B> of 10 to 20 meters of length.  Though it is
technically feasible to custom-build <B>boats</B> of up to 70 meters, space of most
shipyards is not sufficient for large ship fabrication.  Most <B>boats</B> are made
of glass reinforced plastic (GRP), a lighter and more durable material.
Large <B>boats</B>, however, must have steel bodies of sufficient strength.

Pleasure crafts are mainly exported to the U.S. and EC, where Taiwan is the
major competitor.  Hong Kong's cruisers are superior in design and quality.
<B>Boats</B> are usually custom-built to end-user' specifications.

Hong Kong also produces parts and accessories for pleasure crafts.  Windsurf
sails, outboard engines and stern drives are produced for local, Asia and
the U.S. markets.

Imports.  As noted above, Hong Kong's main source of pleasure <B>boats</B> are
imported from Italy (high-end), Taiwan (low-end) while the U.S. takes the
lead in the middle range.

U.S. dominated Hong Kong's import market of outboard motors.  This is
interesting to note that in 1990, 1991 and 1992, some 19 percent, 26 percent
and 25 percent respectively of these outboard motors were re-exported to
China.  Incidentally, in the past few years, there were reports on the
successful and unsuccessful capture of U.S.'s version of "rum runners",
caught smuggling stolen vehicles and others consumer goods, such as audio
visual equipment, cigarettes, small home appliances from Hong Kong into the
China.  These rum runners (or nicknamed "Dai Fai" in Chinese) were equipped
with powerful outboard motors that often beat the speed of the local coastal
guards.  As a result, the Marine Department issued notice (dated June 1990)
announcing that the horse power rating of all pleasure <B>boats</B> fitted with
more than one outboard engine cannot exceed 448 kilowatts (600 horse
power).  Exemptions for licenses issuance will only be granted in certain
circumstances.  Similar rules apply for fuel tanks:  the fuel tanks of such
pleasure vessels cannot exceed 817 liters (180 gallons) without the prior
approval of the Director of Marine.

Japan took the lead (90 percent) in exporting direction finders (DF) into
Hong Kong while USA's Loran sea system dominated the market of radio
navigational aid apparatus (80 percent).  As for radar, Japan dominated the
market by supplying 90 percent of the radar equipment for Hong Kong's market
while the USA took up 5-8 percent of the pie.

In areas of other marine electronics, the USA held 70 percent of the GPS
receiver market while Japan took the remaining 30 percent.  In the area of
"other navigational instruments" such as sonar, fish finders, depth
sounders, countries like Japan (40 percent), Taiwan (25 percent) and USA (25
percent) dominated Hong Kong's import market.  As for VHF transmitters,
Japan imported 50 percent of Hong Kong's needs while the rest of the market
was shared by the USA (20 percent), the U.K. (15 percent) and Taiwan (5
percent).

U.S. Market Position & Share.

In terms of shipping of pleasure crafts into Hong Kong, interviews with
leading importers of pleasure crafts indicated that as a result of the
worldwide recession, U.S. manufacturers have cut their production.  For
example, the USA used to offer 10 production lines with pleasure crafts of
different sizes.  Now they only keep 2-3 product lines to hang on.
Therefore, to the consumers, there are not many choices to choose from.

As mentioned above, the USA took the lead in the export of outboard motors
to Hong Kong.  The USA took up 64 percent of Hong Kong's import market.
Japan followed closely by taking up 33 percent of the import market.

As for radar and navigational aid apparatus, major boating equipment and
accessories importers indicate that it was a tug of war between the U.S. and
Japan, each holding about half of Hong Kong's import market.  But as for
"other navigational apparatus", Japanese manufactured products are more
popular.

Competitive Factors.

The most important competitive factors for the industry are price, quality
and service.  Interviews with local companies indicate that U.S. suppliers
are generally ignoring their export market.  A consensus opinion is that
U.S. manufacturers are not responding "quickly" enough for their
agent/distributors and/or customers.  A possible answer to this phenomenon
is that when compared to the U.S. domestic market, Hong Kong's market is
viewed as being relatively small.  Therefore, if U.S. suppliers want a
greater share in this market, they should be more responsive and competitive
with their counterparts, such as Japan, U.K., Italy, etc.

Japan is the major competitor for the U.S. because it serves the mid market
which is dominated by U.S. firms.  Besides that, the proximity of Japan to
Hong Kong enhances Hong Kong companies to find Japanese companies to fulfil
their rush orders.

The success of the industry also rests largely on the collective ability to
anticipate and respond to the changes presented in an increasingly demanding
and competitive marketplace.  A substantial commitment to provide more
timely assistance to consumer questions and concerns will be helpful.


F.  MARKET ACCESS

Import and Export Regime

Hong Kong is a free port and one of the world's best examples of an "open
market economy".

Hong Kong is a member of GATT in good standing.  There is no legislation or
practice which restricts access to the Hong Kong markets by foreign
exporters or which mandates preference for locally manufactured products.
Hong Kong companies (and the Hong Kong Government itself) do not have any
predisposition to any one supplier--and are far more inclined to purchase
based on the terms of price, delivery, quality and service.

Import duties are levied only on tobacco, alcoholic liquors, methyl alcohol,
some hydrocarbons, and nonalcoholic beverages.  A modest declaration charge
and an assessment of 0.05 percent is made on imports and exports to fund the
Hong Kong Trade Development Council.  Technical and safety standards are not
used as a political or trade control mechanism, and they are normally
accommodated with little difficulty.

The Hong Kong Government imposes restrictions on the export of
high-technology products to COCOM-proscribed countries, such as the People's
Republic of China.  Restrictions on trade with China were relaxed
significantly by the United States in 1991.  Textiles are subject to import
and export licensing because of the territory's obligations under agreements
with the USA and other countries.  The import of munitions, firearms and
fireworks is strictly forbidden.

Guidelines for Selecting an Agent or Distributor in Hong Kong

One of the best ways to sell products in the Hong Kong market is through the
use of agents or distributors.

An agent takes orders in your name.  Distributors act in their own name, and
may stock products purchased from you for resale.  The choice of whether to
use an agent or a distributor depends on your business, and the type of
relationship with which you are the most comfortable.  You may also find
that your local distributor has good contacts in China, which can be used to
expand your sales to this enormous market.

Working with agents and distributors in Hong Kong is very much like working
with an agent in the United States.  Hong Kong uses British common law as
the basis of its legal system, and unlike many other countries, has no
special legislation regarding agents or distributors.  Any contract which
does not contain illegal or unconscionable provisions is allowed.  In other
words, virtually anything you can agree to with your agent, and put into a
written contract, is acceptable and enforceable.  There are no restrictions
on territory, nor any requirements for a notification grace period upon
termination of the agency agreement.

Because of the similarities of Hong Kong law to US practices, FCS Hong Kong
does not recommend any text for an agency agreement.  You may use an
American text, or simply draw up your own agreement.  As with any
understanding, the more complex the contract, the more likely it will be
that you will need legal counsel in drafting the text.  This has nothing to
do with any special complexities of Hong Kong law, however, but simply the
necessity of clarity in legal documents when large sums of money are
involved.

The types of agents and distributors you will find in Hong Kong are very
similar to those found in the United States.  You will find "rack jobbers,"
who simply stock retail stores with standard items.  There are also stocking
distributors, who generally require higher commissions than other agents,
but since they buy for their own account your risks in international sales
are lower when dealing with them.  You will also find agents who provide
sales, engineering and technical support for complex systems.  Regardless of
the type of agent you are seeking, Hong Kong has a plethora of qualified
individuals and companies.

Americans are often surprised by the diversity of the business sectors seen
on the business cards of Hong Kong agents.  It is not uncommon for a company
to deal in a wide variety of products--everything from chicken parts to
airplane parts.  This is often quite distressing to Americans, who expect
their distributor to "stick to the knitting."  Although it is a good idea to
make certain that a potential distributor has experience in the specific
sector of interest to your company, you should not be overly concerned when
local distributors are widely diversified in the sectors in which they
sell.  This is completely in line with Hong Kong custom and practice.

Often the managing director of a company will want to list all businesses
with which he or she is directly affiliated.  Each of these businesses will
be discrete units, with specialized management and salespeople.  In some
cases, each division will be led by a family member, who will have
specialized schooling or skills.  Where a member of the younger generation
would form an independent company in the United States, it is common
practice in Hong Kong for a child to retain an affiliation with the parent.
Because of this practice, the companies may appear to be more widely
diversified than their US counterparts, although this difference is more
form than substance.

One area in which Americans may have trouble with distributors in Hong Kong
is with their perception of the loyalty of their local agent.  Americans
have complained that as soon as they get an agent trained, he or she either
drops them, or leaves them for a competitor's product, taking the client
list with them.  This is a problem which should not be underestimated, and
one where American exporters must take preventative action prior to signing
a contract.

FCS Hong Kong offers the following advice:

1.  Be careful about granting an exclusive agency too soon.  Before you
agree to exclusivity, have either very good references on your partner, or
some experience.  Some Americans have found that the local agent wants an
exclusive agreement to BLOCK the sale of the American's product in the
market.  This occurs when the agent already represents a competitor, and
wants to keep competition to a minimum.

2.  Be cautious about how much technical information you give potential
agents before you have had sufficient experience with them.  Intellectual
property is often difficult to protect, and the copying of products is
endemic in Asia.  Be very careful of any potential agent who requests too
much technical information, drawings, or specifications before an agreement
is signed.  Supply technical data in increments, as your negotiations on the
agency agreement progress; not giving too much, but sufficient to determine
the capability and sincerity of your potential partner.  Theft of
intellectual property is prohibited by local law, but prevention of piracy
is less expensive and more effective than retrospective legal action.

3.  Pay close attention to your agent in the first few months of the
agreement.  Make certain that there is an appropriate level of sales
activity after an agreement is signed.  Although individual markets develop
at differing rates, monitor the progress toward sales of your product to
assure it is progressing at the appropriate rate.  If you do not see
sufficient progress, take immediate action.  Warn your agent that you want
more activity, and terminate the agreement if nothing happens.  Make sure
your agreement specifies how much activity should occur, and include
remedies, such as a probation period, in which you can terminate the
agreement for cause.

4.  Make certain that your agreement contains provisions restricting the
agents' activities in your industry sector after termination of the
contract.  This is to prevent the agent from simply using the time with you
to become trained in the technology, and to acquire a client list.
Covenants can be included in an agency agreement which prohibit the agent
working in the same industry for specific periods of time after the contract
is terminated.

By following these steps you can find, as have hundreds of other American
companies, that working with an agent or distributor in Hong Kong can be an
effective way of doing business.

Getting paid

The preferred method of quoting is "cif" or "c and f" in HK$.  U.S. and
other freely convertible currencies may be accepted for bids and pro forma
invoicing.

Terms of payment depend on the relative negotiating strength of the buyers
and sellers.  US suppliers should seek to obtain letters of credit or sight
draft terms when dealing with buyers who are not well known to them.  Asking
for a letter of credit is a standard business practice, and your potential
customer will not interpret this as a sign of mistrust.

The Consulate General does not enter directly into trade disputes between
American and Hong Kong commercial parties.  The Hong Kong Foreign Commercial
Office can furnish the names of Hong Kong law firms if the need arises.

Hong Kong is the region's leading finance center with 163 fully licensed
banks (20 with American ownership).  Letters of credit, document collection
and international remittance are widely available.  All licensed banks are
authorized to provide loans to residents and nonresidents.  Risk of
financing receivables can be readily evaluated via locally available credit
information.  Prospective exporters should make use of banking relationships
to determine credit risk.

The importance of trade finance to the territory has resulted in a high
level of bank efficiency in providing import payment services.  The local
currency, the Hong Kong dollar (HK$), is freely convertible and there are no
regulations that hamper inward or outward remittance of capital or profits.
Currently the HK$ is pegged at 7.78 to the US$ and has fluctuated little
since the inception of the linked rate policy in 1983.

Selling to the Hong Kong Government

The Hong Kong Government Supplies Department (GSD) is responsible for the
procurement of goods and services required by the government.  The GSD will
usually purchase by open tender, with decisions based on price, quality and
delivery.  "Selective tender" and "single tender" are rare.  The GSD gives
no preference to any particular source of supply from any country or
organization.  American companies now enjoy a 33 per cent market share of
GSD purchases, which approached US$ 1 billion in 1992.

Tenderers have six weeks to prepare their offers.  Tenderers are urged to
submit offers with at least a 30-day validity period.  Payment is usually
effective by check within 30 days of delivery.  All tenderers can receive an
assessment of their bids, successful or not.  Total bid prices and names of
the successful tenderers are published weekly in the Government Gazette.

Potential suppliers must first be prequalified with the GSD.  To become a
"Registered Supplier" and regularly receive the GSD's tender notices,
companies must provide background information about the goods that they
offer.  The GSD evaluates this information and selects qualified suppliers
for inclusion on its register.

Trademarks

Trademarks are registered in Hong Kong under the Trade Marks Ordinance,
which is based on Britain's Trade Mark Act of 1983.  Every trademark, even
if already registered in the USA, UK or elsewhere, must satisfy all the
requirements of the Hong Kong Ordinance before it may be accepted for
registration in the territory.  Only owners of registered trademarks may sue
for infringement.

Trademarks for Services

The Intellectual Property Department of Hong Kong allows registration of
trademarks for services (also known as "service marks").  Trademarks used to
identify services such as banking, advertising, insurance, construction,
transportation and retail sales services (such as retail trade names) can be
registered on the Trade Marks Register and enjoy the near monopoly
protection accorded registered trademarks.

In the case of a conflict between two applications for an identical or
similar mark for similar services, the registrar will give priority to the
application filed earlier.  Consequently, companies, partnerships and
individuals in service industries are advised to apply to register their
valuable trademarks immediately.  The registration process will probably
take from one to three years.

Patents

Hong Kong does not provide for the original grant of patents.  A grantee of
a British patent or a European patent with a British designation may apply
within five years of its date of issue for re-registration in Hong Kong.

Copyright

The Copyright Ordinance protects every original literary, dramatic, musical
or artistic work with an author who was domiciled or resident in Hong Kong
or in a Berne Convention country when the work was made or first published.
The law covers software as a literary work.  Enforcement of the ordinance is
vested in the Customs and Excise Department and has been historically
vigorous.

Designs

Any person who has registered a design in Britain enjoys the same rights as
if the certificate was issued in the UK with an extension to Hong Kong.
Automatic protection for original designs without registration is also
conferred by the Copyright Ordinance (1973).

Passing Off

Owners of unregistered trademarks may not sue for infringement of those
marks.  They may sue in "Passing Off", a common law tort, unique to British
law, which requires the trademark owner to prove acquired reputation in the
mark and actual damage caused by se of the mark by the other party.

1997 and the Future of Hong Kong

At midnight, on June 30, 1997 Hong Kong will become a "Special
Administrative Region" (SAR) of the People's Republic of China.  The treaty
between Great Britain and the PRC which created the SAR of Hong Kong
guarantees the future existence of the current territory as a capitalist
enclave until at least the year 2047.  The Chinese speak of "one country,
two systems," which has become the standard way of describing what is
anticipated in Hong Kong after 1997.  A similar system has been negotiated
for the Portuguese colony of Macau, with the transition taking place in 1999.

While it is impossible for anyone to predict the future of Hong Kong with
certainty, current indicators suggest that the People's Republic of China
will abide by the Hong Kong Accords.  The reasons for this optimism are as
follows:

1.  The PRC has invested heavily in Hong Kong.  In fact, the PRC is the
largest investor in the territory (estimated US$ 15 billion).  This
investment is predicated on the assumption by the PRC Government that their
capital will continue to generate income well beyond 1997.  The PRC has been
profiting from its Hong Kong investment for years, and there is no logical
reason to assume that they would now want to destroy this source of
income--especially at a time when Hong Kong "belongs to them."

2.  China needs Hong Kong's infrastructure to sustain its current policy of
fostering economic growth.  Indeed, the growth targets set by the PRC
Government would be utterly impossible without the use of Hong Kong's banks,
trading companies, and the container port facilities.  Over 60 percent of
all Chinese exports flow through the port of Hong Kong.

3.  The current PRC leadership has pointed with pride to the economic growth
of the southern regions of China, indicating that this is a model for the
rest of China.  This growth is a direct result of Hong Kong investment and
management.  Hong Kong has created over 3,000,000 jobs in southern China
through its investment over the last few years.  To explain this, a Chinese
Communist leader was quoted as saying, "Just because capitalists use a
certain method to run their economy, doesn't make it a capitalist method."
The liberalization of China has been based on Hong Kong models, with this
likely to continue.

4.  Historically, the PRC has never taken actions which were specifically
designed to damage Hong Kong business interests.  Even during the depths of
the cultural revolution in China, Hong Kong was considered "off limits."
There is no indication that this is going to change.

If one were to paint the most likely post-1997 scenario, given current
economic and political indicators, it would be of Hong Kong continuing as it
is today.  Most observers agree that there may be certain areas where the
inexperience of Chinese administrators may cause a deterioration of some
services, although this will be gradual, and without a substantive effect on
the overall functioning of business.

A second scenario, which is not considered the most likely, must be
contemplated:  A political and economic status quo in Beijing underlies most
predictions about the future of Hong Kong.  While it is conceivable that
this could occur over the next few years, forces for reform in China are
gathering strength.  The situation remains very volatile, but if economic
reformers achieve a dominant position in PRC politics, the cloud hanging
over Hong Kong's future could dissipate very rapidly.  With Chinese society
achieving political openness, an improvement of human rights, and adherence
of the PRC government to conventions regarding the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction, the entire picture for Hong Kong could radically change
for the positive.  A drastic reform in China, coupled by acceptance of these
reforms by the United States and Europe, could leave Hong Kong as the model
for the entire Chinese society.  The current boom in Hong Kong would be
expanded exponentially to meet this challenge.  Although few observers see
this as the most likely scenario, the possibility of reform in the PRC
positively affect Hong Kong should not be dismissed.  If recent signs from
the 14th Party Congress are any indication, a strong reform movement in
China appears to be gathering strength.

Companies interested in the Hong Kong market should watch the political and
economic changes in China very carefully, since the vitality of Hong Kong is
directly tied to China's future.  Reliance on newspaper accounts, which
often prefer reporting on negative or sensational developments, should be
counterbalanced with other sources of information.  Far too many American
companies are currently avoiding Hong Kong out of a misguided fear of the
developments slated for 1997.  This risk of missing a profitable opportunity
must be counterbalanced against the political risk presumed for 1997.  Since
selling in Hong Kong generally does not require a huge commitment of funds,
because of the possibility of using agents and distributors, few companies
should avoid Hong Kong out of fear of losing assets through the changes due
in 1997.  We urge potential exporters to give Hong Kong more than a cursory
evaluation when assessing the market potential of various Asian countries.


G.  TRADE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES

Many promotional vehicles are open to suppliers to introduce and develop
their services in the Hong Kong market.  These include:

-   special trade fairs and exhibitions
-   advertising in the media and other public relations activities
-   holding seminars
-   in-store promotions
-   joint promotions with wholesale and retail outlets

Hong Kong is a major conference and exhibition center.  Hundreds of
international exhibitions are held annually.  The Hong Kong Conference and
Exhibition Center has 180,000 square feet of exhibition space and will soon
be expanding.  Television is a widely used medium with an estimated daily
audience of 5.27 million out of a population of 5.8 million.

As one of the largest centers in the world for Chinese language
publications, the territory produces 600 publications, including 51 Chinese
newspapers and 2 English daily newspapers.  Advertising agencies, including
many of international standing, offer a full range of services.

Suppliers should provide technical catalogs in English, and desirably in
Chinese, for distribution to agents and firms.  Company brochures are
particularly useful when visiting Hong Kong for the first time.
English-Chinese business cards are a must.

    Conferences and exhibitions scheduled within the next 24 months include:

 A. OVERVIEW
 
 The Italian market for pleasure motorboats (including inboard, in-outboard,
 and pneumatic <STRONG>boats</STRONG>) has experienced an exceptional growth during the
 quinquennium 1985 - 1990, surging two and a half times its sales volume.  In
 1990, Italian demand for pleasure motorboats reached the peak of its high
 development phase.  This trend was even more accentuated by important laws
 issued by the Italian Parliament which somewhat alleviated tax burdens for
 pleasure motorboat owners.  After this period of astonishing expansion, the
 market has entered a new cycle, characterized by stability and even an
 inflection in its growth rate.  Nonetheless, this has not affected sector
 imports, which in 1991 experienced a 37% increase in sales volume (current
 terms) and covered approximately 50% of the market demand.  In particular,
 U.S. exports to Italy continue to play a preponderant role maintaining an
 import market share of 38.0%, and actually covering 19% of Italian sector
 market.  Notwithstanding "the party's over" atmosphere prevailing among U.S.
 domestic powerboat suppliers and a general slow-down currently affecting the
 European market, the "stars and stripes" production costs about 20% less
 than the Italian one and thus what is generally viewed as the "U.S.
 invasion" is expected to continue, with good sales for small and medium-size
 inboard/in-outboard and outboard motorboats and especially cabin cruisers
 and day cruisers.

 C.  MARKET ASSESSMENT
 
 1.  Market Demand
 
 In Europe the pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market has experienced a cyclic growth which
 reached in 1990 the peak of its high development phase.  This trend was even
 more accentuated on the Italian market after important laws issued by the
 Italian Parliament in 1989 which contributed to further boost its momentum.
 In brief, the inductive type of personal income assessment for Italian
 resident <STRONG>boat</STRONG> owners became less substantial.  In addition, the value added
 tax, one time doubled for <STRONG>boats</STRONG> over 18 tons was limited to <STRONG>boats</STRONG> over 50
 tons (approximately 20 meters in length) and a new category was created for
 small <STRONG>boat</STRONG> owners which pay a reduced VAT, more consistent with European
 levels.  Thus a 9% VAT was applied to small <STRONG>boats</STRONG> under 3 ton and 6 meters
 and 18.5 kW, a 19% VAT applied to hulls up to 50 tons, and a 38% VAT to
 hulls over 50 tons.  It is understandable how these laws have positively
 influenced the growth of the Italian domestic pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market which
 chalked up an amazing increase of 150% from 1985 to 1990.
 
 Since 1990 year-end, however, the industry has been experiencing a slightly
 weaker demand for pleasure motorboats.  Several factors have contributed to
 this end, including the decline in the overall economy with slower growth of
 personal income and the reluctance of pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> consumers to take on
 additional debt, skyrocketing mooring taxes, and lack of an adequate
 infrastructure to support pleasure boating.  A pleasure motorboat is by far
 a discretionary purchase that can be postponed or canceled.  Thus, when the
 overall economy weakens, the demand for pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> also declines.  The
 1991 introduction of outrageously expensive and differentiated annual
 mooring tax rates (e.g. an eight-meter motorboat currently costs
 approximately $1,000 instead of the previous $160) heavily contributed to
 dampen consumer purchases.  Many observers indicate that more affordable
 marinas and other infrastructures are also badly needed to boost medium-term
 demand.  Nonetheless, U.S. products, strongly desired by Italian dealers and
 distributors because of their innovations, special features, and very
 competitive prices, registered a further increase of 26% in 1991 sales to
 Italy.  Italian demand for U.S. pleasure motorboats is expected to fare well
 in the near future, although it is not likely to reach the astonishing
 increases of the recent past.
 
 2.  End User Profile
 
 Thirty years ago, there was one <STRONG>boat</STRONG> owner in Italy every five thousand
 inhabitants,  currently, there is one <STRONG>boat</STRONG> owner every hundred;  the future
 could perhaps envision one <STRONG>boat</STRONG> owner every 20.  Italy has after all a
 sea-faring tradition coupled with acceptable weather all year round.  In
 addition, the market should benefit from the fastest growing 35-to-44 and
 45-to-54 age groups.  The latter, especially, are reaching the maximum
 wage-earning period allowing them to consider such large purchases as a
 pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG>.
 
 Pleasure motorboats sold in Italy during 1990 (last official figure
 available) amounted to 4,915 units for inboard/in-outboard pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG>,
 7,459 units for outboard pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, and 13,267 for pneumatic <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 totaling sales for $ 327 million.  Close to the same amount is estimated to
 have been sold in 1991, with a 50% increase in the import of the more
 comfortable medium-size inboard/in-outboard pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  In 1991,
 Italian demand for smaller units slightly decreased, with 10% less imports
 of pneumatic <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, and 5% less imports of outboard models, notwithstanding
 the fact that the small motorboat segment is still by far the most popular,
 or rather the more affordable.
 Diesel engines are predominant in the inboard and in-outboard
 configurations.  This trend, generalized all over Europe, is even more
 accentuated in Italy.  Fuel economy cannot be considered an influencing
 factor due to low amount of hours per year of navigation for a pleasure
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG>.  The dominant criterior is the safety factor, for the same reason that
 the installation of two independent engines has become a standard at sea.
 Gasoline engine powered <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, thanks to the increased safety factor of
 modern designed engines, are also increasing their small market share and
 find favorable application in prestige, high performance <STRONG>boats</STRONG> where high
 speed, high power concentration and reduced bulk are taken as major design
 criteria.  Outboard engines are of course practically all gasoline fueled.
 
 
 D.  BEST SALES PROSPECTS
 
 Since a pleasure motorboat is considered a luxury item anyway, it appears
 that the sale of commodious <STRONG>boats</STRONG> such as medium-size cabin cruisers, and
 the more popular small-size day cruisers (7 to 8 meters long
 inboard/in-outboards) is expected to keep up.  At the same time,
 manufacturers are expected to continue offering smaller units, both for
 logistical and economical factors, to appeal to new boating enthusiasts
 entering the market.  However, there is a weak request at the moment for
 runabouts.
 
 Regarding the engines, the propeller system seems to be still the most
 popular and efficient system as long as the propeller is properly designed
 for the hull and engine characteristics.  Waterjets are somewhat increasing
 their penetration both in the small and high power segments.  While more
 appropriate for larger and faster <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, jet propulsion is well suited to
 small <STRONG>boats</STRONG> for special applications such as coast guard, fire brigades, and
 safe approach of populated beaches where efficiency of the propulsion system
 is of secondary importance in respect to safety and practical factors.
 
 
 E.  COMPETITIVE SITUATION
 
 1.  Domestic Production
 
 The Italian market for pleasure motorboats is split almost fifty-fifty among
 foreign and domestic suppliers.  There are approximately 600 shipyards in
 Italy, all Italian, of which about 200 cover 70% of total Italian sales.
 Among these are renowned names such as ABBATE, AZIMUT, BAGLIETTO, RIO, and
 RIVA.  The remaining 400 are small artisan-type enterprises.  Italian
 shipyards have an average export share of over 65% of their total billing,
 but in the high prestige segment, this share exceeds 90-95% with some
 shipyards working exclusively for the export market.  High technology, style
 according to the world-famous "Italian design" of the hull line and vessel
 interiors are the main reasons for achieving a high share of this market
 where price competition becomes a factor of secondary importance.
 
 The propulsion systems selected by Italian shipyards for powering their
 pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> appear very international.  Italian engine manufacturers are
 present all along the line with diesel and gasoline fueled engines
 successfully exported all over the world.  On the other hand, Italian
 shipyards select the engine according to customer and boatbuilder
 requirements often selecting engines imported from the United States,
 Germany, Sweden, etc.  This makes import-export figures very high on both
 sides.  Italian engines used by Italian shipyards are mainly inboard engines
 in the lower power bracket (both diesel and gasoline) to mention just a few
 IVECO-AIFO, BPM, while in the medium-high power bracket the Swedish VOLVO
 PENTA and the American DETROIT DIESEL and CATERPILLAR have the highest
 market share.  The German MAN and MTU are the most popular for engines up to
 1000 kW (and above) used on luxury yachts.
 
 In 1990 the Italian market demand increased approximately 45% with domestic
 production rising 31% from previous year.  Domestic sales surged 39%
 chalking up approximately $210 million, while exports rose 27% totaling $367
 million.  The slight inflection in the 1991 market demand was strongly
 covered by foreign producers, to the detriment of domestic ones whose
 production dropped an estimated 16%, with consequent sales falling both
 domestically (an estimated 23%) and abroad (12%).
 
 2.  Imports
 
 In 1990, imports of pleasure motorboats totaled $117 million and accounted
 for 36% of the total market.  In 1991, they reached $153 million, covering
 half of the Italian market.  While 1990 imports rose 57% compared to
 previous year, in 1991, they increased 37%, which is still obviously
 remarkable but less than previous year due to the slight inflection in
 market demand, and to the fact that there was perhaps a readjustment by
 Italian <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealers, who had an excess supply after the large increases of
 the past.  In addition to U.S. suppliers which take the lion's share for
 imported craft, countries which have the strongest presence are U.K.
 (representing 16.6% of total imports), France (with 12.6%, especially strong
 in the sale of pneumatic <STRONG>boats</STRONG>), and Germany (6.5%).  Imports are expected
 to continue to play a key role in the next few years.
 
 3.  U.S. Market Position and Share
 
 Not only is the U.S. Italy's principal supplier but Italy is the fourth
 largest customer in size of destination countries, after Canada, Japan, and
 Germany.  In 1990, U.S. imports amounted to approximately $48 million (plus
 54% compared to previous year), representing 41% of total imports, and 15%
 of total market.  In 1991, U.S. sales in Italy chalked up $58 million (plus
 26%), representing 38.0% of total imports, and accounting for 19% of the
 Italian market.  In particular, the U.S. respectively supplied 37% and 51%
 of imported inboard/in-outboard pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, and outboard motorboats.
 Well over one hundred U.S. motorboat manufacturers are present on the
 Italian market through local importers/distributors.  The latter include
 CHAMPION RECORD, INTERNATIONAL YACHTS, MARINA DI VERBELLA, MARINE UNION,
 MOTOMAR YACHTING, VITALCO, and many others.
 
 Many consider the U.S. as the leader in the pleasure boating industry.
 Reflecting this trend, U.S. firms are traditionally the most numerous among
 foreign exhibitors at the renowned annual Genoa International <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Show.
 Many observers at the show have commented that the "stars and stripes"
 production costs about 20% less than the Italian one and some members of
 UCINA (Italian Boating Manufacturers Association) are really beginning to
 fear what is generally looked at as the "U.S. invasion" of the market.
 
 Because U.S. pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> production enjoys such an excellent receptivity,
 the U.S. import market share for the next three years is expected to keep up
 with an estimated annual real growth of about 5%.  It is unlikely however
 that it will be able to repeat the amazing performances of the recent past
 in the short term in view of the general recession currently affecting
 Italian economy with the consequent drop of consumer expenditures in the
 more "trivial" sectors.
 
 4.  Competitive Factors
 
 Competitive prices, reputation, service, and the ability to meet specific
 client needs for the optional equipment as well as timely delivery are the
 winning factors for selling U.S. sector products in Italy. A new-to-market
 U.S. supplier should strongly consider participating in the annual Genoa
 International <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Show, traditionally held around the third week of
 October.  It is truly considered one of the best, if not the most
 prestigious, <STRONG>boat</STRONG> shows in the world.  Since the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> show is held in the
 fall, trade participation is very high--drawing under a single roof
 approximately 1,400 exhibitors, of which 35% are foreign participants, and
 330,000 visitors--and much of the annual business is transacted in Genoa as
 dealers begin to build stock for the spring sales season.
 
 
 F.  MARKET ACCESS
 
 1.  Import Climate
 
 In Italy, pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> flying the Italian flag with a gross tonnage of
 more than 3 tons, an engine power greater than 18.4 kW, and with
 unrestricted service, must be registered in records which are kept by the
 port authorities.  Upon registration, the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> is given an identification
 number and a document which allows it to sail.  In order to obtain this
 registration, the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> has to comply with strict technical safety
 requirements, which are checked by means of a survey and tests.  The Italian
 Naval Register (RINA) is authorized by the Italian Maritime Administration
 to carry out the above.
 
 In order to avoid repeating the same tests on all identical <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, the law
 allows the above tests to be carried out on a prototype;  upon satisfactory
 completion of these tests RINA issues an document of approval called
 "Homologation Certificate".  Regarding the actual procedure, the following
 drawings of the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> are to be sent to RINA Head Office in Genoa for
 examination and approval:  structural drawings, drawings showing engine
 installation, fuel and bilge systems, electric plant, and drawings of the
 rudder and shaft brackets.  Once the drawings are examined, they are
 returned to the shipyard's agent, sometimes with recommendations to be
 complied with.  A physical survey is then carried by one of the RINA
 surveyors in the U.S. or directly by a surveyor from Italy.  The surveyor
 reports his findings to the Head Office in Genoa which, if satisfactory,
 issues the Homologation Certificate.  As previously stated, the certificate
 covers all the mass production of a certain model of pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG>.
 
 Prototypes of <STRONG>boat</STRONG> components which must be "homologated" include propulsion
 engines, non-metallic parts of fuel systems (including non metallic tanks),
 fans and blowers for gasoline motor propelled <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, and fire
 extinguishers.  There is no compulsory requirement for hull materials.
 
 Once a model has been "homologated" it is no longer necessary to submit all
 the others belonging to the same series to the tests already mentioned;  it
 is sufficient to provide the Maritime Authority with a copy of the
 "Homologation Certificate" on the back of which there must be a written
 declaration signed no longer by the U.S. manufacturer, but by his Italian
 agent stating that the product is built in conformity with the prototype.  A
 new requirement, dated July 30, 1991, issued by the Italian Maritime
 Administration, states that foreign shipyards who wish to "homologate" their
 prototypes for sale in Italy must have a legal agent resident in Italy.
 This agent must be authorized by the shipyard to carry out the
 "homologation" procedure on behalf of the foreign shipyard.  Moreover, this
 agent will indeed have to sign, on behalf of the shipyard, the statement of
 conformity for the mass-produced <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 For additional specifics, U.S. suppliers should contact RINA (see address in
 "Key Contacts" list.
 
 2.  Distribution/Business Practices
 
 Domestic producers usually sell directly to the end-users.  Imported
 products are generally retailed by distributors who carry a full spectrum of
 product lines.  These importers tend to represent more than one
 manufacturer, frequently three or four each one, specialized in a
 specific product segment.  There are presently approximately 3,000
 distribution outlets in Italy.  The more prestigious yachts are sold through
 brokers.
 
 As previously stated, the Italian government recently announced that only
 Italian citizens can act as agents for signing off on the homologation
 (standards) compliance documents.  This means that factory personnel of
 non-Italian <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturers imported into Italy cannot sign off on the
 paperwork.  Quite often it is the Italian dealers or distributors who signs
 off, and these people are Italian citizens.  However, if the manufacturer
 terminates the Italian dealer or distributor, that party "owns" the
 homologation and may charge the manufacturer a royalty for import on behalf
 of the new dealer or distributor.  Alternatively, the manufacturer can go
 through the expensive homologation procedure anew.
 
 The U.S. National Marine Manufacturers Associatin (NMMA) has made a ad-hoc
 third party available as the required citizen homologation agent for any
 NMMA <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builder, who can act on behalf of multiple <STRONG>boat</STRONG> companies, meeting
 their requirements of Italian citizenship for the agent, but without the
 downside difficulties of terminating a dealer or distributor who acts as
 homologation agent.  For further information, U.S. suppliers should contact
 NMMA (see address in "Key Contacts" list).
 
 List of Italian distributors and agents can be obtained through the U.S.
 Department of Commerce District Offices from our Commercial Information
 Management Systems database (CIMS) and the National Trade Data Bank (NTDB).
 Intersted companies may also request, through the same channels, and
 Agent/Distribution Service (ADS) or a Comparison Shopping Service (CSS).
 Both offer excellent value-for-money contacts and market information.
 
 3.  Financing
 
 Payments by importers are usually in "cash" or in maximum 60 days with a
 letter of credit.  It is very difficult to establish the mark-up imposed by
 local distributors/importers as it greatly varies, depending on the type of
 product.  Since U.S. products are in great demand because of their
 competitive consumer prices, it is deemed that the average mark-up is not
 very high, and that dealers prefer to rely on selling  large quantities.

 JAPAN -JAPANESE RECREATIONAL <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> MARKET-INDUSTRY ANALYSIS-ISA9103
 
 SUMMARY
 
 This article is derived from a report titled:  "The Japanese Recreational
 <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Market in Japan", dated March 1991, prepared by Wallace Offutt
 Consulting Co., Darien, Connecticut.  This article consists of 51 pages and
 contains the following subtopics:
 
       OVERVIEW
       MARKET ASSESSMENT
       COMPETITIVE SITUATION
       MARKET ACCESS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A.  OVERVIEW
 
 According to the Japanese Ministry of Transport, there is one recreational
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> for every 447 people in Japan.  In the United States, the figure is one
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> for every 15 Americans, or nearly thirty times the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> ownership found
 in Japan.
 
 Japan is a developing country with respect to recreational boating, but this
 situation is rapidly changing.  Japanese today are working fewer hours and
 taking more frequent and longer vacations.  The outlook is that improvement
 will continue in the future.  The government is taking measures to encourage
 fewer working hours and to promote more leisure activities, including marine
 recreation.  A resort development law is encouraging a national network of
 resorts, many on the seacoast, and the government has a ten year program to
 increase marina space from 50,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> to 400,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 Japan is at the beginning of a long cycle of growth in recreational
 boating.  While there is a shortage of marina space which will not be
 relieved soon, the main ingredient is already in place:  the Japanese
 consumer is ready and willing to spend money on <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  Even if Japan's
 pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> ownership eventually only reaches a fraction of  that of the
 U.S., there will be a great many <STRONG>boats</STRONG> sold in Japan over the next ten or
 twenty years.  Based upon Japanese domestic shipment data and import/export
 statistics, we estimate that the Japanese recreational <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market in 1990
 was nearly $600 million.  We estimate that growth will average around 8% per
 annum over the next three years.
 
 American manufacturers which have established a strong presence in the
 Japanese market have already seen very good business.  Between 1986 and
 1990, imports of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> into Japan increased some 14 times to reach over $385
 million.  Imports from the U.S. accounted for roughly half of this amount
 and in 1990 alone grew by 102%.
 
 The recent boating boom has also benefitted Japan's manufacturers.  Japan's
 boating giant, Yamaha Motor Company, as well as other local producers, have
 been upgrading their products and producing larger and larger <STRONG>boats</STRONG> to
 respond to consumers' desire for American-style <STRONG>boats</STRONG>. Japanese
 manufacturers are not prepared to cede their market to foreign manufacturers.
 
 As is the case with most products in Japan, consumers want high quality and
 good after-sales service in recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  Most imported <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are
 handled by local agents which provide the service demanded by Japanese
 consumers.  Foreign companies which are responsive to the marketplace and
 are careful about quality have done very well.
 
 American manufacturers have done especially well in the power <STRONG>boat</STRONG> segment,
 which constitutes around 95% of the market.  Japanese enjoy fishing and
 American sportsfishing <STRONG>boats</STRONG> have been very popular.  Most major American
 powerboat brands are found in Japan.  The Italian <STRONG>boat</STRONG> producers and
 Taiwanese-produced powerboats have also done well.   In sailboats, however,
 European models are generally preferred for their sturdy construction, their
 quality, and their interior designs.  The French, led by Beneteau, have the
 largest share of the sailboat market.
 
 There are no overt barriers to market entry.  However, Japan's <STRONG>boat</STRONG> operator
 licensing system is time consuming and costly, making it too difficult for
 newcomers to enter the market.  And there is an inspection system for new
 imported <STRONG>boats</STRONG> that is expensive, time consuming, outdated and unnecessary,
 the effect of which is to make market entry unnecessarily difficult for
 foreign manufacturers.  Most Japanese in the industry would like to see both
 of these systems changed.
 
 B.  MARKET ASSESSMENT
 
 THE CURRENT MARKET
 
 We estimate that the Japanese recreational <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market (including inflatable
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, power <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, sailboats, rowboats and personal watercraft) in 1990
 amounted to around Yen 89.1 billion ($594 million at 1990's average exchange
 rate of 1$ = 150).  This is a 49% increase from our estimate of Yen 59.7
 billion for 1989.  Tables A and B provide our estimates in U.S. dollars and
 in yen of the market size and growth over the next three years.  Tables 1
 through 15 at the end of this report provide detailed breakdowns of most of
 the figures in the table.
 
 The statistics for measuring the size of the market are somewhat
 questionable.  One problem is that the figures for domestic production,
 which are based on statistics compiled by the Japan Boating Industry
 Association (JBIA), appear to be somewhat incomplete. The JBIA data is based
 upon an annual survey of association members and other firms, and not all
 manufacturers are included.  While the Ministry of Finance (MOF) import and
 export figures appear to be very complete, their categories and those of the
 JBIA are in some cases different, making comparisons difficult.  A second
 problem is that JBIA-reported figures on personal watercraft imports and
 exports are larger than the MOF figures for the corresponding period,
 suggesting the possibility that these figures are not on the same base or
 that there is some over-reporting or double counting of these figures on the
 part of JBIA members.    With these caveats, the estimates given in Tables A
 and B seem to present a reasonable picture of the market.
 
 RECREATIONAL BOATING IN JAPAN
 
 <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Ownership
 
 According to estimates by the Japan Boating Development Center (JBDC), at
 the end of 1989 there were approximately 275,000 recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in use
 in Japan.  This compared with around 80,000 in 1970 and around 200,000 in
 1980.  Strong growth of recreational boating was seen in the early 1970s,
 but the oil crisis came as a blow to the industry and there was little
 growth after 1974.  By <STRONG>boat</STRONG> type, the JBDC estimates that in 1989 there were
 209,000 motorboats, 55,000 sailboats, and 11,000 inflatables.  With a
 population of 122.8 million (1988), this works out to approximately one <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 for every 447 Japanese.

 Receptivity Score:   Sailboats:  4   Powerboats:  5
 
 In contrast with Japan, in the United States, there were 10.8 million <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 registered in the fifty states and territories in 1989, according to U.S.
 Coast Guard figures published by the National Marine Manufacturers
 Association (NMMA).   However, in many states, smaller <STRONG>boats</STRONG> without engines
 do not have to be registered, and the NMMA estimates that there were 15.6
 million <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in use in that year.  That works out to be around one <STRONG>boat</STRONG> for
 every 15 persons, or 29 times the ownership in Japan.
 
 Most Japanese <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are small, probably as a consequence of the difficulties
 involved in finding marina space (see below).  According to data produced by
 the JBDC, approximately 13% of Japanese <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are below three meters in
 length, 41% are between three and four meters, 22% are between four and five
 meters,  9% are between 5-6 meters long, and 7% are between six and seven
 meters long.  Thus, 92% of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are below seven meters long.  Another 6%
 are between seven and eight meters long, leaving only 2% of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> over eight
 meters.

 Available data on <STRONG>boat</STRONG> ownership provides some interesting insights into the
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market.  Table C gives the results of a survey of 634 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> owners
 conducted in September, 1989 by the Japan Shipbuilding Promotion Council
 (Nihon Zosen Shinko Zaidan).
 
 It would appear that the larger and more expensive a <STRONG>boat</STRONG>, the less able an
 individual is to handle the expenses and the more likely it will be owned
 jointly by friends or by a corporation.  A 1990 Kazi Magazine <STRONG>boat</STRONG> users
 survey (see below) confirmed the basic finding of this survey that many
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in Japan are jointly owned.

 Leisure Time
 
 It is frequently pointed out that Japan is well behind the U.S. and the rest
 of the Western world when it comes to leisure activities.  In many respects,
 Japanese have less opportunity to participate in many leisure activities
 than do the citizens of other countries.  Japanese work longer hours and
 they have fewer vacation days per year.  They also have fewer leisure
 facilities per capita than many other countries, and such facilities are
 farther away from their homes.
 
 According to Japanese Ministry of Labor figures compiled by the Leisure
 Development Center, in 1987 the average Japanese in the manufacturing sector
 worked 2,168 hours per year.  This was 219 more hours than an American
 worker, 230 hours more than a British worker, 523 hours more than a French
 worker, and 526 hours more than a worker in West Germany.
 
 These longer working hours naturally result in fewer leisure hours and less
 vacation time.  In 1988, only seven percent of Japanese companies and 30% of
 Japanese workers had a complete five-day work week.  While nearly 53% of
 companies and 80% of workers had at least one Saturday off each month, the
 majority still had to work several Saturdays.  In addition to having fewer
 weekend days off, the average Japanese worker gets nine days of vacation per
 year versus 19 in the U.S., 23 in the U.K., 29 in West Germany, and 26 in
 France.
 
 However, the important thing to note is that things are changing in Japan.
 In 1970, 95% of companies and over 80% of workers worked every Saturday, so
 compared to that time, the present situation is far improved.  Beginning in
 1989, Japanese government offices began closing two Saturdays per month
 while the banking and securities industries went to a complete five-day work
 week.  The pressure on other companies to move in this direction continues
 to mount.  There is discussion about eliminating Saturday school hours in
 Japan, which would have a big impact on weekend family outings.  The
 government has an official target of achieving an 1,800 hour work week by
 the year 2,000.  The press reports that more companies are encouraging -
 some even requiring - their employees to take all of their vacation days,
 and to stagger vacations.  It is clear that the trend in Japan is towards
 more time for leisure and longer holidays.
 
 Japan's Boating Conditions
 
 As an archipelago, Japan is blessed with ample access to the sea.  Japan has
 some 33,000 kilometers of coastal shoreline.  While this is considerably
 less than the 85,500 kilometers which the U.S. (excluding Alaska, Hawaii and
 the territories) has, on a per capita basis the comparison is similar.  It
 is said that no one in Japan lives farther than 2-3 hours from the sea by
 road or rail.  On the other hand, compared with the U.S., Japan has
 relatively few lakes and rivers which can be used for pleasure boating.
 Since nearly half of all <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in the U.S. are used on such bodies of water,
 this suggests that boating in Japan is likely to develop along somewhat
 different lines.
 
 Further, Japan is situated in the temperate climate zone, and, with the
 exception of Okinawa and a few of the southern islands, it has no areas such
 as Florida or California where pleasure boating is a year-round activity.
 In northern Japan, pleasure boating is mostly a summer activity.  From Tokyo
 to the southwest, the most enthusiastic boaters will be active throughout
 much of the year, although the average boater will probably not be on the
 water for six months of the year.  In fact, for some boaters, the season is
 only three months, for June in Japan is normally very rainy, and October
 often brings typhoons, so many Japanese want to store their <STRONG>boats</STRONG> for the
 winter by the end of September.
 
 Since many Japanese boaters are boating in the ocean or in large bays open
 to the ocean, they must cope with rougher waters than most American boaters
 are used to.  Boaters in the Tokyo area, where one of the largest population
 centers is located, <STRONG>boat</STRONG> on Tokyo Bay, Sagami Bay or Suruga Bay, all of
 which are open to the sea and subject to rapidly changing conditions.  On
 the other hand, Japan's Inland Sea, situated between the main islands of
 Shikoku and Honshu, provides an area several hundred miles long and
 averaging perhaps 40 miles wide where there are many islands and very good
 boating conditions.
 
 In conclusion, boating conditions in Japan are perhaps not ideal, but they
 are sufficiently good to make boating an attractive leisure activity given
 sufficient industry promotional and educational activities, affordable
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, and adequate <STRONG>boat</STRONG> storage facilities.  It can be expected that the
 more soundly-built <STRONG>boats</STRONG> will be more suited to the Japanese market.
 
 Marina Facilities
 
 The <STRONG>boat</STRONG> storage situation in Japan is rather difficult to fathom.  On the
 one hand, official figures report that there are few marinas and few places
 to put <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  On the other hand, <STRONG>boat</STRONG> sales in Japan have been soaring and
 marinas advertise that they have space.  Somehow, most <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealers can find
 their customers a place to put their <STRONG>boats</STRONG>. No one talks as though the
 shortage of marina space is going to kill off the industry.
 
 There is no doubt that Japan suffers from a lack of accessable and
 reasonably priced marina facilities.  A chronic shortage of proper marina
 facilities has been an obstacle to the industry's growth to date, and it
 will no doubt continue to be this way for some years.  This is largely a
 consequence of the density of population in Japan, although the fishing
 industry in Japan also is an important obstacle, something that will be
 discussed further below.
 
 The official statistics on  marinas in Japan and the comparison with the
 United States show just how far behind Japan is in this area.  According to
 the National Marine Manufacturers Association, there were 8,320 marinas
 (including boatyards, yacht clubs, dockominiums, parks and others) in the
 United States as of the end of 1989.   In contrast, as is shown in Table D,
 Japan still has fewer than 400 marinas.

 1990.
 
 According to the Ministry of Transport, Japan's 378 marinas can accommodate
 approximately 50,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, with the 40 public marinas able to handle around
 10,450 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> (an average of 261 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> each) and private marinas handling
 another 40,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> (an average of 118 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> each).  Not only is the number
 of marinas small, but the individual marinas are also small.  The largest
 marina in Japan at the present time is the Enoshima Yacht Harbor, which
 accommodates 1,050 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 The next largest marinas are only half that size.  Japan's marinas are
 distributed as follows:  Hokkaido, 8; Tohoku, 10; Kanto (Tokyo area), 50;
 Hokuriku, 30; Tokai, 53; Kinki (Osaka area), 84; Chugoku, 61; Shikoku, 41;
 Kyushu/Okinawa, 40.
 
 The marinas that Japan has are expensive, although perhaps not as expensive
 as one might expect.  Nationwide, the average annual cost of a private
 harbor marina in 1990 was nearly $3,200, according to the results of the
 Kazi Magazine survey mentioned earlier.  This cost rises sharply for marinas
 in urban areas.  While the Kaji survey does not break down the cost of
 private marinas by region, the survey reported the average costs for all
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in Tokyo.  See Table E.

 We think that the official figures understate how many <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are actually
 stored at marinas.  There seem to be many marinas which have a large number
 of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> stored on land, and these do not seem to be in the official
 figures.  The Japanese boating magazines frequently carry lists of marina
 availability in Japan, and usually there are several hundred marinas showing
 storage availability.  Usually, however, this is land storage for small
 powerboats or sailing dinghies..  And often, space is only available for
 those who buy their <STRONG>boats</STRONG> through the marina.  The March, 1991 issue of Kazi
 Magazine listed 170 marinas which had a combined total of 4,671 available
 spots.  So there is storage, and the official data would lead one to believe
 that there is not a single spot to be had.
 
 The biggest problem appears to be the scarcity of marina space for large
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in the Tokyo area.  The public marinas have waiting lists of over ten
 years, and the private marinas are full.  In the event that a slip is
 available, there are very high up-front marina membership payments.  Wet
 marina storage in the Tokyo area is probably not an option for any but the
 very wealthy.  In the more remote areas, however, marina space is available
 at relatively reasonable rates.  150 miles from Tokyo in the Hokuriku
 district on the Sea of Japan, for example, nearly 50% of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are kept free
 of cost, and only about 7% of <STRONG>boat</STRONG> owners pay over Yen 300,000 per year to
 dock their <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 The Fisheries Problem
 
 It will be noticed that most of the above marinas are located in Japan's
 large bays or in the Inland Sea where there is natural protection from waves
 and weather.  There are few marinas located on coastal areas directly
 exposed to the ocean because of the expense of constructing breakwaters.
 Most natural ports in Japan are designated fishing ports where the fishing
 industry has extensive rights and where it is extremely difficult for
 private developers to build  marinas.  There are also many problems between
 recreational boaters and fishermen in places where the two activities
 coexist.  Fishermen complain of damaged nets, disruption from the wake from
 pleasure boaters, bad manners, etc.
 
 To understand the marina situation in Japan, it is essential to understand
 the situation with Japan's fishing industry.  It is difficult for most
 Americans to appreciate, but the fishing industry in Japan is still
 extremely important.  Japan has been the world's leading fishing nation,
 producing nearly 12.5 million tons of fish and seaweed, or 13% of the
 world's total, in 1987.  In terms of the production value of the catch,
 coastal fishing in by far the most important, followed by offshore fishing
 and then by deep-sea fishing.
 A visit to many ports even near Tokyo finds large numbers of fishing <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 actively engaged in fishing activities.
 
 Fishing is an ancient industry in Japan and it has always had a privileged
 position.  Following World War II, the Japanese Parliament in 1950 passed
 the Fishing Port Law in order to ensure a stable and secure supply of marine
 products and to promote efficient fishing operations.  The law established a
 system of fishing port management and official fishing port designation by
 the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF).  Ports
 designated as official fishing ports received development assistance,
 subsidies and protection from the government.   By 1956, some 2,611 ports
 had been officially designated as fishing ports, and the number has slowly
 grown over the years.  It is worth noting that, on average, only 104 fishing
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are based in each of Japan's 2,953 fishing ports.  Table F summarizes
 the fishing situation in Japan.
 
 In addition to fishing ports, there are 1,095 other ports and harbors which
 fall under the perview of the Ports and Harbors Law and which are important
 in international trade and domestic transportation.  Recreation is a low
 priority for the administrators of these ports and harbors.
 
 The relevance of this all for the recreational boating industry is that
 because of the "rights" of the fishing cooperatives in these ports, it has
 been extremely difficult (read "expensive") for private developers to
 develop marinas.  Fishing cooperatives have been able to successfully argue
 that pleasure boating (as well as other projects) encroaches on their rights
 to earn a livelihood, and they have been successful in forcing large
 payments in return for giving up their rights to various fishing areas.  It
 has been reported that local fishing unions won an award of around $300
 million when land-fill for the New Kansai International Airport displaced
 fishing grounds near Osaka, and that another large amount of compensation
 was paid to local fishing cooperatives when the new Tokyo Bay Bridge was
 constructed.

 "Unattended" <STRONG>Boats</STRONG>
 
 It was mentioned earlier that Japan's 378 marinas can "officially"
 accommodate around 50,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, and it was also mentioned that there are
 around 275,000 recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in Japan.  The natural question which
 arises is "Where are the other 225,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>?"  Table G provides the
 official explanation of where Japan's <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are kept and also presents the
 Ministry of Transport's <STRONG>boat</STRONG> storage goals for the year 2000.
 
 The "other storage" category in Table G refers to <STRONG>boats</STRONG> which are stored at
 home, etc.  Many inflatables, small dinghies, canoes and other small <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 fall into this category.  The "unattended" category needs explanation.
 These <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are also termed "illegally moored <STRONG>boats</STRONG>" (fuho keiryu) but
 "extra-legal" rather than "illegal" might be the best description, for in
 many cases the <STRONG>boats</STRONG> apparantly do not violate laws per se but merely are
 moored by their owners in harbors, rivers and coastal areas administered by
 government agencies where <STRONG>boat</STRONG> mooring is not authorized but where it is
 also not forbidden.  These rivers and other locations have thus become
 unofficial marinas, and <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealers will assist prospective <STRONG>boat</STRONG> buyers in
 locating a mooring spot in a nearby river.  Some <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealers even collect
 regular fees from <STRONG>boat</STRONG> owners to watch over their <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  The estimate of
 120,000 "unattended" <STRONG>boats</STRONG> is the official estimate but whether this is at
 all accurate is impossible to determine.

 Government authorities are not happy with the unattended <STRONG>boat</STRONG> situation, but
 appear to have accepted that they can do little about it.  The Ports and
 Harbors Bureau complains that such <STRONG>boats</STRONG> cause problems for the management
 and use of ports and rivers, but the problem has grown too big to be solved
 by any enforcement measures.  The <STRONG>boats</STRONG> simply have nowhere else to go and
 the government itself would be criticized for not doing anything to provide
 alternative facilities for these <STRONG>boats</STRONG> should they attempt to forbid <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 owners to use these areas.  So the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> dealers continue to sell <STRONG>boats</STRONG> to
 consumers and the latter continue to place them in Japan's rivers and
 canals.  Dealers and owners know where they can put <STRONG>boats</STRONG> where they will be
 left alone, and where they cannot.  Reportedly, warnings are occasionally
 issued to some <STRONG>boat</STRONG> owners but the authorities involved seem to take no
 other measures as long as the <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are causing no great harm.
 
 New Marina Development
 
 One of the major themes in Japan the past five or so years has been the
 necessity to increase domestic investment and demand as a way to increase
 imports and reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the rest of the world.
 This has been the oft-repeated demand of Japan's trading partners, and, at
 the same time, many in Japan have called for programs which will improve
 living standards for the Japanese people who have worked hard over the years
 to create Japan's successful economy.  These pressures from at home and
 abroad have resulted in a wide variety of measures over the past several
 years which should slowly alter the orientation of the Japanese economy
 towards more consumption, a higher standard of living, increased imports,
 and more leisure time and opportunities.
 
 Marine recreation has been singled out as one of the most important areas of
 emmphasis, and a variety of programs have been established to develop this
 area.  One important way in which this has been promoted is the so-called
 "Resort Law," which is the nickname for legislation that was passed in May,
 1987 to promote the development of resorts throughout Japan.  This law
 established special resort districts in every prefecture of the country so
 as to meet the present and future expected demand for resort development.
 Under this program, districts applied to the government to be designated as
 resort areas, which entitles them to tax incentives, low interest loans and
 accelerated public works assistance.  Nearly all of Japan's 47 prefectures
 have submitted applications for government resort area designation, and a
 large number of construction projects are under way.  While not all of these
 are marine resorts, a large number are, and over time these resorts will
 provide added opportunities for boating and create demand for marine
 equipment.
 
 The Ministry of Transport has been at the forefront of a number of plans to
 reinvigorate Japan's waterfront, and in 1985 it drew up a plan called "Ports
 and Harbors for the Twenty-First Century," under which a wide variety of
 goals and plans for improving and upgrading Japan's ports and harbors to
 make them more suitable for recreational usage were proposed.  In September,
 1988 the Ministry drew up a plan for upgrading Japan's marinas under which
 concrete goals for increasing the number of marinas and other facilities
 were advanced.  The most important element in the plan is to increase the
 number of pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> berths in Japan to 400,000 by the turn of the
 century and to eliminate all unattended <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  This plan is called the
 Marine Ninty-Nine Program.  Table G provides the details of the MOT plan.
 
 Under this plan, the MOT will undertake a number of steps to improve the
 marina situation.  In addition to continuing certain ongoing upgrading
 programs for public marinas, the Ministry is already proceeding with new
 marinas in 33 ports around Japan, and, to deal with the unattended <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 problem, it is creating in 32 ports simple <STRONG>boat</STRONG> mooring facilities (called
 "pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> spots").  Further, it will select additional ports which will
 be designated as important marine recreation areas and they will then be
 entitled to receive public works assistance.  The government will also
 provide interest free loans and other subsidies to private developers and
 public/private projects to develop new marinas.
 
 The Ministry's plan involves the construction of approximately 140 new
 public marinas, including 20 large-scale marinas which can accommodate over
 1,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, another 40 medium size marinas which can handle 500-1,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 each, and another 40 smaller marinas which can accommodate around 100-150
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> each.  On the private side, they envision another 270 new marinas
 which would bring the number of private marinas to around 600.  Considering
 the trends toward larger cruisers which have greater cruising ranges, the
 Ministry has a plan to place a series of "base marinas" more or less equal
 distances apart around the coast of Japan.   The MOT plans 800 "pleasure
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> spots" by the end of the decade.  It seems very likely that some of
 today's "unattended <STRONG>boat</STRONG>" parking areas will be turned into tomorrow's
 "pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> spots."
 
 The other important element of the MOT's Marine '99 plan is a system  for
 storing <STRONG>boats</STRONG> on land when not in use and transporting them to the water on
 special vehicles when the owners wish to use them.  The MOT is planning that
 by the year 2000, some 90,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> will be stored according to this "Hello
 My <STRONG>Boat</STRONG>" plan.  The Ministry conducted a feasibility study in 1987 and in
 the fall of 1988 private companies conducted experiments which determined
 the practicality of the plan.  In 1989 the Japan <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Development Center was
 established with the help of 70 private companies to put the plan into
 operation.  In April, 1990 a model operation began at a Kawasaki Steel plant
 site in Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo.  Unfortunately, the early stages of the
 operation have not gone well, and the organizers are restudying the matter.
 
 There is considerable skepticism in Japan about whether the ambitious plans
 of the MOT can be achieved.  Constructing new marinas has become a difficult
 proposition in any country, and it can only be even more difficult in Japan
 with its scarce and expensive land and its complex bureaucracy.  And the
 fishing cooperatives are a powerful force with well-recognized rights to the
 most attractive ports and waters.
 
 But there are some reasons to be optimistic.  Perhaps the main one is that
 the demographics of the fishing industry suggest that it will not always
 wield the monopoly over some of Japan's best ports and harbors that it
 presently does.  The fact is that the numbers of commercial fishermen in
 Japan are declining at a fairly rapid pace.  In 1980 there were some 457,400
 individuals employed in the industry, but by 1988 this had declined to
 392,400.
 
 Prospects are that the number will continue to decline.  According to data
 from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, 23.3% of all
 fishermen in 1988 were over the age of 60, while another 49.6% were between
 the ages of 40 and 60.  A career as a fisherman is not a very attractive
 prospect for a young Japanese today.
 
 There have already been a number of cases where fishing cooperatives have
 accepted partial ownership in marinas in exchange for giving up their
 rights, or a portion of their rights, to certain harbors and waters, and
 both the MOT and the MAFF are encouraging more cooperation between the
 industry and developers.  A career in the marina business may seem
 considerably more attractive to the children of a fisherman than a career on
 a fishing <STRONG>boat</STRONG>, and this could be a way to keep some of the younger people
 in Japan's fishing villages.  The cynical view is that the fishermen are
 merely holding out for large monetary payments, for, as mentioned earlier,
 certain cooperatives have have been very successful at doing this in the
 past.  But there are limits and there is a growing view that the waters
 belong to everyone, not only the fishermen.
 
 In view of the government's support and growing public demand for more
 leisure facilities, it seems safe to conclude that the number of marinas and
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> mooring facilities will continue to grow steadily over the next ten
 years.  Unfortunately, many of the new facilities will not be built where
 they are most needed - in the Tokyo area - but in the rest of Japan where it
 will probably become easier to find a place to keep a <STRONG>boat</STRONG>.  Tokyoites will
 continue to have a unattractive choices and high costs for storing their
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  One task will be to find other solutions to answer the demand of
 people living in the capital for boating activities.  This might be in the
 form of  charters or joint-ownership at other locations in Japan,
 time-sharing, or other solutions.
 
 
 <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Operators License System
 
 The Ministry of Transport requires that an operator's license be obtained in
 order to operate all <STRONG>boats</STRONG> with the exception of small dinghies and rowboats
 without motors.  There is a rather complicated system of five license
 classes, but most pleasure boaters obtain either a Fourth Class license or a
 First Class license.  A Fourth Class license may be used for <STRONG>boats</STRONG> weighing
 less than 5 metric tons.  Further, the Fourth Class licensee may not take
 his <STRONG>boat</STRONG> beyond certain calm water areas or farther than 5 nautical miles
 offshore.  For <STRONG>boats</STRONG> weighing more than 5 tons but less than 20 tons, a
 First Class operator's license is required.  This license permits <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 operation up to 100 nautical miles.  To go beyond this limit, it is required
 that a licensed engineer be on board.  The parameters of these two license
 classes determine how quite a few <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are designed an marketed in Japan,
 for manufacturers are anxious that Fourth Class licensees owners can operate
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in the thirty-foot range, while at the upper end of the First Class
 license range boatmakers are careful that they do not produce a <STRONG>boat</STRONG> that
 requires a commercial pilot to operate.
 
 Both licenses require physical examinations, written tests, and <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 handling tests.  Most Japanese attend one of a number of dozens of such
 schools which offer <STRONG>boat</STRONG> license courses.  For the Fourth Class license,
 typically, there are 15 hours of classroom time for the written test and
 then another 12 hours of classroom time to prepare for the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> handling
 test.  For the First Class license, the respective figures are 40 hours and
 20 hours.  The costs of taking these courses run around Yen 100,000 ($740)
 for the Fourth Class course, and Yen 150,000 to Yen 200,000 ($1,111 - $1480)
 for the First Class course.  Licenses are good for five years and may be
 renewed.  Most boating schools also offer "<STRONG>boat</STRONG> license loans" so that
 students can pay for their courses on an installment plan.
 
 Many Japanese in the industry - although not the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> license schools -
 complain that the license system is too strict and limits the number of
 people who will be attracted to boating.
 
 End User Profile
 
 There are a number of fairly distinct market segments in the Japanese
 recreational boating market.  While the market may be well behind that of
 the U.S., it is nevertheless large and mature enough to have been divided
 into various segments for many years.  Thus, in terms of market segments,
 the Japanese market is not too different from that of the U.S. in most
 respects.
 
 One important difference between the Japanese market and the U.S. market is
 that there is very little <STRONG>boat</STRONG> trailering in Japan.  In the U.S. there were
 5.9 million <STRONG>boat</STRONG> trailers owned in 1989, according to NMMA figures.  This
 corresponds to one-third of the number of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in the U.S.  In Japan, the
 market is so small that the JBIA does not measure it.  The reasons are
 understandable.  First, most Japanese have small houses on small lots.
 Often there is no place for a car, let alone a <STRONG>boat</STRONG> trailer.  Second, <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 trailer registration is expensive and the weight limit that a passenger car
 may tow is 750 kilograms including the trailer.  Third, roads, especally in
 residential areas, are narrow and it would be impossible to navigate in many
 neighborhoods with a trailer.  Finally, there are few <STRONG>boat</STRONG> launching ramps
 and few places to park a car with attached trailer while using the <STRONG>boat</STRONG>.
 These points apply to Japan's urban areas; the situation is different in the
 countryside and <STRONG>boat</STRONG> trailers are likely to become more common in the
 future.  There is a Japanese importer handling EZ Loader Trailers who has
 developed a small dealer network and who advertises in the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> magazines,
 but the market is so far very small.
 
 In March, 1991, Kazi Company, Ltd., Japan's largest marine publisher and the
 company which produces the monthly boating magazine Kazi, published the
 results of an extensive <STRONG>boat</STRONG> user survey of Kazi Magazine readers conducted
 in October, 1990.   The company received 4,573 responses so the sample is
 reasonably large.  The types of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> used by survey respondents were as
 follows:
 
              Sailboats                   Motorboats

 RECEPTIVITY RATINGS
 
 In Table A we assigned a score of "4" to end-user receptivity to
 American-made recreational sailboats and a score of "5" to end-user
 receptivity to American-made power <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, meaning that we judge that
 Japanese consumers are very receptive to American-made sailboats and
 extremely receptive to American-made powerboats.  Our rationale is explained
 below.
 
 
 Sailboats
 
 American sailboats are generally seen by Japanese sailers, dealers,
 manufacturers and other knowledgeable industry specialists as being of good
 design and of better quality than locally produced Japanese sailboats.  Many
 Japanese sailers start out with an inexpensive Yamaha sailboat and then in a
 few years upgrade to a larger foreign-made sailboat.  There are very few
 locally produced sailboats in Japan above 10 meters, so those who want to
 own a bigger <STRONG>boat</STRONG> have little choice but to look at a foreign-made <STRONG>boat</STRONG>.
 
 Yet American-made sailboats are generally ranked below European sailboats in
 Japan.  They are seen as being generally less well-made, having more
 problems with leaks and quality, and as having interiors which are less
 attractive and sophisticated.  Also, interior workmanship is often
 criticized.  Some Americn sailboats have had many problems in the Japanese
 market, and this has hurt the reputation of all American <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  In general,
 U.S. East Coast sailboat manufacturers are seen as having superior products
 best suited to the rough Japanese seas.  Additional information on the
 competitive position of American sailboats is presented below.
 
 
 Powerboats
 
 Japanese consumers are extremely receptive to American powerboats.  The
 American powerboat industry is seen as being the world's leader, making many
 models and types which are available nowhere else.  America is seen as being
 the land of leisure, and American powerboats seem to typify this image.
 American powerboats have been dominant in the high end of the Japanese
 market for some years.  Japanese boating magazines are full of pictures and
 articles about Americana powerboats in which the <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are analyzed and
 discussed in great detail.  In terms of price, American <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are very
 competitive, as many American companies can produce in large volume.  As in
 the case of sailboats, Japanese will often start out with a small
 domestically-produced powerboat and upgrade to an American powerboat at a
 later date.  Additional information on the competitive position of American
 powerboats in the Japanese market is presented below.
 
 
 BEST SALES PROSPECTS
 
 We think that there are good sales prospects in nearly every category of
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> with the exceptions of sailing dinghies and small rowboats.  American
 and European companies are successfully marketing an extremely wide variety
 of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in Japan, whether they be small inflatables or large luxury
 cruisers.  Anything which is of exceptional quality or unique design has a
 very good chance of being successful in Japan.  On the other hand, products
 of poor or uneven quality are unlikely to succeed, no matter what their
 price.  But a product does not have to be absolutely top quality to succeed
 in Japan.  A number of low price point products are very successful in
 Japan.  The main characteristic they share is appropriate pricing and
 consistently good quality control.  As the Japanese market continues to grow
 and more middle class consumers are attracted, the growth will be seen in
 the moderately-priced products rather than the luxury class items.
 
 We think the following products will be in especially high demand over the
 next two or three years:
 
 *sailboats over 30 feet
 
 *sportsfishing <STRONG>boats</STRONG> over 20 feet
 
 *outboard sports <STRONG>boats</STRONG> over 18 feet
 
 *luxury cruisers over 30 feet
 
 *high performance <STRONG>boats</STRONG> 20-30 feet

 C.  COMPETITIVE SITUATION
 
 Japanese <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Production
 
 According to figures produced by the Japan Boating Industry Association
 (JBIA), in 1989 36 Japanese <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturers produced 22,920 motorboats
 valued at Yen 21.1 billion ($156 million).  This was an increase of 12.3% in
 production and 41.3% in value over 1988.  Of these 22,920 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, 63%
 (14,470) were inflatables, with most of the remainder FRP.  Of the
 inflatables, 71% were exported, mostly to the U.S. and Europe.  Table H
 below provides details on domestic motorboat production.  Table 9 at the end
 of this report provides JBIA statistics on Japanese pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> shipments
 by major <STRONG>boat</STRONG> type for 1987-1989 as well as our estimates for 1990 and
 1991.  Tables A and B on pages 4 and 5 provide our estimates of the size of
 the overall Japanese market for recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.

 Although inflatables accounted for 63% of unit production, we estimate that
 they accounted for only around 7% of shipment value, or around Yen 1.4
 billion.  Excluding inflatables, we estimate that FRP and other motorboat
 shipments were valued at around Yen 19.7 billion ($146 million).  The more
 rapid increase in 1989 shipment value compared with production appears
 related to increased production of larger and more expensive <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  Table I
 shows recent trends in unit production and shipment value.

 Of 8,450 non-inflatable powerboats produced in 1989, approximately 48% were
 of the cabin type.  This is a change from pre-1988 years, when the
 production of cabin-type motorboats had outnumbered open-type motorboats.
 In 1988 the numbers were nearly the same, and in 1989 production of
 open-type motorboats exceeded cabin-types by 300 units.  Of 8,450
 non-inflatable motorboats, only 500 were longer than eight meters and only
 183 exceeded 10 meters in length.  Table J provides breakdowns by size and
 type.
 
 Sailboat shipments in 1989 totaled Yen 2.9 billion, with production at 1,621
 units.  72% of sailboat unit production was of sailing dinghies less than
 five meters in length.  The remaining 451 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> were sailboats with cabins.
 These accounted for around 28% of sailboat production, up eight percentage
 points from 1988.  80% of cabin-type sailboats were between seven and nine
 meters.  Only 22 sailboats produced in Japan were more than ten meters in
 length.  All but two sailboats were constructed of FRP.  Table K provides
 sailboat production data for 1989.
 
 Sailboat production has been falling in Japan over the past several years,
 with volume falling more rapidly than shipment value, indicating that the
 per-unit value has been rising.  The largest decline in 1989 production was
 in the 4-5 meter length sailing dinghy class, indicative of a trend away
 from smaller sailboats.  Since 1985, the average length of a
 domestically-produced sailboat has risen from 5.0 meters to 5.7 meters in
 1989.  The JBIA reports that increases in

 the 7-8 meter sailboat category are also helping to raise the average

 Another category of pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> produced in Japan are collectively termed
 "rowboats" and includes <STRONG>boats</STRONG> with oars, pedalboats, canoes and the like.
 These account for around 5% 1989 domestic shipments by  value.  Table 9
 provides figures for 1987-89.  40,696 rowboats were produced in 1989, of
 which 85% were rubber inflatables, mostly between two and three meters in
 length.  Table M shows unit production and shipment value from 1985 to 1989.
 
 Personal watercraft (jet skis or water scooters) shipment values for 1987-89
 are shown in Table 9 at the end of this report.  This is a fairly new market
 in Japan but it has been a major product area for two Japanese companies,
 Yamaha and Kawasaki, for some years.   When these products were first
 developed in the 1970's, the major market developed in the United States and
 Kawasaki began building its "Jet Skis" in the U.S.  Yamaha also entered the
 personal watercraft market but by exporting from Japan until it started
 local production in the U.S. in 1989.  When the Japanese market began to
 develop in the mid-1980s, Yamaha could supply it from its plant in Japan and
 Kawasaki began exporting to Japan from its U.S. plant.
 
 According to JBIA data, production of personal watercraft in Japan amounted
 to 19,019 units in 1987, 39,487 units in 1988, and 40,409 in 1989.  Since
 Kawasaki does not produce personal watercraft in Japan, presumably this
 production is nearly all Yamaha's.
 
 Table 9 provides our estimates for domestic shipments for 1990 and 1991.  We
 expect a decline in total production in 1991 due to a further shift in
 offshore production of personal watercraft.  However, we estimate that in
 1992, domestic production will increase again, so that for the next three
 years we are estimating average growth of 5% for domesstic production.  See
 pages 4 and 5 for our estimates.

 Domestic Exports
 
 Exports of Japanese pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> from 1988 to 1990 are shown in Table 10.
 Because of the introduction of the harmonized system (HS) of tariff codes in
 1988, the export figures for 1987 and 1986 are not on the same base, but
 they are shown in parentheses in Table 8.  Presumably the totals are
 comparable.  It may be seen that exports in all categories are declining.
 Obviously the rise in the value of the yen has hurt the competitiveness of
 many Japanese <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  Exports of powerboats and sailboats have nearly
 disappeared (most of those that remain are being exported to the
 Asia/Pacific region), inflatables are declining gradually, and the category
 "Other Pleasure <STRONG>Boats</STRONG>" is declining steadily after increasing sharply in
 1987 and 1988.  We think that this category is primarily personal watercraft
 and the decline seemed to coincide with the Yamaha's commencement of local
 production in the U.S.   Engines and drive trains are still being exported
 from Japan for assembly with U.S.-produced hulls, but these exports would
 show up in other HS categories.
 
 Perhaps 80% of Japan's <STRONG>boat</STRONG> exports are accounted for by Achilles, the large
 inflatable producer, and Yamaha, the large personal watercraft producer.
 
 For the above reasons, we estimate that total Japanese pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> exports
 will continue to decline by 15% per annum over the next three years.  See
 Tables A and B on pages 4 and 5.
 
 
 The Japanese <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Manufacturers
 
 As mentioned earlier, some 36 Japanese <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturers took part in the
 JBIA's 1989 survey.  While there seem to be a few manufacturers which were
 not included, they are very small companies.  In fact, most of the
 participants in the JBIA survey themselves are small as well.  Japan really
 has only one manufacturer which dominates the boatbuilding industry.  That
 company is the Yamaha Motor Company.
 
 
 Yamaha
 
 The Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. in 1955 was spun off from its then parent, Nippon
 Gakki, which is now known as Yamaha Corporation, the world's largest musical
 instrument manufacturer.  Today, Yamaha Motor is a publicly listed company
 but it is still part of the Yamaha group, with Yamaha Corporation owning 33%
 of its outstanding stock.
 
 Yamaha Motor (below "Yamaha") began its independent existence as a
 motorcycle maker but over the years diversified into a wide variety of
 mainly leisure products.  Today, in addition to marine products, the company
 makes automobile engines, snow-mobiles, generators, golf cars, diesel
 engines, all-terrain vehicles, and many other products.  For the year to
 March, 1990, parent company net sales amounted to Yen 413 billion (over $3
 billion).  Consolidated sales were nearly Yen 600 billion ($4.4 billion).
 
 Marine division sales reached Yen 101 billion ($750 million) in the fiscal
 year to March, 1990.  This division produces outboard and inboard engines,
 all types of dinghies, motorcruisers, fishing <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and sailboats, personal
 watercraft, small and medium-size commercial fishing <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, Japanese-style
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, sightseeing <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, swimming pools, marine clothing, and other items.
 Exports amounted to 55% of this division's total sales, but export growth
 was flat in the year to March, 1990 while domestic sales increased by 21% to
 Yen 45.6 billion.
 
 During the six months to September, 1990, marine product sales grew by 19.7%
 over the year-earlier six month period.  During this period, domestic sales
 grew by 27.5%, reflecting the strong domestic market during 1990, and
 exports grew by 11.4%.
 
 In addition to its own <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturing and sales activities, Yamaha is
 import agent for Trojan Yachts, Tiara Sportboats, Pursuit sportsfishing
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, Thunderbird Formula speed <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, and sailboats manufactured by the
 French company, Jeanneau.
 
 Yamaha also is engaged in marina operation and development and many boating
 industry educational and promotion activities.  It operates 230 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> license
 schools throughout Japan and many other schools to teach sailing,
 motorcruiser operation, sportfishing, personal watercraft operation, and
 other activities.  It also operates marine clubs and is opening a <STRONG>boat</STRONG> and
 yacht rental operation.
 
 Yamaha also sponsors a number of yacht races, the foremost of which is the
 Yamaha Osaka Cup, a sailboat race from Australia to Osaka, Japan.  In
 addition, the company organizes or co-sponsors a large number of races,
 cruises, jamborees, etc. all around Japan.  Yamaha helped to construct
 Japan's entry in the America's Cup race and is an official sponsor of the
 event.
 
 Since producing its first FRP <STRONG>boat</STRONG> in 1960, Yamaha has steadily built up its
 pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> business to the point where it dominates the market in Japan
 for such <STRONG>boats</STRONG> under 10 meters.  Recently, as Japanese consumers have been
 showing great interest in larger cruisers and sailboats, Yamaha has begun to
 produce larger <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  At the 1991 Tokyo International <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Show, Yamaha
 introduced a new 60 foot luxury motorcruiser, a 50 foot motoryacht, a 51
 foot sportfishing motoryacht, a 38 foot sportfishing <STRONG>boat</STRONG>, and a 38 foot
 cabin cruiser.  In the sailboat area, the company brought out a 34 foot
 cruiser.  Thus, Yamaha is clearly aiming at the entire market, and shows no
 signs of leaving the high end of the market to foreign manufacturers.
 
 It is extremely difficult to estimate Yamaha's share of the domestic <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 market.  It is often said in Japan that Yamaha has a market share of around
 50%, but it is very difficult to document this in view of the lack of public
 data.  In view of the fact that <STRONG>boat</STRONG> imports grew by over 500% between 1987
 and 1990, considerably more rapidly than domestic <STRONG>boat</STRONG> production, it seems
 likely that Yamaha's overall share has declined over this period.  We think
 that Yamaha's share in <STRONG>boats</STRONG> under 30 feet may be as high as 70%, but in
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> above 30 feet their share is very likely less than 10%.
 
 
 Other Japanese <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Manufacturers
 
 Achilles Corporation.  Japan's largest manufacturer of inflatable <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  A
 high percent of sales are exported to the U.S.
 
 Nissan Marine.  This is the Marine division of Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.
 Nissan's involvement with the marine industry began when it entered the
 marine engine market in 1970.  In 1973 Nissan began to manufacture power
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and today has a full lineup of small and medium-size cruisers and
 fishing <STRONG>boats</STRONG> up to 27 feet, and the company has plans to bring out a 33
 footer.  Nissan also produces outboards and began exporting them in 1985.
 Inflatables are another product area the company has entered.  Nissan
 operates four marinas in Japan as well as boating schools.  Marine sales
 appear to be around one-fifth those of Yamaha.  Nissan manufactures two
 models of J-<STRONG>Boats</STRONG> (the J-24 and the J-29) in Japan under license from the
 American manufacturer, and imports Blackfin and Sport-craft <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 Yanmar Diesel.  This is another company that has taken its engine expertise
 and applied it to pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  The company established a marine leisure
 sales division in mid-1988 and in early 1989 set up a separate pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 sales company.  It manufactures a line of eight inexpensive fishing cruisers
 and runabouts, the largest of which is a 33 foot fishing cruiser with flying
 bridge.  The company also is a dealer for Bayliner cruisers, Ferritti <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 from Italy, and Wetjets, personal watercraft from WetJet International of
 the U.S.
 
 Okumura <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Co., Ltd.  Based in Hyogo Prefecture, the company claims to be
 the world's largest producer of Snipe sailing dinghies, having built a total
 of 3,500 of them since 1970.  The company also produces other sailing
 dinghies as well as a small number of 30 foot sailing cruisers.  In 1988
 Okumura began to market imported sailboats and to date has sold around 50
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  Okumura has 20 employees.
 
 Okazaki Shipbuilding.  Produces 30 foot sailboats, a 33 foot motor sailer,
 and a 37 foot sloop.  Also imports Dutch Trintella sloops, and a number of
 other Northern European sloops and motor sailers.
 
 Mitsubishi Heavy Industry.  A newcomer to recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, the company is
 presently marketing one 25 foot powerboat and two 28 foot cruisers with
 flying bridges.  The company also imports Westerly sailboats from the U.K.,
 Tresfjord powerboats from Norway,  Viking motorcruisers from the U.S., and
 luxury motorcruisers from White-water International of the U.K.
 
 New Japan Yacht Co., Ltd.  Based in Shizuoka, the company produces a range
 of sailboats from 18 feet up to 36.5 feet.  It also markets <STRONG>boat</STRONG> fittings
 and accessories.  The company runs color ads for its Mirabelle 375, a 36.5
 foot sailing cruiser, which emphasize that the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> is made in Japan and
 designed to be especially strong for the "special" conditions found in
 Japan's waters.  The company also produces a series it calls Libeccio which
 has an extremely deep cockpit for safety.
 
 Step Marine.  Produces 30-40 foot sailboats with center cockpit or pilot
 house.  Claims to have built 100 of these sailboats.  Also builds a 30 foot
 houseboat.  Located in Kanagawa Prefecture.
 
 Tsuboi Craft Co., Ltd.  A Nagoya-based manufacturer with 10 emmployees,
 Tsuboi produces two lines of racing-oriented cruising sailboats between 28
 and 33 feet.  The company strives to build high performance cruisers which
 fit Japanese consumer tastes.
 
 
 In addition to the above, there are at least another five or six small
 producers of sailboats, ten or so more other companies producing power
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, and at least 20 small manufacturers of sailing dinghies.  It may be
 seen that with the exception of eight or ten manufacturers, boatbuilding in
 Japan is not much more than a family enterprise at the present time.
 
 
 Imports
 
 As may be seen in Tables A and B and in Table 4 at the end of this report,
 pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> imports have been soaring over the past several years.  Total
 imports in 1990 amounted to Yen 52,620 million, an increase of 89% over
 1989.   Imports rose by 84% in 1989,  81% in 1988 and 130% in 1987.  Between
 1986 and 1990, imports increased by 14.5 times.  We estimate that in 1990,
 imports accounted for 59% of the total Japanese pleasure boating market.
 
 We think that there are a variety of reasons for this rapid expansion of
 imports:
 
 1.  The rise in the value of the yen since 1985 has made foreign-made <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 priced in yen much cheaper.
 
 2.  The elimination of heavy commodity taxes effective April, 1989 also
 permitted the domestic prices of imported <STRONG>boats</STRONG> to decline.   (See below.)
 
 3.  The Japanese economy has been growing rapidly during these years, giving
 consumers confidence to make large purchases.
 
 4.  Japanese have gradually been having more free time and are more
 interested in leisure activities.  This has attracted many new companies
 into leisure businesses, including the pleasure boating industry.  These
 companies have been agressively looking around the world for attractive
 products to bring into Japan.
 
 5.  The Japanese government's programs to promote imports may have provided
 a more positive environment for both importers and consumers.
 6.  The absence of a large thriving domestic industry, particularly in the
 market for larger <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, has meant that there has been no alternative
 domestic source.
 
 7.  Supplying the Japanese market for personal watercraft from its U.S.
 plant has allowed Kawasaki to make a contribution to Japan's imports.
 
 
 Outlook for Imports
 
 It is extremely difficult to forecast the future outlook for imports.  We
 think that over the long term, the Japanese market for recreational boating
 will continue to grow rapidly as Japan catches up (or at least partially
 catches up) with Western levels of marine recreation.  However, we think
 that it is unlikely that imports will continue to grow at the pace they have
 over the past five years, primarily because the absolute amount of imports
 has become so large but also because the past five years have been very
 unusual in terms of economic growth and currency fluctuations.  Further, the
 outlook for 1991 is somewhat negative because of slower economic growth in
 Japan and around the world.  We think that imports are likely to remain flat
 in 1991, or even decline somewhat from 1990's unusually high level.
 However, we think that growth can resume again in 1992 and 1993, so that for
 the three year period 1991-93 we are estimating average annual growth of
 around  7%.
 
 
 U.S. Imports
 
 Table 5 at the end of this report presents Japanese pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> imports by
 country for 1988-90.  It may be seen that U.S. imports account for around
 half of all pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> imports into Japan.  The percentage of American
 imports among total imports has remained more or less constant over this
 time.  We estimate that the  American share of the entire Japanese pleasure
 boating market was 28.6% in 1990, compared with 21.4% in 1988 and 22.3% in
 1989.  The factors behind U. S. import growth are the same as those listed
 above.  We expect that imports from the U.S. will grow the same as total
 imports over the next three years, or at an annual rate of 7%.
 
 Imports of American powerboats are slightly over half of all powerboat
 imports and, since this is the biggest market segment in Japan, are the main
 source of the U.S. import strength (see Table 7).  Imports of power <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 from Italy account for 16% of powerboat imports, followed by those from
 Taiwan (10.9%), the United Kingdom (7.6%) and Sweden (5.7%).  In the
 category "Other <STRONG>boats</STRONG> for pleasure and sports use" (Table 8), imports from
 the United States constitute 84% of all imports.  We believe that over half
 of this category is personal watercraft manufactured by Kawasaki in the
 United States.  However, in sailboats, the American share of total Japanese
 imports is only 14.4%, which was second behind France, which had 28% of the
 total.  The United Kingdom is third, with 10.9%.  See Table 6.
 
 For reference, U.S. Department of Commerce statistics on American exports to
 Japan are provided in Tables 1-3, and Tables 13-15.  In general, the U.S.
 totals are close to the Japanese figures, but there are differences because
 the U.S. exports are broken down in six categories whereas the Japanese
 imports are divided only among four categories.  The figures would not be
 expected to track exactly due to differences in timing and because the
 Japanese import figures would reflect freight and insurance costs.
 
 The U.S. strength in the Japanese powerboat market, as compared with the
 sailboat market, seems to be related to the fact that vis-a-vis their
 European competitors, American <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturers are relatively stronger in
 powerboats than they are in sailboats.  Over 95% of the huge U.S. $6.0
 billion market for pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> is powerboats, so there are a large number
 of American powerboat manufacturers producing a huge variety of products at
 many different price points.  On the other hand, the European recreational
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market is much more of a sailboat market, and European sailboats are
 thought by Japanese sailers to be of generally better quality and design.
 Since Europeans are also much more accustomed to exporting and doing
 business in foreign markets than are American manufacturers, it may be that
 they have paid more attention to the Japanese market than have American
 sailboat makers, who have a huge market at home.
 
 
 American Suppliers
 
 Virtually all American motorboats and sailboats that are sold in the
 Japanese market are imported by Japanese agents and sold through Japanese
 distributors.  This seems to be true for European <STRONG>boats</STRONG> as well.  There do
 not appear to be any American <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturers which have established
 their own subsidiaries or distribution.
 
 There are dozens of types of American <STRONG>boats</STRONG> being sold in the Japanese
 market.  There is no data available on market shares, but nearly all of the
 major American <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturers have some kind of distribution in the
 Japanese market.  Particularly prominent American makes in Japan in
 powerboats are:  Albin, Bayliner, Bertram, Carver, Four Winns, Grady-White,
 Hatteras, Hinckley, Sea Ray, and Wellcraft.  In sailboats, Island Packet,
 J-<STRONG>Boats</STRONG>, Pearson and Sabre are prominent.
 Among non-American powerboats, Sweden's Storebro is very prominent in the
 luxury cruiser category.  The Italian-made Riva and Ferretti are also
 well-known, as is Australia's Precision Yachts.  President Yachts from
 Taiwan is also prominent.  In the sailboat category, Beneteau is the
 dominant company, while  other well-known brands in Japan are Jeanneau and
 Gib'sea from France, Contest and Winner from Holland, and Hans Christian and
 Westerly from the U.K.
 
 
 COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE MARKET
 
 The Japanese pleasure boating market is sufficiently diverse that there is
 no one formula for success.  There are many niches, many different price
 points, and many approaches.  The following are some general comments on
 important factors for succeeding in the market.
 
 In the high end of the market, whether for powerboats or for sailboats,
 price is less important than quality and service.  Buyers of luxury yachts
 in Japan are the very wealthy or corporations who will have their <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 serviced and cared for by a marina providing all services.  In this market,
 manufacturer's reputation, past performance, dealer reputation, and service
 system will be most important.  Owners will demand the very best quality,
 particularly for the interior.  Owners will expect that their <STRONG>boats</STRONG> will
 never leak from Japan's frequent and heavy rains.  They will expect the
 interior woodwork to be perfect.  In general, yachts which have had the best
 reputation abroad and which have a Japanese dealer with good connections and
 reputation will be the most successful.  Many Japanese industry sources
 indicate that European firms have the best record of providing the kind of
 quality and service expected in this market segment.  Initial selling price
 is high in Japan because the dealer will have to look after the <STRONG>boats</STRONG> he
 sells for a long time.
 
 Price is much more important in the middle and lower part of the market, of
 course, but reputation, quality, dealer and service are still very
 important.  The most successful companies in Japan are those which are able
 to incorporate changes which their Japanese dealers request, and which are
 able to respond immediately when there are problems.  But the Japanese often
 point out that their approach to manufacturing is to make sure there are no
 problems to begin with, not just to be good at fixing problems after they
 occur.  Thus, quality control on products sent to Japan is extremely
 important.  Once products or companies get bad reputations in Japan, it is
 extremely difficult to get a second chance.
 
 A manufacturer aiming at any kind of volume sales in Japan needs an agent
 who can create a nationwide dealer network.  Japanese language promotional
 materials must be prepared and regular advertising in the appropriate
 magazines is necessary.   Depending on the type of product, an agent with
 connections to or relations with marinas might be important.  After-sales
 service must be available.  Japanese consumers are very conscious of a
 company's name and reputation.  Buying a product like a <STRONG>boat</STRONG> is like joining
 a club in Japan, and people do not want to join a club with a bad
 reputation, even if it is cheap.
 
 The universal advice from Japanese industry sources and successful foreign
 firms in Japan is to do your homework before you act and make sure that you
 are tying up with the right company before making any commitments.  Most
 foreign firms with relationships in Japan are being represented by a
 Japanese dealer who approached the foreign company and asked to represent
 them in Japan.  In most cases, the foreign company agreed and a relationship
 was launched.  Some relationships worked out well and some did not.  In many
 cases, a better agent could have been found if the foreign manufacturer had
 taken the time to learn about the market and looked around for a more
 suitable agent.  One problem today is that there are already many tie-ups,
 and so a newcomer may have to look harder.
 
 Additional information on the distribution  system is presented below in the
 section on distribution and business practices.
 
 PART IV
 
 D.  MARKET ACCESS
 
 Import Climate
 
 There are no longer tariffs on pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> imported into Japan.
 Commodity taxes ranging from 15% to 30% on imported <STRONG>boats</STRONG> that existed in
 the past were eliminated in 1989.   There are no quotas or other
 restrictions.  There is a three-percent consumption tax which is levied on
 all transactions in Japan.
 
 Japan maintains some rather onerous inspection requirements which must be
 met before <STRONG>boats</STRONG> may be registered in Japan.  While the standards apply to
 Japanese manufacturers as well as foreign manufacturers, the requirements
 are well known to the Japanese companies and are taken into account when
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are designed for use in Japan.  In addition, there is a system of
 inspection at the time of manufacture which foreign manufacturers who wish
 to take advantage of it can use.
 
 Most foreign-made <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, however, are not designed with these standards in
 mind, so when they are first brought into Japan, they must go through a
 time-consuming and expensive process of being inspected.  The authorities
 require detailed drawings and physically inspect hulls, engines, propeller
 shafts, fuel tanks, navigation lights, etc.  They also have standards for
 buoyancy and stability.  In the past, there have most often been problems
 with propeller shafts and fuel tanks, according to Japanese officials
 involved in the inspection process.   <STRONG>Boats</STRONG> with commonly used materials and
 engines seem to have the least problems.  But when the Japanese authorities
 see something new - a different construction material or a new design - they
 will not know how to cope with it, and it can be a big problem.
 
 <STRONG>Boats</STRONG> measuring less than 12 meters in length are inspected by an
 organization called the Japan Craft Inspection Organization, which is an
 official inspection organization authorized to inspect smaller <STRONG>boats</STRONG> on
 behalf of the government.  <STRONG>Boats</STRONG> over 12 meters are inspected by the same
 Ministry of Transport inspectors who inspect large freighters and tankers.
 This latter inspection system is termed the "JG" (for Japanese Government)
 inspection, whereas the former system is called "JCI" inspection.
 
 There is a procedure for having certain key parts of the inspection done in
 the manufacturer's plant in the United States.  "Letters of Compliance" can
 be issued which will shorten the JCI inspection in Japan.  These local
 inspections are handled by a Japanese organization called the Nihon Kaiji
 Kyokai, which has offices in several cities in the United States.
 
 In March, 1991 the Ministry of Transport published a 421-page book entitled
 "Handbook For Those Who Intend To Export <STRONG>Boats</STRONG> To Japan."  which outlines
 the relevant laws, regulations, rules and notices which relate to pleasure
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> import procedures and inspections in Japan.  This handbook is a very
 useful guide to any company presently exporting to Japan or interested in
 doing so in the future.  Much trouble can be averted by knowing in advance
 the standards which must be met in order to have <STRONG>boats</STRONG> registered in Japan.
 This book can be obtained from the JCI or the Ministry of Transport at the
 addresses shown later in this report, or from the Ship Machinery Department
 of the Japan External Trade Relations Organization (JETRO) New York office,
 located at 44th Floor, McGraw-Hill Building, 1221 Avenue of The Americas,
 New York, NY 10020-1060, telephone (212) 997-0400.
 
 Distribution and Business Practices
 
 As mentioned, most if not all American <STRONG>boats</STRONG> sold in Japan are handled by
 local Japanese agents.  These agents fall into a number of categories.
 
 1.  Specialized Importers.  Mostly small operations, these companies sell a
 limited range of specialized products to a fairly narrow group of
 experienced boaters.  Sometimes they succeed in developing a large number of
 dealers, but frequently they have only one or two tiny offices.  The
 distribution of sailboats is dominated by companies in this category.  They
 are often run by an experienced boater who has turned his hobby into a
 business.  They mostly sell to people who own a Yamaha sailboat and who wish
 to upgrade to something more sophisticated.  These agents rely on their
 detailed product and customer knowledge, and their personal connections with
 marinas and others in the industry to succeed.  Examples of companies in
 this category are Ocean First Marine, 135 Degrees East, and Fusion, Inc.
 There are perhaps 50-75 companies in this category.
 
 2.  <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> and Engine Manufacturers.  All of the large Japanese <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 manufacturers and many of the smaller ones also act as import agents for
 larger foreign <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  The same is true of the engine manufacturers such as
 Komatsu Diesel and Yanmar.  There are a number of benefits for these
 companies.  It allows them to take advantage of the growth in a market
 segment where they do not have any of their own production.  It allows them
 to utilize their existing sales channels for more products.  It helps their
 sales force become more knowledgeable.  Perhaps most important, it allows
 them to learn from the foreign companies whose products they are handling.
 
 For example, Yamaha handles Jeanneau sailboats, and this helps Yamaha in its
 own sailboat manufacturing.  By handling Pursuit fishing cruisers, Yamaha
 also picks up important experience in this segment.  From the standpoint of
 the foreign manufacturer, having a large Japanese manufacturer as an
 important agent means having an instant network of sales and service, but
 the foreign product is just one of many products handled and the sales staff
 is not likely to be very knowledgeable about the product.  Also, the foreign
 maker needs to consider whether the manufacturer will eventually begin to
 make similar products and no longer need the foreign products.  As
 mentioned, Yamaha also imports <STRONG>boats</STRONG> from Trojan, Formula, Tiara and
 Pursuit.  Nissan Marine imports Blackfin and Sport-craft fishing <STRONG>boats</STRONG> as
 well as J-<STRONG>Boat</STRONG> sailboats.  Other examples are listed in the section on
 domestic manufacturers earlier in this report.
 
 Komatsu Diesel, which manufacturers a number of models of a 36 foot fishing
 cruiser, is now importing <STRONG>boats</STRONG> from Shamrock (USA), Scand <STRONG>Boats</STRONG> (Norway),
 Mochi Craft (Italy), Southern Ocean Yachts (Australia) and Kineo (Austria).
 
 3.  Automobile Import Companies.  Two Japanese companies specializing in
 importing luxury foreign cars have become powers in <STRONG>boat</STRONG> importing: Yanase &
 Company, Ltd. and Seibu Motor Sales Co., Ltd.  Yanase has gained a solid
 reputation in Japan for not only importing foreign cars but for providing
 good service for them.  The company has a nationwide network of sales and
 service outlets and the company is following a similar strategy for handling
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> imports.  Yanase presently handles Wellcraft, Hatteras, Carver,
 Mirrocraft, and Stratos.  It is also the Japan representative for Johnson
 outboard engines and Cobra engines.
 
 Seibu Motor Sales handles Saab, Peugeot and Citroen automobiles and is
 making a major commitment in the marine area.  Part of the huge Seibu Saison
 Group which includes department stores, discount stores, hotels, and many
 other operations, the company now handles Sea Ray, Princess and Bertram
 yachts.  In addition, the company is sole agent in Japan for Volvo Penta
 marine engines, and it powers all of its Sea Rays and Princess <STRONG>boats</STRONG> with
 these engines.  The Seibu Group owns a number of marinas and is involved in
 developing others.  These marinas act as dealers for <STRONG>boats</STRONG> imported by
 Seibu, and the company also has dealers and service centers at other marinas
 around the country.
 
 4.  General Trading Companies.  Most of Japan's large trading companies have
 entered the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> import business.  Mitsui Bussan, which handles Feeling,
 Baltic, Dynamique and Jeantot sailboats and Ifni, Sonata, Gallart, Phoenix,
 Jeantot and Kavalk powerboats, appears to be the largest trading company in
 the business, but C. Itoh, Mitsubishi Corporation, Sumitomo Corporation, and
 most of the other well-known trading companies have entered this market.
 There are two views on these companies and their prospects.  In the early
 1970's, most of the trading companies rushed into the pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> industry
 when the market was hot, but a number of them pulled out when things slowed
 down after the oil crisis.  Critics point out that Japan's large trading
 companies are skilled at importing commodities but are not good at products
 which require specialized sales and product after-sales service.  On the
 other hand, it can be argued that the trading companies have the resources
 to stick with the business, have a need to diversify into new growth areas,
 and have the kind of connections which are essential for developing new
 marina facilities around Japan.
 
 5.  Other Miscellaneous Companies.  The rapid growth of the industry has
 attracted all sorts of new entrants, most of which believe that they have
 some existing strength which will allow them to grab a piece of the market.
 For example, Seiyo Continental Hotels, Ltd. have become the sole agent for
 Camper & Nicholsons, the U.K. maker of 100 foot plus luxury yachts.  The
 hotel company explains that it is aiiming to develop "an elegant,
 executive-class concept of marine leisure."  Tokyu Department Store has
 recently become agent for Sealine of the U.K. and Delta of the U.S.
 Matsushita Electric Industrial has tied up with Tobi Dekor, the Japanese
 sole agent for Sweden's Storebro Yachts, and is presently handling the
 import end of the business.  Toyota Motor Corporation has been conducting a
 detailed, year-long study of the marine industry to determine if it is
 attractive enough for it to become involved.  Large Japanese companies
 diversifying into the marine business could be attractive partners or agents
 for American <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturers which have not yet become involved in the
 Japanese market.
 
 In most cases, foreign-made <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are imported through sole agents,
 particularly in the case of European makers, but there are a number of
 important exceptions.  The Japanese importers naturally prefer an exclusive
 import agreement, arguing that the market is too small for multiple agents,
 that there will be too much price cutting, etc.  But some American companies
 such as Bayliner and Sea Ray, have several agents in Japan which market
 nationwide, and this seems to have increased the manufacturer's volume.  To
 some degree, the interests of the manufacturer and the importer are in
 conflict on this issue.  There is no simple answer for which arrangement is
 best, but it is important to know that sole agent agreements are not always
 the rule, and that just because a prospective agent demands such an
 arrangement, it is not always necessary to give in to such a demand.
 
 In view of the scarcity of marina space, the marinas in Japan have very
 powerful positions.  They are no longer merely parking spaces for <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, but
 they look for every opportunity to find additional sources of revenue.  One
 of the most important business activities in Japan for an importer is to
 enter into relationships with marinas.  Importers attempt to recruit marinas
 as dealers, but the number of marinas is small and the number of importers
 is large.  The large manufacturers such as Yamaha have entered the marina
 development business in order to increase dealers and to be able to locate
 service centers at certain marinas.  Many private marinas in Japan will
 provide space only to customers who have bought <STRONG>boats</STRONG> from them.       Other
 marinas will require rebates or commissions ranging from 10-20% to put
 another dealer's <STRONG>boat</STRONG> in their marinas.
 
 One problem which the industry faces in Japan is so-called "parallel
 importing" (in Japanese, heiko yunyu), whereby individuals or small trading
 companies acting on behalf of a customer, purchase <STRONG>boats</STRONG> directly from
 overseas dealers and import them into Japan outside the normal Japanese
 agent's channels.  In this way, they can avoid the dealer's mark up and save
 a considerable sum.  Since retail prices in Japan can be considerably higher
 than the U.S. retail price, the savings on a large <STRONG>boat</STRONG> can be
 considerable.  The owner will not be able to have his <STRONG>boat</STRONG> serviced by the
 authorized dealer in Japan, but the large savings have made this activity
 profitable for a few companies.  There is nothing that can be done about
 this practice in Japan, as it is not illegal, and dealers can only ignore
 it.  It is not a widespread practice and is likely to continue as long as
 there is a large gap between pricing in Japan and prices overseas.
 
 It is difficult to generalize about Japanese <STRONG>boat</STRONG> pricing.  Japanese agents
 and dealers explain that costs are higher in Japan and that Japanese
 customers require more after-sales service, so their prices have to be
 higher.  Markups of 50-80% are common, although much depends upon the dealer
 and the model.  Parallel imports and heavy competition from so many
 different products on the market are likely to continue to bring prices
 down.  There is also a large market for used <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, which also tends to keep
 prices of new <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in line.
 
 One Japanese agent for a well-known American powerboat runs an ad in
 Japanese boating magazines claiming that the prices he charges are the same
 as the American retail price plus freight, insurance and customs clearance
 charges, which add about 15% to the American retail price.

 TRADE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES
 
 Since the Japanese pleasure boating industry is still in its infancy, there
 are as yet few <STRONG>boat</STRONG> shows in Japan.  The most important is the Tokyo
 International <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Show, held every year at the Tokyo International Trade
 Center in Harumi in Feburary.  This show has been held every year since 1962
 and it attracts the main participants in the boating industry in Japan.  In
 1991 the show was lengthened to 6 days and paid attendance reached 155,000.
 A week later a smaller version of the show is held in Osaka for four days.
 Smaller <STRONG>boat</STRONG> shows are also held in Kita-Kyushu in late February, in Nagoya
 in March, and in Hiroshima in April.
 
 For information on these <STRONG>boat</STRONG> shows, contact the Japan Boating Industry
 Association at the address shown in the industry contact section of this
 report.

 Notes:
 
 1.  Data for 1987 and 1988 are DOC estimates.  In 1989, the U.S. adopted the
 new harmonized system (HS) of product category classifications, which in
 many cases were different from the categories used until 1988.  The 1987 and
 1988 figures are estimates of what the previous categories would be under
 the new system.
 
 2.  Beginning with 1990 data, a few categories were changed in accordance
 with an agreement between the U.S. and Canada to unify classification
 categories.  This resulted in minor changes in sailboat categories
 8903910025 and 8903910035, and the creation of two new sailboat categories,
 8903910065 and 8903910080.

 Notes:
 
 1.  Data for 1987 and 1988 are DOC estimates.  In 1989, the U.S. adopted the
 new harmonized system (HS) of product category classifications, which in
 many cases were different from the categories used until 1988.  The 1987 and
 1988 figures are estimates of what the previous categories would be under
 the new system.
 
 2.  Beginning with 1990 data, a few categories were changed in accordance
 with an agreement between the U.S. and Canada to unify classification
 categories.  This resulted in minor changes in sailboat categories
 8903910025 and 8903910035, and the creation of two new sailboat categories,
 8903910065 and 8903910080.

 Note: Data for 1987 and 1988 are DOC estimates.  In 1989, the U.S. adopted
 the new harmonized system (HS) of product category classifications, which in
 many cases were different from the categories used until 1988.  The 1987 and

 PLEASURE <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> MATCHMAKER
 
 1. INTRODUCTION: THE FOLLOWING ARE PARTIAL EMBASSY
 TRANSLATIONS OF TWO ARTICLES THAT APPEARED IN THE
 SEPTEMBER 27, 1991 RYUTSU SERVICE SHIMBUN (DISTRIBUTION
 SERVICE NEWSPAPER).  THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE RECENT
 MATCHMAKER MISSION FROM THE US, AND DISCUSSES U.S.
 ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE EXPORTS TO JAPAN IN THE PLEASURE
 <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> AND MARINE PRODUCTS AREA.  END
 INTRODUCTION.
 2. RYUTSU SERVICE SHIMBUN  (PAGE 15)  SEPTEMBER 27, 1991
 BEGIN TEXT: "POSITIVE OFFENSIVE BY US, TARGETING MARINE
 MARKET; ONE OF FEW FIELDS WHICH ARE IN BLACK; TO BE
 MADE BREAKTHROUGH FOR EXPANSION OF TRADE"
       TARGETING AT OUR COUNTRY'S MARINE MARKET, THE US
 MARINE INDUSTRY HAS LAUNCHED A POSITIVE APPROACH.  IT
 INTENDS TO SELL MARINE-RELATED COMMODITIES, CENTERING
 ON PLEASURE <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG>, IN AN AGGRESSIVE WAY, TO OUR
 COUNTRY, WHERE THE MARINE LEISURE MARKET IS EXPECTED TO
 GROW IN THE FUTURE.  THE BACKGROUND OF THE US SIDE'S
 DEVELOPING THE OFFENSIVE IS THAT (1) THE MARINE
 INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THE FEW FIELDS WHICH ARE IN BLACK IN
 THE US IN TRADE WITH JAPAN, AND THERE IS THE FOUNDATION
 OF THE SCOPE OF TRADE EXPANDING; AND THAT (2) DUE TO
 TROUBLE IN INCREASING DEMAND, THERE IS THE SPECULATION
 THAT IT WANTS TO FIND AN OUTLET ON OVERSEAS MARKETS;
 THEREFORE, IT IS TRYING TO STRONGLY STIMULATE OUR
 COUNTRY'S POTENTIAL MARINE DEMAND.  HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH
 THERE IS A MARINE BOOM IN JAPAN, THERE IS A REALITY
 WHICH PREVENTS THE MARKET FROM EXPANDING, SUCH AS A
 SHORTAGE OF MARINAS, ETC., AND SO, THERE IS A COOL VIEW
 APPEARING AS TO WHETHER MATTERS WILL DEVELOP AS THE US
 SPECULATES.
       RECENTLY, THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT CALLED "MATCHMAKER
 MISSION" AT THE US TRADE CENTER AT IKEBUKURO, TOKYO.
 THIS MISSION WAS A FORUM FOR SO-CALLED "MEETINGS WITH A
 VIEW TO MARRIAGE," AT WHICH US MARINE MANUFACTURERS
 WERE INTRODUCED TO OUR COUNTRY.  PROMOTORS WERE THE US
 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND THE US NATIONAL MARINE
 MANUFACTURING ASSOCIATION (NMMA).  TWELVE "PLEASURE
 <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG>-RELATED MANUFACTURERS, WHICH HAVE A FIXED
 REPUTATION FOR THEIR UNIQUE MEDIUM-RANKING
 COMMODITIES," WERE PICKED IN THE US, AND THEY CAME TO
 JAPAN.
       ENTERPRISES WHICH PARTICIPATED IN THESE BUSINESS
 TALKS ON OUR COUNTRY'S SIDE ARE THOSE WHICH ARE
 CHECKING INTO THE IMPORTS OF PLEASURE <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG>, THOSE
 WHICH WANT TO INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THEIR COMMODITIES,
 IN ADDITION TO HOME-MANUFACTURED COMMODITIES, OR THOSE
 WHICH ARE AIMING AT TAKING PART IN THE MARINE MARKET,
 SUCH AS AUTOMOBILE COMPANIES OR REAL ESTATE COMPANIES.
 THESE BUSINESS TALKS WERE THE FIRST ATTEMPT, AND SO,
 THE SPONSOR SIDE THOUGHT, "IT WILL PROBABLY BE ALRIGHT
 EVEN IF WE DO NOT RUN RIGHT UP AT A STROKE," BUT THEY
 WERE SO ENTHUSIASTIC THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL
 MANUFACTURERS WHICH EVEN MANAGED TO CONCLUDE
 NEGOTIATIONS.
       AS FOR THE FUTURE, A "PURCHASE AND INSPECTION
 TOUR TO THE AMERICAN MARINE INDUSTRY," INCLUDING A TOUR
 TO THE AMERICAN SAN DIEGO <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> SHOW, IS PLANNED FOR
 NOVEMBER UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE NMMA, FOR THE
 PURPOSE OF THE CONCLUSION OF NEGOTIATIONS.  ABOUT 30
 COMPANIES WILL BE COLLECTED FOR THIS TOUR, AND THE
 PURPORT OF THE TOUR IS TO SET UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR
 BUSINESS TALKS, WHILE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT COMMODITIES.
 END TEXT.  (US&FCS COMMENT: THIS IS A REFERENCE TO A
 FOREIGN BUYER MISSION THAT US&FCS/JAPAN IS PLANNING.)

 BEGIN TEXT: "MANY TASKS IN OUR COUNTRY'S PRESENT
 SSITUATION; CONSOLIDATION OF MARINAS DELAYED"
 PLEASURE <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> MATCHMAKER
       OUR COUNTRY'S MARINE MARKET IS RECEIVING A WARM
 GLOW FROM THE US MARINE INDUSTRY, BUT THERE ARE TASKS
 WHICH MUST BE CLEARED.
       ONE OF THEM IS THE CONSOLIDATION OF MARINAS WHERE
 PLEASURE <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> ANCHOR.
       AT PRESENT, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF MARINAS IN THE US
 IS 8,300.  IN CONTRAST TO THIS, THAT OF OUR COUNTRY IS
 370; FURTHERMORE, MOST OF THEM ARE SMALL-SCALE MARINAS
 WITH AN ANCHORING CAPACITY OF LESS THAN 50 <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG>.
 ALTHOUGH THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN AREA BETWEEN THE TWO
 COUNTRIES' NATIONAL LANDS, EVEN UNDER THE PRESENT
 SITUATION, (IN JAPAN,) THERE IS AN OVERFLOWING OF
 PLEASURE <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> WHICH CANNOT ANCHOR (IN A MARINA).  THE
 MOST DIFFICULT POINT IS EQUILIBRIUM WITH FISHING
 RIGHTS, AND ADMINISTRATION HAS BEGUN TO VIEW THIS
 PROBLEM SERIOUSLY.
       HOWEVER, JAPANESE PEOPLE'S SENSE OF LEISURE HAS
 BEGUN TO CHANGE, TOO.
       W. OFFUTT, WHO RUNS A CONSULTING COMPANY FOR
 BUSINESS BETWEEN JAPAN AND THE US, SAYS, "IT SEEMS THAT
 JAPANESE STILL HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF GUILT TOWARD
 ENJOYING THEMSELVES, BUT WITH THE AGE OF AROUND 35 AS
 DEMARCATION, YOUNG(ER) GENERATIONS DO NOT SPARE
 INVESTMENTS TO ENJOY THEMSELVES.  HE ALSO LISTED
 PLEASURE <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> AT THE TOP OF LEISURE GOODS WHICH WILL
 BECOME POPULAR IN THE FUTURE.  IT IS SAID THAT IN THE
 US, PEOPLE BUY A PLEASURE <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> WITH THE SAME SENSE AS
 WHEN PURCHASING AN AUTOMOBILE. END TEXT.

 OVERVIEW
 
 Growing per capita income and interest in leisure activities has increased
 the Korean demand for sporting equipment 10 to 15 percent over the past
 three to four years.  Sporting <STRONG>boats</STRONG> which include inflatables, canoes,
 yachts, motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, FRP <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, pedal <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and oar <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, among others, are
 a relatively undeveloped industry and considered as luxury items.  Although
 Korea is a peninsula with obvious potential for pleasure/sporting <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, the
 local seashores available for water sports are extremely restricted by
 military zones.  As for inland facilities, some 20 lakes and rivers are
 available.  The major sites for sporting <STRONG>boats</STRONG> include the Han River, which
 crosses in the middle of Seoul area, Chung Pyung Lake, Kyunggi-do which is
 one of the largest resort areas in Korea and the seashores adjacent to
 important port cities including Pusan, Incheon and Kang Reung.  The market
 for sporting <STRONG>boats</STRONG> has an estimated value of some USD 10 million and will
 increase 10 - 15 percent annually for the next three years.  The demand for
 outboard motors is estimated to increase some 20 percent per year due to the
 growing demand for sporting <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, official guard ships and commercial <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 such as rental <STRONG>boats</STRONG> for amusement parks and fishing.
 
 While Korea is one of the most important worldwide shipbuilding exporters,
 local manufacturing of sporting <STRONG>boats</STRONG> is relatively undeveloped and some 120
 related small firms produce inflatables and FRP <STRONG>boats</STRONG> on an order basis.
 Imports for sporting <STRONG>boats</STRONG> from the U.S.A. ranked first with USD 892
 thousand for 1991 and will increase some 15 percent for the next two-three
 years.  For outboard motors, the market is wholly supplied by imported
 goods, wiht U.S. and Japanese products leading in market acceptance.

 C. MARKET ASSESSMENT
 
 The facilities for sporting <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are located at some 20 lakes/rivers and
 seashores adjacent to important port cities including Pusan, Incheon and
 Kang Reung.  The major sites include Hangang Misari Park, Seoul; Tancheon,
 Kangwon-do; Sooyoung Yachting Center, Pusan; Yeochun Yachting Center,
 Chunnam; and Sachun Jinri Yachting Center, Kangwon-do.
 
 According to sporting <STRONG>boats</STRONG> associations, there are no professionals in
 Korea, but the number of amateurs for sporting <STRONG>boats</STRONG> including row <STRONG>boats</STRONG>,
 yachts and canoes is estimated at some 2,000.  The popularity of sporting
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, along with water skiing, continues to increase. However, this sport
 is still being introduced and has the image of an unfamiliar, special
 sport.  The following are official sporting <STRONG>boat</STRONG> events in Korea.

 D. BEST PROSPECTS
 
 HS Code:       Product Description:
 
 8903.10        Inflatables
 8903.92        Motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG> other than outboard
                motorboats
 8407.21        Outboard motors
 
 
 E. COMPETITVE SITUATION
 
 OUTBOARD MOTORS:
 Imports of outboard motors for 1991 were USD 4.2 million, 17 percent
 increase over 1990, and will grow some 20 percent on an annual basis for the
 next three-four years.  Foreign brands which are found in the local market
 include Evinrude, Johnson, Sea Drive, Mariner, Mercruiser, Yamaha, Suzuki,
 Dohatsu, Nissan, and Honda among others.  According to local business,
 Yamaha occupies some 50 percent of the total market share and Japanese
 products are considered to be competitive in price, service, promotional
 gifts and quality control.  Imports from Japan increased some 70 percent
 between 1990 - 1991.
 
 In this market, local products are hardly found. Korea Mighty Co., Ltd.
 (120-1, Pyungsan-ri, Woongsang-myun, Yangsan-kun, Kyungnam  Tel:
 82/2/556-1793  Fax; 82/2/556-2317) is the only outboard motor manufacturer
 and exporter.
 
 SPORTING <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG>:
 Although HS 8903 is classified as an item for promotion and development of
 local manufacturing by the government, domestic production decreased some 10
 percent and exports decreased some 35 percent between 1990 - 91.  According
 to the Korea Shipbuilding Industry Cooperative, there are some 120 small
 manufacturers of inflatables and FRP <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in this field, and about 40
 percent of manufactured goods are supplied to the local market.  For 1991,
 Korean manufacturers exported USD 4.4 million worth of inflatables, which
 accounted for 84 percent of the total export.  The production of motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 nearly stopped due to discouraging sales during the late seventies.  Large
 shipbuilders which are worldwide manufacturers for cruise, ferry, barge,
 cargo and specialty transportation ships recently attempted to produce
 sporting motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, however, this field remains unpromising for them.
 Important local manufacturers/exporters for inflatables and FRP <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 include Dongyang Co. (FRP mira <STRONG>boat</STRONG>), Korea Mighty Co. (PVC inflatable),
 Woosung I.B. Co. (inflatables with Xebec brand), Acimex Corp. (PVC
 infaltables), Victory <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> (FRP and inflatabls), and Hwashin FRP Co..
 
 For 1990, U.S. sporting <STRONG>boats</STRONG> represented some 60 percent of the total
 imports and 50 percent for 1991.  Imports from Japan, Germany, PRC, Canada ,
 U.K. and others share the remaining market.  Imports from Germany, U.K. and
 Hungary are mainly competition <STRONG>boats</STRONG> including yachts, canoes and row <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 Among U.S. <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, Sea Eagle, Sea Rail, Sea Hawk, Hovercraft Scat, and OMC's
 (Outboard Marine Corporation) products including Chris Craft, Donzi, Cobra,
 King Cobra, Seaswirl, Stratos and Sunbird are found in the local market.
 U.S. products are expected to enjoy an overwhelming market share for the
 time being due to quality and reputation.
 
 
 F. MARKET ACCESS
 
 Before importation, inflatables are subject to mandatory inspection by the
 Industrial Advancement Administration (IAA).  The import duty rate for
 outboard motors and sporting <STRONG>boats</STRONG> is 11 percent of CIF price for 1992 and
 is expected to decrease to 9 percent for 1993.  Local taxes are assessed as
 follows: 30 percent for the special excise tax; 30 percent for the
 educational tax; and 10 percent for value-added tax.  Thus, a total of 42.9
 percent in local taxes is imposed on these products.
 
 According to a local business in a related field, import commission earnings
 are about 15 percent and distribution margins are around 10 percent, which
 is not considered to be a high profit business.

 A.  OVERVIEW
 
 Although OEM marine supply sales are facing stiff head winds  in some
 international markets, the aftermarket for pleasure boating equipment and
 supplies in the Netherlands is continually expanding with every new <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 sold.  The economically less sensitive aftermarket is largely responsible
 for the 6 percent annual growth over the next three years which the Dutch
 pleasure boating equipment and supplies market is expected to enjoy.  This,
 together with the large rise in recent years in the number of pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 in the Netherlands and the rest of Europe, has created a major market for a
 wide array of marine products used by <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builders, as well as for those
 sold to the marine aftermarket.
 
 Dutch spending on pleasure boating equipment and supplies amounted to $168
 million in 1992.  (A minor share of these products were subsequently
 reexported after having been fitted on new <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.)  The Netherlands has
 numerous reputable <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builders of all sizes.  The West European market in
 this sector is about $1.6 billion, roughly ten times the size of the Dutch
 market.  The total outlay in 1992 on all forms of watersports in the
 Netherlands amounted to $1.2 billion.  (This not only includes equipment but
 also spending in new <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, mooring fees,, <STRONG>boat</STRONG> rentals, sports fishing,
 etc.).  Supplies for polyester <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, especially sail <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, are popular,
 but the majority of Dutch <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, especially motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, are of the
 displacement type, made of steel and diesel powered.  These family <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are
 typically used for inland water boating and average 26 feet to 36 feet in
 length.
 
 In the Netherlands there are some 410,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> presently in use, including
 110,000 sail <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, 300,000 motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and other types of vessels, and
 about 250,000 surf boards.  For a number of years now the dollar/guilder
 exchange rate has been favorable for U.S. exports and many American
 companies are entering the European market through the Netherlands.  Holland
 is often referred to as the "Gateway to Europe."
 
 A wide variety of recreational boating equipment and supplies are selling
 well, especially aftermarket products.  Marine electronics are in great
 demand.  There is interest in global positioning systems, system C marine
 communications, direct dialing communication systems, fluxgate compasses,
 electronic charting products, versatile screen displays and interfacing.
 Other types of less sophisticated basic <STRONG>boat</STRONG> parts, equipment, and supplies
 are also enjoying good sales.
 
 Waterways and lakes have largely shaped the Netherlands into what it is
 today.  Holland has many rivers, small lakes, canals, as well as North Sea
 coastal waters.  Twelve mph speed limits have been introduced in many of
 these inland areas to prevent shoreline erosion by excessive waves, as well
 as to increase the safety of slower forms of watersports.  Extensive
 commercial barge traffic found in many parts of the Dutch inland waterway
 system is given the right of way.
 
 The most important recreational marine equipment trade show in Europe, the
 Marine Equipment Trade Show (METS), is held annually in November at the RAI
 Exhibition Center in Amsterdam.  This event has grown remarkably to achieve
 the number one position over similar shows in Europe within the first three
 years of its 5 year existance.

 C.  MARKET ASSESSMENT
 
 Waterways and lakes, which have largely shaped the Netherlands into what it
 is today, have had an important impact on the economy, especially the
 seagoing and barge traffic, but the watersports area as well.  Attracting
 watersports tourism to the country creates a large source of revenue.  While
 the European leasure boating supplies market is likely to see a temporary
 leveling off of sales following a slowdown in the major European economies,
 Holland's boating supplies market still offers opportunities for U.S.
 boating equipment and supply firms looking to start or expand their export
 activities to the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe.
 
 While there are numerous reasons why the Dutch and the European pleasure
 boating equipment market offer opportunities for U.S. firms, four come
 immediately to mind:  1) the market is large; 2) transportation and
 communication systems in Europe are good which makes doing business in
 Europe relatively easy; 3) exchange rates are favorable; 4) in the long run
 a significant watersports industry will emerge in Eastern Europe, which will
 be supplied largely by Western European companies.
 
 The Dutch boating equipment and supplies market consists of both domestic
 and, because the Dutch are important <STRONG>boat</STRONG> exporters, indirect export
 outlets.  Products are fitted to <STRONG>boats</STRONG> which are sold in the Netherlands or
 exported.  These products also reach clients through the marine aftermarket.
 
 Similarly, Dutch importers sell to distributors elsewhere in Europe and to
 foreign <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builders.  According to ICOMIA (International Council of Marine
 Industries Associations), the 1992 Dutch market for marine equipment and
 supplies was $168 million, or about one tenth of all of West European
 boating equipment and supply sales which were estimated to be $1.6 billion
 for the same year.
 
 During the 1980's, there was a surge in the number of pleasure crafts sold
 in the Netherlands.  This trend has boosted the demand for quality
 maintenance services and the latest equipment and parts to increase comfort
 and safety on board in a climate which is often gray, damp, windy and cool.
 
 The importance to the Dutch economy of the watersports and sportsfishing
 industries is illustrated by the following table which shows 1992 Dutch
 spending in millions of dollars:
 
 Boating equipment and supplies           168
 Purchase of pleasure vessels             104
 Mooring costs                             76
 Miscellaneous watersports spending       370
 Watersports day trips by the Dutch        83
 Watersports day trips by foreigners       94
 Boating holidays by the Dutch             72
 Boating holidays by foreigners            49
 Watersports training                      10
 Spending on sportsfishing                174
 
 Total 1992 watersports spending       $1,2 billion
 
 It is estimated that there are 410,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in the Netherlands, including
 110,000 sail <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and 300,000 motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and other types of vessels.
 While steel <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are still prominent, there is a growing trend towards
 fiberglass <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 Since inland waterways are numerous but not large, the majority of all <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 are about 32 feet to 36 feet in length.  Roughly half of all Dutch <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are
 moored in about 1,000 marinas.  The rest are tied up along shorelines,
 although this custom is gradually being discontinued by local
 municipalities.  During the past five years some 250 new marinas have been
 built.  Marina occupancy is about 90 percent.  Expansion plans call for
 another 30,000 marina moorings by the year 2,010.  About half of all marinas
 are commercially operated, 35 percent are run by associations, and the
 remaining 15 percent by municipalities and other groups.  The average annual
 mooring fee for a 32 foot <STRONG>boat</STRONG> is about $1,000.
 
 The <STRONG>boat</STRONG> charter business is growing in importance.  Some 250 firms rent a
 total of about 3,000 motor and sailing vessels.  Many charter companies are
 small with no more than 5 to 25 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  Seventy percent of their business
 comes from Germany, 10 percent from other nationals, and 20 percent from the
 Dutch.  Total annual rental turnover is estimated at $20 million.
 
 
 D.  BEST SALES PROSPECTS
 
 Surveys conducted during the Amsterdam METS marine equipment trade shows
 have indicated a number of best sales prospects as shown below:
 
 <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> winter covers               Navigation equipment
 <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> cradles                     Inflatables, canoes,
 220 volt Power systems           Ropes, masts, sails
 Anti theft systems               <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> safety products
 Fiberglass repair kits           Mooring assists
 Restoration products             Marine electronics
 Anchors, propellers              Environmental products
 Computer systems                 Fittings and furniture
 Galley supplies                  Communication equipment
 Marina equipment
 
 The marine electronics best prospects penetrate every aspect of a modern
 vessel including the functions of controlling, measuring, guarding,
 communicating, navigating, timing, signalling, searching, warning and
 entertaining.
 
 Boaters are also interested in global positioning systems; system C marine
 communications; direct dialling automatic communication systems; fluxgate
 compasses; electronic charting; versatile screen displays and interfacing.
 
 Less sophisticated systems, equipment, and accessories also offer excellent
 opportunities.  These products include:  super light anchors and winches,
 new material clothing and sailcloth, hull plastics, synthetic fiber ropes,
 titanium fittings, and hundreds of products which focus on easy maintenance
 and comfort on board.
 
 
 E.  COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
 
 One of the reasons why the Dutch marine equipment trade show, METS, is so
 successful is because it is held in a country which does not have a strong
 indigenous marine equipment and supplies industry.  By comparison, the U.K.,
 France, Scandinavia and to a lesser degree Germany -- countries where the
 marine industry is prominent -- have or had marine equipment and supplies
 trade shows.  But because Dutch domestic production in this sector is not
 dominating, the European <STRONG>boat</STRONG> making and marine products industry is
 increasingly choosing to exhibit at and visit the Dutch METS trade show,
 making it the most important show of its kind in Europe.
 
 The import outlook for most marine products is good in the Netherlands.
 There has been a relatively strong surge in American interest in the Dutch
 and European market for both <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and boating equipment and supplies.  The
 overall U.S. share of the market, which used to be insignificant, has become
 stronger.  This trend has been fueled by the 1992 European unification
 process and is expected to continue for some time to come.  The absence of a
 strong Dutch marine parts and accessories industry, in combination with a
 healthy market and the renowned Dutch export mentality, makes the
 Netherlands an attractive country for American firms to establish a foothold
 in the European market.
 
 
 F.  MARKET ACCESS
 
 On January 1, 1993, the Single European Market came into being.  Most
 remaining internal trade barriers, whether technical or nontechnical, will
 be gradually eliminated.  This will also affect <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builders and later,
 manufacturers of marine equipment and supplies.  Efforts are being made to
 speed up the process of developing an EC directive on recreational craft for
 free trade of <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, equipment and supplies across national borders in
 Europe and around the world.  This will enable buyers to shop around in
 Europe and take advantage of cross-border shopping.  Many European firms are
 not experienced in dealing in such a large scale economy (the EC has a
 population of 325 million) which can be an advantage for American firms
 which are accustomed to a continent-size home market.
 
 EC legislation on product liability applies in all EC countries with safety
 and seaworthiness as the guiding principles.  Certification of products can
 be obtained in two ways: 1) On all end products, or 2) through company
 certification.  A number of companies are helping firms obtain this
 certification by advising them on how to set up their quality control
 systems.  With regard to standards, each country has had its own over the
 years.  ICOMIA is leading the search for a solution that would bring about
 unified worldwide standards.  The National Marine Manufacturers Association
 (NMMA) in the U.S. is an active participant in this process.
 
 When looking for foreign distributors, reputable Dutch importers warn
 against fly-by-night firms in the watersports industry.  American exporters
 are urged to seek security from new clients.  A 90-day or 120-day Letter of
 Credit is recommended as is a good shipping agent who can work out
 considerable savings on shipping costs.  It is also noteworthy that
 distributors tend to place their annual orders late in the season in January
 and February when the weather is often foul.  At a time when consumers are
 hardly thinking of watersports, the dealers are planning ahead.
 
 The number of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in use in Europe is shown in the following 1991
 breakdown.  When compared with U.S. statistics, the European market appears
 to offer great promise for increased <STRONG>boat</STRONG> and boating equipment sales.

 The Dutch government has taken or is proposing a number of measures which
 are likely to affect Dutch watersports.  For example, it has introduced a
 speed limit for pleasure vessels on many inland waterways of 12 mph to
 protect the shorelines from eroding and to provide greater safety to the
 slower forms of watersports.  Larger bodies of water and coastal waters will
 remain unaffected, and selected areas have been approved for fast boating
 and water skiing.
 
 Boaters will also be hard hit by proposed heavy boating taxes.  Looking for
 new sources of revenue, the Dutch government appears bent on enforcing <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 registration, which will be followed by the introduction of a new <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 owners tax which will mean, on average, a $300 levy for a 32 foot <STRONG>boat</STRONG>.
 
 In addition, the government has announced it will increase the price of
 recreational diesel fuel by 83 percent to $0.70 per liter next year.  These
 tax measures will hurt the less affluent and retirees the hardest, who form
 a large core of Dutch boaters, and may over time have a negative effect on
 boating equipment and supplies sales in an otherwise healthy industry.  In
 the meantime, thousands of boaters are joining forces with the watersports
 associations in protest against the proposed tax measures.
 
 As changes take place in the expanding European marine market, several large
 European marine products distributors have formed a new group, named MEDIA,
 to cooperate in the distribution of marine accessories.  The fact that
 Europe is one of the largest markets in the world, but hampered by language
 problems, prompted the participants to create a network of international
 distributors.  The Dutch partner in MEDIA, Boomsma B.V., is listed in this
 analysis under Key Importers.
 
 Shipping to individual importers in different countries has been the
 custom.  With the expanding European Market and demand to group larger
 shipments, the trend is now more toward dealing with multi-country
 distributors from central European warehousing.

 G.  TRADE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES
 
 The Marine Equipment Trade Show, METS, is THE leading, trade-only show of
 its kind in Europe.  It is held at the Amsterdam RAI Exhibition Center in
 the Netherlands.  METS '93 is scheduled for November 16-18, 1993.
 Inaugurated in 1988, the annual METS show will be held for the sixth time
 this year, during which time it has grown spectacularly to become the number
 one trade-only show in Europe for recreational marine equipment and
 supplies.  METS does not exhibit <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, but it does feature all conceivable
 types of recreational and small commercial <STRONG>boat</STRONG> parts, accessories, supplies
 and services from OEM to the aftermarket.
 
 METS '92 attracted large national pavilions from the U.S., the U.K.,
 Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy and France, Canada, Australia and Taiwan.
 France discontinued its own SIPEN show in favor of METS.  Starting in 1991,
 METS shows have been organized under the auspices of ICOMIA.  Formerly this
 privilege was reserved for the EMTEC show in Hamburg.
 
 At METS '92, covering 170,000 square feet, 540 companies from 19 countries
 presented the latest marine products.  72 Percent of the exhibitors were
 international.  The event attracted over 6,500 visitors, 23 percent of whom
 were foreign, from 45 countries.  Most came from the U.K., Scandinavia,
 Germany, Belgium, the U.S. and France.  Fifty-four percent of the visitors
 held an executive position.  Attendees consisted of shipbuilders (28
 percent), marine manufacturers (22 percent), dealers (14 percent), importers
 (13 percent), marine designers (5 percent), marine retailers (5 percent) and
 others (13 percent).  METS is also unique in that only uniform booths are
 obtainable, thereby presenting all exhibitors equally and substantially
 reducing booth construction costs.
 
 The American pavilion, organized by the National Marine Manufacturers
 Association (NMMA) which was 44 percent larger than the American pavilion at
 the previous METS show, housed 45 American companies, with 6 U.S. firms
 exhibiting individually.  After the show, an NMMA spokesman stated that
 "METS is good business for the NMMA and all of the exhibitors represented in
 the USA Pavilion.  The show provides a great concentration of industry
 buyers, both wholesale and retail.  METS has become the primary market place
 for recreational marine equipment for all of Europe."
 
 This year's 1993 METS is expanding into a new area to include marina
 equipment, materials, systems and services.  It promises to be bigger and to
 attract an even larger percentage of foreign visitors as the event continues
 to become increasingly international.  The US and Foreign Commercial Service
 (US&FCS) of the American Embassy in the Netherlands is proposing to
 cooperate with the NMMA at METS '93 to further serve the American exhibitors.
 
                     Other Marine Shows in The Netherlands
 
 HISWA (indoor): A consumer show which has been rescheduled to be held each
 year in December in the Amsterdam RAI Exhibition Center, featuring small
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, inflatables, clothing, aftermarket products accessories and
 increasingly, Dutch and international watersports tourism.
 
 NATTE HISWA (in-water): A consumer <STRONG>boat</STRONG> show, also organized by the RAI,
 held annually in September in an attractive Amsterdam dock area, which is
 gaining in importance as an international <STRONG>boat</STRONG> show.
 
                        The NMMA IMTEC Show in Chicago
 
 Once again US&FCS of the American Embassy in the Netherlands will organize a
 Dutch delegation to visit IMTEC in Chicago.  Between 50-75 Dutch visitors
 are expected to travel to IMTEC '93 in a group as well as individually.
 This opportunity for U.S. exhibitors to meet Dutch foreign buyers is
 initiated by the US&FCS in cooperation with the NMMA, the Dutch Kluwer
 publisher of Watersport Aktueel, a leading watersports magazine, the HISWA
 association and the Dutch RAI Exhibition Center, the organizer of the METS
 Trade show in Amsterdam.

 A.  OVERVIEW
 
 The Dutch and European pleasure boating equipment and supplies markets are
 enjoying a growth surge, with an estimated 8 percent annual growth rate over
 the next three years.  The large rise in recent years in the number of
 pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in The Netherlands and the rest of Europe has created a major
 market for a wide array of marine products used by <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builders, as well as
 those sold to the marine aftermarket.  The Netherlands has <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builders of
 all sizes.  There are some 410,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> presently in use, 110,000 sailing
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, 300,000 motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and other types, and about 250,000 surf boards.
 For a number of years now the dollar/guilder exchange rate has been
 favorable for U.S. exports and many American companies are entering the
 European market through The Netherlands.  Holland is often referred to as
 the "Gateway to Europe".
 
 In 1990, sales of pleasure boating equipment and supplies in The Netherlands
 amounted to $140 million.  Part of this was fitted on new <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and
 subsequently reexported.  The West European market in this segment is
 estimated at about $1.5 billion, ten times as large as the Dutch market.
 The most important marine equipment trade show in Europe, the Marine
 Equipment Trade Show (METS), is held annually in November in The
 Netherlands.  This event has grown remarkably to achieve its number one
 position in just three years.
 
 The Netherlands has many rivers, small lakes, canals and coastal waters.
 Twelve mph speed limits are about to be introduced in many of these areas to
 prevent shoreline erosion.  This will also be done so as not to obstruct
 commercial traffic and to protect the safety of various watersports.
 
 Total Dutch spending in 1990 on all aspects of watersports amounted to over
 $1 billion.  Polyester <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, especially sail <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, are popular, but the
 majority of Dutch <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are diesel powered, steel, displacement type,
 freshwater, family <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, averaging 26 feet to 36 feet in length.
 
 Many types of boating equipment and supplies are selling well.  Marine
 electronics are in great demand.  There is interest in global positioning
 systems, system C marine communications, direct dialing communication
 systems, fluxgate compasses, electronic charting, versatile screen displays
 and interfacing.  Other types of less sophisticated basic <STRONG>boat</STRONG> parts,
 equipment, and supplies are also enjoying good sales.

 C.  MARKET ASSESSMENT
 
 The chairman of the Dutch Watersports Industry Association, HISWA, recently
 stated that today's economic climate is ideal for U.S. boating equipment and
 supply firms to start or expand export activities to The Netherlands and
 elsewhere in Europe.  He described the process of getting to know exporting
 and monitoring markets as hard work but fun.
 
 There are four main reasons why the Dutch and the European pleasure boating
 equipment market may be opportune for U.S. firms: 1) it is large; 2)
 transportation and communication in Europe is good; 3) the exchange rates
 are favorable; 4) an enormous watersports industry is emerging in Eastern
 Europe, which can be supplied by West European companies.
 
 The Dutch boating equipment and supplies market consists of both domestic
 and, because the Dutch are important <STRONG>boat</STRONG> exporters, indirect export
 outlets.  Products are fitted to <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and sold in the Netherlands or
 exported.  They also reach clients through the marine aftermarket.
 Similarly, Dutch importers sell to distributors elsewhere in Europe and to
 foreign <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builders.  According to ICOMIA (International Council of Marine
 Industries Associations), the total Dutch market for marine equipment and
 supplies is $140 million, one tenth of all West European boating equipment
 and supply sales which are estimated at $1.5 billion.
 
 During the 1980's there was a surge in the number of pleasure crafts sold.
 This trend has boosted demand for the best types of maintenance, the latest
 equipment, the safest parts, and products for comfort on board in a climate
 which is often gray, damp and cool.  The importance to the Dutch economy of
 the watersports and sportsfishing industries is illustrated by the following
 table which shows 1990 Dutch spending in millions of dollars:
 
 Boating equipment and supplies           140
 Purchase of pleasure vessels              96
 Mooring costs                             70
 Miscellaneous watersports spending       336
 Watersports day trips by the Dutch        77
 Watersports day trips by foreigners       87
 Boating holidays by the Dutch             67
 Boating holidays by foreigners            45
 Watersports training                       2
 Spending on sportsfishing                161
 
 Total 1990 watersports spending       $1,081 million
 
 It is estimated that there are 410,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in The Netherlands, of which
 110,000 are sailing <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and 300,000 are motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and other types.
 Since inland waterways are numerous but not large, the majority of all <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 are about 32 feet in length.  Roughly half of all Dutch <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are moored in
 about 1,000 marinas.  The rest are tied up along shorelines.  During the
 past five years some 250 new marinas have been built.  Marina occupancy is
 about 85%.  Current expansion plans will add another 15,000 moorings.  About
 half of all marinas are professionally operated, the other half are club
 owned and run.  The average annual mooring fee for a 32 foot <STRONG>boat</STRONG> is about
 $500.  The <STRONG>boat</STRONG> charter business is growing in importance.  Some 250 firms
 rent about 3,000 motor and sailing vessels.  Seventy percent of its business
 comes from Germany, 10% from other nationals and 20% from the Dutch.  Total
 turnover is estimated at $20 million.
 
 D.  BEST SALES PROSPECTS
 
 An extensive interest and needs survey conducted during METS '90, the marine
 products trade show in The Netherlands, indicated the following best sales
 prospects:
 
 Clothing and supplies            Navigation equipment
 Engines                          Inflatables, canoes,
                                          rowing <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 Electrical equipment             Ropes, masts, sails
 Anchors, propellers              Maintenance products
 Computer systems                 Fittings and furniture
 
 It should be emphasized that this listing does not rule out many other
 products which will market well.  One of the most prominent areas is marine
 electronics, which penetrates every aspect of a modern vessel including
 controlling, measuring, guarding, communicating, navigating, timing,
 signalling, searching, warning and entertaining.
 
 Other areas of interest are global positioning systems; system C marine
 communications; direct dialling automatic communication systems; fluxgate
 compasses; electronic charting; versatile screen displays and interfacing.
 
 Less sophisticated systems, equipment, and accessories also offer excellent
 opportunities such as super light anchors and winches, new material clothing
 and sailcloth, hull plastics, synthetic fiber ropes, titanium fittings, and
 hundreds of products which focus on easy maintenance and comfort on board.
 
 E.  COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
 
 One of the factors why the Dutch marine equipment trade show, METS, is so
 successful is because it is held in a country where there is not a strong
 indigenous marine equipment and supplies industry.  By comparison, the U.K.,
 France, Scandinavia and to a lesser degree Germany, where this industry is
 strong, have or had marine equipment and supplies trade shows.  But because
 Dutch domestic production in this sector is not dominating, the European
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> making and marine products industry is increasingly choosing to exhibit
 at and visit the Dutch METS trade show, making it the most important show of
 its kind in Europe.
 
 Imports of most marine products are good.  There is a relatively strong
 surge in American interest in the Dutch and European market for both <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 and boating equipment and
 supplies.  The overall U.S. share of the market, which used to be
 insignificant, is becoming stronger.  This trend is being fueled by the
 approach of European unification in 1992 and is expected to continue for
 some time thereafter.  The absence of a strong Dutch marine parts and
 accessories industry in combination with a healthy market and the renowned
 Dutch export mentality, makes The Netherlands an attractive country for
 American firms to establish a foothold in the European market.
 
 F.  MARKET ACCESS
 
 1992 is of great importance to the European Community.  In that year the
 unified internal market should be virtually complete.  By the end of 1992
 there will be no further internal trade barriers of any description, whether
 technical or nontechnical.  This will also affect <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builders and later,
 manufacturers of marine equipment and supplies.  Efforts are being made to
 speed the process of developing an EC directive on recreational craft for
 free trade of <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, equipment and supplies across national borders in
 Europe and around the world.  Europe will be one single market with a
 population of 325 million.  Many European firms are not experienced in
 dealing in such a large scale economy.  This can be an advantage for
 American firms.
 
 Product liability: EC legislation affects all of Europe.  Safety and
 seaworthiness come foremost.  Certification: Can be obtained in two ways, 1)
 on all end products, or 2) through company certification.  Lloyds is helping
 firms obtain this certification by advising them on how to set up their
 quality control systems.  Standards: Each country has its own standards.
 ICOMIA is leading the search for a solution that would bring about unified
 worldwide standards.
 
 On the financial front, reputable Dutch importers warn against fly-by-night
 distributors in the watersports industry.  American exporters are urged to
 seek security from new clients.  A 90-day or 120-day Letter of Credit is
 recommended.  So is a good shipping agent who can work out considerable
 savings on shipping costs.  It is also noteworthy that distributors tend to
 place their annual orders late in the season in January and February, when
 the weather is often gloomy and consumers are not thinking of watersports.
 
 Following is a breakdown of the number of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in Europe.  When compared
 with the U.S. statistics shown below, the European market appears to offer
 great promise for increased <STRONG>boat</STRONG> and boating equipment sales.

 Several measures which are likely to affect the Dutch watersports industry
 have been reported in the press of late.  To protect shorelines from eroding
 and to safeguard the safety of watersports on the smaller inland waterways,
 the Dutch Government is planning to limit the speed of pleasure vessels in
 those areas to 12 mph.  Larger bodies of water and coastal waters will
 remain unaffected.  Furthermore, there is talk of instituting a registration
 system for all <STRONG>boat</STRONG> owners which, it is feared, will result in a <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 ownership tax being levied.  Such tax measures, if they become a fact, will
 hit the less affluent the hardest.
 
 Regarding changes in the expanding European marine market, several large
 European marine products distributors have formed a new group, named MEDIA,
 to cooperate in the distribution of marine accessories.  The fact that
 Europe is one of the largest markets in the world, but hampered by language
 problems, prompted the participants to create a network of international
 distributors.  The Dutch partner in MEDIA, Boomsma B.V., is listed below in
 the key importer contacts.  Shipping to individual importers in different
 countries has been customary.  With the expanding European Market and demand
 to group larger shipments, the trend is more toward dealing with
 multi-country distributors from central European warehousing.

 G.  TRADE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES
 
 METS '91 is the International Marine Equipment Trade Show which will be held
 November 12-14, 1991, at the RAI Exhibition Center in Amsterdam, The
 Netherlands.  Having been held only three times, since its inauguration in
 1988 the annual METS show has grown spectacularly to become already the
 number one trade marine equipment show in Europe.  METS '91 will attract
 large national pavilions from the U.S., the U.K., Denmark, Sweden, Italy and
 France.  The latter has discontinued its own SIPEN show in favor of METS.
 Starting this year, future METS shows will be organized under auspices of
 ICOMIA.  Formerly this privilege was reserved for the EMTEC show in Hamburg.
 
 At METS '90, covering 110,000 square feet, some 440 companies from 19
 countries presented the latest marine products.  The event attracted 5,210
 visitors, 23% of whom were foreign, from 34 countries.  Most came from the
 U.K., Scandinavia, Germany, Belgium, the U.S. and France.  Fifty-four
 percent of the visitors held an executive position.  Attendees consisted of
 shipbuilders (28%), marine manufacturers (22%), dealers (14%), importers
 (13%), marine designers (5%), marine retailers (5%) and others (13%).
 
 An American pavilion, organized by the National Marine Manufacturers
 Association (NMMA) with American Embassy support, housed 41 American
 companies, with 6 U.S. firms exhibiting individually.  After the show, an
 NMMA spokesman stated that "METS is good business for the NMMA and all of
 the exhibitors represented in the USA Pavilion.  The show provides a great
 concentration of industry buyers, both wholesale and retail.  METS is
 becoming the primary market place for marine equipment for all of Europe".
 
 This year METS promises to be bigger and to attract a much larger percentage
 of international visitors.  Every conceivable type of boating equipment
 supplies and marine services for both pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and the small
 commercial boating industry are exhibited for OEM's and for the marine
 aftermarket.  METS '91 will be held concurrently with Europort '91, the
 world's largest international maritime exhibition, also at the RAI in
 Amsterdam.
 
 Other marine shows in The Netherlands:
 
 HISWA (indoor): A consumer show held annually in March in Amsterdam
 featuring small <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, inflatables, clothing, accessories.  It is
 increasingly becoming tourism services oriented.
 
 NATTE HISWA (in-water): A consumer <STRONG>boat</STRONG> show held annually in September in
 Amsterdam, which is gaining in importance as a <STRONG>boat</STRONG> show.
 
 BOOT HOLLAND (indoor): A relatively new consumer oriented <STRONG>boat</STRONG> and
 accessories show held annually in Leeuwarden in February which is growing
 fast.
 
 IMTEC CHICAGO: For the second year running the American Embassy in The
 Netherlands will organize a Dutch delegation to visit IMTEC in Chicago.
 Between 50-75 Dutch firms are expected to travel to IMTEC '90.  This
 opportunity for U.S. exhibitors to meet Dutch foreign buyers is initiated by
 the American Embassy in cooperation with the NMMA (IMTEC) and the Dutch RAI,
 the organizer of METS in Amsterdam.

 OVERVIEW:
 
 This ISA includes in its definition of recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG> inboard powered
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and outboard motorboats.
 
 U.S. recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG> have a very good position in the Portuguese import
 market.  The United Kingdom is Portugal's number one supplier followed by
 the USA and immediately after is France.  Imports of smaller outboard
 motorboats have decreased in recent years while the 5 meter and larger
 inpowered powered <STRONG>boats</STRONG> have risen.  Locally manufactured <STRONG>boats</STRONG> also have a
 place in the market but their reputation is not the best.  The statistical
 data below includes both inboard powered <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and outboard motorboats.

 MARKET ASSESSMENT:
 
 Total Market Demand
 
 Portuguese total market demand for recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in 1989 was USD
 6.9 million.  This amount almost doubled the following year, in 1990,
 when Portugal imported USD 10.2 million and local production
 increased to USD 1.2 million.  Total market demand in 1990, then, was
 USD 11.4 million, 4.5 million more than in 1989.  In January 1991,
 Portugal had already imported USD 1.3 million for that month, of
 which 0.4 million came from the U.S. and 0.9 from France.  If this
 increase goes on until the end of the year, it suggests that total
 imports for 1991 should more than double those of 1990.  Most local
 production is exported either to Africa or Europe.  Portugal exported
 USD 0.9 million in 1988, 1.1 in 1989 and 2.2 in 1990.
 
 The U.S. share of recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in Portugal is high and has a
 very good reputation.  A special alert goes to manufacturers of
 inboard motorboats, not exceeding 7.5 meters, of which the U.S. is
 the leader in the Portuguese market.  Total imports for this
 subsector in 1990 were USD 0.40 million of which 0.18 million came
 from the U.S.
 
 The table below emphasizes the popularity of U.S. manufactured
 inboard motorboats, not exceeding 7,5 meters and weighing less than
 100 Kg, compared to other suppliers to the Portuguese market:

  37326 75 ...........    inboard outdrive <STRONG>boats</STRONG> (except houseboats)
 
 
 COMPETITIVE SITUATION:
 
 1.  Domestic Production
 
 The domestic <STRONG>boat</STRONG> industry is medium-sized and only directs 20 percent
 of its output to the local market.  The other 80 percent are exported
 mainly to Europe and Africa.
 
 Local sources reported that Portuguese manufactured <STRONG>boats</STRONG> only occupy
 20 percent of the domestic market due to poor manufacturing techniques
 compared to imported <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 
 2.  Imports
 
 Imports of inboard powered <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and outboard motorboats in 1990
 amounted to USD 10.2 million.  In January 1991, Portugal had already
 imported USD 1.2 million for that month of which 0.44 million came
 from the U.S.  Although U.S. imported <STRONG>boats</STRONG> pay 9% ad valorem compared
 to duty free when imported from the European Community countries, the
 Portuguese importers believe U.S. manufactured <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are more
 competitive, in price and quality.
 
 
 3.  U.S. Market Position Share
 
 In 1990 the United States was Portugal's second largest supplier and
 total imports added up to USD 1.8 million.  The U.K. was the leading
 supplier and exported a total of USD 3.8 million.  The U.S. faces
 competition from European manufacturers due to the tariff burden
 imposed on U.S. exports, but will always be among Portugal's main
 suppliers due to the high quality and durability of U.S. manufacturing
 techniques.
 
 
 MARKET ACCESS:
 
 1.  Import Climate
 
 There are no restrictions imposed on imports of recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 <STRONG>Boats</STRONG> pay a minimum of 9% ad valorem if imported from the U.S.  If
 imported from European Commnity countries they are duty free.  The
 import climate in this area is good and will increase along with
 Portugal's growing economy which generates consumer product demands.
 
 
 2.  Distribution and Business Practices
 
 Distribution of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> is done through importers, manufacturers and
 representatives.  Local practice in Portugal is that importers are
 also wholesalers and retailers.  U.S. <STRONG>boats</STRONG> have a good reputation
 among Portuguese importers and end-users, therefore they have a solid
 place in the Portuguese market.  However, U.S. companies should
 carefully select a reputable local agent/representative to provide
 after-sale maintenance services, to compete aggressively with EC
 suppliers.
 
 
 3.  Financing
 
 The GOP does not provide any financial support in the purchase of
 recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  Current practice is to pay in advance for all
 orders.  As the volume of orders increases, importers may open a
 letter of credit and pay within a period of 60 or 90 days from the
 date of order.

 SUMMARY
 
 This article is derived from a report titled: "The Sports amd Recreational
 <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Market in Spain, dated February 1993, prepared by J.R. Carbajosa,
 American Embassy - Madrid.  This article consists of 11 pages and contains
 the following subtopics:

 A.  OVERVIEW
 
 As a seafaring nation, shipbuilding in Spain has traditionally been a very
 important economic activity.  It enjoys some excellent naval engineering
 schools.  Spain has the third largest fishing fleet in the world and used to
 boast one of the largest merchant fleets.  There is a much less strong
 tradition of pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> ownership.  Up to a short while ago, people
 believed that only millionaires could enjoy marine sports such as sailing
 and boating.  At present, more Spaniards have the means to practice all
 sorts of water sports.
 
 This report considers that the sports and recreational <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market in Spain
 is made up of the following products: sports <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, yachts, sailing and
 motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, zodiac type vessels, canoes, row <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, and other recreational
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>; engines for vessels; and articles for the practice of water sports
 (water skis and surfboards of all kinds).
 
 Imports account for almost 66 percent of the total market.  The United
 States is the second largest foreign supplier after the European Community.
 The domestic market is small but competitive, as they are exporting quite
 well to the rest of Europe.
 
 Infrastructure investment is vital for this market.  There are only 80,000
 mooring spaces available for 125,000 registered vessels.  Construction of
 new marinas lags behind demand.  According to industry sources, the lack of
 new mooring space  is limiting <STRONG>boat</STRONG> sales by as much 25 percent.
 
 Spain has almost 5,000 kilometers of coast line, as well as a seafaring
 tradition plus a favorable climate in which to practice water sports.
 Improved standards of living augur well for an expanding sports and
 recreational <STRONG>boat</STRONG> market in coming years.

 U.S. sports and recreational vessels are considered as a good quality
 product at a very competitive price.  Nonetheless, U.S. manufacturers should
 consider local representation to distribute their vessels.  A large portion
 of U.S. vessels have been imported directly by the end-user after a trip
 made to the United States.

 C.  MARKET ASSESSMENT
 
 Demand for sports and recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG> is still rising despite the
 economic slowdown.  Annual growth estimates through 1996 are around 7
 percent; still lower than in recent years.  Spain has experienced a very
 fast growth rate in the last 30 years for this type of vessels.  In 1965,
 there were only 700 sports and recreational vessels registered in Spain.
 Ten years later, the number of units had increased by 2000 percent to 45,000
 vessels.  The latest figures available (1991) indicate Spain had 125,000
 registered pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 Spain enjoys 4,964 kilometers of coastline and fair weather to practice
 sailing all year round.  At present there are 313 marinas with a total
 capacity for 80,000 moorings.  The Mediterranean shoreline and the Balearic
 Islands have 53 percent of these marinas, which enjoy 84 percent of Spain's
 total mooring capacity.
 
 There are two types of marinas clearly differentiated in Spain.  Those
 streamlined or designed for tourism purposes and those serving the local
 population.  Marinas in the Balearic Islands and in the southern part of
 Spain target the tourist industry.  Their mooring capacity is full during
 the vacation season, and there is a 7:3 ratio between foreign vessels and
 domestic ones.
 
 Marinas in Catalonia and Valencia on the Mediterranean, as well as those
 established in the northern Atlantic coastline, are mainly serving clients.
 They are usually located close to large urban areas.  The vessels moored in
 these marinas range from 8 to 10 meters in length; with a few units ranging
 from 10 to 12 meters in length.  Most of the powered vessels in Spain range
 from 6 to 8 meters in length.
 
 The market needs more mooring capacity.  Infrastructure investment is
 vital.  There are only 80,000 mooring spaces available to accommodate
 125,000 registered vessels.  Construction of new marinas lags well behind
 demand.  According to industry sources, the lack of new mooring space is
 reducing <STRONG>boat</STRONG> sales by up to 25 percent every year.
 
 This market is also burdened by the high taxes which affect every vessel
 whose length exceeds 7.5 meters.  Beyond this length, ships pay an
 additional registration/luxury tax that amounts to 13 percent of the
 vessel's value.  Normal V.A.T. is 15 percent for all products and services
 marketed in Spain and must be paid by the end-user directly.  The
 registration/luxury tax can be paid by the middleman, but the tax will be
 reflected in a higher price to the end-user.
 
 The current economic slowdown is affecting this market in the same manner as
 in other sectors.  Consumers are more wary about spending their money on
 non-essential goods.  Nonetheless, end-users in this market are in high
 income brackets, and they are usually less affected by economic recessions.
 
 End User profile
 
 Spain's demographics have changed significantly over the last 30 years; its
 "baby boom" generation is only now entering its high earning and high
 consumption years.  Moreover, Spaniards have further to go in catching up to
 the living standards of its EC neighbors.  While per capita income (in U.S.
 current dollar terms) has risen sixty percent over the last five years,
 local living standards are still only three-quarters of the European
 average.  Spain's relatively large market, including almost 40 million
 residents and over 50 million visitors per year makes this market very
 attractive.
 
 People interested in a sport and recreational <STRONG>boat</STRONG> must have the appropriate
 license.  In 1991, there were 20,000 new licenses given, with 17,835
 renewals.  In the first three quarters of 1992, there were 11,669 new
 permits issued.  In order to get a license, one must attend intensive
 training and pass a strict exam.  This is another factor that limits sales.
 
 Highest demand for these kind of vessels is found in Catalonia, Valencia,
 the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean, and in Cantabria and the Basque
 Country along the northern Atlantic coast line.  Madrid is becoming an
 interesting market as many of its residents buy small <STRONG>boats</STRONG> to use in some
 of the reservoirs that surround the capital.
 
 
 D.  BEST SALES PROSPECTS
 
 - Sports and pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG>: motorboats and sail <STRONG>boats</STRONG> with ship length
   below 7.5 meters  (HC8903)
 
 - Spark ignition reciprocating or rotary internal combustion piston engines
   (HC84072)
 
 
 E.  COMPETITIVE SITUATION
 
 1.  Domestic Production
 
 Domestic production of sports and recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG> is quite important in
 Spain.  Yet, it has not been able to satisfy total demand.  Stiff import
 competition has aroused this subsector from its sleepy posture in the late
 1970's.  New manufacturing companies have sprung up and are beginning to
 compete fiercely with foreign suppliers.  Spanish manufacturers have the
 know-how to manufacture top-level products.
 
 Over the last two years, domestic production has grown while imports have
 actually decreased.  Also, Spanish manufacturers have increased their
 exports by as much as 10 percent at a time when the local currency was at
 its strongest level.  This trend is forecast to continue due to the Fall
 1992 peseta devaluations of about ten percent, which have automatically made
 Spanish products relatively cheaper and imported goods more expensive.
 Domestic sports and recreational <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturing is strongest in yachts
 and motorboats with ship length between 7 and 9 meters.  The manufacture of
 engines (compression piston engines) is the second most important good
 manufactured domestically in this subsector.
 
 Despite the fact that domestic manufacturing has grown considerably, the
 subsector is concerned about the high interest rates that exist in Spain,
 which makes financing new ventures very expensive.  This market requires
 continued technological innovation in order to keep up with competition.
 
 
 2. Imports
 
 Imports make up over 65 percent of the total market.  The main suppliers to
 this market are the European Community member countries with over 51 percent
 import market share.  Products for the domestic sports and recreational
 vessels market coming from the United States make up 30 percent of total
 imports, while Japanese goods follow at a distance with just over 8 percent.
 
 By major product line, the EC totally dominates the domestic market for
 yachts and small <STRONG>boats</STRONG> that fall under the Harmonized Code 8903 with 54.28
 percent import market share.  Spaniards also buy most of the engines that
 fall under heading 8408 from the EC, mainly Germany, amounting to 55.15
 percent of imports.  Japanese engines under heading HC 8407 make up almost
 40 percent of imports followed by those from the EC, mainly Belgium, with
 32.7 percent.  Most of the marine complements and accessories that are in
 heading HC 9506 come from the EC as well, 61.6 percent of imports.
 
 
 3. U.S. Market Position and Share
 
 U.S. products account for 30 percent of total imports.  Over the last three
 years there has been a large increase in the demand for U.S. pleasure
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  A strong local currency, and a competitive price/quality ratio on
 behalf of U.S. products have allowed American pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> to almost
 dominate this segment of the market.  Sport and pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> imports from
 the United States make up 38.24 percent of total imports of heading HC 8903.
 
 There is also an important presence of U.S. engines.  Over 24 percent of
 total spark ignition or rotary internal engines imported into Spain came
 from the United States.  With regards to compression ignition engines, close
 to 17 percent of imports were manufactured in America.  As to other articles
 and complements, U.S. products made up 10.3 percent of imports.
 
 Many of the U.S. manufactured sports and pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> have been privately
 imported by the end-user after a tourist visit to Florida.  A strong peseta
 versus the U.S. dollar made it possible to import <STRONG>boats</STRONG> at a less expensive
 cost than acquiring it locally.  Most of the time, <STRONG>boats</STRONG> were purchased from
 a U.S. distributor, instead of directly from the manufacturer.  Until last
 year, certification requirements were not enforced, so the only hurdle was
 to pay the corresponding customs duty and transport the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> to Spain.  Even
 today, there are advertisements in trade publications about how to buy a
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> in the United States.
 
 There is demand for good quality U.S. products at competitive prices, but
 U.S. products in general lack solid distribution channels in Spain.  There
 is little U.S. manufacturer presence in Spain.  Manufacturers have to
 establish solid presence in Spain, either through representation or through
 joint-ventures with local manufacturing companies.  Many domestic companies
 would welcome an American firm as a partner targeting the EC Single Market
 and bringing in technological know-how.
 
 
 4.  Competitive factors
 
 Price is by far the most important factor.  With similar navigational
 capabilities, price is the determining factor in this market.  This is
 especially true for sail <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and other recreational vessels.  With regard
 to engines, apart from price, after-sale maintenance service is very
 important.  Quick repair service and available parts are necessary to
 compete successfully.
 
 A good distribution network is becoming more and more an essential
 competitive factor.  Manufacturers from the EC have been investing a lot of
 money on improving their distribution network in this market.
 
 
 F.  MARKET ACCESS
 
 1.  Import climate
 
 There are both custom tariffs and product approval certification impediments
 that limit the free marketing of sports and recreational vessels in Spain.
 Also, they are heavily taxed by the Administration.  End-users have to pay a
 general value added tax amounting to 15 percent, and for larger <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, over
 7.5 meter length, there is an extra 13 percent registration/luxury tax.
 Industry sources complain that these impediments are affecting the sector's
 growth very seriously.
 
 Under the Single Market regulations, custom tariffs for the products covered
 in this study are the same for all the EC.  This means that <STRONG>boats</STRONG> coming
 from other member countries are not levied any tariffs, and only <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 manufactured outside of the EC have to pay these common customs tariffs.
 
 Customs tariffs are as follows:
 
 HC84072
   Spark ignition reciprocating or rotary internal combustion piston engines:
   between 6.9% and 10%
 
 HC84081
   Compression ignition internal combustion piston engines (diesel or
   semi-diesel engines): either 0% or 5.3 %
 
 HC8903
   Yachts and other vessels for pleasure or sports; row <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and canoes:
   either 2.5% or 3.8%
 
 HC95062
   Water skis, surf boards, sailboards and other water sport equipment: 6
   percent.
 
 
 2.  Certification Requirements
 
 Pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in Spain, whether manufactured locally or imported must meet
 strict certification requirements.  These requirements are called locally
 "homologation".  Pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> must present extensive documentation to the
 Inspection Department of the Merchant Navy General Directorate in order to
 be "homologated".  Once all the necessary documents have been reviewed by
 this department, and the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> has passed a navigation test supervised by the
 inspectors, the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> can be marketed in Spain.  The process takes at least
 one month.
 
 The following do not need certification or "homologation" requirements to be
 sold in Spain:
 
 - Row <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, canoes, kayaks or similar (including surfboards)
 - Water motorbikes
 - Motored and sailing ships with an LBD factor below 2
 - Pneumatic motor <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, length less than 2.7 meters
 - Pneumatic sailing <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, length less than 3.7 meters
 
 The legislation that implements these requirements is spread among several
 laws and regulations.  This has made enforcement of certification
 requirements difficult.  Many <STRONG>boats</STRONG> imported in the past got away with
 minimum requirements. The General Directorate of the Merchant Navy published
 a Ministry Notice in March 1992 (Circular No. 3/92) pointing all the steps
 necessary to certify pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in Spain.  Strict implementation began
 in June of last year.
 
 The US&FCS in Spain managed to work with local authorities to obtain
 recognition for U.S. manufactured pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> that hold certification
 from the National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA).  This applies to
 pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> with total length below 15 meters.  The Inspection Department
 of the General Directorate of the Merchant Navy accepts the NMMA documents
 to substitute those required by the 3/92 regulations for this kind of
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  Nonetheless, there must be a unit present in Spain for the
 navigation tests.
 
 
 3.  Distribution/business practices
 
 Distribution patterns in this subsector change depending on the products
 marketed.  Recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG> as such, that is sailing <STRONG>boats</STRONG> from Optimist
 class onwards, cruising sailing <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, yachts, motorboats and pneumatic
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> (zodiac type) are distributed mainly through distributors and
 represent 75 percent of units sold annually.  The remaining percentage of
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> sold annually are marketed directly from domestic manufacturer to
 end-user (20 percent) and from foreign manufacturer to consumer (5 percent
 of units).  The majority of <STRONG>boat</STRONG> distributors, 80 percent of units sold
 every year, buy from manufacturers and re-sell to final user.  Remaining 20
 percent of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are left on consignment by the manufacturer for the
 distributor to sell.
 
 The 20 percent of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> sold by domestic manufacturers to end-users are
 usually small regatta sailing <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, 420, 470, Europa, etc., and for large
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> over 15 meters of length.  These large <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are built directly by
 shipyards, and the end-user typically makes the order himself.
 
 The other products reported in this study are not sold directly to
 end-users.  The distribution chain is respected.  Usually these products are
 sold by distributors to specialty retail stores.
 
 
 4.  Financing
 
 The general rule in this market is the 90 day payment turnover.  Regarding
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, the common practice is that payments are delayed if the distributor
 has not sold the <STRONG>boat</STRONG>.
 
 Distributors have their own financing or have special agreements with banks
 to finance <STRONG>boats</STRONG> over US$10,000.  In theory <STRONG>boats</STRONG> can be mortgaged like a
 house, but in practice no bank accepts this risk any more.
 
 Large recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, on the contrary, are financed by the end-user.
 The customer contracting with a shipyard to build its <STRONG>boat</STRONG> must make payment
 advances.  (This refers to <STRONG>boats</STRONG> that cost over US$1 million.)
 
 5.  Key contacts
 
 A full list of government and private contacts in the recreational <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 market can be found in Appendix 1.  This list contains the addresses of the
 Government agency in charge of certification requirements, of useful trade
 associations that can provide information about this market, major
 importers, and related specialized publications.
 
 
 G.  TRADE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES
 
 There is a large trade fair on recreational <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and complementary products
 held annually in the last week of November in Barcelona.  This is organized
 by the city's trade fair Authority and by the domestic Association of
 Maritime Industries (ADIN).

 SUBJECT: RECREATIONAL <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> MARKET IN SPAIN:
 INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT.
 
 SUMMARY: IMPROVED STANDARDS OF LIVING AND A
 SEAFARING TRADITION HAVE MADE SPANIARDS DEMAND
 RECREATIONAL <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG>.  THE RECREATIONAL <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> MARKET IS
 WELL ABOVE US$ 230 MILLION AND IT IS FORECASTED THAT
 IT WILL GROW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 7 PERCENT THROUGH
 1996.  A SLOWDOWN IN MARINA CONSTRUCTION IS
 AFFECTING QUITE HEAVILY SALES IN THIS MARKET.  U.S.
 MANUFACTURED SPORTS AND PLEASURE <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> ARE HIGHLY
 REGARDED AND MAKE UP 30 PERCENT OF TOTAL IMPORTS.
 YET, U.S. MANUFACTURERS HAVE TO INVEST MORE IN THE
 DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR PRODUCTS IN SPAIN IF THEY WANT
 TO GAIN LARGER MARKET SHARE.  END SUMMARY.
 2. AS A SEAFARING NATION, SHIP BUILDING IN SPAIN HAS
 TRADITIONALLY BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT ECONOMIC
 ACTIVITY.  IT ENJOYS SOME EXCELLENT NAVAL
 ENGINEERING SCHOOLS.  SPAIN HAS THE THIRD LARGEST
 FISHING FLEET IN THE WORLD AND USED TO BOAST ONE OF
 THE LARGEST MERCHANT FLEETS.  BUT THERE IS A MUCH
 LESS STRONG TRADITION OF PLEASURE <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> OWNERSHIP.
 UP TO A SHORT WHILE AGO, PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT ONLY
 MILLIONAIRES COULD ENJOY MARINE SPORTS SUCH AS
 SAILING AND BOATING.  AT PRESENT, MORE SPANIARDS
 HAVE THE MEANS TO PRACTICE ALL SORTS OF WATER SPORTS.
 3. THIS REPORT CONSIDERS THAT THE SPORTS AND
 RECREATIONAL <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> MARKET IN SPAIN IS MADE UP OF THE
 FOLLOWING PRODUCTS: SPORTS AND RECREATIONAL <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> AS
 SUCH (MADE UP OF YACHTS, SAILING AND MOTOR <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG>,
 ZODIAC TYPE VESSELS, CANOES, ROW <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG>, ETC.);
 ENGINES FOR VESSELS; AND ARTICLES FOR THE PRACTICE
 OF WATER SPORTS (WATER SKIS AND SURFBOARDS OF ALL
 KINDS).
 4. SPAIN HAS ALMOST 5,000 KILOMETERS OF COAST LINE,
 AND BOTH A SEAFARING TRADITION PLUS A FAVORABLE
 CLIMATE IN WHICH TO PRACTICE WATER SPORTS.  IMPROVED
 STANDARDS OF LIVING AUGUR WELL FOR AN EXPANDING
 SPORTS AND RECREATIONAL <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> MARKET IN COMING YEARS.
 5. INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IS VITAL FOR THIS
 MARKET.  THERE ARE ONLY 80,000 MOORING SPACES
 AVAILABLE FOR 125,000 REGISTERED VESSELS.
 CONSTRUCTION OF NEW MARINAS LAGS BEHIND DEMAND.
 ACCORDING TO INDUSTRY SOURCES, THE LACK OF NEW
 MOORING SPACE IS LIMITING <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> SALES BY AS MUCH 25
 PERCENT.
 6. THE RECREATIONAL <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> MARKET IN SPAIN WAS
 ESTIMATED TO BE OVER US$ 231 MILLION IN 1992.
 GROWTH FORECASTS THROUGH 1996 ARE AROUND 7 PERCENT
 EVERY YEAR.  IMPORTS ACCOUNT FOR ALMOST 66 PERCENT
 OF THE TOTAL MARKET.  THE UNITED STATES IS THE
 SECOND LARGEST FOREIGN SUPPLIER AFTER THE EUROPEAN
 COMMUNITY.  THE DOMESTIC MARKET IS SMALL BUT
 COMPETITIVE, AS THEY ARE EXPORTING QUITE WELL TO THE
 REST OF EUROPE.
 7. U.S. PRODUCTS ACCOUNT FOR 30 PERCENT OF TOTAL
 IMPORTS.  OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A
 LARGE INCREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR U.S. PLEASURE
 <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG>.  A STRONG LOCAL CURRENCY, AND A COMPETITIVE
 PRICE/QUALITY RATIO ON BEHALF OF U.S. PRODUCTS HAVE
 ALLOWED AMERICAN PLEASURE <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> TO ALMOST DOMINATE
 THIS SEGMENT OF THE MARKET.  SPORT AND PLEASURE <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG>
 IMPORTS FROM THE UNITED STATES MAKE UP 38.24 PERCENT
 OF TOTAL IMPORTS.
 8. THERE IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT PRESENCE OF U.S.
 ENGINES.  OVER 24 PERCENT OF TOTAL SPARK IGNITION OR
 ROTARY INTERNAL ENGINES IMPQRTED INTO SPAIN CAME
 FROM THE UNITED STATES.  WITH REGARDS TO COMPRESSION
 IGNITION ENGINEQ, CLOSE TO 17 PERCENT OF IMPORTS
 WERE MANUFACTURED IN AMERICA.  AS TO OTHER ARTICLES
 AND COMPLEMENTS, U.S. PRODUCTS MADE UP 10.3 PERCENT
 OF IMPORTS.
 9. MANY OF THE U.S. MANUFACTURED SPORTS AND PLEASURE
 <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> HAVE BEEN PRIVATELY IMPORTED BY THE END-USER
 AFTER A TOURIST VISIT TO FLORIDA.  A STRONG PESETA
 VERSUS THE U.S. DOLLAR MADE IT POSSIBLE TO IMPORT
 <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> AT A LESS EXPENSIVE COST THAN ACQUIRING IT
 LOCALLY.  MOST OF THE TIMES, <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> WERE PURCHASED
 FROM A U.S. DISTRIBUTOR, INSTEAD OF DIRECTLY FROM
 THE MANUFACTURER.  UNTIL LAST YEAR, CERTIFICATION
 REQUIREMENTS WERE NOT ENFORCED, SO THE ONLY HURDLE
 WAS TO PAY THE CORRESPONDING CUSTOMS DUTY AND
 TRANSPORT THE <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> TO SPAIN.  EVEN TODAY, THERE ARE
 ADVERTISEMENTS IN TRADE PUBLICATIONS THAT ADVERTISE
 HOW TO BUY A <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> IN THE UNITED STATES.
 10. THERE IS DEMAND FOR GOOD QUALITY U.S. PRODUCTS
 AT COMPETITIVE PRICES.  BUT U.S. PRODUCTS IN GENERAL
 LACK SOLID DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IN SPAIN.  THERE IS
 LITTLE U.S. MANUFACTURER PRESENCE IN SPAIN.
 MANUFACTURERS HAVE TO ESTABLISH A MORE SOLID
 PRESENCE IN SPAIN, EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH
 JOINT-VENTURES WITH LOCAL MANUFACTURING COMPANIES.
 MANY DOMESTIC COMPANIES WOULD WELCOME AN AMERICAN
 FIRM AS A PARTNER TARGETING THE EC SINGLE MARKET AND
 BRINGING IN TECHNOLOGICAL KNOW-HOW.

 SWEDEN - PLEASURE <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> - ISA9203
 
 SUMMARY:
 
 This article is derived from a report titled:  "The Pleasure <STRONG>Boats</STRONG> Market in
 Sweden", dated March 1992, prepared by N. Hoegstrom, American Embassy -
 Stockholm.  This article consists of 6 pages and contains the following
 subtopics:

 A.  OVERVIEW
 
 Since mid-1989, when the market was strongest, prices for pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 have fallen drastically.  Customers in these times of recession are leery of
 investing in a new <STRONG>boat</STRONG>.  Imports have declined significantly, virtually
 halved from 1990 to 1991.  The domestic boating industry has weathered the
 recent recession fairly well but is today living on foreign markets.
 Domestic demand will remain low this year.  Exports should be stagnant or up
 slightly as the <STRONG>boat</STRONG>/builders continue to develop the foreign markets.
 
 B.  STATISTICAL DATA

 Statistical data for 1991 are available only up to September 1991 but we
 feel that it is possible to make an accurate estimate for all of 1991.
 Marine accessories are not included in the data.
 
 C.  MARKET ASSESSMENT
 
 There are more than 1.3 million leisure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in this country of eight
 million people.  It is estimated that 25 percent of the population are
 active boating enthusiasts.  The conditions for boating are also excellent.
 Sweden has a long coastline and many inland lakes.  A negative factor is
 that the boating season is very short.
 
 There are some 200,000 live-aboard cabin <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and sailing <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and about
 175,000 daycruisers.  In addition, there are 500,000 open <STRONG>boats</STRONG> with engine
 under 10 hp and also 275,000 open <STRONG>boats</STRONG> without engine.  The number of
 canoes and sail boards is estimated at 150,000.
 
 Apparent consumption declined by 40 percent between 1990 and 1991.  The
 decline in demand for pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> has been caused mainly by the general
 economic downturn but also by new tax rules which have limited deductions
 for interest on purchases.  The downturn has fallen on imported <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 whereas the domestic <STRONG>boat</STRONG> manufacturing industry has gotten off lightly
 thanks to successes on foreign markets.
 
 The total market amounted to Skr 1200 ($203) million in 1990.  Production
 value of <STRONG>boats</STRONG> was Skr 1100 ($186) million and exports amounted to Skr 560
 ($95) million.  Imports of pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> had fallen in 1990 to Skr 660
 ($112) from Skr 780 ($130) the year before.
 
 During the year 1990, a total of 22,000 pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> were sold in Sweden.
 Of these, only 1000 were sail <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  Some 17,000 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> were sold in 1991,
 of which 700 sail <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  Unfortunately, the brunt of the decline has been
 borne by American <STRONG>boat</STRONG> suppliers.
 
 More than 50 percent of the pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> built in Sweden were exported in
 1990.  The largest foreign markets for Swedish <STRONG>boats</STRONG> were Germany, Japan,
 United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the neighboring Nordic countries.
 
 The general trend this year appears to be towards smaller, less luxurious
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, type "cabin model".  Sailing <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are also of more manageable sizes,
 often 24-foot.  There is also an increased interest in "vintage" <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 Sales of marine accessories and engines have been less affected by the
 downturn in the economy.  There has been a rapid growth of the market for
 navigational instruments and safety products.
 
 In the past few years, safety has become an important issue in the boating
 industry.  There is no mandatory testing but the National Swedish
 Administration of Shipping and Navigation has introduced voluntary type
 approval of pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 Close to 300,000 owners of larger <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are subject to a modest tax (Skr 30
 per year or $5), which is collected in order to pay for a registration.  The
 Swedish Government ruminates upon the consequences of scrapping the
 register, but the Swedish Police would like to keep it.  Obviously it
 facilitates search for stolen <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 The Swedish <STRONG>boat</STRONG> industry employs some 6,000 people including manufacturers,
 dealers and service personnel.
 
 D.  BEST SALES PROSPECTS
 
 Although the trend is towards smaller <STRONG>boats</STRONG>, there is still a market for the
 traditional types supplied by American <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builders.  Demand is expected to
 increase for canoes and surf boards.  Although the dollar has moved up
 modestly in recent months, the consistently low value has created export
 opportunities for U.S. suppliers.  A segment of the industry that did see
 positive growth was marine accessories.  It should remain relatively strong
 as many <STRONG>boat</STRONG>-owners prefer to up-grade their <STRONG>boats</STRONG> rather than buying new
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.
 
 E.  COMPETITIVE SITUATION
 
 Although apparent consumption has declined significantly, the Swedish <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 building industry has done well thanks to increased sales in foreign
 markets.  The industry had a trade surplus in 1991.  It is estimated that on
 average, foreign markets account for more than 50 percent of the industry's
 output.  Japan has become the second largest market for Swedish pleasure
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> after Germany.  The industry has also been making inroads into new
 markets in South East Asia and southern Europe (Italy and Spain), which are
 regarded as good prospects for long-term growth.  It should be noted that
 the Swedish industry has increased its market share of the domestic market
 from 45% in 1990 to 50% last year.
 
 There are 10-12 large or mid-sized domestic <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builders.  The largest firm
 is Nimbus AB with annual sales of $40 million.  After a modest beginning in
 1977, the Nimbus Group has grown to become one of Europe's largest
 boatbuilders.  It presently manufactures 12 different models of motorboats
 and as of this year, the famous Maxi Yachts has become a wholly-owned
 subsidiary.  Maxi manufactures four sailboat models.  Nimbus <STRONG>Boats</STRONG> has a
 market share of 20 percent and Maxi Yachts 6 percent.  The second-largest
 domestic boatbuilder is Utternbatar AB with 9 percent market share.
 Third-largest is  Storebro Royal Cruiser AB, which primarily markets luxury
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> for wealthy consumers.  Obviously this is a sector that is not price
 sensitive.  Another well-known <STRONG>boat</STRONG>-builder is Hallberg Rassy, luxury sail
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builder, which claims to have an export share of over 90%.
 
 A breakdown by company gives the the following market shares (of the Swedish
 market) for the leading <STRONG>boat</STRONG> building firms:
 
 Nimbus <STRONG>Boats</STRONG>                      20 percent
 Maxi Yachts (Nimbus)               6 percent
 Uttern                             9 percent
 Storebro                           5 percent
 Hallberg-Rassy                     3 percent
 Najad                              1 percent
 Other domestic firms               6 percent
 
 Sales of U.S.-produced pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> came to a virtual standstill in the
 early 80s when the exchange rate was extremely unfavorable.  A turnaround
 came in 1987 when the dollar fell, and sales peaked in 1989 with a total
 volume of $35 million.  The decline in the economy has greatly affected
 sales of pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and the sales figures for 1990 and 1991 have been
 disappointing.  The year 1992 will probably turn out to be another weak year
 with at best stagnant sales.  The leading U.S. <STRONG>boat</STRONG> suppliers are Bayliner
 and Sea Ray.
 
 Norway slipped ahead of the U.S. as <STRONG>boat</STRONG> supplier to Sweden with sales in
 1990 of $23 million versus $22 million for the U.S.  The leading Norwegian
 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builder is Saga <STRONG>Boats</STRONG>, which have retained their popularity over the
 years.  Barracuda and Draco are other successful Norwegian <STRONG>boats</STRONG>.  At a time
 of continuing depressed demand, sales of Norwegian <STRONG>boats</STRONG> have remained
 relatively stable.
 
 Finland ranked third as a supplier to Sweden, exporting <STRONG>boats</STRONG> for $20
 million in 1990, and United Kingdom ranked fourth with exports of $17
 million.
 
 
 F.  MARKET ACCESS
 
 Pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are classified under tariff number 89.03 of the Harmonized
 Schedule.  Customs duties are low, only 3.8 percent.  Canoes and rowing
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are duty free.  There is a value-added-tax of 25 percent.
 
 U.S. firms normally operate through a local agent.  A number of potential
 agents as well as other key contacts are listed in the Appendix.
 
 A point of contact that should not be overlooked is Sweboat, the Swedish
 boating industries association, which will help with general information
 about the market.
 
 The purchase of a pleasure <STRONG>boat</STRONG> is almost invariably financed on credit.
 Banks and finance houses have become very careful in granting large credits,
 which has adversely affected sales.
 
 A number of firms and publications are listed in the Appendix.  Although we
 believe these to be reputable, the Foreign Commercial Service (FCS) cannot,
 of course, assume responsibility for any business relations that U.S.
 suppliers may have with them and FCS neither recommends nor endorses any of
 the firms or publications.  However, we believe that a list of this type can
 be helpful for U.S. firms attempting to find customers or other contacts in
 this region.
 
 G.  TRADE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES
 
 There is a number of magazines available to boating enthusiasts (see
 Appendix).
 
 Trade shows are very important as 50 percent of total <STRONG>boat</STRONG> sales are said to
 be consummated during trade shows.  A Marine Trades Exhibition is held each
 February/March at the Stockholm International Fairs as well as one in
 January at the Swedish Exhibition & Congress Center in Goteborg.  The events
 attract large numbers of both exhibitors and visitors.  In addition, a
 Floating <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Exhibition is held each year in early September in Stockholm
 and in late September in Goteborg.

 A. OVERVIEW:
 
 Over the past few years the UAE has developed into a popular base for
 businessmen, tourists and industrialists alike.
 
 Worldwide the UAE and Dubai in particular is becoming known as an ideal
 location for trade investment, distribution and manufacturing operations, as
 well as a first-class holiday destination featuring many of the finest
 leisure facilities available anywhere in the world.
 
 The sea-faring traditions of the Gulf are well known and even though
 traditional sailing ships, dhows continue to ply their trade across the
 Arabian Gulf, today's vessels are dominated by the power <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and pleasure
 craft which have become very popular in the UAE.  Given the coastline
 attributes of this part of the world it is hardly surprising that
 watersports should be such a popular past-time here.
 
 A number of U.S. pleasure craft firms are represented in the UAE, such as
 the Boston Whaler, Glastron, Bayliner, Chapparal and Larson, but U.S. firms
 can still find capable businessmen interested in generating sales for
 products new to this market.  The water jet ski has become very popular in
 the UAE and is a fast moving product line.
 
 
 B.  MARKET ASSESSMENT:
 
 The UAE's pleasure craft market is based on the desire of individual
 nationals/expatriates to have their own pleasure craft.  The sea is
 accessible within an hour's drive for the majority of the residents of the
 UAE.  Local production is of a very high standard and offers quality at a
 very competitive price.  Exports of local manufacture are made on a regular
 basis to all the GCC countries and even to France, the Maldive islands and
 Finland.
 
 The UAE has a long coastline with no lakes or inland waterways.  Therefore
 all pleasure craft are used in the sea, and most models purchased are
 seagoing vessels.  Traditionally, low budget <STRONG>boat</STRONG> owners had to be content
 with small rowboats which were sometimes fitted with an inboard or outboard
 engine.  Today, they have the option to purchase inflatable <STRONG>boats</STRONG> or small
 crafts which are light, fast and reliable.  Lightweight <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are ideal for
 easy transport.  However, inflatable <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are not very popular here as they
 are not very good for use on the open sea under rough weather conditions.
 These are mainly used for scuba diving.  Another factor which works against
 inflatable <STRONG>boats</STRONG> is price.  A good quality inflatable <STRONG>boat</STRONG> with accessories
 could cost almost the same as a small craft manufactured locally.
 
 Between 1988 and 1990 annual imports of pleasure crafts to the UAE grew from
 U.S. $ 5.3 million to U.S. $ 13.7 million, an average annual rate of 60% per
 year.  The market's growth is expected to continue at an estimated average
 of 50% over the next 2-3 years.
 
 Total UAE imports during 1988-1990 were:
 
 1988    U.S. $ 5.32 million, of which $ 1.9 million was for yachts and other
         pleasure vessels and $ 3.3 million for commercial vessels.
 
 1989    U.S. $ 8.2 million, of which $ 3.2 million was for yachts and other
         pleasure vessels and $ 5.0 million for commercial vessels.
 
 1990    U.S. $ 13.6 million, of which $ 4.5 million was for yachts and other
         pleasure vessels and $ 9.1 million for commercial vessels.
 
 The UAE's total market for pleasure craft in 1990 was estimated to be nearly
 U.S. $ 27.2 million.  It is estimated that approximately 50% percent of this
 market demand is met by local production.  The total market appears to have
 an annual growth rate of over 50%.
 
 Locally manufactured <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are popular as they are of a very high quality
 and available at very competitive prices.  At present there is a joint
 venture between a British company and a local company.  Another Japanese
 firm (Yamaha) have just started a joint venture with their local agents
 building their own <STRONG>boats</STRONG> in Dubai with production starting early September
 1992.  Market sources predict that <STRONG>boat</STRONG> prices will drop in the near future
 due to the stiff competition of these joint venture operations in the UAE.
 
 Though <STRONG>boats</STRONG> manufactured locally are of a very high standard, the local
 market in itself is not very big.  Market sources estimate that
 approximately 60% of these <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are exported to other Gulf countries
 including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain.  It speaks volumes when one
 considers that some Scandinavian countries are buying <STRONG>boats</STRONG> which are
 manufactured in the UAE as it is comparable to those manufactured in
 Europe.  It is cheaper to produce a <STRONG>boat</STRONG> locally than in Europe due to low
 cost labor.  The main deterrent to increased export sales to EC countries is
 high custom duties levied on non-EC manufacturers.
 
 American <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are not price competitive in the UAE any more when you take
 into consideration high shipping charges.  American companies will have to
 seriously consider setting up joint ventures or their own manufacturing
 plants in the UAE if they want to maintain/increase market share.
 
 The important factors which have a bearing on who succeeds in this market,
 are price, service, promotion and commitment to the local agent.  Support
 and quick response from suppliers are essential to success.
 
 <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> rental firms have been operating in the UAE for approximately 2 years.
 In popular demand for hire are water jet skis.
 
 
 C.  COMPETITIVE SITUATION:
 
 In the coming years, U.S. exporters will be well advised not to ignore
 several new competitors that have appeared on the scene and are working to
 increase their market share.
 
 During the period 1988-1990, the U.S. share and its major competitors stood
 as follows:
 
                 U.K.     ITALY     U.S.     PAKISTAN     TAIWAN      JAPAN
                  %          %        %           %          %           %
 1988           3.47        -      49.69       14.97        -          9.24
 1989          14.85      33.22    19.76       10.0         -          3.97
 1990          25.84      24.21    22.65       10.19       3.82        3.65
 
 Domestic Production:
 
 The domestic <STRONG>boat</STRONG> industry is medium-sized and only directs 40% percent of
 its output to the local market.  The other 60% are exported mainly to Saudi
 Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qater with a small percentage to France, the
 Maldive islands and Finland.
 
 There are currently approximately 40 boatbuilders in the entire UAE.
 However, the local shipyards are handicapped by the lack of a national motor
 manufacturer, which affects their competitiveness.  For example, of the U.S.
 $43.65 outboard engine motors sold in 1990, all were imported.
 
 U.S. firms, such as Scat Hovercraft, Sunfish/Laser Inc., Wildcat Watercraft,
 Performance Catamarans Inc., Boston Whaler, Glastron, Chapparal have a
 presence in the UAE market.  Their major competitors are Kawasaki and Yamaha
 of Japan, Bombardier SeaDoo from Canada.  Most firms carry a limited volume
 of stock while some act only as suppliers.  When local firms act as
 suppliers they usually place orders with the company only after they receive
 an order from a customer.  On an average showrooms in Dubai have on display
 5/6 crafts of local manufacture and 3-5 different kinds of water jet skis.
 
 According to industry contacts, the advantage that U.S. firms used to enjoy
 based on quality, reputation and service is fast being eroded as prices
 which have always been an important factor are no longer competitive.
 
 Promotion is also important but <STRONG>boat</STRONG> enthusiasts appear quite knowledgeable
 about the subject from reading reports and tests in foreign <STRONG>boat</STRONG> magazines.
 Local sources say that a boating magazine being prepared in the UAE is in
 the offing.
 
 For all cases, including pleasure <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and marine engines, all
 distributors/ agents provide service through their workshop, and usually
 offer a 6 month to a one-year guarantee.  Local manufacturers generally
 offer a 2 year guarantee for the hull.  Effective and well organized service
 is considered to be very important.
 
 Cost is an important competitive factor particularly in the lower to
 upper-middle price-range of the pleasure craft market.  Price is less of a
 consideration at the top end of the market where purchasers are less likely
 to be concerned about discretionary income and expenditures.
 
 Other key competitive factors in the pleasure craft market are durability,
 safety, quality, style, design, speed, capacity, and accessories.  It is not
 easy to sell a used <STRONG>boat</STRONG> in the UAE so the resale value is not a very
 important factor when buying a new <STRONG>boat</STRONG> though local market sources say that
 it is not uncommon for a local manufacturer of repute to be approached for
 <STRONG>boats</STRONG> which have been traded in for newer and faster models.
 
 
 D.  MARKET ACCESS:
 
 The commercial climate in the UAE is one of free trade and competitiveness.
 
 There are no impediments to entering the market nor are there any laws
 regulating the imports of pleasure craft.  English is the commercial
 language alongside Arabic but Arabic takes precedence in official documents
 with Government departments.
 
 Normal working hours are from 0730 or 0800 to 1330, except Thursday, when
 they close at 1200, for all government and public institutions (municipal
 offices, banks etc), while the private sector resumes for an afternoon
 session, usually from around 1600 to 1930.  Some companies in the private
 sector have a five day week with the weekends usually being Thursday and
 Friday or Friday and Saturday.  All government business must be accomplished
 during the five morning hours.  (It is not unusual for a civil servant to
 operate a private business during evening hours.)  No offices open for
 Friday, the day of rest.
 
 In order to enter the UAE market, U.S. firms must appoint an agent or a
 distributor.  Local representation is a legal condition for doing business
 in the market.  However, care is advised in the selection of an agent.  In
 selection of an agent.  U.S. suppliers are reminded that the U.A.E. Federal
 Agency Law No. 18 of 1981 and its 1989 amendments are applicable and should
 be reviewed carefully prior to appointing a local agent.  The Agency law
 favors the local traders and cancellation of agency agreements and contracts
 are difficult and costly, regardless of the severance clauses included..
 Frequent visits and strong agent support by the manufacturer both before and
 after the sale are the basic ingredients for success.  The US&FCS can assist
 in identifying reputable representatives.
 
 Local sources say that the U.S. market share has been lost partly due to
 lack of loyalty on the part of American companies to the local agent.  It is
 important to bear in mind that agents/distributors spend a lot of time and
 money in promoting a product in this area and when the product gains
 popularity, and an agency agreement has been signed, any inquiry received by
 the U.S. firm directly from any individual/company from the UAE should be
 routed through the local agent.
 
 Duty for import of pleasure craft is the usual 2%.
 
 Pleasure crafts are not presently required to be registered in the UAE.
 Local market sources say that very shortly the UAE Federal Ministry will be
 enforcing all owners of pleasure crafts in the UAE to have their <STRONG>boats</STRONG>
 registered.  They expect this to be put in effect by end this year.
 
 Distribution and Business Practices:  Domestic manufacturers sell through
 distributors and also directly to end users.  Imported <STRONG>boats</STRONG> are generally
 retailed by distributors who carry a full spectrum of product lines.  These
 importers tend to represent more than one manufacturer, frequently three or
 four, specializing in a specific product segment.  The ability to meet
 specific client needs for optional equipment, timely delivery, as well as
 price are important factors to consider when selling U.S. pleasure crafts in
 the UAE.
 
 No safety standards are set locally but the trend is to go by the standards
 set by the U.S. coastguard.
 
 Approximately 10 marinas are in the UAE which are usually run by the large 5
 star hotels or by <STRONG>boat</STRONG> clubs.  Charges for mooring are high and vary in
 price from marina to marina.  The charge is usually based on footage and on
 average could cost U.S. $ 1635/- per annum for a <STRONG>boat</STRONG> upto 20 feet.  This
 charge apart from mooring the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> would usually include maintenance, <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 washing and sometimes even battery charge.
 
 Many people who do not want to pay the high costs of berthing their <STRONG>boats</STRONG> at
 marinas moor them on buoys at sea, or keep them on trailers outside their
 homes.  Sailing <STRONG>boats</STRONG> can also be kept on beaches.  Public slipways for
 launching powerboats are available.
 
 
 E.  TRADE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES:
 
 There is a wide range of services available for the U.S. exporter interested
 in entering the UAE market.  Among these are:
 
 Agent/Distributor Service (ADS): assists in locating an agent.
 
 World Trader Data Report (WTDR): provides credit information on potential
 agents.
 
 Comparison Shopping Service: identifies the product's potential
 competitiveness in the market and also the best potential distributors.
 
 U.S. companies may display and promote their products in the only biennial
 exhibition held in Dubai, UAE.  Details are:
 
 Exhibition      :          Middle East International <STRONG>Boat</STRONG> Show
 Organizers      :          Trade Centre Management Company

 A. OVERVIEW:
 
 The UAE boating equipment and supplies market is enjoying a growth surge,
 with an estimated 25 percent annual growth rate over the next three years.
 The large rise in recent years in the number of pleasure craft in the UAE
 has created a major market for a wide array of marine products used by <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 builders, as well as those sold to the marine aftermarket.  There are
 approximately 40 <STRONG>boat</STRONG> builders in the UAE.
 
 Import figures are not available for all sectors for boating equipment and
 supplies.  Import figures are available for Internal Combustion Piston
 Engine (ICPE), marine propulsion, outboard and for ICPE, marine propulsion,
 other.
 
 In 1990, imports of ICPE marine propulsion outboards, etc. in the UAE
 amounted to U.S. $22.6 million.  Part of this was fitted on new <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and
 subsequently reexported.
 
 Many types of boating equipment and supplies are selling well.  Marine
 electronics are in great demand.  There is interest in global positioning
 systems, system C marine communications, direct dialing communication
 systems, fluxgate compasses, electronic charting, versatile screen displays
 and interfacing.  Other types of less sophisticated basic <STRONG>boat</STRONG> parts,
 equipment, and supplies are also enjoying good sales.
 
 
 B.  MARKET ASSESSMENT:
 
 The UAE boating equipment and supplies market encompasses the entire Gulf
 region.  Products are fitted to <STRONG>boats</STRONG> and sold in the UAE or exported.  UAE
 importers sell to distributors elsewhere in the GCC and to foreign <STRONG>boat</STRONG>
 builders.
 
 During the last 3 years there has been a surge in the number of pleasure
 craft sold.  This trend has boosted demand for the best types of
 maintenance, the latest equipment, the safest parts, and products for
 comfort on board in a climate which is very hot with temperatures rising as
 high as 100-122oF and humidity sometimes exceeding 90%.
 
 There are approximately 10 marinas in the UAE which are usually run by the
 larger 5 star hotels or by <STRONG>boat</STRONG> clubs.  Charges for mooring are high and
 vary in price from marina to marina.  The charge is usually based on
 footage, and on, average could cost U.S. $1635/- per annum for a <STRONG>boat</STRONG> up to
 20 feet.  This charge apart from mooring the <STRONG>boat</STRONG> would usually include
 maintenance, <STRONG>boat</STRONG> washing and sometimes even battery charge.  The rest are
 transported to and from the shore by trailer.
 
 Local sources estimate that the market for boating equipment and supplies
 should grow at an estimated average of 25% over the next three years.
 
 Total UAE imports during 1988-1990 were:
 
 1988    U.S. $ 21.36 million, of which $ 15.51 million was for ICPE marine
         propulsion, outboard, and $ 5.85 million for ICPE, marine
         propulsion, other.
 
 1989    U.S. $ 25.06 million, of which $ 17.14 million was for ICPE marine
         propulsion, outboard, and $ 7.92 million for ICPE, marine
         propulsion, other.

 UNITED KINGDOM - YACHT INDUSTRY PROFILE - IMI930224
 
 SUMMARY
 
 This article is derived from a telegraphic report dated 24 February 1993,
 prepared at the American Embassy - London.  It discusses the British
 yacht-building industry.  The article consists of 2 pages.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 24 FEB 93
 
 AMEMBASSY LONDON
 
 SUBJECT: IMI: THE BRITISH <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> INDUSTRY
 
 1. SUMMARY: THE PREVAILING VIEW AMONG EXHIBITORS AT THE
 RECENT LONDON INTERNATIONAL <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> SHOW WAS GUARDED
 OPTIMISM THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME MARKET UPTURN THIS
 YEAR.  CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN BOOSTED BY SOME UNEXPECTED
 COMPANY SALES, AND BY THE "KNOCK-ON" EFFECT OF STERLING'S
 DEVALUATION IN OVERSEAS MARKETS.  HOWEVER, SALES BY THE
 INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE, INCLUDING LEISURE AND COMMERCIAL
 BOATBUILDERS, MARINA OPERATORS, SAILMAKERS AND SUPPLIERS
 OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT, HAVE SHRUNK BY MORE THAN 25
 PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS.  IN PARTICULAR, PURCHASES
 OF MOTOR OR SAILING YACHTS  FELL BY 16 PERCENT IN 1991,
 STILL LEAVING SIGNIFICANT TOTAL SALES, INCLUDING <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG>,
 EQUIPMENT AND CHANDLERY OF $1.72 BILLION.  MANY COMPANIES
 HAVE BEEN FORCED TO TRIM BACK ON THEIR WORKFORCE OR, IN
 SOME CASES, HAVE EITHER GONE OUT OF BUSINESS ENTIRELY OR
 RETURNED VIA THE LIQUIDATORS IN A MUCH SLIMMED-DOWN FORM.
 A RESURGENCE IN SALES TOWARDS THE END OF 1992 SUGGESTS
 THIS YEAR'S PERFORMANCE WILL FURTHER IMPROVE IN A FEW
 SECTORS.  END SUMMARY.
 2. AFTER TWO DISASTROUS TRADING YEARS FOR THE INDUSTRY,
 SEVERAL <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> PRODUCERS RECORDED SUBSTANTIAL SALES IN 1992
 WHICH APPEAR TO GIVE AN INDICATION THAT THE WORST IS
 OVER.  ONE PLYMOUTH-BASED <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> BUILDER SOLD THREE 65 FT.
 MOTOR YACHTS WORTH ALMOST $1 MILLION EACH WITHIN THE PAST
 TEN MONTHS TO EUROPEAN CLIENTS, AND ANOTHER <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> FIRM
 FROM ESSEX REPORTED THAT SALES OF YACHTS IN THE $60,000
 RANGE HAVE PICKED UP OVER THE PAST THREE MONTHS.  IT IS
 NOT A UNIVERSAL UPTURN, HOWEVER, AND THE IMPROVEMENT IN
 SOME SECTORS IS ONLY SKETCHY.  MANY CHANDLERS ARE FACING
 GREAT DIFFICULTIES, AND HAVE NOT EVEN ENJOYED THE BENEFIT
 OF OWNERS RE-EQUIPPING RATHER THAN TRADING IN THEIR
 <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG>.  MARINA OPERATORS, TOO, ARE CONTINUING TO SUFFER
 AS MUCH AS ANY COMPANY IN THE PROPERTY SECTOR.  MANY
 MARINAS ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO COVER THEIR OPERATING
 COSTS, AS BOATING ENTHUSIASTS LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVE AND
 CHEAPER MOORINGS.
 3. BUT LEADING BUILDERS WITH ESTABLISHED OVERSEAS MARKETS
 HAVE RECEIVED AN EXPORT BOOST FROM THE DEVALUATION OF
 STERLING LAST SEPTEMBER.  THE GREATEST BENEFICIARIES ARE
 LIKELY TO BE THE BUILDERS OF LARGER MOTORIZED <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG>.
 SMALLER OPERATORS, IN WHAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FRAGMENTED
 INDUSTRY, ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO BEAR THE COST OF
 EXPORTING, AND WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL DEMAND IN THE U.K.
 PICKS UP.  NATURALLY, DEVALUATION WILL ALSO REDUCE IMPORT
 PENETRATION FROM THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS CONTINENTAL
 EUROPE, IN PARTICULAR SCANDINAVIA AND BELGIUM, WHICH
 BENEFITED FROM AN OVERVALUED POUND.
 4. THE U.K. BOATING INDUSTRY HAS BEEN SUSTAINED BY ITS
 EXPORT MARKET.  EXPORT SALES ACCOUNTED FOR $215 MILLION
 OF TOTAL LEISURE <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> SALES OF $365 MILLION IN 1991, BUT
 THE GLOBAL RECESSION WHICH IS NOW BEGINNING TO STRIKE AT
 SOME OF ITS TRADITIONAL OVERSEAS MARKETS LIKE GERMANY,
 AND THE RELATIVELY NEW MARKET OF JAPAN, IS CAUSING DOUBTS
 WHETHER EXPORT SALES CAN BE MAINTAINED.  JAPAN'S ECONOMIC
 TROUBLES HAVE DRASTICALLY CUT DEMAND THAT WAS BEGINNING
 TO TAKE OFF AFTER A SWITCH IN CONTEMPORARY SPORTS FASHION
 AWAY FROM GOLF TO NAUTICAL LEISURE ACTIVITIES.  THE
 DOWNTURN IN THE GERMAN ECONOMY IS THREATENING THE U.K.
 <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> BUILDERS' LARGEST SINGLE EXPORT MARKET, ALTHOUGH SO
 FAR THEY HAVE NOT SEEN ANY NOTICEABLE FALL IN DEMAND.
 5. THE BRITISH RECESSION HAS, AT LEAST, HELPED "SEE OFF"
 KEY FRENCH EUROPEAN RIVALS WHO HAD MADE GREAT INROADS
 INTO THE  U.K. BUILDERS' DOMESTIC MARKET SHARE.  SALES BY
 THE FRENCH BUILDERS, BENETEAU AND JEANEAU, HAVE FALLEN
 DRAMATICALLY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS.  TYPICAL PRODUCTS
 OF THEIRS APPEALED TO THE WELL-HEALED AMATEUR SAILOR -
 THAT SECTOR OF THE BOATING INDUSTRY THAT HAS BEEN MOST
 IMMEDIATELY AFFECTED BY THE RECESSION.  THE BRITISH
 MARINE INDUSTRIES FEDERATION BELIEVES THAT SALES IN 1992
 CONTINUED TO FALL, BUT AT A SLOWER PACE, AND PREDICTS
 THAT 1993 WILL SEE LITTLE CHANGE.
 6. PROSPECTS FOR FURTHER IMMEDIATE MARKET PENETRATION BY
 U.S. <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> BUILDERS IN GENERAL ARE NOT BRIGHT, AND HAVE
 NOT BEEN ASSISTED BY THE RECENT DEVALUATION OF STERLING.
 INDUSTRY SOURCES INDICATE THAT THE CURRENT BEST PROSPECTS
 ARE FOR SMALLER PLEASURE CRAFT SUCH AS DINGHIES AND
 INFLATABLES.  THE MARKET FOR MARINE SPORTS EQUIPMENT -
 SAILBOARDS, WINDSURFING EQUIPMENT, JET SKIS AND WET
 BIKES, ETC., REMAINS STEADY OVERALL, AS DOES THE MARKET
 FOR SMALLER HORSE POWER ENGINES.  THERE IS ALSO A
 CONSTANT DEMAND FOR MARINE SAFETY EQUIPMENT, CLOTHING AND
 FOOTWEAR.

 WORLD - PLEASURE <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> & ACCESSORIES - BMR9301
 
 SUMMARY
 
 The Best Markets list for PLEASURE <STRONG>BOATS</STRONG> & ACCESSORIES is derived from a
 report entitled "Best Markets: FY1993", dated February 1993, from the U.S. &
 Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS) - Washington, DC.  Best Markets data are
 taken from figures prepared at US&FCS posts abroad for FY'93 Country
 Marketing Plans (CMPs).  This report consists of 2 pages.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                 BEST MARKETS
                               Fiscal Year 1993
                         Pleasure <STRONG>Boats</STRONG> & Accessories
 
 The following list, based on data derived by individual US&FCS posts abroad,
 identifies the 1993 best country markets for U.S. exporters of Pleasure
 <STRONG>Boats</STRONG> & Accessories based on either 1) near-term growth potential, or 2) a
 large market receptive to additional U.S. suppliers.  Best Markets data are
 derived from industry sector rankings found in the "Best Prospects" section
 of the Country Marketing Plans (CMPs), compiled annually by US&FCS posts
 abroad.  The Best Markets listing is presented in descending order of TOTAL
 MARKET SIZE (estimated 1992 data).
 
 Please note:
    1)  All TOTAL MARKET, IMPORT MARKET, and IMPORTS FROM U.S. amounts are
        presented in US$ millions.
 
    2)  All percentage growth figures are average annual growth rates.
 
    3)  The 1 through 5 scale used to indicate RECEPTIVITY TO U.S. GOODS,
        COMPETITION, and MARKET BARRIERS should be interpreted as, the higher
        the number, the more favorable the situation to U.S. exporters.
        Therefore, a score of 5 in all three areas indicates high receptivity
        to U.S. goods, little competition, and minimal market barriers to
        imports from the U.S.
 
    4)  If a column field is left blank for any country, it is because no
        information or "n/a" was provided by the US&FCS post for that
        particular field.  Entries showing no information or "n/a" in the
        TOTAL MARKET column are located, in alphabetical order, at the end of
        the listing.
 
    5)  As US&FCS posts abroad submit a limited number of identified best
        prospects, Best Markets data cannot provide an exhaustive list for
        each industry sector.  Some unreported industry sectors from large
        country markets, although not significant enough to be included among
        their own best prospects, may be larger than the same reported
        industry sectors of smaller country markets.
 
 Data are compiled using local sources and reflect the "best estimates" of
 US&FCS commercial officers abroad.  Statistical accuracy is affected by a
 number of factors including lack of published figures for that market,
 varying sector definitions and parameters, and individual posts'
 data-gathering techniques.
 
 For more detailed information on specific Best Markets entries, see relevant
 Country Marketing Plans (CMPs) and Industry Sector Analyses (ISAs).  These
 reports are published by US&FCS and are available in the Market Research
 Reports file on the National Trade Data Bank (NTDB).

         Statistical accuracy is affected by a number of factors
         including lack of published figures for that market,
         varying sector definitions and parameters, and individual

<HR><B><CENTER>Abstract</CENTER></B><HR>
<P>An vacuum bag for forming of a fiber reinforced composite article, made of
 a curable elastomer, having molded in resin distribution means. Optional
 vacuum conduits are molded into the periphery of the bag, causing the bag
 to be adapted to any number of mold shapes. The bag contains a resin
 distribution conduit sealed into the vacuum bag. A multiplicity of cross
 channels are formed on the inner surface of the bag, covering most of the
 area under which the fiber lay up is placed within the mold. These cross
 channels can be formed from a pattern of multiple, variegated small dots
 or pentagons, which, under vacuum, leave a multiplicity of small
 crisscross channels running along the inner surface of the vacuum bag.
 This pattern of distribution channels covers most of the fiber lay up,
 except for a perimeter area which insures resin flow into rather than
 across the fiber lay up.

SAN JOSE, CA -- Graystone Elementary student Sarah Misherghi knows the importance of reading.
<p>
"I know that the more I read, the more I enjoy it," said Misherghi, who is the student body Vice President at Graystone Elementary.  "Reading makes me a better student."
<p>	The California School Boards Association (CSBA) accepted the donation of one million books to California schools by educational book publisher Scholastic Inc. to encourage recreational reading among elementary age students.  The donation, worth more than $5 million, is the largest in the publishing companys 75-year history and will be made during 1997 to schools throughout the state.

Ernest Fleishman, Scholastic Inc. Vice President, announces Scholastics donation of one million books to California schools.

	<p>The donation was announced at a press conference at the San Jose Convention Center during the annual CSBA convention.  Participants included representatives of CSBA, Scholastic Inc., students from Graystone Elementary School, and B.J. Armstrong of the Golden State Warriors.  The NBA is a major national sponsor of Reading is Fundamental (RIF), which puts 11 million books into the hands and homes of 3.8 million children each year. Scholastic is RIFs largest annual supplier of books.
	<p>"CSBA has taken a leadership role in the effort to build and improve reading performance among California schoolchildren," said CSBA President Rebecca Sargent, a member of the Redondo Beach Unified School District Board of Education.
	<p>"This remarkable contribution by one of the nations largest education publishers responds directly to studies that have found students become better, more proficient readers when they have greater access to reading materials of their own," she said, noting that CSBA recently examined literacy problems in a report called Every Student Can
Read, Every Student Will Read: Who Is Responsible for Ensuring the Literacy of Californias Students. 
	<p>Sargent said the book donation "is an important step that demonstrates commitment to the process of ensuring our young people will be part of a more literate future."
	<p>"We are proud to participate in this exciting partnership with CSBA and Californias school children," said Ernest B. Fleishman, senior vice-president/education for Scholastic Inc. said in making the donation official.  "It is a unique opportunity for California schools to strengthen reading programs by providing students with additional reading materials, and encouragement to read outside the classroom."
	<p>B.J. Armstrong of the Warriors said he was pleased to participate in the donation announcement.
	<p>The books will be donated through the non-profit CSBA Foundation; school district size will determine the number of books given to each district.  Fleishman said no district will receive fewer than 200 books.
	<p>The books are aimed primarily at children from kindergarten through fifth grade, Sargent said.  The first books were handed to the students from Graystone Elementary School at the press conference.
	<p>School districts interested in participating in the Scholastic/CSBA book donation have until Jan. 15 to return a request form that can be provided by CSBA.  For further information about the program, districts can contact Arti V. Finn, Scholastic Inc. project manager, at 212-343-6899.

		GARDEN GROVE -- Robert C. Schur, president of Western Dental Services, Inc., announced recently that independent dental consultant Neal A. Demby, DMD, MPH has completed and released the results of a quality improvement study of Western Dental Services showing that the dental HMOs quality management system is "state of the art" and "creative" and assures "above average quality as an outcome."
	<p>Western Dental Services offices received above average ratings in all categories regardless of the summary score used -- 1) chart audit; (2) clinical;
(3) treatment assessment; (4) case management; or (5) patient satisfaction.
	<p>The study concludes that Western Dental Services "has been able to not only implement a state of the art and creative quality management system, but also to assure above average quality as an outcome."
	<p>"Western Dental Services has one of the toughest and most intensive quality assurance programs in the industry and we are delighted that our system has been tested and proven by this unprecedented, independent study," Schur said.  "Patients are our number one concern at Western Dental, and this study demonstrates that our patients are getting the high-quality care that they deserve and we as a company demand."
	<p>The study evaluated the quality of care received by 6,001 Medi-Cal recipients in Western Dental staff model facilities during a two-month period beginning July 10, 1994, and ending August 31, 1994.  The study evaluated many critical quality assurance elements, including comprehensive chart audits, patient assessment, treatment assessment, case management, patient satisfaction, and infection control assessment.
	<p>As stated in the abstract of the study, "...the scope and magnitude of this study may be unequaled in the dental quality of care literature.  For these 6,001 recipients of care, using both direct and indirect quality review techniques, a national review team was able to view quality from as many known parameters as possible."
	<p>Study co-authors were Michael Mahshigian, DDS, MPH and Karen Feldman, DDS.
	<p>Western Dental Services is the largest provider of dental services in the United States and one of the leading pre-paid dental providers in California.  The company currently serves more than 370,000 plan members with more than 3,000 dentists, hygienists, dental assistants, and other professionals.  Western Dental has 77 staff model locations, 29 orthodontic staff model facilities, and more than 2,000 independent contracted dentists throughout California.

	Macys West has a strong history of giving back to the community.  From its Passport AIDS fund-raiser to the annual tree-lighting ceremony in Union Square, to Fourth of July fireworks at the Hollywood Bowl, Macys West is committed to reaching out to its customers and community.
	<p>The holidays are a special time for children.  This season, Macys West raised funds for childrens charities through its "Giving Tree" Holiday Ornament program.  Starting Nov. 29 at every Macys West store, customers purchased exclusive silver-plated, Towle star ornaments adorning special in-store "Giving Trees."

<h3>Women's Conference Brings Nation's Most Influential Women to Long Beach</h3><br>
<i>Lesley Stahl, Betty Ford, and Olivia Goldsmith Deliver Keynote Addresses to 7,000 Women</i>

For the fifth consecutive year, the "Call to Action" Governor Pete Wilsons Conference for Women drew sell-out crowds at the Long Beach Convention Center.  The 1996 conference, entitled "Passing the Torch - Women Mentoring Women," was attended by more than 7,000 participants -- the largest group of participants in the conferences five-year history.
<p>
Delivering this years keynote addresses were "60 Minutes" anchorperson Lesley Stahl, former First Lady Betty Ford and her daughter Susan Ford Bales, and First Wives Club author Olivia Goldsmith.  In addition to the keynote addresses, the conference provided participants with nearly 40 panels to choose from, ranging in topic from womens roles in the film industry, personal management skills, how to write effectively, and an analysis of the last election cycle.
<p>
The diversity of panelists and speakers also brought out a diverse group of media to cover the event, including Daily Variety, Sports Illustrated, the Los Angeles Times, Estylo Magazine, and USA Today.  The conference is also being highlighted on E! Entertainment Televisions "The Worlds Most Intriguing Women" special to air in March.  Interviews with former First Lady Betty Ford and political strategist Susan Estrich, the first woman to ever run a presidential campaign, were taped for the special on E!.
<p>
Although the "Call to Action" conference focuses on providing women with strategies for personal and professional success, the conference also offers five $5,000 scholarships to deserving students attending California educational institutions.  One scholarship is awarded in each of the following categories: Health/Medicine; Law Enforcement; Education; Business; and Math/Science.  Winners included Theresa Marie Koppie (Health/Medicine); Angela Michelle Craig (Law Enforcement); Michele Elise Betton (Education); Wendi Nicole Smith (Business); and Gloria Maria Amador (Math/Science).  Scholarships are funded by proceeds from the conference -- no state money is used to fund these scholarships.
<p>
One of the ways in which money is raised for the annual scholarships is through the donations made by corporations and companies that sponsor the conference.  Among this years many sponsors were <a href="http://www.microsoft.com"> Microsoft</a>, <A href="http://ml.com">Merrill Lynch</a>, Bristol-Myers Squibb and <a href="http://www.gap.com">The Gap</a>.
<p>
The conference, which sold-out in a matter of weeks, is the largest and most successful one-day womens conference in the country.  Conference organizers had to turn away more than 5,000 women interested in attending this years conference after it sold-out.

	The nation's eyes are on California as it becomes the testing ground for large-scale consumer and commercial usage of alternative fuel vehicles.  Recent market launches of prototype vehicles by major automakers has shifted the use of electric, natural gas and other fuels from fantasy to reality.<p>

<p>What this ultimately means for the state's economic and environmental future, as well as what impacts these and other alternative fuel vehicles will have on San Diego specifically, was debated Dec. 13 at Alternative Fuel Vehicles: A Clean Air Symposium held at San Diego Miramar College.
	<p>The annual symposium, sponsored by Citizens for Clean Air Policy in conjunction with a number of local businesses and international auto manufacturers, brings together some of the top business, environmental and health officials, as well as policy-makers in the area of alternative fuels, for a day of product expositions and panel discussions.
	<p>"We clearly are entering a time when alternative fuel vehicles are a real option for consumers and businesses," said Gordon Austin, chairman of Citizens for Clean Air Policy.  "It is critical that informed decisions are made on the local level which can promote the efficient development and utilization of these technologies."
	<p>Speakers included Congressman Bob Filner, member of the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation, and John D. Dunlap III, chairman of the California Air Resources Board.
	<p>Topics for panel discussions included local and state governmental and legislative efforts, emerging local technologies, environmental concerns and impacts on existing transportation systems.  Officials from the American Lung Association, UCSD and Children's Hospital also discussed health-related benefits of alternative fuel vehicles.

<p>

	<p>Ford Motor Corporation displayed its natural gas-powered Crown Victoria and Honda Motor Corporation previewed its 1998 Civic GX natural gas model.  A converted alternative-fueled bus from Oceanside School District was featured, in addition to a revolutionary dual-fuel electronic engine capable of running on both liquefied natural gas and diesel, developed by San Diego-based Clean Air Partners.
<br clear=all>
	<p>"We will look back on the next few years as a revolutionary period in the movement toward alternative fuels," said Austin.  "Open dialogue through events such as this symposium will help us ensure that these technologies benefit San Diego's long-term economic and environmental health."
	<p>Citizens for Clean Air Policy is a San Diego-based 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization with more than 800 members.  The organization advocates economic development and environmental sensitivity through the development and utilization of alternative fuel vehicles. 
	<p>Additional sponsors for the symposium include Cloud 9 Shuttle, Border Environmental Commerce Alliance, Laidlaw Waste Systems, San Diego Gas & Electric and Clean Air Partners.

</table>The vehicle is available by lease only at 24 Saturn dealerships in Orange County, Los Angeles and San Diego, California as well as Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona.
<p>
Six of the Saturn dealerships at which the EV1 is available are operated by Saturn of Orange County.  John Campbell, III, Chairman and CEO of Saturn of Orange County, answers some frequently asked questions about the EV1:
<p>
<i>Q:	What is the EV1?</i>
<p>
John Campbell: The EV1 is the automobile industry's first modern production electric vehicle.  The two-seat car is powered by a 137-horsepower electric motor driven by 26 lead-acid batteries.
<p>
<i>Q:	Why was the car introduced in California and Arizona?</i>
<p>
JC:	The EV1 was introduced in California and Arizona for several of reasons.  First, both states have significant smog problems and the EV1 represents the leading edge of new technologies that have the potential to significantly reduce air pollution and smog.
<p>
	Second, both states have warm climates and, with existing technology, a battery charge lasts longer in a mild climate.
<p>
	Third, California intoduced a new mandate requiring that, by the year 2003, at least 10 percent of new cars sold in the state must be zero-emission vehicles.  I am typically skeptical of government regulation because it is too often constrictive, abusive and counter productive.  However, as necessity is the mother of invention, the zero-emissions mandate in California was instrumental in the development of the EV1 and the new technologies that made it possible.  Regulatory requirements certainly accelerated the innovation represented in the EV1.
<p>
<i>Q:	What makes the EV1 unique?</i>
<p>
JC:	The EV1 is the world's most energy-efficient and technologically advanced production automobile.  The car carries 23 separate patents in a variety of new technologies.  Everything on this car has been totally rethought, reconsidered and redesigned.  It is like nothing on the road today.  It's a marvel of engineering.
<p>
<i>Q:	How does the car drive?</i>
<p>
JC:	The EV1 is more slot car than a golf cart. It accelerates from zero-60 mph in nine seconds -- about the same as a BMW 318 I.  The top speed is electronically governed at 80 mph.  Test models have been clocked at 183 mph, a land speed record for electric vehicles.  When they drive it, people are really surprised by the car's power, pep and handling.  Most people getting out of the car after a test drive display what we have come to call "the EV smile."  The EV1 is flat out fun to drive.
<p>
<i>Q:	What is the car's range?</i>
<p>
JC:	Range is probably the car's biggest drawback right now.  The EV1 can travel an average of 70-90 miles on a single charge.  The EV1 employs advanced lead acid batteries.  As additional high-performance battery technologies emerge, the range of the vehicle will improve.  Nickel metal hydride batteries have shown great promise but are currently too expensive to produce.  Lithium-based batteries are also under development.  
<p>
<i>Q:	Is charging the EV1 difficult?</i>
<p>
JC:	Charging the EV1 is as easy as inserting a lightweight charger paddle into the car's charge port.  In three hours, the car is fully charged.
<p>
<i>Q:	Is there any risk of electrocution?</i>
<p>
JC:	None. You can stand in the pouring rain holding the charger paddle and nothing will happen. It is an inductive charging system that couldn't be more safe. 
<p>
<i>Q:	Is it difficult to find a charger?</i>
<p>
JC:	People who lease the EV1 will have chargers  installed at their homes and, more than likely, at their place of business as well.  Presently, chargers are being installed at shopping centers and other public sites.  It will be some time before chargers are as prevalent as gas stations.  
<p>
Keep in mind that the market will dictate the pace of charger installation. The infrastructure for delivering electricity across the country and around the globe already exists.  Charger ports could become plentiful very quickly.  Demand will determine how quickly.
<p>
<i>Q:	What are some of the advantages of the EV1?</i>
<p>
JC:	The EV1 is clean, quiet, and reliable.  Electric power is cheaper than gasoline and electric vehicles reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
<p>
The EV1 is a non-polluting, zero-emission vehicle.  As the market grows, this car will have a substantial impact on reducing smog and improving air quality.  With the EV1, we should all breathe easier.
<p>
The EV1 makes no noise.  In fact, the car is equipped with a pedestrian horn so that the driver can alert people of the car's presence.  People will walk right in front of the car because they can't hear it coming.  With the EV1, we should all sleep better.
<p>
The EV1 employs an extremely simple and reliable electric motor.  There are very few moving parts, minimal wear and tear and exceedingly few problems.  Comparing the reliability of the electric vehicle to standard combustion engine vehicles is like comparing the reliability of refrigerators to lawn mowers.  The former tends to run trouble-free for years and years while the latter typically requires periodic service.  With the EV1, we should all worry less.
<p>
Electric power is cheaper than gasoline.  Most electricity is generated by natural gas.  The balance is produced by nuclear reactors, wind and hydroelectric generators.  On average, to move a vehicle one mile costs four cents for gasoline but only one cent for electricity.  Accordingly, electrically powered vehicles are about four times cheaper to run than gasoline powered vehicles.  With the EV1, we should all be richer.
<p>
The EV1 also reduces U.S. dependence on both foreign oil and oil in general.  Mass usage of electric vehicles would have a tremendous impact on our trade deficit and would give the U.S. greater freedom to negotiate with traditional oil powers.  Moreover, we have to face the fact that oil reserves, at current rates of consumption, will run dry in about 40 years.  It is important to transition away from fossil fuel.  The EV1 helps us make that transition without forcing increased utilization of mass transit.  It preserves the freedom and independence of personal transportation.  With the EV1, we should all be freer.
<p>
<i>Q:	Since electric power is mostly generated by burning fossil fuels, isn't it misleading to suggest that electric vehicles reduce pollution?</i>
<p>
JC:	It is true that most electric power is generated by burning fossil fuel.  However, the fossil fuel most often used at power plants is clean burning natural gas.
<p>
	More importantly, regulators and environmentalists report that the vast majority of automotive air pollution is created by the millions of vehicles that do not meet emissions standards.  It is a Herculean if not impossible task to enforce compliance on such an unwieldy number of polluters.  However, ensuring the environmental compliance of a handful of rural power plants is easier, more effective and less costly than tracking millions of mobile polluters through heavily populated areas.  Therefore, electric vehicles do reduce pollution.  More importantly, electric vehicles reduce pollution where people live.
<p>
<i>Q:	How much regular service does the EV1 require?</i>
<p>
JC:	Any maintenance or roadside assistance will be paid by GM.  That said, the only regularly scheduled maintenance suggested is tire rotation every 5,000 miles and a new air filter every 30,000 miles.  There is no oil, fuel pump or engine coolant.  No fans, belts or spark plugs.  This car is the most maintenance free vehicle on the road.
<p>
<i>Q:	How much does the EV1 cost?</i>
<p>
JC:	The car is available by lease only.  The EV1 lists at about $34,000.  The first 1,200 lessees qualify for rebates and tax credits amounting to $8,500.  Customers can expect a monthly payment of about $500 plus $50 per month to lease a charger installed at their home.
<p>
	We are eager to make the car more affordable.  The EV1 marks a radical departure in automotive design and thinking. The same market dynamics that brought you the $7,500 home computer, the $1,800 cellular phone and the $1,200 VCR are currently at work on the EV1.  As market acceptance for the car increases, prices will decrease.  Moreover, as the market for electric vehicles grows, the cars and the technologies behind them will also improve.  
     <p>
<i>Q:	Is the EV1 easily insured?</i>
<p>
JC:	Yes.  Because there is no crash, repair or performance data available on the EV1 (or any new car model), insurance companies are required by law to offer rates comparable to the rates offered on cars in the same price range.  Annual EV1 premiums for good drivers are in the $1,500 to $2,000 price range.

<center><b>ORANGE COUNTY ANNUAL SURVEY REVEALS CHALLENGES, OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATORS
<br>
Media Use Survey Finds Only 19 Percent of Orange County Residents 
Follow Local Government, Local Community News</b></center>
<p>
IRVINE, Calif.  Despite the recent Orange County bankruptcy, relatively few county residents today say they closely follow local government news (19 percent) or local community news (18 percent), while more say they are highly attentive to Washington news (35 percent).
<p>
These and other findings were released today as part of the Media Use Survey from the 1996 Orange County Annual Survey.  Results of the ten question Media Use Survey were released today by Nelson Communications Group and Mark Baldassare, co-director of the Orange County Annual Survey and professor and chair of urban and regional planning at UCI. 
<p>
Nelson Communications Group, a well respected public relations firm with offices in Irvine, San Diego and Sacramento, sponsored the ten Media Use Survey questions in the 1996 survey.
<p>
Said Baldassare, "Given that our last survey revealed 73 percent of county residents felt the bankruptcy adversely affected their lives, we were surprised to find less than one in five county residents say they are following local government and community news.  Under the circumstances, we expected that number to be considerably higher."
<p>
"The survey confirms that a small group of opinion leaders closely follow local news," said Larry Tenney, managing partner of Nelson Communications Groups Irvine office.  "A one-day story in the newspaper is likely to reach a relatively small but influential readership.  If the communications objective is to extend a story to the general public, other vehicles and tactics must be employed."
<p>
The most obvious vehicle for reaching a broader audience is television.  Consistent with national trends, the survey revealed that Orange County residents are growing more reliant on television as a source of news.  Eighty percent of residents regularly watch television news, while only 73 percent regularly read a daily newspaper and just 55 percent regularly listen to radio news.
<p>
The survey also showed that Orange County residents are more likely to get world news
from television than from newspapers (45 percent versus 31 percent).  Results revealed that,
by a three to one margin (60 percent to 21 percent) residents choose to get local news from newspapers over television. Compared to a decade ago, 12 percent fewer people today look to newspapers for world news and 14 percent fewer people look to newspapers for Orange County news.  Television has been the single largest beneficiary of these declines but radio and Internet sources have also posted audience gains at the expense of print.
<p>
"A persistent demographic gap is evident in the data," explained Tenney.  "As you would expect, better educated, higher income residents are more likely to read the paper.  For communicators dealing with high concept issues, products and services, it would be a mistake to glance at this data and write off print."
<p>
However, the expanding influence of television poses interesting challenges, particularly for professional communicators practicing in Orange County.  "Because Orange County is not a stand alone media market we have to rely on Los Angeles based broadcast," said Tenney.  "The challenge for PR pros is to give a story enough legs to make it to L.A. and back.  Successful pitches will piggyback onto national and regional news and trends.  Moreover, we have to be bold and imaginative in creating visual images that get past assignment desk clutter."
<p>	
Successful Orange County practitioners also must strive to fill news holes by taking on some of the burdens of production.  According to Tenney, "News budgets have shrunk and crews can be scarce -- particularly for events taking place 50 miles away.  However, with the rapid 
proliferation of outlets -- a trend that promises to continue -- the appetite for content has exploded.   Accordingly, there are numerous opportunities for savvy PR pros who can package news in a TV friendly manner.  Video news releases and satellite media tours are two bats with which you can hit home runs.  Anyone who tells you VNRs dont work doesnt know how to use them." 
<p>
Other results from the Media Use Survey include:
<UL>
<LI>
Fully one third of county residents believe there is a Democratic bias in news coverage of the presidential election, while nine percent say there is a Republican bias.  Forty-four percent say there is no bias at all and 15 percent said they are unsure.  These findings reveal that Orange County residents are more likely than the rest of the nation to believe the media favors Democrats in presidential election coverage.
<LI>
Two in three respondents said keeping fully informed about the news is a very important obligation, while nearly all respondents said staying informed is at least somewhat important (97 percent).  Interestingly, compared to a decade ago, the new results indicate that fewer people today believe staying fully informed is very important.
<LI>
Only three percent of survey respondents said they use the Internet as a source of news, up from zero percent a decade ago.  Said Tenney, "Ten years ago you couldnt find three people who had a clue about the Internet.  Today, Internet awareness is almost absolute and usage is expanding rapidly.  In the next five years the number of people getting news and other information from the net is going to swell like a water balloon hooked up to a fire hydrant. </UL>
If you are a communications professional and you are not actively exploring the potential of the Internet, your future is about as promising as Boris Yeltsins."
<P>
The random telephone survey of 1,000 adult Orange County residents was conducted Aug. 30 through Sept. 8, 1996.  The response rate for the survey was 68 percent.  The sampling error for the survey is plus or minus three percent at the 95 percent confidence level.
<P>
The Orange County Annual Survey, now in its fifteenth year, is supported by donations from Orange County corporations, public agencies and foundations.  Complete results of the 1996 survey will be released in early December.

<H3>Situation Analysis.</H3>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>an Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company confronted two serious problems
in its South Orange County territory -- chronic customer dissatisfaction
and aggressive efforts by a large, competing utility to take over
large sections of its operating territory.
</P>

<P>
The small coastal city of Laguna Beach proved the most decisive
battleground, although skirmishes also were fought in the communities
of Laguna Niguel, Dana Point, Laguna Hills and Mission Viejo.
The competing utility had encouraged Laguna Beach officials to
consolidate electric service by ousting SDG&amp;E from its franchise
in the southern half of the city.  When the campaign began, the
city council was solidly against SDG&amp;E and public opinion
was in favor of consolidation.
</P>

<H3>Strategy.</H3>

<P>
Nelson Communications Group devised a comprehensive program of
public affairs and community relations for the entire SDG&amp;E
service territory in Orange County, devising special tactics for
each contested community or city.  The objectives included identifying
and solidifying a base of community support; convincing the public
that SDG&amp;E rates were coming down rapidly while its competitor's
rates were increasing; and to defeat any actions by local government
to usurp existing SDG&amp;E territory.
</P>

<UL>
<LI> Over an eight-month period, the agency guided intensive activities
by SDG&amp;E, including targeted, well-publicized philanthropy;
corporate print advertising; meetings with reporters, editors
and publishers of key local communities; frequent presentations
to community groups and organizations; compelling testimony before
city councils and other governmental agencies and a number of
other activities.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Through direct mail and extensive personal and telephone contact,
a large group of citizens was identified who favored SDG&amp;E
over the competing utility.  Many were willing to call or write
their council members, and dozens volunteered to speak before
the council at key points in the process.
</UL>
 

<H3>Results.</H3>

<P>
The Laguna Beach City Council, once solidly against SDG&amp;E
and in favor of utility consolidation, voted unanimously to extend
SDG&amp;E's service franchise.  The vote came after several dozen
citizens testified on SDG&amp;E's behalf and only a few for the
competitor.
</P>

<P>
The results were identical in Mission Viejo, where only a modest
program of community relations was conducted.<p>

<P><H3>Situation.</H3>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n July 1994, the Unocal Corporation announced the establishment of a new wholly owned subsidiary, 76 Products Company.  Among its major initiatives, 76 Products was launching a new strategic marketing effort to convert 200 of its gas stations to  multi-format retail centers including gasoline, fast food and convenience stores (FastBreak).
<p>
Three weeks prior to the official opening of the first new station in Lebec (Grapevine), California, 76 Products retained Nelson Communications Group (NCG).  The objectives were: (A) gain widespread media coverage (this would be the first pro-active media relations campaign in recent Unocal history), (B) maximize/leverage corporate marketing initiatives, and (C) generate goodwill in the local community.
<p>
<h3>Strategy.</h3>
NCG proposed bringing together Fortune 500 executives, a sports celebrity, children and leading-edge technology at one time in hopes of generating broad media interest in the story.   The grand opening event themed "Hoop it Up" was developed including: site visit and media availability by Unocal executives; appearance by a Los Angeles Clippers player; activities, tours, refreshments and favors for community leaders and youth; an aggressive media relations effort targeting Los Angeles and Bakersfield press; and production and distribution of a VNR since the site itself was so remote.  
<p>
<h3>Tactics.</h3>
Internal e-mail was used to notify and collect RSVPs from 76 Products staff for preview tours of the site.  During the bus ride to the site, a presentation was given to update employees on the new marketing effort and answer any questions.
<p>
Nearly 50 youth from the Bakersfield Boys and Girls Club were transported to the site. Los Angeles Clipper Loy Vaught posed for pictures, signed autographs and conducted a basketball clinic for the youth. All guests  received  specially made basketballs resembling Unocal 76 antenna balls as well as gift bags including samples from Nathan's  Famous and other convenience store vendors. Existing brand characters (Sixie, Frankster, M&M Man, etc.) were present for photo ops. A special recording of "ball" related music (Take Me Out to the Ball Game, Great Balls of Fire,  Pin Ball Wizard and Heard it Through the Grapevine, etc., was broadcast over the PA system.
<p>
Unocal executives were given a complete briefing binder the week prior to the event including fact sheets, current site specific marketing statistics and a script/timing for the event. Rather than a traditional ribbon cutting, a "Slam Dunk" was executed by the president of 76 Products with an "assist" from Vaught. Executives toured the site and conducted media  tours and interviews.
<p>
The week prior to the launch, teaser pitch calls were made to selected Bakersfield media outlets to help determine  interest and devise the most effective pitch for the grand opening. The Bakersfield Californian ran a story which was a  catalyst for a TV news spot by the local ABC affiliate. The TV story focused on the "Talking Pump" -- a story outline similar to that we had proposed for a VNR.
<p>
<h3>Results.</h3>
Media coverage was unprecedented in the history of gas station openings. All three Bakersfield network affiliates covered the event on site as did the Fox and ABC affiliates out of Los Angeles. The VNR was picked up nationally by CNN and USA  Network as well as 10 other regional network affiliates -- a total of more than 3.6 million viewers. The major newspapers in Southern California all covered the story as did LA's top three news radio stations. The leading industry publication, Journal of Petroleum Marketing, subsequently featured the project on its cover.
<p>
A survey/marketing report was compiled following the event which analyzed customer opinion/preference and indicated an increase in sales following the official grand opening.
<p>
In all, more than 300 people attended the "Hoop it Up" events.
<p>
Overwhelming media interest in the "Talking Pump" caused 76 Products to file for trademark rights on the term.

He also acts as a consultant to public affairs campaigns with major mass communications elements as well as grass roots lobbying campaigns.
<p>
Rick began with the agency in 1981, rising from assistant account executive to vice president.  He served as statewide grass roots chairman for the campaign to defeat Proposition 11, a California initiative to require deposits on beverage containers; as deputy campaign manager on the Arizona No on 200 campaign dealing with hospital regulation; and as agency lead on the campaign to defeat Santa Barbara Proposition A, which would have curtailed offshore oil drilling in California.
<p>
Manter left the agency to create his own consulting practice in 1986.  He rejoined the agency as a subcontract professional in 1990, serving as campaign manager for the No on Proposition 134 campaign, a $22 million California campaign managed by Nelson Communications Group to defeat proposed alcohol beverage taxes.
<p>
In 1992, as an independent consultant, Rick co-managed the campaign of California Republican U.S. Senate nominee Bruce Herschensohn. An underdog in the primary, Herschensohn was outspent by more than 50 percent, yet still gained the nomination. In a similar situation during the general election, Rick helped lead a ground swell of support before Herschensohn was narrowly defeated.
<p>
Rick has managed a number of successful candidate and initiative/referenda campaigns and public affairs projects on behalf of petroleum, development, beverage and related interests in California, Nevada, New Jersey and Maryland.
<p>
Rick is a 1981 honors graduate of California State University, Fullerton, with a communications major and political science minor.

<FONT SIZE="+2">B</FONT>ob Giroux joined  Nelson Communications Group as vice president after an 11 year career in the California State Legislature.  Bob provides strategic counseling and grass roots mobilization management for a wide range of clients, and during election years, will work primarily with election and campaign issues.
<p>
Prior to joining Nelson Communications Group, Bob served as the Senior Consultant  on legislative matters to Senator Lucy Killea (I) in this capacity.  There, he analyzed policies including transportation issues, the state budget, auto insurance, corporate finance and domestic abuse.  He was also responsible for securing funding for several parks and transportation projects in and around San Diego County including the reverting of toll fees from the Coronado Bridge from the state back to the county in 1991, a project that has helped fund several transportation projects in the San Diego region.
<p>
Before he joined Senator Killeas staff, Bob worked as the Senior Consultant to the Assembly Ways & Means Budget Subcommittee #6, where he was responsible for the budgets of CalTrans, California Highway Patrol (CHP) and Department of Motor Vehicles.  He also worked for three years on the staff of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, assigned to work with  members of the Assembly Democratic Caucus.
<p>
Bobs political experience is not limited to the halls of the California Legislature, as he has run and won several successful campaigns throughout the state of California.  Among them were the mayoral race in Riverside, in which Bob ran a successful campaign for Ron Loveridge in 1994, for which he recently won a Poli Award.  In 1992, Bob organized Senator Killeas re-election campaign after she left the Democratic party and ran as an independent, incurring a more lengthy and challenging candidacy process.  He also ran the 1990 campaigns for Propositions 108 and 111, and the No on 128 (Big Green) campaign in three Southern California counties.
<p>
During his collegiate career, Bob served as the President to the California Community College Student Government Association, the Legislative Director for the CCSGA, and as the student member of the Chancellors Advisory Committee.  In 1984, Bob began his career in the Legislature with the Assembly Committee on Labor as an Assembly Fellow, a prestigious policy position in California state government.
<p>
Bob is a graduate of San Francisco State University where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in History.
<p>
Bob lives in Sacramento with his wife Lisa and three children.

<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he news media can be the most credible and cost-effective way
to spread your organization's message.  But it must be handled
with the skill and understanding that only hands-on experience
can bring.
</P>

<P>
That's why the professionals at Nelson Communications Group come
from all parts of the media, including an Emmy award-winning TV
journalist and other prize winning reporters whose work has appeared
in every media market in California.
</P>

<P>
We help our clients gain coverage in every major news outlet in
California - and beyond. We have placed stories for our clients
in every major national news outlet, including the<EM> Wall Street
Journal</EM>, <EM>Newsweek</EM>, <EM>Esquire</EM>, <EM>USA Today</EM>,
<EM>Washington Post</EM>, ABC World News, CBS Morning News, The
Today Show, <EM>Los Angeles Times</EM>, <EM>New York Daily News</EM>
and CNN's <EM>Technology Today</EM>.
</P>

<P>
A national consumer group received more than 1,000 print stories
and hundreds of television and radio stories across the country,
helping them fight higher taxes and government regulation.  Our
work for the Association of American Railroads resulted in a strong
story in <EM>U.S. News</EM> <EM>and</EM> <EM>World Report</EM>.  But
that was just the first step.  We then used reprints as an important
source document in an upcoming battle over freight rail regulations.
</P>

<P>
Our efforts for the Office of the District Attorney of Orange
County produced a leading story and graphic in the <EM>Wall Street
Journal</EM>. This gave their anti-bad check campaign instant credibility
- and results - with local business leaders.
</P>

<P>
To unveil significant proposals for education reform, we helped
the California Teachers Association arrange and execute simultaneous
press conferences in each of six major media markets.  Those announcements
were followed up with editorial board visits to all of California's
major daily newspapers within the following two weeks.  The results
were favorable subsequent editorials and, more importantly, strong
favorable coverage for the CTA related to a statewide &quot;Education
Summit&quot; organized by California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown.
<P>
 
<P>
In Orange County, after we positioned executives at a Big 6 accounting
firm as financial experts, their presence in the media - and credibility
with potential clients - increased almost overnight.
</P>

<P>
Our media experts promote and extend special events including
the annual Charlton Heston Celebrity Shoot, the opening of the
Gorbachev Foundation's U.S. headquarters at the Presidio in San
Francisco, General Norman Schwarzkopf's Southern California speaking
tour and an ARCO sponsored motivational event for high school
students featuring famed teacher Jaime Escelante and the NBA Sacramento
Kings.
</P>

<P>
We have prepared our clients to meet with the editorial boards
of every major newspaper in the state.  Our expertise extends
to placement in key trade publications, talk radio, video news
releases and satellite media tours.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">Y</FONT>ou've never heard about most of
the work Nelson Communications
Group has done in crisis communications.
</P>

<P>
That's because smart crisis communications means avoiding crises
in the first place.
</P>

<P>
But when danger threatens our clients our media expertise and
battle-tested staffers can really pay off for you.  How's this
for a crisis: Sam Donaldson of ABC News wanted to know why - not
if - one of our health care clients had mistreated a woman with
breast cancer.  Within hours, we found out the facts and gave
our client a step-by-step plan for dealing with the most aggressive
reporter on television.
</P>

<P>
Donaldson interviewed three of the company's top executives. 
We showed them how to make their case with conviction, authority
and credibility.  The result was no story for Donaldson.  No crisis
for our client.
</P>

<P>
In another case, a Southern Pacific Transportation Company railroad
car derailed in Northern California, killing fish along a 30-mile
stretch of the Sacramento River.
</P>

<P>
It is no exaggeration to say that the survival of a company depends
on what it does and communicates in this kind of crisis.
</P>

<P>
Nelson Communications showed Southern Pacific how to meet the
crisis with total honesty, candor and commitment to restore the
environment and pay for the clean-up.  After educating the client,
we then educated press, legislators, regulators and other business
and political leaders about Southern Pacific's efforts.
</P>

<P>
It paid off.  (&quot;Southern Pacific Apologizes For River Spill,&quot;
read the headline in the <EM>Los Angeles Times</EM>.) There is no
question that, short-term, the spill hurt the company's image.
But long-term, Southern Pacific's efforts and attitudes toward
the clean-up actually enhanced the company's image by demonstrating
its openness and honesty and ability to get things done responsibly.
</P>

<P>
At the one-year anniversary of the spill, that is exactly what
many media outlets reported about Southern Pacific.  As was seen
in the pages of the <EM>Los Angeles Times</EM>: &quot;Railroad Mending
Fences in Dunsmuir.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Three years after the spill, communications professionals throughout
the state point to our crisis control program for Southern Pacific
as the text book example of crisis communications.
</P>

<P>
Our crisis communications expertise has helped numerous corporations
and organizations faced with law suits and accusations, bankruptcy,
government investigations, environmental spills and consumer recalls.

<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>n unfortunate fact is that most companies will eventually find
themselves exposed to the public affairs environment -- maybe
because of unfair government regulation or new taxes, disgruntled
neighbors or community activists, or legislation and public policy
considerations that could hurt business.
</P>

<P>
When that happens, your company needs people who know the issues,
know the players and know how to get things done.  People who
have been there: Nelson Communications Group.
</P>

<P>
Anheuser-Busch has retained us for public affairs since 1981.
We have successfully helped them battle against higher taxes
and more regulation throughout the country.
</P>

<P>
August Busch III, company chairman, commended us for &quot;excellent
work on behalf of our Industry and Government Affairs and Consumer
Awareness and Education divisions.  You have played key roles
in the creation and growth of these efforts.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Our work for Southern Pacific Transportation Company and Association
of American Railroads improved their relationships with regulators,
key state legislators and the news media.
</P>

<P>
In San Diego, we helped Sea World overcome opposition to a new
exhibit.  &quot;We hired Nelson Communications Group and they
worked wonders,&quot; said Michael Cross, general manager at Sea
World.  &quot;They increased our profile and raised local awareness
of Sea World as a major player in the local economy.  This helped
our business.  A lot.&quot;
</P>

<P>
When major land developers and real estate interests like The
Irvine Company, Koll Real Estate Group, McDonnell Douglas Realty,
Ford Motor Land Company, Disney Development, Baldwin Company and
Fieldstone needed help with entitlement and project approvals,
we put together solid grass roots and community relations efforts
to keep things moving forward on time and within budget.
</P>

<P>
Our public affairs expertise includes everything from placing
op-ed articles and preparing presentations for public hearings
to directing large scale grass roots letter writing campaigns
and producing satellite news conferences.  We attribute our public
affairs success to the high-level experience our staffers have
in business, media and government.
</P>

<P>
Our staff includes people such as
<A HREF="donna.html">Donna Lucas</A>,
a former gubernatorial
and presidential press aide;
<A HREF="khbio.html">Karen Hutchens</A>,
former director of
government affairs and a chief negotiator for a major California
utility;
<A HREF="ltbio.html">Larry Tenney</A>,
former senior aide to a U.S. Senator from
California; and,
<A HREF="tw-bio.html">Tom Wilck</A>,
former assistant
adminstrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration and deputy
chairman of the Republican National Committee.  Agency chairman
<A HREF="bnbio.html">Robert Nelson</A>
served on President Clinton's transition team and
now represents the President on the U.S. Competitiveness Policy
Council.
</P>

<P>
These people are not just names with fancy titles:  Their work
will get you results.  San Diego Gas and Electric vice president
Ron Fuller said we have &quot;without a doubt, the most talented
public affairs professionals in the field.&quot;

<FONT SIZE="+2">Y</FONT>our most valuable asset is your reputation.
The better people
feel about your company, the more likely they are to buy your
product, or listen to your ads or accept your ideas.
</P>

<P>
You can build your sales by first building your image.  That's
corporate branding.
</P>

<P>
Our corporate communications efforts begin with research: tailoring,
targeting and focusing your message.  After that, we'll use a
combination of resources, from media training and ghost-writing
to print ads and television production.  Our editorial and advertising
work with trade magazines has been particularly effective in increasing
our clients' credibility.
</P>

<P>
We helped a leading Orange County based health care company
prepare for and conduct business during the national debate on
health care reform.  After exhaustive opinion research with members,
employer groups, physicians and policy makers, we provided media
relations strategies, wrote background articles for newsletter
publications, ghost wrote timely trade features for senior executives,
arranged speaking engagements and outlined executive speeches,
developed new logos and collateral and prepared corporate marketing
materials.
</P>

<P>
We helped home-building executives at the Baldwin Company weather
some bad publicity and assist relations with investors and prospective
home buyers.
</P>

<P>
Other companies find our corporate communications expertise helpful
as they begin new ventures.  After we helped
<A HREF="unocal.html">Unocal's 76 Products Company</A>
launch its new FastBreak retail centers, we went on to
provide internal and external public relations support for their
launch of Reformulated Gasoline (RFG) and other corporate marketing
objectives.  We developed an entire annual corporate communications
plan including corporate collateral, employee/dealer communications,
media relations, corporate charity and sponsorship opportunities,
community and government relations.  And we developed and are
managing a comprehensive internal and external communications
program for Unocal as it plans to relocate 700 employees from
Los Angeles to Orange County.

<P>
For 18 years, we have helped scores of other corporations -- large
and small -- produce effective corporate brochures and annual
reports, image advertising and direct mail, videos and employee
communications.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he <EM>Los Angeles Times</EM> said Nelson Communications &quot;knows
the value of putting together broad coalitions so that their client's
position will not be seen as narrow or self-serving.&quot; Or,
we might add, easy to beat.
</P>

<P>
The best way to move the vote of a public official is first to
move the minds of his or her constituents. 
</P>

<P>
We help our clients use grass roots lobbying to convert doubters
about a public policy into supporters for winning ideas.
</P>

<P>
Grass roots lobbying means finding your natural allies - your
employees, customers, suppliers, neighbors or even competitors
- then showing them how you can work together to meet a common
goal.  At times, that means recruiting local leaders to turn hostility
against a real estate project into community support for sensible
land use planning, jobs and economic development - as we did for
several Wal-Mart developments in San Diego, and for the Koll Company
in Orange County.
</P>

<P>
Other times it means saving beer consumers - and the beer industry
- hundreds of millions of dollars by preventing higher taxes,
as we did when we generated 15 million contacts with state and
federal officials successfully protesting higher taxes and more
regulation.  Many of these letters were generated by a national
consumer group we founded in 1987 and still help manage.
</P>

<P>
Independent groups that we have founded and managed, such as Citizens
for Clean Air Policy and the California Voluntary Health Care
Alliance, provide our clients with some of their most effective
advocacy.
</P>

<P>
Andy Mikashus, head of Regional Governmental Affairs for the Adolph
Coors Company, said Nelson Communications had the &quot;ability
to lead strongly, cajole when needed and to find consensus ...
 This coalition had very strong egos and personalities.  As in
the past, you accomplished your winning mission by promoting its
strengths and down playing its weaknesses.&quot;
</P>

<P>
That's why we've managed some of the largest and broadest grass
roots coalitions in California.
</P>

<P>
In 1992, we developed perhaps the broadest citizen coalition in
California history including, the American Association of Retired
Persons (AARP),
<A HREF="cta.html">California Teachers Association</A>,
California League
of Women Voters, AFL-CIO, National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People (NAACP), Governor Pete Wilson, the Reverend
Jesse Jackson, Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and the San Diego
Business Roundtable among hundreds more.
</P>

<P>
Grass roots lobbying starts with opinion and issue research that
is, quite simply, the most sophisticated in California.  From
there, research dictates strategy.  This often includes the development
of third-party supporters, coalition building, support for legislative
advocates, media relations, issue advertising, direct mail response,
generating letters to the editor and testifying at public hearings.
</P>

<P>
Tactics may change but our emphasis on results does not.  <EM>Forbes</EM>
magazine called one of our clients &quot;California's most powerful
lobby.&quot;  San Diego Gas and Electric Vice-President Ron Fuller
said Nelson Communications had &quot;without a doubt the most
talented public affairs professionals in the field.&quot;
</P>

<P>
We've used this expertise throughout California to organize winning
citizen efforts on behalf of large-scale real estate development
projects, natural gas pipelines, oil drilling, railroads and manufacturing.
</P>

<P>
Some clients who have benefited from our grass roots lobbying
include the Association of American Railroads, Anheuser-Busch,
Gatlin Development's Wal-Mart projects, Indian tribe Muht-Hei,
Inc.'s landfill, California Teachers Association, ARCO, and Citizens
for Clean Air Policy.

Face-to-face contact between your executives and members of the
media may sound scary, but it needn't be.  We'll show you how
to be comfortable with reporters - yes, even the most aggressive
ones.  We'll show you how the media can help you achieve your
goals - because we'll show how to help them achieve theirs.
</P>

<P>
You'll be working with some of the most highly acclaimed reporters
in California.  People who have been there:  Emmy award-winning
TV journalist
<A HREF="swatt.html">Steve Swatt</A>;
award-winning investigative reporters;
and top-level political press aides.
</P>

We'll show you what reporters really want - and how to give it
to them in a way that benefits your organization.  We'll show
you how to make good news newsworthy, and bad news flat and uninteresting.

Our media training for Orange County developer Kathryn Thompson
has helped her with numerous appearances on national television,
including Larry King Live.  Her effective performance has led
to invitations to White House press conferences.
</P>

<P>
Our extensive group media training for 500 leaders of the
<A HREF="cta.html">California Teachers Association</A>
was an important reason why the school voucher
initiative was defeated.
</P>

<P>
We trained each in the discipline necessary to control a volatile
political message.  We also showed them basic rules of the media
each would be working with.
</P>

<P>
Our trainees spoke to television, newspaper and radio reporters
with authority, passion and commitment.  They were the campaign's
biggest asset.  It showed up in the huge margin of victory on
election day.

<FONT SIZE="+2">B</FONT>udweiser did not need Nelson Communications Group to help them
sell beer.  Nor did Nelson Communications have much to teach Unocal
76 about selling gas.  Or Home Depot about marketing screen doors.
</P>

<P>
But these are just a few of the Fortune 100 companies that retained
Nelson Communications after finding themselves with an opportunity
outside their usual marketing expertise.  They came to Nelson
Communications for marketing promotion because of our depth of
expertise in research, media relations, special events, market
launches and corporate communications.
</P>

<P>
Unocal, for example, recently opened a combination gas station
and fast food outlet in Southern California.  This is the first
of 200 such facilities.  Nelson Communications provided marketing
and media services that made this opening one of the most successful
in the petroleum industry.
</P>

<P>
The event attracted attention from all the major Southern California
media, including the Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles network TV
affiliates, and drive-time talk radio.  The opening also received
national print and electronic coverage in CNN and trade journals
such as the Journal of Petroleum Marketing.  This coverage made
consumers more receptive to future advertising.
</P>

<P>
Following several such market launches, Larry Higby, president
of Unocal's 76 Products Company said, &quot;You and your team
do a fabulous job and are to be congratulated.&quot;  And Barbara
Barry, Unocal's marketing manager said, &quot;Thank you for the
110 percent effort.  As far as I'm concerned, you walk on water.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Home Depot retained Nelson Communications to promote store openings
on the West Coast.  We attracted local and national print and
broadcast coverage for store openings as well as company activities,
such as Home Depot's community relief efforts after the Los Angeles
earthquake, and the company's Olympic Jobs Opportunities Program.
As a result, Home Depot has adopted Nelson Communications' Grand
Opening Manual at stores throughout the country.
</P>

<P>
Our market research and promotion activities helped Chapman University
increase market share.
</P>

<P>
Other marketing promotion clients have included Mojave Pipeline,
the University of California Irvine Center for Health Sciences
and McDonnell Douglas Realty.

<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>hen Nelson Communications Group suggested to the
<A HREF="http://www.ihf.org">Irvine Health Foundation</A>
that a site on the Internet's World Wide Web could help them raise awareness
for their various causes, few people had even heard of this global computer
network.
</P>

<P>
Little did anyone know that in a period of about 18 months, more than three
million pages of information, including graphics, sound, video and
three-dimensional images would be added to the World Wide Web. In fact, in
the time it took you to read the last two sentences, approximately 19 new
Web sites just went online -- we say approximately, because the Internet's
rate of growth gets faster every day.
</P>

<P>
Today, the Internet and various commercial online services are changing how
people interact and do business. That's why it's comforting to have
experienced communicators like the professionals at Nelson Communications
Group to help you navigate through the bytes and bits of information, and to
make sure your messages don't get lost in the translation.
</P>

<P>
We've taken our various areas of expertise and applied them to the online
world. Just as we were among the first to use leading-edge technologies such
as satellite news conferences and video press releases, we now use online
services to support client goals in innovative ways ahead of our competitors.
</P>

<P>
For example, the Internet represents a growing segment of the community and
as such can be a great tool for coalition-building -- an area in which
Nelson Communications Group has had more than two decades of success. Our
Web sites and online programs serve as communications hubs for both
statewide and national coalitions, where members can communicate on private
networks and new members are recruited and asked to take action.
</P>

<P>
And with our targeted and carefully managed approach to online public
relations, we make sure our clients get more than just attention -- they get
results.
</P>

<P>
Remember that local grantmaking foundation?
</P>

<P>
&quot;Bravo -- your Web site is outstanding,&quot; Janelle Hall, president
of the National Breast Cancer Foundation, said in a e-mail message to our
client. That's not all -- the Foundation's promotion of a key study on
HIV/AIDS throughout the Internet and commercial online world caught the
attention of a national health journal, and the Foundation's site is now
listed alongside major Foundations, such as the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation, on a national list of &quot;must-see&quot; sites.
</P>

<P>
In the brave new online world, Nelson Communications Group can help you cut
through the clutter and get your point across in a language people can
comprehend. We not only have the technological expertise, but more than 18
years of public relations and public affairs experience to make sure your
messages are received and understood.<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT>espite the defeat of the
school voucher initiative, Proposition 174, Californians
continued to demand improvements in public schools.
The California Teachers Association (CTA) proposed a plan for
school improvement addressing the needs of students in the 21st
century entitled Rediscovering Education, which it presented at
the Education Summit on February 15, 1994.
Nelson Communications was retained to plan and implement an
advertising campaign highlighting the plan, and to implement
a statewide media relations campaign.
</P>

<H3>Goals.</H3>

<P>
Set a positive and receptive tone for CTA's advertising
campaign by presenting its school improvement plan to the
media and public as a sincere, well thought-out effort.
Draw media attention to CTA's education reform plan,
while at the same time, minimize negative or cynical coverage.

<H3>Tactics.</H3>

<UL>
<LI> Nelson Communications scripted and produced two English language,
two Spanish language and one Los Angeles market television commercial.
The Los Angeles market advertisement emphasized rebuilding following
the Northridge, California earthquake.
NCG also scripted and produced radio English and Spanish language
radio advertisements with the same themes.
NCG wrote and designed a four-color brochure which summarized
the CTA plan and which was available via an 800 number featured
in the advertisements.  
<BR><BR>
<LI> Media relations activities to support this campaign included:
the organization of four simultaneous news conferences throughout
the state, the creation of a comprehensive press kit for
distribution to education writers and editors statewide,
the coordination of editorial board meetings to occur prior
to the Education Summit, and the creation of a letters to
the editor kit.
NCG also produced a video news release (VNR) and two radio
news releases (RNR) for statewide distribution, and coordinated
radio and television satellite tours in Sacramento for the
president of CTA.
</UL>

<H3>Results.</H3>

<P>
The television and radio ads resulted in 32,585 requests
via the 800 number for the English version of the CTA
brochure outlining the reform plan, and 4,005 requests
for the Spanish version.
The media relations program successfully negated any criticism
of the television and radio ads, and secured over 20 editorial
board meetings prior to the Education Summit, which fostered
an understanding of the plan among the media.
The launch of the ads gained media coverage in the Sacramento Bee,
San Diego Union Tribune, Political Pulse/Education Beat, La Opinion,
KRBK-TV, KVEA-TV, KGTV, KDTV-Spanish TV, KBNT-Spanish TV, KXPR-FM,
KNX-AM, KFWB-AM and KSDO-AM.
Coverage was also garnered in 113 radio broadcasts as a result of
the radio news release.

<H3>Situation.</H3>

<P>
Billed as a &quot;nickel a drink&quot; tax, Proposition 134 held
universal voter appeal, drawing on the concept of using alcohol
taxes to pay for social costs.  Proceeds from the tax were earmarked
for problems related to alcohol abuse.
</P>

<P>
The proposed initiative posed an enormous threat to the alcohol
beverage industry.  Under the proposition, beer and spirits taxes
would increase nearly twice the national average of other license
states - 1300% and 320% increases, respectively.  Wine taxes would
increase nearly 13,000%.
</P>

<H3>Strategy.</H3>

<UL>
<LI> Initial polling in 1989 indicated that more than 80% of California
voters supported the tax.  Traditional &quot;anti-tax&quot; arguments
were marginally effective - only a small core of anti-tax voters
could be counted on to oppose the measure.
<BR><BR>
<LI> A coalition of alcohol beverage interests hired Nelson Communications
Group to create Taxpayers for Common Sense and develop and manage
the campaign.
<BR><BR>
<LI> The campaign was largely driven by research.  This included about
10,000 telephone interviews, 4,500 one-on-one mall intercept tests
and 38 focus groups statewide in the span of 18 months.  A series
of economic impact reports was also commissioned.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Both quantitative and qualitative research pointed to the importance
of moving away from a debate about alcohol taxes or the social
cost of alcohol abuse, both of which the voters would strongly
approve.  Instead, specific flaws in the proposition were unveiled
and public focus was shifted to these defects.
<BR><BR>
<LI> The campaign steered voters to the deception and infractions
of the proposition with a calm voice of reason which urged California
to &quot;read it yourself.&quot;  Advertising was tagged with
the slogan, &quot;it's not what it claims.&quot;
<BR><BR>
<LI> Twenty-five television and 40 radio spots were developed with
air dates as early as June, 1990.  Print ads were limited to placement
late in the campaign to reinforce messages.  Nelson Communications
produced more than four million pieces of campaign mail, including
2,250,000 copies of the actual proposition text.  The campaign
also signed on to 38 pieces of slate mail.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Press activities were cultivated early in the campaign, utilizing
solid economic facts, research and proposition text to reinforce
basic themes of the campaign.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Using a variety of vehicles such as newsletters, videos and action
alerts, grassroots efforts educated and involved thousands of
industry and non-industry stakeholders in the campaign.  The speakers
bureau consisted of more than 240 speakers while a total of 323
speaking engagements were scheduled.
</UL>

<H3>Results.</H3>

<P>
Ultimately, Proposition 134 was defeated by a vote of 69% No
to 31% Yes.  In 1989, polls showed Proposition 134 passing by
81% to 16%.
</P>

<P>
By election day, more than 10,000 active opponents of Proposition
134 had been recruited to campaign for its defeat.  In the numerous
appearances during the closing weeks of the campaign, no proponents
were present, due to the fact that the proponents could match
neither quality nor quantity of our speakers.
</P>

<P>
At the end of the campaign, more than 60% of those polled recalled
seeing No on 134 advertising.  Of California's 118 daily newspapers,
virtually every major newspaper in California editorially opposed
Proposition 134.

<H3>Situation Analysis:</H3>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n 1996, Unocal's 76 Products Company was undergoing a transformation from an old-style oil company to a modern convenience retailer focused on customer service.  The company's goals in this regard were ambitious:  to open more than 100 new format service stations by the end of the year, including 76 FastBreak convenience stores, 76 ProWash car washes and 76 AutoPulse (car care) operations throughout California and in Hawaii.  In doing so, Unocal 76 hoped to establish a reputation for understanding what customers wanted and for innovation in the category.  Much could be achieved through conventional advertising and public relations techniques.  But some very practical obstacles needed to be overcome. Unocal 76 needed to gain construction permits as well as permits to sell beer and wine, often in communities with strong opposition to such sales.
<p>
<h3>Strategy.</h3>Nelson Communications Group (NCG) recommended the development of a mix of community relations programs under a "brand name" -- StreetSmart 76.  StreetSmart 76 would position the company as a responsible retailer, one that cared about the safety of its customers and the communities it served, in this way building goodwill among local leaders while also reinforcing the company's customer focus.  StreetSmart 76 was planned around issues of relevance to the motorist.
<p>
Initially, it was decided, programs would be focused in areas identified as "hotspots"  -- namely Inglewood, El Monte, Oakland and Laguna Beach.
<p>
<h3>Implementation.</h3>
StreetSmart 76 was launched on Memorial Day, 1996, when the 76 FastBreak convenience store in Huntington Beach, California, held a pledge weekend during which hundreds of customers made a commitment not to drink and drive. Brochures, stickers, decals and StreetSmart 76 antenna balls were handed out.  Customers were urged to read Unocal's own "Pledge to be StreetSmart," which notes the extra steps the company takes to keep its stores as safe and secure as possible.  Dozens more pledge weekends were held that summer and StreetSmart 76 also sponsored DUI checkpoints.
<p>
StreetSmart 76 also produced "don't drink and drive" posters which were sent to colleges during the National Collegiate Alcohol and Drug Awareness Week.
<p>
StreetSmart 76 also focused on kids' safety during Halloween.  Promotional stickers included tips on staying safe on the roads while trick-or-treating, and a pledge that both kids and parents signed, promising to observe safety rules.
<p>
NCG raised visibility for the program among key audiences through several mailings, ads in community newspapers, a limited news media campaign, an exhibition booth at the League of California Cities annual conference, and events in strategic locations.
<p>
<h3>Results.</h3>
<ol>
<li>The City of Inglewood had been adamantly opposed to issuing a beer and wine 	permit to Unocal 76, just six weeks prior to the launch of StreetSmart 76.  After an 	event to which city council members, law enforcement and the local Chamber of 	Commerce were invited, and the sponsorship of a local DUI checkpoint during 	which nearly 1,000 StreetSmart 76 brochures as well as hundreds of antenna balls 	were distributed, the city, with the strong support of the local police, decided to issue 	the permit to Unocal -- a responsible retailer.
<li>The City of El Monte declared July "Unocal StreetSmart 76 Month" and carried 	StreetSmart 76 antenna balls on all city vehicles; Whittier also issued a proclamation 	recognizing StreetSmart 76 as a valuable community program.
<li>Goodwill toward Unocal 76 was clearly demonstrated by the unequivocal support of 	many city councils and law enforcement groups, including:
<ul>
<li>the Orange County Sheriff's Department as well as the Huntington Beach, El 			Monte, Inglewood, Palm Springs, and Oakland police departments.
<li>the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors, County of Los Angeles; Los 				Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite-Burke; and city council 			members of Laguna Beach, Anaheim, San Diego, Gilroy, Ventura, Modesto, 			Merced, Vallejo and Suisun.
<li>StreetSmart 76 was endorsed by the California Highway Patrol, California Police 		Chiefs Association, California Peace Officers' Association and National Highway 	Traffic Safety Administration.
<li>Pledge-signing weekends resulted in thousands of pledges from customers not to 	drink and drive, along with hundreds of appreciative comments. </ul></ol><p>

<H3>Situation Analysis:</H3>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>ea World San Diego was faced with increasing public debate about a new Hospitality Center and exhibits highlighting the rich history of its parent company, Anheuser-Busch.  In addition, because of laws governing the alcohol beverage industry, Sea World had to receive unique exemption from the California Legislature to apply for a license to serve distilled spirits to groups holding special events at the park.
<p>
The primary thrust of opposition was coming from vocal anti-alcohol activists in the San Diego area.
<p>
The challenges were to gain a share of voice in the public debate and to educate and neutralize community leaders.
<p>
<h3>Tactics.</h3>
Initial outreach was directed at elected officials and community leaders in the San Diego area.
<p>
One-on-one meetings as well as park tours were scheduled to explain the plans and to let community leaders see first-hand the positive improvements that Anheuser-Busch had made to the park.   Community leaders were encouraged to maintain direct communications with the park management on issues of concern.   Similar outreach was conducted with leaders in the education and alcohol awareness communities.
<p>
Nearly 1,000 community leaders were invited to a VIP grand-opening of the park's new "Shark Encounter" exhibit.
<p>
Additionally, editorial board meetings and appearances on local public affairs talk shows were scheduled.  A grass roots op-ed and letters-to-the-editor campaign was conducted to highlight the positive contributions that Sea World makes to San Diego's economy, as well as its educational and social institutions.
<p>
Sea World employees were kept informed of new developments so that they could serve as unofficial "ambassadors" to the greater San Diego community.
<p>
A "grass-tops" (community leaders) letter writing campaign was directed at state legislative representatives from the San Diego area encouraging them to grant exemption for the expanded alcohol beverage license.
<p>
<h3>Results.</h3>
Meetings were held with all members of the San Diego City Council, key members of the Board of Supervisors and other elected and appointed officials county-wide.  In each case, the outcome was positive support for the role that Sea World plays in San Diego.
<p>
Other meetings and park tours helped win support or neutralize leaders in the education and alcohol awareness communities.
<p>
Local opposition to the Hospitality Center and exhibits was neutralized.  Construction was completed on schedule.
<p>
The California Legislature passed the special exemption that allowed Sea World to apply for an expanded distilled spirits beverage license.  Application for the license has been granted.
<p>
Nelson Communications Group was retained to manage ongoing community/government relations efforts including coastal commission, environmental and animal rights issues.<p>

<P><H3>Situation.</H3>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n early 1996, Unocal's 76 Products Company, the refining and marketing arm of Unocal Corporation, was beginning to emerge as a viable, high-functioning, independent offshoot of the venerable parent company that had given it birth less than 18 months before.  But the year promised to be turbulent, with the move of more than 800 employees from eight buildings into a single high-rise in the heart of Orange County.  And the nature of the business was undergoing significant change -- from an old-style oil company to a modern "convenience retailer" focused on customer service.
<p>
Our challenge, as 76 Products Company's public relations agency, was to manage that change through effective communication and build a cohesive, positive, forward-looking image for the company.  We needed to raise awareness of the emerging corporate culture, one which emphasized innovation, operational excellence, and above all, customer service.  But we also needed to allay the fears of those stakeholders -- both internal and external -- who were suspicious of change. 
<p>
In essence, we needed to communicate the value of 76 Products Company to ensure its continued, profitable existence as an independent organization worthy of shareholder investment.
<p>
<H3>Strategy.</H3>
Our strategy was simple: to build a reputation for corporate leadership and category innovation through a constant flow of positive information to audiences.  Effectively implemented, we believed this would achieve our key objectives:  1) attract entrepreneurial dealers, marketers and franchisees as well as quality business partners;  2) attract and retain talented and skilled Associates with a similar vision;  3) attract consumers to Unocal 76 convenience centers; and  4) please shareholders.
<p>
<H3>Implementation.</H3>
After several planning meetings involving Unocal executives and agency representatives, Nelson Communications Group created a communications plan which graphically charted the complex interrelationships among different groups and showed the linkages among public relations programs -- specifically how each separate piece had a positive impact on departmental as well as corporate goals.  The chart was invaluable in getting buy-in from executives with very different objectives.
<p>
Our plan was built around four areas of focus with interrelating goals:  corporate image (both an area of focus and the collective result of public relations activities in all areas); dealer/marketer/franchise programs; community relations and internal communications.  No program was recommended without a full exploration of its impact on each of these areas of focus.
<p>
<h3>Tactics.</h3>
The following broad tactics were implemented during 1996:  1) develop and implement a multifaceted communications plan designed to inform, educate, and excite Associates about the move, and thus build pride and loyalty;  2) launch aggressive news media campaign touting the company's achievements, business partnerships, and successes, to convey the viability and potential of the company to stakeholders and investors;  3)  develop and implement a community safety awareness program under the brand name "StreetSmart 76," designed to build goodwill in the communities where the company does business, thereby smoothing the way for necessary permits as sites are revamped;  4)  develop and implement a cohesive and consistent dealer communications program to inspire operators to greater heights of efficiency and improved customer service;  5) publicize advertising initiatives to extend the message that Unocal 76 is customer-focused.
<p>
<h3>Results.</h3>
Associates received regular 76 in Motion newsletters to educate them about the most hassle-free commutes and inform them about corporate relocation policies.  They also appreciated informative e-mails, as well as specially packaged items including a duffel bag, T-shirt, mousepads, coffee mugs, and cents-off coupons for restaurants, services, and entertainment near the new headquarters. Associates and their families enjoyed an open house to welcome them to Costa Mesa.  Today, 555 Anton Boulevard is a bustling center of activity with Associates making a great deal of use of the on-site cafeteria ("The Filling Station") and health club facilities.
<p>
During the course of 1996, dozens of positive stories containing key messages -- included full-color, cover page spreads in the Los Angeles Times and the Orange County Register -- were printed throughout California and the West. Also, a corporate image ad in the Los Angeles Times was negotiated at very low cost.
<p>
Larry Higby, president of 76 Products Company, was named one of the "25 Hottest People in Orange County" by the O.C. Metro magazine. The article cited his innovative leadership and the company's new "cutting edge" direction as major factors. 
<p>
StreetSmart 76 was a resounding success.  The program received the support of the California Highway Patrol, California Police Chiefs Association, and California Peace Officers Association, as well as numerous city council members and law enforcement groups.  Hundreds of customers signed pledges not to drink and drive during pledge weekends.  Posters, brochures, stickers, and decals spread the safety message.  StreetSmart 76's Halloween program, focusing on safety for kids, also received great praise.  The cumulative effect of StreetSmart 76 has been better community relationships and the development of positive feelings about StreetSmart 76 among key local influencers.
<p>
Dealers received a modernized Spirit of 76 publication, regular e-mails and promotional mailings.  They also were exposed to frequent articles about Unocal in trade publications, including Convenience Store Decisions and National Petroleum News.
<p>
Publicity in support of the "We get it" advertising campaign resulted in 20 print articles and six broadcast news stories for a total of 6.1 million impressions.
<p>
The agency also successfully mitigated negative publicity when gasoline "price hikes" were constantly in the news and reformulated gasoline was introduced.<p>

<P><H3>Situation.</H3><FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n December 1995, Health Net, California's second largest health maintenance organization, was facing both daunting challenges as well as enormous opportunity.  A highly publicized failed merger and a series of negative publicity directed at Health Net and HMO's provided a sales and marketing challenge for the company.
<p>
The perception existed that the company had suffered an exit of management, declining productivity and quality of service.  Key audiences had received minimal information and both mixed and inconsistent messages concerning the future direction of the company.
<p>
Nelson Communications Group (NCG) developed a 1996 corporate communications plan for the California market to reposition Health Net  in the marketplace and provide clear, consistent communications to all key audiences.  Key objectives for the plan included: (1) setting the tone for Health Net as a responsive, quality service organization; (2) coordinating the efforts of sales and marketing to develop a long-range strategic vision for the company; (3) "buying in" employer groups and members to the future strategy; (4) educating employees on the steps being taken by the company to reposition itself and utilize employees as advocates; and (5) anticipating and dispelling competitors rumors/myths and quelling negative publicity.
<p>
<h3>Tactics.</h3>
NCG implemented a series of regional presentations to each of Health Net's 11 sales teams outlining the goals of the corporate communications program, receiving input and buy in from those working on the front lines.  The presentations served to reinforce management's commitment to include broad participation in the process, and also to coordinate the efforts of sales and marketing in repositioning the company.
<p>
NCG established a program for statewide educational forums to meet with Health Net's most valuable audiences, including brokers and consultants.  The forums reestablished open lines of communication and dispelled rumors or myths perpetuating from the merger and negative media coverage.
<p>
Key messages and selling points were developed based on member satisfaction research and input received from regional presentations.  The messages will be used in the development of a long-range, strategic vision for Health Net.
<p>
Based on the presentations and input, a wide range of collateral materials, including a new corporate capabilities brochure, were produced to provide both sales staff and provider groups with the tools to educate potential clients and existing members.    
<p>
NCG provided media consultation and recommendations to Health Net regarding media coverage on the merger and HMO-related issues.
<p>
Throughout 1996, tactics for educating and communicating with key audiences will be employed, including broker forums introducing health care underwriters to Health Net's management team and ongoing public and media relations activities aimed at minimizing the effects on Health Net of negative HMO coverage.
<p>
<h3>Results.</h3>
With the failed merger and negative publicity having placed a heavy strain on Health Net's internal culture, not to mention overall image in the marketplace, the company has begun to heal itself from the inside out.  The development of a long-range communications plan and an emphasis on management's open and cooperative efforts with regional offices and sales staff has refocused attention on the future of the company.  Sales and marketing staff are working together in the development of a long-range vision for the company.
<p>
Regional support for the efforts has been strong and a successful foundation has been laid for favorably repositioning Health Net and its image amidst a competitive marketplace in 1996.

Southern Pacific Transportation Company
</H2>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Dunsmuir Derailment</H3>

<H4>Situation:</H4>

<P>
In July of 1991, a Southern Pacific railroad car derailed near
Dunsmuir, California, spilling thousands of gallons of toxic metam
sodium into a pristine stretch of the Sacramento River long esteemed
by tourists and fishing enthusiasts alike.  Faced with a relentless
barrage of negative media coverage and a devastated community,
Southern Pacific (SP) retained Nelson &amp; Lucas Communications
to provide crisis management services to respond effectively not
only to media, but to key public officials as well.

<H4>Goal:</H4>

<P>
Educate members of the media, key decision-makers, and public
officials as to the tremendous clean-up efforts instigated and
financed by SP, along with the company's efforts to restore the
community's economy by bringing tourists back to the region. 
Reinforce SP's role as a major California corporation, providing
jobs to thousands of Californians at sites throughout the state.
</P>

<H4>Tactics:</H4>

<P>
Assisted Southern Pacific public relations staff with the coordination
of a tour aboard an historic SP train through the spill area --
developed media target lists; invited members of the Administration,
transportation officials, and legislators and followed-up with
phone calls to encourage attendance; served as spokespersons to
key officials and members of the media whenever appropriate before,
during, and after the event; assisted with media interviews and
news conferences; assisted with the preparation and distribution
of news releases and media briefing packets, etc. 
</P>

<P>
Distributed a series of fact sheets and news releases on the
spill and the progress of the clean-up to the Governor, members
of the Administration, members of the California Transportation
Commission, members of the California Public Utilities Commission,
and the Legislature.  Served as a Sacramento contact for these
officials for questions regarding the spill and clean-up.
</P>

<P>
Educated members of the Capitol Press Corps (reporters who cover
the Capitol for newspapers statewide) on the spill and Southern
Pacific's role in cleaning it up and bringing tourism back to
the area.  Coordinated interviews with SP representatives whenever
appropriate.
</P>

<P>
Prepared testimony for a top SP official appearing before a Congressional
hearing on the spill.  Facilitated meetings for SP representatives
with key state and federal officials, providing talking points
whenever necessary, etc.
</P>

<P>
Organized a news conference on the one-year anniversary of the
spill to mitigate negative news coverage and draw attention instead
to the positive efforts SP had undertaken to clean up the river
and restore tourism, and the very tangible results of their pro-active
campaign.
</P>

<P>
Coordinated a reception hosted by SP in the rotunda of the State
Capitol for legislators and key transportation officials.  Secured
the attendance of major decision-makers and thus the opportunity
for SP officials to meet with these officials on an informal basis.
Developed and distributed two information kits on SP (one of
which included information on the spill and clean-up efforts)--
one to reception attendees, and one two weeks later to a larger
decision-maker target list.
</P>

<P>
Publicized SP's recent position that the Sacramento River --
now completely restored -- should be reopened to fishing.
</P>

<H4>Results:</H4>

<P>
Successfully gained coverage of the train tour and one-year anniversary
news conference by media statewide.  The majority of the coverage
pointed to SP's success story.
</P>

<P>
Enhanced working relationships with both members of the media
and public officials.

<H3>Situation Analysis:</H3>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>n Saturday, January 18, 1992, an article about Peggy Maley, a PacifiCare member and victim of breast cancer, appeared in the Chino Daily Bulletin.  Peggy had been told that PacifiCare would not pay for a bone marrow transplant to treat her condition, since this procedure is regarded as experimental for breast cancer and is therefore not covered by the plan.
<p>
A few days later, the local television station, KTTV, picked up the story.  Then PacifiCare got a call from Sam Donaldson, who was planning to interview Peggy Maley as part of a report on health insurance for "Prime Time Live," a national network show.
<p>
At 10:00 p.m. on January 29, 1992, the vice president for corporate communications for PacifiCare Health Systems called her Nelson Communications Group account manager at home.  By noon the following day, she had received a detailed document giving her a step-by-step approach to dealing with this crisis.
<p>
<h3>Goals.</h3>
Prepare Pacificare spokespersons for interview with Sam Donaldson, build a case which supported the organization's approach to the Maley case.
<p>
<h3>Tactics.</h3>
Nelson Communications offered counsel based on five strategies: (1) gather the facts; (2) hold a crisis team meeting and develop an official statement and question and answer document;  (3) identify spokespeople and  media-train them; (4) determine which audiences to alert to the possibility of the show airing; and (5) determine follow-up if the segment airs.
<p>
The chief executive officer, chief operating officer and medical director of PacifiCare Health Systems were media-trained and briefed on the Q & A document.  When Sam Donaldson interviewed them, they were ready for his questions.
<p>
<h3>Results.</h3>
The extensive preparation clearly paid off.  Sam Donaldson did not air PacifiCare's interview.
<p>
Clearly, the reasoned answers of the PacifiCare senior team were not suitable for the show.  Instead, two other insurance companies were featured.
<p>
PacifiCare also settled with Peggy Maley, and she received the transplant despite its experimental nature.
<p>
Nelson Communications advised follow-up action so that a similar situation did not occur again; for example, that a form letter not be used in advising a patient with a life-threatening disease that a certain type of treatment has been denied.
<p>
Alan Hoops, COO, told the vice president of corporate communications that the Q&A documents were  an excellent and extremely useful tool for the company in a time of crisis.

<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n 1993, Assembly Bill 1853, authored by Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), was specifically developed from recommendations on regulatory reform made by the Governor's Council on California Competitiveness to bring budgetary oversight to the massive South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD).  AB 1853 mandates that local AQMDs with budgets in excess of $500,000 (only the SCAQMD qualifies) be included in the budget of the California Environmental Protection Agency to be funded through the state's budgeting process.
<p>
As a major supporter of the bill, ARCO hired Nelson Communications Group (NCG) to help ensure the bill's success by generating widespread vocal grass roots support for the bill.
<p>
<h3>Strategy.</h3>
To recruit and organize a large coalition of supporters willing to actively demonstrate the need for AB 1853, while controlling media coverage of the issue to ensure it is not portrayed as an effort by any company(ies) to diminish the region's air quality goals.
<p>
<h3>Tactics.</h3>
NCG developed background materials for use in coalition building and endorsement gathering activities, legislative testimony, and media outreach.  The agency coordinated district office visits, letter writing campaigns, and phone bank efforts with coalition members, targeting key legislative committee members throughout the legislative session.
<p>
NCG worked closely with Assemblyman Polanco and key staffers to devise successful strategy, tactics, and messages for use by the coalition, and assisted the Assemblyman's office in managing media interest and coverage.  Support was solicited from a diverse collection of trade associations and businesses.
<p>
<h3>Results.</h3>
Nearly 60 statewide and regional business organizations, taxpayer groups, and individuals were recruited as active coalition members.  NCG wrote and placed an opinion-editorial authored by Assemblyman Polanco in the Long Beach Business Journal prior to major committee hearings.
<p>
Coalition members attended and testified at every legislative committee hearing to demonstrate support for the bill, and coalition efforts were responsible for winning several crucial votes throughout the bill's successful passage.<p>

<FONT SIZE="+2">B</FONT>eer Drinkers of America (BDA) is a nine-year-old national grass roots advocacy and education organization representing more than 800,000 beer consumers.  Nelson Communications Group provides management and consulting services to the organization in the following areas:  grass roots political advocacy; public education; and public relations.
<p>
<h3>Strategy.</h3>
Nelson Communications Group (NCG) has developed and implemented a successful grass roots alert program using direct mail and telemarketing to produce thousands of letters, postcards and phone calls to Congress and state legislatures from BDA supporters and members.     NCG manages extensive national direct mail campaigns to recruit members and supporters for BDA.  In January 1989, nearly five million pieces of targeted direct mail were sent to new prospects.
<p>
The agency  has developed and manages a comprehensive public education program, "Party Smart," to encourage responsible and moderate consumption by those who choose to drink alcohol.  The program includes:  official alcohol education programs at major spring break cities; designated driver and fan alcohol awareness programs at major sports stadiums; public appearances; press releases; editorials; scholarly research articles; brochures and other collateral material; and newsletters.  The program has been used by more than 1,000 colleges, universities, and law enforcement agencies, several Major League baseball teams, National Football League teams, at the Kentucky Derby, at Daytona Beach, Fla., South Padre Island, Texas and Palm Springs, Calif. during spring break, and by the U.S. Jaycees.
<p>
Nelson Communications writes, produces and distributes a 4-6 page, award-winning newsletter sent to BDA's dues-paying members, Members of Congress, state legislators and selected members of the media.
<p>
NCG has developed and implemented a comprehensive, award-winning public relations program including:  media relations; satellite television media tours; press kits; position papers; press releases; feature stories; editorials; public service announcements (PSA); radio tours; radio actualities; press events; and crisis communication and damage control plan.<p>
<h3>Tactics.</h3>
Since 1988, Nelson Communications has generated thousands of articles about BDA and its Party Smart Education Project in newspapers and periodicals.  These publications include The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Time Magazine and Newsweek.
<p>
Nelson Communications has also generated more than 500 television stories viewed by hundreds of millions of people.  Television programs that have aired stories about BDA and Party Smart include Entertainment Tonight and Entertainment This Week, ABC World News Tonight, CNN News, The Today Show, ABC World News This Morning, CBS This Morning, and MTV.
<p>
Radio stations have aired more than 500 interviews and stories about BDA and Party Smart.

Prior to and during each of these programs, Nelson Communications has conducted opinion research among supporters and the general public including:  regional focus groups, national and segmented telephone surveys; and mall-intercept advertising tests.
<h3>Results.</h3>
Nearly 60 statewide and regional business organizations, taxpayer groups, and individuals were recruited as active coalition members.  NCG wrote and placed an opinion-editorial authored by Assemblyman Polanco in the Long Beach Business Journal prior to major committee hearings.
<p>
Coalition members attended and testified at every legislative committee hearing to demonstrate support for the bill, and coalition efforts were responsible for winning several crucial votes throughout the bill's successful passage.

<FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>hapman University offers continuing education (graduate, post-graduate and certification programs) at more than 35 Academic Centers throughout the United States and the Pacific Rim.  The university's Orange County campus has a reputation for excellence in liberal arts education.  However, its academic centers were not well-known in regional markets.  Marketing campaigns lacked cohesion and consistency.  Little communication existed among center directors and faculty at the main campus.
<p>
<h3>Goals.</h3>
To increase internal communication and increase awareness about the Academic Centers in regional markets.
<p>
<h3>Tactics.</h3>
After completing an in-depth research project, Nelson Communications implemented a comprehensive marketing plan.  To improve internal communications, NCG designed a quarterly eight-page newsletter to inform center directors about available resources, share ideas, encourage professional growth and improve morale; planned a tailored marketing and public relations campaign for academic center directors to announce the Chapman name change from college to university; and planned and implemented a four-day conference, during which center directors were trained to implement cost-effective public relations techniques in their marketplace.
<p>
To increase awareness of the Centers, a new logo to attract students  from their target markets was designed, collateral items to reflect a consistent graphic image were created, and undergraduate and graduate program brochures that outline program requirements and opportunities were also created.
<p>
An advertising component to the marketing campaign was implemented consisting of several ads that were adaptable to a variety of markets, both civilian and military, and a video that positioned Chapman Academic Centers as a leader in international continuing education programs.
<p>
NCG also developed and presented timely marketing plans for the Academic Centers on a regular basis.  These plans were designed to maximize marketing opportunities based on the academic environment.
<p>
<h3>Results.</h3>
For the first time in more than 30 years, center directors were provided with the tools to market their programs.  Morale improved tremendously with the publication of the newsletter and the networking opportunities afforded by the conference.  In 1991, Chapman Academic Centers predicted their recruitment would grow to more than 5,000 students as a result of the improved marketing techniques.

<h3>Weekend Events Raise Nearly $500,000 for Reeve-Irvine Research Center at UCI</h3>

IRVINE, Calif. - In two related weekend events featuring widely diverse
activities -from Robin Williams joking with Joan Rivers to an award ceremony
for a pioneering neuroscientist - nearly $500,000 in gross revenues was
raised to help establish the Reeve-Irvine Research Center for spinal cord
injury at the University of California, Irvine College of Medicine.<p>

On Saturday, more than 550 invited guests gathered at Mission San Juan
Capistrano for "An Evening Under the Stars," a night of music, auctions and
impassioned calls for accelerated research leading to new treatments and
cures for spinal cord injury.  On Sunday, several hundred guests and
spectators attended The Oaks International, a world-class equestrian
competition at The Oaks Rancho Mission Viejo Riding Park, also in San Juan
Capistrano.<p>

Both events were hosted by Christopher and Dana Reeve and philanthropist
Joan Irvine Smith.  Proceeds will benefit the Reeve-Irvine Research Center at
the UCI College of Medicine.  The center will result from the inspired
collaboration between Reeve and Smith, working in conjunction with UCI and
the American Paralysis Association.<p>

"It is gratifying to witness such tremendous support for a project as
vital as the Reeve-Irvine Research Center," UCI Chancellor Laurel Wilkening
said. Wilkening, one of the weekend's keynote speakers, called the success of
the events "a testament to the power of volunteerism at its compassionate
best."<p>

The initial fund-raising goal is $3 million, which will fund the
establishment of the center.  Smith, who hasa long history of generous
support to UCI, has pledged $1 million.  Her pledge - made through the Joan
Irvine Smith and Athalie R.  Clarke Foundation - is contingent on UCI raising
the additional $2 million.  Proceeds from the weekend events will be applied
toward that figure.<p>

The center will be the product of Smith's resolve to team with Reeve in an
effort to find a cure for spinal cord injuries.  UCI's standing as one of the
nation's leading research universities in the field of neuroscience makes it
a logical location for the Reeve-Irvine Research Center.  Also, the UCI
Medical Center is equipped with state-of-the-art neurosciences equipment,
setting the stage for exciting synergism among researchers and physicians.<p>

In one of the weekend's dramatic highlights, Reeve on Sunday presented
Swiss neuroscientist Dr.  Martin E.  Schwab with the first-ever Christopher
Reeve Research Medal.  Schwab received the medal - along with a $50,000 prize
- in recognition of his pioneering work in nerve regeneration and the
development of possible therapies for spinal cord injuries like Reeve's.<p>

In other highlights:<p>

Trent McGee, a 9-year-old quadriplegic from Irvine, fulfilled a dream
Saturday night by meeting the man who played Superman.  In a touching moment,
Trent, who turns10 on Sept.  21, and Reeve compared notes on how they cope
with and treat their disabling injuries.  More than $55,000 was raised during
a live auction that featured TV personality Gordon Jump as auctioneer.  Jump
rose to the occasion, encouraging audience members to open their hearts and
pocketbooks and bid.  Auction items ranged from dinner catered by Creme de la
Creme and served by members of the Irvine family, to a gray kitten belonging
to actress Jane Seymour; the successful bidder also received a year's supply
of cat food from Purina.  Meanwhile, a silent auction featuring items ranging
from a chrome bathroom faucet by KWC of Switzerland to "Society Editor for
the Night," courtesy of the Orange County Register, raised more than $33,500.
The Oaks International awarded prizes exceeding $150,000,making it one of the
richest horse show spectaculars inthe country, according to Smith, an
equestrian enthusiast who hosted the event.  Over the course of five days,
The Oaks International featured numerous levels of competition, culminating
in The $50,000 Oaks International Grand Prix on Sunday afternoon.  In a show
of support, several of Reeve's celebrity friends attended the events.  They
included Robin Williams, Joan Rivers, Jane Seymour, Lea Thompson, Ted Danson
and Mary Steenbergen.  Williams, who told reporters that one of his current
goals is to make his friend laugh, arrived early Saturday night to be on hand
the moment Reeve arrived.<p>

Gov. Pete Wilson's Call to Action Conference for Women

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>elson Communications Group (NCG) was retained to provide media relations services for Gov. Pete Wilson's fourth annual Call to Action Conference for Women held Nov. 14, 1995 at the Long Beach Convention Center.  The conference, operated at no cost to the state, is funded through corporate donations and the $65 ticket price.  Objectives included developing a strategic media relations campaign that would expand coverage to national, state and regional broadcast, radio and print media (previous coverage had been limited to a half-dozen print articles and radio coverage in Los Angeles-based media); leverage conference speakers to generate positive publicity; highlight Gov. Wilson's participation; and troubleshoot for negative publicity.
<p>
Due to Gov. Wilson's candidacy for the Republican-presidential nomination and his much-publicized anti-affirmative action position, the conference became a target by the National Organization for Women (NOW).  NOW implemented a letter-writing campaign encouraging speakers to withdraw from the conference and ran a negative media relations campaign centering on a protest rally and news briefing at the conference.
<p>
<h3>Strategy.</h3>
Before the event, NCG drafted a letter on behalf of Julie Wright, California Secretary of Trade and Commerce, encouraging speakers to continue their support of the non-partisan conference.  A co-authored op-ed also was drafted on behalf of conference speakers Susan Estrich (democrat), national political analyst, and Mary Matalin (republican), co-anchor of CNBC's "Equal Time."  Selected text from the op-ed was printed in a Los Angeles Times article covering the controversy.
<p>
To minimize contact with NOW protesters and negative publicity on the day of the event, media were directed to enter the convention center through the "official" entrance at the rear.
<p>
Pitch letters and more than 300 press kits were forwarded to targeted media to help secure coverage.  Additionally, follow-up calls were made to each reporter to coordinate spokesperson interviews and determine interest in covering the conference.
<p>
A strong effort also was made to promote keynote speaker Marcia Clark in her first speaking engagement since the conclusion of the O.J. Simpson trial. Clark's name was leveraged in media materials and follow-up calls to the media.  A media advisory days before the event publicizing Clark's speech created strong interest.
<p>
A radio news release was prepared for distribution to California radio the day of the conference.  Sheila Halfon, director of a Los Angeles-based women's shelter and conference spokeswoman, was selected for the sound bite to discuss domestic violence because of the timeliness of the subject and obvious link to Clark's appearance.
<p>
<h3>Results.</h3>
A total of 116 reporters attended the conference from 56 media outlets.  Eighty-five broadcast and radio placements were secured from national, state and local media including CNN's Headline News and ABC's World News Tonight.  The radio news release also was broadcast 134 times on 93 stations for an estimated 905,000 impressions.
<p>
Pre-conference print coverage included 13 articles with circulation totals at 1,742,326.  Post-conference coverage included 33 articles with circulation totals of 3,768,853.  Total print coverage included circulation totals of 5,511,179 with each article referencing the women's conference and Gov. Wilson.
<p>
The protest effort had limited media coverage, overshadowed by Clark's keynote address.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT>uring the next three years, California
government agencies will
impose a series of rules to reduce locomotive emissions in the
state in compliance with the 1990 Clean Air Act.  Nelson Communications
Group conducted extensive research to identify key decision makers
in California and determine their perceptions of the railroad
industry and air quality in California. Following this research
phase, Nelson Communications Group created and implemented the
&quot;Train It&quot; campaign for the Association of American
Railroads.  
</P>

<H3>Goals.</H3>

<P>
The initial goal of the &quot;Train It&quot; communications campaign
was to educate California decision makers on the benefits of freight
rail transportation and demonstrate how the railroad industry
could be a part of the solution to California's environmental
and transportation challenges.  Ultimately, the goal of this educational
campaign was to positively impact the rule making processes and
prevent stringent regulations on the railroad industry. 

<H3>Tactics.</H3>

<UL>
<LI> Created a data base of the primary and secondary decision makers
throughout California.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Conducted focus groups and a telephone survey to identify environmental,
economic and transportation concerns of decision makers as well
as their attitudes towards the transportation industry.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Executed a direct mail program to key California decision makers.
The direct mail program consisted of reprints of opinion editorials
authored by California decision makers, media stories on the efficiency
and progression of the industry and letters from AAR on the technology
being developed by the industry.  Decision makers continue to
receive direct mail a minimum of once a quarter.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Mailed a desk piece train model demonstrating the benefits of
intermodal transportation (transporting truck trailers by train)
to decision makers along with a letter from AAR on the benefits
of intermodal transportation. 
<BR><BR>
<LI> Wrote and placed opinion editorials in  publications read by
decision makers.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Placed print and electronic &quot;Train It&quot; advertisements
in media targeted to decision makers.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Established a 1-800-USTRAIN line and advertised the number in
the &quot;Train It&quot; advertising campaign.  Callers receive
information on freight rail transportation and the industry's
efforts to reduce pollution and traffic congestion.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Developed an aggressive coalition building program to gain third
party support from the railroads' customers, environmental organizations
and business groups.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Developed white papers for AAR on the benefits of freight rail
and the industry's emission reduction technology.  These white
papers were used by the railroads to educate third party supporters,
customers and the media.
</UL>

<H3>Results.</H3>

<P>
NCG placed numerous opinion editorials signed by third-party
supporters and on an average of every six weeks, new editorials
and updated information is distributed to decision makers.
<P>
The train models were well-received by the decision makers with
AAR receiving numerous letters and phone calls in response and
the trains seen frequently on the decision makers desks.
<P>
During the peak of the advertising campaign, NCG handled more
than 200 calls per week to the 800-USTRAIN line, providing the
public and decision makers with educational materials on freight
rail transportation and establishing a database for future communications.
<P>
The railroads have identified and impacted key decision makers
and positioned itself as a solution to California's environmental
and transportation challenges.
<P>
The railroads are building a solid coalition of supporters who
have testified on behalf of the railroads in regulatory hearings
and other forums.  
<P>
Results of a follow-up telephone survey with decision makers
in March 1994 clearly indicated that the key messages (particularly
the benefits of intermodal transportation) were well received
by the decision makers. The survey also revealed a marked increase
in the awareness of the railroads' emissions reduction programs
with the majority of decision makers stating that they received
their information through mail or newspaper articles.
<P>
With the EPA's release of its draft Federal Implementation Plans
for California in February 1994, the proposed emission reductions
for railroads were fair and considerate of the efficiency of the
railroads.<p>

Federated had two primary goals for the transition of these San Diego Broadway Stores to Macy*s :   (1) to educate the public about the changes occurring at the eight locations and (2) to promote the unveiling of the Macy*s nameplate at three of the San Diego locations, highlighting the Fashion Valley location where the event and celebration took place.
<p>
Federated Department Stores hired Nelson Communications Group to develop and implement a strategic plan that would provide media coverage for the unveiling of the Fashion Valley location.
<p>
<h3>Tactics.</h3>
Nelson Communications Group (NCG) distributed press releases and media alerts to print and electronic media.
<p>
The agency secured the participation of two players from the San Diego Padres.  Macy*s presented the San Diego Padres Scholarship Foundation a check at the event to solidify its commitment to San Diego.  Photographs of the players and autographs were given to event participants and the general public.
<p>
A strong VIP guest list was developed, invitations were sent and follow-up phone calls were made to each invited guest.
<p>
<h3>Result.</h3>
A color photograph of the nameplate unveiling was featured on the front page of the business sections of the Los Angeles Times and the San Diego Union Tribune.  The San Diego Daily Transcript and San Diego Business Journal featured  stories on the event.
<p>
NCG secured television coverage on all major San Diego television stations resulting in 12 segments over a two day period.  Coverage on two major San Diego radio stations was also secured.
<p>
The agency secured Chief of Staff for Councilwoman Valerie Stallings to attend and participate in the event.

raised to help establish the Reeve-Irvine Research Center for spinal cord
injury at the University of California, Irvine College of Medicine.<p>

On Saturday, more than 550 invited guests gathered at Mission San Juan
Capistrano for "An Evening Under the Stars," a night of music, auctions and
impassioned calls for accelerated research leading to new treatments and
cures for spinal cord injury.  On Sunday, several hundred guests and
spectators attended The Oaks International, a world-class equestrian
competition at The Oaks Rancho Mission Viejo Riding Park, also in San Juan
Capistrano.<p>

Both events were hosted by Christopher and Dana Reeve and philanthropist
Joan Irvine Smith.  Proceeds will benefit the Reeve-Irvine Research Center at
the UCI College of Medicine.  The center will result from the inspired
collaboration between Reeve and Smith, working in conjunction with UCI and
the American Paralysis Association.<p>

"It is gratifying to witness such tremendous support for a project as
vital as the Reeve-Irvine Research Center," UCI Chancellor Laurel Wilkening
said. Wilkening, one of the weekend's keynote speakers, called the success of
the events "a testament to the power of volunteerism at its compassionate
best."<p>

The initial fund-raising goal is $3 million, which will fund the
establishment of the center.  Smith, who hasa long history of generous
support to UCI, has pledged $1 million.  Her pledge - made through the Joan
Irvine Smith and Athalie R.  Clarke Foundation - is contingent on UCI raising
the additional $2 million.  Proceeds from the weekend events will be applied
toward that figure.<p>

The center will be the product of Smith's resolve to team with Reeve in an
effort to find a cure for spinal cord injuries.  UCI's standing as one of the
nation's leading research universities in the field of neuroscience makes it
a logical location for the Reeve-Irvine Research Center.  Also, the UCI
Medical Center is equipped with state-of-the-art neurosciences equipment,
setting the stage for exciting synergism among researchers and physicians.<p>

In one of the weekend's dramatic highlights, Reeve on Sunday presented
Swiss neuroscientist Dr.  Martin E.  Schwab with the first-ever Christopher
Reeve Research Medal.  Schwab received the medal - along with a $50,000 prize
- in recognition of his pioneering work in nerve regeneration and the
development of possible therapies for spinal cord injuries like Reeve's.<p>

In other highlights:<p>

Trent McGee, a 9-year-old quadriplegic from Irvine, fulfilled a dream
Saturday night by meeting the man who played Superman.  In a touching moment,
Trent, who turns10 on Sept.  21, and Reeve compared notes on how they cope
with and treat their disabling injuries.  More than $55,000 was raised during
a live auction that featured TV personality Gordon Jump as auctioneer.  Jump
rose to the occasion, encouraging audience members to open their hearts and
pocketbooks and bid.  Auction items ranged from dinner catered by Creme de la
Creme and served by members of the Irvine family, to a gray kitten belonging
to actress Jane Seymour; the successful bidder also received a year's supply
of cat food from Purina.  Meanwhile, a silent auction featuring items ranging
from a chrome bathroom faucet by KWC of Switzerland to "Society Editor for
the Night," courtesy of the Orange County Register, raised more than $33,500.
The Oaks International awarded prizes exceeding $150,000,making it one of the
richest horse show spectaculars inthe country, according to Smith, an
equestrian enthusiast who hosted the event.  Over the course of five days,
The Oaks International featured numerous levels of competition, culminating
in The $50,000 Oaks International Grand Prix on Sunday afternoon.  In a show
of support, several of Reeve's celebrity friends attended the events.  They
included Robin Williams, Joan Rivers, Jane Seymour, Lea Thompson, Ted Danson
and Mary Steenbergen.  Williams, who told reporters that one of his current
goals is to make his friend laugh, arrived early Saturday night to be on hand
the moment Reeve arrived.<p>

LONG BEACH, Calif. -  Edging toward a planned February takeoff, low-fare startup air carrier CalJet Airlines Inc. announced it has lined up commitments from investment bankers to raise $25 million in critically needed financing.
<p>
At the same time, the company introduced a new chairman and CEO, 64-year old Hollis L. Harris, who has held similar positions with Air Canada, Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines.
<p>
The company has hovered in a holding pattern for more than a year while seeking startup financing.  Fridays announcement was the first indication in months that CalJet, originally called Shuttle America, might actually get off the ground.
<p>
City officials are counting heavily on CalJet for an economic boost.  It could help in reviving Long Beach Airport, which was abandoned by major airlines and where such recent startups as Presidential Air and Sterling One have floundered.
<p>
"Id like to introduce our new partner in a badly needed area," said Mayor Beverly ONeil in presenting the CalJet management team at a news conference Friday.
<p>
The city is not investing in CalJet, but it has lent the citys logo to be used on the tail of its planes.  CalJet is proposing to fly 20 regularly scheduled flights daily from Long Beach Airport to San Francisco, Las Vegas and Sacramento in February.  By spring, it would add flights to Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas.  In 1998, flights would be added to Houston.
<p>	
CalJets administration, reservations, training and maintenance would be headquartered in Long Beach.  It will employ 500 to 700 people.
<p>	
It estimated that passengers aboard each of its flights would bring $6 million a year in spending to the Long Beach area.
<p>	
The key to launching CalJet has been financing.
<p>	
Harris said the company has obtained commitments from Credit-Research & Trading, and Benedetto, Gartland & Greene Inc. to raise $25 million from five or six institutional investors.  He added that the financing is not yet assure, but given the track record of the two companies, he said he is confident the money will be raised.
<p>	
"Were pleased to have the City Councils support to go to Wall Street." said company co-founder and President George Chelius, 55.  "Our investment bankers like what they see."
<p>	
Harris and he said they were happy to see hints of an economic rebound in Long Beach, including the citys plans to build an aquarium to attract more tourists.
<p>	
City officials have been courting airlines in contrast to the recent past when protracted litigation over noise levels at the airport helped to chase off the major airlines.  Those lawsuits were settled last year.  Under the settlement, as many as 41 flights a day are allowed.
<p>	
CalJet obtained 20 of the 41 slots.  That would give it more daily flights at Long Beach Airport than any airline in history.  Like the existing airlines, Sun Jet and America West, CalJet would have to meet airport noise restrictions and fly between the hours of 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.
<p>
CalJet is planning to lease and fly McDonnell Douglas Corp.s Long Beach-made 140-seat MD-80 jets, four initially, two more by spring and another two by next year.  In addition, CalJet plans to fly four 50-seat Bombardier Canadair Regional Jets in a commuter service beginning in 1998.
<p>
Harris predicted company revenues of $150 million a year by the second year and net income of as much as $20 million.
<p>
He said the company would begin the costly, months-long process for federal regulatory approval within the next two weeks.

<center><b>ORANGE COUNTY ANNUAL SURVEY REVEALS CHALLENGES, OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATORS
<br>
Media Use Survey Finds Only 19 Percent of Orange County Residents 
Follow Local Government, Local Community News</b></center>
<p>
IRVINE, Calif.  Despite the recent Orange County bankruptcy, relatively few county residents today say they closely follow local government news (19 percent) or local community news (18 percent), while more say they are highly attentive to Washington news (35 percent).
<p>
These and other findings were released today as part of the Media Use Survey from the 1996 Orange County Annual Survey.  Results of the ten question Media Use Survey were released today by Nelson Communications Group and Mark Baldassare, co-director of the Orange County Annual Survey and professor and chair of urban and regional planning at UCI. 
<p>
Nelson Communications Group, a well respected public relations firm with offices in Irvine, San Diego and Sacramento, sponsored the ten Media Use Survey questions in the 1996 survey.
<p>
Said Baldassare, "Given that our last survey revealed 73 percent of county residents felt the bankruptcy adversely affected their lives, we were surprised to find less than one in five county residents say they are following local government and community news.  Under the circumstances, we expected that number to be considerably higher."
<p>
"The survey confirms that a small group of opinion leaders closely follow local news," said Larry Tenney, managing partner of Nelson Communications Groups Irvine office.  "A one-day story in the newspaper is likely to reach a relatively small but influential readership.  If the communications objective is to extend a story to the general public, other vehicles and tactics must be employed."
<p>
The most obvious vehicle for reaching a broader audience is television.  Consistent with national trends, the survey revealed that Orange County residents are growing more reliant on television as a source of news.  Eighty percent of residents regularly watch television news, while only 73 percent regularly read a daily newspaper and just 55 percent regularly listen to radio news.
<p>
The survey also showed that Orange County residents are more likely to get world news
from television than from newspapers (45 percent versus 31 percent).  Results revealed that,
by a three to one margin (60 percent to 21 percent) residents choose to get local news from newspapers over television. Compared to a decade ago, 12 percent fewer people today look to newspapers for world news and 14 percent fewer people look to newspapers for Orange County news.  Television has been the single largest beneficiary of these declines but radio and Internet sources have also posted audience gains at the expense of print.
<p>
"A persistent demographic gap is evident in the data," explained Tenney.  "As you would expect, better educated, higher income residents are more likely to read the paper.  For communicators dealing with high concept issues, products and services, it would be a mistake to glance at this data and write off print."
<p>
However, the expanding influence of television poses interesting challenges, particularly for professional communicators practicing in Orange County.  "Because Orange County is not a stand alone media market we have to rely on Los Angeles based broadcast," said Tenney.  "The challenge for PR pros is to give a story enough legs to make it to L.A. and back.  Successful pitches will piggyback onto national and regional news and trends.  Moreover, we have to be bold and imaginative in creating visual images that get past assignment desk clutter."
<p>	
Successful Orange County practitioners also must strive to fill news holes by taking on some of the burdens of production.  According to Tenney, "News budgets have shrunk and crews can be scarce -- particularly for events taking place 50 miles away.  However, with the rapid 
proliferation of outlets -- a trend that promises to continue -- the appetite for content has exploded.   Accordingly, there are numerous opportunities for savvy PR pros who can package news in a TV friendly manner.  Video news releases and satellite media tours are two bats with which you can hit home runs.  Anyone who tells you VNRs dont work doesnt know how to use them." 
<p>
Other results from the Media Use Survey include:
<UL>
<LI>
Fully one third of county residents believe there is a Democratic bias in news coverage of the presidential election, while nine percent say there is a Republican bias.  Forty-four percent say there is no bias at all and 15 percent said they are unsure.  These findings reveal that Orange County residents are more likely than the rest of the nation to believe the media favors Democrats in presidential election coverage.
<LI>
Two in three respondents said keeping fully informed about the news is a very important obligation, while nearly all respondents said staying informed is at least somewhat important (97 percent).  Interestingly, compared to a decade ago, the new results indicate that fewer people today believe staying fully informed is very important.
<LI>
Only three percent of survey respondents said they use the Internet as a source of news, up from zero percent a decade ago.  Said Tenney, "Ten years ago you couldnt find three people who had a clue about the Internet.  Today, Internet awareness is almost absolute and usage is expanding rapidly.  In the next five years the number of people getting news and other information from the net is going to swell like a water balloon hooked up to a fire hydrant. </UL>
If you are a communications professional and you are not actively exploring the potential of the Internet, your future is about as promising as Boris Yeltsins."
<P>
The random telephone survey of 1,000 adult Orange County residents was conducted Aug. 30 through Sept. 8, 1996.  The response rate for the survey was 68 percent.  The sampling error for the survey is plus or minus three percent at the 95 percent confidence level.
<P>
The Orange County Annual Survey, now in its fifteenth year, is supported by donations from Orange County corporations, public agencies and foundations.  Complete results of the 1996 survey will be released in early December.

In an announcement that is sure to please shoppers everywhere, Macys Department Stores will open at least 50 new stores in California.  The new stores will offer customers the same high-quality items and service found at current Macys locations.  The expansion is a result of Macys recent purchase of the Broadway Stores chain, and will provide a much needed facelift to these old locations. 
<p>
"Macys is committed to making a long-term investment in California," said Macys West Chairman and CEO Michael Steinberg.  "The Macys name means more fashion, more convenience and better value for the customer as well as the on-going commitment to the communities we serve."
<p>
Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., Macys parent company, will invest $600 million in California over the next two years through this conversion process.  All converted stores will be operated under the Macys and Bloomingdales nameplates.  The investment strengthens and stimulates the retail sales environment in California for years to come by preserving the quality and diversity of consumer options in many communities where major stores otherwise might have closed.
<p>
The other exciting news was the announcement of plans to open Californias first Bloomingdales stores in four locations: Newport Beach Fashion Island, Century City Shopping Center, Stanford Shopping Center and the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square.  These are the first stores west of the Rockies for the 18-store chain, which is famed for its glitzy Manhattan flagship operation.
<p>
Macys features designer names and top national brands in the customer-designated highlight shops.  In addition, the stores offer high-quality and reasonably priced merchandise exclusive to Macys.  Macys bring its own brands -- Alfani, Charter Club Room, International Concepts (I.N.C.), and Tools of the Trade -- to all its locations. 
<p>
Macys West is a division of Federated Department Stores, Inc.  With corporate offices in Cincinnati and New York, Federated is one of the nations leading department store retailers, with annual sales of more than $15 billion.  Federated currently operates more than 400 department stores and 150 specialty stores in 36 states.

On November 1, 1996, Pacific Bell Mobile Services (PBMS) launched its long anticipated Personal Communications System (PCS 1900) in the San Diego market.  A state-of-the-art digital wireless phone which provides paging and voice mail capabilities, the PCS technology is anticipated to revolutionize the field of wireless communications.  
<p>
But it almost didnt happen.  
<p>
Plans to debut PCS 1900 throughout California were challenged by industry competitors in an attempt to delay PBMS's market introduction.  Opponents launched a San Diego campaign with statewide implications utilizing influential senior and disabled citizens organizations.  The opposition capitalized on reports from Europe that similar telephones caused a painful buzz in the ears of hearing aid wearers, disabled the brakes on electric wheelchairs and caused pacemakers to send irregular signals to the heart.  These specters were raised as causes to postpone San Diego City Councils decision on 12 PCS 1900 antenna sites and to delay PBMS from coming to market with its new wireless, digital product.
<p>
The immediate hurdles facing Pacific Bell were numerous:
<ul>
<li>The opposition, the Wireless Communications Council and Hear-It Now! from Washington, D.C., had launched a high profile state and national media campaign, placing numerous articles and full-page ads in trade publications and daily newspapers alerting readers to health issues associated with PCS 1900.  The head of the opposition was a major stockholder in one of PBMS's fiercest market competitors, and this competitor was not yet ready to come to market with a competing technology.
<li>The Wireless Communications Council and Hear-It Now! produced a nationally-distributed video and case study showing and describing negative effects of the PCS 1900 handset on a hearing aid wearer in Washington, D.C.
<li>The Wireless Communications Council and Hear-It Now! created and funded a local organization, the California Communications Council, to lead the effort against PCS 1900 in California.  The California Communications Council was successful in securing support from the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), Self Help for Hard of Hearing Persons (SHHH), the Gray Panthers and the California Nurses' Association
<li>The specters of hearing aid, pacemaker and electric wheelchair interference were raised by seemingly credible sources and seen by many as legitimate reasons to prevent PCS 1900 from being introduced.</ul>
	<p>
The ability of Pacific Bell to overcome these challenges would spell the fate of the introduction of the PCS 1900 system throughout California.  For the tide to turn and for approval to be granted by the San Diego City Council, the following steps were critical:
<ul>
<li>Educating council members and target audiences on the actual effects of the technology.
<li>Securing endorsements of the technology from key organizations and individuals.
<li>Mobilizing support from hard of hearing groups, the elderly and disabled community, special interest and community groups, selected media and key organizations.
<li>Demonstrating the superior technology developed by PBMS.
</ul>
<p>
Pacific Bell mounted a two-month campaign with the goal of receiving city council approval of 12 PCS 1900 antenna sites throughout San Diego, paving the way for San Jose and San Francisco to follow.  The objective was to create an environment of intense support for PCS 1900 and PBMS by demystifying the interference issue and educating audiences, including the city council members, on the very complex and technical issues presented.  
<p>
The strategy worked: The sites were approved 5-3 by the City of San Diego. Subsequently, the San Jose and San Francisco city councils approved PCS 1900 sites.
<p>
For the attention given to the needs of the hard of hearing during the PCS 1900 campaign, PBMS was presented with the 1996 National Access Award.  This is the top award given by SHHH--the lead organization opposing PCS 1900 prior to the initiation of the communications program.

<center><b>Harris to Head CalJet Airlines<br>
New Long Beach Based Airline to Begin Service in 1997</b></center>
<p>


	LONG BEACH, Calif. (November 1, 1996) -- CalJet Airlines, the newly formed Long Beach based commercial air carrier with plans to begin passenger service in February 1997, officially announced today that Hollis Harris will serve as Chairman and CEO.
<p>
	Harris most recently served as Chairman, President and CEO of Air Canada.  During his 42 years of commercial aviation experience, he has also served as Chairman, President and CEO of Continental Airlines and President and Chief Operating Officer of Delta Air Lines. 
<p>
	"Hollis Harris is among the most respected airline executives in the world," said George Chelius, President and co-founder of CalJet.  "His experience, knowledge and drive are a perfect match for CalJet.  Our mission is to provide the flying public with safe, reliable and affordable air travel of the highest quality.  Harris is the right man to help us achieve that goal."  
<p>
	"The management team CalJet has assembled has more than 200 years of commercial aviation experience and I am honored to lead this crew," Harris said.
<p>
	In addition to Harris, CalJets management team includes members of the original Jet America, including its co-founder George Chelius.  During the 1980s Jet America served Chicago and Dallas with six daily flights from the Long Beach Airport.   Jet America operated at a profit and maintained a perfect safety record before being purchased by Alaska Airlines in 1987.
<p>
	CalJet will initially operate a fleet of four modern McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft.  The carrier plans to begin passenger service from Long Beach to San Francisco, Sacramento and Las Vegas in early 1997.  Plans are also in place to add service, later in the year, to Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas.  Additional aircraft, including MD-80s and Bombardier Canadair Regional Jets, will be added as service expands.  
<p>
	Long Beach Airport is equidistant from airports in Los Angeles and Orange County and is served by six major freeways.   It is the most convenient airport for approximately six million southern California residents.
<p>
	"LAX and John Wayne are virtually at capacity," said Chelius.  "With Jet America we successfully demonstrated that this market will support a first quality, affordable airline in Long Beach.  CalJet is, in many ways, a re-start of Jet America.  We are confident people will come to know, trust and appreciate CalJet service."

<p>
	CalJet will be entirely based in Long Beach including its corporate headquarters and its operations, training, maintenance and reservations facilities.  In its first year the company is expected to directly create 500 - 700 new jobs.  CalJets presence in Long Beach will also generate a need for an estimated 2,000 additional support jobs in the local community.
<p>
	"We are thrilled by CalJets commitment to the city," said Long Beach Mayor Beverly ONeill.  "CalJet will play a major role in our current economic development program.  The City is doing everything in its power to encourage and support CalJets success."

<b>Who needs another airline?</b><br>
The traveling public continues to support low fare airlines, such as Southwest, Reno Air, America West, etc.  There are no low fare East to West air carriers in the Long Beach market. 
<p>

<b>Why Long Beach and why now?</b><br>
The Long Beach market has already been proven.  Located half way between Orange County Airport (flight limited) and LAX (congested) the City of Long Beach has embraced a new approach by providing sufficient slots and substantial support to allow a new entrant and "hometown" airline the opportunity to be a success.  The airport will draw from a population base of over six million people and is served by six freeways which makes Long Beach Airport the most convenient airport in Southern California.  The overall airline industry is reflecting strong earnings and reasonable profits.
<p>


<b>Why did Jet America sell its business?</b><br>
Jet America was acquired by Alaska Airlines in a competitive tender offer with Delta Airlines.  Jet America had valuable assets at slot controlled airports, a favorable fleet composition of MD-80s and a more productive work force.  To contest the tender offer would have been costly and may have reduced return to the shareholders.
<p>


<b>What keeps the majors from coming back?</b><br>
The reasons are four fold: 
<ul>
<li>CalJet has been awarded 20 of the 41 available Air Carrier slots and all twenty-five Commuter Carrier slots.  This will limit the competitive frequencies at Long Beach.
<li>Where possible, CalJet will not operate into airports or hubs in direct competition with the major carriers, but rather it will serve inner-city/satellite airports and airports of communities surrounding mega metropolises.
<li>The majors, who abandoned Long Beach after Jet America no longer operated, are now protecting their interests at nearby LAX and Orange County airports and if slots were to become available would have to consider very seriously servicing an airport where they would compete with themselves.
<li>Should a major attempt to reenter this market, they would have to consider anti-trust implications for their acts.</ul>
<p>


<b>What happens if there is major competition on CalJets core routes during the first two years of operation?</b><br>
The original Jet America had to face competition on its core routes of Chicago and Dallas by United and American within the first year of operations.  Historically, year in and year out, Jet America was able to out perform these competitors because of its focused marketing and superior service.  CalJet will enjoy airport dominance in addition to focused marketing and exceptional value.
<p>


<b>Where will CalJet derive its authority to operate?</b><br>
In order for CalJet to operate as an airline it must obtain from the Department of Transportation a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (Form 401) as well as a FAR Part 121 Certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration.
<p>


<b>Where will CalJet get its aircraft?</b><br>
The MD-80 aircraft will be purchased for lease or leased on the open market with the assistance of Douglas Aircraft Company. The regional jets will be purchased new from Bombardier.

<p>

<b>Where will CalJet get a hangar and office space?</b><br>
It is intended that the same facilities, occupied by the original Jet America, be used again.  The land is owned by the City of Long Beach and the structure is owned by Douglas Aircraft Company.  The business transaction is intended to be a long-term lease.

<p>

<b>Why these routes?</b><br>
Long Beach-Chicago, Dallas and Las Vegas were the core cities of the original Jet America.  Long Beach - San Francisco was chosen because PSA served this city with great success in the 1970s and 80s.  Other markets out of Long Beach were chosen because they were underserved, unserved or overpriced.  The CalJet Business Plan takes into account flexibility for routes which do not perform and alternate markets can be activated if necessary. 
<p>


<b>How will CalJet remain "low fare"?</b><br>
Projections indicate that CalJets expenses will be under 6.35 cents per available seat mile, one of the lowest in the industry.  By compensating employees at reasonable levels and providing profit sharing incentives, costs are controlled while increasing productivity.  By avoiding costly capital expenses, CalJet will be able to operate at a profit for its investors notwithstanding competitive pressures.

<p>

<b>What keeps the City of Long Beach from changing its mind?</b><br>
CalJet will make the Long Beach Airport profitable and therefore it is in the Citys interest to support CalJet.  CalJets operations, training, maintenance, reservations and corporate headquarters will all be located in Long Beach.  This represents the creation of over 700 new jobs in the local community just at CalJet.  This, of course, does not include the ancillary jobs created by the presence of CalJet which could easily be 2,000 more.  As the "hometown" airline, CalJet will complement and support the local communities tourism, Convention Center, World Trade Center and the industrial and commercial base.
<p>


<b>Will CalJet affiliate with a major carrier?</b><br>
At this time there is no intention to affiliate with  a major carrier because CalJet will not interline or be part of the Airline Clearing House, both of which have a direct impact on the bottom line.  However, CalJet may be a part of the inventory listing within the major airlines computer reservations systems.

<p>

Will CalJet have a frequent flyer program?
Following managements philosophy of "keep it simple" there will be no frequent flyer program unless demand forces the issue.

<b>Mission Statement</b><br>
To provide safe, reliable, affordable airline transportation of the highest quality with a pre-eminent commitment to customer service and to fully vest our employees, partners and the communities in which we operate in the success of the airline.
<p>

<b>Management</b>
<ul>
<li>Hollis Harris, Chairman and CEO
<li>George Chelius, President
<li>Harold Achtziger, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer
<li>Tom Kneeshaw, Vice President, Administration
<li>Timothy Collins, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
<li>Ronald Holley, Vice President, Maintenance
</ul>
<p>
CalJets management team has more than two centuries of commercial aviation experience.
<p>

<b>Overview</b><br>
CalJet will be a low fare airline based on many of the principles of the original Long Beach based Jet America.  CalJet will serve the City of Long Beach and surrounding communities with affordable, safe, reliable airline transportation.  The route structure will serve major cities in the west and midwest with nonstop flights from Long Beach Airport.  
 <p>

<b>Commencement of Service</b><br>
CalJet plans to begin service in February 1997.
<p>

<b>Route Structure</b><br>
CalJet plans initial nonstop service from Long Beach Airport to San Francisco, Las Vegas and Sacramento.  Subsequent service will include Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta and Houston.
<p>



<b>Market Strategy</b><br>
CalJet will be a niche carrier designed to fill the commercial airline service void left when most major carriers abandoned the Long Beach Airport.  CalJets business philosophy is "keep it simple."  Some examples of this philosophy include paperless ticketing, seating assignments at check-in, and a basic, three-tier fare structure (21-day advance, seven day advance and walk-up peak and off-peak pricing).
<p>

<b>Slot Controlled Airport</b><br>
In 1995, the City of Long Beach established a limit of 41 Air Carrier slots and 25 Commuter Carrier slots (a slot is one landing and one take-off).  The difference between Air Carrier and Commuter Carrier slots is determined by the type, size and weight of the aircraft.  A Commuter Carrier slot applies to aircraft with a maximum take-off gross weight not to exceed 75,000 pounds.  CalJet has bonded 20 of the 41 Air Carrier slots and reserved all 25 Commuter Carrier slots.  CalJet controls 74% of the total passenger flight allocations.
<p>

<b>Aircraft</b><br>
CalJet plans to begin service with a fleet of four modern McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft.  The MD-80s will be operated in a 143 passenger, two-class configuration.  As service expands, CalJet plans to add four additional MD-80s and four new, 50 passenger Bombardier Canadair Regional Jets.  Canadair RJs will be used in the Commuter Carrier slots.  The Canadair RJs will be used to open new markets, increase frequencies, maintain off peak service and introduce service on thin routes. 
<p>


<b>Relationships with Aircraft Manufacturers</b><br>
Long Beach is the home of McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Company.  As neighbors, CalJet and McDonnell Douglas enjoy an outstanding relationship with each organization vested in the success of its counterpart.  Long Beach Airport will be the home of CalJets Corporate Offices, including its maintenance operations.  Having the companys maintenance base at the same airport as the aircraft manufacturer is a tremendous advantage.  Training, technical assistance, spare parts and troubleshooting are readily available to CalJet through the Douglas facility.  CalJet is also negotiating to lease from McDonnell Douglas the Long Beach Airport hangar once used by Jet America.  Alaska Airlines sold the hangar to McDonnell Douglas after it bought Jet America.   
<p>
Canadair, manufacturer of the Canadair Regional Jet, is well known to CalJets Chairman and CEO Hollis Harris.  Harris introduced the Canadair Regional Jet while at Air Canada and made it a successful part of its fleet.
<p>


<b>Economic Development</b><br>
In its first year CalJet expects to create 500 - 700 new jobs for the Long Beach area economy.  All of CalJets operations will be based in Long Beach including operations, training, maintenance, reservations and corporate headquarters.  Due to job loss caused by aerospace industry downsizing, closing of the Navy shipyards and the general recession of the early 90s, the Long Beach Airport area is designated as an economic revitalization zone.  Under this program, the City of Long Beach is assisting CalJet in obtaining local, State and Federal funds to support training for the hundreds of new jobs CalJet will create.
<p>
Not only will CalJet create 500 - 700 new direct jobs but its presence in Long Beach will generate a need for 2,000 ancillary jobs to support the airline and its employees.
<p>
The City of Long Beach and CalJet will also collaborate to fund a cooperative advertising campaign to promote the City.
<p>


<b>Long Beach Airport</b><br>
Located between LAX and John Wayne Airport, LBA is served by six major freeways (405 San Diego, 605 San Gabriel, 710 Long Beach, 110 Harbor, 91 Riverside, and 22 Garden Grove).  Long Beach Airport is the most convenient airport to more than six million residents within a 20 mile radius.  Its easy access, uncongested terminal and plentiful, inexpensive parking makes Long Beach Airport a preferred airport for those travelers for whom total trip time and trip cost are important.

<H1 Align=Center>Famous Quotes From PS Club Members</H1>
<HR SIZE=8>

<H3>You really never know what is going to be said at a PS Club meeting.  Just in case you missed them, here are some of the all-time great quotes:</H3>

<HR>

<P>Jon Etter, vice-president, joined the Official Pet food Taster, Andy Bender, in an end-of-the-meeting feast of Pup-peroni during a meeting of the Fall 1995 Semester.  After downing a small portion of this 'bacon' favored treat Jon commented:
<H3>"That ain't bacon."</H3>
(As a historical note, this quote has often been attributed to Andy Bender.  While Mr. Bender was in complete agreement with John, the comment was actually said by Jon Etter.)
</P>

<HR>

<P>Jon Etter, acting as the Cheese Hat Poet For the People, gave us an unforgettable series of Haiku's during the Spring Semester of 1996:<BR>

<H3>I wear a cheese hat<BR>
It looks very nice on me<BR>
I am so alone.<BR></H3>

<H3>Valentines Day comes<BR>
My cheese hat and I look great<BR>
Yet, we are alone<BR></H3>

<H3>My cheese hat hurts me<BR>
The strap is extremely tight<BR>
and yet, I love it.<BR></H3>

<HR>

<P>In the February 1996 Newsletter Andy Bender, Vice-president, attempted to encourage a greater participation by the general membership in his "Doodle Campaign."  His movement was symbolized by the slogan:
<H3>Doodles--They're like a screen saver for your brain.</H3></P>

<H4>Located next to Cesar's Hotel on the Sunken Plaza, we offer some of the finest 'greasy spoon' cuisine
	in all the barrios.  Don't let our 'stuffed shirt' look fool ya - it's all just a facade to hide
	our bumbling little cell of movers/anti-movers, Fris Hombre Aux Flambe, or FHAF.</H4><P>
<H4>FHAF doesn't actually station itself at Burger Palace; that would be too dangerous (and too fattening).
Instead, we operate out of Gamer's Haven in downtown Normal, Illinois (a perfect spot for us Cut-Ups
wannabes).<P>
<CENTER><H2>What we'd like to do here...</H2> </CENTER>
I've seen so many other pages of OnTE material on the Web, that I didn't want to be redundant, so
most of what you'll find here concerns FHAF itself, with the exception to the little flyer we like to 
insert in every menu: <A TARGET="Body" HREF="patois.html">
	"A Brief Guide to Al Amarjan Patois."</A><BR>
Also:  How to buy <A TARGET="Body" HREF="mugs.html">OnTE Mugs.</A><BR>
And:  The mysteries of <A TARGET="Body" HREF="cold.html">Cold Numbers.</A><P>

<CENTER><H1>On The Edge Mugs</H1></CENTER>
<P>
A quick message about the OnTE mugs (of which I own the Rain of Walrus).
Disclaimer...I am not associated in any way with Mystic Images, I just like the mugs! =)
<BR><HR><BR>
My name is Larry - owner of Mystic Images - a graphics
imprinting company - we have a licensing agreement with Atlas Games to
reproduce OnTE cards on mugs (coffee cups). These cups are being
produced with a print run of only 1000 each. The whole card is printed
on the mug and is left hand facing which means if you hold the mug in
your left hand the image faces you.<P>

Right now we have 4 cards available:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>	Rain of Walrus
<LI>	Koanhead
<LI>	Dr. Nussbaum
<LI>	Monique D'Aubaine
</UL>
The price is $10.00 each.<BR>
Shipping is $3.00 for the first and $1.00 for aditional mugs.<BR>
 Soooo, if you ordered 4 mugs your cost would be $40 for mugs and $6.00 for
shipping. Get the idea?<P>

Until my web page is up,all contacts can be made to:<BR>

<P>
<B>What is Cold Numbers?<P>
Cold Numbers is a fan created set of cards for On the Edge.  When a number of us learned that the 
	expansion formerly known as Wetworks (TEFKA WW) was put on hold by Atlas Games, we decided to
	satisfy our need for new cards ourselves.  The name was spawned from the subject of a letter 
	from John Nephew explaining why TEFKA WW wasn't possible. (Anyone have a copy of that letter?)<P>
There is a mailing list on which we discuss the set.  You can subscribe to it by sending a message to
	<A HREF="mailto:macjordomo@fenris.its.ilstu.edu">macjordomo@fenris.its.ilstu.edu</A> with an empty subject
	line and 'Subscibe cold_numbers 'Your_Real_Name'' in the first line of the message.<BR>
	Alternatively, you can deal with a real human being at <A HREF="mailto:Mrs_Brinker@fenris.its.ilstu.edu">
	Mrs_Brinker@fenris.its.ilstu.edu</A>.<P>
The digests of the list are stored at <A TARGET="Body" HREF="cold_numbers/"> the digest storage
	depot</A>.<P>
All the cards so far designed can be found at the <A HREF="http://www.intercon.com/evans/numbers/">
Cold Numbers Web Page</A>.
<P>
Please feel free to help us in this project....artists especially!

Kid allowsyou to call Sub-Random gear at no cost so PPB and Vibro Blaster are free each turn.  Radford had a free PPBand Blaster on her at all times as they (and she thanks to the PPB) returned to the players hand eachturn.  After Andrew cranked, C.A. had a 12 AP and Bulldozed her way through one player's conspiracy.Martinez then uncranked Andrew who then cranked to send off C.A. again.

He played one of the few useful cards in his hand, Terrors.... on Omni Yushka!

<BR>
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CONVENTION AND VISITORS BUREAUS<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What is the Significance of Convention and Visitors Bureaus?<BR>
<BR>
*  The International Association of Convention & Visitors Bureaus reported that <BR>
	84,870,803 delegates attended 350,867 meetings in 325 of IACVB's members' 	cities in 1990 generating approximately $54.6 billion in revenues.<BR>
<BR>
*  The IACVB conducted a funding and expenditure survey of 175 of its member 	bureaus in 1989, and found that the average bureau budget was more than $1.8 	million.<BR>
<BR>
*  In the area around Orlando, FL, convention spending  added 45,000 jobs, $269 million 	in wages, close to $1.2 billion in output, and $17 million in tourist taxes to the 	regional economy.  Convention and Visitors Bureaus help with much of the 	convention planning that generated these dollars.<BR>
<BR>
*  In 1993, the Niagara Falls Convention & Visitors Bureau reported 12 million annual 	visitors to Niagara Falls from Ontario and 8 million from New York.  These 	visitors inject millions of dollars in the local economy.<BR>
<BR>
*  The average staff size of a Convention and Visitor Bureau, with a budget of more than 	$5 million, is around 87 full-time staff members and 94 part-time staff members.  	CVB's are being recognized as vital to the economic development of many  cities.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why Should You Care?<BR>
<BR>
*  Convention and Visitors Bureaus provide tourist information on accommodations, 	restaurants, attractions, outdoor recreation, and things to see and do in a specific 	town or county.<BR>
<BR>
*  Convention and Visitors Bureaus engage in marketing and public relations to bring 	business and money to the areas they represent.<BR>
<BR>
*  Convention & Visitors Bureaus attract hotels, shops, restaurants, and attractions 	together in a single enterprise dedicated to sustaining and improving the travel and 	tourism industry in it's community.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Windows of Research Opportunity <BR>
<BR>
*  What impact, if any, do convention & visitors bureaus have on special events in their 	communities?<BR>
<BR>
*  What marketing and promotion procedures work  best to bring more people to your 	area?<BR>
<BR>
*  What impact, if any, do nearby convention & visitors bureaus have  on the economy 	of your community?<BR>
<BR>
*  What are the demographic profiles of people in your community and how does that 	affect the way your convention & visitors bureau approaches marketing and 	promotional ideas?<BR>
<BR>
*  What facilities, attractions, or venues are available for certain events in your 	community that you are serving?<BR>
<BR>
*  What is the impact of your convention & visitors bureau on the local economy?<BR>

<H4>Located next to Cesar's Hotel on the Sunken Plaza, we offer some of the finest 'greasy spoon' cuisine
	in all the barrios.  Don't let our 'stuffed shirt' look fool ya - it's all just a facade to hide
	our bumbling little cell of movers/anti-movers, Fris Hombre Aux Flambe, or FHAF.</H4><P>
<H4>FHAF doesn't actually station itself at Burger Palace; that would be too dangerous (and too fattening).
Instead, we operate out of Gamer's Haven in downtown Normal, Illinois (a perfect spot for us Cut-Ups
wannabes).<P>
<CENTER><H2>What we'd like to do here...</H2> </CENTER>
I've seen so many other pages of OnTE material on the Web, that I didn't want to be redundant, so
most of what you'll find here concerns FHAF itself, with the exception to the little flyer we like to 
insert in every menu: <A TARGET="Body" HREF="patois.html">

<CENTER><H1>On The Edge Mugs</H1></CENTER>
<P>
A quick message about the OnTE mugs (of which I own the Rain of Walrus).
Disclaimer...I am not associated in any way with Mystic Images, I just like the mugs! =)
<BR><HR><BR>
My name is Larry - owner of Mystic Images - a graphics
imprinting company - we have a licensing agreement with Atlas Games to
reproduce OnTE cards on mugs (coffee cups). These cups are being
produced with a print run of only 1000 each. The whole card is printed
on the mug and is left hand facing which means if you hold the mug in
your left hand the image faces you.<P>

Right now we have 4 cards available:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>	Rain of Walrus
<LI>	Koanhead
<LI>	Dr. Nussbaum
<LI>	Monique D'Aubaine
</UL>
The price is $10.00 each.<BR>
Shipping is $3.00 for the first and $1.00 for aditional mugs.<BR>
 Soooo, if you ordered 4 mugs your cost would be $40 for mugs and $6.00 for
shipping. Get the idea?<P>

Until my web page is up,all contacts can be made to:<BR>

<CENTER><H4>Thanks to John Evans for the banner</H4></CENTER>
<P>
<B>What is Cold Numbers?<P>
Cold Numbers is a fan created set of cards for On the Edge.  When a number of us learned that the 
	expansion formerly known as Wetworks (TEFKA WW) was put on hold by Atlas Games, we decided to
	satisfy our need for new cards ourselves.  The name was spawned from the subject of a letter 
	from John Nephew explaining why TEFKA WW wasn't possible. (Anyone have a copy of that letter?)<P>
There is a mailing list on which we discuss the set.  You can subscribe to it by sending a message to
	<A HREF="mailto:macjordomo@fenris.its.ilstu.edu">macjordomo@fenris.its.ilstu.edu</A> with an empty subject
	line and 'Subscibe cold_numbers 'Your_Real_Name'' in the first line of the message.<BR>
	Alternatively, you can deal with a real human being at <A HREF="mailto:Mrs_Brinker@fenris.its.ilstu.edu">
	Mrs_Brinker@fenris.its.ilstu.edu</A>.<P>
The digests of the list are stored at <A TARGET="Body" HREF="cold_numbers/"> the digest storage
	depot</A>.<P>
All the cards so far designed can be found at the <A HREF="http://www.intercon.com/evans/numbers/">
Cold Numbers Web Page</A>.
<P>
Please feel free to help us in this project....artists especially!

Each chit will be worth2 points towards championship status.  Join us.<P><FONT COLOR="280317">07/10/96:<FONT COLOR="#D9D919">  The tournaments of the last two weeks are over.  As expected, Andrew and Michael swept up.  Andrew was playing a Terminal/Xotok deck and Michael was using a variation of Drew Johnson's, <A HREF="http://public.carleton.edu/~djohnson/onte/cbt.txt">"Karla Sommers; One Night Only!"</A> deck andit is evil!  CBTs should be banned, errata-ed, restricted, something! Ick!  Kip Lamers improved considerablyfrom his last tourney's "Player Who Most Lived Up To His Name" Award. His Government/Law/Lurker/Hangmendeck was quite formidable.<BR><FONT COLOR="280317">Vicious Combo of the Tourney:<FONT COLOR="#D9D919"> Oil Pan Annie, Really Quite Angry Kid, Andrew Banks, C.A. Radford (C68),Ricardo Martinez, Pocket Panic Button, Vibro Blaster<BR>This combo usually only came up with the PPB, Radford and Banks, which was evil enough, but when Annie,Kid, Martinez, and the Blaster were added, conspiracies fell.<BR>For those who don't immediately see this:  Annie Makes Sub-Random gear Fringe and vice-versa.  Kid allowsyou to call Sub-Random gear at no cost so PPB and Vibro Blaster are free each turn.  Radford had a free PPBand Blaster on her at all times as they (and she thanks to the PPB) returned to the players hand eachturn.  After Andrew cranked, C.A. had a 12 AP and Bulldozed her way through one player's conspiracy.Martinez then uncranked Andrew who then cranked to send off C.A. again.  If only the character's Andrewaffected were popped at the end of the turn instead of at the end of combat.  *sigh*<BR><FONT COLOR="280317">Lame Combo of the Tourney:<FONT COLOR="#D9D919"> After having his Astral Wisdom Ideologically Polarizedon turn 2, the burger who was playing a Compton/Nekros/Glorious Lord deck vitally crippled.  After six turns, hefinally pulled his Four Points resource, but still had no Lords in his hand and an opponent's Evan MacDonaldstaring him down.  He played one of the few useful cards in his hand, Terrors.... on Omni Yushka!  Needlessto say, we let him take it back and put it on Bitter and Herb.<H2>LINKS</H2><A HREF="index.html">Burger Palace</A><BR>	The cafe of conspiracy<BR>	A resource area for On The Edge<BR><A HREF="http://www.its.ilstu.edu">OIT</A><BR>A nice place to work<BR><A HREF="/practice/march/index.html">March</A><BR>The guy who runs this place<BR><A HREF="/practice/index.html">The Pumpkin Patch</A><BR>Back to my Home Page<BR><CENTER>Please send any comments to    <A HREF=mailto:mjjeans@ilstu.edu>    March Pumpkin</A></CENTER><BODY></HTML>

<P>GAMBLING

<P>THE ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE  OF GAMBLING <BR> <BR> <BR> What is the
Economic Significance of Gambling?<BR> *  The gambling industry is
generating millions of dollars in tax revenues across the United <BR>
States.<BR> *  Casino revenues have increased dramatically, generating
$8.3 billion in 1990 to $12.9 billion <BR> in 1993.<BR> *  The dramatic
revenue growth of this industry is mainly due to new casino
destinations.<BR> *  The casino industry is prime for capital
investment in areas that have seen little development <BR> in recent
years.<BR> <BR> Why Should You Care?<BR> *  U.S. households made 92
million visits to casinos in 1993, which is twice the 1990 number <BR>
of 46 million.<BR> * Casino entertainment ranks ahead of many other
popular forms of entertainment such as  <BR> arena concerts, Broadway
shows, and even Major League Baseball games due to he large <BR> amount
of annual visits.<BR> * In 1993 more than half of the adults (51
percent) in the U.S. found casino entertainment and <BR> gambling to be
acceptable for anyone.<BR> <BR> Indian Reservation Gambling<BR> * 
Indian reservation casinos operating in 13 states with an estimated 75
casinos in 1993.<BR> *  Casino revenues for Indian casinos were
estimated at $2-4 billion in 1993.<BR> <BR> What are Examples of Local
Economic Impacts?<BR> <BR> ILLINOIS<BR> *  The casino market includes
13 excursion boats operating by the end of 1994.<BR> *  Casino
employment created 8,800 jobs in 1993 and $158 million in employee
wages.<BR> *  The casinos generated $140 million in state and local
taxes in 1993.<BR> IOWA<BR> *  The casino market includes 3 excursion
boats which generated 1,100 jobs in 1993 and $18.5    <BR> million in
wages.<BR> *  The casinos generated $8 million in state and local
taxes.<BR> INDIANA<BR> *  The casino market includes 2-5 excursion
boats by 1994 which could create 1,600-4,000    <BR> jobs and $35-88
million in employee wages.<BR> *  The casinos can generate $2-5 million
in monthly state and local taxes.<BR> MISSOURI<BR> *  The casino market
includes 5-10 excursion boats by the end of 1994 which could create  
<BR> 4,000-8,000 jobs and $88-176 million in employee wages.<BR> *  The
casinos can generate $5-10 million in monthly state and local
taxes.<BR> Possible Gambling Projections<BR> *  U.S. casino revenues
will double in the next decade.<BR> *  The riverboat casino market will
grow far bigger than originally anticipated.<BR> *  States will begin
to legalize land-based casinos to increase their revenues.<BR> <BR> *

significantly since this time)<BR> <BR> <BR> Windows of Research
Opportunity<BR> *  What are the differences in traditional casino
destination players vs. new casino players in <BR> 1994 according to
income, age, education, or employment?<BR> *  What are the demographic
profiles of casino players based on the frequency of visits to the <BR>
casinos?<BR> *  What are the income levels, age, education, and
employment statistics among the average <BR> U.S. citizen and casino
players?<BR> *  What impact, if any, will new nearby casino operations
have on existing dog tracks and off <BR> track betting revenues?<BR> * 
Is there a potential demand for casino operations in your
community?<BR> <BR> <BR> Credits<BR> *  Freed, William F. (1991).

The principle objective of the Honors Program is to enrich students'

academic experience. The Honors Program offers students opportunities to

engage in a wide variety of formal and informal learning experiences and

encourages interaction among students and faculty in and out of the

classroom. Students are able to get to know faculty and discuss ideas with

them in <A HREF="crswork.htm#Sections">Honors classes</A>, especially

 <A HREF="crswork.htm#Colloquia">Colloquia</A>.  Honors students collaborate

with faculty through <A HREF="crswork.htm#In-Course">In-Course Honors</A> projects, 

<A HREF="crswork.htm#URP">Undergraduate Research Participation</A>, 

<A HREF="crswork.htm#IHS">Independent Honors Study</A> and Honors 
<A HREF="scholar.htm#Mentorship">Mentorship</A> projects.

<P>The Honors Program encourages social interaction including student-planned

dances, programs and study breaks at Honors House, as well as off-campus

events and community service activities coordinated by the <A HREF="hso.htm#HSO">Honors Student

Organization (HSO)</A> and the <A HREF="hso.htm#NTHSO">Non-Traditional Honors Student Organization

(NTHSO)</A>.</P>



<P>From these academic and social experiences offered and encouraged by the

Honors Program, students develop initiative and self-reliance in learning.

This handbook is designed to acquaint students with the opportunities

available through the Honors Program and to inspire questions for further

discussion with an Honors adviser.</P>

<HR SIZE=8>

<H3><A NAME="Sections">Honors Sections</A></H3>

<P>The Honors Program offers special sections in a number of University Studies

courses, some discussion and lab sections of lecture courses and in a few

upper-level courses.  Honors sections are usually smaller than regular

sections and allow more active student participation. Honors sections

usually cover the same content as regular sections but students engage in

more intense coursework (e.g., essay tests, a research paper or an in-depth

class presentation). The intellectual stimulation of excellent instructors,

highly competent classmates, and smaller classes motivates Honors students

and consequently, many students get their best grades in Honors classes.</P>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="Colloquia">Honors Colloquia</A></H3>

<P>Colloquia are interdisciplinary courses which approach broad topics (e.g.,

"Buddhism and the Self," "Music in Society," "Women in Science") in informal

discussion-oriented settings.  Honors faculty develop colloquia in their

areas of interest and expertise especially for Honors students. Most

colloquia are not offered regularly, and some are only offered once. 

Students interested in colloquia should call the Honors Office prior to

early registration to be placed on a waiting list. Preference is given to

students who need colloquia credit to fulfill Honors designations.</P>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="In-Course">In-Course Honors</A></H3>

<P>Students may earn Honors credit in virtually any course by working beyond

the course requirements to complete an extra paper or project of the

studcnt's own design. Examples of/n-Course Honors projects include several

short article critiques, a 20-minute class presentation, or a 10-15 page

research paper. The amount of extra Honors work should be equivalent to the

work required for a 10-15 page paper.</P>

<P>After the Honors student and faculty member have agreed on the requirements

for the In- Course Honors, they describe the project on a contract (Appendix

A) and return it to the Honors Office by the end of the second week of the

semester. If the contract is not detailed enough or indicates an

inappropriate amount of work, the Honors office will return the contract to

the student for revision. At the end of the semester the faculty member

returns a form to the Honors Office stating whether or not the requirements

were met. If so, the student receives Honors credit for the course.</P>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="IHS">Independent Honors Study</A></H3>

<P>Independent study projects are initiated by Honors Students and should

complement and broaden regular coursework. The projects are supervised by

faculty members and must be approved by the department chair. Students

enrolling in Independent Honors Study must fill out a contract which

includes a description of the project (Appendix B).</P>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="URP">Undergraduate Research Participation</A></H3>

<P>URP is a credit-earning opportunity for students to participate in faculty

research projects.  In addition to gaining experience in research

methodology students benefit from the one- to-one interaction with faculty.

Projects are posted in the Honors Office, and students are encouraged to

review the project descriptions and initiate working relationships with

participating faculty members.</P>

<title>Scholarships</title>
<center><h1>Scholarships</h1></center>
<hr>
<a name="Mentorship"><h3>Mentorships</h3></a><p>
Honors students are eligible to work with faculty and staff members on
creative, original projects which relate to the student's career or academic
goals. The student and faculty or staff mentor submit a collaborative
proposal to the Honors Office for a one or two-semester project, and
approximately 40 mentorships are awarded for each academic year.  Student
recipients are paid $500 per semester and are expected to work approximately
10 hours per week on the mentorship project. Feedback is encouraged through
periodic project summaries and small group meetings with other mentorship
teams.<p>
<hr>
<h3>M.J. Scholarships</h3><p>
Three $500 M.J. Scholarships, established through a gift from a retired ISU
faculty member and alumna, are available each academic year for senior
projects. Early each spring semester, departments nominate interested
students. The candidates propose projects which are constructive and
potentially beneficial to the university, the community or another group,
and which contribute to the student's development.<p>
<hr>
<h3>National Scholarships</h3><p>
Honors advisers help prepare Honors students to compete for awards such as
the Rhodes, Marshall, Goldwater, Truman, Fulbright, Mellon and Rotary
scholarships. Most of these awards fund graduate study and applications
should be submitted early in the senior year.  Interested students should
contact their Honors adviser to discuss preparation and application
procedures for these scholarships.<p>

<title>Requirements</title>
<center><h1>Requirements</h1></center><p><hr>
<h3>Grade Point Average</h3><p>

Honors students are required to maintain a 3.3 cumulative GPA. Students
whose cumulative GPAs fail to between 3.0 and 3.29 will be assigned Honors
probationary status, which allows them to raise their GPAs while continuing
to enjoy the benefits of the Honors Program. An exception is allowed for
first semester freshman, who may be assigned probationary status with GPAs
of between 2.5 and 3.29.<p>

Students on probation will have two semesters to attain a 3.3 cumulative
GPA. To remain on probation during those two semesters, students must
achieve at least a 3.3 semester GPA. Students who do not meet the minimum
probationary GPA requirements or who fail to raise their cumulative GPA
within the designated two semesters will be dropped from the Honors Program.
Students who are dropped may reapply when their overall GPA is raised to the
required 3.3 minimum.<p>

Exceptions for students other than first semester freshmen are made on a
case-by-case basis by the <a href="staff">Honors Program staff</a>.<p>

<h3>Participation</h3><p>
Full-time Honors students must complete three hours of Honors work each fail
and spring semester; part-time Honors students must complete three hours of
Honors work for every 15 credit hours they complete, excluding coursework
taken during summer sessions. Honors sections of <a href="crswork#Sections">regular classes</a>, 
<a href="crswork#Colloquia">Honors Colloquia</a>, 
<a href="crswork#In-Course">In-Course</a> Honors, 
<a href="crswork#IHS">Independent Honors Study,</a> and 
<a href="crswork#URP">Undergraduate Research Participation</a> all count as Honors work.<p>
Honors hours in excess of three each semester may be "banked" toward
fulfilling the participation requirement for future semesters. Students who
complete 24 hours of Honors work are exempt from further participation
requirements.<p>
Students who do not take Honors <a href="crswork">coursework</a> and do not have banked hours will
be placed on Honors Suspension for the upcoming semester. This means the
student will be suspended from the upcoming Honors early registration period
and will be assigned a later registration time. In order to regain good
standing after the suspension semester, a student must complete at least
three hours of Honors work. If a student regains good standing during the
suspension semester but fails to complete Honors work in a subsequent
semester, the student will be dropped from the Honors Program and will not
be readmitted.<p>
Exceptions to the participation requirement are made for students who will
be involved in student teaching, study abroad, National Student Exchange,
full-time internships or co-op experiences. Other exceptions are rare and
are made on a case-by-case basis by the <a href="staff">Honors Program staff</a>.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Benefits of the Honors Program</H1>
<HR SIZE=8>

<H3>Early Registration</H3>

<P>Honors students register prior to the regular registration period, and are

usually able to schedule their choice of classes.  Current ISU students who

join the Honors Program for an upcoming semester are not yet eligible to

take advantage of early registration; Honors students who are suspended from

the program are also assigned a date and time during the regular

registration period.</P>

<HR>

<H3>Academic Advisement</H3>

<P>Honors freshmen and Pre-business freshman and sophomores are advised by the

<A HREF="staff">Honors staff</A>; upperclass students are advised primarily in their major

department, but may choose to consult with an Honors adviser as well.</P>

<P>Advisement appointments are most productive when students are prepared with

plans and questions.  In addition to helping develop academic plans, Honors

advisers will sign insurance forms to verify eligibility for "good student

discounts" and write letters of recommendation.</P>

<HR>

<H3>Honors House</H3>

<P>Honors House and International House share Walker Hall, a 400-student co-ed

residence hall located close to the <A HREF="http://www.ilstu.edu/map/hypertext/quad.html">Quad</A>.   

Residents observe quiet hours weekdays from 8 p.m. to 10 a.m. Diversity and commitment to education 
among residents contribute to the unique culture of Walker Hall.</P>



<P>Residents of Honors House must be members of the Honors Program and must

complete one Honors <A HREF="crswork#colloquia">Colloquium</A> each academic year. Honors House is 
staffed by Honors Assistants who serve as liaisons to the Honors Office, conduct

tours of Walker Hall and organize activities for residents to get to know

each other and to learn outside the classroom. Space is limited in Walker

Hall; interested students should contact the Honors Office well in advance

of the semester they wish to begin living in Honors House.</P>

<P>Students living in Honors House have the opportunity to participate in

either Faculty-Colleague Program, Individualized University Studies, or

traditional University Studies curriculum.</P>

<HR>

<H3>Faculty-Colleague Program</H3>

<P>The Faculty-Colleague program allows students to customize their four-year

course of study. The program is ideal for students with diverse interests.

Faculty Colleague participants are exempt from traditional University

Studies requirements. Furthermore, students in this program can modify

departmental course requirements and are allowed admission into advanced

courses.</P>


<P>For specific requirements, students should request a Faculty-Colleague

Program form and guidelines from an Honors adviser. After discussing this

option with an adviser, the student selects and meets with a faculty member

to develop a well-rounded plan of study. A typed plan must be submitted to

the Director of Honors for approval by the semester in which the student

accumulates 75 semester hours.</P>

<P> FESTIVALS & EVENTS<BR> <BR> <BR> THE ECONOMIC
SIGNIFICANCE OF FESTIVALS AND EVENTS<BR> <BR> <BR> What is the Economic
 Significance of Festivals and Events?<BR> <BR> * The Kodak Albuquerque
International Balloon Fiesta had a direct economic impact of
	$70,531,792 on the Albuquerque economy in 1993.  It was also found
that non-	resident spectator groups spent, on average, $740 in the
Albuquerque economy, 	primarily for lodging, meals, and retail
shopping.<BR> <BR> * Sunfest in West Palm Beach is Florida's largest
jazz, art and waterfront festival with a 	revenue budget of $2.1
million where 200,000 people attend and pay $10 for a one 	day
admission ticket. <BR> <BR> * In a case study of Dickens on the Strand
in Galveston, Texas, it was estimated that out 	of a total spending
of $7.5 million, 54% was spent at the site, 28% was spent on
	Galveston Island, and the remainder outside the area.<BR> <BR> <BR>
Why Should You Care?<BR> <BR> * Festivals and events can play different
roles as attractions, image makers, or catalysts 	for other
events.<BR> <BR> * In the case of the Kodak Albuquerque International
Balloon Festival, the city of 	Albuquerque directly received
$2,221,720 in gross receipts and lodging  tax 	revenues and the state
of New Mexico received $1,323.237 in gross receipts taxes 	and
$247,945 in gasoline tax revenues.<BR> <BR> * It has been found that
for every dollar spent at an event, about six dollars were spent in
	the host community.<BR> <BR> * In festivals and events there is the
opportunity to use tourism to generate revenue, 	attract attention
to causes, and to develop the community to everyone's advantage.<BR>
<BR> <BR> Sponsorship Information<BR> <BR> * Sponsorship provides
corporations and other businesses with the opportunity to invest 	in
an event for the purposes of advertising, public relations, or
sales.<BR> <BR> * Results from a study on sport event signage revealed
that 59% of those surveyed 	usually noticed sponsor or brand logos
at events and that 54% had a more 	favorable attitude toward companies
involved.<BR> <BR> * Miller Brewing Company's corporate office handles
50 event search year while its 	distributors promote Miller at
thousands of other events annually.<BR> <BR> * Miller Brewing Company
has been involved with the Kentucky Derby Festival for three 	or four
years.<BR> <BR> * Sponsorships can come from oil companies,
restaurants,banks, airlines, or from theme 	parks such as
Disneyland.<BR> <BR> * Disneyland was one of 60 sponsors for the
Tournament of Roses in Pasadena, 	California in 1994.<BR> <BR> *
Fifty-six percent of the spectators at the 1994 Danville Balloon
Classic, who identified 	Oldsmobile as a sponsor, stated that their
image was  positively enhanced due to 	their affiliation with the
event.  Sixty-two percent of the spectators  also had a more
	favorable image of Pepsi.<BR> <BR> <BR> Windows of Research
Opportunity <BR> <BR> * What are the demographic profiles of people who
attend your festival and event?<BR> <BR> * What is the economic impact
of a festival or event on the host community?<BR> <BR> * What types of
events or festivals create more benefits for the host community?<BR>
<BR> * What messages and images work best for the festival or event in
your community to get 	a better attendance?<BR> <BR> * What influence,
if any, does sponsorship signage have on consumer behavior? Does it
	enhance the image of the sponsor's products/services?<BR> <BR>

<B><H1> A REFINING OF THE ABILITY</H1>

<H3>To tell the truth</H3></B>

<BR>

by Marc Lebovitz

</CENTER>

<BR><BR><BR>

They were on a collision course, and Lucia Cordell Getsi was only a small child.

<BR><BR>

It was at an early point in her childhood when the intelligent,
independent, adventurous Tennessee girl and the magical, illuminating world
of books met head-on at the William H. and Edgar Magness Community House
and Library in the Middle Tennessee town of McMinnville. It probably came
as no surprise to those who knew her that the second child of Sam and
Georgia Cordell flung herself enthusiastically into reading. None of her
ventures were or are halfhearted.

<BR><BR>

"As a small child I decided that I needed to be stronger, so I would carry
these large boulders around," the Illinois State University Distinguished
Professor of English recalls. "And when I decided I had to cure myself of
vertigo, which I'd had since I was seven, I started to climb the faces of
cliffs near my home. No ropes, no tools, no nothing. It was terrible, but I
thought I needed to get over my fear. I'd get to the top and then lie down
and crawl back to the edge like a snake and make myself look over-for
hours."

<BR><BR>

When she characteristically made up her mind to know everything there was
to know in the world, she pitched camp in McMinnville's library and became
a library fixture. With a ruler she measured the stacks of books she would
read, making sure she completed at least a foot of books per week. She
eventually knew every shelf in the Magness Library and became aware that
knowledge was larger than the library only when she perused a "read" shelf
and discovered a new book had appeared.

<BR><BR>

She loved horse books, dog books, Nancy Drew books, and books her mother
didn't want her to read, such as Forever Amber and Inherit the Wind. She
read books at the library, at school, during church sermons, on the porch,
sitting in trees, and at night under her bed blanket with a flashlight
until morning.

<BR><BR>

For all the literary world gave to Lucia Cordell Getsi, she has admirably
and sufficiently repaid as an adult. She has published five volumes of
poetry and translations as well as poems, fiction, translations, and
critical essays in 60 or 70 refereed journals. Among the writing awards she
has won are the Capricorn Prize for the book of poems Intensive Care, the
Ann Stanford Prize, a Pablo Neruda Prize, a Bread Loaf Scholarship, a 1992
National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, three Illinois Arts Council
Fellowships, and numerous grants and awards for The Spoon River Poetry
Review, which she edits.

<BR><BR>

Even more important, Getsi shares her passion for the written word with
students from elementary school through college graduate school and with
the general public of all ages. Her public school poetry workshops, public
lectures, and public readings of her works have ignited interest and
enjoyment in poetry throughout the United States.

<BR><BR>

There is a bittersweet irony to the physical and mental fitness
conditioning young Lucia put herself through, because she was barely out of
her teens when both capacities were put to the test. Her mother, a strong,
intense, and deeply religious woman, committed suicide just days after
Lucia's 21st birthday. Exactly 20 years later, in 1985-86, Getsi's
17-year-old daughter, Manon, contracted the deadly and paralyzing
Guillain-Barr syndrome. After many months of hospitalization followed by
rehabilitation therapy, Manon recovered, although she continues to be
vulnerable to other ailments.

<BR><BR>

Those traumatic experiences, plus her other life experiences and
observations, have played a key role in Getsi's poetry. Manon's illness
resulted in Getsi writing the award-winning Intensive Care, the creation of
which served as an outlet for Getsi's anger and frustration and also
allowed her to be a proxy for Manon's then-still voice. She admits that
being able to write about the experience, in a way, helped save her own
life.

<BR><BR>

Books were young Lucia's lifeline to other worlds, her escape from
small-town Tennessee, and an endless source of experiences and information.
At various times in her life she thought the information was her own. Once,
as an adult, she cut open an infected wound on a horse's leg, squeezed out
the bad blood, and had her daughter, Manon, lead the horse to stand in the
creek each day for a week until the water healed the wound. The horse
survived. It wasn't until about a year later, while reading the classic
book My Friend Flicka to Manon, that Getsi discovered that her "intuitive
knowledge" used to help the horse actually came from the pages of that
book, which she had read and reread as a child.

<BR><BR>

But Getsi's real memories, experiences, observations, and emotions are
ingredients that produced the award-winning poet, author, editor, and
professor she is today at Illinois State University. Although her careers
as an educator and as a writer have been distinguished for years, the
honors have been particularly frequent in recent years. She was the 1994
Poet of the Year in Illinois, the same year the University named her an
outstanding researcher, and last November Gov. Jim Edgar presented her with
the Governor's Award for the Arts in the individual artist category.

<BR><BR>

She graduated magna cum laude in English from Middle Tennessee State
University and has master's and doctoral degrees from Ohio University. She
had NDEA and teaching fellowships at Ohio and studied for one year in
Germany on a Fulbright scholarship. Her first book was a translation of the
complete works of Austrian expressionist poet Georg Trakl, followed by
books of poetry titled Bottleships: For Daughters, Teeth Mother Letters,
and No One Taught This Filly to Dance.

<BR><BR>

Intense personal experiences have not only been the subjects of her
writing, but the insight Getsi gained during those experiences and
throughout her life continue to invigorate her poetic juices. But
experiences and emotions and observation don't make the poetry write
itself. Getsi spends countless hours on each work and particularly enjoys
the opportunity to focus only on poetry while in residencies, such as last
summer's residency at the Ragsdale Foundation in Lake Forest.

<BR><BR>

"When I'm at a writers' colony, or on a grant, all I do is write," she
says. "I can obsess about one poem for weeks, if I want to. Often I'll
write one humongous poem, and then the filtering starts. There are huge
baths of imagery, thought, context, emotions that wash over the original
images, thoughts and ideas I started with. Poetry is the kind of art that
needs long spaces of time to think and to create and just allow the fluid
movement of images to wash over the whole paradigmatic axis of memory, the
whole memory self.

<BR><BR>

"That's what grants such as from the National Endowment for the Arts permit
artists to do. But now the stupid, totalitarian people who are scared of
ideas and who want the world their way have had their way with the NEA, and
it's basically gone," she says.

<BR><BR>

"To write a book of poetry takes, usually, five to 10 or 11 years, but
Intensive Care was an exception. It took me from 1988 to about 1990 or '91.
When I first started writing those poems it was very cathartic. The poem
'Nursing' was written when I was in such a rage, I was so angry, the kind
of anger where you think you are going to melt. I was angry at the entire
medical profession, angry at nurses who couldn't spell or remember to cover
Manon's stomach with the lead shield during the 1,000 chest X rays."

<BR><BR>

During Manon's first months of hospitalization, none of her body's systems
were working, including her ability to speak. She communicated by spelling
words. Not vocally, but by having her mother or a nurse recite the alphabet
out loud while she indicated by blinking, letter by letter, the words she
wanted to communicate. A nurse who either could not spell or who did not
want to make the effort to communicate Manon-style moved Manon's headset,
which the paralyzed teenager used to call for the nurse, out of reach of
her head-the only body part she could move at that time. As a result, Manon
could not alert the doctors that her feeding tube was twisted and she was
in great pain and long overdue for a pain shot. Her mother discovered the
problem the next morning. She addressed the nurses in "Nursing" (see page
6).

<BR><BR>

"There were wonderful nurses too, of course," she recalls, "but the poem
was cathartic in dealing with those bad ones. Some of the other poems in
the book were ways of funneling unresolved things from my life through that
experience. That experience cast a new light on those unresolved things,
the kind of light that makes meaning in life. That kind of 'making meaning'
is what makes us human."

<BR><BR>

Manon still weeps at her mother's public readings from Intensive Care, and
to this day there is still one poem that Getsi cannot read aloud without
choking a little. "The book, for her, is my experience of her illness," she
says. "It is a mirror she can look back into because, blessedly, she did
not see herself in the mirror during that time. At the time, she looked as
though she would not survive, and I did not let her see that."

<BR><BR>

Although she continues to bring poetry to classrooms in Illinois and
elsewhere, Getsi can't hide her disappointment in the state of reading,
especially reading poetry, these days.

<BR><BR>

"Poetry just isn't there in the schools," she says. "It isn't in public
schools, it isn't in the libraries, it isn't even much in the bookstores
except for specialized bookstores. Anything that requires lonely
concentration is not in the schools anymore. It's not a financial issue,
it's just unnatural to our contemporary culture to be silent. But poetry
grows out of that silence. As a result, poetry now has been marginalized
and hidden."

<BR><BR>

Reading during childhood, particularly reading poetry, can introduce
children to a new worlds of information and insight and experience that can
ultimately inspire them to explore their own ideas and feelings. Children,
Getsi firmly believes, need poetry and art and music and drama and all the
arts in their lives as early as possible in order to have the greatest
benefit throughout theirlives. But the great power of poetry is nowhere to
be found in too many American schools.

<BR><BR>

"Ninety percent of the teachers in elementary and high schools don't know
where to go to find poetry. I've been to hundreds of school libraries where
they don't have books in the library, only audiovisual equipment or
computers. Most school libraries don't have poetry, especially elementary
school libraries. It's because students aren't expected to go in and read;
and, if they do go in, they don't read poetry, because they haven't been
exposed to it. I've been to some of the best schools in our state to do a
poetry workshop and have had students who have never read a poem. They
might get a Hallmark card with what is called poetry on it, and that's what
they think poetry is. What do you do?" Getsi asks.

<BR><BR>

"I can't tell you how many times I've received calls from teachers who ask
about my poetry outreach program, a small outreach program I run through
Spoon River Poetry Review, who say, 'Poetry is the field I feel most unsure
about, most uncomfortable teaching.' I tell them they don't have to 'teach'
poetry, they don't have to know everything about a poem before teaching it.
All they have to do is enjoy it, and let students enjoy it. Just put the
poetry out there.

<BR><BR>

"The program is free to the schools, but they have to do it under my
conditions: three weeks devoted to nothing but poetry in the English
classes," she says. "We use a Spoon River Poetry Review poet, and I try to
feature two poets a year with an Illinois connection, so I have an endless
supply throughout the state.

<BR><BR>

"The only thing I want to come out of it is that students have a
fantastically wonderful, integrating experience with poetry. They
accomplish something, learn something new, get excited about it, assimilate
it, accommodate it, and are changed by it; and they are different people
when I or my assistant walk out of their room. I want the students to have
an experience that imprints so deeply that they will associate the
experience with language, with poetic language, and with poetic form
forever. They know it is something called poetry, and they can access that
world any time they want, easily. I teach them the access points: the
literary bookstores, the small presses, now the Internet, how to get the
books, and what books to look for."

<BR><BR>

Lest anyone get the impression that the absence of poetry in the schools
tempts her to quit bringing poetry to the younger set, Getsi brims with
hope and excitement when she tells about the students in the K-2 class she
met in Granville, Illinois, or the very at-risk teenagers attending a
special Los Angeles school that serves as their last chance at a high
school diploma.

<BR><BR>

In her discussions about poetry with all those groups, Getsi sometimes uses
prints of paintings of horses by German artist Franz Marc as a basis for
imagery. "I use Franz Marc's works because they always have weird stuff in
them that can't be explained," she says. "I ask the students to walk into
the picture and describe what is happening. I ask them to describe shapes
and to step in and out of the painting and to walk around the horses in the
picture. The assignment is to write a communal poem, which everyone
contributes to and which ends up many pages long before it gets whittled
down [see page 9]."

<BR><BR>

"And that is a complete experience," Getsi says. "They brought their whole
world into it and put another world into that whole world and have taken
that enriched world and galloped to wherever they think they are going back
to. But they'll never get back to it, because these are changed little
people. They'll never look at art the same way or a horse the same way.
That is the secret power of art.

<BR><BR>

"It's about imagination and the ability to imagine," she says. "Television
and movies steal our ability to imagine, and that's a killer for poetry.
Without the ability to imagine, you can't really read, but you particularly
can't read poetry. Unless you can picture in your mind everything that
passes in front of you in a poem, you get nothing out of it. I can't teach
students to write until I teach them how to think metaphorically, in an
image-based way.

<BR><BR>

"The kids in L.A. were kids who had seen everything: pregnancy, drugs,
guns, death. They really wanted to go to this school although it's very
hard; and, if they don't stick with it, they are out. I laid out the
paintings, and we started talking about them. They are very smart kids with
wonderful language skills. The poetry they wrote spoke volumes to me. All
their hope and unjaded idealism came pouring through."

<BR><BR>

Getsi's mother was descended from Braxton Bragg, a brilliant Civil War
general who is blamed in part for the South's defeat because of his failure
to take advantage of the victory of his Army of Tennessee at the Battle of
Chickamauga.

<BR><BR>

"I see those fanatically obsessive, brilliant, moody characteristics on
that side of the family, and I have been obsessive off and on about a lot
of things in my life," Getsi admits. "But I've channeled it differently,
redistributing aspects of my personality. Writing helps to rechannel
things, because it requires an intense paying attention to things and
requires a self-honesty. That could be an illusion, but I really think it
does.

<BR><BR>

"You are very aware, when you are writing, of when you are lying.
Truthfulness is not easy. It really is very difficult," she says. "The act
of writing is a refining of the ability to tell the truth, the need to tell
the truth. Only the artist knows how very difficult it is to be truthful."

<BR><BR>

Quotation taped to Getsi's Stevenson Hall office door: "Artistic growth is,
more than it is anything else, a refining of the sense of truthfulness. The
stupid believe that to be truthful is easy; only the artist, the great
artist, knows how difficult it is."-Willa Cather

<BR><BR>

"People are hungry today with their self-help books and natural health and
tai chi and meditation and yoga and all this kind of stuff," Getsi says.
"But the nourishment they need is available to them through literature.
They just have to take the time to access it. You can't read a poem like
you read a newspaper, because it is all the invisible stuff, all the stuff
you're not reading, that is what's important, and it takes time for that to
come forward."

<BR><BR>

Getsi recalls a personal example of the nourishment and enjoyment that
comes from literature in general.

<BR><BR>

My Friend Flicka is about the relationship between love and death and
between insanity and genius. It is a magnificent novel that had a profound
influence on me as a child, especiallythe love-and-death and
madness-and-genius motifs. I saved that horse's life in Tennessee, but I
didn't know I had learned it from that book until I read it with Manon.

<BR><BR>

"One time, Manon, her first stepfather, and I were reading the book out
loud in the car on the way back to Normal from the stable in Decatur where
our horses were stabled. We were reading and couldn't stop when we got to
our driveway," she says.  "It was the climax of the novel, and three of us
were sobbing. The boy in the novel had been up all night caring for the
horse, who had been badly injured by barbed wire and was all infected and
about to die from this terrible fever. It is a powerful description of love
as a life force and of what it feels like to begin to die, of the process
of death. In fact, it's an exact description of what I went through with
Manon.

<BR><BR>

"But in the story there is a transference, and the fever goes to the boy,
who becomes sick with pneumonia and is delirious. He hears a shot and
thinks his father has shot his horse. Actually, the father had shot a
cougar. The boy wakes up six months later and finds that Flicka is alive
and fine. Flicka is the anima of this little boy, it is his female side,
his creativity. It's a complex, amazing novel.

<BR><BR>

"Well, we clambered back into the house, still reading the whole time,
sitting on the floor for another 20 minutes, all of us sitting there
sobbing as we finish the book. We weren't a bit embarrassed! Incredible!
Jeez! How many times does that happen when a family can share that kind of
emotional experience-safely?"

I am watching the big blue horses.<BR>

are plump, like blue plums, like blue<BR>

<P><B>Felmley General Emergency Procedures</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Notes:</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1.	Use the nearest stairwell, not the elevators when evacuating Felmley Hall or Felmley Hall Annex.  <BR>
2.	Evacuate to the quad or library plaza, away from the building, and remain there until instructed to re-enter.  <BR>
3.	If dialing 911, don't hang up the phone until you are told to do so.  Always seek assistance first, regardless of the scope of the emergency.  <BR>
4.	Individuals trained in first aid or CPR are listed on the safety spill cabinets located outside of FHS 302 and FSA 431.  <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>Medical Emergencies:</B>  <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1.	Send someone to call 911.  If no one is available to do so, call 911 yourself after providing immediately necessary assistance.  <BR>
		Immediate assistance may include such things as helping the individual with a safety shower or eyewash and controlling life-threatening conditions such as severe bleeding or shock , and with lack of breathing or heartbeat if you have been trained in CPR.  Never perform CPR on a person who has a heartbeat.  <BR>
2.	Only move the victim if he/she is in danger of further injury.  <BR>
3.	When dialing 911, direct the ambulance to the nearest exit door.  <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>Fires Too Large or Dangerous for You to Extinguish:</B><BR>
<BR>
	University policy indicates that the best course of action in case of fire is to pull the fire alarm on your route out of the building.  <BR>
<BR>
	Always assess the safety of putting out the fire yourself before doing so.  Only attempt to extinguish small fires (no larger than a basketball), if you will not be endangering yourself or others in the process (be aware of combustibles).  Always allow yourself a clear route of escape from the fire should it get out of control.  <BR>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1.	Contain the fire as much as possible.  Close doors and windows.<BR>
2.	Pull the fire alarm station lever to alert the fire department and evacuate the building.  <BR>
3.	Call 911 at a remote location to explain the nature of the emergency.  <BR>
4.	Go yourself or send someone to the north door of Felmley Hall of Science on College Avenue to direct the emergency crew to the location of the fire.  <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>Conditions that Create Serious Health Hazards (Spills of Highly Toxic Chemicals, Release of Highly Toxic Gases, etc.):</B><BR>
<BR>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>1.	Contain the condition if possible by closing lab doors, etc.<BR>
2.	Pull the fire alarm station lever to alert the fire department and evacuate the building.  <BR>
3.	Call 911 at a remote location to explain the nature of the emergency.  <BR>
4.	Go yourself or send someone to the north door of Felmley Hall of Science  on College Avenue to direct the emergency crew to the location of the problem.  <BR>

<B><H1>SCHOLAR FROM THE PAST</H1></B>

<B><H3>For this man of note, the music never ends</H3></B>
<BR>
by Ruth Cobb

</CENTER>

<BR><BR><BR>

His office is tucked away on the second floor of the Center for the Visual
Arts. The orderly assortment of clippings and collected items posted on the
door alerts visitors to the interests and activities of the occupant. The
two things that stand out are a quote from Emerson on success and a postage
stamp that reminds the reader that learning never ends. At 78,
Distinguished Professor Emeritus Roque Cordero is living what he believes.
Music is a powerful means of expression for him, and through his works and
his teaching he continues to share what he has learned.

<BR><BR>

Cordero, a native of Panama, came to Illinois State University to be its
first (and, so far, only) faculty composer in 1972 at the behest of then
department chairperson Arthur Corra. He retired from the Department of
Music in 1987, but has continued to teach composition two days a week.

<BR><BR>

"I like keeping in touch with the students," says Cordero. The lighter
schedule also allows him to compose, visit with his grandchildren, and
attend music festivals.

<BR><BR>

He teaches classes part time, but the work of composing takes up much of
the rest of his time because "there are so many things I'd like to write!"

<BR><BR>

Since Cordero composed his first serious music at 17, there has always been
more to be written and explored. He founded the National Symphony Orchestra
of Panama at the age of 21 and was awarded the 1949 Guggenheim Fellowship
for Creative Music. His mentors have included Ernst Krenek, Dimitri
Mitropoulos, Stanley Chapple, and Leon Barzin.

<BR><BR>

During the course of more than 60 years of composing, Cordero's efforts
have earned him numerous honors and awards. His Second Symphony won the
Caro de Boesi Prize at the Second Inter-American Music Festival in Caracas,
Venezuela, in 1957. In 1974 Cordero's Concerto for Violin and Orchestra won
the Koussevitsky International Recording Award, and that same year he was
presented with the Gold Medal for his contributions to music and education
in Panama. These and other accolades brought offers to move to other places
through the years, but Cordero chose to remain at Illinois State because of
the supportive atmosphere. He was named a Distinguished Professor in 1983.

<BR><BR>

"It has always been a good working environment for me. I worked with Dr.
Corra at Indiana University, and when he hired me to come to Illinois State
University I found there were excellent performers on the faculty. Here I
could conduct. They played my music and even commissioned a piece for the
Illinois State Symphony," recalls Cordero. "There were so many students
eager to learn. And it was a nice, small city with good cultural
offerings."

<BR><BR>

Cordero has done his part to enhance the cultural offerings in the Midwest.
He served on the Creative Artists Division advisory panel of the Illinois
Arts Council in 1981 and 1982 and wrote a special commemorative piece for
the centennial celebration of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in 1995. He
is at work on a piece commissioned by the Peoria Symphony to commemorate
its centennial in 1997. With a twinkle in his eye, but an earnest tone in
his voice, Cordero declares he fully intends to compose a celebration piece
for his own centennial. "It's only 22 years from now; that's not so long! I
studied with a man at the University of Minnesota who recently died at the
age of 106."

<BR><BR>

The record shows that a combination of talent, tenacity, and timely
encouragement helped Cordero along the way. "My father gave me honesty and
an eagerness to create. He was a shoemaker, but a very artistic shoemaker.
He told me, 'Do what you want, but always be your very best.' And I try to
pass that [advice] on to my children and grandchildren."

<BR><BR>

Cordero says he grew up in a tenement in Panama,  where there was no
privacy for his composing. "The only way I could do it was to close my mind
to all the other sounds except those from within," he recalls. As a result,
he has developed keen powers of concentration.

<BR><BR>

"Many of my ideas come to me while I am traveling by plane. I hear the
sounds in my head, but I don't write them down," he adds, explaining that
fellow travelers become curious if they see someone writing musical notes.
Cordero also does not use instruments when he is creating a piece."I always
keep it all in memory and compose in my mind." According to Cordero, the
planning of music is the difficult part; writing it down is easy.

<BR><BR>

The composer speaks with reverence of the late Dimitri Mitropoulos, who was
director of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra when Cordero was studying
music education at the University of Minnesota. Mitropoulos provided the
impetus for the young Panamanian to further his studies in this country and
even financed a private scholarship to ensure that Cordero would be able to
achieve his educational goals. The two remained friends, and a portrait of
Mitropoulos looks down over Cordero's desk, an ever-present reminder of the
need for the composer to challenge himself and those who will perform his
work.

<BR><BR>

In his role as an educator, Cordero tries to do for his students what his
mentor did for him: be there to help them. "I want to help them become
something in life-rather than just a composer. My immortality is the memory
I will leave with all who have touched my life, my students, friends,
children, and grandchildren. I tell my students to be honest in music and
in life," he adds.

<BR><BR>

Being an honest composer, for Cordero, means learning from the techniques
used by the masters, but not imitating their styles. "I want to be my own
master," he states emphatically. As a consequence, the message in many of
his works is a personal statement, as opposed to conveying political or
popular ideas. "Often the themes reflect moments in my life that couldn't
be spoken of."

<BR><BR>

Peace is a very important theme in Cordero's life and work. He had never
written a cantata before, but  his proposal for such a work, integrating
the ideals of four men he admired with his own ideas, was accepted for a
National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1975. His tribute to Abraham
Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, John F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. is
titled Cantata for Peace. These individuals gave their all and represent
all those who die as a result of violence in the name of peace, according
to Cordero.

<BR><BR>

He does regret the fact that, to date, his cantata has never been
performed. "It has been more than 16 years now," he says. But this is a man
possessed of infinite patience. "I know that when it is played, the
conductor will know exactly what I feltyou must find peace within yourself
before you can find peace with your neighbor."

<BR><BR>

In a world where many believe they must claw their way to the top of the
heap, Cordero remains calmly distant from the clamor. "You don't have to
step on someone else to get to the top." He credits "bad years" for giving
him the experience he needs to go forward.

<BR><BR>

"I have no hate or envy-I lived this long without bitterness. I'm happy for
my friends who have found success, and I enjoy all talent and spirit." He
also tells those who ask how to "make money" from their music that "money
is not the important thing in life. It's very expensive to write music. You
give so much to it. The reward is in the satisfaction of creating your
work, not the money."

<BR><BR>

Cordero admits to a few unsatisfied wishes at this point. He would like to
hear one of his works performed by the Illinois Symphony-he knows his work
"plays in Peoria" (and Chicago, Caracas, Washington, D.C., and other
locales), but the local symphony has yet to take up one of his scores.

<BR><BR>

His other wish is that he could have done more to give the people of Panama
rewarding music. "My country is still important to me," Cordero says
quietly. "I have played a part in making my country's musical history, but
I wish I could have done more while I was there."

<BR><BR>

As conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra of Panama, Cordero found
that the struggle to raise funds and increase the level of artistic
development sapped his creative energies. The realization that his talent
lay in his ability to compose and to conduct new works meant seeking
opportunities in another country, but it never meant renouncing his
Panamanian citizenship.

<BR><BR>

In typical Cordero style, he has not allowed any disappointments that come
his way to interfere with his productivity. During 1995 his popular Eight
Miniatures for Small Orchestra was recorded on compact disc. He also
completed a duo for oboe and bassoon to premiere this spring in a concert
by Illinois State Music Department faculty members Judith and Michael
Dicker.

<BR><BR>

Cordero and his wife, Betty, whom he met while he was a student at the
University of Minnesota, are the parents of three children: Dimitri,
Rogelio, and Ricardo. Photographs of the grandchildren are proudly
displayed among numerous plaques and other memorabilia on the piano in his
office, denoting the equal measure of importance he gives to the various
elements in his world.

<BR><BR>

"I don't try to set the world on fire with my music. My character is the
same in music and in life. I tell my students, 'Go as high as you can-go
higher! But don't do it in the name of success. Do it because it is in
you.'"

<BR><BR>

His notes are graced with deep-seated emotions; his words convey a
heartfelt  love for mankind. The years have not hushed the tone of his
passion for his art. Rather, time seems to provide a continuum of motifs
for Cordero to explore-and for everyone else to enjoy.

<H3>Curtain lifts on Native American theatre</H3></B>

<BR>

by Pamela Lewis

</CENTER>

<BR><BR><BR>

Randy Reinholz does much of his best work over a cup of coffee. If you
analyze his accomplishments, the assistant professor of theatre at Illinois
State University has apparently consumed reservoirs of the stuff, and there
are thousands of cups to come.

<BR><BR>

Though only an Illinois State faculty member since 1993, Reinholz has made
quite a name for himself and the University's Theatre Department through
his work with Native American theatre. The past two years he has conducted
"Native Voices: A Festival of Native Plays," a program designed to connect
Native American playwrights with established theatre artists. Scripts are
discussed in workshops, and authors have the opportunity to refine their
work under the guidance of Native American and other multicultural theatre
professionals experienced in script development. The festival, first
program of its kind in the United States, arose from Reinholz's quest to
stage a Native American play at Illinois State.

<BR><BR>

"Someone suggested we do a native American play, so I called friends who
were involved in play development, and no one could locate any Native
American scripts. Then we found out about a Canadian production company in
Toronto, and they taught me how to find playwrights down here,'' Reinholz
says.

<BR><BR>

Because Illinois State encouraged experimentation, Reinholz says it was the
right place to launch a program showcasing Native American theatre. The
program has become especially meaningful inasmuch as he is a descendant of
the Choctaw people. Reinholz is the festival's artistic director. His wife,
Jean Bruce Scott, who also is an Illinois State faculty member, is the
festival's cocreator and its managing director.

<BR><BR>

"Native playwrights think they are alone. So we thought we'd do some play
readings. That's how you start. Read the play out loud to discuss strengths
and weaknesses," Reinholz says. "When so many playwrights and theatre
professionals offered their expertise, we thought we might as well make a
festival out of it."

<BR><BR>

In 1994 professionals from theatrical companies and university theatre
departments throughout the United States and Canada came to Illinois State
to participate in "Native Voices." Reinholz is an expert in theatrical
networking, because he is a veteran actor with an extensive repertoire.

<BR><BR>

The assistant professor never envisioned himself in the theatre profession.
In fact, he set out for college with the ministry in his sights. A talented
baseball center fielder and football halfback in high school, Reinholz won
a sports scholarship at William Jewell College, a fine arts college in
Liberty, Missouri. However, the road to a diploma was a rocky one. In class
the first-year college student displayed extraordinary verbal and listening
skills. His homework and test scores were less than impressive, however,
because he struggled with reading and writing assignments.

<BR><BR>

"People thought I wasn't disciplined and didn't care," Reinholz says. "Some
thought I couldn't read or write well because I was a football player. My
grades were poor, and a communication professor noticed I had trouble
reading out loud. He took me into his office and worked with me using
poetry."

<BR><BR>

Reinholz's dyslexia would not be diagnosed until graduate school, so to
cope as an undergraduate he utilized study groups, professors' office
hours, and most important-coffee shops.

<BR><BR>

"I compensated by always going to class, always taking notes, always
working with professors. I invited classmates to coffee, to dinner, and
talked with them, trying to understand things,'' Reinholz says.

<BR><BR>

He soon became intrigued with the theatre classes offered by the
communications department. Because the college had no theatre department,
it hired ballet, theatre, and dance companies to give students the best
fine arts experience money could buy.Reinholz worked with the likes of
Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Twyla Tharp, and Luciano Pavarotti and admired the
artists so much he decided to pursue an acting career. His football
scholarship was transferred to communications, and-ironically-he eventually
became a recruiting tool for the college's sports programs.

<BR><BR>

"They told recruits, 'Hey, if football doesn't work out, you can be like
Randy.' There were no hard feelings. In fact, when I played Romeo, a former
teammate who ended up with the Pittsburgh Steelers, came up to me and said,
'Hey, man, I wish I was you.'''

<BR><BR>

After graduation it took a year for Reinholz to decide which graduate
school he would attend. While waiting tables in Kansas City, Missouri, he
read more than 200 plays to prepare for his graduate experience. Cornell
University would be the school to beckon the ambitious graduate student and
also would be the place Reinholz's dyslexia would finally be brought into
the spotlight.

<BR><BR>

"I was playing Eros in Julius Caesar. Robert Foxworth and JoBeth Williams
played the leads. Reading the scripts out loud I really struggled more than
usual because I was so nervous. People thought I was doing it on purpose.
Luckily the director recognized the problem and said they would get me
professional help-the kind of help I get my first-year students at Illinois
State."

<BR><BR>

Reinholz also was challenged in graduate school because he did not have a
background in acting theory.

<BR><BR>

"They didn't know what to do with me. They threw books at me. I tried to
plow through them. I took people to coffee and asked them everything. It
was my way of learning," he says.

<BR><BR>

Another important person Reinholz invited to coffee was the casting
director for ABC-TV daytime programming, Mary Lynn Henry, who came to
Cornell for a workshop. She told him how to build his theatre rsum and
explained what union cards were needed for television work. From Cornell
Reinholz traveled to San Diego and served an 18-month stint with the Old
Globe Theater, where he appeared in more than a dozen plays alongside
established actors from Los Angeles and New York. After his Old Globe
internship, the aspiring actor accepted jobs for industrial films and local
commercials.

<BR><BR>

"My grandmother said to me, 'You have to do something with your life. I'm
going to die soon.' I told her I was working on it,'' Reinholz says of his
early career in the late 1980s.

<BR><BR>

Eventually Reinholz landed guest shots on TV shows such as China Beach and
Tour of Duty. Another coffee klatch at the home of a soap opera head writer
resulted in an eight-month stint as Adam Scott in the ABC soap Days of Our
Lives. It must have been typecasting, because Reinholz says his character
usually interacted with other soap opera characters over endless cups of
coffee.

<BR><BR>

"I have performed in more than 30 professional plays. I have performed in
more than 30 amateur plays. I can list all of my Shakespearean roles, yet
people still remember me for Days of Our Lives. That's OK. I was trained to
believe actors act. You don't do things that you think are degrading, but
try everything," Reinholz advises.

<BR><BR>

It's not surprising that Reinholz met Scott, his future wife, over a cup of
coffee. Because of her long list of television and film credits, she was
instrumental in connecting Reinholz to the right Hollywood people. The
industry networking and mentoring would later serve Reinholz well in
launching the Illinois State "Native Voices" project.

<BR><BR>

Reinholz and Scott settled in Hollywood and soon became involved in script
and screenplay writing. Reinholz accepted a teaching position at Santa
Monica College and planned to remain there until the skyrocketing crime
rate and Los Angeles riots convinced him and Scott to search for safer
pastures. A professorial position at Duke University initially appeared
appealing; however, Reinholz grew restless within a year.

<BR><BR>

"At Duke, theatre was treated more like a hobby. I knew Illinois State was
a good school. I sent my rsum a lot of places and interviewed a lot of
places. Illinois State seemed positive, presented a lot of opportunity. It
has a great reputation for undergraduate and graduate acting, which is what
I teach.''

<BR><BR>

He also intended to resume acting, but the drive from Bloomington-Normal to
Chicago was more problematic than he expected. Directing college
productions, therefore, would become his teaching outlet. So would the
"Native Voices" festival.

<BR><BR>

"The unusual thing about Illinois State is that people in the community
support the plays. At other places, usually family and friends are the ones
who come. It's very gratifying to have your work appreciated." he says.

<BR><BR>

And with that kind of creative atmosphere Reinholz found the support he
needed to make "Native Voices" work.

<BR><BR>

"The festival was designed to get raw responses, to get amateur and
professional points of  view about an emerging art form out of an oral
tradition. It's a very political process, and we try to stay away from the
politics," Reinholz says.

<BR><BR>

"The first festival resulted in staged readings from Native Americans all
over the country. Now we're trying to get low-budget workshop productions.
Once people believe in the playwright, they'll put the show up."

<BR><BR>

As the "Native Voices" festival continues to expand, Reinholz's
responsibilities will continue to grow. In just two years a network of
people interested in Native American plays and playwrights has been
established. Scripts are in development. Plays are being produced. And
calls from Native American playwrights seeking advice and theatrical
connections have skyrocketed.

<BR><BR>

The 1995 festival offering, Baby Blues, written by Drew Hayden Taylor, soon
will be staged at Center Stage of  Pennsylvania and off Broadway in New
York. Seventy-five percent of the cast will be Native American actors. The
director, associate producer, costumer, and sound designer are also Native
American. The "Native Voices" production about domestic abuse, Now Look
What You Made Me Do, by Marie Humber Clements, was staged in January at the
American College Theatre Festival in Ohio.

<BR><BR>

Works originating from the festival also have been seen at the Mark Taper
Forum in Los Angeles, Native Earth Performing Arts in Toronto, The New York
Theatre Workshop, and at the Banff Playwrights Conference in Canada.

<BR><BR>

"Our goal is to let these playwrights develop their voices. Their plays may
never be seen. They may only be seen by Native American. There may never be
a major production. That's OK. We're here to get the work read in front of
an audience."

<B><H1>STUDENT SCHOLARS</H1>

<H3>Graduate students advance disciplines through research</H3></B>

<BR>

by Susan  Marquardt Blystone

</CENTER>

<BR><BR><BR>

Illinois State University faculty continue to advance the knowledge of
their disciplines through discovery. Their increased knowledge is
transferred to students in the classroom, making the learning cycle
continuous.

<BR><BR>

But faculty do more than just distribute their findings to students. They
actively encourage students to embrace the importance and rewards of
research, guiding them through projects that develop questioning minds.
Every year students from each college tackle projects that demonstrate a
high level of sophistication and reinforce the strong connection between
research and learning on the Illinois State campus. In 1995 the work of
three students in particular was deemed superior.

<BR><BR>

Pratumtip Boontrakulpoontawee and David Costigan received the Clarence W.
Sorensen Distinguished Dissertation Award. Boontrakulpoon-tawee earned her
Ph.D. in biological sciences and completed a dissertation exploring the
development of the nervous system: "The Caenorhabditis elegans Unc-44
Ankyrin Gene: Wild-Type Mutant and Revertant Gene Structures and
Transcripts." Costigan, who earned his Doctor of Arts in history, examined
fundamental assertions about the Civil War in his dissertation: "A City in
Wartime: Quincy, Illinois and the Civil War."

<BR><BR>

Dawn Hesse was last year's recipient of the James L. Fisher Outstanding
Thesis Award. In completing her master's degree in psychology, Hesse
conducted research regarding the various aspects of childbirth. Her
findings were compiled in her thesis: "Naturalistic Predictors of
Childbirth Pain and Maternal Satisfaction."

<BR><BR>

Boontrakulpoontawee, who is doing postdoctoral work at the University of
Chicago, has made a significant discovery in the field of neurodevelopment.
Biological sciences professor David Borst says her work "tackles one of the
most important and intriguing questions in modern biology, namely the
molecular basis for the development of the nervous system."

<BR><BR>

In his nomination of the dissertation, Borst wrote, "If the central nervous
system can be compared to a complex communication system with an enormous
number of wires, how do these wires get hooked up correctly during
development? While this question is currently intractable in vertebrates,
invertebrates such as Caenorhabditis elegans can offer significant insights
into this question. The simplicity of its nervous system and the existence
of mutant strains with abnormal neural development make this organism a
power model for such studies."

<BR><BR>

Boontrakulpoontawee focused on such a mutant, known as Unc-44, which
results from a defect in a protein known as ankyrin. Using DNA sequencing
of the Unc-44 gene, she analyzed more than 1,400 clones. She identified
several different products of the Unc-44 gene, one of which appears to be
involved in the development of the nervous system.

<BR><BR>

"The results are very exciting and bring us closer to the goal of
understanding the development of the nervous system," Borst said. The value
of her work is evidenced by the fact a portion has been published in the
Journal of Cell Biology.

<BR><BR>

Costigan,  a professor of history at Quincy University, tested in his
doctoral work fundamental assertions about the Civil War by completing a
study of one community during the war years. A longtime resident of Quincy,
he chose that city for his work because of its political importance. At the
time of the war, Quincy was home to Senators Stephen Douglas, William
Richardson, and Orville Browning, who is famed for his diary as a cabinet
member in President Abraham Lincoln's administration.

<BR><BR>

Mark Plummer, chairperson of Costigan's dissertation committee, said his
research "went beyond political events to give us a detailed description
and analysis of military, economic, and social matters. He also gives
special attentionto Quincy's role as a border town to a slave state and
the role of blacks in the city and in the army."

<BR><BR>

The work "provides an innovative and comprehensive review on how such
material can be applied to classroom teaching," Plummer said, calling the
dissertation "an important contribution to our understanding of the
American Civil War."

<BR><BR>

To accomplish the feat, Costigan read every Quincy newspaper printed during
the war and examined all the personal papers of the political figures who
came from the Quincy area during the war years, as well as records from a
number of business concerns, files relating to white-black relations, and
much more.

<BR><BR>

Costigan, whose work is under consideration as a book by several
publishers, has won two National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowships
and earned recognition from Quincy University, where he has been selected
to fill an endowed chair.

<BR><BR>

Hesse, clinical director at the DeWitt County Human Resource Center,
completed a thesis that psychology professor Daniel Graybill describes in
his letter of nomination as "an ambitious effort to try to answer important
questions about childbirth pain and satisfaction by correcting all of the
errors made in previous research."

<BR><BR>

Other studies were limited because they only examined one or two variables
at a time, assessed mothers during childbirth, had multiple measures of
pain and satisfaction, and were statistically analyzed in relatively
unsophisticated ways, Graybill notes. By comparison, Hesse used a
multidimensional assessment of variables related to childbirth pain and
satisfaction, adding physiological, demographic, and environmental
variables to the typical psychological variables explored.

<BR><BR>

In addition, she assessed these variables at three separate times, allowing
for stronger conclusions about the relationship between the variables and
childbirth pain and satisfaction. Hesse analyzed the data in a logical and
conceptual fashion, and she used more than one outcome measure.

<BR><BR>

The comprehensiveness of the study has revealed several relationships
previously unknown. "One of the most interesting was that the factors
affecting childbirth pain and satisfaction were totally different for
first-time and repeat mothers," Graybill said. "An implication from this
finding is that childbirth classes need to emphasize almost completely
different content for these two groups."

<BR><BR>

Already accepted for presentation at the national convention of the
Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy, Hesse's research
findings are expected to benefit many people.

<BR><BR><BR>

The middle-aged man walking in central Seattle  looked like one of the
street hustlers who might steal, sell drugs, or panhandle for enough money
to buy a bottle of cheap wine.

<BR><BR>

A two-day growth of beard masked his face. His jeans were faded and ripped.
His ankle-high boots had badly worn soles and oddly angled heels. His
down-filled vest, smeared with paint, and his 20-year-old hooded parka
appeared to have been retrieved from a Dumpster. His metal-framed
eyeglasses were scratched. His fingernails were unclipped. But his pockets
held a tape recorder, notebooks, and an ample supply of dollar bills
folded several inches thick-all to be used for gathering information.

<BR><BR>

Mark Fleisher had arrived for another day of field research among the
criminals and drug addicts who roam the streets of urban communities
throughout the country.

<BR><BR>

Fleisher is an associate professor of criminal justice sciences at Illinois
State University. Like other scholars in his field, he has compiled an
impressive vita as an academician. He held a faculty position at Washington
State University for 14 years and also was on the anthropology faculty at
Columbia University in his native state of New York before joining Illinois
State in 1993.

<BR><BR>

What sets Fleisher apart in his profession as an anthropologist is the fact
his commitment to his field regularly takes him from the security of
proverbial ivory towers to the uncertainty of the nation's back alleys and
prisons. It's there he studies by observation vices that destroy one of the
country's most vital safety nets-the family.

<BR><BR>

It's not unusual for Fleisher to take on the shabby appearance carefully
chosen as a costume for his Seattle work. The persona allows Fleisher to
blend into the street scene and establish a rapport with individuals who
give him an insider's perspective on criminal be-havior and attitudes. The
interviews he conducts during such research efforts are a vital element of
Fleisher's quest for solutions to street violence in general and growing
gang activity in particular.

<BR><BR>

"I wore street attire, armor protecting me from looking too middle class,
too much like an undercover cop or a social worker, or, worst of all, like
a social scientist," Fleisher explains in Beggars and Thieves: Lives of
Urban Street Criminals, the book that resulted from his firsthand study of
the lives of urban street criminals.

<BR><BR>

Beggars and Thieves was published last winter by the University of Wiscon-
sin Press. The director of the Brookings Institution's Center for Public
Manage-ment, John J. Dilulio Jr., who is also a professor of politics and
public affairs at Princeton University, called Fleisher's book "the most
important study of street criminals published in 20 years."

<BR><BR>

It's not the first time Fleisher has been praised for taking not just bold
but precarious steps in his search for knowledge about the criminal mind.
His expedition has taken him not only across international borders but into
this nation's prison system more than once.

<BR><BR>

Fleisher's journey began in 1970 as a graduate student at Washington State
University under the distinguished anthropologist H. Russell Bernard.
Fleisher's research interest in the culture of crime and violence became
focused when he read a book called You Owe Yourself a Drunk, a study of
urban nomads (also called bums in the book) by James Spradley, a linguistic
anthropologist. Fleisher read the work several times and decided he wanted
to study both cultural and linguistic anthropology, with emphasis on the
family.

<BR><BR>

With that research goal established early in his studies, Fleisher found he
had to immerse himself in the general field of anthropology before he could
study street criminals and their families in depth. He began by exploring
other cultures. "I went to Mexico and lived in a desert," he recalls. "I
joined the Peace Corps and was in Guatemala, did field research in
Indonesia, and was on a couple of Indian reservations on the Northwest
coast."

<BR><BR>

After receiving his doctorate in 1976, he made contacts in the Washington
State Penitentiary and spent five years studying women who married men
already in prison. He observed their family lives and how they reared their
children. The information proved to be valuable for his later work but left
him depressed at the time.

<BR><BR>

"It's a very hard world to be in," Fleisher says. "The men are needy, and
they're violent, and they're manipulative. The women are terribly needy
emotionally, and the more you give the more they want. Finally, I just gave
up on it."

<BR><BR>

But another opportunity to observe prison life from the inside emerged in
1985 at a maximum security federal prison, the U.S. Penitentiary at Lompoc
in Southern California. The prison houses 1,200 men, most with a long
history of violence. The institution was losing correctional staff at a
high rate and wanted an anthropologist to investigate staff stress by
working as a correctional officer. Fleisher took the assignment and became
a certified federal correctional worker. He was treated as an employee with
regular responsibilities, even though he remained a civilian.

<BR><BR>

"I was right there when there was a killing, when there were assaults. I
did interrogations. I actually worked posts. I did what everybody else
does, and I was not a member of the organization. So it was very risky for
them, because had I been hurt it would have set up a difficult situation."

<BR><BR>

His first book, Warehousing Violence, is based on that inside look at
prison life. The book is a study of discipline, violence, and
organizational culture in a maximum security federal prison. "This is the
first time that the Federal Bureau of Prisons has ever allowed anybody to
do this kind of project, and it will never happen again," Fleisher says,
because rules now prohibit such an assignment.

<BR><BR>

With the prison experience as background, Fleisher was ready to go to the
street to see criminals where they live and learn how they act outside the
view of police or judges. It's a world that most researchers never see.
This research, conducted with grants from the U.S. Census Bureau and the
Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, led to his new book, Beggars and
Thieves.

<BR><BR>

"When an adult criminal sits in front of the parole board, he's not going
to present himself as a violent man," Fleisher says. "But when he's on the
street and he's half drunk, or he's angry at his girlfriend, or he's angry
at his girlfriend's kids, he doesn't act like he does when he's sitting in
front of the parole board."

<BR><BR>

Seattle police helped Fleisher make his first contacts with street
criminals. He was with police one night when they arrested a drug supplier
and addict who is known as Popcorn in Beggars and Thieves. Poppin' co'n
(popping corn) is a street expression for running scams or hustles. Popcorn
was proficient at both activities.

<BR><BR>

Popcorn was setenced to 90 days in jail, and Fleisher visited him
regularly. Eventually, Popcorn agreed to introduce Fleisher to drug
dealers, gang members, ex-convicts, and a range of Popcorn's other friends
involved in criminal activity. Popcorn's friends became Fleisher's friends,
so to speak.

<BR><BR>

"Sometimes you get in a really good relationship with somebody on the
street, and they like you, and you like them, and you hit it off," Fleisher
says. "That's exactly the way it was with Popcorn."

<BR><BR>

Popcorn led Fleisher to other hustlers with such street tags as T-Bone,
Pimping Slim, Shy, Miss Ann, Cuzz, Itch, Body Count, School Yard, and Wolf
Man. Once they learned that Fleisher was not a police officer or informant,
they helped him navigate through their complex social networks.

<BR><BR>

"One of the difficult moral issues is, of course, that you have to look
past what people do. Here you have a guy who hits his girlfriends and sells
drugs and doesn't really care who he's selling them to, and I can't make a
judgment about it. That's not my job. My job is to collect information from
as many different kinds of people as I can. So you have to look past all of
that."

<BR><BR>

Those folded dollar bills in Fleisher's jeans were a hook for thirsty,
penniless street hustlers. "A dollar buys enough patience to answer a half
dozen questions," he says. "The trick is in knowing six good questions. On
a good day I would spend $20 to $30 or more buying coffee, donuts, beer,
and wine, and adding to various collections used to buy heroin."

<BR><BR>

Fleisher had ethical concerns about the use of the money, but he realized
that nothing he could do would change the behavior of street criminals. "I
was straight and encouraged them to stay straight too," he says. "What's
more, I worked hard to resist an urge to stop them from doing what they do.
They are alcoholics, drug addicts, and criminals. The decision to remain on
the streets is theirs."

<BR><BR>

The threat of danger was always present, but "the only times on the street
that I ever felt scared were times when I hadto deal with drunks-angry
drunks," Fleisher says. "They were indeed very scary, because I'm not a big
guy. I just hoped I could run fast enough to get away from a stumbling
drunk."

<BR><BR>

As he established rapport with his interview subjects, Fleisher began
developing strong emotional feelings for them, particularly for the
children. "Sometimes you want to put them in your car and bring them home,
but you can't do that. Some of these criminals commit the most heinous
crimes, but I still have to develop a relationship with them. But I don't
want to bring them home. I have nightmares about them."

<BR><BR>

With a second Guggenheim award, Fleisher is doing research for a book that
will examine life in the families of adolescent gang members. He already
has spent many months in Kansas City, hanging around street corners and
gang "houses" with young gang kids and in high crime areas late at night in
order to gain accu-rate descriptions of their lives. Why does he take the
risk?

<BR><BR>

"Because no one else is doing it. It is the underworld, and I love the
risk," he says. "I love the excitement of being there and seeing things
that no one else has seen before."

<BR><BR>

It's because of his unique perspective that Fleisher's research is gaining
national attention. He has been interviewed by reporters in such cities as
Chicago, New York, and Seattle and has been contacted for a possible
appearance on television's syndicated Oprah Winfrey Show.

<BR><BR>

Fleisher uses such opportunities to share his findings and subsequent
suggestions for change that range from the need for national policy
revisions to a closer look at language.

<BR><BR>

Convinced that language has a profound influence on the public perception
of the cultural relationships between parents and children, Fleisher says
that society does a great disservice to children by using words such as
mother, father, or family to describe the
relationships of children and parents in abusive situations.

<BR><BR>

"When I say the word mother, all sorts of things come to mind," Fleisher
says. "You think of mom making cookies, taking care of you, buying clothes,
taking you to the dentist, making sure you get your homework done, tucking
you in bed at night, and giving you a kiss before you go to school. That's
not what happens in the families of adolescent and adult street criminals."

<BR><BR>

Fleisher says the current words disguise the reality of life in neglectful
and violent families.

<BR><BR>

"We have parents who do not take care of their children whatsoever," he
says. "Here are some simple facts: Almost all people who go to prison have
never had medical or dental care; people come out of prison healthier than
when they went in. The average reading level for inmates in the California
Department of Corrections is less than third grade. Now this is not a
school issue; this is a parenting issue. Who's responsible for a child not
learning how to read? Parents!"

<BR><BR>

That's not to imply that Fleisher sees no need for governmental
intervention as well. He is pleased that a growing number of political
leaders are interested in his research, because-based on his years of
personal encounters with criminals and their families-he argues that three
bold new policies would help stem the rise of violent crime in America:

<BR><BR>

1. Take children away from abusive and neglectful households permanently
and place them in small, long-term residential homes regulated by the
federal government and funded with resources reallocated from federal and
state correctional budgets.

<BR><BR>

In Beggars and Thieves, Fleisher opens with a chilling episode: Police are
present when a violent father called Maniac, spewing obscenities, threatens
to beat his three-year-old son, Ace, whose legs are stained with dried
feces from days of neglect. The police know that the child will be beaten
when they leave, but they are powerless to stop it.

<BR><BR>

Fleisher says that children such as Ace who are brutalized by parents like
Maniac inevitably are doomed to live a similar marginal lifestyle and are
likely to become criminals unless they are separated permanently from their
terrible environment. "There are many pathways to crime, but serious,
early-life child abuse is just a freeway to the penitentiary."

<BR><BR>

2. Put violent offenders in maximum security prisons to serve long
sentences without parole and to work full time.

<BR><BR>

"I don't want violent people on the streets, and I don't think we have to
feel guilty for putting violent people in prison," Fleisher says. "And we
should make them work while they are there."

<BR><BR>

California and Oregon have prison industries that manufacture work clothes
for export to Italy, Japan, and other countries. Inmates are paid $6 to $8
an hour and are learning financial responsibility, because their wages are
garnisheed for room, board, and restitution. Work should be required at all
prisons and the profits used to relieve the burden on taxpayers, Fleisher
says.

<BR><BR>

Inmate workers in lower-wage jobs would not compete against union workers,
but instead could be America's labor force competing against Third World
workers, he says.

<BR><BR>

3. Put  nonviolent offenders, including most drug offenders, in residential
homes for short sentences and for full-time work in the community.

<BR><BR>

Work is a key element of the offender's sentence, Fleisher says. "I think
when people commit crimes and violate community rules they have to work. I
mean the kind of work that brings sweat to the brow. I have no qualms with
having people go to the streets to fill potholes, rake leaves, paint
buildings, clean up garbage-do whatever community service is substantive.
Sitting at home with a monitoring bracelet on their ankle just costs money;
it produces nothing."

<BR><BR>

Many of these people would benonviolent drug offenders who now clog an
ever-expanding prison system, which costs billions of tax dollars.

<BR><BR>

"I don't see that the problem of drug use is lessening in America because
we're imprisoning a lot of people for drug use," Fleisher says. "All we're
doing is spending a lot of tax dollars on keeping people in prisons while
we raise tuition at places such as Illinois State University."

<Font size="+2">
<BR>Modems convert data supplied on a computer's system through parallel data paths and 
convert those data into serial data to be placed onto a single transmission path like a 
telephone line.  For long distances, the single transmission path is more practical to use 
than a parallel path consisting of many data lines.  Size and cost of the parallel lines would 
be too restrained for long-distance connections.
<P><A HREF="http://www.ora.com/reference/dictionary/terms/U/Universal_Asynchronous_Receiver_Transmitter.htm">UART</A>
 and USART are medium-scale integrated circuit package.  They are receiving stations 
that convert parallel-to-serial or serial-to-parallel.  This means that if the data is parallel, 
the conversion process and the rates are sent to the <A HREF="http://www.ora.com/reference/dictionary/terms/U/Universal_Asynchronous_Receiver_Transmitter.htm">UART</A>.  
The USART and the rate, at which 
is turned into serial data, is sent and received which is controlled by the computer system to where 
the <A HREF="http://www.ora.com/reference/dictionary/terms/U/Universal_Asynchronous_Receiver_Transmitter.htm">UART</A>
 and USART are connected.
<P>They also perform other required tasks besides serial-to-parallel.  One task is 
morse code, for example.  This development of coded data from the simple dots and dashes 
uses character codes transferred through the telephone system required those character codes 
to go through many transformations.  It first leaves the terminal in parallel format and fed 
to a UART.  Extra bits are then added in the <A HREF="http://www.ora.com/reference/dictionary/terms/U/Universal_Asynchronous_Receiver_Transmitter.htm">UART</A>
 to frame the characters and perform error 
detection or <A HREF="http://www.ora.com/reference/dictionary/terms/P/Parity.htm">parity</A>.  
The data is then shifted out of the <A HREF="http://www.ora.com/reference/dictionary/terms/U/Universal_Asynchronous_Receiver_Transmitter.htm">UART</A>
 in serial form to a modem.  The modem then translates 
the binary data into pairs of sine wave signals that can be sent on the telephone lines to a 
remote sight.  The receiver end is just converted back into parallel character codes for display.
<HR>

<A HREF="http://www.ora.com/reference/dictionary/terms/U/Universal_Asynchronous_Receiver_Transmitter.htm">UART</A>
 (<B>U</B>niversal <B>A</B>synchronous <B>R</B>eceiver/<B>T</B>ransmitter)
<BR>UART accepts the parallel data information and converts it into a serial data stream.  
Asynchronous start and stop framing bits and a parity bit are added by the UART to the data 
stream.  For the receiving side, the UART detects the presence of a start bit and reads in 
the serial stream.  Data is then converted back to parallel form and checked for errors. 
Parallel data is presented out on the data lines from the UART to the 
<A HREF="http://www.ora.com/reference/dictionary/terms/D/Data_Terminal_Equipment.htm">DTE</A> 
(DATA TERMINAL EQUIPMENT) data bus.
<BR>For telephone lines, they carry audio signals, which convert to the serial data stream 
leaving the UART from digital form to analog form at the transmitter and return to digital at 
the receiving side of a UART.

<P><B>USART</B> (<B>U</B>niversal <B>S</B>ynchronous/<B>A</B>synchronous <B>R</B>eceiver/<B>T</B>ransmitter)
<BR>USART is designed to be used with microprocessor-based computer systems.  An example 
of an USART using an 8-bit data bus provides an information path to pass control, status, 
and message information to the CPU (central processing unit) of the system and the USART.  
The control information is used to configure and direct the operation of the USART.
<BR>Interface signals are used by the system to access the USART and control the flow of 
message data between the CPU and the USART.
<HR>

<B>RS232C</B>
<BR>	The rs stands for <B>r</B>ecommended <B>s</B>tandard.  
<BR>	def. - recommended interfacing standard between terminals and modems.  This is used for a variety of electronics and electrical applications.
<BR>	Most widely used standard.
<BR>	Designates the physical connector type used, which is the electrical characteristics, and functions of the signals applied to the lines of the interconnect cabling.
<HR>

<B>RS449</B>
<BR>	This standard contains most of the signal lines and electrical specifications outlined in the RS232C.
<HR>

<B>RS422 and RS423</B>
<BR>	These are two standards that specify electrical and mechanical requirements for interconnecting ANY two circuits used for tranferring serial data.
<P>RS422 is used for balanced circuits.  Balanced networks generate two outputs that are the opposite of one another.  If there are two outputs, the voltage of each output can be measured in relation to a common reference point, like a signal ground.  The full output is measured differentially between both outputs in the end.
<BR>	These networks are also used to assist in the elimination of noise experienced on the lines 
between the generator and the receiver units.
<BR>	Another area specified by RS422 is the length of the cable between the generator and receiver.  
This specifies the capacitance/ft as the limiting factor to a cable's length rather than attempting to specify actual lengths.
<P>RS423 is used for unbalanced circuits.  The output of this circuit is taken from a single output with reference to a common return, like a ground.  
<BR>	Noise on one output is approximately the difference between noise levels and it is negligible.  The reduction in noise power, called common-mode rejection, results in less noise presented to the receiver from the generator.

<P>Let's talk about me, shall we!?!  I currently attend<IMG SRC="reggie.gif">Illinois State University.  I am a multimedia developer in a macintosh environment.  I play the violin in the ISU Symphany Orchestra and also take private lessons.  Even though I am limited on time for practicing my violin, I enjoy it tremendously.  I also perform magic shows once in awhile for small parties or picnics of all sorts!  My major is currently in Applied Computer Science with a Telecommunications sequence.  I have a magnificient amount of fun learning all the multimedia tricks and gadgets!  (You can probably tell with all my web pages I design.)  (:  I have been in college for 3 1/2 years and still have another 1 1/2 years to get my bacholars degree.  That is, IF I ever make it...

<P>You're probably wondering why I am called Lizard huh?!  Well, it all started way back in the 8th.  I ran track for the first time in my life and it ends up that I was SOO fast that they nicknamed me lizard.  I went to state in the 4 x 100!  Then as I approached high school, I have been kept that name.  I ended up running track for all 4 years and cross country for 3 years.  Also, during the first two years of college, I ran for a scholarship for 1 1/2 at <A HREF="http://kashmir.parkland.cc.il.us/">Parkland Community College</A>.  Another reason for my nick is that my dad started me into performing magic.!  I now do shows for kids once in awhile and I am announced as "Lizard the Wizard"!  So, that's why I have that nick.

<P><B>Description</B>:  Rantoul, Illinois is a rural commmunity with many of the attributes found only in much larger communiies. From 1917 until September, 1993 Chanute AFB was the largest employer. Chanute's closure in 1993 made over 2000 acres available for industrial, commercial, and residential uses to enhance the viability of the community. Re-use is well underway. Rantoul is endowed with a combination of superb characteristics that provide valuable options. Its geographic centrality, transportation, labor force, cost of living, and general quality of life make it a strong contender for light industry. An excellent education system, low crime rate and an excellent variety of housing make Rantoul a great place to live and raise a family.<BR><BR>

<P>Area residents benefit from the <A HREF="http://www.uiuc.edu/">University of Illinois</A> and <A HREF="http://kashmir.parkland.cc.il.us/">Parkland College</A> in nearby <A HREF="http://www.prairienet.org/SiliconPrairie/ccnet.html">Champaign</A> -- <A HREF="http://www.buyersusa.com/nqc/cities/il/chamber/5845.htm">Urbana</A>.

<TITLE>Big Futures for Small</TITLE>

<B><H1>BIG FUTURE FOR SMALL BUSINESS</H1></B>

<BR>

by Mary Wright

</CENTER>

<BR><BR><BR>

"Using the term 'small business' can be misleading," says Mike Winchell,
now in his fifth year as director of Illinois State University's Small
Business Institute (SBI). "People hear it, and they think in terms of one
or two people; but the government's definition of a small business is one
having fewer than 500 employees, which means a lot of 'small' businesses
aren't really small in terms of people or dollars."

<BR><BR>

Winchell has spent all of his academic and most of his professional career
at Illinois State. He joined the Department of Business Education and
Administrative Services in the University's College of Business in 1974,
moving into the Department of Management and Quantitative Methods and the
directorship of the SBI in 1991.

<BR><BR>

The Small Business Institute program was developed by academics and the
United States Small Business Administration (SBA) in the 1970s to give
business majors the opportunity to combine their theoretical knowledge with
hands-on business experience, while providing a service to small
businesses. The program was established at Illinois State in 1976.

<BR><BR>

SBI is now a nationwide program in which nearly 300 colleges and
universities take part. The SBA provided most of the original funding for
the program and continues to be a major contributor, along with the schools
involved, public and private grants, and private industry.

<BR><BR>

SBI requires that students in the program be senior or graduate students
majoring in business. Students are divided into consulting teams of three
or four individuals, with each team being assigned a local small business
that has approached SBI for counseling to improve its management.

<BR><BR>

"The program is beneficial for both SBI and the small businesses that take
part," says Winchell. "The businesses get the counseling at little or no
cost-a typical charge would be less than $300, if they are charged at
all-and our students get experience solving problems in the real business
world."

<BR><BR>

More than 1,000 students have completed the University's SBI program since
its inception. Winchell, assisted by Professors Lee Graf and Masoud
Hemmasi, oversees some 70 students and their small business field projects
each year.

<BR><BR>

"In a traditional case study of a business, an SBI consulting team meets
with a small business owner to define the focus of the project. Then the
team and business owner meet on a regular basis, during which time the
students study the business's procedures, collect data, analyze problems,
and make written and oral recommendations."

<BR><BR>

SBI teams also conduct what Winchell calls "town studies," in which members
of a consulting team work for a term with a small town in developing its
economic base. Deer Creek in Central Illinois was the subject of a recent
town study.

<BR><BR>

"The team would assess the attractiveness of a small town from the business
standpoint," says Winchell. "Does it have an ATM, a dentist, a grocery
store? The students gather and analyze data, then make recommendations on
how to expand the community's economic development."

<BR><BR>

Students in the program also have served as interns in various
Bloomington-Normal small businesses.

<BR><BR>

"SBI also has undertaken special projects for the community at large, such
as developing an advertising program for the McLean County Fair and working
with the McLean County Human Relations Commission on developing a minority
small business expo in 1994," says Winchell. "That effort established the
expo as a place for minority owners of small businesses to attend workshops
on improving their businesses and as a venue for exhibiting their products
and services."

<BR><BR>

The institute has not restricted its field projects to the United States.
In a U.S.-Canada-Mexico international business project teams of students
worked with companies in one of the three countries doing businessacross
national borders.

<BR><BR>

"In one project undertaken in this trilateral business project, two
Canadian students worked with a U.S. firm to help it penetrate the Canadian
market," Winchell says. "Other teams concentrated on developing the export
ability of small businesses in the United States that were seeking to
export since the changes made by NAFTA [North American Free Trade
Agreement]. The SBI teams went in and did core analyses to evaluate their
readiness to export and the most appropriate ways for them to do it."

<BR><BR>

What does Winchell-who has received two national awards for teaching
excellence plus the SBA's District Director's Service Award-envision for
the future of SBI? "I'd like to see the establishment of an institute for
entrepreneurial studies at Illinois State in the next five years.

<BR><BR>

"National statistics suggest that in the near future 80 percent of all new
nonagricultural jobs will be in the small business area," says Winchell,
whose research has been featured in many professional publications and
cited by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. "So the need for students to
have entrepreneurial studies like those available in SBI is more necessary
than ever.

<BR><BR>

"The days of starting with one company and staying until retirement are
past," he says. "We have to be thinking of alternatives for the young and
the not so young."

<TITLE> From the Provost </TITLE>

<BODY>

<CENTER>

<B><H1>FROM THE PROVOST</H1></B>

</CENTER>

<BR><BR>

In 1967, shortly before becoming the 10th president of Illinois State
University, Samuel E. Braden said, "Let us then resolve, as individuals and
as a corporate body, that what we in Illinois State University consider to
be worth doing, we will do well." The spirit of Braden's charge is alive in
1996, as demonstrated by the outstanding scholars featured in this issue of
Illinois State Scholar. Their achievements span a broad spectrum of
academic disciplines. Some of them give expression to creative voices and
enhance appreciation of the arts, humanities, and sciences. Others address
pressing social issues and seek to strengthen the University's ties to the
community. All are equally dedicated to creative intellectual inquiry that
benefits the students of Illinois State through classroom instruction and
collaborative research or artistry.

<BR><BR>

Professor Randy Reinholz links native playwrights with theatre students and
faculty in "Native Voices: A Festival of Native Plays," the first project
of its kind nationally. Distinguished Professor Emeritus Roque Cordero
continues to combine his passion for music composition and instruction for
the benefit of students and the international music community. Dr. Lucia
Getsi, Distinguished Professor of English, inspires her own students and
young students from throughout the state with poetry that resulted in her
receiving the 1995 Governor's Award for the Arts for Individual Artists and
other major awards. Dr. Roger Anderson, Distinguished Professor of
Biological Sciences, encourages students to conserve the Illinois prairie,
not only as a living laboratory, but as a window on Illinois's past. Dr.
Mark Fleisher's research on gang violence and the urban family informs his
classroom instruction and influences social policy. Two scholars from the
Department of Curriculum and Instruction, Drs. Norvella Carter and Marilyn
Moore, seek to motivate and prepare aspiring teachers through a mentorship
program intended to remove perceptual barriers about minority students that
prevent the aspiring teachers from seeking positions in urban schools. At
the Small Business Institute, Dr. Mike Winchell gives business majors
opportunities to link their theoretical knowledge with practical
experience.

<BR><BR>

The University is equally proud of its student scholars. This year's
student scholar, Dawn Hesse, was awarded the James L. Fisher Outstanding
Thesis Award upon the completion of a master's degree in psychology. In
addition, up to two students may receive the Clarence W. Sorenson
Distinguished Dissertation Award. The recipients are David Costigan,
history, and Pratumtip Boontrakulpoontawee, biological sciences. Each of
these students is dedicated to scholarship of the highest quality and
epitomizes the excellence of students at Illinois State.

<BR><BR>

The individuals profiled herein share the values that have long been a part
of this university. Undergraduate and graduate education remain the
foundations of the University's mission. They are supported by the pillars
of research, teaching, and creative endeavor-the essence of the meaning of
the term scholar. With this issue of Illinois State Scholar, it is a
pleasure to acquaint you with those who are exemplary in accomplishing
Samuel Braden's charge-what they consider to be worth doing, they do very
well, indeed.

<BR><BR><BR>

<B><H1>TALL GRASS PRAIRIES</H1>

<H3>From 22 million acres to just 2,200 acres</H3></B>

<BR>

by Marcus Agatucci

</CENTER>

<BR><BR><BR>

Roger Anderson is perhaps best known outside academia in general and the
Illinois State University campus community in particular as the man with
the matches, a burner of brush, the torcher of terra firma.

<BR><BR>

In fact, there is a memorable color photograph of him-almost gleefully
igniting a midwestern prairie-that appeared on the front page of his
hometown newspaper in Bloomington-Normal, Illinois, a few years ago.

<BR><BR>

"People probably think I do it for fun, and I do," Anderson admits with a
shy grin on his lips and a gleam in his eye. "But I also do it for solid
scientific and ecological reasons: It helps control woody plant invasion,
it helps control exotic species, and it increases the productivity of the
prairie."

<BR><BR>

And, if there is a plant ecologist anywhere who knows what he or she is
talking about when it comes to prairies and burning same, it is Anderson, a
Distinguished Professor of Biological Sciences at Illinois State since 1994
and a faculty member since 1976. For most of his professional life he has
focused his attention on the nearly extinct tallgrass prairies that once
blanketed the nation's heartland.

<BR><BR>

Growing up in a Wisconsin paper mill town, he was captivated as a child by
the outdoors and the wonders of nature, developing a passion and-more
important-a respect for both; but the road to professional success was long
and arduous.

<BR><BR>

As one of the first members of his family to complete high school and goon
to college, Anderson found it necessary to work to pay for his higher
education, because his family was without the resources to finance his
dream. He labored at a variety of odd jobs, some of which were arranged for
him by his former college football coach, for whom he played starting
tackle-at 175 pounds, no less!

<BR><BR>

Anderson's determination and self-discipline paid off handsomely, however,
as he graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in biology
teacher education from Wisconsin State College at LaCrosse in 1963,
although he began his college studies as a botany major. Just two years
later he earned a Master of Science and three years after that a doctorate,
both from the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

<BR><BR>

But the road leading to a career of accomplishment and acclaim at Illinois
State was circuitous, taking him first to Southern Illinois University at
Carbondale, back to the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he served
as director of the arboretum and as an associate professor, and then to
Central State University at Edmond, Oklahoma, with stops along the way as a
visiting professor at the University of Oklahoma and the Michigan
Biological Stations.

<BR><BR>

During the early years of his teaching career, Anderson was instrumental in
establishing the tropical biology course of the Associated Universities of
International Education that was offered between 1970 and 1976 in Belize,
the Central American country formerly known as British Honduras. He also
was among the first ecologists to document the importance of vegetative
propagation for forest herbaceous plants and the infrequency of
reproduction by seed for these species.

<BR><BR>

Among Anderson's scholarly contributions to a better understanding of
tallgrass prairies is a map of the historical distribution of such prairies
in Illinois, prairies that were dominated by 10- to 12-foot-tall native
grasses such as big bluestem and Indian grass. The map is widely used in
research and teaching throughout the nation and is generally considered by
his peers to be the best of its kind.

<BR><BR>

"Tallgrass prairies once covered 60 percent of the state, or about 22
million acres," Anderson explains. "Today only about 2,200 acresremain."
It was John Deere's invention of the plow and the subsequent cultivation of
Illinois's thick, rich soil beginning in the mid-19th century that sounded
the death knell for the prairies, he notes, adding succinctly, "Prairie
plants don't like to be tilledand turned."

<BR><BR>

It is Anderson's research throughout the years-which always involves his
students in both the field and the lab-that has added immeasurably to the
body of scientific knowledge about tallgrass prairies, their role in
producing some of the world's most fertile soil, and the effect of fire on
them.

<BR><BR>

For example, his research shows that burned landscapes can produce about
twice as much biomass, or living plant material, as unburned landscapes.
"When litter [dead, dry vegetation] is burned, inorganic chemicals are
released," Anderson explains. "Think of it as fertilizer. Indirectly this
puts nitrogen into the soil, which makes plants grow better."

<BR><BR>

As for the fires themselves (for which he is renowned throughout the
Bloomington-Normal area), Anderson says that most of those that roared
across historical tallgrass prairies apparently were started by native
Americans rather than by lightning, which usually would have been
accompanied by rain that would quickly extinguish any naturally ignited
blazes. According to him, native Americans may have torched prairies for
cultural reasons or to drive game toward waiting hunters, but he also
believes they probably "knowingly used fire as a management tool to enhance
the habitat for the animals they hunted, such as buffalo and elk."

<BR><BR>

Anderson, a fellow of the Illinois Academy of Science, says historical
prairies were home to as many as 850 to 900 species of plants such as big
bluestem, which once covered 60 percent of Illinois; however, although most
of those species have survived, they now are found only in isolated, widely
scattered populations.

<BR><BR>

"You may find in undisturbed areas such as railroad rights-of-way big
bluestem, Indian grass, and one or two other species, but not that rich
mixture of species that was part of the tallgrass prairie," he explains.
"What I'm saying is the individual species are here, but you don't have the
whole prairie. You find some here, some there, but the whole complement is
not represented very well."

<BR><BR>

Among the few hundred acres of remaining prairies in Illinois, some of the
best examples of tallgrass prairies are the old, pioneer cemeteries
established by European settlers, who fenced them off and-in many
cases-mowed them annually, thereby removing excess biomass and ensuring
their survival intact, Anderson says.

<BR><BR>

Today, ecologists such as Anderson study prairies because they are
interesting and esthetically appealing, he says, and because the public
wants to know more about them for the same reasons. "The remaining prairies
provide a window to our past, to our biological heritage," he explains.
"Through this window an increasing number of Illinoisans are gaining a
vision of [their state's] original landscape. The public has become
increasingly involved in preserving remaining prairies and restoring
others. They often lead the way."

<BR><BR>

Although Anderson is as intent as anyone on preserving the few tallgrass
prairies that remain-for the knowledge they offer him and his fellow
scientists and for the pleasure they bring to the city folk and others who
visit them-he is pragmatic enough to recognize that the large-scale
disappearance of such prairies was a trade-off for farmland needed to feed
a hungry and rapidly growing nation.

<BR><BR>

As western expansion increased and railroads were built to haul crops grown
on former prairies to voracious urban markets, the tallgrass prairies of
Illinois disappeared quickly, Anderson explains. In effect, the fertile
soil of the prairies was their undoing.

<BR><BR>

But cultivation of the prairies precipitated more than just their
destruction; it resulted in the loss of priceless topsoil through erosion,
erosion that reached catastrophic proportions in the 1970s as high as 20 to
40 tons per acre per year, according to Anderson. "The question is are
there places where we should keep some kind of native vegetation because
[the land] is susceptible to erosion, and the answer is yes. We need to do
more in identifying those sites where agriculture shouldn't go, because
they're not going to be sustained the way we're doing it now with row
crops."

<BR><BR>

In addition to prairie preservation, Anderson is equally committed to
restoring lost prairies when and where feasible, because, he says, they are
important in soil formation, because prairie plants may be sources of vital
chemicals, and because prairies harbor plants that may
haveas-yet-undetermined genetic value. "For those reasons it is important
to restore landscapes. If you can put them back into a natural system, it
protects them and increases the biological diversity of the areas. All
these things are important."

<BR><BR>

In working toward prairie preservation and restoration, Anderson-who has
authored 86 refereed articles, 85 abstracts of presented papers, four book
chapters, and one textbook-often finds himself on committees, commissions,
and boards as well as presenting papers at national and international
symposia, delivering public lectures, and conducting nature walks.

<BR><BR>

He served two three-year terms on the Illinois Nature Preserves Commission
at the behest of former Illinois governor James Thompson, was one of the
organizers of a 1990 symposium on the mycorrhizal ecology of grasslands at
the eighth North American Conference on Mycorrhizae, and is a member of the
editorial board of the influential Journal of Restoration Ecology.

<BR><BR>

From 1986 to 1994 Anderson was a member of the Fermilab Environmental
Advisory Committee, serving as its chairperson from 1990 until the end of
his membership. He also chaired the steering committee of the North
American Conference on Savannas and Barrens, which convened at Illinois
State in 1994. "The word chairperson does not do justice to the level of
leadership Roger brought to that important conference," says Carleton
Phillips II, chairperson of the University's Department of Biological
Sciences.

<BR><BR>

Anderson's research-which, in addition to tallgrass prairies, has included
studies with his students of the life his-tories of American ginseng,
introduced garlic mustard, and eastern gamagrass as well as allelopathy,
gradient analysis, and pollination and germination ecology-has been funded
by the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Illinois Departments of
Conservation, Transportation, Energy, and Natural Resources.

<BR><BR>

Within the Department of Biological Sciences, Anderson-who has directed the
research of 16 master's and two doctoral candidates-has been honored by his
colleagues with a rating of "exceptionally meritorious" for the past 18
years. He was named a College of Arts and Sciences Lecturer in 1985 and an
Outstanding College and University Researcher in 1991. "Everything he does,
he does well," Phillips adds. "He is the kind of faculty member everyone
likes to have in their department."

<BR><BR>

Although his impeccable reputation is secure, Anderson-modest and
self-effacing man that he is-says he would like to be remembered as a good
and helpful teacher, as someone who had a vision to which students could
relate, and as someone who made an important contribution to his profession
and to his community about "how our world is put together and how things
work."

<BR><BR>

Reflecting on his work in prairie preservation and restoration and on the
lessons to be learned from prairies lost and those remaining, Anderson
expresses the hope that future generations will have a greater sensitivity
to their environment than their forebears and recognize that humans are
dependent on the earth and its ecosystems for their existence.

<BR><BR>

"Although some people talk about preserving other species, it really is our
own preservation that we need to look at the most," says the man of fire.
"We have to look upon ourselves as being part of the land and not apart
from the land. We have a stewardship role; and, if we destroy the systems
that maintain us, we aren't living up to that stewardship responsibility.

<BR><BR>

"Future generations will look upon the efforts of today's conservationists
and judge our vision of the future. As the native American woman Mary
Laronde said, 'This land belongs to all our people, some living, some dead,
but most yet unborn."

<B><H1>A BRIGHTER FUTURE</H1></B>

<B><H3>Meeting the needs of urban schools</H3></B>
<BR>
by Susan Marquardt Blystone

</CENTER>

<BR><BR><BR>

The third graders at Betsy Ross and  George Swift Elementary Schools in
Chicago listen intently to their teacher, following the day's lesson with
eager eyes that give a glimpse of each child's determination to get good
grades.

<BR><BR>

Reminded regularly that it is only with those high marks that they can
reach the goal of attending college, the youngsters faithfully take home
their texts and struggle to look beyond the pages to capture a dream they
can't fully comprehend and, too often, do not claim as their own.

<BR><BR>

Sitting in a lecture hall 150 miles south of the two Chicago schools,
students at Illinois State University prepare to stand in the front of a
classroom themselves someday. They anxiously anticipate their opportunity
to shape children's lives, looking ahead with excitement to the day they
complete a teaching degree and become a role model for elementary school
youngsters. Their dream is to inspire a love of learning in children-but
usually not those found in urban schools like Betsy Ross and George Swift.

<BR><BR>

Illinois State College of Education professors Norvella Carter and Marilyn
Moore understand why their protgs rarely contemplate an urban school
position when searching for a starting point in their profession. They know
from their experiences with students that sitting behind the teacher's desk
initially brings ample anxieties without overcoming apprehensions about
cultural barriers.

<BR><BR>

But they also know from their years of work in urban classrooms that the
future will never become brighter for urban children if tomorrow's teachers
avoid schools where it's not uncommon for youngsters to sometimes abandon
academic pursuits they deem futile.

<BR><BR>

Convinced that avoidance is often rooted in a lack of knowledge and
misperceptions, Carter and Moore have developed a research project that
teaches their education majors they can find fulfillment in urban schools.
At the same time, their Multicultural Mentorship Project (MMP) provides the
guidance children need to instill confidence in their ability to succeed
academically and begin charting their collegiate course.

<BR><BR>

As Carter and Moore explain in their project's abstract, the overall aim of
MMP is to "provide concrete experiences that will encourage children in
urban, multicultural areas to see, experience, and desire college as part
of their future. This objective is fulfilled through an interpersonal
mentoring program that commits education majors to provide a combination of
tutoring, weekly telephone calls, letters, field trips, activities, and
campus visits for children and their parents.

<BR><BR>

"The project is called multicultural because the children and college
students participating are from many different cultures. It is considered a
mentorship because the college students give the children time, academic
instruction, friendship, advice, interaction, a positive role model, and
emotional support."

<BR><BR>

The two professors are equally excited about a second aspect of the project
that focuses on expanding the horizons of education majors. The project has
been designed to determine if such a mentorship relationship at the
undergraduate level will change the attitudes of teachers in training,
preparing them not only to work effectively in diverse classrooms but
ultimately to seek employment in an urban school.

<BR><BR>

Moore, associate professor of curriculum and instruction, knows the project
will benefit her Illinois State students because it is exactly what she
needed as she started her career. "When I student taught I didn't feel at
all prepared for urban schools. I was almost to the point of wanting to
quit teaching," she says, recalling tackling the task without the benefit
of a support network or prior teaching experience.

<BR><BR>

Realizing her career options were limited, Moore persevered and went on to
complete her doctorate in early childhood education at Northern Illinois
University. She taught in urban schools early in her career and joined
Illinois State in 1989.

<BR><BR>

A few years later Moore aligned with Carter, who came to Illinois State in
1991 as assistant professor of curriculum and instruction. Having completed
her doctorate in curriculum and human resource development at Loyola
University, Carter started at Illinois State with the purpose of opening up
the Chicago area to Illinois State education majors and served as director
of the University's Chicago Metropolitan Teacher Education Center in
Deerfield.

<BR><BR>

With the center operational, the two educators began working together on
consulting projects, in-service seminars, and summer institutes in
Chicago-area schools. They soon realized they shared the same concern for
preparing urban teachers, despite the fact they brought different
perspectives to the problem.

<BR><BR>

For although Moore's background exposed her to the needs of novice
teachers, Carter's experiences reinforced the value of having an example at
an early age. It was because Carter saw teachers revered in her own
segregated neighborhood that she chose the career for herself as a young
girl. "In African-American communities, teaching was the ultimate
profession," she says. "I knew I wanted to teach when I was in
kindergarten. I never considered anything else."

<BR><BR>

Today, Moore and Carter are convinced teachers need even more exposure to
urban school settings, and the youth need even stronger role models. For
example, they note that urban school districts now account for more than 50
percent of the total school districts and teaching population in the United
States. Schools in urban areas that have high levels of poverty produce low
percentages of college-bound students. And yet, Moore laments, "There are
few Illinois State student teachers in Chicago. Historically, our presence
has not been there.

<BR><BR>

"Illinois State prepares one of every six teachers in the state of
Illinois. If we're not preparing teachers for Chicago, who is?" Moore asks.
She emphasizes that although there is a "severe teacher shortage in
Chicago," the need for teachers who can work comfortably with students of
all races is national. Administrators in other major urban areas such as
Los Angeles and New York are also searching for teachers who have more than
just a solid educational background. They recruit individuals whose comfort
level and confidence don't waiver as the classroom demographics continue to
shift.

<BR><BR>

Carter and Moore know instilling these characteristics in tomorrow's
teachers is an increasingly critical aspect of meeting the needs of urban
schools. Teachers with such traits are equipped to nurture the talent in
urban children who are battling peer pressure far greater than that of past
decades.

<BR><BR>

"Children have been identified as college bound or having the potential to
succeed in college as early as the third grade," Carter says.
Unfortunately, she reports, third and fourth grades are also the optimum
time for children to lose focus on academic pursuits.

<BR><BR>

"For these children, everyone talks about getting good grades to go to
college," Carter says. "Yet many of these children have never been to a
college campus and cannot visualize what going to college really means as
part of their future."

<BR><BR>

Realizing that many children in urban areas can be pressured by their peers
to reject academic achievement and college as socially or culturally
unrealistic at such a young age, they specifically targeted their
mentorship program to children in the third grade. "Eight is a good time to
let them see higher education at work," Carter says.

<BR><BR>

She and Moore built the project by drawing from each other's areas of
expertise. Moore, a recent College of Education Outstanding Teacher Award
recipient, has devoted her professional career to researching child
development from conception through adolescence and early childhood
education theory and practice. Her work complements the expertise of
Carter, whose teaching experiences in Detroit schools and international
research on urban teaching issues has made her a recognized urban education
specialist.

<BR><BR>

Together they toiled for more than two years to develop the Multicultural
Mentorship Project. They studied a similar effort undertaken by a
colleague, Patricia Larke, at Texas A & M University and made adaptations
necessary to overcome the complications of managing a program implemented
two hours from the Illinois State campus. The hurdle is overcome with the
help of graduate student Desmonmyawn Brown and undergraduate research
assistant Anna Lee. They complete the entire administrative team for the
endeavor, which is codirected by Moore and Carter.

<BR><BR>

They manage the project that they designed to follow a three-prong
approach. The program is intended to "reshape thinking and attitudes in
children through an intervention that will incite new incentive to learn
and achieve in school; work with and motivate supportive parents who view
higher education for their child as desirable yet unreachable because of
their socioeconomic circumstances; and utilize cross-cultural mentoring as
the vehicle of personal influence, because college students from other
cultures and experiences can share a dimension of life that gives the
children a college vision for the future."

<BR><BR>

On one level the project operates very simply, as 28 undergraduate students
in Illinois State's early childhood, elementary, and junior high/middle
school programs are chosen through an interview process to mentor
African-American, Asian, Hispanic, and native American children. They build
a rapport with the student they are mentoring and his or her parents. If
they fail to keep their commitment in establishing a relationship with the
child and family, they are eliminated from the program.

<BR><BR>

The Illinois State students are instructed to constantly share their
academic experiences at the University with the students they are
mentoring, reinforcing the study involved as well as the opportunities
enjoyed on campus. In addition to their mentoring tasks, the undergraduates
meet with Carter and Moore at least monthly as a group for training and
discussion of urban education issues.

<BR><BR>

"They are learning how to interact in an urban environment," Carter says.
"There is a lot they need to know and social interactions they need to
practice before they go into the profession."

<BR><BR>

From the mentored student's perspective, the program goes beyond the
Chicago adventures that include trips to museums, the theatre, and
restaurants to the capstone experience that occurs during a weekend trip to
the Illinois State campus. Each child and a parent complete a three-day
stay that gives the family a positive view of what can be experienced
during college life. The visit allows the children to explore their
mentor's world and builds their enthusiasm by giving a glimpse of college
life that makes the child's dream more tangible. At the same time, the
parents are provided academic and financial aid counseling to introduce
college preparation strategies.

<BR><BR>

"The highlight is having the parents on campus," Moore says, describing the
weekend as "an emotional experience. They feel displaced when they get
here. Many have never been to Central Illinois and don't know the services
that exist for their children at the University."

<BR><BR>

The children have been in the program since its start as a pilot project in
1994. Moore and Carter chose Chicago as the base for their research because
they had already established strong relationships with system
administrators.

<BR><BR>

 "The schools trusted us and were very anxious to work with Illinois State
University," Carter says. Funding was obtained from Betsy Ross and George
Swift Schools for the initial year of the project, with the College of
Education now offering financial support until additional grant money can
be obtained.

<BR><BR>

 Carter and Moore turned to the schools' staff to identify the 28
elementary children they deemed had the potential to succeed in college as
well as the parental support that is critical so that participation in the
program is consistent and benefits can be maximized.

<BR><BR>

Tracking those benefits is the aspect of the program that, no doubt,
escapes most of the participants yet is most critical to Carter and Moore,
who have designed the project to be a longitudinal study. Their hope is
that as the students mature and enter their junior and senior high school
years they will be mentored by Illinois State students preparing to teach
that age level, with a second group started at the elementary level.

<BR><BR>

This approach is intended to guarantee that the same children remain in the
program until they graduate from high school. By following the students'
footsteps, Moore and Carter will know what percentage of the mentored
students actually continue to the collegiate level.

<BR><BR>

The study will reveal if the early intervention provided by the mentors
influenced the children's decision to pursue a college education. Moore
explains that a series of pre- and posttesting will be done to determine
personalities and how children envision themselves in the classroom and to
identify changes that may occur as a result of the mentorship program.

<BR><BR>

"We are testing to see how they view themselves in the academic world, to
see if they see themselves as having potential, and if they feel they can
make a difference in their own choices in their world," Moore says. "We
will compare the results with another group of children to see if we can
make a difference."

<BR><BR>

At the same time, Carter explains, the mentors will be tested with a
similar "perceived personality characteristic inventory" before they enter
the program and periodically during their involvement. Data collection will
also include journal reflections of the participants, interviews, and
recorded observations. "We will look to see if their attitudes and beliefs
are changing," Carter says.

<BR><BR>

She and Moore explain in their project abstract that they expect the
outcome of the research to foster insight into "perceptual and attitudinal
changes in preservice teachers. It is also expected that the dynamics and
complexities involved in creating perceptual and attitudinal changes will
emerge."

<BR><BR>

Already they have witnessed some of the transformation they hope will
continue to evolve from the program. Carter explains that the Illinois
State students coming into the program initially were convinced Chicago's
urban schools were a war zone nestled in urban blight and failed to realize
Chicago has "some of the best schools in the country." They viewed the
children in the city's schools as poor and in need of their help to build
self-esteem. After exposure to the youngsters and their world, they
described the children as smart, friendly, and energetic.

<BR><BR>

Carter sees such a transition as not only encouraging but essential for
creating successful urban classroom environments. "The mark of every good
teacher is having high expectations," she says. "We're trying to say it
doesn't matter what socioeconomic culture you're teaching in: Have high
expectations."

<BR><BR>

Developing that mind-set isn't an easy task for many of the mentors, who,
Moore says, go through a period of cultural adjustment. For although some
students in the program come right out of the neighborhoods they are
working in, others have never been to Chicago. Some never met a student of
color before they came to Illinois State, and most are not accustomed to
finding themselves in the minority, which is a reversal they experience in
their first outing with the children.

<BR><BR>

The mentors realize the rewards of leaving their comfort zone, however, as
one has already accepted a teaching position in the Chicago school system,
and a waiting list now exists for students hoping to obtain a mentorship
assignment.

<BR><BR>

It's such positive results that keep Carter and Moore motivated to continue
their project and reinforces the practical value of such research. They
will use their results to alter their own teacher education curriculum.

<BR><BR>

"It's research such as this that helps to improve what we're doing for the
future," Carter says. "If we're not going to find out what the needs are
and what works best to meet those needs, we're not going to improve."

<hr width="100%" ><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b><tt>DESCRIPTION</tt></b>
</p>

<p><tt>Dexfenfluramine, an anti-obesity drug, is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor
and releasing agent. The active ingredient is dexfenfluramine
hydrochloride. </tt>
<br></p>

<p><tt>Dexfenfluramine hydrochloride, a white to off-white crystalline
powder, is designated chemically as (S)-Nethyl-a-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)
benzeneethanamine hydrochloride and has a molecular weight of 267.7. Its
empirical formula is C<sub><font SIZE=-1>12</font></sub>H<sub><font SIZE=-1>16</font></sub>F<sub><font SIZE=-1>3</font></sub>N-HCl.</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>Dexfenfluramine hydrochloride is freely soluble in water, alcohol,
chloroform, and methanol. The <i><font SIZE=-1>PKa </font></i>of dexfenfluramine
hydrochloride is 10.</tt>
<br></p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b><tt>ACTIONS/CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY</tt></b> </p>

<p><b><i><tt>Pharmacologic Actions</tt></i></b> </p>

<p><tt>The action of Dexfenfluramine in treating obesity is primarily via
decreased caloric intake associated with increased serotonin levels in
brain synapses. Dexfenfluramine is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and releasing
agent. In <i><font SIZE=-1>vitro </font></i>studies have confirmed the
dual serotoninergic mechanism of action of dexfenfluramine by demonstrating
that the drug inhibits serotonin reuptake by axon terminals and causes
the release of serotonin from synaptosomes. In animals, the reduced caloric
intake and the loss in body weight elicited by dexfenfluramine is associated
with release of serotonin from presynaptic axon terminals in the brain,
inhibition of neuronal serotonin reuptake, and, therefore, an increase
of serotonin receptor activation. This results in an enhancement of serotoninergic
transmission in the centers of feeding behavior, located in the ventromedial
nucleus of the hypothalamus. In rats, enhanced serotoninergic transmission
induced by dexfenfluramine selectively suppressed appetite for carbohydrates
which resulted in reduction of food consumption when the dietary carbohydrate
to protein ratio was high. Unlike amphetamines and other serotonin-active
agonists and antagonists, dexfenfluramine neither enhances nor suppresses
dopamine-mediated neurotransmission.</tt>
<br></p>

<p><tt>In clinical trials, Dexfenfluramine treatment in conjunction with
a reduced-calorie diet is associated with a reduction in appetite and may
slow gastric emptying. These and other actions may contribute to the reduction
in caloric consumption associated with Dexfenfluramine. In one clinical
trial, Dexfenfluramine was shown to preferentially decrease carbohydrate
consumption at meals and to manage carbohydrate craving between meals by
decreasing the consumption of snack foods with a high carbohydrate content
in patients who frequently snack on such foods.
<br>
<br><b><i><font SIZE=-1>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</font></i></b></tt>
</p>

<p><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Systemic Bioavailability</font></tt></i> </p>

<p><tt>Dexfenfluramine is completely absorbed after oral dosing, with a
systemic bioavailability of about 68% because of first pass metabolism
by the liver. In studies in which patients received a single 30-mg oral
dose of dexfenfluramine, mean peak plasma concentrations of dexfenfluramine
ranged between 11 and 41 ng/mL in individual patients after 1.5 to 8.0
hours. The average terminal elimination half-life of plasma dexfenfluramine
ranged from 17 to 20 hours, and the average total body clearance of dexfenfluramine
was 691.9 mL/min. In man, following doses of 15 mg Dexfenfluramine twice
a day for 15 days, mean maximal plasma dexfenfluramine concentrations ranging
from 15 to 92 ng/mL were observed, and steady-state plasma levels were
achieved 8 days after the initial dose. The average steady-state plasma
concentrations were somewhat lower than predicted by single-dose pharmacokinetics
and the average time to steady-state was longer than the predicted 4 to
5 days. The main active metabolite, d-norfenfluramine, accumulated to maximal
plasma concentrations of about 26 ng/mL, with steady-state plasma levels
occurring at about 9 days. The d-norfenfluramine plasma half-life is estimated
to be 32 hours. After reaching steady-state levels, there was no evidence
of increasing concentrations of dexfenfluramine or d-norfenfluramine in
plasma during 12 months of dosing. Following administration of single 30-mg,
40-mg, and 60-mg doses of dexfenfluramine to healthy volunteers, dexfenfluramine
Cmax values of 25 ng/mL, 33 ng/mL, and 51 ng/mL and area-under-the-curve
values of 144 ng-hr/mL, 191 ng-hr/mL, and 275 ng-hr/mL, respectively, were
found. In a dose response study of Dexfenfluramine involving obese patients
treated for 12 weeks, dexfenfluramine C min values of 24 ng/mL at a dose
of 15 mg twice daily and&nbsp;58 ng/mL at a dose of 30 mg twice daily were
observed. These data suggest that plasma concentrations of dexfenfluramine
increase in proportion to the administered dose.</tt>
<br></p>

<p><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Protein Binding and Distribution</font></tt></i>
</p>

<p><tt>At a dexfenfluramine plasma concentration of 100 ng/mL, 36% is bound
to plasma proteins. Dexfenfluramine is distributed into body tissue in
non-obese subjects, with a volume of distribution of 839 L.</tt> </p>

<p><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Metabolism</font></tt></i> </p>

<p><tt>Dexfenfluramine is metabolized in the liver. The first steps in
the metabolism of dexfenfluramine are dealkylation, resulting in formation
of the active metabolite, d-norfenfluramine and deamination to an inactive
d-hydroxy derivative. In a study of drug metabolism using radiolabeled
dexfenfluramine, levofenfluramine and d,l-fenfluramine in two healthy subjects,
92% of the administered radioactivity was found in urine and 1 % in feces
over 6 days. Fenfluramine accounted for 7% to 19% and norfenfluramine accounted
for 4% to 11 % of the urine radioactivity. Other metabolites (inactive)
included 1 -(m-trifluoro,2-propanediol (21 to 38% ),m-trifluoromethyl benzoic
acid (7 to 22%), m-trifluormethyl hippuric acid (&lt;1 to 11 %), and 1
-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)-propan-2-ol (2 to 4%). 
<br>
<br><i><font SIZE=-1>Renal Disease and Liver Disease </font></i></tt></p>

<p><tt>Specific studies in patients with renal and hepatic impairment have
not been conducted. </tt></p>

<p><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Obese Patients</font></tt></i> </p>

<p><tt>In obese patients who received a single 30-mg dose, a mean peak
plasma dexfenfluramine concentration of about 22.3 ng/mL is reached after
about 5.2 hours. In a parallel-group, multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study
of dexfenfluramine (15 mg twice daily) there were no significant differences
in steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters between obese and non-obese
subjects. </tt></p>

<p><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Age</font></tt></i> </p>

<p><tt>The pharmacokinetics of a single 30-mg dose of Dexfenfluramine in
eight elderly patients, ranging from 66 to 83 years of age, have been examined
in one study. The mean maximal plasma concentration was 21.8 ng/mL, and
ranged from 9.7 to 33.0 ng/mL in individual patients. Time to maximal plasma
concentration was about 5 hours and ranged from 3 hours to 10 hours. Area-under-the-curve
to infinity was 615 ng-hr/mL and ranged from 16 to 1205 ng-hr/mL. Mean
(+/-SD) steady-state plasma concentrations of dexfenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine
after six months of treatment (15 mg twice daily) in 18 obese patients
over 60 years old were 27.3 (+/- 16.3) ng/mL and 14.0 (+/- 7.4) ng/mL,
respectively, compared to values of 24.1 (+/-15.9) and l5.6 (+/-1 1.2),
respectively, in 268 patients under 60 years old. In a cohort of these
patients followed through 12 months of treatment (15 mg twice daily) mean
(+/-SD) steady-state plasma concentrations of dexfenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine
in 17 obese patients over 60 years old were 32.9 (+/-16.8) ng/mL and 18.0
(+/-8.0) ng/mL, respectively, compared to values of 23.9 (+/-12.9) and
14.4 (+/-8.2), respectively, in 186 obese patients under 60 years old.
<br>
<br><b><i><font SIZE=-1>Clinical Studies</font></i></b></tt> </p>

<p><tt>Observational epidemiologic studies have established a relationship
between obesity and the risks for cardiovascular disease, non-insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus (NIDOM), certain forms of cancer, gallstones, certain
respiratory disorders, and an increase in overall mortality. These studies
suggest that weight loss, if maintained, may produce health benefits for
some patients with chronic obesity who may also be at risk for other diseases.
<br>
<br>The long-term effects of Dexfenfluramine on the morbidity and mortality
associated with obesity have not been established. Short-term (&lt;4 months),
placebo-controlled, double-blind studies have provided evidence that Dexfenfluramine
does not adversely affect glycemia, lipid profile, or blood pressure control
in obese patients. Some short-term studies have suggested that weight loss
with Dexfenfluramine may be associated with a reduction in hyperglycemia
in obese diabetic patients, a reduction in blood pressure in obese hypertensive
patients, and improvement in the lipid profile in obese hyperlipidemic
patients.
<br>
<br>Dexfenfluramine has been shown to be effective in reducing excess body
weight in obese patients. In 16 of 17 double-blind, placebo-controlled
trials, of various treatment durations and with different design features,
where all patients were on reduced-calorie diets, Dexfenfluramine-treated
patients lost statistically significantly more weight on average than those
treated with placebo. In these studies, weight loss was evident within
4 weeks of initiating treatment, even in some patients where reduced-calorie
diet alone had failed to induce a significant weight loss.
<br>
<br>In the INDEX study, a one-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
of obese patients, Dexfenfluramine, in conjunction with a reduced-calorie
diet, produced a significant reduction in weight during the first 4 to
6 months. This response was maintained during continuation of therapy (up
to 12 months of treatment). 
<br>
<br>Based on another analysis of the INDEX study, among all patients who
were treated with Dexfenfluramine and identified as initial responders
<i><font SIZE=-1>(i.e., </font></i>lost at least 4 pounds in the first
4 weeks of therapy), 60% went on to lose &gt;=10% of their initial body
weight by the end of 1 year of treatment. Among Dexfenfluramine-treated
patients, 78% were identified as initial responders. At the end of 1 year,
the mean weight loss for the initial responders was 22 pounds, while the
non-responders had a mean weight loss of 6 pounds.
<br>
<br>Among obese patients who had been successful in losing weight by dieting
alone <i><font SIZE=-1>(i.e., </font></i>lost at least 10 pounds in the
prior), the addition of Dexfenfluramine to the regimen resulted in the
further loss of 26% of initial excess weight, while successful dieters
who received placebo lost only 7% of initial excess weight.</tt>
<br></p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b><tt>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</tt></b>
</p>

<p><tt>Dexfenfluramine is indicated for the management of obesity including
weight loss and maintenance of weight loss in patients on a reduced calorie
diet. Dexfenfluramine is recommended for obese patients with an initial
body mass index &gt;=30 kg/m<sup><font SIZE=-1>2</font></sup>, or &gt;=27
kg/m<sup><font SIZE=-1>2 </font></sup>in the presence of other risk factors
<i><font SIZE=-1>(e.g., </font></i>hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).

<br>
<br>The safety and effectiveness of Dexfenfluramine beyond 1 year have
not been determined at this time.
<br>
<br>Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated by taking the patient's weight,

<p><b><tt><font COLOR="#000000">A 2-year, international (5 country), case-control
(epidemiological) study identified 95 primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH)
cases; 20 of these had been exposed to anorexigens in the past, and 9 of
the 20 had been exposed to anorexigens for longer than three months. In
this study, the use of anorexigens for longer than 3 months was associated
with an increase in the risk of developing PPH (odds ratio =9.1, 95% confidence
interval =2.6-31.5). This increased risk of PPH was concentrated in persons
who had used the drugs within the preceding year; there was no significant
increase in risk for persons who had taken the drug more than 1 year ago
or for persons who had used these agents for 3 months or less. In the general
population, the yearly occurrence of PPH is estimated to be about 1-2 cases
per 1,00(1,000 persons. Therefore, the case-control study indicated an
estimated risk associated with the long-term use of anorexigen drugs of
about 18 cases per million persons exposed per year. According to the case-control
study, obesity itself (body mass index &gt;=30 kg/m2) was also associated
with an increase of about two-fold in the risk of developing PPH.</font></tt></b>
</p>

<p><b><tt><font COLOR="#000000">PPH is a serious condition; the 4-year

<p><i><font SIZE=-1><font COLOR="#000000">Neurochemical Findings in Animals</font>
</font></i></p>

<p><tt><font COLOR="#000000">Dexfenfluramine and its active metabolite
d-norfenfluramine are believed to reduce food intake through interactions
with the serotoninergic neurotransmitter system. In animals, doses of dexfenfluramine
that result in brain concentrations approximately 10 times those observed
in humans produce prolonged reductions (weeks to months) in brain serotonin
concentrations following cessation of dexfenfluramine treatment. These
reductions in brain serotonin concentrations are accompanied by correlate
observations of diminished visualization of serotoninergic neurons by immunohistochemical
techniques and decreased numbers of serotonin transporters. Some investigators
have interpreted these results as surrogate indicators of neurotoxicity;
others have interpreted these results as an extension of the pharmacology
of serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Resolution of differences in the interpretation
of the animal findings may occur with further research.</font></tt> </p>

<p><tt><font COLOR="#000000">Changes in brain serotonin concentrations
following acute, high-dose dexfenfluramine administration have been noted
in all animal species and with all routes of drug administration tested.
Prolonged reductions in brain serotonin concentrations in rats have been
observed following acute, but not escalating, dose regimens. In mice, 2
years of drug administration at a dose producing at least 12 times the
human brain level of dexfenfluramine produced no change in brain serotonin
concentrations or serotonin transporter number. Changes in brain serotonin
concentrations generally have been found to be reversible; however, the
dose and brain concentration of dexfenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine may
affect reversibility. Persistent reductions in brain serotonin concentrations
and neuronal serotonin immunoreactivity were observed in three squirrel
monkeys 14-17 months after a 4-day, 10 mg/kg/day subcutaneous dose regimen
of dexfenfluramine; the effects of lower doses or different dose regimens
were not reported in this study. </font></tt></p>

<p><tt><font COLOR="#000000">In a separate study, other squirrel monkeys
given this high-dose regimen achieved brain concentrations of dexfenfluramine
approximately 35 times those of obese patients taking normal therapeutic
doses. Studies employing experimental techniques that are independent of
serotonin content <b><i>(e.g., </i></b>retrograde transport, silver staining,
glial fibrilary acidic protein content) could not detect neuronal damage
at doses of dexfenfluramine in animals producing decreased brain serotonin
concentrations. The observed neurochemical changes were not associated
with persistent changes in animal behavior.</font></tt>
<br></p>

<p><tt><font COLOR="#000000">The relevance of the animal findings to humans
is not known.
<br>
<br><b><i><font SIZE=-1>Miscellaneous</font></i></b></font></tt> </p>

<p><tt><font COLOR="#000000">Organic causes of obesity <b><i>(e.g., </i></b>hypothyroidism)
should be excluded before prescribing Dexfenfluramine. Dexfenfluramine

</p>

<p><b><i><tt><font COLOR="#000000"><font SIZE=-1>General</font></font></tt></i></b>
</p>

<p><tt><font COLOR="#000000">Because of Dexfenfluramine's potential to
produce mild-to-moderate drowsiness, the patient's individual response
should be assessed before engaging in activities requiring alertness. Dexfenfluramine
may potentiate the sedative effects of alcohol or other drugs with CNS
action. If the patient develops any symptoms of intolerance, <i>e.g., </i>nausea
and vomiting, the dosage should be reduced, or the drug discontinued.

<br><b><i><font SIZE=-1>Misuse Potential</font></i></b></font></tt> </p>

<p><tt><font COLOR="#000000">As with any weight-loss agent, the potential

</p>

<p><tt><font COLOR="#000000">The safety and efficacy of dexfenfluramine

<p><b><i><tt><font COLOR="#000000"><font SIZE=-1>Use in Patients with Concomitant
Illness</font></font></tt></i></b> </p>

<p><tt><font COLOR="#000000">Weight loss has been associated with a reduction
in hyperglycemia in obese diabetic patients, a reduction of blood pressure
in obese hypertensive patients, and an improvement in the lipid profile
in obese hyperlipidemic patients. Therefore, when Dexfenfluramine is used
for the management of obesity associated with hypertension, diabetes, or
dyslipidemia, there may be changes in these conditions and the medications
used to treat them should be monitored, and adjusted, if necessary.</font></tt>
</p>

<p><a name="Drug Interactions"></a><b><i><tt>Drug&nbsp;Interactions</tt></i></b>
</p>

<p><tt>In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors
(MAOIs) <i><font SIZE=-1>(e.g., </font></i>selegiline hydrochloride) in
combination with serotoninergic agents <b><i><font SIZE=-1>(e.g., </font></i></b>fluoxetine,
fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports
of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions. Because Dexfenfluramine is a serotonin
releaser and reuptake inhibitor, Dexfenfluramine should not be used concomitantly
with a MAO inhibitor (see <b><font SIZE=-1>CONTRAINDICATIONS). </font></b></tt>
<br></p>

<p><tt>At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of a MAO
inhibitor and initiation of treatment with Dexfenfluramine. At least 3
weeks should elapse between discontinuation of Dexfenfluramine and initiation
of treatment with a MAO inhibitor. </tt></p>

<p>
<br><tt>A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed &quot;serotonin
syndrome,&quot; has been reported with the concomitant use of selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy,
such as lmitrex (sumatriptan succinate) and dihydroergotamine. The syndrome
requires immediate medical attention and may include one or more of the
following symptoms: excitement, hypomania, restlessness, loss of consciousness,
confusion, disorientation, anxiety, agitation, motor weakness, myoclonus,
tremor, hemiballismus, hyperreflexia, ataxia, dysarthria, incoordination,
hyperthermia, shivering, pupillary dilation, diaphoresis, emesis, and tachycardia.
Dexfenfluramine should not be administered with other serotoninergic agents.
The appropriate interval between administration of these agents and Dexfenfluramine
has not been established.</tt>
<br></p>

<p><tt>The use of dexfenfluramine with other CNS-active drugs has not been
systematically evaluated; consequently, caution is advised if dexfenfluramine
and such drugs are prescribed concurrently. </tt>
<br></p>

<p><b><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</font></tt></i></b>
</p>

<p><tt>False-positive urine drug tests for amphetamines by ELISA have been
observed for up to 24 hours following a 30-mg dose (2 capsules) of Dexfenfluramine.
Patients should be informed of this possible false-positive lab-oratory
finding when undergoing urine drug screenings. Gas chromatography/mass
spectroscopy can distinguish false-positive urine drug tests caused by
dexfenfluramine from true-positive drug tests. See</tt> <b><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Information
for Patients. </font></tt></i></b></p>

<p><b><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</font></tt></i></b>
</p>

<p><tt>Carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice have not shown a carcinogenic
potential for dexfenfluramine at doses up to 12 mg/kg and 27 mg/kg, respectively.
These doses are 4.8 and 5.8 times the daily human dose (calculated on a
body surface area [mg/m2] basis). When given to pregnant rats, dexfenfluramine
caused a significant reduction in the number of fetuses and live young.</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>Dexfenfluramine has no detectable mutagenic activity as determined
by the Ames test, gene conversion-DNA repair test, evaluation of the clastogenic
effect on cultures of human lymphocytes, mouse lymphoma cell mutation test,
and the micronucleus test in the mouse.</tt> </p>

<p><b><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Pregnancy</font></tt></i></b> </p>

<p><b><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Teratogenic Effects- Pregnancy Category C</font></tt></i></b>
</p>

<p><tt>Dexfenfluramine produced dose-related effects on reproduction and
fertility in rats. In a three-9eneration fertility and reproduction study,
administration of dexfenfluramine to female rats at 2.5 and 5 times the
human daily dose (calculated on a body surface area [mg/m2] basis) caused
significant reductions in body weight and weight gain throughout pregnancy;
the number of placental implantations and fetuses was reduced, there was
a reduced number of live young, and delayed ossification was seen in the
fetuses. No significant treatment-related adverse effects or abnormalities
were observed in second- and third-generation rats.</tt> </p>

<p><tt>Teratogenicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Neither
study showed any treatment-related embryotoxicity or teratogenicity at
doses up to 10 times the daily human dose (calculated on a body surface
area [mg/m2] basis).</tt> </p>

<p><tt>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Dexfenfluramine
in pregnant women. Dexfenfluramine is not recommended for pregnant women.</tt>
<br></p>

<p><b><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Nursing Mothers</font></tt></i></b> </p>

<p><tt>Dexfenfluramine is excreted in rat milk. It is not known whether
dexfenfluramine is excreted in human milk. Therefore, dexfenfluramine should
not be administered to a nursing woman.</tt>
<br></p>

<p><b><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Use in Other Populations Pediatric Use</font></tt></i></b>
</p>

<p><tt>Safety and effectiveness of Dexfenfluramine in pediatric patients
have not been established.
<br>
<br><b><i><font SIZE=-1>Geriatric Use</font></i></b></tt> </p>

<p><tt>As with all CNS-active medications, caution should be exercised
in treating elderly patients with Dexfenfluramine. Clinical studies of
Dexfenfluramine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65
or older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients.
Pharmacokinetics in elderly patients are discussed in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.

<p><tt>Dexfenfluramine is a controlled substance in Schedule</tt> <tt>IV.</tt>
</p>

<p><b><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Abuse and Physical and Psychological Dependence</font></tt></i></b>
</p>

<p><tt>Dexfenfluramine is not an amphetamine or a stimulant. There is no
evidence of addictive or drug-seeking behavior in pre-marketing clinical
studies. Dexfenfluramine was inactive in rat and monkey self-administration,
drug-discrimination, and place-preference models of abuse potential.</tt>
</p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b><tt>OVERDOSAGE</tt></b> </p>

<p><b><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Human Experience</font></tt></i></b> </p>

<p><tt>Post-marketing experience in Europe over 10 years (August 1984 through
December 1994) in an estimated</tt> <tt>1O million patients provided reports
of 66 instances of overdose (maximum dose per body mass of 54 mg/kg, maximum
total dose of 1800 mg), including eight children 6 years of age or under.
Three deaths have occurred in association with dexfenfluramine overdosage.
One patient with a history of suicide attempts ingested 1800 mg dexfenfluramine
and 20 to 30 capsules of Tranxene (clorazepate), one patient was found
dead, assumed to have consumed approximately 1500 mg of dexfenfluramine,
and the third patient consumed dexfenfluramine (quantity unknown) and several
other drugs in an apparent suicide. The second patient had post-mortem
levels of dexfenfluramine of 3300 ng/mL, and positive levels for amphetamines
and cannabinoids. The exact causes of death were unknown. In 23 other cases
of dexfenfluramine overdose, plasma drug levels were determined; the maximum
reported plasma drug level for dexfenfluramine was 778 ng/mL (with d-norfenfluramine
37 <i><font SIZE=-1>ng/mL); </font></i>the maximum d-norfenfluramine level
was 371 ng/mL (with dexfenfluramine 483 ng/mL).</tt> </p>

<p><tt>Symptoms associated with overdosage consisted mainly of agitation,
drowsiness, mydriasis, sweating, shivering, nausea, and vomiting.</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>Other symptoms observed with dexfenfluramine overdose and not noted
under ADVERSE <b><font SIZE=-1>REACTIONS </font></b>include cold sensation,
excitation, nystagmus, garrulousness, delusions, bladder tenesmus, chattering
teeth, abnormal reflexes, facial myoclonus, trismus, tonic-clonic seizures,
impairment of consciousness, coma (stage 2-4), sinus bradycardia, repolarization
abnormalities, right anterior hemiblock, polypnea, diffuse bronchial rales,
and flushing.</tt> </p>

<p><b><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Animal Experience</font></tt></i></b> </p>

<p><tt>Significant acute toxicity occurred at oral doses greater than 40,
70, and 75 mg/kg in rats, mice, and guinea pigs, respectively. A dose of
40 mg/kg is approximately 31 times greater than the effective anorectic
dose in rats.</tt> </p>

<p><b><i><tt><font SIZE=-1>Management of Overdose</font></tt></i></b> </p>

<p><tt>General supportive measures for oral drug overdose should be instituted.
Measures that have been used in dexfenfluramine overdose cases include
aspiration of gastric contents, gastric lavage with activated charcoal,
osmotic diuresis, forced acid diuresis, and careful monitoring of CNS or
respiratory depression. The effectiveness of dialysis is not known. Patients
should be followed closely until there is no further evidence of drug-related
CNS effects. No specific therapy for dexfenfluramine overdose is known.</tt>
</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><font SIZE=+1><b><tt>DOSAGE
AND ADMINISTRATION</tt></b> </font></p>

<p><tt>The usual dosage is one 15-mg capsule twice daily, with meals. Doses
above 30 mg per day are not recommended.</tt> </p>

<p><tt>Analysis of numerous variables has indicated that about 60% of patients
who lose at least 4 pounds in the first 4 weeks of treatment with Dexfenfluramine
in combination with a reduced-calorie diet lose at least 10% of their initial
body weight by the end of 1 year of treatment. If a patient has not lost
at least 4 pounds in the first 4 weeks of treatment, the physician should

<p><tt>The safety and effectiveness of Dexfenfluramine beyond 1 year have
not been determined at this time. Infrequently, symptoms <i><font SIZE=-1>(e.g.,
</font></i>abdominal pain, anxiety, asthenia, delusion, depression, diarrhea,
dizziness, hypertension, insomnia, nausea and vomiting) have occurred within
several days following cessation of Dexfenfluramine. If the physician notes
such symptoms, clinical judgment should guide the treatment, which may
include tapering the dose (15 mg once daily) for 2 weeks prior to complete
discontinuation. </tt>
