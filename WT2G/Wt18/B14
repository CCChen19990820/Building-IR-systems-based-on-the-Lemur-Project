Vol. 7, No. 11                                                          
May 17, 1993  Nearly 90% of Americans pray to God and 60% do so daily, 
but the content is not uniform, says a Barna Research Group survey.  
Overall, 61% make specific requests of God, and 46% listen silently for 
a personal response.  Baby Boomers (ages 28-46) and adult Baby Busters 
(the generation following) were less likely to engage in prayer or 
anticipate responses from God.  Those who do not attend church pray 
less often and with less assurance; 63% of unchurched Americans pray 
regularly, compared with 82% of all Americans; and only 34% of the 
unchurched are certain that prayer makes a difference, a rate 22 
percentage points lower than that of all Americans. 
..."Born-again" respondents, the poll said, were most likely to "see 
God as worthy of their praise [84% to 54%], as able to forgive them of 
their sins [86% to 68%], and as personally responding to their prayers 
[69% to 55%]."  Those who did not view God in these ways continued to 
pray -- even regularly -- but their prayers reflected "thanksgiving 
rather than an entire range of ways of interacting with God," George 
Barna said.  Of all participants, 95% who pray thank God, and 76% ask 
Him to forgive specific sins.  Of those polled, 12% reported they pray 
in charismatic tongues. 

About three months behind the customary schedule, President Bill 
Clinton proclaimed May 6 National Day of Prayer.  He said freedom of 
religion was a foundation to America's strength.  Government based on 
God-given rights has provided "unparalleled freedom and dazzling 
diversity," often seen as a source of division.  But, Clinton said, 
prayer, an act common to all religions, allows Americans to come 
together to recommit themselves to serving a greater good.  He 
concluded by calling all citizens, in their own prayers, "to remember 
those who are in need, to achieve patience in tribulation, to resolve 
the problems that divide us, to rejoice in hope, and to express thanks 
for the abundance we have experienced throughout our history." 
...It was standing-room only in the 800-seat Caucus Room of the Cannon 
Office Building on Capitol Hill.  In a five-hour meeting, government 
employees, members of Congress, judges, clergy, and spokespeople for 
minorities, the disabled, and the homeless issued 10-minute appeals for 
prayer.  Each was followed by five minutes of corporate prayer. 
Religious leaders from a variety of faiths and denominations addressed 
the overflow crowd.  Foursquare pastor Jack Hayford preached of 
America's need for prayer.  He urged listeners not to use prayers that 
distanced them from the nation's moral shortcomings, but instead to 
identify themselves with their country's sins.  Like Daniel, he said, 
Americans "must say,  Lord, we are a sinful people ."  About 150 young 
people, after the showing of a video on the challenges facing today's 
youth, dispersed throughout the room, standing or kneeling to receive 
prayer as proxy for their generation.  An evening concert with a 
contemporary flair opened a session in which representatives of 27 
countries prayed for the governments and peoples of the world. 
...Around the country, participation varied.  All 88 Ohio counties had 
major observances, including 90-hour vigils, Bible reading marathons, 
and prayer for law enforcement officers and elected officials; the 
governor's second annual private breakfast was attended by 500 people, 
and several thousand reportedly attended observances in Cleveland.  A 
group of Miami churches held a prayer service for Homestead, Fla., 
churches, which have lost 30%-50% of their members since the hurricane. 
 In Dallas, journalist and former hostage Terry Anderson addressed a 
breakfast on his personal observations on prayer.  About 80 
Minneapolis-area pastors met for a morning session of united prayer; at 
noon they joined a diverse group of about 400 legislators, teen-agers, 
business leaders, and others on the capitol steps for a 2-hour prayer 
meeting.  In Boise, Idaho, 350 people defied pouring rain to pray at 
the courthouse. 
...Task force officials said interest in the National Day of Prayer was 
noticeably higher this year.  Compared to 7,000 inquiries last year, 
they received 18,000 information requests for 1993.  U.S. military 
personnel, both lay persons and chaplains, contacted the Colorado 
Springs headquarters from bases as far as Japan and Antarctica.  This 
year 49 state governors, 10 more than last year, issued Day of Prayer 
proclamations, according to committee member David Bryant, director of 
Concerts of Prayer.  The Connecticut state legislature, in the absence 
of a proclamation from Gov. Lowell Weicker, issued an official citation 
of observance, said Shirley Dobson, National Day of Prayer chairman. 
...Despite the wider interest, national news media and wire services 
had virtually no coverage.  Christian media, including the Moody 
Satellite Network, the Christian Broadcasting Network's 700 Club, and 
James Dobson's Family News in Focus covered the Washington events, and 
many local media ran stories on observances in their cities.  The 
National Day of Prayer may get a publicity boost in years to come.  
Sources told NIRR that Hallmark has reportedly decided to add the 
observance to its calendars, after which other publishers would likely 
follow suit. 
...The Virginia ACLU questioned the constitutionality of a proclamation 
by Roanoke's mayor, according to the city's Times & World-News.  Kent 
Willis, state executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, 
said that by proclaiming an official day of prayer, David Bowers was 
"putting the state stamp of approval on the practice of religious 
activity."  Bowers defended his action, pointing out that no particular 
religion was endorsed and no citizen was compelled to participate.  The 
newspaper reported that Robert Peck, a Washington-based ACLU attorney, 
said his group believes the national observance is unconstitutional, 
but that the group has more pressing issues to challenge.  Crystal 
Evangelical Free Church still insists that the government has no right 
to take money from its offering plates, even if the tithe did come from 
a bankrupt couple (NIRR 1/25).  U.S. District Court Judge Harry 
MacLaughlin ruled last month that Bruce and Nancy Young had no legal 
right to tithe since they had declared bankruptcy.  Under such law, 
their donations to the Minneapolis-area church constituted a 
"fraudulent transfer" of monies that should have gone to creditors 
instead.  The church's appeal argued a violation of church-state 
separation and freedom of religious expression, news sources reported, 
but MacLaughlin agreed with earlier federal bankruptcy court rulings.  
Despite the cost, Crystal EFC plans to continue its appeal to allow the 
church to keep the Youngs' $13,450 tithes for 1990. 

A New Jersey school district discriminated against religious students 
by prohibiting them from forming a Bible club, U.S. Judge Harold 
Ackerman ruled.  The suit was filed by Donna Pope, a 1991 graduate of 
East Brunswick High School. In 1989, she and other Christians sought 
permission to start an extracurricular Bible club.  School officials 
allowed them to meet informally, according to news reports, but refused 
to let them post notices of upcoming events or announce their meetings 
over the loudspeakers, as other clubs did.  School lawyers said the 
district's decision prevented school representatives, who would have to 
supervise any club, from involvement with religion beyond what the law 
allows.  Ackerman issued an injunction to keep the district from 
blocking the formation of future clubs. 

May 4 marked New York City's most heated school board elections to 
date, as Catholics and evangelical Protestants aligned in a 
non-partisan, grass-roots political effort to assure conservative 
control.  Spurred by the ouster of Chancellor Joseph Fernandez, whose 
multicultural curriculum advocated tolerance of homosexual lifestyles 
(NIRR 2/22), they sought to fill the 288 open seats (nine on each of 
the 32 school boards) that represent middle and elementary schools.  
These school board members will represent parents of more than 682,000 
of the city's 995,000 students, and will have a chance to help name a 
new chancellor when Fernandez's contract expires at the end of June. 
...Cardinal John O'Connor, archbishop of New York, shared church 
mailing lists with Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition, and the groups 
established phone banks to urge parents to vote.  The CC produced a 
seven-page voters' guide detailing candidates' positions.  Potential 
school board members were asked to indicate how they stood on various 
issues: elementary education on HIV, AIDS, and sexually transmitted 
diseases; the "Children of the Rainbow" curriculum; parental rights to 
inspect instructional materials; the ratio between basic educational 
courses and social programs; decentralizing the Central Board of 
Education to several borough boards; voluntary school prayer; emphasis 
on abstinence in sex education; increased spending "to solve 
educational problems of city schoolchildren"; parental permission for 
condom distribution. Only 160 of the 543 candidates responded to the 
Coalition request, and the guide recommended that voters select only 
those candidates whose opinions they knew and supported.  More than 
650,000 English- and Spanish-language guides were dispersed in 1,800 
churches and all 213 parishes across the city. 
...The more liberal political and religious factions were clearly 
worried.  About 25 mainline churches and Jewish groups joined together 
in the New York Clergy Council.  They said conservative victories would 
lead to religious "forcefeeding" in public schools, as well as book 
banning, sectarian prayer, and gutted sex/AIDS education programs.  Al 
Sharpton, an outspoken black pastor, urged voters not to subscribe to 
the CC's "racist" approach to education.  Mayor David Dinkins called 
the conservative campaign "fear-based," and the American Jewish 
Congress urged Catholics to distance themselves from the evangelical 
Christian Coalition.  At least two groups, People for the American Way 
and the Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay-rights advocacy group, 
distributed several thousand of their own voters' guides. 
...New York CC leader Terry Twerell, a former Methodist minister and 
founder of Manhattan's Living Word Christian Center, estimates that 
30%-50% of their supporters in the city are black, Hispanic, Asian, or 
Jewish.  All share an unhappiness with what he terms the city's drift 
to deterioration.  "We are witnessing the beginning of a sweeping, 
multicultural campaign to restore parental involvement in New York City 
Schools," said Roy Innis, head of the Congress of Racial Equality, and 
an announced Democratic mayoral candidate.  Also joining in the effort 
were the Family Defense Council and the National Committee for the 
Furtherance of Jewish Education. 
...Because voter registration had been considerably higher than usual, 
the Board of Elections anticipated a 10%-15% turnout.  Although early 
voting was much lighter than expected, perhaps because of inclement 
weather, the election saw more people than the usual 4%-7% voter rate.  
Balloting will take two to three weeks to tabulate. 

The Philadelphia public school board will consider a Muslim request to 
add two Islamic holy days to the list of religious holidays.  Some 200 
Muslims lobbied for the change, saying they sought only the same 
religious options granted to Christians and Jews.  The district 
recognizes Christmas, Easter, Rosh Hashana, and Yom Kippur.  The 
Muslims asked the board to include Eid ul-Fitr, which ends the fasting 
of Ramadan, and Eid ul-Adha, which honors Abraham's willingness to 
sacrifice his son in obedience to God.  Proponents estimate that 8% of 
the district's 200,000 students are Muslim, and say many black students 
also identify with Islam.  News reports said school board president 
Rotan Lee saw the request as indication of an "evolving population" of 
Muslim students and teachers in the city. 

Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church is close to taking over a Christian 
seminary in South Korea, apparently in pursuit of its vow to develop a 
world network of universities.  The church is seeking ownership of 
Hansung Seminary in Taejon.  Owned by the Korean Christian Mission, a 
Churches of Christ affiliate, the seminary's property values 
skyrocketed when the 1988 Summer Olympics turned Taejon into a boom 
town.  School officials say the property, purchased for $450, is now 
worth several million. 
...The mission's loss was unintentional.  According to the academic 
dean, the seminary's business manager conspired to gain control of the 
school while its president, Chang Yung Kim, was out of the country on 
missions trips.  Before Kim left, he gave the business manager approval 
to trade the seminary property to a local construction company in 
exchange for labor to build a separate, larger campus.  But, the dean 
said, the business manager also sold the same property to the 
Unification Church.  In August, when the construction contractor 
demanded payment or control of the site, the business manager and Kim 
were arrested.  At trial, the manager was exonerated, but Kim was 
convicted of "making false accusations," and sentenced to jail.  He has 
been refused bail while he appeals his case, and is reportedly being 
held in solitary confinement. Police have arrested, and are seeking, 
other seminary officials. 
...Seminary officials fear that the court deciding the property rights 
will grant control of both campuses to the Unification Church.  The 
Knoxville, Tenn.-based Mission Service Association announced that it is 
watching the case, as are U.S. Embassy officials and Rep. Richard 
Boucher (D-Va.), but they have been able to do little.  Officials from 
Johnson Bible College in Tennessee, Kim's alma mater, have traveled to 
Korea to monitor events. 
...Moon's church was accused of questionable tactics involving a 
similar university takeover last year.  A Unification Church affiliate, 
the Professors World Peace Academy, bought the financially troubled 
University of Bridgeport amid much controversy (NIRR 5/4/92).  The 
school accepted $50 million in loans from the church.  In exchange, the 
Unification Church received the property, the right to pick the 
school's president, and the ability to appoint 60% of Bridgeport's 
board of trustees.  By taking over an existing school rather that 
starting a new one, the Unification Church bypassed the scrutiny of 
chartering and licensing regulations and "basically stole the 
University of Bridgeport from the people of Connecticut," attorney 
Michael Stratton told NIRR.  He represents the Coalition of Concerned 
Citizens, a group of local clergy, elected officials, and university 
alumni and faculty who have filed suit to challenge the deal. 

Joining the educational bandwagon is the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, founder 
of Transcendental Meditation.  He plans to develop teaching centers in 
50 U.S. cities, according to Pulse, the newsletter of the Evangelical 
Missions Information Service.  His recent $2 million acquisition of a 
Days Inn in Houston will become the combination Maharishi Vedic 
University and Heaven on Earth Inn.  The organization has transformed a 
failed university in Fairfield, Iowa, into the accredited Maharishi 
International University with an enrollment of 850 students. 

The University of New Hampshire suspended a religious group that 
chaplains said used cult-like pressure tactics to recruit and keep 
members.  Campus Advance, which has 11 permanent members, can no longer 
use the university's name or apply for school funding.  The group also 
lost the right to use campus property for meetings.  All students in 
the group are members of the Boston Church of Christ, a decade-old 
movement with 100 churches and 45,000 members worldwide. UNH Chaplain 
Mary Westfall said Campus Advance members preached a message "similar 
to other fundamentalist Christian groups," but required students to 
believe that the BCC is "the one true church."  Members were also 
expected to be baptized and become active in the church, Westfall said. 
 Westfall said she has fielded complaints from more than a dozen 
students who had been approached by Campus Advance, or had left the 
group.  The students said the group expected them to give it all their 
free time, and to read the Bible after missing a Bible study session. 
..."That's harassment?  When someone gives you scripture to read?" 
student group leader Tina Wicander asked. "I've told members that when 
people say  no,  just leave them alone," she said.  Wicander said the 
group is not a cult.  . . .  Westfall described the UNH followers as 
being "very dedicated, sincere college students" manipulated by a power 
structure.  "The issue is not their beliefs.  The issue is behavior," 
Westfall said.  She said the Boston church movement (which is not 
affiliated with the United Church of Christ or the Church of Christ, 
Scientist in Boston) had "been in hot water a number of times" with 
Boston College and other area schools. 
...An article in BCC's quarterly Upside Down indicates the group has 
been a target of religious deprogrammers, including the Cult Awareness 
Network, whose motives and methods the BCC questions.  The allegations 
raised against the church, also known as the International Churches of 
Christ (Boston Movement), claim mind control, questionable recruitment 
tactics, and manipulation.  The article denies the validity of the 
charges, but acknowledges that, like the church in the book of Acts, 
the group could be considered a sect "when contrasted with today's 
mainstream religion." 

Organized religion was anathema at the WomenChurch "Weavers of Change" 
conference last month.  The three-day international meeting drew some 
2,500 women to sacred Native American ground in Albuquerque, N.M.  Like 
its decadeold movement, WomenChurch's third conference was thinly 
rooted in Catholic tradition, but participants came from a wide variety 
of races, ages, sexual preferences, classes, and religious 
orientations.  What they had in common was a disdain for patriarchal 
and traditional religious practice, no matter the faith.  Speakers 
included leading feminist liberation theologians, who called for a 
female reinterpretation of church history, as well as cultural and 
religious diversity.  Some 30 options for Sunday services included a 
Native American drum and pipe ceremony, transcendental meditation, Sufi 
(Muslim mystic) dancing, a Holocaust remembrance, goddess worship, and 
Protestant, Quaker, Catholic, and Buddhist meetings.  Although there 
was no Catholic mass (since only priests, who must be male, can conduct 
the service), there was a "feminist eucharist."  The three-day 
convention had a New Age flavor that some saw as a radically reshaped 
Christianity; others called it paganism.  News accounts indicated the 
closing ritual called upon "the deity whom some call goddess, Christa, 
some call Jesus, Spirit, Holy One," the "wondrous God who created me 
female." 
...Catholic feminists may have reached a fork in their spiritual road.  
Differences in which direction to pursue are polarizing the movement, 
and many wonder whether to work within the church, evolve into 
something only vaguely Catholic, or cease to be centered on Christ at 
all.  Women who favor institutional reform expressed concern that 
WomenChurch is siphoning energy from their attempts to change the 
church from within, news accounts said. 
...Mormon feminism sounds like an oxymoron, but more of the church's 
women are seeking their own voice.  Even though the church has a rigid 
theology governing gender roles, some are questioning the faith of 
their fathers.  Discussion groups comprised of Mormon women are 
becoming increasingly popular in several cities, as is a Boston-based 
Mormon women's quarterly newspaper, Exponent II.  The publication takes 
a moderate, non-confrontational tone, but exposes Mormon women's 
questions and doubts about their roles, abortion, and church doctrine, 
an act some church leaders see as a challenge to Mormon tenets.  The 
newspaper's editor, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Laurel Thatcher 
Ulrich, recently was barred from speaking at Brigham Young University 
for her feminist views. 

The Anglican Church's decision to allow women priests is leading many 
members to consider Catholicism.  The problem is how.  Both churches 
are cooperating to facilitate the conversion process.  An April 
conference of Great Britain's Catholic bishops, headed by Cardinal 
Basil Hume, met to consider how to accommodate Anglican converts.  
Although the changes will not be immediate, the bishops said they could 
not endorse a church within a church.  Many Anglicans had hoped to 
retain some of the Protestant flavor of their services, including use 
of the Book of Common Prayer and worship conducted in their buildings 
by Catholic priests.  How married Anglican priests will fit into the 
Catholic tradition of a celibate clergy will require special 
consideration, they said.  The bishops also were wary of those who want 
to convert for just one reason: women's ordination.  All new Catholics 
must be willing to accept the same rites and forms of authority 
(including papal infallibility) as other Catholics.  "The aim for those 
who seek to enter into full communion with the Catholic Church must be 
their total integration into the life of the Catholic community," Hume 
said.  Anglican priests may count their years of service in the Church 
of England, but all converts will undergo instruction in the Catholic 
confession, a formal confirmation, and eucharist.  The leading Anglican 
archbishops, George Carey and John Habgood, said they appreciated the 
Catholic bishops' statement as "pastorally sensitive," and want their 
input to help set up a joint conversion commission. 
...Already the mass defections have begun, among them the congregation 
of St. Matthews, one of London's largest Anglican churches.  Last month 
its members voted unanimously to convert to Roman Catholicism.  As many 
as nine other traditionalist congregations may follow, news reports 
indicated.  Key individuals, too, are taking "the Roman option" over 
remaining Anglican.  One member of Parliament, Social Security Minister 
Ann Widdecombe, changed her religious allegiance, and Agriculture 
Minister John Gummer resigned from the General Synod, although he has 
not yet converted. Former Bishop of London Graham Leonard has announced 
that he, too, will leave the Anglican church. 

Jack Iker's April consecration as the Episcopal bishop of Fort Worth 
was met with six formal protests over his views against women priests.  
More than 100 women opposed his stand, but Iker said the Episcopal 
Church can accommodate "all kinds of differences," and he would "not 
allow one issue to dominate" his work.  Iker said he hoped to open 
lines of communication and to travel around the diocese to get to know 
its people, including his critics, and their views. "Inactive" 
Presbyterians say they are too worn out to worship on the day of rest.  
The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) used 40-minute phone calls to survey 
once-regular parishioners who now go only a few times a year.  "Why 
aren't you more active?" most often was answered by "I'm just 
exhausted" from work, home, and volunteer responsibilities.  Most agree 
they "ought" to attend, but that they drifted gradually away from 
regular attendance; few purposely left over theological differences.  
Although Sunday worship was "squeezed out" by other "positive" 
activities, about half had some attachment to church-related outreaches 
or enterprises, or had personal interaction with other Christians. 
...Still, the inactives had idealistic views of what the church should 
be and do.  It should protect and act on social and moral values; it 
should provide a "safety net" for the poor, homeless, unemployed, and 
those whom government cannot or will not assist; and it should be a 
spiritual "Swiss Army knife," providing help and guidance for every 
personal need.  The PCUSA should be apolitical, and work for world 
peace and against pornography. 
...Contrary to other surveys, inactives did not want larger religious 
services that have something for everyone.  They said they would be 
more likely to return to a mid-sized or smaller church.  Most cited 
sermons as the part of the service that drew them to church (or annoyed 
them most); almost all strongly preferred messages that were 
"biblically based," "intellectually powerful," and "applicable to 
everyday life."  Music was a powerful inducement to returning, if the 
hymns were less formal and more "singable."  And "friendly persuasion" 
was the key to their return: more than 80% said they would attend if a 
friend invited them to a church service. 

Neighborhood services would be far worse off if not for their primary 
service providers: religious congregations, according to a new survey 
conducted by Independent Sector of Washington, D.C.  Funded by the 
Lilly Endowment, the survey reveals what some researchers overlook when 
they leave religious congregations out of measurements of privatesector 
social programs.  The "From Belief to Commitment" report said 
individual giving to congregations in 1991 was $39.2 billion, with an 
estimated value on volunteer time at $19.2 billion.  The groups, in 
turn, donated $6.6 billion of these contributions to other 
organizations or individuals needing assistance.  Among the programs 
religious groups offered were housing, religious education, shut-in and 
hospital visitation, food kitchens, artistic and cultural activities, 
foreign aid relief, youth groups, family counseling, environmental 
services, and help programs for the homeless.  Researchers estimated 
49.4 million adults volunteered to or through religious organizations. 
...People who identify themselves as religious and who attend regular 
services are by far the most generous when it comes to giving of their 
time and money.  More than half (56%) of contributors gave to both 
religious and other charities, 73% of all benevolent donations.  
Virginia Hodgekinson, co-author of the study, said, "The natural 
affinity between religious beliefs and improvement of the human 
condition is probably much stronger than most people think." 

Two of Hollywood's best known evangelicals, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, 
were honored by more than 750 movie and recording stars, community 
leaders, and other friends April 29.  Evangelist Billy Graham hosted 
the gala event for the King of the Cowboys and the Queen of the West, 
and he reminisced about their (and Roy's horse, Trigger's) 
participation in his 1954 London Crusade.  Naturally, the crowd sang 
Happy Trails to You, the couple's theme song. 
...The event also raised funds for the Salvation Army, Rogers' longtime 
favorite charity.  He recalled a 1935 appeal he did for the group, 
which presented the couple with its highest annual recognition, the 
1993 Sally Award.  The festivities, which took place in Los Angeles one 
year after the riots, collected $150,000 for the Salvation Army's 
Hollywood Youth Shelter and Youth Center.  Graham said, "It is through 
the efforts of dedicated men and women everywhere and the work of 
organizations such as the Salvation Army that we can begin to heal our 
cities and our country." 

Scheduled on the anniversary of the LA riots, the National Urban Peace 
and Justice Summit met many of its goals, according to its sponsors and 
participants.  More than 120 African-American and Latino leaders from 
15 gangs and 25 cities met for three days behind closed doors at St. 
Stephen Baptist Church in Kansas City, Mo.  Gang members renewed their 
resolve to establish truces and a lasting peace with nonviolent problem 
solving.  Then they can work with others to alleviate poverty and 
encourage economic development in their violence-torn communities.  
But, the gang leaders said, they will need the help of suburban and 
rural Americans, as well as the government.  News accounts said another 
meeting is planned for Washington, D.C., as well as a more formal name 
and structure for the movement. 
...Plans for the summit began last year after Carl Upchurch toured 
riot-torn south-central Los Angeles.  The month-long listening project 
led him to establish the Council for Urban Peace and Justice at First 
Baptist Church, in Granville, Ohio.  Upchurch, a former gang member, 
and Ken Sehested, executive director of the Memphis-based Baptist Peace 
Fellowship of North America, agreed that national peace and justice 
organizations have little concept of real life in that community.  They 
called the summit to "seek the peace of the city," as the prophet 
Jeremiah wrote.  Before the meetings began, intercessory prayer 
services in Kansas City and other major metropolitan areas focused on 
asking God to help reconcile the gang members and to strengthen the 
church's commitment to urban needs. Inner-city youth are turning their 
street smarts into their own businesses, and some ministries are 
helping.  The National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, begun 
in 1987 and operating in 11 U.S. cities, uses semester-long courses to 
equip urban teens to start new businesses and maintain them.  A 
year-old NFTE program in Detroit has partnered with an African-American 
church, Joy of Jesus Ministries, and a Jewish business coalition to 
revitalize the economy through youth entrepreneurship.  Students learn 
from a biblical perspective about negotiation, the economic system, and 
how to read and apply information in The Wall Street Journal.  More 
than 50 Detroit youth are involved, and Joy of Jesus Ministries says 
neighborhood crime is down 42% since the program began.  Says director 
Murray MacTavish, "Many inner-city youth possess the qualities of 
successful entrepreneurs: mental toughness, ability to take risks, 
resiliency and a natural sales ability. We're just giving them positive 
tools to help the dreams they already have." 

When the Olympic Games come to Atlanta in 1996, community residents 
will have a vested interest, literally.  A committee of urban ministry 
leaders and neighborhood residents are working with the Olympic 
committee in Summerhill, the city's oldest African-American community.  
Together they will ensure that the profits and construction of the new 
facilities spur community redevelopment.  "This cooperative effort is 
presenting great opportunities for ministry," said Robert Lupton, a 
longtime urban ministry worker and president of Family Consultation 
Services Urban Ministries.  "We are harnessing the energy of the 
Olympics to revitalize and reneighbor the community." 
...Lupton has worked with the teams from the start to help residents 
see the benefits Olympic partnering can give the neighborhood.  
Summerhill's board and Atlanta's Commission on the Games have agreed to 
demolish the old stadium, employ residents in construction jobs, and 
convert hospitality suites into community-owned real estate.  Project 
partners include the Atlanta Project, several corporate sponsors, and 
24 suburban and community churches.  This summer 27 different youth and 
Christian groups from across the country will come to help with 
building renovations, youth programs, and development.  Some, Lupton 
says, are volunteering as "Christians wanting to live out their faith." 

"If both our names are on a bill, chances are one of us hasn't read 
it," Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) said, about the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act (NIRR 3/22), co-sponsored in the Senate by Orrin Hatch 
(R-Utah).  Last week the House unanimously approved the bill by voice 
vote, and the Senate Judiciary Committee recently sent the bill to the 
floor. The RFRA was temporarily stalled last month by a Bureau of 
Prisons memorandum asserting that convicts should be excluded from the 
act's protection.  Attorney General Janet Reno examined the issue and 
advised that she has no objection to the bill as it stands.  Still, the 
RFRA may be amended slightly to allay some senators' concerns; they 
fear the RFRA might force toleration of otherwise illegal practices, or 
undermine prison discipline.  Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) cast the only 
committee vote against the measure for that reason alone. 
...Nationwide, there is a trend toward suppression of religious 
activity in prisons, according to Prison Fellowship's Roberto Rivera.  
He told NIRR that some state and local prison officials are trying to 
prevent religious groups from ministering in prisons because they see 
outsiders only as security threats.  They have concluded that the 
"separation of church and state means religion should be scrubbed from 
public life," Rivera said.  Prison chaplains, too, are considered to be 
expendable in the search for budget cuts in some 20 states.  The cost 
of incarcerating one inmate for one year is $20,000.  PF's Whitney 
Kuniholm told NIRR it is ironic that many states seek to pull financial 
support for the employees most likely to introduce criminals to a 
transformed life and away from criminal activity.  Some states have 
encouraged ministry activity.  North Carolina's secretary of 
corrections, an evangelical Christian, invited the group to try to 
"turn this place upside down," Rivera said.  In an 11-day evangelistic 
crusade in state prisons, PF held 345 presentations, and a large number 
of inmates were exposed to the gospel at least once.  Kuniholm said lay 
people are coming to minister to convicts. Many realize they don't have 
to be "super-Christians" to make a difference, he said.  PF has some 
50,000 volunteers. Kuniholm doubts government or business can solve 
prison problems; only the church can. 

After more than 45 days in a Cairo jail, four Western Christians are 
free.  The three American men -- Richard Dugan, Brian Eckheart, and 
Robert Cunningham -- were pardoned May 10 by Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak, and New Zealander Thomas Martin (NIRR 5/3) also was released.  
The men had been held uncharged on suspicion of proselytizing, an 
allegation they denied.  Egyptian Abdel-Hamid Adel-Nefa is said to 
still be in a psychiatric hospital. 
...The National Association of Evangelicals had tried to assure the 
men's freedom, but got little help from administration officials, NAE 
spokesman Richard Cizik said.  NAE's Washington director, Robert Dugan, 
was especially interested, since he is Dugan's second cousin.  The 
group's March letter to the White House went unanswered, and assistance 
from the U.S. Embassy in Cairo was slow and "ambivalent," Cizik said.  
Calvin Mitchell, a State Department spokesman for Near Eastern Affairs, 
told NIRR that since the Christians were arrested for breaking Egyptian 
law, to which they are subject while in the country, the U.S. Embassy 
could assist only in limited ways.  The embassy found lawyers for the 
men, and checked on their conditions as often as they were permitted, 
Mitchell said. 
...The NAE, concerned over reports that the men were being mistreated, 
solicited congressional support.  Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), the captive 
Dugan's state senator, spearheaded the release.  Lugar's office feared 
the prisoners might be tortured, and took his request for assistance to 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher.  He reportedly spoke with 
Mubarak to enlist his help with the case.  The lobbying effort now will 
turn to securing Adel-Nefa's release. 
...Cizik said the problems NAE encountered with the case are "not a 
good sign for the future" on religious and human rights issues.  "The 
State Department's record on this is dismal at best.  They parroted the 
Egyptian line back to us, and to our understanding, Clinton didn't do 
anything.  And the Muslims seem to be putting pressure against all 
Christian evangelicals."  In light of the men's imprisonment, the NAE 
plans to confront the congressional foreign aid subcommittee on May 24 
regarding its authorization of U.S. aid to Egypt, which totals several 
billion dollars annually. 

Bernardo Blanco walked past his 15 sleeping captors to freedom, 49 days 
after he was kidnapped by Muslim bandits (NIRR 4/5).  The Claretian 
order called it a miracle, and the Spanish priest said God helped him 
on his seven-mile moonlight walk.  Blanco, 65, had been held in a 
foxhole atop a mountain on the southern Philippine island of Basilan.  
As he reached an outpost at the bottom, he identified himself and told 
the armed men not to shoot.  He told reporters he was relieved to find 
they were government forces and not guerrillas.  Several weeks ago, 
Blanco's original kidnappers turned him over to a fundamentalist Muslim 
group, Abu Sayyaf, for arms and ammunition.  That group also issued 
unmet ransom requests, $400,000 for Blanco, and $160,000 for 5-year-old 
captive Luis Anthony Biel, who was held elsewhere.  Blanco said he was 
treated well, and tried to explain his Catholic beliefs to his captors, 
who gave him literature about the late Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini.  The 
abductions are the latest of more than 400 in the area since 1988. 
...Blanco's escape came just days after government forces waged their 
first attack on Abu Sayyaf.  At least five kidnappers and two soldiers 
were killed in the rescue attempt.  The militia had encircled the 
mountain and given the group 24 hours to release the two captives or 
face a full-scale attack.  Two days into the cleric's freedom, as he 
met with President Fidel Ramos, Philippine military aircraft bombed the 
mountaintop.  Officials cited heavy rebel casualties. 
...The guerrillas requested a three-hour government cease-fire that 
allowed Biel to be released unharmed, five days after Blanco's escape.  
Biel, the son of a wealthy businessman, was abducted in February with 
his grandfather and a chauffeur.  News reports said the family paid an 
initial ransom request of $56,000, and captors freed the two adults 10 
days later.  But the family balked at Abu Sayyaf's additional ransom 
request.  Biel's mother said she prayed for her son's release nine 
hours each day, and that Jesus had answered her prayers. 

The debate continues over Greece's plans to list its citizens' 
religions on their new EC identity cards.  If approved, the country 
would be the only European Community nation to do so.  About 98% of 
Greece's 10.2 million people belong to the Orthodox Church, which is 
considered Greece's official religion, although the constitution 
separates church and state. Orthodox leaders say the faith is a part of 
Greek heritage, and have fought proposed legislation to change 
religious identification from mandatory to optional as a "national 
betrayal."  The law also has the support of the Greek parliament, both 
the ruling conservative and opposition socialist parties, and some 
leftist deputies, news reports said. 
...But listing religious affiliation could lead to discrimination and 
fighting on religious grounds (as in the former Yugoslavia), opponents 
of the measure say.  Non-Orthodox Christians, Jews, Muslims, key 
intellectuals, and the Greek government agree with the EC Parliament 
that the inclusion is unwise.  The cards, to be issued later this year, 
will be the only identification necessary to travel or conduct personal 
and private business transactions in EC countries. 
...Meanwhile, "born-again Orthodox" believers are coming up with 
ingenious ways to survive within their Church, which has government 
support.  Such believers often meet Sunday evenings, so as not to 
conflict with traditional morning Orthodox observances.  To stay within 
the law, they do not conduct weddings, burials, or communion rites. One 
typical church, the 20-year-old Orthodox Apostolic Christian Fellowship 
in Thessalonica, was introduced to the charismatic renewal in 1982 by 
South African visitors.  Since then, the group has grown to 250 
members, 60% of whom are under 30. Although they are suspect to 
traditional Orthodox, they try to mesh tradition with renewal, one 
elder told NIRR.  Services begin with the Lord's Prayer and a Byzantine 
song.  After each of the prayers that follow, worshippers genuflect in 
the Orthodox fashion to quell visitors' fears that they may be a cult.  
Testimonies, guitar-accompanied singing, evangelistic messages, and 
opportunities for private prayer complete the service. 
..."House fellowships" are spreading as well, says Dimitris Iliades, 
founder of the Thessalonian Apostolic Movement. To avoid confusion with 
Orthodox buildings, the Wheaton College-trained leader said the groups 
call themselves fellowships rather than churches.  The meetings are 
geared to be culturally appropriate for Greeks.  Most love to talk and 
philosophize in a private home, but will avoid Protestant church 
services, Iliades said.  So far, Thessalonica has three such 
fellowships.  Others are scattered across northern Greece, several in 
cities where Paul preached the gospel almost 2,000 years ago.  Iliades 
said his foremost prayer request is for more born-again Orthodox 
clergy.  "Once you have a priest with you, the whole scene changes," he 
said. 

"A Church for every people, the gospel for every person" was the theme 
of a two-day conference on world missions. The Colorado Springs-based 
Adopt-A-People Clearinghouse (AAPC) hosted 230 missionaries, 
researchers, and Christian leaders from 107 agencies in a cooperative 
effort to cross denominational and functional lines to spread the 
gospel. 
...The release of A Church For Every People was a highlight of the 
meeting.  The list of unreached and adoptable groups names more than 
6,600 peoples throughout the world who have no credible Christian 
witness or viable indigenous church among them.  The book was jointly 
published by conference sponsors, and categorizes unreached groups with 
ROPAL (Registry of Peoples and Languages) codes, first used by the 
Summer Institute of Linguistics in its Ethnologue. Some groups do not 
yet have codes, said AAPC's Frank Kaleb Jansen, the book's general 
editor.  But the AAPC and other researchers plan to produce evangelism 
profiles by the end of the year for 6,000 of the listed groups. 
...Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Director Don Kammerdeiner's keynote 
address traced cooperative steps to evangelize the world since the 
Lausanne Conference of 1974.  AD 2000 and Beyond's Luis Bush said 
unfolding global events (for example, the decline of communism) may 
accelerate the church's efforts toward world evangelization by 
century's end.  Bush said the growth of the church in the "two-thirds 
world" was unprecedented.  Several missiologists estimated that 80% of 
Christians live in non-Western nations.  David Wong of Asian Outreach 
said the number of Chinese converts has increased from 20,000 people 
per day in the 1980s to more that 35,000 per day in the 1990s. 
...Ralph Winter warned participants against "triumphalistic" arrogance. 
 The founder of the U.S. Center for World Mission listed several 
obstacles to world evangelization: 1) Islam is spreading rapidly, with 
more than 500 million adherents worldwide; 2) the church has failed to 
recognize true Christian revival among those of "non-evangelical" 
faiths (Catholics, Orthodox Christians) and other major world religions 
(Muslims); 3) Western Christians often unnecessarily try to impose 
their culture on these groups; 4) Buddhist and Hindu populations are 
growing, and have high birth rates; and 5) the Christianized West is in 
a sad state, with its fractured families, immorality, and use of 
tobacco and alcohol. 
...As D.L. Moody and A.T. Pierson sought to evangelize the world by 
1900, the consultation targeted 2000 as the date for having planted 
churches among every unreached people group.  In its "Appeal to 
Disciples Everywhere," the sponsors stressed that they were not 
predicting 2000 as the year of Christ's return.  Instead, 2000 would 
mark a significant milestone in reaching the lost with the gospel.  To 
that end, missions technology was prominently displayed.  AAPC and 
Global Mapping Inc., a cartographic research and missions support 
group, showcased their data bases.  SIL and Wycliffe Bible Translators 
also displayed jointly produced audio recordings of the Bible in more 
that 100 languages.  The year 2000 is not "the end," but a beginning of 
a harvest celebration, said Jay Gary of Celebration 2000. 

A new, popular openness to examine the Scriptures may help reverse the 
biblical illiteracy in Europe.  The sparse use of the Bible in European 
education and mass media seems to be creating a generation that finds 
the Bible interesting, according to Fergus Macdonald, Secretary of the 
Lausanne Committee.  Curiosity about the Bible has created a remarkable 
black-market demand for it in Eastern Europe.  A revival of radio Bible 
stories is under way in Scandinavia. And Muslim evangelists, with their 
emphasis on Islamic scriptures, have inspired comparative readings of 
the Koran and the Bible.  Noting that Europeans are not reading many 
books, Macdonald recommended wider use of audio-visual media that 
incorporate biblical text in evangelistic messages.  He said European 
churches can help their contemporaries regain knowledge of their 
biblical heritage and the experience of the Bible's transforming power. 

It won't be an easy conversion, but Operation Mobilization says a new 
electrical system will save the Doulos.  The ministry vessel, 
documented by Guiness as the "world's oldest active passenger ship -- 
built in 1914," is having its electrical set-up changed from direct 
current to alternating current.  For 15 years, the 428-foot ship has 
been used for cross-cultural ministry operations around the world.  
Doulos is docked in Capetown, South Africa, for five months while 
workers perform the DC/AC switch, replacing motors, refitting 
generators, and installing about 20 miles of new wiring.  OM still 
seeks shortterm missionaries (electricians, mechanical engineers, 
machinists, and welders) to help. 

Clarification: Although the Church of the Brethren includes a group 
that supported the March on Washington (NIRR 5/3), several other 
Brethren denominations oppose protected class status for homosexuals, 
and consider homosexual activity sinful.  Gay-rights caucuses within 
mainline denominations are often privately funded. Correction: At the 
National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Los Angeles (NIRR 3/8), 
David Clark was named NRB chairman only.  An NRB offer to show an 
abortion video in a side room was refused.  Member groups with annual 
broadcast revenues under $500,000 will come under the oversight of the 
NRB Ethics Committee; those with higher revenues will fall under the 
jurisdiction of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability.  
Registered attendance was slightly above average, and the NRB says it 
has never cited total attendance figures of 10,000 for any convention. 

...Meanwhile, apostolic Greek believers are coming up with ingenious 
ways to survive within the Orthodox Church, which has government 
support.  "Born-again Orthodox" believers often meet Sunday evenings, 
so as not to conflict with traditional morning Orthodox observances.

Vol. 7, No. 10                                                          
 May 3, 1993 

The turnout of unchurched people for a free, eight-day Christian film 
festival this Easter stunned even its organizer. Thomas Saab, a 
Methuen, Mass., businessman, arranged for the Salem, N.H., Tri-Cinema 
to show four feature-length movies with Christian messages: The Hiding 
Place, The Prodigal, Caught, and Jesus.  Saab, a layman at Salem's 
First Baptist Church, said God had planted the idea in his heart, so he 
put his real estate work on hold for seven months while he planned the 
festival.  He lined up the films, and enlisted pastors and volunteers 
from 80 Merrimack Valley churches. Baptists, Episcopalians, Catholics, 
Salvation Army members, and others donated money, staffed committees, 
put up posters, parked cars, ushered, and counseled.  Each area town 
had a coordinator and ads in its papers. 
...Over the course of the festival, some 12,000 "people streamed in," 
Saab said, and 1,500 were turned away.  The films' producers, World 
Wide Pictures (an affiliate of the Billy Graham Evangelistic 
Association) and the Inspirational Film Project, said the festival was 
unique.  Saab attended all 32 showings in the 525-seat theater, and 
divided the responsibility for giving invitations after each showing 
with local pastors.  Some 350 people came forward to make decisions for 
Christ. Many more were counseled, and thousands received Christian 
literature.  Although he has counted the cost of holding another film 
festival next year, he was touched by people leaving the theater with 
tears flowing down their faces.  He told NIRR, "It's worth every second 
to see lives changed, hearts moved." 

Jesus ranks as a clear rival to the most popular of Hollywood films, if 
you compare audiences rather than boxoffices, according to the 
California group that distributes the evangelistic movie.  The Jesus 
Film Project estimates more than 503 million people in 197 countries 
have seen the film, and 33 million or more have indicated decisions for 
Christ as a result.  The 1977 adaptation of Luke's life of Christ has 
more than 6,300 prints in circulation, more than Disney's boxoffice 
smash Aladdin.  In addition, some 356,000 Jesus videos are in 
circulation (if all copies were sales, the figure would qualify the 
tape as a platinum video by Motion Picture Association of America 
standards).  The world's most widely translated film, Jesus has been 
dubbed into more than 240 languages, with 100 more in progress, JFP 
says.  A portion of sales of the $29.95 videocassette will go toward 
further translations and international screenings. 

The church is growing and blooming in what were the killing fields of 
Cambodia.  Struck by the "incredible comparison between death and life" 
was Bible Literature International President Jim Falkenberg, who 
recently returned from a factfinding trip to Southeast Asia.  Between 
1975 and 1985, the communist Khmer Rouge and leader Pol Pot tortured, 
worked to death, or executed about 2 million people, more than half of 
Cambodia's population.  Falkenberg visited some of the 200 mass 
execution sites around the capital Phnom Penh, which remain strewn with 
the bones and teeth of the victims, bleached by years in the sun.  A 
museum commemorates the mass deaths. 
...Despite the widespread murder of that time, the church is undergoing 
a jubilant rebirth.  In one baptismal service, 137 people made public 
commitments of faith, Falkenberg said.  Believers, ages 6 to 73, came 
from 16 churches and several denominations and parachurch groups, 
including the Christian & Missionary Alliance (the country's oldest and 
largest Christian influence), Methodists, and Youth With A Mission.  
Some had converted after watching the Jesus film, which draws crowds of 
several hundred with each outdoor showing. 
...Open professions of faith are not without danger.  The United 
Nations has stabilized the peace process, but areas of Cambodia remain 
violent.  The Khmer Rouge could regain political control in elections 
this month, or could take it by force, and resume religious 
persecution.  Still, believers, especially those who survived when 
their fellow Christians were killed, said they would rather identify 
with Jesus, no matter how long, no matter the cost.  They were, 
Falkenberg said, "mentally, physically, and spiritually prepared for 
what could be," not worried their lives might be in jeopardy later. . . 
. Some of the missions fields harvested in Cambodia have been sown with 
seeds of humanitarian aid, especially for women (two-thirds of the 
population) and their children.  "God's heart must be broken with all 
the abuse, exploitation and hopelessness in this city," said Overseas 
Mission Fellowship's Rhonda McEwen.  OMF and World Concern teamed to 
put 50 widows to work in a Phnom Penh warehouse.  At a new sewing 
center there, they make book bags and clothing for poor children.  Many 
workers must travel more than an hour by foot or bicycle to work.  
McEwen said the women help each other with work and literacy skills, 
and at least 12 meet regularly with her to discuss Christianity. 
...Similarly, World Relief's Gateway program teaches city mothers about 
preventative health measures, sanitation, nutrition, and hygiene.    
The program is designed to reverse Cambodia's child mortality rate; 
UNICEF estimates that 

each year more than 20% of children under 5 (about 62,000) die of 
malnutrition or preventable diseases such as diarrhea. In addition to 
leading Bible studies, Gateway also cooperates with 26 evangelical 
house churches in Phnom Penh to provide the poor with food, medicine, 
and small short-term loans to help them generate income.  Other 
evangelical and mainline church relief groups, and secular aid 
providers, are working to give Cambodians better irrigation, 
agricultural development, clean water (only 10% is safe in urban areas, 
the world's worst rate), and literacy. 
...Medicine and language study provided a chance to share the gospel 
for the Assemblies of God's Operation Luke. AG teachers were invited as 
English instructors to students of the national medical school.  Often 
future doctors, nurses, and health-care professionals came to know 
Christ as a result of contact and friendship with their tutors. 
...Children continue to suffer the aftermath of the Khmer Rouge's 
"wanton modern-day holocaust," Mission of Mercy spokesman Dan Scherling 
told NIRR.  To help, the agency has set up orphanages, schools, and 
clinics.  The AG also targeted predominantly Buddhist Cambodia not with 
traditional missions, but with relief aid.  The denomination 
established educational programs, medical clinics, and children's 
homes, which are government-owned, but AG-run.  Even though many of the 
children were orphaned by the decade-long reign of terror, few remember 
many details.  Like their elders, they remain hopeful, friendly, and 
open to the gospel, several sources told NIRR. 
...Cambodian believers need three things, Falkenberg said: 1) the 
encouragement of other believers, to counteract the long isolation that 
all Cambodians (especially believers) endured for so long; 2) 
literature, including Bibles translated into Khmer, hymnals (singing is 
"a vital part of worship" for Cambodian churches, which often have 
multiple, joy-filled choirs), and follow-up materials for new converts 
and viewers of the Jesus film; 3) and, most important, on-site 
theological and leadership training for pastors and laity. 
...Returning to their homeland are Cambodian-American Christians who 
fled to the United States as refugees.  A 14-member delegation of the 
CMA's Cambodian district recently completed a month-long mission to 
work with churches in Phnom Penh and surrounding areas.  Many of the 
congregations were founded and funded by Cambodian believers who wanted 
to share the faith and financial success they found in America.  Some 
expatriate pastors revisited their birthplaces for the first time since 
their escape.  As they dedicated new churches and preached, more than 
150 Cambodians professed faith in Christ, and group leader Joseph Kong 
baptized 126 believers.  Kong said he and his fellow pastors were 
overwhelmed by the "openness of the people to the gospel and the 
freedom to minister." 

Egyptian officials will have another 45 days to investigate charges 
against four Western Christian businessmen and their native language 
instructor.  In the meantime, Americans Richard Dugan, Robert 
Cunningham, and Brian Eckheart will remain in prison, as will New 
Zealander Thomas Martin and Egyptian Abdel-Hamid Adel-Nefa (NIRR 4/5).  
Their request for bail was refused by a misdemeanors court.  The 
Americans' lawyer, Ahmed Sharafeddin, said the prosecution was 
considering three main charges: proselytizing Muslims to convert, 
insulting Islam, and fomenting sectarian sedition.  Under a 1981 law, 
suspects may be detained for as long as six months before prosecutors 
indict them. 

Panamanian police arrested a Colombian suspected in the kidnapping of 
three New Tribes missionaries (NIRR 2/22). The man, in Panama 
illegally, was taken into custody in the Darien area near the border 
with his homeland, United Press International reported.  Jungle 
residents linked the man to the Jan. 31 disappearance; they said he had 
been asking questions about the missionaries before they were taken 
captive, and vanished shortly afterward.  News reports have indicated 
the national identity of the suspected kidnappers is either Panamanian 
or Colombian, but officials from both governments and the mission agree 
that the abductors are members of rebel forces.  New Tribes continues 
to negotiate for the release of Mark Rich, David Mancken, and Rick 
Tenenoff, all said to be alive. 

Religious protests over a Christian TV series left six dead and four 
wounded in the Muslim-majority Kashmir state. The predominantly Hindu 
Indian government, which controls about two-thirds of the Himalayan 
state between India and Pakistan, has been running Stories of the Bible 
on state television Sunday mornings for four months.  But Muslims in 
Kashmir said the program's depiction of Islamic prophets like Jesus and 
Abraham was blasphemous.  Although officials temporarily suspended the 
series last month for what they called technical difficulties, its 
return spurred protest.  Reuters said about 500 unarmed demonstrators, 
mostly students, marched through the town to a sandbagged bunker.  
Militants hidden in the crowd shot at paramilitary police, who returned 
fire, killing four students and two cart drivers. 
...The series has led the Pakistani militant group Jamiat-ul-Mujahideen 
to begin an arson campaign against the Indian government.  More than 20 
government cars and seven government buildings have been torched in 
Kashmir in the last month.  A union of government workers said the 
series "hurt the sentiments of Muslims," and demanded that it be taken 
off the air.  Religious-political tensions in Kashmir are 
long-standing.  Since January 1990, Reuters reports, more than 11,500 
people have been killed, and the violence has spilled over into 
Pakistan, which controls the other third of the strangely carved state. 
 Since 1947, India and Pakistan have fought two wars over which will 
control Kashmir. 

 Several million people in Sudan, especially in the South, face 
immediate death and starvation unless Christian and humanitarian 
groups, the United States, and the United Nations can distribute 
emergency food.  Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) told NIRR the famine, 
decade-long civil war, and persecution in Sudan are far worse than the 
situation in Somalia. Government and relief group statistics estimate 
that famine killed at least 250,000 people in southern Sudan in 1988 
alone, and more than 1 million have died of war or starvation during 
the political strife (NIRR 2/22).  Several million more have been 
displaced by the fighting.  The current death rate is 25% higher than 
in 1992, and 60% of children are malnourished, a spokesman for the 
State Department's Sudan Desk said.  Although they are preparing for 
the worst, officials of the U.S. Agency for International Development 
hope to assist groups stalled by the fighting. 
...To help deal with the Sudan situation, Wolf suggested that President 
Clinton enlist Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf. Wolf, who has taken several 
trips to the impoverished land, recently requested that the retired 
Desert Storm commander be named a special envoy to be sure Sudanese 
leaders understand that the United States is determined to stop the 
killing and hunger.  The Islamic civil government in Khartoum has been 
accused of bombing southern towns and villages, which are inhabited 
primarily by Christians or animists, including rebel groups, who are 
also fighting against each other.  In addition, the Sudanese government 
systematically has prevented American and international Christian 
relief agencies from working in the southern areas of Africa's largest 
country. 

U.S. Serbian Orthodox churches took an Easter offering to benefit 
Muslims and Croatians, their long-time enemies, as well as Serbians, in 
the former Yugoslavia.  The bishops requested that the church's 67,000 
members give to a special collection to help women and children, many 
of whom were traumatized or conceived by rape.  All funds will be 
donated to International Orthodox Christian Charities of Baltimore, 
which has sent more than $2 million in medical supplies and food to war 
victims in the Balkans over the last year, according to Alexander 
Rondos, IOCC's executive director.  Some critics told reporters they 
had doubts as to how much of the Serbian-Orthodox aid would reach 
Muslims and Croatians in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but were willing to wait 
and see, news accounts reported. 

The Czech Republic has banned abortions for foreign women, in hopes of 
preventing abortion tourism.  Since Poland passed new abortion laws 
(NIRR 4/5), women have inquired about the possibility of obtaining 
abortions in border towns, Reuters reported.  On-demand abortions were 
free for Czech and Slovak women until the former parliament changed the 
law last fall.  Abortions now cost about $115, unless the pregnancy is 
ended to protect a woman's health. 

Denied: Michael Griffin's request that his trial be delayed until 
"material witnesses" are born.  Griffin, 31, is accused of the Florida 
homicide of abortion provider David Gunn (NIRR 2/22), and has said that 
his self-confessed act spared the lives of several unborn children.  In 
news accounts, defense attorneys said Griffin may have been trying to 
show that Gunn's death was necessary to prevent the abortions, which he 
considered a greater evil.  Griffin will represent himself in the June 
21 trial, with the assistance of an attorney who agreed not to use an 
insanity defense.  Central Florida's abortion clinics now have a 
permanent injunction protecting them from protesters.  Circuit Judge 
Robert McGregor ordered demonstrators to stay at least 36 feet from 
clinic property lines.  In addition, they may make no noise that is 
audible within the clinic, nor may they give literature to passing 
motorists, nor display pictures of aborted fetuses.  McGregor's 
injunction also prohibits protesters from picketing within a block of 
clinic employees' homes. Operation Rescue's Keith Tucci, who led 
Melbourne's "boot-camp" training for protesters, was the first of more 
than 50 pro-lifers to be arrested at the Aware Woman Clinic.  Newspaper 
accounts said business at the clinic had dropped by 70% since the 
protests began.  Nearby Fort Pierce police indicated they arrested more 
than 60 non-violent protesters who violated the injunction by locking 
arms to form a human picket fence around an area clinic.  Rescue 
America and the Liberty Counsel have filed suit, claiming the ruling 
violates First Amendment rights.  Tucci and OR have moved to 
Minneapolis, where they will hold the second of three scheduled IMPACT 
training sessions. 
...Operation Rescue Colorado is looking to pop the "bubble zone" 
recently established around abortion clinics. Gov. Roy Romer signed the 
nation's first state law to bar demonstrators from coming within eight 
feet of workers' or clients' "personal space" if they were less than 
100 feet from a facility.  Sidewalk counseling without a patient's 
permission would be illegal, although sign-waving and message-shouting 
outside the bubble would not.  Violations would be criminal 
misdemeanors, punishable by six-month prison terms and/or $750 fines.  
Civil damages could be additionally assessed.  The bubble was supported 
by abortion-rights supporters and 85 of the state's 100 lawmakers.  
Wendy Wright, a national OR spokeswoman, said the group will not change 
its methods.  Operation Rescue will file a court challenge on 
constitutional grounds.  ORC spokesman Philip Faustin said it was 
appropriate that the legislation took effect during Holocaust Awareness 
Week, since Romer, like Hitler, had signed away "the rights of classes 
of people [he considered] inconvenient and undesirable." 

Maybe there was no Holocaust.  More than one in five Americans believes 
that, said the American Jewish Committee.  A Roper Organization survey 
found 22% of adults and 20% of high school students agreed "it seems 
possible" the Holocaust never took place, and about 15% more replied 
they didn't know how they felt about the event's authenticity. Another 
38% of adults and 53% of high school students admitted not knowing the 
definition of the word Holocaust. Education was the variable most 
likely to increase Holocaust awareness.  The AJC sponsored the survey 
to ascertain Americans' understanding of the murder of some 6 million 
Jews by the Nazis in the World War II era.  But AJC research director 
David Singer said he was "floored" by the "ignorance on a colossal 
scale."  Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, who wrote about his survival at 
the Auschwitz and Buchenwald concentration camps, called the results 
"frightening." 
...Some results were more encouraging: 62% of adults and 48% of 
students knew Auschwitz, Dachau, and Treblinka were concentration 
camps.  The Holocaust, for 60% of adults and 53% of students, clarified 
"the need for the state of Israel" to safe-harbor Jews in times of 
persecution.  And more than 75% in both groups said the Holocaust 
taught that people must speak out against oppression, and minority 
rights must be protected to avoid a similar occurrence.  Some of the 
more than 600 leaders at the National Black Evangelical Association's 
annual convention were white. The March 28 opening session included 
local pastors whose Mission Jackson coalition supported the NBEA's 
three-day "celebration of 30 years of ministry in black communities."  
More than 400 registrants from across the country joined with keynote 
speakers, workshop leaders, and NBEA director Aaron Hamlin to evaluate 
the necessity of a black evangelical organization.  Hamlin told NIRR 
that in the process of "redefining [NBEA's] purpose" much of the 
dialogue showed that it was the only group "that can provide networking 
support across denominational and racial lines."  Hamlin also reported 
at least 25% of NBEA's members and conference participants were young 
leaders (ages 20-35) willing to assume responsibilities in the 
volunteer organization.  NBEA has scheduled leadership conferences this 
fall. 
...Next October NBEA's executive committee also will meet with officers 
of the National Association of Evangelicals.  Following NAE's 
denunciation of racism several years ago, the two groups have been 
discussing reconciliation and how to work together on social-action 
commissions.  A joint national convention is one possibility.  Few NAE 
members attended the NBEA conference, but Hamlin said both groups 
agreed that the time has come "to stop talking about racial issues and 
start doing something about them." 

Community racism and social service bureaucracy are changing a 
Pennsylvania children's home into a Christian one.  The Pittsburgh-area 
Mel Blount Youth Home, founded in 1989 by the former Steelers defensive 
legend, will forego its federal funding and referrals to become a 
private, Christian establishment.  The change comes as a result of four 
years of difficulty directed at Blount, a Baptist African-American.  
After being refused several local properties because of his race, 
Blount finally was able to purchase a 240-acre farm, which now houses 
24 youth from dysfunctional homes, spokeswoman Cynthia Sterling told 
NIRR.  But white supremacists have burned crosses near the home, and 
have sent racist literature and hate mail to the youth home.  Animal 
carcasses were hung around the property, and Blount's staff and family 
have been threatened.  Allegheny County Children's Youth Services has 
tried to revoke Blount's license over his discipline policies and 
required church attendance.  (Government child-care regulations 
prohibit physical contact or mandatory religious instruction.)  But no 
charges of abuse have been substantiated in court, and Blount's success 
rate has been unmatched by other area youth programs, Sterling said.  
Still, one child advocacy lawyer said on television that she "did not 
know if the program worked or not," but that Blount had broken the law 
by spanking children and using corporal punishment.  In a May 3 news 
conference, Blount will announce that if CYS "is not willing to join us 
in embracing our Christian values, then it leaves us no choice but to 
continue our mission outside of their system."  The home will become 
financially independent, and will change its name to note the Christian 
tradition of its care.  Blount will tell local CYS officials to remove 
all children they have placed in his care as soon as the school year 
ends.  His upcoming Zondervan book, The Cross Burns Brightly, details 
many of the situations he has faced with the youth home. 

Waco is a wake-up call for Christians to watch out for leaders like 
David Koresh.  The fiery mass death at the Texas compound waves three 
red flags, said Terry Muck, comparative religion professor at Austin 
Presbyterian Theological Seminary.  Beware of anyone who: grabs for 
absolute authority over other people's lives; claims sole 
interpretation of scripture; or advocates a radical separation from 
society and a world view so pessimistic that "there is no sense of 
hope, joy, or cheer," he said.  Healthy Christianity, he told NIRR, 
teaches about sin, but shows "God is greater than sin." 
...Religious fanatics "claim to lead people to God, when in fact they 
obscure the way to Him," reads a new pamphlet by the American Tract 
Society.  The Garland, Texas, publisher's tract presents the 
"devastating flaws" of cult leaders like David Koresh, Jim Jones, and 
Charles Manson, who all claimed to be Christ, and damaged the 
reputation of the church and its normal religious people.  It lists 
problems with their fanaticism (callous disregard for life, 
dictator-like power abuses, mindless devotion from followers), and 
contrasts them with the message of the historical Jesus. 

Thursday, May 6, marks the 42nd consecutive observance of the Annual 
National Day of Prayer, in which Americans of all faiths are encouraged 
to set aside time for concentrated prayer at work, school, home, or 
church.  "As Americans pray together, we will find new strength and 
guidance from God -- both as individuals and as a nation," said Shirley 
Dobson, chairman of the event's national task force, along with Pat 
Boone and Vonette Bright.  The day of prayer tradition dates back to 
the founding fathers and the Continental Congress.  Task Force 
headquarters in Colorado Springs told NIRR that 48 state governments 
(New York and Connecticut still are pending) have issued proclamations 
or passed resolutions endorsing this year's observance.  And President 
Clinton has promised personally to issue a proclamation, which the Task 
Force had not received as of late April. 
...Contemporary Christian singer-songwriter Michael Card composed this 
year's theme song, Heal Our Land.  As Dobson said, the last few months 
have been difficult for America, which "needs a time of mending."  To 
that end, National Prayer Committee speakers will address Washington 
leaders in the Cannon Office Building.  The observance will climax with 
the Prayer Jam, an evening of concerts organized by Corinthia Boone.  
Dobson said, "I hope millions will agree to acknowledge our dependence 
on God, and thank Him for the blessings this country has received." 

Participants in a May 2-6 Bible reading marathon will not have to stay 
off the grass after all.  Cabell County, W. Va., officials have 
reversed their prior decision to deny Huntington citizens use of the 
courthouse lawn for several hundred volunteers to take turns reading 
aloud through the entire Bible, the Huntington Herald-Dispatch 
reported.  Originally, commissioners concerned about church-state 
separation voted against the marathon, since the Bible reading on 
public land served no "secular purpose," and could set a dangerous 
precedent. 
...Event organizers then sought legal assistance from the Rutherford 
Institute, whose attorney, Randall Trautwein, requested the county's 
policy manual regarding the use of the courthouse lawn.  He also sought 
records of the lawn's use by other groups.  Trautwein indicated that 
the policy was "well intentioned," but "constitutionally in error," and 
the commission unanimously approved a revised measure.  The new policy 
explicitly claims neutrality regarding religion, and affirms citizens' 
rights to assemble peaceably and exercise free speech. 

"As long as it is student-led and student-initiated," prayer is allowed 
at public high school graduation ceremonies, said Jay Alan Sekulow, 
chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice in Virginia 
Beach.  "There is a crucial difference between government speech 
endorsing religion, which the establishment clause forbids, and private 
speech endorsing religion, which the free speech and free exercise 
clauses protect," Sekulow said.  He based his position on case law, 
namely the 1992 Lee v. Weisman Supreme Court decision that ruled only 
school-invited clergy participation violated the Establishment Clause.  
Furthermore, he said, the subsequent Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals 
decision in Jones v. Clear Creek Independent School District upheld the 
district's constitutional right to permit seniors to include a 
student-led invocation at graduation, as long as a majority of the 
class approved.  The ACLJ has launched a national educational campaign, 
placing full-page ads in major media outlets, and sending bulletins 
explaining student rights to the nation's 1,500 public school 
superintendents.  So far, it has cases involving 130 school districts 
in more than 25 states.  The ACLJ was founded by Pat Robertson as a 
conservative counterpart to the American Civil Liberties Union. 

Not all of the 36% of Americans who say they are "born again" are 
fundamentalists or political conservatives. According to a Gallup poll, 
the misunderstanding is perpetuated by the media, which often assume 
all "born-again" Christians agree with the religious right.  Those who 
undergo a "born-again" experience (acceptance of Jesus Christ as 
personal savior and a subsequent spiritual renewal) are often described 
by Protestant denominations as "evangelicals." Gallup reports it is a 
Protestant phenomenon -- only 18% of Catholics call themselves 
evangelicals, but 50% of Protestants do.  Politically, 41% of 
Republicans, 39% of Democrats, and 31% of independents describe 
themselves as "born again." Most likely to use the description are 
blacks (55%) and Southerners (51%).  Women, people over 50, rural 
residents, those who did not attend college, and the less affluent all 
registered in the 40th percentiles.  Only 24% of Eastern and 31% of 
Western U.S. residents said they were "born again." 

G. Raymond Carlson will not seek another term as general superintendent 
of the Assemblies of God, he informed the Executive Presbytery in 
March.  Carlson has headed the world's largest Pentecostal 
denomination, with 25 million members (2 million U.S.), since 1986, and 
has been an executive officer since 1969.  Before that he served as a 
pastor, administrator, and college president.  His successor will be 
elected at its General Council meeting in August. 
...The search is under way.  U.S. Senate Chaplain Richard Christian 
Halverson, 77, has submitted his retirement request to the Senate's 
leadership, effective May 1.  Ordained as a United Presbyterian 
minister in 1942, Halverson has held the position since 1981, but has 
suffered poor health intermittently over the past few years.  He has 
volunteered to remain as chaplain until his replacement is selected. 

The Christian Broadcasting Network's 700 Club will have a new co-host 
come June 14: Terry Meeuwsen.  The 1973 Miss America and Milwaukee 
talk-show broadcaster will replace Christian music artist Sheila Walsh 
Miller.  Meeuwsen has substituted regularly with Pat Robertson and 
co-host Ben Kinchlow for 10 years.  As a working mother of four, she 
said she wanted to bring a family perspective to the CBN flagship show. 
 Walsh Miller had co-hosted The Club since 1988, but left last 
September after an emotional and physical breakdown.  She told viewers 
she hoped they would be as supportive of Meeuwsen as they had been of 
her, and that she will return to school to study psychology and 
counseling. 

Attorney Sam Chappell, representative for Christian singers Sandi Patti 
and Carman, faces an FBI investigation over reported embezzlement from 
the two recording artists.  The Nashville Banner reported Chappell is 
suspected of taking $400,000 from Patti and $110,000 from Tulsa-based 
Carman.  Chappell's wife, Becky, told Banner reporters he left her a 
March 15 confession giving details of his financial dealings.  He 
reportedly met with Carman April 2, and was to meet with Patti, but 
left the country instead, according to Carman's brother, investigator 
Mario Licciardello. 
...Chappell "told me he wanted to face the music," said Licciardello, 
who met him at the airport as he returned to the States.  Chappell, 
Licciardello said, "knew his office was shut down, [and] that he had 
lost his practice."  Chappell met with authorities from the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (contacted by Licciardello) April 15, and that 
evening was admitted to Williamson County Medical Center, supposedly 
having ingested 30-40 sleeping pills, CCM Update reported.  He was 
released the next day, and is said to be staying at his parents' home 
in Texas. 
...Chappell's wife, an Anderson College professor, is at home in 
Indiana, where she has filed for divorce.  She told the Banner Chappell 
left her and their four children penniless, and that she doesn't "know 
where the money is and what he spent it on."  Licciardello said 
Chappell, who "was outliving his means," harbored no separate bank 
account, but was using the misappropriated funds to pay off loans and 
debts.  U.S. Attorney Bob Washko reportedly will handle the case. 
..."Sam has been a longtime friend and represented me in business for 
many years," Patti said.  She said she hoped he would "find the help 
and support he needs," and "if possible . . . make full restitution."  
Carman, too, indicated a longstanding closeness, and expressed concern 
for the Chappell family.  "I just want to see the man well and 
restored," he said. Patti's office said Chappell had intercepted and 
deposited checks intended for her, forged her signature, and opened 
checking accounts without her knowledge.  Chappell had represented 
several other top gospel artists, including the Gaithers, Petra, Kim 
Hill, Ray Boltz, and DC Talk, none of whom has noted missing funds. 

Larry Lea is rebuilding his ministry slowly, despite a drop in 
donations and crusade attendance since his organization was a subject 
of a 1991 ABC PrimeTime Live expos  (NIRR 12/16/91).  His weekly TV 
program, America, Let's Pray, is aired on three cable networks, and Lea 
is preaching in Sunday worship services in churches across the country, 
Charisma magazine reported.  Lea was forced to cut his full-time 
ministry staff from 25 to seven, and was cleared by an investigation he 
requested from the National Religious Broadcasters' Ethics and 
Financial Integrity Commission.  For four months EFICOM examined ABC's 
claims of his false or exaggerated fund-raising requests.  Gay men do 
not comprise 10% of the American population, although the statistic is 
frequently cited, according to a $1.8-million federally funded study by 
the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a former research affiliate of Planned 
Parenthood. Researchers at the Seattle-based Battelle Human Affairs 
Research Center found that only 1.1% of men between the ages of 20 and 
39 had participated exclusively in homosexual relationships over the 
last 10 years.  About 2.3% had engaged in some homosexual activity 
within the same time frame.  The 10% figure, based on the 1948 Kinsey 
sexual research reports, has long been criticized as an 
unrepresentative figure.  Conservative groups such as the Family 
Research Council, as well as some other researchers, say homosexuals 
have padded the numbers to encourage acceptance of their 
political-civil rights agendas.  Other recent surveys have estimated 
the gay male population at 2%-7% of all Americans, and international 
studies generally support those figures.  Almost all researchers agree 
that lesbianism is less common than male homosexuality, and that not 
all survey respondents of either sex will admit openly to homosexual 
liaisons. 

Religious legitimacy was an undercurrent of the March on Washington for 
Lesbian, Gay, and Bi(sexual) Equal Rights and Liberation and its 
related weekend events.  More than 300,000 (far fewer than the 
predicted 1.1 million) homosexual rights advocates flooded the nation's 
capital, and were faced with polarized religious views. 
...A Friday workshop taught how to use Bible passages to defend the 
homosexual lifestyle.  About 80 Catholics, Jews and Protestants were 
reported to attend, according to news sources.  The United Fellowship 
of Metropolitan Community Churches, a largely homosexual denomination, 
also distributed a pamphlet called Homosexuality: Our Story Too.  It 
detailed how to read the Bible through "new eyes" of liberation 
theology.  The tract, written by Los Angeles UFMCC Pastor Nancy Wilson, 
discusses the stories of Jonathan and David, Philip and the Ethiopian 
eunuch, Ruth and Naomi, Peter and Cornelius, and Jesus' relationship 
with Lazarus, Mary, and Martha. 

..."We proclaim our rights together as a couple," declared hundreds of 
gays and lesbians at The Wedding, an exchange of commitment, adoration, 
and fidelity vows that took place Saturday.  The non-sectarian ceremony 
was intended as both an affirmation of love and a protest of state and 
local laws prohibiting homosexual marriages.  Participants, who paid 
$10 for a certificate commemorating the event, were asked to bring 
tokens of affection for use in the service.  Troy Perry, founder and 
moderator of the UFMCC, performed the ceremony near Internal Revenue 
Service headquarters. Heralded were a lesbian couple together for 33 
years, and two gay men celebrating 50 years as a couple.  Perry said he 
wanted to "show Middle America and the world that our relationships are 
as long as those in the heterosexual community, even with all the 
cultural pressures against us." 
...March Sunday began with an 8:30 non-denominational worship and 
communion service at the Lincoln Memorial, where the UFMCC's Donald 
Eastman echoed the words of Martin Luther King: "We, too, are a people 
with a dream."  Several thousand participants sang gay and lesbian 
anthems, and the service, which included United Church of Christ and 
Universalist ministers, was full of biblical references to justice.  A 
banner read, "If Jesus was here, he'd march too." 
...The 1.6-million-member United Church of Christ was the only mainline 
denomination to endorse the march. UCC President Paul Sherry, in what 
he called a "marvelous moment," spoke to the crowd for about three 
minutes on his church's commitment to a "fully inclusive church and 
society."  Perry, who shared the stage with Sherry, said his 
denomination was prepared to supply the armed forces with gay and 
lesbian chaplains, as soon as the ban was lifted. 
...Some groups within the mainline churches endorsed the march, 
although their denominations did not.  Most marched behind banners 
naming their groups and parent churches.  The Evangelical Lutheran 
Church in America, United Methodist Church, Disciples of Christ, 
American Baptist Church, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and Episcopal 
Church sustain programs supportive of ministries to and church 
membership for homosexuals.  So do some Unitarian Universalist, 
Brethren, Mennonite, and Catholic congregations, as well as various 
Jewish groups.  Rarely, however, do mainline denominations ordain open 
homosexuals as ministers or take the position that homosexuality is not 
a sin. 
...Few Christian groups held official protests.  The park service 
issued its only official counterdemonstration permit to Eugene 
Delgaudio, head of the conservative Public Advocate for USA Inc., a 
Northern Virginia group; its several dozen protesters against 
homosexual civil rights said Americans should recognize the "bankruptcy 
of their political platform." That view was supported by Lou Sheldon's 
Traditional Values Coalition.  He said the gay agenda was not only to 
secure rights, but "to change culture."  TVC vowed to "fight this down 
to the very last."  As New York abortion activist Harley Belew (NIRR 
7/27/92) said, "These people are out to take hostage of the nation's 
capital."  Although the National Association of Evangelicals, the 
Southern Baptist Convention, Christian Action Network, Concerned Women 
for America, and the Christian Coalition stayed away from the march, 
they issued statements that indicated most religious Americans would 
not approve of the lifestyle as moral, natural, or deserving of 
protected rights. 
...Christian Voice took a less political view, urging an observance of 
a National Day of Prayer on Homosexuality. Robert Grant, head of the 
conservative religious lobby, said his group's purpose was not "to 
attack or condemn" homosexuals, but "to pray for them and for their 
repentance."  CV suggested that Christians, Jews, Muslims, and other 
religious faiths use their weekly service to pray for homosexuals.  In 
a similar move, members of Exodus International and Transformation 
Ex-Gay Christian Ministry handed tracts to homosexual marchers, warning 
them of their "spiritual jeopardy."  And some ministers stood alone on 
corners with bullhorns, urging marchers to repent. 
...Just as the march had participants whom some homosexuals said 
damaged their credibility, so did Christians. Topeka Primitive Baptist 
preacher, Fred Phelps, and members of his Westboro Baptist Church 
carried signs that read "God Hates Fags," "Hillary  Fags," and "Fags 
Are Worthy Of Death."  Most of the placards also cited Bible references 
in Romans.  Phelps, who has protested at funerals of gays who died of 
AIDS, told reporters, "Sodomy is not a human right." News reports said 
a marcher threw an undisclosed liquid on Phelps, who was treated at a 
first aid tent. 

To Serve and Defend is the second video released by homosexual 
advocates attempting to counteract The Gay Agenda (NIRR 4/5).  The tape 
features more than 20 interviews with military gays and lesbians and 
their heterosexual colleagues in all branches of the armed forces.  As 
part of lobbying efforts to allow homosexuals to serve in the nation's 
defense, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the Campaign for 
Military Service, and the Human Rights Campaign Fund will give each 
member of Congress a copy of the new tape, produced by Parade Pictures 
of Los Angeles. 

Americans choose policy over privacy when it comes to lifting the ban 
on homosexuals in the military, according to a recent poll by the Barna 
Research Group.  Six of 10 adults polled this winter believed that a 
homosexual presence in the military "will make it more difficult for 
some soldiers who are not homosexual to concentrate on their job 
duties." Seven of 10 agreed that the government should be allowed to 
restrict homosexuals from military service "if there is proof that 
their presence would jeopardize the effectiveness of the armed forces 
in times of combat."  Overall, 47% of Americans favor the prohibition, 
while 44% favor permitting gays and lesbians to serve in the military. 

..."American society is likely to collapse," said 70% of U.S. adults, 
"if the traditional family unit falls apart." Though most Americans in 
theory support a person's right to be a homosexual (NIRR 12/14/92), 
pollster George Barna noted, "when it comes down to interacting with 
people whose lifestyle they perceive to be immoral, or whose behavior 
they believe will ultimately lead to cultural decay or lost 
productivity, they draw the line."  Among evangelical Christians, 52% 
consider homosexuality a private matter, 92% consider it immoral, and 
80% favor upholding the ban. 

As Americans debate plans to revamp the military, Russian defense 
leaders are using the Bible to re-evaluate theirs. The Russian-American 
Military Humanitarian Committee Conference, held in Moscow March 
29-April 4, was designed to teach former Soviets how to change their 
military by applying Christian principles.  More than 700 generals and 
colonels from the Commonwealth of Independent States gathered with 
western European and NATO country officials.  Organizers Jeff Jernagon 
of Peopleworks International (a management consulting firm that 
specializes in applying biblical principles in secular environments), 
Bruce Kittleson of the Navigators, and Baroness Rida Von Luelsdorf of 
Operation Helping Hand (a non-profit humanitarian aid organization 
targeting the C.I.S.) joined with three high-ranking Russian defense 
officials to coordinate the conference. 
...In 1991, Russian military leaders asked U.S. organizations to submit 
plans for defense policy changes.  Of the 43 proposals they received, 
they chose Peopleworks'.  Jernagon told NIRR many companies pushed for 
pragmatic American changes for a "75-year-old problem that won't change 
overnight."  He said, "The first thing we told them was that we don't 
have all the answers, but we can share our expertise."  Peopleworks 
also proposed to cover its own expenses, if the Russians paid for 
theirs.  But Jernagon said his final point, "that we would present all 
material from a biblical perspective," was unique.  "Russians have a 
keen interest in Judeo-Christian beliefs because it is the foundation 
of the western society." Jernagon, along with Kittleson and Von 
Luesldorf, reworked a 1992 feasibility study he had done on change 
management in the Russian military, and they negotiated with the 
Russian defense ministry.  The conference date was set for 1994.  But 
Russian officials recently requested that the conference be scheduled 
sooner in light of political tensions.  The rescheduling gave the 
committee only eight weeks to organize. 
...Seventeen Christian leaders spoke on addiction, divorce, social 
change, chaplains' roles, depression, suicide, and family problems.  
Speakers were recruited for their military experience, professional 
expertise, Christian testimony, servant attitude, and ability to apply 
scripture to everyday life in the C.I.S.  The audience seemed surprised 
that U.S. Chief of Chaplains Matthew Zimmerman was African-American and 
a two-star general.  And a military woman, former Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of the Navy for Family Affairs Maryann Drew (and her husband, 
a retired brigadier general), delivered a plenary session address to 
the mostly male audience.  She also met with military wives in an 
afternoon session, the first such meeting for women, who cannot serve 
in the Russian armed forces.  Workshops dealt with integrating 
Christianity with science and professional defense careers.  Overtly 
evangelical seminars explained how to follow Christ and deal with 
practical faith issues; it was the first time the Gospel had been 
preached at the prestigious Higher Military Humanitarian Academy.  A 
patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church addressed military leaders on 
the "great spiritual vacuum which exists in the armed forces," which 
have few chaplains.  "The audience was extraordinarily interested in 
what the speakers were saying," Jernagon said.  "They could not take 
notes quickly enough." 
..."Russians are starving for spiritual, practical answers to life," 
Jernagon said.  He said his interpreter, a former KGB captain, asked 
him about life after death, and the socialist chairman of the academy's 
Political Science department, whom Jernagon debated each night, asked 
to know more about Christianity.  They were examples of "a surprising 
number of believers and seekers who came out of the closet."  As a 
follow-up to the conference, the American Chaplain Corporation is 
working to sponsor an American lecturers' exchange at the academy.  
Ukrainians have expressed interest in a conference in Kiev within a few 
years, and five other C.I.S. projects are being considered. 

Bartering for the Bible: an independent Swedish church has found an 
enterprising way to plant churches in Russia. Rick and Heather Ives, 
missionaries with the small Ohio-based Christ's Church Fellowship 
denomination, report that for two hours each week, the 50-member 
congregation encourages the people and businesses of the town of Finsp 
ng to donate used and surplus clothing and household goods that will go 
to needy Russians.  The church members sort the items, then pack them 
into their used commercial bus, which has all but a dozen seats 
removed.  When the bus is full, about 10 church members (including 
evangelists, musicians, and discipleship leaders) take a ferry across 
the Baltic Sea to Russia.  Once they arrive, they negotiate with the 
mayors of small towns, and offer the relief goods in exchange for 
permission to hold public meetings.  Usually within a week to 10 days, 
they have won enough people to Christ to plant a new church.  According 
to the Association of International Mission Services, when the new 
congregations need pastors, Christ's Church Fellowship supplies them 
with Russians it has recently trained to be clergy.

Vol. 7, No. 9                                                           
             April 19, 1993 

Fortune-tellers and witches are thanking their lucky stars now that 
Connecticut has repealed an 1808 law banning them from practicing and 
promoting their crafts.  The law, perhaps the only one in the country, 
was used last summer when police threatened to jail organizers of a 
psychic fair planned in Mystic.  The event was canceled, but similar 
fairs have been conducted in the state, often without police 
interference.  An intense lobbying effort scratched the law from the 
books. Debate centered on the constitutional and religious rights of 
Wiccans, of which some legislators admitted ignorance.  The proponents 
of witchcraft threatened to sue the state under a 1985 federal court 
decision protecting their religious rights under the First and 14th 
Amendments.  Legislators were concerned that phony fortune-tellers 
might milk customers out of thousands of dollars, but supported the 
repeal when they found state fraud statutes covered the potential 
situation.  Gov. Lowell Weicker repealed the law March 30. 

The darker the Northeast's colleges grow spiritually, the more 
Christians and their values have a chance to shine, said Douglas 
Whallon, New England director of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship.  
Many campuses have radically shifted their traditional cultural and 
sexual boundaries.  "To be a Christian, you either have to bury your 
head in the sand or be a visible presence," Whallon told NIRR.  New 
England InterVarsity groups have grown in just three years from 1,500 
to 2,000 students, with 2,500 expected by next year.  IVCF covers 48 
campuses with 54 groups, including some specifically for graduate 
students.  Undergraduates, though, still comprise 85% of InterVarsity 
members.  Harvard's fellowship group draws 200 students, for example, 
and groups are growing at Yale, Brown, and MIT. 
...The face of InterVarsity is changing, as more ethnic students are 
joining.  One in three participants is Asian. Many can lead groups 
because they come from strong families and solid church backgrounds, 
Whallon said.  Professor Alice Brown-Collins leads the New England 
African-American coalition on the Wellesley campus. 
...Meanwhile, Campus Crusade for Christ is active on 35 New England 
campuses.  CCC is led by a team of area directors based in Hartford, 
Conn.  In addition to evangelism, Campus Crusade has set up Student 
LINC, a toll-free service (1-800-678-LINC) that helps students locate 
InterVarsity, Campus Crusade, and Navigators groups around the country. 
CCC also provides phone advice to students seeking to start ministries 
on their own campuses. 
...The Ivy League schools are active spots for Campus Crusade, as are 
the University of New Hampshire, the University of Maine at Orono, and 
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  A combined group in Boston 
is headquartered at Park Street Church.  On campuses with both 
InterVarsity and Campus Crusade groups, students "often do something 
cooperative as a way to express unity in Christ," Whallon said. 

More than 230,000 U.S. public school students are on official "Release 
Time" to participate in religious education, according to Roger 
Blankenship, executive director of the National Association for 
Released Time Christian Education. He said students from kindergarten 
through high school can be released legally during a public school day 
to receive offcampus religious instruction.  The NARTCE helps initiate 
release-time programs for churches and Christian schools who want to 
give public school children opportunities to learn about Christianity.  
Some older students even receive credit for courses they are taking at 
their churches.  Adherents of other religions also can exercise this 
freedom, highly affirmed by state courts, Blankenship said.  He said 
Jewish and Mormon organizations also are conducting classes for public 
school students.  Some 109 programs are registered with the 
association, Blankenship told NIRR. 

By the grace of God, 17 young Bangladeshi boys were rescued from slave 
traffickers and profound poverty, according to Faith Willard, of the 
non-profit Friends of Bangladesh in Sandwich, Mass.  She said the boys, 
ages 3 to 6, had been abducted by slave traders or sold by their 
parents.  Police rescued the children and arrested the traders last 
April at a Bombay slave house, a transit stop on their way to the 
United Arab Emirates.  There the boys were to become camel jockeys for 
the rich, even though boys often are killed or maimed in the races, 
Willard said.  Indian authorities had planned to keep the children in 
custody until they could testify at the traffickers' trials -- in five 
to 10 years. 
...Alerted by a Muslim professor to the boys' plight, Willard set out 
to gain their custody for the Home of Joy, an orphanage she founded 
seven years ago near Khulna, Bangladesh.  Willard, an evangelical 
Christian, had taken biannual trips to Bangladesh since 1977, but was 
stymied by the Indian and Bangladeshi bureaucracies.  She said she 
camped out for weeks at the offices of government officials, judges, 
and social welfare agencies, until finally they granted custody. 

...Willard said other boys are in similar straits, a fact confirmed by 
Bangladeshi-born Abdul Momen, a Merrimac College professor who 
campaigns against the South Asia slave trade.  He said police 
statistics indicate that in recent years as many as 15,000 Bangladeshi 
children have been sold into slavery annually.  They fetch prices as 
high as $3,000 each -20 years' income in Bangladesh.  Often, 
well-meaning parents are led to believe their children will have a 
better life, including education, health care, and social advancement, 
Willard told NIRR.  She also is seeking the repatriation of 10 
Bangladeshi women sold into slavery in India. 

"Until you are staring pain eyeball to eyeball, it is impossible to 
rescue those who are hurting," Ravi Zacharias said in his South African 
lecture on "Peace and Being Peacemakers."  He spoke to a group of more 
than 1,000 political, business, and church leaders from 10 African 
countries who gathered in Johannesburg.  The Atlanta-based evangelist, 
born in Madras, India, has seen the pain of the poor and homeless up 
close.  He warned leaders in the fractured country that those who 
"strategize from a distance" are not effective peacemakers until they 
reach out personally to those who are suffering. Agreements like the 
1991 National Peace Accord will fail, he said, unless the hearts of all 
South Africans are turned against violence and toward peace by the 
power of prayer.  Zacharias was invited by the Christian Communication 
Trust and Mission Southern Africa, and his speech comes at a time when 
26 political groups (including the National Party, the African National 
Congress, the Democratic Party, and the Inkatha Freedom Party, all 
represented within the Trust) are meeting to decide on a new democratic 
constitution. 
...Leaders said the speech increased their faith that God can bring 
peace to South Africa, and gave them a fresh spurt of energy and 
inspiration.  Antonie Gildenhuys, chairman of the National Peace 
Secretariat, said that "despite the harsh legacy of apartheid, people 
are wonderfully resilient, and, as we reach out, there is often ready 
acceptance."  Piet Lieberberg, chairman of the Christian Communication 
Trust, which invited Zacharias to South Africa, said his group had been 
praying that God would send someone "at this very critical time" who 
was "authorized and empowered to bring to our troubled country, South 
Africa, a prophetic message from God."  Several top leaders, including 
members of Parliament, sought private interviews with Zacharias after 
his speech.  He also spoke in Cape Town and Durban. 
...As race laws change and sanctions lift, Youth With A Mission leaders 
from across the continent will gather in late April for their 
first-ever regional strategy conference in South Africa.  The 80 
officials will arrive from as far as Ghana and Uganda, according to Don 
Price, director of YMAM's operations across Southern Africa.  The 
10-day event in Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg, could help 
South Africa begin exporting "her most valuable commodity,  people to 
share the gospel," Price said.  During the next few decades, YWAM will 
focus not only on evangelism, but on facilitating relief and 
development work all over the continent, Price said. 

No relief organization alone can meet the needs of all the world's 
suffering people, said Fred Gregory, director of World Concern.  So 
seven evangelical groups decided to join efforts to help those living 
in the hottest areas of world conflict.  Executives from World Vision, 
Mercy Corps, Food for the Hungry, MAP International, Missionary 
Aviation Fellowship, and International Aid gathered last month at World 
Concern's Washington-state headquarters under the informal name of "The 
Seattle Group." 
...Each group will lead one or more projects where it already has a 
presence.  Missionary Aviation Fellowship will focus on Albania, and 
World Vision will lead efforts in Sudan.  Mercy Corps is heading the 
work in Kazakhstan. 
...The former Yugoslavia is a special target area.  Mercy Corps and 
World Vision are collaborating with indigenous groups and former WV 
partners like the Lutheran World Federation, International Orthodox 
Christian Charities, and AGAPE, an agency representing several 
Protestant denominations.  All the groups work together to distribute 
humanitarian aid (including medicine, blankets, clothing, seed corn, 
and food) to more than 10,000 refugees and 25,000 households in 
particularly hard-hit camps, towns, and cities in Croatia, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Serbia. 
...Cooperation is not just beneficial, but essential, Gregory told 
NIRR, since needs are growing critical so quickly.  He admitted that 
the groups had, in some past instances, competed for support.  He 
commended World Vision for helping to break the trend last summer.  In 
a practical movement toward relief unity, WV recommended that its 
supporters direct their contributions for Somalia to World Concern and 
other agencies that had operations there, some for more than 12 years. 
(World Vision now has operations in Somalia.) 
...Evangelical groups may be shifting emphasis to include peace-making 
services.  For example, since World Concern had been in Somalia so 
long, the United Nations' Technical Team asked WC's Howard Berry to 
help negotiations between rival warlords.  And evangelicals, too, 
should unequivocally condemn the "ethnic cleansing" policies of the 
Serbs while addressing the spiritual needs of the Bosnian Moslems, 
according to Gregory and Mercy Corps' Ells Culver.  Some feared 
politicizing relief efforts. But most of the Seattle Group agreed that 
preventing civil and religious clashes could reduce the suffering.  
Since the Seattle Group is not a formal organization, others who did 
not attend the first meeting still can join the effort. 

The Uzbeks have their first native-language translation of the Bible, 
thanks to the Center for the Propagation of Scripture in Stockholm, 
Sweden.  CPS funded, printed, and sent 50,000 copies to the former 
Soviet republic's capital, Tashkent, where they are now on sale.  More 
Bible shipments will follow.  Uzbekistan, about the size of California, 
is Central Asia's most-populous state, with a multiethnic population of 
20 million.  Various missions groups say Uzbekistan, with its cultural 
mix of Turkish, Persian, Asiatic, and Russian ways, is open to the 
gospel.  According to reports from Worldwide Thrust and the Caleb 
Project, most of the Uzbek and Tadjik people (about 80% of the 
population) are nominal or practicing Muslims, although several Islamic 
countries are pumping funds into Uzbekistan to propagate the faith.  
Cults, too, are launching evangelistic campaigns.  Uzbekistan has no 
Christian church, but mass media and literature distribution (Uzbeks 
are proud of their literacy rate and literary heritage) help those 
working with Uzbekistan's people.  Elders are highly esteemed, and 
children are prized.  To reach the former may mean to reach the latter. 
 Evangelism and church planting are needed, but "tentmaking" and social 
relief provide the opportunities. 

The "Lone Ranger" methods many western evangelists are using in Eastern 
Europe often are counterproductive, says Denton Lotz, general secretary 
of the Baptist World Alliance in Geneva.  In their zeal to take 
advantage of the fall of communism, evangelists often forget the 
culture of those they want to reach, and may accidentally "lead people 
astray." Lotz cited inadvertent paternalism and patronizing, and 
westerners' confusion of American ideals (that are unfamiliar to 
Eastern Europeans) with matters of faith.  Lotz told 250 European 
Baptist leaders at a four-day church growth meeting in Berlin late last 
month that national Christians are best equipped to make evangelism 
decisions that will affect their countries, even though the funding may 
come from western groups. 

"There's no wiggle room at all," at the Haggai Institute's Singapore 
center for Third World Christian leaders, says the group's senior vice 
president, Harold Keown.  The institute selects Christian leaders from 
Asia, Africa and Latin America, and trains them in advanced leadership, 
management, and communication skills.  It then helps them formulate 
individual strategies for evangelism.  Haggai Institute is particularly 
interested in training Christian leaders from countries that discourage 
or prohibit foreign missionaries.  It gives special consideration to 
leaders from areas where great changes, crises, or Christian oppression 
and persecution are common.  Since it opened in 1969, Haggai has 
trained 14,000 leaders at its center and seminars around the world.  
Graduates minister in 129 nations. 
...And the demand is growing.  Last year, the institute trained 529 
leaders, its maximum.  With a waiting list of 1,500, the group plans to 
build a second facility in a rural area of Maui, Hawaii.  The new 
facility will equal the quality of "something you'd expect at a 
training center for a Fortune 500 company," Keown said.  The institute 
hopes to have its modern lecture rooms, and state-of-the-art audio, 
video, and satellite resources in place by 1995.  Of the $8-$12 million 
projected cost, $6.5 million has been received or pledged.  Keown hopes 
the group can secure the rest with a fund-raising campaign.  Until 
then, Haggai Institute will conduct sessions at a Maui hotel. 

West meets West Bank: Young Life International is breaking ground with 
the youth of Palestine.  The group, in cooperation with the youth 
movement of the Greek Orthodox Church, is training college students to 
help defuse longstanding animosities while spreading the gospel to the 
danger-ridden area.  Young Life missionary David Johnston told NIRR 
that a number of students from Bethlehem Bible College have expressed 
an interest in working in the occupied territory.  Although the school 
is governed by Lutherans, Anglicans, Pentecostals, and other 
evangelicals, most of the interested students are Orthodox Christians 
who want to work with Palestinian teens.  Johnston and his wife, 
Charlotte, will begin training this month, using a YL curriculum 
developed for cross-cultural youth ministry in north and east Africa. 
Johnston, who has served in Algeria and Egypt, will teach students in 
Arabic how to minister, and will direct the field outreach to the West 
Bank's youth. 

There may be an appeal, but for now, the copyright to one part of the 
Dead Sea Scrolls belongs to Elisha Qimron (NIRR 1/11; 2/10/92).  
Jerusalem District Judge Dalia Dorner said that his compiling of a 
composite text "on the basis of research in Jewish law and linguistics" 
was an original work that could be copyrighted, although just the 
translation and ordering of various fragments could not have been.  
Dorner also issued a permanent injunction against further publication 
of the reconstructed MMT scroll without Qimron's permission.  In a 1992 
attempt to broaden access to the scrolls, the Biblical Archaeological 
Society and editor Hershel Shanks published a facsimile transcription 
of the MMT. 
...The decision could have a chilling effect on scholarship, BAS 
officials fear.  Shanks and BAS had maintained that the ancient 
document, including the reconstructed parts, were public domain, and 
granting a copyright would allow a handful of scholars a monopoly on 
access to the scrolls.  Attorney Dov Frimer urges an appeal to the 
Supreme Court. 
...Qimron sought $250,000 in damages and legal costs from Shanks and 
two associates, but was awarded $54,375. Most of the total, $29,000, 
was paid for mental anguish; actual damages totaled $7,250, and legal 
fees and costs $18,125. 

While rebuilding a section of the walls of Nineveh, Iraqi excavators 
unearthed four huge statues of winged bulls. The Antiquities Department 
was clearing ground for its project to reconstruct the ruins of the 
ancient Assyrian capital. Archaeologists believe the beasts guarded the 
city's Nergal Gate, named for the underworld god.  The bulls have the 
head of a bearded man, feet and body of a bull, and large wings folded 
back.  They stand about six feet high at the torso.  Two of the bulls 
are damaged badly, but dig leaders told Reuters they expect to find 
some missing parts.  Winged bulls are a common motif in Assyrian art, 
but archaeologists say never before have they found them used as guards 
to a gate.  They were probably placed by Sennacherib, who ruled from 
705 to 681 B.C.  The conqueror also was known as a patron of the arts.  
The last major excavation to find winged bulls was led by English 
diplomat-explorer Austen Henry Layard, who transported numerous samples 
from the ruins to the British Museum in the 19th century. 

Mike Tyson is not converting to Islam, as The New York Post reported.  
But he is studying the Muslim faith in the Indianapolis prison where he 
is serving (and appealing) a six-year sentence for rape.  Said to be a 
loner, Tyson, 26, meets regularly with Muhammad Siddeeq, a local 
teacher and Muslim.  Siddeeq tutors the former boxing champ for his 
high school equivalency test.  Although Siddeeq conducts Koran studies 
twice each week, which Tyson and about 50 other prisoners attend, he 
denies being a "spiritual adviser."  He also says Tyson has not changed 
his name to Malik Abdul Aziz. Tyson reportedly has gained fluency in 
Arabic, in which he spoke to Malcolm X's widow, Betty Shabazz, on a 
recent visit. But he also attends denominational prayer services, and 
his attorney, Alan Dershowitz, says they discuss the Jewish faith. 
Jesse Jackson baptized Tyson in 1988, and the heavyweight had the 
support of several officials of the National Baptist Church throughout 
his trial (NIRR 10/5/92; 9/21/92; 8/10/92; 3/9/92; 2/24/92). 

Almost two of every five Americans have negative views of Muslims, 
according to an American Muslim Council survey. When asked their views 
of eight religious faiths, respondents ranked Muslims last.  Only 23% 
reported a favorable impression of Muslims, compared with 36% 
unfavorable (41% had no opinion).  Favorable impressions for Catholics, 
Presbyterians, and Lutherans were in the 60th percentiles.  Jews were 
rated positively by 52%.  Muslims were not the only religious group to 
garner low approval ratings.  Only 39% of Americans had positive views 
of fundamentalist Christians, 35% Mormons (33% negative), and 23% 
Hindus (31% negative). 
...The poll, conducted after several Islamic "fundamentalists" were 
arrested in the World Trade Center bombing, showed 56% thought the 
explosion would have a negative effect on Arab-Americans.  On whether 
Muslims are religious fanatics, 43% agreed (24% disagreed), although 
34% believed most Muslims hate terrorism (17% disagreed). 
...Christians should not generalize about Muslims, especially in 
response to events involving followers of Islam, said National Council 
of Churches General Secretary Joan Brown Campbell.  "There are 
extremists of many different faiths, including Christians," she said, 
but "the problem is the extremism, not the faith group."  As in 
Christianity and Judaism, Islam advocates loving one's neighbor.  She 
urged people to "get to know" their Muslim neighbors. 

About 70% of Americans claim to be church or synagogue members, the 
most since 1985.  The annual Gallup church membership poll results show 
a rise of two percentage points over last year.  (In 56 years of 
polling, the 1940s scored the record high, 76%.)  Demographically, 80% 
of worshipers over 65 years old say they are church members, but only 
64% under age 30.  Rural inhabitants (77%) are more likely to belong 
than were city dwellers (65%) and suburbanites (68%). On gender lines, 
76% of women and 64% of men say they are affiliated with a church body. 
 Minorities are more likely to join churches than whites, 78% to 69%.  
Education and income levels show little impact.  Least likely to be a 
church member are Western U.S. residents, at 57%, compared with 73% in 
other parts of the country.  But not all members attend church.  Of all 
church members, 54% did not participate in services in the last week. 
...Within denominations, Catholics are more likely than Protestants 
(82% to 73%) to say they are church members.  Of the respondents who 
say religion is "very important" to them, 85% say they are church 
members, compared with 25% who say religion is not very important.  Of 
self-avowed "born-again" and "evangelical" Christians, 82% claim to 
belong to a church, compared with 63% who do not identify with those 
terms.  Of those who attended church within the last week, 95% are 
members.  Membership is high among Mormons (95%) and the Orthodox 
(82%), although the statistics are based on a much smaller sample size. 
 Comparatively few Jews (58%) say they belong to a synagogue. 

Forgiveness for clergy "failings" and celibacy were the hallmarks of 
Pope John Paul II's letter to priests worldwide. The pontiff was said 
to be referring to the recent spate of sexual-abuse scandals involving 
priests and higher officials and the growing lobbying to allow priests 
to marry.  The pope had shared some of the thoughts from his five-page 
Lenten "reflection" on celibacy with European bishops last winter, but 
news reports said the Vatican indicated the international mailing would 
further the study of "problems associated with priestly spirituality."  
The letter was released  Holy Thursday, anniversary of the Last Supper, 
at which Catholics say the priesthood was founded. 

...The pope also recruited the world's best-known nun, Mother Teresa, 
as a spokeswoman for celibacy.  The 1979 Nobel Peace Prize winner 
helped promote a new Vatican-sponsored book on theology and the 
tradition of Catholic clergy abstaining from sex.  Mother Teresa's 
chapter describes celibacy as "a gift from God," and temptations of the 
flesh to break the vow are called "a chance to participate in the 
passion of Christ." 
...Meanwhile, a book about one priest's failure to remain celibate is 
being sold in Ireland.  Annie Murphy traveled to the Emerald Isle to 
promote Forbidden Fruit, the account of her self-described torrid 
affair with Irish Bishop Eamonn Casey of Galway.  Casey resigned last 
year after Murphy revealed they had a son.  Little, Brown and Co. 
shipped 30,000 copies to Irish bookstores, where news reports said they 
were slow to sell. 

Texas clergy could face criminal charges for sexually abusing people in 
their care.  The state Senate's move to reform private psychiatric care 
includes members of the cloth as mental-health providers.  In light of 
recent sexual-abuse scandals throughout the church, Sen. Mike Moncrief 
(D-Fort Worth) fought an amendment to exempt clergy from inclusion.  
His two-year study of private mental health facilities found some 
officials and counselors, including clergy, were paid for patient 
referrals.  News sources said the eight-bill package is expected to 
pass the House this year. 

And David Crook makes four.  The Catholic Diocese of Belleville, Ill., 
has removed another priest from duty, for the fourth time within a 
month.  Bishop James Keleher asked Crook, pastor of St. George Church 
in New Baden, to step down. He is alleged to have had a sexual 
relationship with a teen-ager several years ago.  Crook is in 
professional treatment, and an investigation has begun.  The diocese 
also has installed its toll-free sex-abuse hotline.  1-800-640-3044 
will assist Southern Illinois' victims of clergy abuse to report the 
misconduct, media reported. 

Minnesota could be the eighth state to protect homosexuals from 
discrimination under state human rights statutes.  California, 
Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Vermont, and Wisconsin 
already guarantee statewide civil rights protections to gays, 
bisexuals, and lesbians in housing, employment, public accommodation, 
and other areas.  The District of Columbia and some major U.S. cities 
passed similar legislation.  Homosexual government workers are 
protected in 10 states.  And the list of areas considering such legal 
moves seems to be growing.  Illinois, Maine, New York, Nebraska, Rhode 
Island, Texas, Washington, and West Virginia all have proposals or 
bills that have passed one house of their state legislatures. 
...But some news outlets report that the trend is turning away from 
granting gay anti-discrimination rights.  One New Mexico bill passed 
the Senate, but was voted down in the lower house.  In addition to its 
gay-rights proposals, Rhode Island also has a proposal to prevent civil 
rights protection to a homosexual "solely in response to his or her 
behavior." Opponents of "special protections" for gays are working on 
statewide referenda and amendments to reverse the policies in 
California, Florida, Idaho, Oregon, and Michigan.  Most of the 
initiatives are likely to gather the number of signatures necessary to 
see that voters statewide, rather than legislators, decide the issue.  
Cities, counties, and municipalities are targeted for localized action. 
 Anchorage, Alaska, will vote this month whether to revoke homosexual 
protections now extended to municipal employees. 

St. Maarten bowed to religious pressure and canceled the controversial 
Caribbean Gay of Gays Male Pageant. Catholic, Anglican, and Methodist 
church leaders across the island had promised "to go to any lengths" to 
stop the show, which they saw as representative of the island's 
social-moral ills.  From pulpits, clergy preached against 
homosexuality, prostitution, gambling, promiscuity, pornography, nude 
sunbathing, and drug abuse.  News reports said the pageant would have 
featured female impersonators from the Caribbean, Central America, and 
South America. 
...The Caribbean is advertised as a gay vacation paradise, although 
churches are outspoken against homosexuality. When 200 gays and 
lesbians demonstrated against Puerto Rico's sodomy laws, hundreds more 
joined a religious counterdemonstration.  Church groups annually 
protest St. Croix's Miss Gay Virgin Islands Pageant. 

Rescue America made the British news this month, as authorities wanted 
to prevent pro-life "radicalism" in England.  President Don Treshman's 
plans for the group to target Planned Parenthood's international 
headquarters in London left some officials and Labour Party members of 
Parliament worried about abortion clinic disruption, intimidation, and 
possible violence.  Abortion is legal in Great Britain, and opponents 
are active, but rarely confrontational.  But Treshman's appearance on 
the BBC's NewsNight was seen as just that.  He said abortionists were 
like Nazis, civil disobedience was permissible to prevent a greater 
evil, and that the shooting of Florida abortionist David Gunn should 
not be condemned because "morally it can be justified" (NIRR 3/22). 
...Treshman was arrested outside the BBC on grounds that his presence 
"was not conducive to the public good." Plans to deport him began 
immediately.  Had paperwork been completed, one Home Ministry official 
said, Treshman 

would not have been permitted to enter England.  After being detained a 
few days, he was freed on $6,000 bail after promising in writing to 
curtail any abortion protest that could lead to violence or public 
disorder. 
...Treshman blasted the government for being pawns of the media, 
abortion profiteers, and pro-choice apologists. At a news conference 
after his release, he described his "concentration camp" detention as 
based on "libelous hearsay."  He said he originally had planned to 
leave England April 13, one day before the deportation order took 
effect, but he may challenge the interior department's decision. 
..."We are planning a mass offensive here," Treshman told reporters.  
The group promised to use "direct action," including blockades of 
clinics and chaining their doors shut.  RA denied that it planned any 
violence.  "The violence is inside the clinics," said Patrick Welch, a 
Catholic priest and RA member.  Already police have arrested eight RA 
activists who barricaded themselves inside a Birmingham clinic.  They 
say one unborn life was spared. 

North Dakota's 1991 abortion law finally was enacted, after a brief 
delay by Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun.  The Roe v. Wade author 
had obliged a request by the Fargo Women's Health Organization, the 
state's only abortion provider.  The clinic has pending a legal 
challenge to the law, which requires a 24-hour-waiting period after the 
pregnant woman is informed of medical risks, the approximate age of the 
fetus, and abortion alternatives.  The clinic insists that the state 
restrictions are burdensome, since many women travel great distances to 
reach it.  The Supreme Court voted 7-2 to lift Blackmun's stay, and 
allow the law to go into practice, the appeal notwithstanding. 
...But Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David Souter signaled a move to 
change how states analyze abortion laws before enacting them.  They 
urged that the "undue-burden" test, established in the high court's 
Casey decision, be used to determine whether "in a large fraction of 
the cases," but not all cases, such an obstacle existed.  News services 
said the view could lead to greater challenges of abortion laws before 
they are enacted.  The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments 
this month to determine the North Dakota statute's legality. 

Three Michigan Christian schools vow to continue their fight for what 
they see as freedom from state interference. A state Court of Appeals 
decision affirmed the Department of Education's right to require church 
and private schools to submit annual reports detailing course 
offerings, teacher qualifications, enrollment, and the school schedule, 
news sources reported.  The church-schools claimed the requirements 
violated their free exercise of religion under the First Amendment. But 
the Michigan Supreme Court refused to review the appeals court ruling, 
and left the mandates in place.  "We want to be good citizens, but we 
won't grant the state the authority to dictate who we can hire and what 
we teach," said Bob Baldwin, spokesman for the Michigan Association of 
Christian Schools. 

The carol of the bells will continue in Pompano Beach, Fla., but only 
for two minutes an hour.  A new city ordinance has solved a noise 
problem that arose last November.  Residents who lived near First 
Presbyterian Church complained that the church's recorded bell music 
exceeded the city's noise limit of 55 decibels.  Five other churches 
(Episcopal, Lutheran, and Catholic) also were cited for music that was 
too loud.  Although the city exempted the churches from the decibel 
limits, the bells may ring each hour, except between 8 p.m. and 7 a.m. 

Another Scientologist has filed a lawsuit against the Chicago-area Cult 
Awareness Network and its executive director, Cynthia Kisser.  Glenn 
Barton of Los Angeles seeks $1.15 million in actual, compensatory, and 
exemplary damages for "profound mental distress."  He says he was 
threatened publicly with arrest if he tried to attend CAN's national 
convention. Barton's suit says he met all membership requirements and 
paid to attend the four days of meetings, but that security guards 
refused him entrance, allegedly because of his religion.  Barton says 
he attempted to register twice each day, and alleges that Kisser and 
CAN President Patricia Ryan refused to tell him why he was unwelcome at 
the meetings.  Other CAN representatives, the suit claims, made "false, 
degrading, and upsetting" comments about Barton's religious beliefs.  
Kisser said Scientologists have been seeking to join CAN, which 
circulates information about religious groups it considers cults. CAN 
officials see the Scientologists' lawsuits (more than 30 in all) as 
"harassment" and an attempt to shut down the organization (NIRR 
10/19/92; 3/23/92; 2/10/92). 
...The Church of Scientology will get back $80,787 from the Internal 
Revenue Service, but it is not a tax refund. The IRS has been ordered 
to compensate the Boston church for its legal fees for fending off an 
unjustified IRS request for church records, the District Court of 
Appeals in Boston ruled last month.  The court, in 1990, and a later 
federal appeals court decided the IRS' request for "relevant" documents 
to substantiate tax liability were not necessary.  Often considered a 
cult, the Scientologists have the support of many established church 
groups in their battle with the IRS. 

"I believe the jury realized how rotten the IRS is," said acquitted 
Ohio faith-healer Leroy Jenkins.  The pastor of Healing Hill Cathedral, 
after one mistrial, was retried on two counts of income tax evasion.  
The Internal Revenue Ser

vice had accused Jenkins of failing to pay about $47,000 in 1987 and 
1988 taxes.  Ten of Jenkins' supporters held signs urging the IRS to 
"Leave the Church Alone."  Jenkins' lawyer, Thomas Tyack, said the IRS 
could have used a civil audit and penalties (not a five-year inquiry, 
15 weeks of criminal trials, and 140 expert witnesses) to collect any 
taxes owed. 

After a year-long injunction against requesting church records from 
Robert Tilton, Texas Attorney General Dan Morales may begin an 
examination of the televangelist's Word of Faith World Outreach Center 
Church near Dallas.  The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans 
lifted the ban that kept Morales from investigating the church under 
the state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act (NIRR 4/6/92).  J.C. Joyce, 
Tilton's Tulsa attorney, says he'll appeal all the way to the Supreme 
Court if necessary.  He called the litigation "absurd," and 
unnecessarily costly to taxpayers.  Tilton's fundraising and ministry 
methods were questioned on PrimeTime Live in 1991 (NIRR 12/16/91; 
12/2/91).  The ministry has lost money since the telecast, and some 
former followers have sued for fraud.  Tilton has also sued ABC News 
for defamation (NIRR 11/30/92), and the network has mitigated some of 
its earlier statements. 
...Faith-healing televangelist W.V. Grant says he, too, has suffered 
financial loss since the PrimeTime investigation. Among his concerns is 
the future of a ministry orphanage that houses 3,000 Haitian children.  
In a "confidential" letter to donors, published by the Dallas Morning 
News, he asks to borrow $50 from each donor toward its maintenance.  
Grant wrote, "We had to sell every piece of property the church has 
owned for years, except one."  Reporter Steve Blow found this 
technically true, but he also discovered that Grant and his wife, 
Brenda, and his evangelistic association, own five other Dallas 
properties, assessed for taxes between $73,400 to $900,000 each.  Blow 
also notes the Grants have a Breckenridge, Colo., lodge, and have 
recently held registrations on late-model Ferraris and Mercedes coupes. 
...Attorney Dennis Brewer said the letter referred only to properties 
held by the International Deliverance Churches Inc., a non-profit 
corporation.  He allowed Grant only to say that he had no equity in any 
of the properties or cars, no savings, and that more than half the 
staff of Eagles Nest Church had been laid off since the ABC report 
aired in 1991. 

Settling the debt at $50,000: Jerry Falwell and the Internal Revenue 
Service.  After a four-year investigation, the IRS revoked the 
tax-exempt status of the Old-Time Gospel Hour, the broadcast ministry 
of Falwell's Thomas Road Baptist Church, in Lynchburg, Va.  The IRS 
alleged that in 1986 and 1987 OTGH raised funds that were improperly 
used by a now-defunct political action committee.  The Lynchburg News & 
Advance reported an anonymous source familiar with the probe as saying 
the I Love America committee, a conservative PAC founded by Falwell's 
Moral Majority in 1980, used OTGH's mailing lists to raise funds, but 
did not pay to use them, an illegal benefit.  In addition to repaying 
the back taxes, OTGH will undergo some reorganization to prevent such 
incidents from happening again.  The ministry also will regain restored 
tax-exempt status for 1986 and 1987.  That means contributors do not 
need to revise their income tax returns for those years, said Mark 
DeMoss, Falwell's personal spokesman. 
...Falwell's penalty was like "a slap on the hand," said Arthur Kropp, 
president of People For the American Way. He says OTGH raised about $94 
million during the two years in question.  But church-state 
separationists are encouraged by the seeming crackdown on political 
activities by ministries.  After the 1987 PTL scandal, the IRS began 
examining more than 30 television ministries, including Falwell's.  At 
last count, 15 audits were on-going. 
...Still unsettled: News sources say Liberty University owes $73 
million, to be retired over the next seven years, if creditors approve 
the plan.  The IRS has filed two tax liens, totaling $128,000, against 
the university.  School tax consultants agree that LU owes the money, 
but put the figure at about $77,000.  LU and the IRS are negotiating to 
drop the latepayment penalties, but not the taxes.  Last year, debts 
for the OTGH reportedly reached $37.6 million. 

The Internal Revenue Service is seeking better documentation for 
non-profit organizations' executive salaries.  New data requested on 
the 1992 Form 990 informational tax return will help the IRS be sure 
non-profits don't conceal how much they pay their "key employees," who 
do not always hold an obvious title like director or trustee.  A new 
question asks whether any such employee received "aggregate 
compensation of more than $100,000 from your organization and all 
related organizations, of which more than $10,000 was provided by the 
related organization?" 

Charities' postage rates could jump by 30% over the next three years, 
if Congress enacts a U. S. Postal Service plan. Under the measure, many 
types of non-profits, including advocacy groups and fraternal 
organizations, could not mail at subsidized rates.  The Chronicle of 
Philanthropy reports that if passed, the proposal would: 1) prohibit 
charities from mailing announcements containing advertising (except for 
"incidental announcements of fund-raising events") at third-class 
non-profit rates; 2) prevent charities from using second-class 
non-profit rates to mail publications with 10% or more of their space 
devoted to advertising; 3) bar advocacy groups, business leagues, and 
fraternal societies from using non-profit rates; 4) increase rates over 
a period of time for those who would still be eligible for the 
subsidies; 5) require Congress to give the U.S.P.S. $92 million to 
cover costs of non-profit subsidies and losses on charity mail 
delivery. 

After 18 years together, Christian comedian Mike Warnke and Word Inc. 
terminated their business relationship April 5.  Warnke's 13 recordings 
and two videos will be handled by The Mercy Company, run by Rose 
Warnke, in Burgin, Ky.  The self-avowed former Satanist came into 
question last summer with the publication of two articles about his 
ministry and personal life (NIRR 11/2/92; 8/24/92; 7/27/92; 7/13/92).  
In January, Warnke admitted his biography was embellished for 
entertainment value, but said his intent was not to deceive. 
...Warnke also appointed a five-man "board of elders" to investigate 
and suggest disciplinary actions, to which he would submit.  The men 
agreed his background was in dispute, but said testimony "validate[d] 
involvement with the occult."  Warnke, the board urged, should 
restructure his ministry for clearer corporate and financial handling, 
and should apply for membership in the Evangelical Council for 
Financial Accountability.  He could be, they said, more candid about 
his personal failures and sins, for which he has, in formal statements, 
asked forgiveness. 

Charismatic renewal pioneer Graham Pulkingham is comatose in a 
hospital.  The Episcopal priest, under investigation for homosexual 
activities (NIRR 8/24/92), was shopping with his wife at a Burlington, 
N.C., Winn-Dixie April 1 when a disgruntled employee pulled a handgun 
and opened fire in the store.  Pulkingham, 66, collapsed with his third 
heart attack in 11 years.  Pulkingham was left without oxygen for some 
time while police stormed the store and killed the gunman. Paramedics 
rushed him to a nearby hospital where doctors restarted his heart, but 
he is brain dead.  His family has decided against any special 
life-saving measures.  The Diocese of Pittsburgh inquiry will end upon 
his death. 

Steven Curtis Chapman carried away six Dove Awards from the Gospel 
Music Association.  Besides being named artist and songwriter of the 
year, he also won four other awards for his best-selling album, The 
Great Adventure.  It and its title cut were honored as best 
contemporary album, recorded song, and short-form video.  Chapman 
shared the Song of the Year award with collaborator Geoff Moore.  In 
other key awards, Michael English was named top male vocalist for the 
second year running.  Twila Paris took the honor for best female 
vocalist, displacing 11-time winner Sandi Patti (who was not nominated 
this year) and the ever-present Amy Grant (who was).  (Patti's schedule 
was curtailed after her highly publicized divorce last year, and Grant 
focused on continuing her pop cross-over success.)  Cindy Morgan was 
named best new artist, and 4 HIM won group of the year.  Barbara 
Mandrell hosted the 24th annual awards presentation from the Tennessee 
Performing Arts Center in Nashville. 

The full communion movement continues, as leaders from the Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in America met with about 30 officials and theologians 
from nine denominations to consider two proposals potentially joining 
ELCA in full communion with any or all of four church bodies.  One 
proposal to be presented to the Churchwide Assembly would urge 
fellowship with the Episcopal Church; the other with the Presbyterian 
Church (U.S.A.), the Reformed Church in America, and the United Church 
of Christ.  The groups defined full communion as withdrawal of 
historical condemnations of other churches, provisions for the exchange 
of ordained ministers, and close working conditions without losing 
theological characteristics of each church.  ELCA representatives 
supported approval of both steps as "confessionally faithful and 
ecumenically fruitful."  Also attending the Delray Beach, Fla., meeting 
were leaders from the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the 
Orthodox Church in America, the United Methodist Church, and the Roman 
Catholic Church.  ELCA and the RCC also met recently to consider their 
common 20th-century beliefs rather than their 16th-century differences. 
 Most at issue was justification by faith rather than works.  Chief 
legislative bodies of the communing churches will consider the 
propositions by 1997. 
...The Church of the Lutheran Confession ended discussions over "church 
fellowship" with the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod and the 
Evangelical Lutheran Synod.  The doctrinal talks, under way since 1988, 
were at an impasse, the CLC said, since neither the WELS or ELS agreed 
with the CLC on terminating relationships with heterodox or liberal 
Lutheran church bodies.  The conservative CLC broke from the Missouri 
Synod in 1960. 

Is a common communion cup a health hazard?  Potentially, says a new 
study by Terrence Furlow, a Lexington, Ky., physician, and Mark 
Dougherty, an infectious disease specialist.  They studied 16 silver 
and ceramic communion cups used at eight services at St. Michael's 
Episcopal Church, Furlow's home church.  They discovered normal 
bacteria found in the mouth that do not cause disease, but also noted 
instances of infection-causing bacteria.  At least half of the cups 
examined held bacteria that can cause pneumonia or infections of the 
skin or kidneys.  Three cups harbored staph bacteria, and another three 
meningitis bacteria.  Two cups grew both, one with an additional 
bacterium that causes respiratory infections. One cup had bacteria 
before communion use, and wiping the rim or rotating the cup did not 
eliminate the germs.  In a letter to the Annals of Internal Medicine, 
the researchers urged changing from a common cup to dipping the host 
into the cup or using separate communion cups to avoid possible disease 
transmission.

Vol. 7, No. 8                                                           
              April 5, 1993 

The number of Christians in Mongolia has jumped from fewer than 15 to 
1,000 in two years, and churches now exist, reports World Evangelical 
Fellowship.  WEF's former international director, David Howard, visited 
the country, sandwiched between Russia and China, in January.  
Mongolia, about twice the size of Texas, has been without Christian 
influence for centuries.  Lama Buddhism predominated long before 
communism introduced atheism to the country's 2.2 million people.  
Without a church for 700 years, Mongolia is changing, Howard says.  In 
1991 the country abandoned Russian politics.  Now, about 2,000 people 
attend church weekly.  Most churches are in the cities, six in the 
capital Ulan Bator. Christians are meeting for Sunday services, Bible 
study and prayer in 10 of Mongolia's 18 provinces. 
...In the last two years, Korean, German, Danish, Japanese, and Swedish 
groups have sent Christian workers to Mongolia, but WEF reports most 
missions are U.S.-based.  Asian Outreach, Campus Crusade for Christ, 
Youth With a Mission, the Assemblies of God, the Orthodox Presbyterian 
Church, and the Southern Baptist Convention are doing  evangelistic 
work.  But Howard says Bible translation and discipleship will present 
challenges.  All of the New Testament and parts of the Old have been 
translated, but differing concepts of and terms for God are problems, 
as is selection of a writing script.  In place are a small language 
school, and an educational facility for missionaries' children.  AG 
Asian Field Director Robert Houlihan indicates that people-oriented 
humanitarian and relief outreaches would help relations with the 
government, in the process of turning from socialism.  Already, 
health-care workers and language specialists are in place. Converts 
need Bible training to strengthen the foundations for future work.  So 
Christian relief workers request more church planters, since Mongolia 
may have only a "five-year window of opportunity." 

The world has "remarkably few" people who claim to be atheists or 
agnostics, according to a recent Gallup poll.  Of the countries 
included in the survey, Uruguay recorded the highest averages, with 7% 
saying they are atheists, and 3% calling themselves agnostics.  Next 
highest were Great Britain, Bolivia, and the United States, in which 
combined percentages for atheists and agnostics total 4%.  Overall, 
percentages for "no religious preference" were highest in South Korea 
(41%), the Netherlands (35%), and Britain (21%).  Judaism draws about 
2% of the U.S. population, but only 1% or less in other Western 
countries; Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism each claim 1% or less of 
Westerners. 
...Christianity was the overwhelming religious choice of the Western 
world, ranging from 90th percentile highs in Ireland and Mexico, in 
which Catholic percentiles topped 85%.  Of Portugal's Christian 
population (87%), nearly all were Catholic.  Protestantism was 
strongest, compared to Catholicism, in Scandinavia (83%), the United 
States (56%), and Britain (54%).  German Christians (85%) were split 
fairly evenly between Catholics and Protestants.  In all surveyed 
western countries, at least three of every five respondents called 
themselves Christian. 
...In the countries covered in Eurasia and Africa, Christians 
predominated only in the Philippines and Nigeria, at 97% (mostly 
Catholic) and 63%, respectively.  Thirty-three percent of Nigerians 
said they were Muslim.  Turkey was 97% Muslim, with less than 1% 
claiming the Christian faith.  India, about 90% Hindu, registered 3% 
Christian.  Of South Koreans expressing a religious choice, 27% were 
Christian (19% Protestant) and 28% Buddhist. 

Americans retain Christianity as their popular faith, but they're 
"smooth[ing] its sharper edges," according to a Barna Research Group 
poll.  Religion was "very important" to 79% of Americans surveyed, and 
87% said God hears people's prayers and has the power to answer them.  
"Jesus Christ rose from the dead and is spiritually alive today" was 
confirmed by 80%, but only 70% said he would come back.  The Bible's 
teachings were "totally accurate" to 55%, and 46% said it was a 
personal responsibility to share their faith with others.  Almost three 
in four said ministers were expected to live up to higher moral-ethical 
standards than the general populace. 
...Church-going, daily Bible reading, and being "born-again" usually 
correlated to belief in "classic" Christian tenets.  For example, Jesus 
was as human as anyone on earth while he was here, said 82% of all 
respondents, 84% of churched, and 87% of born-again Americans.  But 
overall, 49% thought he sometimes made mistakes, a belief supported by 
36% of the churched and 24% of the born-again.  The general population 
also was less likely to subscribe to salvation through Jesus alone: 62% 
said it was unimportant which specific belief one held, since "all 
faiths teach similar lessons about life."  Only 53% of the churched and 
43% of the born-again respondents agreed.  Forty-four percent of those 
surveyed said "all good people," whether they believe in Jesus or not, 
will go to heaven after death, a belief upheld by 32% of the bornagain, 
but 48% of church-goers. Evangelical Christians are not who the 
national media say they are, according to a poll sponsored by the 
Christian Coalition.  Florida-based Market Research Institute, an 
independent polling organization, found that of 1,529 surveyed 
registered voters, 600 whites and 140 ethnic minorities identified 
themselves as evangelicals, Protestants, or Catholics who attend church 
at least twice monthly.  The "ethnic majority sample," or whites, 
accounted for 39% of the general voting population, and its demographic 
profile revealed: 71% were Protestant; 39% had annual incomes over 
$50,000, (median household income of $40,000); 65% worked in 
white-collar or managerial occupations; 66% had education beyond high 
school graduation; 76% were married, 66% with children; 61% were women; 
median age was 44.  The poll was conducted in February.  (In that month 
The Washingon Post described followers of the religious right as 
"largely uneducated, poor, and easy to command."  The paper soon after 
retracted its statement as "without basis in fact.") 
...Church-going voters gave the media elite a disapproval rating of 
52%.  Asked which institutions they trusted most, respondents indicated 
the church, at 78%, compared with the news media's 5% rating.  An open 
anti-Christian media bias was recognized by 53%, and 62% credited news 
outlets as a "major factor" in Clinton's election victory.  
Politically, church-going voters polled were twice as likely to vote 
Republican than Democrat, and are highly supportive of school choice, 
tax reductions, voluntary student prayer, and public school programs 
that promote sexual abstinence. 

It's time for a truce between Christians and the news media, Chuck 
Colson said, since they both "live or die by the same First Amendment." 
 Speaking to the National Press Club for the first time since his 
Watergate conviction, Colson urged the press to "recognize the good" of 
what the church does.  He cited his Prison Fellowship's Project Angel 
Tree, which gives Christmas gifts to children of prisoners, as a 
positive religious story unreported by the secular press. 
...Both sides also should stop perpetuating stereotypes.  Colson 
mentioned the Post story, and charged that other media incorrectly 
tended to judge all Christians for the actions of a few religious 
"zealots."  He hoped that Christians, too, would stop identifying all 
reporters with those whose perceptions were inaccurate. 
...On other topics, Colson said: 1) the U.S. criminal justice system is 
"the worst in the world," and politicians of both parties (not 
corrections officers) are to blame for its failure to rehabilitate; 2) 
non-violent criminals do not always require incarceration, and can be 
taught "the difference between right and wrong"; 3) the Clinton 
administration is right to freeze $37 billion in new prison 
construction; 4) "The sickness of the soul leads to crime"; 5) 
Christianity can remedy the growing crime rate by transforming 
individual lives and creating "an impulse to do good"; 6) gun control 
is inevitable, since America has "a violent society plagued by fear." 

About 72% of Americans are concerned about the effects of television 
violence, especially when it's dramatized, according to a nationwide 
Times Mirror poll.  They are more forgiving of real-life violence, 
although they wish news programs and true-crime-action shows would 
broadcast fewer violent incidents.  Overall, 80% think the violence on 
TV entertainment shows is harmful to the country.  Least concerned 
about TV violence were low-income, young, non-white males, who were 
also most likely to watch real-life violence shows.  Network and cable 
executives have agreed to assess the violence problem and offer 
positive programming solutions, especially during early evening hours 
and in children's shows.  Television watchdog groups have applauded the 
promises, news reports said. 
...German and British authorities want less sex, and are asking the 
European Community to revise its rules on crosscountry satellite 
transmissions.  The EC's television without frontiers policy allows 
broadcasts into all 12 countries of material found acceptable by any 
one of them; but it also specifies that countries have the right to ban 
pornography. 
...In Germany, media watchdogs and Interior Minister Rudolf Seiters 
vowed to keep out hard-core sex, in the interest of protecting German 
youth.  (The EC directive has a clause to protect minors from serious 
impairment of their "physical, mental, or moral development.")  Still, 
former porn queen Teresa Orlowski has begun VTO, a Hanover-based sex 
video and magazine publishing company.  VTO will air 20 minutes of 
soft-core sexual fare beamed from Britain after midnight, but come 
April, hard-core programming begins on The Adult Channel, which would 
require viewers to have special signal decoders.  Hanover prosecutors 
have said they will prosecute VTO. 
...In England, government officials moved to ban Dutch-produced, 
Danish-beamed Red Hot Television, fearing that children will witness 
the sometimes violent sex shows.  The broadcasts violate good taste and 
decency standards, according to the National Heritage secretary, Peter 
Brooke.  Denmark and the EC have been given 15 days to resolve or 
appeal the issue before Britain bans the 18 hours of broadcasts.  
England may also criminalize sales of decoding equipment (more than 
25,000 have been sold to date) and advertising for the station.  
Continental Television, which runs the service from London, won 
permission to fight the ban in court. 

How did Branch Davidian cult-leader David Koresh choose his name?  
David comes from the biblical King David, of whom the Branch Davidians 
say they are the anti-types, or postfigurations.  Koresh, is said to 
refer to King Cyrus, whose anti-type will destroy modern Babylon in the 
last days.  Koresh, born Vernon Howell, is also said to answer to 
Vernon Jezreel, or just Jezreel, "the avenging God."  Koresh says God 
told him to change his name. 
...Based on defectors' reports, Koresh has five fundamental beliefs: 1) 
he is the son of God, Jesus Christ reincarnate, sent back to earth by 
God the Father to experience sin and evil, which he did not do the 
first time (Jesus died only for those who lived before his work on the 
cross).  As a "sinful" Messiah, Koresh can better judge a sinful earth. 
 His father is God, his mother is the Holy Spirit, the female person of 
the Trinity (as in Shekinah); 2) he is the king of God's kingdom, which 
will destroy all others and eventually rule the world.  This is the 
likely reason for the arsenal.  No time frame has definitely been set, 
although Passover and Easter have been reported to be past-prophesied 
dates for the end of the world in Davidian history; 3) he owns, as the 
son of God, all things and people.  For this reason, only he is allowed 
to have sex with followers.  Koresh sees possession of material goods 
(including wives) by others in the cult as theft of his belongings; 4) 
he alone is able to interpret Bible prophecy correctly.  The seven 
seals of Revelation are of special importance; 5) he alone can teach or 
even read the Bible, since only those who can give a proper 
interpretation of the seven seals hold that right.  An internal memo on 
Koresh's theology was circulated by the Seventh-day Adventists' 
communication department, headquartered in Silver Spring, Md.  The 
denomination has received "non-stop" media phone calls asking about the 
cult, a five-time offshoot of a disfellowshiped splinter group. 

Sex allegations have forced the removal of three Roman Catholic priests 
from the southern Illinois Belleville diocese. Jerome Ratermann, pastor 
of Belleville's Blessed Sacrament Church, left after he was accused of 
sexual misconduct while he was principal of Mater Dei Catholic High 
School.  Robert Vonnahmen, pastor of St. Joseph's Church in 
Elizabethtown and a former director of Camp Ondessonk, agreed to step 
down while church officials investigated an alleged sexual misconduct 
with a minor more than 25 years ago.  And James Calhoun, pastor of 
Germantown's St. Boniface Church, was removed in light of an alleged 
incident with a young adult dating to the early 1980s.  All three 
priests have been cooperative and are undergoing therapy, a church 
spokesman said.  Bishop James Keleher promised "thorough" 
investigations, especially in light of the church's past failures to 
investigate and deal with sex scandals.  He said a telephone hot line, 
as the Chicago diocese established, would be set up to report possible 
abuses. 

A $4 million lawsuit alleges five Episcopal parties covered up a sex 
harassment case at the 2,000-member Falls Church in Northern Virginia.  
Former church assistant Bruce Newell, 60, is accused of sexually 
abusing the plaintiff, "Jane Doe," then 27, and five other women while 
he served there from 1987-1988.  Falls Church, the Diocese of Virginia, 
Parish Rector John Yates, and Diocesean Bishop Peter Lee are named in 
the suit, which says the church hushed the matter to protect Newell.  
Doe also says she was offered money to keep quiet.  A diocesan 
investigation is pending to determine whether Newell's credentials as a 
priest should be revoked.  The retired Navy admiral now heads 
fundraising at Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry, an Ambridge, Pa., 
seminary. 

Project Aries, the safe-sex counseling project for gay and bisexual 
men, will get no more federal funding.  The House voted 278-139 to 
discontinue its taxpayer subsidy.  Headquartered at the University of 
Washington in Seattle, Aries was given a four-year, $2 million grant in 
1990.  Director Roger Roffman told reporters savings would amount to 
only the unspent $339,000, and if 12 of the 360 participants were 
spared from AIDS and its treatment costs, the project would pay for 
itself.  Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Calif.) applauded pulling the plug on "a 
homosexual 800 number . . . that just talks dirty on the phone."  Rep. 
Sam Johnson (R-Texas) said he sponsored the cut for budgetary, not 
sexual, reasons. 

Making the rounds on Capitol Hill and other Washington corridors of 
power: The Gay Agenda.  The graphic 30minute video on homosexuality 
says that gays' and lesbians' "nationwide offensive" is geared "to 
force the acceptance and approval of their chosen lifestyle."  
Conservatives and active-duty military personnel are said to have 
forwarded the tape to Congress as evidence of why they oppose allowing 
gays in the military.  Marine Commandant Gen. Carl Mundy Jr. reportedly 
gave the Joint Chiefs of Staff copies of the video, and "the Marines 
are passing it out like popcorn," a former Pentagon official told the 
Los Angeles Times.  The video has been cited by Pat Robertson's 700 
Club, the Exodus (a homosexual restoration ministry) Standard, Ted 
Baehr's MovieGuide, and Marlin Maddoux' Point of View radio talkshow, 
and others, as a reputable, but vivid, background resource. 
...The tape opens with clips from last summer's gay pride parades in 
San Francisco, West Hollywood, and New York.  Transvestites and topless 
lesbians march, as do gay men clad only in G-strings.  Along the parade 
routes, same-sex couples stop to simulate sex acts.  There are scenes 
of actual masturbation and oral sex, as well as footage of riots 
following Gov. Pete Wilson's veto of a California homosexual-rights 
protection bill. 
...But not all of the video is explicit visual footage.  The Gay Agenda 
also includes an interview with homosexuality exit counselor Joseph 
Nicolosi, who directs the Thomas Aquinas Psychological Clinic of 
Encino, Calif.  Two ex-gays, both staff members at San Rafael-based 
Love In Action, discuss their former lifestyles.  John Paulk (a former 
female impersonator) says gay men typically engage in anonymous sex, 
often in public places, with hundreds of different partners over their 
lifetimes.  John Smid says he turned to homosexuality because of an 
unmet need for intimacy with male authority figures.  Medical Dr. 
Stanley Montieth describes in detail the health risks of specific 
homosexual acts. 
...The $13.95 video was produced by Antelope Valley Springs of Life 
Ministries, a charismatic church in Lancaster, Calif., whose multimedia 
resource center, The Report, distributes it.  Last October, 10,000 
copies were given out in Oregon and Colorado shopping centers before 
gay-rights initiatives went to voters. 
...In response, gay-rights advocates quickly produced Hate, Lies, and 
Videotape.  Their 10-minute video, released at a National Gay and 
Lesbian Task Force news conference, is designed to counteract the 
religious right's views on homosexuality.  The video mixes clips from 
the conservative video with comparisons to the Ku Klux Klan's attacks 
on blacks and Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda.  It also features an 
interview with a lesbian who says she was beaten by gay-bashers. 
...The Gay Agenda is "preaching to the converted," but could reach an 
audience that is "confused and misled," said Ann Northrup, executive 
director of the Gay and Lesbian Emergency Media Campaign.  She told The 
Washington Post their response was not designed to refute the "facts," 
statistics, and viewpoints presented in the other tape, since they were 
unfounded.  Hate, Lies and Videotape also has been forwarded to members 
of Congress and the Joint Chiefs. 

To curb the spread of AIDS, San Francisco could have "red-light 
districts" like those in Amsterdam, and prostitutes would work under 
strict health regulations, if city Supervisor Terence Hallinan's ideas 
become law.  The real troubles with prostitution, he says, are criminal 
influence and unsafe sex.  The San Francisco Chronicle reports Hallinan 
wants to sanction or control prostitution, and to form an exploratory 
task force within the next few months.  In addition to meeting with the 
health department, the supervisor plans public hearings to help form an 
emergency resolution ready for vote by December. Mayor Frank Jordan 
recently declared an AIDS emergency linked to intravenous drug abuse, 
and the Board of Supervisors approved a city-run needle exchange for 
addicts.  Although the practice technically violates state law, 
Sacramento issued no response to the proposition, months in the 
waiting. 

"Secular humanism is losing its humanity and is drifting into unabashed 
naturalism and raw paganism," author and theologian Carl F.H. Henry 
said at the Consultation on Theology and Civil Law, sponsored by the 
National Association of Evangelicals.  Sixteen scholars from various 
academic disciplines and establishments, parachurch groups, and 
denominational viewpoints met March 17-20 in Washington to examine the 
biblical principles and theological underpinnings of law. The 
Consultation was designed to offer guidelines to Christians who 
practice, make, enforce, or interpret law.  But the group said its 
conclusions had ramifications for all society in "its quest for 
liberty, justice, and social harmony."  The consultation members 
presented 11 historical, philosophical, biblical, and missiological 
papers.  They also issued a consensus statement, drafted by Henry, 
including 23 affirmations and denials in four broad areas: 
...On government: separation of church and state does not mean "the 
separation of the state from God"; all human government is instituted 
by God; and the church and civil government have separate roles and 
spheres of authority. 
...On civil law: proper law is based on transcendent, absolute, 
universal, moral principles, and subjective preferences cannot ground a 
just legal system; God's moral law, as revealed in human conscience and 
the Bible, is applicable to all peoples and nations in the modern 
world; social diversity and community tolerance help strengthen a 
nation, but forced political correctness and multi-culturalism do not; 
God, not the First Amendment, is the source of unalienable rights. 
...On citizenship: Christians must obey, honor, and respect civil 
authority -- unless it "forbids what God commands, and commands what 
God forbids"; the nation's founders were "predominantly Christian in 
belief and practice," a heritage that should be continued; free 
exercise of religion includes the right to proselytize, even for 
non-Christians; the Church is mandated to proclaim the Gospel, and not 
only where it is approved; Christians should seek civic objectives by 
political power, but not for the Church or to the detriment of the just 
interests of other citizens; and Christians are right to be concerned 
about infringements of human rights, including attacks on their own. 
...On the church: it is to influence the world by its example and 
prophetic witness, not by coercion or control of those outside its 
bounds; and Christ calls his church to demonstrate in a fragmented 
world the unity of the Spirit in the bond of love and peace, and human 
prejudice should not restrain this action. 

Look for RU-486 in the United States by May.  The controversial French 
abortion pill will undergo clinical evaluations in facilities that have 
offered to test the drug, manufacturer Roussel-Uclaf announced.  So 
far, no more than five medical groups have asked to conduct trial 
usage, news reports said.  The company estimates that between 10,000 to 
20,000 patients will be administered the pill, which proponents say is 
96% effective. 

When Operation Rescue's IMPACT training team leaves Melbourne, Fla., it 
moves to Minneapolis.  The second of this year's three 12-week training 
courses (NIRR 12/28/92) will be sponsored in part by Calvary Temple, a 
Pentecostal church in suburban St. Louis Park that will find volunteers 
to house and feed rescuers-in-the-making. 
...An abortion rights activist has been "born again," according to a 
recent Los Angeles Times story.  Kathi Hudson, a long-time feminist and 
abortion clinic defender, had been sent to follow Operation Rescue and 
its California director, Jeff White.  She was to listen and learn as 
much as possible about OR tactics so she could testify against the 
group in court. What she discovered instead was a new faith.  White had 
given her a Bible and asked her if she wanted to pray.  Since that 
time, Hudson has testified on behalf of Operation Rescue as a witness 
in court. 
...Fined $282,610: Operation Rescue, director Keith Tucci, and two 
other leaders.  U.S. District Judge Louis Oberdorfer levied the fines 
for violation of his injunction against blockading abortion clinics.  
OR maintained that the Supreme Court's decision disallowing use of 
federal law to prohibit rescuers protected them from the injunctions.  
But Oberdorfer said he can retain federal jurisdiction by reliance on 
the district's trespassing and public nuisance laws.  The National 
Organization of Women had sought the fines since OR protesters' January 
and April demonstrations at Hillcrest Women's Surgi-Center in 
Washington violated the injunctions, and constituted trespassing.  The 
judge said he wanted to fine OR now since it usually targets Washington 
clinics in the spring. 
...And OR has been ordered to pay $36,000 in legal fees that Planned 
Parenthood spent to secure an injunction against protesters at its 
Santa Barbara, Calif., clinic.  A unanimous appeals court said that 
Planned Parenthood "entirely prevailed" in its settlement of a lawsuit 
against the pro-life group.  OR agreed in the settlement to stop 
photographing clinic patients and blocking cars in the parking lot, but 
refused to admit wrongdoing. 

Abortion tourism advertisements are appearing now that Poland's law 
restricting the practice has been enacted. Travel agencies already have 
offered trips to Russia and the Netherlands.  One trip to Amsterdam, 
with more than 30 women registered, includes travel, an abortion, and 
medical counseling for $850-$950, although the prices could rise as 
demand climbs.  Polish monthly salaries average $300-$400.  For 37 
years, Poles commonly used the practice for birth control, with the 
1992 official abortion count in Poland at 40,000.  Even more private 
abortions went unreported, news sources said.  The new law (NIRR 2/22) 
allows abortion only in cases of maternal endangerment, rape, incest, 
and severe fetal deformity, but does not detail whether abortions 
performed in other countries would be punished.  Among the effects of 
the new law abortion supporters predict: self-mutilations, suicides, 
abandoned babies, black-market underground movements, self-proclaimed 
physicians, and abortion-related deaths. 
...Poland's abortion rate has paralleled Western countries more than 
other former Eastern Bloc lands.  The country averages 20 legal 
abortions per 100 live births, similar to France (25), Italy (40), and 
the United States (40), according to population expert Louis Roussel.  
Russia averages 132, Bulgaria 137, and Romania 317. 
...Newly formed feminist and abortion rights groups continue to urge a 
referendum, which more than 1.3 million people supported before the 
law's passage.  Roman Catholic and right-to-life officials concede that 
a vote would likely overturn the law, since Poles would opt for a 
convenient rather than moral solution. 

Collegians Activated to Liberate Life insists it had the school's 
permission to "Help Restore Notre Dame to Its Catholic Heritage," as 
the ad for the conference said.  The Agape In Action Alternative Spring 
Break Project, to have been held on campus, was planned as "the largest 
gathering of pro-life collegians ever."  Participants would engage in a 
24-hour prayer rally, sidewalk counseling, lectures by leading abortion 
opponents, and anti-abortion marches and rallies.  Organizers say they 
had the blessing of the Catholic university, until the advertisement 
ran in the Wanderer. 
...Notre Dame University disagrees, but positions differ from 
spokesperson to spokesperson.  Some insist it was never invited to 
participate formally, and school officials were first made aware of the 
gathering by advertisements in various Catholic publications.  Others 
say the school, as a rule, does not accept unsolicited conferences.  
Still others say they denied CALL's permission request because of 
inability to house the expected number of participants, 500, for two 
weeks.  One spokeswoman said the university was suspicious that CALL 
had a hidden agenda that the school's particiation might unwittingly 
promote. 
...Peter Heers, director of the interdenominational (but largely 
Catholic) Wisconsin-based group, said CALL wanted to allow the 
university to stand with it in a proud Catholic and pro-life statement. 
 He said Notre Dame upheld a double standard by axing the pro-life 
conference, but welcoming pro-choice politicians (including Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, Jesse Jackson, N.Y. Gov. Mario Cuomo, and Bill 
Clinton) to campus.  In the past, CALL has criticized Notre Dame for 
not taking a firm anti-abortion stand.  School spokesmen say the school 
has always been pro-life. 
...CALL held the conference off-campus, but about 100 students staged a 
temporary sit-in, requesting to meet with the school's president.  
Since he was not there, they knelt in prayer in the university's 
administration building. 

A pro-life message has been part of the sex education program in 
northern Idaho's Prairie School District for more than five years.  But 
science teacher Douglas Clark is questioning the curriculum, which has 
no pro-choice view.  He says the community should consider endorsing a 
"more balanced format."  State Right to Life board member Kerry 
Uhlenkott, who lectures at the schools, told NIRR that a majority of 
parents favor the curriculum, and children are confronted by an 
opposing viewpoint "all day long on TV and in the newspapers."  
Superintendent Wesley Rash denies any bias, and says the parents like 
the eighth-grade sex-ed format. 
...Shreveport, La., public schools cannot use a national sex education 
curriculum that stresses abstinence.  State District Judge Frank 
Thaxton ruled that the courses, "Facing Reality" and "Sex Respect," 
illegally promote religion, as was alleged by Planned Parenthood, which 
brought the suit.  Allison Jones, lawyer for the plaintiff, said the 
ruling would likely be used in other locations with less conservative 
sex education laws.  "If they violate Louisiana state law," she told 
The Associated Press, "they probably violate every other state law." 

Wawasee High School of Syracuse, Ind., will let the senior class decide 
whether it wants a graduation prayer. Despite complaints by a Jewish 
resident of unconstitutionality, the school board agreed that if 
students wanted to sponsor a prayer, school officials would allow one.  
The school would not, however, sponsor or endorse any religious 
practices at commencement.  United Press International reported that 
any graduation prayer would be offered by a student, and a disclaimer 
in the program will help clarify any question of a breach of First 
Amendment rights.  Elwood High School may take the same approach.  An 
informal survey of seniors found only a few opposed to prayer at 
graduation. 

Crosses atop Mount Helix and Mount Soledad in San Diego violate 
California's constitutional "no preference" clause regarding religion, 
the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled.  The crosses were erected 
privately early in the 1900s on land that later became public parks.  
Although the crosses were historical, their religious significance and 
visibility were paramount, the court said.  The judges remanded the 
case to decide whether the crosses should be removed.  In any case, 
they may have to come off the city insignia of La Mesa.  The court 
ruled that the larger-than-scale depiction of the Mount Helix cross on 
the city seal gave the appearance of religious preference. 

Amish and Mennonite churches in Ohio could opt out of paying worker 
compensation fees under a new bill similar to one in Pennsylvania.  
Republican Rep. Mark White said the 2,500 church members historically 
"take care of their own" with a monthly church fund for medical and 
family expenses.  Each congregant sets aside a day's pay for the fund.  
White said the bill would parallel an Internal Revenue Service 
exclusion from self-employment tax for those whose conscience disagrees 
with such insurance.  News sources said some officials have questioned 
the band-wagon effect the bill could have, but White said the 
Pennsylvania law had experienced a "very, very minor" administrative 
impact. 

Amendments to the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 may be 
on the same fast-track for passage as the Religious Freedom Restoration 
Act.  A revised AIRFA would reverse the effects of two Supreme Court 
decisions said to have weakened 2 million Native Americans' religious 
rights.  The rulings outlawed the sacramental use of peyote, and 
declared that Indian ritual sites (many on U.S. Forest Service lands in 
the Western United States) could not be protected from federal or state 
government appropriation.  The bill would also allow for collection of 
eagle feathers for use in ceremonies, and strengthen prisoners' 
religious rights.  Chief sponsor Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), who 
heads the subcommittee on Indian Affairs, conducted six national 
hearings to hear concerns of Native Americans before introducing the 
bill.  AIRFA has the support of more than 20 religious, environmental, 
and human rights groups. 

The kidnappings continue in the southern Philippines with the abduction 
of a Spanish priest, Bernardo Blanco. Armed men seized the 65-year-old 
Claretian priest while he was traveling back to his parish March 18.  
Roman Catholic officials in Zamboanga are negotiating for Blanco's 
release, although they refuse to pay the ransom, the amount of which 
has not been disclosed.  Military officials refused to stop military 
operations, as kidnappers requested, and have begun a search for the 
former Moro National Liberation Front Muslim separatists, also 
responsible for previous abductions (NIRR 2/22; 1/11). 

Four Western Christians have been detained by Egyptian authorities 
after religious discussions with Muslims.  Three Americans -- Robert 
Cunningham, Richard Dugan, Brian Eckheart -- and New Zealander Thomas 
Martin were arrested by state security police more than a month ago 
from their homes in Cairo.  Jailed with them was Abdel-Hamid Adel-Nefa 
(or Adel-Masah), an Egyptian language instructor said to be a Muslim. 
...The men are being held at Tora Prison on suspicion of "humiliating 
and debasing Islam" and of "fomenting sectarian sedition," according to 
news services and Robert Douglas, executive director for the Zwemer 
Institute of Muslim Studies and a personal friend of the Eckhearts.  
News Network International cites unnamed police sources as saying the 
men were forming "a secret organization" and Christian "missionary" 
group.  Christian literature and computer files, including translations 
of the gospels of Luke and John, were confiscated by police at the time 
of arrest, wives of the men said.  Eckheart was arrested at 2 a.m. on 
Feb. 22, and police aimed guns at Martin's children.  Cunningham's 
phone lines were cut, and all of their homes were ransacked, the men 
said.  They also said they were deprived of sleep for 40 hours upon 
detention, and were forced to squat in corners for 10 hours at a time.  
Martin and Adel-Nefa were blindfolded for some time, and all were 
threatened with beatings and told not to speak unless questioned. 
...The four reportedly refer to themselves as "Muslims who follow 
Christ," and Douglas says they were careful to fit in with Egyptian 
society.  NNI reported that the men and their wives follow Islamic 
dress codes and practice Muslim dietary customs.  The men were said to 
have observed Ramadan in prison. 
...The Americans are business associates of Industrial Systems and 
Components, a Warrenton, Va., export management firm.  Egyptian 
Interior Ministry officials confirmed to ISC's Randy Hoffman in Cairo 
that the five were detained for interrogation, but no charges had been 
filed.  Douglas said representatives of the three governments involved 
are working to sort out the problems.  A U.S. embassy employee found 
the prisoners in good condition when she visited them on Feb. 25; the 
westerners are said to have better conditions now than first after 
their arrest, but Adel-Nefa has since been moved to a psychiatric 
prison, where he is "unnecessarily" strapped to a bed, his attorney 
told NNI.  A hearing early in March was remanded for another 45 days, 
reportedly so the prosecution could gather information.  Zwemer will 
bypass its normal letter-writing strategy and requests prayer for the 
arrested men, "since the church in Egypt is certainly not immune from 
this harassment," Douglas said. 

Short-term missions shifted into high gear in the 1980s.  From 1979 to 
1989, the number of laity involved, through local churches and missions 
agencies, rose from an estimated 22,000 to 120,000, according to a 
study by MARC-World Vision and Discover the World reported in World 
Pulse.  Local churches are increasingly using short-term missions teams 
as a way to disciple members and build missions vision, said Rich 
Hurst, a member of the pastoral staff at Crystal Cathedral, in Garden 
Grove, Calif.  He said that the reality of missions work "shocked" 
people out of their apathy.  Hurst and his wife, Kim, the church's 
missions director, said about 80% to 90% of the people who go on the 
teams come back different, trained and ready for leadership positions 
in their churches.  Chris Eaton, founder of St. Petersburg, Fla.-based 
Bridge Builders, which assists local churches in developing short-term 
mission teams, said "People are beginning to realize it's not just the 
youth who need their values shaken up, but the adults as well." 
...Latin America Mission representative Chip Anderson noted several 
trends in short-term missions work: churches are just as interested in 
short-term missions teams as they are having full-time missionaries 
speak or holding missions conferences; about 61% of short-termers 
minister in Latin America; many say their main motivation is to help 
the missionary in the field; short-termers would rather evangelize than 
work on field construction projects; and churches are most likely to 
send teams where they personally know and trust the missionaries. 

The Christian and Missionary Alliance is jumping -- somewhat cautiously 
-- on the Russian ministry bandwagon. The denomination has announced 
plans for a carefully researched, cooperative international effort to 
plant 500 churches with 75,000 members on Russian soil within the next 
decade.  CMA spokesman Gordon McAllister told NIRR the short-term goals 
are to place 75 international missionaries in strategic areas within 
the next few years.  Immediately, 12 missionaries and two probe teams 
will ascertain where in southwest Russia the need is greatest and 
Western missionary presence is thinnest.  McAllister said the efforts 
will probably focus on cities other than Moscow and Kiev. 
...The ministry workers would come not only from U.S. and Canadian CMA 
churches, but also from Alliance World Fellowship congregations in the 
Philippines, Korea, and other countries.  The CMA will do more than 
blitz the area with literature and video; instead, the missionaries 
will be trained to engage in long-term, multi-faceted presentations of 
the gospel that are consistent with Russian culture.  As McAllister 
says, "When we go to Russia, we go to stay." 
...The first probe team is back safely, even though CMA lost almost all 
communication with them during the 10-day trip.  The seven-member team 
covered the area near the Black Sea, where there are few evangelical 
churches and virtually no foreign missions work in the area about the 
size of Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium combined.  Key to the 
area is the city that was Stalingrad.  Volgograd, which stretches for 
90 kilometers along the Volga River, and its twin city, Volzck, have 
more than 1.5 million inhabitants, but fewer than 0.02% are evangelical 
Christians.  The ratio of churches to people is 1: 250,000.  Christians 
in Volgograd pled for help with evangelization.  Two other major 
cities, Rostov na Donu and Krasnodar, each total over 1 million, with 
only 11 evangelical churches and no missionary input. 
...Signs of cooperation are mixed.  A Russian Orthodox representative 
for the archbishop offered to work with the CMA and AWF to establish 
better relief efforts for the thousands of refugees that flood the area 
because of violence in their Commonwealth republics.  An independent 
Baptist pastor in Krasnodar offered to help the missionaries train 
indigenous believers to assume the work.  But because of Russia's 
tenuous political position, some churches fear that the country will 
revert to its less democratic ways, and begin again to persecute the 
church.  Joseph Kennedy, CMA's vice president of overseas ministry, 
said Russian believers have heard unfulfilled Western promises before, 
and that missionaries would have to "work at winning their confidence." 
 But a Volzck pastor, whose church ministers to drug addicts, 
alcoholics, and other needy groups, urged the CMA to begin aggressive 
evangelism now. 
..."If God in His grace keeps the doors to Russia open, there is no 
doubt we can see remarkable results," Kennedy says. "There is a great 
hunger for God."  The second probe group leaves for Russia mid-April.  
The first resident missionaries, veterans of cross-cultural ministry, 
will arrive in Russia this summer. 

The reports are back from Billy Graham's ProChrist '93 and Mission 
Europe crusades broadcast from Germany. Organizers estimate that about 
1 million attended in the German-speaking venues, with 10,500 packing 
the 7,000-seat Essen Grugahalle each night to see Graham in person.  
Another 7.2 million heard the message by satellite at other 
international locations, including stadiums, shopping centers, town 
halls, and a small airport.  Altogether nearly 250,000, many of them 
young people, made commitments to Christ.  Of the large numbers of 
those hearing the gospel message in their own language and responding, 
one German pastor said, "Martin Luther would be thrilled."  Most 
European venues recorded attendance at about 2,000, ranging from four 
in a small southern French village to more than 10,000 in halls in 
Romania and the Commonwealth of Independent States.  Overall, Missions 
Europe officials said, responses for Christ averaged 8% of those 
attending -- three times as many as in an average U.S. crusade. 
...Graham's visit was given good press in Germany.  A Stuttgart paper 
hailed "the biggest evangelization in church history" as "a 
compassionate crusade against godlessness."  Bild Zeitung, Germany's 
largest-circulation newspaper, compared Graham's satellite evangelism 
to Jesus' speaking from a boat so more people could hear him.  
ProChrist organizers credited extensive media coverage for drawing more 
than one-third of all who attended.  Media representatives at the Essen 
meetings alone numbered in the hundreds, with more at regional 
locations.  A well-known Polish journalist covering the meetings was 
said to have accepted Christ as a result of his assignment. 
..."What occurs here . . . can literally affect the history of the 
world as we reach the end of this tumultuous 20th century," Graham 
said.  He spoke on the love of God in the face of suffering.  
Terrorism, war, disease, hate, poverty, and racism should not be blamed 
on God, he preached, since humanity has wandered from Him and His laws. 
 "We need reconciliation with God before we can be reconciled with each 
other," he said, referring to specific problems of the former 
Yugoslavia.  Planners said meetings in Serbia and Bosnia were well 
attended, and that one former Yugoslav republic broadcast the crusades 
on national television, with requests from the audience to rerun the 
programs.  Graham said he hoped the meetings would bring the people a 
"sense of reconciliation and peace." 
...Before the Essen crusades began, Graham met with Pope John Paul II 
at the Vatican to discuss the status of Christianity worldwide.  The 
pope, who expressed interest in the meetings, was especially concerned 
about the former U.S.S.R.  Across the Commonwealth of Independent 
States, crusade planners noted a tremendous spiritual hunger and "great 
receptivity to Mission World," according to Bill Jefferson, the 
resident director of the Moscow outreach.  In the Russian capital, 
4,500 overflowed a sports complex, and 25% of the crowd made 
professions of faith.  In the Russian Pacific port of Vladivostok, 
1,800 attended.  Of the 4,000 attending in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan, 300 
responded.  And in Baku, Azerbaijan, Mission World reported an overflow 
crowd of 700, even under threat of war. 
...Sports events met their match with Graham's crusades, the largest 
technological project since the 1992 Barcelona Olympic games.  One 
Czech girl had prayed that her mother, stepfather, and 14-year-old 
sister would attend the crusade, but they had tickets to a sports 
match.  When the game was cancelled, they went to the meeting and gave 
their lives to Christ. German prisoners chose the crusade over soccer 
as their viewing choice.  And in Sofia, Bulgaria, the sound went bad, 
forcing organizers to change satellites.  The Palace of Culture, which 
was hosting local meetings, volunteered its system, which also services 
restaurants and bars.  Instead of sports, the patrons watched Graham. 
...There were other professions from those who attended 
"coincidentally": Two Bulgarian police officers came in from the rain 
and responded to the last 10 minutes of the crusade.  When bad weather 
grounded a plane scheduled to deliver a movie to an Icelandic cinema, a 
Baptist church was able to rent the theatre another night, allowing 120 
to attend. An Irish ambulance driver assigned to attend the meetings in 
case of emergencies accepted Christ. 
...Previous Mission World outreaches from London to Africa in 1989, 
Hong Kong across Asia in 1990, and Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Latin 
America and the Caribbean in 1991 have extended Graham's ministry to 
141 countries and more than 70 million people through the use of 
satellite and video technology.  In his 50 years in ministry, Graham 
has presented the gospel to more than 180 million people worldwide. 

Publishers Weekly, the book trade's foremost journal, has recognized 
the importance of religious books with their own department and editor. 
 Industry veteran Phyllis Tickle was appointed as PW's full-time 
religion editor in December.  She said she hopes to "de-ghettoize" the 
coverage of religious book publishing, and to expose the field as an 
"active segment of the industry" rather than a special-interest niche.  
She told Religious News Service that the magazine ran its story on 
former vice president Dan Quayle's memoir deal as a news story, not an 
isolated religious-publishing article.  This, she said, was evidence of 
PW's new commitment to mainstream religion into general news pages. 
...Sales of religious-title books have risen each of the last five 
years, the American Booksellers Association reports. From 1986 to 1991, 
sales rose from $573 million to $839 million.  By 1995, publishers 
predict, religious book sales will top $1 billion.  Industry experts 
say religious publishers are successfully tapping into "secular" 
markets, often enlarging the religion sections within bookstores.  
General publishers, too, are more willing to print books with religious 
themes.

Vol. 7, No. 7                                                           
             March 22, 1993 

The 1980s were "the decade of the Protestant Reformation in Latin 
America," as evangelical churches grew from memberships of 18.6 million 
to 59.4 million, a 220% growth rate.  A century ago, the area had no 
Protestant churches. Historians say Latin American Catholics' 
defections to Protestant churches are quantitatively greater in the 
last 10 years than during the 16th century Reformation in central 
Europe. 
...As a result, the Roman Catholic Church is committed to preach the 
gospel more effectively in Brazil.  Bishops hope the "New 
Evangelization" strategy will reverse a serious decline in church 
membership in the region, according to News Network International.  
Statistics indicate the number of Roman Catholics is steadily 
shrinking.  Membership grew by 30 million in the past decade, but the 
general population increased by almost 80 million.  Since church growth 
has not equaled population growth, even though the church inducts 
members automatically through infant baptism, the Catholics have 
suffered a net decline of allegiance, from 89% to 78% of all 
Brazilians. 
...Relations between Catholic and Protestant leaders are strained badly 
in Brazil.  The largest Catholic nation in the world, with a population 
of 180 million, Brazil has seen rapid Protestant growth, especially 
among conservative Pentecostal groups.  Non-Catholic churches have seen 
membership swell to 35 million, and more than half of all Latin 
American Protestants are Brazilian, NNI reported. 
...Govenador Valadares was the site of evangelist Sammy Tippit's first 
Brazilian crusade earlier this month.  The outreach effort was 
sponsored by the city's 17 Baptist churches and several other 
evangelical congregations.  Baptist pastor Sebastian Arsenio, general 
chairman of the crusade, said he expected a low turnout, since there 
are only 2,000 Baptists in the overwhelmingly Catholic city.  
Pentecostals had warned him that people would be hesitant to go to a 
preaching-only service, and that they expected to see healings.  But 
8,500 attended the first evening and 15,000 the second night.  The 
17,000-seat stadium was completely filled the final night.  Arsenio 
said that because of the crusade 4,850 made first-time decisions for 
Christ.  A local affiliate of the national television syndicate Globo 
covered the crusade, and aired interviews with Tippit on the prime-time 
news and a 30-minute talk-show.  Tippit has held "Prayer and Spiritual 
Awakening" conferences across Brazil, and plans citywide crusades in 
Belem and San Luis later this year. 

Next month Rock Mirdita will become the Archbishop of Tirana, 
consecrated by Pope John Paul II in the Albanian capital.  His 
installment will help rebuild the Catholic church in the country, 
devoid of religious faith since 1967, when the country was declared 
atheist.  Mirdita, a parish priest at Our Lady of Good Counsel in the 
Bronx, once knocked on doors in Albanian-American neighborhoods to find 
immigrants for his church.  He told the New York Times he will now seek 
a rarer type of refugee: ones who remained in Albania, secretly 
practicing their Catholic faith through almost 50 years of communist 
rule.  Mirdita, an ethnic Albanian, was born in Ulqin, in southern 
Yugoslavia.  Schooled in his country of birth, he served for seven 
years as a priest in the Kosovo region, which is inhabited largely by 
ethnic Albanians.  He came to the United States in 1973.  Mirdita has 
visited Albania three times in the past two years, and will make a 
fourth trip to find housing.  "Never has Albania been so open to God as 
it is now," he said. 

Eritrea is no longer just a war-torn northern province of 
famine-plagued Ethiopia, according to Mesghina Medhin, an exile who 
directs international students at Biola University.  He revisited his 
homeland in 1991 and 1992, and said it is a nation "reborn," Pulse 
newsletter reported.  Eritrea's 3.5 million people, whether Muslim or 
Christian, have shared a common heritage, if not language or 
nationality.  The United Nations will officially recognize the country 
in April. 
...The country has also been spiritually revitalized.  Recently the 
Bible was translated into Tigrigna, which, along with Arabic, is a main 
language of Eritrea.  Since then, thousands of business people and 
government officials have flowed into the Coptic churches.  Morning 
prayers are broadcast at 6 o'clock, Muslim-style, followed by more 
contemporary afternoon services, which are packed with young and old.  
And all of the evangelical churches have full daily services, and 
nightly prayer meetings.  Although Marxism drove western missionaries 
from the country in the 1970s, Orthodox and evangelical churches 
survived surprisingly well.  And Eritrea has escaped much of the 
growing influence of Islamic fundamentalism prevalent in other parts of 
Northern Africa, the newsletter said. .  . . Eritrea has no mission 
organizations, but Eritrean churches are cooperating with the 
government in relief and development work, including feeding programs, 
education, orphanages, and clinics.  "Eritrea is very strategic to 
reach the entire Arab world" with the gospel, Medhin said. Haitian 
Catholics say the Vatican shouldn't work with the government that 
ousted its elected president.  Papal Nuncio Lorenzo Baldisseri is the 
only diplomat whose state recognizes the leaders of the coup that 
overthrew Jean-Bertrand Aristide.  The church has long shown its 
disapproval of Aristide, a former priest who ministered to the poor of 
Port-auPrince.  Aristide, who favors empowering the poor through 
liberation theology, was accused of trying to provoke class warfare in 
the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.  As a priest, and in his 
seven months in office, Aristide often criticized Vatican and Haitian 
church leaders for ignoring the needs of the impoverished, including 
violations of their human rights.  The country's Catholics say 
Baldisseri does not denounce government atrocities reported by the 
United Nations and other human rights activist groups.  A 
letter-writing campaign to recall the nuncio is under way.  The church 
has long had ties to Haiti's conservative and powerful elite, 
especially the Duvalier governments. 
...Daniel Roussierre, a French priest in Gonaives, Haiti, is known as 
"the man who keeps the books."  Human rights activists rely on "Pere 
Daniel" and scores of other priests and nuns who risk their safety to 
keep documentation of abuses, especially since Aristide was ousted.  
His work details, sometimes with photographs, mass shootings, tortures, 
land thefts from and massive taxes on peasants, attacks against 
churches and their workers, rapes, and other atrocities.  Most of the 
attacks come from the military-run police or other government leaders 
and appointees.  Since the United Nations and the Organization of 
American States have joined to monitor human rights violations in 
Haiti, Roussierre told Reuters he can more openly show his books, but 
he holds no illusions that his safety is assured. 

Continuing negotiations for the release of three missionaries kidnapped 
in Panama are "very delicate," says Brian Copland, a spokesman for New 
Tribes Mission.  He would not comment on rumors that the Bible teachers 
had been killed. Officials for the mission and the U.S. government have 
not been able to confirm reports aired on a Panamanian radio station 
(and rebroadcast by the Mexican news agency Notimex) that three bodies 
had been found.   The government of Panama, which ended its search late 
last month, said the reports were not true.  Juan Chevalier, justice 
and interior minister, said the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, 
whom he believes are the kidnappers, took the missionaries' short-wave 
radios, and used them to communicate a $5 million ransom demand to New 
Tribes leaders in Chame, about 50 miles from Panama City.  He also said 
the captives spoke with missions officials by radio.  Copland confirmed 
for reporters that New Tribes is still "in contact with the 
kidnappers," whom the mission identified as members of the Torrijist 
Patriotic Vanguard, or VPT20, a Panamanian guerrilla group that claimed 
the men were spies. 

Police officers stormed a church in Chirang Dzonghkag, Bhutan, last 
month and threatened to destroy the new building if the Sunday service 
was not stopped.  Gospel for Asia, of Carrollton, Texas, reported that 
police rounded up the men and took them to the station, where many had 
their Bibles and hymnbooks confiscated.  After two hours of 
interrogation, the Christians were released, but with orders to return 
in two days.  The men were questioned all day Tuesday, and eventually 
were sent home with instructions to talk with their families about 
renouncing their faith. 
...Most of Bhutan's 1.3 million inhabitants are Buddhist, but Hindus 
are legally recognized as well.  Christian proselytizing is illegal, 
although private practices of faith are allowed.  The National Assembly 
of the tiny separatist country north of India may ban Christianity.  
City government officials say the religion, especially its rapid spread 
in the south, is becoming a problem.  If that happens, the missions 
group indicates, persecution is likely to increase. 
...More than 50 tribal people, many of them illiterate tea laborers 
near the Indian border, have converted.  Though native missionaries, 
some sponsored by Gospel for Asia, live in danger for preaching, they 
report a hunger for spiritual truth.  At the building dedication for a 
new church, several Hindu villagers who came to watch accepted Christ. 

South Korea's new civilian president, Young Sam Kim, (NIRR 12/28/92) is 
starting fresh.  He granted amnesty to almost 42,000 people "to promote 
national reconciliation by clearing 30 years of shadows over our 
society."  More than 5,800 had been punished for political crimes, 
including dozens of student activists, and six Communist spies 
imprisoned since the end of the Korean War.  Some prisoners had already 
been paroled or released on suspended sentences, but the amnesty 
restored their civil rights. 
...Included on the jail release list was Ik-kwan Moon, 73.  Moon is a 
Presbyterian pastor, who, like Kim, led dissidents.  Moon was jailed in 
1989 for seven years for visiting North Korea without government 
permission, a violation of internal security laws.   North Korea had 
called for Moon's release as a condition for improving ties between the 
two countries.  Kim is said to favor reunification discussions.  Moon's 
assistant, In Ho Yu, was also freed. 
...But Kim also is being forced to clean house, dismissing three new 
cabinet ministers and the mayor of Seoul.  Leaks of potentially 
scandalous information and accusations of illegalities and elitism are 
said to be coming from anti-reformists, determined to smear Kim's 
political image and weaken his influence, news reports said. 

Tens of thousands flocked to Agoo, on the northern Philippines seaside, 
to witness an appearance of the Virgin Mary.  Police estimated more 
than 100,000 crowded an open field known as Apparition Hill, and as 
many as 1.5 million attempted to reach the site, causing traffic jams 
that reached almost to Manila.  The event was predicted by a 
12-year-old boy, Judiel Nieva, who claimed that since 1989 the Virgin 
has been appearing in Agoo on the first Saturday of each month, as well 
as on religious feast days.  Nieva is said to own a Marian statue that 
bleeds.  Comparatively few claimed to have seen Mary, and the image 
lasted only a few seconds.  She was described as wearing a white veil 
and a white robe with a dark sash.  She also was described as floating 
in a cloud.  Several in the crowd fainted, presumably from the heat and 
sunstroke.  The church hierarchy had no official comment, but planned 
to hold a mass on the site. 

God is using Hong Kong's impending return to Chinese control to open 
hearts to the gospel, says Southern Baptist evangelist Wade Armstrong.  
The retired SBC pastor taught at the Hong Kong Theological Seminary in 
the 1989-1990 term, and, with his wife, Shirley, conducts periodic 
evangelistic missions there.  During a recent three-month campaign, he 
found many residents are suspicious of communist pledges of 
non-interference in Hong Kong's religious and business affairs come 
1997.  Their disbelief is founded in the harsh response to 
anti-government protests in 1989.  Though China historically is a 
Buddhist nation, Armstrong says the communist closing of all churches 
from 1949-1976 took its toll: 90% of Hong Kong residents have no 
specific faith.  "There's a real spiritual vacuum.  But young adults 
make up most of the churches in the city."  In his last evangelistic 
trip, more than 400 accepted Christ as savior.  "I think the church of 
tomorrow has a great future there, Armstrong said." 
...The Hong Kong Baptist Convention apparently agrees.  They granted 
approval for their seminary to build a new campus.  They are trading 
the current school site to a local property development company.  In 
return, the seminary will receive a new campus built to its 
specifications, and a development fund worth more than $14 million.  
Officials expect to move in the fall of 1994, according to the Baptist 
Press foreign bureau. 

In his first mission to united Germany, Billy Graham reached all of 
Europe.  ProChrist '93, held March 17-21, was the evangelist's 
widest-reaching crusade ever, blanketing 57 countries and territories 
from Iceland to the Eastern Bloc to the Commonwealth of Independent 
States, from the Arctic to Austria to Albania, reaching more than 1,000 
locations. 
...ProChrist '93 was a cooperative effort with German Christians 
representing more than 1,200 churches.  Graham was invited to the area 
by German leaders who cited a new unity and vision for "profound moral 
and spiritual renewal throughout Europe."  Graham garnered official 
support from the Evangelical Alliance of Germany, the Protestant Church 
of Germany (EKD), and the Roman Catholic Church.  In a weeklong 
planning tour last November, he met with high-ranking government and 
church officials.  Christians were well prepared for the crusade, 
having participated in extensive counseling and follow-up training 
sessions, as well as sponsoring all-night prayer vigils, door-to-door 
visitation, pre-mission concerts, and television programming. 
...The European outreach was Graham's largest to date, but his emphasis 
remained on "relational evangelism." For that reason, organizers chose 
Essen, population 600,000, in the industrial Ruhr valley.  Graham spoke 
from the Grugahalle, or Great Hall, which seats only 7,000.  The 
smaller location was seen as more intimate and personal, facilitating 
local church and individual witness efforts.  Instead of drawing crowds 
to Germany, the crusade took "Essen to them," as Mission World Director 
Bob Williams said. 
..."So much of Germany is built around your faith and history, both 
Catholic and Protestant," Graham said, indicating that his purpose for 
the crusade was to proclaim an age-old message, once familiar to the 
land.  But "the cross of Christ, the resurrection, and the need for 
repentance and faith" have a modern relevance, Graham said.  "When the 
Berlin Wall went down, millions of people thought their problems were 
over," Graham said.  But since unification, Germany has seen 
immigration problems, growing ethnic intolerance, and a near 20% 
unemployment rate.  As a microcosm of Europe, Germany can serve as an 
example to the world of how to cope with turmoil, the evangelist said.  
Despite political and financial changes, the people still have an 
emptiness and lack of fulfillment.  European church leaders put 
differences aside to show that the answer to internal peace is in Jesus 
Christ and getting "back to the Bible." 
...Before Graham's sermon, satellite viewers watched one of seven 
cultural-specific editions of the crusade program.  Each featured 
relevant testimonies, regional or ethnic music, and appearances by 
local celebrities or officials. Then the satellite crusade covered the 
continent.  Organizers estimated that each night about 2 million people 
heard the gospel in their native tongues.  Translators simultaneously 
converted Graham's sermons into 42 languages.  And more than 2,000 
areas will view taped video missions for four days during the crusade's 
two-month followup. 

England's 300-year-old Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge 
is reeling under scandals involving sex, money, and the Anglican 
church.  Charity Commissioners are investigating the missionary society 
because of allegations that former Managing Director Patrick Gilbert 
misappropriated organizational funds on extravagant expenditures. 
...But homosexuality has proved to be a bigger problem for the SPCK.  
The Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, personally intervened to 
prevent the SPCK's publishing house from printing a gay prayerbook, 
according to Alpha, a British Christian magazine.  And the former 
chairman of the Society's executive committee, Derek Pattinson, is the 
subject of an expose by journalist Andrew Brown in The Independent.  In 
1990, Pattinson, also secretary-general of the Church of England 
General synod for 18 years, took Barnaby Miln, a homosexual justice of 
the peace, on a trip to South Africa.  Gilbert approved of SPCK payment 
for their shared room, although Pattinson says he paid for Miln's share 
of their lodging costs. 
...Allegations of their homosexuality dated to 1987, when Pattinson was 
on the platform at a General Synod debate. Miln, then a lay-member, 
announced he was a homosexual.  The synod motioned to condemn 
"homosexual genital activity." Miln said that Graham Leonard, then the 
Anglo-Catholic bishop of London, was present at the meeting. 
...Retiring from the synod in 1990, Pattinson was knighted, and began 
studying for the priesthood.  During his training, he lived with Miln 
in an apartment owned by the Diocese of London.  Miln said Leonard 
bypassed the normal procedure for Pattinson's ordination, and avoided 
the church Advisory Council on Ministry investigation of candidate 
suitability.  At the deaconing service, a journalist for the Daily Mail 
was told to leave after he accused Pattinson of being a homosexual.  
Leonard, despite protests, continued with the ceremony, telling the 
organist to play at full volume. 
...Pattinson has been ordered by the new bishop of London to take 
medical leave.  Gilbert resigned abruptly last year, and now faces 
other charges of indecent assault.  Leonard retired in 1991, and has 
said he will leave the Anglican church over its decision to ordain 
women.  Miln was involved in a suspicious lorry accident last year in 
which his homosexual lover and chauffeur, David O'Reilly, was killed 
while trying to buy cocaine. 
...The SPCK has a new managing director, Paul Chandler.  Having closely 
examined and strengthened the financial controls of the society, he 
said that none of the SPCK's travel budget was funded by private 
contributions. 

Peter Ball, the Church of England's Bishop of Gloucester, resigned 
after a formal caution for gross sexual indecency. Gloucestershire 
police said a 17-year-old novice monk raised allegations against Ball, 
61, in December.  Based on the bishop's "regret, with great penitence 
and sorrow," as his statement read, the Crown Prosecution Service 
allowed a police caution rather than a trial.  Ball, bishop for less 
than a year, said 12 weeks of anxiety had affected his health. His is 
the first Anglican bishop's resignation related to sex scandals in more 
than 20 years.  "As for the future," Ball said, "I'm sure there are 
other ways in which I can serve God." 

The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Santa Fe, N.M., seemingly has accepted 
allegations he had sex with three women in the late 1970s to early 
1980s.  Robert Sanchez, archbishop since 1974 and the first U.S. 
Hispanic so highly placed, acknowledged to having had unspecified 
relationships with the women, and said he had hurt them deeply.  
Sanchez issued a statement from an out-of-state retreat asking public 
forgiveness from everybody he had caused pain.  He indicated he had 
asked God's forgiveness as well.  The women, interviewed for an 
upcoming story on CBS' 60 Minutes, were in their teens when the 
relations, reportedly consensual, took place.  Ron Wolf, the 
archdiocese chancellor, said two other women had raised similar 
complaints against Sanchez, and he assumed them to be true.  The 
Albuquerque Journal, which first broke the story, reported that in 1991 
the archdiocese paid a woman a settlement fee for a 1972-1973 
relationship with Sanchez.  The newspaper said the women came forward 
out of anger over Sanchez' statement that he could not recall any 
parental complaints of child sexual abuse by priests in New Mexico.  
The Vatican has not yet responded to Sanchez' breach of celibacy, but 
the archbishop said he is willing to do what is best for the church. 

New Jersey courts have a chance to set a price on the human soul.  Four 
Roman Catholic families are suing the church for loss of faith.  Three 
say the church did nothing when confronted with allegations that 
Florencia Pineda Tumang, 70, former pastor of St. Mary of the Lakes in 
Medford, molested their daughters in 1990.  The other family says its 
daughter was victimized because the church did not intervene.  The 
families say the deception they experienced caused them to lose faith, 
but they still believe "there is no salvation outside the church."  
Therefore, they seek damages for their eternal damnation.  Named in the 
suit are the Trenton Diocese and several officials, the parish, and 
Tumang.  The priest, charged last year with fondling one of the girls, 
has left the area and may be hiding in the Philippines. 

Should religious groups and their employees be required to report 
allegations of child sexual abuse to authorities? Cook County (Ill.) 
State Attorney Jack O'Malley and State Sen. Aldo DeAngelis think so.  
O'Malley first promised legislation last year.  He found that of the 93 
detailed pages on sexual abuse cases within the Chicago Archdiocese 
between 1951 and 1991, few had been reported to law enforcement 
agencies or the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services.  
(Roman Catholic Church officials said in the report that all 
allegations had been investigated.)  The proposed law would put 
churches in the same group as schools, hospitals, and day-care centers, 
and others with "positions of trust and authority over children."  They 
must report any suspicions of abuse or neglect to the Department of 
Children and Family Services on a toll-free hotline.  Those who refuse 
to report can be found guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by 
up to one year in prison and as much as a $1,000 fine.  A similar bill 
in Wisconsin has Catholic and Protestant clergy concerned about 
violating confidentiality and church-state separation. 
...The Archdiocese of Chicago has installed a toll-free hotline for 
alleged victims of sexual misconduct by Roman Catholic Church priests, 
employees, or volunteers.  Cardinal Joseph Bernardin said the telephone 
service was a response to his pastoral promise to see to the well-being 
of the community and especially its children.  1-800-994-6200 will be 
monitored during the day, and be handled by a voice-mail system at 
night.  Investigations will be subject to the sexual misconduct 
policies established last fall, and are likely to begin within two days 
of receiving the calls. 

Lesbian minister Jane Spahr's "evangelistic" ministry, That All May 
Freely Serve, is under way.  The campaign will visit congregations in 
major cities in hopes of breaking down barriers that prevent 
homosexuals from serving in the church. Although the Presbyterian 
Church (U.S.A.) ruled Spahr's lifestyle made her unfit to pastor (NIRR 
11/16/92), the PCUSA moderator, John Fife, spoke at her commissioning 
in Rochester, N.Y.  Supporters in other cities also held services to 
"celebrate and empower" her outreach. 
...Downtown Presbyterian Church, which had called Spahr to the pulpit, 
is sponsoring her as a full-time evangelist (NIRR 1/25); her send-off 
coincided with the day she would have been installed.  Funding, so far 
about $8,000, has come from a bequest and a 1,000-letter fund-raising 
appeal, co-pastor Rose Mitchell said.  Spahr, however, will continue 
her employment with Spectrum, a ministry to San Francisco area 
homosexuals she co-founded in 1983. 
..."She needs to be talking to as many Presbyterian groups as possible 
between now and the General Assembly," Mitchell told Religious News 
Service.  The PCUSA's policy-making body meets in June, and will likely 
re-discuss how its 2.9 million members should view homosexuality.  A 
number of presbyteries have asked the General Assembly to give them the 
autonomy and responsibility to decide how gays and lesbians may serve 
in their churches.  Mitchell said the church had an "incredible 
network" in place to see that Spahr spoke with PCUSA opinion leaders 
and decision makers. 

A financial crisis in the PCUSA will force a major reorganization, 
according to denominational headquarters in Louisville, Ky.  Mainline 
Presbyterian churches have been losing members over church and 
theological policies considered liberal by many lay members.  And many 
contributions remain at local and regional levels, further complicating 
money matters for the church's national structure.  A 12-person "Shape 
and Form Task Force" charged with planning the restructuring suggests 
reducing the PCUSA's 12 organizational units into three, and cutting $7 
million from the 1994 budget.  The changes will likely result in a 
downsizing of national staff between 20% and 40%.  The committee's 
recommendations will be forwarded to the church council, which meets 
later this month.  If approved, the plan will then go to the General 
Assembly meeting.  One change likely to result from the streamlining: a 
new emphasis on congregational rather than denominational 
decision-making. 

Southern Baptist conservatives want the Women's Missionary Union to be 
more faithful.  The women of the 100-yearold missions auxiliary have 
agreed to provide some support to the missionary-sending efforts of the 
more moderate, breakaway Cooperative Baptist Fellowship.  The CBF 
missions program, led by former SBC Foreign Missions Board head Keith 
Parks, has begun to fund its own overseas outreaches, without what it 
calls fundamentalist theology.  The WMU insists it is no less devoted 
to the SBC if it offers missionary publications to a variety of Baptist 
groups. 
...The convention's executive committee adopted a resolution demanding 
exclusive WMU-SBC cooperation. Leaders of the 15.2-million-member 
denomination said they expect the WMU to support only the Cooperative 
Program, the Lottie Moon foreign evangelism offering each Christmas, 
and the Annie Armstrong Easter Offering for home missions.  The 
committee said the denomination's support of WMU would be contingent on 
such a promise. 

"Change or die," the 20 ecumenical members of a Partners in Mission 
consultation team told the Episcopal Church. The group, representing 13 
churches, spent two weeks visiting 19 Episcopal dioceses.  At a Chicago 
meeting, Presiding Bishop Edmond Browning echoed the concerns of the 
PIM group, saying the denomination must, as Winston Churchill said, 
"take change by the hand before it takes you by the throat."  Critical 
observations included the dioceses' ambivalence, "ranging from 
indifference to hostility," toward the national church structure.  
Episcopal News Service said the committee also was alarmed by 
continuing sexism, clericalism, and racism, despite efforts to be 
inclusive.  They urged the church to focus more on people than issues, 
and Browning emphasized the importance of sharing "this life-giving 
experience" with fellow churchgoers. 

The Committee of Pro-Life Catholics warned its Chicago diocese to 
oppose abortion more, or pay the price.  A letter to Cardinal Joseph 
Bernardin, signed by 331 Catholics, said members of the group would not 
support the diocese financially (some are making donations to 
"orthodox" Catholic churches) until they saw "convincing evidence" of 
obedience to the pope's instruction to provide church leadership and 
support for pro-life causes.  The letter said that within the diocese 
homilies against abortion are rare or non-existent; some parish priests 
vilify pro-lifers from the pulpit; students in Catholic schools have 
some "pro-abortion" teachers; and young parents are not taught the 
"abortifacient character" of contraceptives. Leaders for the group said 
they prayed both for the cardinal and for his removal.  Their letter 
was timed to reach Bernardin before his five-year report to the pope at 
the Vatican last week. 

The sense of smell is being used in the fight against abortion, and 
pro-choice advocates say it stinks.  Butyric acid, a common flavor 
enhancer, by itself emits a foul, long-lasting odor.  The National 
Coalition of Abortion Providers, a lobbying group for 180 clinics, 
reported that about 55 facilities nationwide have been hit with 
chemical attacks from 1992 to the present.  San Diego, Calif., clinics 
reported five attacks in the last two weeks alone.  Most often, the 
group says, butyric acid is taken into clinics in a hypodermic syringe, 
and is squirted under doors, onto ceilings, or into locks and keyholes. 
Sometimes it is left in bathrooms.  Butyric acid may ruin furniture and 
carpeting, and can be harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through 
the skin.  The concentrated smell, which naturally occurs in rancid 
butter and perspiration, rarely fails to drive people outdoors to 
escape the stench. 
...Police in many cities treat the vandalism too casually, NCAP 
charged.  At least 63 members of Congress, in a nonpartisan movement, 
have asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to study the attacks.  
Some representatives alleged that pro-life groups are involved.  The 
Center for Reproductive Law & Policy joined in the request for FBI 
assistance. Representatives say they may propose legislation to combat 
the sabotage. 

The death of abortionist David Gunn March 10 is the first reported 
adult fatality related to a protest.  The confessed assailant, Michael 
Griffin, shot Gunn three times in the back with a .38 caliber 
snub-nosed revolver.  Gunn was hit from point-blank range as he left 
his car to enter the Pensacola (Fla.) Women's Medical Services Clinic, 
which he operated. Witnesses among the dozen Rescue America abortion 
protesters said Griffin, who is not a member, told the doctor, "Don't 
kill any more babies."  Griffin turned himself in to police at the 
site.  He had asked the congregation at nearby Whitfield Assembly of 
God to pray for the doctor's salvation, and that he would begin to obey 
the Bible.  Plans for the peaceful protest were also discussed that 
Sunday.  Congregants said Griffin showed no signs of violence, but 
court documents indicate Griffin had threatened his wife and children 
and physically abused them during a near divorce.  He was said to be 
undergoing counseling.  Police say he acted alone.  Griffin asked for 
permission to keep his Bible in his jail cell as a legal document.  He 
has been assigned an attorney, but he said he wanted to represent 
himself.  Griffin will be arraigned April 1, and is being held without 
bond. 
...Gunn's death has pro-choice advocates demanding protection by and 
under law.  In what the National Abortion Rights Action League 
described as "a call to action to pro-choice America," many groups 
urged the immediate passage of two abortion-rights laws: the Freedom of 
Choice Act, and the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances bill.  NARAL 
President Kate Michelman said the government should assure that 
"vigilantes, terrorists, and religious extremists do not take away our 
basic right to choose."  Pam Maraldo, president of Planned Parenthood 
Federation of America, "outraged and gravely concerned" over the 
"obscene and cowardly act," said the "campaign of terror must be 
stopped."  She urged President Clinton to use all law enforcement 
agencies to bring responsible parties to justice.  Clinton's statement 
indicated he would do just that.  "As a nation committed to rule of 
law, we cannot allow violent vigilantes to restrict the rights of 
American women."  Recently appointed Attorney General Janet Reno 
promised a careful and vigorous investigation of the "horrible and 
tragic crime." 
...Violence has increased and might become even more common in the 
abortion wars.  "Something like this was inevitable," said Ron 
Fitzsimmons, of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers.  
"Anti-abortionists feel they are losing ground," which will result in 
"desperate acts," PPFA's Maraldo said.  The Center for Reproductive Law 
& Policy's Janet Benshoff noted the likelihood of "more grassroots 
violence" with the change to a pro-choice administration.  NARAL's 
Michelman cited broad categories of violence "in the name of life": 
arson, bombings, clinic blockades, chemical attacks, and stalkings.  
The National Abortion Federation, calling for FBI and Justice 
Department assistance, cited statistics of escalating violence against 
abortion clinics over the last three years.  Vandalism more than 
doubled from 1991 to 1992, and three times as many arson attacks were 
reported in 1992 than in 1990. 
...Some pro-life leaders agreed that violence may increase.  National 
Right To Life Committee spokeswoman Nancy Myers said Clinton's election 
had "galvanized" pro-lifers, but added that her group disapproves of 
violent means.  If the government continues to suppress peaceful 
dissent with injunctions, said Joseph Foreman, co-founder of 
Missionaries to the PreBorn and Operation Rescue, "it turns the field 
over to the rock-throwers, the bombers, and the assassins."  According 
to John Burt, who led the Pensacola protest for Rescue America, "When 
you take away non-violent protest, there's only one way to go: 
violence." 
...Most pro-lifers decried Gunn's murder, at least to the same degree 
they condemned abortion.  Operation Rescue's Randall Terry called the 
shooting an "inappropriate repulsive act," and said he grieved for 
Gunn's family, just as he did for the thousands of children Gunn had 
murdered.  OR's Keith Tucci said for the group, "Our sympathy and 
compassion are extended to the Gunn family," and that the group's 
"commitment to the dignity of life stands for the born as well as the 
unborn."  Feminists for Life of America said it fights all forms of 
violence, including abortion.  "My real wish is that all of the killing 
on both sides of clinic doors will end," said Jessica Crossed, FLA's 
legislative advocate.  NRTLC President Wanda Franz denounced the 
violence against Gunn as it condemns the "violence of abortion that has 
killed 30 million unborn children in the last 20 years."  Added NRTLC's 
Myers, "No one who is truly pro-life could engage in violence."  Clarke 
Forsythe, general counsel for Americans United For Life, said the 
murder was "lawless and deplorable." But "violence," in the womb or 
against abortion providers, "is not the solution.  It's the problem." 
...Other groups, including Rescue America, were hesitant to condemn 
Griffin's actions.  Rescue America's president, Robert Treshman, said, 
"While we think Gunn's death is unfortunate, the fact is that a number 
of mothers would have been put at risk today, and over a dozen babies 
would have died at his hands."  The group said that it hoped Gunn had 
"a chance to ask for God's forgiveness for his part in the abortion 
holocaust before his demise."  The Houston-based headquarters has set 
up a fund for Griffin's wife and daughters, which is not to be used for 
his legal defense.  Missionaries to the Preborn's Matthew Trewhella 
said his group would not condemn the shooter.  The group's statement, 
by Joseph Foreman, said that Gunn's killing would be more clearly 
condemnable if the five to 10 "human beings [who were] scheduled for 
execution" had not been spared.  Griffin's actions, "however motivated, 
will result in children's lives being saved."  But Rescue America's 
John Burt also said, "All life is sacred, both born and unborn. . . . 
Only God has the right to take a life." 

Add criminal contempt of court to Randall Terry's conviction record.  
The Operation Rescue founder was found guilty of violating a court 
order by "aiding and abetting" pro-life activist Harley Belew, who 
tried to hand Bill Clinton a human fetus one morning before the 
Democratic National Convention (NIRR 7/27/92).  Terry and OR had been 
ordered not to act on announced plans to give Clinton an aborted child. 
 U.S. District Court Judge Robert Ward dismissed a second contempt 
charge against Terry, which would have required proof he knew about the 
plot yet did nothing to stop it.  Terry, who will be sentenced on May 
21, could serve six months in prison.  Belew still faces civil contempt 
charges. 
...But Robert Schenck was found innocent of disorderly conduct for 
displaying a dead fetus to pro-choice activists. The Assemblies of God 
minister was found not to have created "a physically offensive 
condition" outside a Buffalo women's clinic last spring.  Abortion 
rights demonstrators said Schenck had shaken the fetus in peoples' 
faces, and used it as a weapon.  Schenck said he hoped seeing a fetus 
would convince protestors that abortion was wrong.  A judge ruled that 
Schenck did not plan to create a disturbance, and that he was 
exercising his right to free speech. 

St. Mark's Church, in Portland, Ore., missed its first deadline to move 
on purpose.  "We have no intention of complying," pastor Charles Osborn 
said of an Episcopal Church order to return all parish records, keys, 
and financial assets (NIRR 2/22).  Osborn said he had informed Bishop 
Robert Ladehoff by letter that the Oregon Diocese had no claim to the 
congregation's building, which was donated by a parishioner.  St. 
Mark's is now affiliated with the Anglican Church in America, for which 
Osborn serves as West Coast archdeacon. 
...Trinity-St. Michael's can't have its church and leave it too, the 
Connecticut Supreme Court said.  When the Fairfield congregation broke 
with the Episcopal Church over women's ordination and a new prayer 
book, it continued to meet in the same building, though it had 
reaffiliated with the traditional Anglican Diocese of Christ the King.  
In 1986, the Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut sued to regain use of the 
property.  The justices upheld a 1991 Superior Court ruling that the 
property and church trust funds belonged to the Episcopal Church, a 
state law journal reported. 

December presents a problem for the American Civil Liberties Union of 
New Jersey.  The group has filed suit against the Trenton-area Cherry 
Hill public schools, which display information on religious holidays 
within December.  Bulletin boards have sections for Christmas, 
Hanukkah, and Kwaanza, an African harvest festival; and monthly school 
calendars also list approved religious holidays and their significance. 
 James Katz, volunteering his time for the ACLU suit, says the 
difficulties are three-fold.  The schools are promoting certain 
religious holidays over others; the displays are mandated; and some 
public school children are very young and impressionable.  "We don't 
know why the school system wants to entangle itself in the issue of 
religion, " he said.  "It's a private matter." 

Focus on the Family's "How to Help Your Kids Say No to Sex" will join 
the sex-education curricula of the Conejo Valley (Calif.) Unified 
School District.  But the decision, which will affect the district's 
18,000 students in the Thousand Oaks area, was reached only after 
heated and lengthy public debate.  Critics, including the American 
Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, said approving the 
brochure was a violation of church and state separation.  One Jewish 
parent, supportive of abstinence, was concerned that her children might 
be taught "Christian values."   The school board effected a compromise: 
teachers may use only the first 10 pages of the 19-page booklet, which 
gives medical and statistical support for promoting abstinence rather 
than "safe sex."  The second part of the pamphlet includes recommended 
sex-education sources for children and parents, 32 endnotes to the 
text, and a detailed list of other booklets available from James 
Dobson's organization. Extracurricular student religious groups may 
meet in high schools that allow other after-school clubs, a panel of 
the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3-0.  The judges said the 
Federal Equal Access Act overrules a Washington state constitution ban 
prohibiting religious meetings on school grounds.  The suit was raised 
in 1984 by a 25-student nondenominational religious club at Lindbergh 
High School, in Renton, Wash., that was refused permission to hold 
Bible study and prayer meetings.  When the case first was considered, 
Lindbergh allowed no extracurricular groups access to school grounds.  
But the U.S. Supreme Court sent the case back to the lower court for 
reconsideration, based on a 1990 decision saying the federal law 
superseded the state constitution.  Since the earlier rulings, 
Lindbergh had opened facilities to noncurricular groups, thus creating 
"a limited public forum" under the Equal Access Law. 

Cub Scout meetings in public schools are not unconstitutional, even if 
the group requires a belief in God, according to a district ruling.  
Rob Sherman, a spokesman for American Atheists, had filed a suit 
against the Riley School in Wheeling Township, a north Chicago suburb.  
His 10-year-old son Ricky was kicked out of the Cub Scout den that 
meets at Riley because he refused to pledge his duty to God as part of 
the Cub Scout oath.  Sherman alleged that the district should not 
accommodate a group that showed favoritism to religious practices.  But 
U.S. District Judge James Zagel, who recently ruled against another 
American Atheists' suit (NIRR 1/25), said Riley treated the scouts just 
as it did other organizations using its facilities.  The Cub Scouts are 
allowed to hang posters advertising their meetings, which take place 
after school hours, and are not attended by faculty.  Sherman and his 
attorney say they will appeal. 
..."God is great.  God is good.  But don't thank him for the food."  A 
proposed American Atheists lawsuit convinced the Hickory Hills (Ill.) 
Park District to stop snack-time prayers last month.  Preschool 
teachers had led children to recite the simple poem for several 
decades.  About 50 parents at a board meeting this month protested the 
district's decision; most supported the prayer as a way to teach moral 
fundamentals.   Sherman took the case on behalf of an atheist couple 
who protested their 3-year-old's inclusion in the prayer.  Sherman told 
reporters it was "fine" if parents considered faith important.  "Teach 
your children religion at home." 
...An atheist group has a budget cut for the president: abolish 
"unconstitutional" government-paid chaplains.  The Freedom from 
Religion Foundation, based in Madison, Wis., in a letter urged Clinton 
to fire ministers such as Richard Halverson and James Ford, the Senate 
and House chaplains.  "In return for a two-minute prayer to open 
sessions of Congress, taxpayers are paying more than $115,000," wrote 
Annie Laurie Gaylord, editor of the group's Freethought  Today paper.  
The letter said spiritual advisers were available throughout Washington 
to officials who needed them. 

Re-proposed in both the House and the Senate: the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act.  Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) led 
the Senate's 32 co-sponsoring signatories, as Rep. Charles Schumer 
(D-N.Y.) and Christopher Cox (R-Calif.) did for the House's 137 
co-sponsors.  The bill is designed to reinstate the "compelling 
interest" test for government restrictions on free exercise of 
religion.  In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled against American Indian use 
of peyote in religious ceremonies, and said that Oregon need not pay 
unemployment to workers fired over their illegal use of the 
hallucinogen [Employment Division v. Smith]. 
...The RFRA has support from numerous Protestant denominations, as well 
as widespread endorsements from the American Muslim Council, the 
Christian Legal Society, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, 
the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Council of Churches, 
People for the American Way, and the National Association of 
Evangelicals.  Passage had been opposed by the U.S. Catholic Conference 
and the National Right To Life Committee (NIRR 6/1/92), which had 
expressed concern that the act would be used to support a religious 
right to abortion.  The USCC reversed its two-year opposition when 
clarifying statements were added to assure that there would be no 
changes in "government funding, benefits or exemptions" to 
organizations like hospitals and schools that had religious ties.  Also 
added was abortion-neutral language not to "expand, contract or alter" 
religious claims to abortion rights.  Kennedy said the bill would have 
cleared last year, given more time.  President Clinton has endorsed the 
bill. 

The Metropolitan Community Church will hear Playboy Enterprises CEO 
Christie Hefner speak on AIDS ministries at its General Conference in 
Phoenix July 18-25.  Among the workshop offerings: U.S. HIV policy, 
keeping lesbianism fun, spirituality and cruising, meta-church growth 
through cell groups, "womyn" of colors together, worship in the 
evangelical tradition, and healing for childhood abuse.  Other 
highlights: a '60s sock hop, credit courses from MCC's Samaritan 
College, a 25th anniversary fiesta, same-sex sharing sessions, and a 
special party "for men only." 

Corrections: The Association of Evangelical Relief and Development 
Organizations (NIRR 1/25) uses fair market values that usually are 
equivalent to bulk rates, not equal to retail sales prices. . . . The 
Caleb Project (NIRR 3/8) says that Kazakhstan has no indigenous Kazakh 
church, and had no regular Christian workers in the country as of 1990.

Vol. 7, No. 6                                                          
March 8, 1993 

This month, Youth With A Mission is praying, along with the billions of 
Muslims observing Ramadan.  More than 7,000 full-time YWAMers and tens 
of thousands of Christians from 70 missions, denominations, and church 
groups are participating in "30 Days of Focused Prayer" Feb. 20 to 
March 23.  The Colorado Springs-based mission organization designed the 
campaign to help stop the "years of prayerlessness for and prejudice 
against" Muslims.  YWAM officials say only 2% of Protestant 
missionaries worldwide work among Muslims, with a ratio of 1:1 million. 
 They say the church is ignorant of Islam, and many believe Muslims are 
impossible to reach.  But although YWAM officials agree that conversion 
is difficult, international bases report an "unprecedented receptivity" 
in parts of the Islamic world.  To aid participants in the monthlong 
prayer vigil, the group's 32-page prayer guide explains basic Islamic 
theology and history.  In addition to praying, YWAM encourages some 
fasting, a discipline Muslims practice between sunrise and sunset 
during Ramadan. 

Kazakhstan, a largely Islamic country south of Russia and west of 
China, has no indigenous Christian church, says the Caleb Project, an 
international Christian research and mobilization organization.  The 
Littleton, Colo., group reports that 8.2 million Kazakhs, formerly 
under Soviet rule, are being pressured to give their allegiance to 
other political and religious forces.  Until 1990, no known Christian 
workers ever had reached the mountainous, rural regions of the country; 
one Kazakh woman told a researcher, "We were taught that Jesus Christ 
was a myth; we did not know he was historical."  The country's few 
churches, usually in large cities, are Russian or Korean; and they are 
often unaccepting of Kazakh people. Since 1992, seven international 
Christian missions agencies, including Youth With a Mission, Isaachar, 
and Navigators Missions, have targeted Kazakhstan in hopes of having 
5,000 workers there by 2000. 

South African Christian youth, despite segregation of their churches, 
are working together, said Steve Zimri, who chairs the country's 
Assemblies of God Sunday School Association W. P.  "It's a compromise 
of the Gospel to just have fun with kids," he said.  As head of 
Christian education for 127 racially separate congregations, he has for 
20 years helped plan quarterly open-air services where hundreds of 
teens of all races -- black, colored, and white -- preach at shopping 
malls.  Invitations to accept Christ, he said, are common and 
effective.  He organizes his teen workers to follow up with each new 
believer.  All-night prayer services, weekly Bible studies, day-long 
Sunday school classes, and church services at nonbelievers' homes are 
among their discipleship methods.  Zimri said he senses a new, growing 
interest in Christianity, not yet a revival, but a freedom of 
expression, with less fear of imprisonment.  Poverty, discrimination, 
and language barriers have slowed church integration, he said, as has a 
lack of leadership.  He noted that U.S. anti-apartheid sanctions 
thwarted missionaries from coming to South Africa to train believers. 
...Zimri found American Christian teens "undisciplined" and "timid in 
their faith."   On his first American visit to large 
interdenominational churches, he was "shocked" that young people would 
chew gum or put their feet on furniture. With America's wealth of 
Christian resources, Zimri said he couldn't understand the lack of 
discipline.  The full-time banker and full-time minister suggested that 
American youth workers and teachers need to "speak the truth in love." 

Hundreds of thousands of Christian teens were "partying with a purpose" 
in Operation Powerlink.  The grassroots teen evangelism project, 
co-sponsored by Sonlife Ministries in Wheaton, Ill., and Josh McDowell 
Ministries in Dallas, joined pizza with the power of television.  The 
"see-you-at-the-party" concept was simple: teens invited several 
nonChristian friends over to eat and watch a simultaneous American 
broadcast, which also presented the gospel. 
...Trinity Broadcasting Network aired the one-hour special at 10:00 
p.m. EST.  The simul-broadcast was split in two. The first half-hour 
was all-live, and featured a welcome from Josh McDowell to what was 
billed as the world's largest pizza party and a home-work-free zone.  
Contemporary Christian artists Petra, Michael W. Smith, and Carman 
sang; and TBN used interactive video to drop in on 10 parties from 
Hawaii to the Yukon to Pennsylvania to show what was going on. The 
second half of the program aired a 30-minute video (also available to 
those without cable-satellite access to TBN).  The video featured a 
number of individual dramatic vignettes and the testimony of McDowell.  
After his televised invitation, teens at the parties broke into small 
groups and presented the gospel and their own conversion experiences to 
their guests. After going over the follow-up materials, and setting up 
another time to meet with converts, most partygoers topped off the 
pizza with dessert. 
...Planning began four years ago with McDowell's dream of a 
simultaneous outreach via peer evangelism.  When 25 denominational 
leaders agreed with his proclamation vision, they named it Operation 
Powerlink.  In partnership with Sonlife Ministries, McDowell's team 
grew to include a base of 60 denominations and parachurch groups. 
...Powerlinkers said they felt a special affinity to the millions of 
teens who participated in the "See You at the Pole" prayer rallies last 
fall (NIRR 10/5/92), and that many of the same teens were involved.  In 
fact, prayer was an important link between the two events.  Students 
and churches participating in the Powerlink party held "concerts of 
prayer." Feb. 28 was declared National Day of Prayer for the Youth of 
Our Country, and on March 3 students asked God for guidance and 100,000 
decisions to trust Christ.  Although the numbers are not yet available, 
Powerlink officials estimated that as many as 1 million teens may have 
participated in parties or viewed the presentation. 
...Sonlife Director Dann Spader and McDowell placed Powerlink in a 
historical context of a "great awakening." The leaders noted the 
important roles young people played in Western-world revivals dating 
from the 1730s to the present. Citing the growth of the numbers and 
sizes of youth ministries and movements today, and a renewed emphasis 
on prayer and evangelism that generally precedes revival, youth leaders 
sought to involve teens, and benefit from their high level of spiritual 
commitment.  Both ministries are involved in various evangelism and 
church growth movements. 

Lights, Camera, Action: Campus Crusade for Christ's Jesus film 
continues to roll.  Project Director Paul Eschleman said the film, in 
26 Eastern European language translations, has been shown in 20 capital 
cities formerly behind the Iron Curtain.  Education ministers in 
Albania, Mongolia, and all of the Muslim republics of the Commonwealth 
of Independent States attended premiere screenings.  CCC 
representatives have been meeting with public school teachers in the 
former U.S.S.R. for years, holding more than 21 conferences, each 
attended by about 8,000 teaching professionals.  CCC gave each a copy 
of the film to show in public, as well as more than 1.5 million 
follow-up materials.  Among the educational support is a course in 
Christian ethics and morality, also used by the CoMission, to which CCC 
belongs. 
...In addition, Eschleman said, 13 million free copies of the gospel of 
Luke were donated to Russian homes, many of which had had no access to 
a Bible since the Bolshevik revolution.  He also noted that 557 film 
teams have been trained in the Commonwealth of Independent States' 11 
time zones.  Each received at least one of the 600 equipment sets CCC 
provided.  "We expect the churches themselves to show the film to more 
than 30 million people during the next two years," Eschleman said, 
estimating that already 110 million Eastern Europeans had seen the 
film. 

A new 32-page manual may help Christian organizations enter the former 
Soviet Union more easily.  Fellowship Travel International is 
publishing How to Begin, Establish, and Maintain Russian Ministries, a 
how-to guide that details ministry travel concerns from passports to 
networking to cultural awareness.  FTI is familiar with the 
ever-changing  as the agency lobbies for preferential airfares for 
clergy and parachurch work worldwide, especially in China, the Middle 
East, and the former U.S.S.R.  As with any travel agency, clients are 
not charged for the services.  The Richmond, Va., company said Rock 
International Ltd. Co., its sister organization with an office in 
Moscow, can offer start-to-finish registration with the Russian 
republic for about $3,000.  FTI President Wayne Lawhorn urges Christian 
ministries to go to Russia now, while peoples' hearts are open as wide 
as the political doors. 

Wandering in the wilderness isn't just an activity of biblical times.  
Ask "Snuggles, the Love Clown," also known as Jeff Brodsky.  The 
minister will walk 101 miles across Death Valley in the 
California-Nevada desert beginning March 28 to bring attention to the 
needs of suffering children worldwide.  Funds raised will go to 
Brodsky's children's center in Hyderabad, India, as well as to the Home 
for Destitute Children and Children of Lepers in Calcutta, Food for the 
Hungry in Somalia, and the Shishu Children's Hospital in Daca, 
Bangladesh. 

"Take me to Miami," hijacker Woody Edouard told the pilot of a DC-3 
owned by Missionary Flights International. The relief group runs an 
aerial shuttle four times weekly between West Palm Beach, Fla., and Cap 
Haitien, Haiti, where the 24-year-old seized a female missionary as a 
hostage, and commandeered the DC-3's two crewmen and 10 missionaries 
returning to the States.  Edouard held the pilot at gunpoint throughout 
much of the refueling and flight, but surrendered himself to FBI 
authorities at Miami International Airport.  None of the passengers was 
injured, although he had fired into the body of the plane.  Edouard has 
been charged with one count of air piracy, and could be sentenced up to 
20 years in prison, press reports said. 
..."The Lord took over," said Baptist Bob Johnston, who spent much of 
the flight preaching to the hijacker.  Although he admitted he was 
scared, Johnston, a missionary to Haiti, said Edouard grew calmer as 
they discussed "spiritual things" in Creole.  Over the course of the 
trip, Johnston shared the gospel with the hijacker, and told him he'd 
be better off to give up his gun before arriving in Miami.  Edouard 
handed Johnston the gun, since he didn't "need it anymore." Johnston, 
who said the Haitian accepted Christ, told reporters that Edouard 
claimed to be fleeing Haiti for political reasons. "He said he'd rather 
be in prison and alive here than dead in Haiti," Johnston said. The 
religious right of the '90s is a lot like the KKK of the '20s and the 
McCarthyites of the '50s, according to Colorado Republican candidate, 
Sharon Klusman.  Speaking at an event sponsored by the Citizens Project 
(NIRR 1/25, 11/30/92), she also told a crowd of 250 at Colorado 
Springs' First Congregational Church that "religious fundamentalists" 
are "a threat to democracy."  The Citizens Project said that in several 
more "Get Involved" seminars it hopes to teach its growing membership 
practical ways to influence local government and public education 
officials.  It also wants to counter "totalitarian groups," including 
Focus on the Family, the Christian Coalition, and other conservative 
political or parachurch organizations.  "Not to defeat [them] is to 
court disaster," Klusman said. 
..."The Christian Right is doing everything right," said Colorado 
Springs Republican Marcy Morrison. "They're politically astute, savvy, 
and they know how to put money to work effectively; they run good 
campaigns, not only in Colorado, but across all America.  Now, should 
you be critical, or concerned, of that?"   She was one of several 
speakers invited by the local chapter of Hadassah, a Jewish community 
group, to address the gathering of 400 at Colorado College on the 
"potential takeover of their private and public freedoms by the 
religious right."  The gathering featured representatives from the 
Pikes Peak Library Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, the 
Citizens Project, and the AntiDefamation League of B'nai B'rith.  
Speakers explained how "fundamentalists" have influenced censorship, 
have forgotten the separation of church and state, and have ensured 
discrimination by supporting Amendment 2. 
...Colorado did the right thing by supporting Amendment 2, according to 
Colorado for Family Values Executive Director Kevin Tebedo.  In the 
group's first Fairness Watch newsletter to its 8,000 supporters, he 
called on CFV allies to "keep homosexual-slanted policies from 
overtaking your community [by] keeping the issue and its importance 
before the minds of the voters in your local newspaper."  Tebedo also 
encouraged readers to tell their communities that Judge Bayless' 
decision put aside a majority-approved measure, and to show "how these  
legislative compromises  are actually worse than what they claim to 
solve."  CFV also has launched throughout the state several day-long 
"Community Action" seminars, described as "a concentrated course in 
countering the militant homosexual agenda." 

Who is the most prominent woman of the religious right?  Concerned 
Women for America's Beverly LaHaye, according to the February edition 
of Mirabella.  The magazine says of the 600,000-member CWA, "If the 
Stepford Wives formed a hate group, it would look as normal -- and be 
as terrifying."  Mirabella says LaHaye "has surpassed Phyllis Schlafly" 
in importance, and continues to gain an audience through a monthly 
magazine, videotapes, and a syndicated radio call-in show, all financed 
by CWA's $10 million annual budget. 
...Beverly LaHaye Live was named the National Religious Broadcasters' 
Talk Show of the Year.  The program, cohosted by Jim Woodall, was cited 
for its stimulation and leadership in discussing moral, political, 
social, and religious issues relevant to Christians, as well as having 
an involved listenership of more than 500,000. 

The City of Angels played host to the National Religious Broadcasters' 
50th annual convention-exposition Feb. 13-16. The crowd of registered 
broadcasters and interested parties, some 3,200, was small for the NRB. 
 Total attendance saw a noteworthy reduction as well.  Including those 
present for a gospel concert, the Hispanic NRB activities, and other 
auxiliary events, an NRB spokesman estimated that about 7,500 attended, 
down from the usual 10,000 plus figures the Washington, D.C., 
conventions enjoy.  Nevertheless, NRB announced plans to take their 
show on the road to Nashville in 1995 and to Jerusalem in 1996, after a 
return to the nation's capital next year. 
...Leaving Washington signaled a dramatic change in emphasis.  
Contrasted with conventions scandalized by televangelism ethics 
problems of the late 1980s, NRB focused on spiritual topics.  As the 
convention opened, Bible teacher Kay Arthur read a resolution 
confessing the sins of the nation.  General session speeches by Korean 
megachurch pastor David Yonggi Cho, Southern Baptist Convention 
President Ed Young, and well-known preachers Stephen Olford and Greg 
Laurie dealt with prayer, evangelism, and holiness.  Some general 
sessions closed in well-attended, small-group prayer circles.  Politics 
joined with prayer as Christian Broadcasting Network founder Pat 
Robertson told the anniversary banquet crowd to "cry out to God for a 
mighty spiritual awakening, a revival in the hearts of people."  On the 
eve of President Clinton's State of the Union address, Robertson said 
the America's problems were moral, not simply economic.  "We are 
fighting a cultural war for the future of America." 
...For the first time in recent years, a U.S. president did not address 
the gathering, nor did any politicians speak. President Clinton was 
invited to speak, either in person or by video, but he declined, said a 
spokesman.  While broadcasters individually criticized the Clinton 
administration for its stands on abortion and homosexuals in the 
military, the NRB leaders sought a reconciliation of sorts.  "Our hope 
is that the new administration will work with us," said David Clark of 
KMC Media, Dallas.  Clark, formerly NRB president, was renamed the NRB 
chairman/executive director, and E. Brandt Gustavson became president, 
under officers' titles redesignated by the new NRB constitution. 
...The broadcasters strongly opposed a congressional plan to restore 
the Fairness Doctrine.  Repealed in 1987 by President Reagan, the 
measure could force religious broadcasters to give equal air to 
opposing viewpoints on controversial subjects, including abortion, 
homosexuality, and "family values."  Gustavson said there are enough 
secular outlets for divergent points of view without requiring 
Christian stations to violate their viewers' beliefs. 
...EFICOM is no more.  The NRB disbanded its Ethics and Financial 
Integrity Commission, and turned the responsibilities over to the 
Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA).  "We never 
intended to be in the accrediting business," said an NRB spokesman.  
NRB will require members with broadcast-related revenue of $500,000 and 
above to join ECFA, as well as an NRB Ethics Committee, which is still 
being defined. 
...The L.A. convention was not without controversy.  When NRB leaders 
refused to show The Hard Truth, a visually explicit film about 
abortion, as part of the official program, 11 evangelicals who 
requested the screening criticized the NRB's "lip service" to abortion 
opposition.  The nine-minute video was shown in a side room.  A debate 
on AIDS was also relegated to a small room, scheduled apart from the 
official convention events. 
...Controversy continued on "Hollywood Night," co-hosted by 
pastor-broadcasters Lloyd Ogilvie and Jack Hayford.  They paid tribute 
to some 800 L.A. entertainment professionals who are born-again 
Christians.  Among the attending "missionaries" to Tinseltown were 
Disney regular Dean Jones, singers Pat and Debbie Boone, and soap-opera 
actress-singer Carol Lawrence.  Some camps questioned why media-film 
critic Michael Medved, an Orthodox Jew, was invited to address a 
Christian convention with the theme "We Proclaim Christ."  Gustavson 
defended Medved's invitation to speak, saying his pro-family positions 
were not in conflict with NRB values.  "We have no problem in inviting 
such nonevangelicals to our conventions."  The controversy reached its 
peak when Angela Lansbury of CBS's Murder She Wrote, received an NRB 
Centurion Award.  The actress, whom NRB honored for the "traditional, 
family, moral and spiritual values" her performances and life have 
portrayed, said her "faith in God" had driven her career.  But critics 
said they did not consider Lansbury an evangelical, nor did they 
consider murder a traditional family value. 

Although the selections and winners' acceptance speeches weren't 
televised at the 35th annual Grammy ceremonies, several Christians were 
honored for their work in Gospel music.  Petra's Unseen Power was named 
best rock-contemporary album, and Steven Curtis Chapman's The Great 
Adventure took the award for pop album.  Sometimes Miracles Hide, by 
Bruce Carroll, was the winner for best Southern album.  The Grammy for 
traditional soul album went to the legendary Shirley Caesar's He's 
Working It Out for You and A Soulful Celebration of Handel's Messiah 
(the Hallelujah Chorus was performed on the prime-time telecast, to 
much applause) took best contemporary soul album.  The best gospel 
album by a choir or chorus was Edwin Hawkins Music & Arts Seminary Mass 
Choir -- Recorded Live in Los Angeles. 
...And some of the big names gave the audience glimpses of God.  
Winners Boyz II Men thanked Jesus Christ for their success.  And Billy 
Ray Cyrus covered his achy-breaky heart with a John 3:16 sweatshirt 
with cut-off sleeves. 

Jesus goes undercover: the portrait of Christ must be covered with 
opaque material if Bloomingdale (Mich.) High School opts not to remove 
it (NIRR 2/22), said the judge who ruled the picture a violation of 
church-state separation.  The Rutherford Institute filed an appeal of 
Judge Benjamin Gibson's decision, but Midwest Coordinator David Melton 
disapproves of the interim measure.  The "plain brown wrapper" 
treatment, Melton said, put the portrait on an even par with "liquor or 
pornography."  At 11:59 p.m. a school official covered the picture with 
a piece of red and white cloth, while a group of neighbors held a 
candlelight vigil outside the school. 

American Atheists and Rob Sherman are giving up -- for now.  They will 
not appeal the U.S. District Court ruling that Zion, Ill., may use the 
phrase "In God We Trust" on its city seal (NIRR 1/25).  "Our legal 
challenge is hopeless," Sherman told reporters, adding that the group 
will "have to change strategies."  But American Atheists will revive 
the Zion case if they win their appeal to the Supreme Court over the 
Pledge of Allegiance's "one nation under God." 

A New York prosecutor was told to wash his forehead on Ash Wednesday so 
he wouldn't prejudice the jury.  David McAndrews, a Catholic, complied 
with Judge Geoffrey O'Connell's instructions, but said his civil rights 
were violated in doing so.  He disagreed that a Lenten sign of penance 
would sway the jury to convict a man of slashing his wife's tires. 

Score Boston in the homosexual-rights column for the St. Patrick's Day 
parade.  The city, to date, will follow its policy of last year.  
Suffolk Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel said that the Irish American 
Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Pride Group had a constitutional right to 
participate.  "The parade is in every rational sense a municipal 
celebration, a public festival," he said.  The homosexual group says it 
will march, despite being the only group specifically limited.  GLIB 
may have only 25 marching members, who must wear identification badges. 
 They will be allowed to carry a lead banner, but no signs, and they 
may not distribute literature.  The march sponsors, the South Boston 
Allied War Veterans Council, represented by Chester Darling, has vowed 
to file yet another appeal.  He said Zobel is known for his political, 
not legal, correctness, and their parade permit prevents state control 
over the event.  Boston's 92-year-old parade is viewed by at least 
700,000 spectators, some of whom swore and hurled beer cans at gay 
marchers last year. 
...Count New York City among the Roman Catholics' successes.  U.S. 
District Court Judge Kevin Duffy said Mayor David Dinkins' 
administration had no constitutional right to obstruct the sponsors' 
freedom of speech.  "A parade is, by its nature, a pristine form of 
speech," Duffy said, granting an injunction against city interference.  
He suggested that city officials aim for political correctness "by 
persuasion, and not by fiat."  The Ancient Order of Hibernians, who 
traditionally lead the parade as a religious celebration of a patron 
saint, had threatened to boycott the event if the Irish Lesbian and Gay 
Organization was allowed to march.  The city said it will not appeal 
the decision. 

It's up to the Supreme Court justices how to rule after two hours of 
arguments over a pair of important church-state separation cases.  And 
their rulings could change the way such cases have been decided since 
1971 under the "Lemon test" prohibiting the advancement or entanglement 
of religion with government concerns.  Critics have argued that Lemon 
yields inconsistent decisions, and should be refined to be less 
restrictive of religion.  (NIRR 12/14/92, 7/13/92). 
...In the first case argued, Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union 
(N.Y.) Free School District, an evangelical group was not allowed to 
rent a public school building to show a series of religious films.  The 
church's attorney, Jay Alan Sekulow of the American Center for Law and 
Justice, said that since the school district allows almost all civic 
and secular groups to use its facilities after hours, it cannot refuse 
access to religious groups just because they are religious.  John 
Hoefling, the New York school system's lawyer, argued that schools are 
a "limited public forum" that need not allow for proselytizing.  
Hoefling, responding to a question from Justice Antonin Scalia, said 
that anti-religious or religiously neutral groups, such as communists 
or agnostics, could use the buildings by night, but religious groups 
could not without violating the establishment clause.  Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist equated his argument to saying a ban on left-wingers 
was neutral since it prohibited both communists and socialists.  
Sekulow insisted that the chapel sought only equal access, and said 
such groups should not be squelched just because a school board 
disagreed with their views. 
...The second case pitted a deaf Catholic school student, James 
Zobrest, against the Catalina Foothills (Ariz.) School District, which 
refused to provide him with a government-paid sign-language interpreter 
because he attended a parochial school.  The Zobrests seek $35,000 in 
interpreters' fees.  John Richardson, the district's attorney, said a 
state-provided signer in a Christian school would have to communicate a 
religious message, and that would be a government endorsement of 
Catholicism.  Zobrest, represented by William Bentley Ball, said a 
translator was basically a human hearing aid, not a teacher, and so was 
religiously neutral.  Ball responded to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
that a similar situation involving a tutor would be impermissible, 
since a teacher would assume an active role in a student's education.  
Richardson argued that relating the life of Christ to a student was 
such an active role.  Richardson, citing Justice Anthony Kennedy, said 
the court's test was whether a "reasonable observer" could perceive 
state involvement with the church.  Rehnquist questioned Richardson's 
statement that the school district could lend a religious school 
student a mechanical hearing aid, but could not repair it without 
violating the Constitution.  "The First Amendment turns on that sort of 
fine-spun distinction?" the chief justice asked.  "Maybe it's time we 
straightened out some of that."  The court is expected to decide in 
both cases by summer. 
...In other cases with religious implications, the Supreme Court: 1) 
let stand a decision that federal civil rights laws cannot be used to 
prosecute "mock" abortion clinics, which try to convince women to 
choose to bear their children rather than terminate their pregnancies 
(The court remanded to a lower court its ruling, based on the KKK Act, 
that abortion protesters pay $375,000 for violating clinic blockades.); 
2) left intact a decision that New Jersey's attempts to regulate what 
foods could be advertised as "kosher" violated traditional and Orthodox 
Jews' religious rights; 3) reaffirmed that federal anti-discrimination 
laws did not apply to hospitals, even if they used the parents' 
financial status to determine the kind of treatment given to deformed 
newborns; 4) let stand a decision that a fertility clinic can destroy 
seven frozen human embryos, as the prospective father requested, even 
though his ex-wife said they were human beings from the time they were 
conceived; and 5) left intact a ruling that a couple cannot sue the 
government for misdiagnosing a pregnancy and for the subsequent 
"wrongful birth" of their daughter, whom they say would have been 
aborted had they known of her severe birth defects. 

The Freedom of Choice Act, under revision, is mired in congressional 
mud.  Abortion opponents maintain the bill goes beyond codifying Roe v. 
Wade, and is too extreme (NIRR 2/8).  And some FOCA supporters, in 
hopes of garnering moderate votes, agree.  They are willing to accept 
some of the restrictions that pro-life forces say Americans support: 
24-hour waiting periods, parental notification for minors, controlled 
public funding, opt-out conscience clauses.  They will concede some 
points to assure the bill's passage, and have the support of the 
National Abortion Rights Action League and Planned Parenthood.  Other 
abortion-rights hardliners, backed by the American Civil Liberties 
Union and the National Organization for Women, insist on a 
"no-compromise" approach, which accepts FOCA in its original form.  As 
it stands, FOCA would establish a national guarantee of abortion 
rights, as well as limit states' abilities to limit or regulate access 
to abortion services.  The Senate version of the bill is said to be 
more conservative than its House counterpart, and both chambers of 
Congress will likely vote on some form of FOCA this term. 
...If the Food and Drug Administration approves use of the abortion 
pill RU-486, FOCA may seem moot.  The U.S. government is working with 
Roussel-Uclaf, the French subsidiary of Hoechst AG, that manufactures 
the drug.  The company has avoided U.S. sales because anti-abortion 
forces have threatened to boycott Hoechst's U.S. branches.  
RousselUclaf officials, however, indicated they would be willing to 
discuss joint ventures if American drug companies or university or 
medical research centers would be willing to do the manufacturing.  The 
FDA banned import of RU-486 in 1989, but Clinton lifted the ban and 
urged government studies of its safety.  The pill is available in 
Sweden and Great Britain, as well as France, and a similar drug has 
been used in China. 

"God no more specifically chose Clinton and Gore to rule than he did 
Hitler," said prophecy and cult watcher Dave Hunt in his Berean Call 
newsletter.  Responding to some Christian leaders' statements that God 
chose the Democratic ticket to govern, Hunt said the president and vice 
president "advocate rebellion against God," specifically on issues of 
homosexuality, abortion, and environmentalism.  They were "far from 
being God's choice, as some claim."  Instead, God allowed them to be 
elected by a minority of Americans.  "One way or another, however, our 
country is getting what it wants and will reap what it is sowing.  Let 
no one blame God!" 

The pro-life movement has a new hero: Tim Hanchin.  The Chillicothe 
High School senior stood up at a live town meeting, cited a 
congressional study, and asked the president if life begins at 
conception, how can the United States permit 4,400 abortions each day?  
 Hanchin answered affirmatively to the president's question of whether 
women who have abortions should be tried for murder.  Clinton said at 
least Hanchin was consistent in his views, but said the matter was not 
over biological life.  Rather, it dealt with when the soul entered the 
body so that "terminat[ing] the living organism amounts to killing a 
person."  The president, seemingly rattled by Hanchin's smiling 
"self-assurance," reminded the 17-year-old that "many Christian 
ministers disagree with you," an answer that most in the crowd 
applauded.  But, even though Clinton didn't "like abortion," he said 
the government should not criminalize "activities over which even 
theologians are in serious disagreement."  Later Clinton praised 
Hanchin for having the conviction to ask a question he knew would be 
unpopular. Hanchin told reporters he appreciated Clinton's up-front and 
unpatronizing manner, and was glad the president was not offended.  
Although Hanchin said he did not expect to change Clinton's mind, he 
wanted to remind him that a lot of Americans consider abortion murder. 
...And Jamie Tellier, 15, could be ruled a juvenile delinquent for 
distributing graphic anti-abortion literature to classmates at a 
Dallas-area middle school.  The Roman Catholic eighth-grader, who has 
been arrested more than 20 times in several cities for protesting 
abortion, said the court system was using her as an "example" to other 
young "rescuers." Jamie's mother, Laura, also a pro-life advocate with 
an arrest record, is blamed for coercing her daughter into rescue 
activities.  Jamie says her mother is her inspiration, but does not 
force her to participate.  She insists that she is old enough to 
protest abortion on religious grounds.  A pre-trial hearing is set for 
March 11.  If convicted, she would be placed in a Youth Commission 
institution until her 21st birthday. 

Three Protestant churches join the groups urging President Clinton not 
to appoint a U.S. ambassador to the Vatican. The Presbyterian Church 
(U.S.A.), the Church of the Brethren, and the Seventh-day Adventist 
Church wrote a letter asking him not to "perpetuate the Reagan-Bush 
policy."  They say the ties entangle church and state (NIRR 12/28/92). 

"I am in possession of the evidence directly implicating the Vatican" 
in the James Porter sex scandals, said Jeffrey Anderson.  The St. Paul, 
Minn., attorney represents several of the former priest's alleged 
victims.  Anderson said the Vatican could not be accused of 
"complicity, but certainly participation in keeping the secret."  The 
lawyer said recently released church documents show that a bishop urged 
Porter to leave the church early in his career, and that Porter 
admitted in letters to Pope Paul VI that he had "problems" and 
"difficulties," or said he "fell."   Porter allegedly wrote, "I was 
using the priesthood as a crutch and a shield to protect me from harm." 
 Anderson said he may add the Vatican as a party to the civil lawsuits 
he has already filed.  Porter is serving a six-month sentence for 
fondling a baby sitter. 
...Massachusetts Superior Court Chief Justice Robert Steadman upheld 
Porter's indictments on 41 of 46 counts of sexual molestation filed 
against him by 32 people.  Steadman dismissed all or part of 15 
indictments for incidents that took place before August 1961 because 
the five-year statute of limitations had expired when Porter left the 
state in 1967.  In addition, Porter faces sexual-abuse charges in New 
Mexico, where he was treated for pedophilia. 

Texas evangelist James Robison wants to "preach the love of God to the 
gay community" in 1993.  The head of LIFE Outreach International in 
Fort Worth told supporters, "We don't need to beat up on homosexuals 
because everyone else is beating on them."  Robison said he was 
distressed by American Christians' "cold-hearted" and uncompassionate 
attitudes. "There's a world out there and God is breaking down the 
walls.  His love is the only answer to their problems." Homosexual lust 
is "an awful entanglement," Robison said.  And although conservative 
Christians might find gay lifestyles "disgusting," they would be 
"equally wrong not to have a godly compassion."  Robison said he hoped 
to query leaders of the Metropolitan Community Churches across the 
country to see if he could speak from their pulpits. 
...Robison may not have far to go.  Cathedral of Hope Metropolitan 
Community Church of Dallas' 1,000 members recently dedicated their new 
$3 million building.  The "world's largest gay and lesbian church," 
pastored by Michael Piazza, says it hopes to expand its ministries to 
include a nursing home for aging homosexuals, a wellness center, a 
retreat for gay teens, a soup kitchen for the homeless, and a 
television ministry to counter conservative religious peoples' views 
against homosexuality.  The Washington, D.C., MCC also recently moved 
into new quarters. 

The Assembly of God's Division of Foreign Missions, along with African 
seminary students, created Edward Elephant to help fight the spread of 
AIDS among Africa's 300 million children under 15.  International 
health officials estimate that by 2000 Africa will have 10 million AIDS 
orphans, and 25 million African adults will be infected, 63% of all 
world-wide cases.  Edward stars in a comic book, written at an 
elementary school level, that defines AIDS, describes how it is spread, 
and teaches how a Christian lifestyle can help young people and their 
parents avoid contracting the disease. 

Pope John Paul II proclaimed March 13 as the first annual World Day of 
the Sick.  His letter to the church describes the event "as an intense 
moment of prayer, sharing, [and] offering suffering for the good of the 
Church."  He also called everyone to see Christ in the faces of the 
sick, since Jesus' suffering, death, and resurrection "carried out the 
salvation of humanity."  The pontiff hoped Christians will renew their 
commitments to caring for those who are ill or in pain. 

S.L. Alexander, Catholic bishop of Peshawar, Pakistan, was released by 
four unidentified gunmen who abducted him six days earlier.  He was 
returned to his home on the cathedral's grounds by rickshaw, 
international news accounts said. An anonymous caller had demanded 6.5 
million rupees, about $250,000, but church officials refused to pay 
ransom.  As the caller had promised Alexander's family, he was 
well-treated and was given medication for his heart conditions and 
diabetes. Alexander, the bishop of Peshawar since 1990, was the second 
clergyman to be kidnapped in two years. 
...More than 6,000 Muslim rioters, coaxed by Islamic mullahs, beat an 
elderly parish priest, and damaged his church and its Christian high 
school.  News Network International said the crowd justified its attack 
by claiming that Keamari's Sacred Heart Church housed a Hindu temple.  
The church has a large, visible cross on its roof. 

A Pakistani man who claimed to be Jesus must die for his blasphemy, a 
judge ruled.  Arshad Javed was sentenced under a law that mandates 
capital punishment (NIRR 7/27/92) in cases of blasphemy or contempt 
against Muslim prophets, including Christ.  Javed additionally was 
sentenced to three years in prison for sympathizing with Salman Rushdie 
and his The Satanic Verses, which still is banned in the country.  Of 
the people sentenced to death in Pakistan under sections 294 and 295 of 
the Penal Code, none has yet been executed, secular news sources said. 
...A Christian in Karachi, Pakistan, was "acquitted with honor" of 
blasphemy charges.  Chand Barkat was imprisoned without bail for 15 
months after a rival shopkeeper accused him of defaming the prophet 
Muhammad.  Barkat's attorney said the prosecution had no substantiation 
for the claim, according to the judge, and supported Barkat's 
allegation that his competitor used the law solely for financial gain.  
Barkat's lawyer will countersue the plaintiff for lost wages and legal 
costs, and the state could file charges for malicious prosecution, NNI 
reported. 
...Best known of the Pakistani victims of the blasphemy law is 
Presbyterian prisoner Gul Masih, who has been held without bail since 
December 1991.  When Masih first was accused, life imprisonment was the 
sentence.  Despite only one witness to his alleged slander against 
Muhammad and his multiple wives, Masih was sentenced to hang last 
November (NIRR 11/16/92).  Masih, whose name means Messiah in Urdu, has 
been refused visits from his family and a Roman Catholic bishop.  
Efforts are mounting to protest Masih's death sentence as the scheduled 
time of his appeal has passed. Amnesty International has called his 
case "urgent," and the interdenominational Ecclesia church, of Duluth, 
Minn., has urged human rights protesters to contact U.S. officials. 
...In a show of solidarity and support, several hundred Christians are 
protesting Pakistan's blasphemy laws.  The Pakistani-American Christian 
Organization, based in Philadelphia, has led two demonstrations in 
front of the Pakistani embassy and the White House.  Joining PACO 
members in the second march were African-American and white 
evangelicals, as well as American-Egyptian Christians.  The 
demonstrators said that more than 200 Christians and converts from 
Islam have been arrested under the new law, and some have been killed.  
Among them were a wheel-chair-bound invalid prisoner who may have been 
poisoned, and a Christian school teacher who was publicly stabbed to 
death.  In addition, Christian churches in Pakistan are often targets 
for destruction.  The protesters call for the United States to stop 
financial support to Islamic countries that deny religious and civil 
rights to Christians. 
...To counteract the blasphemy death mandate, Pakistan's National 
Assembly proposed the Anti-Sectarianism Act. If ratified, violators 
could face five-year prison sentences or fines.  Among the offenses 
included under the legislation are encouraging hatred toward different 
religious groups; inciting anger or passion against minority faiths; 
acting or bearing arms on behalf of one sect against another; seeking 
support or funding from outside sectarian groups; and even indirectly 
outraging the religious feelings of a person or class with words, 
pictures, or actions.  Sectarianism, the bill says, is "against Islamic 
injunctions, public order, and morality" as a "religion of love, mercy, 
and tolerance."  Of Pakistan's 100 million inhabitants, only about 3% 
are Christian, with the majority overwhelmingly Muslim. 

A Pakistani woman convicted of adultery may be stoned to death when she 
completes a five-year sentence of rigorous imprisonment.  Nasreen Bibi 
was found guilty of marrying a second husband after separating from, 
but not divorcing, her first husband, who leveled the charges against 
her.  Bibi's second husband, also found guilty, was sentenced to 100 
lashes. The last time a stoning sentence was passed, in the 1980s on 
another woman, a court commuted the punishment because of local and 
international outcries of human rights violations, according to 
Pakistani news accounts. 

"No month during the last 20 years has passed without the murder, 
beating, or torture of Christians, or without their properties or 
churches being burned," the American Coptic Association/Christians of 
Egypt wrote President Clinton.  "In all cases without exception, the 
criminals have been set free."  The letter detailed the plight of 11 
million Coptic Christians under a "conspiracy by Muslim fundamentalists 
and Egyptian officials" to destroy them.  The Jersey City, N.J., group 
asked Clinton to make U.S. foreign aid to Egypt conditional on human 
rights reform.  ACA urged supporters to petition members of Congress, 
as well as the president. 

The government of Panama has ordered its troops to halt their search 
for three kidnapped missionaries working near the Colombian border 
(NIRR 2/22).  The painstaking search of the jungle border area turned 
up 50 undocumented aliens, several marijuana fields, and three 
cocaine-processing laboratories, but there was no sign of the missing 
men.  Panamanian officials say the abductors were members of the 
left-wing Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, although a local rebel 
group claimed responsibility.  The government also holds to the theory 
that the captors may have thought the Bible teachers were anti-drug 
agents.  Dean Hinton, U.S. ambassador to Panama, said the kidnappers 
requested a $3 million ransom, which officials of both governments 
refuse to pay.  Hinton added that New Tribes Mission officials had 
received claims of responsibility and demands, which were under 
negotiation. 

In the tradition of USA for Africa, World Relief recorded Making a 
World of Difference, a contemporary Christian music single it hopes 
will draw attention to the plight of hungry African children.  
Operation Angel Wings and Word Music and its artists group went into 
action last year after the Gospel Music Association convention.  The We 
Are The World-like song was released Feb. 15, and features Sandi Patti, 
Russ Taff, Ray Bolz, and 42 other Christian artists.  A radio special 
was released in December and the album will come out this month.  World 
Relief, the Wheaton, Ill.-based humanitarian assistance arm of the 
National Association of Evangelicals, hopes to raise at least $1.5 
million for the undernourished in Somalia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and 
other African countries ravaged by drought. 
...And more than 50,000 U.S. young people participated in World 
Vision's annual 30-Hour Famine, raising almost half a million dollars 
for hunger relief in Somalia and other WV project countries.  The 
Southern California development organization said many teens, in 
addition to going without food or drinks other than water or fruit 
juices, spent time in community service activities, such as working 
with homeless shelters, soup kitchens, and graffiti-cleanup. 

Black and white pastors in Virginia have been praying together to find 
creative solutions to community problems, as well as racial and 
denominational barriers in the body of Christ.  Since 1990, the Hampton 
Roads United Christians have some 50 pastors gather on the fourth 
Thursday evening of each month to pray for local needs.  The leadership 
prayer meeting, hosted each month by a different church, has recently 
added a morning three-hour session as a result of growing interest.  
The group plans to develop prayer groups throughout each community in 
the greater Virginia Beach area. Consequently, HRUC has grown to a 
network of 200 churches which work with the city of Norfolk to provide 
youth rallies, block parties, and family picnics for the metro 
community.  City officials told HRUC leaders that "the only thing that 
had any lasting effect on the lives of people was what was done through 
the efforts of the church." 
...HRUC will sponsor a racially integrated evangelistic crusade in 
Norfolk April 25-May 1.  Tony Evans, pastor of Oak Cliff Fellowship in 
Dallas and founder of The Urban Alternative, will team up with John 
Guest, international evangelist and former pastor of St. Stephen's 
Church in Sewickley, Pa.  The 200 churches that comprise the HRUC say 
the crusade will be the largest evangelistic endeavor ever undertaken 
in the area.  Born out of an interracial pastors' prayer group, the 
seven-day Life Focus '93 will "present the Gospel of Jesus Christ to 
persons of all ages and diverse backgrounds -- socially, economically 
and denominationally."  An extensive year-long follow-up program will 
be initiated after the crusade.  Leaders are encouraging all Christians 
and churches in the area to get involved with Life Focus.

Vol. 7, No. 5                                                      
February 22, 1993 

Charles Colson has won the 1993 Templeton Prize for Progress in 
Religion.  The former Watergate convict established Prison Fellowship, 
which operates an outreach ministry to offenders in more than 800 state 
and federal facilities.  Colson said he was driven to his knees, 
humbled, and grateful to Jesus Christ for the honor.  "Only through His 
sovereign power could this be possible."  The prize, valued at 650,000 
pounds sterling (more than $1 million), is the world's largest annual 
award, and the funds, Colson says, will be used to strengthen his 
organization, especially its work with prisoners' families. Colson will 
receive the prize in a private Buckingham Palace ceremony May 12.  A 
public service will be held Sept. 2 at the 100th Parliament of World 
Religions in Chicago.  The honor was established in 1972 by Sir John 
Templeton, a global investment pioneer who thought the Nobel prizes 
should have included religious accomplishment.  Awardees are 
individuals who advance the world's understanding of God or 
spirituality.  Billy Graham, Mother Teresa, and Alexander Solzhenitsyn 
have been among the past recipients. 

Methodist church movements are growing around the world, but not in 
Europe and North America, according to the latest Handbook of 
Information, compiled every five years by the World Methodist Council.  
The WMC, a North Carolinabased association of self-governing Methodist 
churches, includes tallies of its 68 member bodies, as well as other 
united churches.  Over the last 30 years, the church has added 10 
million members across 96 countries, with the greatest gains in Africa, 
Asia, the Pacific, and South and Central America.  Total membership for 
1992 was 29.1 million, up from 19.3 million in 1962.  The WMC also 
estimates that the "sphere of the church's influence" has increased 
from 42.5 million to 60.7 million over the last 30 years. 
...In 1992, Lutherans numbered 58.3 million worldwide, down from 58.7 
million in 1991, the Geneva-based Lutheran World Federation says.  Of 
the LWF's 114 member denominations, 15 have more than 1 million 
members, among them the Church of Sweden with 7.6 million and the 
Evangelical Church in America with 5.2 million.  The only Lutheran 
church not affiliated with LWF with seven-digit membership is the 
2.6-million-member Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod.  Germany, home of 
Martin Luther, boasts the most Lutherans, with 14.8 million in 15 
related denominations. 

Germany's mainline and Catholic churches are losing members at an 
unprecedented rate, according to a German Evangelical Alliance 
Information Service study of 1991 church membership.  About 1% of the 
former West Germany's 25 million Protestant church members have left 
the church, with statistics yet unavailable on the much-less-religious 
former East Germany.  As many Catholics, approximately 140,000, left 
their church as well that year.  Urban churches, especially in the 
state of North Rhine Westphalia, were hit harder by losses than rural 
churches.  Lippe, Bremen, and Berlin, perhaps because of the 
concentration of financially stable, educated young adults, were among 
the areas where the loss rate more than doubled that of 1990. 

Cell groups are spreading in the Episcopal Church, as members are 
joining personal, small prayer and discussion meetings with increasing 
frequency.  Episcopal News Service reported the change is 
revolutionizing the denomination's evangelistic work, according to 
participants at a recent outreach conference.  Influence and leadership 
are shifting from church officials to laity, from male to female, from 
old to young, and from developed countries to developing lands.  Asia, 
South America, and Africa are among the areas where large congregations 
began as one "cell."  Commitment to the church's "Decade of Evangelism" 
campaign is growing because members now see themselves as missionaries, 
whose lifestyles will draw others to Christ.  Among the challenging 
American groups to reach: Asians, Hispanics, blacks, and native 
Americans. 

In his 10th trip to Africa, Pope John Paul II spent eight days vying 
for the soul and the welfare of its people.  Some have called the 
continent the last frontier for conversion, for both Christians and 
Muslims.  Catholicism is growing across Africa, where 92 million 
practice the faith, 35 million more than the pope's last visit in 1980. 
 Catholic officials say the faithful may top 100 million by 2000. 
...The pope rocked the "cradle of voodoo," Benin, by meeting with the 
cult's leaders, whom he urged to consider Christianity.  Voodoo is the 
most popular of Benin's indigenous religions, practiced by 62% of the 
country's 4.5 million people.  Roman Catholics account for about 19% of 
Benin's population, Muslims slightly less, and small, but fast-growing, 
Protestant groups even less.  All are concerned about the mixing of 
their religions with voodoo practices, which does not bother voodoo 
leaders.  One voodoo leader, whose son is becoming a Roman Catholic 
priest, said, "The master of life knows that Vodun has nothing to do 
with the devil or Satan.  It is God who is the final object of the cult 
of Vodun." Although the pontiff sought some common ground, saying that 
both honor their "ancestors in the faith," he stressed that by 
converting they would lose nothing, but would gain "the possibility of 
knowing Jesus Christ."  The pope also met with the country's Islamic 
clerics to urge Muslim-Christian cooperation in "the search for peace." 
 Benin is a struggling republic since its turn to democracy in 1991 
after 17 years under Leninist-Marxist rule.  He also condemned the 
government-opposition violence in Togo, and prayed for the thousands 
who fled to Benin to avoid the civil strife. 
...In his five days in Uganda, the pope addressed huge open-air crowds 
and focused on two main points: political freedom and the AIDS 
epidemic.  The east African republic is still torn by civil strife and 
human-rights abuses, although most experts agree the country has made 
progress since a new government was established in 1986.  Ugandan 
politics were long associated with Idi Amin's atrocities, especially 
against the church and foreigners, which lasted from 1971 until the 
mid-1980s.  Still, about 80% of Ugandans say they are Christians, with 
44% Catholics.  Active party politics are banned, but a new 
constitution and multi-party presidential elections are targeted for 
1994. The pope urged the country's 17 million people to work together, 
despite tribal and ethnic differences, "for the future of Ugandan 
society." 
...Uganda, where as many as one in seven people may be HIV+, needs a 
moral rebirth, the pope said.  Speaking to outdoor crowds of as many as 
200,000, with more than a million in some surrounding areas, he 
stressed that only a resurgence of Christian values, not "safe sex" 
behavior, would stop the spread of the disease.  "The sexual restraint 
of chastity is the only safe and virtuous way to put an end to the 
tragic plague of AIDS," he told the young.  "Without the bond of 
marriage, sexual relations are a lie."  The pope also blessed AIDS 
patients at a hospital, and urged researchers to find a cure regardless 
of the cost.  As he did in 1980, the pope visited shrines to 45 
Anglican and Catholic teen-agers martyred in 1886. The boys, 
missionary-educated pages at the royal court, were burned to death on 
spits for refusing to indulge a Ugandan king's homosexual wishes. 
...A letter smuggled to the pontiff urged him not to be fooled by the 
Sudanese government's red-carpet treatment and officials' welcoming 
handshakes.  It came from Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian, and 
Methodist bishops in the New Sudan Council of Churches.  "You must know 
that they are hands dripping with the blood of Sudanese Christians."  
The letter detailed recent government military actions in the battle 
between the Arab Islamic government of the north against black 
Christian and animist independence rebels in the South. 
..."For me, this visit to Sudan is providential," John Paul II said.  
Although the stop lasted only hours, it was his most outspoken part of 
the trip.  As the Vatican did last October, the pope condemned Sudan 
for its strict enforcement of Islamic law on the whole country.  Of 
Sudan's 26 million people, 70% are Muslim.  The other 6 million are 
split between Christians and animists.  Among the "flagrant violations 
of human rights" were persecution and torture of church workers, 
expulsions of missionaries, and closing of Christian organizations. 
...Sudanese Christians question whether the government's goodwill to 
the church during the pope's visit will last. They say the Khartoum 
junta approved of the visit only to help its image around the world.  
Two jailed priests were released, travel restrictions were relaxed, and 
open-air masses were televised, but church leaders say the current 
kindnesses will be revoked upon the pope's departure, and problems may 
grow worse.  The four-year-old military government repeatedly has 
denied allegations of human rights violations brought by various church 
groups, the United Nations, Amnesty International, the United States, 
and others.  In addition, religious leaders fear that fighting and 
famine will continue in the south, where since 1983 more than 1 million 
have been killed, and 6 million relocated. 
...Between the war and its consequent famine, more than 1 million 
Sudanese risk starvation, relief experts say.  Several hundred thousand 
face immediate needs.  The U.S. State Department says the country is in 
as bad a state as was Somalia before U.N. efforts facilitated passage 
of relief supplies.  Only the stopping of the hostilities will remedy 
the massive nutritional and refugee problems, officials from several 
government and humanitarian groups say. 

A Colombian court said a Roman Catholic Church agreement with the 
government violates the 1991 constitution in part.  The decision, under 
debate since last fall, will prohibit the church from converting 
indigenous peoples, running schools, placing priests in the armed 
forces, and collecting government budget contributions -- all 
traditional church practices for more than 100 years under the 
agreement.  The court said the church will retain spiritual 
independence to receive alms, name priests, and manage Catholic 
cemeteries, and will remain exempt from state taxes.  According to news 
reports, Catholic church officials have rejected the ruling. 

Shining Path guerrillas issued death threats to four priests in 
northern Peru.  The Roman Catholics -- three Italians and one Spaniard 
-- who work among the area's poor, are under police protection, 
according to foreign news reports.  The Maoists historically have 
killed Christians for their condemnation of terrorist actions (NIRR 
9/21/92), and for alleged competition for control in rural and urban 
areas. 

When Bishop Edward MacBurney retires, St. John's will leave the 
Episcopal Church, too.  The Quincy, Ill., congregation says the 
2.2-million-member denomination is too liberal, especially on women's 
ordination.  So when the traditionalist bishop leaves, St. John's will 
join the Texas-based Episcopal Synod of the Americas.  Among the 
separation negotiations will likely be disposition of St. John's 
church, an 1853 national historic landmark. 
...The congregation of St. Mark's Episcopal of Portland says it's their 
property, even though they're leaving the denomination to join the more 
conservative Anglican Church in America.  The Oregon Diocese says that 
it and the Episcopal Church own all parish structures, but St. Mark's 
disagrees, saying that the building was donated by a woman whose 
brother was a founder of traditional Anglicanism, RNS reported. 
...And St. Mark's Episcopal in Springfield, Mass., wants the money.  
The church is suing its diocese for assets from a $100,000 trust fund 
that member William Adams bequeathed in 1939 for parish upkeep.  Since 
Adams' death, St. Mark's says it has received only about $40,000 of the 
$934,000 generated by the fund.  The diocese's lawyer claims that 
Adams' will granted allocation rights specifically to the bishop of 
western Massachusetts, who has maintained St. Mark's as necessary with 
trust funds. 

Jewish officials from around the world have joined with Israel to seek 
restitution from European governments for seizure of Jewish property by 
Nazis and Communists.  Representatives say schools, hospitals, 
synagogues, art works, religious worship items, and other goods were 
confiscated across Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the territories of Yugoslavia, and most of 
the former U.S.S.R.'s republics.  The joint statement calls for the 
return of or compensation for billions of dollars in stolen goods.  The 
parties first sought such restitution, unsuccessfully, from Germany 
following World War II, Reuters reported. 

Britain's two leading churchmen agree: England's coronation oath needs 
revision.  George Carey and John Habgood, Archbishops of Canterbury and 
York, said the Anglican Church needs to consider modernizing its 
connection with the state because of the multi-cultural, multi-faith 
society of Great Britain.  Carey told the BBC that when Queen Elizabeth 
ascended the throne in 1953, England's religious picture was more 
homogenous, but said reform must be carefully considered by lawyers.  
Some critics of the church-state link have questioned whether Prince 
Charles could credibly head a church whose prohibitions against 
adultery he is rumored to flaunt.  But neither Carey nor Habgood favors 
anti-disestablishmentarianism, although a majority of members of 
Parliament told pollsters they do.  Under a revised oath, bishops would 
remain in the House of Lords, politicians could still veto the Synod's 
governing decisions, and the new monarch would continue as the church's 
"supreme governor." 

Reader's Digest and the World Council of Churches are dueling over the 
KGB.  RD fired the first shot this month with "The Gospel According to 
Marx," which alleges that members of the WCC, many of them Russian 
Orthodox priests, were agents for the Soviet secret intelligence force. 
 Author Joseph Harriss, RD's senior editor in Paris, also says the 
ecumenical group financed or supported Marxist movements and ideologies 
in southern Africa, Central America, and former Iron Curtain countries. 
 Harriss cites dissident and Orthodox priest Gleb Yakunin, who 
researched KGB files for a Russian parliamentary study of the 1991 coup 
attempt, as a main information source. 
...But WCC and member groups' officials say the magazine is shooting 
blanks.  They say Harriss' allegations are distorted, unsupported, or 
factually inaccurate.  Much of the February article repeats claims made 
in RD in 1982, which the WCC says it disproved then.  Leaders concede 
that the group's stands may be similar to some Marxist governments' on 
certain issues, but their platforms were decided independently.  In 
addition, the WCC says it worked to stop Yakunin's imprisonment and 
religious persecution, and that RD has been linking mainline Protestant 
groups to leftist causes since 1950.  RD says its piece is "thoroughly 
researched and absolutely correct." 
...Yakunin faces criminal court proceedings for whistleblowing.  Soviet 
supporters in the Ministry of Security recharged the activist with 
revealing state secrets he discovered.  Yakunin and colleague Lev 
Ponomaryev say their study was stopped when Russian Orthodox Church 
leaders complained about the research into the KGB archives.  Yakunin 
says the files implicate church leaders as KGB cooperatives (NIRR 
3/23/92).  Journalists in Russia and Europe published Yakunin's 
findings, which led to charges that were originally dismissed by the 
Russian Prosecutor General.  Yakunin is countersuing for public 
slander, according to the Institute for Religion and Democracy in 
Washington, D.C., who honored the dissident in 1992 and is continuing 
his research into the KGB-Russian Orthodox-WCC connections. 

The Evangelistic Association of New England's annual Congress drew more 
than 7,000 participants from nearly 50 denominations and 300 
congregations.  The Jan. 29-30 event at Boston's Hynes Convention 
Center broke the attendance records, and hundreds were turned away, 
convention officials said.  Six general sessions and keynote speeches 
featured Prison Fellowship's Charles Colson; authors Richard Foster, 
Patsy Clairmont, Elisabeth Elliot, and Crawford Loritts; and radio 
pastor Chuck Smith of Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa, Calif.  Music was 
keyed to the Congress theme, "Let There Be Light," and ranged from 
guitar- and drum-accompanied choruses to organ-backed hymns of the 
faith.  More than 145 workshops focused on evangelism, global outreach 
and social concern, church growth, singleness and family, Christian 
life and character, prayer, Christians in the marketplace, and 
leadership development, as well as other topics related to EANE's 
outreach.  In addition, EANE announced a joint pilot program with 
Prison Fellowship to match young offenders with local mentors.  
"Matchpoint" will be tested in New England before its national 
implementation. 
...But the Congress was not without controversy, as scheduled keynote 
speaker Timothy Johnson, best known as medical editor for ABC News, 
declined his invitation to address the audience on health-care 
measures.  Pastor John Ensor and members of the Dorchester Christian 
Fellowship in Boston, "on behalf of the pro-life community," circulated 
an open letter to Johnson and the EANE.  The letter urged them to 
exercise "moral courage . . . against all things that destroy body and 
soul."  Johnson's stands on abortion and euthanasia are detailed in a 
recent Zondervan book, Let's Talk, a dialogue with C. Everett Koop, 
former U.S. surgeon general.  Johnson says he is "morally opposed to 
abortion, but also philosophically opposed to government restriction of 
free choice and the inevitable discrimination that results."  He also 
said he opposed legalized euthanasia, but would not condemn others who 
support physician-assisted suicide under "very careful guidelines." 
EANE President Stephen Macchia acknowledged that pro-life views were 
not a "litmus test" for participation, and that the group would not 
withdraw its invitation to Johnson, "even when some may not fully agree 
with his views."  Johnson, who also is a lecturer at Harvard Medical 
School, a clinical associate at Massachusetts General Hospital, and an 
associate minister at Peabody's Community Covenant Church, said he 
decided to drop out because he thought it best to douse the controversy 
rather than inflame it. 

TV news anchor Lee Webb was suspended after his comments of liberal 
media bias were printed in a Jacksonville, Fla., newspaper.  Webb told 
attendees of the Christian Coalition Leadership School that the media 
had an "obvious bias" against the religious right.  The article alerted 
WTLV-12 Station Manager Ken Tonning that Webb had not notified the 
station of the speech, and the anchor was suspended.  Tonning said Webb 
complicated matters by requesting "that no one tell the media" of his 
appearance.  Webb says he was only joking, and the crowd chuckled at 
his remarks.  He says he never intended to embarrass his employer, an 
NBC affiliate, nor was his station more biased than any other news 
outlet. WTLV reported hundreds of callers questioned Webb's three-day 
suspension, perceived by most as punishment for expressing his 
opinions.  But Tonning said WTLV values Webb's Christian viewpoint, and 
appreciates his "vocal and visible" community presence. 

Reconstructionist Gary North has been accused of using deceptive 
tactics to spread his Dominion Theology theories. Two Kansas librarians 
reported in the Journal of Information Ethics that several state 
universities have received gift copies of North's books with notes 
saying they were donated by anonymous alumni.  Librarians grew 
suspicious when they found packing slips made out to other Kansas 
colleges, and could not trace the likely donors.  North, head of the 
Institute for Christian Economics in Tyler, Texas, has written on the 
permissibility of using deception in dealing with "degenerates," but 
not with other Christians. 

Dutch troops in Bosnia will receive free Playboy magazines from the 
government.  The Catholic Church is outraged that anyone could even 
consider sending pornography into an area where women have been 
victimized by systematic mass rape as part of Serbian "ethnic 
cleansing" strategies.  In addition, the government announced the 
Defense Ministry will send homoerotic materials to its homosexual 
soldiers. 

Dutch physicians legally can help patients die, as long as they follow 
the rules in the lower parliament's new euthanasia law.  The lawmakers 
voted 91-45 to enact the world's most lenient "mercy-killing" statute.  
At the same time, news accounts said, they guaranteed that the practice 
will be regulated strictly, which it had not been in the past.  
Euthanasia will remain a crime, but medical doctors in the Netherlands 
will avoid prosecution if they 1) assure that the patient is suffering 
a "perpetual, unbearable, and hopeless," although not necessarily 
terminal, condition; 2) witness repeated requests by the patient for 
assisted death; 3) obtain permission from the patient (or a close 
relative in cases of babies or comatose adults); 4) get a second 
opinion; and 5) document for the coroner the circumstances and 
methodology of the act, including a justification for its choice.  
Those who disobey the law could be imprisoned for up to 12 years, and 
removal of life-support from patients considered futile cases will 
remain an accepted practice in Dutch hospitals.  The upper house and 
crown government are expected to approve the measure. 
...It's still a compromise act.  Euthanasia opponents, usually 
supportive of the Christian Reformed and Christian Democrat parties, 
fear the law could lead to a loss of legal protection for human life.  
Supporters, who favor the Labor Party, urge complete decriminalization 
of euthanasia.  Government estimates show 2,300 Dutch people die by 
euthanasia, and 400 by physician-assisted suicide each year, a lower 
figure than they expected.  The 75% of the population who favors a 
right to die say doctors are responsible and unlikely to promote 
state-sanctioned death. 

Both houses of the Polish legislature have approved a draft bill that 
would restrict, but not eliminate, a woman's access to abortion.  
Considered less stringent than earlier proposals, the draft allows for 
abortions in cases of rape, incest, fetal damage, or serious threat to 
the mother's life or health.  Legal penalties would range as high as 
two years imprisonment for those aiding the illegal termination of a 
pregnancy.  The Christian National Alliance party favored an earlier 
unpassed bill that allowed abortion only to save the mother's life.  
Although 90% of Poles claim to be Catholic, most favor some legal 
abortion.  The Senate voted 35-34 with 20 abstentions, following the 
lead of the Sejm, or lower house. President Lech Walesa signed the bill 
into law, although he was said to have favored the earlier draft. 
...Some Poles think the church should play a less political role.  News 
reports say that although many, including members of Solidarity, 
appreciated the church's role in ousting communists, they fear that the 
church's conservatism will dominate Poland's new democratic society.  
In a state-conducted poll, 43% (down from 90% in 1989) rated the 
church's role as positive since the fall of communism, but 30% rated it 
negative.  About 73% said the church in Poland played too great a role; 
only 3% said the church's role was too small. 

A massive search continues in Panama for three U.S. missionaries 
kidnapped from a southeastern jungle village Jan. 31.  David Mankins, 
43, Richard Tenenoff, 36, and Mark Rich, 23, of New Tribes Mission were 
Bible teachers among the Kuna tribe, in Darien Province near the 
Colombian border.  More than 200 Panamanian, Colombian, and U.S. 
military and police officials have covered the area by land and air 
with helicopters, roadblocks, searches, and interrogations, but without 
success. 
...The abductors promised the missionaries' wives and children, "You 
will be hearing from us," and urged them not to worry.  The gunmen, 
whom family members described as very polite and well-organized, asked 
if the captives needed any medications, and promised not to harm them.  
As soon as the men were downriver, the families radioed New Tribes, and 
a pilot evacuated them to Panama City.  The Mankins and Tenenoff 
families had worked among the Puna for more than 10 years, Rich for one 
year. 
...A group of Panamanian guerrillas has claimed responsibility in a 
newspaper statement.  The Torrijist Patriotic Vanguard Group says it 
seized the men because they were agents for the U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency who violated the sovereignty of the "patriots" and 
their colleagues in Colombia.  The captors were thought earlier to be 
left-wing Colombian rebels or drug traffickers who frequent the area.  
Mel Wyman, foreign secretary for the Sanford, Fla., independent 
fundamentalist mission group, said he had not heard anything directly 
from the kidnappers.  The newspaper statement made no demands or 
conditions for the missionaries' release. 

Muslim bandits released two Spanish Roman Catholic nuns who worked 
among lepers in the Southern Philippines. Sister Julia Foraster, 63, 
and Sister Fatima Uribarren, 38, were seized at gunpoint while swimming 
on Jolo island Jan. 17. The kidnappers, thought to be former Moro 
National Liberation Front separatist guerrillas, had demanded a ransom 
of 2 million pesos, about $80,000, which the church refused to pay.  
MNLF separatist rebels helped secure their release, and delivered them 
to safety via the Philippines' regional governor, Libyan ambassador and 
Palestinian envoy. 

The Roman Catholic Church is hindering AIDS containment by protesting 
condom distribution, Philippine health officials said, claiming that 
within five years the country could be in as bad an epidemic state as 
Thailand: half a million infections per year.  But a pastoral letter 
from bishops, read in Catholic churches nationwide, says distribution 
is "tantamount to condoning promiscuity and sexual permissiveness."  
President Fidel Ramos, a Methodist whom many Catholics voted against in 
the elections last May, supports the condom program. 

Affirmation, the United Methodist Church's homosexual caucus, may form 
its own denomination.  Last month the group's 19-member board issued "A 
New Beginning," a resolution decrying the 8.9-million-member 
denomination as "a moribund institution drained by its idolatry of 
heterosexual norms."  Affirmation disapproves of the UMC's refusal to 
ordain gays and lesbians, and strongly disapproves of plans to hold the 
1996 denominational legislative meeting, the General Conference, in 
Colorado, despite a tourism boycott by many homosexual rights 
supporters. 

Abortion protesters in Philadelphia risk jail terms and fines for 
blocking clinic access under a new ordinance.  Peaceful demonstrations 
and literature distribution are not limited by the new law, but 
blockades carry mandatory punishment, with fines as high as $300 and 
jail terms up to three months long.  News services said that Mayor Ed 
Rendell has promised to sign the bill as soon as city council forwards 
it. 
...And Pennsylvania may follow.  State representative Ellen Harley, a 
pro-choice Republican, has proposed a bill to make it illegal for 
"fanatics" to physically detain, obstruct, impede, or hinder 
individuals from entering medical facilities. Violations would carry 
mandatory fines up to $1,000 or three months in jail for a first 
offense.  Further offenses would carry higher penalties, news services 
reported. 

If a new House bill is passed, federal judges could enjoin 
anti-abortion protesters from blockading clinic entrances. The proposed 
legislation would make preventing or blocking access to a clinic a 
federal crime against which injunctions could be issued.  Clinics, 
staffers, and potential clients could sue blockaders under civil law as 
well.  Connie Morella (RMd.) says the legislation would not curb 
protesters' free speech; it would allow the government, as co-sponsor 
Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) says, to move against "acts of violence 
against those who have made other choices."  The bill is proposed to 
counter the Supreme Court ruling that pro-life groups like Operation 
Rescue cannot be prosecuted under RICO Acts as is organized crime (NIRR 
1/25).  Schumer says he expects the bill to pass both houses before 
summer. 

If hairstyle choice is a fundamental right in Alaska, so is a late-term 
abortion.  That's the gist of Superior Court Judge Dana Fabe's decision 
to lift Valley Hospital's three-month-old ban against performing 
second-trimester abortions.  State law requires that abortions after 
the 12th week of gestation be performed at a hospital.  Opponents of 
hospital policy said the ban forced women to travel out-of-state if 
they decided to abort that late.  Since Valley Hospital is publicly 
funded, the judge said, it must abide by the state constitution.  A 
1972 state Supreme Court ruling said schools could not dictate the 
length of male students' hair, which the judge implied was a more 
trivial decision than abortion. 

Justice Harry Blackmun says abortion should not be a "litmus test" for 
selecting new members of the Supreme Court.  EP News reported that 
Blackmun met with President Clinton at the pre-inaugural Renaissance 
Weekend in Hilton Head, S.C., and urged him not to focus on single 
issues.  Clinton has said he would nominate only pro-choice judges. 
Instead, the justice said, the president should work on selecting "good 
judges, people with integrity and judgment." Blackmun, who authored the 
1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion, told the Minnesota State 
Bar Association that "the votes are there" to overturn the landmark 
ruling. 

Awaiting a court decision on Colorado's Amendment 2, the mountain 
resort of Telluride passed an ordinance outlawing discrimination in 
housing, employment, and public services based on sexual orientation.  
Approved 484-151, the measure's penalties include maximum 90-day jail 
terms or $300 fines for violations.  If Amendment 2 is ruled 
constitutional, the Telluride city law will be nullified. 

The New York state assembly passed 90-50 a bill preventing 
discrimination in housing, employment, and public accommodations on the 
basis of sexual orientation.  Gay rights advocates have been trying to 
pass like measures for 23 years, and did so in the Democrat-controlled 
assembly.  Although the Republican-ruled Senate may not pass the 
measure this year, there is hope for the future, according to Kevin 
Cathcart, executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education 
Fund, a homosexual-rights group.  Cathcart did not expect the bill to 
take another 23 years to become law.  The law would not affect 
religious organizations' hiring practices, nor would it legalize 
homosexual marriages.  New York joins Massachusetts, Vermont, 
Connecticut, New Jersey and three other states passing such laws. 
...A state representative has filed a bill to legalize same-sex 
marriages in Texas.  Glen Maxey, an Austin Democrat who is the 
legislature's only self-avowed homosexual, says he does not expect the 
bill to pass the conservative body, and that the proposed law would not 
affect traditional religious marriages.  Maxey says he "hopes to begin 
debate in a rational matter" because gays and lesbians want their 
issues discussed. 

Come July, New York City School Chancellor Joseph Fernandez will be out 
of his job.  After hours of speeches from the chancellor's admirers and 
critics, the Board of Education voted 4-3 not to renew his contract as 
head of the nation's largest public school system.  For three years 
Fernandez, 57, advocated principal-teacher competency and supported 
condom distribution in high schools.  But he was most embroiled in 
controversy over the elementary-level "Children of the Rainbow" 
curriculum designed to teach tolerance of homosexuals.  Among 
recommended readings for first-graders were Heather Has Two Mommies, 
Gloria Goes to Gay Pride, and Daddy's Roommate, all of which present 
homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle in a multicultural society.  
News stories said many parents, led by Catholics and other 
conservatives in District 24 in Queens, objected to sexual preference 
being treated as a cultural difference.  Others objected to public 
schools teaching what they considered religious beliefs on morality.  
Still others thought the training should begin at a later age. 
Fernandez, backed by homosexual advocacy groups and some educational 
experts, maintained that to stop future hate crimes and gay-bashing, 
children needed to be taught early to respect all people's rights.  The 
board can reverse its ruling any time before the chancellor's contract 
expires, and Mayor David Dinkins may restructure the board to include 
11 members, with six new appointees of his choosing. 

AIDS will have little impact on most Americans, despite its touting as 
the epidemic of the future.  The National Research Council, an advice 
arm of the National Academy of Sciences, said AIDS is different from 
historic epidemics like the bubonic plague, which directly affected all 
segments of society.  Because it is concentrated among the "socially 
invisible" - namely homosexual men, drug users, the undereducated, and 
the poor -- it will "disappear" from the "sight and attention of the 
majority population."  Part of the NRC study considered how AIDS 
impacts social structures, including religion. Although the study found 
many church groups aid and support HIV+ patients, some religious 
organizations' doctrinal stands on sexuality "prevent the faithful from 
engaging in an active program of compassionate care." 

A bomb threat against a billboard featuring two lesbians has forced its 
removal.  The San Jose, Calif., billboard read "Another Traditional 
Family" and showed a San Francisco interracial couple, one of whom was 
pregnant.  It was one of 22 highway ads that the Gay and Lesbian 
Alliance Against Defamation placed around the state.  GLAAD's media 
company has received complaints about nine other billboards in northern 
California, but no specified threats until this one. 

Jesus can't hang around in the hallway at Bloomingdale High School 
after March 1, ruled U.S. District Judge Benjamin Gibson (NIRR 
11/16/92).  The print of Warner Sallman's "Head of Christ," which had 
hung in the school since it opened in 1962, was decided to be an 
endorsement of religion, violating the First Amendment's establishment 
clause.  The suit was brought by the ACLU on behalf of student Eric 
Pensinger.  The Van Buren County, Mich., school district, which 
defended the picture as historical and an exercise in status quo and 
"benevolent neutrality," may yet appeal. 

Conservative students at the University of California can get a rebate 
on mandatory activity fees.  The state Supreme Court ruled that the 
school violated students' rights by funding political groups they 
opposed on ideological grounds.  The complaints were first raised in 
1979 by Berkeley campus students who disapproved of student government 
funding of the Young Spartacus League, a socialist group.  A 
conservative advocacy non-profit group, the Pacific Legal Foundation, 
supported the students' efforts to refund the percentage of the fee 
used against their wills. 
...And seven students on the Davis campus don't want their fees 
financing abortions.  Their suit against the university's regents 
alleges their constitutional rights were violated when the school used 
their monies to support activities they oppose on religious grounds.  
One student litigant, Gregory Goehring, says he and 180 UCD students 
petitioned the college board over its funding policies.  Among the 
opposed causes benefiting from mandatory student activity fees are the 
student health insurance program, which pays for student abortions; the 
Women's Research and Resources Center, which advocates abortion rights; 
the Experimental College, which offers Eastern religion-New Age 
courses; and the Third World Forum newspaper, which the students call a 
propaganda tool for the radical left, homosexual-rights advocates, and 
political correctness, the Southern California Christian Times 
reported. 

School prayer supporters in Congress have proposed four measures that 
could reinstate the practice.  Rep. Bill Emerson (R-Mo.) introduced a 
constitutional amendment that would leave the decision on prayer at 
public school ceremonies and voluntary student prayer to local 
communities.  Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) introduced for the fifth 
time his proposal to overturn the 1962 Supreme Court ruling on grounds 
that it "too broadly interpreted" the First Amendment establishment 
clause.  And two House resolutions would give congressional support to 
observances of moments of silence in public schools.  None of the 
measures would mandate student participation or allow states to 
prescribe prayers, news sources reported.  John Danforth, Republican 
senator from Missouri, is going back to church.  The three-term 
moderate announced that he will not seek another term in 1994.  "Thirty 
years ago I made a commitment to the ordained ministry of the church, 
which I have not adequately fulfilled."  Danforth, an Episcopal priest, 
has spoken to Missouri Bishop Hays Rockwell about possibilities.  He 
served as an assistant chaplain and an assistant and associate rector 
at churches in New York and Missouri before his political career.  He 
also expressed an interest in returning to law practice. 

Was the Coast Guard being politically correct with the last-minute 
cancellation of its annual headquarters prayer breakfast Feb. 9?  The 
Family Research Council's Gary Bauer says yes.  Homosexual Congressman 
Gerry Studds (D-Mass.) is said to have pressured Coast Guard Commandant 
J. William Kime to remove the Reagan domestic policy adviser as the 
featured speaker.  Studds, chairman of the Merchant Marine and 
Fisheries Committee that oversees the Coast Guard budget, reportedly 
told Kime that Bauer should not be "given a pulpit for a right-wing 
ideologue to vent his political agenda" at the breakfast for which 300 
tickets had been sold.  Studds' chief of staff said the congressman did 
not pressure or threaten Kime, but that he simply brought Bauer's views 
to the admiral's attention.  Christian groups and congressional leaders 
are incensed at the silencing.  Bauer, claiming the cancellation was "a 
clear case of censorship," had planned to speak on maintaining a 
vibrant family life amid the pressures of Washington life.  An 
outspoken opponent of lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military, 
Bauer has filed a Freedom of Information request for notes of Studds' 
telephone call to Kime. The Coast Guard gave headquarters staffers two 
hours off to attend another prayer breakfast. 

President Clinton, at the 41st annual National Prayer Breakfast,  
stressed the importance of asking God's help.  At the Feb. 4 meeting, 
he reminded the 3,000 political, military and religious leaders in the 
Washington Hilton's ballroom and 1,000 more watching on closed-circuit 
TV that he, too, was a sinner and a human being who needed their 
religious support. "I ask that your prayer for me will be that God will 
help us to have the strength to define ourselves . . . the hope it 
takes never to give up, the determination it takes always to make 
progress," he said.  Among the audience were representatives from all 
50 states, as well as more than 500 representatives, many of them 
foreign ambassadors, from more than 150 nations across five continents. 
...The breakfast opened with a prayer from Senate Chaplain Richard 
Halverson, who, still ailing, fought his recent illnesses to attend.  
The principal speaker was Billy Graham, who remembered an earlier 
breakfast when the late Catholic Archbishop Fulton Sheen had made the 
same point Clinton did: all are sinners -- the president, the vice 
president, senators, congressmen, and even the bishop himself.  Graham 
reminded the audience that within 100 years they would all have died, 
but said "it's only through faith in Jesus Christ that we shall have 
eternal life."  Graham told the dignitaries that God can do three 
things that science can't: restore souls, meet man's wants and "deliver 
us from death." 
...Clinton said his need for prayer overwhelmed him when he took the 
oath of office.  He said he rehearsed the phrases so he could say them 
with the dignity of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Roosevelt, and 
Kennedy, and that he wanted to deliver that final phrase, "So help me 
God," to resound with all the strength at his command.  "And, I did," 
the president said, "but deep down inside I wanted to say it the way I 
was thinking it: So . . . help me, God!"  A quiet revolution of urban 
ministries has developed into a national network.  The Chicago-based 
Christian Community Development Association includes 160 urban church 
and parachurch ministries in 75 cities across 30 states, and has 
tripled its membership since its inception in 1989.  The CCDA was 
founded in Jackson, Miss., by long-time Christian community leader, 
John Perkins.  Most members have adopted his philosophy of urban 
ministry, which includes three main points: reconciliation (often 
racial) of people to each other and to God; redistribution of resources 
and talents to promote justice; and relocation of ministries and homes 
to low-income, urban neighborhoods to reflect an incarnational missions 
approach.  CCDA officials say they are pleased with the group's 
progress toward fulfilling its purposes.  The coalition is racially 
diverse, represented by even numbers of whites and people of color 
across its individual and organizational membership.  The group links 
its supporters with other individuals and helping services that agree 
with CCDA goals.  The network will hold its fifth annual conference 
this October in its birthplace where it hopes to draw more than 1,000 
urban ministry representatives. 
...Black churches are investing financially in their communities by 
starting businesses, according to the Wall Street Journal.  For 
examples, New Sunny Mount Baptist Church in St. Louis began a bus 
rental company that created 15 jobs for its struggling locale.  
Chicago's Christ Universal Temple owns a large banquet facility that 
rents to businesses and schools. In Denver, Here's Love Christian 
Fellowship has developed the Community Housing Outreach to provide low- 
income housing for its members and neighbors, as well as at least five 
jobs.  Greater Christ Temple Church, in Meridian, Miss., purchased a 
supermarket, and owns a 4,000-acre farm including meat processing 
plants, bakery, restaurants, and an auto repair shop.  Most of its 
members have avoided welfare because of their church-business jobs. 

The Evangelical Covenant Church has a new vision for multi-cultural 
urban ministry.  The 91,000-member denomination reports an overall 
spirit of repentance and recommitment, combined with intensive and 
extensive research, will allow the ECC to develop its strategies for 
inner-city evangelism, service, and justice ministries. 
...ECC President Paul Larsen called together administrators and urban 
outreach leaders in a "Consultation on City Ministry."  The committee's 
findings, combined with two years of special study group results, will 
culminate in this year's annual meeting.  Raymond Bakke, director of 
International Urban Associates, helped lead the Consultation 
participants to interact with the six "study-action" groups on areas 
for future improvement: 1) city evangelism strategy; 2) service and 
justice ministries; 3) church planting; 4) increasing the vitality in 
existing urban churches; 5) training models for city ministries; and 6) 
structure and leadership.  This month's follow-up session to the 
consultation re-affirmed and clarified the key administrative 
recommendations, designed to reach every ECC body, and to enhance the 
abilities of all 620 churches to design ministries appropriate to their 
own locales and changing times. 
...Covenant's early history was immigrant-oriented, and in recent 
decades has focused on suburban and urban ministries, including the 
addition of a few dozen ethnic congregations.  ECC church growth 
leaders want to increase their holistic inner-city ministry, without 
sacrificing their historical "town and country" approach.  They plan to 
implement the steps suggested by the Consultation, as well as expand 
the role of the denomination's Chicago North Park College and Seminary 
as an urban mission leadership training center.  The ECC hopes that by 
adding ethnic members to denominational missions and administrative 
boards it will be better equipped for inner-city evangelism and 
ministry. 

Georgina Dufoix, former French cabinet minister, has accepted Christ as 
savior, says Robert Evans, founder of Greater Europe Mission.  Dufoix, 
minister of Social Affairs in the 1980s, was indicted for distributing 
HIV-contaminated blood products to hemophiliacs.  More than 3,000 were 
infected with the virus and hundreds later died of AIDS-related 
illnesses. A close friend and key adviser of President Francois 
Mitterand, Dufoix also headed France's Red Cross, but lost the posts in 
1992 after failing to report that she allowed PLO leader George Habash 
to seek medical treatment in the country.  Some French Christian 
leaders believe her personal and professional problems led her to 
convert.  Pastors and American missionaries near Paris have counseled 
her about her new life as a believer, and the press has reported her 
change of heart.  Dufoix still awaits trial on the bad blood charges. 

...The Southern Baptist President and the United Methodist First Lady 
are worshipping together of late, a reversal of their usual 
Sunday-morning practices (NIRR 10/5/92). The Clintons attended a 
special anniversary service for the pastor of St. John's Episcopal 
Church near the White House one week, and First Baptist Church of the 
City of Washington the next.  But daughter Chelsea, who usually attends 
church with her mother, has not yet been seen leaving either service 
with her parents. 

Rastafarian culture has gone pop, but its religious punch has fizzled, 
say those who wish it were otherwise.  Their home base is Jamaica, 
where in the 1800s Marcus Garvey first urged redemption of black 
peoples with the back-to-Africa movement.  Devout followers believe 
their savior is the late Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie, who was 
baptized as Ras Tafari Makonnen.  Few who call themselves Rastas today 
are that resolute.  Many follow Rasta customs: dreadlock hairstyles, 
Bob Marley's reggae music, smoking marijuana; but few accept Selassie's 
deity.  To remedy the problem, some zealous believers will try to 
republish several 1930s texts, as well as a new "Rastafarian Bible," 
news reports said. 

Looking for a new editor: the Catholic Register, a Canadian weekly 
newspaper.  The Archdiocese of Toronto has accepted the resignation it 
urged from Carl Matthews, the Jesuit priest who also served as 
publisher.  Matthews printed an editorial urging followers to vote yes 
on the constitutional amendment package in last fall's referendum.  
Officials for the church maintain that it has no right to suggest 
political stands.  Matthews, who apologized for his "embarrassing" 
actions, will leave at the end of February, after completing the issue 
celebrating the paper's centennial. 

The Mormon church is pulling the TV drama Picket Fences from the 
Friday-night lineup on two church-owned stations in Salt Lake City and 
Seattle.  The CBS affiliates pre-empted the Jan. 22 show because 
station managers objected to a Mormon characters' defense of polygamy.  
David Kelley, the show's creator and executive producer, says the judge 
in that episode made it clear that the church outlawed the practice a 
century ago, and that the program dealt with family values.  Other 
episodes objectionable to station officials featured teen orgasms and 
euthanasia, news reports said. 

"Why does a church service have to start at 11 a.m. and last for an 
hour or more?" asked First American Baptist Church pastor Thaine Ford.  
His "Compact Mini 22-Minute Worship Service" will begin in the 
Pensacola, Fla. church at 8:00, and will include two-hymns, Scripture 
reading, prayer, offering collection, and an eight-minute sermonette.  
"There's no room in this service for a long-winded preacher," Ford 
said. 

Hindu priests are hailing a two-month-old baby as Ganesh incarnate.  
The child, reported to have a long nose, no upper lip, and two 
protruding teeth, supposedly resembles the elephant-headed god of 
wisdom.  The baby was born in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar, in 
northern India, according to international news reports. 

Intellectual property or intellectual access?  The Dead Sea Scrolls' 
copyright is an issue an Israeli court will soon decide.  Elisha 
Quimron is suing the Biblical Archaeological Society for publishing 
pictures of a section of the scrolls that he reconstructed using a 
number of fragments.  BAS did not secure his permission nor credit him 
for his work, he says. Attorneys for BAS maintain that Quimron cannot 
copyright a reconstructed text that he did not originally write.  To do 
so sets up "a terrible obstacle to scholarship," said BAS president 
Hershel Shanks.  Others opposing Qimron's copyright say it would allow 
a small group of experts to withhold the scrolls from public view, a 
point one legal expert said the court would probably consider.  
Quimron's attorneys will defend his copyright of "a critical edition of 
the Dead Sea Scrolls . . . because of the creativity and judgment he 
exercised while filling in the blanks."  BAS has countersued in 
Philadelphia, but both sides agree that the Israeli court ruling will 
likely stand as precedent. 

Deaths:  The Venerable Bhaddanta Vicittabi Vumsa, a senior Buddhist 
monk listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for memorizing 16,000 
pages of canonical texts, died after a short time of very poor health 
at the age of 81. Sa'd El-Deen al -Alami, the Mufti of Jerusalem since 
1954, died of heart failure at age 82.  He was Islam's highest ranking 
official on the occupied West Bank. 

Carnivals and condoms: the Mexican government distributed 60,000 free 
condoms and is setting up information booths in hopes of curbing AIDS 
transmission during Veracruz' nine-day-long carnival celebration.  
Mexico City's El Universal reported that the festivities draw large 
numbers of "homosexuals, prostitutes, and low-life people." 
...For Cologne, Germany's Carnival, taxi drivers dispensed colorful 
condoms and AIDS prevention booklets to their fares for the city.  The 
largely Catholic city's hotline is busy constantly after Carnival with 
callers concerned about unprotected sex. 

Sandi Patti said it was time "to tell the story" of her sexual abuse as 
a child.  The gospel singer told Christian magazine editors in 
Nashville that she was abused by a female friend of the family with 
whom she stayed as a six-year-old while her parents were on a gospel 
tour.  "I woke up and she was touching me in a very inappropriate way," 
Patti recalled. She said she was victimized by feelings that made her 
feel she'd done "something wrong" and that she was "at fault," 
according to USA Today. 

--VERSION 2/ 5 lines--  This is the length we've usually run, but they 
weren't big name evangelicals. Charles Colson has won the 1993 
Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion.  The former Watergate convict 
and Prison Fellowship founder said he was driven to his knees, humbled, 
and grateful to Jesus Christ for the honor.  The prize money, 650,000 
pounds sterling (more than $1 million), will fund and strengthen PF's 
work with prisoners' families, Colson said. He will receive the prize 
in a private Buckingham Palace ceremony May 12.  A public service will 
be held Sept. 2 at the 100th Parliament of World Religions in Chicago. 

Several Roman Catholic priests and brothers in Wisconsin are afraid to 
hug children in fears their actions could be construed as sexual.  
Recent clergy abuse cases involving children are the cause, they told 
the Milwaukee Sentinel. Professional groups have urged the priests not 
to touch children, even in church services or sacramental settings.

Vol. 7, No. 4                                                        
February 8, 1993 

Russia is slipping "toward authoritarianism" as 51% now want a strong 
leader rather than a democracy, preferred by 31% in a new opinion 
survey.  "The Russians Rethink Democracy," by the Times Mirror Center 
for the People and the Press in Washington, D.C., shows a virtual 
reversal of the figures from its poll 17 months ago.  Focus groups 
reveal a "growing disillusionment" and "declining interest in 
politics."  Citizens say they feel no more empowered than they did 
under Soviet rule, but President Boris Yeltsin remains popular with a 
54% approval rating. 

Christian ministries entering Russia should be warned to "expect 
continued attempts to increase scrutiny and regulation of Western 
Christian organizations active in Russia," according to Washington 
attorney Lauren Homer of Gammon and Grange, a law firm specializing in 
non-profit organizations' needs (NIRR 11/2/92).  Homer said a December 
trip to Russia showed "extremely troubling" political developments, as 
Yeltsin was nearly stripped of all authority by the Congress of 
People's Deputies under an obsolete, Soviet-era constitution that gives 
the group the right to nullify presidential decisions.  Due to further 
uncertainties, Homer advises organizations interested in registration 
to move quickly.  Ministries with papers already filed or approved, she 
says, should be protected from future legal changes or restrictions. 

1992's Pastor of the Year is Christopher Thomas, founder of Harvester 
Ministries, an inner-city youth work in Charleston, S.C.  The new 
annual contest was sponsored by Williamsport, Pa.-based Under His Wing 
Ministries to encourage and reward pastors for their often unrecognized 
work.  Thomas, a former Gulf War pilot, was chosen from hundreds of 
nominees, who each received a personal thank-you letter and 
certificate, said UHW founder Jerry Frear.  Thomas said his desire was 
simply to do what the Lord wanted him to do.  Under His Wing will take 
nominations this spring for a Missionary of the Year award, and is 
planning a national Pastor's Appreciation Day for Oct. 10. 

Donald Wildmon is none too pleased with the distribution of "Damned in 
the U.S.A.," a British documentary opposing artistic censorship by 
religious and political conservatives.  Wildmon, founder of the 
American Family Association, had been interviewed by producer Jonathan 
Stack, who juxtaposed the footage with what Wildmon called "hardcore 
sex acts and anti-Christian imagery."  To prevent U.S. screenings, the 
United Methodist minister sued Berwick Universal Pictures of London, 
charging that it violated a contract when it "incorporate[d] my 
interview -- against my will -- with the very graphic images I oppose." 
 The year-long legal struggle ended when Fifth Circuit Court in New 
Orleans denied Wildmon's appeals and approved the film for U.S. 
release. The film's Washington debut followed an "un-banning" 
celebration featuring Stack, Jeff Cohen of Fairness & Accuracy in 
Reporting, and poet Allen Ginsberg. 

After a war of words over women in the priesthood, Episcopal Bishop 
nominee Jack Iker wants to get along with his more-liberal detractors 
in the Fort Worth diocese he will likely head.  "The essence of the 
Christian faith is that of reconciliation," the Sarasota, Fla., 
minister said, adding that full agreement with his views was 
unnecessary.  Although a majority of U.S. bishops must approve his 
appointment, church officials say he is likely to be accepted to 
succeed Clarence Pope, who held the same position on women's roles in 
the denomination, Religious News Service reported. 

The defection came as a surprise to Episcopal Church officials as one 
of their most prominent conservative spokesmen switched to the Orthodox 
church.  Gary MathewesGreen, pastor of St. Peter's Episcopal, a 
350-member church in Ellicott City, Md., said he could not stay in a 
denomination where "spiritual and theological chaos and moral confusion 
[run] rampant."  Dissatisfied with the church since 1991, he was one of 
six signatories of the Baltimore Declaration, a dissenting call to the 
denomination to return to its belief in Jesus Christ as the only way to 
God.  The Triennial General Convention in Phoenix -- where he said 
decisions about faith and morals were made on the basis of individual 
experience, not Scripture and tradition -- made him feel that the 
Episcopal Church had lost its soul.  So this Jan. 30, Mathewes-Green 
was "chrismated," the Orthodox equivalent of confirmed, with his wife 
and 19 other former Episcopalians.  Antiochan Orthodox Bishop Antoun of 
Englewood, N.J., consecrated Mathewes-Green into the priesthood, in 
which he took the name Father Gregory, after an Orthodox saint.  His 
wife, Frederica Mathewes-Green, communications director of Feminists 
for Life, says she, too, is "thrilled" to be involved with Orthodoxy, a 
denomination opposing abortion.  Holy Cross Orthodox, Father Gregory's 
new church, is meeting in Catonsville at St. Timothy's Episcopal, a 
charismatic-evangelical church, (with its rector's blessing) until a 
new building is completed. 
...The Episcopal Church can expect more defections, says Peter 
Gillquist, evangelism chairman for the 225,000-member Antiochan 
Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America.  He receives more and 
more inquiries from Episcopal clergy, especially when the church takes 
stands favoring women's ordination.  A former Campus Crusade staff 
member, Gillquist joined the Orthodox Church, headquartered in 
Damascus, Syria, six years ago, as did 2,000 other evangelical and 
charismatic Protestants.  The number of congregations has doubled since 
then.  "Orthodoxy is the biblical and historical core to which 
Catholicism has added a number of things and Protestantism has 
subtracted a number of things," he says, "but Orthodoxy has not changed 
in 1,000 years." 

The 500,000-member United Pentecostal Church is reviving a strict 
holiness code, and expects its 7,500 ministers to recommit or leave.  
Among the conduct code are prohibitions against mixed swimming, 
television, women with short hair or makeup, dancing, worldly 
amusements and sports, immodest dress, theatre attendance, and 
unwholesome music.  Church officials say the code is based on the 
Bible.  Some ministers say they will leave rather than allow an 
ultraconservative denomination to limit their freedom of conscience.  
UPC ministers have 90 days to decide whether to resign or remain. 

Keeping it in the family: Oral Roberts University's new president will 
be the founder's son, Richard Roberts, the Board of Regents decided by 
unanimous vote.  Oral Roberts, after his 75th birthday, announced his 
planned retirement in a chapel service, where he and the regents 
commissioned Richard.  Richard Roberts, an ORU alumnus, was the 
school's executive vice president, handling its administration for the 
last six years, four of which have been plagued with financial 
difficulties (NIRR 12/2/91, 4/6/92).  He will assume the position May 1 
at commencement, with Oral as chancellor. 

Zondervan reportedly bid more than $1 million to secure the rights to 
Dan Quayle's memoirs.  Look for the former vice president's political 
recollections in 1994. Quayle says he has wanted to write this book 
that some may find controversial, but "for most it will set the record 
straight."  An editor has been named, but no collaborator or title as 
of yet.  Thousands of Christian bookstores are expected to be a prime 
market, as the memoirs will focus on Quayle's religious faith and 
Christian conservatism, and will include his perspective on the Murphy 
Brown controversy. 

President Bill Clinton proclaimed Jan. 22 a National Day of Fellowship 
and Hope, signing the declaration just hours after his inauguration.  
Clinton asked for God's guidance and blessings, and said, "The 
president must carry the mantle of hope and optimism in the battle 
against fear and despair."  He also asked for every American's help.  
Citing Martin Luther King and Thomas Jefferson, he called on the public 
"to reflect on their obligations to their fellow Americans and look 
forward to the challenges of the new year with a spirit of hope." 
...Sworn in on a King James version received from his grandmother, the 
president requested that the Bible be opened to Galatians 6:8, "For he 
that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he 
that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting."  
Aides said the Bible was worn around the edges because he carried it to 
weekly church services in Little Rock. 
...Clinton opened his first Cabinet meeting with a prayer of thanks and 
a request: "Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for this unique 
opportunity which has been given us to serve our country to thy ends.  
Please be with us and guide us.  Keep us humble and eager, and help us 
to proceed with wisdom.  Amen." 

"Our vision should be of an America where abortion is safe and legal, 
but rare," Clinton said, signing memoranda rescinding five Reagan-Bush 
directives.  He 1) lifted the Title X "gag rule" restrictions 
preventing federal funding of facilities with non-physician abortion 
counseling or referrals; 2) shed the Mexico City Policy, which 
prohibited federal international development funding to 
non-governmental organizations that provided abortions or abortion 
counseling, or lobbied foreign governments to legalize the practice; 3) 
allowed for privately funded abortions in U.S. military medical 
facilites overseas; 4) ended the moratorium on federal funding for 
fetal tissue research and transplantation using tissue from elective 
abortions (The Senate quickly moved to make it illegal to buy or sell 
fetal tissue, and to force doctors to request permission to use the 
tissue only after a woman had decided to have an abortion.); and 5) 
directed the Food and Drug Administration to study the current import 
ban on RU 486, the French "morning-after" abortion pill. 
...Prayer and mourning were common responses to the 20th anniversary of 
the Roe v. Wade  decision Jan. 22.  The National Pro-Life Religious 
Council, comprised of leading abortion opponents from a wide range of 
religious groups, sponsored its first annual memorial prayer and 
worship service at Bethesda, Md.'s Fourth Presbyterian Church.  Some 
denominations held prayer services Jan. 17, but many groups celebrated 
Sanctity of Human Life Sunday on Jan. 24.  The pro-life Christian 
Action Council in Washington, D.C.,  coordinated the event in which 
Americans prayed for a revived respect for the unborn, the success of 
abortion alternatives, and an end to abortion on demand.  CAC President 
Thomas Glessner urged Christians to get involved with crisis pregnancy 
centers and post-abortion counseling ministries, as well as with 
pregnant women, whose lives are just as important as their unborn 
children's. 
...Anti-abortion protests, some linked to inaugural events, also were 
common.  As promised, Operation Rescue and the Christian Defense 
Coalition were out in force with their "Do Not Mock God" signs during 
the new administration's Washington parade.  ORCDC blockades of three 
abortion clinics led to 307 arrests, but OR President Randall Terry 
said he avoided arrest in order to finalize some outstanding legal 
cases. 
..."Take a look: we didn't die on election day," Nellie Gray, organizer 
of March for Life, told the press.  "We were invigorated."  This year's 
three-hour march began at the White House Ellipse with a rally that 
paraded down Constitution Avenue to the Supreme Court and Capitol.  
Gray said this year's observance was of "very great importance" coming 
on the heels of a pro-choice president's inauguration and the 20th 
anniversary of legalized abortion.  Capitol Police estimated crowd size 
at 75,000, equal to the event's highest total to date, but Gray 
maintained this was the largest crowd ever, with some saying 250,000 
attended.  Only about 100 abortion rights supporters stood near the 
steps of the Supreme Court. 
...Pro-life supporters around the country used a variety of symbols to 
signify their displeasure: day-long bell tollings, tiny models of 
developing fetuses, empty baby carriages, blood-red crosses, baby-sized 
coffins, unhappy birthday posters, singing of "The Battle Hymn of the 
Republic," photographs of aborted fetuses, and newspaper ads quoting 
the Hippocratic Oath's prohibition against abortion. 
...Abortion opponents are concerned about the Freedom of Choice Act, 
which Clinton has agreed to sign upon passage by Congress.  Although 
energized by recent Supreme Court decisions favoring pro-life 
protesters' rights, they say that FOCA could make those victories moot 
by preventing states from enacting abortion restrictions that most 
Americans support.  The National Right To Life Committee has run 
full-page ads in national publications hoping to educate readers about 
FOCA. 
...Pro-choice groups agree that abortions in America should be reduced. 
 The National Abortion Rights Action League and the Planned Parenthood 
Federation of America support efforts to reduce the need for the 
practice, including wider family planning education and prevention, and 
increased emphasis on adoption of children from unplanned pregnancies.  
Both groups applauded Clinton's actions to lift abortion counseling 
restrictions and reinstate federal funding of family planning.  "I feel 
like the president took the White House out of the dinosaur age on this 
issue," according to Pamela Maraldo, PPFA's president, a self-confessed 
Catholic. 

The National Coalition on United Prayer brought nearly 300 Christians 
to their knees to ask God for revival, after spending much of the 
preceding 24 hours praying together.  Leaders and laity of more than 
130 denominations and parachurch ministries gathered in Colorado 
Springs Jan. 21-22 to call for united prayer.  N-CUP '93 convened only 
hours after Clinton was sworn in, and organizer David Bryant of 
Concerts of Prayer International said the meeting inaugurated "a new 
level of spiritual leadership in this land."  That leadership will 
"call the nation to prayer for revival until it is granted."  
Co-organizer Dick Eastman of Every Home for Christ concurred. "We see 
deep significance in the event's timing."  The date was chosen last 
May, at the end of the National Day of Prayer, but, Eastman said, "We 
never realized there would be a whole new administration coming in on 
the same day." 
...N-CUP participants called, as well, for racial reconciliation.  
Francis Frangipane of River of Life Ministries preached on the need for 
white Christians to take the first step in undoing generations of 
racism and distrust.  He asked the few blacks at N-CUP to stand, and 
requested their forgiveness.  Corinthia Boone of Together in Ministry 
International said blacks, too, must repent of their racism and 
bitterness. 
...Eastman, Bryant, missiologist Peter Wagner, Evangelical Free Church 
of America President Paul Cedar, and other participants frequently 
alluded to the moral struggles over abortion and homosexuality, and how 
Clinton's presidency may affect those issues.  "I don't think any 
election has been prayed over more by Christians than this one.  We 
have to believe that God has allowed Bill Clinton to be elected our 
president," said Shirley Dobson, chairwoman of National Day of Prayer.  
Norvel Hadley of Denver's Evangelical Friends Mission said that 
thinking Christians rarely bash the president.  "We're beginning to 
glean that if we pray for him, things will be OK," he said.  
Participants often broke into small groups to pray for each other, 
spiritual renewal, the nation, and the president.  Eastman said he has 
been seeing an unprecedented interest in prayer.  "I've been involved 
in prayer movements for 20 years, and it doesn't begin to compare with 
what's happening today." 

Primed by N-CUP, the North American Conference on Strategic Prayer, 
sponsored by the AD 2000 and Beyond Movement's United Prayer Track, 
addressed pressing missions needs to more than 600 Christian leaders 
Jan. 22-23.  The major focus was the "10/40 Window," a zone that lies 
between the 10th and 40th parallels above the equator, where AD 2000 
says 97% of the world's unchurched population live in 61 of the 
least-evangelized countries.  Since these peoples often are resistant 
to conventional missionary efforts, "praying through the window" is 
essential.  NACSP announced that 260 prayer teams will go to window 
countries over the next few months, culminating in a month-long 
campaign of prayer and fasting this October. 
...Luis Bush, director of AD 2000, said the church has an unparalleled 
opportunity to unite to reach an estimated 2.7 billion people 
practicing Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and other religions antagonistic 
of Christianity.  Sentinel Group researcher George Otis Jr. identified 
what he said are strategic demonic strongholds within the window: "the 
prince of Persia (Iran) and the spirit of Babylon (Iraq)."  Cindy 
Jacobs, founder of Generals of Intercession International, outlined 
prayer strategies for urban ministry.  She said 80% of the world's 
poorest people and the 50 least-evangelized megacities all fall within 
the window, but only 8% of the world's missionaries work among them.  
David Bryant said the "Lone Ranger" approach to world evangelism was 
outmoded, as Christians around the world are joining forces to 
recognize the forces of darkness, and are responding in united prayer 
to "neutralize" them.  Dick Eastman taught how supplemental fasting 
could topple spiritual "strongholds."  Peter Wagner said communities 
outside the church must be united to pray for evangelism, and 
challenged believers to follow Christ's example, saying "now is the 
time" to engage in "serious, front-line spiritual warfare." 

It's unclear who will reign on the St. Patrick's Day Parade in New York 
City.  Mayor David Dinkins and his administration are under attack for 
granting the permit for the annual March 17 parade to a new group that 
promises to include a homosexual IrishAmerican organization.  In doing 
so, the mayor snubbed the Ancient Order of Hiberians, the sponsor of 
the 232-year-old parade for more than 139 years.  AOH's national board 
unanimously decided to call for all members to boycott any parade 
honoring St. Patrick that extols a lifestyle contrary to Catholic 
teachings.  A mass boycott by several groups could effectively cancel 
the march.  Several Irish and Catholic groups have filed lawsuits to 
prohibit the inclusion of gays, as was mandated last year. 
...Cardinal John O'Connor questioned whether St. Patrick's Day was a 
religious celebration or now a political observance.  Often attacked 
for calling homosexuality a sin, O'Connor asked, "Will all other 
parades...which are currently expressions of ethnic or racial pride be 
required to become open forums for political expression?" 
...Boston's annual parade sponsors, however, have denied permission to 
the city's Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Irish Pride Committee.  Also 
refused was a Klan-related group saying it represented skinheads for 
heterosexuality. 

Dolores Street Baptist Church in San Francisco has left the Southern 
Baptist Convention over the denomination's refusal to accept homosexual 
lifestyles.  Two other churches, in Washington and Houston, have left 
for the same reason, but one Indiana church joined the convention for 
its stand on homosexuality, news reports said. 
...And San Francisco's First United Lutheran Church faces expulsion 
from ELCA for naming an avowed homosexual, Jeff Johnson, as its pastor. 
 The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America suspended First United in 
1990 for hiring Johnson (NIRR 1/29/90). 
...Kathleen Buckley has resigned from her ministerial duties at First 
Presbyterian Church of Watervliet, N.Y.  As a monogamous lesbian, 
Buckley said she could no longer serve in the PCUSA because of its 
stance on homosexuality and the Spahr decision. 

Looking for a few gay chaplains: Troy Perry, the Universal Fellowship 
of Metropolitan Community Churches' moderator, has issued a statement 
that the group will renew its efforts to have Pentagon officials accept 
its openly homosexual ministers, RNS reported.  Last October the Armed 
Forces Chaplains Board rejected UFMCC chaplain nominee Dusty Pruitt, a 
lesbian minister who is suing the Army over her dismissal from the 
Reserves in 1983 (NIRR 11/2/92).  The board said it could only consider 
a candidate who was qualified under military policy.  In light of 
Clinton's promises to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military, 
Perry has resubmitted Pruitt's name. 
...Supporting the end of the ban are leaders of several mainline 
denominations and Jewish groups, among them the United Church of 
Christ, the United Methodist Church, the Christian Church (Disciples of 
Christ), the Unitarian Church, and the Union of American Hebrew 
Congregations.  Conservative leaders in some mainline denominations 
side with other denominations and groups, including the Assemblies of 
God, the Southern Baptist Convention and other Baptist denominations, 
the Christian Action Network, and the American Council of Christian 
churches, who protest Clinton's plans. 

A doubled Armed Forces Christian Fellowship has changed its name to 
Military Vision. Based in Englewood, Colo., the new non-profit is a 
coalition of two founding members, the Christian Military Fellowship 
and the Officers' Christian Fellowship (who comprised AFCF), plus two 
new groups, the Association for Christian Conferences, Teaching and 
Service, and the Military Community Youth Ministries (in cooperation 
with Youth for Christ and Young Life).  Although each will remain a 
separate entity with specific objectives, all will work together to 
meet the goals of Military Vision, among them, to cooperate with and to 
complement the work of chaplains in Christian ministry to the whole 
armed forces community; to spread the Gospel; and to instruct and edify 
the body of Christ. 

Alleged political and religious persecutions could lead to violence, 
church officials from southern and eastern Africa warned the Malawi 
government.  More than 20 leaders of the Fellowship of Councils of 
Churches issued a statement after a meeting in Zimbabwe last week.  
They were concerned over the arrest of two priests who campaigned 
against one-party rule, and over the potential torture of Presbyterian 
minister Peter Kaleso, arrested by supporters of strong-man President 
Hastings Kamuzu Banda. 

Churches renting public school facilities cannot be charged higher 
rates than other renters.  Federal District Judge Claude Hilton ruled 
the practice discriminatory and a violation of churches' constitutional 
rights.  The Fairfax (Va.) Covenant Church won a lawsuit alleging 
financial penalization for holding religious meetings.  The school 
district policy charged churches regular rental rates for the first 
five years, but then graduated the rent to as much as five times the 
rate charged secular groups.  Fairfax Covenant estimates that over 11 
years it has been charged $275,000 more than non-religious renters.  
The church will submit a claim for damages. 

On a scale of 0 to 10, church rates an 8.5, the same as sleeping or 
movie-going, says the American's Use of Time Project at the University 
of Maryland, College Park.  The organization surveyed adults to 
determine the degree to which they enjoyed 200 normal activities.  Sex 
tops the list with a 9.3 rating.  Between sex and church are sports/ 
fishing, art/music appreciation, bar/nightclub attendance, hugging and 
kissing, and spending fun time with children.  Americans spend an 
average of 137 minutes of their weekly free time watching TV, but rate 
it only 7.8 for enjoyability; both church and sports average 7 minutes 
each week.  The most unpopular uses of time, rated below 5, are 
housekeeping, tending sick kids, medical appointments, and car repair. 

"Car Care Saturday," the brainchild of Nashville's 2,500-member Belmont 
Church, was designed to meet the needs of the congregation's single 
women, said Jim Davis, administrator of the non-denominational church's 
benevolence ministry.  Each quarter about 40 men perform free routine 
maintenance and safety checks from 9:00 a.m. to noon in a member's 
garage, where in all 10 bays they tend to about 60 automobiles.  "The 
men have really enjoyed the bonding and camaraderie," Davis said, "and 
it's a wonderful outlet for service."  The ministry has developed into 
an outreach to women who are not currently attending church.  Most are 
separated, widows, divorcees, or single mothers who have no one to help 
them recognize potential automotive dangers.  The ministry says it 
often can save the women from costly major repairs. 

Of unchurched American adults, 51% are single, and more than 50% of 
them are over 30, according to a recent Barna Research Group survey.  
More than 90% of all adults consider religion "important," but only 37% 
of the singles attended church within the last week (compared with 55% 
of married adults).  Singles are less likely than married adults to 
think the Christian churches in their areas are relevant to the way 
they live, 71% to 61%.  George Barna says the church cannot lump all 
singles into one category, since they are comprised of three subgroups: 
the never-been-marrieds, or NBMs; the divorced; and the widowed.  Each 
group has its own needs and interests that the church must recognize 
before it can reach them.  For example, 76% of all widowed adults think 
the Bible is the accurate, written word of God, but only 52% of 
divorced adults and 43% of NBMs hold the same opinion.  The 10 
Commandments are "not relevant" (12%) and the idea of sin is "outdated" 
(17%) to more NBMs than divorcees (11%) and widows and widowers (9%).  
And 19% of the divorced adults felt that prayer was powerless to change 
circumstances, compared with 12% of NBMs and 10% of the widowed. 

Deaths: R.H. Edwin Espy, former general secretary of the National 
Council of Churches of Christ and long-time ecumenical leader, died 
after a long illness at age 84. 
...Thomas Dorsey, "the father of gospel music" and author of popular 
hymns including "Precious Lord, Take My Hand," died of Alzheimers 
disease at age 93. 

Angels watching over me?  More than 75% of all teens think so, 
according to a Gallup poll, more than in any other poll since 1978.  
And the percentages climb into the low 80s for female, Catholic, and 
recent-church-attending teens.  Also rising among youth is a belief in 
ghosts, reaching an all-time high of 31%, more than double that of six 
years ago.  Belief in witches averages 19%, and 24% for older teens.  
More than half of teens, 54%, believe in astrology, down 4 points from 
the 1988 high.  Most likely to check their horoscopes are young women 
and Hispanics.  Teen belief in ESP, extrasensory perception, has 
slipped from 50% to 43% in the last four years, but belief in 
clairvoyance or seeing the future holds steady at 21%.  Of surveyed 
teens, only 5% do not accept the existence of any of the supernatural 
forces. 

Western Europeans are less likely than Americans to have religious 
beliefs or to practice them, according to a Gallup poll published in a 
recent issue of Emerging Trends.  Across Western Europe, 79% express a 
belief in God or a universal spirit, compared with 96% in the United 
States.  About 65% of Europeans say they believe in the human soul; 58% 
agree to the concept of sin; 52% believe in life after death (65% 
U.S.); 47% believe in heaven (78% U.S.); and 39% believe in an 
after-death resurrection.  Beliefs in the devil or hell, at 27% and 
24%, are about half the American percentages.  As children, 74% of 
Western Europeans had religious upbringings (85% U.S.).  Although 89% 
of both Western Europeans and Americans say they belong to a religious 
denomination, Europeans are more likely to consider themselves Roman 
Catholics, 68% to 24%.  Only 25% of Europeans attend church weekly (42% 
U.S.), 11% claim to attend less than once a year, and 33% never attend 
church.  Just 5% of Europeans say they are "confirmed atheists."  
Western Europeans, though, think it is important to hold church 
observances for "significant rites of passage," such as birth 
commemorations (72%), marriage ceremonies (74%), or remembrances of the 
dead (81%). 
...Two former "Iron Curtain" countries show variant views on the role 
of the church, in a related survey.  Residents of Poland, still largely 
Catholic despite years of oppression, register stronger religious 
viewpoints than do inhabitants of Hungary, which grew more sectarian 
over the same time frame.  On whether the church answers spiritual 
needs, 80% of Poles agree, but only 61% of Western Europeans and 55% of 
Hungarians concur.  On moral problems, 67% of Poles think the church 
has answers, compared with 42% and 35% of Western Europeans and 
Hungarians.  Across the board (with responses ranging from 25% to 38%), 
members of all groups think the church is even less successful in 
helping with family and social needs. 

Two new publications are aimed at facilitating East-West missions 
cooperation in East Central Europe and the former U.S.S.R.  A new 
quarterly, East-West Church and Ministry Report, is published by the 
Institute for East-West Christian Studies at Wheaton College to 
encourage Western believers toward effective, culturally sensitive, and 
cooperative missions efforts in post-communist and Marxist lands.  And 
the new twopart book, East-West Christian Organizations, contains a 
directory of Western groups working in Eastern Europe, and 
presentations by four evangelism experts who urge evangelicals to work 
with native Orthodox and Catholic groups. Russian Educators to Help 
Fulfill the Great CoMission by Jo Kadlecek 

The CoMission, a coalition of 70 individual churches, denominations, 
missions agencies and parachurch organizations, will work together to 
reach what some have called the widest missions field in evangelistic 
history -- the Soviet Educational System. When Russian education 
officials invited U.S. Christian leaders to help the country's 120,000 
public schools, the CoMission was founded.  As Bruce Wilkinson, 
chairman of the group's executive committee, said, "We hear you, 
Russia, and we would like to come."  Over the next five years, 
CoMission members hope to train thousands of Russian educators to teach 
Christian ethics to schoolchildren.  Wilkinson says it is not a 
government program, but "a people-to-people program." 
...In November, The CoMission launched a massive recruitment and 
training effort to form a 12,000-member volunteer "Christian Peace 
Corps."  Three goals guide the CoMission vision: 1) to reach an entire 
generation in the Commonwealth of Independent States for Christ, using 
Bible lessons and curricula in public schools; 2) to establish an 
indigenous, theologically sound Bible study in every CIS school; and 3) 
to identify, train, and equip CIS leaders to take over all CoMission 
activities by Dec. 31, 1997.  Already 15 training convocations across 
Russia are scheduled for 1993. 
...Stateside, two conferences training full-time workers concluded Jan. 
13.  Each worker commits to spend at least a year in the former Soviet 
Union conducting Bible studies, training disciples, and following up 
with Russian educators.  Teams will be sent in January and August each 
year through 1997.  A CoMission spokesperson told NIRR that 1993 is the 
year of mobilization; retired lay persons, college students, educators, 
and "anyone with a heart for what's happening in the CIS" are applying 
with approved sending agencies.  The first of many planned 
Pastors/Christian Leaders Conferences was held Jan. 4-6 to recruit 
members.  The CoMission said the average church attending agreed to 
send a team of 10 each year during the next five years. 
...CoMission officials at national headquarters in Atlanta and the 
public relations office in Dallas have been meeting almost monthly with 
representatives from coalition ministries.  The consortium roles are 
specified according to each agency's strengths. Some serve as sending 
agencies, while others provide teaching, training and technology.  Many 
have compiled literature and curricula into one training book for 
American missionaries and Russian educators alike. 
...The organization's publicity has been widespread: from Newsweek to 
Cal Thomas, from USA Today to Christianity Today.  And scores of 
educational trade magazines, secular and Christian radio and television 
programs, daily newspapers, wire services, and international magazines 
have profiled the group.  Some national TV talk shows have requested 
interviews with Wilkinson or Vice Chairman Paul Eshleman. 
...But CoMission officials say they would rather inform Russians about 
"Christian Ethics and Morality: A Foundation for Society."  Officials 
of the Russian Orthodox Church have approved the CoMission's course as 
"acceptable for teaching the foundations of ethics based on Scripture." 
 Many Russian educators, believers, and even atheists have agreed that 
the teachings of Jesus can help form a foundation for moral and ethical 
decision-making in Russian society.  During training, CIS teachers are 
introduced to the Christian world view, interactive teaching 
techniques, and the curriculum they will present to their students.  
The CoMission reports that more than 80% of those present during the 
convocations expressed interest in weekly Bible studies, and more than 
90% wanted to teach the voluntary course in their school.  Some 
CoMission members who visited Ukraine last fall reported entire 
classrooms of teachers making personal decisions for Christ.  And since 
initial showings of the "Jesus" film in 1991, Eschleman has reported 
countless personal responses along with requests for additional 
screenings of the film in all Russian classrooms.

Vol. 7, No. 3                                                       
January 25, 1993 

Colorado will have to wait for Amendment 2.  Denver District Judge 
Jeffrey Bayless temporarily blocked enactment of the state measure, 
saying it may violate homosexuals' rights to equal protection under the 
U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment.  Bayless had two criteria by which 
to temporarily enjoin the measure: "real, immediate, and irreparable" 
danger of injury to homosexuals, or a reasonable chance that they would 
win their lawsuit.  Opponents of the measure, including representatives 
for the cities of Aspen, Boulder, and Denver (all of which have 
gay-rights statutes that the amendment would overturn), advised him on 
both.  Homosexuals who filed the suit told the judge their safety would 
be compromised if the law were enacted.  Numerous gay and lesbian 
groups have cited increased violence against homosexuals since approval 
of the amendment, but the accuracy of their figures and their 
definitions of "bias" and "hate crimes" have been questioned widely.  
The state attorney general's staff says the people of Colorado voted 
only to remove a "special protection" to a group, not individual civil 
rights.  The defense maintains that the judge's concepts of 
homosexuals' "fundamental...right not to have the state endorse and 
give effect to private biases" are not found in state or federal law.  
A trial date has not been set. 
...Aspen is swarming, despite the tourism boycott orchestrated by many 
opponents of Amendment 2.  The proposed ban has split the state, but 
not just across liberal-conservative lines.  Many who support 
homosexual rights, including the city's mayor, disapprove of shunning 
the state at the height of ski season.  The economic losses to Colorado 
will do nothing to change voters' minds, they maintain. 
...Homosexuals hurt their cause by overreacting to Amendment 2, said 
56% of respondents to a Denver Post-News 4 poll.  Many resented being 
considered bigots for their state's passage of the measure by a 53% to 
47% margin.  Of those interviewed, 94% would vote the same way as they 
did in November, and 43% said the tourism boycott made them less likely 
to want to repeal the amendment.  Only 15% of the respondents said they 
thought Colorado was less tolerant of homosexuals than other states. 

Amendment 2 will be a model for conservative and religious groups in 12 
states that seek to stop special homosexual rights.  Supporters of such 
laws learned moderation from the defeat of Oregon's Measure 9, which 
would have declared homosexuality "immoral" and "perverse."  Homosexual 
rights groups, too, say they have learned from their wins and losses, 
and will be better equipped to stave off new attempts to squelch their 
rights.  They plan active campaigns to establish more gay rights laws. 

"Frankly, we have had enough," said spokesmen for Focus on the Family.  
At issue, they say, are unsubstantiated but widely circulated rumors 
that the group requested from Colorado Springs public school officials 
the names of single teachers without dependents.  Their alleged purpose 
is to screen the lists in an apparent attempt to identify homosexuals 
to remove from their positions.  Focus says the rumors have persisted 
all year, despite school boards' repeated denials of their truth.  But 
the allegations, Focus says, came to national attention when broadcast 
by Linda Fowler, chair of the Denver Gay and Lesbian Advisory 
Committee.  On the Dec. 7 edition of the Gil Gross Show, a three-hour 
phone-in talk show carried on 100 CBS radio affiliates, Fowler repeated 
the rumors, dating them to the passage of Amendment 2.  The group 
maintains that her "obvious intent was to attack Focus on the Family" 
and "to place [the] organization in a false light."  Gross, too, is 
said to have "re-emphasized her lie" by calling it "sort of an 
empowerment to discriminate."  Focus attorney Stephen Reed said in a 
letter to Fowler that she could have easily found the allegations 
untrue had she attempted "the most cursory inquiry beforehand."  Reed 
has demanded that Fowler issue a written apology acknowledging the fact 
that her statements were false and have no factual basis.  She must 
also provide Gross and Denver's KOA-AM (on which the program aired 
locally) copies of her apology and request that they be read on the 
air.  If Fowler can substantiate her statements, Reed will not seek 
monetary and punitive damages in Colorado courts for defamation.  Focus 
continues to build its case while its attorneys await a response. 
...The rumors may have some basis in fact, says Amy Divine, cofounder 
of the Citizen's Project.  She and her husband, Doug Triggs, 
established the group to counteract the conservative influence of the 
growing evangelical community.  The more than 2,000 members of the 
Citizens Project include educators, mainline clergy members, parents, 
and business leaders who say "the religious right" is too aggressive in 
promoting its political agendas.  Divine told reporters she has heard 
first-hand reports about requests for information about local teachers, 
but she doubts Focus on the Family is involved.  "It is not their 
style," she said, but "somebody who is concerned about gay and lesbian 
teachers is using Focus' name for leverage." 
...Focus on the Family President James Dobson says a concerted effort 
is trying to make him and his group "look extremist, hate-filled, and 
vicious" in dealing with the homosexual community.  Although the group 
has publicly announced "that all people have the right to live their 
lives as they choose under the law," Focus, Dobson says, is targeted by 
supporters of the "juggernaut called the homosexual agenda."  As the 
largest of more than 55 national religious groups in the area, Dobson's 
organization has taken more hits than others.  Local bumper stickers 
read "Focus on Your Own D--Family," and news accounts report the 
group's downtown building has had bricks thrown through windows, animal 
intestines dumped at the doorstep, a few bomb threats, and a thorough 
postering with "Hate is not a family value" signs.  "When you talk 
about hate," Dobson said, "you need to find out which direction that 
hate is flowing." 

Of all hate crimes committed in the United States, 62.3% were racially 
motivated, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in its first 
official study on the topic.  The FBI examined 1991 crime figures and 
found that blacks were most often the targets of racial bias, at 35.5% 
as opposed to 18.7% for whites.  Religious bias accounted for 19.3% 
(with the overwhelming percentage reported against Jews), ethnic bias 
9.5%, and sexual preference, almost always against homosexuals, 8.9%.  
Of the crimes committed, intimidation, vandalism, and assaults were 
most common.  Robbery, burglary, arson, theft, rape, and murder were 
much less frequent.  The study is the result of the Hate Crime 
Statistics Acts of 1990, which mandated compilation of the percentages 
based on limited voluntary participation of law enforcement agencies.  
The FBI hopes that next year's figures will be based on more inclusive 
reports from additional large cities and increased tracking of hate 
crimes by police. 

Racial understanding and social change are more important to college 
freshmen than in previous years, according to a University of 
California at Los Angeles annual study of new underclassmen.  An 
all-time high, 42%, believed it was "essential" to promote racial 
harmony, up almost eight percentage points over last year.  College 
freshmen also set a new record when more than 85% agreed that racial 
discrimination is still a major problem in America, compared with about 
80% in 1991, perhaps the effect of the L.A. riots.  Influencing social 
values was deemed essential or very important to more than 43% of 
respondents, another record high.  More than 20% of freshmen wanted to 
influence the political structure, and 26% said they would participate 
in a community action program.  Almost one-third supported becoming a 
community leader as a worthwhile goal, nearly double the findings of a 
1972 study.  The trend suggested by the findings shows that today's 
students are even more committed to public service and socio-political 
change than their counterparts of just a few years ago.  The UCLA 
Graduate School of Education surveyed over 213,000 students at 404 U.S. 
schools. 

"With God's help and your prayers, I will do my best," Bill Clinton 
said in a tearful goodbye to his friends at Immanuel Baptist Church in 
Little Rock Jan. 10.  He thanked the staff and congregation of the 
church he had attended since 1980 for making him feel at home through 
even the worst of the campaign, and credited them with helping to 
prepare him for the job ahead.  The new president especially thanked 
pastor Rex Horne Jr., who had come under fire for supporting Clinton's 
membership despite his views on homosexual and abortion rights.  
Clinton said Baptists have a respect for all religions without 
codifying any.  "But that does not mean we should take values or 
principles out of our politics.  None of us can or should do that." 
...Culpeper (Va.) Baptist Church was the Sunday morning worship stop 
for the ClintonGore American Reunion bus tour, right after a visit to 
Thomas Jefferson's Monticello home.  Pastor Herbert Browning Jr.'s 
sermon, "Living Our Convictions," was drawn from the book of Daniel, 
news sources said, but was purposely apolitical.  The pastor admitted 
he was more nervous than usual, and joked about erecting a plaque that 
said "Bill and Al Slept Here" on the newly-historic pews.  Most of the 
crowd outside the church was enthusiastic, but some held signs reading 
"Mr. Clinton, Do Not Mock God." 
...Clinton's Inauguration Day began with prayer and worship at 
Washington's Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church.  The 
111-year-old African-American church, long active in supporting civil 
rights, is pastored by William DeVeaux, who led the ecumenical service. 
 Rabbis, pastors, and Muslim leaders participated.  DeVeaux said the 
new administration's leaders thought the need for prayer was a serious 
matter. He also saw the service as evidence of Clinton's belief that 
church and political leaders can work together to solve moral and 
ethical questions. 
...Billy Graham's prayers at Clinton's inauguration marked his seventh 
participation in such presidential events.  Over the past 40 years, 
Graham has attended the inaugurations of Presidents Eisenhower, 
Johnson, Nixon, Reagan, and Bush, and has been acquainted with each 
president since Truman.  Often Graham has delivered an invocation or 
benediction (as he did Wednesday), or preached in special worship 
services. As they did with the Johnsons in 1969, Graham and his wife, 
Ruth, stayed with the Bush family in the White House on the last night 
of the administration. 
...But Graham's prayers could be seen as an endorsement of the new 
president's "explicitly unbiblical" views on abortion and 
homosexuality, according to Christian leaders who wanted the evangelist 
to decline his invitation.  Speaking for 40 prolife signatories of a 
letter to Graham, Bill Devlin, executive director of the Christian 
Action Council's Philadelphia branch, said Graham's participation would 
be "a great embarrassment for all who call themselves evangelical 
Protestants."  Graham helped form the CAC in 1975.  Patrick Mahoney of 
the Christian Defense Coalition appeared at a news conference with 
Devlin to urge protest calls and letters to Graham's Minneapolis 
headquarters, where their groups also held a small prayer vigil. 
...Graham is accustomed to being a religious pawn, Cal Thomas said.  
The syndicated Christian columnist recently recounted a 1982 
conversation with the evangelist, who had just returned from a 
controversial trip to the Soviet Union.  Thomas asked Graham if he felt 
he was being used by the communists.  Graham's response was "Of course, 
but I'm using them, too, to get out the Gospel." 

Leaders of the National Council of Churches hope to meet with President 
Clinton early in his administration, based on the encouragement of 
transition team leader Vernon Jordan.  Earlier this month 12 NCC 
officials were invited to meet with Jordan and two other transition 
officials, according to news reports.  The church leaders presented 
four areas for action: rebuilding cities, prioritizing people, 
providing universal health care, and strengthening church-state 
collaboration in international relations. Praising the NCC for its 
"compassionate and courageous ministries," Jordan stressed that he 
could not guarantee administration cooperation, but he said the 
discussion was beneficial.  The leaders hope the meeting signals the 
re-emergence of interest in mainline denominational opinions at the 
presidential level.  Under Reagan and Bush, evangelical and 
conservative views carried more clout than those of the NCC members. 

"If he does some of the things he's talking about, he'll blow the dome 
off the Capitol," Jerry Falwell said about Clinton's plans to keep his 
campaign promises.  He said, however, that Clinton might become a good 
president if he reneges on his promises to homosexuals, feminists, 
abortionists, economists, and the like.  "In fairness, we need to give 
him time."  Falwell said Clinton's platform would "guarantee upheaval" 
across the country, and would rejuvenate causes like the Moral 
Majority. Some have urged Falwell to resurrect the group he founded in 
1979 and disbanded 10 years later after he said it achieved its goals.  
But Falwell has no plans to organize or lead a new Moral Majority, 
although he would support similar political action groups.  He said he 
will focus on more pressing needs, among them preaching at Thomas Road 
Baptist Church and overseeing the financial recovery of his Liberty 
University, both in Lynchburg, Va.  Falwell made his comments between 
deliveries of a sermon at First Baptist Church in Dallas on Clinton's 
first 100 days. 
...First Baptist, meanwhile, continues to regroup after Pastor Joel 
Gregory's resignation over his and Senior Pastor W.A. Criswell's 
leadership roles (NIRR 10/19/92). Church leaders held Sunday-afternoon 
meetings this month and last to update the church family on recent 
developments, local news reports indicated.  An informal 
question-and-answer session quelled the fears of many members, but left 
others unappeased.  Many questioned Gregory's departure and its costs, 
the methods and time frame the church would use in its pastoral search, 
and whether church salaries were too high in light of recent program 
cuts.  A mid-December church publication indicated a shortfall of about 
12% in the "Test the Lord" stewardship campaign to fund the 1993 $7.5 
million budget.  Church officials, an article said, decried the return 
of unsigned pledge cards, some containing complaints rather than tithe 
promises.  First Baptist hopes to save more than $600,000 by 
discontinuing broadcasts of its Sundaymorning services, which have been 
televised locally for more than 25 years. 
...Joel Gregory, meanwhile, continues to chair the denomination's 
search for a new president for the Southern Baptist Foreign Mission 
Board.  The committee decided on a nominee during its January prayer 
retreat, but agreed not to discuss the selection until a trustees 
meeting, either next month or in April, Baptist Press reported. 

The Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability reinstated 
Samaritan's Purse and World Medical Mission as members in good standing 
after more than 10 months of disagreements and discussion (NIRR 
4/20/92, 8/10/92).  The relief and medical aid ministries, led by 
Franklin Graham, had an on-again, off-again relationship with ECFA over 
disputed spending practices and board governance.  A source familiar 
with both ECFA and Graham said a letter from the ministries last month 
clarified three concerns for ECFA: 1) methods for calculating 
fund-raising costs as a percentage of total income; 2) board knowledge 
and approval of expenditures for Graham's participation in an event not 
clearly related to the ministries; and 3) explanation of advance 
budgeting processes for the organizations, which often deal with 
unpredictable world catastrophes.  With those issues settled, ECFA 
accepted the applications the groups submitted last June for 
readmittance.  Both ministries had joined the Better Business Bureau in 
October as an interim show of financial accountability. 
...Standardizing the accounting and valuation processes for 
gifts-in-kind and donated goods is the quest of the Association of 
Evangelical Relief and Development Organizations.  Its two dozen 
agencies recently approved policies requiring member groups to accept 
only products that are obviously appropriate for their missions and 
program goals.  Fair market value will be based on common sales markets 
and quantities of the donated goods, usually equal to the retail price 
an average individual consumer would pay.  Damaged or expired products 
must be additionally discounted.  AERDO's standards follow careful 
documentation, with revenue recorded only upon transfer of possession. 
...InterAction, a group of 143 development and relief organizations 
alarmed by nonprofit misconduct and its accompanying publicity, has 
established new ethical standards for its members' governance, 
accounting, and management practices.  The rules include: independent 
volunteer boards of directors; majority board attendance at a minimum 
of two annual meetings; policies against conflicts of interest; 
approval of annual budget, and selection of independent auditor by 
board members; written standards of conduct ensuring confidential 
reports of misconduct.  InterAction, based in Washington, D.C., also 
subscribes to the AERDO financial standards. 

American Atheists' spokesman Rob Sherman targeted "In God We Trust," 
but missed having the phrase declared unconstitutional.  Zion, Ill., 
north of Chicago, redesigned its city seal to include the national 
motto after Sherman successfully proved that the city violated the 
separation of church and state by using a cross and the phrase "God 
Reigns" on its original seal.  U.S. District Judge James Zagel said the 
new seal may invoke "the same spirit and message" as its earlier 
version, but legal precedents say "In God We Trust" is "a phrase of 
civil instead of religious significance."  The new seal must be in 
place by June.  Sherman doubts his appeals will work, because the 
Supreme Court has already refused to hear appeals over the phrase's 
constitutionality, and Sherman maintained that courts commonly rule 
against atheists. 
...Sacramento is still constitutional.  The Supreme Court refused to 
rule in a case over use of the California capital's name on the city 
seal.  James O'Leary, 80, had alleged in two previous court losses that 
the name of the city illegally established a "preference for 
Christianity" by its reference to sacraments, news reports said. 
...But it's unconstitutional for Gideons to give 5th graders Bibles in 
Rensselaer, Ind., a three-judge panel of the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of 
Appeals in Chicago unanimously ruled.  The judges reversed a district 
court judge's opinion that letting the Gideons distribute the free 
Bibles was "no more offensive than allowing the Little League into 
classrooms to talk up the national pastime."  The panel declared the 
previous ruling "tone deaf" to the constitutional anti-establishment 
clause and "insensitive to the special concern about coercive 
influences on impressionable public school children," according to news 
accounts. 
...Catholic landlords have the right not to rent to a cohabitating 
couple, a judge decided in a Massachusetts housing discrimination case. 
 Cynthia Tarail and Mark Lattanzi were told they could not rent an 
apartment owned by Louise and Paul Desilets, and his brother Ronald 
Desilets.  The landlords explained that they did not rent to unmarried 
couples because of their Roman Catholic beliefs.  The couple's 
complaint stirred the attorney general to file a lawsuit alleging 
discrimination on the basis of marital status.  But Superior Court 
Judge George Keady ruled that the state had no "paramount and 
compelling" interest in protecting the couple from housing 
discrimination that would outweigh the Desilets' freedom of religion. 

Pro-life forces are hailing the Supreme Court's 6-3 decision that the 
Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 does not apply to abortion protests.  Abortion 
providers had used the civil-rights statute to prevent protests, saying 
they were a conspiracy against the constitutional rights of women, but 
the court decided otherwise.  Jay Sekulow, counsel for the American 
Center for Law and Justice, represented Jane Bray and Operation Rescue 
in their suit against the Alexandria (Va.) Women's Health Clinic (NIRR 
10/19/92).  He argued a point established in Casey v. Planned 
Parenthood, the case that recently affirmed abortion rights: that 
reasonable people can disagree on abortion.  In language mirroring 
Casey, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, "Whatever one thinks of abortion, 
it cannot be denied that there are common and respectable reasons for 
opposing it, other than hatred of or condescension toward...women." 
...The RICO Act does not apply: pro-life protesters are not 
"economically motivated," U.S. District Judge John Potter ruled.  
Citing a precedent established last year, Potter said abortion clinics 
can not use the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act 
to sue abortion protesters because demonstrators' sit-ins do not 
constitute racketeering.  The Women's Pavilion of Toledo, Ohio, had 
sought triple damages totaling $100 million.  Rutherford Institute 
attorney Robert Holmes represented 28 of the 66 demonstrators.  Some 
still face trespassing and assault charges. The court is seeking 
Justice Department views on its ruling in N.O.W. v. Scheidler. 

Tithing is a "fraudulent transfer" under federal bankruptcy laws, a 
judge declared, while admitting discomfort with the decision.  
Minneapolis Judge Robert Kressel said Bruce and Nancy Young of St. 
Louis Park, Minn., can spend their money only for necessities since 
declaring bankruptcy on their electrical contracting business.  So the 
1,400-member Crystal Evangelical Free Church has been ordered to return 
the Youngs' contributions, which will go toward repaying creditors.  In 
1990 the Youngs gave the church $13,500, 10% of their earnings, which 
is said to have alerted federal officials to the violation.  Crystal's 
Executive Pastor William Sisterson sees a dangerous church-state 
interference.  The church board is expected to appeal, despite the 
cost, because of the importance of fighting the "increasing intrusion 
by the state into the affairs of the church," Sisterson told Religious 
News Service. 

Boy Scout activities will have to take place after classes in San 
Diego, Calif.  The city school board voted unanimously to ban any 
in-school programs because the Boy Scouts of America has a policy 
forbidding homosexuals from serving as Scout leaders. "Such action 
violates district policy," Superintendent Tom Payzant said, referring 
to a November decision to add sexual orientation to the area's 
anti-discrimination policy.  Two mandatory Boy Scout programs will be 
cut: an inner-city elementary scouting class and a high-school career 
awareness speakers' forum.  The ban will take effect July 1, when the 
new school year begins.  The Boy Scouts, according to local executive 
Ron Brundage, will keep its policy because that's "what the parents 
want." 

Child sex abusers who commit "reprehensible" acts are victims of a 
"disease," the Roman Catholic Bishops Conference of England and Wales 
said.  Their report suggested that responses to abusers should not be 
"simply punitive or vindictive," but need to include treatment, RNS 
reported.  For victims, reconciliation and forgiveness, not 
retribution, are the keys to recovery.  Victims should not blame 
themselves and they should focus on issues other than "repayment for 
what had been done."  The bishops took no position on seeking criminal 
charges or civil damages in lawsuits.  Recovery from sexual abuse is 
"often a very long and painful process," they said, and the church must 
find ways to help children who have been abused.  Catholics are as 
prone to abuse as anyone, the bishops acknowledged, and must discuss 
sexuality.  They suggested education efforts and specific disciplinary 
actions for abusers to raise sexabuse awareness in local and diocesan 
councils and schools. 

James Porter's sexual abuse conviction will not be retried.  Defense 
attorneys had claimed misconduct by the prosecution during the trial in 
which the former Catholic priest was found guilty on six counts of 
molesting his children's babysitter in 1987 (NIRR 10/5/92).  Judge 
Kenneth Maas said closing arguments about the "James Porter school of 
sex education" and other retorts (which Maas instructed the jury to 
disregard) may have been offensive, but did not warrant another trial.  
Porter is free on $1,000 bail until sentencing Jan. 28.  Other lawsuits 
brought by alleged victims in Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New Mexico 
are pending, according to news accounts. 
...The archdiocese of Santa Fe, N.M., knew about Porter's penchant for 
pedophilia, but still assigned him to six local parishes, says an 
attorney for four alleged victims.  Bruce Pasternack told reporters 
that church documents from attorneys for the Servants of the Paraclete 
Center in Jemez Springs, where Porter was treated for his problem, 
prove the plaintiffs right.  They allege the priest abused them while 
in treatment between 1967 and 1969, and Pasternack says the documents 
show the center and the archdiocese -- both named in the lawsuit -- 
"knew their children were going to be raped by Porter before they were 
raped."  New Mexico church officials and their attorneys say 
Pasternack's interpretations are inaccurate. 

J. Robert Williams, controversial homosexual priest, died of 
AIDS-related pulmonary infection at age 37.  Williams had an on-going 
battle with the Episcopal Church, into which he was ordained in 1989 by 
Bishop John Spong (NIRR 1/1/90, 3/11/91, 9/23/91). Jane Spahr will 
become an evangelist for the church that wanted her as its pastor. The 
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) ruled in November that Spahr, an ordained 
minister, was unfit to lead Downtown United Presbyterian Church in 
Rochester, N.Y., because she is a lesbian (NIRR 11/16/92).  But 
Downtown's leadership thinks she could help to stop discrimination 
against homosexuals in the church.  Spahr's evangelistic ministry would 
be financed with church missions funds, not a salary, to avoid 
violation of the decision by the denomination's Permanent Judicial 
Commission, according to RNS.  The church's co-pastor says it will 
remain in the 2.9-million-member PCUSA in hopes of convincing its 
members to open all ministries to gays and lesbians.  The National 
Religious Partnership for the Environment wants a "green" church.  The 
new campaign, broadly supported by mainline and evangelical 
Protestants, Roman Catholics, and Jews, seeks to gain permanent 
ecological support from various religious groups.  NRPE Director Paul 
Gorman told RNS that such an infrastructure will assure that the 
environment remains an important issue for religious action.  Training 
programs and conferences will assist clergy in mobilizing their 
churches and suggesting public policy changes.  Participating 
denominations will select 70,000 pilot congregations to receive NRPE 
educational kits with suggested environmental projects.  Carl Sagan and 
34 other key scientists first suggested the partnership to key 
religious leaders three years ago, but Vice President Al Gore is 
credited with organizing the Washington meeting leading to its 
founding.  Funding toward the $4-million budget has come from major 
grants from trusts and foundations.  Denominational volunteers will 
staff the NRPE, headquartered at New York's Cathedral of St. John the 
Divine, an Episcopal church known for its interest and activism in 
environmental issues. 
...And Green Cross, a new Christian environmental organization, has 
been founded to address ethical and moral issues relating to ecology, 
and to mobilize volunteers to help restore creation.  GC leaders, who 
represent a broad range of denominational, environmental, and relief 
organizations, hope to spur the church to act on environmental problems 
rather than merely to study their theological underpinnings.  Green 
Cross will emphasize service, advocacy, biblical study, and educational 
efforts in Christian schools and colleges.  Cal DeWitt, a member of the 
planning committee and a secretary of the International Evangelical 
Environment Network, says the idea was proposed in 1986 by former 
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, but planning for the Western 
version began in 1991 under the auspices of the North American 
Conference of Christianity and Ecology.  The group's leaders called for 
"the Christian Church, with its human and financial resources, to 
respond by creating new organizing efforts that challenge, motivate, 
and involve citizens."  A February meeting will continue to establish 
the legal aspects for the non-profit group, which hopes to cover its 
proposed $500,000 first-year budget with corporate grants and gifts. 
...Evangelicals shouldn't ignore the environment for fear of supporting 
a New Age movement, said Tony Campolo, author of "How to Rescue the 
Earth Without Worshipping the Planet."  As "the hot issue of the next 
decade," Campolo said, environmentalism needs Christian moral 
responses, "even if the church wants to avoid them."  Campolo said 
Christians need not agree wholeheartedly with Vice President Al Gore's 
environmental manifesto, but they can't afford to leave the movement to 
those without an understanding of creation.  He urges Christians to 
respect the beauty of the planet, and charges them to be good stewards 
of its resources. 

Clarifications: Both the Southern Baptists and the National Association 
of Evangelicals support the proposed Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 
but oppose abortion.  In addition, the U.S. Catholic Conference is not 
a member of the National Council of Churches....On sexual allegations 
against the Paulks, six women claimed involvement with either Earl or 
Don Paulk, or with one of two nephews pastoring related ministries 
(NIRR 1/11)....John Sanders' paper to the American Academy of Religion 
and the Society of Biblical Literature (NIRR 12/14/92) was not 
positional.  He does not believe in salvation after death nor by works, 
as some may have been led to believe. 

"There is hope.  There is peace.  I found both in the Lord Jesus 
Christ," Westley Allan Dodd said before his hanging Jan. 5 in 
Washington state.  The child torturer and rapist was executed for three 
1989 murders.  His hanging, the first in the country in 28 years, was 
accompanied by national debate on the cruelty of the method. But Dodd, 
before his conversion, requested that he be killed in the same way he 
had killed one victim.  When he first waived all appeals, he said he 
knew he must be killed.  If not, he was certain he would kill and rape 
again, and "enjoy every minute of it."  But in his final statements he 
said there was a way to stop sex offenders. "Turn to the Lord and you 
will find peace." 
..."It's all right.  I'll see you in heaven," murderer John Sterling 
Gardner told friends before he was executed by lethal injection in 
North Carolina last October. Gardner was convicted in 1982 for armed 
robberies and three murders he committed in a six-week crime spree.  He 
converted in 1991 as he considered a Christian friend's execution.  
Soon after, at a Prison Fellowship death row seminar, he met Raleigh 
businessman C.A. Dillon, who became Gardner's Bible study leader and 
close friend. Dillon told the Greensboro Daily News & Record that 
Gardner accepted punishment for his crimes as God's will, and that they 
held a communion service on the day before the execution.  Dillon said 
Gardner regularly had said, "I'm grateful that I got put in prison.  If 
I were not here, I would not have found Jesus."  When the World Cup of 
Soccer finals come to Los Angeles in 1994, Luis Palau will be there.  
The evangelist has accepted invitations to conduct outreach rallies in 
L.A. and other host cities.  Palau, an American citizen for more than 
30 years, is familiar with the needs of multi-cultural citizens as a 
third-generation European born in Argentina.  Palau's evangelism team 
is planning a literature blitz, and will work with Sports Outreach Los 
Angeles to mobilize churches to help with rallies. 

Football and God often are considered rivals on Super Bowl Sunday, but 
the Tom Landry Halftime Spectacular may stop the competition by turning 
the Jan. 31 game into an evangelistic outreach.  The event, sponsored 
by Sports Outreach America, a San Bernardino, Calif.-based group 
representing 80 national ministries and 40 evangelical denominations, 
urges Christians to invite unchurched friends to a party to watch the 
Dallas-Buffalo game.  But at halftime partygoers are urged to watch a 
special 12minute video, co-hosted by Ben Kinchlow of the "700 Club" and 
the former Dallas Cowboys coach.  The tape features several NFL 
players, some from the championship teams, talking about their faith in 
Christ.  SOA President Ralph Drollinger, a former UCLA basketball 
standout and Dallas Mavericks pro, says, in football terms, that the 
outreach will not "clothesline" people with the gospel.  Preprinted 
invitations and advertisements make it clear that the tape will feature 
discussions about God.  More than 1,500 congregations have responded to 
SOA's mass mailings by ordering the $59.95 kit, which includes the 
video, 10 copies of Sports Spectrum magazine, two NIV New Testaments 
with brief athlete testimonies, five packets of Christian football 
trading cards, and a training manual.  "Many Americans look up to 
athletes as their heroes and role models," Landry says. "I only wish 
we'd thought of this idea 20 years ago!" 
...The "Comeback Kid" and the Second Coming:  Buffalo backup 
quarterback Frank Reich, known for his come-from-behind performances, 
says thinking about the rapture helps him do his job better.  "The Lord 
tells us we don't know the hour or the day" of the Lord's return, he 
said at a news conference, "[and] I don't know the hour or the day that 
I'm going to get called upon."  When an injury sidelined the Bills' 
lead quarterback Jim Kelly, Reich led the team to the AFC playoffs with 
a 38-point rally in the second half to beat the Houston Oilers (much as 
he had led the University of Maryland Terrapins back from a 31-0 
deficit against the University of Miami to win the 1984 Orange Bowl).  
Reich told the Dallas Morning News that he's playing pro ball "because 
God has given me an opportunity to proclaim His name. "because God has 
given me an opportunity to proclaim His name."

Vol. 7, No. 2                                                        
January 11, 1993 

About 70% of all progress toward evangelizing the world has taken place 
since 1900, church growth expert George Otis Jr. told an AD 2000 
evangelistic conference.  And 70% of that has occurred since World War 
II -- and 70% of that success has come in the last three years. 
...Even so, it's difficult to believe that 70,000 Christians were 
baptized in a single service in mid-November.  South Africa's IMVO, a 
secular newspaper with a circulation of more than 1 million, reported 
that the Tsomo river in the Transkei region was the site of a mass 
baptismal service.  IMVO had been reporting a spiritual revival for 
weeks, and that tens of thousands were turning to Christ.  The 
newspaper said the line of those awaiting baptism was more than five 
kilometers long, and it took Archbishop Mazwi Mboniswa and 21 bishops 
from St. John Apostolic Church five hours to immerse groups of 
participants.  Eyewitnesses reported physical healings, deliverance 
from demons, and other spiritual manifestations, often as believers 
came up from the water.  Karel Sanders, director of Africa Ministries, 
which trains local pastors for leadership, told NIRR that "revival is 
still going on in the area." 

Muslim extremists freed Franciscan missionary Augustine Fraszczack 
after 69 days of captivity in the jungles of the southern Philippines 
island of Basilan.  "Brother Gus," 55, indicated in a news conference 
that he was not physically mistreated, but he was forced to write 
ransom letters demanding $200,000 from the pope and U.S. Catholic 
officials.  The paramedic missionary was occasionally threatened with 
death.  He said he told his captors they might as well kill him, since 
the ransom would not be paid, but his release was facilitated by 
government negotiator Joey Tugung, a Muslim. Over three days Tugung 
convinced the kidnappers that their extortion attempts had failed, and 
gave the captors "token gifts" of rice, cigarettes, a small radio, two 
pairs of expensive sunglasses, and several pieces of personal clothing. 
 Doctors said Fraszczack is in good health, although Catholics had 
reported him to be weak from malaria and heart problems before the 
abduction. 

Pay the fine and leave: that's what 12 South Korean Christians did to 
get released from jail in the wealthy Muslim country of Brunei on the 
island of Borneo.  The members of the One Heart Gospel Missionary group 
were fined $307 each for soliciting $367 for charity work, according to 
news reports.  The Seoul-based missionaries, ages 20 to 40, also handed 
out cassettes and literature about Christianity.  Paying the fines 
spared them two weeks in jail. 

Dozens of churches in Indonesia were destroyed or damaged by mobs of 
angry Muslims over the past two months, according to news reports and 
church sources.  It all started with a tract by an evangelist extolling 
the virtues of Christianity over Islam, Indonesian church leaders, who 
requested anonymity, told NIRR.  The evangelist was charged in court 
with fomenting religious unrest and insulting the prophet Muhammad.  An 
Assembly of God pastor in Pasuruan in eastern Java published an account 
of the case and circulated it among other churches.  A copy fell into 
the hands of Muslim leaders, who accused the pastor of being part of an 
evangleical campaign against Islam, the church leaders said.  On Nov. 
15, several thousand Muslims, appearing to be well organized, tore down 
and burned the church, which also served as the pastor's home.  After 
leaving the area, the crowd wrecked another Assembly of God church and 
a Reformed church.  A wave of violence, fueled by videotapes of Serbian 
violence against Muslims in Bosnia, wild rumors of Christian 
conspiracies against Muslims, and forged tracts purporting to be 
Christian-produced, ensued against churches throughout Java and 
Sumatra.  No deaths or serious injuries were reported, but "the 
implications are serious for the future of the church in Indonesia and 
for Indonesia itself," one of the leaders said.  The government 
estimates Muslim strength at 85% of the population of 184 million 
(scattered among 13,700 islands and 300 linguistic groups).  Although 
the government officially has followed a course of religious 
neutrality, increasing numbers of Muslim activists with an ideological 
agenda for politics have been elected or appointed to key positions, 
and President Suharto has been courting radical Muslims to strengthen 
his own base of support, the leaders said. They appealed for Christians 
in the West to lobby their governments to insist Indonesia protect 
human rights, including religious freedom, of all its citizens.  Egypt 
and Tunis joined to call their Arab neighbors to fight Muslim extremism 
across the Islamic world.  They forged their joint security strategy 
against fundamentalist "terrorism" at a three-day conference of the 
Arab League Council of Interior Ministers, Reuters reported, and they 
expect Algeria, long on the verge of religiously motivated civil war, 
to join their cause soon. 
...A Cairo-based meeting Jan. 19  will "enlighten" Egypt's 58 million 
people about Islam.  Presidential sponsor Hosni Mubarak hopes to stop 
the fundamentalist Muslim wave of violence and extremism lately 
directed against tourists and Christians, news reports said.  The 
meeting, which will also be coordinated with other Islamic North 
African countries, will host invited religious leaders and scholars 
from 100 Islamic countries and 35 Egyptian government officials.  
There, the Cairo Declaration, the keystone document, will "strongly 
denounce terrorism, extremism, and backwardness." Egypt also plans to 
convert 300 mosques into religious education centers and libraries, 
which it hopes will aid scholars in teaching the young the real Islamic 
call rather than spreading ignorance and prejudice. 
..."It is getting harder and harder to be a Christian in Egypt," a 
Coptic Church deaconness said.  In a UPI news story, she noted 
discrimination and violence by Muslim militants against the minority 
religion of 5 to 7 million adherents.  Most Copts live in the southern 
part of Upper Egypt, and maintain a low profile.  Although some Copts 
claim Islamic intolerance of other religions, Muslims often note 
illegal Christian missionary efforts may be a cause of recent attacks 
on Copts.  Islamic supporters say the Copts' continued existence and 
growth in Egypt are proof of their tolerance. 
...They're calling it a revival.  Missionaries and pastors for the 
Assemblies of God in Egypt report at least 50 churches are bursting at 
the pews, and many are packed to five times their normal capacities.  
For months some AG churches have been holding daily services, which 
pastors report sometimes last seven to eight hours.  Denominational 
estimates say 25,000 have been saved, and hundreds of those have been 
"baptized in the spirit."  Physical healings and deliverance from 
demons, they said, are common.  An article in Mountain Movers, the 
denomination's foreign missions magazine, credits three movements 
leading to the current revival:  1) renewal in the Coptic church, 
beginning in the 1970s, but resurfacing in the 1990s; 2) a strong 
salvation rate after an "anointed" annual celebration at a Pentecostal 
orphanage; and 3) a special empowering of ministers at a 1991 pastoral 
conference led by AG evangelist and missionary Leroy Cloud, that was 
evidenced by the movement of the Spirit from church to church.  The 
magazine also recounts the story of an AG pastor who sought permission 
to hold a four-hour rally in a large city soccer stadium, but was 
refused. After the pastor called on Christians to pray, his second 
request was granted by a higher official.  Despite a lack of advance 
publicity and opponents' two-minute interruption of electrical service, 
the stadium was filled with townspeople and villagers brought in by 
bus.  By the end of the meeting, filled with singing, preaching, and 
worship, 2,000 came forward to be saved, and many in the prayer line 
were healed. "God visits our country from time to time," said Ayad 
Shenouda, general superintendent of the Egyptian AG churches.  "It is a 
heaven-sent revival." 

President George Bush declared Jan. 16 Religious Freedom Day, in what 
may be his last proclamation in office.  Praising the benefits of the 
First Amendment, Bush wrote that religious freedom was "integral to the 
preservation and development of the United States," and that the 
country would continue "to champion religious liberty and tolerance 
around the world."  The proclamation condemned the persecution of 
ethnic and religious minorities, specifically Jews, and Bush called on 
all nations to respect the fundamental human and religious rights of 
individuals to achieve universal peace.  All Americans are urged to 
observe the day with appropriate ceremonies at their places of worship, 
homes, and schools. 

Capitol Hill lobbyists both for and against the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act will be busy trying to convince the 103rd Congress to 
see things their way, according to news accounts.  Advocates are 
pressing for speedy passage of the bill, which was stalled last year by 
political debate over abortion.  Enactment would in effect reverse the 
Supreme Court's 1990 ruling that upheld states' rights in barring 
ritual drug use in religious ceremonies.  Since that time, courts have 
decided more than 50 free exercise cases, but the religious groups 
involved usually lost, Religious News Service reported.  The Act, if 
passed, would reinstate the "compelling-interests" test to decide 
whether states should restrict religious practices.  Supporters of the 
bill include the Southern Baptist Convention's Christian Life 
Commission, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations' Religious 
Action Center, and almost all denominations in the National Council of 
Churches.  But opponents, including the U.S. Catholic Conference (a 
member of the NCC), the National Right to Life Committee, the National 
Association of Evangelicals, and many Southern Baptist groups, are 
pushing for an amendment that would preclude the bill's use as an 
abortion-rights defense. President-elect Bill Clinton has approved of 
the bill.  Clinton also will be urged to abolish government catering to 
religious groups through the White House's religious liaison office.  
Critics, including the Alliance of Baptists' Executive Director Stan 
Hastey, say that President Jimmy Carter never should have founded the 
office, which during the last two administrations has "degenerated" 
into a White House PR tool to reach the religious right.  Hastey told 
The Washington Post that the office had "trivialized" religious groups 
into little more than lobbies to appease.  Others, like the Religious 
Action Center of Reform Judaism's director, David Saperstein, defend 
the office as a "helpful link," but note that access was more 
interactive and religiously diverse in the late 1970s.  He aims for 
only one goal: to have the "moral voice of the religious community 
heard by policymakers." 
...Nor should Clinton appoint an ambassador to the Vatican.  Critics, 
including the Southern Baptist Convention and Americans United for 
Separation of Church and State, say diplomatic ties with one specific 
faith entangle government and religion too much.  Many Catholics, too, 
are said to be concerned over potential interference between church and 
state.  Critics see Clinton's presidency as the last chance to abolish 
the post that President Ronald Reagan established in 1984. 

An Illinois Catholic, Lawrence Gibbs, may be "the most prolific" 
sex-abusing priest in the country, according to the attorney for one 
alleged victim.  A $5 million suit claims Gibbs sexually assaulted 
Joseph Dittrich, 22, more than 50 times, when he was between the ages 
of 11 and 17.  Dittrich's investigator says he has also found at least 
40 other people who say Gibbs abused them after his ordination in 1973. 
 In 1979, while associate pastor of Christ the King Church in Lombard, 
Gibbs was arrested for child sex abuse charges.  He was subsequently 
transferred to St. Joseph's Church in Lockport, where he headed the 
altar boy program.  Dittrich first encountered him there.  The suit 
also claims that Bishop Joseph Imesch, who Dittrich says was 
responsible for investigating priests' backgrounds before placing them 
in parishes, should have found Gibbs unfit for ministry.  Joliet 
diocese officials have placed Gibbs on administrative leave while he 
receives professional help. 
...A retired Catholic priest in Denver is also accused of sexually 
molesting children across the U.S. for over 30 years.  David Holley, 
65, subject of the New Mexico lawsuit, was known to be a child abuser 
by the church, but was transferred from parish to parish across several 
dioceses, said the Rocky Mountain Times.  Although the Worcester, 
Mass., diocese sent Holley for pedophilia treatment in 1971, he was 
released several times from the center, Servants of the Paraclete, in 
Jemez Springs, N.M. Holley then worked with the nearby St. Jude Mission 
Catholic Church, where he molested boys in the sacistry and rectory, 
say two alleged victims who filed the suit. 
...Warrants in two states: Richard Trepinski, a former Roman Catholic 
boys' choir director, is already in a Charlotte County, Fla., jail, but 
he's wanted in Louisiana too.  The five Florida charges include lewd 
and lascivious behavior and indecent assault against minors under the 
age of 16.  The claims reportedly date to an incident in a Colorado 
motel when the choir toured five states in the summer of 1991.  News 
accounts say Trepinski, 55, told detectives he'd had oral and manual 
sex with members of the choir several times a week for more than a 
year.  New Orleans police also issued a warrant last month for 
Trepinski's arrest on felony charges of indecent behavior with a 
juvenile during the same tour.  Trepinski was originally arrested and 
charged with 99 counts in Florida.  A meeting between investigators in 
both states may result in further charges. 
...Eight former St. Lawrence Seminary prep school students say faculty 
priests sexually abused them.  The alleged victims told the Milwaukee 
Journal that at least six priests and brothers teaching at the 
136-year-old Catholic school, located in Mt. Calvary, Wis., were 
involved in abusive sexual acts.  Most of the former students attended 
the school in the 1970s, and say they filed complaints to authorities.  
A dorm supervisor at that time said he filed statements for students 
against brother Thomas Gardipee.  Despite the actions, Gardipee was 
promoted to athletic director.  But one 21-year-old recounted incidents 
of abuse took place in 1987.  The brother, a member of the Capuchin 
Province, was fired in 1988, but rehired later that year on advice of 
the provincial council.  St. Lawrence's rector said the brother has 
been suspended from duty pending completion of an investigation.  
Another former priest and later principal, Gale Leifeld, accused of 
sexual abuse resigned in 1982 and is in treatment for his problem.  The 
local district attorney's office is investigating the allegations, and 
may bring felony charges of sexual misconduct and intimidation against 
Gardipee.  Officials have not decided whether the school's faculty 
should be charged with failure to report abuse.  The Capuchin order, as 
well, is conducting an internal inquiry, and urges others who say they 
were victims to contact them. 

The Lafayette (Ind.) Christian Coalition is petitioning city council 
members for the ban of an anti-homosexual discrimination ordinance.  
The petition was circulated for two weeks in churches and shopping 
centers, and bears 3,350 signatures.  If the law is passed, the city 
would be the first in the state with such a law. 

Violence against homosexuals has risen drastically since the passage of 
Colorado's state amendment prohibiting special gay-rights legislation, 
according to members of watchdog groups opposing the law.  Before 
election day, the Denver Anti-Violence Project said that cases of 
harassment or violence reported to them averaged only 12 per month, but 
in November they fielded 45 such calls, at least half of which they 
said were directly related to Amendment 2.  Many were never reported to 
police.  Among the offenses were verbal and physical intimidation, bomb 
threats, telephone death wishes, and vandalism.  National Gay and 
Lesbian Task Force officials, in light of the recent violence findings, 
have pushed for additional support for a tourism ban of the state until 
the amendment is reversed and the "hate crimes" stop. 

Elders at Calvary Church in Santa Ana, Calif., excommunicated ex-pastor 
David Hocking for his "unwillingness to submit" to the church's 
proposed discipline for a "sexual sin" (NIRR 10/19/92), the L.A. Times 
reported.  Calvary Church says the former senior pastor resisted 
efforts by the church restoration committee to help rebuild his 
marriage, and refused to submit to a "structure of accountablity" that 
would keep him from official duties in the church for a year.  Lance 
Sparks, pastor of family ministries, said the board members felt they 
had no other option because of Hocking's rebellion against church 
authority.  "We wanted to assure that there was true repentance...in 
all areas of his life," Sparks said.  Hocking said he was "shocked" and 
"confused" by the church decision, and denied his alleged unwillingness 
to cooperate with the board of elders.  He said his marriage is 
stronger than ever, and that Calvary Church never indicated to him that 
they wished to restore him.  "They didn't want me to come back to the 
ministry there," Hocking said. 
...Hocking has since moved to Chuck Smith's Calvary Chapel, in Costa 
Mesa, where he will begin full-time work as an education minister by 
mid- or late-January, according to L.E. Romaine, assistant pastor at 
Calvary Chapel.  The majority of Hocking's job will entail teaching, 
and perhaps some counseling.  Romaine said the church's goal for 
Hocking was "restoration," not discipline.  The church, highly 
supportive of Hocking, saw evidence of full repentance and "Christ's 
work within him," Romaine said.  He also indicated that Senior Pastor 
Chuck Smith would be "personally involved and have the final say" in 
Hocking's follow-up and full restoration to the ministry. 

Georgia should join six other states with laws against clerical sexual 
exploitation, Tricia Weeks and five other women told an Atlanta news 
conference.  They each claim to have been drawn into sexual 
relationships by Earl and Don Paulk, bishop and cofounder of Decatur's 
charismatic Chapel Hill Harvester Church, now the Cathedral of the Holy 
Spirit (NIRR 11/30/92).  The women say their reason for speaking out 
was to help, not hinder, the church, by showing the results of 
following a church "leader and not God."  Sunday service attendance has 
dropped severely since the first allegations were made public, but the 
Paulks continue to lead services at their church. Without explanation, 
Cathedral of the Holy Spirit also dropped a $24-million libel and 
slander suit against seven former members, including Weeks; the suit 
claimed loss of donations and membership because of the controversy. 

Jim Bakker was eligible for parole last spring under his latest 
sentence reduction from 18 to eight years.  But it's unlikely that 
he'll have a parole hearing until Jan. 29 at the earliest, said 
Bakker's attorney, James Toms.  In reconsidering the jail sentence 
length (NIRR 11/30/92), District Judge Graham Mullen said it seemed 
"unduly harsh."  Bakker has indicated that he would like to be paroled 
in Florida so he could be close to his son, Jamie Charles, and 
daughter, Tammy Sue, who is temporarily handling the ministry of New 
Covenant Church in Largo.  The judge also granted Bakker a brief visit 
to see his father who was hospitalized in Charlotte, N.C., for a broken 
hip sustained in an automobile accident.  The former PTL founder was 
grateful for the shorter sentence and being able to visit his family 
"at this time of need." 

"The devil couldn't take me out," Oral Roberts said of his recovery 
from a recent heart attack.  The Tulsa-based televangelist and 
university founder appeared back on his weekly televised church service 
just before Christmas, a bit thinner, but speaking of a personal 
renewal.  He said the chest pains he felt during his most recent heart 
attack were even more intense than the severe pain he'd experienced as 
a 17year-old with tuberculosis, but that his healing ministry would be 
improved by the trial.  Roberts said he was hit "like a hammer" by the 
words "to prosper and be in health" in his ministry's keystone verse, 3 
John 2.  Roberts said, "God is going to give me a special anointing" to 
reach those he could not previously reach.  He also said God showed him 
that the "master spirits of Satan" were released against him as never 
before, but a "wall of prayer" protected him from their attack.  His 
updated spiritual mission, he said, was to offer that same spiritual 
armor and anointing to others in need.  "I feel like God has spared my 
life, and partly for such an occasion as Christmas Day" when the 
ministry holds its day-long prayer meeting for supporters. 

Mormon Church President Ezra Taft Benson, 93, was hospitalized Jan. 1 
in Salt Lake City, Utah for pneumonia.  Benson, president of the 
8.3-million-member church since 1985 and former secretary of 
agriculture in the Eisenhower administration, has been in poor health 
for years. 

Admitted church arsonist Patrick Lee Frank was legally insane when he 
burned 16 churches in Florida and Tennessee (NIRR 12/14/92), a 
Gainesville, Fla., judge ruled last week in his trial.  Frank, a 
diagnosed schizophrenic, said the church buildings gave him homosexual 
feelings that could not be alleviated by merely slashing tires in the 
church parking lot or throwing rocks at the windows.  Frank was 
remanded to a federal mental health facility until a suitable state 
facility is found. 

The Virgin Mary sat here?  Maybe, Israeli archaeologists said upon 
unearthing a rare octagonal church outside Jerusalem.  Experts told 
reporters that fifth-century Christians likely built the structure 
where they believed the pregnant Mary rested on her way to Bethlehem.  
Tradition holds that Mary blessed the rock on which she sat, and a 
sixth-century life of historian Theodosius mentions a church built with 
funds from a rich woman named Iqilia that commemorates the location.  
The "Ancient Seat," as the shrine is known, has an elaborate mosaic 
floor of imported Italian stones, and is the largest (50 yards wide) 
and most impressive discovery of its type in Israel or abroad, said a 
spokeswoman.  Archaeologists hope to substantiate their beliefs by 
finding the actual rock within the ruins.  The site was discovered 
while the Israeli government was beginning to widen the highway to 
Jerusalem's southern entrance, and confirms the same route connected 
the two cities centuries ago.  Greek Orthodox officials have offered to 
pay for excavation, restoration, and preservation of the site. 
...An archaeologist in Caesarea claims to have found the grand palace 
of Herod the Great, best known for his slaughter of the innocents to 
prevent Christ's birth. Barbara Burrell of the University of Cincinnati 
found pottery that dates the palace dig to Herod's reign.  "Herod was 
the only one who could build a palace in the city he founded," she 
said.  "If the pottery belongs to his reign, he built the palace." 

Bitter controversy over publication of "The Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered" 
subsided this month as scholars at a conference on the Dead Sea Scrolls 
in New York made concessions to each other.  The book, published last 
fall, was authored by Robert Eisenman, chairman of religious studies at 
California State University, Long Beach, and Michael Wise, a Near 
Eastern languages expert at the University of Chicago.  It is 
subtitled: "The First Complete Translation and Interpretation of 50 Key 
Documents Withheld for Over 35 Years," but 19 leading researchers 
signed a letter denouncing the volume's claims as "laughable and 
dishonest," pointing out that half the 50 documents had been published 
previously.  Although the book set forth controversial interpretations 
of the data, the main issue was "scholarly dishonesty," said Emmanuel 
Tov, chief editor of the Dead Sea Scrolls Publication Project in 
Israel.  Critics said the book proved their earlier predictions that 
granting general access to the scrolls would lead to poor scholarship 
and the uncredited use of others' work.  At the New York conference, 
Wise stated he regretted omitting some necessary documentation and 
failing to credit some of his sources.  Notre Dame's James C. VanderKam 
responded with a formal announcement for the 19 signatories, including 
Tov.  "In light of Professor Wise's statement, and after obtaining 
additional information about the production of the book, [we] hereby 
retract [our letter] and all it implies," their statement said. Out of 
the conference also came a pledge to move ahead more rapidly on 
analysis and official publication of the remaining documents. 
...The Scrolls are coming to America in April, courtesy of the Israel 
Antiquities Authority.  Fragmentary scrolls from Jerusalem's 
Rockefeller Museum will be exhibited at the Library of Congress in 
Washington, D.C. for three months, Biblical Archaeology Review 
reported.  The 2,000-year-old scrolls then will move to the New York 
Public Library and a San Francisco museum.  At least one copy of the 
now-controversial MMT will likely be included.  Scholars say the MMT is 
a letter from the Teacher of Righteousness, an early leader of the sect 
who kept the scrolls.  A lawsuit by Ben-Gurion University professor 
Elisha Qimron seeks $200,000 from the Biblical Archaelogical Society.  
In 1991 BAS included a reconstructed Hebrew transcript of MMT in their 
book of many circulated but previously unpublished texts.  Qimron 
claims to own the copyright on the 120-line text pieced together from 
six incomplete versions of the MMT. 
...Qimron has hired Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz to 
spearhead his U.S. defense team in his lawsuit against BAS.  Dershowitz 
is known for his highpowered clientele, including Klaus von Bulow, Mike 
Tyson, and Leona Helmsley.  Dershowitz' assistance was a response to a 
suit filed in Philadelphia by BAS' representation Arnold & Porter, led 
by Daniel Rezneck.  The Washington, D.C., firm requested a federal 
court in September to declare that BAS had not violated any copyright 
with their reproduction of the MMT.  Qimron's original suit was filed 
in Israel, but BAS filed suit in the U.S. because Qimron is a research 
scholar at Philadelphia's Annenberg Research Institute this year. 

Many American adults are unable to spend the last year of their lives 
unassisted, says a new mortality study released by the National Center 
for Health Statisitics. More than 50% of those examined could not 
bathe, dress, walk, or use the toilet, and more than 33% could not feed 
themselves without special equipment or human help.  The 250-page study 
considered the last-year lives of Americans over the age of 24 who died 
in 1986.  The median death age was 74, so many of those studied were 
senior citizens.  Loneliness and poverty were also common findings.  
More than 25% lived alone, and more than 15% lived on less than $5,000 
a year, and owned no property or other assets.  Women were of special 
interest to researchers, because of their longer life spans.  Most had 
already outlived their husbands, and usually needed more help than men 
in the last year of their lives.  The report by Isadore Seeman, 76, 
indicated a longer life span in general, however, and even longer lives 
for those who exercise regularly and maintain preventative health care. 
...Suicide is a secret decision for most elderly people who decide to 
kill themselves, a Gallup survey found, and most succeed on the first 
try.  The poll was released at a health care professionals' conference 
in New York.  Of 802 surveyed Americans age 60 or older, only 1% 
indicated any kind of suicidal thoughts within the last six months.  
Still, the elderly, 26% of the general population, have the highest 
suicide rate, at 20.1 per 100,000 people, of any age group (65% higher 
than the national average), and their self-inflicted deaths are often 
unreported.  Gallup's poll and expert opinions showed senior citizens 
who killed themselves were less religious than others their age, rarely 
reveal their intentions (often in fear of institutionalization), and 
often have not sought help.  Other factors Gallup cited included low 
income, poor health, and lack of a social life.  Men were more likely 
to kill themselves than women, and were more likely to use guns.  Women 
most often overdosed on drugs or poisoned themselves.  But often older 
people, said those at the conference, often masked their suicide 
attempts by starving themselves or not taking medicine. Many of the 
elderly suicide victims had suffered untreated depression or other 
undiagnosed psychiatric illnesses, conference participants said. 
...The church ignores senior citizens, unless it needs their time or 
money, according to the National Interfaith Coalition on Aging (NICA).  
While churches will gladly accept financial donations or volunteer work 
from the elderly, they rarely accept their advice or implement their 
ideas, they said.  The select 39-member committee met at Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in America's Chicago headquarters to discuss the 
results of their study of the aging and church life.  Six faith groups 
were represented: A.M.E. Zion, National Association of the Church of 
God (Anderson, Ind.), Reformed Judaism, Roman Catholic Church, Southern 
Baptist Convention, and United Methodist Church.  In its summary, NICA 
urged churches to appreciate and involve seniors in various church 
activities, and to assist with their key problem areas -rising health 
care costs, economic difficulties, and worsening health. 

MISSION FOR THE 1990s: CHINESE REACHING CHINESE by Edward E. Plowman 

Chinese Christians must take greater responsibility for reaching other 
Chinese people around the world for Christ.  That was a central theme 
at the fourth triennial Chinese Mission conference, held between 
Christmas and New Year's Day in Washington, D.C.  The four-day meeting, 
patterned after InterVarsity Christian Fellowship's Urbana student 
missions conferences, attracted a record 1,300 registrants (most of 
Chinese descent) from 36 states and a number of foreign countries, plus 
several hundred Chinese church members from the Washington area who 
attended evening plenary sessions, organizers said.  It was sponsored 
by Ambassadors for Christ, a ChineseAmerican mission based in Paradise, 
Pa.  The majority of registrants were university students and recent 
graduates, but sizable numbers of pastors, parachurch and mission 
representatives, and lay workers took part as well, they added.  Some 
of the older registrants had spent years in prison for their faith 
before migrating from China. (Several students from mainland China also 
attended, but their identities were kept under wraps, sources said.  
One had been led to Christ by an American teacher of English in 
Guangzhou, they added.)  Participants could choose from dozens of 
workshops in English, Cantonese, or Mandarin each day, ranging from how 
to make the Christian faith palatable to intellectuals, developing 
strategies to reach local Chinatowns, and career and short-term 
opportunities in missionary work, to "The Challenge of Student Ministry 
in Taiwan" and "Understanding China Today."  On hand to chat informally 
were workers from about 40 missions and missions-related ministries. 
Those tending exhibit booths and literature tables (including one laden 
with materials in the simplified script used in China) reported brisk 
traffic.  Leaders introduced a new magazine aimed at students from 
mainland China. 
...Chinese Mission 92 apparently left deep imprints on many young 
participants, including recently wed Hong Kong citizens Eva and Owen 
Lau.  In their early 30s, they are living temporarily in Orlando, Fla., 
where Owen is completing a university program in computer science and 
Eva is a nurse.  They were among seven CM 92 participants from a 
200-member Chinese church in Orlando, where both were baptized not long 
ago.  As a result of the conference, the Laus told NIRR, they are 
seriously considering a career in missionary work. 
...China contains the largest unevangelized group of people in the 
world today, reminded David Adeney, a veteran missionary with Overseas 
Missionary Fellowship (OMF, formerly China Inland Mission).  Policies 
in the communist-run country could change this decade and its doors be 
opened to evangelism, he suggested, urging his listeners to be ready to 
seize the opportunity.  Some speakers prophesied that such change will 
come soon.  A leading expert on the religious situation in China, 
Adeney traced the history of repression under communism, told how the 
church had grown manyfold during those dark years, and summarized the 
complexities of the current church scene (lack of trained leadership 
and literature, divisions and false teachings within the independent 
house-church movement, and new government restrictions on evangelism, 
with the bulldozing of even some officially recognized churches). 
...The tombstone of J. Hudson Taylor, pioneer missionary to China, was 
discovered three years ago in the cluttered storage yard of a museum in 
Zhenjiang by his great grandson, James Hudson Taylor III, former head 
of OMF.  The graveyard where it stood had been razed years earlier, the 
younger Taylor said at a CM 92 plenary session.  He told of efforts by 
local believers and others to have the memorial stone mounted at 
another site.  Permission was granted, he said, but the museum director 
demanded $13,000 payment for the 26 years it had lain in the storage 
yard.  Pastors in China overseeing the restoration project recently 
informed the curator he could keep the grave marker, Taylor said.  In 
their letter, they said that what was etched in the hearts of people as 
a result of the ministry of the revered missionary who died in 1905 was 
more important than what was written on stone.

Sen. Bob Dole and Elizabeth Dole
stopped attending Foundry United Methodist Church, where President Clinton
and Hillary Rodham Clinton go to
church about twice a month. A friend said
the Doles considered pastor J. Philip
Wogaman too liberal and have been
attending evangelical churches in the
area. Wogaman embraces feminism and
has criticized the GOP's Contract With
America, news reports said.
<P>
Jurors deadlocked in the case of former
Washington trooper Lane Jackstadt
(NIRR 1/9/95). Justin Cooper and
Deanna Thomas accused Jackstadt of
stopping them for speeding, then coercing them to follow him to a pro-life counseling session. The pregnant teen-ager
and her boyfriend had been heading to
an appointment at a Planned Parenthood
clinic. Jackstadt, a self-described Christian and abortion foe, said he was trying
to help and the couple went along willingly. Prosecutors said they will not retry
Jackstadt, who was fired for allegedly
cheating on a promotion exam. 
<P>
Rachelle "Shelley" Shannon (NIRR
10/31/94) turned over "detailed accounts"
of anti-abortion activities to a federal task
force investigating a possible violent conspiracy by abortion opponents. She is
serving 11 years in prison for shooting
abortion doctor George Tiller outside his
clinic in Wichita, Kan. Shannon, 39, said
she regretted giving out too much information about herself and her friends in a
"selfish effort to save my own life."
<P>
Charles Moore, pastor of Grace United
Methodist Church in Austin, Texas, went
on a 15-day hunger strike to protest mistreatment -- "especially by church officials" -- of homosexuals. Moore, 60, who
is divorced and lives alone, has been a
pastor for 43 years. He said he is a heterosexual who ignored anti-gay discrimination for too long. Moore ended his
strike when UMC bishops released a
statement decrying rights violations
against homosexuals. They reiterated
church policy that homosexual activity is
"incompatible with Christian teaching." 
<P>
The feminist Episcopal Women's Caucus
rebuked former national church treasurer
Ellen Cooke (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/051595.html">NIRR 5/15</A>), who is accused of embezzling $2.2 million of
church funds. Cooke blamed her acts in
part on sexist pressures. The caucus
said sexism is no excuse for "actions that
were both illegal and immoral," and questioned the sincerity of her claim.
<P>
An essay arguing that the greatest sexual
freedom, joy, and intimacy come from
monogamous marriages won the $10,000
top prize in the Amy Foundation's 1994
writing competition. Author William Mattox, Jr., vice president of the Family Research Council in Washington, D.C.,
wrote the story, The Hottest Valentines.
<P>
Winners of the Dove Awards last month
in Nashville are: Steven Curtis Chapman for Artist of the Year, Male Vocalist
of the Year, and Songwriter of the Year;
Twila Paris for Female Vocalist of the
Year; 4HIM for Group of the Year; and
Clay Crosse for New Artist of the Year.
Song of the Year was God Is In Control
by Paris.
<P>
China accused the Dalai Lama, the exiled god-king of Tibetan Buddhism, of
overstepping his authority. The Dalai
Lama unilaterally recognized a 6-year-old
Tibetan as the 11th Panchen Lama,
whose influence is second only to that of
the Dalai Lama. Chinese officials rejected
the choice, saying Beijing has the right of
final approval. The Dalai Lama's defiance
of traditional rules is part of a conspiracy
to split the motherland, the Chinese said.
<P>
Recent outbreaks of spiritual renewal
across the nation should not be described as a "revival," researcher George
Barna cautioned. If revival means a
large-scale spiritual change of heart
among people who previously were not
Christian, statistics do not show revival is
under way, he said. The renewal has involved people who already have a religious commitment, but there is no evidence that it has spilled over into secular
culture, he said.

More than 1,000 people, including 180
children, accepted Christ during Franklin
Graham's May 14-17 Coastal Carolina
Crusade in Wilmington, N.C. Some
23,000 people attended at Trask Coliseum on the campus of the University of
North Carolina. Billy Graham Evangelistic
Association associate evangelist John
Wesley White preached two daytime
services, and children's evangelist Leisha
Campbell held a Saturday service for
1,000 children. 
<P>
St. Meinrad (Ind.) School of Theology
fired Catholic nun Carmel McEnroy, 59,
from her 14-year teaching post. She violated church law by signing a letter criticizing Pope John Paul II's refusal to allow women to become priests, school
officials said.
<P>
Promise Keepers, begun by Protestant
evangelicals, is attracting Catholics and
Mormons as well. Local Catholic priests
led a PK seminar for 100 men at a parish
in Los Angeles. Also, Cardinal Roger
Mahoney is determining whether PK
events are appropriate for other Catholic
parishes, the Los Angeles Times said.
Chip Rawlings and fellow Los Angeles
Mormon leaders urged members of the
Latter-day Saints to participate in the
movement. Promise Keepers' Seven
Promises are "like something straight out
of the men's priesthood manual for the
church," he told the Times.
<P>
A self-esteem company sued the Mormon church for $189 million. William and
Jannette Birely, owners of Life Management International, blamed their loss of
business on church leader M. Russell
Ballard. At a church conference last year,
Ballard warned against involvement with
groups that "purport to increase selfawareness, raise self-esteem, and enhance individual agency." He urged them
to anchor themselves instead in principles and practices of their faith. Church
officials declined to comment on the suit.
<P>
The evangelistic film The Crossing is
bringing teen-agers to Christ, Denverbased Youth For Christ said. The 30minute movie was written and directed by
YFC's Bill Muir and produced by Gospel
Films. It is part of YFC's Take One campaign in which Christian teens invite nonChristian friends to view the film and then
attend church. Some 1,200 churches are
participating in the campaign. YFC's goal
is to recruit 10,000 churches and ministries to participate by Easter 1995. For
information, call 1-800-735-3252.
<P>
An expected 2,284 young people will
travel to 14 countries this summer on
mission trips organized by Teen Mania
Ministries. Destinations include Albania,
Ghana, Hong Kong, India, China, Botswana, Thailand, Morocco, and Cameroon. For information call 918-495-1891.
<P>
Gifts to U.S. Protestant churches rose
3.5% in 1993, the 1995 Yearbook of
American & Canadian Churches said.
More than two-thirds of 37 Protestant denominations that reported figures saw
increased giving. Among the 15 largest
denominations, gifts to the United Methodist Church grew the most, 6.6%. The
UMC had the sharpest drop in membership, 1.6%. Membership in U.S. Protestant churches was unchanged from 1992
to 1993, with the churches reporting 42.3
million members. Membership in Canadian churches fell 2.3% to 2.6 million.
<P>
Wisconsin Lutherans began a gunsafety program. Calling themselves Fathers for a Safer Janesville, men from St.
John Lutheran Church delivered 1,000
gun locks and literature on gun safety to
area residents. The men also put up billboards proclaiming a gun-safety message. The fathers, who raised nearly
$9,000 to finance the effort, plan to repeat the program.  
<P>
California's juvenile correction agency
agreed to remove religious themes from
its largest drug treatment project in an
attempt to settle lawsuits. Teachers at a
Stockton school for drug offenders sued
the California Youth Authority last December to halt use of the Design for Living course, a program based on the 12step Alcoholics Anonymous model. The
American Civil Liberties Union also sued
on behalf of two of the course's 400 students, saying the program's themes violated separation of church and state.
<P>
Last Days Ministries is downsizing
and decentralizing. The Lindale, Texas,
ministry blamed shortages of funds and
staff. It publishes Last Days Magazine,
which challenges readers to radical
Christian discipleship. LDM plans to cut
its staff from 140 to 35, relocate its headquarters to California, and sell some of
its land and equipment. Most of the staff
leaving LDM are joining other ministries
of Youth With A Mission, which LDM
joined four years ago. The late Christian
singer Keith Green and his wife, Melody,
founded LDM in 1977. She and her second husband, Andrew Sievright, still work
for the ministry.
<P>
Abortions among New Jersey mothers
on welfare increased slightly after the
state's "family cap" welfare reform went
into effect, a state study showed. Under
the cap, mothers on welfare do not receive an increase in their monthly check
if they have another baby. In the eight
months after the cap took effect in August 1994, welfare abortions increased
from 7,619 during the same period a year
earlier to 7,932. That means the abortion
rate rose from 9.43 per 1,000 women to
9.78. Pro-life and pro-choice leaders alike
denounced the cap.

Egypt: The government asked Muslim
preachers not to mention a U.S. proposal
to move the American embassy in Israel
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Cairo wants
to avoid fanning anti-American sentiment
among Muslims, especially militant fundamentalists, Muslim clergy told reporters.
<P>
Zaire: Missionaries must observe a strict
quarantine in parts of Zaire affected by
the Ebola virus outbreak. Four Italian
Catholic nuns in northwestern Zaire died
after treating victims in hospitals, a
spokesman for the Little Sisters of the
Poor order said. Missionaries say the
disease also wiped out villages in remote
southern Sudan. Pat Robertson's relief
agency, Operation Blessing, delivered a
planeload of medical and other supplies
to Kinshasa (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6</A>).

Armenia: Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, and Pentecostals in the city of
Yerevan were arrested and detained for
several hours after Easter services, Baptist leaders in Russia said. Details were
sketchy, and it is not known if church
documents and vehicles seized in the
raids were returned. It was unclear who
ordered the arrests, but authorities in the
predominantly Armenian Orthodox country promised to investigate, Baptist officials said.
<P>
China: Seventh-day Adventists conducted their first live broadcast to China using
a new 100,000-kilowatt transmitter in
Guam. Programs will air in four Chinese
languages. Some 200,000 Chinese are
Adventists, the church reported.
<P>
Israel: A youth firebombed a church in
the Garden of Gethsemane, igniting the
organ and a rug. Police found three more
firebombs the youth left before fleeing,
officials said. A friar was doused with
kerosene but escaped uninjured. 
<P>
Israel: The government will seize 140
acres of land, most owned by Arabs, to
build Jewish neighborhoods in eastern
Jerusalem. The announcement sparked
an international furor. The sheik who
heads al-Azhar mosque and university in
Cairo, the world's most prestigious Islamic institution, called the move an "act of
aggression." The government also canceled plans to seize land from a Catholic
monastery in eastern Jerusalem. 
<P>
North Korea: The government will accept 470 tons of food from World Vision
International. The food will feed needy
women and children. It is the first significant aid provided by a Western relief
group to be allowed into North Korea.
Acceptance of the aid could be an important symbolic act on the part of the North
Korean government, observers said.
World Vision said it hopes the $93,000
effort will promote reconciliation between
North and South Korea.
<P>
Pakistan: Evangelist Marilyn Hickey
taught and preached to 1,000 pastors
and 20,000 laypeople during a five-day
crusade in Lahore. Pastors from all over
the country, who are members of many
denominations, attended daily sessions,
Marion Neiser of Marilyn Hickey Ministries told NIRR. Each night, Hickey
preached about the miracles of Jesus,
then had students from the training sessions minister to the crowd.   
<P>
Saudi Arabia: More than 1.5 million
Muslims made this year's annual hajj, or
pilgrimage, to Mecca. About two-thirds
came from outside Saudi Arabia. All Muslims are required by their faith to make
the journey at least once in their lifetime,
if they are able. Many make the pilgrimage in General Motors Suburbans, a
large, eight-cylinder sport-utility vehicle.
To reduce traffic jams to the holy city,
Saudi Arabia requires pilgrims to use
vehicles that seat nine or more people.
Few other vehicles qualify. 
<P>
Saudi Arabia: Authorities shut down 30
schools for foreigners run by diplomatic
missions in Riyadh. About 10,000 expatriate children, mostly Asians and Africans,
were affected. Diplomats blamed closures on the religious police, who said 
the schools were proselytizing. Regulations bar the schools from teaching beyond the ninth grade, require boys and
girls to be segregated, and dictate that
Islamic and Arabic studies be taught.
<P>
Vietnam: Hanoi hinted it will ease restrictions on religious groups, the Communist
Party's newspaper reported. Officials
warned however that foreign religious
communities must respect Vietnam's
sovereignty on issues of religion.

The AG has 400 organized and 800

there were 317 churches and home
churches, AG officials said.

Colombia: Satan worshipers are infiltrating church meetings to entice visitors to

reported. Some 17 satanic groups are

Bosnia: Catholic officials blame Serbian
Orthodox refugees from Croatia for killing
some 400 Catholics and destroying 40
churches in three years in the Serb
stronghold of Banja Luka. Charred bodies
of a priest and nun were found in the ruins of a Catholic church in the area. 
<P>
Ireland: A law allowing doctors to give
patients the names of abortion clinics in
Britain and elsewhere is constitutional,
the Supreme Court ruled. Pro-life groups
protested that the law promotes abortion,
which is illegal in the predominantly Catholic nation. 
<P>
Italy: European Protestant and Catholic
leaders admitted shame for past religious
persecution of each other. They called for
an end to mistrust and a greater display
of unity as Christianity approaches its
third millennium. The message was
signed by leaders of the 118-member
Conference of European Churches and
the Catholic Council of European
Bishops' Conferences. They met at a
three-day conference near Assisi, Italy, to
plan a European ecumenical assembly in
1997 in Austria.
<P>
Poland: The government will let Jews
reclaim property that was nationalized
after World War II. Communal Jewish
property such as synagogues, schools,
and cemeteries will be reinstated at no
charge. Only government-owned properties are affected, not those in the hands
of individuals. The Nazis killed 3 million
Polish Jews, and thousands of others left
the country during the communist reign.
A few thousand Jews remain in Poland.
<P>
Scotland: Secularism, apathy, and a
sense of self-sufficiency are reasons
people are leaving the Church of Scotland, a study by the church found. In
1980, 28% of adults belonged to the
church; by 1993, membership declined to
19%, the national mission board told the
church's annual assembly this month. 
<P>
Scotland: Religious leaders should be
more forgiving when people stray from
their marriage vows, said the Anglican
Bishop of Edinburgh, Richard Holloway.
Endowed by God with "promiscuous
genes," they are only following a built-in
urge "to go out and propagate as widely
as possible," he said. The church should
not condemn affairs as sinful and wrong,
but instead help people control their instincts, he added. "Adultery is a sin,"
Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey
responded.

Christian leaders are scrambling to protect their organizations from
further damage after the collapse of the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy.
More than 300 nonprofits, many of which are evangelical ministries and colleges,
as well as scores of wealthy donors are affected. An unknown number of
churches also stand to lose large amounts. They placed tens of millions of dollars
with Radnor, Pa.-based New Era in a purported matching-grant program.
<BR>...New Era filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy this month after the Securities and
Exchange Commission declared its program a Ponzi scheme. The court listed an
estimated $80 million in assets and $551 in liabilities, half or more apparently in
matching-grant pledges. Financial analysts called it the biggest nonprofit collapse
in recent U.S. history and the worst to hit the evangelical community. 
<BR>...Early participants were paid by deposits of later investors, the SEC said.
Further, New Era's head, John "Jack" G. Bennett, Jr., had diverted at least $5
million in consulting fees to his private business accounts, bankruptcy trustee
John T. Carroll, III, told The Wall Street Journal. The Pennsylvania attorney
general filed fraud charges, and the FBI and IRS launched inquiries. Former New
Era workers said they will talk only if granted immunity. Carroll said funds had
been commingled, records were in shambles, and important documents were
missing. An audit to determine the true financial picture may take months.
Bankruptcy Judge Bruce Fox indicated he was trying to protect remaining assets
from lawyers duplicating each other's work.
<BR>..."Those of you who know us, know that we would never have done
anything other than enable you to grow and flourish," Bennett said in a letter to
New Era investors. "My sole desire is to do everything possible to see that the
obligations we have to you are fulfilled...I hope that an attitude of objectivity
will prevail, as distinct from the rush to judgment which has characterized much
of the media accounts and editorial comment." Miller, Alfano, and Raspanti, the
law firm representing Bennett, declined to speak to NIRR. 
<BR>...Christian groups and donors risk more than losing most of their money
on deposit, more than $100 million by some estimates. Under "fraudulent
conveyance" laws, they also face having to return the millions paid out in
matching and other grants, Paul Nelson, president of the Evangelical Council for
Financial Accountability, told NIRR. More than 100 of ECFA's 800 members
could be affected, he said. ECFA has organized a task force, United Response to
New Era, to coordinate legal and financial strategies for its member ministries.
Also at risk are ministries and churches that had no direct links to New Era, but
because of donor designations received unsolicited grants, which they may have
to repay. Some groups and churches listed as recipients said they never received
a dime from New Era and had never heard of the group.
<BR>...Within the Coalition for Christian Colleges and Universities, 14 of 80
schools deposited about $25 million in New Era, CCCU president Robert
Andringa said. The group put $350,000 of its own money in New Era, he added.
<BR>...The prospect of turned-off donors plus Christian organizations pitted
against each other in court is something to fear in the aftermath, donor consultant
Gordon Loux, a former ECFA head and ministry leader, told NIRR. He said he
hoped that givers will stand by the causes they've supported, and that ministry
boards will chart an honorable way out of the morass.
<BR>...Bennett, 57, an evangelical with a background in financial consulting,
set up New Era in 1989. Although "foundation" is part of its name, it was a
nonprofit charity, officials said. Its chief activity in the beginning was to dispense fund-raising advice to other nonprofits and corporate donors. The role
gained Bennett access to many prominent people of wealth, including mutual
fund wizard Sir John Templeton and his son John, Jr., a pediatric surgeon in
Philadelphia. Templeton invited Bennett in 1990 to serve on the boards of two
dozen mutual funds. In 1992, Bennett began spreading the word that an anonymous philanthropist was willing to back worthy causes with matching grants
through New Era, reports said. Applicants had to meet certain qualifications, put
up at least $25,000, and leave their money with New Era for six months, a New
Era prospectus said. In time, the anonymous donors grew to seven. Bennett told
his staff on May 13 that the seven donors did not exist, reports said.
<BR>...Among the first to test the waters was Glenn Blossom, pastor of 1,300member Chelten Baptist Church in suburban Philadelphia. Blossom, prominent in
the Conservative Baptist Association, was struggling to raise funds for a CBA
school he started, Seminary of the East in Dresher, Pa. He persuaded backers to
give $500,000; six months later, a check arrived from New Era matching the
amount. Blossom, 49, became one of the program's supporters. He set up a
foundation of his own as a conduit for the funds. (His foundation was listed as
being owed $27.5 million. Actual deposits are thought to be much less. Sources
say CBA missions and headquarters agencies have more than $2 million in the
program. Numerous CBA churches and donors account for millions more. Some
churches deposited entire building funds.)
<BR>...Word about New Era spread rapidly in development circles. Board
members of nonprofits who investigated found it had never missed a payment.
Its financial statements seemed in order. Other ministries issued glowing testimonials. Bennett certainly seemed to have ties to billionaire Templeton. Former
Treasury Secretary William Simon, financier Laurance S. Rockefeller, and other
prominent benefactors had turned to New Era to increase the amount of funds
they gave away. Matching grants were a familiar tool in fund-raising. Even the
Pew Charitable Trusts, the Maclellan Foundation, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and
other savvy groups joined the action. Many boards concluded it would be foolish
not to participate. New Era's 1993 IRS report showed $36 million was paid out.
Triple that amount flowed back into New Era during 1994, Bennett said.
<BR>...Then it all came tumbling down. Albert J. Meyer, 44, an accounting professor at Spring Arbor (Mich.) College, works part-time on the college's books. He
spotted a July 1993 entry of $294,000 that was deposited with a New Era
intermediary. Meyer says he investigated and concluded that New Era was a
Ponzi scam. College officials did not heed his warnings and put down $1 million. His letter to the SEC last month prompted that agency's investigation.
<BR>...Unknown to its clients, New Era had a brokerage account of about $60
million with Prudential Securities. Prudential said Bennett had an outstanding
loan balance of $44 million against the account. As a result of the SEC inquiry,
Prudential launched its own investigation of Bennett. After he refused to answer
questions, the brokerage liquidated the account to get back its loan. The Wall
Street Journal broke the story May 15 and a flood of news coverage followed.
<BR>...Many nonprofits declined to disclose the exact amounts they have on
deposit at New Era, or the amounts of grants, if any, they received earlier. Only
the amounts owed to those on the top-20 list of largest creditors were published.
In most cases, the actual amounts at risk are about half. For example, Lancaster
(Pa.) Bible College says that its real figure is "several million" below the $16.9
million listed. Some groups apparently subtracted grants already received from
the balance. Wheaton College says its "net" amount outstanding is $730,000, not
the $4.6 million listed. (It has $2.05 million on deposit, the school said.) Other
creditors and amounts listed by the court include: Gordon-Conwell Seminary,
$9.8 million; Maclellan Foundation, $8.5 million; Philadelphia College of Bible,
$8 million; Whitworth College, $7 million.
<BR>...Some actual amounts reported include: Biblical Seminary, $635,000;
Christian Men, $4.9 million; English Language Institute, $500,000; Inter-Varsity
Christian Fellowship, $1 million; International Teams, $2.5 million; Menno
Haven retirement home, $1 million; Mercy Corps, $100,000; Messiah College,
$2 million; World Vision, $1.5 million; Young Life International, $2.5 million.
<BR>...If the nonprofits obeyed New Era's restriction that only special project
funds could be used in the program, their operating budgets would not be
affected. One small ministry, World Christian, acknowledged it sent $50,000 -one-third of its annual budget -- to New Era, which had promised a $100,000
grant. Anticipating the grant's arrival in July, the ministry borrowed money,
added staff, and expanded programs. New Era's collapse is "devastating," a
World Christian spokesman said in an open letter on the Internet.

One hundred thousand South Korean university students dedicated themselves to global evangelism May 20. They sat in a pouring rain in the Seoul
Olympic Stadium and promised to bring renewal to their colleges, work toward
reunification with North Korea, and take the gospel to unreached people. The
event, called Student Mission 2000, was part of AD 2000 and Beyond
Movement's Global Consultation On World Evangelism (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/050195.html">NIRR 5/1</A>), the largest
conference on world evangelism ever held.
<BR>...The world must have "a church for every people and the gospel for
every person" by the end of the year 2000, insisted Luis Bush, international
director of AD 2000 and Beyond. Christian workers came from 200 nations to
hear fresh ideas, acquire new resources, and gain encouragement for the push
toward the goal. "It can be done, it ought to be done, it must be done," Bush
said, quoting evangelist D.L. Moody. 
<BR>...A "rapid acceleration of divine activity" is creating new opportunities for
the gospel, Bush told delegates. The fall of communism in Eastern Europe and a
waning of secular humanism in the West means "we are moving from an age of
unbelief to an unprecedented age of faith," he said. Evangelists will try to begin
church-planting ministries in each of the 2,500 least-evangelized ethno-linguistic
people groups by the end of the year 2000. They will focus on groups in the
heavily Muslim and Hindu nations in the 10/40 Window (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/012395.html">NIRR 1/23</A>). 
<BR>...Some 4,000 delegates, more "than any other gathering in Christian
history," attended GCOWE '95, Bush said. Not even during the 1988 Summer
Olympic Games were there "so many nations and so many distinguished guests,"
an organizer said. Two-thirds came from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the
Middle East. Some 170 delegates came from India, sacrificing the equivalent of
several months wages to pay air fare. Women, who are playing an increasing
role in evangelism, comprised 25% of the participants. The South Korean church,
one of the "most vigorous and mature" in the world, organizers said, donated
$3.5 million to host the May 17-25 conference.

Revival is spreading through internment camps in Guantanamo Bay.
Tom Willey of World Relief told NIRR that 40% of the 19,000 Cubans in the
camps are evangelical Christians. Pastors and lay leaders are spreading the
"completely spontaneous" revival; relief workers are not allowed to evangelize.
An 18-year-old girl launched more than 15 congregations. Approximately 1,000
people have been baptized in two months, and on Sunday there are "hundreds
spread all over the field" outside the Protestant chapel, Willey said.
<BR>...Those who make it to the United States bring the excitement with them.
"You can tell who they are -- they glow," a pastor told Willey. He estimated that
3,000 evangelical Christians have come to Florida from the camps. Many of
them are doctors, engineers, and military officers who possess "leadership
potential" to bring awakening to churches in Miami, he said.

Churches in Haiti are experiencing "incredible growth," pastors and
missions leaders say. Repression by the former government and the U.S. embargo stirred political and social turmoil that is leading people to seek refuge in
God, Ignace Augustine told NIRR. He is a pastor and president of Bethany
Evangelical Mission of Haiti, an agency formed by Haitians who pastor churches
begun by the Minneapolis-based Bethany Mission. BEMH has grown from four
to 32 churches in 10 years. 
<BR>...Churches prayed ardently and God began to "manifest His power," said
Augustine, whose church grew by 200 people in three years. Often, entire
families convert, according to Rick Jacobsen, the Caribbean representative for the
mission. In Port au Piment, many politicians and businessmen became Christians
during a revival after church leaders prayed every night for a year, he said.
Belief in the occult remains strong, but some are leaving spiritism.

Some 1,000 blacks, whites, Asians, Hispanics, and Native Americans
worshiped together in a Mobile, Ala., service that participants say is tearing
down entrenched racial and denominational barriers. Gulf Coast Power of Prayer
'95 took place May 15 at the Mobile Convention Center. Richard Nichols, pastor
of the predominantly black, full-gospel Antioch Christian Church, said Christians
from various backgrounds were "weeping, crying, and pouring out their hearts
for unity," and speakers on the platform were "taking the mask off and getting
real." The service included brief prayers and exhortations by pastors, a citywide
choir, and a spontaneous foot-washing among those on the podium. Television
stations in Mobile and Montgomery broadcast the service live.
<BR>...Racism permeates the church in Mobile, leaders said. The attitude
among too many Christians has been that "blacks make good eunuchs in the
temple -- singing and serving, but are not good enough to speak on the platform," Nichols told NIRR. "Everybody who has that spirit is going to have to
confront it or move out of the Body," he said. Pastors who decry racism "behind
closed doors" can't be afraid to mention it from their pulpits, Nichols said.
Empty talk about reconciliation "eases the consciences," but fails to deter racism,
said Stuart Roth of Sonlight Broadcasting Systems, who led the event. 
<BR>...A group of area pastors and leaders is taking steps to bring the problem
into the open. Pastors plan to meet monthly, link their congregations as interracial sister churches, and hold joint worship services. Roth also is planning more
Gulf Coast Power of Prayer services. "There's a fire here that I believe is going
to be powerful," he said.

A spiritual renewal movement among pastors' wives is growing. International Renewal Ministries of Portland, Ore., which has run more than 200 of the
four-day Pastors' Prayer Summits (NIRR 3/20/95) in six years, also has begun
Pastors' Wives Prayer Summits. Seven such spiritual getaways have taken place
and others are planned. The conferences are times of "confession, brokenness,
repentance, forgiveness, reconciliation, restoration, renewal, and revival," according to Terry Dirks, IRM vice president.
<BR>...The wives are prone to mental, physical, and emotional exhaustion,
said Jane Brown, who facilitated a Pastors' Wives Summit in the Pacific Northwest this spring. "Some came with an anger toward God, some with deep
wounds, yet there was an honesty, an openness -- no resistance to the Spirit's
work," she said. IRM also led two Women in Ministry Leadership Prayer Summits to give women pastors and other ministry leaders "an extended time in the
presence of God," Dirks said. For information call (503) 251-6455.

The Oklahoma City bombing brought two downtown congregations closer
together -- literally. Members of Trinity Baptist Church invited the congregation
of the badly damaged First United Methodist Church to share Trinity's facilities.
It's a "tailor-made" fit, Trinity pastor Keith Arledge said. Trinity has a large
complex, but its aging congregation has been shrinking. Both churches are
evangelical, operate outreaches, decided to remain downtown, and have similar
praise-centered worship styles, he said.
<BR>...Each Sunday, the Methodists use the sanctuary while the Baptists are
in Sunday school -- then the Baptists use it while the Methodists are in Sunday
school. First Methodist also can use the facilities during the week, and a Methodist staffer attends Trinity staff meetings to coordinate schedules.

Korean-American Christians in New York City are disciplined and enthusiastic in their outreach to the city (NIRR 10/3/94). Most of New York's 450
Korean congregations hold prayer services early every morning, according to Hi
Seon Lee, assistant pastor of the nondenominational Korean Church of Queens.
At his church, 500 people pray from 5:30 a.m. to 6:30 a.m.. Each Friday, 100
members spend an additional hour handing out gospel tracts and singing in an
early-morning choir outside Main Street subway stations in the Flushing section
of the borough. Commuters in the multiracial neighborhood are more receptive to
the gospel before work than after, Lee said. "They meet us before they meet all
the pressures, noise, and depression of the day," he told NIRR.
<BR>...At least one member of Lee's congregation is praying every hour of the
day, all year long. Members choose a time to pray, then indicate their commitment on a large chart that divides the week into 168 hourly blocks.

Some 1,000 United Methodists denounced beliefs and practices they say
have created a crisis in their denomination. The self-described centrists, members
of the Confessing Movement in the UMC (NIRR 5/16/94), condemned "private
versions of the faith" that make the denomination "incapable of confessing with
one voice the orthodox trinitarian faith." The group said some members of the
church are "experimenting with pagan ritual and practice," enjoying wealth
without regard for the poor, and accepting sexual promiscuity, divorce, homosexual practice, and abortion.
<BR>...Organizers of the movement hope the manifesto will renew the church.
Some 13,000 people have signed it, they said. Retired bishop William Cannon of
Atlanta, President Maxie Dunnam of Asbury Seminary, and theologian Thomas
Oden of Drew University's School of Theology convened the meeting, which
was held in Atlanta.

A schismatic Episcopal congregation in Spokane, Wash., must give its
building back to the local diocese, a judge ruled in a preliminary injunction. Last
month, most of Holy Trinity Church's 212 members denounced their denomination for embracing liberal theology. This month they joined the Antiochian
Orthodox faith. Episcopal Bishop Jeff Terry sued to prevent church members
from worshiping any longer at Holy Trinity. Judge Kathleen O'Connor said civil
courts must accept decisions made by church hierarchy in such cases.

Another schism is racking the Worldwide Church of God (NIRR 3/20/95).
About 100 of the Pasadena, Calif.-based church's 350 pastors left and organized
a new denomination called the United Church of God. Many Worldwide Church
of God pastors have resigned or been fired because they cannot accept the
church's movement toward mainstream Christianity, the church said.
<BR>...Last year, the Worldwide Church of God repudiated teachings of its
founder, Herbert W. Armstrong, and embraced more mainstream concepts,
including the Trinity and salvation through grace alone. The departure of pastors
was viewed as a major setback to efforts to stem the loss of members and
money, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The Christian Coalition's Contract With the American Family aims to
"ensure that Washington values families," coalition leader Ralph Reed told a
Capitol Hill news conference. The contract calls for a constitutional amendment
to allow religious expression in schools and other public places. Among other
agenda items: eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and transfer most of
its money to local school boards; promote school choice through vouchers and
tuition tax credits; restrict pornography on cable TV and the Internet; limit lateterm abortions and curtail government funding of abortion; protect parental
rights; boost charities as an alternative to welfare.
<BR>...At a news conference a few blocks away, a separate group of opposition
leaders said the contract threatens religious freedom, families, and the poor. Days
later, 75 Protestant and Catholic leaders warned that ties between the religious
right and Republicans in Washington constitute "a dangerous liaison of religion
with political power." They called for "new solutions" rooted in local communities and moral values. Backers included heads of mainstream Protestant denominations, Catholic bishops, and evangelicals Tony Campolo and Ron Sider.

of Republicans said they were part of the religious right, so did 16% of all
Democrats. Only one-third of all respondents who described themselves as "bornagain" also professed a religious right connection.

Citing sharp increases in violence, suicides, and poverty among juveniles, a study said America's most pressing domestic need is re-establishment of
a "culture of marriage." The report was released by a panel of educators, publicpolicy experts, and family advocates for the New York-based Institute for
American Values. It lists four goals aimed at shifting cultural values and public
policy toward strengthening marriages: (1) Reclaim the concept of permanent
marriages and affirm marriage as the best environment for raising children; (2)
Decide that out-of-wedlock child-rearing is wrong, that every child needs a father
in the home, and that divorce is too common; (3) Resolve to increase the number
of children raised in two-parent families and decrease the number who are not;
and (4) Resolve that parents will spend more time with their children.
<BR>...The worsening situation among juveniles corresponds with the increase
in nonmarital births, from 5.3% in 1950 to more than 30% today, the 22-page

Islamic fundamentalists in northern Sudan are kidnapping Christian and
animist children, the Puebla Institute reported. Children are taken to camps and
given Islamic names, taught the Koran, conscripted into military service, and
forced to fight their own countrymen, the Catholic human-rights group said. The
actions are part of a "cultural cleansing campaign" conducted by the militant
Muslim government to Islamicize the children, Kevin Vigilante, a physician who
led the Puebla trip, told NIRR. Soldiers raid northern cities, picking up unaccompanied male children with darker, southern features. In one instance, radicals
kidnapped children from their homes while their parents were away. Because of
the civil war, many Sudanese from the south have relocated to the north.
<BR>...The children, most aged 11-15, are taken to re-education camps, Vigilante said. He interviewed clergy, relief workers, families of recovered children,
and government officials, and visited deserted camps. Radicals give the children
inadequate food, beat them for minor offenses, and beat them severely for trying
to escape, Vigilante said. The Sudanese government denied the charges.

The government of Turkey is intimidating Iranian Christians, an Americanbased ministry to Iranian Christians reported. Because of the intense persecution
of converts from Islam, Christians often flee to Turkey seeking refugee status
and resettlement in the West. But because of the "intimidation of Turkish
authorities," some Christians are afraid to apply for refugee status. Others stay in
Iran and "put up with the persecution," said a spokesman for the ministry, which
requested anonymity. Christians often are abused verbally during their exit interviews and forced to live in "fanatical Muslim towns" where they have to worship
in secret, he said. 
<BR>...The ministry provides food and clothing and helps prepare documents
for families awaiting rulings on their refugee status. During that process, which
can take eight months, the refugees cannot work or move freely within the
country. Several applicants have been refused and some repatriated to Iran, the
spokesman said. The U.S. State Department has been unresponsive to his requests to become involved in the process.

Gene patenting usurps "ownership rights of the Sovereign of the universe," Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention said. He was part of an
interfaith coalition of 187 religious leaders who urged the government to ban the
patenting of human genes and genetically engineered animals. The leaders
included Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus. They said
at a Washington, D.C., news conference that they do not oppose genetic research,
biotechnology, or the patenting of drugs, but oppose ownership of life. "This is
the beginning of an historic discussion," social activist Jeremy Rifkin said. "Is
life God's creation, or is life a human invention?" 
<BR>...Biotechnology and drug companies said patents are essential if they
are to make progress in finding cures to diseases. Without patent protection,
companies could not fund the genetic research that has led to biotechnical drugs
that treat such diseases as cystic fibrosis and heart disease, an industry spokesman said. "An ill-thought-out scare campaign could stall a breakthrough and
doom us to further unnecessary suffering," said Joan Samuelson, president of the
Parkinson's Action Network.
<BR>...Patenting provides 17 years of protection from competitors seeking to
commercialize discoveries. The U.S. Patent Office announced in 1987 that any
genetically altered animal, human gene, cell, or organ could be patented. It
issued the first animal patent in April 1988 -- for a genetically engineered mouse
used for cancer research that contained genes found in human beings, chickens,
and other animals. The office reportedly has granted patents on nine animals and
has requests on another 200.

Operation Rescue's leader and "Jane Roe" of the Roe v. Wade decision
have become friends. Every Thursday through Saturday, minister Flip Benham
leads OR protests against the abortion clinic in Dallas where Norma McCorvey
(a.k.a. Jane Roe) is marketing director. On Mondays and Tuesdays, when there
are no clinic appointments, they often sit together on a bench and chat, the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram reported. They joke, exchange pleasantries, and talk about
their beliefs. The Planned Parenthood clinic and OR are headquartered in the
same office building. When OR moved there in March, McCorvey told reporters
she feared there might be violence (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/041795.html">NIRR 4/17</A>).
<BR>..."I like her a lot. We come from the same era," said Benham, an alcoholic
and saloon owner in Florida before becoming a Christian. McCorvey was a 21year-old carnival worker when she became pregnant from a casual affair and
sought an abortion. (The Supreme Court decision came after she gave birth and

On May 4, Americans around the country prayed for God to send revival."There is no hope
other than divine intervention from the Lord," said Shirley Dobson, chairman of the National
Day of Prayer Task Force. At least 1.5 million believers prayed in 15,000 noontime and
evening rallies in churches, parks, and stadiums, Ken Waggoner, executive director of the
NDP Task Force, told NIRR. 
<BR>...In Chicago, a nationally televised prayer meeting gripped worshipers at Moody Memorial
Church. About 130 key denominational and parachurch leaders, as well as musicians Michael
Card and CeCe Winans, led the stirring concert of prayer. Chicago's WCFC-TV broadcast the
three-hour event, beamed by satellite to more than 2,000 cable companies and two-thirds of
the nation's Christian television stations. A thousand radio stations, as well as Armed Forces
Radio, picked up the feed from Moody Broadcasting Services, which collaborated with the
SkyLight Satellite Network. Meanwhile, in churches around the country, believers worshiped
as they watched the telecast. There has been "nothing like it in the history of the church in
the United States," said Paul Cedar, president of the Evangelical Free Church of America. 
<BR>..."We are going to struggle with God tonight on behalf of the land we love," said Robert
Bakke, head of National Prayer Advance, which initiated the event. Revival stalls when
Christians refuse to repent, speakers said. Those who are unrepentant misjudge the absolute
holiness of God, they warned. "When you and I sin, we trample under foot the Son of God
and we despise the Holy Spirit," said the Southern Baptist Convention's Henry Blackaby.
<BR>...Several speakers singled out racism as a particularly despicable and devastating sin. "Oh,
Lion of Judah, forgive us. Let the walls come down," prayed Raleigh Washington, pastor of
Rock of Our Salvation Church and a leader in the black community. Leaders also asked
forgiveness for their "denominational pride." Others spoke of the blight of abortion. Still
others asked God to protect families, the powerless, widows, orphans, and the elderly. Joseph
Stowell, president of Moody Bible Institute, called on Christians to pray that "God will be put
back in His proper place in the world of ideas" in culture and society. 
<BR>...During the service, those in the pews at Moody intermittently broke into small groups for
prayer. Host Bakke urged viewers to do the same. Meanwhile, computer users held a
simultaneous concert of prayer over CompuServe's Christian Interactive Network. They read
the text of the brief prayers and sermons, and shared prayers with each other.
<BR>...Some 1,200 people joined the national prayer observance in Washington, D.C. Speakers
from every branch of government, the military, the media, industry, business, and
youth-and-family ministries exhorted the nation to repent and pray. Americans must plead
with God for "His healing mercies," Dobson said. Yechiel Eckstein, head of the International
Fellowship of Christians and Jews, a rabbi, sounded the shofar, a horn used in the traditional
call to prayer of the Jewish people. Cardinal Anthony Bevilaqua, the Catholic Archbishop of
Philadelphia, also prayed.
<BR>...America may be on "the verge of the greatest spiritual awakening in history," pastor D.
James Kennedy said. He urged people to spend at least five minutes a day praying for revival.
Increasing participation in the National Day of Prayer "holds out hope for our nation," which
desperately needs revival. Americans have become "ashamed of God," he said. Echoing the
Gettysburg Address, he asked, "Can we long endure after turning our backs on God?"
<BR>...The country's spiritual hunger may lead people back to God, Focus on the Family's James
Dobson told NIRR. "I am ashamed before the Lord" for the country's moral wickedness, he
said. "We have forgotten what shame and guilt are about." Yet the seeds of revival plant
themselves in the despair and debauchery of society. Revival on college campuses (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/050195.html">NIRR 5/1</A>)
is a "hopeful sign, because revival often begins with the young," Dobson said. People of all
ages are searching for spiritual answers, which is good news, even if they look in the wrong
places initially, he said. 
<BR>...In Costa Mesa, Calif., 7,000 congregants from at least a dozen denominations gathered at
Chuck Smith's Calvary Chapel. The rift between Smith and Vineyard Church leader John
Wimber created years ago by philosophical differences between the two closed further.
During the service, members of Calvary Chapel and Anaheim Vineyard, which was a Calvary
Chapel 16 years ago, worshipped together for the first time.
<BR>...Florida coordinator Pam Olsen prayed with Gov. Lawton Chiles in his office after a service
before 500 people in the capitol courtyard. About 6,000 people attended 100 city hall
meetings across the state. In Dallas, 400 people prayed around the county courthouse in a
driving rain. In Idaho, citizens prayed for leaders from government, business, and education.

Mainline Protestant, charismatic, Catholic, and full-gospel churches are experiencing revival
in Ottawa, Ont., Canadian pastors report. "A stream of renewal" from the Toronto Vineyard
Airport church (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/022095.html">NIRR 2/20</A>) is touching a dozen churches, according to Ken Hall, leader of
the Ottawa Pastor's Fellowship, a prayer and support group. "Anglican, Catholic, Pentecostal,
charismatic, Covenant Congregational -- it's across the board," he told NIRR.
<BR>...Healings, reconciliation, and salvations characterize the services. The hubs of renewal are
The Life Center, a Pentecostal church in East Ottawa, and Our Lady of Perpetual Help, a
downtown Catholic church. Attendance at a Friday healing service has jumped from 60 to 500
since pastor Dennis Hayes of Our Lady of Perpetual Help visited the Toronto Vineyard last
year. "Things started happening" when he and others prayed after his visits, Hayes told NIRR.
He belongs to Companions of the Cross, an order open to the gifts of the Spirit. Although
outward manifestations of the Spirit are important, the church still focuses on "what the Lord
is doing in people," Hayes said.
<BR>...Churches are growing as drug addicts and prostitutes testify to God's grace at The Life
Center, pastor Barry Boucher said. Between November and April, he baptized 80 new
converts, "about 70 more than usual" during that time, he said. Sunday morning attendance
increased from 350 to 800, forcing the church to add a service. "Nothing has changed, but
everything is changed," Boucher said. The church service still has worship, announcements,
preaching, and offerings, but it is different "because the Lord has touched me so profoundly. I
feel He is saying, 'Now you're working with Me, rather than for Me'."
<BR>...Unity across denominations is strong. "It's as though there were an open heaven over our
city," allowing pastors and churches to work together, Boucher said. "There is certainly more
than tolerance of each other," Joe Muldoon, pastor of St. John the Apostle Catholic Church,
told NIRR. "There is a real support and appreciation for each other." While maintaining
doctrinal differences, the churches are cooperating "in ways we haven't seen before," Hayes
said. 
<BR>...The breakthrough came when Hall arranged for Mark DuPont and Ian Ross of the Toronto
Vineyard to hold a pastors' seminar. About 100 pastors and pastoral leaders attended the
conference at St. John the Apostle and 800 people came for open sessions in the evening,
Muldoon said. "It was very much Spirit blessed, with Catholics and Protestants praising the
Lord together," one attendee said. "I never saw such a significant display of spiritual unity,
Hall said. NIRR 5/15/95

Promise Keepers drew massive crowds in Detroit and Los Angeles. A rally April 28-29
attracted 72,280 men to the Silverdome, while a May 5-6 conference in the Los Angeles
Coliseum drew 72,548. The men's spiritual movement has a total of 13 events planned this
year, with half a million men expected to attend. Last year, 278,600 men attended rallies in
seven cities. 
<BR>...In Detroit, a plane circled the Silverdome during lunch on Saturday, towing a sign that read,
"Men Don't Own Women and Children" in a protest against Promise Keepers. Event emcee
Chuck Bolte commented on the sign later that afternoon, saying, "We couldn't agree more."
The ovation that followed indicated wide agreement among the attendees. Walk Through the
Bible President Bruce Wilkinson challenged the audience to move out of the "second chair of
lukewarmness" into the "first chair of holiness and commitment" to the cause of Christ.
Several men held folding chairs high in the air, symbolizing their acknowledgment of
Wilkinson's charge and their decision to move to the "first chair." Luis Palau's evangelistic
invitation elicited a response from some 7,000 men for new or renewed commitments to
Christ. NIRR 5/15/95

The college revival is moving through more schools and churches (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/050195.html">NIRR 5/1</A>). Among other
schools are Messiah College in Grantham, Pa.; Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pa.; Spring
Arbor College in Spring Arbor, Mich.; Biola University in Los Angeles, Calif.; Bethel
College in Mishawaka, Ind.; and the University of Texas at Austin.
<BR>...It touched Chico, Calif., when Texas pastor John Avant and two Howard Payne University
students spoke at meetings May 5-7. After Brandi Maguire and Kelly Parrish testified Sunday
morning, services at two local churches ran long as congregants formed lines to confess and
repent of their sins. Similar events occurred at Pleasant Valley Assembly of God, said Ron
Pate, an associate pastor at Esplanade Baptist Church. On Sunday evening, the students
testified at a Nazarene church in nearby Oroville, where 150 people from about 20 churches
gathered. The four-and-a-half-hour service "was the sweetest time," Pate said, as the crowd
"dealt with major issues and repented over serious sin problems." On Friday and Saturday, the
students spoke at gatherings of college students and student ministries, where similar events
occurred, Pate said. NIRR 5/15/95

Thirty-two million people have become Christians in the former Soviet Union through a series
of prime-time specials aired by the Christian Broadcasting Network (NIRR 5/16/94),
according to a poll commissioned by CBN. The poll, conducted by the Ostaniko Sociological
Research Company in Moscow, sampled 4,429 people across the Commonwealth of
Independent States. The method is similar to that used by pollster George Gallup, Jr., CBN
President Michael Little said. The ministry received 11 million requests for Christian
literature from those who watched the programs. More than 750,000 people are enrolled in a
Bible correspondence course through the CBN's Kiev, Ukraine, office. The high response rate
"is the reason we find these numbers so credible," Little said. The series, aired in December
1991, consisted of four one-hour specials. Two were geared toward reaching adults, one to
teen-agers, and one to children. Children saw animated stories with biblical characters, while
indigenous actors dramatized Christian concepts on adult programs, Little said. About 25
million adults viewed at least one show and prayed with the host, the poll shows, and 7
million children under 16 prayed. Other series led 3 million to pray in Argentina in 1990, 4.5
million in Romania in 1994, and 14 million in the Philippines in 1994, Little said. CBN will
air a similar series in Asia this year, Little said. NIRR 5/15/95

Evangelist Alberto Mottesi's March-April crusade in Bogota, Columbia, drew 70,000 people
over five nights. Two thousand people made public decisions on the final night to become
Christians, Hector Torres of the Alberto Mottesi Evangelistic Association said. Conversion
figures for the entire crusade were unavailable. Some 350 evangelical churches in Bogota
made year-long preparations for the crusade, which involved at least three pastoral and
leadership seminars and a number of prayer rallies, Torres told NIRR. The largest, a youth
rally in January, attracted 5,000 people. NIRR 5/15/95

Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Boulder, Colo., gave away its weekly collection March 26.
The 1,000-member congregation donated the $77,924 to impoverished tenants of a nearby
mobile-home park. "People just unloaded cash, big- time," said church member Dale
Halbrook. The trailer park, an island of affordable housing for hard-luck families, was
rezoned, forcing the residents to move to make way for offices, retail space, and apartments.
There is no other low-income housing in Boulder, where the average home sells for $248,000,
the Rocky Mountain News reported. An average of four residents per trailer live in the 29
trailers, including renovated school buses and a van. Many cannot afford moving fees, and the
trailers are too old to move anyway, the paper said. 
<BR>...Vineyard members took the money to the trailer park that morning. Residents barely could
believe their eyes when some 300 members of the church assembled in the trailer-park lot and
announced the gift, Vineyard Christian pastor Walt Roberson said. When congregation
members told residents they "were there in the name of the Lord to bless them," many
residents wept, saying they thought no one cared about them. About a dozen people accepted
the Lord in the parking lot. Church members also passed out a truckload of groceries and
served lunch. The church will determine the needs of residents before it helps them find new
housing, employment, day care, and transportation. 
<BR>...Three years ago, Vineyard Christian gave another such gift. One Sunday, the mostly white
church took up a collection of $20,000. Then members traveled six miles to Casey Junior
High School, where Second Baptist Church, a predominantly black congregation, was meeting
during its building campaign. The chairman of the Second Baptist board had just announced
that they needed to raise $19,000 in 10 days. Otherwise, the purchase of a new building
would be canceled and a substantial down payment lost. After they prayed for the money,
Vineyard pastor James Ryle walked in. Hundreds of members of the Vineyard followed him,
filling the aisles and even the stage.
<BR>...Ryle went up front, where he addressed Second Baptist pastor Hansford Vann. "The Lord
told us to take our offering this morning and bring it over to you," Ryle told Vann, handing
him a check. When Vann announced the amount of the check to the congregation, "needless
to say, there was praise," he told NIRR. "You would have had to be there. The whole
building was vibrating." Vann said the Vineyard church knew about the building campaign,
but not about the urgent need for money. 
<BR>...Vineyard Christian's generosity has rebounded. Since the donation to Second Baptist, a
creditor has given the church 35 adjoining acres to add to its 5 acres. And since the gift to
trailer-park residents, the church experienced a "dramatic increase" in its income, Roberson
said. "That's how God responded." NIRR 5/15/95

Christians in Rwanda have lost confidence in churches, but not faith in Christ, World Vision
Rwanda Director Chalon Lee said. Churches where massacres occurred are filled every
Sunday with people "who praise God because they survived," Lee told NIRR. Many clergy
who sanctioned the massacres or kept silent live in refugee camps in Tanzania and Zaire,
where "there is a strange lack of remorse and guilt," Lee said. Those in the camps who
participated in the massacres feel they are being persecuted. "Using the term `reconciliation'
with the refugee population is like sticking them with a hot knife," Lee said. Believers in
Kigali need "new leaders to rise from the ashes." According to Lee, "they know the clergy
may be bad, but God is good."
<BR>...World Vision also is supplying blankets, health care, food, and transportation for those
affected by the recent massacre in a camp for displaced persons in Kibeho, Rwanda. United
Nations observers say 2,000 people died resisting government troops trying to force them
back to their villages. 
<BR>...World Vision is caring for 1,000 unaccompanied children in its four centers, but reports that
some 10,000 more children are without families. The relief agency will use its
Unaccompanied Children's Centers in Gikongoro and Kanazi to house 80-150 additional
children who were separated from their families, Lee said. Many stay with foster families
who take them in, while some are cared for by other ministries. World Vision provides food,
shelter, spiritual comfort, and emotional counseling. Children are encouraged to express their
anger and fear after witnessing the brutality of last year's massacres. Bible studies and prayer
are a "means of healing," Lee said. NIRR 5/15/95

Eighty-nine American doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other health-care volunteers
ministered to poor communities in Valencia, Venezuela, this spring. The Southern Baptist
medical outreach workers also brought three tons of donated medicines and supplies. The
Americans treated 14,245 patients at clinics in 22 locations selected by Venezuelan church
leaders as potential church planting sites, Baptist Press reported. Some 2,300 of the patients
received Christ as a result of the outreach, missionaries said. Sponsoring churches will follow
up with discipleship classes, home Bible studies, and visitation. NIRR 5/15/95

An auditors' investigation shows the former treasurer of the Episcopal Church
misappropriated $2.2 million, Presiding Bishop Edmund Browning said (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6</A>). Auditors
found that Ellen Cooke deposited church money into her personal accounts, wrote
unauthorized checks, ran up personal expenses on a corporate credit card and other church
accounts, and improperly received money when she resigned in January. Cooke paid nearly
$1 million for a house and a farm and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to renovate
them. Money also went to private-school tuition for her sons, limousine services, jewelry,
clothing, and gifts, investigators said. Cooke also deposited $90,000 into the pastoral
discretionary account of St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Montclair, N.J., where her husband,
Nicholas, served as parish priest.
<BR>...Cooke said she would accept full responsibility for "any inappropriate use of funds" and
would make restitution. She blamed her actions in part on "pain, abuse, and powerlessness I
have felt [while working] as a lay woman on a senior level at the church headquarters." NIRR

Trustees of Southern Baptist Seminary in Louisville, Ky., last month decided to hire only
professors who believe that women are not called to preach. A week later, women swept the
three top awards in the school's annual preaching competition, a first. The awards panel
consisted of six students and two teachers, all males. Judging of the initial 28 entries was
based on reviews of manuscripts that did not identify the author's name or gender, Associated
Baptist Press reported. Only after the three finalists were selected did judges hear tapes of the
sermons to determine first-, second-, and third-place rankings. NIRR 5/15/95

Pope John Paul II called for an increase in "common openness to the Spirit" between the
Catholic and Orthodox Churches. In a 54-page Apostolic Letter, he described the nearly
1,000-year schism between the two branches of Christianity as serious sin and scandal. The
pope said both sides were to blame for the "progressive estrangement" that led to a formal
split. It is time to make amends, "beseech Christ's forgiveness," shed "mutual ignorance and
prejudice," accept and respect each other, and enter into cooperative endeavors, he said. The
pope did not deal with doctrinal issues on which the churches differ. NIRR 5/15/95

Campbell University, a 5,000-student Southern Baptist-affiliated school in Buies Creek, N.C.,
lost an AIDS discrimination case. Under a settlement agreement, it must pay $325,000 to a
teacher for wrongful dismissal two years ago and give him back his job. The suit was one of
the first in the country to apply the 1991 Americans with Disabilities Act to people with
AIDS. Contrary to the school's contention, doctors testified that the teacher poses no risk to
his students. Identified only as John Doe in the suit, he was allowed to write his own job
description. He will coordinate student internships in the school's department of exercise

A federal judge ruled that a public school system in West Virginia was wrong to deny
permission to a junior high school Bible club to take a field trip for the National Day of
Prayer. U.S. District Judge Irene Keeley said the action violated First Amendment rights of
free speech, free exercise of religion, and free assembly, as well as rights under the Equal
Access Act. The judge issued an injunction allowing Charles Town Junior High School Bible
Club members to travel to Washington, D.C., at their own expense. The school system
approved field trips for all non-curricular clubs except the Bible Club, Keeley said. School
administrators said the club's field trips were not "content-neutral." NIRR 5/15/95

The Mormon church agreed to purge from its records the names of 380,000 Holocaust victims
baptized by proxy. Posthumous baptism can achieve salvation for those who died without
accepting the Mormon gospel, according to Mormon teaching. Proxy baptisms are supposed
to be limited to family members. 
<BR>...The baptisms angered Holocaust survivors. The baptisms were performed by Mormons
acting without church authorization. Mormon officials agreed to reiterate the church's official
policy to its 9 million members. Some 200 million names are on the list of baptized dead.

A federally funded study of the power of prayer is under way at the University of New
Mexico. The National Institutes of Health awarded psychiatry professor Scott Walker nearly
$30,000 to head the research project. At issue is whether prayers said by concerned but
uninvolved believers on behalf of specific individuals can improve chances of their recovery
from alcohol or drug abuse. Researchers will assemble a pool of "clients" from a substance
abuse-treatment facility. Protestants, Catholics, and Jews will pray for half of them. Urine
screens and psychological assessments will be used to measure results.
<BR>...Critics are having a field day: What if Protestant prayers carry more weight than Catholic
ones? Will it make a difference how seasoned one is at praying? What if a friend or relative
prays for someone in the no-pray-ers group? Will results be skewed if a client in the pray-er
group secretly prays for himself or herself? Americans United for Separation of Church and
State, which opposes government spending on religion, chimed in. Asked AU spokesman
Joseph Conn: "If they find that prayer doesn't work, are they going to send out an advisory?"
Walker and his backers acknowledged that the study has limits. NIRR 5/15/95

"Dangerous forms of nationalism" are escalating in Europe, the European Evangelical
Alliance said. In response, evangelical congregations across the continent prayed on May 7 -the 50th anniversary of VE Day for peace, reconciliation, and an end to racist attitudes, EAA
spokeswoman Julia DoxatPurser said. VE Day, the end of World War II on the continent,
symbolizes victory over racism and hope that such a war never will happen again, Graham
Dale of the Evangelical Alliance in the United Kingdom told NIRR.
<BR>...The Evangelical Alliance distributed prayers and sermon materials about peace to
congregations in Portugal, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Croatia, Romania, and the U.K. The

Stetson University, formerly affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, will drop its
century-old ban on the use of alcoholic beverages on campus. Trustees of the Deland, Fla.,
school voted to allow beer, wine, and wine coolers at approved parties and in some student
residence halls. Students under age 21, who account for 41% of the enrollment, will not be
permitted to drink on campus. The policy also calls for more alcohol-awareness education.
<BR>...Studies showed that alcohol use at Stetson mirrored other schools, despite the ban, the

At the first baccalaureate service in four years for high schools in the Pipillion, Neb., area,
former Nebraska governor Kay Orr urged graduating seniors to live their lives according to
biblical principles. Doing so is crucial to the nation's future because America is "adrift
without a moral compass," she said. Orr joined Christ Lutheran Church in Lincoln about 18
months ago. NIRR 5/15/95

About 140 evangelists from China's Henan province have been arrested since March,
according to the International Christian Association. More than 1,000 missionaries set out
from Fangcheng County in February to make converts in distant provinces. Police arrested the
better-known preachers, according to ICA, a German-based missions organization. Some
evangelists were released after paying fines and serving short sentences, but a third remained
in captivity.
<BR>...The government is cracking down on unregistered churches throughout China, Brent Fulton,
U.S. director of China Ministries International, told NIRR. He has received weekly arrest
reports over the past few months. Chinese church analysts speculate that General Secretary
Jiang Zemin ordered a crackdown because he believes religion poses a threat to communism,
ICA reported. Another reason could be the imminent death of Premier Deng Xiaoping and the
power struggle that already is beginning, Fulton said. 
<BR>...Chinese authorities agreed to provide reports about prisoners they are holding, according to
John Kamm, a Hong Kong-based U.S. businessman. Kamm pressed the government for
information about prisoners of conscience. He said officials agreed to investigate every three
months a new list of 25 prisoners. NIRR 5/15/95

Black pro-life leaders broke ranks with the leadership of the eight-denomination Congress of
National Black Churches over the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster as surgeon general. They
said his abortion record overrides all other issues. "The man is not black. The man is not
white. He is an abortionist who terminates life in the womb, and that's what he should be
judged by," said Dolores Bernadette Grier, a Catholic who heads American Black Women
Against Death by Abortion. CNBC leaders told Religion News Service they were looking at
Foster's overall credentials. In a complex society, judgments cannot be based on a single
issue, said African Methodist Episcopal Bishop John Hurst Adams. NIRR 5/15/95

Oklahoma City pastors say church attendance has been much higher every Sunday since the
bombing of the federal building -- higher than on Easter Sunday in some cases. People are
reaching out to God in a new way, Republican Sen. Don Nickles told a national TV audience.
"I've never seen a revival like this before," he said. "People are looking for answers," said
pastor Mark Estep of First Baptist Church of suburban Nikoma Park.
<BR>...Estep took part in the funerals of five people. They included Dana Cooper, a church
member who operated the day-care center in the federal building, and her 30-month-old son,
Chris. The child was dedicated to the Lord at the church a year ago, the pastor recalled. Each
of two other members who were killed left behind a wife and children. As did a number of
other area pastors, he spent many hours at the victim notification center at First Christian
Church downtown, at hospitals, and on the phone counseling relatives. He told Baptist Press
that he struggles with his emotions while ministering to others. He predicted that anger will
follow the grief that has brought so many people to their knees. "We cannot blame God for
what happened," he said. "He understands our hearts and our anger. He will bring healing in
good time." NIRR 5/15/95

Habitat for Humanity has built 30,000 single-family homes for impoverished people in 20
years, founder Millard Fuller said. The Americus, Ga.-based nondenominational ministry has
953 offices in the United States, and hundreds more in 40 other countries. It is ranked 17th
among the nation's top home builders, according to a Washington Times article. Owners are
given 25-year nointerest mortgages. The funds, along with donations, are used by the ministry
to build more houses. No government money is accepted.
<BR>...In February, House Speaker Newt Gingrich asked Fuller to consider taking over the
Department of Housing and Urban Development's public housing programs, the Times said.
Fuller said no, but was open to the government donating land to the poor, which would save
Habitat money. NIRR 5/15/95

A forum on a hot-button topic -- mixing politics and religion -- drew candid but civil debate
among prominent Protestants and Jews at Gordon College April 24-25. Speakers included
Barry Lynn of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, Janet Parshall of
Concerned Women for America, James Dunn of the Southern Baptist Joint Committee on
Public Affairs, James Skillen of the Center for Public Justice, and A. James Rudin of the
American Jewish Committee. Discussions included school prayer and religious pluralism. 
<BR>...The fact that people with such divergent views listened respectfully to each other "was an
accomplishment in itself," said Harold High of Gordon's Center for Christian Studies. In our
contentious age, "people tend to shout rather than talk," he said. Christians should refine their
ideas in "good, honest conversation" with others without "compromising our most deeply held
beliefs," he said.  "We find out we have more things in common than we expect." NIRR 5/15/95

Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) pledged that, if elected president, he will support restrictions on
abortion. "I am pro-life," he said in a commencement address at Liberty University. However,
he has refused to make opposition to abortion a litmus test for a running mate or senior
administration official. Gramm has also said a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion is
not politically feasible. Gramm said he supports voluntary prayer in schools and would
reverse President Clinton's policy allowing homosexuals to serve in the military.

The most extensive carbon-14 dating done on the Dead Sea Scrolls confirms that most of
them pre-date Christ, University of Arizona geoscientists reported. The results generally

Scholars contend that the scrolls give evidence that Christianity is rooted in Judaism. The
results weaken theories that key texts in the scrolls were influenced by the lives of Jesus,
John the Baptist, or the apostle Paul.

planning efforts in the region. Some criticized evangelical Protestants, alleging they have
subverted the region's culture and divided its people. A conference statement condemned
unrestrained free markets for encouraging inequality, but rejected Marxism as a solution to
economic and social ills.

The Clinton administration said it will
join in an appeal of a federal judge's
ruling that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is unconstitutional (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/032095.html">NIRR 3/20</A>).
Judge Lucius Bunton said in a Texas
case that RFRA usurps powers that traditionally are granted to courts. It was the
first such ruling against RFRA since its
passage in 1993. A White House spokesman said the Justice Department is supporting the law in four pending federal
court cases. RFRA requires that government have a "compelling interest" to interfere with religious practices. Analysts
say the Supreme Court eventually will
rule on the law.

<P>
A wave of spiritual revival continues to spread across college campuses
and churches in several states (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/032095.html">NIRR 3/20</A>). Students from Howard Payne
University in Brownwood, Texas, spent spring break telling "the story of what
God is doing," as one student said.
<BR>...Almost identical experiences happened within a few weeks at The
Criswell College in Dallas; Houston Baptist University in Houston; Moorehead
State University in Moorehead, Ky.; Murray State University in Murray, Ky.;
Wheaton College in Wheaton, Ill.; and Olivet Nazarene University in Kankakee,
Ill. At all the schools, students are coming forward during lengthy services to
repent of pride, lust, bondage to materialism, bitterness, and racism. Many relationships have been mended, school leaders say.
<BR>...At Wheaton College, a March 19 service at Pierce Chapel lasted from
7:30 p.m. to 6 a.m. as students formed lines at the microphone to confess sins.
After each person spoke, friends gathered to embrace the person and pray for
him or her, said Timothy Beougher, an assistant professor. Students filled five
garbage bags with bottles of alcohol, pornography, and secular music. Days later,
lengthy services continued, involving half the school's 2,200 students. At The
Criswell College, 150 students prayed and repented for four hours after hearing
the testimony of Howard Payne students. Similar events occurred at Houston
Baptist University and Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, La.
<BR>...Other campuses reported similar activities after showing a video about
the 1970 Asbury College revival. At Olivet Nazarene, Chaplain Bill Bray played
an eight-minute video clip at a Feb. 23 chapel service. As Bray concluded,
students and faculty began seven hours of sharing, praying, singing, and exhorting each other to live holy lives. At one point, 25 members of the football team
came to the podium en masse to confess and pray for each other. As the service
continued, word spread off campus and members of the community also came to
experience the move of God, Bray said. At Moorehead State and Murray State,
many students responded to showings of the Asbury video with prayer, singing,
and confession of sins. (Copies of the video When God Comes are available from
the Francis Asbury Society at (606) 858-4222.)
<BR>...Congregations that hear of the events also are experiencing waves of
repentance and prayer. Doug Munton, pastor of First Baptist Church in Corinth,
Texas, said his church experienced revival for weeks after a visit from Howard
Payne students. When John Avant, pastor of Coggin Avenue Baptist Church in
Brownwood, Texas, described these events to an evangelism conference for the
Illinois Baptist State Convention, more than 500 people stayed for four hours to
pray and repent. In the next week "at least a half dozen" accounts of similar
events were reported by those who went out from the conference.
<BR>...Expectation of revival has been growing on other college campuses.
"Everywhere I go, more students have been involved in small groups," said Gary
Stratton, dean of the chapel at Gordon College in Wenham, Mass. "There is an
anointing for prayer on this generation." Gordon canceled classes for an April 11
day of prayer. Roy Fish, a professor at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, offered a "guiding principle" for confession. "The
circle of one's sin, as a rule, should be the circle of one's confession," he said.
When confessing sexual immorality, "extreme discretion should be used."

Churches of various denominations are experiencing revival in Melbourne, Fla. Since Jan. 1, an estimated 50,000 people from a number of different
churches attended services held six days a week at The Tabernacle, a Vineyard
church. Pastors and musicians from 15 area congregations -- including Presbyterian Church of America, Southern Baptist, Episcopal, Methodist, Assemblies of
God, and independent charismatic churches -- take turns hosting the services.
Miraculous physical healings and phenomena such as "holy laughter" have
characterized the services, pastors said. Some 600 people have become believers
or rededicated their lives to Christ since the meetings began.
<BR>...Revival began when Randy Clark, a Vineyard pastor from St. Louis,
spoke at the church. On Jan. 6, Melbourne pastor Fred Grewe drove with Clark
to Vero Beach, Fla., an hour south of Melbourne, to speak on Christian radio
station WSCF. During their interview, the disc jockey "went down under the
power of the Holy Spirit," fell on the floor, and was unable to continue the
interview, Grewe said. The same thing happened to the general manager, so
music was aired because "there was nobody to operate the station."
<BR>...Love, respect, and a lack of competition among pastors -- nurtured
through regular prayer together -- have been hallmarks of the revival, Grewe
said. "No single church is going to take this community for Christ. We've got to
do it together. Everybody wants everybody else to do well."

True Love Waits, a celibacy movement launched by the Southern Baptist

affecting young and old alike, they added.

Christian ministries can find open doors to China by helping the country's
57 million handicapped citizens. According to Brent Fulton, U.S. director of
China Ministries International, about two dozen ministries outside China are
providing resources for the elderly, mentally retarded, and orphans. The indigenous church long has cared for the handicapped, who often are regarded as nonpersons. Fulton said the church also cares for the elderly, takes in abandoned and
orphaned children, and provides rehabilitative services for the deaf and mute.
<BR>...Recently, short-term missions teams from the United States went to
China to communicate God's love to the handicapped. Although proselytizing is
illegal in China, "there are no prohibitions against personal relationships," Fulton
told NIRR. He said ministries for the handicapped are "well received by officials" because Deng Pufong, son of Premier Deng Xiaoping, is a paralytic who
works in the government for the handicapped. Bureaucrats pursue benevolent
policies toward the handicapped to gain political favor, Fulton said.

Miami Mayor Stephen Clark presented Luis Palau with a key to the city

Argentine-born evangelist's message of racial and spiritual reconciliation is badly
needed in Miami. Palau, an American citizen, considers himself a bridge between
the Anglo and Hispanic cultures. 
<BR>...More than 78,000 people attended the crusade during three days of
English events and five days of Spanish events, the Luis Palau Evangelistic
Association said. Some 3,200 people made commitments to Christ. Among those
converted was a professed witch who said she recently tried to commit suicide.
The crusade coincided with Carnival Week, an annual celebration by the Cuban

The CoMission is only "negligibly affected" by the Russian Education
Ministry's cancellation of its agreement allowing the group's Christian Morality

Crow said at least two-thirds of the CoMission's workers still are instructing
teachers on campus, and the rest instruct them off campus. Local officials are
encouraging the CoMission to continue its activities, he said.
<BR>...The Russian Orthodox Church "leaned on" a vice premier to influence

Bullock told NIRR. The CoMission has done all it could to befriend Orthodox

Va. The event is presented annually by the Regent University Divinity School

because Jesus communicated His message by who He was. He "earned respect,
not demanded it," Kraft said. Christians need to do likewise, earning their way
into people's private worlds, he said. 
<BR>...The event consisted of addresses by missions experts and groupstrategy sessions covering Muslims, tribal groups, Hindus, Buddhists, Chinese,

The television cameras are gone from Rwanda, "but the need is still

National Association of Evangelicals in March. Rawson, the son of missionaries
to Burundi, was invited to the group's convention by World Relief. The humanitarian arm of the NAE is one of the organizations still at work in the refugee
camps. World Relief President Art Gay told NIRR he visited a refugee camp on
the Rwanda-Zaire border, where 425,000 people live in makeshift shelters on a
bed of lava rock. Gay preached to several congregations in a church built
of wooden sticks and plastic sheeting. 
<BR>...World Relief will shift from disaster response to development so people
can "get on with their lives," Gay said. The group received a $230,000 grant
from the U.S. Agency for International Development to rebuild a hospital in
Kigabura and set up clinics in surrounding areas. Rwanda is politically unstable
and the church has been compromised, yet the group is committed to moving its
headquarters to Kigali and setting up long-term assistance programs. "My hunch

Leaders of religious and other groups complained that a United Nationssponsored conference on world poverty last month made no progress toward
ending global impoverishment. Officials from some 170 countries attended the
World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen, Denmark. They took
positions favoring reliance on free-market economies as a chief means of ending
poverty. General Secretary Konrad Raiser challenged that approach, saying open
markets and economic growth cannot be advanced as a panacea for social ills.
<BR>...Some 600 voluntary organizations held an unofficial summit nearby and
issued an Alternative Declaration. Their statement rejects emphasis on economic
growth as a cure-all. Social policy in developing countries has been reduced to a
"safety net" for the poor, it said. Signers included World Vision International and
agencies of the United Methodist Church, the United Church of Christ, and the
Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).

Many taxpayers are having trouble getting required receipts from
churches and charities for contributions of $250 or more, so the IRS has eased
its new rule. The rule requires a receipt that includes the amount of the donation,
along with the value of any goods or services received in exchange for the
donation. For 1994 returns only, the IRS now says a good-faith effort to get the

A U.S. judge in Milwaukee struck down the Freedom of Access to Clinic
Entrances Act. Judge Rudolph Randa ruled that the part of the 1994 federal law
that bans "non-violent, physical obstruction" of clinics is unconstitutional. His
decision came in a case involving six defendants who attached themselves to cars
in front of an abortion clinic last September. They faced up to six months in
prison and $10,000 in fines, but Randa dismissed the charges against them. The
ruling sets up a possible Supreme Court review of FACE.
<BR>...Seven other federal judges and a U.S. appeals court in Richmond, Va.,
have upheld FACE as constitutional. This limits the importance of Randa's
ruling, analysts said. The U.S. Attorney's office in Milwaukee said it will
continue to enforce the law aggressively. Planned Parenthood said it plans to
appeal Randa's decision.

Chicago's public schools can close on Good Friday, a federal judge said.
U.S. District Judge Ann Williams ruled last summer that the schools could not
do so because it was a religious holiday. But last month the school system said a
survey showed that 90% of its teachers would not work on Good Friday. It asked
the court for permission to close schools that day. Williams provided a loophole:
officials have the power to close schools for non-religious reasons on any day,
she said. The officials reclassified Good Friday as an emergency closing day that
will not have to be made up at the end of the school year.

Operators of a Monsey, N.Y., commuter bus catering to Orthodox Jews
agreed to remove a curtain separating passengers by gender. The curtain had
been hung in the aisle so men would not be in sight of women passengers during
prayer. A Jewish woman, Sima Rabinovicz, complained when a group of men on
a December 1993 trip asked her to move so they could expand their area to the
women's side of the bus. She refused, the men got out to pray on the street, and
the bus driver reprimanded her, she said. In negotiations with the bus company,
her lawyers argued that the government-subsidized bus is a public conveyance,
not a synagogue. Under the settlement, passengers may fashion their own
personal prayer curtains as long as they don't interfere with other passengers or
pose a safety problem.

Legislation to let low-income parents receive federal funds to send their
children to private or religious schools was introduced in the U.S. Senate. Dan
Coats (R-Ind.) and Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) want the $30-million bill to run
a pilot project in some 20 school districts. A spokesman for the National Association of Evangelicals applauded the bill. But Barry Lynn of Americans United
for Separation of Church and State said it would force people to pay a "religion
tax." A similar bill was defeated in the last Congress.

It's being called a truce in the bitter "culture war" over the role of religion
in public schools. U.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley and leaders of 17
religious, civil liberties, and education groups agreed to improve communication,
respect each other's positions, and work to avoid lawsuits. The groups ranged
from the Christian Coalition and National Association of Evangelicals to People
for the American Way, the National Council of Churches, and the National
Education Association.
<BR>...The NAE's Forest Montgomery described the agreement as "not easy,"
but "a first step." Several prominent groups, including the American Civil
Liberties Union and Focus on the Family, declined to join the pact, according to
scholar Charles Haynes of The Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at
Vanderbilt University, which helped to bring the parties together.
<BR>...Among the six principles in a statement the leaders signed: "Public
schools should not promote or inhibit religion, but can teach about religion when
appropriate. They should treat religious conviction with respect." Another one
says "parents have primary responsibility for their children's education, and
schools and parents should work together" regarding issues of religion.

Lois Mitten can continue using the Bible in her five child-care centers in
Toledo and still qualify for a federal loan. Mitten sued the U.S. Small Business
Administration in 1992 after it rejected her application for a $1 million loan.
Officials cited a weekly 20-minute lesson in which children read Bible stories
and sing religious songs. They said a government rule forbids use of federal
funds to influence or impact religious opinions. Mitten said the voluntary lessons
do not endorse any particular faith. They are designed to teach children that they
are special to God, she said. Prodded by the American Center for Law and
Justice, which represented Mitten, the SBA settled the suit in her favor. A Justice
Department spokesman said the rule may be repealed.

Columbia Elementary School near Orlando violated a 10-year-old's constitutional rights by confiscating his Bible, a lawsuit filed in federal court alleges.
Several times, a teacher seized fourth-grader Joshua Burton's Bible, it says.
Another time, it adds, he was sent to the principal's office for having his Bible
on top of his desk with other school books. "He has the right to read his Bible to
himself during non-classtime, and to read it with someone else during nonclasstime," lawyer Mat Staver of the Liberty Council insisted.

When Japanese police implicated the Aum Shinrikyo Buddhist sect in the
Tokyo subway nerve gas attacks, it was no surprise to Johannes Aagaard. He
heads Dialogue Center International, a research center at Aarhus University in
Denmark that tracks various sects around the world. Aagaard had been warning
in writings and interviews that "this cult could explode." Its mission, based on a
philosophy of nihilism, is "the destruction of everything," he said. Unlike many
new cults attracting Japanese young people, Aum Shinrikyo is committed to "the
nothingness of everything" by the year 2000 or so, Aagaard said on CNN.
<BR>...To sect founder Shoko Asahara, 40, who is in poor health, there is honor
in being the one to carry out "this holocaust," Aagaard said. Asahara has been
dropping clues for several years in talks and writings about the group's mission,
news accounts said. He talked about death by sarin nerve gas a year ago. Lately
he has emphasized the Hindu god of destruction and creation, Lord Shiva.
Shiva's job is to destroy so that everything can be renewed. "Maybe he thinks of
himself as a living Shiva," Shinichi Nakazawa, a professor religious studies, told
The New York Times.

Bob Jones University said it is spending millions of dollars on a plan to
beam courses by satellite to hundreds of Christian schools around the country
beginning this fall. The classes will be taught live, and the technology will allow
two-way communications between students and instructors, BJU officials said.
Courses will include advanced math, algebra, chemistry, physics, biology, and
Spanish. A 10-month subscription costs $9,900 and includes equipment and
maintenance. Schools would have to pay that much "just for one chemistry
teacher," project coordinator Jim Dickson told reporters.

Contemporary Christian dancing and Christian dance clubs are popping
up, Religion News Service said. Dance music can be found in some Christian
bookstores and heard on some Christian radio stations. Organizers use late-night
Christian "rave" dances for low-key outreach. Christian lyrics make "sanctified
dance music" different from secular songs, Christian broadcaster Ken Farley said.
<BR>...Suggestive clothing worn by outsiders at outreach dances prompt criticism
from church members, RNS said. At Club J in San Jose, Calif., run by Jubilee
Christian Center, bouncers wearing striped referee shirts monitor the dance floor.
"If dancers get too bump-and-grindish, then the bouncers blow a whistle or throw
a flag for a violation," singles pastor Adam Bernal said.
<BR>...Contemporary dancing "is very problematic at best for the Christian
because of the fleshly motive and pleasure that so often accompany it," a
spokesman for the Los Angeles-based ministry of conservative pastor-broadcaster
John MacArthur said. Scott Blackwell, 35, who owns N Soul Records in Los
Angeles, said the Holy Spirit "lets us know where the line is."

Allstate Corp. acknowledged it hired a consultant who taught "unacceptable" Church of Scientology management principles to the insurance company's
agents and supervisors from 1988 to 1992. The company denied allegations that
some employees were hounded, intimidated, and wrongfully fired as a result of
the training program. More than 3,500 Allstate workers participated in seminars
that taught them to disregard ethics in the quest for greater productivity, The
Wall Street Journal reported. That part of the training "was wholly unacceptable
and inconsistent with our standards," company spokesman Al Orendorff said. He
defended other aspects of the training by Don Pearson of International Executive
Technology, a Scientology-affiliated firm promoting church founder L. Ron
Hubbard's management principles. These include rewarding without question the
most productive workers and unfailingly penalizing the least productive, the
Journal reported, citing training materials.

Rumblings in evangelical ranks may spell bad news for the Republican
Party in 1995. Leaders of the Christian right warned they may support a thirdparty effort if the GOP fails to act on moral and values-related social issues.
"Republicans Take a Walk on Moral Issues" lamented a headline on a newsletter
that Focus on the Family mailed to 2 million people. Leaders of 15 pro-life
groups met with House GOP leaders last month to press for action on abortion.
Other leaders warn that evangelicals have been too entangled in partisan politics. 
<BR>...Other evangelical leaders express worry that the GOP is pushing economic and social positions that will widen the breach between whites and
minorities and result in neglect of the needy. Some joined Catholic and mainstream Protestant leaders last month in appeals to the GOP to proceed cautiously
on welfare reform and not hurt the poor.

Many teen-agers don't understand why they shouldn't steal, Ohio State
University researchers found. Their study measured moral development among
adolescents, psychology professor John Gibbs said. More than 90% of the 323
teens studied, about half of whom were incarcerated delinquents, said stealing is
wrong, Gibbs said. But the most common reason for not stealing was that they
might get caught and punished. Other reasons included "the other person might
get even" and "you might not need the item," he said.
<BR>...A more mature perspective would be that stealing is wrong because it
hurts other people and society as a whole by damaging the sense of communal
trust, Gibbs suggested.

Broadcaster Larry Burkett, president of Christian Financial Concepts, has
cancer. He underwent surgery for removal of a kidney, according to Robert
Sutherland of CFC. Doctors reported there were no other cancers in the surrounding areas, Sutherland told NIRR. Burkett will undergo a second operation
this month to remove a tumor in his left shoulder, according to his son, L. Allen
Burkett. The younger Burkett has been in charge of CFC's daily operations since
1994, although his father still hosts two daily radio programs and has several
books in the works. The ministry has guest hosts lined up for the next four and
a half months, although Burkett is expected to recover by then. Many of
Burkett's friends, including James Dobson of Focus on the Family and Tony
Evans of Urban Alternative, volunteered to sit in during his absence.

Donn Moomaw, Ronald Reagan's pastor for decades, resigned as pastor
of Bel Air Presbyterian Church in suburban Los Angeles in 1993 because of
"sexual contact" with five women, church officials said. At the time of his abrupt
departure, Moomaw said only that he had "stepped over the line of acceptable
behavior" and pleaded no contest to accusations brought before presbytery
officials. Presbytery official Charles Doak read the ruling against the former
pastor to about 1,000 church members. Moomaw was not present at the meeting.
<BR>...Doak said that Moomaw, 63, resigned after fellow ministers accused him
of breaking the church's informal agreement to stop counseling women. The
sexual activities took place from 1983 to 1992, Doak added. The presbytery has
barred Moomaw from performing any ministerial activities, including counseling,
until 1997.                                                                                        <P><A HREF="#MENU">Back to menu</A>

Writer and minister Mel White (NIRR
7/25/94) was arrested on trespassing
charges at Pat Robertson's Christian
Broadcasting Network complex in Virginia
Beach. White, who publicly acknowledged his homosexuality in 1991, was a
ghostwriter for a 1986 Robertson book.
He showed up on Valentine's Day carrying flowers and candy, saying he wanted to discuss "inflammatory" anti-homosexual comments Robertson made on his

Carol Willis, 45, now a senior advisor on
minority voters at the Democratic National Committee, no longer is welcome in
some black circles. He showed up uninvited last month at a black ministers'
political strategy session sponsored by
Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. But
Willis was escorted out as soon as he
was spotted, participants told The Washington Post. Jackson said it was "inappropriate" for Willis to attend since his
campaign funding activities are under
federal investigation. Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr reportedly is probing the large amounts of cash
President Clinton's state and national
campaigns distributed in the black community. The funds include money given
by Willis to black ministers, ostensibly as
part of get-out-the-vote efforts.

A recent Time story on Pat Robertson
and his Operation Blessing ministry was
"badly distorted" and a "cheap shot," said
Robert Fanning, OB's chief operating
officer. The Feb. 27 article criticized Robertson for befriending Mobutu Sese
Seko, dictator of Zaire for 30 years. A
Robertson organization working in Zaire,
the African Development Company,
formed to look into mining, lumber, agriculture, and transportation investments,
could not engage in these activities without help from Mobutu, William Harrop, a
former ambassador to Zaire, told Time.
Robertson was quoted as saying that his
organizations "do not engage in domestic
politics with governments." His
enterprises in Zaire are private and designed to generate revenue for the humanitarian purposes of Operation Blessing, said spokesman Gene Kapp.

<P>
More than 25,000 people became Christians in six weeks as the result of a
play staged in Modesto, Calif. The evangelistic Heaven's Gates and Hell's
Flames was performed 28 times at Calvary Temple Worship Center, filling the
3,000-capacity Assemblies of God church each night, several pastors told NIRR.
In addition to the 25,000, an estimated 8,000 people who did not submit decision
cards because of the crush of the crowd also became believers, ushers said.
<BR>...The play is produced by Toronto-based Reality Outreach Ministries,
Inc., which trains local church members to perform the vignettes. Depending on
their characters' decisions about Christ, actors either climb stairs to heaven or are
dragged away to hell. "It's not scare tactics, but reality tactics. Hell is a scary
place," Calvary Temple pastor Glen Berteau told NIRR. "But it's still God. God
has chosen to rest on this city." Among those stirred to become believers as a
result of the play were several generations of families, including 23 members of
one extended family. Productions in the United States and Canada by Reality's
16 teams reportedly resulted in tens of thousands of conversions in 1994.
<BR>...Revival continued when the play was not being staged. While Berteau
read announcements before a Sunday service, a man approached the podium,
stood with his arms folded, and asked to be saved. As the man waved for the
congregation to join him, 45 people came forward. When people become believers during the announcements, "there's got to be an anointing," Berteau said.
<BR>...Prayer and fasting by pastors in the area preceeded what some are calling
the Miracle in Modesto. Pastors from various denominations meet at noon on
Wednesdays for the past year "to draw closer to God and each other," said David
Seifert, chairman of the Modesto Ministerium Association and pastor of Big
Valley Grace Community Church. The meetings are an outgrowth of two
Pastor's Prayer Summits conducted by International Renewal Ministries of
Portland, Ore. (NIRR 5/30/94). More than 60 pastors gathered for four-day
prayer summits. As a result, other churches in the area are "rejoicing in
Calvary's successes" without envy or rivalry, said Phil Arendt, missions pastor at
Modesto's First Baptist Church.
<BR>...Berteau reluctantly agreed to halt performances late in February in
order to allow time for churches in the area to assimilate the new believers. Most
have been referred for discipleship and fellowship to churches of various denominations around the area.

Hundreds of Siberian teens turned to Christ during a January crusade to the
Yakutia Region of Russia, San Antonio-based evangelist Sammy Tippit said. The
greatest response occurred in the town of Chulman (pop. 30,000), where about
500 people, including 350 young people, were converted during two days of
preaching in the schools and a local theater. Similar crusades in the neighboring
cities of Yakutsk and Neriungi saw 500 people accept Christ. Intense follow-up
activities are built into the crusades, and the new converts are matched with local
churches, provided with Bibles, and invited to attend Bible study and discipleship
courses, Tippit told NIRR. Siberia always has been a fruitful region for his
ministry "because of the religious vacuum -- something has to rise up there,"
Tippit said. 
<BR>...Tippit was asked to preach at the prison where Georgy Vins, the imprisoned Russian pastor who became the subject of international attention in the
1970s, was held for a year and a half before his release. "It was a sobering
experience," Tippit said, "because I realized that much of the peoples' openness
is due to our martyrs" and the prayers of the persecuted for their persecutors.

More than 65,000 people in Costa Rica turned out Feb. 8-11 for a crusade

2,400 trained counselors. It was the largest such event in Costa Rica's history,

There is a deep spiritual hunger among people in Haiti, who are suffering
from an "identity crisis" in the wake of voodoo's failure to defeat the U.S.
invasion last fall, Youth With A Mission's Haiti Director Terry Snow told NIRR.
Before U.S. forces entered the country, voodoo priests, called hogans, conducted
animal sacrifices in military barracks and performed ceremonies to thwart the
invasion. The successful campaign discredited the religion, Snow said. "When
they lost voodoo, they lost their identity. But we are showing them they can have
a new identity in Christ." 
<BR>...After last month's annual Haiti for Jesus conference (NIRR 1/23/95),
more than 350 Haitians have made decisions for Christ, including 80 after one
drama presentation. "We've never seen anything like that," Snow said. During
the crusade after the conference, about 250 people were converted.

A program that has a 70% success rate at helping rescue troubled marriages among Catholics has been adapted for a wider audience. Retrouvaille
(French for recovery), which began in Quebec in 1977, is used by Catholics in
36 states and seven countries (NIRR Special Supplement 11/1/93). Unlike
programs designed to improve basically sound marriages, Retrouvaille is for
couples "in misery" who are barely tolerating each other, said Angela Dunbar.
She and her husband, Loren, "translated" Retrouvaille materials, with the Catholic Church's permission, to a version suitable for Protestants. The Dunbars, who
are Protestant, learned about Retrouvaille after facing problems in their marriage.
<BR>...Retrouvaille starts with a group-weekend at a hotel or retreat center. But
participants are not expected to talk about their problems to the group. Instead,
they are asked 13 questions about communication, sex, money, in-laws, and the
like. For each question, the couple retires to their room to write answers individually. Then, if possible, they discuss the answers with each other before returning to the group.
<BR>...Six structured follow-up sessions over the next three months build on
communications skills and insights learned about each other during the initial
weekend. Retrouvaille doesn't ask couples to forgive each other until about the
fifth session, because doing so earlier is too hard for many people, Angela said.
For information, call the Dunbars at (505) 281-9576.

The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to decide whether a state can prevent
local governments from enacting measures aimed at protecting the civil rights of
homosexuals. At issue is a Colorado constitutional amendment that would forbid
the state or local jurisdictions from assigning protected status to homosexuals.
Voters in the state approved Amendment 2 in 1992, but the state Supreme Court
struck it down the following year. The ruling came after homosexuals and the
cities of Denver, Boulder, and Aspen challenged the measure. The court suggested last year that if the state wanted to protect the religious freedom of landlords
and employers opposed to homosexuality, it could permit religious exemptions to
anti-discrimination laws. The court also said that although parents have a constitutional right to teach their own values to their children, there is no requirement
that the government endorse those values.

One of the most important free-speech cases in several years is coming

review a ruling that forced Ohio officials to let the Ku Klux Klan exhibit a 10foot cross in a public park in Columbus for Christmas in 1993 (NIRR 12/13/93).
The state argued that a cross so close to the Statehouse would lead people to
think Ohio was endorsing Christianity. Lower courts in the case, Capitol Square
Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette, ruled for the KKK. They stressed the
government's duty to be impartial in allowing the use of any public forum. But
in similar cases, federal appeals courts have disagreed, stressing government
separation from religion. 
<BR>...The case "will finally deal with the issue of private displays of religious
symbols on public properties," said Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law

The third claimed she lost her house because she sent Tilton money. James

Several members of the 100-voice Swarthmore College chorus are
refusing to sing Johann Sebastian Bach's St. John Passion. They say it smacks of
anti-Semitism with its story of Jewish demands for the death of Jesus. The
chorus is scheduled to sing at a gathering next month. A Jewish religion major
first raised the objection after reading the English translation of the piece, news
reports said. Since then, debate about the issue has swept across the Quakerfounded liberal arts college outside Philadelphia.

The KGB is trying to thwart International Russian Radio/TV, according to
John Haukka, director of North American affairs for the group. The ministry
broadcasts the gospel on state radio and television networks to 300 million
people in the former Soviet Union. On Feb. 8, its Moscow office and equipment
were taken over illegally by its office manager, a Christian pastor, Haukka told
NIRR. Although the pastor later confessed betrayal and returned the equipment,
the building already had been sold.
<BR>...Judging from past experiences "the footsteps lead suspiciously to the
KGB," Haukka said. In 1990, a KGB agent posing as a Christian obtained
employment at the studio in Finland and began collecting information on the
ministry. The plan was exposed after he defected to Sweden, became a Christian,
and revealed everything to Haukka's brother, Hannu, founder and president of
the ministry. "Forgive me," the agent told him, "I was sent to destroy you, but
couldn't go through with it."  
<BR>...IRR/TV "has been a ministry of miracles since day one," Haukka said.
Originally producing underground videos, the ministry was offered a contract to
air its programming on Channel 1, the state supported network, after a brief clip
generated thousands of requests for similar shows. "We aired a whole year of
Christian programming with the Communists still in power -- that's the biggest
miracle of all," Haukka said. When communist leaders, vexed by the queries of
their watching grandchildren, tried to have the shows blocked, the entire programming department of Channel 1 threatened to quit, according to Haukka.

Victims of clergy abuse urged a panel of Catholic bishops to turn over
suspected pedophiles to police and stop trying to handle matters themselves.
"Bishops shouldn't be doing the investigation of criminals," said Barbara Blaine
of SNAP, the Chicago-based Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.
SNAP also asked that every U.S. bishop give them names of abusive priests who
pleaded guilty or were permanently removed from ministry, according to Religion News Service. The group reportedly maintains a database of more than 550
abusive priests, culled from court records, media reports, and its 2,100 members.
<BR>...It was the first time representatives of SNAP met with the seven-member
sexual abuse panel, which reviews policy on clergy misconduct for the nation's
185 Catholic dioceses. The panel took no action on the SNAP requests.

Contemporary Christian music has become the fastest-growing form of
popular music in the United States, according to The Gospel Music Association.
Record sales and concert receipts total $1 billion a year. Recordings by Petra,
DC Talk, Sandi Patty, Michael W. Smith, and Steven Curtis Chapman all have
sold at or above a million copies. Outselling them all is Amy Grant, 34, who has
sold 15 million secular and religious records in her 17-year career. Ten years
ago, fewer than 200 stations played contemporary Christian music. Now there are
more than 500, Forbes magazine reported.
<BR>...Corporate executives have taken notice. Three years ago, all of the record
companies producing contemporary Christian music were independently owned,
The New York Times reported. They have since been bought out by large music
companies. Also, many prominent secular record labels and music-publishing
firms are creating contemporary Christian music divisions.

CBS-TV ordered a new batch of episodes of Christy, a series based on the
life of the mother of the late Christian writer Catherine Marshall (NIRR
11/28/94). The show's Hollywood producer, Ken Wales, an evangelical, said
high ratings accounted for the CBS move. The initial eight-segment series and a
Thanksgiving special garnered "Super Bowl numbers" in parts of the Midwest,
he told Religion News Service. New episodes may start airing this month.
<BR>...Religion, spirituality, and family issues increasingly will be common
themes on prime-time TV, NBC President Warren Littlefield predicted. NBC was
ready when actress Patty Duke last year proposed a show starring her as a
minister, he said. The series, Amazing Grace, will debut April 1.

A national poll of children 10 to 16 found that large numbers of kids are
concerned about the influence of the mass media on values. Among the findings:
66% of respondents said they think people their age are influenced by what they
see on TV; 65% said some TV shows encourage children to disrespect their
parents; 62% said that sex in TV shows and movies influences kids to have sex.
Yet 82% believed TV should help teach children right from wrong, according to
Children Now, the advocacy group that commissioned the survey.

An independent Christian movie producer is trying to demonstrate to
Hollywood that people want to see more wholesome movies. Sybil Robson left
Universal Studios and formed her own production company, Robson Entertainment, to make films that reflect positive values. Originally from Oklahoma,
Robson said parents are dissatisfied with movies. "When I go home and they
find out I'm a producer, they come out with their rolling pins," she told NIRR.
Her company's first production, Gordy, is for parents and children, Robson said.
The movie is about a pig who keeps his vow to save his family from the sausage
factory. "He is a promise-keeping pig," Robson said. The movie is scheduled to
open in 1,000 theaters May 5, but free previews will be shown in 100 cities
March 25. Robson encouraged people who wish to show Hollywood they want
more family entertainment to come to the free screenings. To find the nearest

Pat Robertson sold his two Washington, D.C.-based radio news services,
StandardNews and ZapNews, to Major Networks, Inc., of Chicago. The two
services were owned by Broadcast Equities, Inc., a subsidiary of U.S. Media
Corp., part of Robertson's Virginia Beach-based Christian Broadcasting Network.
StandardNews, started in January 1993, has a staff of about 50 and provides
hourly newscasts to some 600 stations across the country. ZapNews, acquired in
September 1993, has about 10 employees and serves 300 broadcast-outlet
subscribers, according to CBN spokesman Gene Kapp. Under the agreement, BEI
laid off about 20 members from the staffs, said Roy Simpson, vice president of
radio for Major Networks.

Marijuana use among American youth is increasing. Twice as many juveniles tried pot last year than in 1992, according to a University of Michigan study.
"It's time to sound the alarm," said Lee Brown, director of the White House
Office on Drug Control Policy. The potency of today's marijuana is five to 10
times that of the marijuana of the 1950s, Brown said. A popular new way to
smoke marijuana is with "blunts," gutted cigars stuffed with pot.

Religious leaders are taking sides over Dr. Henry Foster, Jr.'s nomination
as U.S. Surgeon General. Officials of the 8.2-million-member National Baptist
Convention USA, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Church of God in

Baptist Convention last month issued statements backing him. Opposing Foster
are leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention and a number of pro-life and
other groups, including Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council.
They cite a past that included more abortions than he initially reported as well as
controversial medical procedures.

The Bible Roadmap Series is a correspondence course for Bible study
over the Internet. The course, written by Monroe Hawley of Michigan Christian
College, is a 30-lesson study that takes readers through the Bible. Jim Hill, a
systems engineer at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, decided to
introduce the course after more than 60,000 people signed up for another study
program on the Internet. Participants will receive the materials free through their
electronic mail boxes. They also will be paired with an "instructor," a volunteer
layperson who will offer assistance and grade the material. Thirty people volunteered to be instructors. Hill anticipates the program will be ready early this
month. For more information contact Hill at (205) 731-9570 or through the
Internet at jim@jsf.uab.edu.

A Connecticut pastor performed the wedding ceremony for his son's
killer. Walter Everett, pastor of The United Methodist Church of Hartford,
Conn., officiated at the nuptials of Michael Carlucci last November. Carlucci
pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the second degree for shooting Scott Everett to
death in 1987. He received a 10-year sentence, which was suspended after five.
While Carlucci was in prison, Everett corresponded with, and eventually visited
him. Carlucci told him that, after receiving Everett's first letter, he knelt in his
prison cell and asked God for forgiveness. In the prison, after an hour-long
discussion, the two men stood, shook hands, embraced, and cried, Everett said.
Christians "won't be able to understand why Jesus came and what Jesus is all
about unless we forgive," he said. Carlucci runs a trucking business and spends
his spare time speaking to inmates about what God has done in his life.

school outing run by New Tribes Mission.
Andrew Nicholson, 14, son of Southern
Baptist missionaries Glenn and Pauline
Nicholson from Arkansas, was stung by a
swarm of bees that drove him off a 100foot cliff. Classmate Andrew Scoble, 16,
son of New Tribes missionaries, was
hospitalized. Bees forced a U.S. military
helicopter to retreat, delaying recovery of
Nicholson's body by U.S. Special Forces
troops until the next day.

<A NAME="CAMPOLO,OTHERSCRITICIZEFALWELL"><H3>CAMPOLO, OTHERS CRITICIZE FALWELL FOR SELLING ANTI-CLINTON VIDEOTAPES</H3></A>
<P>
Prominent evangelicals criticized Jerry Falwell for selling videotapes that
raise serious allegations against President Clinton. The tapes, Clinton's Circle of
Power and The Clinton Chronicles, depict Clinton, who was then governor of
Arkansas, as a womanizer using government money to pay for affairs, a cocaine
user and part of a drug-smuggling operation, and the person responsible for
several mysterious deaths. Hillary Clinton is accused of having sex with Vince
Foster, a Clinton friend and White House aide who, officials say, committed
suicide. The tapes were produced by California-based Citizens For Honest
Government. Falwell sold about 40,000 of them, at $40 for the set of two, during
broadcasts of The Old Time Gospel Hour last spring and summer. About 60,000
copies have been marketed by other groups.
<BR>...Until now, evangelical leaders and broadcasters remained largely silent
about the tapes. But Tony Campolo, a sociology professor at American Baptistrelated Eastern College who is a personal friend of the president, last month
demanded time on Falwell's show to rebut them. In a letter, Campolo told
Falwell he was stepping in to defend Clinton because it is inappropriate "for
someone in his position" to do so himself. Campolo, who preaches in evangelical
and mainline circles, said Falwell preaches the gospel effectively, but confuses it
with conservative politics, and that "is not good for the church of Jesus Christ."
<BR>...But Falwell refused to allow Campolo on his show. "The President has at
his disposal the greatest amount of free media in the world," Falwell spokesman
Mark DeMoss told NIRR. "It is a little stretch to say he doesn't have the forum"
to respond to the tapes. Opening the show to anyone who demands time would
be inappropriate, DeMoss said. "We wouldn't ask for time in his (Campolo's)
classroom to challenge things he said." DeMoss said Falwell is willing to talk to
Clinton or any of his staff about the tapes.
<BR>...Other leaders have criticized the tapes. E. Brandt Gustavson, president of
the National Religious Broadcasters, told The Washington Post the tapes have
"no place in religious broadcasting." David Neff, executive editor of Christianity
Today, said someone should "independently speak to the allegations."

Several Evangelical Free churches are showing compassion to traumatized pastors who have left their ministries. Each of the nine congregations
commits itself to work with an EFCA pastor who may be burned out, depressed,
fired, or shamed by personal sin. The care, which also is available to missionaries and other EFCA Christian workers and their families, lasts as long as necessary for the pastor to recover and become productive.
<BR>...A "befriending team" helps find temporary employment and housing for
the pastor and his family. Some recovery churches build a house for their guests,
use a parsonage, or allocate rent money in the church budget. The team also
provides spiritual, psychological, vocational, and financial counseling.
<BR>...The local church is "exactly the kind of context in which healing can
take place," said John Herman, executive director of the EFCA Ministerial
Association. Pastors get time to rest, relax, and "not be dealing with pastoral
pressures at the same time." Recovery Churches have helped several pastoral
families return to ministry or make the transition to other careers, he said. For
information, call (612) 853-1766.

President Clinton appealed to the religious community to help Americans
forge a "new social compact" of responsibility, opportunity, and citizenship in his
Jan. 24 State of the Union Address. "America's religious leaders and their
congregations can make all the difference" in helping those "savaged by the
breakdown of all we hold dear," he said.
<BR>...Clinton introduced pastors John and Diana Cherry of the African
Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Temple Hills, Md., adjacent to crime-ridden
southeast Washington, D.C. In the 1980s, they left government service to begin
a house church. Today the church has 17,000 members and is growing by 200 a
month, Clinton said. It ministers to families, reaches out in the area, and is
building a sanctuary closer to a higher-crime area "because they thought it was
part of their ministry to change the lives of the people who needed them."

Relief agencies should take sides and press for political and military action
when confronted with conflicts involving genocide or acts of aggression, according to Dr. Alain Destexhe. He is head of the Paris-based Doctors Without Borders aid group. Destexhe told a Washington, D.C., news conference that the
"emergency ethic" of relief groups works against victims in places like Rwanda
and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In Rwanda, he alleged, relief efforts helped the killers,
possibly preparing the way for a new round of genocide. He said his group
pulled out after taking stock of the situation. Doctors Without Borders reported it
deployed 3,000 volunteers from 45 nations to some 70 countries last year.

Though unanticipated obstacles have led the CoMission (NIRR 7/25/94)
to reduce its numerical goals, "we are doing exactly the strategy we wanted to,"
Director of Communication Ivey Harrington told NIRR. Since many regions of
the Commonwealth of Independent States are closed to foreign missionaries, the
Fort Mill, S.C.-based group has reduced its original goal of placing 12,000
educators in the 120 administrative school districts there. The CoMission's
strategy of teaching morality and ethics to teachers is having success, however,
according to Chief of Staff King Crow. At the invitation of government officials,
CoMission leaders were asked to share their ethics-and-morality curriculum with
250 people at a five-day Federal Educators Conference. The group hosted a
conference for some 200 teachers from Bulgaria, Russia, Ukraine, and Albania.
<BR>...Though still on the central government's "blacklist," the CoMission
continues its activities in Ukraine with the support of local leaders (NIRR

operating in Ukraine, indiscriminately lumps the mission agency in with cults,

Forty-five leaders representing most of Rwanda's Protestant denominations
gathered in Nairobi, Kenya, for the Rwanda Church Leaders Meeting. Organized
by the Association of Evangelicals of Africa, the meeting was intended to foster
reconciliation among Rwandan churches so that, in time, the whole country can
be reunited, according to Reg Reimer of World Evangelical Fellowship, who
facilitated the meeting. Although time and logistical problems prevented the
participation of Catholic leaders, organizers intend to include them in future
events, Reimer added.
<BR>...Stressing that reconciliation begins with telling the truth, one pastor said
the leaders must confront the fact that "people who took communion on Sunday
were killing other Christians." Another acknowledged the need to accept responsibility for the sins of their flocks. One Episcopal bishop confessed his bitterness
and anger, leading another minister to repent of his sins against the bishop. The
pastors, most of whom are in refugee camps in Zaire, Tanzania, or Kenya,
promised to urge the country's leaders to repent, to take the message of reconciliation back to their people, and to foster communication among disparate refugee
groups. Despite these hopeful signs, it is still too early to expect dramatic
progress, Reimer said. "Losses are too great and the issues are too complex."

Evangelical leaders and theologians resolved differences over Evangelicals and Catholics Together (NIRR 4/4/94), the statement of Catholic-Protestant cooperation issued last spring. The group was called together last month by
Charles Colson. It also included J.I. Packer and Bill Bright, who signed the
document, and John Ankerberg, Michael Horton, John MacArthur, R.C. Sproul,
Joseph Stowell, John Woodbridge, and D. James Kennedy. Many signers previously had said that the document skirted important theological differences
between Protestantism and Catholicism (NIRR 10/31/94).
<BR>...The evangelicals affirmed that justification by faith alone in Jesus Christ
is central to the gospel. A statement signed by Bright, Colson, Kent Hill, and
Packer said cooperation with Catholics "does not imply acceptance of Roman
Catholic doctrinal distinctives or endorsement of the Roman Catholic Church
system." The signers said they rejected proselytizing for denominational aggrandizement, but affirmed that "evangelism and church planting are always legitimate, whatever forms of church life are present already." The document is being

Church members are giving a smaller portion of their income to churches,
but are going into debt to purchase more luxury items, according to a Lilly
Endowment-funded annual report on church contributions. The report, by
researchers John and Sylvia Ronsvalle of empty tomb, inc. (NIRR 1/24/94),
covers giving patterns in 29 U.S. denominations from 1958 through 1992.
Overall, church members gave 2.52% of their income to churches in 1992, down
from 3.14% in 1958. Hardest hit: missionary and other benevolent causes outside
the local church. Viewed in 1987 constant dollars, support for such causes has
decreased 1.8% in the past 25 years, compared to a 24% increase in support for
local church needs. Congregational funding for 600 Protestant missionary-sending
agencies in the United States has remained flat since 1987, at about $2 billion,
the study said. In comparison, it noted that Americans spend $4 billion annually
on craft sales, $32 billion on diet programs, and $40 billion on leisure travel.
<BR>...There are three reasons for the findings, the Ronsvalles said. First, church
members express confusion about the purpose of denominational structures.
Second, the exodus of women into the work force left few volunteers to promote
missions and stewardship. Last, members have formed attitudes toward money
that are unconnected to their church or faith.

A proposed new law introduced in the Russian parliament contains

would require foreign religious workers to show an official invitation from
Russian counterparts. It also would require them to meet certain accreditation
standards. And it could affect some who travel to Russia from the West on
tourist visas and engage in religious work. The law specifically seeks to curtail
the activity of Western evangelicals who developed campaigns to teach Christian
values in public schools following the collapse of communism, religious freedom
experts in Moscow told BP. Parliament two years ago passed a Russian Orthodox-backed bill aimed at curtailing evangelical activities, but Russian President

New changes in tax law make it more likely that ministers will have to file
income taxes as employees rather than as self-employed individuals, said tax
expert Richard Hammar of Springfield, Mo. If a church provides a Form W-2,
and the pastor reports that income on Line 7 of Form 1040 this year, then he or
she likely is filing correctly as an employee, he said. Most pastors have a "dual
status" when filing their returns. They are self-employed for Social Security
purposes, and pay their own FICA tax. But they also are employees for income
tax purposes, though their taxes are not withheld from paychecks, and they must
pay taxes quarterly. Also, they are eligible for tax breaks such as a housing
allowance. Special offerings and both congregational and designated individual
cash gifts to a minister should be reported on the W-2, Hammar said. Ministers
are in a category slated for special attention and audits this year, he added.
<BR>...A recent Tax Court ruling applies a sevenfold test in determining whether
the pastor is an employee. Among them: the church has the right to determine
how a minister performs work for the church; the church provides or pays for his
or her office; and the church has the right to discharge the worker.
<BR>...Self-employed people can deduct unreimbursed business expenses on
Schedule C or A, and ministers often take advantage of this provision, Hammar
says. But, he suggests, they should adopt an accountable reimbursement plan
with the church instead.

Reactions have varied to the ecumenical youth conference "Celebrate:

dozens of Christian denominations, gathered in Manila last month to discuss
ways to crack down on what they say is a global network of pornographers. 
<BR>...The technology of pornography is changing rapidly, the leaders said. The
worldwide computer network known as the Internet is "filled with hard-core
pornography," Deen Kaplan of the Religious Alliance Against Pornography said.
The end of the Cold War and liberalization of trade with the West brought
pornography into newly free countries, religious leaders from Russia, Eastern
Europe, and parts of Africa said. "Sex tourism" also has become commonplace in
10 countries in Asia, leaders said. Pedophiles molest large numbers of children
during long trips in Asia and sometimes record their acts on film or video.                        
<P>
The American Psychiatric Association no longer identifies pedophilia -sexual desire in an adult for a child -- as a psychiatric disorder, the American
Family Association said. The APA said pedophilia should be diagnosed merely
as a drive seeking to be fulfilled. Identical changes for diagnosing sexual sadism,
masochism, transvestitism, voyeurism, and exhibitionism were made in the
group's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.
<BR>...The American Medical Association stopped recommending efforts to
turn unhappy homosexuals into heterosexuals. Reversing policy, the group called
for "nonjudgmental recognition of sexual orientation by physicians."

U.S. soldiers in Haiti are sharing small co-ed tents with no barriers for
privacy, the Washington Times reported. About 6% of U.S. forces in Haiti are
women. One married male officer was housed with a young female officer who
"made it known she was open to intimate relationships," the Times said. Another
military wife expressed outrage at her husband's situation.

Wisconsin pro-lifers delivered roses with anti-abortion messages to Gov.
Tommy Thompson and state legislators. The purpose was to remind politicians
that unborn children should be protected, said leaders of Pro-Life Wisconsin.

Legislators in Vermont held a heated debate over saying the Pledge of Allegiance. The House approved a resolution calling for recitation of the pledge once
a week, but opponents said they were being forced to prove their patriotism.

Z Music Television, a 24-hour contemporary Christian music network, is
broadcast to 20 million homes nationwide and to a million U.S. service personnel
in 138 foreign countries. The network's format of Christian contemporary videos
and music news promotes Christian artists and spreads the gospel, president Ken
Yates told NIRR. Programming blocks are targeted to cover mainstream teen and
college crowds, alternative and hard rock fans, and adult contemporary listeners.
Programs feature artists such as D.C. Talk, Petra, Steve Taylor, Guardian, Amy
Grant, and Carman. Launched in 1993, Z Music joined Gaylord Entertainment
Company, owner of The Nashville Network and majority owner of Country
Music Television in 1994 (NIRR 5/30/94). Cities that receive Z Music include:
Bristol, Tenn.; Logansport, Ind.; Petersburg, Va; and Whittier, Calif.

New Senate Chaplain Lloyd Ogilvie told reporters he will adhere to the
pastoral priorities set by his predecessor. Ogilvie, 64, pastor of 4,500-member
First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, Calif., for the past 22 years, was elected
to the $115,700-a-year post by unanimous consent of the Senate last month. He
succeeds Richard Halverson, 79, who retired Feb. 5. Halverson, who ministered
to the senators, their families, and staff in addition to opening daily Senate
sessions with a two-minute prayer, "has set the benchmark" for future chaplains,
Ogilvie said. Although the post is for a two-year term, incumbents routinely are
re-elected until retirement. Early in his ministry, Halverson had been an assistant
pastor at the same Hollywood church. Ogilvie, a broadcaster and author of 45
books, said he will shut down his radio and TV ministry around Easter. James
Ford, the House chaplain, was re-elected last month.
<BR>...Ogilvie and his church were sued last month by a former member of his
congregation. Elisabeth Saret claims she became pregnant during an affair with a
church elder who worked in the same law firm where she had worked. Her suit
charges that Ogilvie talked her out of an abortion, then refused to counsel her
further after she tried to kill herself. The minister told The Associated Press he
had counseled her regarding her pregnancy, but denied having known she had
tried to commit suicide. Had he known, he said, he would have referred her to
one of the church's trained professional counselors or its counseling center.                      
<P>
"I am not O.J.'s judge. God is," Rosey Grier told interviewers. Grier, the
former Los Angeles Rams star, is now a minister and serves as O.J. Simpson's
spiritual advisor. He said fame and riches caused Simpson to turn his back on
God years ago. But, he added, Simpson recently came back to God while in jail
awaiting his murder trial. In response to a TV reporter's question, Grier said that
as a minister he would keep his counselee's confidence, even if "an injustice"
had been disclosed. Grier added that if he were ordered to testify in court, there
would be "no jeopardy there [for Simpson]."
<BR>...Grier played a key role in uniting the divided Simpson defense team on
the eve of the trial, according to news accounts. Defense attorney Johnnie
Cochran, Jr., a longtime member and deacon of a Baptist church, assembled the
defense team in a room at the L.A. County courthouse, Time reported. Grier
presided over the session and turned it into a "very emotional" prayer meeting,
reporter Elizabeth Gleick said in a TV interview.
<BR>...Differences between the lawyers were set aside, and they reaffirmed their
commitment to Simpson, she said. Cochran said he asked Grier to lead prayer
meetings with the defense attorneys several times a week during the trial.                         
<P>
Television evangelist Jack Van Impe is distancing himself from a rumor
that United Nations forces are conspiring to invade the United States. Stories
published by Newhouse News Service and other news services blamed Van Impe
for starting a rumor that 50,000 foreign troops are being concealed in national
parks and underground cities throughout the United States. U.S. military spokesmen said the rumor is untrue.
<BR>...Van Impe "didn't say they're getting ready to invade." He merely was
passing along some information that had been given to his Rochester Hills,
Mich., ministry from other publications, John Lang, Van Impe's executive
director, told NIRR.
<BR>...One publication Lang cited is Relevance, published by Relevance Corporation of Birmingham, Mich. The publication's October 1994 edition describes "the
One World Movement's master plan," which is described as a conspiracy to
move American military forces out of the country and those of foreign nations
into the United States. A published story by Dave Helms of the Mobile Press
Register said invasion rumors were fueled by "informal militia groups springing
up around the country."

More than 260 Catholic clerics and religious leaders were murdered in
1994, most of them in Rwanda, News Network International reported. According
to figures released by the Vatican, 241 of the killings -- including three bishops,
101 priests and 64 nuns -- occurred in the central African country during the
ethnic slaughter there last year. About 21 missionaries were killed around the
world, including three in India, one in Uganda, and eight in Algeria.                              <P><A HREF="#MENU">Back to menu</A>

Jim Bakker received two standing ovations at a memorial service for his former
broadcast partner "Uncle" Henry Harrison. The past head of PTL ministries
spoke to nearly 2,000 people Feb. 12 at
the former Heritage USA complex in Fort
Mill, S.C. Bakker's sermon, which he
delivered at the request of Harrison's
family, was his first since being released
from prison after five years.
<BR>..."I've got my whole life in front of me,"
Bakker told the crowd, which was dominated by old friends and PTL supporters.
Grayer and thinner, Bakker spent the
hour on stage preaching about the power
of Jesus to save even sinners in prison.

Billy Graham, 76, said he may use video
to preach his own funeral message. Graham suggested to syndicated columnist
Cal Thomas on his CNBC cable program
that he might disclose hitherto confidential information at that time. Friends of
the evangelist speculated that it could be
anecdotes about national and international leaders who have died.

The American Bar Association chose Lee
Cooper, a Birmingham, Ala., lawyer, to
lead the 370,000-member group. The
ABA went on record as opposing any
congressional effort to return organized
prayer to schools. But Cooper, who said
he will use his influence to change ABA
policies, said that the return of prayer to
schools would be one step toward a
"spiritual revival" in the country.

Gary Bauer, head of the Family Research Council, has dismissed U.S. Surgeon General nominee Henry Foster,

One hundred students and faculty
members from Christian colleges and
Bible schools were briefed by officials at
the White House and Supreme Court
Justice Clarence Thomas this month.
They were part of the yearly Federal
Seminars sponsored by the National Association of Evangelicals. Students also
met numerous political and religious leaders during the weeklong program. The
seminars, in their 39th year, encourage
students to consider careers in public
service and help them appreciate the role
the Christian faith plays in government.
Some 800 youth attended World Changers, a conference featuring motivational
speakers and music in Boise, Idaho, Jan.
14. Idaho Family Forum, an interdenominational group, sponsored the event to
challenge young people in their Christian
faith the way Promise Keepers challenges men, the group said. Speakers included John Eldredge of Focus on the Family
and Ted Baehr of the Christian Film and
Television Commission.

The Christian College Coalition is
changing its name to the Coalition for
Christian Colleges and Universities. The
new title reflects the Washington, D.C.based group's expansion to include
worldwide non-member affiliates. The
CCCU includes 90 member institutions
that enroll a total of 130,000 students.
<P>
The number of Catholic seminarians in
the United States dropped 3.4% in the
last year, according to the Seminary Directory. At the start of the 1994-1995
school year, there were 6,030 students
for the priesthood, compared with 6,244
the previous academic year.

A group of 80 physically handicapped
Catholic nuns have given their lives to
prayer. They belong to monastic prayer
communities located in France, Japan,
Holland, England, Rhode Island, and
Pennsylvania. The groups are known as
the Sisters of Jesus Crucified. Physical
suffering that is dedicated to God can
take on great value, just as Jesus' suffering did, Sister Margaret Mary Nolan told
the Providence Journal-Bulletin.
<P>
The group that governs training of
physicians decided that obstetrical residents must be taught how to perform
abortions. The Accreditation Council for
Graduate Medical Education said residents must take training unless they have
a moral or religious objection. The council can withhold accreditation from hospitals, which would then lose federal funds.

Among voters who consider abortion
a priority issue, pro-life supporters outnumber pro-choice supporters 2-1, a poll

"The terrorists have awakened courage
as much as fear," Gloria Steinem told
religious leaders Jan. 22 at New York's
Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine during a Convention for Peace at
Women's Health Centers. The event was

Brown Campbell, general secretary of
the National Council of Churches, said
her presence with 18 other leaders was
"a sign that things are changing" in the
religious community.

Minneapolis cannot offer health-care
benefits to the partners of homosexual

Parishioners at five Washington, D.C.area Catholic churches sat in stunned
silence as a letter was read from the
pulpit after Sunday mass. In it, Cardinal
James Hickey announced that four
priests who had served the churches
were removed after confessing to sexual
abuse of boys. The priests, who range in
age from 50 to 70, were sent to four separate treatment facilities.    
<P>
A survey of church secretary salaries
found that Mennonite churches tend to
pay the highest ($10.50 per hour fulltime, $9.20 part-time), and Christian
Churches (Disciples of Christ) the lowest
($7.25 full-time, $6 part-time). Large
churches (more than 1,000 members)
pay an average $9.74 per hour, and
churches with fewer than 300, $8.45.
Other findings for full-time secretaries:
72% are members of the churches where
they work; 98% receive paid vacation
leave, but only 47% receive medical insurance; 91% work with computers, with
60% doing desktop publishing. Results
were published in Profiles, a bimonthly
newsletter for church secretaries.

"Despite legal changes, religious persecution continues" in Cuba, according to a
State Department report on human rights
abuses around the world. Foreign evangelists recently have been allowed to visit

groups, requires churches to register,

Benin: A Christian church won a legal
battle with fetishists who worship snakes.
Fetishists stole the Azoule'-Cada Baptist
Church's sign after church members
killed two pythons they found in their
beds rather than letting them go. The
government told the fetishists to return
the sign and stop leaving snakes in the
beds. The village's mayor then authorized the church to show Christian films,
and more than 250 people attended.

South Africa: Accused of embezzling
Scandinavian aid funds, anti-apartheid
clergyman Allan Boesak withdrew as
South Africa's ambassador-designate to
the United Nations. He said he would sell
his luxury home in a Cape Town suburb
to repay funds missing at the Foundation
for Peace and Justice, which he heads.
Press accounts place the amount between $600,000 and $1 million. Boesak

Sudan: Proclaiming religious tolerance,
Christian and Muslim groups in Sudan
have agreed to fight together against
fundamentalist Muslims in that country's
bloody civil war. The Islamic Umma Party
and the mostly Christian rebel groups

China: Vatican Radio broadcast a message from eight bishops of the clandestine Catholic Church in China. Beamed to
China, the messages focused on the
need for Chinese Catholics to remain
united with the pope. China's communist
rulers broke ties with the Vatican after
seizing power in 1949, and then set up
an independent Catholic church. However, Rome estimates that some 5 million
to 8 million Catholics there remain loyal
to the pope.
<P>
Israel: Many cars that are stolen from
Israel are resold in Palestine and "every
[Palestinian] car seller has an Israeli partner," Newsweek reported. Two Israeli soldiers recently were charged with smuggling dozens of cars into Gaza. Cooperation between Palestinian and Israeli police is practically nonexistent, and a deputy police chief in Gaza acknowledged
that most of his force's cars were stolen
from Israel.

Christian churches in Kobe, Japan, are gaining a higher profile in the
aftermath of last month's earthquake. Because churches are providing food,
shelter, and other aid, the Japanese are gaining a greater awareness of Christian
values, Kathy Anderson of Food for the Hungry told NIRR. Christians have
given their homes, time, and goods, although they themselves have suffered great
losses. Japanese people are generally reserved, but they are beginning to ask
questions about the church, Anderson said from the Mukonoso Evangelical Free
Church in Kobe. While touring the area on bicycles, Anderson and other staff
noticed that, even in the hardest-hit areas, many churches still are standing. She
speculated that God spared them for use as shelters and relief centers.
<BR>...Global Mission, Billy Graham's crusade to be televised to 165 countries
March 16-18 (NIRR 1/9/95), lost most of its 30 viewing sites in Kobe during the
quake. City leaders agreed to help by bulldozing an entire city block to clear an
area for an open-air meeting by satellite on a large screen. "Some of the greatest
meetings we have held in Japan have been in the Osaka-Kobe area," Graham
said at a Feb. 7 press conference to officially launch Global Mission.

An entire village near Yelets, Russia, turned to Christ in a single meeting,
Southern Baptist missionaries Larry Lindsey and Norman Lytle said. The men
went to Yelets to deliver $14,000 given by Binghamtown Baptist Church in
Middlesboro, Ky., Baptist Press said. The money was used to buy a building for
a 25-member congregation, the only evangelical group in the city of 140,000.
<BR>...A elderly woman in a nearby village, apparently the only believer there,
heard about the missionaries' visit to Yelets and arranged for a service in her village. All 80 villagers attended. Several of the Yelets believers sang, and both
missionaries preached during a two-hour service. As the service concluded, the
translator asked all who wished to profess faith in Christ as Savior to step forward. All 80 came forward. Lindsey thought they had misunderstood the appeal,
and explained further. They all said they understood perfectly and wanted to
become Christians. The elderly woman invited them to her home for a weekly
Bible study, which the Yelets Christians said they would help organize.

At least 1,000 Peruvians accepted Christ last month at a prayer meeting
that turned into a rally, evangelist Alberto Mottesi (NIRR 9/19/94) told NIRR.
About 20,000 people gathered in the Plaza de Armas in Lima, the center of
Peru's capital. A large number of unbelievers, including government leaders and
the families of a presidential and vice-presidential candidate, attended unexpectedly and responded to the gospel message. 
<BR>..."There are seasons of the Holy Spirit for nations and I believe Peru is at
its highlight," Mottesi said. In the past, evangelical church growth averaged 7%
in the mostly Catholic country, but in 1994 the church grew by 30% and 3,000
new churches began, Enrique Chirinos of the National Evangelical Peruvian
Council said. The determination of church leaders and the turmoil of Peruvian
society are factors in this growth, Mottesi said.

The so-called Toronto Blessing is manifesting itself in hundreds of German
Protestant churches, reports idea, the information service of the German Evangelical Alliance. The phenomenon (NIRR 7/11/94) is characterized by uncontrollable laughter, shaking, crying, and collapsing under the power of the Holy Spirit.
It began at the Toronto Airport Vineyard Church in 1993 and has moved into
many parts of the world.
<BR>...Reaction among German evangelicals is mixed. Rolfe Hille of the
German Evangelical Alliance termed it "religious madness" though not antiChristian. Rudi Penke of the Christian Centre in Frankfurt predicted the number
of churches swept into it will double within a few months.

Calling Christianity a "foreign religion that is culturally disruptive," many
African writers and academics advocate a return to traditional African religions,
according to Mark Shaw of Scott Theological College in Kenya. But the claims
"lack a historical consciousness and misunderstand the mass of 19th-century
missionary work," Shaw told NIRR. Shaw, the missionary scholar in residence at
the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College, is writing The Kingdom of God in
Africa. It argues that Christianity is an authentic African religion with roots
dating to the second century in Egypt and the fourth century in Ethiopia. Many
Western missionaries who evangelized Africa were freed slaves and Caribbean
blacks who returned to spread the gospel, the book notes.

Challenging evangelicals with a "radical Christian social ethic" is the task
of Evangelical Contribution on Northern Ireland (11/14/94). Through literature,
conferences, and traveling "roadshows," ECONI encourages evangelicals to
renounce "ethnic tribal nationality" and embrace the principles of peace, reconciliation, and forgiveness, Development Officer David Porter told NIRR. The
group's slogan, "For God and His Glory Alone," is a direct challenge to those
Christians whose slogan "For God and Ulster" reflects the church's "besetting
sin" of identifying God along ethnic and national lines, Porter said.
<BR>...The group hosts an annual conference, which last year featured scholar
John Stott speaking on Christian citizenship, and encourages participation in a
yearly ECONI Sunday to reflect on the country's situation.

It's possible for a church to grow too large, superchurch pastor John
Bisagno told a Southern Baptist church-growth conference. Bisagno, who
preaches to 5,000 on Sunday mornings at First Baptist Church, Houston, said that
over the past few years his church has asked about 450 members to leave and
start new churches or revitalize struggling inner-city congregations. The 40
groups they helped nurture now have a Sunday school attendance of 3,000, he
said.

Charities cannot fill the gap that substantial cuts in federal funding of
social programs would create, 116 charitable organizations said in a statement.
The groups said spending by charities on social programs is only a fraction of
government funding, and that charities cannot replace major lost federal revenues
while meeting new needs, Independent Sector reported. Higher fees and dues will
put charitable services beyond the reach of those they are supposed to serve, the
groups said. Signers include the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the
National Council of Churches, the United Church of Christ's Office for Church
in Society, and several Catholic and Jewish groups.

Only half of the Southern Baptist Convention's 15 million members "contributed financially or attended at least one service last year," according to
Thomas Ascol. The pastor of a Baptist church in Coral Gables, Fla., Ascol also
edits The Founders Journal, published by a loosely knit group of Calvinists in
the SBC. He made his claim in a special issue that will be mailed to SBC
pastors, missionaries, seminary professors, and other leaders.
<BR>...One reason for the SBC's apparent growth is a high percentage of nonresident and inactive members, many of whom are not really Christians, he
wrote. He blames the influx of alleged non-Christians on "modern evangelistic
technique...geared toward getting a sinner to agree with some facts and recite a
prayer." He and other Journal writers urged the SBC to stress such doctrines as
election, the sovereignty of God, and the inability of people to repent and
exercise faith unless God first regenerates them. Ascol said numerical growth is
not necessarily a sign of spiritual vitality.

Toward a Theology of Mission and Evangelism for a New Century, a
conference of United Methodists, brought together missions and evangelism
professors, missions agency directors, and church leaders to clarify the role of
missions. It was called the most inclusive UMC missions meeting in 40 years.
<BR>...The meeting provided a forum for discussion among missions theorists
and practitioners, Thomas Thangaraj of Candler School of Theology at Emory
University said. "We were trying to avoid the twin dangers of having an unreflective missions policy and an `ivory tower' missions agency," he said.
<BR>...At the heart of the discussion was a division of thought between those
who emphasize acts of charity and those who say that the verbal proclamation of
the gospel is primary. Although the question went unresolved, all participants
agreed that the purpose of missions is to proclaim Jesus Christ as Savior.

Defying the church's official teaching, the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, D.C., declared that homosexuals who live together in monogamous
relationships should be "honored." The statement was adopted 134-32 at the
annual diocesan convention last month. It was drafted by Newark, N.J., bishop
John Spong last fall in response to a statement issued by theologically conservative bishops at the Episcopal Church's General Convention (NIRR 9/19/94). The
conservatives upheld the denomination's teaching that homosexual practice is
wrong, and rejected the concept of homosexual marriage. The Washington
diocese is the first to take an opposite stand.
<BR>...Denominational leaders said that although a number of bishops are
permissive on the issue of ordaining practicing homosexuals, an official blessing
of same-sex unions is nowhere in sight.

A book criticizing modern seminary education has raised controversy in
the United Methodist Church. Thomas Oden (NIRR 5/16/94), a professor at
Drew Theological School in Madison, Wis., and organizer of a movement of
traditionalists and moderates within the UMC, wrote Requiem: A Lament in
Three Movements. The book depicts seminary faculties as unconcerned about the
core of the Christian faith or interested only in their own careers, United Methodist News Service said. The book is "grossly unfair," according to Neal Fisher,
president of UMC-related Garrett Evangelical Theological Seminary in Evanston,
Ill. Executives of Abingdon Press, the book division of the United Methodist
Publishing House, said two books will be released soon reflecting other viewpoints on theological education.

they oppose as a way of obtaining materials and keeping abreast of their tactics.

Some 3,400 government, military, and business leaders from 170 countries
and 50 states gathered in Washington, D.C., for the annual National Prayer
Breakfast. Main speaker Andrew Young -- the former congressman, Atlanta
mayor, and United Nations ambassador -- emphasized that suffering binds people
to each other and to God in troubled times. President Clinton called for more
civility and less destructiveness in public debate. Supreme Court Justice Ruth
Ginzberg read passages from Deuteronomy in which God condemns bribery and
dishonesty, and calls for justice to be done. In the morning's main prayer, Gov.
John Engler, (R-Mich.), asked God to "send the Holy Spirit on our leaders." He
also asked for forgiveness of "our sins against the born and the unborn." It was
the only remark during the event that smacked of controversy, reminiscent of
Mother Teresa's denunciation of abortion at last year's breakfast. Billy Graham
spoke at several NPB meetings, including a banquet for internationals, a Prison
Fellowship event, and a dinner for 175 media people hosted by columnist Cal
Thomas. Half of the media people were non-Christians, Thomas noted.
<BR>...The breakfast is sponsored by the weekly House and Senate prayer breakfast groups. Its organizers are evangelistic members of a low-profile group
known as The Fellowship led by Doug Coe, a former Navigators missionary.
They packed two days of seminars and other meetings around the breakfast.                          
<BR>...Protestant and Catholic Church leaders from North Korea attended the
breakfast at the invitation of Graham, who visited their country last year (NIRR
2/7/94). The head of the delegation, the chairman of the Korean Catholics Association, later met with Clinton. It was the first time a delegation of North Korean
Catholics visited the United States and the first time a North Korean met with a
sitting president, John Akers, Graham's special assistant, told NIRR. The delegation stayed for 10 days, visiting with Graham in his North Carolina home and
touring several cities.
<BR>...After the breakfast, Clinton met for half an hour in the Oval Office with
eight religion writers. Apparently chafing from criticism in much of the media,
Clinton lamented the "inordinate premium" placed on "words that destroy." He
said he increasingly has less control over his reputation, but he has full control
over "my character." And, he added, "That's between me and God." He lashed
out at the Christian Coalition, calling it an arm of the GOP that is exploiting
Christians disturbed about what is happening in society.                                           
<P>
The story of Abraham and Isaac gave Air Force Lt. Col. Mike Couillard,
trapped with his son, Matthew, in a blizzard in the Turkish mountains, courage to
leave him to find help. The father and son, who were skiing when the blizzard
hit, constantly prayed in a cave that sheltered them for seven days, Couillard's
mother, Cecille, told NIRR. Mike's decision to leave the cave came as he prayed
and looked to the stars. "God spoke to him about Genesis 22 and told him He
keeps His promises," Cecille said. "He felt he was leaving him in God's hands."
Before he left his son, Couillard, a Catholic, told Matthew what could happen
and explained to him what heaven looked like. Couillard eventually made it to a
village, where he collapsed. Villagers rescued the boy.
<BR>...In Lisbon, Maine, the Couillard family and in-laws gathered daily to pray
for Mike and Matthew. Praying the night before they were found, Cecille said
she felt as if "someone was hugging me and telling me they would be OK."
About 150 people attended a mass of thanksgiving at Holy Trinity Parish Church
after news of the rescue.

<B>As the strength of drug cartels declines in Colombia, the evangelical church grows stronger</B>.
Avarice aroused by monstrous drug profits had "dismembered all of society," Bogota pastor
Howard Biddulph told NIRR. But problems of immorality and corruption, combined with
insecurity caused by bloody narco-wars between police and cartel members, have "opened the
filters and made it easy to evangelize," he said. 
<BR><B>...Evangelicals represent 4% of the 6 million population in the mostly Roman Catholic
country</B>. But their numbers have grown substantially in recent years, Nick Woodberry of
Christ for the Cities said. A turning point was 1991, when a new constitution removed the
Catholic Church's official status and guaranteed religious freedom for everyone. 
<BR><B>...Several countrywide evangelical initiatives are under way</B>. Luz Y Vida -- "Light and Life"
-- is house-to-house evangelism and discipleship sponsored by The Bible League, which
merged with World Crusades, Inc., of Colombia last year (NIRR 1/24/94). In five months this
year, 320,000 Scripture portions were distributed and 21,000 people made commitments to
Christ, TBL said. 
<BR><B>...The National Plan of Evangelization '95, an initiative of Latin American Ministries' Christ
for the Cities, works regionally</B>. In July, 45 pastors and 12 regional coordinators conducted
simultaneous evangelistic campaigns. 
<BR><B>...The CFC campaign stems from the work of evangelical churches in Medellin</B>. For
two-and-a-half years, evangelical Christians there have conducted house-to-house evangelism
and targeting the city with all-night prayer meetings. On the nights they pray, the number of
murders in the city declines, one pastor told Woodberry. The number of evangelical
Christians and churches in Medellin has doubled in the past nine years, Woodberry told
NIRR. 
<BR><B>...The change in Medellin began when the assassination of a presidential candidate in 1989 by
a drug cartel sparked a "semi-civil war" between the government and narcotics dealers, said
Woodberry, who spent eight years in Medellin</B>. People became more open to the gospel
because of fear and insecurity. 
<BR><B>...Colombia, one of the most violent countries in the world, has been ruled by drug cartels
since the early 1980's</B>. But fear of violence is not the only reason for evangelical church
growth; people are seeking spiritual answers. "There is a genuine interest among people to
discover what the Bible is teaching -- everyone is not afraid of getting shot," Bible League
Director of Latin American Ministries Edward Meyer told NIRR. NIRR 08/21/95

<B>Christian hostels in Thailand are saving tribal girls from becoming Bangkok prostitutes</B>. New
Horizon Hostel, in the northern city of Chiang Ri, helps girls from poor families, which may
be tempted to sell them. The girls are easy prey to pimps who promise them they'll get rich
or will have jobs as nannies or teachers. Bangkok, the "sin capital of Asia," has 700,000
female prostitutes, Operation World said. 
<BR><B>..."We beat them to the punch," New Horizon spokesman Don Rutland told NIRR</B>. The
Orange City, Fla.-based ministry has a "cadre of Christians" under its national director, an
Akha tribesman. When ministry workers realize a family is destitute, they persuade them to
let their daughter stay at the hostel. Food, clothing, and education, which are supplied free,
cost the ministry $50-$75 a month per child. Many of the girls leave after high school to take
jobs as seamstresses or mechanics, and some attend college, Rutland said. All the girls have
become Christians at some point, he said. One, whose father is the village witch doctor, wants
to bring the gospel to her village, he said. NIRR 08/21/95
<P>
<B>Some 220,000 Baptist youths worldwide have pledged to remain sexually pure until marriage</B>.
The True Love Waits pledge cards were on display at the 17th Baptist World Congress, held
Aug. 1-6 by the Baptist World Alliance in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Richard Ross, spokesman
for the True Love Waits Campaign in America, said events are being sponsored all over the
world to encourage teens and young adults to remain chaste.  
<BR><B>...Most of the pledges were collected at a True Love Waits rally in July 1994 in Washington,
D.C</B>. (NIRR 8/8/94). About 10,000 youth in Cameroon, Angola, Uganda, Nigeria, Philippines,
Jamaica, Slovakia, Hong Kong, Romania, Germany, Canada, Argentina, Chile, and Cuba also
made pledges in the last year, Ross said. In Cuba, 2,000 youth made the commitment.   
<BR><B>...BWA incoming president Nilson Fanini of Brazil exhorted the 8,000 delegates from 124
countries on six continents to double the number of Baptist churches and increase
membership by 60 million people by the year 2000</B>. The key to success is "togetherness,"
Fanini said. Baptists should work together in their countries and coordinate worldwide, even
though unity will be a challenge in areas such as South Africa and the former Yugoslavia.

<B>Some 500 volunteers from the United States participated in the Greater Nairobi Evangelistic
Crusade June 3-July 17</B>. The outreach was a cooperative effort between the Baptist Church in

<B>A filmed interview with Texas death-row inmate Stephen Nethery is having far-reaching
effects</B>. Nethery gave a dramatic, intense testimony May 25, just 37 hours before he received
a lethal injection for murdering a Dallas police officer in 1981. In the interview, Nethery
discussed his faith in Christ, which he gained shortly after his incarceration and developed
during 13 years on death row. Nethery, 32, had spent his time on death row developing "an
intimate relationship between himself and his Lord," Rosser McDonald, a Baptist Radio and
Television Commission producer, told NIRR. McDonald, who met Nethery during a 1990
interview, also conducted the final interview with him. Nethery did not ask God to deliver
him from the death penalty, but "prayed for God to use him, and for whatever time period he
wanted," McDonald told Baptist Press. The interview became a 30-minute television special
called Rejoice Evermore, which aired on ACTS and FamilyNet, the cable and broadcast
television services operated by the Southern Baptist Convention.  
<BR><B>...Prison ministries in Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, North
Carolina, Texas, and Virginia have used the video version of the interview to reach prisoners
and young people for Christ</B>. Recently, an evangelical group in Germany received permission
from the Southern Baptists to translate McDonald's film so it can appear on German
television. 
<BR><B>...Prisoner reaction to Nethery's testimony has been phenomenal, said Jerry Spicer, who runs
a prison ministry based in Altamonte Springs, Fla</B>. When Spicer shows the video in prisons,
he doesn't even have time to preach. "After seeing the video, guys would be on their knees
crying and giving their hearts to Christ." Nethery "comes across as honest and sincere," and
as coping well because of his relationship with Christ, Spicer said.

<B>Charles Colson, a long-time opponent of capital punishment, has changed his mind</B>. Colson,

Colson been the judge, he probably would have sentenced to death Susan Smith, convicted of
drowning her two children in a South Carolina lake. "No one is secure when your own parent
would kill you," said the founder of Prison Fellowship, a Christian group that helps prisoners,
ex-prisoners, and their families. The group's national and international boards of directors

<B>Russ Ford and Joe Vought minister to prisoners waiting to die</B>. Ford, a Southern Baptist
pastor, and Vought, an Evangelical Lutheran Church in America pastor, drive 100 miles from
Richmond, Va., to Mecklenburg Correctional Center one day each month to visit inmates on
death row. The pastors crouch at the portholes of cell doors so they can see each man and
grasp his hand while they talk. "Sometimes the porthole is a confessional," but other times the
men just need to laugh or hear the status of their cases, Vought told NIRR. Most of the 54
condemned men are poor, and some are mentally ill. Death row is "society's garbage heap,"
he said. Ford and Vought often become close friends with the condemned men -- and pay a
personal price in doing so. Ford suffered flashbacks and stress for two months after he first
watched an execution.  
<BR><B>...Although many death row inmates are lost and confused, some have transformed their lives</B>.
Amid the despondency and death -- Vought and Ford have witnessed numerous executions -are many success stories. In the last five years, 13 of the 16 men executed in Virginia came
to salvation in Christ before their deaths, Ford told NIRR. For the first few years of his
20-year involvement with prisoners, Ford's approach was purely clinical and unspiritual,
which he attributes to liberal educational training. But "after five years and six men dying
miserably, thank God He allowed me to wake up," Ford said. 
<BR><B>...Vought and Ford also reach out to victims' families through Gateway Parish, Inc., a group
they started a year ago</B>. Little spiritual help is available for victims and families touched by
violent crime, Vought said. Victims feel "a seething rage and despair" that needs to be dealt
with, he said.

message of hope to forlorn people, Vought said</B>. NIRR 08/21/95

<B>Messianic Jews in Brooklyn face opposition from "countermissionary" Jewish groups</B>. The
groups are waging a tug-of-war over the 60,000 former Soviet Jews flooding the New York

immigrants often are strangers to Judaism and vulnerable to theological persuasion, news
reports said. 
<BR><B>...Concerts of Russian music, Sabbath dinners, or free English classes are sponsored by the

evangelistic Christian activity. When Messianic Jews try to approach the immigrants on the

literature. In one case, 400 Orthodox Jews tried to shout down Passover services led by
messianic Chosen People Ministries, according to Stewart Weinisch, the group's area director.

"perhaps the Serbian Orthodox Church," according to Adventpress. If the Croatian Parliament
passes the law, it will mean a religious and constitutional crisis for the country, said Stanko
Jambrek, secretary of the Protestant Evangelical Council. The law will protect only the
Catholic Church and could mean "religious cleansing" of the unwanted "sects," he said.

their churches -- in outdoor worship services, homebound ministry, prison ministry, and youth
mission trips, the company said.

<P>
<B>Tanzania: Bandits kidnapped Southern Baptist missionaries near Mikumi National Park
outside Morogoro</B>. Three men with guns approached the group during a rest stop. Bill
Harrington of Richmond, Va., had stepped away from the car and saw the men beating David
Moreland of Monroe, La., and forcing the others into the car. After chasing them, Harrington

Four man-made caves were discovered last year, but the secret was kept to prevent them from

the Essenes, a Jewish sect that wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls.
<P>
<B>Israel: Two Jews visiting the Temple Mount were forced to leave when offended Muslims

through women to unite the Muslim world than through men," a delegate said.
<P>
<B>Philippines: Filipino police uncovered a Muslim plot to ransack two Christian towns, news
reports said</B>. Abu Sayyaf, a militant Muslim group that attacked the Christian city of Ipil

<B>Guatemala: Efrain Rios Montt (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/012395.html">NIRR 1/23</A>), reportedly an evangelical, can't run for president</B>.
His wife, Teresa, will run instead. The country's highest court said the constitution prohibits
the retired general from seeking the post because he seized power in a 1982 coup d'etat. The
administration of Rios Montt, who ruled for 17 months before being deposed, is accused of
destroying Indian villages and murdering leftists, news reports said.

offensive." The British Safety Council agreed to drop the posters.
<P>
<B>England: A professional photographer working on a project in London took a picture of a

Christ.
<P>
<B>Germany: In a move condemned by the Catholic German Bishops' Conference, a
Constitutional Court ordered that crucifixes on classroom walls in Bavaria be removed</B>. The
crosses violate religious neutrality guaranteed in the constitution, the court said. Bavarian
school regulations recommend that children be taught to "respect the Lord," according to
news reports. The government said it will seek ways to overturn the decision.
<P>
<B>Ireland: Brendan Smyth, a 68-year-old Irish Roman Catholic priest (NIRR 12/26/94), has been
charged with sexually abusing eight children over a 15-year period</B>. He faces 16 counts of

Steven Cook, who accused Cardinal
Joseph Bernardin of molestation (NIRR
5/2/94), apologized during a tearful twohour reconciliation at a Philadelphia seminary. Cook asked pardon "from the bottom of my soul," but said he needed to

and a gay friend. Cook, who is dying of
AIDS, settled his lawsuit against the other priest he accused, Ellis Harsham.
Harsham has left the priesthood.

The U.S. Congress will hold hearings
this year into the deaths of about 80
Branch Davidians who were killed in
Waco, Texas, during a government assault in April 1993, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich told reporters.
Since Canadian broadcasting laws
have been liberalized (NIRR 9/20/93),
two companies will seek permits to begin
airing all-Christian programming. Trinity
Television of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and
Crossroads Christian Communications,
Inc., of Burlington, Ontario, hope to begin
broadcasts by 1995. The law allowing
single-faith programming was passed in
1993, but the proposal and adoption of
guidelines delayed implementation.

Lubavitcher Hasidim have not named
a successor to rabbi Menachem Mendel
Schneerson, who died in June (NIRR
6/27/94). Many followers predicted that
Schneerson would rise from the dead

One observer said that not naming a
successor is very unusual, and it is not
clear whether Schneerson's adherents
have abandoned messianic claims, Christian Century reported.

The college Class of '98 is less interested in politics, less likely to drink, more

The Bangladesh High Court rejected
an appeal by self-exiled feminist writer
Taslima Nasrim (NIRR 6/13/94) to have a

More than 45 million Hindus are expected to bathe in India's Ganges river
during the 40-day festival of Ardh Kimbu.
The festival, which runs through February, occurs every six years, drawing Hindu faithful wishing to wash away their

One hundred seventy of the nation's white and black evangelical leaders
held a long-awaited Convention on Reconciliation (NIRR 3/21/94) in Chicago
Jan. 6-7. Denominational heads, parachurch leaders, and college and seminary
presidents from across the country proposed ideas to rid the church of "the sin of
racism," according to Billy Melvin, executive director of the National Association of Evangelicals, which is predominantly white. 
<BR>..."I sensed a powerful move of God, that significant steps were taken
toward real repentance and reconciliation," said Bishop George McKinney of the
Church of God in Christ, a predominantly black denomination. Divisions between evangelicals have been "a blight" on the witness of the church. "We came
together to repent of that," McKinney told NIRR. Evangelical leaders recognize
that the church "has been negligent in pursuing justice" and in "telling the truth
regarding human relations and the will of God," he said. Relations between the
races have been "dictated more by the world than by Scripture."   
<BR>..."The motives are good and we are going to do the right thing now,"
McKinney said. He described a working committee set up to evaluate and
implement ideas suggested by the leaders as a "necessary step." Deeply held
practices "don't just go away. It will be painful and there will be some resistance. God is at work and He will make the crooked straight and the rough
places plain."
<BR>...Leaders of the NAE and the National Black Evangelical Association,
which split from the NAE in 1950 (NIRR 3/21/94), have talked seriously for a
year about racial reconciliation. The willing attitude of white leaders "is the most
significant hope for anything substantive happening," Lloyd Lindo, NBEA
president, told NIRR. Lindo said he is trusting the white leaders in the NAE,
who have shown "obvious readiness" to confront racism. "Revival will not
happen, in spite of tons of prayers, until racism is expunged and reconciliation is
born," Lindo said.

to Col. Theodore Morris, the group's territorial commander in Japan, the Army
operates eight community centers, a children's home, and women's shelter in
Kobe. All Salvation Army officers were reported safe.

An inner-city congregation that twice has experienced tragedy is trying to
teach its young people about the dangers of guns. St. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church in Minneapolis is grieving over the shooting death of a Sunday school
student. Also, a young Sunday school teacher has been imprisoned on murder
charges. The 600-member, predominantly Southeast Asian congregation has a
youth program for about 100 youngsters. Many of them have had knives pulled
on them or friends who have been shot. Some are tempted to join gangs. 
<BR>...The church holds gun-safety classes for children. Three 45-minute
sessions combine instructional materials from the National Rifle Association with
demonstrations by local emergency room personnel, police, and gun experts.
Pastor Roland Wells said the gun-lobbying group offered the best educational
course for youth. He hopes the program at St. Paul's will be replicated across the
country. For information, call the church at (612) 874-0133 or the NRA's Eddy

A church in Lorain, Ohio, opens its school gymnasium to more than 100
of some of the area's poorest children each Saturday. Members of the nondenominational Church of the North Coast drive school buses throughout Lorain to
pick up youngsters ages 3-16. The volunteers put on skits and puppet shows,
lead children in songs, and prepare a snack. Then co-pastor Tina Kayatin weaves
in stories about the Bible with newspaper articles about people in crisis.
<BR>...Many of the Joshua Kids, as the children are called, never have been to
church or heard anyone talk about Jesus. Along with the Saturday program,
many Joshua Kids are sponsored by a family in the church. They pay $25 a
month into an account to send the child to camp and to buy gifts. "The idea is to
get Jesus into their heart. We know He won't leave them. The seed will grow

A former drug trafficker, extortionist, and gang leader now preaches the
gospel in the notorious Golden Triangle in Asia. David Yong Mo and his group
of evangelists, the Young Crusaders, draw 15,000-20,000 people to weekly openair crusades in east-central Myanmar (formerly Burma), located near Thailand
and Laos. Poppy fields dot the area, through which much of the world's heroin is
transported. Mo, 50, turned to Christ while near death after shooting heroin with
unclean needles. He is joined on the crusades by a rock band composed of
Christians who are former addicts.
<BR>...Mo's crusades apparently are unique in Myanmar, an isolated Buddhist
nation run by a repressive military junta. His group routinely is granted permits
to hold crusades because of the effectiveness of its drug-rehabilitation program in
the capital, Yangon. The residential school, which treats about 150 addicts,
combines counseling, Bible study, and vocational training, and has an 80% cure
rate. While recovering, many of the addicts suffer no withdrawal pangs because
of the power of prayer, Mo told NIRR. His facility has drawn the admiration and
curiosity of the World Health Organization and U.S. Department of State. But
Mo, who is supported by Advancing Native Missions of Charlottesville, Va., has
declined offers of financial aid from government groups because there are
"strings attached" that would compromise the gospel message, he said. Mo also
operates a home for abandoned and orphaned children and two leper colonies.

Evangelism opportunities are growing in India, according to an Assemblies
of God official. AG churches there grew from 1,392 to 2,795 in four years. Since
1990, membership doubled to 259,427 believers. The official, who wished to
remain anonymous, has 20 years of missionary experience in southern Asia. He
said growth is due to the emergence of India's 300-million-strong middle class.
This group is breaking away from traditional superstitions and religions and
embracing Christianity, the official said. 
<BR>...The greatest opportunities still lie ahead, the official said. With the sixthlargest economy in the world, India is ripe for economic expansion and development. Many schools and hospitals are operated by Christians, and the faith is
considered a positive, compassionate social force. Citing limited effectiveness of
traditional evangelism in southern Asia, the official said India needs Christian
doctors, teachers, and business people more than missionaries or evangelists.

"Please stop endangering Chinese Christians" by smuggling Bibles illegally into the country, Bao Jiayuan pleaded in a report published by Ecumenical News International. "Let us work together to help them instead," he appealed. Bao is the newly elected associate general secretary of the China Christian Council (CCC), the official Protestant church body in China (NIRR
12/26/94). Bibles smuggled to rural areas are subject to confiscation and their
recipients to arrest, he warned. He agreed that the 2.2 million Bibles published
annually by Amity Press in Nanjing are inadequate to meet demands. He said
production is expected to reach 4 million a year eventually. 
<BR>...Mark Szanderna of the Hong Kong-based Revival Christian Church,
which claims to have delivered 300,000 Bibles to China, dismissed Bao's plea.
He said the CCC is "just a government church" he doesn't trust. Chinese Christians "are willing to pay the price" for smuggled Bibles, he said.

The war-engulfed region of Chechnya, which straddles the 10/40 Window of
unreached peoples, is almost entirely populated by Muslims, and no known
Christian churches or missionaries are located there, AD 2000 and Beyond's
David Hargrove told NIRR. At this time, there is no Chechen translation of the
Scriptures, according to Wycliffe Bible Translators.  
<BR>...The war for independence will create an opportunity for Christian relief
and missions groups to assist survivors and spread the gospel, George Law, vice
president of Wheaton, Ill.-based Russian Ministries, told NIRR. Speaking from
Moscow, Law cited a similar occurrence in the Russian Republic of Georgia,
where Christian missionaries helped restore the shattered lives and homes of
people there, resulting in a greater openness to the gospel. Despite horrible
destruction, the war could have positive results as "people become more aware
that the Chechens exist" and their Muslim worldview is challenged, Law said.
<BR>...More than 250 Jewish residents of Chechnya fled during the fighting.
Many left for neighboring countries and were airlifted to Israel, the official
Jewish immigration agency announced. It had lost contact with 12 Jewish
families still in Grozny during this month's assault by Russian troops, it said.

There is a growing evangelical Christian community among the Saraguro
Indians who live on the eastern slopes of the Andes mountains in southern
Ecuador. OMS International missionary Dean Davis told NIRR that there are
about 500 evangelicals among the Saraguros' 30,000 population and that he
recently oversaw the founding of five small evangelical congregations. The seed
was planted among the Saraguros, descendants of the Incas, during a deadly
cholera outbreak in 1992. Saraguro Christians and believers from other tribes
cared for the sick and dying, taught preventive measures, and "shared the
message of eternal life in Christ," Davis said, which broke down barriers of
suspicion and laid the foundations for trust and friendship. 
<BR>...The Saraguro Christians are making social advances as well. A radio
station, the only one in the region, is being built. It will employ Christians and
feature some Christian programming. Also, the Ecuadorian government has
recognized the Association of Indigenous Saraguro Christians, which is important
in giving rootless evangelicals an identity within their community, Davis said.

Fire broke out Jan. 5 aboard a Youth With A Mission hospital ship while

Pope John Paul II agreed to a proposal by President Clinton to use clergy

Prospects for a thaw in relations between China and the Vatican iced over
during the pope's visit to Manila. A 24-member delegation of clergy and lay
leaders from the government-sanctioned Chinese Catholic Church (Chinese
Patriotic Association) attended the Vatican's World Youth Day celebration, over
which the pontiff presided. It was the first official visit to a papal event since a
bitter split between the Vatican and China following the communist takeover in
1949. At that time, Catholics were forced to renounce the pope, many priests
were imprisoned, and Beijing created a Catholic group independent of Rome,
with bishops appointed by the government. The Vatican then infuriated Beijing
by establishing diplomatic ties with the Taiwanese government. Over the years,
the Vatican meanwhile secretly consecrated loyal Chinese priests and bishops,
who serve a growing underground network of churches loyal to the pope.
<BR>...Within the past two years, unofficial talks between Vatican and Beijing
officials signaled a thaw. Bishops from Beijing and Shanghai who came to
Manila were quoted in the press as confirming that relations with the Vatican
were improving. They insisted that they shared the same faith as all Catholics
and that their differences were political. But most of the Chinese delegation
walked out of the Youth Day mass, attended by a crowd estimated at several
million, when they spotted the flag of Taiwan among other flags in a procession
to the grandstand.
<BR>...The delegation released a statement, saying that Sino-Vatican relations
cannot be normalized until the Vatican severs its ties to Taiwan. Also, it must
refrain from interference in China's internal religious affairs.

The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review an Ohio case to clarify the right
of private citizens to display religious messages on public property. A federal
appeals court in that case allowed the Ku Klux Klan to erect a cross in a Columbus, Ohio, park next to the Statehouse as part of a Christmas display. Regulators
had allowed a menorah and a Christmas tree to be displayed for several years,
but refused to give the Klan a permit for the cross in 1993 (NIRR 12/13/93). The
appeals court ruled that in a public forum "the religious content of private speech
is absolutely irrelevant" and cannot violate the Constitution's Establishment
Clause. Ohio's appeal to the Supreme Court said giving the public-forum
doctrine absolute precedence would make it hard for state and local governments

Threatened with a $10,000 contempt fine and other court sanctions, First
Baptist Church of Markham Woods in Lake Mary, Fla., agreed to release names

have a chilling effect on contributions to churches and other non-profit groups.
<BR>...The decision came in a lawsuit filed by Ann Haynes in 1993 after she
was removed from First Baptist's membership. Grounds cited were poor attendance, unchristian conduct, and refusal to work out conflicts within the church.
Haynes charged the church and Parker with misuse of funds, including failure to
account for how a $416,000 bequest was spent. Her suit cited a state statute that
requires a non-profit organization to disclose records to its members. (Federal
disclosure regulations exempt donors' names and contribution amounts.) In June
1994, all church records except names of contributors were turned over to
Haynes' lawyers. But on Jan. 10, a Seminole County judge ordered the church to
turn over records showing amounts and names of contributors. Parker is a

Tens of thousands of young people around the world have a vision for

seminars include a six-to-12-month preparation process in which Christian
leaders are identified and consulted to determine areas of need in a country.
Classes are tailored to fit the needs of a country. In countries where business
evangelism is needed, a business track is included. Other countries may need
courses in music and arts for youth ministry, and in Muslim countries a course in

Federal prosecutors "can now move confidently against commercial child
porn distributors," said John McMickle of the National Law Center. He commented after the Supreme Court refused this month to review the conviction of
Stephen Knox, the Pennsylvania man sentenced for possessing videos that
focused on the genitals of scantily clad young girls. The NLC, the legal wing of
the National Coalition for Protection of Children and Families, cited the leadership of Attorney General Janet Reno in appealing to the high court for a strong
interpretation of a federal law regarding child pornography. The scope of the law
has been expanded to protect minors from child pornographers who focus on
their private parts -- even if not completely nude.

Religious leaders seemed as divided as ever after abortion clinic killings
in Massachusetts on Dec. 30. Members of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice appealed to the nation's Catholic bishops to support a moratorium on
demonstrations outside abortion clinics. They also called for a dialogue on the
issues. Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston earlier had called for such a moratorium
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/010995.html">NIRR 1/9</A>). However, Catholic officials in Washington, D.C., said they did not
expect the bishops' conference to take up the issue. Cardinal John O'Connor in
a sermon at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York said he would call for a
moratorium on demonstrations only if a moratorium is called on abortions. He
denounced using violence against abortionists. Several pro-life leaders warned
against allowing pro-choice groups to dictate tactics or muzzle the free speech of
abortion foes. Abortion-rights groups know they can restrict "our life-saving
work if they can get us to stop using words that convey truth," Rescue America's
Don Treshman told Law. "Abortion is murder, and those who perform abortions
are murderers," he said.

A veteran abortion-rights activist was arrested and charged with threatening to blow up a Catholic church in Suffern, N.Y. Police said Alice Hand, 54, a
patient escort at a nearby abortion clinic, made at least three such calls to the
church. A priest traced the call. Hand told authorities she was distraught over
recent violence directed at clinics by abortion opponents. She blamed her action
partly on the Catholic Church's position on abortion, news accounts said.

Churches starting crisis pregnancy centers can get help from the Southern
Baptist Home Mission Board's Alternatives To Abortion ministry. Instructors
Sylvia Boothe and Barbara Noakes travel around the country offering 18 hours
of training for volunteers. In communities without a crisis pregnancy center, the
instructors lead a 12-hour conference to teach people how to minister to everyone involved in the pregnancy and how to pool community resources. They have
helped train volunteers for 36 crisis pregnancy centers. For information, call the
HMB Alternatives To Abortion office at (404) 898-7402.

People who are so mentally defective that they cannot live in society
should "be humanely dispatched," according to an article in the newsletter of the
Los Angeles chapter of MENSA. The group's members have IQs in the top 2%
of society. Editor Nikki Frey was unapologetic about her decision to publish the
article, which appeared to propose extermination of the homeless, mentally
retarded, old, and infirm, the Los Angeles Times reported. A writer said in
another story that "it is not clear to me why anyone would expend time and
effort and money on the homeless. What good are they?" The articles caused
outrage among the local chapter's 2,000 members, and Frey was fired.

Two-thirds of adults are dissatisfied with the ethical standards of

Bigmouth, an automated voice-mail system, operates a prayer chain for First
Baptist Church in Gozaburg, Neb. The system, designed for telemarketing
appeals, "is a great ministry tool," said pastor Tim Burke, because it assures that
prayer requests and updates faithfully are passed along the chain. Church
members make requests, which are passed along the 60-person prayer chain.
<BR>...Formerly, the chain broke down when no one was home or the request
was accidentally altered, Burke said. But with Bigmouth everyone receives the
same message and it is programmed to call back if no one answers.

Cardinal John O'Connor can keep his job as archbishop of New York,
Roman Catholic officials said. O'Connor offered his resignation this month when
he turned 75, which is the Church's mandatory retirement age. Pope John Paul II
won't immediately accept the resignation because O'Connor is in good health,
Church officials said. The Philadelphia-born O'Connor, a former Navy chief of
chaplains, is considered by many to be the pope's leading advocate in America.
He is known for his plain-spoken defense of the Church's teachings.                                <P><A HREF="#MENU">Back to menu</A>

<P>
In the midst of trauma in Oklahoma City, God is at work. The catastrophic
April 19 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building opened a soulsearching dialogue among Americans about their spiritual condition.
<BR>...A number of the dead and presumed dead are Christians, active workers
in their churches. The dead include pastor Gilbert Martinez, 35, of Tabernacle of
Faith. He often took Spanish-speaking members of his congregation to the
building to help them fill out forms. A church member said Martinez had taken
Emilio Tapia, another blast victim, to the building to get a Social Security card.
The pastor is survived by his wife and five children, one who is two weeks old. 
<BR>...Survivors told stories of the testing of their faith. Jamie Norfleet dropped
the phone when a fellow member of her prayer circle at First Baptist Church,
Stillwater, asked her to pray for the victims of the explosion. "I knew my
husband was in there," she told Associated Baptist Press. Marine Corps recruiter
Randy Norfleet survived despite a 40% blood loss and 250 stitches to close his
wounds. He never lost consciousness in the ambulance because "I was concentrating on praying. It was a prayer of thanksgiving" for survival, he said. Doctors
said Norfleet would likely lose the sight in his right eye. "Losing an eye is a
small thing," Norfleet said. "Whatever brings you closer to God is a blessing.
Through all this I've been brought closer to God. I've become more dependent
on Him and less on myself."
<BR>...Some 5,000 people mourned for Mickey Maroney, 50, at Council Road
Baptist Church in suburban Bethany. As his widow and three children grieved
privately at home, members of his extended church family got on their knees in
the sanctuary and shared their grief with God over the man who had been a
beloved mentor to college-age men at the church. Maroney, a Secret Service
agent, had planned to attend a training session in nearby Norman that morning.
At the last minute, a friend Maroney had been ministering to in hopes he would
accept Christ went in his place. When the friend learned that Maroney had been
killed, he said he knew why Maroney died instead of him. "Mickey was ready to
meet God, and I'm not," the man told The Washington Post. Maroney's brother
Jimmy said that when he saw a photo of Timothy McVeigh, who has been
charged in the bombing, he did not react angrily. "The Lord is removing anger,"
Maroney said.
<BR>...A wrenching scene was playing out at First Christian Church as families
huddled awaiting word of loved ones still trapped in the wreckage of the building. Hopes faded with each passing hour. The death toll could climb past 200
once the search of the building's remnants is complete. More than 70 ministers
from many denominations were there to offer support for the families. 
<BR>...Anger often was met with love, even among Christians grappling with both.
Callers swamped Oklahoma City radio talk shows. Those callers who insisted
that the perpetrators be shot on sight were followed by others who pleaded for
prayers for the bombers' salvation. The desire to forgive rather than seek
revenge, which was expressed by many people in the Bible-Belt city, impressed
reporters. An atheist told a local pastor he had never experienced such love. 
<BR>...Several churches downtown, including First United Methodist Church and
St. Joseph's Cathedral, were heavily damaged. Rescue workers were using the
lobby of First Methodist as a temporary morgue. Pastor Nick Harris of 1,700member First UMC was in his office when the blast occurred and narrowly
escaped injury. The church sponsors a downtown Loaves and Fishes noon Bible
study and prayer ministry, and a number of members were affected by the blast.
His congregation met at a university campus auditorium April 23. The blast
shattered stained-glass windows at First Baptist Church.
<BR>...Suddenly, Christianity became a prominent theme in news stories.
Television viewers watched as people turned to the church for comfort and
struggled to answer the question: How could God have let this happen? There is
a mystery to suffering, and some questions defy easy answers, Billy Graham said
at a memorial service at the State Fair Arena. "I have to accept by faith that God
is a God of love and mercy and compassion, even in the midst of suffering. The
Bible says God is not the author of evil."
<BR>...The caring acts of local believers also took the spotlight. "People are
testifying to what they believe through helping out the people hurt in the bombing," Jim Tucker, pastor of Hillcrest Christian Church, told reporters. Hundreds
of ministers worked around the clock to comfort rescue workers. Others stationed
themselves near victims' families waiting for news, or made death-notification
visits to the families. Christian relief agencies, including The Salvation Army,
responded quickly. Baptist Medical Center gave free counseling.
<BR>...When Americans talked about their lost security, Christians explained
their broader perspective. "Here we are in a good Midwestern town, with good
neighbors, but you can be driving down at Fifth and Harvey and have it all end
in an instant," Gene Garrison, pastor of First Baptist Church, told Baptist Press.
"This just proves that we don't have any security in this world" outside of Christ.
<BR>...Prejudice against Muslims surfaced. Many, including some in the media,
jumped to the apparently erroneous conclusion that Islamic fundamentalists were
to blame. Muslim leaders repeatedly stressed that Americans need to understand
that Islam has a pluralistic tradition.
<BR>...Another potentially ominous trend emerged. Some reporters tenuously
linked last year's conservative election victory, partially driven by religious
conservatives, to the bombing. "The radical right" has an extremist component
that "plainly was a force in the 1994 elections," wrote Philip Weiss in Time
magazine. The "coalition," Weiss wrote, includes tax protesters, Christian home
schoolers, those who fear one-world government, gun-rights activists, and "selfreliant types" who resent the federal government. It is several steps from this
movement "to the extremist-fringe thinking that seems to have bred the Oklahoma City bombing," he said.

More than 4,000 Christian leaders from almost 200 countries will converge
on Seoul, South Korea, May 17-25 for the largest evangelism conference ever.
The Global Consultation on World Evangelism is part of AD 2000 and Beyond's
(NIRR 8/22/94) attempt to establish "a church for every people and the gospel
for every person" by the year 2000. GCOWE '95 will "mobilize and motivate
churches" in world evangelism, AD 2000 International Director Luis Bush told
NIRR. The eight-day event will include several plenary sessions. Participants will
break areas down by continents, countries, and people tracks so the leaders can
develop methods and strategies for evangelizing. 
<BR>...AD 2000's goals are attainable because emerging missions agencies in Latin
America, Asia, and Africa can help the "tired churches of the West," Bush cited
evangelical scholar John Stott as saying. Some 66% of GCOWE participants are
non-Western and will bear 75% of the conference's costs.

The "heartbeat of evangelism is very much alive" in Canada. So said the
executive director of Vision 2000 Canada, Don Moore, after a national evangelization consultation called Toward 2000: Vision and Challenge. More than 200
delegates attended the national conference, producing a declaration that voiced
hopes, confessions, and plans for evangelism in Canada. The Burlington Declaration includes a confession of unchristlike attitudes, a reaffirmation of the need
for evangelism, a call for renewal, and a commitment to make outreach and
discipleship central to the church's activities. The draft was written by the
leaders of six evangelical denominations and was amended by participants from
other denominations in round-table discussions. "There's nothing like this in the
history of Canada," Moore said of the declaration.     
<BR>...The national consultation capped eight conferences held in key provinces of the country. The series was designed to determine the organization's
progress toward making the gospel available to every Canadian by 2000.

Sudan's Islamic government is allowing Christian programming to air on
its national television station, International Media Ministries reports. IMM, a
missionary arm of the Assemblies of God Division of Foreign Missions, is
working with other Christian broadcast ministries to produce a television series.
The soap-opera format will deal with issues that "people in North Africa face in
their daily lives" and offer a Christian perspective, IMM director David Lee told
NIRR. He said the programs will present the gospel, but are not intended as an
rebuttal to Islam. Although IMM will provide training and technical assistance,
the Sudan project was launched by HS Radio in Finland. It also received production assistance from International Russian Radio/TV (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6</A>).

In Ambur, India, about 700 people attended a well-publicized memorial
service for the wife of a highly regarded Indian Lutheran minister. Afterward,
some 50 came forward to get more information about the church, Johannes
Gedrat of the Lutheran Church (Missouri Synod) told NIRR. Gedrat, the LCMS'
area secretary for southern Asia, finished a 16-day tour of LCMS churches in 22
cities, villages, and towns in India and Sri Lanka. Gedrat saw 25 people baptized
together in one town, and 36 converted during another service. 
<BR>...The indigenous church in the two countries is missions-minded and is
reaching out effectively through social works "with the final objective of preaching the Word," he said. One example is a home for young girls who, lacking
schools in their districts, have to travel as much as 12 hours to attend school.
Some 350 girls are housed, fed, and cared for at the home by indigenous church
members. Other services include schools where young men and women can learn
skills such as tailoring, typing, and computing.

Billed as Nepal's first evangelistic crusade, Luis Palau's Good News Easter
Festival drew some 26,000 people over four days, the Luis Palau Evangelistic
Association said. At each meeting, hundreds of people responded to the gospel
message and decision cards indicated some 1,400 prayed to receive Christ,
LPEA's Mike Umlandt said. About 65 Christian churches are in Kathmandu, he
estimated, and most participated in the April 12-14 crusade. Although Christians
were granted freedom to worship in 1990, Nepal is a Hindu state where proselytism is forbidden. Those who convert to Christianity face persecution from their
families and community. The Easter festival was historic, said Robert Karthak,
pastor of Gyaneshwar Church in Kathmandu.

Muslim extremists attacked a predominantly Catholic town in the Philippines, possibly to start a religious war between Christians and Muslims, News
Network International reported. Fifty-three people were killed and 35 taken
hostage by the 200-strong guerrilla force that ransacked the southern town of
Ipil. According to one survivor, about a third of the hostages were killed on
April 15 when their captors beheaded them and mutilated their bodies. More than
20 Christian-owned businesses were destroyed and about 2,700 residents of the
town are without homes. Most of the dead are Catholics. The attackers apparently belong to two Muslim extremist groups, Abu Sayyaf (NIRR 8/22/94) and The
Islamic Command Council, which wish to make the southern island of Mindanao
an "Islamic homeland for Filipino Muslims," the news agency reported.

Operation Sea Legs is a Youth With A Mission initiative to create a mobile
unit for constructing and fitting artificial limbs for amputees in the developing
world. The facility, now under construction, can be loaded on a flatbed truck and
taken inland in countries where the YWAM ship Anastasis docks, project
director Paul Moehring told NIRR.
<BR>...The mobile factory will employ computer-aided designing and machining
to create the prosthetics. They will be constructed from thermoplastic -- a sturdy,
flexible material that allows users to participate in heavy work and sports. Of the
world's 3 to 4 million amputees, some 95% reside in the developing world,
where injuries mainly are due to farm accidents, violence, and a lack of medical
knowledge and facilities, Moehring said. For such people, an artificial limb can
mean the difference between begging and performing fruitful labor. Although
funds have been raised to build the inside of the facility and to buy the computer
equipment, the project still needs funds for the limbs. For more information, call (800) 424-SHIP.

Enthusiastic students experiencing revival on campuses across the
country say they are tired of being pegged as Generation X. "They want to be
known as the generation that turns this country around," said Woody Northcutt,
Colorado Christian University chaplain. A flood of repentance during services at
the Lakewood school this month mirrored similar phenomena on campuses
across the country (NIRR 4/17; NIRR 4/3; NIRR 3/20). One result of revival at
CCU is that more male students say they want to be morally pure and learn to be
leaders, Northcutt said. "Now we've got some men to train for leadership."
<BR>...Repentance by students and faculty broke down bitterness and divisions
at CCU that Northcutt characterized as "a spirit of oppression." CCU students are
so ardent about personal and corporate renewal on campus that 25 students who
had planned to drop out of the school decided to stay. "What happened in the
last two weeks has changed their lives, and they want to come back and see
more of what God is doing," Northcutt said.
<BR>...A similar reconciliation occurred at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., which is enduring one of the most turbulent and bitter
times in its history. When the school announced that Brownwood, Texas, pastor
John Avant planned to speak during a chapel service, some on campus saw his
appearance as an administration ploy to divert attention from the school's
problems. A rumored student boycott of the service did not occur, but instead,
some 1,000 students attended the April 13 service. As the low-key, 45-minute
service ended, Avant dismissed the students, telling them they were free to return
to classes. Nevertheless, hundreds of students -- and some faculty and administrators -- came forward to repent of sins, including bitterness. Initially, because
microphones were not set up, students "started standing up where they were and
shouting their confessions," Avant told NIRR. A faculty member said there may
be "more pain before ultimate healing," but "the student atmosphere is so
different now."
<BR>...Teachers, students, and parents nationwide had prayed fervently for
campus revival. Barbara Blanchard, a 1954 Wheaton College graduate whose
daughter attends the school, is one example. Blanchard, a pastor's wife from
Sioux City, Iowa, said she had such a burning desire to see revival come to
Wheaton that she decided to "be radical." In November, Blanchard spent two
weeks at Wheaton praying and meeting with revival-minded students and faculty.
"It was something my husband understood I needed to do," she said.
<BR>...Then, Blanchard traveled to New York to seek prayers from Brooklyn
Tabernacle, which itself is experiencing revival. "I didn't know a soul. I didn't
know how to get there or anything," she said. Members of the multi-ethnic
church agreed to pray each night for 30 days for Wheaton, a largely white,
upper-middle-class school. "We are so needy as white people," Blanchard said.
"Sometimes others can teach us how to love." Revival later broke out at
Blanchard's Sioux City church when three Wheaton students spoke there. It was
"glorious" to see whole families, including small children, exhibit "great brokenness, love, and compassion," she said.
<BR>...Christian students at Iowa State University, in Ames, experienced revival
April 10. Some 300 members of several Christian organizations on campus
waited for several hours to come to the microphone and confess sin, repent, and
pray. The meeting, which started at 8:30 p.m. with testimonies from four
Wheaton students about similar events on their campus, lasted until 5 a.m.,
Campus Crusade for Christ director Mike Sutton said. "I sat there stunned. The
effects of sin on Christians' lives was so prevalent," he said. Leaders also
repented. "Our students don't often see our staff broken and honest," Sutton said,
noting that leaders must set the example by being vulnerable to others.
<BR>...More schools where revival broke out recently include Indiana Wesleyan,
Marion, Ind.; Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, S. Hamilton, Mass.; Judson
College, Elgin, Ill.,; George Fox College, Newberg, Ore.; and Multnomah Bible
College, Portland, Ore. Students who experienced revival spoke at churches and
high schools. Numerous similar phenomena also occurred.

A former thief now teaches people how to prevent crime. Richard O'Neal
Jones, 48, said he always wanted to be a career hustler. He spent two years in
prison for running a welfare-fraud ring that made several hundred thousand
dollars. In prison, at age 41, Jones became a Christian. When he read the Bible,
he realized God could use his past for good.
<BR>...Jones interviewed dozens of fellow inmates about their "specialties" -such as robbery, car theft, and rape -- and documented their suggestions about
how individuals could make themselves safe in the book Tips Against Crime,

Ex-criminals are giving frightened and frail elderly people a better life in
innercity Cleveland. For 15 years, the church-based program Community Re-Entry has screened, hired, and trained ex-offenders. They are sent out in Care
Teams to impoverished communities, where they escort the elderly to the bank,
store, or doctor. Senior citizens say it's a godsend to have the freedom to leave
their apartments without fear, program administrator Charles See told NIRR. He
employs about 80 workers and pays them up to $25,000 a year. Workers also
intervene to limit gang fights and other problems at public high schools. Organizers say that when the program started, they were concerned that ex-offenders
would be a bad influence, but that has not happened.
<BR>...Various denominations sponsor Community Re-Entry, which is administered by Cleveland's Lutheran Metropolitan Ministry Association. The city and
area foundations provide funding. Cleveland organizers have helped start similar
programs in St. Louis, Mo., and Lorain, Ohio.

A Minnesota group is linking successful churches with those that desire to
grow. Minneapolis-based Teaching Church Network grew out of an idea by Leith
Anderson, an author, speaker, and pastor of Wooddale Church in Eden Prairie.
Anderson's Baptist General Conference congregation has helped many other
churches become more effective in their outreach, according to Paul Borden,
TCN executive director. Anderson's idea was to form a national network of
successful congregations from various denominations and ethnic backgrounds to
disciple churches that may "need an extra nudge," Borden said.
<BR>..."Sometimes I feel like a singles dating service," said Borden, whose job
is to match teaching churches with those to be mentored. The 12-church network
includes Episcopal, Baptist, Mennonite, Christian Church, and independent
congregations. Mentoring includes assessment of the church's strengths and
weaknesses, a forum on areas of growth and outreach, and an accountability
period with a two-year plan to change. For information, call (612) 942-9866.

More than half the baptisms performed in Southern Baptist Convention
churches are on people who have been baptized before, an SBC Home Mission
Board survey found. Only 40% of recently baptized adults in the study reported
a first-time commitment to Christ as the reason for being baptized. Another 40%
said it was part of rededicating their lives to Christ. Some 14% said they were
baptized as a requirement of moving their membership from a non-SBC church.
Among those baptized before, the median age for their first baptism was 10, and
33% were baptized at an SBC church.
<BR>...In reporting the study, mission board officials questioned whether the
pressure to achieve numbers was driving pastors to encourage rebaptism. They
suggested that pastors must spend more time on follow-up teaching and nurturing. In preparing for the survey, they found that churches already had lost
contact with about a third of the people they baptized in 1993.

In what may be a first, the Internal Revenue Service revoked a church's
tax exemption for engaging in partisan politics. It announced April 10 that
contributions to the Church at Pierce Creek in Binghamton, N.Y. (NIRR
12/14/92), no longer will be deductible. In a revocation notice earlier, it cited the
church for publishing a pre-election advertisement against Bill Clinton in USA
Today and The Washington Times. The "open letter" ad claimed Clinton supported abortion, distribution of condoms in public schools, and homosexuality. It
questioned how anyone could vote for "a man of this character." Pastor Daniel
Little said the church had the right to inform the Christian community of where
Clinton stood on moral issues. The nondenominational church has a nationally
known member: Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry. The IRS action grew
out of a complaint by Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
<BR>...In response, the American Center for Law and Justice filed suit against
the IRS on the church's behalf April 17 in federal court in Washington, D.C. It

Dangerous, totalitarian, and divisive religious groups will be banned from
Russia under an amendment passed unanimously last month by the parliament.
The measure represents a compromise proposal framed by evangelical legal
experts, sources said. It was introduced in the legislature by the Christian
democratic faction to head off sterner proposals by Russian Orthodox Church
leaders and nationalists, they added. Orthodox pressure already has resulted in a
new policy that requires foreign missionaries to leave the country and re-apply
for visas when their current ones expire, Baptist Press reported. Previously, visas
were renewable upon request within the country. 
<BR>...A Russian court banned the Japanese Aum Shinri Kyo sect from
Russian soil and airwaves, and ordered its Russian branch closed. The group is
suspected of masterminding the sarin nerve-gas attack in a Tokyo subway in
March that killed 10 and left thousands ill. Sect leaders said they would appeal
to a higher court. Meanwhile, Russian Orthodox officials urged a media blackout
on coverage of the sect, the Unification Church, and Scientology.

Medical researchers are taking a closer look at religious experience as a
possible cure for drug and alcohol addiction. Some 70 clinicians from around the
country explored the issue at Spiritual Dimensions in Clinical Research, a threeday conference in Virginia. Studies summarized at the meeting characterized an
addict's life as lacking meaning and purpose, craving pleasure, or reaching a
state of "joylessness." UCLA psychiatrist Frank Gawin cited studies showing the
success of religious groups in breaking addictions. Alcoholics Anonymous
members who make strong commitments to the spiritual basis of the AA program gain sufficient "meaning in life" to displace the need for alcohol, according
to data cited by William Miller, a research director at the University of New
Mexico. To ignore religion "is to violate scientific curiosity," he said.
<BR>..."Drug abuse is not a problem with drugs. It's a problem with pleasure,"
Duke University's Roy Matthews said. Since pleasure is the basis of addiction, it
could be the solution to it, he theorized. He pointed to differences between
selfish and selfless pleasure. The latter can produce a mood state, possibly
altering the brain's chemicals, he said. Selfless pleasure is found in religion, and
"the most pleasurable part of religion is the experience of God."

A federal judge ordered a northern Mississippi school district to stop
prayers and Bible reading over a school intercom. Members of a Bible club at
the 1,300-pupil North Ponotoc Attendance Center prayed and read each morning.
Although the exercises were student-initiated and student-led, use of the school's
public address system to reach into all classrooms implied an unconstitutional
seal of approval by the school, U.S. District Judge Neal Biggers ruled. The
practice resulted in segregation along religious lines, he said. He issued a
temporary injunction on the recitations, but said they could be held before classes
in the school gym. Trial was set for next March. The ruling came in response to
a complaint by Lisa Herdahl last December. She claimed five of her children
were ridiculed at school for not taking part in the prayers (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/010995.html">NIRR 1/9</A>).

The church in Cambodia -- ripped apart by decades of regional strife, genocide, and civil war
-- has begun the process of reconciliation. Fifty religious leaders from 10 provinces gathered
in Phnom Penh to participate in "holistic prayer" for the nation, John Robb of World Vision
International told NIRR. The method involves praying for economic, political, and spiritual
needs, and for the church. During the two-day conference, the participants -- who were
supported by a team of 11 intercessors from seven nations -- prayed for unreached people in
Cambodia, unity among churches, and healing for war victims. 
<BR>...Many leaders confessed sins dating back to the "killing fields," one of the most savage eras
of the century. In the mid-1970s, the Marxist Khmer Rouge slaughtered former military
personnel, civil servants, educated or wealthy people, and their families, then turned the
nation into a vast labor camp. Cambodians also suffered greatly during the Vietnam War and
a civil war that raged between four contending armies until 1991. At the prayer summit,
"there was a lot of weeping and ready acceptance and forgiveness," Robb said. He said that in
the weeks after the conference, he has seen an encouraging amount of reconciliation among
Christian workers. Leaders are "thrilled with joy and anticipation about what God is doing,"
and are considering forming a national evangelical fellowship, he said. 
<BR>...Prayer-walks through Phnom Penh and several other regions of Cambodia followed the
prayer summit. Pastors, supported by the prayer team, laid a map of Cambodia on the ground
and poured water on it as a symbol of cleansing. As they prayed over the map, curious
children came and knelt nearby. "I felt as if the Lord was saying, `I want this generation to
experience My peace and reconciliation, and be free from the curse of idolatry and war,'"
Robb said. NIRR 6/26/95

Vietnamese government leaders, foreign diplomats, doctors, and teachers heard Christian
opera performed at the Hanoi Opera House May 26. About 500 people attended the event
hosted by Children's Cup International, a relief and development agency. Although the
concert was "clearly, openly Christian," there was "zero negative response," Children's Cup
President Dave Ohlerking told NIRR. One official requested more concerts, he said. All
proceeds and donations benefited the pediatrics ward of Hanoi's Viet Duc Hospital. 
<BR>...Donations, many of which came from American Vietnam War veterans and their families,
covered the costs of the concert. Many veterans help Vietnamese children because it fosters
healing of scars from the war, Ohlerking said. One veteran donated money to help children in
the same region where North Vietnamese soldiers tortured him. "He found that the best way
to end the war in his own heart was to help the children there go on living," Ohlerking said.
Founded in 1992, the Eagle Grove, Iowa-based ministry has shipped about $500,000 worth of
medical supplies and relief equipment to developing countries. Vietnam is important to
Ohlerking, a former Assemblies of God missionary, because he was in Saigon in April 1975
when it fell to the Communists. "I made a commitment to come back," he said. NIRR 6/26/95

Despite his earlier illness, Billy Graham preached well during the final two nights of Mission
Ontario and "did not seem at all diminished," Jack Charleson, chairman of the executive
committee for the crusade (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12</A>), told NIRR. The crusade "in many ways exceeded our
expectations," he said. More than 260,000 people attended the five-day crusade, setting a
Toronto Skydome record of 68,500 the final night, Charleson said. Some 60% of the 16,000
people who responded to the altar calls were under age 25. Ralph Bell, an Ontario native and
associate evangelist with the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, preached the first three
nights.  
<BR>...Doctors still are unsure what caused Graham to bleed internally during the recent crusade.
The serious bleeding weakened Graham, 76, who required multiple blood transfusions. The
Associated Press quoted Graham's son Franklin as saying his father was "the sickest he's
been in recent years" and that he lost "about a third of his blood" before being hospitalized.
On Graham's release from Toronto East General Hospital June 14, doctors said there was no
sign of cancer in the colon or stomach, but further tests were needed to rule out other
diseases of the small intestine. Doctors speculated that aspirin consumption may have
contributed to the gastrointestinal bleeding. They recommended Graham be re-examined next
month by his regular doctors and that he cancel most speaking engagements for the next three
months. 
<BR>...Graham's hospitalization enhanced media coverage of Mission Ontario, Charleson said. One
television station that Charleson said is "generally against" publicizing such events conducted
interviews at the crusade. The Toronto Star ran full-color photos of Graham, pushing
coverage of the upcoming provincial elections off the front page, Charleson said. Even at the
hospital, Graham's illness had an impact. Thirty nurses attended the Saturday service at the
evangelist's request, the BGEA said. One nurse's son became a Christian, Charleson said.

The prayers of 40 children added an unusual dimension to the Global Consultation On World
Evangelism, May 17-25 in Seoul, South Korea (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12</A>). The children came from around
the world to pray for revival. 
<BR>...The children were the youngest delegates. Ages 6 to 15, they sometimes prayed for four
hours at a time, Esther Ilnisky of Esther Network International, a ministry to children, told
NIRR. They laid hands on adult leaders and prayed over them, she said. Many of the children
had visions, according to Ryan Collins, 11, a delegate from Houston, Texas. They were
"commissioned to give children (in their countries) the anointing" to pray and preach, he told
NIRR. Subsequently, Collins has spoken at Houston-area churches, where has told children
"they should not let older people look down on them, but do exactly what adults do." Collins
said his blessing from Korea "is getting stronger." 
<BR>..."All children who love the Lord and whose spiritual potential is nurtured would be like
this," Ilnisky said. "Few adults recognize what is in the children." In three years, the Esther
Network International has mobilized 1 million children ages 12 and younger around the world
to pray for their generation. Parents or Sunday school teachers return forms to the West Palm
Beach, Fla., ministry indicating the child's commitment to pray regularly. The group supplies
educational and motivational materials. For information, call (407) 832-6490. NIRR 6/26/95

Most churches aren't prepared to handle the societal changes occurring in their backyards,
Jack Dennison of Discipling A Whole Nation Ministries told NIRR. The Colorado Springs
group, known for developing church-planting strategies in foreign nations, also is focusing on
the United States. Many U.S. congregations, particularly those 20 years old and older, are
"too inbred to change with the changing needs of the community," he said. For example,
churches often use a standard approach that emphasizes content at a time when young people
respond more readily to a relationship approach, he said. 
<BR>...Christians must expand their concept of the church to include house churches, cell churches,
satellite churches, and multi-congregational churches, Dennison said. In some places,
small-group ministries fizzled when they became "ingrown and non-evangelistic" or failed to
provide the "depth of community that many wanted." By contrast, the house-church
movement, in which groups meet in homes and lay people take responsibility for ministries,
"provides the best expectation of community and evangelism," he said. NIRR 6/26/95

An expected 30 million people will focus their prayers in October on 100 key cities in the
region known as the 10/40 Window. Praying Through the Window II, part of the AD 2000
and Beyond Movement, follows a similar event in 1993 (NIRR 11/1/93). Then, the prayers of
21 million Christians resulted in "significant breakthroughs" for evangelism in 60 countries,
coordinator Mark Wilson of The Christian Broadcasting Network told NIRR. Targeted nations
stretch from West Africa to East Asia, between 10 and 40 degrees north of the equator. The
area is overwhelmingly Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist. Only 8% of Christian missionaries
work in the area. 
<BR>...Prayer teams will fan out to spiritually, economically, and politically strategic cities.
Planners hope to send at least 100 intercessors to each city. For information, contact the
Christian Information Network at 11025 State Highway 83, Colorado Springs, CO, 80921, or
(719) 522-1040. NIRR 6/26/95

Christians in the United States, Canada, Latin America, and Europe will pray for revival in
their churches and cities, and for unreached parts of the world, on Oct. 21. March for Jesus,
Concerts of Prayer International, Mission America 2000, and other organizations are
co-sponsoring the simultaneous concerts of prayer. The concerts are part of the month-long
focus on cities in the Muslim world that is being sponsored by the AD 2000 and Beyond
Movement. 
<BR>...In the United States, Christians in up to 500 cities will hold prayer gatherings. Every South
American capital will hold a rally, and some rallies even are planned in Cuba, according to
David Bryant, founder of Concerts of Prayer. 
<BR>...A "spontaneous combustion" of desire to pray and to celebrate and worship God has taken
place, said Kai Adler, March for Jesus director of operations. "Everybody's longing for
revival. There is a sense of anticipation and excitement in the hearts of people." For an
information manual, training video, or brochure, call March for Jesus at (512) 416-0066.

Creditors in the multi-million-dollar collapse of the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061265.html">NIRR 6/12</A>) planned to meet for the first time June 26. They include hundreds of evangelical
ministries and colleges, dozens with more than $1 million each in net cash losses. On the
agenda at the Philadelphia meeting: a vote to retain or replace the interim bankruptcy trustee;
accounting reports; and determination of a method for judging who is owed how much.
Interim trustee John Carroll, III, released an initial list of winners and losers in New Era's
alleged pyramid scheme of matching grants. Investigators said New Era made grants to early
depositors with funds from subsequent depositors. New Era head John "Jack" Bennett, Jr.,
said the grants came from anonymous donors. New Era lawyers say the donors never existed. 
<BR>...Carroll used a method that dramatically restructures the list of creditors and their voting
power. If a nonprofit received grants from New Era totaling more than the current amount on
deposit, it is not owed any money, he theorized. Those remaining were listed with a net cash
loss: deposits minus grants received. Grants promised but not received were excluded as
debts. Carroll also suggested that individual donors who had placed money in the New Era
program should be removed from the creditors list, since their funds were intended to go to
charities anyway. Under his suggested plan, groups in a positive cash position would be asked
to return the difference between what they deposited and what they received. Lawyers for
some former creditors said they will object to Carroll's methodology. Carroll insisted the plan
is fair, simplifies matters, and will preserve assets from excessive litigation costs.  
<BR>...Creditors with a net cash loss on Carroll's initial list include: Christian Camps and
Conferences ($500,000); Conservative Baptist Home Mission Society ($1.13 million); The
Evangelical Alliance Mission ($1 million); Haggai Institute ($1.5 million); Harvey Cedars
Bible Conference ($750,000); International Missions ($1.62 million); International Teams
($2.5 million); Luis Palau Evangelistic Association ($1 million); Mission Aviation Fellowship
($1.47 million); Operation Mobilization ($1.55 million); Ravi Zacharias International
Ministries ($525,000); Rescue Mission Alliance ($1.2 million); The Salvation Army ($1
million); Scripture Union ($1.7 million); Send International ($1.5 million); SIM USA ($1
million); United World Mission ($1.45 million); Walk Thru the Bible Ministries ($1 million);
World Concern ($2 million); World Harvest Mission ($1.1 million); World Radio Missionary
Fellowship ($1.2 million); World Vision ($1 million); Young Life ($2.5 million). 
<BR>...Schools on the list include: Biblical Seminary ($1.18 million); Covenant College ($1.15
million); Eastern Baptist Seminary ($1 million); Eastern College ($750,000); Gordon-Conwell
Seminary ($1 million); Houghton College ($1.5 million); John Brown University ($2 million);
Messiah College ($2 million); Phila. College of Bible ($1.34 million); Spring Arbor College
($1.1 million); United Seminary ($1.75 million); Wheaton College ($1.55 million). 
<BR>...A number of Christian organizations announced they will return New Era money, even
funds already spent, because it is the moral thing to do. However, some groups said they are
in dire straits, with no hope of making paybacks. For example, Market Street Mission in
Morristown, N.J., spent its promised grant for expansion projects before receiving the money.
Now it can't make loan payments on the new facilities. "We don't have enough money to
keep going," director David Scott told The Wall Street Journal. 
<BR>...Still other groups are taking a wait-and-see approach. Hans Finzel, foreign missions chief at
Conservative Baptist headquarters in Wheaton, Ill., acknowledged that his agency had a net
gain of more than $2 million. But it's gone now, and it will be difficult to raise payback
funds, he told NIRR. Finzel said he hopes the payback will be prorated and payable over
several years. Under federal law, all money received in the year prior to the bankruptcy filing
must be returned. Pennsylvania law in the New Era case covers funds received in the
preceding two years. 
<BR>...Christian broadcaster David Mains of Wheaton said his ministry entered into a joint
arrangement with Scripture Union. In anticipation of a New Era grant, his group spent
$225,000 on new projects. To help finance the outlay, he took out a mortgage on his home.
The New Era bankruptcy in mid-May resulted in a crisis at Mains' headquarters, forcing
cutbacks in staff and outreach. But creditors and supporters have been understanding and
gracious, he said. "It's been painful, but I'm trusting in Christ as never before. He has a way
through this maze." NIRR 6/26/95

Dozens of waiters, waitresses, bartenders, hostesses, cooks, and restaurant managers have
come to faith in Christ in Lexington, Ky., because of the evangelistic fervor of Pete Hise.
Four years ago, he started a Bible study among young men working at a local Applebee's
Neighborhood Bar and Grill, where he waited on tables while attending Asbury Theological
Seminary. "They were smoking, chewing, and drinking beer -- it was an interesting Bible
study," Hise told Alliance Life magazine. The group began meeting weekly, and "before long
we had a room full of Christians." 
<BR>...Hise still focuses much of his ministry on restaurant workers, even though he left the
Applebee's job when he took the pastorate at First Alliance Church. He often dines at
Lexington restaurants in order to witness, and has established a reputation as "someone who
has answers and who is willing to listen," said Scott Burson, director of communications at
Asbury. Six study groups Hise started meet at apartments, and his wife, Jacki, leads a
women's study. Some 50-60 people have come to Christ in the last year as a result of their
ministry, Burson said. There is one danger in the ministry, Hise told the magazine. "I've
gained 30 pounds." NIRR 6/26/95

Only 5% of physically disabled people attend church -- and the church is incomplete without
them, said Michael Lynch, executive director of JAF Ministries (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/041795.html">NIRR 4/17</A>). "God intends
disabled people to know Christ and be involved in the body of Christ," Lynch said. Spiritual
gifts -- including those of evangelist and teacher -- are as diverse among disabled people as
they are among the general population, he said. When churches reach out to them, the
congregations almost always receive more blessings than they give, Lynch said. 
<BR>...More than 80% of marriages in which there is a disability in the family end in divorce,
usually because extreme emotional, physical, and financial pressures provoke the husband to
leave, Lynch said. In the resulting single-parent family, members tend to shy away from
church and stay home on Sundays unless some congregation reaches out to them. 
<BR>...A JAF manual on praying for disabled people, Interceding for a Handicapped World,
includes 31 days of devotionals, descriptions of debilitating diseases, and how to pray for
their sufferers. It also includes profiles of 12 disabled "prayer warriors" and notes obstacles
disabled people face in various countries. For information, contact JAF Ministries at (818)

Southern Baptists apologized for separating from their Northern religious kin 150 years ago in
a bitter dispute over slavery. SBC representatives meeting in Atlanta before the start of their
138th annual convention said they "unwaveringly denounce racism, in all its forms, as
deplorable sin...lament and repudiate historical acts of evil such as slavery...apologize and ask
forgiveness of our African-American brothers and sisters...and commit ourselves to eradicate
racism in all its forms from Southern Baptist life and ministry." The resolution also addressed
the failure of many Southern Baptists to support the "legitimate initiatives to secure the civil
rights of African-Americans" in more recent times. 
<BR>...A roaring standing ovation greeted passage of the resolution. Gary Frost, a vice president of
the convention, who is black, said he accepted the apology and called on those assembled to
be sure the "genuineness" of their vote was "expressed in attitudes and actions."

A Boston veterans group should be allowed to decide what messages to include and exclude
in its St. Patrick's Day Parade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled. The court said the South
Boston Allied War Veterans Council, sponsor of the parade since 1947, should not have been
forced to let a homosexual group participate (NIRR 3/8/93). The sponsor canceled the 1994
parade after court orders forced it to open the event to gay and lesbian groups in 1992 and
1993. This year, the sponsor adopted new standards: participation would be by invitation only,
and the Catholic-oriented parade would commemorate the role of traditional families in Irish
history. The 1995 parade was an expressive activity protected by association and free-speech
rights, the court said. 
<BR>...Also, the court rejected a challenge to the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act,
saying the law does not infringe on free-speech rights. The case involved Concerned Women
for America member Joyce Woodall, who was arrested after kneeling to pray at a door to a
Falls Church, Va., abortion clinic. Eight trial judges and two appeals courts upheld FACE, but
a Wisconsin judge declared it unconstitutional. The court also let stand an Arkansas decision
against a Little Rock couple who displayed millions of lights as part of their Christmas
celebration (NIRR 12/26/94). The state supreme court ruled the display was a public nuisance
and ordered Jennings and Mitzi Osborne to forego most of the lights. He is a Baptist, she is a

The city of Clearwater, Fla., and several religious groups settled an 11-year legal battle over a
city ordinance. It required religious and other charitable organizations to maintain fund-raising
records that were subject to subpoena if 10 or more individuals accused an organization of
fraud. The ordinance never was enforced because the Church of Scientology challenged its
constitutionality. The city agreed to pay a total of $715,000 to the Church of Scientology and
other plaintiffs, including the Seventh-day Adventist, Baptist, and other churches. The Church
of Scientology said it spent $1.5 million on legal fees in the case. NIRR 6/26/95

Religious freedom must be allowed in a democracy, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said in
rebuffing an attempt to impose harsh limits on foreign religious groups, Baptist Press

"dangerous religious groups." The original law was designed to meet growing concerns about
dangerous cults.

legislation called for -- measures that could affect the work of evangelicals. More proposals to

Many of the top donors to the Japan-based Aum Shinri Kyo cult are dead or missing,
according to news reports. Police sources said some 20 donors gave the so-called doomsday
group $165 million in real estate and cash. Former members say the cult pressured them to
hand over their money and possessions. The cult was implicated in the gas attack on Tokyo
subways in March that killed 12 people and sickened 5,000. It was involved in a string of
other crimes, including the serious wounding of the National Police Agency chief and a jet
hijacking, officials said. Many cult leaders, including guru Shoko Asahara, have been arrested,
but members still carry on religious activities. The government asked a court to strip the
group of its status as a religious organization. NIRR 6/26/95

The Republican Party will split if opposition to abortion is removed from its platform,
evangelical leader Charles Colson predicted. Abortion is a "non-negotiable issue" for
conservative Christians, he told pastors at the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist
Convention in Atlanta this month. He described a recent meeting with GOP leaders in which
he and SBC policy adviser Richard Land were the lone voices calling for retention of the
anti-abortion plank in the party platform. Colson said he told GOP leaders: "You leave us,
and I'll tell you one thing, Southern Baptists and evangelicals will leave you." He suggested it
will take a "human life amendment" to the Constitution to undo Roe v. Wade. NIRR 6/26/95

Pro-life congressmen adopted a three-pronged approach in fighting abortion. The lawmakers
want to reinstate the ban on abortions in military hospitals overseas; prevent medical boards
from requiring abortion instruction in obstetrics/gynecology training; and ban so-called
partial-birth abortions. 
<BR>...Partial-birth abortion involves delivering the fetus' body. While the head remains in the
uterus, doctors puncture the base of the skull, extract the brain tissue, and crush the skull. The
remainder of the dead baby then is delivered. NIRR 6/26/95

Salt Lake City high school students and their parents defied a federal appeals court order and
sang a religious song at graduation. A lawsuit by sophomore choir member Rachel
Bauchman, who is Jewish, had prompted the Denver-based court to bar West High School's
choir from singing The Lord Bless You and Keep You and Friends, traditionally performed at
the school's commencements. Instead, the choir sang two secular pieces. 
<BR>...But then, graduating senior Will Badger, a Mormon, took the microphone and asked
everyone to sing Friends, which includes the line, "Friends are friends forever if the Lord is
the Lord of them." Badger said, "We sing it not as Christians, Jews, or Muslims. We sing it
as it was meant to be sung, as friends." As the principal tried to hush the crowd, most choir
members, graduating students, and audience members sang the lyrics, which students
distributed in advance, news reports said. A police officer escorted Badger from the podium. 
<BR>...School administrators later said students who sang would be disciplined, and that they were
studying videotapes to identify offenders. But school board member Roger Thompson said
students had not violated the law because school authorities, not students, were under the
injunction. NIRR 6/26/95

armed themselves with a weapon. Findings were compiled by the Core Institute on Alcohol
and Other Drug Studies, located at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. Statistics are
based on a survey of 29,935 students on 73 campuses. In high schools, 22% of students report
carrying a weapon, according to a study by The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A 1993 Gallup Poll found 27% of adults say they carry a weapon. NIRR 6/26/95

Two-thirds of American adults believe religious leaders could have a great influence on
raising moral and ethical standards in America, a Gallup poll found. But only 36% think
religious leaders and churches have been wielding that influence. Half said they are doing a
fair job. A slim majority of respondents rated the honesty and ethical standards of clergy
themselves as either very high (14%) or high (40%). NIRR 6/26/95

The church should abandon the phrase "living in sin" and tolerate couples who live together
outside of marriage, a Church of England study says. It acknowledges the centrality of
marriage in church teaching, and says this belief need not be modified just because more
people, including Christians, are living together. But, it contends, in the "theology of
marriage," living together in a lifelong, exclusive commitment "may be a legitimate form of
marriage." The report can provoke "debate and soul searching," but is not "the church's
authoritative teaching," Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey said. NIRR 6/26/95

Air Force Capt. Scott O'Grady, acclaimed for his survival skills and calm nerves during the
six days he evaded Serbian patrols, credits "my love for God and His love for me" for his
rescue. O'Grady, a Catholic, has a "quiet, solid faith" and faithfully attends Mass, Lt. Col.
John Collins, a Catholic priest who is chaplain to the Air Wing at Italy's Aviano Air Force
Base, told NIRR. Appearing on Larry King Live, the F-16 pilot said he prayed almost the
entire time he was on the ground. If there were a phone card for calling God, the bill would
be "sky-high," he said. When King asked O'Grady if he blamed God for his shootdown, he
emphatically answered no. Collins said O'Grady fits the definition of a typical fighter pilot -"professional, a love of family, and good solid religion." A pilot "might not wear religion on
his sleeve, but he knows who God is and has a good relationship with Him," Collins said.

The Navy may expel a highly regarded Christian pilot because of his view that women should
not serve in combat. The Navy's Separation Board recommended that Lt. Cmdr. Kenneth
Carkhuff be discharged from the service for privately telling his commander that he objects to
placing women in combat roles. "Man is to be the protector of the family; there is no greater
violence in society than in combat," he said during a radio broadcast. Carkhuff, who six
weeks earlier received a glowing performance report from his superiors, was judged to have a
"glaring, irreconcilable conflict with Navy policy." At his hearing, the government asked
Carkhuff about his relationship with the Promise Keepers men's movement. He told the board
his religious views require him to obey his superiors' commands as long as they don't
conflict with God's laws. "My intent was never to disregard my duty or refuse a command."

Hillary Clinton joined Mother Teresa and Catholic Cardinal William Hickey in Washington,
D.C., at the opening of a home for unwanted infants and pregnant women who might
otherwise undergo abortions. After last year's National Prayer Breakfast, the nun asked the
first lady to help acquire such a facility (NIRR 2/21/94). An anonymous donor bought the
home and gave it to Mother Teresa's order, the Missionaries of Charity. As featured speaker
at the breakfast, the Nobel Peace Prize winner condemned abortion as "a war against
children." 
<BR>...Although the two women differ over abortion rights, they said at the home-opening
ceremony that they agree on children's need for loving care. In her speech, Mother Teresa
recalled the words of Jesus: "Whatever you do to the least, you do to me." That is why
abortion "is such a great, great evil," she said. 
<BR>...Some Washington pundits saw political implications in the first lady's support of Mother
Teresa's work. It is a signal that the Clintons are distancing themselves from the
abortion-rights movement, they said. After last year's elections, Mrs. Clinton told Newsweek
that abortion is "wrong," but added she did not want it outlawed. NIRR 6/26/95

Garrison Keillor packed a fund-raiser at St. Mark's Lutheran Church in San Francisco. The
host of the radio show A Prairie Home Companion helped launch a $5 million drive to save
the crumbling, century-old church, which was damaged in a 1989 earthquake. Lutheran
Scandinavians "repent in the same way they sin: discreetly, tastefully, at the proper time, and
bring a Jell-O salad for afterward," Keillor said during the show. The program also included a
fashion show of Lutheran "church ladies" in aprons. St. Mark's, known as an activist church,
hosts banquets for people with AIDS and helps shelter the homeless.

A Mississippi minister found out the hard way that conversations on cordless telephones are
not always private. The minister, who wished to remain anonymous, used his cordless phone

The Fuller Institute for Church Growth, an authority on the church-growth movement, is
reeling from debt. According to Christianity Today, the organization lost more than $1 million
after the failure of two costly initiatives: the Church Satellite Network, which recruited
"magnet" churches to receive satellite telecasts of seminars, and Data Mirror, a computerized
consulting system. The association owes $1.5 million to creditors, CT said. The Pasadena,

Coming Revival, which describes the benefits of an extended fast. 
<BR>...During a meeting of 700 Christian leaders in Orlando, Fla., last December, Bright asked the

Trampolines and techno music were among the attractions that drew thousands of people to

With A Mission's Impact World Tour, a six-year initiative to take the gospel across the
country. Local churches work with YWAM teams to stage meetings in schools and
community centers. Plans are under way for similar evangelistic tours in Australia, India, and
Scandinavia. The program included martial arts and speakers. "There is no gift God has given
He doesn't want us to use," extrampoline champion Max Dempsey said.

An Illinois woman who sought counseling from a Catholic priest, and later from a retired
Lutheran minister, said she was seduced by both, according to news accounts. Barbara
Colarelli sought counseling with James Chang, a Benedictine monk regarding her relationship
with her daughter. Chang seduced her in 1985, she said, convincing her that sex would be
therapeutic. When the relationship ended in 1987, she began counseling with Paul Swanson,
and soon confided in him about Chang. Within months, Swanson had sex with her, she said.
Colarelli settled lawsuits against both men.

Egypt: A Cairo appeals court annulled the marriage of a university literature professor. The
court said Nasr Hamed Abu Seid's writings showed he was an apostate from Islam and

China: House-church Christians will receive 5 million Bibles over the next five years from a
joint effort between East Gates Ministries International and China's official church. EGMI, a
ministry to Chinese Christians since 1979, signed an agreement with the Chinese Christian
Council, an arm of the Three Self Patriotic Movement, for its Amity Press to produce the
Bibles. EGMI will cover costs and distribution, President Nelson Graham told NIRR. 
<BR>...The Bibles will be printed in Nanjing and shipped to distribution points in 22 of China's 30
provinces. Of the 35-50 million Christians in the country, about 15 million have Bibles. For
every Bible EGMI provides, there are four to 10 more requests, Graham said. 
<BR>...Since smuggled Bibles are illegal, it is important that house-church Christians have a "safer
and more efficient means of obtaining Bibles," Graham said. EGMI worked "openly and
transparently" with the government and the church, Graham said. By developing relationships
with those who oversee religious matters, EGMI persuaded them that "the Word of God is a
great asset" in China's changing society, he said.

Under the Worship Law, non-Catholic places of worship would be regulated in the same way
as businesses. Also, Protestants would have to provide detailed reports about pastors, church

churches to the whims of bureaucrats. By law, the Catholic Church is exempt from regulation
by the government. Protestants account for 7% of Argentina's 2.5 million people.

congregations. At the meeting, Tippit emphasized holy living and personal evangelism. Some
1,000 people made decisions for Christ at the crusade, he said. In a similar event in Sao
Paulo, several hundred people became Christians, he said. Brazil is "one of the greatest

Russia: Some Russian Orthodox priests are pressuring building owners to bar Protestants from
meeting on their properties, a Protestant radio producer who visited Moscow said. Those who
rent theaters or public auditoriums for evangelical services are threatened with "anathema," a

Russia: Crusade-like festivals in St. Petersburg and Moscow attracted 40,000 people to hear
the evangelistic message of Messianic Judaism, Hear O Israel Ministries (NIRR 11/28/94)
reported. Some 10,000, half of them Jews, prayed to become Christians, Ivy Hofmann of
HOIM told NIRR. The new believers will be discipled by local Messianic Jewish
congregations begun by similar outreach events in the past two years. The festivals consist of
"joyous praise and worship" followed by a gospel message. Jews in the former Soviet Union

Vatican: Catholic seminaries must do a better job of teaching future priests about marriage,

<B>Fifty students became Christians and 120 rededicated their lives to Christ in the first three
days of school at Jupiter Christian School in Jupiter, Fla</B>. "Never in my life have I seen
anything that compares to what has happened here," Steve Whitaker, principal of the K-12
nondenominational school, told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...A spiritual move began prior to the opening of school</B>. During a retreat among 24 seniors
and four adults at a camp near Lake Okeechobee, "most of us were expecting another series
of predictable lectures with a little recreation sprinkled in," said John Workman, student body
president. But the agenda changed as students vented "burdens, fears, frustrations, and anger"
caused by parental conflicts and divorce. One devotional session stretched to four hours as
students confessed deadness and dryness in their Christian lives. 
<BR><B>..."The hardest athletes began weeping under the influence of the Holy Spirit," Whitaker said</B>.
As students confessed, "relationships were mended, hearts were broken, and lives were
changed for all eternity," he said. At midnight, the group sang as three students were baptized
in the campground's swimming pool. 
<BR><B>...The retreat's influence spilled over to the rest of the student body</B>. The school year began
with three days of spiritual emphasis during which Bill Kallenberg, a speaker from Atlanta,
was to deliver several chapel messages. He invited the seniors to share what God did at the
retreat. One by one, the seniors left the bleachers and "confessed Jesus as their Lord and
Savior" in front of their 650 classmates who packed the gymnasium, Whitaker said. The
leading scorer on the basketball team confessed to his classmates that for years "my god has
been basketball," but that Jesus Christ had become pre-eminent in his life. As the young man
left the podium, he went into the stands where he "buried his head on his dad's shoulder and
wept," Whitaker said. Students also prayed publicly for Whitaker, who asked God to
strengthen and revitalize him in his work. 
<BR><B>...Jupiter students shared stories of their renewal at assemblies in seven local schools and
eight churches with other similar meetings planned</B>. Whitaker said he has received reports
from those schools of students praying to receive Christ after the presentations. This could
have been the start of just another school year "if not for the fact that we serve a
prayer-hearing and prayer-answering God who delights in hanging an `extra' on the
`ordinary,'" he said. NIRR 9/18/95

<B>Women who lead ministries say God is calling Christian women to higher levels of
responsibility in the church</B>. "The pendulum is swinging back" to an era when men and
women more freely shared leadership duties, author Evelyn Christenson told NIRR. "We had
a lot more freedom before women's liberation." Christian men reacted to the movement,
which began in the 1950s, by "getting very nervous, and removing women from leadership
and decision-making roles," she said. "We were getting along fine before." 
<BR><B>...Christian women have been uncertain of their roles in the church, they say</B>. "A woman can
be a vice president in the bank, but is not allowed to be treasurer in the church," said Lucille
Dunbar of Mission Aviation Fellowship. In secular jobs, women have found they have more
skills than they realized, she said. But if the church's male leadership discounts those skills,
"where does that woman go? Where does her energy get channeled?" Dunbar asked. "She
finds other ways of serving -- that may not be through the Christian church." 
<BR><B>...Evangelical women are not out to compete with or threaten men, the leaders said</B>. "Who's
in charge isn't the issue," Dunbar said. "The issue is, God has called us together to redeem a
lost world. We have gifts and talents, and each is necessary -- I don't see that as a threat
thing or a competition thing," she said. If men and women can put pride aside, they both can
use their spiritual gifts much more productively and cooperatively, Christenson said. "If you
don't care who gets the glory, you can get a lot done." 
<BR><B>...Wives who have prayed for their husbands to assume spiritual leadership say they are
delighted, not intimidated, when the men take that responsibility</B>. Promise Keepers has been

preaching. "I've heard it said that the MTV generation doesn't want to listen to somebody
stand up for 35 or 40 minutes and talk about the Bible -- but we have found the opposite to

<B>MAP International is providing a Christian response to the AIDS crisis in Kenya</B>. The

<B>The South Korean church is at the forefront of pledging to send missionaries to the largely

missionaries to 300 of the people groups on the list, and the Korean AD 2000 coordinator
hopes churches in Korea can send missionaries to the rest. The recent Global Consultation on
World Evangelization (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12</A>), held in Seoul, inspired and challenged the Korean church
in the initiative, Hargrove said. 
<BR><B>...Korea's location is ideal for reaching 10/40 Window countries</B>. Travel expenses for a
Korean missionary are about one-quarter of those of a Westerner, and the cultural adjustment
is much easier, Hargrove said. Many Koreans already live in Middle Eastern and Asian
countries, including Iran, Russia, China, and Uzbekistan. In one Middle Eastern country, 5%
of the 30,000-strong Korean community is comprised of witnessing Christians, AD 2000 said.
<BR><B>...Korea has emerged as one of the largest non-Western missionary-sending countries</B>. More

The settlement, reached last month, calls for Wal-Mart to educate its 2,200 managers and

Ads include a picture of a boy in a vest and underwear and another shows a girl with the
crotch of her panties showing, news reports said. Some ads were shot by photographer Steven
Meisel, who worked with Madonna on her explicit book Sex. At issue is whether the models
were juveniles and if the pictures constitute a violation of the law. A youth does not
necessarily have to be naked to constitute a violation of the child pornography law, courts

<B>The Lord's Prayer begins, "Our Father-Mother in heaven" in a new version of the Bible</B>. The
New Testament and Psalms: An Inclusive Version also reduces the number of references to
God as Lord and turns the Son of Man into "the Human One." John 3:16 becomes, "For God
so loved the world that God gave God's only Child, so that everyone who believes in that
Child may not perish, but may have eternal life." The version, produced over five years, says
children should "heed" their parents rather than "obey" them, and wives should "be committed
to" their husbands rather than "submit" to them. Because of racial overtones, darkness is no
longer equated with evil. Oxford University Press, a major producer of Bible translations,

More than 4,000 state and local activists attended the opening session of the Sept. 8-9

on Christ's teachings, and seek reconciliation and justice. In a speech, presidential candidate

organizations, The Chronicle of Philanthropy reported</B>. Nonprofits that do their telemarketing
in-house are exempt, as are telemarketing companies hired by charities, as long as they do not
offer gifts of substantial value in exchange for donations. The rules seek to crack down on
telemarketers who misrepresent themselves as charities and offer prizes or other items of
value in exchange for donations.  
<BR><B>...The new rules require telemarketers: to name the charity and the reason for the call before
"making a pitch" for donations; to clearly state a donation is not required to win prizes; to
give the odds of winning; to not misrepresent the "nonprofit, tax-exempt, or charitable status,
purpose, affiliation, or identity" of the company or organization; to not make misleading
statements about the deductibility of contributions; to limit calls to between 8 a.m</B>. and 9

money from their accounts. The rules will allow fraudulent telemarketers to be prosecuted in

<B>A Michigan state legislator is attempting to reform the state's no-fault divorce law, syndicated
columnist Mike McManus said</B>. The law is so lenient "it is easier to divorce my wife of 26
years than to fire someone I hired one week ago," said Michigan Family Forum President
Randall Hekman, a former judge. Before no-fault laws, any spouse who wanted a divorce had
to prove the other was to blame through adultery or some form of destructive behavior.
No-fault divorce laws allow a marriage to be dissolved for almost any reason, even if only
one party wants a divorce. According to a study in Journal of Marriage and the Family, the
divorce rate has increased in 45 states since no-fault laws passed. In Michigan they increased
by 36%. Citing a connection between rising juvenile crime and the divorce rate since 1950,
state Rep. Jessie Dalman has proposed reforms. If one partner wants to reconcile, then the one
who wants a divorce will have to prove fault. Also, the law would give more power over the
division of assets to the partner who wants to reconcile. If there are children, the parents
would have to prove that the divorce is in their best interests. NIRR 9/18/95

the Senate this month. 
<P>
<B>Two legally prescribed drugs working together can induce abortion, a study found</B>. Cancer
drug methotrexate and ulcer drug misoprostol triggered abortions in 171 of 178 women, a
doctor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine said. The drugs may provide an alternative to
surgical abortion or RU 486, a drug not cleared for sale in the United States.
<P>
<B>Focus on the Family plans to offer resources on America Online this fall</B>. The Focus on the
Family forum will include stories from FOF's newsletters and information on topics such as
child care, rela- tionships, and sex. Users will also be able to interact with founder James
Dobson as well as magazine editors, authors, and broadcast producers in live chat areas and
through message boards.
<P>
<B>About 20,000 Muslims gathered in Columbus, Ohio, over Labor Day weekend for the 32nd
annual meeting of the Islamic Society of North America</B>. Workshops at the conference, whose
theme was "Islam, My Choice," discussed marriage, education, the global resurgence of Islam,
human rights, and Islamic law.
<P>
<B>Southern Baptists are launching a men's program intended to complement groups such as
Promise Keepers</B>. The goal of Men's Ministries, which begins in October, is to involve more
men in missions. Outreaches will take place through Southern Baptist churches. Men will
form teams to teach, pray, take mission trips, and evangelize. They will hold each other
accountable, support each other in their careers, and help those recovering from alcohol or
drug problems. Resource materials are available at (901) 272-2461. 
<P>
<B>United Methodism in the United States lacks definite theological boundaries, a study found</B>.
Dennis Campbell, co-director of the Study of United Methodism and American Culture, said
the denomination must renew its sense of "connection," the idea of interdependence among
diverse members set forth by John Wesley, Methodism's founder. Trying to restore a past
theological uniformity, as some in the UMC have suggested, will fail because one never
existed, said Campbell, a theology professor at Duke University Divinity School. The church
needs "renewed openness to the work of the Holy Spirit in our midst," he said.
<P>
<B>Nearly 700 elderly nuns are donating their brains to medical science in hopes of furthering
Alzheimer's research</B>. As part of the study, the nuns go through a set of tests every 18 months
to assess their balance, strength, mobility, mental agility, and memory. The nuns jokingly call
the tests, in which they race from one spot to another in a room and are asked to draw
various geometric shapes, the Nuns Olympics. The brains of 94 nuns from across the country
who have died since the study began in 1990 showed an unusually low incidence of
Alzheimer's, even though many lived into their 90s. Many of the nuns, members of the
School Sisters of Notre Dame, were well educated. Researchers are exploring the thesis that
intellectual development may protect some older people from nerve-cell damage and memory
loss. 
<P>
<B>Giving by church members is stagnant, according to empty tomb inc., a Champaign,
Ill.-based research group</B>. In 1993, yearly per capita giving was $367.39, or 2.52% of after-tax
income, about the same as in 1992. Local churches used $304.84 of that money to pay
internal expenses. They sent $62.55 to support church work at the regional, national and
international levels, where contributions are eroding, the group found. The study, The State of
Church Giving Through 1993, examined the finances of 29 Protestant denominations. It is
based on percentages of after-tax income and is adjusted for inflation.
<P>
<B>The Center for International Seamen and Truckers is located in Gulfport, Miss</B>. It provides a
place for weary travelers to make phone calls, take showers, play pool, watch videos, read
books, and pick up religious literature in various languages. Churches sponsor the center, and
volunteers handle calls and answer questions. Volunteers hand out religious pamphlets and
Bibles aboard ships.
<P>
<B>Thirty mainline Protestant and Catholic Church groups formed a coalition in an attempt to
reform the world's two largest financial institutions</B>. Members of The Religious Working
Group on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund said the banks have enslaved
developing countries in debt and devastated their environments, Ecumenical News
International reported.
<P>
<B>The Jewish Community Relations Council of New York denounced "Hebrew Christians" and
declared them "completely separate and dissociated from the Jewish community." Philip
Abramowitz accused Jewish Christians of infiltrating Jewish establishments by concealing
their Christian affiliation and agenda</B>. In an accompanying statement, Lawrence Schiffman
called for Jewish believers to be banned from synagogue membership, excluded from Jewish
cemeteries, and denied access to Jewish community centers. "Those of us Jews who believe in
Jesus always expected to be outcast," said Moishe Rosen, executive director of Jews for
Jesus. Rosen said he knows of no Messianic Jews who use deception to become involved in
Jewish groups. 
<P>
<B>A New York abortionist, accused by state officials of mishandling at least 10 abortions this
year, has been suspended</B>. Herbert Schwarz, 65, has performed about 45,000 abortions -almost 10 a day -- news reports said. State officials say Schwarz violated state laws by
attempting an abortion on an apparently seven-month-old fetus, and also mishandled the
procedure. Schwarz's license was suspended for six months in the early 1980s for "gross
negligence and incompetence" in four abortion cases, reports said. 
<P>
<B>A foundation is funding "opposition research" to help liberal and abortion-rights groups fight
conservative Christians, The Chronicle of Philanthropy said</B>. The Robert Sterling Clark
Foundation gives hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to groups such as the National
Abortion Rights Action League Foundation, the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, the
Feminist Majority Foundation, and Planned Parenthood. They use the money to build
coalitions, conduct research, and fight attempts by religious conservatives to end abortion.
Funding from the foundation also was used in the defense of the Cincinnati Contemporary
Arts Center when its director was charged with violating obscenity laws by displaying the
photos of Robert Mapplethorpe, the controversial homosexual artist.
<P>
<B>Violent incidents depicted on television rose 23% from a year ago while incidents of sex and
profanity decreased slightly, the American Family Association said</B>. Based on a four-week
monitoring period in April and May, the AFA found that sex and profanity are down 6% and
3%, respectively. In one year, viewers were exposed to 47,060 incidents of sex, violence, or
profanity. The Fox network had the most, with 16.79 incidents per hour, followed by NBC at
10.75, CBS at 9.94, and ABC at 9.54. A total of 89% of the sex on prime-time TV is
depicted outside of marriage, the AFA said.

<B>Egypt: The Rutherford Institute asked President Hosni Mubarak to secure the safety of a
Christian convert</B>. Ibrahim Aly Sharaf El-Din converted from Islam in 1983, and subsequently
had to leave the country because of persecution. He returned in 1994 to find employment and
was immediately arrested and imprisoned. He was held for eight months and was beaten and
tortured, according to the Rutherford Institute. Now free, El-Din's life is in danger from
Islamic radicals, the religious rights group said.  
<P>
<B>South Africa: Archbishop Desmond Tutu will retire next June</B>. Tutu, 64, the titular head of
the Anglican Church in South Africa, will take a yearlong sabbatical at Emory University in
Atlanta. After that, he plans to settle in Soweto and write a book or teach. The Capetown
archbishop gained prominence for his opposition to apartheid and was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1984.

<B>Zimbabwe: In response to President Robert Mugabe's scathing criticism of homosexuals
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21</A>), the Zimbabwe Council of Churches condemned homosexuality as inconsistent
with the nation's culture</B>. "The church of God finds no basis to support intimate relationships
between persons of the same sex," representatives of 20 Protestant denominations said.
Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Catholic churches also are supporting the president's
position, although they "expressed regret at his harsh language," news reports said.

the group has fewer than 500 members, military leaders claim. Fourteen Abu Sayyaf members

<B>Ten thousand charismatics and Pentecostals prayed, sang, danced, clapped, and cheered under
the common bond of the Holy Spirit during a four-day ecumenical convention last month</B>.
About half of the participants at the Congress on the Holy Spirit and World Evangelization,
held July 26-29 in Orlando, were Catholics; the rest came from a spectrum of mainline
Protestant, classical Pentecostal, and nondenominational churches. The congress included
keynote sessions and more than 100 workshops. Among the many speakers were broadcasters
Pat Robertson and Paul Crouch; Raniero Cantalamessa, a Catholic priest who often preaches
at the Vatican; Church of God in Christ Bishop Gilbert Patterson; healing evangelist Benny
Hinn; COGIC Bishop Ithiel Clemmons; Assemblies of God General Superintendent Thomas
Trask; and Episcopal Bishop John Howe. It was the fourth such rally in the last 18 years. 
<BR><B>...The Holy Spirit wants to break down walls between Catholics and Protestants, said Vinson
Synan, Regent University's theology dean who chaired the congress</B>. The Holy Spirit
empowers Christians to trust each other despite their differences, he said. According to
conference speaker Jack Hayford, pastor of the Church on the Way in Van Nuys, Calif., such
relationships can form without a "meltdown of ideologies." It is the nature of the Holy Spirit
"to blend and to bond without sacrificing uniqueness and individuality," he said. 
<BR><B>..."There will always be ecumenical problems," Synan told NIRR</B>. "We're all out trying to win
people to the Lord and we bump into each other. I'm willing to cope with the problems of
growth." A statement issued by conference organizers acknowledged that churches,
denominations, and ministries should aspire to address their "real differences" in matters of
doctrine "in a spirit of brotherly love and mutual understanding."  
<BR><B>...The numbers of spirit-filled converts are growing rapidly in the Third World</B>. Synan,
quoting missions researcher David Barrett, said the Pentecostal/charismatic movement adds
54,800 adherents a day. It comprises 25% of the world's Christians, 460 million people,
including 100 million Catholic charismatics. A highlight of the conference was a conga
procession through the aisles by Haitian Catholic charismatics. "The Haitians just set that
place on fire. The joy and exuberance was overwhelming," Synan said. 
<BR><B>...Leaders called for a continued push toward world evangelism</B>. Then, Synan said, "we'll get
together again at the end of the decade for the biggest birthday party in history" celebrating
the year 2000 and the centennial of the modern Pentecostal movement. NIRR 08/07/95

<B>Tribespeople are converting in North India, missionaries say</B>. After speaking to several
missionaries and other ministries in India, John Gilman, president of the Virginia Beach,
Va.-based Dayspring International, a missions agency, told NIRR: 
<BR><B>...In the Katihar district of Bihar, 150 people, mostly former Muslims, were baptized in one
village</B>. 
<BR><B>...In Punjab, hundreds of Sikhs became Christians as the result of "much prayer and faithful
witnessing" from local independent churches, the Arpana Prayer Network, a local ministry,
told Gilman</B>. Violence and terrorism in the region is creating an openness to the gospel,
according to Arpana. 
<BR><B>...In Rajastahn, 95 Bhalai people were converted by an indigenous ministry</B>. 
<BR><B>...In the Southern state of Kerala, Catholic charismatics are ministering to thousands of people
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/071095.html">NIRR 7/10</A>)</B>. At a center in Athirampuzha, hundreds of people from all religions come for
services. In Muringoor, the Divine Word Center attracts 10,000-15,000 people for weeklong
programs, the Union of Catholic Asian News reported.  
<BR><B>..."There has been real evidence on many fronts that the harvest is ripe in India," Don Atkin
of Resurrection Churches and Ministries, who trains church planters, told NIRR</B>. Several
churches in Southern India have been started through the Pennsylvania-based organization.

<B>The Chinese city of Kaifeng will celebrate the Jewish Feast of the Tabernacles with
Messianic evangelist Sid Roth</B>. Local government leaders are helping sponsor the October
festival, Roth told NIRR. He visited the southern city because thousands of Chinese with a
Jewish heritage live there. Some 700 heads of families have Jewish last names, he said.
During lunch with the Communist Party leader of Kaifeng, Roth proposed the idea of having
a festival to "celebrate the relationship between China and Israel." The idea "had to have been
God's" because he offered it without even thinking about it, Roth said. 
<BR><B>...The festival of Jewish singing and dancing will be held at three sites, including an outdoor
park, during the city's annual Chrysanthemum Festival, which attracts thousands of people
from around the country</B>. Roth will speak at each event, explaining the significance of the
Feast of the Tabernacles "past, present, and future," he said. The celebration commemorates
God's care and protection of the Israelites during their trek in the desert. Although Roth
preaches to all people, his ministry, Brunswick, Ga.-based Messianic Vision, follows the
principle that converting the Jews opens the door for reaching others. NIRR 08/07/95
<P>
<B>Canadian evangelicals are committed to outreach, but need better follow-through, according to
EvangelTrends, a report issued by Vision 2000 Canada</B>. The group surveyed 1,214 church
leaders and ministers, about half the number that attended its eight evangelism consultations
across Canada last year (NIRR 5/1/95). The study found that, while growth is evident,
churches "have to do better," sociologist Reginald Bibby said. Some 80% of respondents said
their churches are "attempting to evangelize," but only 68% said they have a plan for
evangelism, and only about 45% have budgets for those plans. Other findings show that
almost 40% of the leaders don't believe their churches are sensitive to their communities'
needs. About 37% said the number of people converted by their church in 1994 totaled five
or fewer. Bibby said it is disturbing that a large percentage of the churches' new members are
not necessarily new converts. About 90% transferred from other churches or are children of
members. The results present a "hard reality" that must be addressed, Vision 2000 Executive
Director Don Moore said. 
<BR><B>...Religious belief among Canadians is declining overall, the Princeton Religious Research
Center reported</B>. Belief in God slipped from 87% in 1985 to just 70% in 1995, and belief in
heaven fell from 71% to 61%, according to a Gallup poll of 1,004 adults in March.
Furthermore, 33% of Canadians say religion is very important in their lives, while 31% rate it
not very important. In the United States, those numbers are 58% and 12%, respectively.

<B>Hundreds of Campus Crusade for Christ staff workers publicly repented of personal sins
during the group's biennial national staff leadership meeting in Fort Collins, Colo., July
20-26</B>. The phenomenon of people lining up at microphones to confess their sins was
reminiscent of events that occurred among students on numerous college campuses this spring
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/071095.html">NIRR 7/10</A>). The Fort Collins meeting was the most significant in the 50 years of his
ministry, Bill Bright, founder of Campus Crusade, said in a radio interview on the Moody
Broadcasting Network.  
<BR><B>...After Nancy Leigh DeMoss of Life Action Ministries urged broken- heartedness over sin,
many of the 3,800 people in Moby Arena at Colorado State University came forward to
repent</B>. The confessions by Campus Crusade workers, who counsel college students across the
country, lasted 13 hours on July 24 and six hours the next day. After each disclosure, 15-30
people walked -- and in some cases ran -- to pray for the person who had spoken. A number
of sins were described, including bitterness, an observer said. The gymnasium became a
virtual sanctuary as those still seated in the stands prayed quietly while the numerous
revelations continued. The pattern recurred the next day after Southern Baptist leader Henry
Blackaby spoke, emphasizing confession and repentance. 
<BR><B>...The outpouring postponed scheduled events at the conference</B>. Speeches and workshops
finally resumed Wednesday afternoon, followed by a three-hour celebration and worship
service to end the conference. Many Campus Crusade staffers had prayed and fasted over the
last year in preparation for the meeting. After it ended, participants said they felt emotionally
drained but joyous because they knew they had encountered God. NIRR 08/07/95

<B>Encouraging women to foster vital relationships in Christ is the goal of Morristown,
Tenn.-based Renaissance Ministries</B>. Five conferences in the spring of 1995 will focus on
women's godly roles and how they can fulfill them, founder and President Deborah Tyler told
NIRR. A graduate of Moody Bible Institute and a church lay leader, Tyler expects the
conferences to "provide a springboard...for God's Spirit" to change women's lives.  
<BR><B>...Renaissance is similar in concept to Promise Keepers (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12</A>) but the two are not
connected, she said</B>. Renaissance's Keys for Abundant Living conferences are designed for
smaller audiences. "Women don't herd like men," Tyler said. "You can't pack 70,000 of them
into a stadium." Yet, many men who have attended Promise Keepers, and their wives, have
expressed a desire for a similar ministry for women, she said. Tyler hopes each conference
will attract about 2,000 women to hear speakers such as Luci Swindoll, Ann Graham Lotz,
and Gloria Gaither. Small-group ministry sessions will focus on topics such as effective
parenting and stress management. 
<BR><B>...The 1995 conferences are scheduled for Birmingham, Ala.; Little Rock, Ark.; Dallas, Texas;
and Nashville, Tenn</B>. In addition, a one-day Saturday conference will be held in Greenville,
S.C. For more information call, (800) 484-1941, ext. 0531. NIRR 08/07/95

<B>Thousands of evangelicals in the United Kingdom gather annually for a Christian vacation</B>.
Spring Harvest allows believers from all denominations to "get away from their local
churches and get teaching, worship, and holiday facilities," spokesperson Jeremy Wheightman
told NIRR. A national chain of camps rents the sites to Spring Harvest for four weeks every
year. Groups of participants enjoy six days of teaching and worship, then leave to make room
for the next group, he said. Founded in 1979 by Clive Calver of the Britain Evangelical
Alliance and other evangelical leaders, the first Spring Harvest attracted 3,000 people.

<B>Jews for Jesus handed out more than 1 million gospel tracts on the streets of New York City
during the group's 1995 Summertime Witnessing Program in July</B>. Some 516 people, more
than ever before, made decisions for Jesus Christ and 3,700 others indicated a desire to know
more about the gospel, the group said. In heavily emigre populations of Brooklyn, JFJ
distributed Russian-language literature. The group will conduct follow-up visits for Jews, and
local New York ministries and churches will contact gentiles. In a similar campaign in
Moscow, 79 Jews and 187 gentiles became Christians, JFJ said. 
<BR><B>...New York, one of the world's largest business and cultural centers, is home to 8 million
people, including many drug addicts, criminals, and homeless people</B>. In the group's 21 years

<B>Relief agencies are scrambling to meet the needs of refugees from United Nations "safe
areas" that have fallen to attacking Bosnian Serbs</B>. Some 30,000 women and children fled
Srebrenica and thousands more left Zepa, according to World Vision. The ministry has sent
110,000 liters of milk and 50 metric tons of fruits and vegetables to Tuzla, where many
refugees are staying. However, "there are simply no facilities in Tuzla for them," said Stevo
Dereta of the LIFE Center in Croatia, a refugee ministry associated with World Relief, an arm
of the National Association of Evangelicals. Food and medicine are in short supply and the
situation is critical, he said. Given the worsening situation, aid must be channeled into Bosnia
now, "while we know it will reach the refugees who need it," World Relief's European liaison
Martin Hartog told NIRR. If a major confrontation develops and Croatia is pulled into the
war, "there will be mass starvation," he said. Croatia is the entry point for supplies into
war-torn Bosnia, where evangelicals are carrying and distributing the aid. 
<BR><B>...Church leaders in Croatia "continue to exercise their faith in a remarkable way," Hartog
said</B>. Though physically fatigued and emotionally drained, they demonstrate "incredible
resiliency." Muslim refugees are "at first suspicious" of Christians who offer to help them, but
the practical aid and sincerity of the believers prevails, Hartog said. "Christians to them do
not represent a lot of goodness and love," he said, referring to the attacking Serbs, many of
whom are Orthodox. "But the gospel does." NIRR 08/07/95

<B>The 239,000-member Presbyterian Church in America took its sister denomination, the
215,000-member Christian Reformed Church, to task over women's ordination</B>. The CRC's
rules forbid ordination of women as pastors or elders, but a number of churches have defied
the ban and appointed women as pastors. In June, the CRC approved a compromise allowing
its regional clusters of churches to declare parts of the denomination's rules "inoperative" as
they apply to ordaining women. The Atlanta-based PCA warned the CRC that if it does not
"repent and rescind" its action, the PCA will seek its ouster from the North American
Presbyterian and Reformed Council. 
<BR><B>...Meanwhile, the CRC's regional unit in Southern California called a special assembly for
November</B>. It has invited other regional groups, churches, and congregational officers who
oppose women's ordination to take part. The meeting has been called to protest the CRC's
June action and to seek ways to "protect" congregations in areas where the local governing
body allows women to be ordained, organizers said. NIRR 08/07/95

PCUSA to restudy the COCU proposal. Many commissioners objected to the office of bishop
as called for by the plan, and also expressed concern that no separate denominational
ordinations would be allowed after it is implemented. The Office of Theology and Worship
was instructed to prepare a study guide of the plan "identifying salient issues and evaluating
the terms of participation in COCU from the perspective of Reformed theology and polity." 
<BR><B>...In other action, the commissioners voted 517-20 to rebuke "all divisive people and groups
in our church," and to urge them to repent and forgive each other</B>. Although homosexual and
feminist activists in the PCUSA caused dissention in recent years, the evangelical
Presbyterian Layman newspaper was seen as one of the main targets of the measure, sources

<B>Religious bigotry was behind the demotion of two Christians at the Resolution Trust Corp.,
the Rutherford Institute contends</B>. The religious rights organization sued the federal agency in
behalf of the pair on July 24. A superior repeatedly referred to Lindsey Fouts, former deputy
regional counsel for the RTC, as a "damn Christer," a "born-again jerk," and a "religious
zealot," the suit alleges. He later removed Fouts from his supervisory position. Other alleged
harassments included cutting Fouts off from his voice-mail and secluding him and his
paralegal assistant, Charlotte Roach, in isolated offices.

Simpson said. Both Fouts, a veteran of 15 years with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and
the RTC, and Roach had received excellent ratings on previous performance appraisals.

only 5% of non-government money they receive on political activity, down from 20%.
Present law already prohibits them from spending federal money to lobby. Groups that exceed
the 5% limit could not receive federal grants. Some conservatives in Congress claim
nonprofits receive $39 billion in federal subsidies annually, some of which is spent
improperly on political advocacy.

suffering, according to the group's statement.

<B>India: Seventeen families in Kashmir converted from Islam to Christianity, Worldwide Pulse
said</B>. The families were persecuted but they escaped and established a colony they named Isa,
which means Jesus.
<P>
<B>Malaysia: The government banned a controversial Malay translation of the Koran, newspapers
reported</B>. It is part of a drive to wipe out unorthodox Islamic teaching by the year 2000. The
volume, published in Singapore, lacks a parallel copy of the original text in Arabic, and some
of its contents deviated from mainstream Islamic teachings, officials said. The government
also has targeted at least 17 "deviant" Muslim groups it wants to stamp out.

<B>North Korea: Schoolchildren who are learning English as a second language should be able to
study the Bible as a "classic of English literature," an official told a group of American
educators</B>. The man told Dale Kietzman, president of Intermission International, that the Bible
should be printed in both English and Korean. Kietzman, who headed the group of visiting
educators, has had ongoing conversations with North Korean officials about such a possibility,
journalist Dan Wooding reported.

<B>South Korea: Where is Ahn Seung-un?  South Korean officials claim Ahn, 50, a missionary
from the Full Gospel Church in Seoul, was kidnapped in China and taken to North Korea</B>.
Ahn, who had been working in an ethnic Korean area of northeastern China for several years,
disappeared July 9 while walking with converts in Yanji, church sources said. North Korea's
official news agency insisted Ahn defected. Chinese investigators reportedly arrested one of
the alleged kidnappers. The area is populated in part by North Korean defectors. Officials in
Seoul said South Koreans working in the area are the targets of kidnapping attempts because
North Korea believes they have been helping others defect.

<B>Sri Lanka: Authorities deported United Methodist mission intern Kenneth Mulder, 25, of Ada,
Mich., after detaining him almost a week</B>. Police said they found artwork and text, which he
had created on a computer, opposing government policy in the civil war with minority Tamil
rebels in the north. They discovered the materials during a search of the offices of the
National Christian Council, where Mulder worked. Church leaders also said that the police
suspected Mulder of smuggling explosives to the rebels. Reuters quoted Mulder as saying his
only mission was to promote peace. Church leaders said Mulder's ouster was unjust.

<B>Argentina: A door-to-door salesman last year persuaded Hector Arce to buy an expensively
bound Bible on an installment plan</B>. Shortly afterward, Arce lost his job as a public servant
and bought an oven to make pizzas so he could support his three young children. But it
wasn't enough, and when he fell behind on his Bible payments, the firm sued. Last month,
court officials and police confiscated Arce's furniture, worth $1,500, and the pizza oven. Arce
said he tried to return the Bible, but was told it wouldn't cover legal costs incurred by the

<B>Uruguay: Middle- and upper-class Montevideans are showing openness to spiritual matters,
missionaries say</B>. The country is probably the most secularized in South America due to an
anti-Catholic backlash at the turn of the century, Dick Young, a Baptist General Conference
missionary, told NIRR. "The past two or three generations were taught that they were beyond
religion," he said. Disillusionment in the past decade has induced many to consider spiritism
and mysticism, but they also express an interest in Christianity. Because of the reports, CB
International is planning to begin an outreach in the capital city next year.

<B>Austria: Four of the country's 16 Catholic bishops denied allegations by a gay rights activist
that they have homosexual tendencies</B>. At least two said they were initiating lawsuits to force
Kurt Krickler to retract his statement. Krickler and his group, Opus Lei, reportedly staged the
outing as part of a campaign to lower the age of consent for homosexual sex from 18 to 14 in
line with the law for heterosexuals. He said the church was targeted first because it is partly
responsible for creating the moral climate in the predominantly Catholic country.

<B>Bulgaria: The Sofia city council voted 56-1 to permit Baptists to proceed with construction of
an orphanage</B>. The action partially reversed a vote in February rejecting the project and
halting work. Council leaders at the time cited "negative effects" the Baptists might have on
the predominantly Orthodox population. In reconsidering, the council eliminated a proposed
Bible school and church from the plans. Baptist leaders attributed the council's turn-around to
prayers and an international pressure campaign.

<B>England: Anglican leader Brandon Jackson, 60-year-old dean of the 900-year-old Gothic
cathedral in Lincoln, located in eastern England, was acquitted of adultery</B>. Verity Freestone,
a 32-year old lay worker, alleged that they had an affair after he seduced her. She described
details of the dean's bedroom for the four male jurors, two laymen and two clergy. Jackson
acknowledged he may have been overly friendly toward her, but denied having committed
immoral acts. Jackson lashed out at church authorities, accusing them of a conspiracy to
retaliate for his criticism of certain church policies. Church leaders, under pressure to reform
the centuries-old disciplinary procedures, predicted it will be the last such trial.

Protestant churches are sprouting in Islamic Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. A
church planted in Uzbekistan four years ago has grown to 3,000 members. It attracts 700-800
people to each of four Sunday services, holds daily morning services, and has planted 55
other congregations -- 22 of them in neighboring Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and
Turkmenistan. "I was thrilled when I found them. I wept," said Slavic Radchuk, a missionary
for Christian Aid Mission, a Charlottesville, Va., agency that supports indigenous Christian
workers. Radchuk revisited the region this year after traveling some 30,000 miles throughout
the former Soviet Union during 1984 while planting a number of churches.  
<BR>...About half the new believers are former Muslims, as is 95% of the general population,
CAM said. Conversion to Christianity causes family strife, and even violence. "My father
received Jesus and I wanted to kill him," said a former Muslim who now assists his father in
pastoring 250 people at three churches in Tajikistan. They have planted five other churches in
the country where some 400 people worship, CAM said.  
<BR>...For the first time, the Kyrgyz are responding, according to a Russian pastor in Kyrgyzstan.
Two churches began in Talis, Kyrgyzstan, after rallies by American evangelist Brent Regis.
He told NIRR that 20,000 Kyrgyz attended seven days of services, and about 25% of them
made commitments to Christ. Rick Lewellyn, who teaches at The School of Christ in
Tokmak, Kyrgyzstan, told NIRR that his students attend classes for three months, then go out
to make new converts and plant churches. "They don't get their diplomas until three months
later when they come back," Lewellyn said. The school averages 25 students a semester;
some 200 former students have started more than 50 churches, he said. Also, Kazakhstan has
a Bible school with about 80 students. 
<BR>...Tools of communism are being used to spread the gospel, CAM said. Christian ministries
use powerful radio transmitters built to spread communist propaganda, and empty Communist
Party cultural halls are available to local Christians as churches. For years only Russian was
taught in the Soviet republics, although many republics are beginning to teach their local
language in the schools. Thus, for now, Christians need only one language to preach.

Fifteen thousand people committed their lives to Christ during Greg Laurie's Anaheim, Calif.,
crusade July 13-16. Some 164,000 people attended the Riverside, Calif., pastor's 6th annual
crusade in Anaheim Stadium. Members of 640 churches coordinated and staffed the event,
which was organized by Laurie's Harvest Ministries.  
<BR>...Nearly 20,000 children and their parents attended Harvest Kid's Crusade on Saturday
morning, July 15. After a program with Psalty, the Singing Songbook, more than 3,200
children and 400 adults committed their lives to Christ, Laurie's ministry said. Saturday
night's program focused on teen-agers, and most of the 55,000 attendees were young people
who came to hear Laurie's preaching and several Christian rock bands. Laurie quoted lyrics
from the rock group The Police: "There's a hole in my life, shadow in my heart that's tearing
me apart. I hate this disease, God help me please." He told the crowd that if they felt the
same emptiness, "you've come to the right place tonight." Some 5,000 people responded to
the invitation to become believers. 
<BR>...Laurie is holding additional crusades this summer in Eugene, Ore., San Diego, Calif.,
Colorado Springs, Colo., Rochester, N.Y., and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. For information, call

Christians are taking the initiative to befriend and pray for their unbelieving northern
California neighbors. Four hundred homes in Yuba and Sutter counties have become "prayer
houses." Christians promise to introduce themselves to their neighbors, ask if they have prayer
needs, and, if so, pray for them, according to Greg Burnett of Harvest Evangelism. In Yuba
City alone, Christians knocked on doors of 75% of the houses in the town of 35,000. The
Christians, from 31 congregations, also handed out 5,400 videos titled Are You Going to
Heaven? and many Billy Graham booklets titled Steps To Peace With God, Burnett said. 
<BR>...The San Jose-based group is testing the "prayer evangelism" in California after its effective
use in Argentina; Harvest Evangelism branched off from Argentine-born evangelist Luis
Palau's organization in 1983. Response has been "amazing," Burnett said. "People are open to
prayer. They appreciate the concern." When Christians show sincere interest in forming a
relationship with neighbors, it "builds bridges and gives God an opportunity to work," he said.
<BR>...Flooding the area with neighborly help was also part of the northern California outreach,
organizers said. This spring, Christians blitzed Yuba and Sutter counties with kindness, giving
pizzas to workers in hospital emergency rooms and police departments, spraying herbicides
and doing landscaping for cities, painting over graffiti, conducting clothing giveways and free
car washes, and giving away hot dogs in front of the local WalMart. 
<BR>..."The whole spiritual climate of the community has shifted," Burnett said. "The city now is
looking at the churches and saying `we didn't know that you were relevant and that you
cared.'" Mayors, city administrators, fire and police departments "know they are being prayed
for," he said. NIRR 07/24/95

Some 4,000 Christians from a variety of cultures, denominations, and races celebrated
Pentecost together in Greensboro, N.C., last month. BondFire `95 was a "spiritual firestorm"
that will ignite reconciliation efforts, said Vinson Synan, dean of the Regent University
Divinity School in Virginia Beach, Va. Synan spoke at the rally along with bishops Ithiel
Clemmons of the Church of God in Christ and B.E. Underwood of the International
Pentecostal Holiness Church. The three men helped found the Pentecostal/Charismatic
Churches of North America (NIRR 10/31/94) in Memphis, Tenn. The PCCNA, an interracial
association, began a new era of cooperation in Pentecostalism, which has been divided along
racial boundaries for 70 years. NIRR 07/24/95

The choice in America's culture wars "is between virtues and nihilism," William Bennett,
co-director of Washington, D.C.- based Empower America, told the International Congress on
the Family. Some 3,000 Christian counselors, pastors, and lay workers attended the July 5-9
conference in Denver co-sponsored by Focus On The Family and The American Association
of Christian Counselors. One hundred twenty-one workshops emphasized practical aspects of
family life, parenting, and counseling. Other speakers included Kay James, Adrian Rogers,
and E.V. Hill. 
<BR>...James Dobson lashed out at a United Nations conference on the rights of women, to be held
in Beijing in September. The FOF founder said conference leaders want to eliminate gender
distinctions, and that constitutes "the greatest threat to the family that I've seen in my
lifetime." American delegates to the conference could be imprisoned if they take Bibles into
China for distribution or engage in unauthorized religious activities, State Department officials
warned. NIRR 07/24/95

A Christian group is helping broker peace between warring factions in Liberia's civil war. A
three-person delegation from the St. Joseph, Mo.-based Agency for Holistic Evangelism and
Development played a major role at a conference in Abuja, Nigeria, in May. Romeo Horton,
a native Liberian and former government official, led the delegation as it met with
representatives of the six warring factions and nine African nations affected by the five-year
conflict. In one meeting, Muslims, Hindus, Christians, and members of warring factions
joined arms as Horton prayed for peace, Charles Oakes of AHEAD told NIRR. At the end of
the conference, the warlords agreed the war has to end and asked that AHEAD send a
delegation to a subsequent meeting in Monrovia. 
<BR>...The Liberians were impressed with a plan for rebuilding the country through the resources
of Christian ministries, AHEAD founder Augustus Marwieh, a Liberian minister, told NIRR.
Marwieh, who had become nationally known through a television ministry, was forced to flee
Liberia in the early '90s because of the war. A church planter for 17 years, Marwieh formed
AHEAD to help churches and ministries become self-sufficient through entrepreneurship,
hands-on skills, and academic education. The Liberian church is too dependent on Western
funding for its survival, Marwieh said. NIRR 07/24/95

Christians in Hong Kong are struggling with fears, anxieties, and hopelessness in light of the
British protectorate's impending absorption into China in 1997. Despite that, hundreds of
them joined together with other Christians to "foster a citywide prayer movement for revival,"
said David Bryant, president of Concerts of Prayer International. Bryant led local pastors and
church leaders in a concert of prayer in Hong Kong July 1-3. 
<BR>..."I don't believe there is any city more strategic for Christ's global cause than Hong Kong
right now," Bryant said. About 500 pastors and church leaders attended a three-hour training
session and an estimated 10,000 came to a prayer rally in Hong Kong Stadium, according to
COP. The leaders were inspired by the prospect of how God could bless China if the Hong
Kong church enters 1997 unified, prayerful, and "joyful in hope," Bryant said. He hopes to
hold a Concerts of Prayer rally on the mainland next year. NIRR 07/24/95

Twenty-somethings in Israel may be more responsive to the gospel than any other generation,
conferees at the Fifth International Conference on Jewish Evangelism, held near Bethlehem,
agreed. About 175 evangelists, pastors, and church leaders came to the conference, hosted by
the Lausanne Consultation on Jewish Evangelism, part of the Lausanne Committee for World
Evangelization.  
<BR>...Jewish youth are spiritually adrift, sexually promiscuous, taking illegal drugs, and generally
embracing the hedonistic lifestyle of American popular culture, Southern Baptist Convention
representative Jim Sibley said. "If we're not in the midst of a full-blown hippie movement,
we're on the verge of one." Yet this generation is more likely to accept the gospel because
they are "curious enough and open enough" to explore spiritual things, Sibley said.

Another financial scandal has swept American colleges -- including  Christian colleges. The
Common Fund, which oversees $20 billion entrusted to it by colleges and other schools,
announced that a securities trader at a firm that manages its money lost $128 million by
engaging in "unauthorized trading." Weeks earlier, Christian colleges were among nonprofits
suffering larger losses in The Foundation For New Era Philanthropy bankruptcy (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/071095.html">NIRR 7/10</A>).
<BR>...The trader, Kent Ahrens, 39, worked at First Capital Strategists in York, Pa. Ahrens lost a
"relatively small amount of money" three years ago when he speculated with funds that were
not supposed to be risked, Fred Spar, a spokesman for Westport, Conn.-based The Common
Fund, told NIRR. When Ahrens tried to conceal the loss by speculating with more money, he
compounded his error, Spar said. Ahrens' actions violated "very clear and strict guidelines"
established by First Capital and The Common Fund. The losses were discovered when "things
got too hot for Ahrens and he told his boss," Spar said.  
<BR>...The Common Fund, which has an excellent investment record, handles the investment
programs of a number of Christian colleges, although how much money each school lost, if
any, was not immediately clear. Only a few of First Capital's funds suffered losses, and it is
not clear which investors had money in those funds. The losses are reductions in interest
income only, and no principal is threatened, Spar said. 
<BR>...Most schools investing in The Common Fund are too small to afford professional fund
managers, so they pooled their money. According to Spar, among the long list of schools that
invested in the fund, but which did not necessarily suffer losses, are: Abilene Christian
University, Biola University, Westmont College, North Park College, Trinity College, Trinity
Christian College, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Taylor University, Asbury College,
Eastern Nazarene College, Calvin College, Houghton College, and Dallas Theological
Seminary. Wheaton College said it had invested in The Common Fund, but did not lose any
money. 
<BR>...Messiah College in Grantham, Pa., had invested $60 million in The Common Fund, The
Philadelphia Inquirer said. As a result, the school's expected income from its investments this
fiscal year fell significantly. Messiah also deposited $2 million with New Era last fall. As one
of the later arrivals in that alleged scheme, Messiah was to receive its contribution plus $2
million in matching funds, but the pyramid collapsed and the money disappeared.

Three creditors in the New Era bankruptcy case filed a class-action suit against Prudential
Securities. They contend that Prudential broker Stuart Bianchi of Kenosha, Wis., conspired
with New Era founder Jack Bennett to defraud charities and individual donors. Bianchi issued
letters indicating that Prudential had placed participants' money in escrow accounts, the suit
alleges. In reality, according to a suit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission
against Bennett, virtually all the money placed with Bianchi was commingled in a single
account that Bennett controlled. The SEC says Bennett diverted the funds to companies he
controlled, and used them as collateral on a margin trading account to pay early depositors in
a purported matching-grant program. Prudential hastened New Era's bankruptcy when it
seized the account to cover $45 million New Era had borrowed. 
<BR>...The class-action suit seeks to recover the $45 million. If successful, it would fatten New
Era assets to $75 million, against estimated losses of about $107 million. The suit was filed
by the Rescue Mission Alliance, Sacred Works, and Wesley Skinner, all of the Syracuse,
N.Y., area. Prudential spokesman Charles Perkins said the suit was without merit. But he
acknowledged that an assistant to Bianchi had issued letters over six months in 1994
inaccurately stating that escrow accounts had been established for charities. It was an innocent
error that was corrected by her superiors, he said. Bennett used the letters to help allay
questions by prospective depositors. 
<BR>...Bennett's lawyers filed motions seeking dismissal of the SEC suit and another filed by the
Pennsylvania attorney general. They argued that the SEC has no jurisdiction in the case since
agreements between New Era and nonprofit participants were not securities, and deposited
funds were not investments.  
<BR>...New Era is the single largest bankruptcy in the nonprofit sector in U.S. history, attorney
Michael Bloom said at a meeting of creditors in Philadelphia last month. Bankruptcy judge
Bruce Fox this month confirmed the election of former federal judge Arlin Adams as trustee
in the case. Adams called for another meeting of creditors July 24 in Philadelphia.

A ministry to Moscow's poor and homeless fights government bureaucrats and criminals to
remain in operation, according to Keston News Service. "If it weren't for my faith in Christ, I
wouldn't even think of living this way," said Aleksandr Ogorodnikov, founder of the
Christian Mercy Society. CMS is an indigenous, independent Christian organization that runs
a soup kitchen and homeless shelter. Its operation is housed in a 17th century building that is
under reconstruction. Though Ogorodnikov deems the building unfit for human habitation, he
began housing former prostitutes there when they begged him to get them off the streets. 
<BR>...City bureaucrats evicted Ogorodnikov from his modern offices in central Moscow and
others demanded bribes to let him continue his programs. Once, his soup kitchen was shut
down for several weeks until an international protest from British and American legislators
forced the local government to let it reopen. The local bureaucrats are trying to take the
building so they can rent it for commercial purposes, Ogorodnikov said. Local criminals are
also a problem, necessitating the services of volunteer security guards. Shortly after the
women moved into his shelter a mobster visited him and demanded to see them, Ogorodnikov
said. NIRR 07/24/95

An effort to tie Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) standards of clergy sexual conduct more closely
to the Bible and historic confessions of faith has failed. At issue was a proposed change to
the 2.7-million-member denomination's Book of Order. The new wording said the life of the
ordained should "be a demonstration to the church and the world of the Christian faith and
life as defined by Scripture and the Confessions." The wording is similar to the present rule
with the addition of "as defined by Scripture and the Confessions." Proponents said the
change would bar practicing homosexuals from the ministry. The proposal needed the votes of
86 of the 171 presbyteries, but garnered only 82. NIRR 07/24/95

Disciple Renewal, an evangelical group in the mainline Christian Church (Disciples of

The Washington, D.C., suburb of Reston, Va., has been chosen as the new home of the
United Methodist Church's Board of Global Ministries. The site-selection committee's
recommendation, reached after a three-year consideration of about two dozen cities, will be
voted on at the UMC general conference next spring in Denver. Currently based in New
York, the board oversees the UMC's foreign ministries and other national ministry activities.
The official reason for the move from New York was to reduce costs, but conservatives said
the agency needed to be closer to the UMC grass roots and away from liberal influences in

The General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church rejected a request from its
North American division to allow the ordination of women. Delegates meeting in Utrecht,
The Netherlands, rejected the idea by a vote of 1,481 to 673. North American president
Alfred McClure warned that a generation of "bright and devout" young Adventists would be
"seriously disillusioned" by a vote opposing ordination. Most backers of the proposal were
from North America and Europe, while opponents were primarily from Africa, Asia, and
Latin America. In other action, leaders cautioned against setting dates for the Second Coming
of Christ. NIRR 07/24/95

The American Civil Liberties Union has taken the Upshur County, W.Va., school district to
court for permitting a citizens group to place a box of Bibles on school property for students
to take. The Rutherford Institute, a religious rights watchdog group based in Charlottesville,

U.S. District Judge Robert Propst said the American Civil Liberties Union and three Gadsden

Vietnam's communist government "is to be held accountable for many things, but the people
of Vietnam should be reached out to with love and healing," war veteran and evangelist Dave
Roever told NIRR. The Clinton Administration officially recognized the country this month.
Roever, whose ministry runs medical clinics and provides clothing and educa- tional
assistance to Vietnamese children, said economic freedom will spawn religious freedom.  
<BR>...Reconciliation with Vietnam can heal the "deep and lasting wounds" of the war, said World
Vision President Bob Seiple, a former Marine captain who flew 300 missions over Vietnam.
"By reaching back to help," veterans are healed of scars from the war, Dave Ohlerking of
Children's Cup International told NIRR. The relief-and-development organization gives
veterans the opportunity to help Vietnamese children (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/062695.html">NIRR 6/26</A>). Del Wantland, executive
director of Point Man Internation- al, a ministry of and for veterans, said that a veteran who
recently made a ministry trip there came back a different person. "It changed all the tapes in
his mind," Wantland told NIRR. Wantland did not favor recognizing Vietnam. Veterans want
to see the Vietnamese people helped, but suspect that Vietnamese officials will benefit more
from the new relationship, he said. NIRR 07/24/95

Older adults who practice their faith are healthier. They have lower blood pressure, fewer
strokes and heart attacks, and less chance of dying from coronary artery disease, according to
Harold Koenig, a professor at Duke University Medical Center, and Andrew Weaver, a
clinical psychologist. Their study comparing middle-aged and elderly men in Israel found that
coronary artery disease was twice as high among non-religious men, they said in an article in
The Lutheran. Religious belief softens the psychological and social stresses that accompany
aging, they said. NIRR 07/24/95

What race was Jesus? The answers to that question, and others regarding race, are influenced
by the race of the people asking and answering the question. That is one of the findings of a
survey of black adults, said political scientist Lynn Sanders of the University of Chicago. One
question in the survey asked what color Jesus Christ was. Nearly a third (31%) who thought
they were being interviewed by an African American said Jesus was black, compared with
17% who thought they were being interviewed by a white. The percentage who said they
didn't think of Jesus as either black or white increased from 55% for those who thought they
were being questioned by blacks to 74% for those who assumed they were being interviewed
by whites. All interviewers were black. NIRR 07/24/95

President Clinton's order instructing administration officials to clarify for public school
officials the religious rights of students is "symbolism without substance," said Michael
Whitehead, general counsel of the Southern Baptist Christian Life Commission. The president,
who announced the directive in a speech at a Virginia high school this month, said he was
"deeply troubled" that many Americans believe their religious beliefs are endangered by the
government. He listed 10 activities in public schools that are protected by the Constitution.
But he also said school officials had, on occasion, wrongly prohibited students from such
practices as reading the Bible silently in study hall and praying over their lunches. Whitehead
said the directive lacks enforcement power and noted that no executive order or proposed
legislation was issued to stop the violations. Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law
and Justice said the president was just "playing politics" with the issue to shore up re-election
support with a disenchanted constituency. 
<BR>...In contrast, the Baptist Joint Committee, which represents other Baptist denominations,
endorsed Clinton's approach. Informing teachers and other educators about the issue is
important, BJC officials said. NIRR 07/24/95

Islamic extremists are using the Internet for planning strategies, according to the International
Institute for the Study of Islam and Christianity. Radical groups are using the net to bypass
censorship laws in their countries and communicate with like-minded organizations in other
countries, the group said. Algeria's Armed Islamic Group issues regular e-mail communiques,
one which threatened to kill the relatives of Algerian soldiers and police. Other groups have
posted manuals on military training and methods for smuggling weapons across borders. Ease
of communication and lack of government oversight make it possible for European and
radical Islamic groups to work together effectively, IISIC said. NIRR 07/24/95

A registered nurse who witnessed three partial-birth abortions said it was "the most horrifying
experience of my life." Brenda Shafer of Franklin, Ohio, was working for a nursing agency in
September 1993 when she accepted a three-day assignment to the Women's Medical Center,
an abortion clinic in Dayton. "I was at that time very pro-choice," and even told her two
teen-age daughters that if they got pregnant she would make them have an abortion, Shafer
said in a July 9 letter to a congressman. 
<BR>...One of the three late-term abortions Shafer saw involved a woman who was six months
pregnant, she said. As Martin Haskell, the doctor who runs the clinic, delivered the body and
arms up to the neck, the baby's "little fingers were clasping together. He was kicking his
feet," Shafer said. "All the while his little head was still stuck inside." Haskell then "took a
pair of scissors and inserted them into the back of the baby's head. Then he opened the
scissors up. Then he stuck the high-pow- ered suction tube into the hole and sucked the
baby's brains out," she said. Haskell delivered the rest of the body and "threw the baby in a
pan along with the placenta and the instruments he'd used. I saw the baby move in the pan,"
she said. The baby, which had Down's syndrome, "had the most perfect, angelic face I have
ever seen," she said. The two other partial-birth abortions Shafer saw involved babies that had
no defects, she said. 
<BR>...The U.S. House Judiciary Committee on July 18 approved a bill to ban partial-birth
abortions. The bill is expected to go to the full House. NIRR 07/24/95

A third of U.S. voters believe people of the same sex should be able to marry if they love
each other, according to a nationwide poll by EPIC-MRA-Mitchell Research of Lansing,
Mich. Those affirming the position tended to be younger, have higher income, and have more
education than those opposed to it, said EPIC-MRA founder Ed Sarpolus. He told reporters he
had expected single-digit affirmation because voters are becoming more conservative. No
state permits homosexuals to marry, though a dozen or so cities permit same-sex couples to
register in a domestic partnership. NIRR 07/24/95

Susan Smith's pastor said the confessed murderer found God during her months in solitary
confinement. Mark Long, the United Methodist Church minister at Smith's mother's church in
Buffalo, S.C., heard Smith's confession of faith and baptized her at a maximum-security
prison in Columbia, S.C., in February. Smith faces a possible death sentence for the Oct. 25
drownings of her 3-year-old son Michael and his 14-month-old brother, Alex. She confessed
to letting them drown when she sent her car into a lake. Smith attended services at the
Buffalo UMC once a month before her children's fate became known. 
<BR>..."She has found forgiveness from God," said Long, who also helped officiate at the Smith
boys' funeral last year and has met regularly in prison with Smith. The 23-year-old is far
more troubled by life than by the prospect of death in the electric chair, Long said. That
would probably change as Smith "is afforded the opportunity to grow in faith and to know
that she is not alone, that God is with her." Smith, whom doctors have testified is suicidal, no
longer writes desperate letters to her dead sons seeking their forgiveness, Long said. 
<BR>...Smith's defense lawyers fought to have her confession excluded as evidence. They said
Sheriff Howard Wells, a Christian, acknowledged lying to Smith in a church gymnasium Nov.
3 in order to elicit her confession. Wells then prayed with her, the lawyers said.

Jeanne Audrey Powers, a United Methodist executive, announced she has been a lesbian all
her life. She made the statement before preaching at a Minneapolis meeting of the
Reconciling Churches Convocation. The RCC includes nearly 100 UMC churches that
welcome homosexuals. UMC law forbids ordination of "practicing homosexuals," but does not
define the term or compel people to so identify themselves. Powers said she will not resign,
surrender her ordination papers, or reveal whether she is a practicing lesbian. She is associate
general secretary of the UMC's General Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious
Concerns and helped organize the 1993 RE-Imagining conference (NIRR 11/14/94) that paid
homage to Sophia, goddess of wisdom. 
<BR>...Leaders of Good News, a UMC evangelical caucus, called for Powers to be reprimanded or
removed. They accused her of a premeditated attack on UMC standards. However, confusion
over the term "practicing" may mean an ineffective response by the Minnesota regional UMC
conference, the leaders told NIRR. Fallout from the case may force next year's UMC General
Conference to deal definitively with the issue, they said. NIRR 07/24/95

On Sunday afternoons, "I go to bed and rest." Faithful service to the church runs in the

Canada: A Messianic Jewish congregation in Montreal was criticized by a group of Catholics,
mainline Protestants, Orthodox Jews, and Unitarian Universalists. The group, Montreal
Christian-Jewish Dialogue, wrote to a newspaper chiding Congregation She'ar Yeshuv for
"creating confusion" by publicly celebrating Jewish holidays, calling their leaders rabbis, and
worshiping on the Jewish Sabbath. The group said the practices are misleading because
Messianic Jews "are not members of the Jewish community." Larry Rich of Chosen Peoples

Two teen-age clients of an abortion clinic can sue pro-life protesters for invasion of privacy,
the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled. Demonstrators found the girls' names in a clinic
garbage can in the Detroit suburb of Livonia in 1991 (NIRR 11/29/93). Lois Mitoraj, who is a
nun, and Lynn Mills, a spokeswoman for Operation Rescue, inscribed the girls' names on
posters urging, "Don't kill your baby." The girls were 14 and 18 at the time. The ruling
overturned a 1993 lower-court decision in a $350,000 lawsuit against the protesters. That
decision found privacy rights were not violated because the names were found in the clinic's
garbage. Mills said she will appeal the decision.

must emphasize "the protection of unborn life." Neither women nor doctors who ignore the
counseling and carry out the abortion will be punished. Health insurance will pay for the

<P>
<B>Boulder, Colo</B>. -- a center of the New Age movement -- is experiencing a Christian renewal.
Four years ago, many Boulder County pastors were frustrated, angry, and on the verge of
leaving town because Boulder seemed impervious to the Gospel. Nearly half of the county's
200 churches were experiencing serious divisions, pastors told NIRR. 
<BR><B>..."We had our backs to the wall," Cornell Haan, pastor of Harvest Baptist Church, told
NIRR</B>. Then God blessed Boulder's pastors through Eric Amagada, a Nigerian graduate
student, Haan said. Amagada befriended the pastors and their families, prayed with each of
them, began weekly pastors' prayer meetings, and "just loved them," Haan said.  
<BR><B>...The prayer meetings were "nothing short of fantastic" as the ministers unashamedly praised
God and prayed for revival, Haan said</B>. Over time, God transformed their anger into love, said
Mark Tidd, pastor of Crestview Christian Reformed Church. Pastors who had been "praying
as if Boulder was Sodom" began seeing the city as Nineveh -- more in need of compassion
and aid than condemnation, Tidd told NIRR. "God wasn't going to change the city until He
changed the heart of the pastors," he said. 
<BR><B>..."Then the Lord led pastors to do something I have not seen before," Haan said</B>. The
ministers dedicated themselves to serving the city, and formed a group called City Vision.
They introduced themselves to Boulder's leaders -- the mayor, city council members, county
commissioners, chief of police, county sheriff, superintendent of schools, and others. The
pastors approached them with the attitude of servants, offering to pray with them and help in
practical ways. Civic leaders were "shocked and delighted," Haan said.  
<BR><B>...The pastors' new outlook touched Judith Albino, president of Colorado University</B>.
Addressing a City Vision meeting, Albino began to cry. "It's your faces -- you're so kind,"
she said, acknowledging personal struggles. She has since returned to her Christian faith and
attends a Vineyard church, often sitting near Bill McCartney, the former CU football coach
and Promise Keepers founder, with whom she had clashed publicly.  
<BR><B>...The pastors have made good on their offers to serve</B>. They helped start a drop-in center for
teens, and a ranch for troubled youth is in the works. The Boulder Valley Human Resources
Coordinating Council invited Haan to help coordinate social services in the area. When he
arrived at his first meeting, the group stood and applauded. "The faith community has been
absent for 30 years," said Boulder County Sheriff George Epp, the group's chairman.
Christian leaders at CU also are beginning to serve the city the way City Vision's pastors do. 
<BR><B>...Boulder still is overwhelmingly cold to Christianity</B>. It is a hub of witchcraft and satanic
worship, site of the largest Buddhist temple in the country, and home to a multitude of
"isms." But the faith is "beginning to get a hearing" for the first time in decades, Tidd said.
People pose intellectual questions, and Christians must be ready to answer in a truthful and
frank manner, he said. Boulder Christians are reaching out to the "spiritually bruised and
confused," many of whom do not feel comfortable in straightlaced churches, he said.
Congregations are growing, as is Tidd's, which has more than doubled in four years. Pastors
are revitalized, and the Lord is moving, believers say. "If it can happen in Boulder, it can
happen anywhere," Tidd said.  NIRR 9/4/95

<P>
<B>Five thousand people have come to faith in Christ at a Pensacola, Fla., church since revival
broke out there June 18</B>. Congregants at Brownsville Assembly of God had looked forward to
a Father's Day lunch after Texas evangelist Stephen Hill preached during the Sunday morning
service. But God had other plans, assistant pastor Richard Crisco said. Instead of concluding
around noon, the service stretched until 4 p.m. as a spiritual renewal gripped congregants,
who flooded the altar. "We didn't take Daddy out to eat that day," Crisco told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...Another outpouring occurred during a 5 -hour service that evening</B>. Congregants urged Hill
to extend his visit several more days, and he began canceling appointments, including a trip
to Russia. Crowds swelled to 2,500 a night, five days a week. Worshipers came from a
spectrum of denominations, including Methodist, Baptist, Episcopal, Nazarene, Catholic, and
Church of Christ. Buses brought visitors from around the Southeast and other areas of the
United States. Some came from overseas. 
<BR><B>...About 116,000 people, including 35,000 first-time visitors, have attended the Brownsville
AG since Father's Day</B>. On average, more than 100 people become Christians each night,
Crisco said. Many converts came directly from local bars to attend the services, which usually
last until 2 a.m. The church, comprised mostly of upper-middle-class congregants, is near
pawn shops and used-car lots. Several nightclub actors, performers, and musicians reportedly
have come to Christ at the services and testified they quit performing at the bars. Prostitutes
and drunkards stand next to men in three-piece suits at the services, one woman said. "It's the
very poor next to the very well off, all looking for prayer together," she told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...William McCaskill, pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church in Columbus, Miss., attended
the Aug</B>. 18 service. McCaskill, who also has visited the Toronto Vineyard Church (NIRR
8/7), told NIRR that manifestations of the Holy Spirit in the two places are similar, but there
have been "a lot more salvations" in Pensacola. McCaskill has questioned the validity of some
emotional behavior that occurs during such services, but believes that "this is a genuine work
of God." When people have been addicted to drugs or alcohol, or involved in pornography,
the "interaction of the Holy Spirit with the unholy" may produce "strange forms of
deliverance," he said. 
<BR><B>...Brownsville pastors urged visitors to "take the anointing back to their churches," said
Crisco</B>. He receives telephone calls almost daily from visitors reporting that the Spirit of God
is moving powerfully during services at their churches. In particular, local Methodist churches
"are going bananas," Crisco said. Linda Smith, youth director at Pine Forest United Methodist
Church, said she has "never seen such fast-forward spiritual growth" in her 27 years of
discipling young people. Many in her 55-member youth group who visited the services have
repented of various sins and have "become so sensitive to the Holy Spirit," she told NIRR.

<B>Another "Miracle in Modesto" is happening -- this time, in Santa Maria, Calif</B>. (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6</A>).
Visitors are flooding the stage to accept Jesus Christ as the evangelistic drama Heaven's
Gates and Hell's Flames (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/071095.html">NIRR 7/10</A>) is performed at First Assembly of God. More than 200
people a night -- some 25% of those who attend the play -- have come forward for salvation
since the play opened Aug. 20, organizers told NIRR. Entire families, as well as the teen-age
children of pastors, have come to Christ. The play graphically depicts heaven and hell. 
<BR><B>..."I have never seen anything grab a hold of an entire community the way this has," Ben
Ellsworth, the church's pastor, told NIRR</B>. Each night of the play -- staged four times a week
-- lines form outside two hours before it begins. "Everywhere you go in town, people are
talking about this event," he said. Thirty churches of various denominations are working
together to produce the play. "One of the biggest miracles was the cooperative spirit,"
Ellsworth said. 
<BR><B>...Several months of planning have gone into the follow-up of new Christians</B>. They are
directed back to their home churches -- or to another area church if one is not specified on
response cards. Discipleship is carried out by 1,000 follow-up workers in various churches,
trained in the months before the play began through the Discipleship Institute of nearby
Morro Bay, Calif. Organizers are unsure how long they will stage the drama. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>The number of churches in Boston has increased dramatically, according to Emmanuel Gospel
Center, a parachurch group in the city</B>. In 1993, EGC counted about 500 congregations in
Boston, a 50% increase in 25 years. That means there have been more new churches started
in that time than any other period in Boston's 365-year history, said Doug Hall, who directs
EGC. Growth is occurring mostly among evangelical Protestant churches while a number of
mainline churches are shrinking and closing. 
<BR><B>...Foreign immigration into Boston and personal evangelism by local churches spurred the
growth, much of which occurred among non-whites, EGC said</B>. The city is so diverse that
worship services are conducted in 34 languages. 
<BR><B>...In addition, members of churches planted in Boston in the last 25 years have started other
churches in New England and around the world, said Hall</B>. First-generation immigrants
"network with their homelands" to plant churches in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, he said. 
<B><BR>...Most Christians don't understand the potential of cities, said Hall, who has studied Boston
churches for 30 years</B>. They consider urban areas "heathen environments" impossible to crack
with the gospel. Yet resources and networking potential make cities "the greatest asset you
could ever imagine for missions." NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Inmates at Lewes Prison call chaplain David Powe "Sky Pilot" because he directs them to
heaven</B>. The first question Powe asks inmates after he learns their names is, "Do you want to
know God?" An Anglican vicar, Powe became chaplain of the 500 inmates at the East
Sussex, England, prison 15 months ago. Since that time, 315 have become Christians.  
<BR><B>...Powe "doesn't pussyfoot around," Peter Walker, executive director of Prison Fellowship of
England and Wales, told NIRR</B>. He is outgoing and dynamic and has set a goal for daily
conversions, Walker said. "It's a thief-on-the-cross ministry here -- if I don't give them the
opportunity to accept Christ now, I've lost them," Powe told Alpha magazine. Lewes is
similar to a county jail and prisoners do not stay long before being released or transferred to
long-term prisons. One reason God is using Lewes is because transferred inmates "take their
new faith with them" to other prisons, Walker said.     
<BR><B>...Powe is "reaping the benefits of 10 years of intercessory prayer," Walker said</B>. A local PF
group has met monthly since 1985 to pray for Lewes' prisoners, and once held a prayer walk
around the jail. Some 2,000 PF volunteers work with the chaplains in 125 of the country's
132 prisons.  
<BR><B>...At Exeter Prison, what appears to be a "sovereign move of the Holy Spirit" is taking place,
Walker said</B>. Prisoners are experiencing Toronto Blessing manifestations and are falling to
their knees in repentance during chapel. At one service, chaplain Bill Birdwood did not even
speak. He had just opened the order of service book when men began to pray and repent.  
<BR><B>...More than 200 Exeter inmates have become Christians in a year, Walker said</B>. Birdwood has
been chaplain for several years, but had "seen little fruit" until God touched him during a
service, telling him revival was coming, Walker said. Prison authorities say they have seen
marked improvement in individuals and the overall atmosphere at their prisons. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Because of social and political changes, more Jews are becoming Christians in South Africa
than anywhere else in the world outside the former Soviet Union, according to Jews for Jesus</B>.
Some 310 Jews have converted since the group began its South African outreach in 1989. A
Messianic congregation in Johannesburg attracts 75 believers for its Friday night services.
Three hundred converts in five years may not seem like great success, but "it's all
hand-picked fruit -- one by one," JFJ's David Brickner told NIRR. "We don't see a Billy
Graham type of response." People don't convert by street witnessing, but through one-on-one
relationships and the influence of family members, he said. Other ministries and churches are
developing a heart for Jewish ministry, and are praying for and witnessing to the 110,000
Jews in the country, Barron said.  
<BR><B>...The "tremendous social, political, and cultural churning" that accompanied the end of
apartheid created an environment that shook people out of their complacency and
self-sufficiency, JFJ Director for South Africa Andrew Barron told NIRR</B>. "There was
tremendous spiritual ferment going on and people were being pursued by God, and He let us
participate in that." One accountant became a Christian after he was beaten for doing work
for a black organization. He and his family lived in fear until his daughter became a Christian
and proclaimed she was no longer afraid. Six months later, after the rest of his family
converted, Barron led the man to accept Christ. Some 2,000 Jews, about 1% of the Jewish
population in South Africa, are Christians, Brickner said. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Amid the violence of war, evangelical churches are starting in Bosnia-Herzegovina, World
Relief reported</B>. In the eastern city of Tuzla, where more than 30,000 people have taken
refuge, an evangelical church is providing relief and baptizing new believers, Baptist minister
David Lively told NIRR. Ten believers were baptized over one weekend recently. In the eight
months since it began, 23 people have been baptized and 45 attend regularly. "That may not
seem like a lot in a city of 100,000," Lively told NIRR. "But on the other hand, we are
seeing a steady stream of people coming to know Jesus, where there were no (evangelical)
believers before." Many converts are the children of "mixed-marriages" between any of the
three ethnic groups that are fighting. "If Mom is a Serb and Dad is a Muslim, where do you
fit?" said Lively. An assistant pastor at Northside Baptist Church in Atlanta, Lively has
ministered to Muslims, Croats, and Serbs in the former Yugoslavia for the past three years
through Agape ministries, a Croatia-based relief and evangelistic group. Another church
founded by Agape operates in Mostar (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12</A>). 
<BR><B>...The churches were launched by Nikola Skrinjaric, a Croat who has "a vision to plant
churches all through Bosnia-Herzegovina," Lively said</B>. Skrinjaric began by delivering relief
supplies to Mostar, then helping found the church there. When a political organization in
Tuzla asked him to establish an Agape relief center, he agreed on the condition that he also
could start a church. Skrinjaric now is trying to establish a relief center and a church in Bijac,
which had been besieged until last month. He will go everywhere "because God gave him a
vision to reach all these open ears," Lively said. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Christians are developing farming techniques that help missionaries assist indigenous farmers</B>.
The American Scientific Affiliation, an organization dedicated to serving the church through
research science (NIRR 8/28/93), discussed such methods at its annual meeting July 22-25.
"We are trying to think creatively about the needs of Third World countries and how to meet
them," ASA President Donald Munro told NIRR. Projects include developing more effective
methods for farming in dry areas and researching natural insecticides from indigenous plants.
One participant, Martin Price, executive director of the Educational Concerns for World
Hunger Organization, told members about velvet beans, a plant developed by his organization.
Planted with corn, the beans grow over the stalk and kill weeds. When the bean dies, it
creates a mulch that makes good soil for future planting. "Missionaries say their yield has
been increased two to three times by using it," Munro said. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Baptist churches in the former Yugoslavia have split along the same ethnic lines as the rest of

Croatia, and the Union of Evangelical Christians-Baptists of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. Meeting at the recent Baptist World Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina (NIRR
8/21), representatives of the three groups discussed their differences. The war has strained
relationships and Baptists are on different sides of the ethnic and political problems created
by the conflict, Baptist Press reported. Croatian Christian publications were politically
"inflammatory and one-sided" at the outset of the war, charged Dane Vidovic and Dragisa
Armus, respectively of the Serb and Yugoslav Baptist unions. 
<BR><B>..."Our only hope is to emphasize the message of Jesus Christ</B>. Only this can unite us," Armus
said. The others agreed, mentioning that the mass of humanitarian work distracts from
spreading the gospel. Christian infrastructures are suffering and, although the refugees are
cared for, no one is preaching to them, Vidovic said. "If we had more resources for
evangelism like Bibles and Christian literature before the war broke out, then perhaps
Christians would have been able to prevent the war," Croatian leader Branco Lovrec said. NIRR 9/4/95

after his case was discussed on James Dobson's Focus on the Family radio show, Dobson
said. "All I can say is praise God," Carkhuff said. "I trusted in God and I feel vindicated."

<B>An AIDS-prevention program that employs voodoo priests to teach Haitians to wear condoms

Development, trains voodoo leaders to give contraception instruction, according to the New
York Times News Service. "They are, to me, religious leaders, the same as Protestant
pastors," said Eddy Genece, head of the Haiti office of AIDSCAP. Since believers in voodoo
don't see sex outside marriage as wrong, they are free to teach the people to use condoms,
unlike the Catholic Church and most Protestant churches in the country. The program is
supposed to help halt the spread of AIDS. About 15,000 voodoo leaders have been trained so
far. Many of the priests claim they can treat AIDS-related diseases by using the pit of a fruit
to attract healing spirits. But some voodoo rituals, such as the practice of making small cuts
on a sick person's body, may spread the disease. Some Haitians believe AIDS can be spread
by giving someone "the evil eye." NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Priests are murdered, churches riddled by gunfire, and bodies left in front of churches in the

dozen priests, mostly in Palermo, are preaching against the Cosa Nostra, organizing
demonstrations, and publishing anti-Mafia newsletters, news reports said. They also are trying
to provide alternatives to criminal life through education and greater economic opportunity.  
<BR><B>...The priests represent a threat to the criminal organization because they are "removing the
moral consensus of the people toward the Mafia," Jesuit priest Bartolemo Sorge said</B>. In a
country that long has accepted the ways of the mafioso, and where politicians, even clergy,
are associated with such activities, this is a dangerous enterprise. In 1993, Giuseppe Puglisi
was killed after he increased his anti-mafia preaching. Puglisi had been inspired by Pope John
Paul II's denunciation of the mafia. But instead of deterring other priests, Puglisi's murder
forced them to examine their consciences, and more began to speak, Cosimo Scordato, a local
rector, said.

<B>A group trying to bridge differences between people on different sides of the abortion debate
is promoting adoption as an alternative</B>. The Common Ground Network for Life and Choice
(NIRR 4/4/94), a loose-knit group organized in 1992, is active in about 20 cities. The network
is urging governments to encourage wider acceptance of adoption and shift some family
planning funding to programs that focus on adoption. The group also urged that the
foster-care system be streamlined so children can be placed in permanent homes more
quickly. Common Ground organizers are Andrew Puzder, who wrote Missouri's restrictions
on abortion, and B.J. Isaacson-Jones, former executive director of a St. Louis family-planning
clinic that sued to overturn the restrictions. In 1989, the suit resulted in the Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services decision, in which the high court allowed states to place
restrictions on abortion. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Kneeling, praying, and holding hands, five Baptist missionaries prepared to die in a
wild-game park in Tanzania (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21</A>)</B>. "I thought I was holding my wife's hand for the
last time," David Moreland told Baptist Press. A Bible verse from the book of Romans ran
through Sandy Harrington's head: "Nothing can separate us from the love of Christ -- not
even death." Ten-year-old Joanna Giddens said: "I wasn't scared
<BR><B>...because I knew that with God everything would be all right." As their kidnappers argued
whether to shoot them together or separately, the missionaries began to pray out loud</B>. 
<BR><B>..."Are you a padre?" a gunman asked Moreland</B>. When he replied that he was a Southern
Baptist missionary, the men ordered them to lie on a blanket and drink an orange liquid.
Moreland "felt like shouting" for joy upon seeing the juice, knowing that sometimes
kidnappers drug people instead of killing them, he said. Surviving the night without attack
from wild animals that roam the park, the missionaries awoke 18 hours later to the sound of
the search plane that rescued them. Harrington said, "We could be dead -- and God still
would be great, but He intervened, and I'm very grateful to Him." NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Archbishop Geron Iakovos, 84, who has led the Greek Orthodox Church in the Western
Hemisphere since 1959, will retire next July, church officials said</B>. The former president of
the World Council of Churches was an early supporter of the civil rights movement and has
worked for Christian unity. In 1959, Iakovos became the first Greek Orthodox emissary in
more than 400 years to meet with a Roman Catholic pope, John XXIII.
<P>
<B>Episcopal Bishop Clarence Pope has reversed his conversion to Catholicism (NIRR 11/14/94)</B>.
Less than a year ago, Pope became the first Episcopal bishop in a century to become a
Catholic. The retired Fort Worth, Texas, bishop left the Episcopal Church over his opposition
to the ordination of women. He reconverted partly because of a requirement that he be
reordained as a Catholic priest. Pope said that would mean rejecting his previous ordination.
<P>
<B>Mickey Mantle accepted Jesus Christ shortly before he died, former New York Yankees
teammate Bobby Richardson said</B>. The hospitalized Mantle told Richardson, a lay preacher,
about his decision a few days before his death at age 63 last month, news reports said.
Richardson, who conducted the funeral service in Dallas, told mourners his longtime friend
had found spiritual peace and was now in "God's Hall of Fame."

<B>The Christian Coalition, made up mostly of Protestants, is forming a branch especially for
Catholics</B>. News reports said the Catholic Alliance will have a separate membership and
chapters in all 50 states, but will work with the coalition's state chapters on common
concerns. Regent University did not violate the contracts of three professors, a Virginia court
ruled. The judge declared the contracts did not constitute tenure and that the school had the
right to dismiss faculty regardless of reason. Regent, founded by Pat Robertson, did have the
obligation to compensate the faculty for the remainder of their three-year contracts.   A
California church gives its members a list of secular and religious leaders to pray for each
week. The Church on the Way, in Van Nuys, distributes Prayer, Praise and People Report
during its midweek service, the magazine Ministries Today said. The church sends copies of
the prayer guide each week to the leaders who are being prayed for. Many of them, including
Ted Turner, Dan Rather, and Ted Koppel, have written to express their thanks.
<P>
<B>Ministries that lost money in the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy scandal (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/072495.html">NIRR 7/24</A>)
are mistaken to focus donor attention on the situation since most donors are oblivious of it,
pollster George Barna said</B>. A survey by the Barna Research Group found only 18% of donors
knew anything about the situation. Spending "inordinate amounts" of time and money
discussing New Era "is likely to increase donor skepticism unnecessarily," Barna said.
<P>
<B>Police officers and firefighters meet monthly at Harvest Christian Fellowship in Riverside,
Calif., to worship, study the Bible, and encourage each other</B>. The Shield of Faith ministry
draws about 45 people to its monthly meetings. Spouses also participate because "they're the
ones who have to put up with these guys" and the anger and frustration their jobs sometimes
produce, according to Steve Ballinger, associate pastor. For information, call (909) 687-6902.

<B>Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests is increasing efforts to locate victims of clergy

states. For information about SNAP, call (312) 483-1059.

<B>FBI agents in Chicago arrested a former armored-car worker on suspicion of stealing
$260,000 from a bank in Waukegan, a suburb</B>. Federal prosecutors said Robert Cook, 33, was
planning to use the money to "end abortion by bombing abortion clinics and shooting people."
Agents said they found an AR-15 assault rifle and ammunition in a locker Cook rented. 
<P>
<B>A church's response to anti-Semitism has "tipped the scales back toward the good," a rabbi in
Phoenix said</B>. After graffiti was scrawled on Beth El Congregation's Holocaust memorial and
synagogue in July, pastor Mark Martin of Calvary Community Chapel wrote to Rabbi Richard
Sherwin expressing sorrow over the attack and enclosed a check to defray cleaning expenses.
The church also offered support in the event of future incidents. The church's response "far
outweigh(s) any threat we have faced or might face in the future," Sherwin said.

<B>Angola: Elias Augosto, a deacon and security guard for the Baptist Mission, knows the
biblical principle of "watch and pray," according to Baptist Press</B>. Because people in the city
of Luanda know missionaries have cars, food, and clothing, Augosto stands guard at night
with an AK-47 in one hand and a Bible in the other. He assumed the post in 1993 after gangs
looted one missionary's home and attacked another, attempting to shoot the lock off. Once,
when Augosto caught four men attempting to break into the compound, he shot above their
heads and all around them until they fled. "I didn't want to defile the compound by spilling
any blood," he said.

<B>Burundi: Unidentified gunmen killed a Hutu priest in Bujumbura, the capital</B>. Michael
Sinankwa was shot and his car was stolen immediately after he celebrated a mass, news
reports said. Several leaders have been targeted for assassination in the past several weeks,
according to Hutu leaders.
<P>
<B>Burundi: The Catholic Bishops of Burundi condemned warlords who recruit and arm
teen-agers to terrorize rival ethnic groups, news reports said</B>. "The search for power, the spirit
of vengeance, and the habit of violence" mark the strife between Hutu and Tutsi tribes, their
letter said. According to an Italian Catholic newspaper, the Church, especially Hutu priests
and nuns, have been targeted by the Tutsi-controlled military. 
<P>
<B>Morocco: Four Christians who were tried last month for proselytizing have been released</B>.
One, Mehdi Ksara, 88, is a citizen of the United States and Morocco.  His arrest and
imprisonment gained international attention because of his age and the conditions he was held
in, Baptist Press said. Although Moroccan law forbids detention of anyone over 75 years old,
Ksara, who is in poor health, was kept in a cramped prison. Sources disagreed whether the
case signals a new tolerance or a crackdown on religious freedom.   
<P>
<B>South Africa: Religious and conservative groups condemned proposed legislation legalizing
abortion on demand during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy</B>. Current law allows for abortion
only if the woman proves she was the victim of rape or incest, if the fetus is deformed, or if
giving birth threatens the mother's physical or emotional health. The law would result in a
clash between the African National Congress, which officially supports abortion rights, and
the strong conservative community in South Africa, news reports said. The ANC, which
downplayed the issue during last year's elections, could split over the issue.
<P>
<B>Uganda: The Lord's Resistance Army, reportedly a band of Christian fundamentalist rebels,
attacked and ransacked the northern village of Ocettoki (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21</A>)</B>. Hundreds of people fled
the area and the LRA took 30 villagers, property, and livestock, news accounts said. The
group attacked another village in April, killing 250 people. The LRA wants to overthrow the
government and rule the country by the Ten Commandments, reports said.

<B>Zaire: More than 30,000 nationals and Rwandan refugees indicated a decision to believe in
Christ, The Jesus Film Project said</B>. The film has been shown 331 times to more than 230,000

<P>
<B>Zaire: The vision of an Australian missionary prompted four Rwandans, one a pastor, to
return to their country, news reports said</B>. Helene Theatre described her vision of a "miracle
repatriation" throughout the Kibumba refugee camp on the Rwanda-Zaire border. She said she
saw thousands of Rwandans returning home to their country in September. Rwandan priests at
the camp, which houses 220,000 Hutus, supported the vision by holding prayer meetings.
Many more people will have to be touched before it turns into a real movement, U.N. relief
worker Peter Kessler said.

<B>India: The government has begun paying salaries to Muslim prayer leaders, according to
Prime Minister P.V</B>. Narashimba Rao. The All India Imam Organization asked the country's
Supreme Court to remunerate the holy men for their services because they are humiliated by
their low pay. Opposition parties decried the decision.
<P>
<B>Israel: Ten Jews were arrested and escorted from the Temple Mount, a holy shrine for Jews
and Muslims (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21</A>)</B>. They were wearing prayer shawls and skull caps, even though it is
illegal for Jews to pray at the site. About 20 Palestinians began scuffling and throwing stones
at them. The Jews are members of Chai V'Kayam, a group that wants to expel all Arabs from
Israel and the occupied territories. The group periodically attempts to pray at the Temple
Mount. 
<P>
<B>Philippines: Legislators called for a ban on the American heavy-metal group Slayer, saying its
lyrics are blasphemous, news reports said</B>. Vincente Sotto, assistant majority leader of the
Senate, said the lyrics "death to God" and "God is dead" should not be sold or aired. 
<P>
<B>South Korea: Some 22,400 female babies are aborted every year, the Union of Catholic Asian
News said</B>. Since male children are preferred, some parents have female fetuses killed after
gender tests. Catholic bishops expressed concern over the issue and a local church condemned
the "culture of death."
<P>
<B>South Korea: A Presbyterian leader visited North Korea to discuss religious cooperation
between the two countries</B>. Kwak Sun-hee, pastor of Somang Presbyterian Church in Seoul, is
reportedly the first South Korean minister to visit for religious reasons since 1993.
<P>
<B>Thailand: Prime Minister Banharn Silparcha puts his faith in astrology and fortune-tellers,
adjusting appointments and scheduling to coincide with astrologers' advice</B>. Upon his
appointment as prime minister, Silparcha made a motorcade circle his house once because it
came earlier than the "auspicious time," according to news reports. At his first cabinet
meeting, Silparcha kept the ministers waiting for two hours so he would enter the building at
the most "auspicious time." He also had a carved elephant removed from a lounge in the
Finance Ministry because his fortune-teller told him it was stronger than he was.

has spread across the border</B>. A wing of the Social Democratic Party said it will challenge the
49-year-old law requiring crucifixes to be hung in school classrooms. The practice also is
guaranteed by an agreement between Austria and the Vatican, news reports said. Scholars say
the law may be reversed because religious neutrality is guaranteed in the constitution.
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said there is no reason to change the law because it "hasn't
bothered anyone for decades."

more than 250 concerts, encouraging their audiences to support the Chernobyl outreach.

<B>England: Driving under the influence of the Holy Spirit can be hazardous to your health, a
Christian physician said</B>. Church leaders should make sure that members who experience
Toronto Blessing manifestations, such as laughing and falling down (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/080795.html">NIRR 8/7</A>), are sober
enough to drive home. The mental state induced by such experiences is similar to
drunkenness, Patrick Dixon, a medical doctor, told the Anglican Journal.
<P>
<B>England: After allegations of sexual misconduct, an Anglican priest has been barred from
preaching, news reports said</B>. Chris Brain, a rock 'n' roll manager who became an evangelical
priest, had improper sexual relationships with about 20 women, he admitted. Brain, leader of
an unorthodox group in Sheffield, incorporated rock music and videos in his ministry. The
allegations came out after the evangelical group was brought under diocesan control.
<P>
<B>England: Restrictions on doing business on Sundays have been loosened over the past year</B>.
Traditionally days of rest for British workers, Sundays are becoming just another day of
business, according to news reports. The latest change allows pubs to stay open all day, rather
than closing between 3 and 7 p.m. The pre-World War I laws had required even clothing and
food stores to close. 
<P>
<B>Russia: More than 300 North American Christians accompanied Josh McDowell on his
Mission to Russia '95 (NIRR 10/31/94)</B>. The group distributed 500,000 books and booklets,
including McDowell's More Than a Carpenter, in Moscow and other cities Aug. 4-14. The
group also distributed children's literature and care packages with toothbrushes and
toothpaste, spokesperson Kim Twitchell told NIRR. Some people who go on the yearly trips
are moved to take mission trips back to the country, she said.
<P>
<B>Russia: Moscow's Cathedral of Christ Our Savior held services for the first time in 64 years
last month</B>. The cathedral, once the spiritual center of the Russian Orthodox Church and the
largest church in the country, was ordered destroyed by Josef Stalin in 1931. Still under
reconstruction, it is a symbol of Russia's rebirth, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said. Some
believe the site is cursed because a convent was destroyed to build the cathedral in 1837.
Others criticize the cost of rebuilding the church, estimated at $250 million, while the Russian
economy is struggling to recover from communism, news reports said.

Nearly 4,000 of the world's evangelical leaders have pledged to aggressively take on new
challenges and opportunities to evangelize mankind. The leaders, meeting May 17-25 in
Seoul, South Korea, at the Global Consultation On World Evangelism '95, affirmed the
ambitious goal of establishing a church-planting movement among every people group in the
world by the turn of the century (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29</A>).  
<BR>...The massive scope of the task energized and unified delegates. "We came together around a
vision created in us by the command of Christ to make disciples of all nations," said Robert
Coleman of Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, reading from the conference declaration.
"This is the time for which we were born." As he read the declaration, Coleman began to
tremble with emotion, and the entire gathering "went wild" in a spontaneous response to the
contents, AD 2000 & Beyond Movement International Director Luis Bush told NIRR. 
<BR>...Brokenness, repentance, and reconciliation characterized the conference, Bush said. In the
plenary and working sessions, and in the prayer rooms, delegates from the 186 countries and
numerous denominations repented of sins and reconciled profound differences. Arab and
Jewish Christians repented of the hatred between their peoples, and embraced each other.
Delegates from Turkey and Armenia did the same. Japanese evangelist Paul Ariga knelt on
stage and asked forgiveness for World War II crimes against other Southeast Asians. Russian
Orthodox Bishop Christopher Tcamalaidze of Tbilisi, Georgia, asked forgiveness for his
church's persecution of evangelicals. "It was a miracle," said Thomas Wang, AD 2000's
international chairman of the board. "When things like that happen, you know it is a work of
the Holy Spirit." 
<BR>...Denominational leaders confessed their failure to work together and pledged more
cooperation in reaching GCOWE '95's goal. Leaders from the Southern Baptist Convention's
Foreign Missions Board pledged to share its research on 10,500 unreached people groups.
"We realized we can not do it by ourselves," Avery Willis of the board told NIRR. Other
leaders confessed to acting unilaterally, and promised to work together. 
<BR>...During the conference's 17 track sessions, leaders shared ideas for evangelizing people
groups, nations, regions, and continents. The priority is to plant at least one church for each
of the 2,300 unreached people groups in the 10/40 Window, Bush said. Leaders formed a
five-year evangelization schedule for churches and ministries, Wang said. Track sessions
became times for exchanging information and "rejoicing in what others were doing," said
Robert Bakke of the Evangelical Free Church of America. So much networking took place
that "it made the stock market look tame," Baptist Press said. NIRR 6/12/95

Six million Christians marched, sang, praised God, and prayed in the streets of 2,190 cities in
75 nations during the annual March for Jesus (NIRR 6/27/94). In Sao Paulo, Brazil, an
estimated 1.5 million people marched in April. In Guatemala, the number was 80,000, double
that of last year, organizers said. Thirty thousand marched in Papau New Guinea. In Burundi,
members of the opposing Hutu and Tutsi tribes marched side-by-side carrying banners
reading, "No Divisions in Jesus." In Canada, 90 marches drew 115,000 people. In Japan,
where people are "in the midst of darkness and insecurity" because of cultic terrorist attacks,
the march revealed "the differences between Christians, who live by the love of Christ," and
cultists, the coordinator said. 
<BR>...About 1 million believers marched in the streets of 600 U.S. cities. Most U.S. celebrations
took place May 27, but some were held on other days due to Memorial Day weekend. In
Atlanta, 87 people received Christ as more than 20,000 people marched. In Nashville, 40,000
marchers were led by a drum corps, community choir, 100 dancers, and hundreds of flags and
banners. Columbus, Ohio, had 20,000 marchers; Toledo, Ohio, 17,000; and Spokane, Wash.,
15,000. In Hilo, Hawaii, people came out of bars and wept as marchers passed, organizers
said. About 9,000 people marched in Oklahoma City, and a pastor whose church was across
the street from the site of the bombing spoke of "how the tragedy was being turned to glory
by the Lord." In Sioux Falls, S.D., a Satanist who came to Christ during the march two years
ago held a banner and led this year's march. In Ceres, Calif., young children led the march;
they wore white robes and waved palm branches. "Jesus was the glue that bound us together,"
said pastor David Nanod, march organizer in Kaukanakai, Hawaii. Marches are planned for
each year through the year 2000. NIRR 6/12/95

A May 26-27 Promise Keepers rally at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., drew 50,440 men
for 13  hours of spirited preaching, singing, and praying. Some 4,000 responded to evangelist
Luis Palau's altar call. Speakers challenged and inspired the crowd, and a men's band led the
mix of gospel, traditional, and salsa music. Men prayed together in clusters, and many wiped
tears from their eyes. At one point, thousands of pastors assembled in front of the stage and
up the aisles. Some wept as the crowd pronounced a blessing over them and let loose with a
thunderous, sustained ovation to encourage them. 
<BR>...Bill McCartney confessed to the crowd that for many years he had selfishly neglected the
needs of his wife, Lyndi, while obsessed with coaching football at the University of Colorado
and then with founding and running Promise Keepers. McCartney said he has repented,
received his wife's forgiveness, and dedicated himself to serving others. 
<BR>...Promise Keepers continues to pack stadiums (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/051595.html">NIRR 5/15</A>). The seven-point message at each
conference this summer is that "men of integrity" honor Jesus Christ; have close male friends;
practice spiritual, moral, and sexual purity; are faithful to wife and children; support the
church; defy racial and denominational barriers; and encourage the world to do the same.  
<BR>...PK attendance has grown from 4,200 men in 1991 to an expected 700,000 at 13 gatherings
this year. The staff and budget have doubled every six months for the last four years to $22
million yearly with 175 national staffers, seven state offices, and 11,000 local volunteers or
"point men," organizers said.  PK plans a rally of 1 million men on the Mall in Washington,
D.C., in 1997; the date was moved back from 1995 to avoid the appearance of political intent
in an election year. Also, the National Clergy Conference, a PK rally for 75,000 pastors at the
Georgia Dome in Atlanta, is set for Feb. 13-15, 1995. Scholarships for the pastors' conference

Contemporary outreach events attracted 5,000 parents, youth, business and community
leaders, and singles during an April weekend in Hagerstown, Md. The interdenominational
effort among local churches, radio station WCRH, and New Jersey author, speaker, and radio

Revival services in Melbourne, Fla., still are going strong (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/040395.html">NIRR 4/3</A>). Services started Jan. 1.
Since early April, 15,000 people have attended meetings held six days a week at the
1,000-seat Tabernacle Church, founded by the late Jamie Buckingham. Since then, about 200
people have become Christians as a result of the services, according to local church leader
Fred Grewe. Various pastors and worship leaders take turns leading the services, which
include physical healings and spontaneous "holy laughter." 
<BR>..."Everybody is exhausted, but God is manifesting His presence every night -- so we are
reluctant to stop," Grewe told NIRR. Participants are taking their renewed spiritual energy
back to their churches, observers said.  
<BR>..."A deep fraternity has grown in our community," Grewe said. Pastors from diverse
denominations join in worship, share testimonies, and pray for renewal at one another's
churches. Some 40-80 pastors attend a weekly prayer meeting. Congregants enjoy "seeing all
the pastors come together more than they enjoy the manifestations of the Holy Spirit," Grewe
said. NIRR 6/12/95

"A major step in bringing unity" to Northern Ireland is how an evangelical leader described
the May 16-21 Luis Palau crusade in Londonderry (NIRR 11/4/94). Howard Lewis of the
Evangelical Alliance in Northern Ireland said the crusade brought together churches "we
never dreamt would work together" and delivered an element of healing to a community
fraught with religious and political discord. Catholics and Protestants worshiped together in a
3,000-seat tent-pavilion on the bank of the Foyle River, which divides Protestant and Catholic
communities. Some 18,000 people attended the five-day crusade, which included a youth rally
and a service for senior citizens, Palau's evangelistic association said. About 450 people
prayed to become Christians during the crusade. NIRR 6/12/95

Christians in Russia, long prevented under communism from using the media, are learning to
use radio as a ministry. Some 75 ministers and church planters studied radio production
methods and other skills in three seminars conducted by Trans World Radio, Russia
Ministries Executive Director Peter Deyneka told NIRR. Deyneka's ministry recruits students
and coordinates the sessions. Under communism, "some did not even know how to operate a
tape recorder," Deyneka said. Yet they recognized its usefulness for spreading the gospel.
"Pastors came to us and said, `How can we use radio?'" 
<BR>...About a dozen new programs, mostly containing preaching, are on the air as a result,
Deyneka said. This summer the two ministries are opening a media center in Moscow,
complete with recording facilities and a library of radio broadcasts. Another goal is to form
an association of religious broadcasters to exchange ideas, socialize, and be represented as a
unified group. NIRR 6/12/95

House Speaker Newt Gingrich's plan to use churches and other charities to compensate for
budget cuts to social services will put too large a strain on their resources, ministry
representatives say. To make up for the $60 billion in cuts proposed in the House-approved
Personal Responsibility Act alone, each of America's 350,000 churches would have to raise
an additional $190,000 over the next five years, Bread for the World said. But the typical
congregation has fewer than 100 members and the $60 billion figure represents nearly the
total giving for all religious groups and causes in a single year, according to various studies.
Gingrich has suggested that every church and synagogue in the country can adopt a homeless
person for six months. 
<BR>...Charities can meet only a fraction of the needs, their leaders say. Dismantling America's
welfare system and relying solely on charities and volunteers would cause "a disaster of a
large magnitude," Stephen Burger, executive director of the International Union of Gospel
Missions, told NIRR. For example, the budget at Seattle's Union Gospel Mission already is
stretched to its limits, Herb Pfiffner, executive director of the mission, told The New York
Times. Union receives no public funds, and Pfiffner is reluctant to do so because the mission
might be forced to abandon its religious message, he said. But cuts in government services
will lead to more competition for private money and great needs among the poor, he said.     
<BR>...Christian groups helping the poor have more long-term success than the government
because the gospel "changes lives," Pfiffner said. The nation's 250 rescue missions served
75,000 meals a day, provided 24,800 beds per night, and gave 13,700,000 articles of clothing
last year. NIRR 6/12/95

Fifty churches are helping rebuild the poorest neighborhood in New York City's Harlem
section. They formed a development corporation called Harlem Congregation for Community
Improvement, an organizer told NIRR. Since 1989, the group has overseen construction of
more than 1,500 housing units in the area's Bradhurst section. The group has spent close to
$200 million on the construction. Most of the money comes from foundation grants and the
city. 
<BR>...The average yearly income per family in Bradhurst is $6,019, according to an analysis of
census data by the Program for Applied Research at Queens College. One in four households
consists of married couples, one in three adults is employed or seeking work, and three of
four people live below the poverty level, the study showed. By comparison, the average
yearly family income in the richest community in New York, bounded by 5th and Park
Avenues and East 86th and 91st Streets on Manhattan's Upper East Side, is $301,209 -- or 50
times that in Bradhurst. NIRR 6/12/95

Ministry leaders, accountants, and lawyers are making headway in charting an honorable way
out of the mess created by The Foundation for New Era Philanthropy bankruptcy, according
to Paul Nelson, president of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability. Hundreds
of evangelical organizations, colleges, and churches stand to lose tens of millions of dollars in
the New Era pyramid scheme (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29</A>). About $200 million is owed to creditors against
about $30 million in assets, according to court records. 
<BR>...More than 100 groups, including some nonreligious charities, have joined the ECFA-created
United Response to New Era plan, Nelson said. The plan's intent is for affected groups to
conform voluntarily to bankruptcy provisions governing fraud cases, and avert the costs and
spectacle of litigation, he said. Nelson and other United Response leaders have met with the
bankruptcy trustee to fine-tune the unprecedented plan. The trustee reportedly is pushing all
creditors to become part of United Response. Creditors will meet formally for the first time
June 26 in Philadelphia. 
<BR>...A proposed agreement has been discussed with the bankruptcy trustee and other groups.
Charities that got more money from New Era "matching grants" than they lost in last month's
collapse would return the balance voluntarily, Nelson said. Charities that received less than
they had on deposit will be asked to give up their right to sue in exchange for the prospect of
receiving some of the money returned by other charities. A number of ministries have said
they will return funds, but it is not known how much money will be added to the assets,
Nelson said. The trustee would not initiate any litigation under the plan.  
<BR>..."It is likely that those in a negative cash position will remain so" once the proposal has
been accepted and the assets distributed, Nelson warned in a letter to United Response
members. The group will coordinate an effort for the evangelical community to help all
groups that may be harmed financially, he said. Some small ministries have been left in dire
straits by New Era's collapse, he told NIRR. 
<BR>...Almost 98% of major donors have less respect for the managerial skills of senior nonprofit
managers as a result of the New Era debacle, according to a survey by The Chronicle of
Philanthropy. And 74% said they planned to take a closer look at the groups they already
support. To avoid alienation, organizations must explain to their constituents what happened
and how, Nelson said. Charities that are candid with their donors will be more likely to
receive forgiveness and continued support, he added. NIRR 6/12/95

Croats, Serbs, and former Muslims worship together at the Church of the Good News in
Mostar, Bosnia, according to Agape, a relief organization based in Osijek, Croatia (NIRR
1/24/94). Some 200 people attend regular worship at the church, which was founded in 1985
and destroyed by artillery several years ago. "The building was gone and only a few people
left," Agape founder Peter Kuzmic told NIRR. But a couple from Agape took over the church
last year and have seen it grow as it assists those in need. Members are committed to doing
relief work and evangelism across Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kuzmic said.  
<BR>...Founded in 1991 to assist displaced Croats, Agape's ministry has spread throughout the
former Yugoslavia as the war creates more refugees. The ministry is "two-handed," Kuzmic
said: "With one hand we give them daily bread, and with the other hand we give them eternal
bread." In the last two years, Agape has fed 700,000 people, including 3,500 refugee families.
An additional 2,000 families receive clothing twice a month. The ministry also distributed
700,000 Scripture portions, but is careful to practice low-key evangelism. "We are dealing
with horrible pain. We have to be sensitive so as not to manipulate the Muslims who are
victims here," Kuzmic said. NIRR 6/12/95

Pope John Paul II said he is willing to seek agreement with other denominations on the future
role of the papacy. In his 115-page encyclical appealing for Christian unity last month (NIRR
5/15), he said that in the early church the papacy acted as a "moderator" to resolve
disagreements and preserve unity. The 75-year-old pontiff said he feels a "particular" personal
responsibility to make unity happen. He appealed to leaders and theologians of other
denominations to enter into "patient" dialogue with him. However, the pope made it clear he
would not accept a symbolic papacy lacking authority to issue infallible declarations regarding
the faith. And he insisted that the papacy must be based in Rome because Peter died there.
Catholics consider Peter the first pope. 
<BR>...Prominent Catholic theologian Hans Kung denounced the encyclical and said the pope
himself is the greatest obstacle to unity. The Swiss-born Kung, who teaches at the German
University of Tubingen, berated the pontiff for not relinquishing power. Instead, John Paul
wants unity totally on Roman terms, Kung said. The encyclical should have taken initiatives
such as rescinding the excommunication of Martin Luther and other Reformation leaders, and
recognizing the validity of Protestant clergy and religious services, he said. NIRR 6/12/95

Members of Assemblies of God and Southern Baptist churches give the most per capita,
according to a survey commissioned by the Lilly Endowment. The survey, described as the
most far-reaching of its kind, studied 625 congregations, 125 in each of five major church
bodies, across the nine census regions of the country. The other three churches surveyed: the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (USA), and the Catholic
Church. 
<BR>...Church size is not a big factor in giving, the study found. Also, feelings of alienation from
denominational leadership or from denominational moral teachings are statistically
insignificant. The study found that people in conservative Protestant churches give more:
People who tithe and those who plan their giving with pledges or other commitments give
more than others. Giving varies by age and marital status. Those between 45 and 65 and
those who are married and whose spouses attend the same church give the most.

American Muslim Council, and the Church of Scientology.

unconstitutional (NIRR 4/3/95), the coalition argued in a brief filed with the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Bunton said RFRA intruded on the power of the
courts. The coalition said Congress passed the act to enforce a constitutional right, not to
usurp judicial power. 
<BR>...The case involves a Catholic church in Boerne, Texas, that wanted to demolish part of its

accommodate religious practices in the workplace unless doing so imposes "undue hardship."

Cuba abruptly changed its policy toward house churches. The government closed at least 81
house churches in the last month and jailed a pastor, sources reported. Authorities sentenced
Orson Vila, an Assemblies of God pastor and presbyter of the AG churches in the Camaguey
area, to 18 months in prison after he refused to close his house church. Vila told local
authorities that they could close the church, but that he could not "turn his back on the flock
and tell the people not to come back," Barbara Cusack, a Cuban-American who spoke with
Vila's wife, told NIRR. More than 1,000 Christians sang and praised God outside the
courthouse during Vila's trial May 24, she said.  
<BR>...Vila "is like a Billy Graham," Cusack said. He attracts many people and "God uses him
mightily," she said. He was arrested in 1981 for holding a revival that attracted thousands, an
AG official who knows Vila told NIRR. The pastor reportedly is in good condition. Local
leaders are appealing on his behalf. 
<BR>...House churches in other denominations are being closed as well, Cusack said. They are seen
as a threat because they are growing fast and refusing to join the government-controlled
Ecumenical Council, according to the AG official who requested anonymity. The AG has
formed more than 800 house churches since they were legalized in 1992, he said. As more
people become Christians, they spend Sundays worshiping rather than meeting with their local
militia groups or attending Communist Party meetings, Cusack said. "In a system that thrives
on control, this is out of control."

The proposal, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, calls for

Pennsylvania doctors who perform abortions may lose their licenses if they only play taped
messages for their clients to fulfill the informed-consent requirement of state law. A state
official warned that the law requires one-on-one consultations. Tapes are being used in other
states with similar laws, lawyers for pro-choice groups said.

St. Vibiana's Cathedral, the 119-year-old seat of the Catholic archdiocese of Los Angeles, has
been ordered closed. The 1994 Northridge earthquake damaged the cathedral, and another
tremor could topple its belltower into the sanctuary, Cardinal Roger Mahony said. Engineers
concluded it would cost more to repair the church than build a new one. Plans call for a new
$45 million complex.

People with weak immune systems should be aware of the health risk when they share a

About 100 Operation Rescue California demonstrators clashed with about 300 abortion-rights

Charismatic renewal services moved into their 11th week in Pasadena, Calif. Meetings at John

Elementary school children in Lubbock, Texas, can earn a pair of expensive athletic shoes for
being an outstanding student, athlete, or citizen. Messiah Presbyterian Church spearheads the
program "P.S. -- Go For It." The goal is to induce impoverished students to shun the activities
some resort to in order to afford the coveted shoes: selling drugs, stealing, or assaulting
others. Students win a certificate redeemable at local sporting goods stores for any pair of
shoes they want. The school's principal and staff assist the church in conducting the program.

Public school history textbooks have expanded and improved their treatment of religion in the
last decade, a report of the independent American Textbook Council said. But many social
studies and health-class texts show an indifference to traditional Judeo-Christian standards of
virtue. The materials substitute "new and shapeless moral credos" for those values, it said.

Volunteers help poor families in Minneapolis complete high school, find jobs, or improve
parenting skills. Each family in Project Break-Through, run by The Salvation Army, meets
with a social worker and attends a monthly support group to develop new skills and learn
about resources. A family therapist, financial planner, and attorney also volunteer services.
When families graduate from the program, they can attend support groups and meet
periodically with social workers.

Germany: Reinhard Bonnke is pursuing an ambitious plan to send gospel literature to every
household throughout German-speaking Europe. Millions of full-color, gold-embossed
magazines titled Plus to Minus will be mailed to every home in Germany, Austria, and parts
of Switzerland this September, a spokesman said. The magazine explains the gospel message
and provides a card to be filled out and returned to Bonnke's headquarters so respondents can
be matched with the nearest local church. Twenty-five million mailers were sent to England
last year and some 60,000 people have responded. About 1,400 churches in Germany will
serve in a follow-up capacity after the mailings.

Switzerland: Popular Catholic Bishop Hansjoerg Vogel, 44, of Basel, resigned after disclosing
he got a woman pregnant. "I know that my failings will disappoint many believers," he said
in a statement. "They had expectations of me which I couldn't fulfill." New mistrust will arise
over whether priests can carry out their commitment to celibacy, he acknowledged. He said
he is convinced that a "fulfilled life" is possible in celibacy. A poll of Swiss Catholics found
that more than two-thirds think Vogel should be allowed to remain in his post. Also, 84%
favor ending celibacy, the survey showed.

College students on summer vacation are spreading news of their campus revivals 
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/051595.html">NIRR 5/15</A>) and are looking with hope toward the fall. Of the thousands of Christian students who
repented and publicly confessed deep personal sins this spring, many are testifying in local
churches, at Christian camps, and in smaller settings about their changed lives. 
<BR>...Some have told their stories to the media. Wheaton College professor Lyle Dorsett and
recent Howard Payne University graduate James Hahn taped a Donahue show, which is
expected to be aired this summer. Hahn credited "much prayer cover" for allowing the two
Christians to present the gospel clearly during their interview. Television talk-show host Phil
Donahue was "very respectful," he told NIRR. 
<BR>...The revival already has impacted churches across the country, although their number is
difficult to quantify. Hahn is traveling wherever God leads him to talk about the revival, he
said. He and fellow HPU graduate Shelly Southerland have spoken at 20 churches of various
denominations across Alabama, Tennessee, and Florida. "Incredible things have happened" as
family members tearfully reconcile long-standing disagreements, husbands repent of failure to
assume spiritual leadership, and wives confess bitterness and anger, Hahn said.  
<BR>..."I believe the best is yet to come," John Avant, pastor of Coggin Avenue Baptist Church in
Brownwood, Texas, told NIRR. "There is no sign of letup" in the hunger for revival on
college campuses, said Avant, who pastors a number of students from Howard Payne, where
the revival began. Gary Stratton, dean of the chapel at Gordon College in Wenham, Mass.,
said students at other colleges are praying for a similar touch from God. In Santa Barbara,
Calif., Westmont College students were "weeping and crying out to God" recently when
Stratton described his school's revival, he told NIRR. Matt Yarrington, a student leader at
Wheaton, said that when revival meetings ended this spring, "the fervor was never dimmed
and only increased." Many students "may still be hungry for this kind of movement," he said.
Yarrington was one of the students from several schools who spent much of the spring
visiting other campuses to describe their experiences. At almost every college they visited -including the Ivy League's Yale University in New Haven, Conn., Dartmouth College in
Hanover, N.H., and Columbia University in New York City -- similar events occurred, he
said. The revival has touched at least 50 colleges, some leaders estimate; others say the
number is much higher.  
<BR>...However, "a couple of days of meetings does not an awakening make," Stratton said. "I'm
looking to see a movement of God's Spirit grow and touch millions of students," said
Stratton, who fasted and prayed for 40 days prior to the spiritual outbreak at Gordon this
spring. Last spring's revival -- some say it is more accurately called a renewal -- may have
been "God's warning shot across the bow to say `get ready,'" Stratton said. "A very small
percentage of the church is prepared" to handle the influx of new believers if wide-scale
revival does occur, he said. Prayer, clear teaching, and "genuine, biblical discipleship" are
necessary to sustain the blessings, Stratton said. The history of revivals is filled with stories
of people "deeply and profoundly touched, but never brought into discipleship."  
<BR>...Students continue to mature spiritually, leaders say. Speaking at their home churches helps
students "process what is significant for them," according to Kevin Engle of Wheaton's Office
of Christian Outreach. Many students say they are learning to "keep shorter accounts with the
Lord -- getting right with God every day instead of waiting for a big annual audit," he said.
Students also say they have a new desire to be more vocal about sharing their faith. Many
expressed regret over failing to share Christ with unsaved family members. Some students
have "just melted in a puddle of tears of remorse over not sharing," Engle said. 
<BR>...Other students have begun to fast, some as long as 40 days, Engle said. Last spring,
Wheaton students snapped up 680 copies of Bill Bright's book on fasting as a key to revival.
The Campus Crusade founder had contributed the books with the stipulation that students read
them over the summer. Wheaton officials even have discussed making special financial
arrangements for students who will be fasting in the fall rather than eating in the school's
cafeteria. 
<BR>...College leaders and students are planning a three-day conference to fast, pray, and plan
strategy concerning the campus revival. For information on Where Do We Go From Here,
call Stratton at (508) 927-2300, ext. 4215. NIRR 07/10/95

A church in which 95% of the members once were on welfare and food stamps has become a
model of economic success and spiritual hope. In 1977, the 200 members of Christ Temple
Church in Meridian, Miss., took stock of themselves and their impoverished situation. Many
had a long history of running up credit at the general store and faced a future of owing more
than they made. Bishop Luke Edwards, pastor of the Pentecostal church, was getting tired of
congregants "shouting all over the church on Sunday, then going back home just as broke as
those who never came to church at all." 
<BR>...The congregants pooled their resources and bought peanuts in 50-pound sacks, then resold
them for 25 cents a bag on the streets and in the stockyards. In four months, the church had
enough money to make a down payment on the purchase of a supermarket. Eventually, the
congregation formed a nonprofit organization that added numerous other enterprises over the
years. The businesses now include three motels, a gas station, three restaurants, two chicken
farms and 3,000 acres, a 54-acre housing development, a construction company, 1,000 cattle,
a hog operation with 300 brood sows, two meat-processing plants, a K-12 school with
dormitories, an auto dealership, and an auto repair and parts shop. Members of the church
work in the businesses, which employ a number of other people. Today, no one in the
congregation receives welfare or food stamps and everyone is employed. 
<BR>..."Welfare is a disease that made us invalids," Edwards, the son of a sharecropper, told
NIRR. Government has allowed blacks to be entrapped, he said. The church falls short, too,
by overspiritualizing Christianity while overlooking people's physical needs, Edwards said.
Success has turned Edwards' congregants into "completely different persons." They no longer
are "standing around," but are "part of the American Dream, part of this country, the greatest
country in the world. They are proud and happy." NIRR 07/10/95

Churches in Modesto, Calif., and surrounding areas have grown significantly in membership
as a result of the so-called Miracle in Modesto (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6</A>). Some 33,000 people committed
their lives to Christ early this year during Reality Outreach Ministries' fire-and-brimstone play
Heaven's Gates and Hell's Flames. Although "not all those people connected" with one of the
250 churches that divided names and addresses of the new converts, many area congregations
did grow as a result of the play, said Glen Berteau, pastor of Calvary Temple Worship
Center, the Assemblies of God church where the play was staged. 
<BR>...The influx of new members has brought changes to the churches. The new believers, some
of whom come from lower-income backgrounds, have a vibrant faith and yearn to grow in
Christ, Berteau told NIRR. "The person saved from much loves much. They're so
appreciative." The play also revitalized the faith of older believers. "People realize God
visited. They'll never be the same again," he said. "People have a tendency to go back to the
way it used to be -- I won't allow that." 
<BR>...Calvary Temple, which reluctantly halted production of the play after 28 performances to
allow time to assimilate new believers, plans to stage it again next February. A group of 50
Santa Maria, Calif., area churches will cooperate to stage the play beginning next month for
an indeterminate amount of time; Berteau met with the churches to help them plan their
performances. 
<BR>...Although Modesto's production of Heaven's Gates and Hell's Flames is the largest in the
play's 16-year history, there have been a few other large-scale successes, and many on a
smaller scale. Last year, 18,000 people came to Christ in response to the play at the Bethany
World Prayer Center in Baker, La., according to Frank Pauls of Reality Outreach Ministries.
Last year alone, some 136,000 people became Christians as a result of watching the play,
Pauls said. The ministry subsequently has stopped counting decisions for Christ because "that
sounds like bragging," he told NIRR. Response to the play is particularly striking for an
amateur production, many say. "It's the simple gospel," Pauls said. "That's all we preach:
heaven and hell." 
<BR>...With headquarters in St. Catherine's, Ontario, Canada, the ministry sends out
husband-and-wife teams that train members of local churches to act in the roles. Eighteen
such teams are active in North America and four in Europe. The ministry supplies team
members with a "very modest salary" and a 34-foot motor home for equipment. For more
information about the play, contact Reality Outreach Ministries at (905) 641-2114.

Two hundred "heroes of communism" in Minsk, Belarus, heard the gospel when Baptist
preacher John Avant and a group from his Texas church visited in May, he told NIRR. The
retired Communist Party members questioned the Christians about the theory of evolution and
were "astounded there was any other position," Avant said. Although two people angrily left
the meeting, about 150 accepted Christ, he said. One of the men who prayed to become a
Christian, an adviser to high government officials during communism, asked if he could be
forgiven for killing people. During a later trip to a military base, the group reported 750
soldiers converted to Christ. 
<BR>...A church is being built on the site of a Nazi death camp in the Minsk suburb of Shabaniy.
About 2.5 million people -- more than 25% of the population of Belarus -- died there during
Nazi occupation in World War II, Avant said. When anything is built in Shabaniy "they have
to relocate the bones," he said. The church's founder is a former member of parliament who
became a destitute alcoholic before turning to Christ. People wait in line more than two hours
to attend the service at a theater where the church meets, Avant said. NIRR 07/10/95

Pastors and church leaders will try to train 500,000 Christian workers by the year 2010. The
10-year plan, beginning in 2001, would be accomplished by 5,000 pastors who train 10
pastors a year for 10 years, evangelist Ramesh Richard told NIRR. 
<BR>...The need for trained leaders is great. Of the approximately 2 million pastor-evangelists
worldwide, only 5% are trained, Richard said during AD 2000 and Beyond's Global
Consultation on World Evangelism (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/062695.html">NIRR 6/26</A>). After AD 2000 completes its goal of
reaching every people-group with the gospel, pastors must be trained to nurture the new
congregations, Richard said. NIRR 07/10/95

Creditors and claimants involved in the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy  bankruptcy -many of them Christian groups -- elected a former federal appeals judge as permanent trustee
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/062695.html">NIRR 6/26</A>). He is Arlin Adams, 74, of Philadelphia, who is Jewish. Interim trustee John
Carroll III, a bankruptcy lawyer, said he might challenge the election. At stake, among other
things, is the trustee's fee, based on 3% of the assets over $1 million. New Era's assets are
about $31 million. Adams has indicated he will donate some of his services. 
<BR>...Their meeting was the first of creditors in the case. Carroll described New Era as a Ponzi
scheme, with "matching fund" grants to early participants paid for by deposits of later
participants. There were 163 "losers," 74 "winners," 11 who broke even, and 13 who had not
yet submitted figures, he reported. The net loss is $107 million, but may increase when all the
figures come in, he said.  
<BR>...Carroll indicated winners would have to return their money, either voluntarily or by court
action. Asked what will happen in instances where groups already have spent the money and
can't repay, he replied: "We haven't gone that far yet." He also held out hope that funds
placed in New Era by individual donors could be counted as donations and not be included as
debt. Distribution of the assets could begin by the end of the year, he predicted.                 
<P>
<BR>...Some 110 Christian nonprofits met the night before at a briefing chaired by federal Judge
Rollin Van Broekhoven, chairman of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability,
and Paul Nelson, ECFA president. The informal meeting was held under the auspices of
United Response to New Era, which ECFA aims to keep ministries informed and coordinate
strategy. The group agreed on the need to avoid litigation in resolving the case.

U.S. Air Force cargo planes are flying relief supplies -- some donated by Christian groups -around the world. MAP International, a Christian agency that transports medicine to needy
areas, is coordinating the efforts of various secular and religious relief groups. A late-1980s
law authorized military training flights to carry supplies rather than concrete blocks, which
formerly served as "cargo" on the trips. The practice was suspended during the Gulf War and
resumed only recently, Michael Nyenhuis, a spokesman for Brunswick, Ga.-based MAP, told

Pope John Paul II and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, spiritual leader of the world's
150 million Orthodox believers, signed a statement pledging to seek improved relations
between their churches (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/020695.html">NIRR 2/6</A>). "We believe that more concerted and active cooperation
will also facilitate the influence of the Church on peace and justice in the areas of political
and ethnic conflict," the statement said, apparently in reference to former Yugoslavia. 
<BR>...The signing followed a colorful mass at St. Peter's Basilica, where both leaders talked to
the congregation. Bartholomew condemned divisions among Christians as a threat to
humanity. The pope said the start of Christianity's third millennium represents a "great
challenge" for humanity and especially for Christians. "We cannot, therefore, remain
separated," he said. The mass ended a three-day visit by the patriarch, only the third Orthodox
leader to meet with a pope since the Great Schism of 1054. NIRR 07/10/95

Southern Baptists approved the most extensive organizational overhaul in SBC history.
Meeting June 20-22 at the 150th annual convention at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, delegates
merged the Home Mission Board in Atlanta, the Brotherhood Commission in Memphis,

American Mission Board, to be based in suburban Atlanta. In addition to approving a
resolution repenting of past racism (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/062695.html">NIRR 6/26</A>), SBC "messengers" called on Congress to
adopt a Constitutional Amendment to protect religious exercises, including voluntary prayer
and religious speech by public school students. They also gave a standing ovation to closing

Graham urged his listeners to become the kind of people God will use for the unfinished task

Mainline Protestantism is aging rapidly, and two denominational studies show little hope that
young adults will repopulate the pews. In the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), just 13% of
members are in the 18-to-34-year-old group, compared with 36% in the general population, a
study found. It also found that a third of Presbyterians are 65 or older, nearly double the
percentage of older Americans. In the United Methodist Church, a recent profile showed the
percentage of church members 50 and older has risen from 49% in 1986 to 61% in 1994. A
third of UMC members are 66 or older. NIRR 07/10/95

A delegation of conservatives who belong to mainline denominations will lobby for family
values at the United Nations World Conference on Women in Beijing in September.
Organizers are not confident that the official delegations from Presbyterian, Episcopal,
Methodist, and other churches "will represent the views of the vast majority of women in
these denominations," said Terry Schlossberg of the Ecumenical Coalition on Women and
Society. The Washington, D.C.-based Institute on Religion and Democracy organized ECWS.
Schlossberg also heads Presbyterians Pro-Life.  
<BR>...The U.N. plan that representatives from 175 nations will consider in Beijing attempts to
promote equal educational and employment opportunities, but ignores the role of the family,
IRD head Diane Knippers said. It is an "arrogant, intrusive, and comprehensive experiment in
social engineering and restructuring society." The ECWS will emphasize the family as the
essential "building block of society" and support "the fundamental rights of women, including
their religious rights," she added. NIRR 07/10/95

The U.S. Supreme Court acted in several religion-related cases as it cleared its docket for the
current term:
<BR>...The University of Virginia was wrong when it refused to subsidize a student-run religious
magazine while it gave money to other student publications, the court ruled. The school's
refusal was a denial of the right of free speech, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote. It "would
risk fostering a pervasive bias or hostility to religion," he added. At issue was the school's
rejection of a $5,800 subsidy request from student activity fees for Wide Awake (NIRR
11/14/94). Several evangelical students founded the magazine in 1990. Jay Sekulow of the
American Center for Law and Justice, who represented the students, called the 5-4 decision a
"major victory for religious freedom." He predicted the ruling will "energize other religious
liberty issues, including the government subsidizing of tuition vouchers for religious schools."
<BR>...Ohio made a mistake in trying to bar the Ku Klux Klan from displaying a cross in a public
park next to the state capitol in Columbus in December 1993 (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6</A>), the court said. The
park had been decorated during holiday seasons with a state-supplied Christmas tree and a
menorah. The Klan won the right to erect a 10-foot cross, but it was torn down by vandals. A
church then erected a similar cross, which remained in place. In the 7-2 decision, the justices
said the park was a public forum. "The court reaffirmed that the government may not pick
and choose what message private citizens can display in a public park," said Steven
McFarland, director of The Christian Legal Society's Center for Law and Religious Freedom. 
<P>
<BR>...The court side-stepped a dispute over graduation prayers at an Idaho public school (NIRR
11/28/94). At issue was a Grangeville High School policy that allows senior-class members to
vote whether to have a graduation prayer. Lower courts upheld the policy, but the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled it unconstitutional. The Supreme Court told the Circuit Court
to dismiss the suit as legally irrelevant since the students already have graduated; the high
court's action lifted the ban on student-led prayers in nine Western states. Advocates on both
sides of the church-state controversy said the Supreme Court's failure to give guidance in the
issue was a disappointment that will lead to further disputes. School officials around the
country are confused because federal courts have made conflicting rulings on graduation
prayers. 
<BR>...Religious groups for students may meet at school after hours. The court let stand a federal
appeals court decision against the Ladue, Mo., school district (NIRR 7/25/94). At issue was
whether school officials could bar a parent-led junior high Bible club from meeting there
although they permitted scout groups to meet. The appeals court said the school district's
1992 access policy amounted to "viewpoint discrimination" and a violation of religious
students' free-speech rights. Last November, the district banned all outside groups from using
school facilities between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. "This case is good news for religious student
groups everywhere," said Rutherford Institute attorney Tim Belz. NIRR 07/10/95

Television and newspaper ads run by the Christian Action Network during the 1992
presidential campaign were not subject to federal election laws. They did not "expressly
advocate" President Clinton's defeat, a federal judge ruled. The ads highlighted Clinton's
position on homosexual rights (NIRR 10/31/94). One ad showed a shouting man sporting a
T-shirt reading "Gay Father." A voice-over asked viewers if this was their vision of a better
America. 
<BR>...Corporations and groups that distribute ads supporting or opposing the election of
candidates must register with the Federal Election Commission as political action committees;
they are then subject to financial disclosure requirements. An FEC lawsuit against the Forest,
Va., policy group could have expanded the government's authority to restrict political speech,
observers said. "It's going to send a clear message to both parties" that they can't use the
FEC as a tool to censor conservative groups, CAN President Martin Mawyer said.

Wisconsin lawmakers made their state the first to give vouchers to impoverished parents so
they can send their children to private religious schools. They voted to expand a pilot
school-choice plan in Milwaukee to include sectarian schools. The 5-year-old plan now
involves 11 private schools and 800 voucher students. But under the expansion, up to 7,000
pupils could attend religious schools this fall, with an increase to 15,000 next year. Cost
estimates are $17 million and $39 million respectively, with the typical voucher worth about
$2,800. To qualify, students must come from a family whose income is at or below 175% of
the poverty level (about $26,000 for a family of four). Many of the city's 100 Catholic
schools are gearing up for participation in the program. Gov. Tommy Thompson said dropout
rates and low test scores in the public schools justify the experiment. NIRR 07/10/95

Cuban authorities are subjecting 81 house churches in Camaguey to review rather than
immediate closure (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12</A>), church officials said. When police arrested pastor Orson Vila
in May for refusing to close his church, government officials issued a declaration regarding
the other house churches in the region and began to scrutinize them more closely, an
Assemblies of God official in contact with the church there said. Ten churches have been
closed so far, he told NIRR. "It could be that the government is rescinding" its threat or that
eventually all the churches will be closed, the AG official said. Vila is in a work camp where

President Hosni Mubarak is "the lesser of two evils" for Christians in Egypt, Dan Darling of
the International Institute for the Study of Islam and Christianity told NIRR. Although
Mubarak permits some persecution, Christians officially are protected, according to the
I.I.S.I.C. Bulletin. However, they are relegated to second-class status and often denied
government permission to build churches. In addition, fundamentalist militias prevent them
from traveling to existing churches. The government often turns a blind eye to such
persecution to appease Islamic fundamentalists, the publication said.  
<BR>...The status of Christians "would change dramatically if Mubarak is ousted" and Egypt were
ruled by the Muslim fundamentalists who tried to kill him last month in Ethiopia, Darling
said. Radical Muslims wish to establish an Islamic state in Egypt, similar to those in Saudi
Arabia and parts of the Sudan. In those countries, believers are subject to arrest,
imprisonment, and death. Although it is not clear if Ethiopian Muslims were involved in the
assassination attempt, they "have a considerable voice" in their own government and warm
relations with Islamic groups in neighboring countries, Darling said. NIRR 07/10/95

Sex education in America is not working, researcher William Masters told a gathering of the
American Academy of Clinical Sexologists in Washington, D.C. Masters, 79, is a
gynecologist and co-author with his ex-wife Virginia Johnson of pioneering works on
sexuality. Masters challenged the therapists and educators to target adults in addition to
children so that knowledge can filter down. Other therapists agreed that change is needed.
They pointed out that the United States has one of the highest rates of teen pregnancy and
infant mortality in any industrialized society. After all these years, "we haven't had a drop in
the teen pregnancy rate," said academy President William Ganzig, a University of Florida
medical school professor. Even medical residents in their 30s and 40s ask basic questions

Homosexual couples may adopt a child under District of Columbia law as long as the

Some 25% of clergywomen and 20% of clergymen have been divorced at least once, a survey

approach to drug use. The denomination's general conference will study the report.
<P>
France: The National Assembly voted to exclude abortion protesters from an amnesty bill
proposed by the government. Such measures traditionally pardon petty lawbreakers following
presidential elections. Under this year's amnesty, about 1,500 people will be released from
jail, news accounts said. Lawmakers, however, barred pardons for people jailed for violent
attacks on abortion clinics. They said releasing such protesters would only encourage further
assaults on clinics.
<P>
Germany: Parliament passed a compromise measure that declares most abortions illegal but
permits it in the first trimester if a woman seeks counseling first. It also allows abortions in
cases of rape and physical danger to the prospective mother. The measure meshes the strict
law governing abortion in the former West Germany with the abortion-on-demand policy of
the former East Germany.
<P>
Greece: Two leaders and a "high priestess" of a satanic cult that conducted human sacrifices
on the outskirts of Athens were sentenced to life imprisonment. They were found guilty of
kidnapping, raping, and murdering a 30-year-old woman and a 15-year-old girl in occult
ceremonies. The three, all in their early 20s, confessed they led a 20-member satanic cult.
They testified that the devil was behind all the evils they performed. They also said they had
since turned to Christianity to seek cleansing and forgiveness. "Nonsense. Satanism was an
excuse to get sick sex and money," the detective who cracked the case said. 
<P>
Ireland: Shooting of the $14 million Marlon Brando comedy Divine Rapture was put on hold
after a Catholic bishop refused to allow filming in two churches. The movie was to have been
shot in the fishing village of Ballycotton. But John Magee, the bishop of Cloyne, said the
film ridiculed Catholicism. Producers defended the movie as a "sweet family comedy."
Brando plays a priest in the film, which also stars Debra Winger.
<P>
Romania: The first Mayor's Prayer Breakfast was held June 24 in Arad, Arlene Samuels of
Youth With A Mission said. Cristian Moisescu, the Christian mayor of the city, hosted 175
lay and clergy from most of the city's denominations. The breakfast was sponsored by
YWAM and Global Grace Ministries. Prayers were offered for the government, the economy,
the poor, and religious harmony. A highlight of the breakfast was a Catholic priest praying in
Romanian, English, and Hungarian.
<P>
Russia: An army general who credits God for saving his life during the Afghan war wants to
distribute 2.5 million Bibles among the country's soldiers, Charisma magazine reported. Slava
Borisov pleaded with God to spare his life when his helicopter was shot down in 1984.
Everyone aboard was killed but him. Now he heads the military chaplaincy and has helped
distribute more than 300,000 New Testaments with the help of Branson, Mo.-based Revival
Fire Ministries.

Gordon Hinckley, 84, a lifelong Mormon
Church administrator, was ordained as
the faith's 15th president. He replaces
Howard Hunter, 87, who died March 3
of prostate cancer.
<P>
Baylor University regents named Robert
Sloan, 46, as president of the Southern
Baptist-related school. He currently is
dean of Baylor's Truett Seminary.
<P>
Richard Droke, 58, top executive of the
United Methodist General Council on
Finance and Administration, announced
he will leave the agency when a replacement for him is found. Droke was sued
by former employee Craig Hoskins
(NIRR 9/19/94), who alleged he was fired
in retaliation for complaining about his
boss' "heavy consumption of alcohol" and
"inappropriate" conduct with female employees, United Methodist News Service
reported. Hoskins sued for $500,000 and
to get his job back. The case still is under litigation.
<P>
Former President Jimmy Carter disclosed that before the November elections he prayed that "people like" Newt
Gingrich and Oliver North would be defeated and Democrats would win. 
<P>
Michael Griffin, serving a life sentence
in prison for killing Dr. David Gunn outside a Pensacola, Fla., abortion clinic in
1993, said he no longer believes in violence as a way to oppose abortion (NIRR
8/8/94). His change of mind came from
praying and listening to tapes of verses
in Romans describing how Christians
should submit to government authority,
he told the Florida Times-Union.
<P>
University of Oregon quarterback Danny
O'Neill said his life has changed on and
off the field. "Football was my god," said
O'Neill, who captured Most Valuable
Player honors and six PAC-10 records in
the Rose Bowl. "Life was horrible and
empty -- until I found Jesus Christ," he
said. During the past two seasons,
O'Neill and his Christian teammates
prayed with opponents on the 50-yard
line after every game. He and teammates
Mark Slymen and Derrick Deadwiler
share their testimonies through Coloradobased Athletes in Action.
<P>
The Green Bay Packers' Reggie White
has teamed up with MIKE-E, a gospel
rapper, to form Big Doggie Records.
White, an ordained minister, said the
recordings will stress positive messages
for young people.
<P>
Last month's reception for about 150
homosexual activists at the home of Vice
President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper,
prompted sharp reaction in some quarters. It is evidence of a White House "out
of touch with the moral mood of America," said Michael Whitehead, general
counsel of the Southern Baptist Christian
Life Commission. Most who attended
were officers or members of the Human
Rights Campaign Fund, along with openly homosexual members of the administration, the Associated Press said.
<P>
President Clinton and his wife liked
what they heard at a Sunday service at
the Howard University campus chapel in
Washington. Guest speaker Gardner
Taylor of Concord Baptist Church in New
York attacked the GOP's "Contract With
America" as working against efforts to
ensure human rights for all. Taylor said
some Americans insist on the birth of
children, "but are ready to starve them
after they are born and, if by chance they
survive the starving, to execute them by
the time they are grown."
<P>
Los Angeles prosecutors will not pursue
child-abuse charges against controversial
evangelist Tony Alamo, who already is
serving a six-year federal sentence for
tax evasion (NIRR 10/3/94). The abuse
allegations stem from 1988, when officials accused Alamo of ordering followers
of his Saugus, Calif. church to paddle a
misbehaving 11-year-old 140 times.
<P>
Pat Robertson met with homosexual activist Mel White in jail and later dropped
trespassing charges against him. White
had been holding a hunger strike in his
cell at the Virginia Beach Jail. He was
arrested for failing to leave Christian
Broadcasting Network property in Virginia
Beach, Va. after Robertson declined to
meet with him to discuss Robertson's
views on homosexuality (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6</A>).
Spokesman Gene Kapp said Robertson
acted in response to a plea from White's
parents, long-time CBN supporters. Kapp
described the meeting as cordial, but
said Robertson did not compromise his
convictions regarding homosexuality.
<P>
Richard Halverson, 79, offered his final
prayer as chaplain of the Senate on
March 10 after 14 years in the post. Senators applauded him, then lined up to
shake his hand, to express appreciation
for guidance he had offered, and to say
goodbye (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/020695.html">NIRR 2/6</A>). Sen. Howell Heflin
(D-Ala.), who is a leader in the Senate
prayer breakfast group, called Halverson
"a wonderful friend and advisor to the
entire Senate family."
<P>
Franklin Graham conducted a four-night
crusade in Anchorage, Alaska. An average of 4,750 people attended each evening, and a total of 1,052 responded to
his invitation to commit their lives to
Christ. Graham and John Wesley White,
a fellow Billy Graham Evangelistic Association evangelist, also led a crusade in
Ketchikan, Alaska, considered to be the
first such event in that remote area.

Dropping appeal: Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary said it will drop its
appeal of the recent probation ruling of
the Association of Theological Schools
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/022095.html">NIRR 2/20</A>). Although trustees disagree
with the ruling, they want to focus constructively on the future rather than dwell
on the past, President Ken Hemphill said.
<P>
Deadbeat denominations: The financially strapped World Council of Churches is exploring ways to make sure its 320
member denominations pay dues. The
WCC did not say who the deadbeats are,
but said at least two of them have more
than 30 million members.       
<P>
Sharing campus: Hebrew College of
Brookline, Mass., will move to the
Andover Newton Theological School
campus in nearby Newton Centre and
share professors and programs with the
liberal Protestant seminary, the Boston
Globe reported.
<P>
Resurrection denied: The latest from
the Jesus Seminar: there is no evidence
that Christ's resurrection was a physical
reality (NIRR 11/14/94). The controversial
70-member scholars' group announced
its findings after a meeting of 40 members in Santa Rosa, Calif. The scholars
said the significance of the resurrection
does not depend on historical fact.
<P>
Homosexual rights: The Cincinnati City
Council voted 5-4 to strike a provision
from the city's human rights ordinance
that included homosexuals as a category
for civil-rights protection. Before the vote,
the American Family Association of Ohio
said it will urge Cincinnati voters in a
mass mailing not to vote for candidates
who "promote the homosexual agenda."
<P>
Health-care/abortion centers: Planned
Parenthood is considering a proposal to
turn its 900 clinics into primary healthcare centers. Everything from flu to cuts
and bruises would be treated, the group
said. Critics of the plan say they fear the
change would dilute the power of the
organization. 
<P>
Saliva test for AIDS: OraSure, a saliva
test for the AIDS virus, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Christian groups, most notably the
National Association of Evangelicals, and
AIDS activists lobbied for approval (NIRR
6/27/94), claiming it will broaden access
to testing, ensure earlier detection, and
decrease transmission of the virus.
<P>
29 countries remain: Evangelism Explosion -- a program that trains people how
to witness and train others -- is being
used in at least one church in 182 countries, according to Addison Soltau, vice
president of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based
Evangelism Explosion International. The
goal of the ministry, which was founded
by D. James Kennedy, is to become
active in all 211 of the world's nations. 
<P>
Marriage annulments increase: Each
year, some 50,000 American Catholic
marriages are declared null and void,
Newsweek reported. Grounds for granting an annulment -- a declaration that the
marriage was not valid in the first place -have expanded greatly in the last 20
years. Most annulments now are based
on psychological factors such as immaturity. Cynics call it "divorce, Catholic style,"
the magazine said. The Vatican has complained that the church's marriage tribunals have become too lenient.
<P>
Honoring pastors: Under His Wing Ministries is recruiting support for a National
Clergy Appreciation Day, Oct. 5. The
group's leader, Jerry Frear, wants a proclamation approved in each state and by
the White House. For more information,

Eritrea: Jehovah's Witnesses have been
stripped of citizenship because they refused to recognize the state and observe
its laws. Officials accused them of failing
to take part in Eritrea's 30-year war for
independence from Ethiopia. Witnesses
also refused to participate in a 1992 referendum on creation of the state, officials
said. They did not estimate the number
of JWs in the population of 2.8 million.
<P>
Niger: Calvary Ministries, a Nigerianbased Christian organization, is planning
to build a rehabilitation center for women
prostitutes. Many women engage in the
practice and "some whole communities
are inhabited by prostitutes," Calvary
director Peter Ozodo said. Niger is about
90% Muslim and less than one person in
1,000 is a born-again Christian, Christian
Mission magazine reports.

Iran: Western values should not be imposed on Muslims, officials said in rejecting censure by the U.N. Human Rights
Commission for alleged abuses. The
commission criticized the treatment of
women in Iran. "Nations have their particular cultures, their own religions....Human
rights should be Islamic," Iran's judicial
chief, an Islamic clergyman, said.
<P>
United Arab Emirates: Southern Baptists will establish a training ministry to
increase evangelical influence among
expatriates living in the seven states that

Fiji: A government plan to repeal the
Sunday Observance Decree will take
effect late in the year. The decree, put in
place by the leader of a 1987 military
coup, bans work, entertainment, and
organized sports on Sundays. Thousands
of people, directed by Methodist leaders,
took to streets throughout the South Pacific islands country to protest lifting the
ban, news agencies reported.

France: Marriage went out of style in this
predominantly Catholic nation faster than
anywhere else in western Europe in
1993, the country's National Statistics
Institute reported. Formal marriages tumbled 6% to 255,200, the lowest for any
year this century. Couples are cohabiting
rather than marrying, while economic recession in the early 1990s made many
couples delay marriage, officials said.
<P>
France: Catholic bishop Jean-Charles
Thomas said he ordered the recall of a
new Bible because it contained an "antiSemitic aspect." The Bible for Christian
Communities, for which Thomas wrote
the preface, is a work by Bernard
Hurault, a missionary in Chile. Intended
for poor people, more than 18 million
copies in English and Spanish have been
distributed in South America, and 60,000
copies in Europe, news reports said.
Jews killed Christ because they "were
not able to control their fanaticism," according to commentary in the Bible. It reduced Jewish custom to "folkloric duties
involving circumcision and hats."
<P>
France: France contains the single largest concentration of Muslims in the
Western world -- approximately 4 million.
<P>
Italy: A Florence judge investigating
bomb attacks on churches and museums
in 1993 told reporters he believes the
Mafia carried out two of them. The bombings were to punish Pope John Paul II for
condemnation of the group, he said.
<P>
Russia: Parishioners at a Catholic
church in Moscow, including a Polish
national, were arrested and allegedly
beaten. A policeman kicked and severely
injured a nun, a Polish priest said at a
Moscow news conference. The incident
involved a takeover in a part of the
church building. Commercial firms had
refused to vacate the building after authorities returned it to the Catholic
Church. The firm's representatives said
the parishioners had been removing
printing presses and tearing down a wall.

Germany: Evangelical groups are protesting German automaker Volkswagen
A.G. for its sponsorship of the Rolling
Stones' European tour this summer, according to news reports. The tours' title is
"Voodoo Lounge," the same as the British quartet's latest recording. Wilfred
Reuter of the Evangelical Centre in

England: Retired British Anglican bishop
Derek Rawcliffe, 74, acknowledged in a
BBC TV interview that he is a homosexual. The former Bishop of Glasgow also
said he favors church blessings of gay
and lesbian relationships. Rawcliffe's
theology is flawed, George Austin, Archdeacon of York, told British reporters.
"The Scripture is quite clear in its condemnation of homosexual practices."
<P>
England: Cardinal Basil Hume, leader of
Britain's Catholics, strongly condemned
discrimination against homosexuals. "To
love another, whether of the same sex or
of a different sex, is to have entered the
area of richest human experience," he
said. However, he added, the Catholic
Church does not recognize a right to
sexual activities between homosexuals,
"which she teaches are morally wrong."
<P>
Hungary: The Constitutional Court struck
down a law barring homosexuals from
common-law marriage. The court ruled
that formal civil marriages are still offlimits to homosexual partners. However,
under Hungarian regulations, commonlaw marriage gives virtually all the rights
to partners that registered marriages
offer, according to Reuters. Hungary is
the first East European nation to extend
such rights to homosexual couples. Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, and the
Netherlands also have granted same-sex
couples similar rights as heterosexuals.
<P>
Bulgaria: A Baptist construction company in Bulgaria is manufacturing inexpensive, prefabricated churches for use in
Eastern Europe, the German Evangelical

<A NAME="COLLEGEREVIVAL"><H3>COLLEGE REVIVAL SPREADS FROM TEXAS SCHOOL</H3></A>
<P>
A spontaneous spiritual revival has begun on college campuses in the
United States. The phenomenon, which includes open confession of personal
sins, began with a Howard Payne University student in Brownwood, Texas. Manifestations spread to other schools visited by Howard Payne students, including
Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Beeson School of
Divinity in Birmingham, Ala., and Olivet Nazarene University in Kankakee, Ill.
Some observers compare the phenomenon to the revival that began at Asbury
College in Wilmore, Ky., in 1970 and swept across the United States.
<BR>...Revival broke out when Howard Payne University student Chris Robeson
testified tearfully Jan. 22 at Coggin Avenue Baptist Church in Brownwood about
his life and the spiritual condition of his classmates. "People just started streaming down the aisles" to pray, confess sins, and restore seemingly doomed
relationships, pastor John Avant told Baptist Press. Since then, the church has
continued to hold three-and-a-half-hour services. "This is not something we're
trying to manufacture," Avant told NIRR. "It's the most wonderful thing we've
ever experienced."
<BR>...At nearby Howard Payne University, revival broke out during a Jan. 26
service. Then, during Feb. 13-15 meetings led by Southern Baptist revival leader
Henry Blackaby, some 35-40 young men and a number of young women openly
confessed sins of lust. As local pastors prayed and counseled them, about 200
more people, including adults from the local community, came forward to
become believers or rededicate their lives to Christ. "Once we saw the Spirit
move, we didn't want to leave," student Andrea Cullins said. 
<BR>...Howard Payne students began testifying at numerous churches and
schools about the events. On March 1, Avant addressed a packed Truett Auditorium audience at Southwestern Baptist. Avant's description of events in
Brownwood was followed by an outpouring of seven hours of confession and
prayer by students, faculty, and administrators, he said. At Beeson, Avant and
Robeson spoke March 7 at a "remarkable" three-hour service during which
dozens of people came forward to pray, confess pride and lust, and seek personal
reconciliation, Timothy George, the school's dean, told NIRR. This is something
"we have been praying and yearning for," George said. The phenomena is "a
genuine moving of God and the beginning of authentic spiritual revival," said
Ken Hemphill, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary president.

Although thousands of people from around the world have flocked to Toronto to observe the laughing revival (NIRR 7/11/94), some visitors reject the
phenomenon. After he heard people making animal sounds and saw them rolling
on the floor laughing, Southern Baptist executive Ron Owens declared, "It's demeaning to think Christ in me will be manifested in this way." During genuine
moves of God, there "always have been distractions and counterfeits," he said.
Cult watcher Hank Hanegraaff warned his radio audience that the movement is
not biblical. Philip Roberts, another SBC leader, said the laughter and animal
sounds also are hallmarks of some New Age and Eastern religious groups.                            
<P>
Pastors' Prayer Summits -- weekend retreats for pastors and board members -- continue to spread. There have been 38 such summits this school year,
with 24 more set for the spring. Nearly 2,250 people have participated in the
summits so far this school year, nearly as many as in all of last year. The
conferences often result in renewal among weary and discouraged clergy and lay
leaders, participants say. One pastor described the summits as "a sweet, gentle,
and awesome experience."
<BR>..."God has definitely moved through the pastors to the body of Christ, and
the fires are spreading," according to Terry Dirks, vice president of Portlandbased International Renewal Ministries, which sponsors the meetings. Pastors
across the country do not want to attend "more events, programs, seminars, and
conferences," but to slow down and spend time in God's presence, Dirks said.

A group of Christians began a 786-mile walk. The 23 "prayerwalkers" left
San Diego March 1 for San Francisco, where they are to arrive April 9. They
plan to pray for each community along the El Camino Real, the roadway formed
when Franciscan priests established 21 mission communities. The walkers, who
are members of various denominations, will be joined for briefer periods by
prayer walkers in various communities. Longer days will be covered by breaking
into two groups that walk simultaneously along different segments of the route.
As of mid-March, flooding had not delayed the walk, although the routes may be
altered slightly, a spokesman said. For information on prayerwalks, call
WayMakers at (512) 331-8205.

The National Association of Evangelicals bid farewell to Billy Melvin, 65,
its executive director for 28 years, at the group's 53rd annual convention, held in
Louisville, Ky. Melvin will become vice president at-large, occasionally doing
work for the organization. His successor, Don Argue, 55, will have the title of

reconciliation, more participation by women and young people, and inclusion of
more parachurch organizations and megachurches, leaders said.

graciousness" among the races, but a "total obliteration" of those things that
separate them. Duane Liftin, president of Wheaton College, reminded the NAE
audience that it must be "deeply rooted in the One whom we preach." Morris
Chapman, president of the executive committee of the Southern Baptist Convention, said revival "can not be worked up, it must be prayed down." David Bryant
of Concerts of Prayer International said America is in the early stages of a
spiritual awakening whose "intensity and focus may be unprecedented."

A Bible study that began in an unused funeral parlor has resulted in 12
"death metal" music fans becoming Christians. The Hard Core Bible Study,
which began a year ago near the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis,
reaches youth who are obsessed with death, study leader Mark Johnson told
Youth With A Mission News. Johnson said death metal is intense and filled with
growls and snarls. Christian rock concerts also were held at the parlor, with the
owner's permission. 
<BR>...Anarchists, skinheads, and "headbangers" study Scripture as they sit on
dusty furniture next to urns and coffins. "Everyone is welcome, nobody is condemned, and the gospel is boldly proclaimed," said Johnson, a 32-year-old, longhaired licensed minister. Several of the young converts take part in weekend
street evangelism. They perform a drama in which someone jumps out of a
coffin and espouses hopelessness and nihilism. At that point, bystanders often
cheer because "that's what they believe," Johnson told NIRR. Then, Johnson
begins a dialogue with the "dead" person, conveying the hope found in Christ.

The Soul Children of Chicago, a black gospel choir, is "the best drug-free,
anti-gang program around," founder Walter Whiteman said. The choir, which is
in its 13th year, stresses discipline, leadership, self-esteem, the importance of
academic achievement, and social responsibility, according to The Chronicle of
Philanthropy. Its 60 members range in age from 7 to 17. Of the 850 former Soul
Children, more than half have graduated from high school, and 95% of those
have gone to college. About 30 of the 250 yearly applicants are accepted for
membership, but only if their parents pass an interview showing they support the
organization and will donate time as tutors, fund-raisers, and drivers.

Evangelicals are making inroads in Turkey, Baptist Press reported. The 99%
Muslim country long has resisted evangelical efforts and establishment of
churches. As recently as the late 1970s, there were no known Christian believers
among the ethnic Turks, mission experts say. Groups such as Operation Mobilization and Youth With A Mission fielded itinerant teams to evangelize secretly.
<BR>...But now there are at least 400 "tent-making" Christian workers and
about the same number of baptized believers, according to a Southern Baptist
worker who requested anonymity for security reasons. The worker told Baptist
Press that as many as 2,000 people attend Bible studies or worship services in
the nation of 60.8 million. Small congregations have been established in all
Turkey's major cities. However, only two have their own buildings in which to
meet. He described the baptism of 27 believers in one service last year as
possibly the biggest baptismal service there since Paul preached at Ephesus,
located near the present-day city of Izmir.
<BR>...There have been anti-Christian media campaigns recently, and people
still are brought to trial for converting from Islam, the worker said. Although
higher courts in Turkey eventually free them, they frequently undergo lengthy
persecution, including torture, while in jail awaiting trial, he said.

More than 12,000 Hungarian Christians attended the Holy Spirit Renewal
Conference held by Faith Church Hungary in Budapest last month. Faith Church,
the country's largest charismatic-evangelical church, has 30,000 members in
some 130 congregations across the country. Senior pastor Sandor Nemeth founded Faith Church in 1993 and oversaw the conversion of 40,000 people and 8,000
baptisms in 1994, the church said. More than 100 teams of evangelists use mime,
music, and preaching with the goal of reaching every village and city in Hungary
with the gospel. The church is raising funds to build a 12,000-seat church hall in
Budapest. In addition to starting Hungarian congregations, the church has planted
churches in Hungarian-speaking areas of Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine, and the
former Yugoslavia.

In Russia, relationships are improving among Christian denominations, the
International Law Group said. The horrors of the Chechnyan war and the need
for faith and morality have spurred interchurch cooperation, and calls for special
privileges for Orthodoxy are diminishing, the group said.
<BR>...Various Christian denominations and more than 1,000 representatives from
other faiths began a reconciliation process in January. Vacheslav Polosin (NIRR
9/20/93), a parliamentarian who once proposed restricting foreign religious
organizations, said the Orthodox should work cooperatively to reach an unbelieving generation. He noted that foreign Christian groups will force the Orthodox to
be evangelistic and that Christianity is by nature an "international religion."

In the former Soviet region of Nal'chik, 400 miles northwest of Chechnya

Marino told NIRR. Nal'chik is heavily Muslim, and Christians face disownment

Cambodia donated 25 acres to Youth With A Mission's Hagar Project for
homeless women and children. The project is part of YWAM's Hagar Center, a
house in Phnom Penh that takes in as many as 16 women and 40 children and
gives them vocational and spiritual training. Hagar Project workers offer training
in agriculture, basket weaving, and hairdressing. They also counsel the abused
and hold twice-weekly Bible study and worship. Many Cambodian women are
abandoned or widowed because of the country's 20-year civil war. Some turn to
begging or prostitution to survive, project director Pierre Tami said.

The Worldwide Church of God slashed programs and staff to cope with a
one-third loss in revenue and 10% loss of membership. The 56-acre site in
Pasadena, Calif., which is headquarters for the church of 95,000 baptized
members founded by Herbert W. Armstrong, is for sale. However, a spokesman
said the church is not headed for bankruptcy. Losses stem from a wholesale
revision of doctrine in the last five years. "We have been in error on several
points," including the doctrine of the Trinity, which the denomination once
rejected, but now espouses, spokesman Tom Lapacka told NIRR.
<BR>...The denomination still is in transition, but is holding together, he said.
Members are studying Scripture and learning more about salvation through grace,
and that is making "a profound positive change." Lapacka asked for prayers
because "it is a difficult time for us." The church is known for its magazine, The
Plain Truth, and its television and radio program, The World Tomorrow.

The Alliance of Baptists called for a change in dealings with Jews. At its
annual meeting the group said most recent Baptist overtures have been "reduced
to a theology of conversion." It called for genuine dialogue based on a respect
for Judaism. It also confessed to interpreting the Bible in ways that have "created
enemies of the Jewish people." The 121-congregation alliance split from the
Southern Baptist Convention in 1986.

The New York Supreme Court ruled that a special school district created by
members of a Hasidic Jewish sect for handicapped children is constitutional. The
fact that only the group's members have taken advantage of the law does not
make it a segregated school, it said. Kiryas Joel school district previously was
part of an Orange County district, but the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the
arrangement last June on grounds it violated the Establishment Clause (NIRR
7/11/94). New York's legislature then passed a law in which any locality that
met certain criteria could form its own school district.

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act survived the first legal test of its
constitutionality. U.S. District Judge Helen Gillmor in Honolulu rejected
Hawaii's claim that Congress overstepped its authority in passing the 1993 law.
The claim arose from a ruling that state prison officials must show, under RFRA,
a compelling reason to infringe on a prisoner's religious practice.
<BR>...Days later, a federal judge in Texas ruled RFRA unconstitutional. The
ruling came in a case pitting the Catholic archdiocese of San Antonio against the
city of Boerne, Texas. City officials had refused to allow the archdiocese to
demolish part of an old church building in order to expand. The archdiocese
sued, citing the RFRA. Boerne's lawyers argued that Congress did not have
power to enact the measure, and Judge Lucius Bunton agreed.

The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule by late June on the University
of Virginia's refusal to allow funding of a student-run religious publication from
student activity fees (NIRR 11/14/94). The case was argued before the high court
this month by University of Chicago law professor Michael McConnell on behalf
of three students. He said the school's denial amounted to discrimination based
on religious speech. Questions by the justices suggested division and indecision
about church-state separation issues, analysts noted.

Former student Craig Rogers, 33, filed a $2.5 million sexual harassment suit
against California State University-Sacramento. It accuses professor Joanne
Marrow, a lesbian, of giving a graphic lecture in Psychology 100 class that
caused him "emotional distress." She told anecdotes about masturbation, made
jokes about male genitalia, and showed slides of female genitalia, Rogers said. 
<BR>...Rogers, a member of the Nazarene church, spoke with his pastor and
others at Sacramento First Church before deciding to take action. When he got
no response from the school or the California Board of Control, which hears
complaints against the state, he filed the suit. Marrow's lawyer accused Rogers
of being on "a religious crusade." Rogers said his religion has nothing to do with
the suit. His attorney said the lecture violated regulations that ban persistent
displays of sexually explicit pictures.

Vietnam is persecuting pastors who have formed relationships with churches
overseas. Ron VanderGriend, director of Asian Ministries for The Bible League,
told NIRR he was arrested in Danang last month by police who raided his hotel
room during a meeting with 18 Vietnamese house-church leaders. He was
detained for a week before Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) won his release.
VanderGriend said he knows of at least four similar incidents in the past two
months. House-church members left the government-sanctioned Protestant
church, Tin Lahn, because of restrictions on beliefs and meeting places.
<BR>...In rural areas, church members are fined and threatened. Fines average
$10 a person -- about a month's wages -- but have run as high as $200. Tran
Dinh Ai, an Assemblies of God minister with 100 congregations, told NIRR
those who can't pay are forced to work in government camps until the fine is
paid. Ai said the government rejected applications for recognition of his church
because of Pentecostal beliefs that are considered unorthodox. 
<BR>...Ai served two years of an eight-year sentence for church activities, then
was released in 1993 without explanation. He credits the prayers of believers for
his release, but also said Vietnam wanted to deceive the outside world into
thinking there is religious freedom, "but in fact it is very tight." VanderGriend
said once Vietnam got what it was after -- normalization of relations and the
opening up of trade with the United States in 1994 -- "persecution stepped up."
<BR>...Other informed sources disagree. They say the government is trying to
provide more religious freedom, but is wary of groups with ties to Western
countries because they could destabilize Vietnam.

A Washington state law barring doctors from helping terminally ill patients
die was upheld by a federal appeals court in San Francisco. The law protects the
poor and handicapped, and keeps doctors from becoming "killers of their patients," the panel said. The ruling, the first on the assisted-suicide ban, overturned

Abortion must be "brought back to the front burner of the nation's conscience and agenda," according to Pierre Bynum of Sound the Trumpet Ministries in Washington, D.C. The group monitors political, legal, and moral trends,

radicals have caused "legitimate pro-life leaders to become timid, hopeful only
for incremental change" during the current Congress, Bynum warned. He said
conservative political victories in the United States and renewal in the church
alone will not "nullify God's curses on America, earned by defiance of His

Three "crucial choices" made by young adults influence the strength of
families, according to research cited by White House domestic-policy advisor
William Galston. The choices: to graduate from high school, to marry before
having children, and to wait until an adult to have children. Only 8% of children
born to people who have met all three indicators live in poverty, Galston told a
Southern Baptist-sponsored conference on the family in Knoxville, Tenn. But, he
added, 79% of children born to people who haven't met any of the three criteria
live in poverty. Government policies can help strengthen families, but not
without "moral commitments" by the people, Galston said.

Kids need fathers who are strong family leaders, said David Blankenhorn,
author of Fatherless America. The book contains evidence from sociology and
anthropology detailing societal consequences of loss of belief in fatherhood. Men
in America increasingly are viewed as "expendable or part of the problem," he
told USA Today. Blankenhorn, founder of the New York think-tank Institute for
American Values, criticized acceptance of what he calls America's "divorce
culture." He said couples worry more about "doing divorce better" than staying
married. Stepfamilies are unstable, said Blankenhorn, who also criticized single
mothers for relying on "nearby guys" -- such as scout leaders and boyfriends -as male role models for kids.
<BR>...Blankenhorn also chairs the National Fatherhood Initiative. It is sponsoring the National Fatherhood Tour to 25 U.S. cities to "start a national debate on
fatherhood." One of the goals of the tour is to encourage 10,000 men to commit
themselves to become better fathers. For information or to schedule a speaker,

Prominent evangelical John MacArthur is criticizing cooperation between
Protestants and Catholics. MacArthur, pastor of Grace Community Church in Sun
Valley, Calif., has been aggressively trying to woo away Catholics from what he
calls their "false religion," according to the Los Angeles Times. He also has
criticized the 1994 Catholic-Protestant document urging a truce on proselytizing
in each other's ranks and more cooperation in fighting common societal enemies.
MacArthur is president of The Master's College in Newhall and has a nationwide
following for his books, seminars and radio broadcasts.
<BR>...Gregory Coiro, a priest speaking for the Los Angeles Catholic
Archdiocese, said MacArthur has a long record of "Catholic bashing." Coiro said
it was "kind of cheeky" for him to say he wants to "lead Catholics to Christ,
considering we kept belief in Christ alive for over 1,500 years before an evangelical Protestant ever set foot on the planet."                                                      <P><A HREF="#MENU">Back to menu</A>

Habitat For Humanity will build a twostory house on the site of a Lafayette,
Ind., home damaged by several arson
fires. City officials had ordered the house
destroyed and were going to bill owner
Larry Stefonic for cleanup. Habitat plans
to clear the lot and cut the cleanup cost
by selling the wreckage for recycling.
<P>
Wittenberg University's faculty, staff,
and students raised $19,000 to help construct a Habitat for Humanity house in
Springfield, Ohio. The money came from
payroll deductions, auctions, rummage
sales, and proceeds from concession
stands at games.

In order to witness to hunters, fishermen, and white water rafters, Youth With
A Mission runs a coffee shop in the tiny
mountain community of Riggins, Idaho.
Scriptural thoughts printed on cups help
to start conversations and give YWAM
workers opportunities to share the gospel. Some customers ask for prayers
when they are facing difficult situations.
The shop, which is six miles from a
YWAM training ranch, draws about 30
customers a day. 
<P>
Under pressure, the Greek Orthodox
Church in the United States will tone
down a recent encyclical on mixed marriage (NIRR 11/14/94). In it, Archbishop
Iakovos, the church's top leader, lumped
Pentecostals with Buddhists, Hindus,
members of cults, New Age devotees,
and others as outside the Christian tradition. Pentecostals and some Orthodox
church members protested the encyclical.
As a result, officials said, a revised encyclical will instruct priests that
Pentecostals can marry Orthodox, depending on their beliefs and those of their
Pentecostal denomination. Iakovos has
feuded for years with charismatics in his
own denomination.
<P>
Jewish volunteers in Denver and Seattle worked on Christmas Day so Christians could have the day off. Some 50-60
volunteers from the Synagogue Council
of Denver filled in at St. Anthony Hospital. About 300 members of the B'nai
B'rith's Project Brotherhood in Seattle
helped at nursing homes, retirement centers, and other agencies that must stay
open on Christmas.
<P>
Jewish volunteers, organized by the
Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los
Angeles, spent Christmas Day doing
good works around the city. The 300
people cleaned beaches, entertained runaway youths at a shelter in Hollywood,
painted a multipurpose center in South
Los Angeles, and delivered food to AIDS
patients. Rabbi Harvey Fields said the
Jews wanted to give a kind of Christmas
gift to the city, and hopes it will become
an annual event.
<P>
David C. Cook Foundation and David
C. Cook Publishing Co. changed their

International and Cook Communications
Ministries to reflect expanding ministries.
The Elgin, Ill.-based foundation, which

Chicago's phantom philanthropist
struck again last Christmas. Over the
past 12 years, someone has dropped
more than $20,000 worth of valuable gold

The Walt Disney Company has donated
$125,000 to Christian ministries in Detroit. The proceeds came from the premiere of Disney's The Santa Clause and
were split between The Salvation Army's
Detroit Harbor Light Legal Aid Clinic and
the Forgotten Harvest, an organization
that feeds the hungry.
<P>
A government loan helped start a topless bar in Mobile, Ala. The Small Business Administration said the agency
could not discriminate because the bar,
named Sammy's, met government guidelines. Community members protested,
saying the bar is too close to an elementary school.
<P>
A Washington State trooper charged
with illegally detaining a couple who were
on their way to an abortion clinic (NIRR
12/26/94) has been fired, news reports
said. Lane Jackstadt, 34, faces charges
of unlawful imprisonment and official
misconduct. News reports said Jackstadt
was fired for cheating on an exam, not
for the abortion-related incident.
<P>
Public school teachers in Massachusetts must take homosexual-sensitivity
training before entering the classroom,
the American Family Association Journal
said. Colleges offering degrees in education must prove they are addressing homosexual issues, and teachers must
show they have attended sensitivity-training sessions to be certified.
<P>
Michigan's charter school program
(NIRR 11/14/94) will get state funding
after all, news reports said. Gov. John
Engler signed a bill giving emergency
funding to nine of the special schools.
The money had been in doubt after a
Lansing judge ruled that the law was unconstitutional. To try to comply with the
judge's ruling, the legislature gave state
education officials more oversight over
charter schools.
<P>
The Bloomingdale, Mich., Board of
Education said it will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to allow it to keep its portrait
of Jesus hanging in a high school hallway (NIRR 9/19/94). Several courts have
ruled in favor of plaintiffs in a 1992 lawsuit seeking its removal because it allegedly violates the Constitution's Establishment Clause. "The community and the
school should decide what hangs on their
halls, and we still believe it would be
censorship to take it down," school board
president James Dickerson told reporters.
<P>
A Pentecostal minister slain in Essex,
Md., had a police record linking him to
drug dealings, court records show. They
implicate Samuel Booth, Jr., of Christian
Faith Tabernacle Church with individuals
who purchased cocaine sold in Maryland.
The confessed killer said he robbed the
minister of cash and cocaine. Church
members said Booth frequently took in
wayward youth and drug addicts, and let
them sleep in his trailer.
<P>
New York City will challenge the constitutionality of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, city officials said. Earlier,
Gov. Mario Cuomo bowed to pressure
from the American Jewish Congress and
dropped efforts to nullify the act. Muslim
prison inmates have sued under RFRA
seeking religious accommodations, including services led by Muslim clergy.
RFRA requires governments to show a
"compelling interest" before they can restrict religious activities.
<P>
A computer was used to "shave" the
beard and sideburns from a Hasidic prison inmate. New York prison officials
agreed to accept a clean-shaven computer image for the rabbi's ID photo instead
of forcing him to shave. Policy dictates
that prisoners be pictured clean-shaven,
but Rabbi Shlomo Helbrans said shaving
would violate his religious beliefs. He was
convicted in November of directing the
kidnapping of one of his teen-age students in a family religious dispute, and
received 4-to-12 years in prison.
<P>
San Francisco passed a law barring
discrimination against transsexuals and
transvestites in employment and housing.
The measure adds "gender identity" to
other categories protected by city: race,
religion, color, ancestry, age, sex, sexual
orientation, disability, and place of birth.
<P>
A connection between fingerprint ridges and homosexuality is "highly speculative," said Exodus International, a San
Raphael, Calif.-based ministry to homosexuals. University of Western Ontario
researchers found that 30% of homosexual men in a test group had more ridges
on their left hands than their right, while
only 14% of the heterosexual men in the
group showed the same pattern. Even if
people are born with predetermined factors that push them toward homosexuality, "we all control our sexual choices" as
adults, said Bob Davies of Exodus.
<P>
The Susan B. Anthony List, a political
action committee, has raised more than
$100,000 for pro-life female candidates,
the Wall Street Journal said. The group,
which was started to counter the growing
influence of the pro-choice Emily's List,
has a donor base that is 75% women.
<P>
Snap-On Tools stopped publishing its
calendars featuring scantily clad women,
which are displayed in gasoline stations
and repair shops around the country. The
Kenosha, Wis., company said it will
spend the money instead on an advertising campaign to help boost the image
of mechanics.
Thirty-three national pro-life and profamily organizations have joined a boycott of products produced by Hoechst AG
(NIRR 6/13/94). The company owns the
controlling interest in Roussel-Uclaf,
which developed the abortion drug RU486. John Willke, president of Life Issues
Institute, leads the coalition, which also is
open to individuals and churches. The
institute has wallet-sized cards listing
Hoechst prescription drugs and possible
substitutes. For information, call the institute at (513) 729-3600.

War-ravaged citizens in 16 cities in
Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina received
2 million pounds of food, medical equipment, clothing, blankets and toys over
Christmas from Feed the Hungry, the
relief arm of the Lester Sumrall Evangelistic Association. The delivery is critical
in winter when supplies are most scarce,
said Joe Wilkey of LESEA. Since 1993,
Feed the Hungry has distributed 6 million
pounds of food and supplies to the
region's citizens through local churches,
pastors, and religious organizations. The
aid makes people more receptive to the
gospel, Wilkey said.

A group of 93 Eastern European evangelical leaders and educators, meeting in
Romania, promised to cooperate in promoting theological education in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union.

Two middle-aged men exchanged wedding vows in Stockholm, becoming the
first Swedish couple to marry under a
new law allowing such marriages. Sweden, Denmark, and Norway allow homosexuals to register partnerships with all
the rights and obligations of marriage
except adopting children or having a
church wedding. In 1989, Denmark became the world's first country to permit
homosexual marriages. Since then, 2,810
Danish men and women have registered
their partnerships, officials said.

Divorces in England and Wales
reached a record high of 160,385 in
1992, government statistics show. Marriages meanwhile fell 11% to 311,564
from their peak in 1987. Just over half of
weddings in 1992 were secular, outnumbering religious ceremonies (49.6%) for
the first time since 1979.

broadcasts, literature, and correspondence courses, distributed 100 packets
containing shortwave radios, Bibles and
study materials in Mandarin, China's
official language. After the agency's first
month of broadcasts in China, more than
300 letters of thanks and requests came
into its Hong Kong production offices.

A group of American Jews traveled to
Japan last fall to honor Chiune Sugihara,
a Greek Orthodox Christian, for his assistance to Jews fleeing Eastern Europe in
1940. Acclaimed as "the Japanese
Schindler," Sugihara served as Japan's
vice consul to Lithuania. Contrary to his
country's policy, he issued more than
1,000 transit visas to Polish Jews, allowing them to escape the Holocaust via
Siberia and Japan. Sugihara was forced
to quit the foreign ministry in 1947 because of those activities.

A first-ever conference of homosexuals
from South Asia called on India to repeal
a law making homosexual sex a crime
punishable by 10 years imprisonment.
About 70 homosexuals from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka
attended the five-day meeting near Bombay, news outlets reported.

Israel's population reached 5.46 million
at the end of 1994, the government's bureau of statistics reported. There are 4.44
million Jews (81%), 777,000 Muslims
(14.2%), 161,000 Christians (3%), and
92,000 Druze (1.7%). Most of the year's
80,000 new immigrants came from the
former Soviet Union.

A Cairo court banned showing of the
Egyptian-French movie The Emigrant. In
telling the story of Joseph, it broke
Islam's taboo on depiction of apostles of
the faith. The judge said he based his
ruling on a report by al-Azhar mosque,
the Sunni Muslim world's most prestigious seat of learning since its founding
more than 1,000 years ago. The film had
run for three months in many of Egypt's
theaters, news reports said.

Zaire's Catholic bishops issued a
scathing attack on the rule of President
Mobutu Sese Seko, who has been in
power 29 years. They accused his regime of trying to stifle dissent prior to this
year's elections. They also said the government encouraged creation of religious
sects to destabilize the Catholic Church.
They said they had noticed a campaign
targeting the clergy, worshipers, and
places of worship for harassment.

<A NAME="BILLYGRAHAM'SGLOBALBROADCAST"><H3>BILLY GRAHAM'S GLOBAL BROADCAST TO REACH 1 BILLION PEOPLE</H3></A>
<P>
Potentially more than 1 billion people will participate in Global Mission,
a three-day Billy Graham crusade and Christian Workers' Conference. It will be
broadcast March 16-18 to countries with 70% of the world's population. The 
crusade will be beamed by satellite from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to 165 countries,
and translated simultaneously into 80 languages. Pre-produced segments of
culturally appropriate singing and testimonials will be broadcast before and after
the messages. The March 17 broadcast will air in the United States March 19,
and in 90 other countries in the months after the crusade. If 10% of viewers
respond, which has occurred in Graham's previous satellite broadcasts, "we're
talking about a hundred million people making decisions" for Christ, Billy
Graham Evangelistic Association President John Corts said. 
<BR>...In addition, a Christian Workers' Conference will feature three hours of
daily programming designed to teach evangelism. Programming will feature Luis
Palau, Ravi Zacharias, Michael Baughen, Leighton Ford, and Franklin Graham.
Other segments have been videotaped for local workshops after the crusade.
<BR>...This is not mass evangelism, but personal evangelism on a mass scale,
BGEA spokesman Larry Ross said. Last year, the BGEA trained 5,000 missions
directors to instruct more than 1 million Christians. Some 450,000 of them will
distribute literature and disciple new believers. This massive use of people and
technology to spread the gospel is a natural extension and "the capstone" -though not the conclusion -- of Graham's ministry, Ross said.

More than half the world's missionaries come from Third World countries,
according to Hans Finzel, director of CB International, missionary wing of the
Conservative Baptists. The trend shows that missions agencies succeeded in
creating national churches that caught the missionary vision. Growing numbers of
missionaries from Southeast Asia mean that "America no longer bears the burden
alone, but now stands shoulder-to-shoulder in partnership" to reach the world for
Christ, Finzel said. He said these regions, and some in South America and
Africa, can be de-emphasized and missionaries redeployed to less-evangelized
areas, such as the barely reached 10/40 Window (NIRR 11/23/94). 
<BR>...U.S. support for missions work is declining, Finzel said. Saturated donor
bases and the church's failure to convince people of the importance of missions
have resulted in less money. Old methods of raising missions support don't work
well on the baby-boomer and baby-buster generations, so new approaches are
needed, he said. Younger supporters value demonstrated results and a feeling of
personal involvement. "Institutions are out, people are in."          
<P>
Pentecostal ministers from Serbia and Croatia gathered in southern
Hungary to express unity and Christian love for each other despite the war
between their countries. A "miracle of unity of the body of Christ" was expressed as 140 ministers from the warring countries asked forgiveness of each
other and wept tears of repentance, said conference organizer Peter Kuzmic, who
heads a seminary and relief agency in Osijek, Croatia (NIRR 1/24/94). The twoday conference, held in December, is the third in three years for ministers from
the former Yugoslavia. The pastors gathered to foster unity and show "that the
people of God are one, regardless of secular divisions," Kuzmic said. 
<P>
Two hundred business and industry leaders in the Czech Republic gathered for an evangelistic banquet along with Ramesh Richard Evangelism and
Church Helps International, a ministry based in Dallas. The mostly atheistic
crowd listened as two Texas businessmen spoke of their faith in relation to
business, and Ramesh preached a message of salvation. Of those attending, 15
indicated trust in Christ, 30 wanted more information, and 20 asked to attend a
religious discussion group on Christianity. Jan Kazal, vice president of the Czech
National Council, urged the leaders to consider the total transformation of Czech
society, spiritually as well as materially.
<BR>...About 25% of Czechs believe in God, 12% believe in some sort of supernatural power, and 31% are open to the possibility that God exists, a survey by a
Czech government-funded research institute found.                     
<P>
Japan is experiencing uncommon growth in Christian converts. Revival
services in the past year have resulted in 30,000 new believers. For Japan, "these
results are really remarkable," Paul Ariga of All Japanese Revival Mission said.
Ariga credits the results to nationwide prayer movements, cooperation between
church leaders, and "strategic spiritual warfare." 
<BR>...More than 13,000 "prayer warriors" have spent 777,000 hours in prayer
since 1992 at more than 750 prayer meetings. The fruits of these efforts were
seen at a three-day crusade in 1992, the All Japan Revival Koshien Mission,
when more than 20,000 Japanese made commitments to Christ. "I knew then that
revival had come to Japan," Ariga said. Soon afterward, he and five other
evangelists formed the AJRM, which has held crusades throughout the country.
Less than 3% of Japan's 124 million people are Christians.

A white, suburban congregation and a black inner-city fellowship in San

Burlingame, Calif., and Ingleside Presbyterian Church in San Francisco hold
many activities together. The "spark and center of our relationship" is a monthly
joint Bible study for about 20 people, with an equal number from each church,
Paul Watermulder, First Presbyterian pastor, told The Reconciler magazine.

Mission Mississippi, an interdenominational fellowship of black and white

Anti-violence crusader Ternae Jordan has befriended the boy who shot
and wounded his 15-year-old son, T.J. (NIRR 11/15/93). Dwayne Carter, a
neighborhood youth, was convicted of criminal recklessness after firing four
bullets at T.J.'s head. Jordan, pastor of Greater Progressive Baptist Church in
Fort Wayne, Ind., convinced a judge in August to "sentence him to our church,"
he told NIRR. When Carter is released from prison this year, Jordan and men
from the church will "work with him every Sunday, and let him interact with
T.J." and other youth. "I just want to save the boy's life, and the church is the
way to do it," said Jordan, founder of the Stop the Madness campaign. A bullet
still lodged in T.J.'s brain has not caused permanent damage, Jordan said. 
<P>
A United Methodist clergyman is helping lead a national crusade against
legalized gambling. Tom Grey is a full-time spokesperson for the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling. A member of the denomination's Northern
Illinois Annual Conference, Grey travels extensively and works with "whoever is
smart enough to figure out that Donald Trump ought not to be invited in to save
cities," he told NIRR. Grey said that out of seven state elections in November,
"we won four of them. That's not bad for a group of church people." Most of
Grey's work is with secular community groups, but while sharing his strategies,
he frequently uses biblical stories and references. But fighting against gambling
has become a way for mainline churches "to re-enter the family values issue," he
said. For information on the coalition, call (708) 581-3527.

About 3,000 Christian leaders are taking a 2-year course that aims to make
their churches more effective at attracting non-believers and bringing them to
maturity in Christ. Pastors and lay leaders from 325 congregations are enrolled in
Training Network. The course is run by the Evangelical Free Church of America,
but is open to all denominations. T-NET helps congregations analyze their
current methods and offers alternative models. Participants meet six times,
pursuing tracks in leadership, education, or evangelism. The homework is to put
into practice what they've learned, Ed Pollasch of T-NET said. "This is the type
of ministry where you say, `Let's roll up our sleeves, the harvest field is white,
and let's go to work.'" For information, call 1-800-995-5362.

Compassion International has expanded its aid to impoverished American
children. The Colorado Springs child-development ministry, which assists some
140,000 children in 26 foreign countries, has been active in the United States
since the 1970s. Last fall the group expanded its U.S. ministry to include
programs on 39 Native American reservations and in inner-city areas. Plans call
for additional programs in other impoverished areas. Donations of $20 a month
are given to local churches for outreaches such as after-school programs and
tutoring. Contributions help provide Christian role models to children who face a
myriad of problems, Compassion International's Andrea Paist said. For

A former Shakespearean actor is communicating the gospel by reciting
Scripture in colleges, churches, and theaters. Dramatist Max McLean's repertoire
includes the Gospel of Mark, Acts of the Apostles, and the first 35 chapters of
the Book of Genesis. 
<BR>..."So much of the Bible was meant to be spoken," said McLean, who
heads Convent Station, N.J.-based Fellowship for the Performing Arts. Audiences
tend to become more actively involved in story-telling than in passive forms of
communication, such as television, McLean said. When that happens, "the Lord

McLean's performances range from indifference to hostility to appreciation, he
said. After performances, when asked what his own position is, McLean takes
the opportunity to explain that his "devotion is to the God behind the text." Next,
he plans to add the books of Exodus and Revelation to his repertoire.

Church members outraged by being publicly excommunicated cannot recover
damages, a Washington court ruled. Excommunication of 11 members of Korean
Presbyterian Church of Seattle -- as well as the basis for the action -- was
declared from the pulpit to the congregation, Religious Freedom Reporter said.
The court noted that the plaintiffs did not allege that the church had a malicious
intent, and said that religiously motivated conduct is privileged except where it
poses a serious risk to the health, safety, and welfare of the state.

Housing officials shut down a church outreach and tutoring program in
a Danville, Va., public housing project. They said Cathedral of Praise Assembly
of God can return, "but they can't do anything that involves the practice of religion." Tutoring sessions included Bible study and singing religious songs.
Religious freedom experts took issue: officials can forbid all outside organizations from using the community room, or they must open the door to everyone
who wants to use it, they said.

A landlord has no right to refuse to rent an apartment to an unwed couple
on religious grounds, a Chicago judge ruled. "One cannot impose one's moral or
religious beliefs on a tenant," Judge Aaron Jaffee said. 
<BR>..."I have a problem with the conduct of fornication," said the landlord, Ron
Jasniowski, who promised to appeal. Jasniowski said he was following his
religious beliefs two years ago when he refused to rent to Benson Rushing and
Mary Tews because they were not married. Rushing filed a claim with the
Chicago Commission on Human Relations, which ruled in his favor. It ordered
Jasniowski to pay $14,000 in lawyers' fees, $633 in damages, and $1 to the city.
<BR>...The decision runs counter to recent rulings in similar cases elsewhere
in the country. However, the U.S. Supreme Court in October refused to hear the
appeal of an Anchorage, Alaska, rental agent who cited his religious beliefs in
refusing to rent to unmarried couples.

A mother of five went to federal court in Oxford, Miss., to demand that her
public school system stop forcing prayers and religious instruction on her
children. The suit was filed by People for the American Way and the American
Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Lisa Herdahl, who moved last year to Ecru,
Miss., from Wisconsin. At issue are morning prayers piped into classrooms over
an intercom system, and religious studies classes. Pontotoc County school officials said the prayers are student-initiated and no one is forced to listen to them.
Herdahl said her children have been harassed for trying to opt out. She also
contends that the religious studies classes are instruction classes taught by leaders
of area churches who use the Bible as a textbook. "Prayer is something that my
children learn at home and in our church," Herdahl said. The children reportedly
attend a Pentecostal Sunday school.

It is unconstitutional for the Wabasso, Minn., school district to operate a

Minnesota Civil Liberties Union contends in a lawsuit. The district agreed last

the conservative Christian group. Their parents oppose the use of computers, TV,
and other technology in instruction. They also regard sex and drugs as topics to
be discussed at home, not in school.

John Salvi had a series of outbursts and arguments in church and with
his family in the week before he reportedly shot up three abortion clinics in two
states, killing two workers and wounding five others, Boston news agencies
reported. At a Christmas Eve mass in Seabrook, N.H., Salvi, 22, interrupted the
service with a confused harangue on "the problems of the Catholic Church and
its failures," the news accounts said. Church members and his parents escorted
him outside. As a child, Salvi had served as an altar boy at a church in Ipswich,
Mass. He spent his teen years in Naples, Fla., where the family attended St.
Ann's Catholic Church. Although the parish was not known for anti-abortion
activism, his parents took part in an annual pro-life demonstration, a "chain of
life" along the Tamiami Trail.
<BR>...Salvi returned to New England two years ago to study hair dressing.
Acquaintances called him a Bible-quoting loner who pasted pictures of fetuses on
his pickup truck. "He believed in what he read in the Bible, but he didn't follow
it himself. He was selective....He chose in his own mind what was right or
wrong," former friend Don Newton told The Washington Post. Neighbors who
entered his one-room apartment after the clinic shootings said they found a
crucifix, Bible-study materials, and literature about guns. In Norfolk, Va., where
he was captured, Salvi visited with a jail chaplain and spoke by phone with his
parents, a jail spokeswoman said.
<BR>...Abortion-rights spokespeople claim a national conspiracy exists to
commit violence at clinics, and called for investigation and greater protection.
(The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms has reported 146 incidents of arson, bombing, or shooting at abortion clinics since 1982.) In response,
President Clinton ordered the Justice Department to set up a task force on clinic
protection. He noted that people on both sides of the abortion issue have "deeply
felt beliefs," most of which are expressed peacefully.                
<P>
The federal government filed its first civil lawsuit under the Freedom of
Access to Clinic Entrances Act. It seeks unspecified monetary damages from
eight protesters who blocked access to an abortion clinic last June in Milwaukee,
Wis. The clinic also has sued. The demonstration closed the Affiliated Medical
Services facility for 90 minutes. Six of the eight defendants were the first people
charged under criminal provisions of FACE; they were convicted Nov. 15 of a
misdemeanor for a first-time non-violent offense.
<BR>...The first person convicted under the seven-month-old act was exPresbyterian minister Paul Hill (NIRR 12/12/94). He was given a life sentence
for killing a Florida abortion doctor and a bodyguard. Hill also was convicted on
state murder charges and sentenced to death. The death sentence is subject to
automatic review by the Florida Supreme Court.
<BR>...Hill, 40, hopes he is executed, he told an Associated Press interviewer last
month. He portrayed himself as a martyr whose death ultimately will save many
lives. The reporter said that Hill, when asked whether Christ would have pulled
the trigger, replied, "Absolutely."

Oregon's assisted suicide law was blocked from taking effect until a court
decides if it is constitutional (NIRR 11/28/94). A federal judge in Eugene upheld
a preliminary injunction against Measure 16, which voters had approved 51% to

doses of medicine if two doctors agreed they had less than six months to live. A
doctors' group and a pro-life group sued to block the measure.

Citing prime-time fare as perhaps the leading social concern in America,
the Media Resource Center has prepared the 1994 Parents' Guide to Prime-Time
Television Programming. Researchers viewed and evaluated every prime-time
show on the four national networks and judged them on the basis of political,
violent, and sexual content. Conservative parents will most enjoy ABC's
America's Funniest Home Videos and NBC'S The Cosby Mysteries, according to
the guide, but should avoid Fox's Melrose Place and ABC's Roseanne. The book
also contains names and addresses of network executives so parents can voice
complaints and have an effect on programming, MRC researcher James Forbes
said. The 26-page guide is sold by the MRC and will be updated twice a year.
The phone number is 1-800-672-1423.

Eight of 10 American adults believe in miracles, according to a Gallup/USA
Today/CNN TV poll. Some 79% of respondents said they believe in angels. It
was the first time Gallup asked about miracles and angels, officials said. Other
findings: 95% believe in God or a supreme being, 90% believe in heaven (up
from 84% in 1981), 73% in hell (up from 67%), and 65% in the existence of the
devil (up from 52%). Also, 27% reported belief in reincarnation (up from 21% in

Public Pulpit, a weekly cable show in Ephrata, Pa., pits liberal and conservative pastors against each other in debate over societal issues. The pastors pique

God isn't dead, He just hasn't been born yet, according to a new theory
that attempts to unify physics and religious belief. In his book, The Physics of
Immortality: Modern Cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the Dead, physicist Frank Tipler postulates that God will evolve from super computers and other
life forms. In the future, life will include not only living creatures, but computers
that will be powerful enough to achieve a state of consciousness, Tipler says. At
some point, they will meld that consciousness with other life forms until it
envelops the universe. Then, the "life" will achieve total knowledge and power
with the ability to create "everyone who has ever lived in the form of software,
and...an ideal software world -- heaven." There will be a purgatory, but not a
hell, Tipler says.

Southern Baptists blame a scarcity of adult volunteers for a 20-year
decline in baptisms among teen-agers. In 1972, almost 31% of those baptized by
the Southern Baptist Convention were teens; last year, 23% were teens, Baptist
Press reported. Even though the percentage of youths in the nation has declined,
teen baptisms have not kept pace, figures show.
<BR>...When a church hires a youth director, adults tend to think they no
longer need to be leaders in the youth ministry, said Dean Finley, SBC youth
evangelism specialist. Other reasons Finley gave for the decline in youth baptisms: no strategy for reaching youth; an attitude that young people should
determine their own religion; pastors who do not support youth ministries; and
peer pressure against religion.

Jewish day schools may be the Jewish community's best defense against
loss of its religious identity. A recent study of Jewish day-school graduates found
that only 4.5% of them have married non-Jews, compared with about 50% for
the broader Jewish community. About 190,000 pupils are enrolled in the schools,
where tuition averages $5,000-$10,000 a year, according to Religion News
Service. Hard-pressed parents are pushing for consideration of school vouchers,
long opposed by national Jewish organizations, the report said. A recent editorial
in the influential New York Jewish Week newspaper called for a review of such
opposition, suggesting that changing times may call for a change of mind.

to pray together, relationships developed, and the group now takes retreats

The murder of four Catholic priests in Algeria was part of a "campaign of
annihilation and physical liquidation of Christian crusaders," the hardline Armed
Islamic Group (GIA) announced. It claimed responsibility for the deaths as
revenge for four GIA hijackers killed in a shootout on a French Airbus jet in
Marseille. Witnesses said the priests were shot by six men with assault rifles in
a town near Algiers. Three were French priests teaching in the town. The fourth
had come from Belgium and set up an association in Algiers to improve MuslimChristian relationships. All were with the Order of White Fathers, so-named for
their robes, also known as Missionaries of Africa. They ranged in age from 36 to
75. The Order's first missionaries to Algeria in 1873 were slain by their guides.
<BR>...The killings bring to at least 75 the number of foreigners slain since
1992 in the country. Two other French Catholic missionaries were killed in May,
and two Spanish nuns were gunned down in Algiers in October.

The oldest New Testament writings ever: That is how German scholar
Carsten Thiede described three papyrus fragments containing parts of the Gospel
of Matthew. Comparing their script and style with other Greek documents, he
dated them in the last quarter of the first century. A fragment of John 18 from
the early second century long has been acknowledged as the oldest Scripture in
existence. The Matthew fragments have been preserved at a library at Oxford
University's Magdalen College since their arrival from Egypt in 1901. Thiede, of
the Institute for Basic Epistemological Research in Paderborn, Germany, published his findings in the Journal for Papyrology and Epigraphics, a German
publication. Scholars quoted by the British press did not dispute him, but said the
findings would be difficult to verify.
<BR>...The fragments show the scribe using abbreviations for Jesus' name, in
line with the Jewish custom of not writing or pronouncing the name of God.
This, Thiede said, indicates that Jesus' followers believed He was God.

Bill Gothard almost was electrocuted in Moscow late last month, but the
near-tragedy resulted in many people coming to Christ. The founder of the
Institute in Basic Life Principles was holding a microphone that was not grounded while speaking to an auditorium of people. When Gothard touched the metal
portion of a chalk easel with his other hand, electricity surged through his body
and froze him between the two objects.
<BR>...Realizing he was "in a serious situation," Gothard summoned his
"remaining strength" and lunged to the floor, he said. The frightened audience
began crying. Then, the person in charge gave an invitation for salvation. "Many,
many responded because of what they saw," Gothard said. The near-catastrophe
was "a demonstration of how brief life can be." Gothard suffered an irregular
heartbeat for a day after the accident, but said he is feeling fine now.

A judge ordered three members of
Holy Cross Catholic Church in Youngwood, Pa., to stop their loud praying of
the rosary. The disruptions occurred during Masses, baptisms, hymn-singing, and

<A NAME="THOUSANDSMORESTUDENTS,"><H3>THOUSANDS MORE STUDENTS, FACULTY EXPERIENCE REVIVAL</H3></A>
<P>
<B>The powerful, national revival that began in Brownwood, Texas, continues
to jolt American college campuses (NIRR 4/3; NIRR 3/20)</B>. Thousands more
students -- as well as some faculty and administrators -- have participated in
public confession, restitution, and reconciliation.
<BR><B>..."In 25 years of teaching I've never seen anything like this," church
historian John Woodbridge, a Trinity Evangelical Divinity School professor, told
NIRR</B>. "It is a wonderful work of the Spirit of God." Phenomena have occurred
on campuses of various sizes and denominations, but are so similar that "it is
uncanny," he said. Students are waiting in chapel lines late into the night to
publicly uncover long-hidden sins, many schools say. Students disclosed problems with bitterness, laziness, sexual immorality, pornography, alcohol, drugs,
hypocrisy, materialism, past sexual abuse, and broken families. They then
committed themselves to the Lord for forgiveness and deliverance.
<BR><B>...Professors and staff members who attend the meetings say their lives
have been changed, too</B>. "It's not just the students, but we all have come to a
fork in the road in terms of our spiritual walks," said Taylor University Provost
and Executive Vice President Daryl Yost. "We have to acknowledge the Holy
Spirit is doing a unique piece of work."
<BR><B>...Schools where revival has broken out in the last few weeks are Trinity
College and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Ill.; Asbury
College in Wilmore, Ky.; Illinois Baptist College in Galesburg, Ill.; Gordon
College in Wenham, Mass.; Eastern Nazarene College in Quincy, Mass.; Taylor
University in Upland, Ind.; Northwestern College in St</B>. Paul, Minn.; Crown
College in St. Bonifacius, Minn.; and Cornerstone College (formerly Grand
Rapids Baptist College) in Grand Rapids, Mich. 
<BR><B>...The dramatic manner in which the revival is unfolding surprised almost
everyone, but many students and faculty have been pleading with God for years
to begin a revival</B>. At Gordon College, where students and faculty had been
fasting and praying, "the kindling was stacked high" and waiting for the right
spark, one leader said. Prior to a large, scheduled chapel service, faculty and
student leaders met for prayer March 29. "The sweet stillness of God's presence
filled the room" as students began weeping and confessing sins, Dean of the
Chapel Gary Stratton told NIRR. Ironically, the meeting took place in "an upper
room" at the school as winds with gusts of 60 mph howled outside, Stratton said.
"We were waiting for tongues of fire," he joked.
<BR><B>...The revival continues to be contagious</B>. Students, chaplains, college
administrators, pastors, and Christian media have begun spreading the news.
Meetings scheduled in advance -- such as The National Student Leadership
Conference at Taylor University April 7-9, which was attended by student
leaders from 22 schools, and Beacon '95, a New England student conference
held the same days -- seemed to have been providentially timed to maximize
news of the revival, participants said. The Francis Asbury Society said requests
for its video depicting the 1970 Asbury College revival increased steadily. The
group now is sending 100 videos a week to churches, Christian colleges, campus
ministries, and Christian student organizations on secular campuses.
<BR><B>...This is not just some fad, but a genuine movement of God, those who
experience the revival say</B>. There may be a "temptation to get on the bandwagon,
but this is not the case of the majority," Taylor University's Yost said. According
to Trinity's Woodbridge, "This is not about students trying to compete with
bigger and better sins." Eastern Nazarene President Kent Hill told NIRR that
meetings he attended there have been so "awe-inspiring" that he finds it difficult
to describe them. "You feel like it's almost blasphemous to convey in words the
power that you've sensed in the remarkable openness of the students." Unlike
revivals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, "there was nothing voyeuristic
or in any sense inappropriate. Yet, clearly, students were talking about the most
important issues in their lives, those things they are most ashamed of, afraid of,
or struggling with," he said. This generation has been "so hyped," one leader
said, "that they know when something is phony and when it is real." 
<BR><B>...Although the revival touches deep emotions, it is not being driven by
emotionalism, leaders say</B>. During some services, such as one at Gordon College,
students sit in "such complete and total stillness that you would almost think they
have fallen asleep," Stratton said. Leaders agree that confessions are not being
manipulated. Stratton told students they were free to confess private sins publicly, but only sins against the community required such a confession.
<BR><B>...Follow-up is crucial, leaders say</B>. The immediate, cathartic experience of
deep, public repentance can begin long-term change for many people. "When
God does something like this, He marks people for life and they'll never be the
same again," Wheaton College Chaplain Tim Beougher told NIRR after revival
occurred there. Many students who have testified at the services say they desire
to be held accountable for living a faithful Christian life. To meet those needs,
college chaplains and deans are busy forming accountability groups and Bible
studies, and increasing the availability of psychological counseling. Eastern
Nazarene, for example, formed student groups that meet with faculty members
about specific issues such as pornography, family problems, or anger at God.
<BR><B>..."My main concern is that those who shared from the bottom of their
hearts will be ministered to in a sincere and ongoing manner," Yost said</B>. "What
do we do from this point forward? How are we going to treat individuals who
have confessed deep, deep sins?" Some of the struggles that were confessed will
take time, effort, and help to overcome, he said. It's not just someone else's
problem anymore, Yost said. "It is our problem because we were there and they
shared it with us." 
<BR><B>...The repentance and renewal being experienced on college campuses may
be a prelude to "a major movement of the Spirit," Hill said</B>. Without repentance,
revival "is blocked up." Students are "glowing over the experience" and a "mood
of anticipation" fills campuses, he said. "My hope is that pastors all over the
country will invite students into their churches to speak about reconciliation,"
Woodbridge said. "One of the things that really is holding back the evangelical
church is lack of reconciliation between members. These young people are
leading the way for reconciliation."

<B>Some 500,000 charismatic Catholics gather at the Luneta Park in Manila for

the El Shaddai message is to bring nominal Catholics to a personal relationship
with Christ through a born-again experience similar to Protestant conversions.
The group diverges from some traditional Catholic teachings, such as seeking
mediation of the saints. 
<BR><B>...In its 10 years, El Shaddai has started 900 chapters and mission centers

some 100,000 prayed to accept Christ during the Feb. 7-11 crusade.

seven local churches, mostly Pentecostal and evangelical, which distributed
follow-up materials for converts. Churches will have a hard time helping all the

and their needs, the preachers were allowed into restricted areas.
<BR><B>...The trio preached to groups of soldiers at bases, in camps along the
border, and in the trenches and foxholes, Thompson said</B>. At one meeting when
Thompson asked if anyone wanted to receive Christ, a major stood up and said,
"Yes, we do. Don't we men?" All 35 soldiers then stood up to pray. "Of course,
they weren't all sincere, but that major was," Thompson said. Thompson also

insulin. He accused the church, a Christian Science nurse, a practitioner, and
Ian's mother and stepfather of negligence. The court said the Constitution forbids
imposing punitive damages on a church because of what it teaches. However, the
court retained compensatory damages of $1.5 million.

<B>The International Pentecostal Holiness Church shifted its philosophy of
ministry "from the hierarchical to a servant model," leaders said</B>. "The church's
elected leaders are merely facilitators," said Bishop B.E. Underwood, general
superintendent of the denomination. Last month's conference of 450 pastors and
church leaders and 250 wives in Fort Mill, S.C., was called the most significant
event in the denomination's nearly 100-year history.

<B>A city festival may exclude religious speakers, the Colorado Court of
Appeals said</B>. Terry Brandon was not entitled to open a booth or otherwise
participate at the annual Springspree because the Colorado Springs festival has a
strict policy excluding political, religious, ideological, and social issues. Festival
organizers can exclude conduct that is contrary to the purpose for holding the
event, the court said, according to Religious Freedom Reporter.

<B>A school district must treat religious organizations the same as nonreligious organizations when it leases school buses, a court ruled</B>. The Supreme
Court of New York decided in favor of St. James Church of Cazenovia. The
church sued the public school board after it refused to lease buses for students to
travel to church released-time religious education classes. Refusing a lease based
on the religious viewpoint of the program is discrimination, the court said.

<B>Critics say money means more than morality to the Walt Disney Co</B>. The
controversy swirls around Miramax Films, a New York distributor Disney bought
two years ago. Miramax was set to release the controversial movie Priest
nationwide on Good Friday, but Disney, reacting to complaints by Catholics,
ordered a delay until April 19. However, the film already is showing in some
major markets. It is about five fictional priests, two of whom are sexually active
-- a homosexual and a heterosexual.
<BR><B>..."The most lurid, disgusting, diabolical film I have ever seen" is the way
Judie Brown, president of the American Life League, described Priest</B>. She is
spearheading a boycott of Disney movies, videos, and theme parks. Some 40

<B>Time-Warner "is doing the most to lower standards and further degrade"
American culture, Universal Press Syndicate columnist John Leo wrote</B>. The
company is the corporate sponsor of much of the offensive, degrading and
intellectually low entertainment in America today, he said. He cited the Jenny
Jones television show, infamous after a guest who was embarrassed on the show
allegedly killed his humiliator; Madonna's book Sex, featuring lewd poses of the
singer; the movie Natural Born Killers, which depicted graphic violence and
murder; and musicians whose lyrics "pump nihilism into the culture."                               
<BR><B>...Leo's remarks are right on target said American Family Association
founder and President Don Wildmon, a vociferous critic of the media industry</B>.
Time-Warner "is motivated by greed and is without morals," he said. Wildmon,
a Methodist, also pointed out that the United Methodist Board of Pensions owns
Time-Warner stock and refused to divest when he asked them to in 1991. The
UMC said it will not sell its 224,260 shares of stock, but will continue trying to
influence Time-Warner policies through dialogue.

last year, the Washington, D.C.-based Media Research Council reported</B>. MRC
said there were twice as many references to religion, and religion was portrayed
positively 44% of the time as compared with negatively 23% of the time. In
1993, negative mentions outnumbered positive ones 56% to 26%. In 1994, CBS
led positive portrayals with 55%. Others: Fox, 46%; NBC, 38%; ABC, 36%.

<B>Schools must teach ethics along with academics, beginning at the elementary level, the Princeton, N.J.-based Carnegie Foundation said</B>. In a landmark
study of schools released this month, Carnegie President Ernest Boyer said
schools often are hesitant to do so because of ideological controversies and fear
of violating church-state policies. But the result is students confused about what
behavior and conduct is expected, he said. "And sadly, the vacuum is being filled
with negative signals." Although public schools can't teach religion, they can
teach about religion's influence throughout history, Boyer said. He pointed to a
coalition of 275 schools in St. Louis that worked with parents to develop teachable ethics, including honesty, responsibility, cooperation, and commitment. A
copy of The Basic School is available for $10 by calling 1-800-777-4726.

<B>MAFnet, a private online e-mail service, helps missionaries and relief
agencies in remote areas communicate</B>. Begun by Mission Aviation Fellowship in
January, the service has attracted 700 members in the past four months. It's a
"natural fit with what we do in technology already," said MAF spokesperson
Karla Lenderink, referring to the radio communications link MAF has established
among missionaries. Missionaries who need supplies, logistical support, or
medical treatment, can communicate via radio to MAF, which then helps coordinate resources and provide logistical help. With MAFnet, the agencies can
communicate and coordinate among themselves, Lenderink said. For missionaries
without phone lines, MAF has radio modems that transmit signals to a highfrequency receiver. MAF airplanes still will provide the logistical help missionaries need. For information about MAFnet, call (909) 794-1151.

<B>The number of college students coming to Christ as a result of Assemblies
of God ministries nearly doubled in the last two years</B>. A total of 924 students
became believers in the 1993-1994 school year, according to Bob Marks, a
national leader of Chi Alpha, the denomination's campus ministry. In 1992-1993,
497 came to Christ. Some 5,500 Chi Alpha students are active on 174 campuses.
<BR><B>..."It is phenomenal what God is doing," Marks said</B>. Trying to reach
Generation X for Christ has been a challenge, but evangelistic efforts are bearing
fruit, he said. Students "have a lot to offer the body of Christ," he said. Southern
Illinois University chapter of Chi Alpha has seen wonderful "moves of God in
their midst," Marks said. Most members there are foreigners, so "students from
around the world are coming to Christ." Many students, including athletes, have
been saved as a result of the ministry of the Chi Alpha group at Southwest
Louisiana State University. Baptismal services in the swimming pool there have
been "a great testimony to those doing laps," Marks said.

also is her manager, attends each concert, and the family of nine travels to her
concerts that are within a 10-hour drive. St. James keeps Wednesdays open to

<B>A district in the Indian state of Orissa erupted into violence after the
arrests of American and Indian Christians and the ouster of a Hindu mayor</B>.
Radical Hindus vented their anger in retaliation for the removal from office of
the Hindu mayor of Badapada, who supported their causes. K. Anand Paul of
Gospel to the Unreached Millions, a Houston-based outreach to Indians, told
NIRR that the mayor had canceled a March 28 Christian crusade planned for
Badapada and arrested its leaders. He feared the spread of Christian fervor after
another crusade, in neighboring Andhra Pradesh, drew more than 400,000 people.
At that crusade, 52,461 agreed to be baptized and join the church, and many
were miraculously healed of blindness and deafness, Paul and American layman
Doug Dodson said.
<BR><B>...The Hindu mayor reluctantly agreed to allow a ministers' seminar to
take place in a nearby Baptist church</B>. But when reports of healings in the
seminar spread, and thousands of citizens gathered outside the church, police
arrested the pastors and began beating the crowd with sticks, wounding 100
people, Dodson said. At least seven police were wounded. Police arrested nine
American and 35 Indian Christians, Dave Yanez of GUM said.
<BR><B>...During their six-day imprisonment, the Christians witnessed to their
guards, 10 of whom accepted Christ</B>. One guard prayed with "one hand holding
mine and the other holding a bayonet," Dodson said. Under pressure from Paul
and the U.S. Embassy, Orissa Chief Minister J.B. Patnaik, a Hindu, ordered the
Christians released and paid their $30,000 bail with government funds. After the
Americans left the country, the mayor reinstated the arrest warrants for the
former prisoners. Patnaik then had the mayor transferred, resulting in the Hindu
demonstrations.
<BR><B>...Paul, who has received death threats, asked for prayers for his life and
"for the Indians who can't run anywhere." He also asked for contributions for
equipment lost in the melee</B>. To help, call GUM at (713) 324-4451.

<B>An Egyptian Christian was imprisoned for four months after returning to
the country from religious exile in Nairobi, Kenya</B>. Ibrahim Ali Mohammed
Sharaf el-Din was charged April 9 with giving false information against Islam to
Kenyan journalists. He and his family converted from Islam 12 years ago, News
Network International reported. Since converts from Islam suffer persecution, elDin and his wife were baptized secretly. The family emigrated to Nairobi and
applied for religious asylum there after el-Din was fired, his life was threatened,
and his children were denied admission to school. Although their application was
approved in 1994, he was unable to find work in Nairobi and returned to Cairo
to seek employment in October. He was arrested as he stepped off the plane.

<B>A former seminary student alleged that Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer,
head of the Catholic Church in Austria, sexually abused him repeatedly in the
early 1970s</B>. Groer, 75, was a seminary instructor at the time. His accuser, Josef
Hartmann, 37, said he was 17 when it happened. Hartmann told reporters he
decided to go public after Groer issued a recent statement. In it, Groer said those
who abuse children would not inherit heaven. Groer denied the abuse charges,
but resigned as chairman of the bishops' conference. Catholic leaders pledged to
carry out a full investigation.

<B>Catholic politicians who back abortion, even reluctantly, bear a greater
responsibility before God than do women who undergo the procedure, Vatican
leaders said</B>. The question of whether they should be excommunicated is open to
debate, they suggested. They made their comments at a news conference in
Rome after the release of Pope John Paul II's new encyclical, Evangelium Vitae
(The Gospel of Life). The 194-page document brands abortion and euthanasia as
evils that no law can justify. It called for active nonviolent opposition to both. It
also condemned contraception and the death penalty.
<BR><B>...The encyclical dismissed claims by politicians who say they oppose
abortion, but are compelled by their position to uphold laws allowing it</B>. Politicians cannot renounce their consciences when they take on legislative duties, the
pope said. Critics accused the pope of encouraging widespread civil disobedience, in contradiction of biblical teachings.

<B>"Casino gambling can destroy the heart and soul of a city," said Joseph
Napolitan, a political consultant who was instrumental in bringing casino gambling to Atlantic City</B>. In 1976, Napolitan designed a strategy that won passage
of a referendum allowing casino gambling in Atlantic City. That was the worst
mistake of his career, he said in an article appearing in a publication of Citizens
Against Casino Gambling.
<BR><B>...Atlantic City started with one casino, but now has 11</B>. Within three years,
the city's crime rate tripled, going from 50th in the nation per capita to first,
Napolitan said. Forty percent of local restaurants closed, the number of homeless
people increased by 2,000%, property values dropped, and almost 200 homes of
people who refused to sell their property to casinos were destroyed in arsonrelated fires. More people went on welfare and shelters were jammed. 
<BR><B>...Napolitan described today's Atlantic City as two distinct cities</B>. Tourists
see the glittering hotels, fancy entertainment, and inexpensive meals, which keep
them from leaving the casino. But a few blocks away is the Atlantic City of
those who live there: "seedy, dirty, and dangerous," he said.

Our names are Guy Hodges and Stella Person.<BR> The job that God has laid on our hearts is to minister to the needs<BR> of one of the largest penal systems in the world.(T.D.C.J.) The Texas<BR> Dept. of Criminal Justice, it consist of 120,000 inmates with salvation and <BR> christian needs. Since starting with a small Christian Newsletter, called<BR> Pen Pals for God News, We have been able to reach many, and have seen Gods <BR> hand at work in their lives. The reason for submiting this article is to let <BR> the public know the importance of this ministry, and to ask if there is any<BR> one that has a loved one or friend presently incarcerated that may be in need<BR> of this Christian Ministry. Although our ministry doesnt stop there, <BR> We believe in ministering to those that are having difficulties facing<BR> everyday fears of having a loved one behind the wire. The compelling purpose<BR> of Pen Pals for God News is to let you the reader see how God is working in the <BR> lives of others, and to give you the chance to correspond with each <BR> other. This also gives the opportunity for salvation, and prayer request,<BR> so we can be in one accord with God. If you have a prayer request, and<BR> would like it to be listed, send it to Pen Pals for God News, 2300 Carol Good Ln.<BR> Carrollton, Texas 75006.<BR>                               Your Brother and Sister in Christ Jesus<BR>                                      Guy Hodges & Stella Person<BR><BR>

<tr><td><FONT SIZE=-1>Dear Fellow Saint,<BR><BR>I am a born again Christian, 18 years now, a member of the ICCC and have been  an associate pastor in Sydney Australia for the last 9 years. Last year I received a series of visions which I would like to share with you.<BR><BR>The visions relate to a GLOBAL NETWORK the Lord is raising up for the last day harvest. It is an inter-linked body of Christian businesses, missionary agencies and churches working together. <BR><BR>Much of the vision relates to the organisation and the name of this global network<BR><BR>I have been looking for such a global network that I believe the Lord is raising up but to my dismay have not found anything close to it. If you have similar promptings, please write to me.<BR><BR><BR>I look forward to hearing from you as I believe it is time for me to unload what I have been carrying in my heart for the last year. I can be contacted by Email ( vgate@apic.net ) or by fax (61-2-9623-1816). Thank You.<BR>In His Love,<BR>Gerard Schokman<BR><BR>

<tr><td><FONT SIZE=-1>Discipleship / Education Pastor:  dynamic, non-demoninational church seeking a gifted leader/teacher.  Last year we moved into our brand new 32,000 sq ft worship facility and attendance is rapdily growing.  Our congregation needs a steady diet of sound doctrine (taught on campus) and multiple opportunities to join discipleship small groups.  We seek an energetic leader to develop the teams necessary to meet educational needs.  This position will become a member of our management team.  Will also share some pulpit responsibilites.  Seminary training a must.

<tr><td><FONT SIZE=-1>Walcott Baptist Church in Walcott Arkansas is trying to help Digos Baptist Church in Davao del Sur, Philippines purchase a Jeepny(small Church Bus) to transport the elderly, children and disabled to services. They are currently running the large route on a Moped designed for four people. The motor often doesnt work and so the Moped must be pedaled. Often several extra people are trying to hang onto the sides. Digos Pastor, Bro. Salvador T. Solana Sr., has been blessed with a growing though poor congregation and I understand some 19 smaller missions to help support. Walcott Baptist is a small Church but has contributed more than $1,000. Please send donations, no matter how small, to: Pennies for the Philippines, C/O Larry Clifford, P.O. Box 51, Walcott, AR  72474. Make checks payable to Walcott Baptist Church Jeepny Fund.

Download a free demo from the Integrity web site (below) or call for a free disk.  If youre in a small church, dont conclude that its too powerful for you.

At present I am an Engineer, with 9 years of college including 2 in Bible college and 1 in a seminary.  Im fundamental but not legalistic, charismatic or pentecostal. Both of us were raised in MN.  <BR>     My wife and I have made ouselves available to the Lords work in prayer and are both seeking and questioning each other and ourselves about this.  We attend a great non-denominational church where it is refreshing and enjoyable. <BR>We are thinking about ministry with Youth for Christ, Christian radio, Trans World radio and maybe even Pastoral work.  Prefer non-denominational involvement.  Enjoy teaching and preaching the Word, counseling, and the great outdoors.  The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.

I have opened for  Kirk Franklin, James Hall, Ricky Dillard and the New Generation Chorale, and Donald Lawrence and the Tri-City Singers. I believe that music ministry restores the broken-hearted and should not be used for entertainment. If you agree, and would like me to minister at your church or concert, please give me a call. My telephone number is (407) 635-9437. I am also a certified evangelist. Ministry in music is what saves souls.<BR>

<tr><td><FONT SIZE=-1>E-Mail To Fax Conversion - Missionaries Can Send E-Mail That Will Arrive in Friends, Supporters, and Prayer Partners Fax Machine<BR><BR>A fax broadcasting service is being proposed for missionaries around the world with e-mail access so that their friends, supporters, and prayer partners in the United States without e-mail access can still receive frequent and timely updates on day-to-day activities.  The missionary would simply e-mail the information as frequently as the Spirit leads to HQH computer services.  No cost is incurred by the missionary for this service. HQH computer services would convert e-mail to a fax and send it to the missionarys subscription list through automated fax broadcasting technology.  This subscription list would be fax numbers of friends and supporters in the USA who have signed up for an agreed monthly fee as subscribers to the missionarys reports.<BR>    The missionary will be provided a monthly list of subscribers, via e-mail, to continually remind him/her of the number of potential people praying through their daily needs.  It is a tremendous encouragement for missionaries just to know that people are praying for them about immediate concerns.

<tr><td><FONT SIZE=-1><BR><BR>Do you know someone who has an angry child? I have written a book entitled How to Help Angry Kids.   This 231 page volume is a biblical resource manual for parents of children who are characterologically angry.  Such children have so learned and practiced angry responses to the problems of life, that they have developed the characteristics of the angry man spoken of in the Bible;  an angry man stirs up strife. . .  (Proverbs 29:22). Angry kids are children who have habituated themselves to speak, act, think and be motivated like the angry man in the Bible, who was so filled with passion that God classifies him by the name of the sin that has overtaken him.<BR><BR>Here is what Dr. Jay E. Adams has written in the preface of the book.<BR><BR>Lou Priolo has written an eminently readable, practical book about a problem frequently encountered but rarely addressed.  It is a book whose time is due. And he has done so basing his work on biblical principles and practices.  Every nouthetic counselor will want his own copy as well as some to give away or lend.  Pastors will put it in their church bookstores.  Parents will devour the book.  Christian children will benefit from it, and the Church in general will be indebted to Lou for writing it.  Liberals will loathe it and psychologists will pooh pooh it.  There is nothing else like it; I expect it to do much good.<BR>

<H3>Continued Border Problems; Great S.W. Report</H3>
Excerpted from ENNFAX, Vol. 2, No. 100, 04/09/96
<P>
<B>Southwest United States...</B>
<P>
ENN has received some intelligence from the southwest portion
of the United States.  The United States Border Patrol is now
reporting that several hundred illegal immigrants are now
entering the U.S. through Douglas, Arizona, instead of Nogales,
Arizona, which now has steel fences and an increase in personnel
guarding that area.
<P>

Shooting targets have been found hung to a fence along the U.S./Mexico
border.  The targets depict the head of a caucasian (officer/agent?) with many
holes shot through it.  This is being thought of as a warning
to Border personnel.
<P>

A highly secretive anti-narcotics team has discovered that their
identities may be known to drug dealers.  Even though great care
has been taken to keep the identities of the agents secret, highly
sophisticated transmitters have been found underneath their vehicles.
<P>

Border problems continue to escalate, with threats coming from both drug dealers
and those trafficking in illegal immigrants.

The Emergency Response and Research Institute (ERRI) issued
the following situation report on Monday morning, in regards to
the continuing circumstances that are happening in Jordan, Montana.
ERRI counter-terrorist (CT) analysts are monitoring this ongoing
situation very closely.

<H3>RE: Sit-Rep: Reports of Militia Movement to Assist FREEMEN in Montana</H3>

ENN has received reports that AZ Patriots are ready to go to Montana
and some are already on the road. Michigan Miltia is already driving to
MT. Butler's Aryan Nation is in a convoy from Idaho to MT. Several Mid
West groups like Posse and Barter and Grain Assn have offered help in
the way of food and ,etc.
<P>

Unorganized Militia of US, Militia of MT, Northern Michigan Militia,
Guardians of American Liberties, TX Constitutional Militia, FL State
Militia, Ohio Unorganized Militia are contacting each other to
volunteer to help "save the Freemen" from Federal Agents.
<P>
The arrival of additional activists in the Jordan area can only complicate an 
already difficult and delicate task for the FBI and local law enforcement agencies. 
It is all too likely that their presence will aggravate the multitude of problems facing those attempting to resolve the incident in a peaceful manner.
<P>

Intelligence sources fear that the Freemen have reviewed the
Waco/Weaver videos and know the Feds M.O. They are said to be scanning
the police radios, have generators, numerous weapons, and stocks of
food.  Allegedly, the Freemen have supporters in a number of states,
and have cultivated new backers with their frequent lectures on tax
protesting and Constitutional Law. They also are said to believe in
separation of races and not just blind racism. The theory of the "Tri
State Movement" is one of their ideas (they borrowed). They also
allegedly have contact with the Bo Gritz commune.
<P>

Concerns are being raised among counter-terrorist analysts that the
Freemen's objective is continue the stand-off until April 19th
(anniversary of Waco, Ruby Ridge, and Oklahoma City), at which time a
more open confrontation or other major event could occur.
<P>

Feel free to contact ENN/ERRI for further information on extremist
organzations/operations.

<H3>01/26/96--Check Those Self Storage Lockers; Drugs and Explosives</H3>
<img align=middle src="newbutn.gif">In the years I wrote for SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT (about 5) I constantly warned of terrorists and drug dealers using the rental spaces to store explosive compounds, firearms and narcotics. Even though it became well known from the World Trade Center bombing analysis, most police departments did not launch any surveillances or raid probably storage sites.
<P>
A few days after the World Trade Center attack, many storage areas were clean with the renters moving large amounts of C 4 and SEMTEX to other unknown places of concealment. The same was true of the firearms.
<P>
In Tucson, the police finally decided to do walk throughs of storage area with narcotic dogs and vast amounts of drugs and ingredients were located. However most IDs used to rent the storage were faked. It makes one wonder what might have been found if the police had looked for explosives earlier ! Instead of explosives, crates and wrapping paper containing PETN and RDX residue were found but no bulk munitions.
<P>
In just a walk through of one storage center, dogs hit on 15 or so doors. AND this is one self storage center in a city that has nearly 100 such centers.
<P>
On a military base, campers and recreational vehicles were stored for personnel on TDYs and on remote assignments. Several dogs from the military dog sections made hits for drugs and explosives in vehicles on base property! Some munitions brought back from the Gulf War, Panama, and UN duties were also located in active condition.
<P>
In US domestic terrorist handbooks and militia documents they all state that weapons and explosive compounds should be stored in self storage centers. Many times maps of potential target sites are stored with the explosives.

<H3>01/19/96--Reports of Increased Terrorist Dangers</H3>
ENN is receiving reports of an increased threat of terrorism against the United States, in the wake of the recent (01/18/96) life sentencing of Sheik Abdel Rahman and his nine co-conspirators in the World Trade Center and subsequent "Urban Terror" attacks.
<P>
Reportedly, Islamic extremists are portraying Rahman as a "martyr" to the world-wide Islamic cause and urging "jihad" against America and her allies.  Islamic radicals are reportedly speaking out in Mosques in several countries and "fatwas" (religious orders) have allegedly been issued to exact revenge against America for its conviction and detainment of the fiery Moslem cleric.
<P>
Intelligence reports suggest that Weapons and explosives in Europe and the US are being readied for use, and that an increase in hostile message traffic has been noted in the past 48 hours.  Counter-surviellance equipment and metal detectors are reported being used to safeguard certain mosques.  The possibilities of demonstrations and protests in Egypt, Isreal, and the US are increased.
<P>
A threat of hijacking or hostage-taking and subsequent negotiations to trade hostages for Rahman and his followers is a possible scenario being considered by leading counter-terrorist analysts. US airports and carriers have been alerted and it is believed that they have gone to an increased level of alert.
<P>
Caution and vigilance is being urged in regard to US embassies, businesses, and government facilities, particularly those in Europe, the Mideast, and Far East.  US law enforcement and intelligence gathering units should be aware of possible threats involving Islamic Centers/Personnel in their area of operations.

<H3>Denver Police Form Special Squad to Investigate Firebombings</H3><img align=middle src="newbutn.gif">
A special police/fire investigation squad is being formed in Denver to investigate and attempt to prevent gang-related firebombings.  The squad is being formed in response to three separate incidents this week of molotov cocktails being used in an ongoing gang war in East Denver.
<P>
According to Lt. Joe Sarconi of the Denver Arson squad, the three firebombings come in the wake of more than 51others that occurred in 1995, including 33 that are believed to be gang revenge related. "It's only a matter of time...if this keeps up..that somebody is going to get killed," Lt. Sarconi told the Scripps-McClatchy News service.

The Denver reports follow similar stories from several other jurisdictions, including Chicago, New York City, Dayton, OH, Rochester, NY, Los Angeles, CA, and several other locations. This trend was first reported by ENN in Oct. of 1994.

<LI><H3>"Roofies and Other Assorted Drugs"-01/04/95</H3>
I work drug interdiction on IH10 in southeast Texas. We frequently stop persons who have gone to Mexico to pick up prescription medicine. Two of the most common drugs that we find are (#1) Valium (blue tablet with Roche imprinted on it, 10mg, picture is not in the PDR and a pharmacist may not be able to ID it) and (#2)  rohyphnol ("roofies", small white tablet, I think they are 3mg). Federal Law allows someone to have a prescription filled at a Mexican pharmacy, but only if they have a prescription by a U.S. doctor. In practice Customs (at least in Texas) allows someone to bring across a 90 day supply of prescription medicine if they declare it at the border, it does not matter which country the doctor's prescription is from. Maybe some of the Customs Officers on the list can explain this procedure in better detail.
<P>
Rohypnol is used in Latin American countries as an anesthesia during surgery. American Police Beat recently had an article about "roofies". Persons under the influence of "roofies" appear to be highly intoxicated and exhibit the usual signs of intoxication (bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, no coordination, swaying, etc.) however there is no odor of an alcoholic beverage.
<P>
Locally we have had a couple of rape cases where "roofies" were used. The victim cannot remember what happened. If the "roofies" were slipped into a drink at a bar and the rapist left the bar with the victim witnesses would think the the victim was intoxicated. Abuse of rohyphnol appears to be on the increase in this area and from what I am hearing in other areas of the country as well.
<P>
Since Customs allows someone to enter the country with a 90 day supply of these prescription medicines we usually take no action against them as long as they were declared at the border (the prescription will be stamped). If they have too many pills then we will seize the pills and submit the case to our local DA for prosecution. 2 weeks ago I seized 2700 valium (along with 45 "roofies" and other drugs) and am waiting to see if the DA takes the case. The pills were going to the Tenn./Georgia border area with a street value of $4.00 to $5.00 per pill.

<LI><H4>Major Increase in Use of "Speed"</H4>
<BR>
Nov 30, 1995 (CDC) - CDC (Center For Disease Control) officials Thursday reported a nearly 300% increase in deaths related to use of the illegal drug methamphetamine, with the biggest increase occurring in Western U.S..  The drug, on the street, is commonly know as "crystal," "crank," "meth," "go" or "uppers."  It is usually provided in pill form, but can be inhaled. The CDC said the number of amphetamine-related deaths, reported by medical authorities in 42 metropolitan areas, nearly tripled between 1991 and 1994. During the same three years, amphetamine-related emergency room visits at reporting hospitals rose from 4,900 to 17,400.
<P> 
The increase has primarily occurred in California but has also been reported in the South and Midwest, according to CDC researchers. The biggest increases in hospital E.R. visits related to the drug occurred in Phoenix, Denver, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Seattle, the agency said. California accounts for 80 percent of the total increase in admissions. but they more than doubled in Washington, Utah, Minnesota and Idaho. In some areas, "speed" has become more popular than cocaine because it is easy to find, inexpensive, and offers both a more immediate and longer effect than cocaine. Emergency Responders should use extreme caution when dealing with persons using methamphetamines, as a history of violent behavior surrounds the abuse of the drug.

<LI><H4>'ILLY' found in Connecticut; Toxic Drug</H4>
<P>
Connecticut State Police seized 18 bags of a green leafy substance
identified as ILLY at a traffic stop early summer.  ILLY is a mixture of
marajuana and or mint leaves which is usually soaked in formaldehyde
and PCP (angel dust).  ILLY can cause dizziness, nausea, euphoria.
violent beha vior, convulsions, brain damage, hallucinations and death.
The troop ers who handled the evidence developed a light headed feeling,
nausea and had to leave the room.  They felt the effects of the
substance for at least two days.  Normally ILLY is kept frozen until
the time of sale.  Once the substance begins to thaw it emits a strong
chemical odor that has a strong negative effect on people.  EXTREME
CAUTION should be exercised if you suspect that you are dealing with
ILLY.  Officers should avoid handling,inhaling or allowing contact with
their skin.

<LI><H4>Potential IRS Attacks</H4><BR>
Around Phoenix and Tucson spray painted slogans of "UP THE IRS" have appeared. Local police believe this is a gang related symbol however these same slogans were found in LA  in the surrounding areas of the IRS building. Such signs near Olympic and Colby Ave in LA preceeded the placement of a vehicle bomb in Feb 1990 and another device again in LA. The bomber was found to be a hostile former government worker who had his job eliminated (how many of those do you think there are now).  Apparently the UP THE IRS group (?) has moved eastward into AZ. Source: Paul Copher, Analyst At Large.

<LI><H4>Mir Aimal Kansi, aka Mir Aimal Kasi</H4>
Born: 10 February 1964, Pakistan
<P>
On January 25, 1993 Mir Aimal Kansi murdered two persons and permanently injured three others, outside CIA HQ. He attacked without warning or provocation, shooting his AK-47 assault rifle into cars waiting at a stoplight. The attack occurred during morning rush hour traffic. Kansi fled the United States immediately after the attack and is now a fugitive. Last possible known location was Afganistan.
<P>
The United States Department of State is offering a reward of up to
$2,000,000 for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of Kansi.  Private citizens and organizations in the United States are offering substantial additional reward money. The identity of anyone providing information will be held in the strictest confidence.
<P>
If you have information about Kansi, contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. In the U.S., call 1-800-HEROES-1. Or write: HEROES P.O. Box 96781 Washington, D.C. 20090-6781 U.S.A. All identities are kept strictly confidential. Internet: heroes@clark.net

<LI><H4>'Wrong House Number'</H4>
<P>
An AZ SWAT unit cost its city 850,000 dollars when they raided the wrong home in a drug search. Seems like the "narco terrorists" turned out to be a retired old man and his wife who both had mild heart attacks after being thrown to the floor and cuffed. Someone forgot to take a photo of the real home the warrant was good for. Many actual drug sellers paint the wrong house numbers on their homes, finding it makes a loophole in court.

<A NAME="Jump 1"><H4>Company History</H4>

The EMERGENCY RESPONSE & RESEARCH INSTITUTE (ERRI), of Chicago, IL, was founded to provide uncomplicated solutions to complex and demanding problems.  Late in 1990, ERRI undertook a vastly different approach to providing news, information, research and communications services to the emergency response community.  The EMERGENCY Bulletin Board System (BBS) went on-line on January 15, 1991 with a computer database retrieval service.
<P>  

The system was a direct result of a nation-wide survey conducted among Emergency Medical Service (EMS) managers, who overwhelmingly expressed support for the idea.  Within six months, due to popular demand, it was expanded to include fire, police, and disaster services.  Soon it was also evident that we should include medical, military, rescue and other related topics.  Several other related professions and subjects have been added.
<P>

Since our humble beginnings, the both the content and the capabilities of the system have been upgraded, to provide one of the nation's most comprehensive database systems, designed to serve the emergency response community.

<BR>
Besides Internet, BBS, communications, and advertising services, ERRI is
also a leading emergency service consulting and education institution. We directly provide training, management advice, and on-scene consulting services and have become a major resource for the provision of educators/speakers for conferences. It is anticipated that ERRI will begin an internship program for both journalism and emergency management personnel during 1996.

<BODY>
<IMG SRC="/ENN3D.GIF">
<P>
EmergencyNet NEWS (ENN) is one of the nation's premier
electronic news services that covers only Fire/Police/EMS/
Disaster/Medical/Military topics. The editorial staff of ENN is
primarily composed of experienced emergency/military personnel with a
minimum of 15 years of service in some of the nation's leading
agencies. ENN is also the reporting arm of the
Chicago-based Emergency Response & Research Institute (ERRI). 
ERRI is an emergency service "think-tank" that studies issues,
germane to the emergency response and military communities  Some
typical examples of on-going coverage include:
<P>                  
The Oklahoma City Bombing.
<BR>                                                                              
Emergency Services Suicides
<BR>                                                                               
The Tokyo Earthquake and Poison Gas Attacks
<BR>
Terrorist Bombings in Israel
<BR>
A Virtual Disaster Network
<BR>
<HR>               
<P>     
News Gathering
<BR>
ENN obtains its news from a large variety of sources.  Many of
them are computer-based, but the most accurate and timely
involve actual reports by emergency responders themselves.  ENN
operates a national "hot-line" (at 312-631-ERRI), where
firefighters, police officers, and EMTs can call with real-time
reports regarding on-going emergencies.  We also subscribe to a
number of Internet news groups and other news services.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
News Dissemination
<BR>
ENN is published in a variety of ways, both electronically and
in "hard copy".  It's primary route of distribution is by fax,
with a large number of deliveries also made by Internet mail. It
is also available in a monthly summary that is prepared in
multimedia format on a floppy disk, for presentation on your IBM
or compatible computer. It is then immediately distributed to
more than fifty (50) TV stations, newspapers, radio stations,
emergency magazines and wire services. Additionally, ENN is
currently distributed directly to more than twenty (20) major
emergency response/government agencies.  Our exclusive "daily
report" summaries are disseminated every evening by either fax
or on the Internet.

<font color="#008000"><font size=5><strong>PENTAGON PLANNERS RETHINK GLOBAL STRATEGY ...</strong></font></font><br>
<br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
About eight years ago, the Pentagon's worst war scenario was the Red Army marching through the heart of Western 
Europe. But since the fall of the Soviet Union, the U.S. military has had to rethink its strategy. Right now, the worse case 
scenario is the outbreak of two wars at the same time -- one in the Middle East and the other on the Korean Peninsula.<br>
<br>
The yardstick that Pentagon planners have use to configure the size, structure and budgets of post-Cold War forces is the 
ability to fight and, of course, win two &quot;nearly simultaneous&quot; wars in different areas of world. There is no other country that 
even comes close to even considering such a strategy.<br>
<br>
But the United States is the world's last remaining superpower. Besides looking out for its own national interest, the U.S. 
also looks out for the best interest of its allies.<br>
<br>
The question with what is called the two major regional conflict (MRC) strategy is -- can the Pentagon really handle the 
load if it became necessary to do so? Since the Pentagon is now preparing a study on the subject -- the strategy is being 
debated in the world's largest office building.<br>
<br>
The Congressionally mandated review is to be completed by May. This will be the third such review by the Pentagon since 
1992. The study is intended to serve as the military's blueprint for protecting the interests of the U.S. well into the 21st 
century.<br>
<br>
The big question that Congress will be asking is -- should the U.S. retain the two-MRC strategy? By keeping the strategy, 
the quadrennial defense review (QDR) will not call for any major changes in the U.S. defense policy. But should the study 
call for any sweeping changes, this will affect the size, shape and tactics of U.S. forces.<br>
<br>
Analysts at the Chicago-based Emergency Response and Research Institute say that Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and China 
pose the greatest threats to U.S. geopolitical interests in the short-term future. <i>It is the belief of ERRI analysts that no 
change in the basic strategy is needed, at this time.</i><br>
<br>
There are, however, experts inside the government that say the QDR should incorporate cost-saving cutbacks combined 
with the innovative uses of advanced technologies to ensure the United States remains the number one military power in 
the world.<br>
<br>
ERRI analysts dispute that idea vehemently. What the experts who want to see a reduction in the Pentagon's budget are 
really saying is to cut back on the number of personnel and rely more heavily on the technological superiority the U.S. 
military has in its weapons.<br>
<br>
That strategy has not historically worked in other fields. An example would be with the Central Intelligence Agency. There 
was a time, in the past, that an emphasis was placed more on technological intelligence collecting rather than on HUMINT 
(Human Intelligence). this policy proved disastrous. HUMINT resources, in some countries, fell to zero. (Iran, at the time 
of U.S. Embassy takeover, is an example.)<br>
<br>
Smart bombs and excellent jet fighters cannot hold ground. Manpower is needed and will always be needed. There are 
plans to reduce the number of soldiers that is required to secure and hold territory by the assistance of superior 
technology. But these plans are still, at the very least, about ten to 15 years away.<br>
<br>
Andrew Krepinevich of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and Budgetary analysis said, &quot;It takes a long time to 
transform a military organization. It takes a long time to research, test and develop new systems, the doctrine of how to 
use them and to restructure the forces.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The QDR is not about protecting today's force,&quot; said Deputy Defense Secretary John White. &quot;It is rather about shaping 
tomorrow's force. Everything is on the table.&quot;<br>
<br>
White is one of those experts who believes that the two-MRC has outlived its usefulness. He has said, in recent speeches, 
that the current U.S. military strategy fails to take into account the peacekeeping and non-traditional operations that the 
U.S. military now undertakes. It is his contention that the QDR should suggest more ways for U.S. forces to adapt to 
more non-traditional missions.<br>
<br>
White's plan to adapt to more non-traditional missions is sure to meet some resistance at the Pentagon and other branches 
of government where the &quot;peacekeeping&quot; missions and such are very unpopular. However, these types of missions have 
proven to be popular in some areas of the current U.S. administration.<br>
<br>
Robert Bell, a senior National Security Council official. said, &quot;We don't have the option in the Quadrennial Defense 
Review of saying we'll just take out of the strategy one of the MRCs to save money. Not only was the decision right when 
it was made, it's not clear to me ... today that the world has changed ... in terms of a two-MRC requirement.&quot;<br>
<br>
Even if the current administration doesn't want to change the two-MRC strategy, it probably will be compelled to make 
some changes in the policy by the end of Clinton's next term that will end in the year 2000. It is believed that the U.S. will 
field a smaller force and rely on greater participation of U.S. allies in any major combat operation.<br>
<br>
The last two reviews that were conducted in 1992 and 1993 embraced the two-MRC strategy while, at the same time, 
reduced the size of the armed forces from 2.3 million personnel to 1.4 million.<br>
<br>
Even though there has been an almost one million reduction in the number of personnel, the budget of the Pentagon 
remains at Cold War levels. It's also not like the U.S. military has been standing idle. There are the costs of operations in 
Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia that must be paid for.<br>
<br>
&quot;Regardless of whether you keep the active force of 1.4 million with the two-war strategy, you are going to need to 
increase spending in the next decade because Reagan-era equipment is going to wear out,&quot; said Michael O'Hanlon, a 
defense expert with the Brookings Institution. &quot;When you think out to the next decade, you have a problem.&quot;<br>
<br>
There are plans, starting in 1997, to begin massive spending for the purchases of the next-generation weapons systems. 
These include the F-22 jet fighter and a new nuclear-powered attack submarine (Seawolf).</p>

<font color="#008000"><font size=5><strong>Two Major Regional Conflict (MRC) Concept/SRC's</strong></font></font><br>
By C. L. Staten, Senior Analyst<br>
<br>
(ENN) In today's edition of the ENN Daily Intelligence Report <em>[above]</em>, our Managing Editor, Steve Macko, offers an 
informed and balanced article concerning the idea of maintaining sufficient forces to fight in two Major Regional Conflicts 
concurrently. As an adjunct to this discussion, this author would like to add offer an additional consideration to be 
reviewed in the quadrennial defense review (QDR).<br>
<br>
Our analysis of this issue is not complete at this time, but it would appear that it might be reasonable to discuss the very 
real possibility of responding to 7-10 (or more) Small Regional Conflicts (SRC) in a given time frame, rather than to focus 
solely on our larger commitment to major theater warfare. This estimate is based in the belief that the future will bring 
literally dozens of &quot;brush-fire&quot; conflicts and that &quot;stateless warfare&quot; may necessitate a larger number of responses of smaller 
(self-contained) specialized units of military force...in multiple locations simultaneously.<br>
<br>
We will continue to examine this important issue and provide an additional perspective as the QDR comes closer, but we 
wanted to bring this matter to light, so that it might be openly discussed in the overall planning effort. ERRI would welcome 
comments and perspectives regarding the concept of multiple MRC's/SRC's and the future configuration of our military 
forces.<br>
