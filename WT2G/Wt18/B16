<TITLE>Miami Beach, FL. Apartment Fire</TITLE>

MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA (ENN) - Two men were killed and 14 others were transported to area hospitals when a fire broke out in a 15-story Miami Beach apartment building on Friday morning. The blaze started in a 10th floor apartment unit at about 0600 EDT.  Police said that the cause of the fire was probably electrical.
<P>

One of the dead victims fell to his death after clinging to a window ledge for about ten minutes.  The 38-year-old victim was reportedly trying to reach a balcony about 12-feet away. One witness described, "He was like, climbing out.  He was trying to get over and there was nowhere to grab."
<P>

The 44-year-old brother of the above victim was brought out of the building by firefighters, but later died at a hospital. A 43-year-old man was rescued by firefighters and was reported to be in stable condition.  Fourteen other people, including two firefighters, suffered smoke inhalation and were transported by EMS.  68 other people were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation.
<P>

The blaze started in the apartment unit across the hall from the three men.  Officials said that the men made a fatal mistake by opening their door, which allowed the flames to enter their apartment.  Firefighters did save at least one man via a tower ladder, but were hampered getting set up because of double- and triple-parked cars, said to be common in the area.  Several apartment units were damaged in the blaze which took firefighters about two hours to bring fully under control.

<H2>NATIONWIDE SURVEY SHOWS GANG PROBLEMS GETTING WORSE</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

The United States Justice Department on Thursday released
preliminary findings of a nationwide survey on street gangs.
The survey found that gang problems were worsening in about
50 percent of the communities that responded.  Only ten
percent of the responding communities reported some improvement
in their gang problems.
<P>

This survey that was conducted by The National Youth Gang Center
(NYGC), under the direction of the DOJ's Office of Juvenile
Justice and Delinquency Prevention, sent the survey to more
than 4,200 police and sheriff's departments in December of
1995.  81 percent or 3,447 of the agencies responded to
the survey.  1,974 said that they had youth gang activity in
their cities or counties.  This was said to be the first large-
scale survey, of its kind, that included both urban and rural
communities.
<P>

Only 210 of the respondents said that gang activity was decreasing
in their jurisdictions.  The rest said that the problem was
staying the same or was getting worse.
<P>

This was only a preliminary report that was put out by the NYGC.
In the coming months, the survey will be expanded to cover more
police and sheriff's departments, schools and social service
agencies.  The report will also examine gang trends in specific
cities and counties.  The final report will be published in the
summer of 1997.
<P>

U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno was supposed to announce these
preliminary findings at an anti-gang conference in Dallas, Texas.
She was unable to attend because of other pressing business in
Washington.  In remarks prepared for The National Youth Gang
Symposium, Reno said that law enforecement is "committed to putting
these gangs out of business -- with a tough, smart mix of prosecutions,
police, aid to communities and common-sense programs to invest in
young people before they take the wrong path.  And we will support
community innovations like school uniforms, curfews and truancy
prevention."
<P>

It was reported that more than 600 law enforcement professionals,
prosecutors, researchers, educators and youth service providers
attended the Dallas conference.

<H2>CAN YOU SAY COMMERCIALIZATION</H2>
 By Gary G. Ludwig, MS, EMT-P
<P>

"Denied", were the words heard by the American Ambulance
Association on January 17, 1996, with their recent attempt to
wield influence on members of Congress about
commercializing the EMS industry.  At the first-ever
Congressional Fire Service Institute (CSFI) EMS Task Force
meeting, representatives from the commercial sector,
including the AAA tried to set up a separate EMS system
under the CSFI. 
<P>

 In essence, the CFSI's National Advisory
Committee (NAC) would have an EMS caucus under the CFSI
equal to the fire caucus.  This EMS caucus would obviously
be dominated by commercial service interests.  Kudos to the
Task Force who stood firm in their vote not to let this happen.
In the end, only three votes went to the commercial industry
for their proposal.  The Task Force did recommend; (1) an
EMS person be added to the CFSI to oversee EMS issues;
(2) increase the EMS representation on the NAC; and (3) an
EMS breakout session be included in all CSFI meetings.
<P>

The Reason Foundation has raised its ugly head once again.
In 1994, the Foundation which promotes privatization of public
services wrote a report advocating the privatization of
Los Angeles FD paramedic operations.  In response, the
Chief of LAFD at the time, Donald Manning, wrote a 22 page
report clearly outlining "this system would convert tax dollars
into profit for the private provider.  The result would be a lower
level of service to the community." 
<P> 

Now in the December 1995 issue of a publication 
called "Privatization Watch", The Reason Foundation
is touting its publication, "Privatizing Emergency Medical 
Services; How Cities Can Cut Costs and Save Lives."  
Ironically, the report only talks about privatizing
the transport component of EMS where the revenue is
generated.  The first responder part and its financial burden
would have to be the responsibility of the local fire agency.
In my opinion, this public/private cooperative is nothing but a
"gratuitous, hand-holding, government sponsored operation to
cover up shoddy response times of commercial ambulance
companies trying to hold down costs for the sake of more
profit".  As one LAFD  Captain told me, "If they want a
public/private cooperative, let the FD do the transport and
they (commercial providers) can do the first response."
<P>

Anne Arundel County (MD) Fire Department under the
direction of Chief Stephen Halford has convened a 10-member
panel to look at long range EMS planning issues.  Chief
Halford said "We need a long range plan to manage a service
that is sure to expand.  I want to know where we should be
ten years from now."  The panel, called EMS Committee
2000 consist of citizens and physicians from the community.
<P>

The committee has been charged with 12 different tasks
including the review of existing resources and how such
services are configured, plus they can solicit individual
comments from any interested parties internal or external to
the department.   Unfortunately, some of those external
sources have been representatives from AMR, Rural/Metro,
and commercial-consultant and Anne Arundel resident Jack
(rip the Fire Departments) Stout.
<P>

Battalion Chief and PIO J. Gary  Sheckells denies there is 
any move toward commercialization.  He assures me the 
committee is merely looking at all issues involved in the 
delivery of EMS.  AACFD has a long and enjoyable reputation 
as being viewed as one of the most progressive EMS-fire 
based systems in Maryland. Hopefully,  the committee will 
see the worth and benefits of continuing a strong fire-based 
EMS system in their community.
<P>

Two thumbs down to Newsweek Magazine.  When writing
about the recent snowstorm and police use of Humvees in
Washington D.C., page 29 of their 1/22/96 edition says, "Not
so for ambulance drivers, who had to tromp for blocks through
two- foot snow to retrieve the sick and injured."  How do you
think this journalist would like being called a "newspaperguy?"
<P>

<H2>HOUSE FIRE KILLS NYPD POLICE COMMANDER</H2>
By Jim Fay ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

NEW YORK CITY (ENN) - A two-alarm fire in a Queens,
NYC, beach front community, resulted in the death of an
NYPD Precinct Commander.
<P>

At approximately 0100 hrs., April 25, the FDNY
responded to a reported house fire at 185 Beach
221 Street, in the shore community of Breezy Point,
in the NYC Borough of Queens.  The first arriving
units were met with heavy fire from the two-story
wood-frame house. This, plus the long distance of
incoming fire units, the close proximity of the
houses to one another, and small streets in the
community, resulted in an almost immediate second
alarm being transmitted by first arriving fire units.
<P>

The search of the house resulted in the discovery
of the owner, NYPD Deputy Inspector John Fahy, 51,
dead on the kitchen floor. His six-year-old son,
James, was also found dead in the house.
<P>

Inspector Fahy was the Commanding Officer of Brooklyn's
63rd Precinct in the Flatbush section, and was a 27-year
veteran of the Police Department.
<P>

The Fahy family was also struck by another tragedy recently.
Inspector Fahy's late wife, Margaret, died in February of
this year from cancer. Margaret Fahy herself was also a
Captain in the NYPD.  Two other sons of the couple survived
the fire.
<P>

Fire Marshal's initial investigation indicate that the
fire was not arson, but a cause could not be determined
as of yet.
<P>
ENN and its staff wish to send their condolences and prayers for the family and friends of Insp. Fahy. May he rest in peace.

<font size=5><strong>ERRI; EVALUATION OF CHINESE<br>
TRIADS IN GREAT BRITAIN</strong></font><font size=3><strong><br>
</strong></font>By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
Anyone who is reader of mystery novels from the 1920s, 30s and 40s will certainly be impressed with the exotic 
reputation of Chinese Triads -- Chinese criminal societies. When one thinks of the word, &quot;Triad,&quot; images of blood 
oaths, secret rituals and slow death by exotic means comes to mind. The history of the societies is anicient. Triads 
were originally established as secret societies set up to overthrow an unpopular ruler. The first known secret society 
was called the Red Eyebrows. They were set up to overthrow the Han dynasty in China that ruled from 206 BC to 
AD 220.<br>
<br>
The Hung League was the first known Triad Society. They date back to the 17th century. There is a legend that says 
that the society was founded by five monks and their main purpose was to overthrow the Chi'ing dynasty and restore 
the Ming back to the throne. In the 18th and 19th centuries, other secret societies were formed in China. Some of 
them claimed to be a part of the Hung League. However, there appeared to be little or no organization among the 
groups and their militancy seems to have been more concerned with robbing and terrorizing citizens than trying to 
overthrow the government. The Hung League lost all claim to any legitimate purpose after the 1911 revolution. 
Factions of the Hung League were heavily involved in organized crime at the start of this century.<br>
<br>
During the first half of the 20th century, the Triads really took root in Hong Kong, a British colony. The Triads 
flourished as criminal organizations. After a governmental crackdown in 1956, the groups became less structured and 
they became little more than loose confederations of gangs. Today, in Hong Kong, they are little more than street 
gangs that you would find in Los Angeles. They provide muscle for a variety of organized crime activity, especially 
extortion. Surprisingly, efforts towards international drug trafficking tend to be carried out by gangs whose members 
only come together for the sole purpose of smuggling drugs and they are not necessarily members of any triad.<br>
<br>
Eventually some triad members immigrated to Great Britain. Triads have been called a &quot;criminal cancer&quot; in the UK 
and are looked upon as a major criminal threat. The Organized Crime Unit of Britain's National Criminal Intelligence 
Service has carried out an extensive assessment of the level of Chinese organized crime activity on the British Isles. 
The assessment has been codenamed, Project Chopstick. The NCIS has determined that there four separate triad 
societies currently operating in the UK. It appears that they are not controlled from Hong Kong and they are not part 
of some large international criminal conspiracy. It also does not appear that there is much coordination of factions 
from different cities.<br>
<br>
The main criminal activity of the triads is extortion, loan sharking, credit card fraud and video piracy. There is also 
some evidence of a little involvement in prostitution. Intelligence from the British NCIS indicates that the vast majority 
of the extortion takes place in the Chinese community. The main victims are traditionally restaurants and other small 
businesses. The number of reported cases is small, but again, traditionally, the Chinese have a tendency not to report 
crime to the authorities. Low reported figures does not mean that no crime is happening. But it is very clear and 
certain that the triads are involved in extortion. They use the name, &quot;Triad,&quot; as a means of intimidating their victims.<br>
<br>
In the United States, drive-by shootings are common among rival street gangs. Among the Chinese, there are violent 
assaults but they take on a different form between rival triad groups. An assault called &quot;choppings&quot; is done with a 
large knife. Most of the assaults seem to be over a &quot;loss of face&quot;, which is extremely important in Chinese culture. 
The NCIS says that the number of reported assaults in a given year are generally low.<br>
<br>
Britain's NCIS says that Chinese organized crime activity is a cause of concern. The extortion schemes that are 
operated by the triads creates a climate of fear within the Chinese community. However, in essence, the Chinese 
triads do not pose any greater threat than other crime groups in Great Britian, such as West Indians(?) and Turks. 
The NCIS says that their intelligence does not indicate that the Chinese triads in Britain are involved in drug 
smuggling. This is contrary to Chinese organized crime groups in North America and Australia -- which are involved 
in drug trafficking. Triad activity appears to be increasing and bears additional scrutiny by law enforcement officials, 
ENN will follow this situation for you and provide addition details as they become available.</p>

<TITLE>Terror Bombing of Egyptian Embassy</TITLE>

<H2>TERRORIST BOMB ATTACK ON EGYPTIAN EMBASSY IN PAKISTAN...</H2>
<P>
By Steve Macko
<P>

Fifteen people were reported killed and 59 others were injured in
an apparent suicide bomb attack at the Egyptian Embassy in the Pakistani
capital of Islamabad.  A pickup truck filled with explosives rammed
into the gate at the Embassy and exploded.  Islamic militants in
Egypt have claimed responsibility for the attack.  Most of the dead
victims were said to be Pakistani security guards and people who were
applying for visas to Egypt.  It was reported that at least one Egyptian
diplomat was also killed.
<P>

Sardar Aseff Ali, Pakistan's Foreign Minister said that the bombing was
a "dastardly attack."  He also said, "It was a terrorist attack
perpetrated by a suicide bomber who may have blasted his way through
the gate and exploded his pickup truck."
<P>

The powerful blast tore the entire side off the Embassy building,
according to witnesses.  There was said to be two explosions about
three minutes apart.  The bombing attack happened at about 9:30 a.m.
Pakistan time, when the Embassy was open for business.  Sunday is a
regular working day in that part of the world.  The second explosion
was reported to be more powerful than the first explosion and was
probably designed to kill and/or hurt rescuers.   The explosion could
be felt from several miles away.
<P>

A police constable, who is a security guard for the Egyptian ambassador
said, "I was standing outside the gate and the body of a police officer
came flying over the wall and landed beside me."  The Egyptian ambassador
was stunned by the explosion, but was unhurt.  The police constable who
witnessed the bombing said that the first explosion appeared to happen
outside of the Embassy compound and the second, much larger explosion,
came from within the walled area.  Body parts of victims were said to
have been scattered on the street around the Embassy.
<P>

An Embassy worker said, "It was a massive explosion."  Many people
were reported to be trapped in the rubble of the 3-story building.  A 
hole ten feet deep was reported outside of the Embassy building.  Many
other buildings inside of the compound, including offices and apartments,
were said to have also suffered severe damage.
<P>

The Interior Minister of Pakistan said that the militant Egyptian
group al-Gama'a al-Islamiya had claimed responsibilty for the terrorist
attack.  Al-Gama'a has been trying to overthrow the government of President
Hosni Mubarak for a number of years and replace it with a government of  
strict Islamic rule.  Shortly after the explosion, an unidentified person 
called a Western news agency in Cairo and said in Arabic, "Al-Gama'a 
al-Islamiya claims responsibilty for the Pakistan blast." Security sources said that the Egyptian government is sending a special team to Pakistan to assist in the investigation.
<P>

On Saturday night, al-Gama'a al-Islamiya coducted another terrorist
attack on a passenger train that was filled with tourists.  A train  
that was heading north from Aswan to Cairo that was about 400 miles
south of the Egyptian capital was fired upon by terrorists.  One
train worker was killed and several other people were injured.
<P>

Last Monday, an Egyptian diplomat was killed in Geneva, Switzerland.
A previously unknown group called, "International Group for Justice"
claimed responsibilty for the murder.
<P>

Counter-terorism experts are saying that today's bombing in Pakistan
could mark the beginning of a new front in the war between the Egyptian
government and the militants.  A former Egyptian security officer said,
"Egyptian missions abroad could be the upcoming target of the Gama'a
terrorists."

<H2>World Cup Soccer Violence; "Hooligans" Coming here?</H2>
By Paul Anderson
<P>

Chicago, IL, June 17, 1994 --Law enforcement and other emergency
planners have been meeting in some communities for several
months. Riot/Crowd control training simulations have been taking
place in Florida and California, and at several other designated
venues where the coming World Cup Soccer championships will be
played. Intelligence experts say that there is a "better than
even chance" of violence at one or more of the venues in the
United States.
<P>

"Hooliganism" is a term used by security officials in Europe,
where soccer inspirted violence is a well know phenomena.  It is
used to describe those that use a soccer game as an excuse to
commit act of unmitigated violence against fans of the other
teams, or for no reason at all.  In fact, crowd violence is
almost a commonplace occurrence in England, Ireland, German, and
other countries where soccer is the national game. Numerous
injuries and even deaths have occurred all too frequently in
recent years in Europe.
<P>

The question remains, is it possible for that violence to be
imported to the United States?  The answer, obviously, remains
to be seen, but some security and counter-terrorist experts
think that it is possible that a purposeful plot is underway to
disrupt the peaceful conduct of the World Cup. One intelligence
report suggests that as many as 10,000 "hooligans" have been
sent to several venues from undisclosed locations in South
America.  Another suggests that Islamic Terrorists will strike
at one of the games.  A third says that terrorism is unlikely,
but that at least one game will end in a riot caused by the
fans.  Certainly, the history of the World Cup offers a clue as
to the likelihood of disorder.
<P>    

Unfortunately, that history is also dismal.  In all too
many years that the World Cup has been held, one or more games
has ended in a riot, injuries, and even deaths.  According to
historians, soccer games have even been the causative factors in
the starting of armed conflicts. Examples include a 1989 soccer
anarchism in Sheffield, England that killed 94 fans and injured
another 170, a tragic fire in 1985 that took 56 lives at a
stadium in Bradford, England, and a 1985 stampede in Heysel
Stadium in Brussels that crushed the life out of 39 fans. 
Numerous other games have resulted in a lessor number of deaths,
but have been violent just the same.
<P>

Both emergency managers and fans are hoping that the experts are
wrong, and that this year's games will defy the odds and be riot
free. However, police and other emergency officials say that
they are prepared should history repeat itself.  Only time will
tell.

<H2>Huntington Beach Police Report Situation "Out of Control"</H2>
By: Paul Anderson, ENN Correspondent
<P>

Chicago, IL, June 26, 1994 -- Although relegated to a mere 1 1/2 inch
by one column item on page 15B of the local Chicago sports page,
police officers in Huntington Park, CA report that fans
celebrating a Mexican 2-1 victory over Ireland, on Friday,
caused a "situation that was out of control".  According to a
police spokesman, Huntington Park police were subjected to more
than an hour and a half (1 1/2) of "taking rocks and bottles". 
Reportedly, several police cars were damaged by flying missiles
and at least one police windshield was smashed. One police
officer was injured and taken to a local hospital after being
hit by a car full of World Cup revelers. 
<P>

Approximately 5,000 fans were also reportedly involved in the
smashing of store windows and looting in a largely Hispanic area
near the Pasadena Rose Bowl, where World Cup games are being
held. Police say that approximately one hundred (100) police
officers, in full riot gear, were finally needed to stop the
looting and attempt to control the crowds.  Reportedly, that's
when the rock and bottle throwing began.  According to a Los
Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman, as many as ten thousand fans
may have been on the street and celebrating at 11:30 p.m., when
the police began their sweeps to clear the streets and end the
chaotic behavior. 
<P> 

Most interesting, according to police intelligence source, is
the fact that no soccer game was held in Pasadena on Friday. 
The riot was caused by a Mexican victory in a game in Orlando,
FL.  More interesting than the riot in Huntington Park was the
larger riot in Mexico City caused by the same soccer victory.
<P>

According to the Associated Press (AP), twenty (20) police
officers and another sixteen civilians were injured in clashes
between celebrating fans and riot police in downtown Mexico
City, on Friday.  Several dozen people were arrested as hundreds
of fans pummeled police officers with sticks, rocks, and beer
bottles.  A large crowd also pelted officers that were guarding
the U.S. Embassy and several were injured.  A major disturbance
also erupted at a monument on the Paseo de la Reforma and caused
some fans to be trampled as people tried to escape from the
surging fistfight.  More than 300 riot police were needed to
quell the disturbances, that went on through the night in
various parts of Mexico City.
<P>

One might ask...why are there riots at places other than the
games?  And, what are the prospects of additional violence at
other games leading to the July 17th finale in Los Angeles? 
European soccer experts say that Americans just don't understand
the intensity or ruthlessness of either European or South
American soccer "hooligans". Secondarily, national pride and
"bragging rights" are at stake in many World Cup games.
<P>  

Tourism dollars and future promotional opportunities are often tied to
soccer victories. Soccer fans in some countries are considered
"fanatics" in other countries.  Spontaneous celebrations or
sympathy riots are likely to break out in a variety of
countries, depending on the outcome of certain games.  It should
be remembered that wars have been fought in Europe over the
outcome of soccer games. 
<P> 

European experts also say that the normal American sportsmanship
and hospitality may lull local planning authorities into a false
sense of security, that "it can't happen here".  Unfortunately,
that is already the attitude of all too many emergency planners
and government officials, according to Clark Staten of Chicago's
Emergency Response & Research Institute.
<P>

"Far to many Fire, Police, EMS, and elected officials in America
fail to plan for a riot, a multiple shooting, a terrorist event,
a major hazardous materials release, or other deadly calamity
simply because it has never happened before in their
jurisdiction", Staten said.  "We have...collectively...in this
country, been extremely lucky", he continued.  "But somehow, we
continue to believe that the violence and mayhem that has
happened everywhere else in the world...can't happen here", the
veteran emergency analyst said.
<P>

"I hope that maybe...to some extent...the World Trade Center
bombing has finally brought home the idea that anything and
everything that has happened elsewhere can happen here...and
that we need to plan, equip, and prepare for these terrible
eventualities", Staten added.  "To do otherwise is folly...it
will lead to unnecessary injuries and even deaths", the
emergency think-tank director said. 
<P>

"While I'm certainly not preaching 'apocalypse now', I am a
major advocate of preparedness and training to stem the rising
tide of anarchy that is sweeping across the world", Staten said.
"Unfortunately, the World Cup games afford those that would
purposefully perpetrate unlawful acts both the motivation, and a
world-wide stage for further disorder...we must be prepared",
Staten concluded.
<P>  

Staten said that he was especially concerned about games to be
held on both June 28th and 29th in the New York area, as
specific threats have already been identified by experts in
Great Britain and elsewhere.  The games that have been
identified as potential causes of violence are Italy versus
Mexico and Ireland versus Norway.  He also said that games
involving Columbia, Brazil, and Holland may have violent
implications, as they all have fans with a history of
"holliganism".
<P>
So, the games go on.  Local stadium and tourism officials at all
of the venues predict record crowds, sunny weather, and little,
if any, violence.  Nothing bad can happen here. Or can it?
<P>

(Editor's Note: We offer the following well thought out analysis on recent events in Korea that was sent to ENN by Mr. Ronald W. Lewis, the Chief Military Analyst of the THE INTELLIGYST GROUP.
<P>
For those who are not familar with intelligence agency operations -- for the most part, it is not like what you see in James Bond movies.  The vast majority of the time is spent in collecting intelligence (information), analyzing it and then writing papers, such as this report, on subjects.
<P>
Mr. Lewis would like to hear any comments on this analysis or any analysis that anyone else may have to offer.  You can send your comments to: enn@emergency.com and we'd be more than happy to pass them on.)

<center><H2>MOVEMENT OF ARMOR IN KOREA</H2>
<H3>And Other Notes of Interest; Korea--June, 1996</H3>
<B>By Ronald W. Lewis
<BR> Chief Military Analyst 
<BR>THE INTELLIGYST GROUP</B></center>
<P>

In a recent assessment of statements by a defecting North Korean F-6 (MiG-19) pilot about the likelihood of a North Korean invasion in late 1996/early 1997, I stated that this would place the invasion in the dead of winter, causing untold problems for the attacking armored forces.  One very astute reader of this assessment pointed out, very correctly, that in armored warfare, winter's freezing of rivers and marshes presents an advantage in freedom of movement.  The tanks and armored personnel carriers (APCs) are no longer restricted to improved roads, where their movement is limited, thus making them relatively easy prey for attacking aircraft and artillery with pre-registered killing zones.
<P> 

Winter does offer wider avenues of approach afforded by frozen ground and this was one reason why it was feared--and reported--that Croatia was planning to mount an assault against Serb rebels in Eastern Slavonia this past winter (January 1996). Armor would be able to spread out on the marshy soil of the region and avoid being bracketed by artilleryregistered to hit targets confined to roads.   But that operation was to be conducted on level terrain in a river flood plain.
<P>

There are some disadvantages to armored warfare in winter, particularly in mountainous terrain such as that in Korea. For one,  snow and ice tend to complicate your re-supply efforts.  Although tanks and APCs can quickly advance and avoid being caught on roads, the support vehicles bringing up ammunition and the vital fuel replenishment to maintain such a thrust must make its way through roads covered with ice and snow.
<P>

Whereas the tracks on tanks and APCs allow them to negotiate snowbanks and afford some traction on river ice, soft-skinned, wheeled support vehicles do not have these luxuries, often getting bogged down in snow and slush, which quickly degenerates into mud if the road is heavily traveled. As for ice, it is difficult to achieve good traction even on flat ice over a frozen river, much less maintain control on sheets of ice covering steep, narrow, winding roads in mountain valleys.
<P>

In the first Korean war, even tanks were known to slide off of mountain roads slickened with ice.  Once the armored vehicles make it to open, flat terrain, the winter freeze allows greater freedom of movement, insofar as the terrain that is available for travel, but their support vehicles would face a nightmare trying to keep up with them.  This would place the entire offensive at risk.
<P>

North Korea also has some unique problems in that its fuel reserves should be very low.  Operations in winter tend to expend more fuel because the tanks must be run up more often to keep their batteries charged and vehicles spend more fuel trying to compensate for the loss of traction.  More fuel also has to be expended carrying extra clothing, supplies and heating fuel (kerosene, charcoal) to keep the troops warm in their camps.
<P>  

This is not simply for creature comforts but a matter of mere survival in the harsh Korean winter. For every pound of charcoal heating fuel carried, a transport vehicle uses extra fuel.  To compound the problem, that charcoal takes up space and fuel which could be devoted to other essential war-fighting materials like ammunition, fuel, food, medicine, etc. Pound for pound, winter is a much less efficient season in which to fight a war if you are critically short of fuel.
<P>

There are some other little-considered drawbacks to winter warfare.  For one, you can't hide.  Smoke and heat from exhausts which would be invisible or would quickly dissipate in warmer area seems to billow up in large clouds that don't diffuse well in the heavier cold air.  This makes it easier for attacking pilots to attack, once the heavy clouds have parted or risen to altitudes which allow for effective attacks.  Again, once the clouds have given way enough to make reconnaissance flights practical, the vehicle tracks and footprints are an intelligence bonanza, not only giving the enemy's location but a clue to his strength.   Trees no longer have leaves, making it harder to hide.
<P>

In the first Korean war, Chinese troops were able to infiltrate into North Korea without being undetected for weeks prior to their appearance in November 1950.  Had they tried to do so later, after considerable snow had fallen, the troops' body heat would have melted the snow off the roofs of buildings they hid in during the day.  Rail cars carrying troops also would have been clear of any snow, while others on a train would retain some.   Also, all of the heavy foot traffic would have shown up in the snow leading to such buildings. In 1950, these clues would have been too subtle.  In 1996, imagery interpreters had better be on the watch for such things during the winter.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THE DEFECTING NORTH KOREAN F-6 (MiG-19) PILOT:</H3>

1.  <B>DEFECTOR'S SOCKS:</B>   I'd like to point out something about the defecting North Korean pilot's lack of socks and the intelligence community's obsession with that.  The captain states that the cotton wraps he used were commonly used to bind the feet and keep them from sweating.  Wool socks are known to cause heavy sweating.  While in Korea, I always wore white cotton socks under the regulation black wool-blend socks, just for this reason.  A fairly tight wrap of the foot would also help to inhibit sweating somewhat but, more importantly, a thick wrap of cotton would provide more insulation than a loose, single layer of cotton provided by conventional socks. Even during the summer months, the temperatures in a jet flying at higher altitudes is very low and uncomfortable.
<P>

2.  <B>PILOT'S TRACK SUIT:</B>  It has also been stated that he was wearing a track suit under his flight uniform instead of insulated underwear.  Keep in mind that this is not winter. Although it does get cold in the upper altitudes, it is not extremely cold this time of year.  In fact, on the ground, it is probably getting very warm.  His feet would need insulation due to the tendency for extremities to suffer more from the cold.  For those who are not aware, pilots tend to wear the lightest clothing possible under their flight suits.  This affords more freedom of movement, prevents over-heating and is generally more comfortable.  I am, therefore, simply amazed at the great media frenzy and the apparent fascination of trained (?) "intelligence analysts" whom have become so taken with this individual's personal clothing.
<P>

Think about this in simple terms for a moment:  The North Korean military is a respected and even pampered element of their society, and Air Force pilots are probably considered the cream of the crop.  How is it, then, that everybody else in North Korea has socks but one of the elite?  The "logic" surrounding this subject has been that, well, if he can't even get a pair of socks, the North is falling apart faster than we ever imagined.

Get real!  THINK!!   If there is no cotton to make socks, how did they happen to have cotton for the wrappings?   If there is no functioning garment industry, why isn't everybody in North Korea walking around naked or in tattered rags?   If there is no power to run the factories, the looms, the sewing machines, etc., then nobody would have any clothes and they would not only be hungry but naked as well!
<P>

At some point, common sense has to prevail here and it really concerns me that so much has been made of minor issues that are either easily explained or easy to dismiss as relatively unimportant, yet US and ROK Intelligence seems incapable of seeing some important clues that this man very probably is not a legitimate defector but a deliberate plant, and for the following reasons:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a)  He departed in an older, more expendable jet.
<LI>b)  He has a family portrait to remind him of a family which he now admits will probably be turned into slave laborers due to his defection.
<LI>c)  There is no evidence that the North Koreans tried to stop him before he crossed the border, even though his western route should have made it possible for the North  Koreans to pick him up more easily on radar.  At least one report states that the US Army OH-58 Kiowa helicopter shot down inside North Korea in December 1994 was hit by a shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile but nobody on the ground or in the North Korean coastal navy shot at this man as he crossed one of the most heavily-defended borders in the world?
<LI>d)  As a captain in a close air support unit flying F-6 (MiG-19) aircraft, this man not only knows the future deployment plans of a MiG-29 interceptor unit, but no less than the war strategy and psychological state of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il himself?  I considered that this pilot may have concocted this "high-value" story in order to increase his importance to his South Korean hosts, but merely bringing an enemy aircraft like this across the border should have been good enough to curry favor.
</UL>
<P>
This defector offers far too much information and much of what he presents should be well beyond his scope of knowledge or security clearances.  He is either lying or is a deliberate plant by the North Koreans to convince the ROK and US that any invasion plans will not be acted upon until late 96/early 97.
<P>  
If my suspicions are correct, such invasion plans have a much closer timetable.  In addition, I would also watch for signs of increased terrorist activity in Japan.  It may only be a coincidence, but Reuters is reporting that Japanese police are stepping up their campaign to capture  remaining fugitives from the Aum Shinrikyo cult blamed for last year's sarin nerve gas attacks. I would be on the lookout for any unusual events in Japan for I believe North Korea is going to stage further assaults in an attempt to coerce Japan into withholding support for any American response to an invasion in Korea.
<P>
(NOTE:  Another version of this document was prepared and sent out early in the morning of May 31.  Within minutes after sending it, I scanned Reuters press reports on Asia and found that Japanese authorities are announcing that there have been a number of brushes with "disaster" because unknown parties with specialized knowledge of trains have been sabotaging tracks of high-speed commuter trains around Tokyo.

Large and heavy objects have been left on the tracks and other acts of sabotage have been reported.  Special teams of inspectors are now combing the tracks to look for any such sabotage.  Japanese officials are trying to blame it on disgruntled former workers with the railroad which was privatized 10 years ago, leading to job losses.  However, 10 years is a long time to hold a grudge.  Could it be yet another attempt to demonstrate to the Japanese people and authorities just how easily their "safe" and orderly society can be disrupted by terrorist acts?)
<P>
<HR>
3.  <B> LACK OF F-6 (MiG-19) HEATER: </B>  Press reports keep hammering at the fact that the aircraft was not equipped with a heater.  If anybody is surprised by this and assumes this is some failure of equipment or the result of dire equipment shortages, allow me to point out that, at least until recently, most Soviet armored vehicles (and their Chinese clones) have come equipped without a heater.  Creature comforts in the Russian and Chinese armies has never been a priority and the philosophy of their weapons designers has generally been that space taken up by a heater can be better used to store more fuel or ammo.
<P>
<HR>
4.<B>INVASION CONDITIONS/PRECURSORS:</B> Ideal conditions for a North Korean invasion of the south would require marginally poor weather with heavy cloud cover to help escape detection by aerial surveillance and attack from aircraft and helicopters.
<P>
In addition, an invasion would likely occur on a weekend when people would be more prone to relax. It is always possible that an attack could happen during the week as well, on the assumption that a weekend attack would be expected.  You begin to see here how difficult it is to assess such things--there are simply so many variables to consider. 
<P> 
If I'm correct in my theory that North Korea will attempt to intimidate and coerce Japan into refusing or restricting use of Japanese bases and facilities by US forces, we should see a sharp increase in terrorist-type activirties within Japan some time shortly before an invasion kicks off.  Watching the weather and events in Japan will be important.  If I am correct, a coincidence of marginal weather and heightened tension in Japan may be a direct precursor to an attack on South Korea by the North.

<H2>On Becoming a Techno-Nerd...</H2>
<P>
                  By Clark Staten, EMT-P I/C
<P>


Do you have a computer?  Do you have a mobile phone? A

digital watch?  A pager on your belt?  Do you subscribe to at

least three computer or electronics magazines?  Do you have a

VHF, UHF, CB, or Amateur Band Radio in your car?  Is the

"scanner" always on at your house?  If the answer is yes to a

majority of these questions....you are showing tendencies of

becoming a "Techno-Nerd".
<P>


You undoubtedly just asked yourself; "How can I be Nerd?".

"I played football, I have a wife/girlfriend, I drink

beer, I'm not scared of anything, I have a four-wheel drive

truck...and besides...I walk through walls before breakfast

at work...I can't be ANY KIND of a NERD...Can I ??"
<P>


Your author WAS SURE that I wasn't any kind of "NERD" until

recently.  Then I began to wonder about the about the fact

that I recently refused a date with a pretty blonde, so that

I could work on my computer at home.  I thought a second

longer, and again wondered what I was doing recently,

climbing on the peak of the dangerous roof of my house to

position an scanner antenna so that it was "just-right".

Then, on the way to work, my mobile phone and pager went off

at the same time.  I then had to stop and accept the fact

that it was possible that I had become a "Techno-Nerd".
<P>


It's true. "Techno-Nerds" are creeping into our everyday

lives.  Many of us MAY have even BECOME ONE.  Many of us have

recently begun looking for technological solutions to

problems that previously would have confused and confounded

us....and we are finding them. It truely is becoming an

"information age" and becoming a "Techno-Nerd" (at least to

some extent) is necessary to access the wonders of modern

communication and information systems.
<P>


Your author bought his first home computer (a 80286) about

five years ago, and his second one (A 80386) this year. The

first one languished on my work bench for several months

after being purchased, without being used.  After all, I had

a perfectly good 1970's model Ollivetti typewriter.  I then

bought a "cute" (but, proprietary) word-processor, when the

"writing bug" bit me.  Both of these crude implements had

served me well for several years.  I had written and

published several articles in fine magazines like this one

with them. I didn't need that "new-fangled" machine to

produce an article.  Besides, you had to learn all of those

"Disk Operating System (DOS)" commands and figure out how to

get the machine to do what it was supposed to do.  It seemed

to be... just too much trouble.
<P>
Then it was suggested that I re-write and expand upon an

article that I had written.  I laboriously wrote and re-wrote

the longer and longer piece...until I ran out of space on the

disk for the word processor. I took to typing and "cutting

and pasting" pieces of paper to each other and making

photocopies at the Post Office. Rewriting and rewriting, time

after time; that didn't work well either.  All of the time,

while I toiled with the scissors and glue, the computer sat

on my work bench and mocked me with a simple.... C:\.
<P>


It was then that the startling revelation hit me!  I could

MAKE that computer do this "cutting and pasting" for me.

After all, I had seen a T.V. program on Public Television

that showed people actually controlling the entire North

American Radar Air Defense (NORAD) system with a

computer....it should be able to help me write a story.  I

sat down at the dining room table and began to read the book

on the computer and it's DOS 3.0.  It was terribly

confusing....Megabytes, Hard drives, Floppy drives,

Controllers, Applications, Interrupts, Serial ports, Parallel

ports, and memory to remember.  None of this had anything to

do with writing the story, but now I was compelled to

dominate "the machine".  After all, that's all it

was...wasn't it?  A Machine....
<P>


What was the difference between disk space and memory?   It

seemed that I was always running out of one or the other.

What about communications ? The book said I could "hook-up" a

modem to my computer and "talk" (or type) to others and send

"files" through the telephone lines.  Was that possible? That

I could type an article, send it over the phone, and somebody

else could read it at the other end? The book said it could

be done.  The transformation was beginning.
<P>


Next week at the grocery store, I found a magazine rack with

several computer magazines on it.  The articles looked

interesting and they promised being able to do phenomenal

things with that "bunch of chips, transistors, and wiring"

that sat on my workbench.  I purchased a couple of magazines

and browsed through them while watching television with my

daughter.  Numerous ads promised that their software would do

almost anything that I desired.  There were ads for

accounting packages, word processing (my then current

interest), communications (so that's how you do it...with

software), databases, personal information managers (that

sounded interesting), memory managers, and even "adult

animated software.  Now, we were talking... XXX rated

computer files.
<P>

I then made my first trek to the friendly neighborhood

computer store.  I was like a "kid in a candy store". All of

those programs that I had read about were right there for me

to purchase; including a word processing program.  I read all

of the boxes and scanned all of the features. Many of them

looked to difficult for me.  Then I found just the right one.

(In fact, this article is being written on an upgraded

version of that original program.)  Then for good measure, I

bought several other programs that they had "ON SALE" as

discontinued, or had been opened, or whatever.  I rushed home

and began to "install" my new "wonders".
<P>


Soon my tiny 20 MB hard disk "groaned" under the weight of

numerous utility, communication, graphics, and other

miscellaneous programs that I had acquired.  After finding a

communications program that was almost workable, I discovered

the world of computer communications.  After numerous false-

starts, I was finally... "On-line" and soon downloaded about

a thousand other programs that I didn't need. But, It didn't

matter. I was MAKING the computer work.  And, yes....I did

get the article finished....it eventually became a book.
<P>


By then, I was "hooked".  The computer magazines began to

arrive at my house like clockwork.  Soon additional

advertisements and catalogs began to arrive for electronic

components, radios, software, antennas, and a multitude of

other "Techie" equipment.  Everyday, new and enticing

products were presented in the privacy and comfort of my own

home. Soon, I knew the United Parcel Service man by his first

name.
<P>


Then, it wasn't good enough to go answer the phone....I

either answered it with a handheld portable or let my

answering machine and computer do the talking. Booting up my

computer when I wasn't home would cause by "beeper" to go

off. Then, I HAD to have a car phone...after all, what if I

missed a call.  Besides, it was soon becoming the status

symbol of the late 80's and early 90's.  I began to

understand the differences between UNIX, OS/2 and DOS.  I

began to look down for my pocket pen protector.
<P>


Then it happened......
<P>


I became really crazed, and began to develop a plan to have

my computer answer the phone and share ideas and software

with others. It was called a "Bulletin Board Service (BBS)".

Now... I knew I was gone.  I suddenly had a terrible

inclination to wear white socks, tape my glasses, and carry a

holster and slide rule.  I must be "over the edge"...only

"Techno-Nerds" knew about such things, and I wasn't a

"Techie" or a "Nerd".... was I ?
<P>

The rest of my life seemed complicated, but fairly normal.

However, technology continued to intrude. The last straw

found me at a computer store buying the second computer that

I mentioned earlier. I had drooled over a "386" with extended

memory, as the BBS continued to take over my first computer

love.  It had finally happened....after much technical

discussion about the capabilities of the new system, the

purchase of my second computer was completed. I was thrilled

that I knew as much or more about computers as the salesman

that sold it to me.  It then dawned on me.  I defintely had

become a "Techno-Nerd".
<P>


Now that I have accepted it, the notion is not so bad. I am

now able to accomplish many tasks that I never would have

attempted before. My writing is now (most of the time)

improved by a "spell and grammer checker". I can manipulate

text and numbers to provide me with an effective accounting

and database system. Computer communications have allowed me

access to a wealth of information that helps me in my job and

at home.
<P>


I have discarded many non-productive programs that were of

little use to me. I've learned to use my computer equipment

for the betterment of myself and my family.  My daughter now

uses it for her school work.  My Bulletin Board has grown,

with additional phone lines, and I have made several new

friends while "on-line".  I am now teaching others about the

wonders of computers and enjoying the process. There is so

much that can be learned in the world and the computer allows

me an intelligent and rapid alternative to personal exploration.

I don't think I have really changed.........just grown.
<P>


I guess if somebody wants to call me a "Techno-Nerd"...
.....it's alright with me.
<P>

<B>Philadelphia...</B>
<P>

<H2>Small Plane Down in Residential Neighborhood</H2>

The pilot of a small plane is reported to be in critical condition
after he crashed in a densely populated neighborhood of Philadelphia
on Thursday evening.  Before crashing, the plane reportedly clipped
the roof of one house, narrowly missed other homes, a donut shop
and several autos.
<P>

Civilians rescued the 32-year-old pilot after the plane landed onto
a parked car.  The civilians rescued the man at great risk to 
themselves because gasoline was leaking from the plane and could had
erupted into flames.  One police officer said that the gasoline was
"jetting out like a faucet."
<P>

The plane declared an emergency while it was flying to Teterboro,
New Jersey, in rainy weather.  The plane was diverted to Northeast
Philadelphia Airport and crashed about two miles from the nearest
runway.  The crash happened at about 1835 EST.
<P>

Citizens rushed to the aid of the pilot and quickly extricated him
from the wreckage.  One person cut the pilot's seat belt with a
knife and others pulled the man out of the plane.  One rescuer
described the scene, "We gave him one good yank, then we carried
him up the street as fast as we could to get away from that gas."
The man was transported by EMS to Albert Einstein Medical Center
with head and face injuries.
<P>
Emergency service officials said that this accident had the potential to be far worse, had citizen volunteers not assisted, or if the leaking gasoline had exploded into flames. A Philadelphia firefighter told ENN, "We can thank our lucky stars on this one....it could have been a nightmare."

<H3>Nature of the Threat....</H3>
<BR>
Chicago, IL, February 26, 1995 -- Ahkmed set the timer and pulled the
pin. He pushed the device back into the cheap gym bag, and
closed the locker door. Soon the infidels would understand the
folly of their support for the Zionists. Ahkmed walked slowly
and surely from the baggage locker area of Union Station and got
into his late model rental car. He knew his handiwork would kill
dozens, if not hundreds, of commuters, when it was detonated
during "rush hour".  Within minutes, he was on the Eisenhower
expressway and headed West, out of the city.
<P>
It was near 3:00a.m when Mohhamad began to cut the chain link
fence surrounding the Commonwealth Edison substation.  He had
been chosen specifically by their cell leader to set the satchel
charges in and around the "long-lines" power distribution
network.  His experience with explosives was well known, from
Beirut to Belfast. He quickly crawled under and around the
dangerous high-voltage transformers and carefully placed each
shaped charge, in such a way as to cause the maximum damage. He
armed each of the delay timers and slid back out of the
compound, pushing the chain link back into itself, so the hole
wouldn't be easily noticed.
<P>
At about the same time, Nasar al-Abod was crawling through the
concrete beams that supported the overpass, commonly called by
most Chicagoans, "the Spaghetti Bowl". He was placing his
concrete cutting charges in such a way as to collapse the
intersection of several expressways.  He was sure that this
would cause the death of many "Jewish lawyers and businessmen",
who were traveling to Chicago's loop.  Maybe this glorious
action would teach the smug Americans that they weren't safe,
even in the heartland of the United States. He set the timer on
the linked charges and slowly walked to the parked car, that he
had left on the expressway with the hood up. He closed the hood,
got in, and began his drive to Milwaukee.
<P>
Shalima had one of the most important jobs. She was honored to
be the one who would strike at the very heart of the Zionist
oppressors. She had watched the subway station at State &
Randolph for several days. Dressed alternatively as a
"bag-lady", and then as a business woman, she had seen the
maintenance schedule and the morning coming and going of the
trains.  8:30 a.m. would be perfect, she decided, for a massive
explosion that would take the lives of the rich commuters coming
from Skokie, Highland Park, and from the other predominately
Jewish North Shore bedroom communities.
<P> 
Tonight, she had again chosen the guise of a "bag-lady", she was
carrying two large bags.  Both bags were filled with SEMTEX, a
timer, and a detonator.  The explosives were wrapped in
newspaper and several rags and bottles filled the tops of the
bags.  The bags were amazingly alike, except for the settings on
the timers.  One timer was set to explode six (6) minutes after
the other. Shalima had watched the firefighters and police
officers as they responded to a false alarm that she had called
in two days ago. The emergency forces had arrived, in force,
about five minutes after her call. If Shalima had planned
correctly, there would be dozens of extra "witnesses" for her
second explosion.  She pushed one of the bags into a large trash
container, near where the passengers all exited the train, and
made sure it was covered with refuge.  The second bag was then
placed in another nearby trash container.
<P>  
Shalima began picking up newspapers and other trash from the
platform, when a CTA supervisor walked by and stared at her. She
finished pushing the trash into the container, took a long pull
on a half-pint of cheap whiskey that she had purchased for the
occasion, and started mumbling something about cleaning up the
platform.  The CTA supervisor listened to her, laughed, and
continued his rounds. Shalima waited until he was well down the
platform before she climbed the stairs and hailed a cab, pulled
out two twenty dollar bills, and asked to be taken to a hotel
near O'Hare Airport. Shalima knew that the trash in those cans
wouldn't be disturbed until well after 8:30.
<P>
Finally, Abdul Abu-Amal, the leader of this cell, had saved the
best task for himself.  He drove around several blocks before he
parked the non-descript 1989 Chevrolet near the door to the
Israeli Embassy on Wacker Drive. The car gave all the
appearances of being a unmarked police car, down to the Motorola
microphone that he had displayed prominently on the dash. Even
though Abu-Amal was wearing gloves, he was careful to wipe down
anything that he might have touched.  He exited the vehicle,
open the trunk and activated the fusing system that would
detonate the combination of ammonia nitrate fertilizer, fuel
oil, and oxygen bottles that were wired into the trunk and back
seat. When the detonator clicked, the entire car would become a
massive fireball of exploding metal that Amal hoped would bring
down the front of the building. Abdul-Amal finished his task,
broke the key off in the trunk lock, and walked slowly toward
another car that he had parked nearby. He knew he would be on
the expressway, halfway to Detroit, when the horror began.
<P>    
Within seconds of 08:30a.m, on Monday morning, the explosions
started. First, the electrical power station erupted with an
orange fireball and a huge flash of sparks. The power was soon
lost to "the loop" and a majority of the central part of
Chicago. Police and fire department radio transmitters went
silent, as dispatchers and repairmen worked frantically to
restore backup systems. Traffic lights went blank, as well as
lights in many of the high-rise buildings. the chaos had begun.
<P>
Shortly thereafter, the explosions under the expressway dropped
twenty columns onto the roadway below.  Cars and trucks were
buried in rubble, and others collided with the crashing
concrete. Eyewitnesses counted more than 150 cars involved in
the mess that was formerly one of the most traveled freeways in
the country. More than 75 people died immediately and another
250 were trapped or injured. Emergency units, if they could have
been dispatched by the silent emergency transmitters, would have
had great difficulty in getting to the scene.
<P>
A few seconds more, and another orange ball of fire engulfed
more than 200 arriving commuters, who had just gotten off a
train at Union station.  More than a hundred were badly burned
and dozens more had been struck by flying schrapnel. The lights
had gone out in the cavernous station, at approximately the same
time, which added to the confusion and panic. Railroad employees
and police attempted to contain the crowd, but dozens more were
trampled as the fleeing crowd pushed to the exits.
<P>
Almost concurrent with the Union Station Blast, another
detonation lit up the subway station at State and Randolph.
Unfortunately for the commuters, a Southbound train had just
pulled into the station, just as Shalima had anticipated. The
resulting carnage torn an enormous hole in the side of the train
car and started a fire.  More than 45 of the passengers were
killed outright in the initial blast.  Another 150 were burned
by the flames that engulfed the platform. A ticket agent, who
had a hard-wired direct line to CTA dispatchers, immediately
requested fire and EMS assistance.
<P>
Within minutes the first arriving fire, police, and EMS
responders arrived on the scene and immediately requested an EMS
plan III and a 2-11 alarm for the fire. Due to transmitter
problems, they were unaware of the other major emergencies that
were unfolding all over "the loop".  As the paramedics and
firefighters set to work, triaging all seriously injured people
and beginning treatment for the living; police officers were
searching the wreckage for any kind of a clue as to what had
happened. Then the second fiery eruption went off.  More than 40
police officers, firefighters, and paramedics were charred
beyond recognition in the resulting blast. 
<P>
As the first firefighters were arriving on the scene of the
subway explosion and fire, another boom reverberated through the
canyons of downtown Chicago. The carbomb, with it's awesome
power had collapsed the building that housed the Israeli embassy
and broken windows and caused structural damage, for a radius of
more than three blocks. Hundreds of people were reported trapped
in the still flaming hulk of what was once a proud part of the
Chicago skyline. Dozens of bystanders, people walking to work,
were immediately killed by the blast and fireball.  Dozens more
were killed by the flying glass and debris that was generated by
the powerful explosion. The only thing worse than the carnage on
Wacker Drive was the fact that it would be a long time before
other emergency responders could arrive on the scene to help
those that had survived the initial blast.  They would die in
the pain and agony of this latest terrorist atrocity.
<P>
Fact?, Fantasy?, or Reality?  Would it be this easy for a small
band of five terrorists to wound and kill hundreds, or even
thousands, of people and completely disrupt life in Chicago?  Is
it possible that Chicago, or any other large city for that
matter, is this vulnerable to the heinousness of an extremist
attack?  The answer is yes, according to Clark Staten, Executive
Director of the Chicago-based Emergency Response & Research
Institute.
<P>
"The problem involves the open values and freedom that we so
dearly defend", the veteran emergency analyst said. "The
openness of our society affords the dedicated extremist any
number of available outlets for his murderous intent", Staten
continued. "Americans just will not tolerate the level of
security precautions that have been implemented in London, Rome,
Paris, or in many other European and Mid-Eastern countries", he
added. "Therefore, we are at risk...in Chicago...in New
York...in Los Angeles...and elsewhere".
<P>
Staten said that even though the American level of awareness
regarding terrorism has risen since the World Trade Center
bombing, that most people, and even some emergency responders,
do not take the threat seriously.  He admits that the streets of
the United States are not as potentially dangerous as those of
Tel Aviv or London, but warns that may only be a matter of time
before another American city is struck by a terrorist attack.
<P>  
A recent ENN analysis of both activities and public
announcements by members of the Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, Hamas,
Islamic Salvation Front, and the Popular Front For the
Liberation of Palestine(PFLP) have all shown increasing
hostility and antagonism towards the United States.  Even
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has spoken out
publicly against America, in major demonstrations held this week
in Tehran. Intelligence sources say that this sort of rhetoric
often precedes an actual attack.
<P>
Staten says that America's long-time support of Israel and,
specifically, it's efforts regarding the Israeli/PLO peace
accord have been a source of anger among many Moslem extremist
countries and organizations.  Additionally, the fact that
America is currently holding and prosecuting Sheik Omar Abdul
Rahman and eleven of his followers, does not sit well with those
dedicated to the Jihad, or "Holy War".  And, President Clinton's
recent action to freeze the assets of suspected extremist
organizations has added fuel to the fundamentalist fire.
<P> 
Staten said that analysts from ERRI have been following the
actions and rhetoric of a number of Middle-East sources and have
concluded that the current threat level is as high as it has
been at any time since the World Trade Center bombing. They say
that their conclusions should prompt an increased state of
awareness on the part of both public officials and the public in
general. Staten concluded by saying, "this latest information
should prompt precaution...not panic...we must be aware of the
threat in order to thwart the bloodthirsty hopes of those that
would oppose both America and the Mid-East peace process".

<H3>INVASION OF THE CYBERPUNKS</H3>
<BR>
By Clark Staten
<P>
Chicago, IL - The modem lights blink as a screeching sound
signifies that the two computers have established a
connection.  Like thousands of other "data calls" that are
transmitted throughout the country each day, this call may be
an innocuous transfer of some numbers from one company's
spreadsheet to another.  But, then again, it also may be the
work of a member of the little known techno-underground . . . 
of a so-called "Cyberpunk".
<P>

Who or what is a "cyberpunk"?  He is typically in his late
teens or early 20's, extremely bright, is introverted, has
owned or worked with computers for several years, and
probably doesn't have much respect for what the
counter-culture calls "the establishment".  Many cyberpunks
are the best and brightest of the computer hacker
evolutionary chain.  Most spend much their time
"on-line" in the sightless and quiet "cyberspace world" of
datastreams, modems, and computer software.
<P>

The terms "cyberspace" and "cyberpunk" evolved from the world
of science fiction writers and stories.  Early in the 1980's,
a novel called "Neuromancer", written by William Gibson,
helped to shape the image of a cyberpunk.  Reportedly, he took
many of his themes from "underground rock-and-rollers" of the
punk-music scene and transferred the aggressiveness and
seditiousness to the use of computer technology.  The actual
term "cyberpunk" was reportedly coined by a short story
writer by the name of Bruce Bethke.
<P>

Many of today's cyberpunks were believed to be the better
educated and more radical "hackers" of the early 80's. In the
early days of "hacking", most practitioners did not intend to
cause damage to the computer systems that they invaded.
Early "hackers" were not generally considered
malicious. In fact, to be termed a "hacker" was originally
considered a compliment. In its earlier context, "hacker"
meant someone who could fashion a workable way to generate
effective computer code, often to solve difficult software
problems.
<P>

Most hackers say that they were simply exploring other
computers and trying to learn more about computers and
programming.  They point to the exaggerated costs of computer
hardware, software, and programming tools in the early
1980's, and most say that they just wanted to "borrow" some
information or programs.  The challenge, they say, was simply
to gain entrance into college, business, and government
computers and learn something others didn't know.
<P>

As time went on, the challenges became fewer, information
seemed more frightening, and some hackers began to develop a
very definite attitude toward the government and multi-
national corporations that they were invading.  Some
bored and talented hackers/programmers began to experiment
with writing computer code that caused various kinds of
real and imaginary malfunctions to occur, when executed.
These now infamous codes have come to be known as a computer
viruses.  Scores of these crippling or even destructive
viruses are written and unleashed on unsuspecting computer
users every year.
<P>

Others went in other directions, and used more sophisticated
methods of manipulating both the telephone systems and the
user interfaces of computers all over the world. Various
colors ( blue, black, etc.) of electronic boxes were built
for the purposes of "phone phreaking" or breaking into
regional phone networks and subverting them to provide for
many hours of free phone calls for the cyberpunks to explore
more distant computers.  Various strategies were developed
for dialing into and out of private companies to use their
telephone accounts free and to disguise the routes of the
actual connections that the cyberpunks used.
<P>

As the frequency of intrusion increased, and the more
aggressive "punks" began to experiment with stealing
corporate and military secrets, and planting evil "Logic
Bombs", "Worms", and "Trojan Horses" to cause computers to
self-destruct.  Federal law enforcement agencies were called
in to stop the trespasses.  In 1990, the FBI and Secret
Service undertook an operation called "SUNDEVIL". Raids were
conducted on private BBS's (Bulletin Board Systems) that
supported or even fostered the cyberpunk mystique and allowed
the "punks" collectively to communicate and share information
that would help others to break into new and different
computer systems.
<P>

A similar investigation and raid was conducted in the
Chicago, IL. area, in 1991.  Evidence had been collected by
federal officials that some segments of computer control code
that were used in the 911 emergency telephone system by
Southwestern and Illinois Bell had been compromised by
Illinois cyberpunks.  Confiscation of another BBS and a large
amount of computer software was undertaken in the Illinois
raid.  Questions of illegal entry, possession of copyrighted
material, and issues of proprietary license began to be heard
in federal court.  But, the arrests and seizures haven't
seemed to disrupt or discourage the new breed of hackers.
<P>

October, 1992 brought the report of an arrest of a 23 year
old Newark, NJ man, identified only as "Maverick" by press
reports.  "Maverick" reportedly was arrested in an
investigation involving disruption of the 911 telephone
service in the New York area.  Two other arrests are expected
soon of teenagers who may have also participated in the plot.
"Maverick" reportedly has been described by unofficial
sources as being a member of a cyberpunk group called the
`Legion of Doom'.  The "Legion" has been identified by
various law enforcement agencies as a prime source of illegal
information and activity.
<P>

Concurrently, Toronto, Canada police reportedly have arrested
a fifteen (15) year old boy who is charged with misdirecting
emergency medical service (EMS) crews and calling in false
medical calls by home computer modem.  More interesting, are
the charges that the youth routed his calls through telephone
exchanges in the United States to confuse telephone security
tracking systems. According to Toronto police sources, they
believe that the boy was also involved in a group of
cyberpunks, who were using 911 telephone systems as a
"prank".  Toronto police say that this prank could
potentially cost someone's life, if essential EMS crews were
duped into responding to false calls, while someone actually
needed medical care.
<P>

Not as ominous, but surely just as unlawful, was the recent
(Nov., 1992) arrest of three (3) teenagers in Brooksville,
FL.  The high school honor students have been accused of
making tens of thousands of dollars worth of long distance
phone calls.  Reportedly, the group had used a home computer
to tap into the private company's private branch exchanges
(PBXs) and Southeastern Bell telephone lines to correspond
and exchange computer information across the country.
According to press reports, a single company lost more than
$35,000 worth of phone calls.
<P>

Some science and computer writers seem to show a certain
commiseration with the cyberpunks, and even suggest that they
could be a positive force for resisting "global oppression of
the masses" by monitoring governments and multi-national
corporations and dispensing `politically incorrect' secrets
to the exposure of the media.  Others report the vast
capability of cyberpunks to cause the "electronic
destruction" of computer systems used for national defense,
banking, communications, nuclear power, transportation, and
other vital services.  At least one unidentified cyberpunk
has been quoted by as saying that, "with current level of
knowledge and the way computer networks are structured, we
have the capability to shut down everything . . . not just
locally...but globally".
<P>

Are cyberpunks a force for good or evil . . .  or merely an
extension of an emerging pop subculture that is using the
advanced, available, technology to express a point of view?
Fueled by movies such as THE TERMINATOR, ROBOCOP, and
BLADERUNNER, cyberpunks seem a natural futuristic
extension of the rebellion that is youth.  The major question
that is remaining is whether the cyberpunks will lead
us to freedom of expression and understanding . . . or,
possibly, to the destruction of the electronic society as we know it.

<H3>FIREFIGHTERS WORK EXTRA HARD ON CHRISTMAS...</H3>
By Steve Macko
<P>
Members of the Boston Fire Department rescued 15 people from a
6 Alarm fire on Box 514 at 1170 Commonwealth Avenue in the city's
Brighton Section, during the early hours of Christmas Day.  Heavy
smoke conditions were reported in the 3-story brick 9-flat apartment
building with dimensions of 75x100.
<P>
Residents of the building were forced to flee to rear porches and
fire escapes because the smoke was so thick in the building's corridors.
A Boston Fire Department spokesman said, "You litterally couldn't see
your hand in front of your face."  When firefighters arrived at about
0435 EST, they found several people shouting for help from the upper
floors in the rear of the fire building.  The alley, behind the building,
was blocked by parked cars, so firefighters could not move the apparatus
close enough to help affect rescues.  But the Boston Fire Department
is world reknown for their ladder work.  BFD members grabbed ground
ladders and rescued all of the trapped residents.
<P>

Six firefighters were injured in this spectacular blaze.  The worst
injuries came to Firefighter John Steiner, a 6-year veteran.  Steiner,
while affecting rescues, fell from a second floor window.  He was
transported to Masschusetts General Hospital by EMS with a collapsed
lung, a compound fracture to his elbow, a broken wrist and possible rib 
injuries.  Five other firefighters suffered minor injuries ranging
from smoke inhalation and burns to a pulled back muscle.
<P>

Boston Fire Commissioner Martin Pierce praised his men for their
efforts.  Pierce said that they did "an outstanding job under very
tough conditions."
<P>

Other victims involved in fires in other parts of the United States
were not as lucky as the people in Boston, on Christmas Day.  In
Portland, Oregon, fire swept through a wood frame dwelling and
killed two people, a mother and her teenage son.  Seven other people
in the home were injured.  Cause of the blaze is still under investigation.
<P>

A 3rd Alarm on Box 1484 at 807 43rd Street in Brooklyn, New York,
killed a 75-year-old man and his 69-year-old wife.  Fire was in a
3-story brick rowhouse 20x80.  Heavy smoke conditions were reported
by FDNY personnel when they arrived at about 0225 EST.

<TITLE>State Patrol to Assist in Camden, NJ</TITLE>

<H3>New Jersey Troopers to Assist in Camden</H3>
New Jersey state troopers are being immediately sent to the city of
Camden to help the beleagured police department that is overwhelmed
by homicides, street gangs, drugs and even an especially high number
of domestic violence.
<P>
The state troopers will be part of a task force that includes federal,
state and county agencies.  Camden is located across the Delaware River
from Philadelphia and has a population of 87,000.  The task force plans
to conduct drug and gun raids, stop auto thieves, set up roadblocks and
enforce alcohol laws.
<P>
Unlike Gary, Indiana, where state troopers recently left after assisting
local police for two months, New Jersey state troopers will stay in 
Camden for as long as they are needed.
<P>
This year, Camden has recorded 57 murders.  In comparison, Aurora, 
Illinois, which has a population of 100,000 has had 25 homicides in
1995 -- and that is considered to be a high number of a city with a
high crime rate.  Authorities said that most of the murders in Camden
have been drug-related.  Camden also allegedly has more domestic abuse reports than any other city in New Jersey.
<P>
State troopers have helped in Camden before.  Troopers were assigned to
patrol in the city from late 1992 to mid-1994.  Camden mayor Arnold
Webster said that his city "doesn't have the resources to deal with
these problems...we welcome the additional help."

<H2>Hobart, Tasmania Shooting Rampage; Worst Massacre in Australia</H2>
Special Report by Jeremy Zakis
<P>
<HR>
28/04/1996-04:16a.m. (CDT)
<BR>

To EmergencyNet News Services,
<P>

More news has now come in about the Shooting Massacre in Hobart, Tasmania:
<P>

The shooting occurred around mid-afternoon at the Historic Tourist attraction of Port Arthur near Hobart. Initial reports were that a person had been locked in the boot of a burning car. Followed by reports of a man with a high powered rifle shooting at people.
<P>

After shooting several people at Port Arthur, the man made his way 2 Kilometers up the road to the 'Fox and Hound Resort' where he opened fire again. He then escaped to the Seaside Guest House where he is presently.
<P>

According to Television Channel's Nine and Seven, the toll is now at least 25 people dead and 15 others are wounded. A seige is now in progress around a Seaside Guest House where the man is believed to be holding hostages and shooting at helicopters.
<P>

About 200 police are in the area with Special Task Forces on the scene and all roads and tracks are sealed around the seige area. All available helicopters are being used to ferry the injured to hospital. It has been confirmed that this is now Australia's worst massacre in it's history.
<P>

I will keep you posted whenever more reports become available.
<P>

<BR>

To EmergencyNet News Service,
<P>

Here is the latest on the Tasmanian Massacre as of 9:15pm Tasmanian Local Time:
<P>

It has been confirmed that 25 people have been killed and that 17 people have been badly wounded so far. Among the dead are children including a baby. Unconfirmed reports say that some of the victims were incinerated in a car as the gunman set cars and buildings alight.
<P>

The gunman has been described as a young 'surfie' type with blonde hair and that just prior to the shooting, had been chatting freely at a kiosk. 
<P>

According to Tasmanian Police Commission John Johnson, the weapon used by the gunman is 'presumably an automatic'. And that at this point in time, negotiators are talking by phone with the man. It is possible that he may have three or more hostages inside the guest house. It has been reported that he has fired shots at police from the house.
<P>

Police have now cordoned off the township and according to Commissioner Johnson, it would be 'Very difficult to escape' from the guest house.
<P>

Police forces in Victoria and New South Wales have been called for assistance to help resolve the situation.
<P>

Regards,
<BR>
Jeremy Zakis

<BR>

To EmergencyNet News Service,
<P>

The death toll in todays massacre at Port Arthur Tourist attraction has been confirmed at more than 30. Police are continuing to find more bodies in the dark as they search the area. 18 people remain in hospital at this point in time with 4 on the critical list, 4 in a serious condition and 10 in a satisfactory condition.
<P>

It appears the gunman was purposely looking to kill tourists. One witness has stated that the gunman said 'There are a lot of wasps around here today, there's not many Japs here are there?' then he muttered something before moving into the Kiosk and started the shooting at around 3:30pm. It appears the gunman moved outside after that and started shooting at the tourist buses killing 2 or 3 on each plus a driver, before making his way to the "Fox and Hound Resort" in a rental car according to witnesses. An unconfirmed report also says that at this time the gunman also forced some hostages into the boot (Trunk) of a car and locked them in. Then he apparently set the car alight burning them to death.
<P>

He then opened fire at the resort killing several more before he and his three hostages were pursued by police through thick vegetation to the guest house. Negotiations are continuing but police are almost certain that he has several semi-automatic weapons with enough ammunition to hold police at bay for hours.
<P>

Australian Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, has released a statement calling it "a shocking and senseless act". The Tasmanian Police Commissioner made a direct appeal to the gunman a short while ago using the nations television services calling for him to give himself in as he has already done enough damage.
<P>

At 10:35pm tonight it was reported that police believe the death toll may now be more than 40 as more and more bodies are found. The gunman continues to fire at anything that moves near the guest house while police continue to negotiate over the phone. 
<P>

Special News Bulletins are continuing to bring news as it happens but it appears the seige may take hours to be resolved.
<P>

-That will be all from me for tonight as I need to get some sleep. I hope that my reports have been of some use even though they may seem a bit hastily typed up. Due to limited source access most of the reports have been made up from television reports on all the Australian Networks but hopefully this gives you some idea of the events that unfolded in Tasmania today. I shall try to send some more reports tommorrow as more events unfold.
<P>

<H2>757 Down in Ocean, 189 Feared Dead</H2>
By: Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>
189 passengers and crew members of a jetliner that had just
taken off from a Dominican Republican airport were feared
killed on Tuesday night when the plane apparently plunged into
the Atlantic Ocean.  The charter flight was bound for Frankfort,
Germany via Newfoundland, Canada.
<P>

Only small pieces of the plane were seen floating in the water
by rescuers.  Only about a dozen bodies had been recovered before
dawn.  The wreckage is said to be strewn across a two-mile long
stretch of the ocean.  Sharks were seen in the area of the crash
and it appeared that some of the recovered bodies had been mangled
by the sharks.  An officer for the United States Coast Guard, who
was involved in the recovery, said, "The area is shark-infested.
It obviously would hamper recovery of either survivors or bodies
from the water."
<P>

The plane disappeared from radar screens about five minutes after
taking off from the airport in Puerto Plata.  The plane took-off
at 2343 EST during a light rainshower.  The deputy director for
civil aeronautics in the Dominican Republic said, "The pilot
gave no indication of an emergency."  A conflicting report said
that the pilot had indicated a problem of unknown origin prior to
the crash and was attempting to return to the field. The jetliner 
was reportedly able to gain an altitude of 5,000 feet 
and was 12 miles off the coast of the Dominican Republic when
it disappeared from radar screens.
<P>

United States Coast Guard ships and planes were sent to the
scene of the crash to assist in the rescue/recovery.  A Coast
Guard petty officer said, "We found a wreckage field of about
50 to 100 yards wide and two miles long, and very small pieces
floating on the water.  There are no large pieces of the plane
to be seen."  No cause of the crash has been determined, but
an investigation has been begun. As of mid-day Wednesday, 
the bodies of 79 victims had been recovered.

<TITLE>Chicago Crime Rates Down</TITLE>

<B>LEAD STORY: 01/01/96-11:00CST</B>
<BR>
<H3>CHICAGO MURDER RATE DROP...</H3>
By Steve Macko
<P>

Statistically speaking, 1995 was a good year for the Chicago Police
Department (CPD).  Major decreases in virtually every category of
crime was recorded in the past year.  The category most talked about,
of course, was homicides.  Unofficially, as the year grew to a close,
Chicago had 810 murders in 1995.  That number was down from 923
homicides recorded in 1994.
<P>

This downward trend in murders happened in almost every major
United States city in the past year.  The homicides in New York City
dropped by almost one-third.  FBI statistics indicated that murders
in the U.S. were down by about 12 percent.  Violent crime, as a whole,
was said to be down by 5 percent in the first half of the year.
<P>

Police and crime experts are still trying to figure out the real reasons
for this decrease in crime.  There are several possible answers.
Police say that among them could be Chicago's community policing project
and more resources going toward direct street enforcement.

Criminologists do agree that some credit should be given to the 
fine job that the CPD and other departments are doing -- but 
other reasons should also be considered.  These include: an 
increase in the number of criminals that are being
incarcerated for longer periods of time, changing demographics in
a trend towards re-urbanization, and an apparent stabilization in
the illegal drug market.
<P>

As of this moment, all of the official statistics are not in.  But
there has been a significant drop in the other areas of major crime
in Chicago.  As of the end of November, robberies were down by 
11 percent.  There was a 9 percent drop in auto theft.  An 8 percent
drop has been recorded in burglaries.  Rape has decreased by 5 percent
and assaults were down 2 percent.  One other huge decrease was 
recorded in the number of carjackings.  They were down a whopping
29 percent, according to CPD statistics.
<P>

Even Chicago's toughest and roughest areas saw a decline in crime
in 1995.  Most of the violent crime still occurs on the City's West
and South Sides.  Crime in areas like the 11th Police District, on
the West Side, are still fueled by the same historic factors of
street gang rivlary, drug abuse, poverty and unemployment.
<P>

The Chicago Police Department recorded a 24 percent drop in 
gang-related killings in the past year.  Drug-related murders were
said to be down 22 percent.  The CPD says that they have been
concentrating in these two areas of crime and that their efforts are 
now paying off.
<P>

One area of concern may be what is known as stranger-on-stranger
homicides which are now becoming more common.  And this particular
type of crime may be the reason for rising public fear, even though 
crime statistics show that actual crime rates are down.  Current statistics 
show that only 45 percent of murder victims actually knew their
killers.  During the 1960's, 71 percent of murder victims knew who
their killers were.  This statistic is also reflected by the drop
in the number of homicides that the police now clear.  Conventional
methods of homicide investigation dictate that when looking for a
murderer, you look at your victim's background and who he knew.  In
that way you are able to obtain leads toward your suspect.  But when
your victim does not know the suspect -- your investigation is much 
more difficult.  Leads tend to dry up quicker.
<P>

One criminal expert that does not take on the rosy outlook toward
recent statistics is Professor James Alan Fox at Northeastern
University in Boston.  Professor Fox notes that homicides and violent
crime anongst adults has declined in the past few years -- violent
crime among teenagers has soared.
<P>

Fox Said, "What you have in America is two crime trends moving in
opposite directions, one for adults and one for juveniles."  What
Professor Fox says is true.  The most recent available statistics
show that the number of murders committed by offenders aged 21-years
and older, in Chicago, went down from 461 in 1986 to 365 in 1994.
While virtually at the same time, murders committed by offenders aged 
20-years and younger, in Chicago, went up from 168 in 1985 to 448 
in 1994.
<P>

Professor Fox said that the number of teenagers will increase by
23 percent during the next ten years in the United States, and that
this new crop of teen criminals will most likely will cause a new wave
of crime.  Fox said, "If we spend too much time celebrating the
1995 statistics, we'll get blindsided by a new crime wave that will 
make 1995 look like the good old days."
<P>

Incarceration of more criminals, for longer periods of time, is
another factor that must be seriously considered in the current 
decrease in major crime.  There are more people than ever behind bars. 
The number of black criminals in prison vastly exceeded the number 
of white criminals in 1995, even though blacks make up only 13 percent of
the population of the United States.  The State of Texas corrections
system is now larger than the federal prison system.  There are
more convicts behind prison walls in Texas, alone, than in any other 
country on this planet, except for Russia and China.
<P>

More prisons are being built in the United States.  In fact, one
could say that it is a booming industry.  Judges are imposing 
stiffer prison sentences on criminals and in many instances, the
judges, themselves, don't have a choice.  The recent "three strikes
and you're out" in which criminals who have been convicted three 
times for serious crimes and they are locked up for life -- is
apparently taking its toll on "career" criminals.  Barbara Price,
the dean of graduate studies at the John Jay School of Criminal
Justice in New York City, said, "If criminals are out of circulation,
they can't commit more crimes."
<P>

Another reason for the decrease in crime that must be looked, according
to criminologists, is a less-volatile drug market.  In 1990, when
crack cocaine was introduced in large quantity in Chicago, drug dealers
and street gangs battled for sales turf.  When that happened, the
number of shootings and homicides went through the roof.  During the
1980's, before the advent of crack cocaine, the City averaged about
700 homicides per year.  During the early 1990's, Chicago was recording
about 850 murders per year.
<P>

One crime expert has compared the current drug market situation to
what happened in the 1920's when the infamous Al Capone and other
mobsters fought for control of the illegal liquor market.  During
the battle for sales turf, during the 1920's, homicides increased.
But once Capone finally gained control of the illegal booze trade,
the number of homicides went down.  That historic comparison appears
to be just as relevant to this day.
<P>

Will the decrease in violent crime and homicide continue on a
downward trend?  According to many criminologists, they fear that
what we are seeing is -- merely the calm before the storm.

fame.
<P>
<BR>
<HR> 
Preliminary Analysis:
<BR>
This could signal another escalation in "suicide bombs", 
particularly in Israel or against Jewish interests anywhere 
in the world.  The last time a major Islamic "player" was killed 
in Lebanon, the retribution took place in Argentina and the UK.  
Car bombs against Israeli embassies, commercial buildings, or other 
sites could be a possibility, and the risk of an attack against the
United States has increased. It is unlikely that Shakaki's
death will go unavenged...the question is where and when.

<H2>Firefighters in Pennsylvania Fight Both Fire and Ice </H2>

Four homes were destroyed and three others were damaged in a
4 Alarm fire in a flooded area in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on 
Monday morning.  The area had been evacuated over the weekend 
because the Susquehanna River had flooded on Saturday evening. 
<P>
Pennsylvania had been declared a federal disaster area
following a January seventh blizzard that dumped up to 32 inches
of snow on the state. A warming trend then turned the snow into raging streams and rivers.  State Governor Tom Ridge says the flooding caused widespread
damage in the western part of his state including the cities of Pittsburgh and Harrisburg.

Firefighters had to wade through the hip-deep, icy water to reach
the scene of the fire near the intersection of Front and Cannois. 
The mayor of Harrisburg said, "We've lost most of the whole side 
of one street.  It's nearly impossible to access, let alone fight 
a fire in that condition."
<P>

Front-end loaders were brought in to clear snow and ice so fire
apparatus could attempt to get closer to the scene of the blaze.
Firefighters were still hampered by four-feet of water in the
street.  Two firefighters were treated for hypothermia.
<P>

The fire started at about 0300 EST and took firefighters about
four hours to bring under control.  It is believed that the blaze
was caused by a short in an electrical box that was not turned off
at the time of the evacuation.

<H2>7.0 Earthquake Strikes Lijiang, China</H2>
By: Clark Staten and Steve Macko
<P>

In one of the dealiest earthquakes of the decade, a trembler measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale has reportedly struck the Lijiang region of China.  Early rescue reports say that at least 240 people are dead and another 3,800 seriously injured.
Experts expect the death toll to rise as rescuers continue to search and clear some of the estimated 186,000 buildings that were damaged in the quake.  According to the Red Cross Society of China, entire villages were destroyed and hundreds trapped by collapsed buildings and falling debris.
<P>
The quake hit the Lijiang region, which is located approximately
1,300 miles southwest of Beijing,  in southwestern Yunnan province. 
Three teams of several hundred doctors and nurses were sent to the scene
Several thousand soldiers and police were also sent into the stricken
area to help search for survivors. Calls are going out for international aid and requests for food, clothes, medicine, and quilts are being made.
<P>
Army helicopters were being used to move the injured to hospitals farther from the scene of the devastation, as all of the local hospitals were overwhelmed and people being turned away.  Concerns were raised by medical authorities that many, now with collapsed houses and no other shelter, would catch the flu or other infectious dieseases and an epidemic could result. Large parts of the region are lacking electricity, gas, and other basic services.  Temperatures there are well below freezing.
<P>
Foriegn tourists and townspeople alike were evacuated from hotels, hostels, and communes with many huddling around campfires.  Almost all admitted that they were afraid to return to already damaged buildings, as aftershocks continued to rock the region. At least 180 aftershocks have been registered by seismologists, with several exceeding 4.0 on the Richter scale.
<P>
Relief supplies and additional rescuers are starting to pour into the region, but Chinese officials on the scene said that they feared many more would die unless essential medicines, personnel, and equipment arrived within the next critical hours.

<BR>
NYPD HANDLING MULTIPLE SHOOTING INCIDENT, ROBBERY CHASE</H3>
<BR>
BY JIM FAY, ENN NYC/NJ CORRESPONDENT
<P>

While NYC is being blanketed by heavy snow, the NYPD is handling a multiple shooting incident in the Bronx, with at least nine people shot, and a chase of suspects from the adjacent Nassau County.
<P>

At about 1150 hrs., EST, Tuesday, December 19, a unit from the Bronx Highway Unit #1, called a "shots fired" run at the address of 2188 White Plains Road near Pelham Pkwy., in a shoe store at that location.
<P>

In what appears to be a botched robbery attempt, at least two robbers entered the store, interupted by the Highway Patrol Unit. Units from the local 49 and 43 NYPD Precincts also responded.
<P>

When the shooting was over, at least (9) people were shot, including the two perpetrators. Early reports indicate that (4) of the shot individuals were "likely to die."  No Police Officers were reported shot. All the victims were removed by NYC*EMS to Jacobi Hospital.
<P>

At about the same time, in another robbery, Nassau County (NY)  Police chased a vehicle into NYC's Borough of Queens. At the  Grand Central Pkwy. and 168 St., the robbers abandoned the  vehicle the were in, and an extensive search was on foot was made. Three of the four armed suspects were apprehended at the  Grand Central Pkwy. and Avon Ave. in Queens. A search of the fourth, who escaped in the car, is continuing.
<P>

It is reported that at least of foot of snow will be on the ground by tomorrow morning, Wednesday, December 20.

<h3>Fire News From Around the World 09/94<BR>
</H3>
Dateline; Chicago, IL, September 9, 1200CDT <P>
August 22, 1994<P>
<h3>Complex Series of Factors Cause Deaths of 14 Firefighters<P>
</H3>An investigation prepared by the U. S. Forest Service and the U.S. Bureau of Land management has found that the deaths of fourteen (14) firefighters in a Colorado wildfire were largely due to &quot;human error&quot;.  The report concluded that the tragic deaths of a team of elite &quot;smokejumpers&quot; and &quot;hotshots&quot; was due to a combination of preventable circumstances and &quot;breakdowns in communications&quot;, said Mike Dombeck, acting director of the Bureau of Land Management.  According to Dombeck, &quot;The fire behavior on July 6 could have been predicted on the basis of fuels, weather, and topography...but fire behavior information was not requested (by the firefighters) or provided...therefore critical information was not available for developing strategy or tactics.&quot;<P>
According to other witnesses, the veteran firefighters also made a number of tactical errors that contributed to their deaths.  These errors reportedly included constructing a fire line downhill, when the fire was below them, and inadequate planning of escape routes.  Among other lapses included in the report were; failures to alert the on-scene firefighters of a change in the weather, violations of eight (8) of ten (10) standard wildfire operating procedures, disregard of twelve (12) of the eighteen firefighter &quot;Watch Out&quot; situations, and a failure to alert the crews to the presence of a highly flammable type of tree on the hillside (Gambel Oak).<P>
Firefighters that lived through the ordeal, described fire conditions at the South Canyon fire as being &quot;horrendous&quot;.  One eyewitness said, &quot;The fire literally exploded behind the ridge...with 100 foot flame heights...at this point I decided to run...as I neared the top of the ridge a wall of flame 150 ft. high and a quarter of a mile wide was on the ridgetop and racing down the other side.&quot;<P>
The investigation revealed that the fatal injuries to the firefighters were caused as a wind-driven wall of flames came over a ridge and down the other side, while a separate firestorm was ascending the same hillside.  The fallen firefighters were caught in the middle, with few places to escape.  Controversy swirled, during the investigation, around the issue of whether or not the stricken firefighters used personal fire protection shelters, but experienced investigators admit that they probably would have made little difference, considering the fire conditions.<P>
According to Forest Service veterans, the all of the firefighters involved in the fatal accident were not &quot;rookies&quot; and many of them had fought numerous fires.  They say that it is possible that they disregarded some basic safety rules out of &quot;sheer fatigue&quot;, and/or &quot;familiarity on the fireground&quot; or nonchalance; after all, they had done this dozens of times and nothing bad had happened.  They said that this fire could result in some changes in procedures, but that the important point was that every firefighter, rookie or veteran, had to pay close attention to basic safety procedures.<P>

<h3>Senior Australian Fire Brigade Official &quot;Seconded&quot; to Commercial Firm <P>
</H3>In an unprecedented move, a senior Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade (MMFB) officer has been seconded to work for Knight, Frank, &amp; Hooker, a prominent commercial property management and real estate sales firm.  According to Emergency Services Minister Pat McNamara, this is a &quot;landmark&quot; deal that will provide an undisclosed amount of money (believed to be several hundred thousand dollars) for the Melbourne Fire Brigade, in exchange for a experienced fire officer to provide the firm with fire safety audits, to develop fire emergency procedures, and assist with fire safety training for building occupants.<P>
McNamara was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying, &quot;For the first time the MMFB will step into the commercial arena to market its first class services as an expert on fire and building safety.&quot;  McNamara also said that this was a &quot;prime example&quot; of the government's recent policy of marketing public sector &quot;specialists&quot; to the private sector.  The money paid for the fire officer's service on the Knight, Frank, &amp; Hooker board will reportedly be used to offset expenses of the MMFB.<P>
A spokesperson for the real estate firm, John Hull, was quoted as saying that this move might be used as a model to set up similar commercial arrangements in other Australian states.<P>

<h3>NFPA says Home Escape Plans Could Save Lives  <P>
</H3>Quoting American fire safety statistics, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) today announced that many more lives could be saved if families had a fire escape plan.  NFPA experts pointed to the fact that 78% of all fire deaths, that have occurred in the home, have happened when people are normally sleeping, between 02:00 a.m. and 04:00 a.m.  They say that many fire deaths occur because people aren't warned of a fire early enough, or that they become disoriented in the smoke and are unable to escape it.  The NFPA report says that these problems could be solved by some simple measures, such as installing a working smoke detector, carbon monoxide detector, and practicing home fire evacuation plans.<P>
Fire prevention specialists report that most fire death victims never see flames, that they are overcome by poisonous carbon monoxide fumes.  The NFPA urged families to contact their local fire department in order to help to plan their family fire safety strategy.  Some basic components of an effective plan might include:<P>
1. Install smoke detectors on every level of the home. keep them         clean and dust free. Check and change the batteries on a              scheduled basis.<P>
2. With your children, draw a floor plan of every level of your          home. Designate fire exits, including one for each bedroom.           Also designate a safe meeting place, outside the home, where          family members should meet in the case of emergency.<P>
3. After preparing the diagram, have all family members                  (especially children) practice actually escaping from the             home.  Everyone should practice crawling to the nearest safe          exit, if that is safely possible. <P>
4. Children should practice touching and opening doors to see if          they are &quot;hot&quot; and how to recognize the need to use another            exit                     <P>
5. If they are unable to exit from the door to their room they           should learn how to open windows and wave a sheet or piece of         clothing to gain attention of arriving firefighters.<P>
6. Every family should have a multi-rated fire-extinguisher and          know how to use it on small or smoldering fires.<P>
7. Warn children to NEVER hide from a fire, and to automatically         go to a firefighter or police officer, should they be                 separated from their family during an emergency.<P>
Fire prevention educators say that many more lives could be saved, if parents and children would take a little time to plan for emergencies and to actually practice these fire safe behaviors.<P>

<h3>British Columbia Officials Declare &quot;Environmental Emergency&quot;<P>
</H3>The provincial government of British Columbia today declared an &quot;Environmental Emergency&quot; condition in regard to the discovery of several barrels of what are believed to be toxic materials.  The barrels were found at the Rainy-Hallow site, which is adjacent to the Tatshenshini-Alesk Wilderness Park.  The site is very near to one of the largest Bald Eagle refuge areas on the North American Continent.<P>
According to B.C. Environmental Minister Moe Sihota, he has dispatched a clean-up and containment team to the area.  Sihota is quoted by the Reuters News service as saying; &quot;Cleaning up these dangerous toxics and protecting the area from further contamination is our top priority.&quot;   The minister also criticized the U.S. government and military for their alleged involvement in the original dumping of the barrels into the wilderness area.  Reportedly, the U.S. has denied the dumping the barrels of potentially deadly DDT and Dioxins at an oil pumping site for the Alaskan Pipeline.  A U.S. government spokesperson said that the military had not occupied the site since 1974, and had no knowledge of the toxic dump described by Canadian officials.<P>
B.C. government officials said that they had been tipped off about the &quot;environmental emergency&quot; by a little-known group called the &quot;Alaska Clear Water Alliance&quot;.  The government spokesperson said that the alliance had actually found only one barrel of DDT (Pesticide), but feared that many more would be found in the area.  Additional fears were expressed that the barrels would leach into ground water and leak into the Khehini River and contaminate Eagle breeding grounds in nearby areas.<P>
August 14, 1994<P>
<h3>Australian Volunteer Firefighters Call for&quot;Standardization&quot; <P>
</H3>At the 12th Annual Australian Assembly of Volunteer Fire Brigade Associations, representatives of over 280,000 Australian volunteer firefighters called for sweeping changes in both fire brigade equipment and procedures. The meeting, held in Hobart, Australia, reportedly reviewed the performance of volunteer and professional firefighters, in regard to major fires that occurred in New South Wales earlier this year.  As the result of this review, several recommendations were to be sent to national fire authorities for consideration.<P>
One of the major problems, found by the volunteers, was that the various fire brigades were divided into municipal and metropolitan subdivisions and that they could not effectively interface, should that be necessary in the event of large disaster such as the New South Wales (NSW) fires.  A spokesperson for the organization said that there was no common radio frequency which allowed the various departments to talk to each other.  He said that in one instance, if firefighters used their normal radio frequencies that they would have been talking to &quot;the local taxi service&quot;.  Further, he said that fire companies operating at the same scene, and in line of sight, couldn't talk between themselves to coordinate tactics.  One firefighter commented that, at the NSW fires, that the use of a cellular phone was probably the most effective communications tool, but that the cellular frequencies were always busy during the fire.<P>
There was also discussion, at the meeting, regarding the compatibility of hoses, hydrants, and pumpers and the fact that they all didn't have the necessary threading and sizes to allow them to interoperate. The volunteer firefighters expressed their concerns that this incompatibility could lead to injury and possibly even death, should fire apparatus from differing jurisdictions need to quickly work together to provide water to attacking firefighters.<P>
The results of the volunteers recommendations were gathered into a comprehensive report and were to be forwarded to the Australian Fire Authority Council in Melbourne.<P>
September 9, 1994<P>
<h3>Hong Kong Firefighters Search For Survivors in Building Collapse<P>
</H3>Five people were killed and several others injured when a building suddenly collapsed on a busy street in downtown Hong Kong. The building, which was being demolished by a construction crew, reportedly failed, sending tons of concrete and debris onto  unsuspecting passerbys here on Friday.  According to eyewitnesses, the front of the Wing On department store crashed through an overhead protective barrier and buried the victims.  <P>
Hong Kong Fire Brigade members were called to scene and were using overhead cranes and other heavy lift equipment to remove massive concrete boulders from the stricken.  Fire trucks and ambulances were seen screaming down the busy and crowded Nathan Road, where the collapse had occurred. At least four people were successfully rescued from the rubble and transported alive to area hospitals.  Five bodies, two woman and three men, were recovered from the debris and declared dead at the scene.<P>
Building department officials cordoned off the area out of fears of additional collapse. Three sides of the building remained standing, although unstable and potentially hazardous.  The cause of the collapse is unknown at the time of this report, but government officials promised a thorough investigation.<P>
September 7, 1994<P>
<h3>Moscow Police Station Explodes; Six Killed,  Dozens Injured <P>
</H3>At least three explosions rippled through a Moscow police station on Wednesday, with sections of the station collapsing following the blasts. The Emergencies Ministry, at first, announced the deaths of ten (10) people, but later accounts revised the death toll downward.  The police station was located in the Eastern district of Vykhino, and had received no prior warning of any sort of danger.<P>
According to eyewitness reports, Moscow firefighters were on the scene for many hours sifting through the rubble and performing rescues.  A report from the Itar-Tass news agency said that many people were buried and they were being dug from the debris by hand.  Sounds of entombed people were said to be heard for several hours into the rescue effort, and several of those found were said to have suffered critical injuries. Dozens were thought to have been transported to several area hospitals. <P>
The cause of the explosions, thought to be three in number, was immediately unknown, although speculation of a terrorist or &quot;gangster&quot; bombing was heard from several sources.  The Tass agency said that the first explosion was thought to have exploded in an area of the building where internal travel papers were processed.  Police said that an area-wide investigation would be conducted and that &quot;the strictest measures would be taken against those involved in this outrage&quot;, should they be caught.<P>

<H2>BRATTON'S TEAM FALLS, KEY PLAYERS OUT</H2>
By Jim Fay  ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

When NYC Police Commissioner William Bratton setup
his administration within the NYPD, he chose young,
yet experienced, superior officers to do the day-to-day
running of the Department. Rather then take the next in
line for crucial appointments, Bratton searched for
those further down the chain of command.  The results
were outstanding.
<P>

His 1st Deputy Police Commissioner (who literally runs
the Department) was John Timoney, a street cop throughout
his thirty year career.  The Chief of Department was
Louis Anemone, a street wise supervisor,
known for his aggressive, hands on way of operating.
Even as Chief of Department, Anemone used a fully marked
NYPD car with five stars on the license plate. When he
didn't have a driver (with the rank of Captain or above),
he was often seen driving himself, responding to initial
radio runs throughout the city. Others who have held that
rank used Department unmarked cars and usually wore suits
and tie, rather than uniforms.
<P>

The third appointment made by Bratton was Jack Maple.
Maple became acquainted with Bratton while Maple was
a Transit Police Lieutenant, when Bratton was the Chief
of Transit.  When Bratton left Transit for a return trip
to Boston, he took Maple with him.  When they returned
to NYC, Maple was appointed Deputy Police Commissioner
in charge of crime strategies. Maple is easily identified
on the streets and in Police Headquarters with is
brown and white shoes, his bowler hat, and bow tie,
and can often be seen yelling at Borough Chiefs and their
assistants at crime strategy meetings.
<P>

Howard Safir has recently been appointed NYC Police
Commissioner to replace Bratton on April 15.  The
transition was suppose to be smooth. But John Timoney,
who was considered a front runner to take Bratton's
place, but was not selected, decided to take some potshots
at the new commissioner.  Timoney called Safir a "light-
weight," referring to his limited police experience, and
called Mayor Rudolph Guiliani, "a little crazy."
Timoney had his retirement papers in when he said that,
but they were effective April 15.  However, Mayor
Giuliani took offense to Timoney's remarks and ordered
him on a leave of absence until his retirement became
effective.  Timoney was left out of the transition team.
<P>

Yesterday, to the shock of NYPD watchers, Jack Maple
resigned from his Deputy Commissioner's post. Just two
days before, press reports recorded Maple as saying that
he would be there until "we start locking up people with
ray guns."  Whether this was done at the urging of Safir
or Giuliani, or if Commissioner Bratton offered Maple
a position with him in the corporate world, is unknown at
this time. But what is obvious is that Safir will have
to start from scratch in setting up his team, a team that
will follow "Team Bratton," and his many successes in
the crime fighting area.
<P>

The goal for Giuliani is to "keep the numbers down" for
the remaining two years of his term. There are many to
choose from within the ranks of the NYPD. Safir will have
to be careful to select those that will not go back to
"business as usual," something very hard to do in a job
known for, "you scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours,"
and select those who are willing to do a job that will
make them no friends and probably alienate some old ones.

<H2>Air Force Lieutenant Turned Firefighter Called Hero</H2>

United States Air Force First Lt. David M. Curry, age 26 from
Duluth, Georgia, turned into a firefighter on Friday night.
Curry helped rescue two people from a burning house and then
returned into the fire building and helped contained the fire.
<P>

Lt. Curry said that he was driving through the Hungarian town
of Kaposavar on official business when he saw a large number of
people watching a house on fire.  Curry said, "I was doing an
errand in town when I saw a thick plume of smoke coming from a
house.  There were 100 to 150 people watching, so I figured it
must be taken care of."
<P>

Curry than just drove past the scene, but he then decided to go
back and take a second look ... something didn't look right to
him.  When he returned to the burning building, he noticed that
the front door was closed.  Curry said, "People don't normally 
close the door behind them when they leave a burning building, so
I asked if anyone had been brought out and, of course, no one had.
Everyone was just watching the house burn down!"
<P>

Lt. Curry made his way through the crowd and kicked the door in.
He helped a small boy and his mother to safety outside of the
burning building and then returned and helped the father battle
the fire upstairs until firefighters arrived.
<P>

Curry said, "As I fought my way through the crowd, everyone looked
at me as if I was from another planet.  But afterwards, the woman's
mother came up to me, put her hand on her heart and just said,
"Ah, Americans!"
<P>

After doing all he could at the scene, Curry returned to his office
and collapsed.  He had suffered smoke inhalation and was hospitalized
overnight on Friday.  Lt. Curry is part of 3,000 troops who are
stationed in Hungary to support the Bosnian peace mission.

<H2>Phoenix Task Force Undertakes Gang Crackdown</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

Authorities in Phoenix, Arizona, announced a massive crackdown
on some of the largest and most violent street gangs.  More
than 100 suspects were targeted during a two-day sweep that
happened on Thursday and Friday (Mar 14-15th, 1996).  More than 150 
law enforcement officers arrested about 70 adults and juveniles who 
are said to be members of about six Phoenix-area street gangs.
Most of the suspects were arrested for illegal selling of weapons
and stolen vehicles.  One south Phoenix gang was heavily targeted
by the task force -- the Wetback street gang.
<P>

Officers during the raids recovered about $1.4 million in stolen
property and guns.  A source told ENN that the vast quantity of  
weapons that were seized were sawed-off, single-shot shotguns.
This sweep was said to probably be the largest of its kind in the 
history of the Phoenix metropolitan area.  The suspects arrested 
will face various charges, including federal firearm violations.
<P>

Bruce Gebhardt, the Special-Agent-In-Charge of the FBI's Phoenix
field office said that the raids was meant to send a message,
most of all, to the Wetback gang.  Gebhardt said, "The message is
that this is a highly professional and motivated task force.  It
has the capability to investigate, infiltrate, arrest and prosecute
you for your criminal activities."
<P>

This operation was said to be a part of an on-going strategy that
is patterned to the same kind of successful strategy that the FBI 
uses against organized crime syndicates.  The crimes committed by
members of organized street gangs are treated as a single criminal
enterprise rather than unconnected, individual crimes committed by
gangbangers.  If convicted of running a criminal enterprise,
defendants can look forward to a life sentence in prison.

<TITLE>Drug Resistant Tuberculosis</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H4>Emerging Infectious Diseases
Outbreak of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis
at a Hospital -- New York City, 1991</H4>
<P>
<B>From:  Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), vol. 42, no. 
22, dated June 11, 1993.</B>
<P>
     From January 1991 through July 1992, multidrug- resistant
(i.e., resistant to at least isoniazid [INH] and rifampin [RIF])
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) was isolated from 43 (22%) of
198 patients with newly diagnosed TB at a New York City hospital.
This report summarizes an epidemiologic investigation by the
hospital infection-control, infectious diseases, and employee
services staffs and presents information for the 32 patients in
whom MDR-TB was diagnosed during January 1991-March 1992 (these
were the only patients for whom complete information was
available and analyzed).
<P>
     A case was defined as a TB isolate resistant to at least INH
and RIF from a person who had been treated as an inpatient from
December 1990 through March 1992. Sixteen (50%) patients were
men; mean age was 37 years (range: 22-78 years). Of the 32
patients, 29 (91%) have died; all 29 were seropositive for human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Of those remaining, one was
seronegative, and two refused testing. Thirty-one had been
patients on the HIV ward and had been treated for complications
of HIV infection. In addition to INH and RIF resistance, isolates
from 29 (91%) of the 32 patients were resistant to ethambutol and
streptomycin.
<P>
     Of the 32 inpatients with MDR-TB, 28 (88%) had documented
exposure to an infectious MDR-TB patient while in the hospital 30
or more days before being diagnosed with TB. Transmission of
MDR-TB was not documented to patients other than those on wards
with other MDR-TB patients. Isolates from 18 patients studied
with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis had the
same DNA pattern, suggesting transmission of a common strain.
<P>
     During November 1991, tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) were
administered to the 21 health-care workers (HCWs) with negative
TSTs in the previous year but who were regularly assigned to the
HIV inpatient unit. Of these, TSTs were reactive (i.e., greater
than or equal to 5 mm induration) for 12 (57%): seven nurses,
four aides, and one clerical worker. Chest roentgenograms
performed on all TST-reactive HCWs were negative, and none had
become symptomatic as of mid-July 1992. HCWs had not used
respiratory protection during the period transmission was
documented (January 1991-March 1992).
<P>
     Hospital charts of all persons with MDR-TB were reviewed to
determine patients' HIV status, drug use, and previous history of
TB diagnosis and hospitalization. TB was not initially suspected
in 16 case-patients, and acid-fast bacillus (AFB) precautions
either had not been used or were instituted late during
hospitalization. Health-care workers observed that MDR-TB
patients (before and/or after diagnosis) frequently left their
rooms to visit other patients, meet visitors, or walk to the day
room. Doors to the patient rooms in the HIV ward were frequently
left open.
<P>
     An environmental investigation of the ventilation system for
the HIV unit revealed that all rooms were at positive pressure
with respect to the hall. The exhaust vents were nonfunctional
because they were obstructed with dust and dirt.
<P>
     Control measures implemented since January 1991 have
included repairs of the ventilation system and restoration of
negative pressure to the isolation rooms, educating clinicians
regarding the need to consider TB in all patients with fever and
respiratory symptoms, institution of AFB isolation (i.e., placing
patients in negative-pressure rooms) for any patient with
suspected or confirmed TB, and rapid microbiologic evaluation of
HIV-infected patients for TB. In April 1993, the hospital opened
one ward that had been modified to serve as a TB unit; all rooms
meet the CDC AFB isolation room recommendations (i.e., negative
pressure, at least six air exchanges per hour, and air exhausted
to the outside away from intake vents, persons, and animals [1]).

<P>

Editorial Note: Since 1989, eight nosocomial MDR-TB outbreaks
have been documented by CDC in the United States (2-4; CDC,
unpublished data). The outbreak described in this report involved
HIV-infected patients who were not recognized as being infected
with TB or were not suspected of having MDR-TB and who had been
housed on a dedicated HIV ward; delays in disease recognition
consequently delayed initiation of appropriate isolation (i.e.,
negative-pressure rooms or confinement to rooms).
<P>
     In this report, HCWs also were at risk for infection.
Factors that may have contributed to infection of the HCWs were
the inability to properly isolate patients with MDR-TB in
negative-pressure rooms, exposure to inadequately masked
infectious MDR-TB patients, and/or inadequate respiratory
protection of HCWs. Identification of HCWs infected with TB
requires active surveillance and TST programs (1).
<P>
     The findings in this report and investigation of other
MDR-TB outbreaks underscore the importance of fully implementing
CDC guidelines for preventing TB transmission in health-care
settings (1). In one national survey, approximately 27% of U.S.
hospitals had no rooms with AFB isolation facilities (5), and
capabilities of many laboratories to isolate, identify, and
determine antimicrobial susceptibility of M. tuberculosis
isolates are limited (6).
<P>
     
The morbidity and mortality associated with MDR-TB outbreaks
emphasize the need for implementation of guidelines that include
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1) education of clinicians to consider TB in any patient with
fever and respiratory symptoms, particularly among
immunocompromised persons;
<LI> 2) effective AFB isolation of
suspected/confirmed TB patients;
<LI> 3) early institution of
effective treatment regimens
<LI> 4)appropriate follow-up of
discharged patients
</UL>
<P>
(7). Consideration should be given to
treating all patients with directly observed therapy to insure
that all antituberculous medications are taken for the full
course of therapy 
<P>
(8). In addition, patients exposed to other
patients with infectious TB for whom effective AFB isolation was
not in place should be identified, evaluated for TB infection and
disease, and evaluated for preventive therapy once active TB has
been ruled out (1,8).

<H2>THE FBI'S CRITICAL INCIDENT RESPONSE GROUP...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor
<P>

The town of Jordan, Montana, is located in Garfield County.
Garfield County is so vast that it is almost the size of
the entire state of Connecticut.  Currently, there are
about 150 agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Garfield County Sheriff's deputies and members of the
Montana Highway Patrol conducting "loose" perimeter patrols
around a 960-acre property that is known as "Justus Township."
<P>

"Justus Township" is not an officially recognized governmental
body, but it is home of the militant group known as the "Freemen."
The law enforcement officers outside of the property are working
very hard to ensure that this situation doesn't explode into
another bloody Waco or Ruby Ridge. 
<P> 

The potential for a bloody conflict is very high.  The Freemen
are known to be well armed.  So the FBI works to negotiate a
peaceful end to this standoff.  How long will it take?  No one
knows.
<P>

What is known is that FBI officials are prepared for a long
siege.  The thing that is most noticeable with the FBI agents
is ... patience.  They are equipped with everything that they
may need -- M-16 rifles, body armor, sidearms.  But they know
that the thing that need most, in this situation, is ... patience.
<P>

Clint Van Zandt is a former FBI behavior expert.  Van Zandt said
that the effort to decrease the chances of an armed clash "is
really the first outing" of the Bureau's new approach to crisis
management.
<P>

Handling the Freemen siege is the FBI's new Critical Incident
Response Group.  This team brings in all of the FBI's crisis
units.  The Hostage Rescue Team, additional FBI SWAT personnel,
hostage negotiators, behavorial scientists and other specialists.
This team has set up shop in what is being called a high-tech
command post.
<P>

The Critical Incident Response Group was created in 1994 and is
headed by 25-year FBI veteran Robin Montgomery.  Specialists
who monitor the FBI say that Montgomery has taken an expansive
view of his role and has been known to consult outside sources
to seek the answers that he needs to help resolve a situation. Many say this is a rational approach that may prove beneficial in the future.
<P>

The acknowledged mistakes made at Waco and Ruby Ridge led to
the creation of the FBI's new unit.  The idea, of course, is
to not repeat those past mistakes.  An assessment of the Waco
and Ruby Ridge incidents revealed that there were problems with
the FBI's command structure and specific management strategies of hostage/barricade
situations.
<P>

Some examples of past mistakes, that have now been corrected,
are: At Ruby Ridge, the operations plan of the FBI did not
include any negotiations and the FBI's chief negotiator was
not invited into discussions on strategy.  A U.S. Justice 
Department review found "much evidence that a negotiation 
strategy was not the highest priority."
<P>

At Waco, a report written by Harvard law professor Alan Stone,
found that "negotiators and tactical units were at times
operating independently in an uncoordinated and counterproductive
fashion." Independent experts suggest that a more "integrated approach", 
utilizing all available resources in concert, seems a more productive approach.
<P>

However, when it comes to the way that the FBI is handling
the Freemen situation, everyone, including past critics such as
Professor Stone, are giving the FBI "high marks." Clint Van Zandt explains, "You've got a lot of senior commanders now who fully understand the prior mistakes."
<P>
The situation in Jordan, Montana, continues.

<H2>Riot in Yatala Prison; Guards Injured</H2>
By Jeremy Zakis, ENN Australian Correspondent
<P>

ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA (ENN) - The riot in the Yatala Labor Prison 
which started on Monday, ended peacefully Tuesday morning at 
approximately 2:10am, ending the tense 11-hour seige which involved 
more than 100 heavily armed police.  The three remaining prison guards 
being held hostage were released and all 31 rioting prisoners of 
'B-Division' returned to their cells. The guards all suffered cuts and bruising inflicted by the prisoners who bashed them.
<P>

Rioting prisoner's had negotiated with police several hours earlier asking
for their grievances to be published in the media. Their wishes came true
when Correctional Services Department's chief executive officer, Ms Sue
Vardon, went public on network television and announced their grievances.
<P>

The prisoners demanded equal treatment to be given to Special Protectee's
in the prison who were receiving special treatment. This was not the first
time they had demanded this as several times before, their complaints were
ignored.
<P>

The four prison officers, including the one released at the start of the
riot, are now recovering in the Royal Adelaide Hospital and are expected to
make a full recovery. At Yatala cleanup continues to the vandalised cell
block and offices while an independant judicial inquiry is being called
into the incident.

<H2>NEW YORK CITY'S NEW 911 EMERGENCY SYSTEM...</H2>
By Steve Macko
<P>

The New York City Police Department unveiled its new $156 million
super 911 emergency system on Tuesday at the NYPD's new Metro Tech
Complex in Brooklyn.  The new Enhanced 911 system is said to be
the most advanced in the world.
<P>

The general contractor for the installation of the system was
SHL International Public Safety Group.  They said that the
system is the largest and most complex public safety system in
the world.
<P>

One feature that will be new to the 911 operators will be the
instantaneous information of the caller's location and phone
number.  This is not a new feature, but new to New York City.  The
main new feature is the speed in which calls will be answered.
Most 911 systems allow a 911 operator to answer another call
after a ten second delay.  New York's system has only a two
second delay per call per operator.  The system also has a
very advanced back-up system.
<P>

In 1995, ten million calls were made to New York City's 911
system.  Police officials say that number increases by 10
to 12 percent each year.
<P>

The new system was implemented on an experimental basis in the
borough of Staten Island on December 18th.  On Tuesday, the
system went on-line in all of New York City's five boroughs.
Due to the large size and scope of the new system, it is being
implemented in three phases: telephone, computer-aided dispatch
(CAD) and radio. 
<P> 

The telephone system portion has now gone on-line.  In March, the 
new CAD system will be implemented.  It is said that the new CAD
system will allow communication between different NYC agencies.
For example, the Fire Department will be able to send a computer
message to the appropriate Police Department dispatcher to request
NYPD cars to block off a certain intersection during a fire.  The
computer-aided dispatch system will also give instant information
regarding past incidents at a certain location.
<P>

In April, the NYPD's radio system will be upgraded.  In June,
Mobile Data Terminals (MDT) will begin to be installed in city 
police cars.  The MDT's will be able to give police officers 
information about incidents that they are responding to.

<H3>ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER ASSASSINATED...</H3><P>
<P>
By Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor<P>
<BR>
Yitzhak Rabin, the 73-year-old prime minister of Israel was assassinated<BR>
by a lone gunman at the King's Square in front of the City Hall in Tel Aviv <BR>
at a little after 10:00 p.m. on Saturday night.  Just moments before the <BR>
shooting, Rabin had given a speech in front of about 80,000 people at a <BR>
festive peace rally.  Witnesses said that as the prime minister was leaving <BR>
and about to get into his car a gunman fired three shots at close range.  <BR>
Rabin was struck, according to the Israeli Health Minister, in the chest, <BR>
spleen and spine.  The prime minister was immediately taken to Ichilov <BR>
Hospital in Tel Aviv.  He reportedly arrived at the hospital unconscious <BR>
and without a pulse or blood pressure.  Rabin was immediately rushed to <BR>
emergency surgery and died at about 11:10 p.m. on the operating table.<BR>
<P>
Later, outside Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital, Rabin's spokesman Eytan Haber<BR>
made the following announcement: &quot;The government of Israel <BR>
announces with astonishment and deep sorrow the death of Prime Minister<BR>
Yitzhak Rabin who was murdered by an assassin tonight in Tel Aviv.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Witnesses to the shooting told reporters that Rabin was about to enter<BR>
his car when the shots were fired.  One witness said that he heard two<BR>
or three shots and &quot;I saw Rabin holding his stomach.  I don't know exactly<BR>
where he was shot, but he was holding his whole body and then he fell on<BR>
the ground.&quot;  The witness said that security guards hovered over their<BR>
charge and then two more shots were fired.  The assassin was then thrown<BR>
against a wall by dozens of police officers.  
<P>
It was known that in recent weeks security had been tightened around the <BR>
prime minister.  Another witness described what he saw -- &quot;I was standing<BR>
three meters from the car.  Rabin was walking down the steps, talking to<BR>
people, waving to people and smiling.  He was in front of the car, waved<BR>
his hand and suddenly I heard three shots.  Then I saw Rabin go down.<BR>
He was pushed into the car and surrounded by many security people with<BR>
their guns drawn.  The car left and then we saw on the side security<BR>
people surrounding a man who was on the ground.  The security people<BR>
shouted at us to lie on the ground and they waved their hands to go down.&quot;<BR>
<P>
One other witness said, &quot;We didn't grasp that these were shots.  We<BR>
thought somebody threw something.  There weren't many people there, it<BR>
was very dark.&quot; Word of the shooting had reached the ENN News Desk<BR> 
at a little past 1400 CST and the EmergencyNet NEWS Service issued the<BR> 
following flash report:<BR>
<BR>
<P>
****ENN News Flash*** 14:20hrs. CST 11/04/95<BR>
<P>
Prime Minister Rabin of Israel has reportedly been shot <BR>
leaving an otherwise peaceful &quot;pro-peace rally&quot; in Tel Aviv. Israeli<BR>
radio and an emergency service source are saying that Rabin was shot<BR>
three times in the back and shoulder and is in critical condition. <BR>
Witnesses at the hospital say that Rabin was &quot;covered in blood&quot; <BR>
upon his arrival at the hospital.<BR>
<P>
An alleged gunman is in custody and a little known &quot;right-wing&quot; <BR> 
Israeli group called &quot;INE&quot; is claiming responsibility for the shooting. <BR> Details are sketchy at the time of this report, but it would appear that the<BR>
assailant was an Israeli citizen who disagreed with Rabin's policies.<BR>
<P>
ENN is gathering additional details, but this event is sure to have major<BR> 
political ramifications.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
                                ^^^<BR>
<P>
<BR>
Security personnel at the scene of the murder immediately captured the<BR>
assassin.  He is identified as 27-year-old Yigal Amir.  Amir confessed<BR>
to the shooting of the prime minister and told authorities that God told<BR>
him to commit the deed and that he had no regrets.  Amir told investigators<BR>
that he was acting alone.  The gunman is said to be a third-year law<BR>
student at Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv, which is said to be a<BR>
religious school.  Police said that the gunman was not married and is<BR>
a reserve IDF soldier assigned to the elite Golani brigade.  He lived<BR>
in the town of Herzliya, which is located just north of Tel Aviv.  It<BR>
was reported that Amir, in the past, worked as a security guard and<BR>
had a license to carry a pistol.<P>
<P>
Police quoted the assassin as saying, &quot;I acted alone on God's orders<BR>
and I have no regrets.&quot;   When told that Rabin had died on the operating<BR>
table, the gunman told his interrogators, &quot;I'm satisfied.&quot;<BR>
A government spokesman said this about the assassin -- &quot;He belonged to<BR>
some Jewish organization which is anti-government and against the peace<BR>
process.&quot;  There have been reports that Amir has been linked to a group<BR>
called Eyal, which is reported to be a radical anti-Arab Kach movement<BR>
that was founded by the late Rabbi Meir Kahane.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
The leader of Eyal said on Israeli radio about the gunman, &quot;We know him<BR>
from our activities.  But he is not a member of our movement and we deny<BR>
any connection to the incident, and condemn such actions.&quot;<BR>
A fellow student of the assassin said that Amir was becoming more and<BR>
more agitated after each shooting and bombing attack that was conducted<BR>
by Muslim militants in Israel.  The student who knows Amir, said, &quot;After<BR>
every terrorist attack, after every murderous act, there were demonstrations.<BR>
He (Amir) would say, 'We have to stick it to Rabin and his government.'<BR>
This man expressed himself for quite a long time in a very extremist<BR>
manner.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<P>
There are reports that the assassin may had tried twice before to get<BR>
close enough to Rabin in an attempt to kill him.  One of those times<BR>
may had been just after January 20th of this year, after 21 Israelis<BR>
were killed in a terrorist suicide bombing.Foreign Minister Shimon Peres,<BR> 
a former prime minister of the country, has assumed the leadership of the <BR>
Israeli government in the interim. Peres was only yards away from Rabin <BR> 
when he was shot.<BR>
<P>
It is believed that the shooting will trigger a government crackdown on<BR>
right-wing extremist groups in Israel.  Right-wing elements in Israel<BR>
are very much opposed to the peace process with Palestinians and are<BR>
very upset about government plans to withdraw from parts of the West Bank.<BR>
It is estimated that there are between 200 to 300 hard-core extremists<BR>
who will probably be targeted by the Israeli security services.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
The funeral for the slain prime minister will be held on Monday in<BR>
Jerusalem.  Israeli security, police, and IDF personnel will now<BR>
prepare for the monumental headache that they will have in preparing<BR>
security arrangements for several world leaders who will attend the<BR>
funeral.  Known to be coming to Israel are: Presidents Clinton, Ford,<BR>
and Carter, former Secretary's of State Baker and Kissinger from the<BR>
United States, Chancellor Helmut Kohl from Germany, Prime Minister<BR>
John Major of the United Kingdom, King Hussein of Jordon, President<BR>
Hosni Mubarek of Egypt and United Nations Secretary General Boutros<BR>
Boutros-Ghali.  A police spokesman said, &quot;We are ready for all <BR>
possibilities.  We will not take any chances.  Thousands of police<BR>
will be there.&quot;<BR>
<P>
The director of Israel's Shinbet, the internal security service of<BR>
Israel, cut short a trip in the United States and immediately returned<BR>
to Israel to help open an investigation into how the assassin got past<BR>
Rabin's security detail.  The investigation will look into why the<BR>
elite bodyguards did not spot Amir.  Personnel assigned to protect the<BR>
prime minister and other key officials in Israel are selected from<BR>
elite IDF commando units and are renown for their cool professionalism.<BR>
This publication will report more on the security surrounding the <BR>
prime minister in Monday's report.<BR>

<H3>EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE AT THE FRONT</H3>
<BR>
By Clark Staten, EMT-P, I/C
<P>
Chicago, IL.  The evidence is mounting that the Allied ground
offensive may begin at almost any time.  Multiple small
skirmishes and probes are being conducted all along the
Saudi/Kuwait border.  Marine amphibious units are at sea and
along the beaches in the Northeastern part of Saudi Arabia,
North of Khafji.
<P>

Marine General Neil, and Army Gen. Kelley say that the
Coalition forces are ready to move as soon as President Bush
gives the orders.  Gen. "Stormin Norman" Schwartzkoph
describes the Iraqi troops as being "demoralized" and "on the
verge of collapse".  The elite Iraqi "Republican Guard" has
been pounded, both day and night, by B-52s and other Allied
aircraft.  Iraqi soldiers are defecting in droves and
surrendering to American, Saudi, and other Coalition forces.
Military strategists indicate that it may now be possible to
launch the largest military offensive since the D-Day
Invasion at Normandy.
<P>

Undoubtedly, there will be casualties; there always are in
battles of this magnitude. The next question that comes to
mind is what kind of medical care will the wounded Coalition
forces receive?  In order to answer that question and examine
the state of emergency medical care in the Persian Gulf,
let's follow a typical soldier from the battlefront through
the process of care...
<P>
<HR>
<H4>SOMEWHERE IN NORTHERN SAUDI ARABIA</H4>
<BR>
SGT. Warren Smith of the 24th Regiment of the 1st Infantry
Division buckled his web-gear and tightened his "flak jacket"
as he and his infantry squad climbed into their M-3 Bradley
fighting vehicle.  The word had finally come to move out.
As the driver fired up the diesel engine of the Bradley, all
of the men "locked and cocked" their weapons.  The gunner in
the turret of the  Bradley `jacked' a round into the breech
of the 25mm cannon and double checked the "TOW" missle
launcher.  SGT. Smith's Bradley, which was aptly named
"Father of Battles", began to form up on a staggered column
of other Bradleys and M1 tanks.  Overhead, a flight of AH-1S
Huey Cobra attack helicopters swarmed towards the Kuwaiti
border.
<P>

After crossing several small berms of sand that SGt. Smith's
crew had already reconnoitered, they moved rapidly towards
the rising smoke and sand that was evident on the breaking
twilight.  It was "0-DARK-thirty" when the men had been
roused from their listening posts and tents to begin the
early morning assault on the dug-in positions of the Iraqi
troops.
<P>

As they approach the first anti-tank ditch, they note the
digging that has been done by the combat engineer battalions
and follow the track provided. It is marked with tape that is
visible with their night-vision "Starlight Scopes". They also
note that it appears that several mines have been exploded in
the vicinity of their trail.  As they rumbled forward, SGT
Smith's Bradley begins to receive small arms fire from an
emplaced position on his left flank.
<P>

The radio crackles, "Bulldog 6 to Redeye flight...Bulldog 6
to Redeye flight.....fire mission on an enemy bunker....what
have you got??".  SGT. Smith hears his Company Commander call
the FAC (Forward Air Controller) and request an airstrike
on the bunker complex to the company's left flank.  The FAC
acknowledges Capt. Lewis's request and advises him that two
A-10As are immediately in the area.  The famous "Warthogs"
have a particularly lethal weapon's load.  SGT Smith has seen
the A-10 30mm cannon, which fires 2,100 rounds a minute,
completely "chew-up and spit out" a Soviet BMP in practice
AirLand battle training.  Shortly, the two squat, ugly, sand
colored jets streak in from the west and strafed and bombed
the bunker complex. Firing from that direction ceases.
<P>

The Bradley is continually engaging small "spider-hole" size
emplacements of troops who are using AK-47 Kalashnikov
assault rifles.  SGT. Smith's troopers engage the Iraqi
troops through the firing ports on the Bradley.  The gunner
continually fires the 25mm auto-cannon at larger or more
hardened targets. He hits a Soviet BMP fighting vehicle that
becomes visable after rounding a small wadi (ravine). The
radio crackles again, "BullDog 6 to Bulldog 3....Bulldog 6 to
Bulldog 3...".  "Bulldog 3" was SGT Smith's call-sign on the
company radio net. SGT Smith picked up the mike and shouted
over the roar of the Bradley's strained engine, "BullDog 3 to
BullDog 6...Go!!".  "BullDog 6 to BullDog 3...Dismount and
engage that emplaced artillery battery at 45 degrees true"
SGT Smith answered, "Roger..BullDog 6...Wilco...BullDog 3
out".
<P>

SGT Smith and his squad dismounted at a run.  They were
heavily armed to engage the enemy infantry that was
protecting the artillery and missile launchers.  The Squad
carried an M-60 Machine Gun, two M248 Squad Automatic Weapons
(SAW), and modified M-16A2 rifles which included the 40mm
Grenade launcher in the M203 configuration.  Rifle rounds and
mortar fire were striking the sand near the squad.  As SGT
Smith and PFC Andrews crawled towards the safety of a nearby
wadi, the now familiar sound of AK-47s increased in
intensity.  Suddenly, PFC Andrews was thrown up in the air as
a mortar round impacted near his position.  SGT Smith
screamed for the squad medic!  "Medic...Medic...Medic to the
front!!!"
<P>
As Spec.4 Brown crawled towards them, SGT Smith withdrew the
trauma dressing from PFC Andrews web-gear.  He placed it on
an angry wound in the young PFC's chest.  After noticing that
it was "sucking" air, SGT Smith removed the plastic wrapping
from the battle dressing and placed it on the wound first,
before securing the `tails' of the dressing.  SGT Smith knew
that this would stop air from entering the chest wall and
keep the lung from collapsing.  As Spec.4 Brown scrambled
into the wadi, he noticed the proficient method that SGT
Smith had used to sealed the chest wound.
<P>

Spec.4 Brown had recently completed the new U.S. Army
Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) program at Ft. Sam
Houston, Texas. It was similar to that taught to civilian
ambulance attendants in urban America, but focused on those
skills needed to treat the traumatically injuried victim.
In that program he had learned to assess and stabilize
battlefield casualties prior to them being transported to
field hospitals or hospital ships.  SGT Smith yelled to
Spec.4 Rodriguez, who was carrying the squad radio, "Hey
Sammy...get on the horn and get us a `Dust-off' for Andrews!"
Specialist Rodriguez knew that SGT Smith was asking for an
"BlackHawk" or "Huey UH-1H" aeromedical evacuation
helicopter,that had become so familar during the Viet Nam
War, more than twenty-years before.
<P>
As Specialist Brown checked Andrews vital signs, SGT Smith
assisted him in bandaging several lacerations and assessing
his level of consciousness. It was extremely likely that PFC
Andrews had suffered a concussion and loss of consciousness.
With his major shrapnel wound to the chest, Brown knew that
Andrews was a priority patient; he needed decompression of
his chest and intravenous therapy at the earliest
opportunity.  Specialist Rodriguez was attempting to call in
the "Medivac" helicopter, but was told by the Battalion Radio
net that "it is too hot in your AO (Area of Operations)...
"we've dispatched a `Medic-Track' to your location for
extraction of your U.S. W.I.A. (Wounded in Action)".
<P>

Soon an M-1 Tank and a M-2 Bradley with large Red Crosses on
the side came into view.  PFC Andrews was placed on a
stretcher and lifted into the mounting brackets inside the
specially designed and equipped tracked vehicle.  The Bradley
reversed his course and moved back towards Saudi Arabia.  SGT
Smith and his men watched as a flight of F-15E "strike
Eagles" strafed the artillery detachment and destroyed a
large cache of ammunition. SGT Smith and his men returned to
the battle.  PFC Andrews had entered the U.S.  Army Emergency
Medical System.
<P>
While travelling at 35 m.p.h., the Bradley medic checked the
battle dressings that had been placed on PFC Andrews. He re-
calibrated an Intravenous-line of Lactated Ringers in
Andrew's arm and repositioned a burn dressing on his leg.  He
also administered an ampule of morphine to the now moaning
Private First Class.  Soon, the Bradley arrived at a marked
flat area that was approximately 10 kilometers from the
actual fighting. Several UH-60 "Blackhawk" aeromedical
evacuation helicopters were arriving and departing the
improvised "chopper pad". Several men were standing nearby
and talking on UHF and VHF radios, coordinating the
destinations of patients that were being collected here from
several points on the battlefield.  A large security
contingent of Saudi and British Infantry Fighting vehicles
were guarding the perimeter.
<P>
PFC Andrews was quickly assessed by a "triage team" of a
doctor and two nurses.  The Physician inserted a " one-way
dart" into the intercostal space above Andrew's lung injury
in order to insure that the lung would not collapse. An
additonal I.V. was inserted into his other arm and oxygen was
given to Andrews.  After initial triage, Andrews was found to
be losing consciousness from an internal loss of blood and
shock. The Doctor inserted an airway, put on an anti-shock
garment and directed the badly injuried PFC toward the next
"out-bound chopper".  As the Aircraft Commander gathered the
collective and kicked the high performance "Blackhawk" into a
hard right bank, the co-pilot was clicking in the appropriate
radio frequency for the 85th Medical Clearing Hospital
(Commonly known as Med-Base America).
<P>
After establishing the radio link, the co-pilot turned the
radio traffic over to the flight medic who was attending
three patients in the rear of the helicopter. "Go ahead
Doc..give them a progress report", the chief warrant officer
intoned into the on-board intercom.  The flight medic
acknowledged, "Roger that Mr. Goff...Dustoff niner-seven-five
to Med-Base America...we are inbound to your location with
three W.I.A.s, two of which are flesh wounds and
lacerations...I also have a sucking chest wound with a loss
of consciousness..he is rousable by pain..has two I.V.s and
M.A.S.T. suit, his chest was decompressed by a doc at the
forward clearing station....Do you copy Med-Base??". The
radio squaked, " Roger.. Dustoff niner-seven-five...what's
your ETA (Estimated time of arrival)?".  The medic responded,
"Med-Base...we are approximately 1-Zero minutes from your
location".   "Roger...niner-seven-five...we have a bed for
you...Out!".
<P>
As the powerful twin turbine engines pushed the rotors that
beat the hot desert air, the flight medic rechecked each of 
his patients, with particular attention for PFC Andrews.  Just 
as he was completing his reassessment, the intercom crackled,
"Doc..we're zero-two minutes from touchdown...anything
else?".  "Negative, Chief....we got it", he said as he and
the crew chief began to prepare to unload the the stretchers.
The helicopter settled gently to the ground.  A knot of
doctors, nurses, and medics gathered at the door to help
unload the patients. They are quickly moved into inflatable
and tent triage centers.  Doctors and nurses move quickly
around them and reassess the status of the patients and
decide in what order they need to be taken to surgery.
<P>
PFC Andrews is getting hypotensive, but is essentially
stable.  He is chosen for immediate surgery, stripped, washed
and prepped for surgical intervention. A suction device is
attached to a chest tube, which will be then be inserted into
Andrews chest.  Exploratory surgery of his abdomen and chest
will insure that he doesn't have any internal bleeders that
might threaten his recovery.  An experienced trauma surgeon
and medical team will monitor his vitals and the extent of
his brain injury. He will then be closed and given
antibiotics to prevent infections.  If his burns require
immediate grafting, they will be given preliminary
debridement and enmeshed in a protective covering.
<P>
PFC Andrews will be continually monitored until he is stable
enough to be transported to Riyadh or another major airbase
for a U.S. Air Force MAC (Military Airlift Command) flight
out of the theatre.  It is likely that he will then be taken
to Italy, Germany, or another Coalition country for more
extensive care and rehabilitation.  It is possible that he
will be transported directly to the United States, if his
medical condition permits. Once there, he will enter the
AU.S. Military hospital system, the Veterans Administration
Hospital system or the National Disaster Medical System and
be placed in a civilian hospital bed that is contracted for
by the U.S. Government.
<P>
PFC Andrews was extremely lucky and was provided with a
system of military medicine that has learned a great deal
from the civilian practice of trauma surgery. The concepts
and experience learned on the "mean streets" of New York,
Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, and other urban areas
may have helped the wounded soldiers of "Desert Storm".
Many physicans who practice in civilian trauma centers have
been recalled into the reserves for the duration of the
conflict and practice those skills that have been "honed" by
treating high-velocity gunshot wounds caused by "drug-wars"
and other domestic violence.  These skills would seem to have
been life-saving for PFC Andrews and other "Desert Storm"
participants.

<H3>TERRORISM INCREASES WORLDWIDE</H3>
<BR>
Chicago, IL.  As predicted by the U.S. Department of State
and Israeli government, terrorist activity throughout the
world has increased in frequency and intensity.  Recent
reports indicate that a total of nine (9) policemen were
killed Saturday at a Bullfight ring in Medellin, Columbia.
Another IRA attack is reported in London, England and
increased activity continues in other parts of the world.
<P>

Two separate bombings took place in London involving the IRA
and mass transit. According to Scotland Yard, at least one
person was killed and forty (40) others injuried in two
separate bombings that occured on 02-18-91. One happened at
the famous Victoria Station and the other at Paddington
station during the morning rush hour.  While London police
and British anti-terrorist authorities denied the possible
involvement of any activity concerning the Persian Gulf war,
American intelligence and other anti-terrorist analysts
issued statements indicating that the IRA bombings may have
been perpetrated in sympathy with the Iraq regime. The two
bombs follow a previous mortar attack on Whitehall that
occured on 02-07-91.
<P>

In a related story, at least three bombings occured in
Beirut, Lebanon.  A car bomb went off near the French
Embassy, a Syrian Army car exploded near the Lebanon-Gulf
bank, and another bomb exploded near the Metropolitan bank
with four (4) injuries.  Officials report that the latest
bombings bring to seventeen (17), the total number of
bombings of coalition related businesses and government
buildings in Beirut, since the beginning of the Persian Gulf
conflict.
<P>

Anti-terrorist analysts in Chicago report that that the
latest attacks bring the total of incidents since the
beginning of the Persian Gulf conflict to one-hundred and
sixteen (116); resulting in the deaths of at least 14 people
and injuries to more than 200.  This number far exceeds any
one month period preceeding the war and reflects the
increased activity that is indicative of Iraq "calling in
it's markers" for the support that it has provided to various
"revolutionary cells" for the past several years.

<br>
Length: 65 feet, 11 inches. <br>
Wingspan: 43 feet, 4 inches. <br>
Speed: In excess of 600mph<br>
Weight: 52,500 pounds. <br>

Capability: Low radar signature enables this fighter to penetrate into well-defended airspace, largely undetected. While not 
invisible to enemy radar, it shows up so infrequently and for such a short time that the enemy has difficulty locking missiles 
onto the aircraft. Usually armed with laser-guided bombs or missiles . During the Persian Gulf War the F-117A was used 
to attack many first-day targets and was the only aircraft to bomb strategic targets in downtown Baghdad. No F-117s 
were ever reported hit by enemy fire. Boomerang shaped, the F-117's precisely angled surfaces and radar-absorbing paint 
and materials create the stealth effect. <br>

<TITLE>Egyptian Fire -Worst Since 1942</TITLE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 10:30CST
<P>
<H3>Egypt Fire Disaster Worst Since 1942</H3>
<BR>

Chicago, IL, November 3, 1994 -- In what is being described as the
worst fire disaster in more than half a century, 475 people are
believed dead in a freak flood/fire in Assiut Province, Egypt.
According to official sources, a train carrying fuel oil to a
military petroleum supply depot derailed in the midst of the
worst rainstorm in Egypt in sixty (60) years. Downed electrical
wires then ignited the viscous fuel and it floated on the flood
waters and spread through the Village of Dronka.  As if that
weren't bad enough, lightening then struck a fuel tank in the
depot and it also burst into flames. Two hundred and fifty eight
people reportedly perished in the initial "lava flow of fire" or
in a number of fires then caused by it.
<P>

At the time of this report, fires are still reportedly burning
out of control in several areas in Southern Egypt. Firefighters
and military troops dispatched to assist them are said to be
"overwhelmed" by this latest challenge. Fire officials say that
numerous buildings were ignited by the "burning flood" and that
they are still recovering bodies, more than twenty-four (24)
hours after the start of the tragic incident. Firefighters said
that the death toll is expected to rise as they continue to
search through the ruins of what was once a village of 22,000
people. More than 200 homes are known to have been completely
destroyed, either by fire or the deluge of rain. Many of the
residents have reportedly fled the scene, fearing that
"Judgement Day" had come.
<P> 

Samih el Saeed, Governor of Assiut Province, said that more than
two hundred (200) people were injured and that more than seventy
(70) had suffered extensive burns. He also said that more than
35 people were known to have drowned in other parts of the
province.  A local hospital spokesperson said that many of the
burn patients brought there are unexpected to live, because of
the severity of their injuries.  Medical supplies and personnel
are reported to be responding to the scene from Cairo, more than
200 miles (320km) to the North.  Another eighteen (18) bodies
were discovered early Thursday morning in the burnt out wreck
that was once an apartment building. Injuries and deaths are
also reported in Sohag and Qena provinces, but exact numbers are
difficult to obtain from the more remote areas of the Southern
desert.
<P>

Fire experts say that this unusual fire/flood combination and
its estimated 475 deaths exceeds the largest loss of life since
the infamous Coconut Grove fire in Boston, MA that occurred in
1942. Four hundred and ninety two (492) people lost their lives
in that blaze.

<center><H2>EMERGENCY SERVICES GUIDELINES FOR MEDIA AFFAIRS</H2></center>
              
<center>By Clark Staten, EMT-P, I/C 
<BR>             
District Commander, Bureau of EMS
<BR>                 
Chicago, IL. Fire Department</center>
<P>     

Today's world is in an information age; the events in the Persian Gulf war have accurately demonstrated the public's "thirst for news". It that seems to be endless. The methods of gathering news have also drastically changed in recent years.  Electronic news gathering (ENG) means that more and more news-gathering outlets are seemingly... constantly....everywhere. The availablity of audio and video satellite "up-links" means that news can be covered...any where.... any time.  Experience suggests that major disasters occuring in even extremely rural areas will be covered by helicopters, "satellite dish" trucks, and reporters with radio and cellular telephone capabilities which often exceed the resources of the agency attempting to manage the incident.
<P>   

It would also seem that reporters have a deep and unbridled interest in any type of incident that involves......gore, dismemberment, dying, or death.  While human suffering has been a continual source of morbid curiosity since the beginnning of time, it is far more likely that the true story rests in the need to complete the blank spaces in the pages of the paper, fill the endless hours of news radio, and to stir the emotions of television viewers.
<P>   

A question that is frequently asked is; why do reporters seem so insensitive to the plight of victims of injury or illness?  The answer may partially rest in the process of continued exposure to horrendous sights and sounds and the desensitizing (and emotionally saving) effect of psychological denial.  A secondary answer, undoubtedly involves some of the same motivations that allow emergency responders to continue to function....it's their job.  Just as emergency responders are required to attend to the often senseless mayhem and tragedy of disaster, reporters may not relish the thought of "wading through the `mud',`guts', and `blood' of today's major incidents, but, it is their livelihood.
<P>   

In light of this conflict of the public's right to know and the emergency responder's desire for patient confidentiality and "freedom to function without restriction or interruption", a common ground of understanding must be reached.  Regardless of whether or not an emergency responder wants the "media" to participate at an incident....they will!!  Therefore, it behooves the prudent emergency responder and/or manager to learn to understand and manage their response to the "media" rather than to allow the "media" to dictate the terms underwhich the relationship will take place.
<P>

 Several suggestions (Do's & Don't's) may prove useful in responding to inquiries of the press during and after an emergency incident.  In order to assist in this interchange, the following items are submitted for consideration:
<P>
<HR>  
<H3>DO's   </H3>

<UL>
<LI>1. Do have a media affairs plan that details who will be responsible for the dissemination of information at an incident.  Remember that reporters will want to speak to someone who can make an "official statement".  If   possible, designate an identifiable individual as the Public Information Officer (P.I.O.).  This person should normally be prepared to issue periodic statements on behalf of the agency that has jurisdiction for the management of the incident. It is suggested that this person be in a middle-management position and wear something distinctive to make him/her easily identifiable. 
<P>
<LI>2. Do issue a statement at the earliest possible on-set of the incident and try to update it as circumstances permit. Attempt to establish an area for the media and attempt to restrict them to that area.  Safety is paramount, and most media personnel are not aware of the dangers of an incident scene.  Explain it to them that way. Normally, the incident commander (I.C.) is not the person to answer questions during the continuation the incident.  He/she is, presumably, too busy managing the scene to spend time answering questions. After the "action" is over or at least under control, The I.C. should then be briefed by pertinent officers and then give a statement to the press. Questions can be answered, and the agency view of the incident provided in an organized manner.
<P>
<LI>3. All other emergency responders, at the scene, should know who the P.I.O. is and that they should refer anyone asking questions to the that person. Individual medics, firefighters, or police officers should be discouraged from "ad-libbing" answers to "potentially loaded questions", largely due to their limited view of the overall operation.  Avoid contraditions by channelling requests for information through senior managers and the P.I.O..  All providers should try to avoid the impulse to be rude, curt, or impertinent to anyone asking questions at the scene.
<P> 
</UL>
<HR>
<H3>DON'T's</H3>

<UL>
<LI>1. Don't use the expression; "No comment".  To do so, can be alikened to "waving a red flag in front of a bull".  The reporter needs information in order to fulfill his/her responsibility, just as you need to perform certain actions to manage and cause the ultimate success of the rescue.
<P>
The age-old, "No Comment", is likely to provoke a negative view of your operation, regardless of it's real quality.  Instead, refer the media-person to the P.I.O. or a supervisor.  Don't delay your rescue services to take time to talk to the press, but, also don't alienate them with short neagative replies.  A far better approach is; "We are currently gathering information about that...I'm sure that we will be releasing information about that as soon as possible".  Or say, "Please see the P.I.O. about that, I'm sure that he/she has more information than I do". 
<P>
<LI>2. Never lie!!  If you don't know the answer to a question, say so. It's better to look stupid than be proven untruthful  No one knows everything. A conscientious effort is all that can be expected.....even though a callous or unthinking media-person might suggest otherwise, or imply   malfeasance, ineptitude, or a "cover-up".  You can only address the facts as you know them.  Don't guess, promise to get a correct answer at the earliest opportunity and then do so. Continued antagonistic or untruthful responses to press inquiries will undoubtedly impact your service in a very negative way in the future.  
<P>
<LI>3. Don't avoid the press or forever sequester them in a "Press Area", that will prevent them from getting a real perspective of the "story". Conduct a "tour" of the incident scene, when it is safe to do so.  Point out pertinent locations and give details of what occured there. Remember, that if you (or rather your spokesperson) don't give them a "story", they may be encouraged to "make it up" or present it in a manner that may be inconsistent with the ultimate goals of your career or your organization. Practically all emergency services exist with the "consent, goodwill, and support of those who live in that jurisdiction".  Without this "goodwill", which is generated in part by the press, it is unlikely that necessary funding will be obtained or that the service will recieve the political support to effectively perform its essential services without interference.
<P>     
It is recommended that the P.I.O. or a senior level supervisor should give "stand-ups" interviews or photo opportunities on a frequent basis.  Someone should conduct a tour of the site, and give a briefing of what occured, and present your "side of the story" in a positive light. By providing the complete details from your organizational viewpoint, it is likely that you will benefit from the experience, rather than suffer from it. Media relations can be a very positive asset to your organization or a devastating public debacle.  As with any other emergency response problem, media affairs can be adequately managed and prove an asset to you and your organization.
<P>
</UL>
<HR>
One of the keys to effective participation with the press is to establish a friendly relationship prior to the event. Reporters are people, just like everyone else and should not immediately be viewed as an adversary.  By carrying out an on-going program of interaction and information sharing, emergency agencies can help to insure that they will at least "get a fair break" when the unconventional or controversial incident occurs.  Always try to provide the local media sources with continual stories and news releases that portray the service in a favorable light.
<P> 

For example, pictures of ambulance crews with "mom and a newly born baby" (promptly provided to the press) are far more positive and beneficial to the reputation of the service than the dramatic overturned car with its dead and dying.  The eventual outcome, however, of your overall media affairs program is dependant upon the training, preplanning, and conduct of all emergency personnel at the scene. Only by being educated and trained about the expectation of media involvement can the emergency responder or supervisor be prepared to manage the incident to the greatest benefit of the responder and the service that he/she serves. By being prepared for the eventuality of press coverage, an improved image and perception of your emergency services can be achieved.

<H2>Israeli/PLO Peace Process Called into Question Following Latest Bombing</H2>
By Clark Staten, ERRI Analyst
<P>

Chicago, IL, March 3, 1996 (ENN)--An already fragile Middle-East
peace agreement may be about to unravel in the wake of the third
bus bombing in Jerusalem in the last eight days. Nineteen (19)
people died Sunday morning at 06:27a.m.(Israeli time) as the #18
bus disintegrated into a mass of flames and flying metal. As
many as fifteen (15) others were wounded, several critically.
<P>

The blast occurred very near the Central Jerusalem bus station,
at almost the same time and place as a previous devastating
explosion that occurred the proceeding Sunday morning.  That
attack and another concurrent bombing at a favorite Israeli
Defense Forces (IDF) hitchhiking spot took the lives of 28
Israelis.  Experts say that today's bomb may have been even
larger than the two that were described by eyewitnesses as being
"massive".
<P>

Prime Minister Shimon Peres reportedly came to blast site
within a short time after the explosion, but left within a few
minutes. Bystanders report that upon his arrival he was greeted
by shouts and jeers of, "Peres get out", "Peres...Resign", and
"Death to Arabs". According to Jerusalem police sources, large
spontaneous demonstrations began at the blast site and several
other locations within Israel. The SNS Israeli News Service, an
ENN Affiliate, reports that the tension and anxiety on the
streets of Israel is "unprecedented"...even considering the
history of past attacks and bombings.
<P>

In the wake of this latest atrocity, Israeli President Ezer
Weizman has called for an immediate and total cessation of talks
with PLO Chairman Yasar Arafat. He also pleaded that the country
remain calm and not engage in counter-productive behavior, even
though he is aware of their anguish and concern about additional
security threats. Weizman was also quoted by the Israeli press
as saying, "We are at War with Hamas" and "must all exercise
restraint at this most sensitive time."
<P> 

According to ERRI analysts, both Prime Minister Peres and PLO
Chairman Arafat find themselves in a precarious position
following this latest bombing. Peres, who faces an election
shortly, is faced with the prospect of attempting to continue a
potentially unpopular peace process with the Palestinians, while
solving continuing interior security problems. Arafat is being
charged by the Israelis with disarming and arresting Islamic
extremists, who have constituted part of his power base on the
West Bank and Gaza, from which he ascended to his current
position of power. To make matter worse, both Israeli and
Palestinian splinter groups desire to end the peace process
entirely. 
<P>

In the past week, Hamas and its militant Izzadin El Kassim
Brigade had offered to participate in a cease-fire with Israeli
forces. Unfortunately, they attached conditions to this offer
that were deemed politically and ethically unacceptable to Prime
Minister Peres and his administration. Hamas offered to stop the
attacks if all Palestinian prisoners held by the Israelis were
released, and attempts to arrest currently sought Palestinians
were stopped. The Hamas proposals were immediately rejected by
the Israeli government for two reasons; their policy prohibits
direct negotiations with terrorists and they do not wish to
undermine whatever leadership role Arafat has been able to
assume among Palestinian residents of the Gaza and the West Bank.
<P>

All of the parties involved in this conflict know that unless a
mutually agreeable settlement is rapidly arranged that even
greater violence of one kind or another will inevitably result.
Without political resolution, Israel will have little choice but
to retaliate by covert means or in an open military response. 
The Oslo and Washington accords and subsequent agreements will
mean little, if extremists are allowed to reign and revenge
begets revenge.
<P>

Security measures throughout Israel have been vastly increased
within the past twelve (12) hours and an additional 800 special
commando-trained members of the IDF have been assigned to
monitor and secure bus stations and other public gathering
places. Intelligence gathering units of both the IDF and the
Palestinian Authority are reportedly concentrating on possible
assassination threats against Prime Minister Peres and Chairman
Arafat.
<P>

The beleaguered nation of Israel holds its collective breath as
palpable fear and anger spreads through the streets. A nation
under siege and assaulted by hostile forces since its very
inception, Israel finds itself at a crossroads in its hope for
peace. Israeli mothers say that they are afraid to let their
children go out and play or ride a bus to a relative's house. 
Bus stops, highways, schools, and synagogues are under constant
threat of possible terrorist attack. So many years of danger,
and seemingly so close to a lasting peace, large numbers of both
Muslims and Jews deeply hope and pray for an answer to what
appears today to be an almost insoluble problem.

<H2>MOVIE CREW RESCUES CHILD AT YONKERS FATAL FIRE</H2>
By Jim Fay  ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

A movie crew member, filming the upcoming film "The Preacher's
Wife," has been credited with saving the life of a child at
a fire in Yonkers, NY, that also caused the death of two other
young children.
<P>
At approximately 2230 hrs., EST, last night, the Yonkers Fire Department
responded to 5 Van Courtlandt Park Ave., in the Getty Square
section of Yonkers, on initial reports of a frame dwelling fire
with children trapped.  Soon after their arrival, a 2nd alarm was
transmitted, when firefighters saw a heavy fire condition in an
occupied building.
<P>

Just down the block from the fire, the film crew was set up.
Before the arrival of the FD, the crew became aware of the raging
fire, and several of the crew members ran to the scene. An
unidentified member of the crew entered the building and was able
to save one of the children in the fire. Two other children were
found by Yonkers firefighters, but sucumbed to the injuries and
smoke inhalation from the fire.
<P>

The fire soon went to a 3rd Alarm, and two tower ladder streams were
used to extinguish the fire in the three-story frame house, and to
protect the similar type exposures.
<P>

"The Preacher's Wife, staring Whitney Houston and Denzel Washington,
had been in the area most of the day, and had just begun wrapping up
their operation when the fire broke out.  In addition to the
childrens deaths, 14 Yonkers firefighters were also reported injured.

<TITLE>Increasing Violence; Guns in France</TITLE>

<H3>INCREASED USE OF FIREARMS IN FRANCE SEEN...</H3>
<P>
By Steve Macko
<P>
The fear that some French cities and suburbs are sinking into U.S.-style
urban violence has French authorities debating about whether or not they
should increase police firepower.  It is not unusual for some police
patrols in some high-rise suburbs of major French cities to come under
attack by a hail of stones from disgruntled youths.  More alarming is
the seen increased use of guns, which are strictly controlled in the
country.
<P>

The headlines from French newspapers scream out: Suburbs: State of
Emergency!  As well as: Suburbs: The Gun Law.  152 incidents involving
firearms have been reported in the first eight months of 1995, according
to the Interior Ministry's intelligence service.  Now, the number 152
may just seem like a slow day in the City of Chicago, but in France ...
that is unusually high.  The Interior Ministry's report said, "The use
of firearms has become considerably more common in districts long affected
by urban violence ... particularly in the Paris area."
<P>

In late October, a French policeman was shot in the face and critically
wounded by a gunman who used a large caliber gun in the western Paris
suburb of Mantes-la-Jolie.  A French police expert in suburban violence
said, "We cannot say there are more weapons around, but they are being
drawn more easily.  They are being used by youths who are increasingly
outside society and have nothing to lose."  That description sounds
remarkably like what is happening today in American cities.
<P>

The French government has responded in a few different ways.  Police
in six areas throughout the city of Paris will be issued flak jackets to
wear.  Police will also be given special guns that shoot rubber bullets
and will also be given faster cars.
<P>

During the recent nationwide search to find the people responsible for
a wave of terrorist bombings in France, the security crackdown has cut the
crime in the Paris region by ten percent.  But the crackdown has also generated many complaints from youths of North African descent.  They said that they are being singled out by police.  Again, this sounds remarkably
like the kind of complaints that blacks make in the United States.
<P>

Another similarity betweeen France and the United States is that there is a high-crime rate in grim high-rise districts of Paris, what are called "project buildings" in the U.S..  These buildings, just like their American counterparts, were hastily built in the 1950's and 1960's.  These buildings are mostly occupied by immigrants who have recently come to France.
<P>

In the United States, particularly in Chicago, high-rise project buildings
are starting to be dismantled and torn down in favor of low-rise buildings.
Comparisons are also being drawn to burned out sections of New York City.
A recent French newspaper article said, "We are being told that French
suburbs are not the Bronx.  This is true, but it is also true that the
Bronx is less worse off now than ten years ago, unlike French suburbs, which are becoming worse by the day

<H3>RAPIDLY EXPANDING DISEASES - APRIL 1992</H3>
By: Clark Staten, EMT-P
<P>

Chicago, IL - A survey of reported outbreaks of diseases in
the United States indicates a resurgence of several diseases
that many health experts had predicted would have been
completely iradicated by the 1990's.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>MEASLES</H4>
The Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has reported a
series of recent out breaks of measles, particularly among
pre-school hispanics that have not been vaccinated for the
previously common disease.  Caused by a virus, measles are
characterized by a skin rash, fever, body aches, and malaise.
Although not normally serious, some victims progress into
pneumonia or other life-threatening disease processes.
<P>

CDC says that the incidence of outbreaks is most likely in
poor "inner city" areas and in those where there is a
language barrier that prevents knowledge of vaccination
techniques.  Hispanics, Asians, and other groups who have
recently migrated to the United States seem involved in the
initial infections of larger spread outbreaks of the disease.
<P>

Areas with the greatest numbers of reported cases of measles
are San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange, Santa Cruz, San Mateo and
Alameda counties in California. The next greatest numbers
were found in Dade County Florida, Honolulu, Hawaii, Cook and
Dupage Counties in Illinois, and Bronx, Kings, Queens, New
York and Manchester Counties in New York state.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>CHOLERA</H4>
Another disease that many have thought was previously
irradicated is Cholera, even though evidence would suggest
that this entirely untrue.  A major outbreak of Cholera has
taken place in the country of Peru during the past year,
causing infections in more than 300,000 people.
According to the Ministry of Health there, as many as 3,000
of those infected have died. Most of the fatal infections
involved young children from poor families.
<P>

Health Minister Ernesto Salmeron of Nicaragua has issued a
"state of alert" in his country, due to several confirmed
cases of the disease and a projected "major outbreak" to
occur during the Easter holidays.  Health officials in
Northern Mexico have confirmed several cases in villages near
the border with the United States.  A recent report in USA
Today indicated that public health workers in Brownsville,
Texas had confirmed at least one case to be found there.
<P>

Cholera is spread by the ingestion of liquids or foods that
have been previously contaminated by the excrement of someone
that is already infected by the disease. It spreads most
rapidly in areas where water supplies become contaminated, or
where there may be cross-contamination between sewage and
ground water.  Additionally, several cases of the disease
have been transmitted by infected food preparation workers,
who may or may not be aware of proper sanitation methods.
Food on an airplane flight from Lima, Peru to Los Angeles was
recently found contaminated by L.A. County Health officials.
<P>

Experts predict a continued expansion of the numbers of
cases, unless appropriate precautions are taken.  They
indicate that efficient personal hygiene, sanitary water
supplies, and sewage systems in the United States and other
developed nations may slow the spread. It is important,
however, that physicians and prehospital care workers be
aware of the dangers of the disease and the possibility of
further contamination.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>MENINGITIS</H4>
Symptoms of meningitis mimic those of the "flu"...mild fever,
sore throat, headache, skin rashes, cough, and joint aches.
Eventually, the symptoms progress to nausea and vomiting,
high fever, photophobia (sensitivity to light), "stiff neck",
and severe headache.  Deteriorating levels of consciousness,
leading to coma, are common if the patient remains untreated.
<P>

Meningitis may be bacterial, fungal, viral, or neoplastic in
origin. The difference between the various forms is
important because bacterial meningitis can be a true
neurological emergency, with patients succumbing to it within
hours of symptoms.  In several of the recent cases, the
deceased patients did not present with symptoms other that
thjose that might be consistent with the "flu".
<P>

Public health officials in several states have been tracking
the various strains of meningitis, in an attempt to draw
links in the repetitive cycle of infection and disease. The
infection is commonly spread by nasal and throat secretions
that are shared by sneezing, couching, kissing, or other
intimate contact.  People who may have come into contact with
meningitis are frequently given the antibiotic Rifampin, in
an effort to stave off the onset of the potentially dangerous
disease.
<P>

According to officials at the University of Illinois in
Champaign, IL,  more than 18,000 students there have been
given free vaccinations for meningitis. This program was
begun after an outbreak of the disease that sent seven (7)
U of I students to the hospital and resulted in two deaths.
Another outbreak reportedly occured at Eastern Illinois
University, and it took the life of a nineteen year old
student from Batavia, IL.
<P>

Health officials in Birmingham, Alabama are also said to be
investigating the deaths of two youths at Hueytown High
School, where a seventeen year old boy died two weeks ago.
A fatal outbreak was also reported at the Delta-Delta-Delta
Sorority at a major Eastern university. The USA Today
newspaper has reported outbreaks of the disease in New York,
New Jersey, Indiana, and California.

<title>Action Plan for Drug-Resistant <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I>
</title>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<hr>
<pre><b>EID  Volume 1 * Number 2                                              April-June 1995</b></pre>
<hr>
<i><h5>Commentary</h5></i><p>
<h1><b>Action Plan for Drug-Resistant <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I>
</b></h1>
<hr>
<I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I> is a leading cause of illness
and death in the United States. It accounts for an
estimated 3,000 cases of meningitis, 50,000 cases of
bacteremia, 500,000 cases of pneumonia, and more than
seven million cases of otitis media annually (1, 2). <I>S.
pneumoniae</I> had been almost uniformly susceptible to
penicillin; however, with the development and worldwide
spread of drug-resistant <I>S. pneumonia</I>e (DRSP), a public
health challenge has emerged. Studies from Australia,
Southeast Asia, Africa, and Europe have reported
pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin and other
drugs (3). Surveillance data collected at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have shown that
high-level resistance to penicillin increased more than
60-fold--from 0.02% for 1979-1987 to 1.3% in 1992--for
pneumococcal isolates from invasive infections (4). In
some communities, at least 30% of isolates are
nonsusceptible to penicillin (5; CDC, unpublished data).
<p>
Pneumococcal resistance has been reported for
beta-lactams, macrolides, chloramphenicol, and
sulfonamides. As multidrug-resistant strains become
increasingly prevalent, treatment options will become
limited. The clinical impact of antimicrobial resistance
on the outcome of invasive and noninvasive DRSP
infections remains largely unknown. Vancomycin has been
required to treat patients with pneumococcal meningitis
caused by strains resistant to extended-spectrum
cephalosporins (e.g., cefotaxime and ceftriaxone) (6).
Optimal treatment regimens for DRSP infections remain to
be defined; CDC is organizing a working group to develop
consensus guidelines for the management of pneumococcal
infections.
<p>
The prevalence of pneumococcal resistance to
antimicrobial drugs is not known for most areas of the
United States since DRSP infection has not been a
reportable condition. Some studies have suggested great
geographic and temporal variation in levels of
resistance; prevalence rates are 2% to 30% (5,7). In
addition, DRSP can spread rapidly through a population,
and the prevalence of resistant isolates can differ in
adults and children. To make appropriate empiric
antimicrobial choices, clinicians need a reliable and
current assessment of the level of antimicrobial
resistance in the community.
<p>
To address the growing problem of DRSP, a working group
of public health practitioners, health care providers,
clinical laboratorians, and representatives of key
professional societies was formed in June 1994. The group
identified the development of an electronic,
laboratory-based surveillance system for DRSP as the
essential first step to address this concern. The group
has issued a comprehensive plan, "A National Strategy for
the Surveillance, Applied Research, Control, and
Prevention of DRSP," to be published in June 1995. This
plan focuses on three public health priorities: 1) to
define and monitor the prevalence and geographic
distribution of DRSP and recognize the emergence of
patterns of resistance, 2) to study further the
epidemiology of DRSP, and 3) to minimize the
complications of DRSP infections through control and
prevention.
<p>
The working group has begun piloting an electronic,
laboratory-based surveillance network to detect serious
illness due to DRSP. For isolates nonsusceptible to
oxacillin (zone size <20 mm), minimal inhibitory
concentrations should routinely be determined for
penicillin, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin,
chloramphenicol, vancomycin, and other clinically
relevant drugs. These data will be analyzed to determine
community-specific levels of resistance and will be made
available to clinicians to improve antimicrobial use.
Additionally, aggregate data will be sent to CDC so that
national trends in pneumococcal resistance can be
identified and reported.
<p>
Clinical laboratory directors, large commercial
laboratory operators, and laboratory software
manufacturers indicate that many laboratory software
systems can accommodate a paperless, automated mechanism
for reporting communicable disease information directly
to public health authorities. DRSP surveillance may thus
serve as a model for electronic, laboratory-based
reporting for other laboratory-reportable conditions.
Although improved data flow should increase the number
and timeliness of reported cases, a strategy for ensuring
quality control of data will be required. 
<p>
In the era of emerging antimicrobial resistance,
prevention of pneumococcal infections is paramount;
vaccination strategies offer an important approach to
controlling DRSP. An existing pneumococcal polysaccharide
vaccine that can prevent a substantial number of
pneumococcal infections, including those caused by DRSP,
is underutilized. The vaccine is recommended by the
Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) for
use in persons older than 2 years of age who have certain
underlying medical conditions and for all persons older
than 65 years of age (8). It is not recommended for
routine use among children under 2 years of age because
it does not provide immunity consistently in this age
group. An effective vaccine is needed to prevent
pneumococcal infections in this population, which has the
highest risk for otitis media and meningitis caused by
DRSP. If the prevalence of pneumococcal infection (and
therefore antimicrobial use) can be substantially reduced
by vaccination, the impact of DRSP may diminish. Novel
vaccine demonstration projects supported by federal and
state health agencies are under way to explore means of
increasing coverage with the effective 23-valent
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.
<p>
Applied research is also needed to address the problem of
DRSP. CDC has recently funded population-based
investigations to define risk factors, patterns of
transmission, costs, and health outcomes associated with
DRSP. Public health programs for control and prevention
of DRSP are being designed for use at local, state, and
federal levels. Because unnecessary use of antimicrobial
agents has contributed to the emergence of resistant
bacteria (1, 3, 5), educational materials and campaigns
are being developed for both health care providers and
consumers to raise awareness of the link between
excessive antimicrobial use and the emergence of
drug-resistant organisms. Through a multifaceted
approach, the growing problem of DRSP can be addressed to
minimize the complications and costs of resistant
pneumococcal infections. Surveillance for DRSP is an
important starting point from which control and
prevention solutions can proceed.
<p>

<font size=5><strong>DRUG TRAFFICKING HOTSPOT: EAGLE PASS, TEXAS</strong></font> <br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
Walk along a portion of the Rio Grande River, that separates Mexico from the Texas border, and you'll find 
discarded clothes, plastic garbage bags strewn around, and deflated inner tubes. Just garbage left by litterbugs? 
Think again -- what it really signifies is debris left behind by drug smugglers who cross the border from Mexico.<br>
<br>
U.S. federal agents say the smugglers are increasingly crossing the border and are becoming more brazen and 
more violent. U.S. residents in the area of Eagle Pass, Texas, are becoming more frightened by the situation and 
are now getting the attention of top anti-drug officers.<br>
<br>
Retired U.S. Army General Barry McCaffrey is the head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. In 
describing the situation at Eagle Pass, the General said, &quot;It has gotten immeasurably worse in the last year and 
we are determined to play hardball with international drug criminals.&quot;<br>
<br>
In early July, McCaffrey, along with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, 
attended a national anti-drug summit with hundreds of other law enforcement officials. McCaffrey told the 
meeting that they should prepare for a long-term fight with the drug traffickers. He said that to ensure success, 
the U.S. must put together a long-term budget rather then shaping a new budget for the battle every year.<br>
<br>
Before attending the Southwest Border Counterdrug Conference in El Paso last month, General McCaffrey and 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Director Thomas Constantine visited Eagle Pass, now called a drug 
trafficking hotspot. The two men met privately with area ranchers who said that the smuggling on their property<br>
has increased in the last five years.<br>
<br>
McCaffrey said, &quot;It's an intimidating environment with gangs of twenty to forty people crossing the river ... at 
night, carrying automatic weapons with massive drug smuggling -- heroin, cocaine, marijuana.&quot; The General said 
that many of the ranchers are considering selling their property. And there's no trouble finding buyers -- that's 
because the drug smugglers are interested in purchasing.<br>
<br>
Jim Collier, the Special-Agent-In-Charge of the DEA's field office in San Antonio, which covers Eagle Pass, 
said that ever since the successful U.S. crackdowns in Florida and in the Caribbean, seventy percent of all 
illegal drugs now come through Mexico. Drug seizures in the Eagle Pass area have increased by about 33 
percent in 1996. Most of the seizures involve marijuana.<br>
<br>
General McCaffrey says that one way to crack down on the smugglers is to work closely with Mexicans 
officials while increasing technology and manpower along the border. The U.S. hopes to deploy an additional 
1,500 additional agents along the Southwest border in 1997.<br>
<br>
As for working with Mexico to solve the problem, the U.S. StateDepartment is asked about Mexican 
cooperation in anti-drug operations are a regular basis. The State Department has been saying that they very 
pleased with the level of cooperation from Mexican authorities, but do acknowledge that there is still some 
corruption among some Mexican officials. Both the United States and Mexico are said to be trying very hard to 
rectify this problem.</p>

<H3>COLD Weather injuries</H3>
<BR>

By Paul Anderson, Metro Correspondent<BR>
Chicago, IL, Nov. 27, 1994 -- With weather forecasters predicting a temperature pattern that will produce below zero readings in much of the central part of the country for the foreseeable future, medical and rescue experts say that the likelihood of hypothermia and other cold related injuries is greatly increased.
<P>
According to Clark Staten, director of the Chicago-based Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute, the next few days may be particularly dangerous for the homeless and those that are required to be outdoors for any extended period of time.  Staten, who is the author of several articles concerning cold water drowning, hypothermia, and other cold injuries, said that there are several precautions that people can take in an effort to avoid cold weather injuries.  These recommendations include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1.  Wear several layers of clothing, rather than one or two &quot;bulky&quot; layers.  Air is trapped between these layers and acts as insulation against the cold.  Clothing filled with wool, down, and synthetic foams may be of assistance in retaining body heat.
<P>
2. Always wear a hat and/or scarf.  As much as 70% or more of the body's heat can be lost through radiation and convection from an uncovered head.
<P>
3. Avoid consumption of alcoholic beverages.  While often touted by the uneducated as being beneficial for the treatment of cold- weather injuries, alcohol actually can be detrimental to someone exposed to the cold.  The person who consumes the alcohol may perceive that he or she is warmer, while in reality they may be contributing to their own cold injury.
<P>
4. Avoid wet clothing, shoes, or socks, as they may further contribute to a loss of  body heat.  Faster cooling results because of evaporation.  Try to change wet footgear and clothing as soon as practically possible.
<P>
5. Insulated gloves and socks may help to prevent frostbite injuries to fingers and toes.  Try to avoid direct skin contact with metal objects that have been exposed to the cold for extended periods.
<P>
6. A scarf or face mask may help to prevent frostbite injuries to the nose and ears.  In combination with a warm hat, the wearing of these additional head and face coverings should serve to protect and retain heat.
<P>
7. Drink warm liquids like tea and hot chocolate.  Sugar contained in these beverages helps the body to generate additional heat.  Caffenated beverages may seem beneficial, but should be generally avoided, as they may contribute to heat loss.  
<P>

<H4>HYPOTHERMIA</H4>
<BR>
 Hypothermia is a potentially life-threatening condition that is characterized by a general lowering of a person's core temperature.  Mild hypothermia occurs when the body's temperature drops below 95 0  degrees Fahrenheit.  Symptoms of mild hypothermia include shivering , foot stomping, emotional withdrawal, and  a general feeling of &quot;being cold&quot;.<BR>
Moderate hypothermia occurs when the person's body temperature drops below 90 F. Shivering stops and the muscular activity decreases.  Particularly, fine muscle coordination becomes more difficult.  For instance, actions involving deliberate movement of the fingers may become impossible.<P>
As the body continues to cool, and the core temperature reaches below 85 F, the affected person will become lethargic and may not be able to assist him/herself . This is described as severe hypothermia and may, if  left untreated, result in coma and the eventual  death of the victim. As the person's temperature reaches 800  F, his/her vital signs begin to decrease.  The pulse becomes slower and weaker.  Respirations slow and cardiac irregularities may occur.  Below 80 F, the body goes into what appears to be &quot;complete shutdown&quot;. The affected person appears dead, even though they may still be successfully resuscitated if rewarmed and treated in a proper manner. 
<P>
<H4>TREATMENT OF HYPOTHERMIA PATIENTS</H4>
<BR>
Primary considerations in treating the hypothermic person must include:<P>
1.  Move the person to a warm environment. Generally speaking, persons with cold weather injuries can't be treated outdoors.  Do not try to rewarm a person &quot;in the field&quot; unless there is no other viable alternative.  Be gentle with the movement of ANY hypothermic person.  Rough handling can result in irreversible or fatal cardiac irregularities.  Definitive rewarming must be accomplished from the &quot;inside-out&quot; and probably can only be done in a hospital emergency facility. 
<P>
2.  If the person is alert and shivering, they probably are only suffering from mild hypothermia.  Move indoors, remove all wet clothing, and cover the person with a warm blanket.  Warm fluids like soup, tea, and hot chocolate can be given by mouth, if the person can hold the cup/bowl by themselves. 
<P>
3. If shivering has stopped, or the person is unconscious, severe hypothermia is probably present.  A standard oral thermometer will not register when the person is severely hypothermic;  a special rectal thermometer must be used to measure the patient's &quot;core temperature&quot;.  As previously mentioned, great care must be used in the movement of a person who is suffering from severe hypothermia.  Emergency medical intervention is necessary when the person has suffered a severe cold weather insult.
<P>
4. It may be difficult or impossible to detect a pulse in the severely hypothermic person.  It is possible that a carotid pulse of one (1) or two (2) beats per minute can be obtained by closely monitoring the vitals signs.  To the lay person, the severely hypothermic patient will appear to be deceased.  But...that doesn't mean that they ARE dead, just that they appear that way.  People have been successfully resuscitated after several hours in a cold environment.
<P>
If there is ANY doubt about severity of  a cold weather injury...immediately activate the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system.  In many localities , the telephone number 911 may used request the EMT's or Paramedics that will care for a severely hypothermic patient.  Only by a better understanding of prevention and treatment methods, can the public be prepared to effectively deal with cold weather emergencies.

<H2>Explosion Strikes E. London; IRA Calls Off Cease-Fire</H2>
By: Clark Staten, ENN CT Analyst
<P>
Within minutes of an announcement by the IRA that they had called off their cease-fire with the government of the UK, a blast shook an area near South Quay station in East London. The explosion, being called a "device" by Special Branch officials, reportedly injuring as many as 50 people and there are reports of others being trapped.
<P>
The explosion came shortly after 19:00 (7:00p.m) London time.  An eyewitness called the scene chaotic and said that many people were wounded. London fire and ambulance brigade personnel were said to be working feveriously to rescue entrapped people and take the injured to area hospitals. Numerous people were said to be cut by flying glass and debris. According to news reports, the windows of nearby buildings had been blown out and part of one building may have collapsed.
<P>
Several sources reportedly received bomb threats prior to the blast.  The state-backed RTE radio and television network is said to have received a call claiming to end the cease fire. BBS Radio in London also reportedly received a call of a bomb threat, prompting police to begin evacuation of a train station at or near the site of the explosion.
<P>
Speculation has begun that the blast was the responsibility of a "militant splinter group" of the IRA and that the Gerry Adams and the main political leadership have not ended the cease-fire. Confirmation as to those claiming responsibility has not been received, and counter-terrorist operatives and analysts from Scotland Yard are said to be beginning an investigation. 
<P>
ENN is following further details and will provide additional reports as the information becomes available.
<P>
(Ed. Note: 02/11/96- UPDATE: Two bodies were discovered on 02/10/96 in the rubble of a bombed out office building.  Mr. Gerry Adams later refused to deny the IRA involvement in the incident and blamed any loss of human life on the "slowness and lack of understanding on the part of British Government" in its negotiation process.  An estimated 85 million pounds in damage was done to structures and vehicles surrounding the blast site.)

<H2>NYC SUBWAY SYSTEM EXPLOSION CAUSES CHAOS</H2>
By JIM FAY  ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

NEW YORK CITY (ENN) - In the second time in less than a week, NYC emergency personnel were again mobilized for an explosion and fire in the NYC Transit System that initially was believed to be an actual bomb, but was later determined to, again, be electrical in nature.
<P>

May 1st, at around 1845 hrs., EDT, FDNY, NYPD, and EMS, responded to the midtown Manhattan location of East 51 Street and Lexington Ave., for a report of multiple explosions with a fire in the subway tunnel of the very heavily traveled Lexington Ave. Subway line.  NYPD Police Officer Russell Dietz was one of the first officers on the scene and stated that he heard two explosions from the subway grating on the sidewalk on Lexington Ave.
<P> 

He immediately went into the subway system and found a heavy smoke condition and many passengers attempting to exit the subway. Dietz reported that a third explosion occurred while he was in the station. These reports and the potential life hazard caused the Fire Department to transmit a second alarm almost immediately.
<P>

The Lexington Ave. subway line is the most heavily traveled line in the NYC system, going north and south on Manhattan's East Side.  As a result of the emergency, all train traffic was halted and power was ordered shut off on the third rail. Numerous trains were stranded in the tunnels between stations throughout the length of the line in Manhattan.  Fire units attacked the fire that was visible from under one of the trains and it was soon determined by Transit officials that the preliminary cause of the explosion was the power transformers underneath the subway cars, and not a terrorist act.
<P>

However, the evacuation of passengers from the numerous stranded trains had to still be addressed.  In addition to the Second Alarm response of the FDNY to E. 51 St., an independent response of an "all hands" was used at Park Ave. South and E. 28th St., on the same line. At this point, eventually numerous passengers were removed over a two hour period, in addition to hundreds at the 51 St. site.  Another command post was set up at Grand Central Terminal at E. 42 St. and Lexington Ave. for evacuation there and several other locations where street emergency exists were opened to assist the passengers along the line.  A total of approximately 3,000 passengers were assisted off the five stranded trains in the tunnels.
EMS reported a tentative final patient count of 30 injuries, none of which initially appeared life threatening.
<P>

The type of explosion that occurred yesterday on the Lexington Ave. train used to occur somewhat regularly on the older NYC subway cars and emergency personnel were aware of this history.  However, the heightened awareness of the potential of terrorism in the public transit system, especially as a result of the World Trade Center bombing and the plans of the other individuals to attempt a similar act in the tunnels, has caused NYC to act accordingly upon receipt of such an alarm.  Official concerns also continue about situations such as those that occurred in Japan and Paris systems.
<P> 

Just last Tuesday, April 23rd, the same type of response investigated a similar situation in Brooklyn when several electrical manholes exploded in the street, causing the loss of some of the electrical power in the subway. This was complicated further by a bogus report that the explosion was caused by a bomb and that there were several more bombs in the manholes.
<P>
One fire official told ENN that they will treat "any reported explosion" in the subway as a criminal act until proven otherwise and will respond with the  "maximum response" needed to manage such a disaster, should it occur.

<H2>Another Jerusalem Bus Bomb; 20 Dead, 14 Wounded</H2>
By Clark Staten, ENN CT Analyst
<P>

(ENN) According to Isreali Security Services, another devastating bus bomb has exploded this morning in Jerusalem. The attack took place at Jaffa Street, near the city's Central bus station.  Again, the #18 bus (same number as last weeks attack) was totally destroyed. 
<P>

The Magan David Adom (Isreali EMS) reports the deaths of twenty (20) people and confirmed injuries involving at least fourteen (14) others, four reported in critical condition. Additional Fire, EMS, military and explosives ordinance disposal officers are either enroute or already on the scene. Concerns have been raised of a secondary device that could still explode.
<P>

The original blast is believed to have gone off at approximately 06:27 Israeli time, and is being described as being a large detonation. No claim of responsibility has been made and the stituation is still on-going. Additional reports will be issued by ENN as conditions warrant.
<P>
ERRI analysts say that they fear that this deadly attack was also carried out by  Islamic Extremists. An  report says that the militant group Hamas has claimed responsibility for this latest atrocity, but that has not 
been officially confirmed. 
<P>

reported a 1979 Oldsmobile had broadsided a  Armored Transport of 
California armored car. One of the two people from the armored car had 
been ejected, and the people in the Oldsmobile were trapped. A second 
truck, two more medics, and LifeFlight helicopter was activated with a 
landing zone of El Camino & Rengstorff, a VERY busy intersection.  There 
were four people in the Oldsmobile, and the top had to be cut off.
<P>

Four victims were transported via ambulance to Stanford / Valley Med,
and two victims were transported via LifeFlight to San Jose Hospital, 
with one person in critical condition. The Mountain View Police guarded 
the van until a transport unit arrived, since the ATC vehicle was fully 
loaded, and ensured that a transport was made. No money  was lost. A 
second JOL was brought in from Los Altos.

<H2> ROUND ONE TO CENTRAL PIERCE</H2>
<P>
 By Gary G. Ludwig, MS, EMT-P</center>
<P>

The last column reported that Medtrans had filed a lawsuit
against Central Pierce Fire & Rescue (WA) on their effort
to increase service levels to their citizens.
<P>

Assistant Chief and EMS Section Secretary John Sinclair
informs us United States District Judge Franklin D. Burgess
has denied the motion for a preliminary injunction.  In an
order handed down February 23, 1996, the judge wrote,
"The Plaintiff (Medtrans) has not adequately demonstrated
that the Defendant (CPF&R) is not entitled to Parker
immunity.  Parker immunity, based upon principles of
federalism and state sovereignty, may apply to local
governmental bodies as well as to states."  Earlier the
judge denied a temporary restraining order.  <I><B>Chief Sinclair
can be reached at 206-848-4587</B></I>.

March 9th was the date that the Plantation (FL) Fire
Department dedicated their new EMS program.  Robert
Pudney, Chief of the PFD says, "This dedication will begin
a new page in the history of our Fire Department.  The
incorporation of EMS into our organization enables us to
provide full fire and life safety services to citizens we serve."
In a joining of the "old" and "new", state of the art new PFD
rescue vehicles with computer work stations inside the back
of the unit were involved in a "housing ceremony."   Division
Chief Frank Jacobson explains that in the old days, when
returning from a fire call, the horses were unable to push the
steam fire engine back into it's quarters.  The firefighters
would then call upon available neighbors to assist with
pushing, or "housing" the vehicle back into quarters.  In the
dedication ceremony, the new rescue vehicles were "housed"
into the station. <I><B> For more information contact Chief Jacobson
at 954-797-2150</B></I>.

For those EMS Section members (or if your not an EMS
Section member) attending EMS Expo in Atlanta
(April 18-20,1996), plan on attending the bi-annual EMS
Section meeting.  This year's Section meeting will be held
on Friday evening, April 19th in the convention center, itself.
Watch for announcements at the conference for time and
room number.   The EMS Expo is only a few weeks away
and it is not too late to register.  The fire track which is
sponsored by the EMS Section will include lectures by
Don Lee on "Stay Alive: EMS Scene Safety"; John Sinclair
on "Hero, Helper, Healer: The Evolution of an EMS Provider";
Fred Thorp on "Things that Go Bump: Critical Issues in EMS";

AMR has announced their gross sales for 1995 - $483.8 million.
In a released statement, their CEO and President Paul Shirley
said, "We continued our aggressive acquisition strategy during
the year, completing 22 acquisitions of providers with operations
in 16 states."   Looks like an acquisition a little over one every
two weeks! 
<P>
<HR> 

Half-century and still going strong!  Assistant Chief
Jack Scheben of the Erlanger (KY) Fire Department has spent
50 of his 66 years on the department.  Chief of the Department
Bill Martin tells me that Chief Scheben is a certified EMT-first
responder and is not beyond responding to medical calls.  At a
recent Erlanger Fire Department Awards Dinner, family and
friends honored him with a $500 gift certificate for an Amtrak
train ride.  Additionally, a section of Alice Street leading to
Firehouse No. 2 will henceforth be known as Jack Scheben Drive.

EMS providers who have died in the line of duty will be honored
at the 1996 National EMS Memorial Service, which will be held
on May 25, 1996 at the Greene Memorial United Methodist Church
in Roanoke, VA.   Individuals were selected by the National EMS
Memorial Service Committee to receive awards at the fourth annual
ceremony after receiving nominations from EMS agencies and
family members . <I> <B>For more information on attending the service

<font size=5><strong>Admiral Says Iran is Importing Chinese Anti-Ship Missiles</strong></font><br>
By: Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
BAHRAIN (ENN) - The outgoing U.S. Navy Commander of the U.S. Firth Fleet and of U.S. Naval Forces, 
Central Command said on Monday that in the past two years the rogue state of Iran has tripled the numbers of 
missiles deployed on its Gulf coast and is placing Chinese-built cruise missiles on up to twenty of its naval boats. Vice 
Admiral John Scott Redd said that Iran's acquistion of Chinese radar guided C-802 anti-ship missiles was a &quot;new 
dimension&quot; as a regional naval threat.<br>
<br>
The admiral, who is ending his present assingment on Wednesday and is returning to Washington, said that Iran and 
Iraq continue to be the greatest security threat in the oil-rich Gulf region. He said that there were no threat indications 
against U.S naval forces after the 25 June 1996 terrorist bombing near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Though the admiral 
did say that the Navy had taken &quot;prudent security measures.&quot;<br>
<br>
Redd explained, &quot;Iraq is the major land threat in the region ... because it still has the most capable and largest ground 
force in the region, while Iran is more of a naval threat.&quot; He said that the outlaw nation of Iran is expected to soon 
have up to twenty patrol boats armed with the Chinese anti-ship cruise missiles.<br>
<br>
Currently, Iran also has two Russian-built Kilo submarines. Redd said that another submarine is expected to be 
delivered to the Iranians sometime this year.<br>
<br>
The admiral warned, &quot;There has been a tripling of shore-based missiles both that shoot at ships and those that are 
surface-to-air missiles. The number they have deployed on the Gulf coast and in the Strait of Hormuz roughly tripled. 
The newest dimension is that they have Chinese-built C-802 missiles against ships ... the Houdong patrol craft they 
got from China came fitted to fire the C-802s and they have now received ten of them. Some arrived in the last 
couple of months. They are also taking some of the other patrol craft and modifying them to carry the missiles and 
that work is in progress. We could be looking at twenty or more patrol ships at sea capable of carrying those 
surface-to-surface missiles.&quot;<br>
<br>
There has been growing concern at the Pentagon about Iran's growing military capability and its aims in the Gulf 
region. Admiral Redd said that U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region were more than capable of dealing with any 
Iranian military threat.<br>
<br>
Currently, the Fifth Fleet has about 34 U.S. Navy vessels in the Gulf region. This includes an aircraft carrier group, 
crusiers, destroyers, frigates and submarines. Most of the ships are deployed in the Persian Gulf itself.<br>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 23:15CST-02/24/96
<P>
<center><H2>Explosion in Central Jerusalem Bus Station; Multiple casualties Reported</H2>


               <B>By Clark Staten, CT analyst</B></center>
<P>

Chicago, IL, February 25, 1996 --A large explosion has rocked
the central bus station in Jerusalem, Israel this morning
(approx. 07:00a.m. Israeli time)and multiple casualties are
being reported, according to a local Emergency Medical Service
(EMS) official.  A "device" is believed to have totally
destroyed the #18 bus, filled with soldiers of the Israeli
Defense Forces, and damaged several other vehicles.
<P>

Numerous ambulances and police officials are reportedly enroute
or on the scene of this latest disaster involving the bombing of
a bus in a central business district. Rescuers are combing
through a smoking ruins of what was a bustling bus station.
Although unconfirmed by official Israeli sources, at least
fifteen (15) people were believed dead and at least thirty (30)
others wounded by what is being called a "massive detonation." 
The wounded have been taken Hadassah Mount Scopus Hospital,
Haddassah Ein Karem Hospital and the Shaare Medical Center. The
number of injured and dead is expected to rise.
<P>

Speculation as to the perpetrators of the blast is centering on
Islamic extremists, who have been threatening to attack "the
heart of Israel" for several weeks. No one has claimed
responsibility at the time of this report, but counter-terrorist
experts say that they fear that it may be in retaliation for the
recent death of a Palestinian bombmaker called "The Engineer",
who was allegedly killed by forces close to the Israeli
intelligence community. ENN and other sources had previously
reported fundamentalist threats and concerns of revenge to
follow the end of Ramadan. It would appear that these dire
predictions came true this morning, in the worst possible way,
in a crowded bus station in Jerusalem.
<P>
<HR>

<H3>Second Explosion Reported</H3>
07:48 Israeli Time-02/25/96
<P>

A second device is reported to have exploded at another bus depot, 
near Ashkelon Junction, a known hitchhiking spot for IDF soldiers. This second
devastating blast is described by authorities as "the entire bus stop erupted into a ball of flames".
At least two additonal deaths are reported there and as many as ten others injuried
Additional details regarding the second blast are extremely sketchy at the time
of this report, but it appears to be an extremely serious incident
as well.
<P>

Details are still coming in about these breaking stories and ENN
is receiving periodic updates from our affiliate, the SNS News Service,
in Jerusalem. More as it becomes available.

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 06/17/96-00:00CDT</p>
<p><font size=6>Bulls Win!! Initial Reports of Trouble </font><br>
By ENN News Team
<P>
<p>Chicago, IL, June 16, 1996 (ENN)--The first reports of &quot;looting&quot;
came from the CFD 4th Battalion Chief at 21:30CDT at Roosevelt
and Loomis on Chicago's near Southside. The fire companies were
immediately pulled from the scene amidst reports of, &quot;they're
throwing rocks and bottles at us.&quot; </p>
<p>At 21:45CDT the 7th Battalion reported a &quot;working fire&quot; at 4409
W. Maypole and &quot;shots fired&quot; as soon as the first companies
arrived at the scene. </p>
<p>At 21:55 and 23:00, sporadic reports of people blocking traffic
were reported at several locations on Chicago Avenue. Burglar
alarms were set off in numerous locations on the near Westside,
often by windows being broken. </p>
<p>At 22:20, a CFD ambulance was sent to 409 N. Central for the
person shot on the street. Concurrently, at Division and
Dearborne, the 18th District Police commander was requesting
additional assistance for crowd control. </p>
<p>22:25; at Divison and Cicero, reports by an unidentified
ambulance of rocks and bottle thrown at them. Continued reports
of &quot;shots fired&quot; and &quot;loud reports&quot; continued to be received
from numerous South and Westside locations. </p>
<p>At 22:30, Fire/Police/EMS units were extremely busy, but it
began to sound as though they were &quot;holding their own&quot;, against
lawlessness that might be occurring. </p>
<p>22:35; At Central Park and Roosevelt, a working fire was
reported by Engine 77. And, at the same time, at 79th and
Sangamon several simultaneous garage arsons were reported. </p>
<p>22:45; 4th Battalion enroute to still alarm at 1410 W. 14th
Street, in a CHA High-rise. Continued reports of arson to
vehicles and buildings are coming in from 1300 block of
Roosevelt Road, 2200 block of Roosevelt, Roosevelt and Cicero,
and at other locations. </p>
<p>22:55; CFD Engine #32 reported that it was returning to quarters
with its windshield and one side window broken by &quot;thrown
objects.&quot; </p>
<p>23:05; CPD was reporting a couch set on fire, in the middle of
the street at Central Park and Dickens. At Bloomingdale and
Kedzie, CPD was concurrently reporting a &quot;man down...shot.&quot; 
Numerous &quot;trash&quot;, &quot;dumpster&quot;, and &quot;abandoned auto&quot; fires were
being reported across the South and Westside. </p>
<p>23:05; At Cicero and Washington, a CFD ambulance was sent for a
&quot;man shot.&quot; Cause of the shooting unclear at the time of this
report. Concurrently, reports were received of a large, unruly
crowd gathering in the vicinity of Clark &amp; Elm. Police were
attempting to disperse them. </p>
<p><B>Summary at 00:00CDT</B><br>
 Continued reports of sporadic minor fires
and &quot;shots fired&quot; continue to be received, but no reports of
emergency service workers being injured or major incidents have
been received. Some looting has occurred and windows have been
broken in several parts of the city. While Police, Fire, and EMS
units are still busy, it is believed that cool, rainy, foggy
weather and extensive police planning may have helped to contain
worse violence. </p>
<p>ENN will provide continued reports in the event of major events
later tonight and will be providing coverage of events
surrounding Tuesday's city sponsored celebration at Grant Park
in downtown Chicago.

<H2>State Criminal Background Checks Are Coming</H2>
By Gary G. Ludwig, MS, EMT-P
<P>

Last year, the St. Louis Post Dispatch ran a series of articles
profiling EMTs and paramedics throughout Missouri who had
been issued medical licenses by the State of Missouri, although
they had criminal convictions for drugs, drunk driving, child abuse,
etc.  Missouri had no policy for doing criminal background checks
on individuals applying for medical licenses.  In fact, a good
percentage of states also had no policy. 
<P> 

As a result, Ken Cole, the Missouri State Director and 20-year veteran
was transferred to another position.  In response, the National
Association of State EMS Directors (NASEMSD) developed a guideline
and passed a resolution encouraging each state to implement a 
policy based on the NASEMSD's new guidelines for handling the certificiation,
licensure, or registration of medics with criminal backgrounds.  If
your department or state does not do background checks, fully
expect them to be done in the future at the state level.  The
NASEMSD can be reached at 619-431-7054.
<P>

AMR plans to offer a new issue of $110 million of 5.25% 
convertible subordinated notes due in the year 2001.  The notes 
will be convertible into common shares at $37.75 a share.  
Additionally, they may also plan to issue an additional $15 million 
of notes to cover over-allotments.
<P>

Couple this with their recent credit line of $150 million, and a 
secondary stocking offering last year of 4.25 million shares at 
about $25.50 each which raised $108.3 million, and we're talking 
about $368.3 million in their war chest to be used for corporate 
purposes, acquisitions of commercial ambulance services, or 
competition with fire agencies.
<P>

On December 4, 1995, for the third time in 1995,  four executives 
of AMR sold off nearly 200,000 shares of their stock holdings.  
Either the executives think the stock has topped out or their 
financial advisors told them to take their year end profits.
<P>

Not everything is happy in the AMR camp.  After losing several 
lawsuits for control of ambulance service in Sacramento (CA) and 
the recent favorable appellate court decision in California for fire 
agencies, AMR decided to settle the suit by paying the city of 
Sacramento $850,000.
<P>

AMR employees in Illinois are looking at unionizing after it was 
predicted that between 60 and 140 paramedics and EMTs would 
be laid off.  According to the Orland Park (IL) Star, "The 
dispatcher called people in off the street, laid some off and 
assigned their partners with new teammates".
<P>

Congratulations to Chief Vance Riley with the Victoria (TX) Fire 
Department.  In December, the City Council voted to merge the 
Victoria EMS Department into the Victoria Fire Department.  The 
premise behind the merger was that it would be more cost 
effective and efficient.  Chief Riley started laying the groundwork 
for the merger last April. Firefighters voluntarily will be trained as
EMTs and then paramedics will be cross-trained as firefighters.  
Chief Riley can be reached at 512-572-6600.
<P>

With yet another angle by commercial (private) providers to 
circumvent 9-1-1 and expand their business, Careline Southeast, 
a subsidiary of Medtrans, has applied for and acquired permission 
to use 3-1-1 in the Atlanta metro area.  Starting in mid-February, 
Atlanta residents can dial the three digit number to be connected 
directly to Careline Southeast's communications center.  In 1994, 
Acadian Ambulance in Louisiana and Priority EMS of 
New Orleans were granted permission to use 3-1-1.  The National 
Emergency Number Association (NENA) opposes these uses
since confusion can occur in an emergency and the wrong 
number can be dialed.
<P>

Quick Quiz: What EMS Conference has over 63 sessions with 
well-known EMS leaders and educators, 21 physcian lectures, 
mock disaster drills, fire, management, educator, clincal tracks, 
and a large exhibitor display.  It is EMS Expo!  Co-sponsored by 
the EMS Section, EMS Expo is slated for Atlanta, 
April 18-20, 1996.  For more information or the brochure, contact 
the Conference Management Corporation at 800-243-3238.

<H3>The World's Finest Protection for America's Greatest People</H3>
<P>
3D Medical, Inc. is proud to announce the availability of a new level of personal protection for medical and emergency response workers.  The innovative new product is a high-risk, powder-free, non-allergenic, non-slip latex examination glove. It is the ultimate in protection against both blood borne pathogens and latex protein allergies.
<P>
The new 3D Medical gloves are 10mils in thickness, to afford the wearer an additional measure of protection, while maintaining the maximum sensitivity possible. They are certified to a 1% pinhole level (AQL) to assure the denial of entry of pathogens, and they exceed FDA and ASTM requirements for medical grade exam gloves. The gloves are manufactured to ISO-9000 standards, which are stronger than FDA or ASTM standards for medical grade gloves.
<P>  
In a recent clinical study, conducted by Dr. E. Marcia Boyer of the University of Iowa, 3D Medical's gloves showed a marked decrease in wearer allergic sensitivity. 85% of the previously allergic people, participating in the study, noted a decrease in both the number and intensity of dermatological signs and symptoms when wearing 3D Medical gloves. 3D medical gloves are triple-leached and chlorinated to assure the removal of hand irritating proteins and micro-organisms.
<P>
According to 3D's Ralph Dahm, the high-risk gloves are extremely durable and feature a non-slip finish that will allow emergency and medical professionals to grasp and hold syringes, vacu-tainers, dressings and other equipment, even when they are wet or bloody. Dahm also said that the gloves have a beaded cuff for strength and that they are designed to reduce hand fatigue when worn for extended periods of time. And, 3D Medical gloves are 100% guaranteed to be free of defects.
<P>
The gloves are available in Small, Medium, Large, and Extra-large.

<H3>Palisades Park NJ Pursuit/Accident</H3>
<BR>
By James J. Fay, ENN NY/NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

Palisades Park, NJ, Bergen County (in the vicinity of the George Washington
Bridge)  At approximately  1015 Hrs. EST, Palisades Park Police in pursuit of a
violator resulted in a motor vehicle accident at the intersection of Broad Ave.
and Central Blvd.. The accident involving a "church bus" from a local Korean Church fully occupied with parishoners.  Numerous injuries were reported at the scene and at least one death.
<P> 
Initial reports state that the chase was started with Englewood, NJ,
Police, who reported that the pursued vehicle, a commercial food van, was
stolen in their jurisdiction. It is unknown if the Englewood Police chased 
the wanted vehicle into Palisades Park, or if Palisades Park attempted to 
stop the vehicle based on a raidioed discription. The stolen van crashed 
head-on into the church van and then into another civilian vehicle. Both vans 
then careened into a wall of a building near the Palisades Police Headquaters. 
<P>
The Bergen County Prosecutors Office, assisted by the County Sheriff's Crime 
Scene Unit are investigating the entire incident.

<H3> HATE CRIME SIEGE IN HARLEM?? </H3>
<B>At Least Eight Dead Injured In Shoot-out and Blaze Caused by Gunman
</B><P>
By James J. Fay-ENN NY/NJ Metro Correspondent
<BR>
New York, NY., December 9, 1995 -- A hostage incident and 3
alarm blaze at 272 West 125 St. in the Harlem section of
Manhattan, NYC, has resulted in the deaths of eight people. Six
others were reported injured, four from gunshot wounds.
<P>
At approximately 1000 hrs. EST, NYC Police were notified of a
"man with a gun" call for an individual who was reportedly
brandishing a gun in the vicinity of West 125 St. and Fifth Ave.
A man was identified by officers and a foot pursuit ensued.
<P> 
During the brief chase, shots were fired by the wanted person.
Concerns were raised on the radio by officers for Christmas
shoppers in the area of the heavily traveled commercial strip.
Police pursued the perpetrator into a store at 272 West 125 St.,
a men's clothing store, opposite the landmark Apollo Theater.
The area of the store had been the scene of several civil rights
demonstrations in the past two weeks.
<P> 
Shots continued to be fired from the store at the officers, and
one officer was reportedly trapped by gunfire emulating from the
store.  NYPD Emergency Service Units responded from Manhattan,
the Bronx and Brooklyn, upon reports from patrol units of the
shots being fired, with hostages inside the store. Initial
reports of at least 10 customers being held hostage were given
to police at the time of the takeover.
<P>
Police and SWAT members closed off the area in front of and
across the street  for both uniformed and plainclothes officers,
as well as the press, and designated the area as a "Heavy Vest"
area, due to the continued possibility of shots being fired.
<P>
The alleged perpetrator, still in the store, then pulled the
steel security gate down in the front of the store, and then
presumably set the store on fire. The FDNY was ordered by NYPD
to respond to the corner of W. 125 St. and Eighth Ave. and
advised that there were still shots being fired.  Upon arrival,
the first FD units transmitted a "10-75," with the 16th
Battalion immediately reporting an "All Hands" fire.
<P>
Due to the potential threat to firefighters, the initial attack
on the fire was to the 2nd floor of the 2 story, 100x100
commercial building, that was under renovation. Several fire
hoses were stretched to the front of the store, in an attempt to
extinguish the fire from the street, without actually entering
the building.  The fire continued to grow and eventually reached
a 3rd Alarm, with additional units called in to assist in the
eventual search. When the fire was finally brought under
control, NYPD Emergency Service Units and NYC's SWAT teams
entered the store, that was still smoldering, to search for the
gunman and his hostages. Once inside,  they made a gruesome
discovery...several bodies.
<P>
David Bookstaver, official NYC*EMS spokesman, told ENN that EMS
initially found and treated four people for gunshot wounds from
the original gunshots that had initiated the siege. In addition,
at least two NYPD Police Officers were removed to the hospital
due to the psychological trauma of the shootout.  Four
firefighters were also reportedly slightly injured in the rescue
effort. At approximately 1125 Hrs, EST, EMS reported four DOA's
as a result of the fire, with a total of at least four other
civilian injuries, all due to gunshot wounds.
<P>
By 1230 Hrs. the FDNY reported three additional DOA's (10-45
code 1),and at 1235 hrs.EST one additional DOA as a result of
the fire that engulfed the store. This brought to eight (8) the
total of victims. An NYC*EMS Captain, from the scene, told ENN 
that he believed that all eight deaths were as the result of
smoke inhalation, but that at least one victim may have suffered
severe smoke inhalation and burns and may not survive.
<P>
Speculation surrounding the motivation for the hostage taking
and fire is centering on the fact that civil rights
demonstrations have been, held in recent weeks, near the store.
According to at least one unconfirmed report, the gunman may
have participated in these previous demonstrations. Reportedly,
there had been plans by the building management to evict a black
record store from the same building. The building is managed by
a white Jewish man. Purportedly, threats to burn and loot the
clothing store had been previously made by an African American
man. A major "hate crime" investigation continues at this at the
time of this report.

<H3>Blizzard of '96' Paralyzes Northeast</H3>
By Paul Anderson. Metro Correspondent
<P>
Chicago, IL, January 8, 1995 -- In what is being called the
worst snowstorm in more than half a century, the entire
Northeastern section of the United States is being blanketed by
record amounts of snow and cold temperatures tonight. At least
eight states have declared a state-of-emergency and the National
Guard has been called out to assist in Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, and West Virginia. In some areas, the state police
report that the only reliable method of travel is by means of
four-wheel drive vehicles or military armored personnel
carriers.
<P> 

Sunday, the storm devastated several Mid and Southern Atlantic
states, where snow, sleet, and cold temperatures are not
normally seen. 24-28 inches of snow have fallen in parts of
Kentucky and North Carolina, resulting in power outages, fatal
traffic accidents, and the closing of many airports.  At least
ten people have reportedly died as the result of this storm,
nine of them in traffic accidents and one while shoveling snow.
<P>

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reports that airports
are reported closed in Washington, DC, New York, NY, Newark,New
Jersey, Raleigh-Durham, NC, Philadelphia, PA, Richmond, VA. and
many smaller airports. Connecting flights from and to many East
coast locations are being canceled or delayed and thousands of
people are reportedly stranded in Chicago, St. Louis, Memphis,
and other midwest and western airports.
<P>

A late announcement from Washington, DC says the federal workers
that had been returned to work on Monday by congressional budget
action will not be returning after all.  According to a source
close to the Office of Management and Budget, all DC federal
workers will be granted a "paid leave day" for Monday and will
not be required to report back to work until Tuesday, at the
earliest.
<P> 

In Maryland, where almost two feet of snow has fallen, a public
announcement has been issued by the University of Maryland and
Shock Trauma Center for volunteers with four-wheel-drive
vehicles to assist in getting hospital employees to work, to
deliver medicines, and transport dialysis and other patients to
important appointments. Similar announcements were made by the
Medical Center of Delaware, and in Prince George's County, VA.
<P> 

In New York City, where the storm had begun in earnest on
Sunday, it was officially declared a "blizzard" by U.S. National
Weather Service personnel. By 19:00EST, 14 inches of snow had
fallen at LaGuardia International airport.  Winds were clocked
at a sustained 35m.p.h. with gusts of greater intensity. At last
report, the visibility in many parts of NYC was reduced to less
than a quarter of a mile, with blowing and drifting snow...and
the snow was intensifying.
<P> 

Late this afternoon, Mayor Rudolph Guliani declared a
state-of-emergency in New York City and announced that the NYC
school system would be closed on Monday, the first time that has
happened since 1978. Guliani said that he had called out all of
the city's 1,300 snowplows and more than 300 salt-spreaders, in
an effort to keep the streets open to traffic. NYC Police, Fire,
and EMS personnel will reportedly be working at peak capacity to
assist citizens in need, and additional emergency personnel will
be called in as needed. It was also announced that the United
Nations will be closed on Monday, but that the major stock
exchanges will remain open. 
<P>

With an anticipated additional accumulation of 12-16 inches of
snow, vicious Nor'eastr' winds, and threatened flooding of New
York and New Jersey shorelines, Northeasterners are buying
groceries, bundling up, and "hunkering down" for the "Blizzard
of '96', one of the worst storms to strike the area in many
years.
<P>

additional emergency service reports as they become available)

<B>**LEAD STORY**</B>
<P>
<H2>CHANGES, REAL AND IMAGINED IN THE NYPD...</H2>
By Jim Fay  ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

Tuesday, March 26th, was a day in the NYPD that many say
will have long term effect on the Department.  At 1000 hrs.,
EST, Commissioner William Bratton handed in his resignation
to Mayor Rudolph Guiliani at City Hall, effective on April 15.
Later on the same day, Police Officer Peter DelDebbio was
found guilty of shooting a NYC Transit plainclothes officer
during a shootout on a subway platform, which occurred in
August of 1994.
<P>

Bratton's resignation ended a 27 month reign of a pro-active,
street-wise, former Boston police officer, as Commissioner
of the NYPD, who was primarily responsible for the
unprecedented decrease in street crime in NYC. Bratton
put a staff in place in his administration that, like himself,
were all a "cop's cop," able to use their police experience
to fighting crime on a block-by-block process. 
<P> 

By utilizing
uniformed patrol officers, as well as plainclothes task-
forces, and computerized crime analysis, Bratton put all
his resources to work to "bring the numbers down."
It worked.  Television interviews with neighborhood people
throughout the city confirmed what the numbers showed: that
street crime was down.  Bratton's promise of taking the
streets back was not hollow.
<P>

Bratton knew that the first line police officer was the
solution to the worsening problem. Officers on patrol were
ordered and expected to effect arrests for all "quality of
life" violations, such as the most annoying "squeegee
people," usually homeless individuals who stood at
intersections with long red light signals, seeking
handouts for cleaning your car windows.
<P>

Sometimes, a 'no' answer from the driver resulted in harrasement, or
worse, robbery.  It was this concentration on what was
annoying, which then sometimes escalated to felony crimes,
that Bratton's success was built on. Before the NYPD,
Bratton was the Chief of the NYC Transit Police. This
same concentration on low-level crimes in the NYC Transit
System, such as fare evasion, caused the crime stats in
Transit to decrease. The "fare-beat" arrests resulted in
arrests for guns, drugs, and outstanding warrants.
<P>

This aggressive policing raised the morale of the cop on
the street in the NYPD, a morale that was shattered during
the prior administration of Mayor David Dinkins, and his
Police Commissioner Brown.  Sources within the NYPD reported
that the Dinkins Administration officially sought the change
of the NYPD weapon from the .38 calibre revolver, down to
a .32 calibre gun, something that was unheard of before
this.  When Bratton arrived on the scene, while still in
Transit, he ordered bids to go out for an upgrade to the
9mm semiautomatic weapons.  This was the start of a good
relationship.
<P>

Later on the same day that Bratton quit, PO Peter DelDebbio
was found guilty of second degree assault.  The circumstances
of this situation is a text book example of what not to do in
a fire fight when you are in plainclothes.  DelDebbio was off-duty,
on his way home on the IRT subway train in Manhattan.
<P>

At the E. 53 St. station, the doors of the train opened, and DelDebbio
was faced with panic on the platform, the sound of shots being
fired, and the stinging pain in DelDebbio's left arm from having
been shot. In front of DelDebbio was a black male with a gun in
his hands. DelDebbio's reaction was from his training: stop the
action, protect yourself and anyone else who you believe to be
in danger, use deadly physical force if necessary.  This is just
what he did.
<P>

Unfortunately, the black male with a gun was a NYC Transit Officer in
plainclothes. DelDebbio fired, emptying his revolver, as trained.
The male with the gun, Officers Desmond Robinson, did not identify
himself in the manner proscribed by all NYC agencies: wear your shield
on your outer most garment, wear a cloth band signifying the "color
of the day" that all NYC agencies know, and surrender yourself to
a properly identified officer, if ordered to. Robinson went down with
several shots.
<P>

DelDebbio, although off-duty, did what he knew he had to do; Robinson
didn't do what he was suppose to do.  But DelDebbio was found guilty
of second degree assault on Robinson.  Police Officers in NYC are now
reeling from this verdict, and the cops on the street believe that it
will have a chilling effect on the way they operate off-duty, and, in
some cases, on-duty.  Having been found guilty of a felony, DelDebbio
automatically looses his job with the Police Department. Robinson
retired on a disability pension, and is suing the City of New York,
as well as DelDebbio personally, for fifty million dollars.

As of Tuesday, there were two decisions that will effect the NYPD
broadly for a good time to come.  Where the Police Department goes
from here, is anyone's guess.

<TITLE> Achille Lauro Fire, 3 Dead, 8 Hurt</TITLE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:09:20CST
<P>

                                 **NEWSFLASH-UPDATE**
<P>
<H3>Achille Lauro On Fire; 3 Dead, Eight Injured</H3>
<P>
   (Updates number of passengers, adds deaths, motive?)
<P>
Chicago, IL , November 29,1994 -- The cruise ship Achille Lauro, made
famous by a 1985 terrorist takeover, is reportedly on fire and
probably sinking, off the coast of Northern Africa.  A confirmed
British Royal Navy reports says that the Italian Registry ship
is located approximately 15 miles off the coast of Somalia. 
According to the BBC World Service, the ship caught fire early
this morning and as many as 900 passengers have been evacuated
into life boats at the time of this report.  British Coast Guard
officials say that the ship is listing and taking on water, and
that the crew has remained in an effort to fight a raging fire.
<P>

Although details are sketchy at this time, there are three
reported deaths, and eight reported injuries and fears that some
passengers may still be missing.  The actual cause of the fire
has not been determined, but speculation says that sabotage
can't be ruled out at this time.  Ships from several different
nations are reportedly on the scene of the disaster or enroute
to it.
<P>  

A major rescue effort is believed being mounted by both
helicopters and ships.  Italian authorities, monitoring the
situation, report that the Panamanian Oil ship Hawaiian King has
plucked more than 400 people from the water, and that another
ship has recovered another 200 people.  As many as 200 others
remain to be rescued. Two American Navy ships, including the
Missile Frigates Gettysburg and Halyburton, are enroute to the
scene, but had to travel 350 nautical miles to assist in the
rescue. Several other commercial shipping craft are said to have
picked people up from lifeboats.
<P>

Earlier reports said that the fire had been brought under
control, but the latest radio traffic from the incident area
says that a U.S. Navy pilot overflying the scene has said that
the entire aft of the ship is completely engulfed in flames. 
Some crew members may have remained on board to fight the fire,
but various confusing reports have said that everyone was
evacuated from the stricken vessel earlier this morning. One
unconfirmed report says that the ship is listing 40 degrees and
that it is in imminent anger of sinking.

<H3>Alabama Bombing; Attack on ATF Agent??</H3>
By Steve Macko
<P>
An Episcopal priest was injured by an exploding package on Monday
in Opelika, Alabama, located about 60 miles east of Montgomery.
Federal agents from the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms said that the device was a homemade bomb that was
made with murderous intent.
<P>

The priest survived the explosion by what one ATF Special Agent 
said as "sheer luck."  The priest walked into his carport and
found a box on the truck of his automobile.  When he picked the
box up, it exploded.  It is believed that the priest was not the
intended target of the device.  The bomb, most likely, was meant
for a retired ATF Special Agent that lives nearby.
<P>

ATF investigators said that the explosive device was a solid
explosive that was inside of a cardboard box with the word, "U-Haul"
printed on the side.  The device was designed to explode when the
box was moved or lifted.  The Special Agent-In-Charge of the
Birmingham ATF office said, "There's no question that bomb was put
there to kill someone.  It was a vicious device, an anti-personnel
device, designed to kill, designed to murder."  It is believed that
the device was loaded with nails.
<P>

The priest is reported to be in good condition at a local hospital.
Later, the ATF said that they believe that the bomb may have been
an act of anti-government violence.  A note was found near the
bomb and included these words: "Alabama to unite against the ATF
conspiracy."  The ATF is continuing their investigation.

<H3>Violent Weekend in Chicago</H3>
<BR>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>
It is shaping up to be a violent weekend in Chicago.  Several homicides
and shootings have been keeping Violent Crime investigators quite busy.
Special attention is being given to the City's West Side, especially
in the Harrison and Marquette areas, where a gang war seems to be brewing.
<P>  

On Thursday, there were two homicides.  A 44-year-old male was found
shot to death outside of 1236 South Karlov Avenue in the 10th Police
District on the City's West Side.  Police believe that the victim was
dealing in the drugs.  Later, a 37-year-old male was found beaten to
death outside of 2210 West Warren Blvd in the 13th Police District also
on the West Side.  The homicide appears to be the result of a robbery.
<P>

On Friday morning, at about 0245 CST, the still-smoldering body of
a 25-year-old male was found in the alley behind 1331 South Kedvale
Avenue in the 10th Police District on Chicago's West Side.  The victim
was reported to be bound with wire, beaten about the head and set on
fire.
<P>

Another man, this one said to be 43-years-old, was found burning less
than two hours later after the above homicide at 2857 West Taylor Street
in the 11th Police District on Chicago's West Side.  The victim was
transported to Cook County Hospital in critical condition with burns
over 80 percent of his body.  This victim died less than 24 hours later.
Police said that they had no suspects in custody.
<P>

At about 1200 CST on Friday, there was a shooting across the street
from a bus station at 565 West Harrsion Street in the 1st Police District
near Chicago's Loop.  Witnesses said that a man shot two unarmed
security guards.  The two security guards were in a hot dog stand when
one of the victims became involved in an altercation with two patrons.
One of the patrons pulled out a gun and shot both guards.  One of the
guards was killed and the other suffered a serious gunshot wound to the
arm.
<P>

In other homicides from the past few days -- A man was found shot
several times at 815 North Ridgeway Avenue in the 11th Police District.
Police say that this shooting was gang-related.  In the 10th Police 
District, a 20-year-old male was shot to death at 1836 South Karlov
Avenue.  This homicide also appears to be gang-related.
<P>

On Saturday morning, a long-time worker for the City of Chicago Streets
and Sanitation Department was shot and killed during an apparent
carjacking.  The 58-year-old victim's body was found in an alley in
the 1800 block of West Cornelia Avenue in the 19th Police District
on the North Side.  Belmont area investigators were questioning two
suspects on Saturday.
<P>

And finally, the 128th Chicago area bank robbery of the year took place
on Saturday morning at about 0940 CST at the Household Bank located at
5960 West Irving Park Road in the 16th Police District on the City's 
Northwest Side.  A man told a bank teller that he had a gun and fled
with about $2,000 in cash.

<TITLE>Illinois School Fire Safety</TITLE>

<P>
Illinois...ENNFAX Report from 11/09/95
<P>
By Steve Macko
<P>
<H3>Illinois School Fire Safety Suffers?</H3>
<P>
Considerable opposition is being placed against a state of Illinois
House Bill that will reduce the level of fire safety required in two
Illinois school districts -- one in Kankakee and another in the
southwest Chicago suburb of Lemont.  The Office of the State Fire
Marshal, the Illinois Fire Chiefs Association, the Illinois Fire
Inspectors Association and the Illinois Fire Protection Districts
Association all oppose House Bill 854 that will allow the school 
districts to bypass a law that requires installing fire sprinkler 
systems into any new construction or any renovated construction that 
is over fifty percent of total current square footage.
<P>

Tom O'Connell, a retired 31-year member of the Chicago Fire Department
said, "It is outrageous that the safety of Illinois school children be
compromised to satisfy the self-serving, political whims of two school
districts."  Fire safety in Chicago and Illinois schools came to the
forefront in 1958 with the infamous Our Lady of Angels school fire
in Chicago that killed 96 children and three nuns.  After this fire,  
much more strigent fire codes, in regards to school buildings was
put into effect in almost every community in the United States.
According to O'Connell the requested exemptions by the two school 
districts goes against common sense.
<P>

Fires in schools are not uncommon in the United States.  The National
Fire Protection Association said that there are an average of 8,200
school fires every year in the United States.  An average of 190
children are killed or injured, every year, in these fires.

<p align=center><font size=5>***ERRI News Round-Up/Analysis; 08/22/96****</font><br>
By Clark Staten, Analyst</p>
<p align=left><br>
<strong>This is a brief summary of on-going events, chosen by the Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute, as 
significant in the coming days.</strong><br>
<br>
<font size=5><strong>International Scene:</strong></font><br>
<br>
<img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> 1&gt; <strong>Chechnya </strong>- Former General and current Nation Security Advisor Lebed has been placed in the possibly untenable 
position of attempting to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in the break-away Republic of Chechnya. Some experts 
believe that Lebed may have been set-up for failure by &quot;hard-core&quot; members of the general staff; others fear the possibility 
of an anti-democracy military coup in Russia. All-in-all, the stability of the former superpower may be at risk, this region 
bears close scrutiny in the coming days.<br>
<br>
<img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> 2&gt; <strong>Pakistan</strong> - As previously reported by ENN, the country of Pakistan may be on the verge of a &quot;civil war&quot;, as 
fractional violence continues between religious and political organizations. Threats have reportedly been made against 
American interests in the area by Islamic militant groups. Rifle assaults and bombings continue there on an almost daily 
basis. <br>
<br>
<img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> 3&gt; <strong>Saudi Arabia </strong>- Threats and published accounts of threats by pro-militant spokespeople in England and elsewhere 
continue to warn of another attack on American or Saudi forces in the near future. SecDef William Perry has himself 
reported concerns of additional attacks. Other concerns continue to be raised about the seeming lack of information 
coming from our Saudi allies in regard to the Dhahran housing bombing. Speculation continues of whether the attack was 
sponsored/financed by another nation-state or an internal dissident group.<br>
<br>
<img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> 4&gt; <strong>Korea </strong>- Several N. Korean defections in the past few days would seem to indicate that food shortages and 
economic hardship may have further increased in the communist stronghold, despite efforts by U.S., Japanese, and other 
international relief organizations. Recent rains and flooding may have made an already bad situation worse. S.Korean 
officials have issued warnings within the past 48 hours that they fear &quot;provocations&quot; by N. Korean forces in the coming 
days. Tensions are already high in S. Korea, following several days of &quot;pro-unification&quot; student riots, allegedly inspired by 
N. Korean &quot;agitators.&quot; Joint U.S./R.O.K. military exercises will begin soon.<br>
<br>
<img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> 5&gt; <strong>Israel/Gaza</strong> - Multiple reports continue to come in to ENN about alleged plots by splinter Palestinian groups to 
assassinate Yasar Arafat and end his control of the Palestinian Authority. Coupled with increasingly threatening rhetoric by 
Iranian sources, ERRI analysts see the possibility of additional terror attacks in Israel in the coming days. Additionally, 
American support for the PLO/Israeli peace process, and its recent attempt at essentially unilateral sanctions against Iran 
and Libya, place it at higher risk as well.<br>
<br>
<font size=5><strong>National:</strong></font><br>
<br>
<img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> 1&gt; Infrastructure Attacks - A continual assessment, by ERRI, of possible infrastructure attacks against the the United 
States reveals vulnerability in a number of areas. Concerns have been raised about public, private, and government 
computer networks, power grids, water supplies, food supplies, public transportation systems, and any area of mass 
gathering. All could be targets of potential terrorist attack. The primary problem concerns the fact that many of these basic 
and essential services have not be &quot;hardened&quot; to withstand insurgent assault. A debate can be expected to continue about 
the trade-off of civil liberties for additional security. <br>

<TITLE>The Ground War Begins -02/24/91</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 0300 HSR.CST-02-24-91
<BR> 

<H3>THE GROUND WAR BEGINS IN KUWAIT</H3>
<BR>          
Chicago, IL.  The Ground offensive in Kuwait has begun. The
President of United States, George Bush, reportedly gave Gen.
Norman Schwarzkoph the option to proceed with a ground
offensive shortly after the final futile efforts at peace
had failed.  President Bush reportedly said, "We have entered
the final phase of the liberation of Kuwait".  Elements of
the Coalition forces were reported to have began liberation
actions across the front at approx. 0400 HRS., Riyadh time.
<P>

Reportedly, elements of the U.S. VIIth Corp and XVIIIth Corp
had begun a classified operation to "cut-off" the Iraqi
military from it supply lines and reinforcements. Although
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had made it very clear that no
news briefings would occur during the first twenty-four to
forty eight hours, various reports are surfacing regarding
the status of the Coalition forces.  Early reports indicate
that the island of Jazirat Faylakah had been conquered and
that as many as two-hundred Iraqi troops had been captured or
surrendered.
<P>

Military and intelligence analysts in Chicago and elsewhere
are predicting that early clashes will involve relatively
inexperienced front-line troops that have been conscripted
and are being constantly monitored by members of the
"Republican Guard" and special "enforcement squads" that are
reportedly circulating among the various elements of the
fixed emplacements.  Deserters or those that fail to fight
are reportedly being summarily executed.  Therefore, it is
likely that the emplaced Iraqi troops will fight, with a
question remaining as to the intensity of their resolve.
Several military analysts have suggested that the fighting
will be intense but brief at the frontlines and that the
Coalition forces should be able to advance into Kuwait for at
least ten (10) kilometers before encountering the more
experienced and motivated troops.
<P>

Washington and Chicago analysts predict that the
"Revolutionary Guard" and other elite units will react in
entirely a different manner.  Many of these troops are
fiercely loyal to Saddam Hussein, especially a "super-elite"
unit of 12-15,000 men from the area of Hussein's home village
of Takrit.  They can be expected to have received a majority
of the best equipment, supplies, and other resources. They
can also be used to fill any breaches that occur in the
frontline. Some military sources indicate, however, that the
"Republican Guard" has been the recipient of the munitions
from more than eight hundred (800) air sorties during the
last few days. Most military sources report that they will
not underestimate the capability of the Iraqi forces, until
more intelligence information becomes available.
<P>

The Iraqi military uses a "soviet-style" defense-
in-depth, and reserves it's armor and most capable units to
take advantage of any possiblity of counter-attack. Aerial
observation of some emplacements even reflects that they have
copied the exact designs of "Soviet-Army" defenses. The
counter-attack role is believed to be undertaken by the
"Republican Guard", with it's Soviet T-72 Tanks and
mechanized infantry.  The frontlines are expected to include
sand berms, trenches filled with petroleum products that can
be set on fire, large numbers of anti-armor and anti-
personnel mines, and anti-tank emplacements.  All defenses
are designed to attempt to "funnel" attacking forces into
predesignated areas and then fire upon them with artillery
pieces, antiaircraft weapons, and possibly poison gases.
<P>

Intelligence reports also indicate that Iraqi special forces
units that are trained to the level of the Soviet "Spetznaz"
forces, are "in theatre" and can be expected to be used.
These troops can be expected to attempt to infiltrate Saudia
Arabia and disrupt Coalition command and control functions,
sabotage comunications and munitions facilities, and to
conduct assasinations of military and political leaders.
Reportedly, several hundred Iraqi troops have been trained to
simulate "Bedioun Tribesmen" who are know to wander the
"neutral territory" between Iraq and Saudia Arabia. Unless
challenged, they are prepared to conduct terrorist activities
in the Coalition forces rear areas.
<P>

At least one anti-terrorist analyst in Chicago has verified
that there exists an expectation of "increased terrorist
activity" throughout the world.  All members of the Allied
Coalition are reportedly on the highest state of alert in an
anti-terrorist effort. "As the expected success of the
Coalition forces becomes evident, the likelihood of terrorist
attacks increases", according to Clark Staten, the author of
Emergency Response Guide to Terrorism.  "The Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) has done an excellent job of
protecting America during the current crisis...they have
reportedly thwarted at least six (6) suspected attacks or
interrupted conspiracies that were planning to conduct
terrorist activities", Staten said.  "In light of current
developments, it is necessary that all U.S. citizens report
any suspicious objects, personnel, or situations that might
compromise the security of America....all relevant
information should be given to the FBI at the earliest
opportunity", Staten concluded.
<P>

So, the struggle goes on.  Undoubtedly, many obstacles will
still face the Allied forces.  But, it would appear that the
Coalition is militarily prepared and motivated to liberate
the country of Kuwait and re-establish freedom from tyranny
and prosecute the oppression and aggression of Saddam
Hussein.

<title>Troponin-T Testing in Myocardial Infarction</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<p><font size=5><strong>Testing for Troponin-T in Potential <br>
Myocardial Infarction Patients</strong></font><br>
By Daryl Shaw, Medical Student<br>
<br>
The following is a synopsis of an article in the May/June issue of RETTUNGSMAGAZIN. I have condensed 
and translated it and will include additions re: muscle/cardiological physiology for easier understanding.:<br>
<br>
More than 250,000 persons suffer an AMI per year in Germany. Approx. 20% of these expire within 2 hours 
of ischamic begin. For this reason, it was of great importance that an objective test be found to confirm or 
indicate AMI in the preclinical (EMS) theater.<br>
<br>
It was discovered that the cardial enzyme Troponin-T, a deciding factor in the Actin-Myosin contractile system 
typical to all muscles, especially striped muscle and, histologically related, cardial myocardial muscle. The 
component Troponin-T of the Actin strand is responsible, along with Tropomyosin, for the contraction in the 
individual muscle strand, in that they interact with calcium to allow or block the contraction cycle.<br>
<br>
It has been determined that ischemia results in the release of Troponin-T from the damaged area of the 
myocard, whereby concentrations above 0.2 ng/ml blood are pathological and can be illustrated with the test.<br>
<br>
The best situation for the use of the test is AMI suspect patients where ECG conformation is not definite or the 
symptomatic picture is &quot;unappropriate&quot;. Dr. Motschwiller from Boehringer Mannheim stresses the fallicy of sole 
usage for AMI diagnosis, &quot;The Tropt-Test should not be overestimated...(it) is primarily for the conformation of 
a suspected (AMI) diagnosis&quot;(Due to individual cardiovascular kinetics and release rate, enzyme conformation 
may take up to 30 mins. after ischemia beginning.).<br>
<br>
The test is composed of documentation card, test stick and syringe. 150 microliter anti-coagulated blood (i.e. 
from blood lab tube/Vacutainer) is put in window of test stick and covered with included flap. The stick is 
attached to the documentation card and the necessary information including start time is included. After &quot;a few&quot; 
(5) minutes a result can be visually registered; 1 stripe (control): negative , 2 stripes: positive. When negative, a 
waiting period of 20 minutes is advisable (kinetics). This test is only of qualitative value; a quantitive evaluation 
must be done in the treating facility. Due to the kinetics of release, a negative test result can occur up to 12 
hours post ischemia.<br>
<br>
Finally, there is the problem of storage; the test must be kept between 2 and 8 degrees celsius and only is good 
for a week at room temperature, hence the need for a cool storage area, i.e. a refridgerator.<br>
<br>
The tests cost DM 179,98 for 10 sets or DM 100,40 for 5 Sets.<br>

<p><strong>Author's note:</strong></p>
<p>Obviously, the arena in the U.S. differs from ours. We (rarely) use a First Responder system, and due to 
legalities, the EMS physician is on scene within 15 minutes. The closest hospital is (for us) anywhere between 
5-10 mins. away, whereby I can be in 6-8 hospitals within 15-20 mins. Perhaps the most aggrevating item is 
that , technically, we cannot perform ANY invasive procedures, including i.v. admin. with LR or NSS. Luckily, 
most Drs. are open to anybody willing to help. On the local level (see first response), anything above the most 
basic Advanced First Aid is forbidden, and doing anything above that is costly to your life span in the org., even 
if it was &quot;appropriate&quot; ( I speak from experience! ) or you are trained to do more than the rest (as I am) or you 
know better (AHEM!!). Therefore, I do not believe anybody below the medical level will gain very much 
(EMS) experience with the Troponin-T test unless major changes are made.<br>

<H2>Gunman with Possible Explosives Strapped to His Body; Barricaded in Colorado Springs Office Building</H2>
By Clark Staten
<P>

(ENN) A man, believed to be a disgruntled former construction worker, is reportedly holed-up in the main administration building of a family focus forum in Colorado Springs, CO at this hour. According to witnesses, the unidentified gunman has both weapons and explosives and
has held police at bay since 2:30p.m. MDT this afternoon.
<P>

A Colorado Springs police spokesperson, Lt. Allan Scott, said that the man is holding what appears to be a "stick with an electrical switch on it." The 
stick is reportedly connected by wires to a some sort of a satchel strapped to the man's body. He is also reportedly armed with at least one handgun, which 
he kept brandishing and "playing with the hammer."
<P>

At least four hostages were originally taken by the gunman, two men and
two women. After two hours of negotiations with police, all four were 
released. One of the released hostages confirmed that the man had "some sort 
of device" attached to his torso and had talked about "blowing himself up."
<P>

The gunman reportedly entered the conservative Christian "Focus on Family" building in an attempt to redress grievances in regard to a workman's
compensation dispute, in which he didn't feel that he was adequately
compensated for injures he had received while helping to build the
three-story complex.
<P>

According to a police spokesperson, negotiations continue at this time
and police are hopeful of a peaceful resolution. The assailant has not
been identified.

<TITLE>Boza Virus Attacks Windows 95</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
For Immediate Release: 02/03/96
<P>
<H2>Windows 95 Virus-Boza Announced</H2>

 It would appear that an Austrailian "hacker" may have created the first computer virus specifically targeted at Microsoft's Windows 95 program, according to British researchers. The virus can corrupt executable programs, and potentially be spread to other computers.  It is allegedly the first virus that is written specifically for Windows 95.
<P>
   Although the virus doesn't appear to be well-written, "Boza will go down in history," according to the Associated Press (AP) and British anti-virus specialist Paul Ducklin.   Analysts have named the virus "Boza" after a Bulgarian liquor "so powerful that just looking at it will give you a headache," Ducklin said. Fortunately for Windows 95 users, the virus also does not appear particularly contagious, if proper precautions are taken.  The problem is vested in a sharing of software programs, which is already illegal (and certainly unwise) in most countries. To infect someone else's machine, they would have to be given an infected program, and they would have to run it. The program could then infect that host machine and begin to replicate.
<P>
   Ducklin said Boza is not generally being distributed on networks or among users' personal computers.  So far, it appears to be circulating mainly among anti-virus researchers. Software has reportedly already been developed to destroy it.  Computer analysts do not know who made the virus, although there may be a clue in one of the messages that Boza can display on computer screens: "VLAD Australia does it again with the world's first Win95 virus."  VLAD is thought by counter-virus analysts to be a Bulgarian-based international group of virus writers, who have previously developed several insidious and destructive pieces of computer code.
<P>
  Anti-virus investigators say that they are concerned that Microsoft released Windows 95 in August without any sort of anti-virus program that could detect and kill 32 bit viruses. Boza is allegedly written specifically to corrupt 32-bit programs, like Windows 95.  According to other press reports, Microsoft already had to fight an unconfirmed, but widely distributed, report that at least one version of Windows 95 came with a virus already on the installation diskettes. ERRI again reminds computer users to practice "safe computing"; back-up frequently, don't share copyrighted programs, and run a competent anti-virus program on a constant basis.

<H3>Train Hits Bus in Fox River Grove; 5 Dead</H3>
<BR>

Chicago, IL, (ENN) October 25, 1995 -- At 0715 CDT this morning, Metra
commuter train #624, that was traveling express toward Chicago
at about 50 MPH, plowed into the rear of a school bus carrying
students to Cary Grove High School in Cary, Illinois.  The
accident happened at a marked train crossing at the intersection
of U.S. Route 14 and Algonquin Road in downtown Fox River Grove,
Illinois, which is located in McHenry County about 40 miles
northwest of Chicago.
<P>

The intersection where the accident occurred is difficult to
describe. The train tracks are very close to the intersection. 
There is apparently only room for one or two automobiles between
the tracks and the intersection, where there are traffic
signals.  There was a car in front of the bus, on Algonquin
Road, that was attempting to make a right turn on to U.S. Route
14. The car was unable to turn because of the volume of high
speed traffic, trapping the bus on the tracks.
<P>  

The impact caused extensive damage to the bus.  According to
witnesses, the train hit the bus in the rear, lifted the body of
the bus off the chassis, turning it in mid-air, and throwing it
about 50 feet away from the chassis. It appears that the bus did
not rollover, as was earlier reported.  Some of the victims
reportedly were thrown  from the bus, through the windows.
<P>

An eyewitness to the accident said that the bus was trapped on
the tracks and had no apparent place to go.  The witness said
that the children knew that the train was coming and were trying
to rush toward the front portion of the bus.  One expert, on the
scene, who has been to the scene of many similar incidents said,
"It could have been far worse."
<P>

Statistics indicate, however, that the accident was very tragic
in its toll.  Five children were killed and at least 28 others,
including the bus driver, were injured.  About five of those
injured were said to be in critical condition.  Many of the
injuries to the victims were to the neck and back and several
suffered serious cuts from the flying glass. Several of the
children were airlifted to area trauma centers by medical
evacuation helicopters.
<P>

The accident happened right across the street from the Fox River
Grove Police Station.  Immediately after the crash, witnesses
said that all of the officers in the station rushed to the scene
within seconds after the impact. The Fox River Grove Fire
Department was called and immediately requested an Emergency
Medical Services 5th Alarm on Box 5-651, upon arrival at the
scene.
<P>  

In all, 16 ambulances were sent to the scene of the crash, as
well as the three medical evacuation helicopters.  One child was
sent to Loyola Medical Center in Maywood and two were
transported to Lutheran General Medical Center in Park Ridge. 
The incident was declared under control by Fox River Grove Fire
Command at 08:50 CDT. According to police officials, the
National Transportation Safety Board is enroute to the scene and
an intensive investigation of the accident will ensue later
today.
<P>

Clark Staten, Executive Director of the Chicago-based Emergency
Response & Research Institute (ERRI), said that this tragic
accident is another example of the appalling traffic safety
record of school buses in the Chicago metropolitan area. Staten
said that ERRI has been tracking accidents involving school
buses for at least two years and has issued several previous
warnings about the training, safety, and recruitment practices
of many Chicago-area bus companies. Staten has called for state
legislation to tighten hiring procedures, to ensure driver
safety training, and to cause mandatory periodic drug and
alcohol testing of bus drivers.  According to Staten, those with
poor driving records or substance abuse problems shouldn't be
transporting our most valuable asset, our children.
<P>

"Although all the facts aren't in yet...and we would reserve our
final determination until they are...it would appear that some
basic safety practices weren't followed in the Fox River Grove
accident", Staten said in an exclusive interview this morning.
"School buses should stop at all train crossings, open their
doors to visually check the tracks, make sure they are clear,
and then proceed", Staten added. "It is also imperative that
school buses and other vehicles stop short of track crossings
and ensure that they can't be trapped in between crossing
gates", the retired paramedic administrator said. "It would
appear that the intersection was poorly designed, the driver
didn't follow some basic safety rules, or a combination of
both"; Staten concluded.
<P>

(Ed. note: As of 11/03/95 --two additional children subsequently 
 died as the result of their injuries sustained in this incident, 
 bringing the death  toll to seven (7))

<H3>HOLIDAY FIRE SAFETY TIPS ANNOUNCED</H3>
<P>
Chicago, IL.   Deadly fires occur every year at this time.
These fires take unecessary lives and cause tragedies at what
should be a joyous time of year. The dangers involved with
the holiday season should prompt an examination of everyone's 
home fire safety habits.
<P>  
According to Clark Staten of the Chicago based Emergency Response & Research
Institute, this concern is based on several blazes
that have taken lives in Chicago and elsewhere in the country.
Preliminary indications show that at least one of the major causes
of these fatal fires are faulty electrical extension cords. Something that could be easily avoided.
<P>

"During the holiday season, we seem to put an increased
electrical load on our sometimes already overburdened
circuits", Staten said.  "The possible result of overloading
cicuits are tragedies that occur with amazing frequency at this time of year",
the veteran paramedic added.  "Unfortunately, many people
forget to individually check their light strands and
extension cords before installing them on a Christmas tree or
in windows", he continued. "Christmas is a time to be
extremely conscious of fire safety... by doing so, we can all
have a happy and healthy New Year", Staten concluded.
<P>

According to the Emergency Response & Research Institute, the
following items should be checked when completing a home fire
safety checklist for the holiday season:
<P>
<HR>
<BR>
<H4>Electrical Dangers</H4>
<P>

1. Check all extension cords for "fraying", loose
   connections, or bent plugs
<P>

2. Check all light strands for "fraying" cords, loose bulbs,
   broken or cracked sockets, and serviceable plugs
<P>

3. Do NOT exceed the manufacturer's (Underwriters Laboratory)
   recommendations for the number of strands of lights to be
   connected together
<P>

4. Do NOT use small diameter "light utility" extension cords
   for multiple electrical appliances/lighting devices
<P>

5. Do NOT use indoor rated extension cords or lights for
   outdoor displays
<P>

6. Do NOT disable or bypass grounded circuits (three prong
   outlets and plugs)
<P>

7. Do not "pinch" or "crimp" power cords when laying and
   hanging lights and displays
<P>

8. Insure that you are using the correct size circuit
   breaker or fuses for the circuit that will support your
   Christmas lights...do NOT place a larger fuse in the
   circuit if it repeatedly "blows"...reduce the number of
   lights/devices that are being used
<P>

9. If any cord, light set, or circuit, feels warm to the
   touch...DISCONNECT it IMMEDIATELY and check the entire
   connection for defects.
<P>
10. If in doubt about ANY electrical connection...DON'T use
    it...replace/fix it!
<P>
<BR>
<H4>Fire/Open Flames</H4>
<P>

1. DO NOT use an oven or stove burners for heating your house
   or apartment!  The money is far better spent on a well
   ventilated heating system
<P>

2. Use space heaters with extreme caution and AVOID any that
   use an open flame.  Insure that they are NEVER located
   near ANY combustible materials (i.e. curtains, chairs,
   bedding, etc.)
<P>

3. Use extreme caution when using candles for
   decoration...NEVER use them on or near a Christmas tree
<P>

4. Insure that you have a mesh grate around all fireplaces
   that contains the possible movement of sparks or ashes
<P>

5. Be extremely cautious when emptying ashtrays into
   trash/garbage cans...non-extinguished smoking materials
   can smolder for hours and then burst unexpectedly into
   flames many hours later
<P>

GIVE YOURSELF A GIFT THIS CHRISTMAS...
<P>

REPLACE THE BATTERY IN ALL SMOKE DETECTORS AND TEST THEM
PRIOR TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON!!  DON'T HAVE ONE ??
GET ONE AND USE IT!!  THE LIFE YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR OWN !!

<H2>Broward County Revamps EMS</H2>
By Gary G. Ludwig, MS, EMT-P</center>
<P>

After a three-year process, Broward County, Florida, has finalized a major EMS restructuring. Effective October 1, 1996, Broward County Fire Rescue, the largest ALS service provider in the area, will downsize its service area, transfer some of its ALS responsibility to adjoining areas, and begin assuming full transport responsibilities from private ambulance providers. While BCFR will retain the majority of its service area, some paramedic jobs were at risk. Therefore, the restructuring calls for the county to begin full transport services. Previously, private ambulance providers such as Lifefleet, an operation of Medtrans, had provided all transport services for BCFR.
<P>

In a twist on the public/private cooperative, the county and some municipalities have developed a "public/public cooperative."  Under the new arrangement, a dedicated property tax will be assessed for operation of the system. Participating municipalities and Broward County will utilize ALS engines along with ALS transport units. As an example, in Ft. Lauderdale, half of the transport units will be city run and half will be county operated. All communication and logistical support will be provided by Broward County.
<P>

This "public/public cooperative" combined the existing resources of various municipalities and the county. Thus, the need for private ambulances was eliminated. This system change has broken the relationship that private ambulance providers maintained for over twenty years. Additionally, all participants can now provide ALS levels of care  which was not possible previously. With a win/win scenario for everyone, the system efficiency will greatly improve and the average homeowner will pay less property taxes per year while receiving double the protection. For more information, contact Bruce Moeller at 305-831-8200.

<HR>
<H3>Newport Beach, CA Reports New Ambulance Transport System</H3>
The Newport Beach (California) Fire & Marine has secured a victory with a City Council vote of 6-1 to assume responsibility for ambulance transport.  With tactics reminiscent of "Careline," Medtrans corporate officers tried to sway the city to maintain their contract with Medtrans by mailing out four-page color brochures to citizens seeking their support. Other efforts included a strong lobbying efforts behind the scenes with City Council members. The mailer used red-herrings such as the Orange County fiscal crisis and other ruses, referring to government stealing the bread out of their mouths. Chief Timothy Riley tells me his department took the highroad and stayed out of the mudslinging, choosing instead to concentrate efforts on educating the City Council about the cost benefits and increased service levels possible with their proposal.
<P>

On the day of the City Council hearing and vote, the Medtrans organization was hardly noticeable as their strategy was to allow a few citizens to argue their points. In the end the City Council overwhelmingly supported NBF&M's proposal. Riley can be reached at 714-644-3103.

<HR>
<H3>IAFF Announces EMS Director/Fire & EMS Systems</H3>
Alfred Whitehead, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, has announced the creation of a new department in the IAFF to promote fire-based EMS systems. The EMS division was created to dedicate more resources and effort to locals seeking to promote or enhance fire-based EMS systems in the United States and Canada. This new department elevates EMS to the same levels as other IAFF departments, such as Governmental Affairs and Health & Safety. Appointed to the position of EMS director is Lori Moore, who previously served in the Washington D.C. offices as an EMS specialist. Moore will have a staff who will work full time on fire service EMS issues.  Congratulations Lori!

<B>**LEAD STORY**</B>
<BR>
<H3>NORTHERN IRELAND VIOLENCE...</H3>
   ANDRE DE NESNER
<BR>
   LONDON
<P>

Four people have been killed in Belfast this month as violence
returns to the streets of Northern Ireland's largest city.
<P>

A previously unknown group calling itself Direct Action
Against Drugs has claimed responsibility for the killings. All of
the four men shot to death were Roman Catholics and police
believe the gunmen responsible for the attacks are linked to the
Irish Republican Army.
<P>

For nearly 16 months now, nationalist paramilitary groups,
such as the IRA, and their pro-British, or loyalist, counterparts
have been abiding by the terms of their respective cease-fires.
Many people in Northern Ireland believe this latest wave of
violence is not a breach of the cease-fires, but at the same time
they are concerned it might escalate.
<P>

David Ervine is a senior member of the small progressive
unionist party known to have close links to pro-British
paramilitary groups. He says while the latest killings have been
in Belfast's Roman Catholic areas people in his Protestant
constituency are very fearful: "People are very worried. People 
are really, really worried.  They think it is a windup to or a precursor 
if you like to something more serious and one hopes that that is not 
the case.  And one hopes that people on the other side and people 
like me are working as feverishly as they can behind the scenes to 
make sure that does not happen."
<P>

Belfast police say the killings are a sign the IRA may be
exercising its own brand of justice against suspected drug
dealers, while at the same time intimidating people in areas it
controls.
<P>

However Ken Maginnis, security spokesman for the moderate
Protestant Ulster Unionist party, believes the killings may lead
to something more ominous: "The more sinister reason for the 
killings is in preparation for the beginning of murder of people 
within the Protestant community and that will be done in the 
not too distant future, probably within the next month by the 
IRA killing a member of a Protestant loyalist organization and 
saying we killed this person because he was involved in drugs, 
but they really will expect the loyalist paramilitaries to retaliate."
<P>

Mr. Maginnis says if that does happen, he hopes the loyalist
paramilitaries will not retaliate.
<P>

However David Ervine, with close links to loyalist
paramilitaries, says these groups will have to show a great deal
of restraint not to respond: "My desire would be that if we had a 
scenario like that, that the loyalists would hold fast. I fear that 
they would hold fast for hours, I do not think I could hold it for days."
<P>

Many politicians have condemned the killings in Belfast.
However Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican
Army, has not. Over the past few months, senior Sinn Fein
officials have warned of a possible return to violence by the IRA
if there is no movement in the Northern Ireland peace process.

An Episcopal priest was injured by an exploding package on Monday
in Opelika, Alabama, located about 60 miles east of Montgomery.
Federal agents from the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms said that the device was a homemade bomb that was
made with murderous intent.
<P>

The priest survived the explosion by what one ATF Special Agent 
said as "sheer luck."  The priest walked into his carport and
found a box on the truck of his automobile.  When he picked the
box up, it exploded.  It is believed that the priest was not the
intended target of the device.  The bomb, most likely, was meant
for a retired ATF Special Agent that lives nearby.
<P>

ATF investigators said that the explosive device was a solid
explosive that was inside of a cardboard box with the word, "U-Haul"
printed on the side.  The device was designed to explode when the
box was moved or lifted.  The Special Agent-In-Charge of the
Birmingham ATF office said, "There's no question that bomb was put
there to kill someone.  It was a vicious device, an anti-personnel
device, designed to kill, designed to murder."  It is believed that
the device was loaded with nails.
<P>

The priest is reported to be in good condition at a local hospital.
Later, the ATF said that they believe that the bomb may have been
an act of anti-government violence.  A note was found near the
bomb and included these words: "Alabama to unite against the ATF
conspiracy."  The ATF is continuing their investigation.
<P>
<B>Wisconsin...</B>
<BR>
Researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin have been able
to determine that a short-barreled .25-caliber handgun is the
most common weapon used in homicides and suicides in the
Milwaukee area.  One handgun, the inexpensive Raven MP 25,
was said to be used in 14 percent of the homicides and 12 percent
of the suicides carried out in a five year period in Milwaukee.

A house fire in the suburbs of Montreal claimed the lives of five
people on Tuesday.  Fire broke out in the basement of the two-story
brick dwelling located in Laval, Quebec, at about 0900 EST.
<P>

Firefighters found two parents and two children aged 5 and 6-years
in the master bedroom of the home.  The 5-year-old twin of one of
the dead children was found in the basement.  All of the victims
apparently died from smoke inhalation.

<B>Zaire...</B>
<BR>
A passenger truck that was carrying almost 100 people crashed into
a ditch on New Year's Day killing at least 32 people and injuring
62 others.  The truck was said to be traveling at about 50 MPH when
a tire blew out and sent the truck into the ditch in the capital
city of Kinshasa.
<P>
Even though this Mass Casualty Incident happened in a city with a
population of six million people, it took emergency services more
than two hours to reach the victims.  Emergency services in Zaire
are said to be normally slow, but they were even more so because
of the holiday.
<P>
Many doctors and emergency medical workers in the capital city 
reportedly have not been paid in months or, in some cases, even
years.  Commuters must often rely upon passenger trucks because
the public transportation system is in shambles.
<P>
<B>Great Britain...</B>
<BR>
A woman went on a rampage in a London JobCentre on Wednesday.  She
reportedly was armed with several knives and screwdrivers and stabbed
four people.  Two of the victims were women with stab wounds to their
heads.  One man suffered a stab wound to his right upper arm.  A
London Ambulance Service spokesman said, "They are all serious."
<P>
Scotland Yard said, "It is believed that a female entered the 
JobCentre with a knife and assaulted a number of people."  The
woman was arrested by police with any apparent incident.  The
motive for the woman's rampage is not known.
<P>
Of the four victims, the worst injured was a man who was found by
police outside of the building with a large carving knife embedded
in his head.  A Metropolitan Police sergeant said that the man was
conscious, calm and talking.  The sergeant said, "The knife looked
like a big carving knife.  It was stuck in the left side of his
head, sticking out at an angle.  The man was calm, but then he
hadn't seen himself."
<P>
The sergeant told what else he saw at the scene, "The woman had
several weapons.  I have seen at least two knives and two screwdrivers
and I understand there may be more.  When we arrived there were lots
of knives and lots of blood.  At first there were not enough
ambulances to deal with the casualties and the crews had to split
up.  Eventually there were three ambulances here."

The Metro-Dade Emergency Operations Center has reported that a
tornado hopscotched across the Dade County suburbs on Wednesday
morning and has injured at least four to six people and damaged
several homes.
<P>

Metro-Dade Police said that a tornado and high winds from a
thunderstorm had caused major damage to at least seven homes
in a suburban area located just south of Miami.  The wind also
reportedly ripped a hole in the roof of a church.
<P>

The National Weather Service said that a line of thunderstorms
stretched across the southern tip of the Florida Peninsula and
had spawned a tornado that had winds ranging rom 75 to 110 MPH.
One forecaster at the NWS said, "Tornadoes are very short-lived
in South Florida, so this whole episode was probably over in
five minutes.  It's not like the Midwest where they come down
and stay on the ground for half an hour and travel for 100 or
150 miles."

At least five people were killed and another 21 were injured when
a bomb exploded in a crowded bazaar in New Delhi on Wednesday.
The blast set three shops on fire and it took firefighters about
one hour to bring the blaze under control.  There was no immediate
claim of responsibility for the bombing.  Sikh separatists are
said to be responsible for major bombings in the city in September
and November.
<P>
<B>Germany...</B>
<BR>
A United States official in Bonn, Germany, said on Tuesday that
U.S. intelligence has received unconfirmed reports that Muslim
extremists may be planning terrorist attacks against United States
and Isreali targets in Germany.  It is said to be unclear of when 
and where the possible attacks may be carried out.  But it is
believed that the terrorists who are planning the attack are in
Germany or are enroute.
<P>
Last Friday, the United States Embassy in Germany did issue a warning
to American citizens to increase their personal security awareness.
There has been no known word from the Embassy or the government of
the State of Isreal.
<P>
<B>Isreal...</B>
<BR>

The security chief of Isreal's famed Shin Bet security service has
told Isreal's Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that
West Bank towns that the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO)
has taken over could become breeding grounds for terrorism against
the State of Isreal.
<P>

The director, who only be identified by the initial "C", said that
the areas in the Gaza Strip and Jericho have already been used as
"launching pads" for terrorist attacks in Isreal.
<P>

"C" said that PLO chief Yassar Arafat has been trying to oppose
members of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist groups in those
areas.  More than 80 suspected terrorists have been arrested for
planning attacks on Isreal.  However, even despite the efforts of
Arafat and the PLO, the terrorists have increased their operational
ability and have no problem, whatsoever, finding volunteers to carry
out suicide attacks.
<P>
Shin Bet is most concerned that towns like Ramallah, which is located
just north of Jerusalem and Qalqiliya, which is near Tel Aviv, will be
used for the planning and implementation of additional terrorist attacks.

<P>
<H2>NYPD DRUG PUSH HAS ADVERSE EFFECT ON SYSTEM...</H2>
By Jim Fay  ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

The much heralded multi-borough NYPD drug enforcement
campaign, called "Operation Juggernaut,"  has caused
immediate problems to a system that was never setup
to handle massive arrest.
<P>

While the Police Department announced plans to
cover all bases in the effort, two other parts
of the NYC criminal justice triangle, the courts
and the District Attorney's offices, are attempting
to make do with the resources they have.
<P>

Finger pointing has begun already, as narcotic teams
in Brooklyn, Queens, and in The Bronx, make large number
of arrest, but continue to process them through a bottle-
neck of bureaucracy that was set up many years ago to
handle the one cop, one collar, type of process.
Arraignments have been delayed well beyond the mandatory
twenty-four hour period, and precinct holding cells are
far passed overcrowded to the point of what one
Sergeant called, "dangerous," when he told of more than
thirty suspects being held in station house holding
cells, and seeing the same people in the cells at 1600
hours one day that were there when he left at 2400 the
night before.  The Sergeant's precinct, one of the busiest
in NYC, usually experiences ten to 15 arrests in a twenty
four hour period.  But from April 1 to April 4, they had
recorded 165 arrest due to the drug push.
<P>

Although the NYPD can, and has, brought personnel from
around the city to effect this effort of numerous
"buy and bust" arrests in the neighborhoods that need
them, the D.A.'s have already stated that their manpower
is low to begin with, and by bringing other Assistant
District Attorneys into the purge, it will definitely
have a ripple effect on ongoing prosecutions.  Assistant
Bureau Chief of the DA's officers are being sent to
the arraignment parts of the courts to move the throng
through the initial stages of making bail or accepting
pleas before a judge.
<P>

NYC has a particularly unusual procedure, in that every
arrest, except for very minor ones, has to be evaluated
by an Assistant District Attorney (ADA) before being brought
before a judge. This procedure on a slow day can cause an
officer to remain on duty 12 to 24 hours above his normal
time of duty, just to process one arrest. On a Saturday morning
it is not unusual to see upwards of 150 police officers lined
up at Manhattan's Criminal Court Building to begin the process of
being seen by an ADA, with one arrest each, ranging from
DWI to murder. This is a far cry from what other officers,
even in major cities, experience.  And since each officer
is usually on overtime with the arrest, it has generated an
in-house term of "collars for dollars."
<P>

The court system has already announced that they will
have to "do with what we got,"  and, with the exception
of transferring four or five Civil Court judges to the
Criminal Courts, and changing a few vacations, has done
very little in anticipation of the arrests.
<P>

All of this is compounded by the expectation that many
of the suspects will opt to go to trial for their offenses,
causing even more confusion, and the need for even more
Grand Jury indictments. Public Defenders will deluge the
court with writs of habeas corpus, if their clients are
not "seen" by a judge within in the twenty four hours
required, ultimately dismissing the charges.
<P>

The problem in NYC is one that has existed for many
years.  The boundaries between police, DA's and the courts
are well defined.  Crossing them even for the sake of
expediency and streamlining an archaic system has met with
disdain on all parts.  Of course, everyone blames everyone
else. The results are that massive arrests of the type
that are needed periodically are caught between what is
needed and what can be accomplished.

<TITLE>Double Bombing/Bank Robbery</TITLE>

<P>

<H2>Double Bombing/Bank Robbery in Spokane, WA</H2>

Police in Spokane, Washington, along with investigators from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United States
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) are investigating
the bombing of a newspaper office and a bank robbery, both of
which, it would appear, by the same two men wearing ski masks.
<P>

The incidents happened on Monday.  No injuries were reported.
At the newspaper office, an employee spotted a man wearing a
ski mask and camouflage clothing leave a suspicious package
outside.  The employee said he opened the door, saw the package
with a lit fuse, and quickly closed the door.  Moments later,
there was an explosion that blew out two doors and several windows.
<P>

Ten minutes after that explosion, about 3 1/2 miles west of the
newspaper office, two masked gunmen entered a bank and ordered
15 people inside to immediately evacuate it.  They took an unknown amount of
cash.  A pipe bomb was left by the men and exploded inside of
the bank.  Again, nobody was injured, but extensive damge occurred
inside the bank. 
<P>

Witnesses reported seeing a white and maroon van at both locations.
A stolen van that fit this description was found by police in a 
parking lot a few blocks away from the bank a short while later.
<P>

At the newspaper office, a one-page, typewritten note was found
where the bomb exploded.  The note reportedly made religious
references and mentioned "Yahweh" which apparently means "God"
in Hebrew.  It has been reported that the term Yahweh has been
used by members of Christian Identity Movement. This movement 
is believed to have connections to white-separatist groups.
<P>

It was noted by at least one Chicago counter-terrorist analyst that bank robbery is 
a common tactic in the furtherance of guerilla movements and has been 
used by any number of "liberationist movements"...or someone who wants the 
police to think that's who committed the crime.

<TITLE>Colorado WildFire Kills 14 Firefighters</TITLE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:1200CDT
<P>
<H3>Wildfire Kills 12 Firefighters, MORE MISSING</H3>
<P>

Glenwood Springs, CO, July 7, 1994 -- A wildfire, that has been burning
since the weekend, flared-up unexpectedly last night and overran
a group of firefighters on Storm King Mountain.  Rescuers report
that at least tweleve (12) firefighters have been found dead and
that two others are missing and feared dead. Identification of
the dead has been difficult due to the deteriorated condition of
some of the burned bodies.  Another four firefighters are being
treated at Valley View Hospital for smoke inhalation and burns.
<P>

Blaming high winds that accelerated the smoldering blaze,
federal fire officials are refusing to comment on the tragedy,
until an investigation has been conducted.  One unnamed official
said that the firefighters had individual fire-resistant
shelters that could be used in a circumstance such as occurred
on Wednesday, but that he didn't know if they were used.
<P> 

Another estimated that the fire was moving at 100 fpm (feet per minute)
at the time of the catastrophe that caused the demise of the
firefighters, and that the speed with which it was moving may
have prevented their escape.  One local rescuer said that two
separate fires had converged on the deceased firefighters and
that they had nowhere to go to escape the advancing flames.
<P>

The conflagration that killed the firefighters reportedly began
on Sunday (July 3) as the result of a lightening strike. It had
been contained to approximately fifty (50) acres until
Wednesday, when high winds began to feed and push the fire to a
size of more than 2,000 acres.  According to eyewitnesses, the
fire had come within 1,500 feet of a subdivision, threatening
many homes.  Homeowners were said to be standing on roofs, using
garden hoses to wet-down their endangered homes.  Additionally,
local firefighters reported that a section of the fire also
jeopardized a local shopping mall, which was evacuated.
<P>

Fire officials say that it appears that the Glenwood Springs
fire has caused the greatest loss of firefighter's lives since a
1937 fire in Yellowstone National park took the lives of 17
firefighters.
<P>
(Ed. Note: A total of fourteen firefighters were killed in the Glenwood 
Springs blaze. A subsequent investigation found problems with safety 
measures and operating directives at the scene.)

<H4> Wildfires Strike the Hamptons</H4>
<P>
Chicago, IL., August 25, 1995 -- Early this morning, something
unusual happened in Brooklyn.  An alarm was reportedly struck on
Box# 500 and at least ten fire engines were dispatched for
mutual aid in Westhampton, Long Island.  Several NYFD senior
chiefs and communications personnel were also sent to assist in
a major firefighting effort that has been described by N.Y. Gov.
George Pataki as being the largest fire of the past fifty (50)
years, in New York State.  An additional five (5) pumpers have
reportedly been sent, within the past hour, from New York City.
<P>
At least forty (40) firefighters have reportedly been injured
while battling the blaze, that has been burning since Thursday.
Their injuries range from minor bumps and bruises to smoke
inhalation and trouble breathing. According to fire officials,
more than 170 firefighting units have been dispatched to the
scene. Concerns have been raised about the safety of more than
1,000 volunteer "structural firefighters" who have been
attempting to control the conflagration.
<P> 
Several say that they are doing everything that they can, but one 
exhausted firefighter told ENN that they do not have the training or
equipment for "wildlands" firefighting and that "city tactics"
don't work in "the bush".  Col. Ed Jacoby, Forest Ranger
Commander, of the New York Forestry service, said that five (5)
fixed wing airplanes will be dropping water this morning in an
attempt to help firefighters to gain an upper hand on the blaze
that has been burning out of control since last night.  Several
state helicopters are also being used for command and control
functions and to drop water on "hot spots".
<P>
President Clinton, who is on vacation in Wyoming, has sent
Federal Emergency Management Agency Chief James D. Witt to the
scene to coordinate the federal response to the situation.  Witt
said that additional resources from Minnesota and Kentucky would
be flown into the area this morning, to assist in the fight. At
least six "strike teams" of elite federal wildland firefighters
were also expected to be sent to the scene.  Gov. Pataki has
declared the location as a disaster area and Pres. Clinton is
said to have authorized federal funding of the firefighting
efforts.
<P>
New York forestry officials have estimated that at least 6,000
acres of land have been burned as of this morning, and that the
fire is still considered "out of control". Speculation as to the
cause of the fire has centered on arson, and a complete
investigation has been ordered. Several areas have been
evacuated, according to police officials, and many very
expensive resort mansions and homes are reportedly still
threatened by the wind-driven fire.
<P> 
Wildfire control experts say that this fire is most unusual for
the New York area and that control of the fire is being hampered
by shifting 35 m.p.h. winds that are pushing it, first in one
direction and then in the next. Additionally, they say that it
naturally takes some time to shift effective "wildfire"
resources from the Mid-West and Western part of the United
States, where these kinds of fires normally occur, to the East
Coast, where they routinely do not operate.
<P>
Local fire officials said that they couldn't give an estimate
when the fire would be contained and declared under control, but
that every possible effort is under way at the time of this
report.

<TITLE>Buenos Aires Bombing -07/19/94</TITLE>

<H3>Moslem Extremists Suspected in Buenos Aires Blast</H3>
<BR>

<P>Chicago, IL, July 19, 1994-  The unthinkable has happened again in Argentina.  For the second time in a little over two years, a skyscraper in Buenos Aires has been totally destroyed by a mysterious explosion.  As in 1992, several groups have claimed responsibility for the massive blast, but no conclusive information has been determined that will provide the actual identity of the assailants.  Both Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Argentinean President Carlos Menem have issued statements that they believe that the attack was carried by "Islamic Extremists", but differing opinions have been offered about what specific group may have committed the atrocity.
<P>

The demolished building is located on Pasteur street near downtown Buenos Aires.  It housed the Mutual Israeli/Argentine Association (AMAI) and the DAIA (Delegation of Argentine/Israeli Associations.  Both groups provide support and services to Jewish people living in Argentina.  Additionally, the building was reportedly used by a group of researchers studying Argentinean government files on Nazi war-criminals that had entered Argentina after World War II.  Buenos Aires is said to have the largest Jewish population of any country in Central or South America.
<P> 
According to official Argentinean statements 26 people have been killed and as many as 150 people were injured by a monstrous blast that engulfed a seven-story building at 9:55 a.m. on Monday (07/18/94).  Several people have been found alive in the rubble in the hours since the detonation.  Rescuers are said to be working diligently to free a man that is trapped by a steel beam, at the time of this report.  He was found late Monday afternoon, as rescuers heard him shouting for help.  Ambulance and Fire Department workers, along with doctors have been working for several hours to free him.  At latest report, consideration is being given to amputating his legs in order to free him.  Three other survivors were successfully freed from entrapment during the nighttime hours, as rescuers frantically dug with shovels and even their bare hands to save those thought to be alive.
<P>
Initial investigations suggest that the explosion was probably caused by a large car or truck bomb, similar to that used in the March 17, 1992, Israeli embassy bombing in Buenos Aires.  The damage to surrounding buildings and vehicles would suggest that it was a tremendous detonation, with flames and flying debris causing damage for several blocks.  Counter-terrorist experts say that pattern of the explosion is consistent with that used by the Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad organizations in the past.  While the analysts say that they  must wait for further chemical tests and confirmation, a Chicago-based analyst says the bombing method would appear to be one that uses fuel-oil or gasoline, a nitrogen based fertilizer, and an oxidizer (Oxygen) or chemical accelerant (Hydrogen).  The simplicity of these devices and easy availability of the chemicals makes them a favorite of terrorists and a constant threat for anti-terrorist forces.
<P>
According to Argentine President Carlos Menem, four people have been detained as they attempted to exit Argentina, shortly after the explosion.  One has been identified as Kabir Balkan, age 33, a Moroccan national who was said to have lived within a mile of the blast site. He had reportedly arrived in the country on July 11, 1994.  An Iraqi man was also arrested at a Northern border checkpoint near Brazi; he has been identified as Adnan Mohammed Yousif, age 31.  Yousif was traveling on an expired passport. Little else is known of Yousif, except that he is in custody.
<P> 
A man of "middle-eastern extraction", maybe Iranian, and a German woman were also believed to have been arrested as they attempted to leave the Ezeiza International Airport in suburban Buenos Aires; few details regarding their true nationalities or visa status are available.  Argentine officials say that all entry and exit points are constantly being monitored for others that might have been involved in the tragic bombing. Train and bus stations are said to be closed and airports closely guarded.
<P>
Although completely denied by Foreign Minister Mahmoud Mohammadi, of the Iranian government, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin placed the blame for the attack firmly on the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militant organization.  According to a London-based report by the Al Hayat newspaper, Hezbollah had been given a "green light" to carry out "an unusual action" against the Israeli government in retaliation for a May 21, 1994 commando abduction of Mustafa Dirani, leader of the pro-Iranian Faithful Islamic Amal Movement in Lebanon.  Additionally, on June 2, 1994, Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) carried out an air-raid on a reported Hezbollah training camp near Baalbeck in Eastern Lebanon.  American and Israeli counter-terrorist experts had expected a Hezbollah reprisal mission, but reportedly didn't expect the attack to be carried out in Argentina.
<P>
Interestingly enough, intelligence sources had reportedly told Al Hayat, last week, that a Hezbollah attack could be expected "in an area other than Lebanon and Syria".  Additionally, the perpetrators were to "take into consideration" recently more friendly ties between Iran and European countries like France and Germany.  Obviously, that left South America as a viable target.  According to the same sources at Al Hayat, Hezbollah has previously made claims that it has an "underground" organization in place, in six different countries, that could carry out terrorist acts "within a very short time".  Experts say that the network must have included at least some contacts in Argentina.
<P>
So, as rescue efforts continue on the shattered streets of Buenos Aires, a world-wide manhunt has begun to find the "smoking gun" that will point to the perpetrators of the catastrophe in Argentina. For without viable damning evidence regarding this dastardly deed,  Argentine leaders may again prove powerless to bring the accused to justice or exact the appropriate measure of revenge against those who would maim and kill the innocent.  Such is the nature of international terrorism today.

<H2>Disgruntled Former Parks Worker Kills 5, Then Himself</H2>
By: Clark Staten
<P>

A former Fort Lauderdale, FL parks and recreation worker, who was fired for alleged drug abuse, returned to his work place this morning and opened fire with a handgun. When the smoke cleared, five of his former co-workers were dead and one was wounded. The gunman then allegedly turned the gun on himself and died at his own hand. At least one other person managed to get away and called 911 to request Ft. Lauderdale police, who arrived within minutes of the shooting. 
<P>
 Police said that they found six bodies inside a trailer used by the beach/park maintenance crews for administrative duties. The trailer is located just off the Intercostal waterway near Ft. Lauderdale beach.  A seventh person, reportedly critically wounded, was taken to Broward County Hospital  where he was immediately taken to surgery to treat his wounds. A local TV station, WTVJ, reported that all of the dead had been shot in the head.
<P>
According to a city worker at the site, the gunman had been fired several months ago, when he tested positive for drugs on a routine drug test.  He was discharged from his employment shortly thereafter. The unidentified worker said that when he was fired that today's perpetrator made threats that he would return and get revenge for his firing, but that no one took him seriously.  Another co-worker made allegations that the shooting may have been  "racially motivated" and that the gunman was "paranoid" about "white people" and "thought they were all out to get him".  Further confirmation of this later statement was not available at the time of this report. 
<P> 
The identities of the gunman and the deceased have not released by Ft. Lauderdale police, pending the notification of next-of-kin. An major crime scene investigation is reportedly underway.

<TITLE>Future Vision of EMS Systems</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
01-92
<P>
                   
 
<H3>A VISION OF TOMMOROW;
<BR>

      PREDICTIONS FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES SYSTEMS
<BR>

                        1992 & BEYOND
<BR>
</H3>
<P>

                    By Clark Staten, EMT-P
<P>


As we begin another year in the final decade of the 20th
Century, an exploration of future possibilities for EMS
systems and personnel comes to mind.  An endless array of
problems and opportunities will undoubtedly arise, and the
maturing EMS professional will be faced with many difficult
and demanding challenges.
<P>

Many new and innovative ideas and products will emerge during
the next few years. Technology can be expected to continue to
advance, both in the practice of prehospital medical care and
in the equipment that is used to perform it.  The public's
expectation of quality and quantity of emergency medical care
is certain to continue to increase.
<P>

In light of this emerging "vision", the following
"predictions" are submitted for the reader's consideration:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1. The "downsizing" that has occured in many businesses and
   some subdivisions of government is certain to strike
   some emergency response agencies.  Although more
   productive than almost all other functions of government,
   Emergency Medical Service systems will need to increase
   efficiency and effectiveness through better planning and
   the use of advanced technologies. Regardless of cuts in
   other city/county agencies, EFFECTIVE EMS agencies are
   unlikely to suffer lay-offs...the public won't allow it.
<P>
<LI>2. Many fire departments, and some police departments will
   attempt to regain control of Emergency Medical Service
   (EMS) functions in their jurisdiction.  Shrinking tax
   bases and ever-vigilant city administrators will force
   previously "untouchable" emergency agencies into proving
   that they are productive.  Many fire departments find
   themselves faced with an ever-decreasing number of actual
   fire suppression responses, while the number of EMS
   responses continues to increase. This effort will be lead
   by labor organizations (i.e.  Firefighter's Unions), as
   well as management experts.
<P>
<LI>3. Tremendous advances in technology will decrease the size
   and weight, and increase the capabilities of much of the
   equipment that we use.  A major leadership effort will be
   undertaken within the next year, by one of the nation's
   largest U.S. EMS agencies, that will have a profound
   affect on the way that emergency service products are
   designed and developed.  Equipment designers and
   manufacturers will begin to participate in "cooperative
   partnerships" that will enhance the capability and
   integration of EMS equipment.  At least one major EMS
   publication will undertake an OBJECTIVE and concise
   product review system, that will report on the viability
   of new technology.
<P>
<LI>4. National equipment standards will be be promulgated and
   proposed that would allow "interoperability" of different
   brands and types of radios, cardiac & respiratory
   monitors, defibrillators, and other diagnostic and
   communication equipment.  As an example, these standards
   will allow system administrators and purchasing agents to
   insure that "X" defibrillator will connect to "Y" monitor,
   and that ECG can be transmitted with "Z" radio by means of
   standardized connectors, cables, and electronic
   interfaces. Various manufacturers will attempt to resist
   the "standard approach", but will be losers at "contract
   time".
<P>
<LI>5. Conversion of voice, data, video and other communications
   signals will be changed to an "all digital" standard.
   Digital signals will allow "interoperability" between the
   various system components and the transfer of various
   kinds of data through a computer controlled ambulance
   environment. This will also allow the computerization and
   effective processing of information and communications,
   eventually leading to "paperless" communication and
   recordkeeping.
<P>
<LI>6. Thrombolytic agents will begin to be used in the field by
   paramedics to treat Myocardial Infarction patients.  12-
   Lead ECGs will be routinely taken to verify the need for
   such intervention.  Early studies will show that the
   earlier the "clot dissolving" drugs are given in the
   course of a heart attack, the better the resulting
   outcome.  Some emergency physicians will resist the
   provision of this treatment, but will be proven wrong as
   the studies of efficiency are provided.
<P>
<LI>7. If economic circumstances continue to worsen, less-
   scrupulous EMS systems may attempt to decrease the
   advanced treatment that is provided "in the field", and
   will order EMT/Paramedic crews to "scoop and run"...even
   when faced with medical emergencies and cardiac events,
   that could well be treated in the prehospital phase of
   care.  This will be done, not due to the ineffectiveness
   of prehospital care, but because hospitals can not charge
   for services that are provided by prehospital personnel.
   Those systems that participate in such an obvious
   degradation of care will be "soundly criticized" by their
   peers and eventually action will be taken to prevent it...
   by health care regulators.
<P>
<LI>8. One of the EMS management "buzzwords" for the 90's will
   be...INTEGRATION.  It will refer to various systems within
   the administrative office environment, within the EMS
   vehicle, and with the equipment used by EMTs and
   Paramedics. More consideration will be given to issues
   like ergonomics, ease of use, value-added cost,
   interoperability, and potential benefit to the patient.
   Computerization of many operations and procedures will
   lead the other associated fields and industries into
   integration of design and implementation.
<P>
<LI>9. In the later part of the decade, serious consideration
   will be given to EMS vehicles that "fly". Traffic
   congestion and "gridlock" in urban areas will necessitate
   an alternative method of timely emergency medical
   response. Long response times in rural areas will prompt
   a similar conclusion.  Various configurations of "STOL"
   (Short Takeoff & Landing) aircraft will be suggested for
   use as air ambulances.  Upgraded engines and propusion
   systems will allow the carrying of potentially large
   payloads, while allowing a wide margin of safety.
   Computerization of flight control and guidance systems
   will make these aircraft as easy to operate as current
   land-based vehicles.
<P>
<LI>10. Earlier in the decade, some EMS system administrators,
    analysts, and providers will begin to utilize P.C.
    (Personal Computer) based communication networks for the
    purposes of sharing news and information, group problem
    solving, data storage/retrieval, research, planning, and
    multi-agency disaster responses.  As individual
    ambulances and providers become linked by this technology
    within local systems, virtual networks can be created
    that will allow almost "automatic linkages" of multiple
    agencies in the event of a mutual aid response or
    disaster.
<P>
<LI>11. By the Mid-1990s, individual EMS providers should be
    "com-linked" by miniaturized, individual radio/cellular
    telephone devices that will function as pagers, voice
    transcievers, data processors, and video display
    terminals.  Public safety employee safety will be greatly
    enhanced by built-in "panic alarms" and position locater
    emitters that will enable emergency dispatch centers to
    immediately send help to any emergency responder that
    needs it.
<P>
<LI>12. Enhanced "911" communications centers will INTEGRATE
    Fire/Police/EMS/Medical/Disaster dispatch and system
    management capabilities under "one roof". This concept
    will allow data and information sharing within the
    various departments, as well as forming a part of the
    nucleus of a potentially global emergency response
    network.  By computer linking of enhanced "911" centers
    in various locations, throughout the nation or world, an
    effective response could be configured to respond to
    almost any kind of natural or man-made emergency.
<P>
<LI>13. By the mid-to late 1990s, a major effort will be
    instituted to cause all Emergency Medical Technicians
    (EMTs) to undertake a minimum of an associate's degree in
    prehospital care education, with paramedics being
    expected to complete a specialized baccalaureate degree.
    EMS supervisors and adminstrators will be expected to
    have completed a Masters degree in a specialized
    prehospital care management program.  This will lead to
    greatly enhanced pay and benefits for EMS personnel and
    advanced recognition as health care providers, within the
    medical community.
<P>
<LI>14. Most Continuing Medical Education (CME) and many entry
    level training programs could be performed in a "virtual
    reality" multi-media, computer/video based environment.
    "Real-life" scenarios and practical applications of
    skills could then be performed in a realistic way without
    danger to rescuers or patients.  These systems, like
    the advanced flight simulators of today, could allow
    emergency personnel to experience sights, sounds, and
    sensations that might be unlikely during their normal
    careers, but could be reproduced for training purposes.
    Artificial intelligence and expert systems could function
    as "teachers" and "mentors" for new emergency care
    students and to evaluate and monitor experienced
    responders.
<P>15. Lastly, computerization and miniaturization of diagnostic
    and laboratory equipment should allow it to be brought to
    the prehospital phase of care.  "Cat-Scan", "Magnetic
    Resonance Imaging" or "Sound-wave" type equipment could
    be brought to the patient's side and used to better
    analyze the patient's condition.  Automatic cardiac,
    respiratory, and brain monitors and probes could analyze
    those functions.  Blood gas and other analysis could well
    be performed by an automated machine, within the
    ambulance, that could allow definitive treatment of
    acid/base disorders, metabolic disorders, oxygen usage
    and other blood-based problems.

    Upon determination of these tests, an "expert computer
    diagnostic" system could analyze the data that had been
    gathered and recommend a course of treatment. Video and
    audio consultation could take place between the
    prehospital provider and a physician if that were deemed
    necessary, and all of the information obtained by the
    emergency medical personnel would be immediately
    available on-line for evaluation.  No patient records
    would need be kept by either the prehospital personnel or
    the receiving hospital; that would be done automatically
    and simultaneously by the computers.

Much of the technology mentioned in these predictions is

<B>**LEAD STORY**</B>
<P>
<H2>GENERAL McCAFFREY LEADS THE BATTLE AGAINST DRUGS...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

Retired 4-star U.S. Army General Barry McCaffrey has fought
for his country around the world.  From Vietnam to Kuwait
and in South America.  But this tough, no-nonsense military
officer who has close-cropped hair may be facing his toughest
assignment ever.  Early last month President Bill Clinton
appointed McCaffrey as the new head of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy.  Now, the 53-year-old general is discovering
a whole new world right here in the United States.
<P>

In the past year, 12 million Americans will have used illegal
drugs.  50 federal agencies and countless state and local law
enforcement departments have been unable to stop the flood of
drugs that continues to come into this country.
<P>

In Vietnam, McCaffrey had to face machine-gun fire.  He raced
across the sands of southern Iraq during the Gulf War.  But
earlier this month, the general was in Chicago visiting Cook
County Jail on Chicago's West Side.  He came to look at 
alternative plans to locking up non-violent drug offenders.
<P>

McCaffrey talked to defendants who were awaiting trial.  They
defendants told him about the program that allows them to spend
up to eight hours a day in drug treatment and in classes.  The
general said that his tour in Chicago was "enormously useful."
<P>

McCaffrey's new job keeps him on the go.  One day he'll be in
Chicago.  The next day, it's back to Washington and from there
it's a trip to Mexico City.
<P>

When the general was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in March.
When the President nominated McCaffrey for the post, nobody
missed the symbolism of having the highly decorated, 4-star
general become the nation's "drug czar."
<P>

Do not speak to McCaffrey about a "drug war."  McCaffrey said,
"The metaphor is inadequate to what we're doing.  We're not
going to run a year- or two-year-long campaign and achieve
total victory."  McCaffrey says that drugs must be approached
like cancer.  Treat the pain and try to kill the disease at
the roots. He also insists that his appointment to a civilian agency is
not an effort to make it more military.
<P>

Above everything else, don't call McCaffrey the "drug czar."
The general barked, "I'm not the drug czar.  I'm just the
quarterback of this effort.  In this country, nobody's in
charge, and we like it that way.  It's not what I do.  We
have to fight drugs as a country."
<P>

When President Clinton named McCaffrey to his new post, he
vowed to give the general the tools he needed to wage battle
on the drug problem in the United States.  One of the first
things McCaffey said was that the U.S. cannot "arrest our way"
out of the drug problem that is gripping the country.
<P>

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg officiated over the
ceremony that installed McCaffrey into his new post.  Ginsburg
called the 1964 graduate of West Point a "clear thinking man of
action."
<P>

Last month, after taking office, McCaffrey said, "I'm going to
be a coordinator, an energizer, a manager, a watchdog.  I'm going
to be focused and serious about this."  The general warned, "We
will not arrest our way out of the drug challenge ...law enforcement
officials of America are hopefully going to have our complete
support but there has got to be more than that.  This problem isn't
going to be solved by the federal government.  The people who are
going to pull this together are school teachers, are religious
leaders, are families, are coaches, police officers, that's who's
going to do it."
<P>

The President thanked McCaffrey for taking the job and "accepting
this call to lead our nation's battle against drugs."  The President
also said, "Drugs are as much a threat to our security as any
outside enemy is today.  They are the leading cause of crime and
violence."  "I want you to have the tools you need," the President
told McCaffrey.
<P>

Clinton also said, "Our national security, the well-being of our
children are at stake.  We can create a safer, more drug-free
society.  We can do this if we work together."
<P>

It's hard to imagine anyone better qualified than McCaffrey
for his postition.  He had to retire from the Army, where he
served for 31 years.  McCaffrey was decorated for valor in
combat during the Vietnam War.  In the 1991 Gulf War, he led
the 4th Infantry Division.  The last two years he was the chief
of the U.S. Southern Command that is based in Panama.  He directed
all U.S. troops in Latin America.  The U.S. Southern Command has
been heavily involved in interdicting drugs and helping countries
in Central and South America block their own production and
transportation of drugs.
<P>

The general said that leaving the military after 31 years of
service was "very painful."  But, he said, his new job "is
fundamentally the protection of the American people.  So, in
that sense, it won't be different from what I've been doing the
last 31 years."
<P>

Speaking about what can be done about the drug problem, McCaffrey
reiterated, "This is not a war that's going to be won by anybody's
military."  He said that the effort will require attacks from all
sides.  This includes treatment for drug addicts, efforts to keep
children away from drugs and continued support of law enforcement.
<P>

McCaffrey does know, first hand, what drugs can do to people.  He
said, "The U.S. Army that I was a part of and so loved was almost
destroyed by alcohol abuse and illegal drugs in the 70's.  Up to
two-thirds of our battalion were using drugs all the time or some
of the time, and the impact on our discipline, on rape, violence,
spiritual loss of focus, physical health was just atrocious."
<P>

It does seem that Barry McCaffrey is the right man for the job.
It has taken a military man to tell everyone that the country
cannot wage a "war" on drugs.  Hopefully, he can install some
programs that work and place the focus of how to deal with the
problem in the right direction.  The thing is -- if McCaffrey
can't succeed ... who in the world ever will?

<H2>AFTER MONTH IN COMA, NYC*EMS SUPERVISOR
WALKS FROM HOSPITAL</H2>
By Jim Fay  ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

On November 12th of last year (1995),  NYC*EMS Deputy Chief Michael Rice
was responding to a report of a fire on board an incoming aircraft to
JFK International Airport, in Jamaica, Queens, NYC.  Rice, 43, became
a victim of a serious one car accident on the Cross Island Parkway,
having skidded on very wet pavement, which was being whipped by high
winds.  He spent one month in a coma in Jamaica Hospital's Tramautic
Brain Injury Unit, and then stayed in the hospital for three additional months.
Yesterday, Chief Rice walked from the hospital, greeted by his collegue,
Chief Andy McCrakin, who happened upon Rice's accident while enroute
to the same incident.
<P>

Rice echoed the praise the doctors had for his pre-hospital treatment that
was given to him at the scene of the accident by paramedics of NYC*EMS.
"They gave me a second chance at life," said Rice.  Rice, a 24-year
veteran of EMS, will continue with much needed therapy.
<P>
(ENN Ed. Note: The story of Rice's accident and injuries is available elsewhere on the ERRI website. <A HREF="/ems_rice.htm"> <B>Click here to see the original story</B></A>  It's extremely nice to hear about a happy ending to what could have been a very tragic story. Our hopes and prayers go out to Chief Rice and his family for a full and speedy recovery)

<H3>Ferry Sinks; More than 850 Feared Dead</H3>
<BR>
Chicago, IL, (ENN) September 29, 1994 -- With hope fading with each passing
hour, families all over Sweden, Estonia, and Finland are
anxiously awaiting the fate of relatives that were known to be
traveling on the ES Estonia.  The ferry, traveling between
Estonia and Sweden, inexplicably sank Tuesday at 1:24a.m.(local
time).  According to the Estonia Foreign Ministry, 1,049 people
were onboard the ship as it capsized in 6-foot waves. Finnish
rescue services have reported that  844 people are still
missing, and that about 140 have been saved from the frigid
waters of the Baltic Sea. The bodies of 42 people are said to
have been recovered by rescue forces.  The ship went down,
reportedly within 40 minutes, in an area approximately 25 miles
from the Southwest coast of Finland.
<P>


In what is being described by Swedish authorities as "the
greatest catastrophe for Sweden in modern times", the sinking of
the Estonia has roused an intensive investigation into the
disaster.  Speculation regarding the cause of the tragic
incident has centered on the possibility of "faulty" seals on a
large ramp that is used to on and off-load cars and people from
the ship.  A crewman and another eyewitness have both been
quoted by various media sources as saying that water was seen
coming in through the bow door of the ship. The crewman was
quoted by the Cable News Network (CNN) as saying that he was
standing in water "up to his knees" at the time the ship
capsized.
<P>


Representatives of the Estline Company, which operated the
Estonia, were quoted by local media services as saying that the
vessel sank after it's engines shut-down and it was swept by a
"60 foot wave [20 meters]".  Weather experts say that the
allegation about a sixty foot wave was extremely unlikely, due
to the fact that several other ships were in the area and they
reported "6 foot [2 meter] waves in the area" with winds at
15mph.  Ostensibly, after the wave struck, the ships cargo area
filled with water and began to list.  Shortly thereafter,
according to survivors, the ship capsized.
<P>


According to two Swedish safety inspectors, the seals on the
ship's cargo doors "didn't look good" when inspected shortly
before the calamity.  Ake Sjoblom, one of the inspectors, was
quoted by a Swedish radio station as saying that the Estonia's
crew was notified of the deficiencies, but that the visit that
their visit was "only for training" and that it wasn't "a proper
inspection".  He also said that the seals 'didn't look bad
enough to hold the boat back." 
<P> 


Finnish authorities said that the incident occurred in Finnish
waters and that it is their responsibility to conduct a complete
and thorough investigation of the accident.  They said that they
would not comment on the actual cause of the deadly tragedy
until the completion of the official inquiry.  The spokesperson
refused to speculate regarding any details of the disaster.
<P>


Rescuers have been frantically searching the area of the
shipwreck for more than 48 hours.  They say that they have been
hampered by high winds and heavy seas, almost since they started
the search.  Several other ships, in the area, have reported
plucking victims from the icy waters and turning them over to
Finnish Coast Guard helicopters for transport to local
hospitals.  A massive rescue effort has reportedly been mounted
by Sweden, Finland, and Estonia, with helicopters and patrol
boats working 24 hours a day in an attempt to save victims in
the 50 degree water.
<P>


Rescuers and doctors say, however, that they fear that the time
has elapsed that would have allowed them to successfully
resuscitate those thrown into the cold water.  They say that the
stricken will have died of hypothermia and exposure by the time
of this report.  A Coast Guard official said that the human body
loses heat quickly when immersed in cold water, and that they
have already recovered the bodies of "dozens" of victims who
have succumbed to the cold.  A Finnish Helicopter rescue pilot
reported flying more than 10 hours and not finding anyone alive;
his crew did recover the bodies of twenty (20) of the Estonia's
deceased.
<P>


Doctors treating the few survivors of the Estonia disaster say
that it is a "miracle" that anyone survived the incident and
subsequent immersion in the chilly water.  Those that did
survive may have done so by huddling together, in life rafts
that were thrown from the ship, as it was going down.  A trauma
physician from Turku University Hospital said that all of the
victims that were brought to his facility were suffering from
hypothermia, but that several of them are doing 'extremely
well", considering the circumstances.  According to one doctor,
several of the patients may be released from the hospital soon,
with few medical complications.  A hospital psychologist said,
however, that virtually all of the survivors will suffer from
some form of emotional distress surrounding the incident.
<P>


Survivors of mass disasters are frequently known to suffer from
effects similar to those experienced by soldiers in combat,
resulting in what is commonly called a "Post Traumatic Stress
Syndrome". Some will undoubtedly require counseling and
emotional support following their ordeal in the Baltic's icy
waters.  Others will even feel guilty that they couldn't help
the dead, or do anything meaningful to affect the outcome of the
calamity.  All in all; everyone connected with the tragedy at
sea will suffer some detrimental effect caused by the sinking of
the Estonia.  Now, as questions are being asked about the cause
of the disaster, families, friends, rescuers and victims will
begin the grieving process.

<font size=6><strong>FireWorks Incident Turns Deadly In Ohio</strong></font>
<P>

Chicago, IL, July 3, 1996 (ENN) --What is being described as an &quot;act of extreme stupidity&quot; that may have started out as a &quot;prank&quot; has apparently turned deadly today in Scottown, Ohio. Eight people are reported dead and another twelve injured, including at least two small children.
Three people are still reported in critical condition, with
smoke inhalation and burns, at nearby Cabell Huntington
Hospital, according to a hospital spokesperson.
<p>
Lawrence County Sheriff Roy Smith, says that he believes that
the tragedy in the fireworks store was the work of three
men in their early 20's, who allegedly lit a fire in a box of fireworks in the
back of Ohio River Fireworks building. The three youths, who
have not been identified or charged, are reportedly in custody
at the Lawrence County jail.
<P>

Most of the bodies of the victims were reportedly found near the
front door of the retail fireworks store. Fire and police
investigators hypothesized that they were killed in a &quot;stampede&quot;
as they all scrambled to exit the building, with multiple
explosions going off. 
<P>

Fire department sources said that the fire took almost three 
hours to bring under control and that there may still be bodies 
inside. They say that after initial extinguishment that they 
were waiting for the interior to cool off before a more 
extensive search could be undertaken. The entire incident 
remains under investigation by Sheriff's deputies and fire/arson 
personnel.

By Steve Macko
<P>

The State of Texas is being ravaged by several very serious wildfires.
On Wednesday, at least seven large brushfires raged across the state.
Mahlon Hammetter, a fire prevention specialist with the Texas Forest
Service said, "The state is burning up.  We've got seven major fires
that we have on our board, and there are undoubtedly more that we don't
know about.  This is the worst year that I can remember."
<P>

Texas has had very little rain of late and temperatures in much of the
state reached close to 100 degrees (F) on Wednesday.
<P>

A 150-man unit from the Texas Forest Service joined U.S. Forest
Service units and teams from four other states to battle a forest
fire in the Upland Island National Wilderness Area, located in
Angelina County.  This blaze has grown to 2,500 acres.
<P>

At four homes were destroyed on Wednesday afternoon by a large
grass fire in northeast Tarrant County.  At least 15 structures
were destroyed by fire in Denton County.
<P>

The Houston area has been very busy battling brushfires all month.
Officials said that non-stop calls are beginning to take their toll
on fire personnel.  Since February 1st, the Houston Fire Department
has fought 476 grass fires.  In all of 1995, they battled 1,100
similar fires. In suburban Houston, Harris County, firefighters handled 86 fires in
a 24 hour period on Tuesday.
<P>

Hammetter said that most of the fires have been caused by carelessness,
but arson is being suspected in several others.  Hammetter said, "If
we could get the accidental fires stopped that would leave that many
more units to fight the arson fires."
<P>

The Texas Forest Service fire protection unit is headquartered in
Lufkin.  The unit tracks many brushfires and dispatches personnel
and equipment to the scene of the fires.
<P>

But the above blazes were nothing compared to the 25,000-acre
fire that has destroyed numerous homes and trailers near the
small town of Poolville.  Poolville is located about 35 miles
northwest of Fort Worth.  16 firefighters and two civilians have
been injured in this fire.  As of Thursday morning, the fire was
still said to be 40 percent contained.
<P>

The sheriff of Parker County said, "We're not talking acres, we're
talking miles.  We've lost houses.  We've lost trailers.  We've
lost barns.  We've lost deer camps."  At least 57 homes and 12
trailer homes have been reported destroyed in the Poolville blaze
that is about 40 square miles in size.

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>Terrorism in a New World--Evolution in Revolution</strong></font><br>
By: Michael Wilson [5514706@mcimail.com] The Nemesis Group<br>

<p align=left><br>
In a time when a greater peace appears to be breaking out, smaller conflicts appear to be on the upswing. There are two 
major causes for this--the death of the superpowers and the stability they brought, and a severe reduction in the minimum 
means necessary to engage in conflict. The preferred method? Terror.<br>
<br>
Terrorism has been correctly identified as being media driven. In its guerrilla warfare form, terrorism is intended to bring 
attention to a conflict when the media is perceived to be controlled by the opposition or when it has no wish to cover the 
conflict otherwise. Organizations such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (RA) or the Palestinian Intifada fall into this 
category--RA against British rule and control of the media, the Intifada against Israeli occupation, with a media bias in 
favor of Israel. <br>
<br>
Other terrorism is for the purpose of distraction, slight of hand, or revenge. Syria, Iraq, and Iran, following their belief that 
the ability to destroy is the ability to control, have used terror acts to control the Palestinian peace process terms and 
timing; the Syrian-backed Al Saiqa attack in Austria just prior to the October War distracted Israel from the impending 
threat; and attacks such as Black September's Munich Olympic operation, were purely reprisal.<br>
<br>
Over time, terrorism has changed its form. The first generation of 'modern' terrorism, post-World War II, was based on a 
theory of attrition, a strategy of exhaustion. Target profiles were 'no retreat,' such as airplane hijackings and Embassy 
takeovers. Counter-terror tactics caught up at Entebbe, showing that police methods and commando strikes worked 
against this threat. <br>
<br>
Second generation terrorist attacks stemmed from a reactive evolution and focused on a strategy of recognition, almost a 
coercive propaganda. These methods were adopted, in different forms, by the IRA and Palestinian groups. 'No contact' 
targets were adopted, primarily through the use of explosive devices. Attack on this strategy was made by criminalizing the 
action, with complete removal of the political context in media coverage of the event or group carrying out the operation.<br>
<br>
The next step in terrorism, which is happening now, applies technology to overcome these problems. While nations' military 
and intelligence services re-tool themselves to deal with the fall of the Eastern bloc and worry about nuclear proliferation, a 
different genie has come out of the bottle, one that can't be put back in, and for which there is no infrastructural control 
possible.<br>
<br>
Communications technology has revolutionized the way the average man lives, works, thinks, and plays. The popularization 
of this technological infrastructure will provide a ready tool for the future terrorist--a global arena and a way to leverage 
limited resource. Soon to be gone (in most parts of the world) will be the cut-outs, drops, forwards and other elements of 
tradecraft in the Cold War period.<br>
<br>
The telephone system, with its anonymous payphones, reprogrammed cellular phones that allow one to roam, facsimile 
machines, alphanumeric pagers, and voicemail are only the beginning. In and of themselves, they can act as a digital 
replacement for most items of tradecraft, but they provide even better services. They also allow computer networks, 
private and public, with numerous anonymous entrypoints, to move information around without worry; information as 
simple as a scanned image altered in a creative fashion to be distributed, laser printed, copied, and distributed for 
propaganda purposes; or information as potent as a continuing evolutionary design of explosive devices. Distribution 
through the electronic mail, mailing lists, anonymous remailers, newsgroups, or whatever, can now act as a 'community 
memory,' keeping all parties informed of all evolution in tactic, technique, and technology.<br>
<br>
Digital cryptography for the masses has provided another powerful tool. Messages can be secured using public-key 
cryptographic technology, among other methods, for authenticated distribution--internal to a 'virtual organization' for things 
such as operational plans, or external, to media organizations to provide propaganda statements to negate counter-terror 
efforts to 'close the lid' on issues. Even this technology is rapidly evolving and will provide even greater capabilities--voice 
encryption using a normal computer, providing security and authentication for dynamic, real-time communication; the ability 
to disguise secure information as signal 'noise' inside of other data, innocuous or not, such as the large pornographic 
sub-culture on the public computer networks. <br>
<br>
This technology is being given away free to any who want it, even making the 'source code' available, to allow the user to 
be certain it isn't gimmicked; this allows a more sophisticated user to make alterations, or use certain techniques for other 
purposes (such as the creation of a cryptographic computer virus, which infect a system and encrypt data with a public key 
technique for blackmail purposes, since capturing the virus doesn't provide a mechanism for retrieving the data). Rising 
interest in such technology have also made available the cryptanalysis resources for attacking such systems, which secure 
personal, corporate, and government computers world-wide.<br>
<br>
Technology is making direct alterations in the way every organization operates; terrorist groups, or for that matter, any 
organization with the wherewithal to, can drop the hierarchical or 'cell' structure that is out of date. Such structures, other 
than being inefficient, have also become negated through contract tracing, traffic analysis, or 'gateway' style checkpoints on 
members which make the entire organization vulnerable. Heterarchies, with localized independent action are the next wave, 
with authority being roll-based and functional, and structures only being one level deep, allowing direct control or 
supervision but providing complete isolation from the other elements of the network.<br>
<br>
Recruiting is effected--members who are voluntarists can be thoroughly investigated before trust is given. Collateral 
networks can be established as never before--vulnerable elements on the computer networks such as women or 
homosexuals can be exploited; tracing back dependent behavior such as drugs, sexual, or other deviant behavior can 
provide blackmail leverage; mules can be recruited among the population who are still legal 'minors.' Legends, cover 
stories, for members of the organization can be made quite thorough and backdated.<br>
<br>
Funding for the organization can come from industrial espionage, which requires essentially the same virtual infrastructure, 
computer crime, or blackmail. The needs of the organization won't be extreme, however, as the technology provides 
leverage, and the infrastructural costs are practically negligible, carried mainly by the legitimate use by the populous at 
large.<br>
<br>
Operations gain considerably, and intelligence and research, the backbone of any organization, profit most; targets can be 
isolated and an in-depth background brief and schedule developed through penetration of computers and communications 
(including contact tracing, purchasing habits, travel, etc.), and all in a fashion that doesn't alert the target or any security 
protection they may have. Training, planning, and debriefing can benefit from virtual walk-throughs, models of anything 
important to the operation built entirely in advance, which can be used together by team members who need never meet to 
use them, working over secured networks. Post operation 'spin control' can benefit from massive monitoring of media 
channels and real-time propaganda or manipulation. Operations may even become fully digital--information warfare attacks 
are highly leveraged, low cost, can be done at any distance, take whatever time needed yet be synchronized, have 
complete surprise, and move faster than the opposition can respond to.<br>
<br>
There is very little in the world of intelligence that is not now available to most anyone with technology and the will. More 
so than any 'dual use' technology, computers and communications are an equalizer, in a world where whomever makes the 
first move, wins.</p>

<TITLE>Iraqi Withdrawal Turns to Rout</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 02-27-91  1400 HRS. CST
<BR>
<H3>IRAQI WITHDRAWAL TURNS INTO A "ROUT"</H3>
<BR>
Chicago, IL.  With reports of major successes across the
theatre, Gen. "Stormin" Norman Schwarzkoph describes the
outcome of the Kuwaiti liberation a "rout".  According to
Coalition Central Command personnel, The U.S. Army VIIth Corp
has reportedly engaged the retreating Iraqi forces on a
twenty (20) miles front.  According to official military
sources, at least two "Republican Guard" Divisions have been
decimated and are ineffective.  They were said to have been
badly defeated by the U.S. 3rd Armored Division, the 1st
Infantry Division and the 101st Airborne Division
(Airmobile).
<P>

The 82nd Airborne and Coaliton forces have reported that they
are "in control" of Kuwait City.  Reportedly led by Kuwaiti
and Saudi Arabian troops, with support from airborne assault
"shock" troops, a large forces is said to be assuming
authority for a large portion of the territory surrounding
the Northweatern part of Kuwait.  Linkage with the 1st and
2nd Marine Division (Task Force Ripper) was achieved
yesterday and the combined force "rolled" into Kuwait City.
Many Kuwaiti troops are said to be celebrating with the
civilians that have come out of hiding.
<P>

The exiled Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-
Sabah, is said to be moving to re-establish civilian control
of the area by announcing "Martial Law".  Ahmed is reported
to have appointed members of the "Kuwaiti Resistance" as
"peace keepers" until complete control of the city can be
achieved. Reports of the capture of "hundreds" of "Iraqi
collaborators and soldiers" are coming into custody of
military police squads, which are responsible for assuming
custody of non-Kuwaitis.
<P>

Several hundred U.S. civil affairs specialists are said to be
coming into to Kuwait City to assist the Emir and civil
authorities in beginning the reconstruction of key
communications, command and control, and airport services.
estimates of more than $100 Billion dollars in re-
construction needs are being reported.  The  U.S. Army Corp
of Engineers is said to promised at least $24 Billion dollars
in re-contruction projects, by the Kuwaiti government.
<P>

As the Army of Saddam Hussein retreats into Iraqi, many
logisitical and organizational questions are being raised in
regard to the newly "liberated" country.  New ideas of
democracy for Kuwaiti citizens are being asked, although
discounted under the Emir and his family in the past;  State
Department officials have indicated a willingness on the part
of the al-Sabah family to "liberalize" the Kingdom and allow
even greater freedom and rights to their subjects.  It should
be noted that in the past, free education, housing and
healthcare were extended to all Kuwaitis.  The task at hand
remains one of gaining civil control of the country and
beginning it's reconstruction, following the Iraqi
devastation.

<TITLE>Oakland Fire, Two Days of Hell--01/92 </TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
1400 CDT-01/12/92   Immediate release - Non exclusive
<BR>
<H2>"TWO DAYS of HELL" in Alemeda County, CA.</H2>

Alemeda Co., CA.  With "exploding trees" and entire
neighborhoods on fire, a major brush fire burned out of
control overnight in the vicinity of Oakland CA.
Firefighters from more than 50 departments were unable to
extinguish the blaze on Sunday, due to high winds and
unusually warm October heat that has turned the already dry
scrub brush on the surrounding hills into "fireballs" that
crackled, popped, and roared as they consumed more than 200
Alemeda County homes.
<P>

Several exhausted rural and mutual aid firefighters
complained of the fact that their suction connections would
not fit the water hydrants in the Oakland area.  Many stood
by, frustrated, awaiting the arrival of adapters that would
allow them to "go to work" on the fire. Oakland Mayor Elihu
Harris was heard to comment that the fire was "out of
control".  Fire Chiefs from several communities, city fire
officers, and state officals were meeting constantly to map a
strategy that would allow them to stop the fire at various
points.  Each "battleline" was drawn, and each one was
overjumped by the wind-whipped brands of burning debris.
<P>

A single-family dwelling near Oakland was the site of the
deaths of a family of five people, who died while trying to
escape the flames. Neighbors said that they had stayed in
their home in an attempt to salvage their belongings when the
entire neighborhood "lit up" in a burst of fire described as
"Hell on Earth" by one bystander. 
<P>

At least one firefighter was reported killed during a rescue 
attempt, and dozens more were transported to several area 
hospitals for treatment of heat exhaustion and smoke inhalation.  
According to a reputable West coast firefighting source another firefighter
is listed as missing ( at the time of this report) and at
least one police officer has been reportedly killed by the
blaze.  According to one hospital spokesman, as many as 200
people have been transported to area hospitals.
<P>

Fire Service experts have recounted that the weather has been
a major detriment to the firefighting effort. First, on
Sunday, high winds prevented the California and Federal
Forestry Service aerial tankers from dropping water on the
"hotspots", and on Sunday Night and Monday morning a deep
blanket of fog enveloped the area.  Ground visability in the
areas of greatest need was reduced to almost zero. Due to a
large number of high voltage power lines and radio towers in
the vicinity, airplanes have had great difficulty in low
level flight and hitting their targets on the ground.
<P>

Also mentioned as a major problem concerning the inability of
extinguishing the blaze, was a poor water supply in an area
that has suffered almost five (5) years of drought.
Reports, early on Monday morning, indicate that two Southern
and Eastern "legs" of a triangular shaped fire are still
burning out of control and that firefighters may be gaining
an upper hand on the Northernly most "leg" of the still
spreading inferno. A firefighter, who asked to remain
unidentified, was quoted as saying, "Unless the tankers fly,
we will lose several more neighborhood to this blaze....it is
truly the worst fire I have ever seen".
<P>

Additional firefighting and emergency medical services (EMS)
resources are reportedly being dispatched from all over the
state of California to the fire, in an attempt to bring it
under control before it engulfs several additional
neighborhoods. California Governor Pete Wilson was reported
to have flown over the fire and declared it a State Disaster
Area. Members of the California National Guard were placed on
stand-by to prevent looting and to asist in the non-technical
aspects of firefighting.
<P>

One veteran firefighter, covered with sweat and grime,
summed up the feelings of many emergency workers at the
scene, "If we catch a break on the weather and the winds stay
down...we could make some real progress on this one by
tommorow morning...if not... a lot of people are going to
lose their property and maybe their lives".

Media Release -03/29/96-14:00CST</H3>
<P>
Good afternoon, this is District Fire Chief Mike Kroeger, Cincinnati Fire Division, reporting on at 5 alarm fire at 2501 to 2508 Washington Circle in the Williamsburg Apartments on Gaibraith Rd.. It is Friday, 03/29/96, at 2:00 PM.
<P> 

Cincinnati Fire Companies responded to a building fire in the Witliamsburg complex at 10:24 AM with the first unit arriving at 10:31 AM. The first arriving company found heavy fire in the first floor rear of a two story, 8 family, wood frame, multi-dwelling wth an approximate floor area of 150 X75' The fire was rapidly spreading vertically into the second floor and attic. The fire building had a wood trussed roof that was open without fire walls the entire length of the building To make matters worse, the fire had started at one end of the structure and the wind direction was blowing the fire towards the uninvolved portions of the building.
<P>

Cincinnati Fire Fighters were able to stop the progress of the fire through the exposed attic area by an extremely aggressive interior attack. Their highly aggressive and professional fire fighting actions saved the entire uninvolved half of the building The fight was not without cost to fire fighters, however.
<P>

 A total of 3 firefighters were taken to University Hospital:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>FF Larry Taylor, of 1-12, 44 years, for exhaustion to University Hospital

<H4>THE FOLLOWING IS A REPRINT FROM THE
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE CHIEFS NEWSLETTER
"ON SCENE"</H4>
<P>


<H3>CITIES AND FIRE AGENCIES TRIUMPH IN CALIFORNIA!
</H3>
By Gary G. Ludwig, MS, EMT-P
<P>

Its official!  Several months ago I wrote about the major California
fire victory that will establish case law on EMS for California.  The 
appellate court decision indicated cities and fire agencies are 
entitled to control EMS if they provided any level of EMS on 
June 1, 1980 and had not entered into a written agreement with the
county.  In essence, fire agencies can begin fire-based EMS 
transport programs if they desire without interference from the 
counties who were generally seen as in bed with commercial 
providers and the California Ambulance Association.  At the time of
my writing, the decision was tentative.  Now, the final decision has 
come in and some legal experts believe the opinion of the judges 
contains even stronger language supporting the cities and fire 
agencies.
<P>

In my opinion, was of the reasons for this victory was because of the
strong networking system among the fire agencies throughout California.  
It is not uncommon for fax machines to run non-stop with information 
flowing back and forth when important EMS issues are on the table -
something fire agencies within other states should start looking toward.
<P>

In an unprecedented action, the IAFC and the IAFF have joined hands 
in a combined effort to assist a well known and respected fire department 
with their proposal to city officials to improve service levels in their 
community by assuming the transport role of EMS.  More on this in the 
future!
<P>

The Charlotte Fire Department (NC) recently made a proposal to improve
the level of service in their community by merging Mecklenburg County 
EMS into the department as a separate bureau.  At the center of the 
issue are financial problems and delayed responses times by 
Mecklenburg EMS.  Battalion Chief Jim Burke tells me the proposal 
calls for training EMS paramedics on a voluntary basis to also be 
firefighters.
<P>  

These medics would be placed on all front-line apparatus 
to produce a heavy front-load ALS within four minutes of critical calls.  
Conversely, firefighters could volunteer to be trained as paramedics 
and would be available to work on ambulances.  Those individuals not 
wishing to be cross-trained would still be secured in their jobs since the 
proposal calls for no lay-offs.  Ambulances would be placed in existing 
engine houses and ambulance stations would be closed to save on 
finances.  Another economic saving would occur when the two 
communication centers would be merged while streamlining efficiency.  
This program would augment the existing first responder program where 
CFD will shortly advance from AEDs on twelve pieces of equipment to all 
43 front line vehicles.  Chief Burke can be reached at 704-525-5442.
<P>

AMR had a fourth quarter one-time, non-recurring restructuring charge of
$23 million as they incurred severance costs, fixed asset disposals, and 
lease termination costs.  Following this restructuring will be a break up 
of AMR's operations into six regional units in 1996.
<P>

This month we profile EMS Section member Chief Tom Girard from Salina,
Kansas.  Chief Girard has been with the department since 1966, serving as
Chief since 1988.  SFD assumed EMS transport in 1983 from a 3rd service 
county operation.  SFD has a total staff of 87 personnel (18 paramedics), 
four stations, housing four BLS engines, three ambulances, and one ALS 
quint.
<P>

Besides being the total ALS provider, Chief Girard has one full time
teacher on staff who is dedicated strictly to public education.  
Visiting some 5,000 students annually from preschool through the 
sixth grade, the teacher not only stresses fire safety and prevention, 
but broader issues of life safety and injury prevention.  SFD has a 
"Welcome to Our Town" program.  Names of new residents are 
obtained from a local greeter service.  These new residents are then 
visited by the first-due engine company who welcomes them and 
advises them all of the services available from SFD.  In my opinion, 
a great marketing tool.  Chief Girard can be reached at (913)826-7340.

<TITLE>NYC Dept. Store Struck by Firebombs</TITLE>

<H3>INCENDIARY DEVICES IGNITE IN MACY'S</H3>
By Jim Fay,  ENN NYC/NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>
Retailers in NYC are more vigilant during the holiday season. But
this year, it is not just for shoplifters and pickpockets.
<P>
On the heels of the W. 125 St. Massacre in Harlem, in which eight
people were killed in a shooting incident and fire set in a clothing
store,  NYC Fire and Police Departments responded to a fire in the
jewelry department of the R. H. Macy's located in a Queens, NYC,
shopping mall.
<P>
At approximately 1545 hrs., EST, the FDNY reported an "All Hands"
fire in the store, located at Queens Blvd. and 90th Street. While operating
at this fire, three other incendiary devices went off, causing small fires
in the jewelry section, where firefighters were working.  NYPD precinct patrol supervisors on the scene immediately called for Emergency Service Units and the NYPD Bomb Squad to respond, in anticipation of additional devices and explosions.
<P>
Upon the extinguishment of the initial fires, the FDNY 5th Division
Deputy Chief, at the scene, ordered a primary search of the immediate
area for possible additional devices. Finding none, the chief ordered all
shoppers, as well as all firefighters, out of the large department store and the entire shopping mall area. Queens Blvd., where the incident occurred,  is a main shopping strip in a middle class and upper-middle class section of the Borough of Queens.  Traffic conditions were substantially worsened by the arrival of the numerous emergency servcie units.
<P>
Upon arrival of the NYPD Emergency Units and Bomb Squad, a more
intensive search was done by bomb sniffing dogs and appropriately
equipped Police personnel of the first floor, where the explosions first
occurred. The search then continued as well in the rest of the three-story complex. It was discovered that the devices were battery-controlled, timed devices, hidden in shelving  and under counters. Fire damage was minimal, and the smoke conditions caused little panic in the Christmas shoppers.
<P>
NYPD Chief of Department Louis Anemone indicated that the store had
received threatening phone calls at about 1100 hrs., EST., from a
"disgruntled customer," who indicated that he attempted to return an item,
and was refused.  Because of that, the caller said he would set bombs in
the store.
<P>
No injuries to customers, firefighters or police were reported. A
representative of Macy's had nothing to say except that the store would
remain closed for the remainder of the day to assist police and FDNY
Fire Marshals in the investigation.

<H2>HORROR IN SCOTLAND...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

Sixteen small children and one teacher were shot and killed inside
of a school gymnasium by a lone gunman in Dunblane, Scotland, on
Wednesday morning at about 0930 GMT.  After committing the senseless 
murders, the gunman was reportedly killed by turning the gun on 
himself.  All of the children were said to be in what is called 
kindergarten in the U.S. and were, for the most part, aged five and 
six years.
<P>

Twelve other children were reported wounded in the attack at the
school in a village of 7,300 people, located about 40 miles from
Edinburgh.  Several of the victims were air transported to a hospital 
located about five miles from the scene.  Hospitals in Glasgow and
Edinburgh were put on alert.  More than a dozen ambulances were
sent to the scene of the shooting.
<P>

At least two wounded children were airlifted to a hospital in
Glasgow, Scotland.  One of the victims was reported to be shot
in the chest and was in critical condition.
<P>

The gunman was identified as 43-year-old Thomas Hamilton.  Chief
Constable William Wilson said that Hamilton was armed with four
handguns and at about 0930 GMT burst through the front entrance
of the school.  He went down a passageway, past the school's
dining room and went into the gym, where the school's smallest
children were having a class.
<P>

The motive for today's mass murder is not known. Incidents such as what happened today are rare in Great Britain because guns are more difficult to obtain than in the United States.
This was said to be Britain's worst shooting since August of 1987
when a 27-year-old man shot sixteen people and then himself in
Hungerford, England.

<H2>"Gone With the Wind" Author's House Destroyed by Arson??</H2>
By: Bill Delmar
<P>

This is an unofficial report of two fires on 5/12/96. While neither was more than a single alarm, I thought they might be of interest.
<P>

At 04:59 AM, Atlanta FD was dispatched to a fire at 1069 McMillian St, near Roslyn St, with report of entrapment. They found a one story frame house well involved in the front. There were four people from house, who had been helped outside by a police officer. All five were transported for smoke inhalation.
<P>

At 05:19 AM, Atlanta FD was dispatched to a reported structure fire at the corner of Peachtree St & 10th St, the Margaret Mitchell house. The first due Engine, Ladder & Battalion Chief would normally respond from Station 15, only 2 blocks to the East on 10th Street. They were all working the fire on McMillian St, which runs off 10th street approximately 15 blocks West of this alarm.
<P>

The Division 1 Chief had responded to the McMillian St fire earlier, and immediately started for Peachtree & 10th as part of the first alarm response. He was first on the scene, had heavy flames showing on second floor of a large three story brick & frame house that was under restoration. As he walked around the house, other floors flashed into flames, and the house became fully involved. They went to defensive mode, operating 1 ladder pipe, 1 Stinger, 2 deluge guns. It took about an hour to control the fire. The interior of the house is about 80% destroyed, the 2nd & 3rd floors have caved in.
<P>

The Margaret Mitchell house is actually a house which was divided into apartments many years ago. Margaret Mitchell and her husband lived in one of the apartments. It was there that she wrote "Gone with the Wind", published in 1936. The house had been vacant for a number of years, with little interest in restoring it until about four or five years ago. A group had raised the money to buy the property and was working to finance the restoration when the house was heavily damaged in 1994 by an early morning fire of suspicious origin.
<P>

The Daimler-Benz Corp. stepped forward to fund a multi-million dollar complete reconstruction and restoration, which has been underway for over year, with completion scheduled prior to the Olympics. I'm sure there were plans to have receptions & parties there during the Olympics.
<P>

The Margaret Mitchell house fire today has been ruled as "Suspicion of Arson, under investigation". Both the Chief and the first-in crews noticed a strong smell of gasoline coupled with the sudden flashovers. There are also pour patterns on the inside of the house, indicating a flammable liquid was used. In addition, the crew from Station 15 had observed nothing as they passed the site en route to the McMillian St fire less than 20 minutes earlier.
<P>
<HR>
My own opinions:
<P>
The house on McMillian St had a very overgrown yard, which gave the appearance of a vacant or abandoned house. Since the fire reportedly started on the front porch, it may have been set to draw the 1st due equipment away from the prime target at 10th & Peachtree. The fires could be entirely unrelated, although the timing and circumstances seem suspicious.

<H2>UNABOMBER SUSPECT IN CUSTODY...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

The Federal Bureau of Investigation may have finally caught the
elusive Unabomber, who is suspected of killing three people and
injuring 23 others since 1978.
<P>

53-year-old Theodore John Kaczynski was taken into custody by
federal agents on Wednesday afternoon near Lincoln, Montana,
which is a rural area located about 50 miles northwest of Helena.
Kaczynski was not immediately placed under arrest or was charged.
The United States Justice Department said on Thursday morning
that they expected to formally charge the suspect today.
<P>

Agents at the scene of Kaczynski's wilderness cabin, which was
described as very small, perhaps with dimensions of 20x20, said
that they have found explosive chemicals and bomb-making materials
in the cabin.  The cabin was said to not have electricity or
indoor plumbing.
<P>

Federal agents said that they found a partially assembled bomb
in the cabin.  It will be on this evidence that he will be
charged with one count of possession of a bomb on Thursday.
With that charge, authorities can then take their time to
further build their case against the suspect and then, most
likely, charge him with other Unabomb crimes. 
<P>

FBI and ATF agents found the partially assembled device while X-raying one of the many boxes that were found in the cabin. Agents also reportedly found bomb diagrams and books.
One federal agent said about the search, "It's going very slowly
because we're not sure if it's booby-trapped.  We have an
explosives ordnance team X-raying everything before we touch it."
The search of the cabin and an outbuilding is expected to take
several days.
<P>

Neighbors in the area said that the suspect was a "hermit" and
rarely talked to anyone in the dozen or so years that he lived
there.  The bearded, long-haired Kaczynski was wearing torn
black jeans and a black shirt when he was led away by federal
authorities in handcuffs.
<P>

Kaczynski totally fits the profile of the infamous Unabomber.
In 1958, he graduated from Evergreen Park High School, which
is located in the southwest Chicago suburb of Evergreen Park.
He graduated from Harvard when he was barely 20-years-old.
He is highly educated.  Kaczynski received a master's degree
and a doctorate from the University of Michigan.  Later, he
was a math professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
<P>
The FBI was said to have Kaczynski's cabin under surveillance for
for a number of weeks.  Authorities said that they believed that
they had been on the right track, since the beginning of the year, when they were provided information by Kaczynski's family. Kaczynski's mother sold her house in the DuPage County suburb of Lombard, Illinois earlier this year.  While in the process of moving things, relatives
came across some old writings of Kaczynski's and saw that they bore a
remarkable resemblance to the Unabomber's manifesto.  The relatives
then contacted the FBI. 
<P>
Rick Smith, who just retired from the FBI, and who was a key member of the Unabomber
Task Force, last week said, "The FBI's fairly certain they have
the right man."

<H2>QANA: WAS IT A DELIBERATE ATTACK?...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

A very serious question has been emerging since the unfortunate Isreali artillery bombardment of the United Nations compound in the Lebanese village of Qana.  During the Isreali Operation "Grapes of Wrath", the compound was hit by an artillery barrage on 18 April 1996 that resulted in the deaths of between 91 and 105 people, mostly Lebanese civilian refugees.  The exact number of dead is not known because of some of the ordnance that the IDF used, there were simply too many shredded body parts to make an exact count.
<P>

Questions, of late, have arisen whether or not the attack was deliberately intended to inflict civilian deaths and injuries. The Lebanese and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah terrorist organization, of course, say yes.  Isreal says no to the charges, and that the incident was an unfortunate accident.
<P>

The United Nations conducted its own investigation.  Major-General Franklin van Kappen, U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's top military advisor, submitted a six-page report that was highly critical of the IDF.  Van Kappen said in his report, "The shelling of the U.N. compound was the result of gross technical and/or procedural errors."
<P>

While conducting his eight-day investigation, van Kappen made a very detailed study that found that at least 36 Isreali shells had landed in or near the U.N. camp.  The shelling was concentrated on two specific areas. The first area was located 120 yards south of the compound.  This area was hit almost entirely, except for one round, by impact-fuzed shells.  These shells explode when they hit the ground.  They are mostly used to destroy equipment and ordnance. These artillery rounds to the south of the camp landed very close to where Hezbollah guerrillas had been firing a mortar at a nearby IDF ground unit.
<P>

The second area that was struck was the U.N. compound itself.  The camp was hit by a large number of proximity-fuzed shells.  These type of shells are designed to detonate above the ground to widen the radius of impact.
<P>

But the question remains -- what was the Isreali's intentions? There is no question that the Isrealis were provoked to attack by deadly Hezbollah mortar fire.  After the guerrillas fired their mortar rounds, at least two or three guerrillas reportedly entered the U.N. camp.  The Isrealis apparently knew this.  How did they know it?  Some United Nations officials say privately that the IDF knew exactly what it was doing when it fired upon the U.N. base.  The IDF allegedly bombed the mortar site first and then turned its attention to the compound and hit it with at least eight of the airburst shells in hopes of hitting the guerrillas.
<P>

Major-General van Kappen's report did not explicitly say that the attack was deliberate.  The report did point to some discrepancies in the response of the Isrealis.  The most serious discrepancy pointed out in the report contradicts the IDF argument that the incident was an "accident."  The pattern of the shells suggests that it was not, as the IDF said, "a couple of stray shells" that hit the compound.  The report said that the U.N base was struck with five impact-fuzed shells and eight proximity-fuzed shells.
<P>

Van Kappen said, "When I went there, I believed the Isreali Army, a few shells had just overshot.  I was there only ten minutes when I knew that theory was in deep trouble.  This was not a simple overshoot."
<P>

The Isrealis have claimed that the U.N. report is grossly unfair. But several experts, analysts and journalists have told ENN that the Isrealis have contradicted themselves several times in their effort to explain what happened.  The IDF does say, in a report acquired by ENN, that the shelling of the U.N. base was a combination of a map-reading error and differing muzzle velocities.
<P>

In their report, dated 9 May 1996, the Isrealis said, "It became apparent that two mistakes had occurred in the IDF headquarters during the approval process of the artillery mission against the mortar site.  First - the coordinates available at the headquarters for the UN base in Qana were incorrect, resulting in the UN base being thought to be some 100 meters further away from the target mortar site than it actually was.  Second -- the range from the UN base was calculated from a point in the center of the base, not taking into account the actual width of the base.  As a result of these two errors, while IDF headquarters believed the UN base to be located some 350 meters from the target point, in fact the outer perimeter of the base was only some 180 meters distant."
<P>

The IDF report gave the times that the mission began, "The first battery executed its fire mission between approximately 1407 and 1411 (hours) and the second battery executed its fire mission between approximately 1411 and 1417.  In total, both batteries fired some 78 shells at their targets."
<P>

The IDF said that it could not stop the attack in time, after it was communicated to the IDF headquarters that they were firing upon a U.N. base.  The report said, "At 1416 the IDF received initial reports of artillery hits on the Qana UN camp.  These reports were too late to stop the fire missions.  As a result, the IDF immediately diverted the aforementioned RPV (Remotely Piloted Vehicle...a drone airplane that is equipped with a camera.), in order to ascertain the validity of the reports. Upon reaching the area of the Qana camp, the RPV was unable to transmit a clear picture of the area, although one can see in the RPV camera film that the camp had already been hit."
<P>

Ronald W. Lewis, the chief military analyst of The Intellisys Group, a military/national security "think tank", similar to ERRI, strongly believes that the Isreali attack on the U.N. compound was deliberate.  Lewis said in a recent analysis of the Qana incident, "It is extremely unlikely that the Isrealis would fire artillery anywhere without the use of either a drone or a forward observation team, either of which would have told the Isreali artillery directors that their guns were striking a UN camp.  The same radar that told them the location of the enemy rockets would also have told them they were missing them."
<P>

Lewis added, "As for Isreali claims that the drone was too far away to see civilians in the compound, it doesn't matter: Qana was well known as a UN compound and never should have been fired upon, with or without civilians.  Isreali military orders prohibit artillery strikes within 350 meters of a UN compound, yet the Hezbollah rocket and mortar positions were within 150 meters of the base."
<P>

On top of all of this, the London-based Observer newspaper last weekend reported that the IDF had established a new top secret commando group called Egoz.  It is believed that this unit, whose mission is to hunt down Hezbollah members, was acting as a forward observation team and was attempting to extract itself from the area when the artillery bombardment was ordered.  Could it had been that the Egoz unit saw the Hezbollah guerrillas enter the Qana UN camp and directed the fire there?  Or, was the artillery fire designed to cover the extrication and withdrawal of the secret unit from a on-going firefight? The Isrealis officially deny having any ground resources in the area.
<P>

What REALLY happened?  That question will probably never be fully answered.  The truth probably lies in a combination of all of the known evidence.  The real facts of the circumstances in Qana may remain hidden somewhere in a classified report, or may have never been adequately recorded in the midst of an on-going battle and the infamous "fog of war."
<P>

Historians point to a similar situation that happened during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.  A U.S. plane bombed a large Iraqi shelter in Baghdad.  Reportedly, a large number of civilians were killed in that air raid.  American officials said that the shelter, according to allied intelligence, was being used by top Iraqi military and Baath Party officials.  A conflict about the actual use of the bunker remains a mystery, even today.
<P>

It is unfortunate that such incidents happen in a battlefield environment.  Even with good human and technical intelligence, war is a fast-moving endevour where, especially in this day and age, split-second decisions must to be made.  Errors in judgement are, unfortunately, sometimes likely to happen.  Regardless of the real answers or factual reasons that the Qana UN base was struck by Isreali artillery -- one must draw the conclusion that the end result was an error in judgement and sincerely hope that the IDF would take a different course, were they faced with a similar situation again.

<H2>FBI/ATF Report to Congress on Series of Afro-American Church Fires</H2>

WASHINGTON (ENN) - Federal officials on Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee said they have found no evidence of a national conspiracy in a recent number of fires at southern black churches.  They will, however, continue their investigation into the arsons.
<P>

John Magaw, the director of the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), said, "We have not yet found any evidence of an interstate or national conspiracy, but until our work is done no motive or suspect will be eliminated.  There are indications of a conspiracy involving at least two fires in South Carolina." 
<P> 

The director said that five arrests were made in South Carolina, and in other cases -- one arrest was made in Alabama and one in Mississippi.  Magaw said, "There are a number of people who think alike throughout the country and they see somebody do something and they go do it themselves." The director was essentially saying that it appears that most of the church fires were copy-cat in nature.
<P>
Several black ministers, that testified before the committee, brought forth allegations that the fires were "racially motivated" and that they believed that they were somehow connected.  Agents said that the "methods of operation" (MO) of the perpetrators were not consistent and that while they may be generally "racially motivated", there does not appear to be a "commonality" between the cases.
<P>  

Deval Patrick, an Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, told the Committee, "It is premature to draw conclusions one way or the other as to whether the fires we are seeing are part of an organized hate movement."
<P>

The ATF and FBI continue to collectively investigate 32 fires in predominately black churches that have occured since January of 1995.  Six of the fires have occurred in Tennessee, five in South Carolina, five in Louisiana, four in Alabama, three in Mississippi, one in Georgia and one in Virginia.

<H2>Western Wildfire Summary-06/24/96</H2>

WESTERN UNITED STATES (ENN) - Firefighters are struggling to
control several wildfires that are burning in the western
United States.  In northern Arizona, hundreds of people have
been evacuated from their homes and ten hikers had to be
airlifted out of the Grand Canyon because of fires.  By
Sunday night, 17,000 acres in the State of Arizona had been
scorched.
<P>

Fire crews from across the nation are coming in to help battle
the blazes, some from as far away as New Jersey and Florida.
One fire has burned about 1,500 acres along the North Rim of
the Grand Canyon.
<P>

<UL>
<LI>A 2,000 acre blaze is burning outside the Apache Sitgreaves
National Forest, located in the northeastern part of Arizona.
<LI>In Nevada, at least four homes located 60 miles south of Reno
have been destroyed in a wildfire that has burned about 4,000
acres.
<LI>The largest wildfire burning is in Utah.  On Sunday, at least
8,000 acres have burned about 55 miles south of Salt Lake City.
More than 200 firefighters are battling this fire.
<LI>In Southern California, firefighters in Riverside County are
battling a blaze that has scorched about 1,400 acres.

<center><B>THE FOLLOWING IS A REPRINT FROM THE
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE CHIEFS
NEWSLETTER "ON SCENE"</B>

<H2>ARE YOU GETTING YOUR FAIR SHARE?</H2>
By Gary G. Ludwig, MS, EMT-P</center>
<P>

Budget a little tight?  Looking for extra revenue?  Do you
bill for EMS transport?  Many fire departments or districts
have historically done EMS transport without charging a
service fee.  I know of one community where there is no
charge for residents and a $50 transport charge for
non-residents.  Insurance companies certainly love these
fire agencies.  In most cases, a citizen's private insurance
benefits provide for EMS transport.  Not collecting is merely
making the insurance company richer.  At the minimum, fire
agencies should at least be billing an ALS or BLS base rate
and mileage.  Unsure what you should be billing?  Get a copy
of your area prevailing profile from your Medicare carrier.
<P>

Am I advocating turning fire agencies into for-profit
organizations like the commercial providers?  No, to the
contrary, I am merely advocating placing the cost of your
services provided back to the end user and lessening the
burden on the taxpayer.  In essence, this constitutes
cost-shifting and shows that fire agencies can be
cost-effective and efficient.  And unlike our commercial
counterparts who send the proceeds to the shareholder,
fire agencies traditionally revert the funds back into our
organizations for new equipment and better salaries to retain
quality people.
<P>

The Annapolis Fire Department (MD) is looking into the
possibility of charging for the EMS services they provide.
Captain Dale Crutchley who heads the department's EMS
tells me,  "if you look at it objectively, the citizens are paying
for the service twice.  First, they either pay premiums to
insurance companies or taxes for Medicare and Medicaid,
plus they pay taxes to support the fire department."
Conservatively, AFD is expecting to collect over $100,000 a
year if the proposal is accepted by the city fathers.
<P>

Last year in a column I mentioned that Lufkin Texas Fire
Chief Fenton (Pete) Prewitt was not only doing emergency
transports, but had also entered the routine transport market.
One year later, the report card is in.  Chief Prewitt reports
that his department generated $1.2 million in revenue and
turned $175,000 back to the city to be put into general
revenue for other city services.  Chief Prewitt can be reached
at 409-633-0367.
<P>

To accept or not accept assignment!  Medicare Part B!  All
inclusive or flat-fee structure!   Are you worried about the
different rules, applications and criteria from more than 1,200
possible payers?  Just contract it out to a collection agency
that specializes with medical payments and sit back and
open the envelope with the check.  Many of these collection
agencies can also help you to negotiate managed care
contracts.  In essence, you need to position yourself with
the managed care of the future.
<P>

In a bizarre story, two AMR paramedics in California were
suspended from their jobs for trying to market trading cards
with grisly photos of battered corpses.  The paramedics had
3,000 nine-card packs called "Cards of Death" which sold for
$8.95.  As reported by the Associated Press, Chuck
McFadden, a spokesman for AMR-West said, "Paramedics
are in the business of saving lives, not profiting from death.
This just flies in the face of what this company and its
paramedic employees are all about."  Ironically, a week
earlier AMR announced record profit earnings of $24.5 million
for their shareholders on $483.8 million gross revenue in 1995.
<P>

Mr. Ed Crandall of California would also beg to differ.  He
claims the bill from AMR is what made him sick.  As reported
in the San Jose Mercury News, AMR was called to the
Morgan Hill medical office building when Crandall felt woozy.
The AMR medics rolled him in a wheelchair next door to the
emergency room of Saint Louise Hospital.  The next day,
another AMR ambulance crew transferred Crandall to
O'Connor Hospital.  The cost from AMR for the 5 minute
wheelchair ride was $596.25 and $1,119.11 for the 30 minute
ambulance transfer.  Maybe Mr. McFadden would like to
rethink his statementract his statement about what AMR is
really all about.

<B>LEAD STORY**</B>


<H3>HOSTAGE SITUATION RESOLVED IN PORTLAND...</H3>
By Steve Macko
<P>

A gunman who was dressed in camouflage fatigues and a black beret
shot and wounded two men on Thursday afternoon and then barricaded
himself and four hostages in a Portland, Oregon, stock brokerage
for four hours before surrendering to police.
<P>

At about 1415 PST, the gunman, identifed as James H. Rincker, entered
the loading dock of the 32-story KOIN Center, which is a prominent
office and residential complex located at 3rd and Clay in the heart of 
downtown Portland.  Rincker came to the building reportedly intent on 
shooting some woman office workers who had recently had him fired from 
his job as a package deliveryman.
<P>

A Portland Police supervisor said, "He was angry at these women and
decided he was going to go there and shoot them."  People who know
the suspect describe him as short-tempered and fond of guns.
<P>

Rincker's roommate said that the suspect dreamed of starting his
own cult.  The roommate said, "He was always talking about getting 
his own little sect together."
<P>

When Rincker entered the building's underground parking garage, he
fired several shots from one of the guns that he was carrying.  Two 
men were wounded in the garage.  One of the victims was shot twice 
in the back and the other suffered two gunshot wounds to the leg. 
The suspect also fired his rifle that was equipped with a scope.
Smoke from the rifle activated the smoke detectors in the building
and sounded the fire alarm.  The building's elevators were automatically
shut down.
<P>

Rincker then left the garage and entered the first floor lobby of
the KOIN Center.  In the lobby, people were exiting from the 
building.  Rincker shouted orders at them to stop and even fired
a handgun into the air, but none of the people who rapidly leaving
complied with his order to stop.  One man said, "I came down the
stairs and saw a guy with fatigue pants and a rifle with a scope
on it.  I heard shots.  He was shouting, 'Come here,' at me.  I
started speeding out of there."  Another witness said that the
gunman did express frustration when people did not comply with
his demands.  The witness said that Rincker shouted at people,
"Shut up!  Don't Move!  What are you guys, stupid?!"
<P>

When police officers arrived responding to the alarm in the building, 
Rincker fired shots at them.  None of the shots hit the officers.
The suspect then grabbed a female hostage and barged into a stock
brokerage office that was located across the hall from CBS Television
affiliate KOIN-TV.  Inside of the office, Rincker took three more
hostages.  Unknown to the gunman, two other women were able to
hide under desks in the office and stayed hidden throughout the
four hour ordeal.
<P>

While Rincker was barricaded in the office, he answered a phone.
On the other end was Keith Headman, who is the chief of Security
at the Charles Schwab brokerage office in San Francisco.  Headman
had called the office because he had heard that something was
happening in Portland.  In a smart move, Headman talked to Rincker
for about an hour on the phone until Portland Police hostage
negotiators could set up and take over.
<P>

At one point during the negotiations, Rincker fired at officers
from inside the office.  Again, no officers were hit.  Finally,
during the standoff, Rincker allowed his hostages to leave and
at  1828 PST, the suspect emerged from the office and was taken 
into police custody.
<P>

The two men that Rincker initially wounded were reported to be
in fair condition on Friday.  A Portland Police spokesman said,
"We are very fortunate that no one died.  It is a very busy office
building."

<TITLE>"Good Times" is a Hoax</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
For Immediate Release: 03/01/96
<P>
<U><H2>The AOL 'Good Times' Virus is a Hoax</H2></U>
Reports continue to surface from a variety of normally reputable sources in regard to a so-called "Good-Times" virus that is contained within e-mail sent through or originating from the America On-Line(tm)
computer service. The latest report (02/27/96) came from a Sheriff's Office in California and was distributed through a number of "police" channels on the Internet.  Besides police and military channels, the hoax has also reportedly proliferated among U.S. Dept. of Agriculture employees, and other reputable government offices. It appeared to be totally legitimate...<B>.it was not</B>.
<P>
Sadly, any number of reliable news sources and individuals have fallen for this rumor in the past, including the EmergencyNet News Service. Late in January, we received a copy of a message from an authentic "military souce" which explained the "virus" that was reportedly being spread by e-mail.   Stupidly, believing this previously reliable reporter, we "bit" and passed along the warning...creating quite a furor among several of our readers, who study such issues on an on-going and professional basis. They immediately, and thankfully, notified us of our error.
<P>
Even though we retracted the alert the next day and in one other subsequent story, the "cat was out of the bag".  Although our intent was honest, and our timeliness exemplary, our facts apparently left something to be desired.  We apologize for our error, stand chastised,  and vow to obtain "several" expert opinions before releasing further information about other potentially destructive viruses. If you read a "virus alert" here in the future, it will be based on at least three reliable sources.
<P>
It should be noted that Microsoft(tm) does acknowledge that there currently is a Word for Windows(tm) virus that can be spread by e-mail and that it runs a "macro" that can allow it to be become destructive. The release of that story admittedly contributed to our belief that the problem could have been transfered to other e-mail providers and systems. Experts have advised us that this method of infection of normal e-mail is not technically feasible at this time. It is confirmed that the "Good-Times" virus either doesn't exist, nor spread an infection . 
<P>
<B>REPEAT...the "Good Times" virus is a hoax, designed to waste your bandwidth and increase your insecurity!  PLEASE DO NOT spend any more time or effort spreading this rumor.... </B>

<H3>Building Collapse Predictions Come True</H3>
By Paul Anderson, Metro Correspondent
<P>
Chicago, IL, January 12, 1996 (ENN)--At approximately 16:30p.m.
(EST) today, the roof of the Waldbaum's Supermarket at Jerusalem
Ave. and Hicksville Road, in N. Massapequa, NY, came crashing
down in a checkout lane.  At least twenty (20) people were
reported injured in the collapse, thankfully, only two or three
of them seriously.  Numerous fire, police, and EMS agencies
responded to assist in the extrication of people trapped by the
falling debris.  According to the Nassau County Police, the
accident appeared to be weather related, due to heavy
accumulations of snow and ice on the supermarket roof. 
<P>

As was feared and predicted, in an ERRI building collapse warning
that was issued on 01/11/96, numerous building roofs have
collapsed all over the East coast. A nursing home roof caved in
Clinton, MD and residents were evacuated until the severity of
the damage could be assessed.  The ceiling of St. Philips
Episcopal Church in New York City also succumbed to the weight
of the snow on Friday, causing an estimated $1.5 million dollars
in damage. No injuries were reported, according to church
officials.
<P> 

One minor injury was reported at another structural failure at
the Linens 'n Things store on Long Island, NY.  Several others
narrowly escaped injury because the noise of the failing roof
supports gave nearly everyone time to escape.  Large snow-packed
sections of roofs also gave way in Newark, Del, and Pawtucket,
R.I. , according to Associated Press (AP) reports.
<P> 

Emergency officials in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode
Island all issued public advisories today, warning the public to
remove snow from flat and shallow angle roofs. Building
officials in several states said that besides complete collapse,
many buildings are also suffering from snow associated leaks and
water damage. 
<P>

Many Northeastern roofing contractors have reportedly been
swamped with repair requests for cracked and fallen ceilings,
broken tiles, and large puddles of water in people's living
rooms. One veteran roofer said that the situation could get
worse as continuing rain saturates already snow-covered roofs,
freezes, and then thaws. The additional weight, contraction, and
expansion of the heavy snow could cause more leaks or even
result in additional disasters for unprepared home and business
owners.

<H2>NYC SUBWAY EXPLOSION THEN BOMB THREAT</H2>
By Jim Fay ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

NEW YORK CITY (ENN) - An explosion from electrical manholes
adjacent to a busy NYC subway station caused little panic on
board the trains, but necessitated a massive response of NYC
emergency personnel when a subsequent bomb threat was
called in to 911.
<P>

At approximately 1815 hrs., EDT, Tuesday, April 23, three manholes
exploded at the Brooklyn intersection of DeKalb Ave. and the Flatbush
Avenue Extension in Downtown Brooklyn.  The explosions caused the
loss of electrical power to the DeKalb Ave. station of the New York
City Transit Authority Subway.  The station and signal lights went
out, but 3rd rail power remained on.  NYPD Emergency Service Units,
as well as a second alarm response of the FDNY and a mobilization
of EMS responded to the scene.
<P>

However, a more serious turn of events caused a heightened vigilance
at the scene when NYPD 911 reported receiving an anonymous call
claiming responsibility for the explosion and that three other
bombs were placed at the scene by the caller.  The call came into
Police Headquarters about twenty minutes after the explosion.
NYPD Chief of Department Louis Anemone ordered over the Department
radio that the location of the explosion be secured as a Crime Scene
until a determination could be made and ordered that the Bomb Squad
respond to the scene.
<P>

When the fires were extinguished, the NYPD Bomb Squad investigated
the manholes in an attempt to locate the reported devices. When
no devices were found in the manholes or in the surrounding areas,
an "all clear" was sounded to Emergency Personnel and the job
of rescuing the passengers commenced.
<P>

It was reported that six to eight trains  were stuck both
underground and on the Manhattan Bridge between Brooklyn
and Manhattan and about 40,000 passengers were stranded
on board.  Since the movement of the trains themselves were
not effected, most trains were sent back into Manhattan to
various stations there and the passengers removed. After the
all clear was sounded, trains located close to the DeKalb
station were allowed in to unload passengers on the Brooklyn
side.
<P>

EMS reported a very low patient count of three injuries, one of which
was a police officer.  Mayor Rudolph Giuliani responded, as did Police
Commissioner Howard Safir and Fire Commissioner Thomas VonEssen.
Commissioner Safir emphasized that this incident was "not terroristic"
in nature and that Con Edison, the NYC electrical company, confirmed
that the explosions and fire were a result of salt erosion on the
cables under the street.  This is caused from the heavy snow storms
in NYC over the winter and the corroding effect of the salt used on
the snow covered roadways.
<P>

The emergency operation concluded about 2100 hrs. The Transit Authority
reported that six different subway lines were effected, and the effect
may be felt during the Wednesday morning rush hour.

<H3>The Politics of Disaster; Unnecessary Deaths</H3>
<BR>

Editorial By: Paul Anderson
<BR>
	      ENN correspondent
<BR>


Chicago, IL, (ENN) June 7, 1995 -- First Kobe, now Sakhalin, the
rhetoric of confrontational international relations goes on.  
Both of these cities have suffered devastating earthquakes and
hundreds and thousands of dead. Unfortunately, for the residents
of both Kobe and Sakhalin, diplomatic predicaments and conflicts
may have cost lives.
<P>


In the case of Kobe, Japanese government officials reportedly
refused rescue aid from dozens of countries that have a
demonstrated  history of expertise in disaster mitigation and
heavy urban rescue. Even though dozens of observers "on the
ground" in Japan said that Kobe rescuers were overwhelmed and
lacked the necessary equipment and training to manage the tragic
event, Japanese officials refused to let American earthquake
rescue teams and other experts into the country. Why, many
emergency responders asked at the time?  Pride...
economics...lack of availablity...what was the real reason that
Americans weren't invited to assist?
<P>


Retrospective analysis of events could suggest that the Japanese
may not have invited American and other rescue teams out of fear
that they would then have to make reasonable trade and other
concessions at some future time.  It is well known that polite
Japanese culture requires that services or favors be returned in
equal or greater measure. Is it possible that hundreds of people
may have died unnecessarily in Kobe, all out of larger issues
regarding a tariff on American autos and auto parts and future
concerns about needing to repay American kindness?
<P>


In the case of the Sakhalin Island earthquake, the political
implications of rescue and humanitarian aid have became even
more obvious. Russian President Boris Yelsin even went so far as
to publicly admit that he was refusing offers of Japanese
medical aid  because he feared that Japanese rescue efforts
might be used, at some future time, as "psychological leverage"
in some sort of attempted Japanese "take-back" of their former
island territories.  Did hundreds more die in Russia because of
"political complications"?
<P>


In both of the aforementioned disasters, technical rescue
experts say that the answer is yes...people did die
unnecessarily because of national pride and worries of political
ramifications. They point to an May 23rd, 1995 "after-action"
report by the Japanese government that said, "The earthquake
that devastated Kobe in January raised serious questions about
the efficiency of Japan's emergency medical system".  It
continued, "The earthquake exposed many issues in terms of
quantity, quality, promptness and efficiency of Japan's medical
care in time of disaster."
<P> 

The few "Western" rescuers allowed to participate in the Kobe 
rescue have reported many stories of "too little, too late", 
in regard to both rescue efforts and medical care. Experts say 
that similar accounts could be expected from Russia, if there 
were any independent analysts available to tell the tale. Given 
the state of information dissemination in Russia, few experts 
believe that useful or factual information will be forthcoming 
from the Sakhalin disaster.
<P>


But, that doesn't change the facts, according to Clark Staten of
the Chicago-based Emergency Response & Research Institute.
According to Staten, and based on American standards, both Kobe
and Sakhalin were "less than optimal operations". "I don't think
we can hold either operation out as an example of either
efficiency or effectiveness", Staten said. "While I despise
being a 'Monday Morning Quarterback', I also can't condone the
refusal of any government to accept the assistance of bona-fide
rescue experts, that have spent years to become adept at
building collapse rescue and the other skills needed in this
type of disaster", Staten continued.
<P>


In Kobe, eyewitnesses reported that they often found "lines" of
fire trucks and other rescue vehicles stranded by piles of
rubble, blocking the streets.  Yet, no endloaders or bull dozers
were seen clearing the streets for many hours after the quake.
One witness said that there were almost no overhead cranes
evident for several days, even though they are known to be
essential equipment for safely removing concrete and other
rubble from atop victims.
<P> 


Staten said that Associated Press (AP)reports has reported
allegations that almost half of the rescuers in Neftegorsk,
Russia were military conscripts that had no rescue training, and
that at what should have been the height of the rescue, that
victim's families were making allegations that the soldiers were
seen "lounging", drinking vodka, and possibly intoxicated. 
Other charges of bribes being needed to pass military
checkpoints, and that soldiers were hoarding and selling donated
bottled water were made by victims and the families of victims.
<P> 


Worse than these peripheral charges are eyewitness charges that
rescue efforts were "unorganized" and "sporadic". At least one
report said that rescuers in Neftegorsk completely stopped their
efforts at meal times and at night, and that there were no
lights for night work or sufficient heavy cranes to move debris.
And yet, miraculously, two small children and a middle aged lady
were found alive after being trapped for five (5) days in the
rubble.  One can only wonder how many might have been saved had
an truly competent rescue effort been undertaken.
<P>


"The time has come for an end to this parochial attitude toward
disasters and rescue", the veteran emergency administrator said.
"National pride and a continued focus on the possible political
implications of offers of humanitarian assistance have to stop",
Staten added. "What the world really needs is an international
working agreement that automatically invites the 'best and
brightest' of the rescue community to any major disaster, where
they could help to alleviate suffering and decrease the possible
death toll", Staten continued.
<P> 


"This could be done in a non-judgemental way, without threatening 
any other global agreements or international treaties", he added.  
"It would just be a given...that the stricken nation, when overwhelmed, 
would welcome, accept, and reimburse recognized expert/rescue
organizations from other countries, without regard for future
considerations...it could become a global 'mutual aid' system"
Staten concluded.
<P>


Although the details of such agreements are yet to be worked
out, and he realizes that some officials will consider the
entire concept naive, Staten said that he will propose such a
system to both the United States government and the United
Nations. Staten finished the interview by saying that even if
one life were saved by this idea that the time and effort would have
been worthwhile.

<H2>CHICAGO GETS READY FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

The Democratic National Convention, along with President Bill Clinton, comes to the City of Chicago in August.  Already, federal law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United States Secret Service, are asking foreign intelligence agencies for any information about possible international plots to disrupt the convention. Possible terrorist attacks top the list of main concerns to the security forces that will blanket Chicago this summer.
<P>

The convention will be held at the United Center on Chicago's near West Side.  This is the same facility where Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls play their basketball games.  Security planners for the upcoming convention have recommended that the convention stage be built away from the sides of the building that may be vulnerable to truck bombs.  Counterterrorism experts are also studying less-protected areas in the city, such as hotels where delegates and government officials will be staying.
<P>

Demonstrators are another concern.  Memories of the 1968 Democratic National Convention still haunt the Chicago Police Department (CPD) just as Viet Nam has haunted the U.S. military.  It is being reported that many activists are planning to come and protest during the convention.  These groups are said to be comparing notes with one another on the internet.
<P>

Chicago Police officers have been undergoing special training in preparation for the convention.  CPD Sergeant Jim Devereaux told one training class, "We have a reputation as thugs in uniform." This infamous reputation comes from the televison news images of helmeted police officers beating on anti-war demonstrators on Michigan Avenue in 1968.  The Chicago Police Department intends to avoid any such reoccurance this time around.
<P>

Though everyone seems to remember what some people called "a police riot" at the 1968 convention -- the same people tend to forget that nearly 200 CPD officers were injured in the confrontations.
<P>

Today, only seven percent of the officers on the department were a part of what happened in 1968.  The department is much more representative of the population that it serves.  61 percent of CPD officers have attended college or earned a degree.  25 percent are black.  18 percent are female and ten percent are Hispanic.
<P>

Most of the responsibility for perimeter security will fall on the 2,500 members of the Chicago Police Department's tactical teams and special units.  Tactical teams normally work in plain- clothes in Chicago Police districts.  During the convention, these officers will be back in uniform.  They are among the best officers on the department.
<P>

They will be reinforced with 25 Immediate Reactionary Forces, which can be described as flying squads of ten officers each. They can immediately respond to wherever any disturbance may take place.  If needed, more officers from the city's 13,200- member police department can be called in as needed.

<TITLE>Withdrawal or Strategic Consolidation?</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
For Immediate Release: 1000 HRS.CST-02-26-91
<BR>
<H3>WITHDRAWAL OR STRATEGIC CONSOLIDATION ??</H3>
<BR>
Chicago, IL.  A historical perspective of the reports that
the Iraqi forces are "withdrawing from Kuwait" should prompt
an entirely different view than might appear obvious. During
the eight (8) year Iran/Iraq war, which ended in 1988, the
Iraqi military "withdrew" from the front on at least four (4)
separate occasions.  In each case, the "withdrawals" marked a
major battle and loss of large numbers of Iraqi strategic
forces.  In each case, the Iraqi response was to announce a
withdrawal and "possible negotiations of a cease fire".
<P>

During each and every occasion, the Iraqis withdrew far
enough to the rear to regroup, consolidate, resupply, and re-
establish command and control functions.  Shortly
thereafterward, the Iraqis would then begin a counter-
offensive.  All too frequently, the Iranian response to these
"peace initiatives" was to also withdraw and the Iranian
Fundamentalist government would then choose these periods of
"peace" as an opportunity to "purge" their senior command
staff of commanders not deemed to be faithful enough to
"Islamic principals".
<P>

Following these "purges" and the subsequent reorganizations,
more loyal Shiite commanders were placed into higher levels
of the command structure.  The resulting overall effect was
an eventual diminishment of the combat effectiveness of the
Iranian Army. Unfortunately, the "pure" Islamic commanders
were less prepared to be effective as combat leaders.
<P>

Also during the periods of "withdrawal" and "peace talks",
the Iraqi government choose (and was encouraged by several
governments selling arms) to obtain better equipment,
training, and command and control facilities.  In fact, one
such occurance, prompted the formulation of the now infamous
"Republican Guard".  The Iraqi elite force was then used to
"fill the breach" of any area overrun by the "human-wave
assaults" carried out by the underage, under-equipped, but
fanatical Iranian forces.
<P>

On numerous occasions during the later part of the war, the
Iranians would break through the first layer (and even second
layer) of the "Soviet Style Defense-in-Depth", only to be met
and `funnelled' into a "killing zone" of pre-registered tank
and artillery fire and poison gases.   From all appearances,
the Iranians appeared "victorious" for a period of time,
until meeting the pre-prepared ambuses.  Then, tremendous
numbers of casualties were encountered by the Iranians.
<P>
While, admittedly, the Coalition forces are utilizing an
entirely different doctrine of battle which calls for
"movement and fire", rather than the the mass assaults of the
Iranians; many expert agree that caution should still be
urged about the validity of any "reported withdrawal".
<P>

Several military strategists and at least one Chicago based
analyst suggest that this is the time to "press the attack"
and insure that the "Republican Guard" and other elite units
are destroyed in place.  "Short of a complete `laying down of
arms' and surrendering by the Iraqis, the offensive
capablility of the Coalition should be intensified and
directed towards those units that could regroup and pose a
threat of counter-attack", said Clark Staten of the Chicago
based Emergency Response and Research Institute.  "To do
otherwise, is to deny history and the past deceitful actions
and words of Saddam Hussein", Staten continued.
<P>

"The SCUD attack on the military barracks in Dhaharan
yesterday, while Hussein was publically calling for peace,
demonstrates the treachery and deceit of the leadership in
Baghdad", the author of the "Emergency Response Guide to
Terrorism" said.  The stategy and tactics of the Coalition
forces to date have been exemplary and should be continued
until the Iraqis have no significant military capability in
the area of operations..to do otherwise, would be to invite
future potential threats from Saddam Hussein", Staten
concluded.

<BR>

<H3>EXCITING TIMES AT EMS EXPO</H3>
<BR>
By Gary G. Ludwig, MS, EMT-P</center>
<P>

<B>IAFC-EMS EXPO REPORT</B>
<P>
All were in agreement that the EMS Expo, co-sponsored by the IAFC's EMS Section was another resounding success. Repeatedly, it was heard, the topics and speakers created one learning and informative session after another.  The EMS Executive Board extends its thanks to the speakers who made this program so productive.  Our thanks to Mike Keohi, Dr. Mark Eckstein, Don Lee, Mike Grille, Fred Thorp, Kevin Brame, Sandy Young, David Bryson, Dr. Ron Pirrallo, Jim Denney, and Dr. Steven Karch.  Your Executive Board was busy from morning to usually late into the evening hours with executive meetings, networking, and taking care of unfinished business.
<P>

At the Section meeting, Chief Jack Krakeel announced that the Chairman of the EMS Section, Chief Mary Beth Michos was unable to attend due to a important prior commitment. However, she sent copies of a lengthy report and closed with her thoughts and involvement over the years as she moves from Chairman to the Immediate Past Chairman position. One major issue which she addressed in her report was the effort to have a seat on the IAFC Board of Directors for an EMS Section representative.  After meeting with the Constitution and Bylaws Committee on this issue, Chief Michos reports that the Committee voted to place it on the next mail ballot.
<P>

Executive Board members gave their reports and it was quite apparent that the Section has been extensively involved representing the fire service with decision making on EMS issues at the national level over the past year.  The Section's Staff Intern, Frank Poole gave a report which included the election results.  Your new officers for the upcoming year are: Chair - Jack Krakeel; Vice-Chair - Ken Riddle; Secretary - John Sinclair; Treasurer - Dave Becker; Director-at-Large - Gary Ludwig.
<P>

I would like to personally take this opportunity to thank all of you who voted for me in my overwhelming, landslide victory.  I will continue to keep you abreast of the latest developments in the EMS industry.
<P>
<B>Federal Report</B>
<P>
David Bryson, EMS Program Analyst with NHTSA gave a report on many programs occurring at the federal level.  One point he emphasized is that the EMS Section's voice does play a significant role in the development of national policy on EMS issues.  This is verified through our position with the committee writing the "EMS Agenda of the Future" and our relationships and interaction with such groups as the National Association of EMS Physicians and National Association of EMS State Directors.
<P>
<B>Maryland Fire & Rescue Curriculum</B>
<P>
Chairman Krakeel announced a new partnership with the Maryland Fire & Rescue Institute.  In the future, the EMS Section will work with MFRI to offer an intensive EMS curriculum program at the regional level designed to tackle current and hard-hitting EMS/fire service issues.  Some of the curriculum will include speakers who are authorities on insurance reimbursement, forming partnerships with managed care organizations, and developing proposals for integration of an EMS and fire agency.
<P>

Other items Chief Krakeel mentioned was that the United States Fire Administration will support the addition of a national data set to the NFIRS report for fire based agencies and our membership in the Section has now exceeded 500 members.  With the announcement of the membership, Chief Krakeel set a goal to exceed 1,000 members in the Section.
<P>
<B>Chief David Beeker</B>
<P>
The newest addition to the Executive Board is David Becker as Treasurer.  Chief Becker is the Chief Medical Officer with the Chesterfield Fire Protection DIstrict in Chesterfield, Missouri where he has worked for the last 15 years.  Chief Becker has been a licensed paramedic for 18 years, has a Master's degree in Health Services Management, is a graduate of the EFO program, and helped develop the Health and Safety Officer course at the National Fire Academy.  Welcome to your awesome responsibilities.
<P>

If you were unable to attend EMS Expo, we certainly missed you and hope you can join us for Fire-Rescue International in Kansas City, MO later this summer.
<P>
<HR>
<B>Boca Raton Fire/EMS Report</B>
<P>
Last year it sounded like Chicken Little screaming that the sky was falling when commercial (private) providers were screaming dire warnings about Boca Raton (FL) Fire & Rescue taking over EMS transport.  At the top of their "cackling list" was warnings that 911 calls would go unanswered, citizens would pay more and wait longer for critical ambulance transports. One year later, Fire Chief Kerry Koen has provided us with documentation that residents are paying less for the service, the city is making money, and city paramedics are earning strong positive reviews from their patients.
<P>

In 1995, Boca Raton paramedics transported 4,378 people to the hospital.  Through March 1996, the city had collected more than $600,000 of the $936,927 the patients were charged for the service.  If you consider it cost the fire department
$294,918 in incremental expense to provide the service, the additional $312,490 in extra revenue was turned over to city officials and put into general revenue to hold down taxes for all the citizens.  While holding down taxes, BRF&R increased service levels by reducing the average time spent on a call from 61 minutes to 47 minutes while receiving high marks from mailing surveys sent out by Chief Koen.  So much for the argument of the private sector's contention that they are the only ones who operate high performance EMS systems.
<P>
City Council member Steven Abrahams said it best - "I think everyone agrees that government has a role in public safety. Once you know that government is going to be the initial responder in emergencies, it only makes sense that it would be more efficient for that agency to follow it all the way through."
<P>
Congratulations to Boca Raton Fire & Rescue on an exceptional performance. Chief Koen can be reached at 407-367-6700.
<P>
<HR>
<B>San Francisco Fire/EMS Integration Report</B>
<P>
For some time EMS Section Secretary John Sinclair and member Kevin Brame, along with Captain Gene McCarthy of Los Angeles County have been working on a project that will merge San Francisco EMS with the San Francisco Fire Department.  Mayor Willie Brown announced the merger in early April at a news conference.  Many details are still needed to be worked out but the basic premise of the plan looks like 24 ALS engines, 8 ALS ambulances, and 8 BLS ambulance.  There is an initial implementation date of July 1996 with an 18 month transition period.  At this point, these figures and dates are subject to change since much more work still lays ahead.
<P>
<HR>
<B>Rural Metro Report</B>

Rural/Metro announced agreements for acquisitions of commercial ambulance services in the Cincinnati and Indianapolis areas.  The Cincinnati purchase represents the last major metropolitan market in Ohio that Rural/Metro had not penetrated.  R/M already has beachheads in the Columbus and Cleveland areas.
<P>

The Indianapolis purchase includes some 911 emergency services.  Late last year R/M announced an acquisition of a service in the Indianapolis area that provided varying levels of service to 21 counties in Indiana.
<P>
The Cincinnati and Indianapolis purchase should put about
$12 million a year into the coffers of R/M.

In this column, we profile EMS Section member, EMS Chief Rich Meeker.  Chief Meeker, a paramedic has been with the Kenosha (WI) Fire Department for eight years and has been involved in EMS 20 years.  He is also the Secretary-Treasurer for the Wisconsin Emergency Medical Service Association for the last eleven years.
<P>

Meeker oversees the paramedic, the first responder, and EMD programs.  One innovative program which Meeker oversees is a CPR Outreach Program to the local community.  What makes it innovative is the manner in which it is funded and operated.  In order to maximize the financial resources, the city has a joint contract with the Christian Youth Center (CYC).  All 20 instructors are fire department personnel who work on their off day teaching CPR classes.  Upon completion of a class, the CYC sends a bill to the city.  The city then deposits money into a trust account, administered by the CYC to pay the instructors.  Individuals taking the CPR class pay $13.50 for instruction, which goes towards instructor salaries and administration costs.  The program trains about 50 people a month, including those working in day care centers, teachers, and members of the dental society.  Rich Meeker can be reached at 414-653-4100.

<H2>Shrapnel Device Explodes in Spokane, WA</H2>
<P>

(ENN) A "low magnitude" Improvised Explosive Device (IED) is reported to have gone off this morning, at approx. 06:30PDT, in the Spokane, WA City hall. Police and ATF personnel are reportedly on-scene and investigating the incident. The device, was believed to be a "pipe bomb" wrapped with "dry-wall nails" as an anti-personnel/schrapnel adjunct. There were no immediate reports of injuries.  Damage was done to the building, and pieces of the device were found approximately 100 meters from the main blast site. No claim of responsibity has been made for this mornings bombing.
<P>

Spokane, WA (04/01/96) was recently the scene of the a diversionary pipe-bombing of a newspaper office and a bank robbery. Allegations of "militia or white supremacist involvement" in the earlier bombing have been made by several sources.  The Northwest has been extremely active with "militia activity" in the past two months. The Northwest was previously the scene of a series of bombings in the 1980's involving members of the "Aryan Nation" and "The Order."
<P>

ERRI counter-terrorist (CT) analysts say that militia members have become "increasingly nervous and angry" within the past few weeks as federal agents have engaged in a series of raids of various compounds and arrested known militia leaders and confiscated weapons and explosives. As militias find themselves under increasing surveillence and threat of arrest, they reportedly find themselves with three viable choices; go deeper "underground", retaliate against the government, or capitulate and surrender peacefully.  While only the last alternative will assure their safety, and that of the public, the question remains as to how many will choose another and more violent option.

<BR>
<H3>"HEADS UP" NYC*EMS DISPATCHER SAVES CHILD...</H3>
By Jim Fay, ENN NYC/NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

A quick thinking NYC*EMS Dispatcher, who "had a feeling,"
is credited with literally saving a six-year-old little
girl in Brooklyn, NYC., from her abusive father.
<P>

EMS Dispatcher Susan James was handling the heavy-volume
operation for Brooklyn EMS, just before Christmas, when a
job, from an anonymous source, stated that a five-year-old
girl was observed by the caller with bruises and welts
on her. The caller believed the child was being abused.
<P>

Dispatcher James sent an ambulance crew to respond with
the police to the address of 17 Marcus Garvey Blvd in Brooklyn
Police Officers Anthony Phillips and Chevin Hutchinson, from
the NYPD's 81st Precinct, also were assigned to the '911' call.
Both the Police and EMT's Trenton Withworth and Lloyd
Anderson from EMS, went to the reported apartment.
<P>

The officers interviewed the father, Jose Balbuena, 24, who
willingly allowed police and EMS Techs to examine the child
in his apartment - his 3-year-old son. Initially satisfied,
both PD and EMS closed out the assignment as an "unfounded"
run. Dispatcher James, however, was skeptical.
<P>

When she reviewed the job on her computer screen, she again
saw the specifics of a "5-year-old girl" being the victim.
Still flooded by the routine dispatch assignments, James
contacted her supervisor, EMS Lieutenant John Kilcooley, and
expressed her concerns to him. Kilcooley concurred.
<P>

James contacted the same BLS crew that responded to the
address, and told them that the call specifically stated a
female child was involved. Lt. Kilcooly contacted the NYPD
by computer, and advised them to resend their unit to the
address.
<P>

This time, six-year-old Yanin Balbuena was found by the
emergency workers in the apartment. The anonymous caller
was correct: the child did have the signs of physical abuse
that were reported. The child was removed by the EMS crew to 
the hospital, and the father was arrested.
<P>

Today, December 29, Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes,
in announcing the seven-count indictment of Balbuena, had high
praise in the work of all the emergency workers involved. Ms.
James was particularly singled out for her professional ability
to recognize the situation, and to take the corrective action
that saved a child from continued serious abuse, and caused the
arrest of the abuser.

<TITLE>Rioting in Brixton, UK </TITLE>

For Immediate Release: 12/14/95-16:00CST

<B>London...</B>
<P>
<H3>Violent Demonstrations in S. London</H3>
A demonstration over a black man's death in police custody turned
violent on Wednesday when rioters burned two stores and dozens of
automobiles in the London district of Brixton.  Scotland Yard said
that three police officers and seven rioters were injured.  A number
of arrests were made.
<P>
The incident started when about 150 people gathered at the Brixton 
police station, which is a predominately black south London district.
The people were protesting the death of a burglary suspect at the
police station last week.  According to officials, the 26-year-old
suspect died from heart disease.
<P>
When the protesters started to move away from the police station and
go up the street, the police moved in to obstruct their movement.
In a statement issued by Scotland Yard, police said that they considered
the protesters move away from in front of the police station "irresponsible"
because of the traffic in the area.
<P>
Several hundred Metropolitan police in riot gear and on horses moved
against small groups of the rioters.  The rioters responded by throwing
rocks and bottles at officers, setting a small grocery store and a
carpet store on fire, overturning and burning automobiles, smashing
store windows and looting.
<P>
The atmosphere in Brixton is still described as tense by police, and they remain on alert for further problems. A spokesperson said that the man's death remains under investigation and that any additional findings will be made public at an appropriate time.

SOUTHWEST AND WESTERN UNITED STATES (ENN) - Several wildfires
were burning across various portions of the Southwest and
Western United States on Tuesday.  Most of the fires were
being fueled by high winds and high temperatures.
<P>

In Ventura County, California, about 60 miles north of Los Angeles,
a fire in the Los Padres National Forest has burned about 10,000 
acres.  Most of the land burned consists of chaparral in deep,
inaccessible canyons and grassland.  More than 2,000 firefighters
are battling this blaze.  It was reported on Tuesday morning that
this fire was only 25 percent contained.  It probably will not
be fully contained until 3 May 1996.
<P>
<HR>

In Riverside County, near the town of Rubidoux, a fire that
burned 100 acres also destroyed one home and damaged another.
<P>
<HR>

Another fire, this one near the Mexican border east of San Diego,
a blaze has destroyed one house and three mobile homes.  Winds
of up to 60 MPH were hampering firefighting efforts.
<P>
<HR>

In Arizona, 12,000 acres of desert land has been burned just
east of the city of Phoenix.
<P>

<HR>
In New Mexico, the blaze near the Los Alamos National Laboratory
has burned 14,600 acres.  About 900 firefighters are battling
the blaze.  Forest Service officials said that they don't
expect to have this fire fully contained for a week.
<P>
<HR>
ENN is following what appears to be the very early start of another heavy fire season in the Western part of the United States. We will be providing updates and news briefs as the season progresses.

<font size=5><strong>SECURITY AT THE SUMMER OLYMPIC GAMES IS READY</strong></font><font size=6> </font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
The Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta begin on Friday, 19 July. Even though that is a little less than two 
weeks to go, security personnel are already manning their posts and technicions are fine-tuning the myriad of 
high-tech security equipment that will be used.<br>
<br>
When it comes to the security of these games, nothing has been left to chance in Atlanta and the other venues 
that will be used by the athletes. An army of law enforcement officers will outnumber the athletes themselves.<br>
<br>
Security has evolved into a major production unto itself ever since the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972, when 
eleven Israeli athletes were killed by Black September terrorists. The security for the 1996 games is said to be 
tightest ever in history.<br>
<br>
Security planners for the Olympic Games have tried to cover every angle possible -- from cops on patrol to 
scuba divers and helicopters and high-tech devices such as I.D. badges with computer chips.<br>
<br>
The two things that constantly weigh on the minds of the people in charge of the security are the bombings of the 
World Trade Center in New York City and the federal building in Oklahoma City. Strategies to combat any 
possible terrorist attack have been planned and then have been re-planned. Though they won't confirm it, it is 
rumored that security planners have plotted their strategies using war games, just like the military. Said one FBI 
agent, &quot;There is too much at stake here to fail.&quot;<br>
<br>
Security planners have spent more than two years in their planning. A lot of people don't realize that all of the 
Olympic competitions will not be held in Atlanta. Venues, such as RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., will also 
be used. That stadium, like all of the venues, will be under the eyes of security cameras.<br>
<br>
Experts in every conceivable crisis management specialty will be brought in to assist security officials. From 
hostage negotiators to underwater explosives experts. Major John Gordon of the Atlanta Police Department 
said, &quot;When all is said and done, this city might be the safest place on the planet.&quot;<br>
<br>
One of the biggest challenges from a security viewpoint is the Ocoee River in the Cherokee National Forest. 
The canoeing and whitewater kayaking competitions will be held at this Tennessee location. 130 miles away 
from Atlanta. There will be more than 300 federal, state and local law enforcement officers providing security 
and chase away hunters.<br>
<br>
The officers assigned to this detail will live in remote base camps. Observation posts will be manned both on the 
ground and in the air. There will be constant foot patrols and a small flotilla of boats will provide surveillance 24 
hours a day. A U.S. Forest Service agent, in commenting on the security precautions, said, &quot;I've never seen 
anything like this.&quot;<br>
<br>
At another venue, in Gainesville, Georgia, located 50 miles from Atlanta, similiar security precautions are in 
place for the rowing events on Lake Lanier. Each day, before the rowing events, the one-mile course will be 
swept electronically for explosives.<br>
<br>
Federal agents have even checked out and approved the airport in Gainesville months ahead of time. The 
airport had to be approved to land military cargo planes in case, for some reason, troops had be flown in.<br>
<br>
But the most sophisticated of security equipment will be used in downtown Atlanta, where most of the games 
will take place. This, of course, is where the vast majority of athletes and spectators will be. Sitting in a control 
room, Michael Beck, an executive with a security firm called Sensormatic, is able to click on a computer mouse 
and the security camera that is mounted on top of the scoreboard in Fulton County Stadium is able to pan all 
around.<br>
<br>
1,000 video cameras have been installed for the Olympic Games. Operators controlling the cameras will have 
the ability to zoom in on just about anyone, regardless of where they are located in the stadium(s).<br>
<br>
Security at the Olympic Village, where the athletes will live, will be tighter than it is at the stadiums. Access to 
the residential areas will be controlled by scanners that are able to read individual handprints. In order to gain 
entry, a person's handprint must match digitized versions that are stored in computer chips embedded in 
identification badges.<br>
<br>
The movement of people other than athletes will be closely controlled and monitored. Each person has a 
security clearance level. This gives some members of the staff access to some locations but not to others. 
Employees will move through doors that are electronically programmed to track employees from door-to-door. 
Michael Beck of Sensormatic said, &quot;If we need to make a change on their access or shut them out, we can just 
jump on the computer terminal and take them out.&quot;<br>
<br>
There will also be a large number of uniformed police officers in Atlanta. Some officials, privately, have raised 
concern about how the Atlanta Police Department, with its relatively small force of only 1,550 officers, will be 
able to handle their share of protecting venues, control traffic and still be able to tend to providing everyday 
police service to the city. Morale of the department is also an issue. (A subject of a past ENN report.)<br>
<br>
As a precaution, Olympic officials conducted a two-year, worldwide recruitment drive to get 2,400 volunteer 
police officers to assist at the games. The volunteers, (Some are from the Chicago area) will have to pay for the 
expense to get to the games, but they will receive free lodgings and meals.<br>
<br>
The recruitment drive attracted 9,000 applicants from 50 diffent countries from around the world. William 
Rathburn, the director of security for the Olympic Games, said that sixty percent of the volunteers will come 
from police agencies in other countries. More than 300 of the volunteers hold the rank of police chief. Some are 
coming from as far away as Australia, Norway and South Africa. Rathburn said, &quot;I was amazed at the response 
and the kind of people we were getting.&quot;<br>
<br>
The volunteer security force will not be armed but will wear its own distinctive Olympic uniform. The largest 
force of security personnel will come from the federal government. Agents from the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and the U.S. Customs Service 
will be drawn from all across the U.S.<br>
<br>
The U.S. Justice Department has assigned Gil Childers, who was the lead prosecutor in the World Trade 
Center bombing, to head its part in the security planning. The U.S. Attorney in Atlanta said, &quot;If things hit the fan, 
there are clear chains of command that lead to a handoff to the FBI.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hopefully, that won't be necessary.</p>

<font size=5><strong>Statistical &quot;Blip&quot;, Coincidence, or Information Warfare??</strong></font><br>
By: C. Staten, Senior Analyst<br>
<IMG SRC="/hussein3.gif" align=right>
<br>
(ENN) Computer statistics, gathered by the Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute (ERRI), would indicate that the 
number of reported terrorist acts (particularly those allegedly perpetrated by Moslem extremists) has decreased 
significantly in the days since the beginning of the current Iraq/USA crisis. It is currently unknown if this is merely a 
&quot;statistical blip&quot; relating to concentrated media attention on the Gulf crisis, or if it is part of a larger (state-supported) plan to 
discontinue terrorist operations that might distract the world's attention from events in Iraq.<br>
<br>
It should be noted that the statistical information studied by the ERRI computer terrorism tracking program is provided by 
means of &quot;open sources&quot; and that it reflects (at least to a certain extent) on selected media coverage of current events. 
Nonetheless, the computer program reports that there is a significant drop in the number of reported incidents. Meanwhile, 
the level of world terrorist &quot;rhetoric&quot; (also studied and considered by the ERRI computer program) continues at a high 
level, much of it critical of, and reacting to US actions in the Iraq situation. <br>
<br>
The implications of this trend are not completely understood at this time, and are still being studied by ERRI, but it would 
appear clear to our analysts that there is a concerted &quot;information warfare&quot; effort underway to undermine the prestige and 
reputation of the United States in the Mid-East. By doing so, it is hoped, by adversaries of the United States, that a 
&quot;wedge&quot; can be driven between the members of the 1991 Desert Storm coalition and that strained relations and less 
multilateral cooperation will result. Ultimately, we believe that these actions relate to those that are busily at work, trying to 
cause &quot;disengagement&quot; and &quot;withdrawal&quot; of all American forces in the Gulf area.<br>

<H2>EmergencyNet Imitator Opens New Web Service</H2>
By Steve Macko, EmergencyNet News Managing Editor
<P>

The prestigious Chicago law firm of Mora and Baugh, Ltd. today announced that they have issued a legal challenge to the opening of a new emergency service website with a name and concept similar to that of ERRI and its EmergencyNet News Service.  According to Mr. Frank Nagorka, attorney for the Chicago-based Emergency Response & Research Institute, Web Business Systems, Inc. of Farmingdale, NY (DBA EMERGENCYNET) has been issued a cease and desist notice for infringing on the intellectual property, name, and registered servicemark of the EmergencyNet News service.
<P>
According to a Nagorka, EMERGENCYNET/Web Business systems, Inc. was requested by fax and certified mail on February 13th, 1996 to discontinue the use of the "EmergencyNet" name prior to the opening of their site, and they had allegedly agreed to do so. The cause of action occurred on Feburary 15th, when their site went into full operation, using the "EmergencyNet" name and offering to provide services similar in nature to the already existing EmergencyNet News Service and the Emergency Response & Research Institute website....all while using the "EmergencyNet" name.
<P>
Clark Staten, Publisher of the EmergencyNet News Service, said that he is extremely disappointed that Mr. Rusty McCormick and the people at Web Business Systems, Inc. didn't keep their word and choose a new name for their site.  "We have spent almost five years and thousands of dollars developing name recognition for the concept of  EmergencyNet and our unique news service, and now it is just taken from us," Staten said.  "I'm afraid that the Web Business System's decision to use our name will lead to customer confusion and allow them to take advantage of our good reputation and past advertising efforts,", he continued.  "I wouldn't be half so upset, but we did advise them prior to their grand opening that they were using our name, and asked them to stop...and yet they still proceeded."
<P>
Mr. Nagorka said he has provided copies of the ERRI servicemark registrations (see picture below) and other correspondence to Web Business Systems, Inc. and is awaiting a formal reply before additional legal action is taken. He said that injunctive relief and monetary damages can be awarded when a party fails to heed a cease and desist request, with respect to a specific servicemark.
<P>
Staten concluded his comments by saying that he hopes that the issue can be settled quickly and amicably, with a mutually agreeable reaffirmation of ERRI's rights to the "EmergencyNet" name.  If not, Nagorka said that he is considering a number of legal options that are open to ERRI.

<H3>Bomb Found in Newark Medical Center</H3>
An explosive device was found at about 1300 EST in a third floor
hallway of the Medical Sciences Building at the University of
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ), located at South Orange
Avenue near Bergen Street in Newark, New Jersey.
<P>
The device was detonated in place by the Newark bomb squad.  No
injuries were reported. Structural damage to the building was reported by Newark Firefighters, following the planned detonation by the EOD personnel.
<P> 
Speculation regarding the motive for the bomb involves either a disgruntled employee or revenge by drug dealers, who are upset with UMDNJ for their recent public reports regarding "bad heroin" that has been circulating in Newark. An investigation continues, and Newark police reportedly have suspects that they want to interview.

<p><font size=5><strong>GANG VIOLENCE IN MIAMI</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
Since the Emergency Response and Research Institute is based in Chicago, we write quite a few reports about the 
gang-related violence that occurs in America's third largest city. Just this past weekend, there was twenty homicides 
committed in Chicago. A large percentage of those murders were gang-related.<br>
<br>
But as we have reported before, gang violence happens in every major city in the U.S. Three years ago, gang-related 
shootings began to plague an impoverished neighborhood in Miami, Florida, known as &quot;Little Haiti.&quot; As its name would 
suggest, a large percentage of the people residing in this area located in the northern part of the city, came from the 
Caribbean nation of Haiti.<br>
<br>
The violence in this neighborhood has been escalating. In one incident, more than 100 bullets were fired into one member 
of a rival gang. Since then, the pace of drive-by shootings and shootings happening in people's backyards has increased.<br>
<br>
The latest gang-related homicide in the area occurred earlier this month. So far, there have been seven murders this year 
and 18 in the past three years. That may not sound like a lot for an area such as the 11th police district in Chicago that has 
a population of about 100,000 people. But Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood has an estimated population of about 40,000 
people.<br>
<br>
Dade County Police Captain Joe Fleites said, &quot;You have never seen any real serious problems coming out of the Haitian 
community for many years. This is something new.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The problems we're experiencing right now have less to do with these kids be Haitian than with these kids being socialized 
into American society by the failed public school system and with the pressures of urban America,&quot; said the Reverend 
Thomas Wenski, who is the pastor of Miami's largest Haitian church.<br>
<br>
Police officers in Miami say that there are two street gangs with about 150 members who are fighting over the usual &quot;drug 
turf.&quot; They are terrorizing the neighborhood and are very well armed with AK-47s, Tec-9s and various 9mm and 
.45-caliber handguns. They commit murders, armed robberies and car thefts.<br>
<br>
As mentioned before, in February, one 22-year-old man was riddled with more than 100 bullets on a quiet street in the 
area. Most of the victims have been gangbangers. But innocent people have also been killed in the wave of violence. One 
of those innocent victims was a mother of six who was shot and killed outside of a church. Another was a truck driver who 
was just delivering bread to a store. Another victim attributed to the gangs was a store clerk who was robbed and then 
shot to death.<br>
<br>
The Chicago Tribune on Tuesday released the results of a survey that showed most American's perceive that violent crime 
is rising. However, statistics have been showing a downward trend for the last four years. But even if the statistics do show 
a decrease, it doesn't help a 13-year boy who lives in the Little Haiti neighborhood who sadly related, &quot;People are kind of 
scared. That's why I stay home. I only go outside for important things.&quot;<br>
<br>
As the author of a large number of articles about gang violence in the United States, nothing upsets me more than to hear 
that certain residents of a neighborhood are actually afraid to go outside of their homes or to allow their children to even 
play in their yards because thugs have taken control of an area. If they go outside they are taking the chance that they will 
be caught in the cross fire between rival gangs. Most of us cannot imagine thinking that it is not unusual to hear multiple 
gunshots EVERY NIGHT. Not knowing if a bullet is going to come through your window. It is an extremely sad 
commentary about life in urban America.<br>
<br>
Dade County Police have assigned two dozen officers to gang investigations. They report that they are having very little 
luck in solving the shootings. Said one officer, who works in the Little Haiti neighborhood, &quot;We don't have any witnesses.&quot; 
The officer added that witnesses are afraid of gang retaliation if they assist the authorities.</p>

<H2>ANTIBIOTICS BEFORE YOUR OPERATION?</H2>

Chicago,IL - (ENN) A study by the LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City,
Utah indicates that thousands of surgical patients could be
saved from post operative infections by the timely
administration of antibiotics just prior to the surgery. The
study, conducted in Salt Lake City during the past year,
evaluated the operative treatment of 2,847 people.
<P>

The study found that by giving intravenous antibiotics just
prior to the start of a surgical procedure, the number of
infections dropped by as much as 50%.  It also suggested that
it is important that this occur within two (2) hours of the
start of the operation to be most effective.  Dr. David
Classen, of the LDS Hospital, said that this minor change of
the administration of the infection fighting drugs has
changed the course of many post operative complications. Dr.
Classen also said that this seemingly simple idea has also
reduced post-operative disability and saved hundreds of
thousands of healthcare dollars.
<P>

The report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
said that as many as 920,000 people suffer annually from the
effects of post operative infections.  A commentary from Dr.
Richard Wenzel of the University of Iowa Hospitals, which
accompanied the study, said that this change could save as
much as $1.5 million dollars that are spent on the treatment
of infections each year.  Dr. Wenzel also commented that the
most advantageous result can be obtained by insuring high
blood levels of antibiotics just prior to the start of the
operation.
<P>

According to Dr. Classen, there are few contraindications for
this procedure, except allergies to the antibiotics
themselves. This difficulty can be prevented by assuring that
the appropriate medications for each patient are given,
according to the doctors.  Both Dr. Classen and Dr. Wenzel
said that this idea should be undertaken everywhere at the
earliest opportunity.

<H3>RENEWED TERRORIST OFFENSIVE</H3>
Chicago, IL. An alleged call from Palestinian "terror-mastermind" Abu
Abbas appears to have been made in response to the reported
U.S. precision bombing of an Iraqi command and control bunker
in Baghdad.  During the past twenty-four (24) hours, some of
the more traditional (i.e. long-standing) insurgent groups
have targeted U.S. facilities in Bonn, Germany and Santiago,
Chile.  Reportedly, this signals a change in insurgent
activity to a higher level.
<P>

Mounting evidence indicates that the configuration of the
"civilian air-raid shelter" in Baghdad, was a communication
and control bunker that had been specially "hardened" for
that purpose.  Military and intelligence sources have
reported that pictures of the interior of the building
demonstrate the use of air-conditioning, data and
communication cables, and other capabilities that would only
be used in a communications facility.
<P>  

A spokeman from the U.S.  Army Corp of Engineers, who 
asked to remain anonymous, said that the mere configuration of 
the construction of the bunker showed that it had significant similarities 
to those commonly constructed for military headquarters.  He pointed
out that the roof was camouflaged, constructed of several
feet of heavily reinforced concrete, and was surrounded by
barbed-war and security fences.  HUMINTEL (Human
intelligence) sources have reported that the building had
been guarded by armed troops and certain portions of the
building were compartmentalized to provide protection against
chemical weapons.
<P>

A Chicago based anti-terrorist analyst reported that he
believes that Saddam Hussein is using the Baghdad bunker
incident as "black propaganda" in a campaign to incite
fundementalist Moslem groups to riot in Coalition partners
and to prompt insurgent operatives to action.  "An
independent analysis of the number of casualties would
indicate that there were far fewer civilians involved in the
incident than are reported, and that Hussein may have
purposely `arranged' the `martyrdom' of these innocent
people", said Clark Staten of the Emergency Response and
Research Institute of Chicago (ERRI).
<P>

"Hussein has been using `Human Shields' since the beginning
of this conflict....it is not unreasonable that he allowed
them to be used as targets in an elaborate propaganda
campaign", Staten continued. "More interesting is the fact
that no source has reported any military casualties in the
incident....a reasonable and prudent observer would suggest
that this is most unusual", the analyst said.  "To suggest
otherwise is to disregard the history and threats of Saddam
Hussein", Staten concluded.
<P>
Reportedly, "spontaneous demonstrations" occured in Iraq,
Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon as a consequence to the
alleged targeting of the "civilian bunker".  According to
CNN's Peter Arnett, numerous Iraqis were marching through the
streets and firing weapons.  He also reported that the crowd
was calling for revenge for the bombing of the bunker in
Baghdad.  The Associated Press and Rueters both reported that
the Baghdad bunker incident has caused increasing unrest
among fundementalist Moslems in other Middle-Eastern cities.
<P>

In a related story, the U. S. Embassy in Bonn, German
received automatic weapons fire from a position that was
located fifty (50) meters from the Embassy buildings.
According to German police sources, a note was left behind
in which the "Red Army Faction" claimed responsibility fro
the attack.  Embassy officials report that there were no
injuries, but that at least fifteen (15) rounds did strike
the building. A note left nearby, with the emblem of the
groups, stated that this attack was in retribution for the
conflict in the Persian Gulf.
<P>

On Thursday, least three separate explosions occured in
Athens and Thessaloniki, Greece.  Police sources reported
that two separate incidents, which occured twenty (20)
minutes apart, were beleived related to an unnamed terrorist
organization that had "infiltrated" Greece and has
perpetrated at least fourteen (14) individual incidents since
the start of the Persian Gulf war.
<P>

Also early on Thursday morning, Israeli time, Igal Carnon of
the Prime Minister Shamir's office issued a warning that, "we
can expect a big increase in terrorist activities in the next
few weeks". He also called for increased surveillance of
embassies and government related buildings. Mr. Carnon
reported that the movement of "revolutionary operatives" was
noted and that guerilla radio communications had increased in
the vicinity of the Israeli/Lebanese border.

<H2>French Police Under Attack</H2>
<P>
Chicago, IL, (ENN) October 15, 1995 --In what is being described by
French government officials as an event "unconnected to the
latest series of Islamic extremist attacks", a car rigged with a
propane cylinder exploded in the Paris suburb of Le Blanc-Mesnil
on Saturday. French police union leaders disagree and say that
the blast was the result of "anti-police ambush."  A
spokesperson for the SGP (General Police Union) said that they
had had received an anonymous call for a man trapped in a
burning car.
<P> 
Upon their arrival, they found the burning car, but it had been
stolen and no one was found inside. Instead, a propane gas tank
was seen on the seat just prior to an explosion. Four police
officers were reported to be slightly injured by the detonation.
Police say that they believe it was a "setup", because just
moments before, district firefighters had been called to a false
alarm on the other side of town.
<P> 
French government officials reportedly said that an
investigation of the incident was being handled by local police,
rather than special anti-terrorist forces, because they saw no
direct links" to seven (7) other bombings that have occurred in
Paris and Lyons in recent days. SGP leader Jean-Louis Arajol was
quoted by the Reuters News service as saying that this attack
was "another signal that criminals were forsaking low-level
violence and imitating guerrilla methods." 
<P>
Arajol also warned French President Jacques Chirac not to get
involved in Algerian politics and the upcoming presidential
elections in Algeria. He said that a scheduled meeting between
Chirac and Algerian General and President Liamine Zeroual at the
UN 50th Anniversary celebration in New York City could appear to
lend support to Zeroual as a candidate and to further enflame
Moslem inspired violence.
<P>  
In a related story, the French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche,
in its Sunday edition, said that the Armed Islamic Group (GIA)
has issued a warning of further bombings of Paris landmarks and
assassinations of unfriendly French journalists. Specific
targets reportedly included the Eiffel Tower, Place de la
Concorde, and several fashionable Paris department stores. A
list of threatened journalists, most of them television
commentators, was not released.
<P> 
To backup the Le Journal du Dimanche report, a similar threat
was issued in a GIA newsletter that was quoted in London, on
Sunday, by the Arabic-language Al-Hayat newspaper. In the
article, GIA sources said that the bombings in Paris would
continue unless France discontinued its support for the military
backed government in Algeria. The Al-Hayat article reportedly
also featured a cartoon of the Eiffel Tower exploding.

<pre><font size=6><strong>    &quot;MIXING IT UP AT THE MALL&quot;</strong></font>
                 By Clark Staten, EMT-P, I/C
</pre>
<pre>You are the Paramedic Officer in charge of an advanced life
support ambulance in a largely residential neighborhood of a
Mid-Western urban area. It has been a normal early December
shift, for the most part, since you began your shift at 0800
hrs. this morning. The weather is partly cloudy, and the
temperature is 38 degrees.  You and your partner have checked
and cleaned all of your equipment, washed the ambulance, and
responded to one call for a 87 year old female that was found
in cardiac arrest when the family woke up this morning. No
one had spoken to her since the night before and she was
cool, in asystole, and had post mortem lividity.  She was
soon pronounced DOA by your medical control authority and is
now a brief memory in an otherwise uneventful morning.</pre>
<pre>At approximately 1142 hrs., while returning from getting fuel
for the ambulance, the radio crackles to life, &quot;Ambulance
18... Ambulance 18...respond now to a report of fumes in the
building at 7601 S. Cicero Rd. ...that's 7601 S. Cicero Rd.
in the shopping mall ... got it Ambulance 18?&quot; You grab the
microphone and acknowledge the call; &quot;Message
received...Ambulance 18...you got anything more on that?&quot;
Both you and your partner began to wonder what &quot;fumes in a
building&quot; means.</pre>
<pre>Your partner starts flipping switches for the emergency
lights and siren, as you grab the clipboard and begin to fill
out the preliminary information on the run report.  The radio
beeps and says, &quot;Ambulance 18... the wind is out of the
Southwest at 8-10 miles per hour...you are getting a
preliminary Haz-Mat response there...Ambulance 18&quot;.  You set
the clipboard in your lap, and acknowledge the call. You and
your partner begin to hypothesize on the source of the call;
your partner says, &quot;I'll bet it is carbon monoxide...we've
had a bunch of that already this year&quot;.  You agree, thinking
about a recent carbon monoxide incident that killed a family
of ten while they slept.</pre>
<pre>Upon arrival at the shopping mall, you note that the reported
address is that of a popular fast-food restaurant, which is
connected to the rest of the mall by a hallway.  Two fire
suppression companies are already on the scene, but you don't
see any of the firefighters. One of the first things that you
should consider when responding to any reported hazardous
materials incident is:</pre>
<pre>(Editorial note - &quot;*&quot; indicates the correct answer)
</pre>
<pre>                 ( PICK THE BEST ANSWER -ONLY )
(1)
    A&gt; Call Chemtrec (1-800-424-9300) and get advice
    B&gt; Go on in the building and see if there are any
       patients
    C&gt; Assess the true nature and severity of the incident *
    D&gt; Look for the firemen, and ask them what to do next
    E&gt; Call dispatch for a EMS disaster plan</pre>
<pre>Among the first and one of the most important pieces of
information that you will need to effectively manage the
medical response to a hazardous material event is:</pre>
<pre>(2)
    A&gt; Understanding of your jurisdiction's Haz-Mat plan
    B&gt; Identification of the product that is involved *
    C&gt; A history and physical of the striken patient
    D&gt; The location of your &quot;Hazardous Material Response
       Guide&quot; book
    E&gt; The patients' vital signs</pre>
<pre>Back to the mall...</pre>
<pre>A Fire Lieutenant comes out of the building, pulls off his
SCBA mask, and yells at you, &quot;Hey, Ambulance 18... we've got
people down in there!&quot; &quot;They were attempting to clean the
floor and walls with a mixture of cleaning products...there
are fumes&quot;.  On your rig radio, you overhear the Lieutenant
reporting, &quot;Engine 38 to the fire alarm office...we have a
confirmed Haz-Mat...give me a Level One Hazardous Materials
Response&quot;.  Do you?</pre>
<pre>(3)
   A&gt; Immediately get your &quot;jumpkit&quot; and drugbox and hurry
      into the mall
   B&gt; Put on your fire coat, boots, helmet and gloves - then
      hurry into the mall
   C&gt; Call for an EMS Disaster plan
   D&gt; Ask the Lt. what cleaning products were involved *
   E&gt; Request the immediate response of an EMS Supervisor</pre>
<pre>(4)  One of the most important pieces of equipment that MUST
     be used if you want to enter the mall, that has been
     described above, is?</pre>
<pre>   A&gt; Cardiac Monitor w/ defibrillator
   B&gt; Oxygen cylinder and positive pressure ventilator
   C&gt; Your portable radio
   D&gt; Your &quot;turn-out&quot; gear
   E&gt; Your Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus *
</pre>
<pre>You watch, amazed, as a fully &quot;suited-up&quot; firefighter
stumbles from an entrance to the mall, dragging a 24 year
old, seemingly unconscious male.  You hear the Lieutenant on
the radio, &quot;Engine 38 to Ambulance 18... report to the West
entrance of the building...we've got a patient for you!...
got that Ambulance 18?&quot;.</pre>
<pre>The activity at the scene seems to be accelerating.
You acknowledge the transmission on your portable radio, as
you and your partner are donning your &quot;turn-out&quot; gear.
Several other fire suppression units are arriving on the
scene.  You have not been issued any self-contained breathing
apparatus.  You note that a firefighter has begun to
administer oxygen to the unconscious young man with a
positive pressure ventilator.</pre>
<pre>Assuming that you haven't already &quot;blundered&quot; into this
potentially contaminated area, as you might have been
inclined to do prior to this question, do you now?</pre>
<pre>(5)
   A&gt; Again ask the Lieutenant of Engine 38, on the radio, if
      the products involved have been identified *
   B&gt; Immediately follow the directions of the Lieutenant,
      report to the West entrance, and begin treating the
      patient
   C&gt; Ask the dispatch center about the Estimated Time of
      Arrival (ETA) of your EMS Supervisor
   D&gt; Request an EMS Disaster Plan
   E&gt; Request two additional ambulances and go to treat the
      patient</pre>
<pre>(After performing the answer to #5 above), you are loading
your ALS equipment on your stretcher.  A transmission comes
over your portable radio. &quot;Ambulance 18...Ambulance
18...Battalion 19 to Ambulance 18...the products involved are
ammonia and household bleach...mixed in unknown quanities&quot;,
the Chief of the 19th Battalion advises you.  Battalion 19
must now be on the scene and has assumed command of the
incident.  &quot;Message received...  Battalion 19...bleach and
ammonia&quot;, you entone into your portable.</pre>
<pre>Simultaneously, another radio transmission blasts through one
of the now busy radio frequencies, &quot;Truck 15 to Battalion
19...Truck 15 to Battalion 19...we have three more
people down in here...we are bringing them out now!&quot;.
Battalion 19 acknowledges the transmission and passes it to
you on your frequency.  Your mind now begins to go into
&quot;high-gear&quot;... what happens when you mix ammonia and bleach?
Nothing...or does it produce a more toxic end-product?</pre>
<pre>(6) The combination of (even household strength) ammonia and
    bleach can produce an extremely toxic gas called:</pre>
<pre>   A&gt; Anhydrous Ammonia Gas
   B&gt; Cyanide Gas
   C&gt; Nitrogen compounds
   D&gt; Chloramine  *
   E&gt; Sodium Chloride</pre>
<pre>(7) The type of reactivity that occurs is due to the fact
    that Ammonia gas becomes a ________________ material when
    mixed with Chlorine:</pre>
<pre>   A&gt; Binary Reactant *
   B&gt; Neutralizing
   C&gt; Potentiating
   D&gt; Lacrimating
   E&gt; Pathogenetic</pre>
<pre>(8)  You should give primary consideration to the fact that
     this by-product of combination of ammonia and bleach
     produces an agent that is very similar in nature and
     action to:</pre>
<pre>   A&gt; WWII Mustard gas *
   B&gt; Modern Nerve Gases
   C&gt; Organophosphate Poisoning
   D&gt; Carbon Monoxide poisoning
   E&gt; Sulfuric Acid
</pre>
<pre>Several firefighters have carried a total of four patients to
an area immediately adjacent to the West entrance to the
mall.  You and your partner have gathered all of your
equipment and are quickly approaching the firefighters and
patients. The firefighters are providing oxygen by positive
pressure mask to the striken patients. You notice that at
least one firefighter has removed his self-contained
breathing apparatus while working on the patients. The next
MOST APPROPRIATE action that should be taken is:</pre>
<pre>(9)
   A&gt; Begin advanced life support (ALS) procedures
   B&gt; Intubate the patients, due to the fact that may soon
      experience respiratory failure
   C&gt; Have the firefighters disrobe and decontaminate them and the
      patients *
   D&gt; Begin Intravenous therapy, so that you have the ability
      to administer specific antidotes
   E&gt; Contact your EMS supervisor on the radio and ask
      him/her what to do
</pre>
<pre>The department Hazardous Materials Team has arrived on the
scene and is alerting the firefighters, that are still in the
mall, that the combination of ammonia and bleach can also
produce another undesired effect.</pre>
<pre>True or False ?    T    or   F     (Circle One)</pre>
<pre>(10)
   The combination of ammonia and bleach can react violently
   and/or spontaneously explosively. (*T)
</pre>
<pre>The firefighters have begun to ventilate the building, and
you could possibly expect that a faint odor of
(#10)_______________ would be detected in the surrounding
area.</pre>
<pre>(11)
   A&gt; Garlic
   B&gt; Almonds
   C&gt; Cherrys
   D&gt; Ether
   E&gt; Herring *</pre>
<pre>Members of the Hazardous Materials Team have disrobed and
washed the patients with mild soap and water. They have
continued to administer oxygen to them. As they are cleaned
and turned over to you, your next responsibility should be
to:</pre>
<pre>(12)
   A&gt; Begin BLS procedures
   B&gt; Begin ALS procedures
   C&gt; Adminster sodium thiosulfate, IV push, 5mg/kg
   D&gt; Administer Amyl Nitrate Ampules - one every 5 minutes
   E&gt; Perform triage *</pre>
<pre>Next in your treatment of the patients, (after completion of
#12), you could expect to be primarily concerning with the
treatment of:</pre>
<pre>(13)
   A&gt; Cardiac Compromise
   B&gt; Dermatological Problems
   C&gt; Nuerotoxic conditions
   D&gt; Respiratory difficulties *
   E&gt; Carcinogen effects</pre>
<pre>Secondarily, pre-hospital personnel in the above set of
circumstances, may find it necessary to treat previously
decontaminated patients for:</pre>
<pre>(14)
    A&gt; Signifigant systemic poisoning through absorption
    B&gt; Cardiac compromise *
    C&gt; Long-term Psychogenic manifestations
    D&gt; High Blood Pressure
    E&gt; Major changes in Serum urea nitrogen</pre>
<pre>One could logically expect that patients exposed to a
combination of ammonia and bleach could potentially also need
to be treated for the long-term complications of exposure to
chlorine, ammonia, and chloramines. They generally include
all of the following... EXCEPT :</pre>
<pre>(15)
    A&gt; Hearing loss
    B&gt; Cytotoxicity
    C&gt; DNA Damage &amp; Chromosome aberration
    D&gt; Hair loss
    E&gt; Neurotoxicity *
    F&gt; Delayed pulmonary edema
    G&gt; Asthma &amp; COPD
    H&gt; Pneumonitis</pre>
<pre>High flow humidified oxygen should continue to be afforded
the patients, during stabalization and transport. Symptomatic
treatment of cardiac arrythmias should be undertaken.
Narcotics and caffine should be avoided in treating these
patients. Some improvement has been anecdotally shown with
early respiratory symptoms of chlorine exposure, by
administering 3.75% Sodium Bicarbonate solution by nebulizer
treatment.  Pre-hospital providers should follow local system
protocals, or treat the patients as determined by a
authorized consulting physician.</pre>
<pre>After decontamination, triage, treatment, and consultation
with a physician who is knowledgable in toxicology issues,
the patients can be transported to the appropriate definitive
care facility.  Only by making appropriate pre-hospital care
determinations, can the patient hope for the optimal outcome
and eventual recovery.  Those decisions will be based on good
information resources and procedures that must be developed
and implemented in a minimum of time.</pre>
<pre>The case study presented above is more common than you might
imagine, and the potential for these circumstances exists
throughout the United States and the world. <strong>Are YOU educationally and
operationally prepared for YOUR next Hazardous Materials
incident?</strong></pre>

<H2>NY Governor Pataki Takes on Bronx D.A. In Death Penalty Case</H2>
By: JIM FAY ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

Chicago, IL, March 19, 1996 (ENN) -- Governor George Pataki of
New York today sent a scathing letter to Bronx County District
Attorney Robert Johnson asking whether he is capable of
prosecuting a capital murder case that could result in the death
penalty.
<P>

In a letter sent to DA Johnson dated March 19th, Gov. Pataki
refers to the recent death of NYPD Officer Kevin Gillespie,
which occurred on March 16th in the Bronx, and to Johnson's
publicly stated stand against the death penalty.  Johnson has
said previously that he would not seek the death penalty in any
Capital Case in Bronx County, stating that it was his "statutory
 discretion" not to.
<P>

However, Pataki, calling Officer Gillespie's shooting by three
carjackers, a "...brutal murder," and "...cold blooded," in his
letter to Johnson, stating that "...the people (of NYS) have
spoken," and "the death penalty is the law in New York State,
and was intended to apply in just the sort of circumstances
presented by the murder of Officer Gillespie."
<P>

In the letter, Pataki also refers to Johnson's public refusal to
seek the death penalty for Michael Vernon, who was arrested in
The Bronx for the mass murder of eight customers in a shoe store
during the 1995 Christmas shopping season.  "At that time," says
Pataki, "I accepted, albeit with serious reservations, your
representation that your decision not to seek the death penalty
was based on your  'statutory discretion'." 
<P>

In Johnson's defense, there have been reports that Vernon was suffering from
mental problems that he had refused to be treated for. This
could have negated any death penalty sentence, had DA Johnson
sought it. Many in the strife-ridden community where Vernon had
allegedly killed eight (8) people have been calling for the
death penalty in the Vernon case.
<P>

Governor Pataki's letter to DA Johnson ends with a pointed and
direct question to Johnson:  "Are there circumstances under
which you will seek the death penalty in Bronx County?"
<P>

Governor Pataki is empowered to remove any local District 
Attorney and appoint a special prosecutor for a particular case
if the governor feels that the DA is not in a position to
prosecute the case within the law. There have been reports that
Pataki is seriously  considering this move in the Gillespie
case, and the letter to Johnson would seem to be a preliminary
move to do so.  If Johnson answers Pataki that he will not,
under any circumstances, seek the death penalty in Bronx County,
it is the feeling that Pataki will remove Johnson from the
prosecution of those arrested for PO Gillespie's murder.
<P>

The individuals arrested for the murder of Gillespie were out on
parole, and have long records for violent crimes, one of whom
has a conviction for a previous murder. Pataki, in his formal letter to Johnson, requested that Johnson
reply to the Governor's Counsel, regarding the matter by "1:00 p.m. tomorrow," which
is Wednesday, March 20th.

<font size=5><strong>CHICAGO AUTHORITIES PLAN WELL; 
ORDER MAINTAINED</strong></font><br>
<br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
CHICAGO (ENN) - Five thousand Chicago Police officers worked to keep celebrations under control 
on Sunday night after the Chicago Bulls defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 87-75 to win their fourth 
NBA championship in six years. There were sporadic reports of looting and isolated violent incidents, 
mostly on the city's West and South Sides. Officers dressed in riot gear appeared to do a very good job 
in keeping any widespread mayhem down to a minimum.<br>
<br>
Police were ready and they had two dress rehearsals in the past week for Sunday's operation. In past 
years, the police operated on what they called a modified New Year's Eve plan. It was determined that 
plan was inadequate to combat the disturbances that occurred in past years. After the Bulls won the 
championship in 1992, 1,000 people were arrested and 200 people were injured in widespread 
violence and looting. This year, the CPD devised a new, much tougher plan to deal with any rowdy 
behavior and it appeared to work much better. Sunday night's extra security cost Chicago about $1.5 
million. The total city expense for the three night's of extra security is expected to come to about $3.2 
million.<br>
<br>
Calls to the Chicago 911 Emergency Communications Center on the city's near West Side peaked 
during the first hour right after the end of the game, between 2100 and 2200 CDT. By midnight, the call 
volume had returned to about normal.<br>
<br>
There were many isolated incidents. The Chicago Police Department's 15th District on the West Side 
was kept very busy. All total, 100 people were arrested in Chicago. A total of ten people were shot in 
eight different shooting incidents -- three of the ten victims were fatally shot. There were many, many 
shots fired in celebration of the Bulls victory. Police believe, however, that seven of the ten victims shot 
had no connection to the celebration. In other words, they were not victims of accidental shootings.<br>
<br>
One of the shootings happened at 2211 CDT in the 7th Police District at 6543 South Sangamon Street 
on Chicago's South Side. Another happened at 2300 CDT on the West Side at Cicero Avenue and 
Washington Street in the 15th District.<br>
<br>
After leaving the basketball game, one woman was shot twice in the face by errant gunfire while she was 
driving home on South California Avenue. She was taken to Mount Sinai Medical Center.<br>
<br>
One drug store on the city's West Side was looted. When police officers arrived on the scene, about 75 
to 100 youths began to pelt the officers with rocks and bottles. No officers were injured in this incident, 
but there was a stand-off between the police and the youths that lasted for more than an hour.<br>
<br>
Several police and fire vehicles throughout the city were damaged by rocks and bottles. One Chicago 
Fire Department member was reported injured by a flying missile.<br>
<br>
On the fire department side of things, South Side EMS units were very busy handling a large number of 
calls. Fire units on Chicago's West Side handled a number of fires, especially in the 13th battalion. At 
2121 CDT, there a working fire at 203 North Kostner Avenue. A 2-story vacant wood frame dwelling 
was reported to be fully involved. While still working at the above mentioned blaze, the chief of the 13th 
battalion, himself, reported a working fire at 4409 West Maypole Avenue. There was another good 
working fire at about 2300 CDT in the 18th battalion on the city's South Side at 1008 West 71st Street.<br>
<br>
The fire department placed a number of extra ambulances and engine companies in service for the 
evening. There was a large number of rubbish and car fires reported in various portions of the city.<br>
<br>
One of the more serious incidents reported by the fire department was at 82nd Street and Halsted 
Street on Chicago's South Side at 2143 CDT. Engine Company 73 reported a person hit by a car and a 
gang fight/mob scene involving several people. Engine 73 became the victim of thrown bottles and had 
to pull out of the area until police arrived.<br>
<br>
Other reported incidents occurred at 2150 CDT when a car with six male balcks attempted to run down 
a police officer in the street at 47th Street and Indiana Avenue on the South Side. At 2314 CDT, a store 
was looted and bottles were thrown at the police at 18th Street and Homan Avenue on the West Side.</p>

<H3>Four Dead In Englewood Crash</H3>
<P>
In Englewood, Colorado at 2100 MST on Thursday night a single car rolled 
over and caught on fire at Northbound South Platte River Drive at Dartmouth 
just upon entering the Denver city limits has left 4 dead and 1 critical.
<P>

Upon arrival of the first units, the car was fully involved in fire with 2
occupants still trapped and 3 already ejected. Both occupants inside the car
were DOA from massive trauma, burns and smoke. One of the patients that was
ejected was transported to Swedish Medical Center with burns and massive
trauma.  He remains in critical condition this morning. Both other patients
that were ejected were pronounced DOA on-scene. The investigation continues into the cause, but high speed and alcohol are suspected.
<P>

Another accident on Thursday in Denver has left a 2 month-old baby in 
critical condition at Denver General Hospital with a fractured skull. 
The child was in a rear facing child seat in the front passenger seat of a 
minivan. Upon impact, the passenger side air bag pushed the otherwise 
properly restrained child into the back of the passenger seat. Please be 
careful with passenger side air bags and infant restraints!

<br>
<em><strong>The situation in brief as of </strong></em><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>8:00 p.m. (EDT) Monday, July 8, 1996</strong></em></font><em><strong>:</strong></em><br>
<br>
Preliminary reports from federal disaster response personnel in the U.S. Virgin Islands indicate numerous homes 
have been damaged, many of them still undergoing repairs from Hurricane Marilyn. All three airports are closed, 
and navigational instruments at the airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico are operating only for emergency landings 
on one runway. Air traffic control has been turned over to FAA controllers in Miami.<br>
<br>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is responsible for coordinating the federal 
government's disaster response efforts, has put its Emergency Support Team (EST) at FEMA headquarters in 
Washington on 24-hour operations. The EST is continuing to alert, activate and deploy federal resources and 
disaster teams as necessary and will make mission assignments to other federal agencies as special needs are 
determined.<br>
<br>
Among EST priorities over the next 24 hours are the development of contingency plans for the evacuation of the 
estimated 2,800 tourists on St. Thomas.<br>
<br>
The governors of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico have submitted requests for Presidential disaster 
declarations through the appropriate FEMA officials.<br>
<br>
With the resources of FEMA Region IV headquarters in Atlanta fully committed to preparing for potential 
emergencies connected with the Olympic Games, coordination of the disaster response to Hurricane Bertha will 
be spearheaded by Region VI (Denton, Tex.), with Region VIII (Denver, Colo.) and Region X (Bothell, 
Wash.), and additional FEMA Regions in reserve.<br>
<br>
A FEMA Field Assessment Team (FasT) is en route to St. Thomas via military air transport. Two additional 
FEMA damage assessment teams have been alerted for possible U.S. mainland duty.<br>
<br>
FEMA's Urban Search and Rescue (US&amp;R) task force in Nebraska has been placed on alert, replacing the 
US&amp;R task force from Metro-Dade County, Fla., which may be needed closer to home if Hurricane Bertha 
strikes southeastern Florida. <br>
<br>
The Department of Transportation has activated a Movement Coordination Center to manage transportation 
logistics for response personnel and equipment deployed to the disaster areas as required.<br>
<br>
The U.S. Public Health Service has designated Disaster Medical Assistance Teams from Texas, Ohio, Indiana 
and Massachussetts to respond as required, as well as a Medical Support Unit from Dobbins Air Force Base in 
Georgia.<br>
<br>
The Internet has become an increasingly popular source of hurricane-related information. FEMA's World Wide 
Web site (http://www.fema.gov) today experienced a ten thousand percent increase in use, registering 
approximately 1 million accesses in a 16-hour period.<br>

<TITLE>Ground War Progesses Successfully</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->

<BODY>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 1400 HRS. CST 02-24-91
<BR>
<H3>GROUND WAR PROGRESSES SUCCESSFULLY</H3>

Chicago, IL. As anticipated, large numbers of Iraqi "front-
line" troops have fled or are being captured by the rapidly
advancing Allied armor and mechanized infantry forces.  Early
reports from the Kuwait border indicate that British,
American, Saudi, Kuwaiti and Coalition forces are moving with
haste through the "dug-in" prepared positions of the least
trained of the Iraqi forces.
<P>

Coalition military forces report that more than 5,000 Iraqi
troops have surrendered or been captured during the opening
hours of the ground war. The reasons being given for early
capitulation include; limited amounts of food and water for
front-line Iraqi units, continued Allied propaganda and "psy-
war" campaigns, limited "live-fire" training for Iraqi
troops, and a crumbling command, control and communication
system. Reports have been recieved that Iraqi forces are
communicating by radio on "open frequencies" and can be
intercepted by various Allied means.  Small unit leaders of
the Iraqi forces are said to be surrendering rather than face
the onslaught of Allied armor, helicopters, and A-10
"Warthog" close support.
<P>

Military intelligence and media analysts indicate that the
first (front) line of the "Soviet-Style" defense-in-depth may
have been breached at several points and that an
multi-pronged "envelopment" tactic is ongoing within the
theatre.  This stategy dictates that the way to defeat fixed
defenses is to rapidly move around them by means of flanking
maneuvers and then using airpower to destroy bunkers and
deeply entrenched troop positions.  Troopers, thus "flushed"
from the defenses, are decimated by the strafing of  planes
and conventional infantry tactics.  This technique is
particularly effective when utilized in an area where the
attacking force has established air superiority; as is the
case in Kuwait.
<P>

Although unconfirmed, for security reasons, there are thought
to be at least four major Allied thrusts into Kuwait. Some
experts suggest that an amphibious assault from sea-borne
Marines could be expected in the area of Qasr as' Sabiya or
near Al Bahra, both in the vicinity of Kuwait Bay.  The
Marine amphibious forces could also strike as close to Kuwait
City as Al Jahara or El Bida, but Iraqi forces are expected
to be more heavily defended in those areas.
<P>

It is far more likely that they would want to be landed in an
area which would allow them to establish a "beachhead" and
move off the beach into the less defended countryside, before
launching offensive operations.  It is reported that the
Allies will engage the Iraqi Saladin, Medina, Tawakaina, and
Hammurabi Divisions within Kuwait. At least two of those
divisions are thought to have suffered heavy casualties from
Allied air power and Naval bombardment.
<P>

A secondary thrust is undoubtedly designed to sweep to the
East of Kuwait and cut off Iraqi reinforcements and supply
routes. It is likely that the Al Batln desert track will be
used to move heavy equipment and armor into the classic
blocking position.  It is thought likely that the U.S.
XVIIIth Corp, Eqyptian, and Saudi Divisions have been chosen
for this important assignment.  It is also likely that they
will engage the Al Faw and Adnan Divisions of the Iraqi
"Republican Guard" in that area. This Eastern flank is of
strategic importance in that it controls most of "hard roads"
and usable desert tracks that would lead into Kuwait and
allow the rapid movement of supporting Iraqi units.
<P>

The third forward assault is thought to be directed into the
enemy's center. It will be lead by the Multi-National forces
and supporting units of the VIIth Corp, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
Armored Divisions. It is believed to be moving in the area of
Menaquesh or into areas Northeast of there.  British and
French forces are also thought to be attacking with units
from several other nations of the Coalition, into the central
lines. Reportedly, various combat engineer units have done an
excellent job of "breaching" and destroying the forward
defenses and allowing the rapid movement of mechanized
forces.
<P>

The fourth column of Allied troops is "unofficially" reported
as advancing quickly through a corridor near Wafra.  Several
large British and  U.S. Army mechanized infantry and armored
divisions are thought to be quickly advancing into Kuwait.
They are supported on the right (West) flank by elements of
key U.S. Marine divisions, Kuwaiti, Saudi and other Coalition
forces.  A link-up between the Marines and "Central Front"
units is thought to  eventually occur at Burqan, South of
Ahmedi.
<P>

A "fifth" column of elements of the 82nd Airborne and 101st
Airborne (Airmobile) and unspecified special forces personnel
are thought to have been airlifted to the rear of "Republican
Guards" Divisions.  Members of the "Kuwaiti resistance" are
also thought to be operating "behind the lines" in a various
parts of Kuwait.  Hussein's forces can be expected to be
attacked from almost any direction.
<P>

<B>(AUTHORS NOTE)</B>
<BR>
It should be emphasized that the scenarios and troop
movements outlined, are anticipated as a result of typical
AirLand Battle doctrine and the topography of the region that
is presented.
<P>

No details of the actual movements of any Allied forces are
available at press time, nor will they be revealed by this
author unless previously cleared by the appropriate military
authorities. All material used in this article is gathered
from published, unclassified, or personal sources.

<title>It's time to Come Clean on Gulf War syndrome</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<p align=center><em><strong>Letter to the Editor - Editorial Comment - 10/02/96</strong></em><br>
<br>
<font size=5><strong>It is Time to Come Clean on Gulf War Syndrome<br>
</strong></font>By: Clark Staten, ERRI Executive Director <br></p>
<p align=left>Amidst new reports that more than 15,000 American soldiers potentially could have been exposed to the so-called &quot;Gulf 
War Syndrome,&quot; I believe it is my duty as a U.S. Army veteran and technically informed citizen to speak out about the 
handling of this situation. <br>
<br>
The most valuable asset that any military service has is its personnel. Their health and safety must be encouraged and 
preserved at almost any price. To do otherwise will undoubtedly result in declining morale and decreasing productivity. The 
information management aspects of this situation have also helped to create a &quot;crisis of credibility&quot; for the Dept. of Defense 
and diminished the reputations of those associated with it.<br>
<br>
In light of continuing facts and disclosures regarding the exposure of Desert Storm veterans to Iraqi nerve agents and other 
petroleum/chemical agents, it becomes incumbent upon the Department of Defense and its inherent agencies to provide 
free medical care and counseling for any soldier who was present there and complains of associated symptoms....period. 
Duty disability cases should be determined on a case-by-case basis, based on the severity of symptoms and a liberal 
interpretation of such policy.<br>
<br>
Further &quot;sandbagging&quot; regarding this issue should be discontinued and a Secretary of Defense announcement of the &quot;new&quot; 
aforementioned policy, along with all of the pertinent facts that are available about possible contamination/exposure of our 
troops should be issued to the largest media audience, at the earliest opportunity.<br>
<br>
Only by &quot;coming completely clean&quot; on this issue, and accepting full responsibility, can the Department of Defense hope to 
salvage it's reputation and begin the transition to a reinstatement of its overall credibility. We would strongly urge anyone 
that may have any input into the decision making process on this issue, to take these or similar steps, immediately. While 
we realize that there are certainly costs involved in what we propose, they are minimal compared to the overall effect of 
letting this issue continue on its present track.<br>
<br>
To do less for those that have faithfully and voluntarily served our country would be a travesty and would only contribute to 
an overall weakening of our military services at a time when we may need them most. The last thing the United States 
needs is another situation similar to the &quot;Agent Orange&quot; controversy of the Viet Nam era. Please, President Clinton and 
Secretary Perry, support our troops and solve this problem now. <br>

<title>Syria on Brink of War with Israel??</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<p align=center><font size=1><strong>(Editor's Note: Before you begin reading the two highly-detailed and richly-researched position papers that are presented here, about the 
possible intentions of Syria toward Israel, allow me to provide some information to inform some of our readers to this publication who may 
not be entirely well-informed in the matters of intelligence and analysis. In the intelligence field, information is collected, gathered, 
assessed and analyzed. After that, position papers are then written and then are distributed to other analysts and to the end-user consumer. 
Some of the end-user consumers in the United States would, in cases like this, be the President, the Vice-President, the Secretary of State, 
the Secretary of Defense, Senior Military and Intelligence Officers and so on. What you will be reading, here, are position papers that are 
very similar to what </strong><em><strong>MAY </strong></em><strong>be floating around, right now, in higher circles. Most, if not all, of the information that follows comes from open 
sources and is the opinion of the two authors who have spent years studying these topics.)</strong></font></p>

AN ASSESSMENT</strong></font></font><font size=5> </font><br>
<em><strong>By: RONALD W. LEWIS -- THE INTELLIGYST GROUP<br>
</strong></em></p>
<p align=left>Syria's President Assad has made no secret of his ambitions to become the leader of the Arabs throughout the Middle 
East. He is an archenemy of Iraq's Saddam Hussein on his eastern border and is in a bitter contest with the Turks on his 
northern border.<br>
<br>
At first glance, Syria would seem to be in poor shape, with Turkey having control over the water that flows into Syria and 
Iraq containing him on the east, and Israel on the southwestern region encompassing the Golan Heights.<br>
<br>
It would also seem likely for Assad to be in direct conflict with the Iranians who are not Arab and have their own ambitions 
for control of the Middle East. However, Iran and Syria are closely linked allies whom have been supporting one another 
in a number of important ways.<br>
<br>
Syria's army is the de facto governing force in neighboring Lebanon. This came about due to the collapse and civil war into 
which Lebanon descended in 1975. PLO factions under the rule of Yassir Arafat had taken over part of Lebanon and 
launched attacks on northern Israel. When, in 1982, Israel launched its invasion of Lebanon during the &quot;Peace for Galilee&quot; 
campaign, the United States, France and Italy all rushed to move in to Beirut to try keep the Israelis from progressing 
further and to quell further fighting that could expand the incursion into an open conflict with Syria. Israel eventually backed 
down and retreated to the southernmost border region of Lebanon and set up a Christian militia known as the Southern 
Lebanese Army (SLA). The intent was to have the SLA occupy this small section of southern Lebanon and keep radical 
Palestinians and, later, Hizbollah forces, from being able to launch quick strikes into northern Israel, most often with 
rockets.<br>
<br>
Syria stepped in and filled a huge vacuum of power that was subsequently created when western peacekeepers hastily 
departed after 241 US Marines were killed in a truck bombing of their barracks at the Beirut airport. Syria now controls 
the Bekaa Valley to the east and is a major influence in Lebanese affairs.<br>
<br>
The Hizbollah faction in Lebanon is armed, supported, trained and sponsored by Iran. However none of these weapons 
could be delivered by air or by land without Syria's complicity and even cooperation. In return for their assistance, the 
Syrian's can call upon the Hizbollah fighters to tie down a significant portion of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) on their 
northern border with Lebanon. Because of these conditions, Iran and Syria have become close allies, even to the extent 
that SCUD missiles, built in North Korea and intended for shipment to Syria, are off-loaded from a ship in Iranian ports 
and then flown to Syria.<br>
<br>
Unlike Iran and Libya, Syria has, until fairly recently, kept a low profile on the terrorism front. However, in the past year, 
they have given Hizbollah factions in southern Lebanon a green light to launch rocket attacks on northern Israel. The rocket 
attacks became so severe that the Israelis finally became fed up with them and launched a massive air and artillery assault 
on Hizbollah bases in southern Lebanon. Iran promptly decided to refill the stocks of 122mm rockets and other weapons 
expended by their Hizbollah agents and had Syria trans-ship these weapons to Lebanon. A recent report in JANE's ON 
DEFENSE indicates that the 122mm rockets have not only been replenished in large numbers, but 240mm rockets with a 
range of 25 miles have now been spotted.<br>
<br>
The logistical support has not all gone just from Iran to Lebanon alone. There is not strong evidence to indicate that 
Hizbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon have been traced from Lebanon to Damascus, Syria; to Amman, Jordan; then into 
Saudi Arabia where their tanker truck was filled with explosives and detonated at the Khobar Towers barracks complex in 
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 Americans.<br>
<br>
As a result of this cooperation, Syria has become a key element in the success of Middle East terrorism in Saudi Arabia 
and may be involved in destabilizing its other neighbors. Assad wants to ascend to the peak of the Arab and Muslim world. 
His ruthlessness is reputed to be on par with Iraq's Saddam Hussein and he has helped and encourage dissident Iraqi 
elements to help keep Saddam off balance.<br>
<br>
Syria has also been instrumental in causing unrest in Jordan by allowing infiltrators and terrorists to enter Jordan and then 
into Israel. Assad has been waiting patiently, building his military up for a major confrontation with Israel. In 1991, Syria 
sent an armored division to Saudi Arabia to assist in the war against Iraq. The venture was low-risk but paid off in huge 
dividends when the Saudis and others contributed over a billion dollars to Syria for their aid in liberating Kuwait. That 
money was plowed back into arms sales that make Syria one of the largest military forces in the region, aside from Israel 
and Iran.<br>
<br>
Syria's avowed enemy is Israel. Assad wants the Golan Heights lost in 1967 and he wishes to push the Israelis back into 
the sea. He has a very hard-line and uncompromising attitude toward Israel and figures that the Jewish state is nothing 
more than a transitory occupier, as were the Christian Crusaders of the Middle Ages.<br>
<br>
Will Syria now do something to carry out Assad's long-term dream of evicting the Israelis? It is very possible that Assad 
may feel the time is now for such an assault. Iraq is severely weakened, so his back will not be exposed to a great danger, 
Jordan is too destabilized to put up much of a credible resistance to anything Assad might wish to do, and Iran is a strong 
ally. To the north and west, Hizbollah in the Bekaa valley are very supportive of Syria. As a result, Syria's Assad now has 
the men, the materiel and a window of opportunity for striking against Israel.<br>
<br>
What is truly frightening is that Iran has an interest in closing the Straits of Hormuz or harassing shipping in the Persian Gulf 
if Syria doesn't get its way. To make matters worse, reports within the past few days indicate that the United Arab 
Emirates are being threatened by Iran in a dispute over islands out in the Gulf, the perfect spot from which to set up a 
crossfire against major naval surface combatants like aircraft carriers.<br>
<br>
Iran has also practiced numerous live-fire exercises including amphibious landing assaults. The only beaches in the Persian 
Gulf are on Iran's shores and those of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Arab nations, emirates and principalities directly 
across the Gulf from Iran. These activities would naturally tie down a significant number of American ships and aircraft. Just 
getting into and out of the Gulf this time would be running a gauntlet of fire if Iran possessed control.<br>
<br>
In Bahrain, the US 5th Fleet Headquarters is in an uneasy situation, located on an island wracked by bombings, arson 
attacks and other incidents. Hizbollah Bahrain is behind this unrest while elements of Hizbollah are showing up in Saudi 
Arabia and in Kuwait. As the region becomes more destabilized, Syria has a better chance of picking up the pieces.<br>
<br>
In recent days, heavy military activity has been witnessed inside Syria, indicating possible preparations for war. But how 
would Syria launch an attack on Israel and expect to get away with it? In order to be successful, the initial attacks would 
have to be at least as shocking and demoralizing as the 1973 Yom Kippur War was. One way to strike panic into the 
hearts of Israeli citizens and to possibly destroy the morale of the troops would be the employment of chemical weapons.</p>
<p align=left>Over a month ago, Syria, a country not exactly known to be self-sufficient in grain, offered 100,000 tons of grain to North 
Korea. North Korea does not have money to repay Syria, but it does have weapons, SCUD missiles and chemical 
warfare agents. Syria is believed to have a small stockpile of chemical weapons but does not have a fabrication facility. It 
would not be surprising to see that the ship that transported grain to North Korea would be bringing chemicals back to 
Syria on the return trip. Also in the past few weeks, Syria has made noises about wanting to build a chemical munitions 
production plant. Syria has repeatedly accused the Israelis of &quot;looking for war&quot; and trying to start one.<br>
<br>
Although it is true that Syria's ground and air forces would not be an even match for Israeli forces, they do have sizable 
amounts of artillery and rocket launchers that could open with heavy salvos on the very first day of the war. Heavy artillery 
barrages are disconcerting in themselves but would be absolutely terrifying if at least some of those warheads carried 
chemical agents. In 1991, Israeli citizens were issued gas masks in the event that Saddam Hussein's SCUD missiles carried 
chemical warheads. The protection consisted of a mask with no hood, no gloves, no boots, no outer protective garments. 
Those who get a pinhead-sized droplet of nerve agent like sarin on their skin will die in convulsions within minutes, despite 
the masks they wear for protection. That tiny droplet of nerve agent will absorb through the skin and, within minutes, the 
victim is dead. Imagine the hysteria when people with gas masks, well behind enemy lines, begin to succumb in large 
numbers.<br>
<br>
Syria might be betting that Israel would not respond with nuclear weapons for fear of dragging in Saudi Arabia and the 
GCC states, or due to pressure from the United States. But we simply don't know how far Assad is willing to push his 
luck. He has tried to get recognition among his peers and he has tried to become a pan-Arabic leader. Most of his rivals or 
neighbors are ill or politically unstable. He may think that this kind of opportunity can't be passed up and be tempted into 
making an attack to settle the issue.<br>
<br>
If Iran is tied to recent terrorist attacks and Syria is connected, Syria may have only a short time in which to seize control 
before US aircraft and ships begin retaliating. At present, Syria is on good terms with North Korea, Cuba, Libya, Sudan, 
and a variety of other troublesome nations that are distinctly unfriendly to the US and Israel. Sudan and Libya are 
threatening Egypt, a country which has a peace treaty with Israel and good relations with the US. Too many unfriendly 
countries and terrorist organizations are demonstrating unprecedented cooperation. This may encourage Syria to make a 
move on Israel, whose forces are spread thin and have to deal with Palestinian strikes, a possible resurgence of the 
Intifadah and, now, attacks from the north and east.<br>
<br>
US airpower in the region used to be formidable but due to downsizing of the military, we do not have several carriers in 
the region at any one time. In recent months, only a single carrier has operated in the Persian and Arabian Gulfs at a time. 
In some cases, they have departed before their replacements could arrive on station, as happened when two carriers were 
rushed to assist Taiwan against possible Chinese invasion.<br>
<br>
The number of US military air patrols in the Gulf have been scaled back in number was well, all of which would seem to 
encourage Assad in believing that he could strike and seize Israel.<br>
<br>
The danger level is extremely high and Syria's intentions should not be misread. Otherwise, we may be facing another 
major war with far-reaching implications.<br>
<br>
( Editor's Note: Does the Kurdish fighting in northern Iraq have anything to do with the scenario of keeping Iraq's forces 
busy, so that Syria's back is covered? Iran has been instigating the battle between the two Kurdish groups.)<br>

<p align=center><font color="#FF0000"><font size=5><strong>Syrian Analysis</strong></font></font><br>
By: <em><strong>Alijandra Mogilner, The Intelligyst Group</strong></em></p>
<p><br>
While I do not think that Syria could achieve a strategic surprise in attacking Israel, I believe that they may be readying for 
an attack anyway. If they do, their target date may either be the week following 96.09.22-23 (96.09.21 in the US) or the 
week following 96.10.11 (96.10.10 in the US). Situations both inside and outside of Israel may lead Assad to believe that 
they could achieve at least limited success even without the surprise factor and their current level of military activity 
suggests that they may wish to attack soon, perhaps on one of these dates as a symbolic gesture to commemorate, or as 
revenge for, the Yom Kippur war of 1973.<br>
<br>
Instability in nations that the United States uses as its primary bases might make our support of Israel more difficult than we 
would like. We are busy moving equipment and personnel in Saudi Arabia, there is a high level of PKK activity within 
Turkey and BFM activity within Bahrain, all of which may delay or restrict our ability to use bases within these nations. At 
the same time, Egypt is in a rear war situation with the Sudan, with Quadaffi backing the Sudan. This leaves Israel's only 
(almost) ally busy and the western flank unprotected. Moreover, reports have reached us that Sudan probably has 
chemical weapons from Libya and biological weapons of Chinese origin which could be used against Egypt and, as an 
extension, against Israel. Additionally, any tactical involvement between Egypt and the Sudan would make the use of their 
air bases by the US problematic. Any move by Iraq or Iran could make our troops now in Kuwait unusable and if the 
situation heats up in Jordan once again it may impact our presence there as well. On other fronts, if North Korea timed an 
invasion of the South to coincide with a Syrian attack on Israel, and/or China attacked Taiwan, it would further weaken 
our abilities to respond.<br>
<br>
Situations inside Israel may also lead Assad to believe the time for a strike is at hand. The Palestinian Authority has 
threatened Israel by saying that they could become an internal enemy -- this time armed to an extent unknown in the past. 
A new anti-Israeli/anti-PA &quot;jihad&quot; group has announced itself this past fortnight by threatening Arafat's life and declaring 
&quot;war&quot; on the existence of &quot;the Zionist government&quot;.<br>
<br>
Beyond this obvious threat, the IDF has expressed concerns about slackers within its ranks and a growing number of what 
we would call draft dodgers; morale and participation is at the lowest level since the founding of the country.<br>
<br>
New orders, such as the one for IDF members not to hitchhike, indicate concerns that there is a hidden third force working 
against the country from within. Unlike most European countries and the US, hitchhiking by military personnel is expected 
in Israel. It is a national policy that citizens pick up people in uniform. These new orders either reflect a concern that there 
are terrorists in IDF uniform may be used to attack citizens, or that those who seem to be Israelis may be used to attack 
military personnel. Either scenario suggests a large enough non-Palestinian, anti-Israeli presence in the country to pose a 
security threat.<br>
<br>
With a weakened ability for self defense, a diminished ability for the US to support Israel, the presence of chemical (and 
perhaps biological) weapons to both the east and the west, and new missile emplacements that have the ability to reach the 
center of the nation, Assad may rightly feel that a strike could succeed at least to a limited extent and, if they have been 
promised help from their coalition partners Iraq, Iran, Libya, and Pakistan he could believe that this is the time to push 
Israel into the sea. Even recent news stories and editorial positions that minimize the importance of the Palestinians speak 
to a policy of total destruction without consideration for protecting Arabs within the area.<br>
<br>
The timing is obvious. There is little hope that such a strike would be unexpected within Israel. Reports of the build up of 
medical supplies and other support materials have already created concern within the Israeli intelligence community. As a 
result, one may expect that the attack on the anniversary of the Yom Kippur war would help justify it to non-involved Arab 
states such as the UAE and mitigate their response to the situation. The question is, which anniversary date? The Yom 
Kippur War took place on 73.10.11 -- on the western calendar. However, the Arab/Israeli calendar is a lunar one and 
Yom Kippur this year begins at sundown on the 21st. Since there have been recent troop movements within Syria and it is 
an ethnically-based conflict, I would expect that the September date would be more likely than the October one.<br>
<br>
Can Assad really hope to win such a war? If it were possible, it would be possible now. I think there is a good possibility 
that we may see such an attack in the near future.</p>

<center><font size=5><strong>CHICAGO AREA BOMB SQUADS GET READY <br>
FOR THE UPCOMING CONVENTION</strong></font><strong></center> </strong>...</p>
<p align=center><img src="/Pipebom.gif" align=bottom width=200 height=144><br>
<strong>By: Steve Macko, ENN Editor</strong><br>
</p>
<p align=left>Ever since last week when the pipe bomb in Atlanta exploded, bomb experts in the Chicago area have 
increased these preparations for the upcoming Democratic National Convention that will be held at the United 
Center from 26 to 29 August. From this past Wednesday to Friday, members of the Chicago Police 
Department and Cook County Sheriff's Department bomb squads, as well as federal agents, conducted a 
security exercise.<br>
<br>
Similar security exercises have been held monthly since the beginning of the year. The past exercises have 
focused mainly on what are considered to be &quot;low-tech&quot; devices, such as pipe bombs. The exercise that was 
conducted this week stressed more exotic type of threats, such as: plastic explosives and chemical and 
biological weapons.<br>
<br>
During the convention, there will be six emergency response teams composed of city, county and federal 
explosive experts that will provide 24 hour coverage.<br>
<br>
It is said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be providing a wide variety of sophisticated bomb 
detection equipment and other gear. This same equipment has been making the rounds in the U.S. this summer. 
It is currently in use at the Olympics in Atlanta. From there, it will be sent to San Diego for the Republican 
National Convention, which opens on 12 August and from there it will be sent to Chicago.<br>
<br>
What is said to be one of the more interesting pieces of equipment that bomb experts will be able to use is a 
state-of-the-art bomb-defusing robot that is called an &quot;Alvin.&quot; Alvin costs about $86,000 and is rigged with 
cameras and can neutralize some bombs with a powerful jet of water.<br>
<br>
The Chicago Police Department already has an Alvin on order for their own use in the future and the Cook 
County Sheriff's Department is attempting to find funds to get their own.<br>
<br>
Kenneth Rewers, the chief of the Cook County Sheriff's bomb squad said that having a bomb-defusing robot 
&quot;is getting to be a must with bomb squads.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rewers told of an incident that occurred in west suburban Berwyn on 25 April 1996. Thirty old sticks of 
dynamite were found inside of a garage. They were probably left at site for decades. The dynamite was so old 
that nitroglycerin was actually oozing out of it. Nitroglycerin is so unstable in a situation like that -- it could 
trigger an explosion if accidently stepped upon.<br>
<br>
Two Sheriff's police bomb technicians had to don protective gear and remove the dangerous dynamite. As 
Rewers said, &quot;putting their lives on the line.&quot; An Alvin could have done the same job safely without putting 
anybody's life in jeopardy.<br>
<br>
The Cook County Sheriff's Department bomb squad has ten members on it. They also have bomb-sniffing 
dogs. The size of the Chicago Police Department's bomb and arson unit is classified, but it is believed to have 
about 24 members. Chicago has two specially equipped bomb-removal wagons which are about the size of 
small trucks.</p>

<TITLE>Israeli Curfew-Car Bomb Alert</TITLE>

<P>

<H2>Israeli Car Bomb Warning</H2>

According to previously reliable sources in Israel, effective at 9:00p.m. this evening, a security alert has been issued and a curfew has been issued for Judea, Samaria, and the PLO controlled Gaza strip.  According to intelligence reports, a car bomb has been readied for use in "Israel proper" and an attempt to import it and attack may be imminent.
<P>

Check points surrounding the aforementioned areas have been "beefed up", and additional IDF forces have reportedly been sent to several areas. The Prime Minister's Counter-Terrorism advisor, Brig. Gen. Pressler, has issued a warning to the general public cautioning them about "anything suspicious" and requesting that they notify authorities immediately should they note anything out of the ordinary.
<P>

Mid-east analysts say that the alert will probably continue until after the end of Ramadan.  This time frame is also concurrent with the mourning period for slain PLO activist Yechi Ayyash.  Islamic extremists have vowed to seek revenge for the "the Engineers" death, allegedly at the hands of operatives close to Israeli intelligence services.

<H3>California Crash Leaves at Least Five Dead</H3>
<P>

 DUNSMUIR, Calif. (ENN) -- According to ENN police sources, a tractor-trailer truck crashed and burned on California Interstate 5 this morning, and then several other vehicles smashed into the burning wreakage. At least five people were killed and several others were reported injured in the fatal mishap. 
<P>
   According to the California Highway Patrol (CHP), at least three large trucks and numerous other cars were involved in the 09:10 a.m. crash. CHP office assistant Annarae Heath reportedly told the Associated Press, "We have five confirmed dead, possibly six. Both northbound and southbound lanes are closed. We estimate they will be closed six to eight hours." 
<P>
     The accident happened on a stretch of road, about 200 miles north of Sacramento, within a mile of the site of a 30-car fatal accident that occured last Friday. A major CHP accident investigation is reportedly underway, in an effort to determine the cause of the accident and whether or not there are any ties between the two deadly crashes.

<H3>RECORD YEAR FOR BANK ROBBERIES 
IN THE CHICAGO AREA</H3>
Chicago, IL., (ENN) December 29, 1995 --It may not sound like a
lot -- but the number is high and has shattered the old record. 
With one more business day to go, there has been 142 bank
robberies in the Chicago area in 1995. The old record that was
set in 1991 was only 95.
<P>

The number grew by three on Thursday.  In the suburb of
Bloomingdale, located in Du Page County, the NBD Bank at #80
Stratford Drive was robbed by two men wearing ski masks.  This
robbery was not your usual "get the money from the bank teller"
heist.  The two suspects reportedly robbed two bank employees
who were carrying money from a night depository.  The two
suspects were armed with handguns, disarmed the two employees,
grabbed a bag of money and then fled in one of the bank
employee's car.
<P>

The other two bank heists were more mundane.  Another NBD Bank
branch was robbed.  This one in Elgin at 304 South McLean Blvd. 
And the other was at the Manufacturers Bank located at 1200
South Ashland Avenue in the City of Chicago.  In each of these
robberies, a single suspect walked into the bank and handed a
bank teller a note demanding money.
<P> 

The vast majority of the bank robberies are similar to the two
just mentioned. Unlike television and the movies, there has been
no dramatic shootouts with police, no crooks wearing funny
costumes and certainly no heists worth millions of dollars. 
Most of the bandits are described as a bunch of two-bit thieves,
who act alone and get away with relatively little cash. Bob
Long, the spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in
Chicago said, "Most of the robberies were teller thefts.  The
robbers were lucky if they got $2,000."
<P>

Even though the bank robbers are walking out with small amounts
of mostly insured money, banks in the Chicago area are beefing
up their security.  Some banks are hiring more security guards
for their lobbies. In the northwest suburb of Wheeling, IL, all
five banks in town plan to have off-duty, uniformed Wheeling
Police officers standing guard.  Many of the banks are investing
in new security camera systems that will provide higher-resolution 
and sharper images of the offenders.
<P>

Banks are more and more using money with recorded serial numbers
which will help investigators trace the money.  Banks are also
using more dye packs which are slipped in with the stolen loot
and explode, marking the bandit and the money with dye.
<P>

Authorities are not sure why there has been an increase in bank
robberies in the Chicago area this year.  Nationwide, there has
been a dramatic decrease in this kind of robbery.  According to
FBI statistics, during the first nine months of 1995, there were
5,938 bank robberies in the United States.  A dramatic decline
from the high of 9,388 bank robberies that occurred during the
same time period in 1991.
<P>

In the bank robbery capital of the world, Los Angeles, the
number of bank holdups has dropped from 2,641 in 1992 to 1,099
in 1995.One can see why the Chicago record high of 142 for an
entire year is essentially a slow month in Los Angeles.  John
Hoos, the FBI spokesman for the Los Angeles field office said
that the reason for the sharp decrease in robberies in his area
can be attributed to improved bank security measures and an
intensive police effort to apprehend the street gangs
responsible for a large number of the robberies. Hoos said, "We
had groups of people going into banks, guns drawn, ordering
customers on the floor and verbally and physically abusing them.
 They were organized takeovers.  The banks realized that
something had to be done."
<P>

Most of the suspects that hold up banks, in the Chicago area,
rarely show a weapon.  Most of the heists are not well
organized.  Most are sloppy and ill-planned, according to the
FBI.  Perhaps the most dramatic robbery of the year happened on
March 4th in southwest suburban Oak Lawn when three suspects set
off a smoke bomb and fired shots into the air when they robbed
the Standard Federal Bank of Oak Lawn.
<P>

The FBI field office in Chicago says that currently there are
two suspected serial bank robbers in the area.  One male suspect
in his early 20's has hit seven banks in Cook, Du Page and Lake
Counties.  The other is a very non-typical blond female in her
early 30's who has struck five banks, including the same bank in
the Will County town of New Lenox, three times, this year.

Haitian City Erupts into Rioting

<H2>HAITIANS RIOT</H2>
<H4>National Police Force Blamed in Child Killing </H4>
<P>
By: James J. Fay 
<P>
Riot conditions have broken out in Cite Soleil, Haiti, which, according to a report from the Reuters Wire Service and carried by the New York Times of November 24, is considered "...Haiti's worse slum..." The riots were allegedly provoked by a shooting incident involving the Haitian National Police Force. 
<P>
Reuters reports that the incident started after an altercation between a Police Officer and a bus driver. During the altercation, a shot was reportedly fired by the Police officer that killed a 6-year-old girl. As a result of the girl's death, the residents of Cite Soleil started street fires by burning tires. The people also stormed a local police station and disarmed several police officers. One of their demands was that President Jean-Bertrand Aristide come to the city and and hear their other demands.
<P>
This riot followed other large disorders in Haiti that have taken place during this past weekend. At that time, President Aristide, while attending a funeral for a close friend and political cohort, who was killed by Aristide's political rivals, riled the people at the funeral by advocating vigilantism and telling the crowd to "...go after the big people with the big guns..." 
<P>
Former NYC Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly was sent to Haiti last year at the behest of President Clinton to oversee, organize, and train a national police force just prior to the return of Aristide. Kelly worked with a hand-picked group of present and former law enforcement personel from the US, as well delegations of law enforcement from other countries to setup an "interim police force." This interim force was made up of mainly members of the old military personel who were in place while Aristide was in the US.
<P> 

The Reuters report states that the resulting permanent National Police Force received only four months training and has been the subject of excessive force charges in several recent shootings. Ironically, members of the "interim police force" that Mr. Kelly worked with initially, and UN Peacekeepers, were sent into Cite Soeil to help rescue the National Police from the citizens. Reports continue that a tense situation exists in Haiti.

<H2>CHURCH FIRES CONTINUE TO BURN ACROSS THE SOUTH</H2>
By Paul Anderson, ENN Metro Correspondent
<P>

KOSSUTH, MISSISSIPPI (ENN) - More federal law enforcment agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service, rushed into northeastern Mississippi on Tuesday to investigate the cause of two apparent copy-cat fires that destroyed two black churches on Monday night.  These fires are just the latest in suspicious church blazes that have burned across the southern portion of the United States in the past 18 months.
<P>

Both churches were reported to be gutted by the flames.  The two churches were only four miles and were set on fire about 17 minutes apart from one another.  They were located just outside of the small rural town of Kossuth, which is located near the Tennessee border.
<P>

A failed incendiary device was found Tuesday at a nearby white church.  This discovery is leading investigators to believe that it is possible that the fires were not the work of white supremacists.
<P>

The Mississippi state public safety commissioner said, "We're going to find a copy-cat situation ... someone who just couldn't help themselves.  Mississippi is not burning."
<P>

Federal law enforcement authorities have stepped up efforts to investigate the fires that have damaged or destroyed 36 black churches across the South in the past 18 months.  It is believed that many of the fires are racially motivated, but there has been no pattern of any coordinated arson activity.  Meaning few, if any, can be tied to one another.
<P>

Steve Macko, the editor of the ENN Daily Report, is also a criminalist who has studied law enforcement issues for more than 20 years.  He said on Tuesday that the one thing that is really emerging in the wave of fires is a sense of "hysteria." Macko said, "Statistics show that we have about 500 church fires every year in the United States.  36 black churches have been targeted -- all in heart of the South.  But there has also been 29 white churches that have been the victim of suspicious fires in about the same amount of time.  The insurance industry is saying that there has been no increase in the number of church fires.  In fact, the insurance industry says that statistics have been steady and they expect about 500 church fires for this year. No dramatic change."
<P>

Macko believes that all the publicity that has been generated over the church fires is only making the situation worse and is encouraging other copy-cat arsonists.  Macko said, "First, please let me say that burning ANY church is terrible.  But there has been absolutely NO proof that there is any kind of organized, concerted effort behind these arsons.  There are now hundreds of investigators working on this.  If there was any kind of pattern linking the fires to one another ... we'd know it by now.  That possiblity will still be explored by investigators -- it has to be.  But what you probably really have here are a bunch of 'yahoos' in the rural South who are getting ideas from all of the news coverage this is creating."
<P>

Macko added, "Try and think like one of these 'yahoos' for a minute. All I have to do is go out between the hours of midnight and four a.m., which is when most of these fires have been started, and set an old wood-frame church on fire.  Then my accomplishment can be announced by Dan Rather on the evening news that night. What's that mean?  The arsonist, in this case, may be looking more for some kind of notoriety rather than have a racial motive. The first number of arsons probably were racial motivated, but I'll bet a lot of these recent ones were just an effort to gain some kind of personal recognition.  This is not to say that race is not a factor, but just not the main reason for setting the fires.  Without all of the publicity, the 'yahoos' probably would never had gotten the idea."
<P>

What does Macko think should be done?  He suggested, "This won't happen, but the first thing that has to be done is to tone down the rhetoric.  If the news media continues to maintain this level of hysteria ... there's only going to be a lot more fires."
<P>

James Cavanaugh, an ATF agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, who is assigned to the arson task force, said of the latest fires, "This is getting disturbing."  Cavanaugh is normally assigned as an arson investigator to the Chicago ATF field office, he added, "It's getting disgusting."
<P>
<HR>
Editor's Note: As a perfect example of the hysteria that the general news media is creating -- On Wednesday morning, headlines were screaming: "Black Church Burns In Eastern Maryland!"  The fire occurred at about 0245 EDT.  Arson and ATF investigators rushed to the scene and quickly determined that the fire was accidental.
<P>
<HR>
The following statistics for the State of Mississippi were also released on Wednesday:
<P>
Mississippi Fires, January 1990 to March 1996. (Data from the State Fire Marshall's office)
<P>

Structural fires:   4,403 
<BR>
Church fires: 56 Church fires,  
<BR>
accidental: 26 Church fires,
<BR>  
undetermined cause: 8 Church fires, 
<BR>   
arson: 22  (12 predominantly black, 10 predominantly white)
<P>
All 10 of the predominantly white church arsons remain unsolved, while 8 of the 12 predominantly black church arsons are unsolved. Of the 4 solved predominantly black church arsons, two were determined to be racially motivated, and the three teenagers charged were tried and convicted for both arsons in 1993.

<H2>Flooding of "EPIC Proportions" in  N.W.</H2>
<P>
Chicago, IL.,  (ENN) November 30, 1995 -- According to one volunteer
firefighter, with tongue lodged firmly in his cheek, flooding in
Washington state has reached "epic proportions" this evening.
The volunteer rescuer's dark humor aside, serious damage is
being reported in several areas of Western Washington. Reports
are being received by ENN that several rivers are as much a nine
(9) feet over floodstage there and that the flooding in the
Skagit Valley may meet or exceed all time record levels later
today.
<P> 

Numerous phone lines are reported out in the region and
communications are reportedly only being conducted by cellular
phone and on emergency radio frequencies. Some Washington
National Guard units and civilian HAM radio operators are said
to have brought in additional commo gear to assist in
coordinating rescue operations and assisting those displaced by
the flood waters.
<P>   

Gov. Mike Lowry has declared at least fourteen counties as
"disaster areas" and requested federal assistance to assist
those stricken by the flooding, which is being described by
state officials as the worst to occur in forty (40)years. A
spokesperson for Gov. Lowry said that the current damage
estimate exceeds $100 million dollars and that the estimate is
expected to rise as the water recedes and a real "on-the ground"
assessment can be conducted.
<P>
According to the American Red Cross, twenty-five shelters have
been set up and hundreds of residents are reportedly taking
advantage of beds and hot meals that the charitable organization
provides. Reports have been received by the Red Cross that
several thousand residents have been evacuated from their homes,
but that many have moved in with relatives or are staying in
motels or other lodging.
<P>

Civilians and volunteer rescuers are sandbagging a number of
areas to prevent further damage to homes and business in the
path of the rising waters. The city Hall in Reston, WA would be
underwater, according to another fire department source, were it
not for a wall of sandbags constructed by area residents. As
many as sixty (60) other homes and businesses may be under water
and destroyed in the area of Carnation, WA. An unconfirmed
report, from the area, says that the Amtrak "Empire Builder" is
not running, due to water on the tracks.
<P>

The primary hope, according to rescuers, is that the rain will
stop for a day or two and that the already swollen creeks and
rivers will have an opportunity to recede before another rain
producing system blows in from the Pacific Ocean. In the mean
time, most volunteers expect blisters and backaches as they work
to try to save their neighbors homes, businesses, and livestock.

<H3>Five Alarm Fire in San Francisco</H3>

SAN FRANCISCO (ENN) - San Francisco firefighters battled a 5 alarm fire during the early morning hours on Tuesday.  Fire raced through a Nob Hill 27-unit apartment house at 1011 Bush Street and was responsible for the death of a 75-year-old woman, who jumped from a fourth floor window.  The fire began at 0503 PDT in the basement of the 4-story brick mixed-occupancy building that had a liquor store and laundromat on the first floor and apartments above.
<P>

Heavy smoke conditions sent about forty residents of the building to their windows.  The dead victim apparently panicked and she and her 40-year-old daughter jumped from the window on the fourth floor. The daughter of the dead victim was reported to be in serious condition at San Francisco General Hospital.  Eight other people, including five firefighters, were also injured in the blaze.  It took 146 San Francisco firefighters with 27 pieces of equipment about three hours to bring the fire under control.  The blaze which pretty much gutted the entire building went to five alarms in 40 minutes.
<P>

Arson investigators have determined that the fire was "maliciously set." If found, the arsonist(s) could face murder charges for the death of the victim.  A spokesman for the SFFD told ENN, "We are now calling it an incendiary fire.  We have ruled out all accidental causes and have determined that it was deliberately set."

<H3>New Mexico WildFires Continue</H3>
By Paul Anderson, Metro Correspondent
<P>

NEW MEXICO (ENN) - A number of wildfires burning across the State of New Mexico is straining the state's firefighting resources and are forcing fire bosses to ignore several dozen smaller blazes. On Tuesday, fire crews were battling a brush fire that was threatening a small mountain town near the Carson National Forest. Another wildfire has reportedly burned about 5,200 acres of a national wildlife refuge in the central part of the state.
<P>

Terri Wildermuth, a spokesperson with the New Mexico Forestry Division, said, "If we have more fires, we're going to get to the point where we have to prioritize.  It gets difficult telling someone that saving their home has less priority than saving someone else's."
<P>

In discussing the containment of one of the blazes, Carson National Forest spokesman Gary Schiff said, "Because conditions are as dry as they are, our plan of attack is to hit them hard and fast and heavy."
<P>

One fire destroyed a 100-year-old abandoned church and threatened homes in the town of San Pedro, before air tankers came in and dropped fire retardant on Monday.
<P>

More than 50 small fires have been left to burn themselves out in the Gila National Forest and other parts of the state.  New Mexico is currently experiencing its worst drought in forty years.

<H3>New Jersey Storage Tank Fire</H3>

WOODBRIDGE, NEW JERSEY (ENN) - A storage tank containing three million gallons of gasoline was struck by lightning late on Tuesday afternoon.  The lightning sparked a huge blaze that sent flames hundreds of feet into the air and caused smoke that could be seen from ten miles away.  The fire, which started at about 1700 EDT, at the Shell Oil Company storage facility forced about 200 nearby residents to evacuate their homes.
<P>

Firefighters worked through the night pouring water on the blaze and nearby storage tanks.  The main concern was to prevent the heat and flames from igniting nearby tanks.  Fire officials were hopeful to bring the fire under control by Wednesday afternoon. A spokesman for the Middlesex County Hazardous Materials team said that the plan was to let the gasoline burn itself out and then pour foam into the storage tank.

<H2>EXPLOSIONS RIP MEXICAN CITY, 200 DEAD, 600 INJURED</H2>
Clark Staten, EMT-P
<P>
<IMG SRC="/hexane.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>
GUADALAJARA, MX -  A series of devastating explosions have
struck a blue-collar neighborhood in Mexico's second largest
city and created a major state of disaster.  According to
Radio Red Reporter Juan Sanchez, the Reforma section in the
Southeast area of the city of 3 million people, looks like
"it had been bombed".
<P>

At least nine separate explosions were heard, starting at
approximately 10:30 a.m. (11:30 p.m. CDT) local time. They
were said to have ripped a jagged trench that runs for more
than one (1) mile.  The expanded trench was said to be
contiguous with the city sewer system, and the open holes
thought to be at least six meters deep and three meters
across. In several locations, much larger craters of fifty
(50) meters in diameter are evident with numerous vehicles
buried or toppled into them.  An eyewitness said that a bus
was "swallowed up by the hole"; many victims were said
to be rescued by bystanders from the bus.
<P>

Conflicting reports continue to be received from the area, as
to the cause of the explosions, which is thought to have
leveled more than 20 blocks of buildings. Guadalajara Fire
Chief Jose Trinidad Lopez Rivas is reported to have blamed
the explosions on "thousands of liters of gasoline" in the
sewer systems prior to the explosions. A statement from the
PEMEX, the Mexican state petroleum company, claimed that the
explosions were caused by a leak of Hexane from a factory in
the area.
<P>

Residents of the affected neighborhood had reportedly
contacted both the Guadalajara police and fire departments
for more than twenty-four (24) hours, complaining of both a
"foul smell" and symptoms of nausea and "eye and throat
stinging" as the result of gas fumes coming from sewer
gratings in the area of the blast.  According to
eyewitnesses, a firefighter was seen removing manhole covers
to allow the gas to dissipate earlier in the day on
Wednesday.  Reportedly, nothing else was done regarding the
complaints.
<P>

Hexane, CH3(CH2)4CH3, is known to be a strong irritant that
causes light-headedness, nausea, headache, with irritated
eyes and nose. Hexane can be toxic by inhalation, ingestion,
or absorption through the skin. It is NOT soluble in water.
It is extremely flammable with a flash point of -7 degrees
(F).  That is the temperature at which it will ignite with
contact with any spark or open flame.  Hexane is described by
hazardous material's text books as having a "mild gasoline-
like" smell.
<P>

Hexane is described by experienced emergency responders as
being "extremely volatile".  At least one Chicago emergency
analyst said that eyewitness statements pointed to the
likelihood that the substance involved was Hexane rather than
gasoline, due to the signs, symptoms, and characteristics
described by witnesses.  He pointed out, however, that Pemex
has a history of involvement in past explosions in Mexico and
that they were found at fault in a 1984 explosion in
Ixhuatepec, MX that killed more than 500 people.  According
to analysts from the Emergency Response & Research Institute
of Chicago, a chemical test could answer the question of
which substance was involved fairly quickly.
<P>

A massive rescue effort was begun the Mexican Government.
Defense Minister Javier del Real said that he had sent 400
military troops to assist in security and coordination of the
rescue.  Bystanders and relatives of victims were said to
have been digging in the rubble of more than 1,000 buildings
damaged by the blasts, since shortly after it had first
occurred. All available police and fire department members
from many miles around were said to be participating. In all,
more than 700 rescuers have been sent to the scene.
<P>

Agustin Navarro of the Guadalajara Red Cross said that as
many as 170 people were confirmed dead and as many as 500
others were known to be injured.  Ricardo Jiminez, an
official with the state Civil Defense agency, is quoted as
saying that the official death toll is expected to rise as
rescue efforts continue.  According to Jimenez, "hundreds of
people are missing".  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
who was said to be enroute to Guadalajara to inspect the
disaster, ordered additional rescue teams, dog handlers
search teams, and earth moving equipment to the scene of the
tragedy.
<P>

Red Cross officials say that all available hospital beds have
been filled and that local soccer stadiums are being used as
make-shift relocation and treatment areas. Late Wednesday,
Red Cross officials in Juarez, Mexico issued a plea for
medical supplies, food, blood and plasma for the disaster
victims. Eloy Sanchez, Chief of Transportation for the Cruz
Roja (Red Cross), said that he had mobilized ambulances,
medical personnel, and volunteers and that they were
standing by to be sent to the scene.  U.S.  Government and
State Department officials said, however, that no official
request had been made of them for rescue or other assistance
by the Mexican Government.
<P>

Rescue efforts were said to be continuing at a "fevered
pitch" at the time of this report.  More than 100 buildings
were known to be collapsed, with reports of people still
trapped in many of them.  Hundreds of civilians and military
rescuers were seen using picks, shovels, and their barehands
in an attempt to rescue friends and relatives. Undoubtedly,
the death toll will rise.  Everyone continues to dig and
hope.

<p><font size=5>FBI ENLISTS IN LOCALS' &quot;WAR ON DRUGS&quot; </font></p>
<p>By: Clark Staten </p>
<p>Chicago, IL (ENN) Newly appointed U.S. Attorney General William Barr announced on Thursday that 
he will be shifting the priorities of approximately three-hundred (300) Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI) agents to the nation's &quot;War on Drugs&quot;. Barr cited a decrease in tensions with the Soviet Union and 
the Eastern Bloc, as the reason for allowing the FBI shift from counterintelligence to anti-gang work. </p>
<p>Crime analysts, however, point out that the disintegrating U.S.S.R. may not be the prime motivating 
factor in the Attorney General's decision. They point to the fact that more than thirty (30) major U.S. 
cities have reported record crime rates during 1991, and that drug and gang inspired crimes have 
increased dramatically in the past few years. </p>
<p>Experts also note that U.S. President George Bush had pledged, during his 1988 campaign, to &quot;Fight a 
War on Crime and Drugs&quot;. At least one Chicago political strategist has indicated that the recent move 
may be an attempt at providing &quot;needed reinforcements in the war&quot; prior to the upcoming presidential 
election season. </p>
<p>Chicago Police (CPD) crime statistics indicate that 1991 brought the city's second highest murder rate 
ever, and that gang-related murders have doubled since 1988. Chicago Mayor Daley's response to this 
growing problem was to increase the CPD Gang Crimes Unit to a record strength of 500 officers, 
making it the second largest unit in the department. </p>
<p>City officials in several other major U.S. cities have reported record murder rates. The city of 
Washington D.C. reported it's highest murder record ever during 1991. Cities in California and Texas 
also reported record murder and violent crimes rates, much of it contributed by law enforcement officials 
to a proliferation of gangs and drugs. </p>
<p>The Justice Department also announced the organization of a computerized center for tracking the 
migration of gangs and gang members between states. Attorney General Barr indicated that many gangs 
now operate across statelines, thus making them vulnerable to federal investigation and prosecution for 
inter-state violation of local laws. Barr also indicated that his office will enforce federal anti-drug laws, 
which carry far heavier penalties than do many state and local laws. </p>

<p align=center><font size=5>Thriving Fire-based EMS and Cooperating with Managed Care</font><br>
<br>
<strong>EMS Update by Gary G. Ludwig, MS, EMT-P</strong></p>
<p align=center><strong>July 02, 1996</strong></p>
<p align=left><br>
<br>
In a previous column, I encouraged chiefs who do transports to start looking at managed care and, at 
the minimum, start talking to the managed care organizations within your service areas. Since then, I 
have received numerous requests for more information.<br>
<br>
I suggest you do so before 50 percent of your population (or more) is covered by a managed care plan 
and it is too late. Many experts say MCOs are not managing care but are managing their money. MCOs 
will push forward to manage their money with or without us. If fire agencies do not want to form 
partnerships with MCOs to provide services, the MCOs will certainly find someone else who does. The 
new buzz word for contracting services with other agencies is called - out-sourcing.+ At this point, the 
commercial sector is usually more adept than the fire service when it comes to operating in the managed 
care arena.<br>
<br>
The name of the game is the number of transports. Usually, the more transports an ambulance service 
makes, the more money it can make. Managed care managers believe that when you operate on a 
fee-for-service concept, services tend to be delivered that don+t need to be. In a recent article written 
by Tom Scott, a manager with MedTrans, he cited unpublished data from a JEMS 200 City Survey that 
showed the percentage of 9-1-1 responses transported varied from about 50 percent for dual-role 
cross-trained fire departments to 71 percent for county third services. The other major transporters are 
private services, hospital-based services, and non-profit services.<br>
<br>
One can suppose that fire agencies are leaving patients behind or the other agencies are transporting 
more patients than they should be. Managed care managers believe more people are being transported 
than should be. As a result, you can expect the managed care people to try to reduce transports. The 
Oakland County area is a prime example of this. There has been a 17 percent decline in 9-1-1 calls and 
the county has had to increase the subsidy to the private contractor and relax response time criteria.<br>
<br>
Other ways of managing care or money is through capitation. Capitation pays a set amount of money to 
an -out-sourcer+ for its services. As an example, an MCO may have 100,000 people in its plan for 
your community. Hypothetically, the MCO has determined 8.25 percent of those 100,000 people will 
need an ambulance in a fiscal year. If the bill for an ambulance transport is $200, the MCO may sign a 
capitated agreement with you for $1,650,000 or $137,500 per month, or $16.50 per member per 
month. Stay under 8,250 transports and you make money. Go over and you lose money. Therefore, the 
reward will come for EMS agencies who safely move or refer those patients to alternate sources of care 
- a primary physician or urgent care facility.<br>
<br>
MCOs look for certain standards when contracting with an ambulance service. They want full service 
contracts and one- stop shopping. This would include doing non- emergency or routine transports. They 
also want the service to be fully indemnified and heavily insured. Plus, they will define the standard of 
care.</p>
<hr>
<p align=left><strong>Washington State Lawsuit</strong></p>
<p align=left><br>
Chief Craig Williamson has provided an update from Washington state on the lawsuit filed by A+ 
Ambulance against numerous fire and government agencies. A judge has dismissed the lawsuit at a 
hearing for a summary judgment. The judge cited there was no violation of state law and there was no 
previous case law supporting A++s position.</p>
<hr>
<p align=left><strong>Infectious Disease Notes</strong></p>
<p align=left><br>
Our infection control guru, Katherine West, says fire departments should stop throwing away leather 
gear that has been contaminated with blood. If the item is made of suede, it can be dry cleaned. The dry 
cleaning process uses solvents that can kill just about anything. If the item is made of porous leather, it 
can be washed with saddle soap. West can be reached at 703-644-5032.</p>

<H3>At Least 23 Reported Dead in Mexico Border Bus Crash</H3>
By: Clark Staten
<P>
(write-through@15:45CST-Reduces injuries count, adds Rescue Details)
<BR>
Phoenix, AZ., January 1, 1996  (ENN) -- Two buses collided 13
miles south of the Mexico/Arizona border at approximately
03:30a.m. today. One of the buses reportedly crossed the center
line and careened into oncoming traffic, hitting the other bus
head-on. At least one of the buses is reported to be a tour bus.
The accident was reported to have happened on Highway 2, near
the border town of Sonoita, Mexico. Sonoita is located
approximately 100 miles SW of Phoenix, and near the town of
Lukeville, AZ.  The deadly accident reportedly killed at least
23 people and may have injured as many as fifty others. Several
of the dead are believed to be children, according to an Arizona
State police source.
<P>    
Some dispute continues in regard to actual casualty counts.
Mexican authorities in Sonoita had originally reported only 23
people to be injured, but Pima County, Arizona Sheriff's
Department personnel said that as many as 100 people may have
been hurt. Secondary reports by emergency medical personnel vary
between three dozen and the original one hundred.  The
confusion is reportedly being compounded by the fact that the
injured were taken to hospitals on both side of the border and
that there was no unified incident command system at the scene. 
<P>
The extent of injuries are also not immediately known, but it
was reported that several people were entrapped and had to be
extricated from the demolished buses. Sonoita police officer
Rafael Almaraz reportedly told the Associated Press (AP) that
half of one bus was completely destroyed. All available air
ambulances in the area have been sent to the scene, and several
seriously injured people were seen being flown to hospitals in
Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona. A trauma center in Phoenix says
that they have received at least five (5) critical patients with
multiple-trauma injuries.
<P>
The accident remains under investigation by Mexican police,
and the actual cause may not be determined for hours or even
days. One thing is certain; the crash is a lethal start to 1996
traffic fatality statistics.

<BR>
<H2>MADMAN KILLS TWENTY THREE, WOUNDS 20 MORE</H2>
By George Quinten, ENN
<P>
Kilene, TX.  An angry man with a semiautomatic 9mm pistol
crashed his pickup truck into a Kilene, Texas cafeteria and
opened fire on the lunch time crowd.  Witnesses describe the
man as having fired his weapon until it was empty, reloading
and firing many additional shots. The man may have continued
to shoot and kill people for as much as ten to fifteen
minutes.  Emergency medical and law enforcement officials
describe a total of twenty-three (23) people being killed and
another twenty (20) wounded. The gunman reportedly was also
found dead at the scene, possibly from a self-inflicted
gunshot wound.
<P>

Kilene Police are investigating the incident, but have
released little information about the motive or cause for the
shooting. Reportedly, the assailant's name was given as
George Menard of Belden, Texas.  Little is known about the
man, except that he made a statement prior to the start of
the shooting, which accused "Bell County of ruining his
life".  Bell county is the Texas county where the incident
occured. Reportedly, the man had been unemployed for as much
as six months prior to the incident, and several local people
speculated that the man's financial situation might have
contributed to the fatal outcome.
<P>

According to Clark Staten, Executive Director of the
Emergency Response and Research Institute in Chicago,IL,
"This appears to be the deadliest shooting incident of the
past twenty-five years".  "It brings to mind another incident
of many years ago involving a gunman who was firing from a
tower at the University of Texas", the former police officer
continued.  "This level of violence appears to be an
unfortunate, but increasingly common event", Staten
continued.  "Incidents like that which occured today, last
year in a McDonald's restaurant, and on a California
schooyard point out the vulnerability of anyplace that people
gather", he added.
<P>

"The next biggest problem that will face the citizens of
Kilene, is that of critical incident stress; in a town the
size of Kilene everybody knows somebody who was involved in
the shooting or is even related to a victim", Staten said.
"Following a large scale, tragic event like this, many people
will will eventually experience what is commonly called
`Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome', he added.  "Mental health
professionals will need to begin the process of debriefing
those that have lived through this horrendous afternoon, and
much follow-up care may be necessary to help ease the
psychologic trauma that will undoubtedly occur", Staten
added.
<P>

An initial assessment of the emergency response to the
incident shows that the U.S. Military contributed a great
deal to the rescue effort.  According to an local Emergency
Medical Technician (EMT), a military unit from nearby Ft.
Hood sent several medical evacuation helicopters to the scene
and they immediately transported several critical patients to
nearby civilian and military hospitals.  A number of
physicians were also transported to the scene of the shooting
within a few minutes, and a triage/treatment area was
established in a nearby store.
<P>

Local fire, police and emergency medical service workers
report that their normal systems were overwhelmed for a
period of time at the onset of the incident, but that an
extraordinary effort on the part of the rescuers minimized
the loss of life to the highest degree possible.  "Almost any
emergency medical service would have been pushed to it's
limits by an incident like this"; Staten, a veteran
paramedic, observed.  "Considering the circumstances, it
would appear that they did a commendable job while in the
most difficult of predictaments", he concluded.

<B>**LEAD STORY**</B>
<H2>BRITISH FIRE BRIGADES FACE BUDGET CRISIS...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

Union leaders of British Fire Brigades are warning that the
looming financial crisis that faces fire brigades all over
Great Britain could endanger the public.
<P>

Dennis Davis is the president of the Chief Fire Officers' Association
in Cheshire.  He recently wrote a letter to the British Parliament
stating the scale of the problem and warning that fire brigades are
spending about 80 million English pounds a year more than their
government-imposed spending limits.
<P>

According to the Union president, the brigades are just managing to
meet basic standards, such as responding to incidents in a timely
fashion.  But the budget crisis is taking its toll on training and
on replacing old equipment.
<P>

Davis said in his letter to Parliament, "The fire service is facing
a serious financial situation which needs to be remedied if it is
not to create major operational difficulties.  There are clear
indications that the fire service, with its need for technical
development to meet more complex hazards with better information
systems and personal protection, is short of basic capital investment.
Training in new skills is stagnating when it should be growing, and
research into better options for public protection is slowing down."
<P>

Davis continued, "What has happened so far is that a series of issues
like capital financing, pensions, fire service training costs, national
employee conditions and standards of fire cover have been examined in
isolation, only to find that they are one and the same problem."
<P>

The association that Mr. Davis heads represents senior fire officers
in 57 British fire brigades.  In his letter to the MPs in Parliament,
he also said, "The fire engine arriving at your door may continue to
be on time, but that certainly does not mean all is well.  I feel
further delay is dangerous.  Dangerous to firefighters, who will
become less and less well trained and equipped and dangerous to our
communities, who will be denied the most sophisticated and technically
advanced service."
<P>

About two weeks ago, firefighters in Scotland lobbied Scottish
government offices in Edinburgh to call attention to a proposed
ten percent fire service budget cut. Strikes by firefighters in other parts of Great Britain have been
staged.  The fire authority in London is still considering whether or not it
will have to close fire brigade stations and lay off firefighters because of financial problems.
<P>

The British fire service is not the only agency facing these kind of
financial problems.  Similar situations are occurring in the United
States.  A prime example is the budget crisis that the District of
Columbia Fire and Rescue Department in Washington has faced in recent
years.  Fire companies have been reduced from usually four men on a
rig to three men.
<P>

What this does mean is that the fire service is probably going through
a change, perhaps -- worldwide, and must come up with modern, cost efficient solutions to
the ancient problem of fires and fire protection.

<TITLE>Plan to Save 75-100,000 Cardiacs</TITLE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE-EMERGENCYNET-11/24/91-11:30CST
<P>
<H2>75-100,000 MORE AMERICANS COULD BE SAVED EACH YEAR FROM HEART ATTACK</H2>
By Paul Anderson
<P>

Chicago,IL.(ENN) At least one third (1/3) of all Americans that
suffer a cardiac arrest could be saved if communities in the
United States were willing to upgrade their Emergency Medical
Service (EMS) systems, according to Clark Staten of the
Chicago based Emergency Response and Research Institute.
Staten says, "the state-of the art exists today to save at
least seventy-five thousand (75,000) more cardiac arrest
victims every year...if Americans are willing to commit their
financial resources to this effort".
<P>

According to National Institute of Health statistics, more
than 350,000 Americans will suffer cardiac arrests during the
coming year. More than two thirds (2/3) of these events will
occur outside of hospitals, and are potentially treatable by
prehospital providers (Paramedics), according to several
recent studies.  A nineteen (19) month study conducted by
doctors at the Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, Rhode
Island, and published in the November 13th edition of the New
England Journal of Medicine says that the medical community
is "misplacing it's priorities" by spending money on "futile
resuscitation efforts that take place long after they will be
beneficial to the patient".
<P>

Doctors in the Rhode Island study said that the money would
be better spent on "increasing the number of emergency
medical service (EMS) units, staffed with the necessary
equipment and training to get the heart started again".  Dr.
William Gray of the Cardiology division of Rhode Island
Hospital also recommended that members of the general public
should be educated in the basic principals and practice of
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
<P>

Another study, recently released by Dr. Myron Weisfeldt of
the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, found
that treatment for heart attack victims is often delayed
by as much as sixty (60) minutes.  Weisfeldt says that as
many as fifty (50) percent of all heart attack victims could
be saved if they were treated in a more timely manner, by
using new clot-dissolving drugs and early defibrillation
techniques that have been developed during the past five
years.  Dr.  Costas Lambrew of the Maine Medical Center,
noted that in some hospitals, registration and testing
procedures within emergency rooms may also contribute to
delays in providing potentially life saving treatments.
<P>

"The answer would appear to be an integrated approach to
providing rapid and effective emergency medical care to the
patient...where it occurs... and at the onset of the event",
said Clark Staten, a veteran paramedic and emergency manager.
"The studies say that many cardiac arrests can be prevented,
and the the damage to the heart muscle minimized by beginning
treatment of the cause and effect of the heart blockage at
the scene of the incident", he continued. "The technology and
drugs exist to allow us to save many more lives every year,
if we combine the accumulated knowledge with a reorganization
of our use of emergency medical care resources", Staten said.
<P>

Staten said, "tens of thousands of cardiac patients could be
salvaged"... if:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>1. Those suffering the signs and symptoms of cardiac
   impairment knew when to call for emergency medical care
<LI>2. Many citizens were well trained in the recognition of
   heart attacks and able to perform adequate cardio-
   pulmonary resuscitation
<LI>3. All communities had an integrated/computerized 911
   emergency dispatch system
<LI>4. Multi-tiered emergency medical response systems were
   implemented that utilized all Fire, Police, and EMS
   resources for an arrival of trained technicians within 4-6
   minutes of a cardiac event
<LI>5. Programs were developed that provide rapid defibrillation
   for patients suffering from Ventricular Fibrillation (an
   uncoordinated "quivering" of the heart)
<LI>6. Educated Emergency Medical Technicians (Paramedics)
   were routinely allowed to give clot-dissolving drugs like
   T.P.A. or Activase to patients suffering from heart attack
   signs and symptoms
<LI>7. Patients were transported to appropriate hospitals that
   specialize in treating cardiac patients, after they had
   received the life-saving care previously mentioned
<LI>8. Communities are willing to commit the necessary financial
   resources to the planning and implementaion of these

"In times of dwindling municipal budgets, this plan sounds
like another plea for tax increases...when, in reality, it is
a call for an efficient use of the dollars that we already
spend for medical care", Staten said.  "It is a unique time
in history... when we discover that we can definitively save
even more lives by re-allocating our financial commitment to
the provision of quality prehospital emergency medical care",
Staten concluded.

<p><font size=5><strong>BOMBS BY MAIL</strong></font><br>
U.S. POSTAL INSPECTION SERVICE<br>
NOTICE # 71, MARCH 1990<br>
<br>
The likelihood of your ever receiving a bomb in the mail is remote. Unfortunately, however, a small number of explosive 
devices have been mailed over the years resulting in death, injury, and destruction of property.<br>
<br>
What can you do to help prevent a mail bomb disaster? First, consider whether you or your organization could be a 
possible target. Some motives for mail bombs include revenge, extortion, love triangles, terrorism, and business disputes.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that a bomb can be enclosed in either a parcel or an envelope, and its outward appearance is limited only by 
the imagination of the sender. However, mail bombs have some unique characteristics which may assist you in identifying a 
suspect mailing. To apply these factors, it is important to know the type of mail your organization and your home receive.<br>
<br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Mail bombs may bear restricted endorsements such as &quot;Personal&quot; or &quot;Private.&quot; This factor is important when the 
addressee does not usually receive personal mail at the office.<br>
<br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Addressee's name/title may be inaccurate.<br>
<br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Mail bombs may reflect/distorted handwriting or the name and address may be prepared with homemade labels or 
cut-and-paste lettering. Mail bombs may have protruding wires, aluminum foil, or oil stains and may emit a peculiar odor.<br>
<br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Cancellation or postmark may show a different location than the return address.<br>
<br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Mail bombs may have excessive postage.<br>
<br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Letter bombs may feel rigid, or appear uneven or lopsided.<br>
<br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Parcel bombs may be unprofessionally wrapped with several combinations of tape used to secure the package and may 
be endorsed &quot;Fragile Handle With Care&quot; or &quot;Rush Do Not Delay.&quot;<br>
<br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Package bombs may have an irregular shape, soft spots, or bulges.<br>
<br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Package bombs may make a buzzing or ticking noise or a sloshing sound.<br>
<br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Pressure or resistance may be noted when removing contents from an envelope or parcel.<br>
<br>
<strong>IF YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS OF A MAILING AND ARE UNABLE TO VERIFY THE CONTENTS WITH 
THE ADDRESSEE OR SENDER:</strong><br>
<br>
<img src="Redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> 1. Do not open the article.<br>
<br>
<img src="Redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> 2. Isolate the mailing and evacuate the immediate area.<br>
<br>
<img src="Redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> 3. Do not put in water or a confined space such as a desk drawer or filing cabinet.<br>
<br>
<img src="Redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> 4. If possible, open windows in the immediate area to assist in venting potential explosive gases.<br>
<br>
<img src="Redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> 5. If you have any reason to believe a letter or parcel is suspicious, do not take a chance or worry about possible 
embarrassment if the item turns out to be innocent instead, contact your local police department and Postal Inspector for 
professional assistance.</p>

<p align=left><font size=5><strong>SECURITY PROBLEMS IN LATIN AMERICA</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<IMG SRC="/ltn-amer.gif" align=right>
<br>
The Chicago-based Emergency Response and Research Institute has recently made a study regarding security issues in 
Latin America. Throughout the region, several trends were seen. The most worrisome issues are non-political motivated 
and drug related crimes.<br>
<br>
Years ago, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, after the Castro regime was established in Cuba, many intelligence analysts 
predicted that Marxist-inspired guerrilla campaigns would overrun many of the governments in South and Central America. 
During that period of time, there were many rural and urban guerrilla campaigns in the region, most notably in Argentina, 
Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela.<br>
<br>
When the mid-1980s came around, guerrilla attacks against U.S. interests were taking place at the rate of one attack every 
ten days. They accounted for half of the terrorist attacks against U.S. targets, at the time. Western and Latin American 
businessmen were being kidnapped and murdered at an alarming rate.<br>
<br>
But today, as we enter the late 1990s, the security situation in Latin America is quite different. Less violence is perceived. 
There are better counter-insurgency techniques being employed by the governments. Marxist ideals have been discredited. 
And social reform, in many of the countries, has led to a smaller number of guerrilla activities. The only two Latin American 
countries with significant guerrilla problems are Colombia and Peru. Guerrillas still pop up in other countries in the region, 
but they are not seen to pose a significant threat to any governments.<br>
<br>
But still, while the guerrilla activity is on the list of security problems in Latin America, they are not at the top. More serious 
threats are posed by the very rapidly rising non-political motivated crime and drug-related crime.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>LATIN AMERICA DRUG CARTELS</strong></font><br>
<br>
Probably the number one security problem in Latin America concerns the very powerful illegal drug cartels. The centers of 
activity for these criminal groups are Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. As it has been said many times, these three countries are 
estimated to account for almost the entire world production of cocaine. It is believed that between 750 and 900 tons of 
coca are grown in these three countries every year. About 56 percent of it comes from Peru, 20 percent from Bolivia and 
11 percent from Colombia. Colombia is the main center of producing coca leaves into cocaine.<br>
<br>
The main exit points of distribution to Europe are in Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela. Most of the cocaine that is smuggled 
into Europe is concealed in shipping containers aboard ships that are enroute to Rotterdam or ports on the Mediterranean 
Sea -- such as Barcelona, Spain or Genoa, Italy. Authorities in Europe say that ports in the Baltic states are being used 
more and more. Also being seen is the drugs being shipped across the Atlantic in small boats and then the cargo is 
transferred aboard Spanish fishing vessels. And finally, an air route was recently discovered from West Africa into Europe.<br>
<br>
Small planes that fly along the Western Coast of Central America account for much of the cocaine that reaches the United 
States. The planes then drop their cargo at designated drop zones in the Eastern Caribbean Sea, where it is picked up by 
small boats. It is said that sometimes large shipments of cocaine are transported in commercial aircraft from Colombia and 
Mexico. Mexico has increasingly become an important base for drug smuggling into the United States.<br>
<br>
The powerful Colombian drug cartels are said to launder an estimated $2 billion a year in profits through legitimate 
companies that they own and/or control. These drug gangs are highly sophisticated. Evidence of their expertise and 
sophistication was discovered when police recently seized a computer that belonged to the Cali drug cartel. It was found 
out that the criminals had an extensive intelligence operation of their own that enabled them to tap telephone calls made into 
or out of Bogota -- including the telephones at the Colombian Defense Ministry.<br>
<br>
It is known that the Cali Cartel has its own military wing. The leader of the military wing was recently captured by 
Colombian authorities. This person, identified as Loiza Ceballos -- AKA &quot;The Scorpion&quot; -- is believed to have taken part 
in the massacre of 100 peasants who refused to cooperate with the cartel. The peasants were murdered with chainsaws.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>LATIN AMERICAN GUERRILLA GROUPS</strong></font><br>
<br>
Besides the problems with the powerful drug cartels, Colombia is also a hotspot for a very powerful guerrilla group, known 
as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). This group is believed to have 3,000 to 5,000 members. The 
FARC has become increasingly involved in the illegal drug trade. They have been involved in either the processing or the 
exporting of cocaine. Like a major commercial airport in the United States, the FARC demands as much as $15,000 per 
flight of every drug- carrying plane that takes off from an airstrip that they guard.<br>
<br>
The drug cartels are said to be willing to pay the guerrillas $20,000 for every plane or helicopter that is involved in 
anti-narcotics operations and that is shot down. In Peru, the guerrilla group known as Shining Path (SL) is said to provide 
similar services as the FARC.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>THE SOARING CRIME RATE IN LATIN AMERICA</strong></font><br>
<br>
Recent statistics indicate that crime is becoming the biggest problem in Latin America. In Colombia, one person was 
murdered every 15 minutes in the first three months of 1995. Mexico City is averaging about 543 crimes per day. 
Elsewhere in Mexico, armed gangs of rival drug smugglers have been fighting it out with one another, thus creating new 
hazards in rural areas.<br>
<br>
Crime is extremely high in all of the major cities in Brazil. Wealthy citizens have had to provide for their own security. In 
large parts of Rio de Janeiro, armed criminal gangs are said to be in control. The city of Sao Paulo is also very dangerous.<br>
<br>
A recent ERRI World Sitrep report indicated that violent crime is prevalent in and around Guatemala City. Public buses 
have become a favorite target of well-armed gangs in the area.<br>
<br>
Crime statistics are also very high in Honduras, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The police have not been able to handle the 
work load and the military have been called in to assist in these countries. There is a very distinct crime wave happening in 
Latin America.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>THE EMERGING MURDER AND KIDNAP INDUSTRY IN LATIN AMERICA</strong></font><br>
<br>
In 1994, Peru reported that there were about ten homicides committed in the country every day. Also in 1994, kidnappers 
in Guatemala were able to extort about $35 million for their victims. An average of three to four wealthy individuals were 
being kidnapped every month in Guatemala.<br>
<br>
Kidnapping is becoming a cottage industry in Latin America. A Japanese businessman from the Sanyo Corporation was 
just released unharmed after a $2 million ransom was paid for his release in Mexico. Authorities seem powerless to deal 
with the problem. Their advice to people reporting the kidnapping of a family member or a business associate? &quot;Pay the 
ransom.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>FUTURE TERRORISM IN LATIN AMERICA</strong></font><br>
<br>
A recent study reported that a number of Muslim militants are thought to be emigrating to Brazil. Many of these people are 
coming from Iran and they are bringing their fanatic Islamic fundamentalism with them. The report indicated that training 
camps are being set up in the jungles on the borders with Brazil and Argentina. The training camps are believed to be 
training local recruits in the tactics of guerrilla warfare and terrorism. Once a foothold of Islamic extremism is established in 
this region and additional &quot;troops&quot; trained, additional problems can be anticipated. Additional monitoring of this situation is 
warranted.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>OTHER PROBLEMS IN LATIN AMERICA</strong></font><br>
<br>
The major factor that breeds a large percentage of the crime and guerrilla activity is poverty. In recent survey conducted in 
Sao Paulo, Brazil, showed that about 4 million people were living in what was considered to be miserable conditions 
without adequate jobs, income or education.<br>
<br>
Some countries, such as Chile, have made great strides in overcoming these social ills. But, most of the nations in Latin 
America still have a long way to go.</p>

<H2>OAKLAND CONDUCTS CITYWIDE DISASTER DRILL...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

Last Thursday, a powerful 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck Oakland,
California.  Fires were started by the quake.  Freeways were
badly damaged.  Electrical power to the entire downtown section
of the city was knocked out.
<P>

What?  You say that you didn't hear about this happening?
Well ... it really didn't happen.  But for three hours on
Thursday, emergency response teams and city officials acted
like it was the real thing.  The quake was a simulated one
that was testing the city's readiness in the event of such
a disaster.
<P>

The Hayward Fault cuts right through the City of Oakland, that
is located across the bay from San Francisco and has a population
of more than 300,000 people.  Even a 5.0 magnitude earthquake is
more than enough to cause serious damage.
<P>

Henry Renteria, the emergency services manager of the Oakland Fire
Department, said, "We have to remind people over and over again
that it is not a matter of whether the big one is going to happen,
it's a matter of when."
<P>

On Thursday, the quake "hit" at 0900 PDT.  During the drill, police,
medical and military helicopters practiced landing in a vacant lot
located behind the federal building in downtown Oakland.  The
choppers were testing possible landing sites for transporting
injured victims.
<P>

At 1000 PDT, it was announced at City Hall that the "big one"
had indeed struck the city.  Across the street, at the Emergency
Operations Center, fire, police, medical officials and utilities
experts crowded into a room that was set up with computers, radios,
and damage summary charts.  Their job was to assess the disaster
and send needed public safety units to where they were needed.
<P>

A variety of reports came pouring into the Emergency Operations
Center.  A train derailment.  A hazardous materials spill.  A
large fire.  Damage to the freeway.  And even the escape of
three lions from the city zoo.  It was calculated that even
though this was a major earthquake -- only eight people were
killed and a little more than 200 were injured.
<P>

The drill received a grade of B-plus from the Assistant City
Manager.  Some glitches in the response were found and work
will begin to correct them before the real thing does hit.

<H2>Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown's Plane Confirmed Down Near Dubrovnik, Croatia</H2>
By: C. Staten
<P>
Weather conditions were described as "terrible" when Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown attempted to land at Dubrovnik, Croatia earlier today. Brown, who was on a trade mission with as many as fifteen (15) U.S. business leaders, was enroute from Tuzla, Bosnia. As they approached Dubrovnik, the U.S. Air Force T-43 (military version of 737), disappeared from radar screens. The exact passenger manifest is unknown at this time, but a total of 33 souls are believed to have been on-board.
<P>

According to Lt. General Howell Estes, Pentagon Joint Chief of Staff's Operations, a search and rescue (SAR) operation was immediately begun, involving both U.S. and local military forces. A crash site has been located and confirmed by SAR; it is located approx. 3km (1.8 miles) North-Northwest of the Dubrovnik airport. Both ground and air assets are reportedly either on the scene or enroute.  Gen. Estes said that a Special Forces C-130 aircraft was dispatched with medical and rescue personnel on-board.  Military forces in Croatia have reported that at least some rescue personnel may have arrived at the crash site, and that a local civilian doctor is reported to be there as well.  Casualty figures have not been confirmed by any official sources.  Weather conditions, terrain, and now darkness are reportedly hampering access to the site. 
<P>

Gen. Estes said that there were no radio transmissions that indicated that the plane was having problems prior to its disappearance. He said that the striken plane was on an "instrument landing system (ILS)" approach to Bubrovnik when the fateful event occurred. The Air force has confirmed that the T-43 aircraft has all of the standard features of the Boeing 737 civilian aircraft and some additional military hardware. Estes said that the he could not speculate, in any way, in regard to the cause of the crash, and refused to comment on other crashes involving 737 aircraft. Gen. Estes said that a complete investigation involving the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the FAA, and other civilian and military investigators will ensue as soon as possible.
<P>
Croatian political sources have today, twice, denied that there was any possibility that the crash was caused by "hostile action" on the part of any military or terrorist forces in the region. Military spokespersons say that they have no information in regard to a terrorist threat involving the plane.
<P>
ENN is following the events in Croatia and will provide updates as the information becomes available.

<font color="#FF0000"><font size=5><strong>US Initiates Cruise Missile Attack on Iraq</strong></font></font><br>
<br>
(ENN) According to military sources, an attack on command and control nets, Hawk Missile Batteries, and other selected 
targets has been undertaken by American forces this morning. The attack is believed to have begun at approx. 01:30EDT 
and was comprised of approx. 27 cruise missiles. The precision guided munitions were believed launched from both ships 
and at least one specially fitted B-52 bomber. <br>
<br>
Some military experts are speculating that the initial attack with cruise missiles may not be the only strike package that was 
to be launched on Iraq. It is possible that follow-on strikes will be executed by additional waves of planes, and that the 
cruise strike was used to supress radar and air defense systems. U.S. officials, however, have made no statements 
regarding the extent of this initial strike or any possible future strikes that might be carried out.<br>
<br>
Air raid sirens were reportedly heard in Baghdad, according to CNN reporters who are stationed there. The effect of the 
initial barrage of cruise missiles has not be reported by the military or media outlets in the region. ENN will continue to 
monitor this developing story and provide additional details as they become available.<br>

have killed eight people and injured dozens of others.  The Governor
of the State of Alabama declared a state of emergency on Wednesday
when a storm cut a ten-mile swath of destruction in the west-central
portion of the state.  Trees were reported snapped, electrical power
to 20,000 people was cut and various amount of other destruction by
the powerful storm was reported.  A dam in one city burst and sent
millions of gallons of water into city streets.
<P>

In Dallas County, located north of Selma, Alabama, four people were
killed and 40 others were injured when a tornado struck a mobile
trailer park.  Two people were killed and 13 others were injured when
another tornado struck another trailer park in Montgomery, located
about 50 miles east of Selma.
<P>  

Later in the evening on Wednesday, a thunderstorm was said to be
responsible for the death of one person who was killed when their
mobile home was destroyed.
<P>

In East Georgia on Thursday morning, Five people were injured by a
tornado that struck a rural area near the town of Wrens.  Seven
homes were reported destroyed and 13 others suffered heavy damage.

<H2>THINGS IMPROVE IN EAST ST. LOUIS, ILLINOIS...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

There was a time, in the not so distant past, that life as being
a police officer in East St. Louis, Illinois, was like a sentence
to purgatory.  For those readers who have never heard of the city
of East St. Louis, it is a city in southern Illinois that once had 
a population of almost 70,000 people.  About 20 years ago, the
city developed very serious financial difficulties.  Today, it has
a population of about 38,000.  The financial situation was so bad
that it was once the subject of a CBS 60 Minutes report.
<P>

In the past, officers received their paychecks very erratically.  
Sometimes going six weeks without being paid.  For ten years, new
hiring was frozen.  Police cars broke down and were not replaced
or repaired.  The situation involving the patrol cars was so bad that
officers rode three to a car.  The police radios broke down and were
not replaced or repaired.  The communications problem was so bad that
officers had to communicate with headquarters the old fashioned way
by using the telephone. A fact that's hard to imagine at the end of the 20th century.
<P>

One sergeant, a 25-year veteran of the force, said, "A lot of times
we couldn't catch thieves because our top speed was 50 MPH.  You go
any faster than that and your car would start sputtering." One local businessman joked, "Four or five years ago, I could outrun their police cars on foot." About five years ago, things got so bad, money-wise, that the city ran out of gasoline for the police cars.
<P>

But today, things have finally turned around.  Officers now have
new cars, new radios, new guns, new members and, more importantly,
a new attitude. The main reason for the turnaround is a large influx of money from
a riverboat casino that in 1993 opened up on the Mississippi River.
<P>
An amazing fact is that, in 1991, the East St.Louis Police Department
had only seven police cars.  Today it has 54.  The budget for the
department is now at $4 million per year.
<P>

The police department in this mostly black community did not enjoy
a good reputation amongst its citizens.  But, it seems, that is
changing.  Said one resident of the city, "We used to call the police
and you might not even see them.  We're trying to trust the police now."
The homicide rate of the town has dropped almost fifty percent in
the last four years.  In 1991, 62 people were murdered in the city.
In 1995, the number of homicides had dropped to 33.
<P>
Besides the money from the riverboat casino, the department also
received a federal Community-Oriented Policing (COP) grant.  This
helped the city hire about 40 new police officers.  The department
now has 87 members. The department also cooperates very heavily with federal, state, county
and other local departments.  The city now even has what they call a
"Delta Team" that specializes in raids on drug dealers.
<P>
This is a far cry from 1977 when a consulting firm recommended that
the East St.Louis Police Department be disbanded.  In 1990, the
State of Illinois took over the finances of the city, a situation
that it still controls. Overall, things are looking much brighter in this city that has
essentially been to hell and back.  That's good for its citizens
and for its police department.

<TITLE>Muslim Incursion Into Africa</TITLE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 21:00CDT-05/06/96
<P>
<center><H2>Muslim Incursion Into Africa</H2>
<H3> ENN Investigative Report</H3>
By Clark Staten, Analyst</center>
<P>

Chicago, IL, May 6, 1996, (ENN)-- An increasing amount of evidence would suggest that there is an emerging Muslim insurgency in Central and Southern Africa and that world leaders should be prepared for Islamic Fundamentalist inspired terrorism and attempted destabilization of a number of governments in that region.  Analysts at the Chicago-based Emergency Response & Research Institute(ERRI) have been following developments and interviewing African experts about what appears to be a rising tide of anti-American/Israeli and pro-Muslim sentiment in parts of the African continent.
<P>

Recent events in Liberia, Uganda, S. Africa and elsewhere would suggest that an "infiltration" of Muslim extremists has been going on in Central and South Africa for the past several years. While many analysts were aware of religious and political conflicts and heavy Muslim activity in North African countries like Somalia, Algeria, Chad, Libya, and Sudan, few reports of Islamic "colonization" in Middle or Southern Africa have been received.
<P>

According to longtime African analysts, the Muslim influence has been insidious in it's spread and often accomplished by "behind-the scenes" financing and arming various tribes and factions that are already in conflict. One report alleges that Islamic "advisors" from Iran and Lebanon have been providing weapons and explosives to various African groups since at least 1990, and have ingratiated themselves in the inner circles of a number of African regimes'.
<P>

A typical example of this increasingly alarming activity, cited by ERRI analysts, involves a demonstration and assault on the U.S. Embassy in Cape Town, S. Africa that took place on 05/02/96. During that siege, several hundred alleged Islamic supporters were seen burning flags and shouting, "Death to Israel" and "Death to America." Embassy guards and Cape Town police were forced to fire rubber bullets and warning shots with automatic weapons in order to repulse the crowd, which seemed intent on breaching the Embassy compound.  Concerns have been raised by Israel, within the past two weeks, about an increasing Hezbollah presence in S. Africa and the possibility that they are operating Islamic extremist training camps in that region.
<P>
 
Another example involves the current situation in Liberia, where hundreds of Americans have been forced to evacuate the country. Marine guards at the U.S. Embassy have returned automatic weapons fire on at least two recent occasions and allegedly killed two Liberian citizens. Muslim involvement in Liberia was previously thought to almost nonexistent, but intelligence data gathered by ENN, in the past few weeks, would suggest that there may be Islamic involvement and financing for at least one of the factions there.
<P>

Radical Islamic Fundamentalism does seem to have a compelling appeal for those in developing nations. It adds the aura of an ancient religion to a promise of monetary aid and revolutionary support. In a volatile area such as Africa, even a modest investment by Islamic extremists may help them to gain valuable influence and access to the highest levels of some governments. With this access often comes land to be developed into covert training camps, passport assistance, use of "diplomatic pouches", and use of secure communications equipment.
<P>

The preliminary evidence would suggest that Islamic Fundamentalists may have established a "foothold" in central and southern Africa countries and can be expected to continue to expand their efforts on the African continent in the foreseeable future.  With this incursion comes the problems seen in Mid-East in the past ten years and the turmoil associated with the violent overthrow of established governments, in favor of theocratic Islamic rule.

<H2>'Roofies', The New "Date Rape" Drug of Choice</H2>
By Clark Staten, ERRI Executive Director
<P>

Chicago, IL., January 6, 1995 (ENN) --Like the Quaaludes of the
60's and 70's, there is a new "love drug" being abused in
several parts of the country.  The drug is Rohypnol, or
"Roofies" as it being is called on the street. It is also called
"ruffies", "roche", "R-2", "rib" and "rope" and reportedly is
quickly becoming the "date rape drug of choice."
<P>

Rohypnol is a brand name for flunitrazepam (a benzodiazepine), a
very potent tranquilizer similar in nature to valium (diazepam),
but many times stronger. The drug produces a sedative effect,
amnesia, muscle relaxation, and a slowing of psychomotor
responses. Sedation occurs 20-30 minutes after administration
and lasts for several hours. The drug is often distributed on the street in
it's original "bubble packaging" which adds an air of legitimacy
and makes it appear to be legal. The drug is not commonly used
by physicians in the United States and is not even listed in the
commonly used Physician's Desk Reference.
<P>

Illicit use of Rohypnol was originally reported in Europe in the
late 1970's and world-wide use of it has continually increased
since then. According to police sources in both Florida and
Texas, "roofies" were first seen in the United States in the
early 1990's; they quickly gained acceptance and use by both
high school and college students. According to the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) more than 1,000 cases of
illegal Rohypnol possession have been reported recently, in
thirteen states. Reports have also been received of it being
popular in "gay bars" in selected locations on both the East and
West coasts.  In fact, Rohypnol is now being reported as being
one of the "in" drugs on high school and college campuses and
particularly in college fraternities. And to make matters worse,
"Roofies" are inexpensive and reportedly being sold for as
little as $2.00-$4.00 per tablet in several locations.
<P>

According to a University of Florida drug hotline, "Roofies" are
often combined with alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine to produce a
rapid and very dramatic "high".  Even when used by itself, users
can appear extremely intoxicated, with slurred speech, no
coordination, swaying, and blood-shot eyes...with no odor of
alcohol. The drug has been added to punch and other drinks at
fraternity parties and college social gatherings, where it is
reportedly given to female party participants in hopes of
lowered inhibitions and facilitating potential sexual conquest. Police
departments in several parts of the country say that after
ingestion of "Roofies" that several young women have reported
waking up in frat houses with no clothes on, finding themselves
in unfamiliar surroundings with unfamiliar people, or having
actually been sexually assaulted while under the influence of
the drug. 
<P>

As insidious, disgusting and perilous as this may sound, the
dangers don't stop there. Besides the worries of unprotected
sex, Rohypnol, particularly when mixed with alcohol or other
drugs may lead to respiratory depression, aspiration, and even
death. When taken repeatedly, it can lead to physical and
psychic dependence, which is thought to increase with both dose
and duration of use. An amnesia producing effect of "Roofies"
may prevent users from remembering how or why they took the drug
or even that they were given it by others. This makes
investigation of sexually related or other offenses very
difficult and may account for repeated reports of "date rapes"
involving the use of the drug.
<P>

Both law enforcement and drug counseling services caution that
the use of Rohypnol is increasing and that additional quantities
of it are being imported across the Mexican border, where it can
be obtained by prescription. ERRI drug abuse analysts warn that
"Roofies" are  just another in a long list of dangerous drugs
that are being imported and "pushed" to the impressionable youth
of this country.

<p align=center><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4>By: Clark Staten, EMT-Paramedic<br>
Past Chairman, National Society of EMS Administrators</font></font></p>
<p>The 90's have been described by some as the &quot;Information Age&quot;. Undoubtedly, the events of the past decade have 
changed the way in which we record, transfer, store, retrieve, and evaluate information. In large part, the advent of 
the personal computer (PC) has drastically affected the way we perceive and utilize information. It's introduction has 
opened new possibilities for personal, professional, and organizational growth and development. </p>
<p>During the past ten years, vast strides have been made in regard to emergency service administration and operations. 
More enlightened members of the emergency response community have discovered that there are many more 
effective and efficient ways to direct and analyze our function. Many forward-thinking emergency managers have 
adopted methods and practices developed in the private sector and created hybrid models for use in Fire, Police, 
and EMS departments. </p>
<p>In order to better understand the advances that have been made, and to explore the applications of the future, we 
need to review the history and capabilities of personal computers. In this retrospection, let's move backward in time 
and examine the technology and how it has changed the emergency services. </p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>THE 1970's AND BEFORE (THE PAST): </strong></font></font></p>
<p>One of the first computers was called ENIAC; it weighed thirty (30) tons, was two stories high, and covered more 
than fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet of space. It was built and went into operation in 1946. It did amazing 
things for it's time. </p>
<p>It is probably not commonly known that the International Business Machine (IBM) Company did not introduce a 
desk-top personal computer until 1981. Several other desk-top computers had, however, been introduced by 
various other companies in the late 70's. Names that come to mind were Osborne, Apple, Tandy, Kaypro, Xerox, 
Victor, and Morrow. The late 1970's and early 1980s were a turbulent time in the development of PC's, as various 
manufacturers attempted to transfer known technology from &quot;Mainframes&quot; to small computer platforms. </p>
<p>The early PC's were vastly underpowered and slow, by today's standards. Many did not have hard disk drives, and 
other stored data on &quot;cassette-type&quot; tape drives. Extended or expanded memory were still a dream. Many small 
platforms actually had less than 640K of RAM (Random Access Memory), and yet users were amazed about the 
way that the 8086 and 8088 CPU (Central Processing Unit) machines performed (e.g. forerunners to 80286, 
80386, 80486 central processors of the 80's &amp; 90's). Color monitors were not in use and no one had ever heard of 
a &quot;Mouse&quot; pointing device. </p>
<p>Early users were thrilled that the &quot;micro-computer&quot; was finally on their desk. They no longer had to access or learn 
mainframe operating systems. They suddenly could control the input and output of data, rather than depending on a 
&quot;computer specialist&quot; in some other agency or department. The &quot;personal computer (PC) revolution&quot; had begun. </p>
<p>Early emergency service applications of computer power were primarily run on large mainframe type machines and 
were generally limited to personnel and inventory records. The advent of PC's changed the uses of computers in 
several areas of emergency operations. The earliest transferences of work probably occured in the administrative 
areas of police and fire departments. As in private industry, emergency service secretaries and record keepers 
quickly saw the capability and suitability of personal computers for inputting, storing, and retrieving of temporary 
data. </p>
<p>Another important task that was developed for the emergency computers was that of computer-aided-dispatching 
(C.A.D) of emergency equipment. So called &quot;system status management&quot; programs were developed that helped 
managers/dispatchers to effectively allocate resources, based on availability and public demand. Most were data 
&quot;input-intensive&quot; and required dispatchers to spend a great deal of time keypunching information into the database. </p>
<p>Communication, in general, were changed by digital and &quot;chip&quot; technology. Radio frequencies could be then be 
synthesized rather than crystal controlled. This ability caused far greater latitude and control of frequency changing 
capabilities and allowed radios to be smaller and have more features. With digital chip technology, a hand-held 
transciever or scanner could listen or transmit on as many as one-hundred frequencies. </p>
<p>All in all, the 1970's and early 80's saw tremendous advances in both technology and the use of it. However, it 
should be noted that during the 70's and early 80's, many emergency response agencies and personnel didn't avail 
themselves of the advances in computer technology. Whether it was the complexity of the process, or the mindset of 
the emergency community; most did not develop the skills or buy the equipment needed to apply the benefits of the 
vast technical advances that had taken place. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, all too many departments were mired in the traditions and practices of the past. Veteran fire and 
police officials did not understand the technology or it's uses. It was, therefore, easier to cling to the file cabinets, 
telegraph keys, and paperwork of the past than to accept the computer technology and young &quot;technocrats&quot; of the 
future. </p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>The 1980's &amp; 90's (THE PRESENT): </strong></font></font></p>
<p>Remember ENIAC from the past (see Pg.1)? It is interesting to note that the fact that a 1990's model laptop 
386/33Mz IBM Clone can add, subtract, and perform math functions at least fifty times faster than the earlier, 
gigantic, ENIAC. Current hardware is so sophisticated that it can cause millions of instructions to be instantaneously 
passed to various components within the computer in a matter of seconds. </p>
<p>At the risk of being accused of using a cliche' of today, the 1980's and 1990's have been &quot;awesome&quot; in terms of 
technical advances in personal computer technology. Probably, no one decade in history saw more or greater 
changes in our capability to develop and manage information than did the last one. </p>
<p>The desk-top computing machines became smaller, lighter, faster, and more graphically capable. The intricate DOS 
(Disk Operating System) command line systems of the past were replaced with various kinds of GUI's (Graphic 
User Interfaces....with MicroSoft's Windows being a typical example. Various kinds of &quot;mouse&quot; pointing devices 
became part of our computer vernacular. Computer Central Processing Units (CPUs) have come from a speed of 
4.77MHz in the late 70's to 50MHz in some current 1990's models (X10 increase in speed). </p>
<p>Advancements in computer software have kept pace with the development of hardware. New and complex software 
has been developed that will allow users to easily perform accounting, word processing, desk-top publishing, 
graphics, computer- aided-design, and many other functions. Demographics, population shifts, inventory control, 
equipment use data, nter-active training, and other types of analysis programs are benefiting the manager of today. 
By combining faster hardware with more sophisticated software, greater productivity has been demonstrated. 
Business and government have began to sit-up and take notice. </p>
<p>The emergency services have also benefited from this surge in the advancement of technology. Computer work 
terminals have been placed on Local Area Networks (LANS) in many fire/police/ems stations. Municipal response 
records are now frequently kept by entering data at the station terminal or even from a mobile terminal in a vehicle. 
Several police agencies have mobile cellular or radio links directly from a car to the NCIC (National Crime 
Information Center) or state computer mainframe system. </p>
<p>This networking arrangement the police with almost instantaneous information on &quot;wants and warrants&quot;, as well as 
providing a &quot;rap sheet&quot; of past offfense for the person entered into the system. A similar setup also allows 
paramedics to keep Mobile Intensive Care Reports, and firefighters to keep NFIRS (National Fire Information 
Report system). </p>
<p>Many emergency communication centers and hazardous materials units are reported to be carrying cellular 
technology and on- board computers that allow access to; water grid maps, addresses, phone numbers, chemical 
databases, MSDS sheet programs, occupancy databases, fire safety inspections and building preplans. Almost any 
database that can be accessed on a telephone land-line can be used, directly from the scene. This provides incident 
commanders with a vast amount of available information upon which to make better decisions. </p>
<p>Computer technology has also enabled the development of cellular telephone technology. Mobile telephones and 
pagers have had a tremendous impact on business and emergency response agencies. Current chip configurations for 
hand-held portable telephones make them light weight enough to be taken almost anywhere....including the scene of 
an emergency. With the added reliability and country-wide accessibility of these &quot;tiny&quot; transceivers, and the launching 
of several &quot;SAT-COM&quot; satellites, it would appear possible to communicate with anyone....anywhere. </p>
<p>Many emergency dispatch centers have installed computer work stations for each dispatcher. These work stations 
expidite and assist the decision-making process and maintain an ongoing list of available resources. In more 
sophisticated systems, Loran-C radio locaters uses satellite triangulation technology to locate vehicles and radio 
transmitters to within 100 ft. of their actual location on a computer generated city grid map. Personnel emergencies 
are immediately reported with the touch of a button, as well as the location of the distress signal. </p>
<p>More advanced systems also record and maintain a history of a given address/location for future reference. This 
history keeping capability provides a list of past occurances at a specific location. It could also be used to store and 
catagorize patients, past medical conditions, and medications. A criminal history of an individual or location could 
also be stored and generated. Many municipalities have found the practicality of sharing information between 
emergency agencies and several have joint communications centers that can access the same databases. 
Computer-Aided- Dispatch of the past has grown up. </p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>THE FUTURE: </strong></font></font></p>
<p>Future developments in the use of computers stagger the imagination. Someday soon, we will probably see computer 
terminals in the front of most Police, Fire, and EMS vehicles. These terminals will direct us to the scene of the 
emergency with digitalized street maps. The terminal will provide information about any incident that has occured at 
the location previously. It will give us pre-plans for hazardous materials or other dangerous situations. The terminal 
will generate response time and other pertinent reports that will track our progress and efficiency. </p>
<p>On-Board our &quot;vehicles of the future&quot; we will have computer controlled communication units with radio repeater 
capabilities. Each crew member will wear a comfortable, lightweight headset that will enable communication with 
each other, the dispatch center, the hospital, the city computer, a voice mail, and record keeping system. The radio 
systems will be multi-tasked and trunked, so that any department can communicate with any other... instantaneously. </p>
<p>Medical records will be obtained and stored by simply saying, &quot;Computer....Recorder on!&quot;. The computer will then 
constantly monitor Electrocardiogram reading, drug drips, and record any and all findings that the medics note. 
Further miniaturization will allow blood gas analysis and other blood studies to be done at the scene and almost 
instantly. Treatment protocals will be immediately available, either by radio link to a physician or direcrted by a 
computer library with an artificial intelligence &quot;expert system&quot;. </p>
<p>Computerization of &quot;CAT-SCAN&quot; type equipment, using sound waves or other electronic phenomena will give 
detailed analysis of the body and facilitate appropriate trauma and medical emergency treatment. Patient assessment 
data that is being gathered and recorded by the on-board vehicle computer will be instantly reviewable by the 
hospital that is going to recieve the patient. Diversions of ambulances will be computer determined and will 
automatically take into consideration the patient load and capability of each receiving facility. </p>
<p>Identification of an unidentified criminals will be accomplished by matching an &quot;on-scene&quot; computer generated video 
image of the suspect and database records of all known or suspected perpetrators. Fingerprints will also be obtained 
and matched by computer to verify an identification process. A complete history of the criminal, his methods of 
operation (M.O.), and current suspicions will be compared by the computer and analysis given to the police 
investigator for his/her action. Comparison &quot;mug-shots&quot; will be computer drawn at the scene and witnesses will then 
be able to identify any matching suspects in a timely manner. </p>
<p>Known criminals or mental patients that are &quot;on-the-streets&quot; could be electronically tagged with a emitter that could 
automatically be tracked by a computer. Electronic release programs could be expanded to include almost all 
non-violent offenders with the aid of computer surveillance. A computer record would constantly be recorded of the 
movement of these monitored individuals, and could be immediately reviewed in the event of suspicion. Security 
computers could automatically note any unusual movement or action on the part of any convicted criminal and 
activate an police alarm mode that would direct him/her to be detained by the nearest police unit or, (if necessary to 
prevent a violent act), &quot;shocked and disabled&quot; by a built-in &quot;taser-type&quot; device. While civil libertarians might balk at 
such a system, repeat offenses and offenders could become a thing of the past. </p>
<p>The same sort of locater devices could be used to insure firefighter/rescuer safety. A computer tracking device could 
identify an individual or unit at the scene of a large emergency and provide an ongoing monitoring of their location 
and consciousness. If the rescuer were to become incapacitated, or didn't move for a predetermined amount of time, 
am alarm would sound at the command post. This alarm could also be activated by pushing a portable radio button, 
or activating an emergency beacon manually. If radio contact could not be established, a search of the last known 
location of the individual could be undertaken immediately. </p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong></font></font></p>
<p>The effective uses of computers in the emergency services environment have just begun to be realized. Undoubtedly, 
many more applications and capabilities will be discovered and exploited during the coming years. Computer experts 
predict that many of the author's &quot;predictions of the future&quot; are closer than many of us might realize. Many, if not 
most of these ideas, can be expected to come into being (in some form) during the career of today's &quot;rookie&quot; police 
officer, firefighter, or EMT. </p>
<p>The capability and practicality of the emergency service computers of tommorow will be determined by the needs 
that are identified and developed.... today. It would appear to be the responsibility of those emergency responders 
that have some expertise or ability in this area to foster and facilitate the effective use of our future computer 
resources. </p>
<p>Without the imput and guidance of the &quot;computer pioneers&quot; of today, we can not achieve the maximum benefit for the 
emergency responders and citizens of tommorow. With that devotion and participation..... many lives can be saved, 
our jobs can be performed more effectively, and our world can become a happier, healthier, and safer place. </p>

<P>
<H2>Iran "Officially" Sending Troops to Bosnia </H2>
Chicago, IL, November 29, 1994 --A group of Basij, volunteer
revolutionary guards, may soon be on the way to fight alongside
other Moslems in Bosnia.  According to the official IRNA news
agency, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been formally requested to
order troops to Bosnia by the important Iranian Propagation
Organization (IPO).
<P>

Although earlier rebuked by Khamenei in efforts to publicly send
troops to Bosnia, some believe that this latest call for Iranian
assistance may be an effort to legitimize a covert effort that
has reportedly been ongoing for several months.  Unconfirmed
intelligence reports, out of Bosnia, say that Iranian fighters
have been serving in the Bihac area and elsewhere in Bosnia,
since last year.  One purposefully unidentified
counter-terrorist expert went so far as to say that Bosnia may
have become the latest "training ground" for Iranian "special
forces".
<P>

 Basij is the Iranian name for a group of "volunteers" that
served at the pleasure of the Revolutionary Guard during the
Iran/Iraq war from 1980-1988.  Fanatical in nature, members of
Basij reportedly were involved in "human wave" attacks that were
somewhat successful against fixed Iraqi positions.
<P>  

The IPO is a Iranian government sponsored organization that
frequently issues public statements on behalf of the Islamic
Shi'ite community in Iran.  The IPO is reportedly attempting to
rouse Arab anger throughout the Mideast, in regard to the
potential collapse of the U.N. contingent in the Moslem
controlled "safe haven" of Bihac.  In recent days, they have
called for demonstrations against U.N. and NATO pull-backs and
criticized peacekeeping efforts for having "abandoning Moslem
forces" in several regions in Bosnia.
<P>

In light of the possible eminent collapse and surrender of
Bihac, intelligence analysts say that Iran's only potential
response may be to engage in a "guerrilla war" against Serbian
forces that control many parts of the war-torn country.  They
say that organized Bosnian Moslem resistance may completely
collapse soon, and that U.N. forces may be evacuated at any
time. 
<P> 

Counter-terrorist analysts also say that, in light of any
documented Iranian involvement in Bosnia, that the recent
reversal in the American policy regarding discontinuance of the
European sponsored arms embargo against Bosnia may be
ill-advised.  They say that they fear that any new arms and
supplies that are shipped to Bosnian Moslems will eventually
fall into the hands of Iran and her surrogate "volunteers",
serving in that area.  One expert cautioned that shipping arms
to Bosnia may be "the same as shipping them to Iran". Questions
remain as to if, or when, Iran will "officially" enter the war
in Bosnia.
<P>

<H3>Freight Train Crash/Fire Kills Two; Starts Wildfire</H3>

Two freight trains collided and exploded into a huge ball of
flame in western Australia on Sunday morning.  An engineer and
a boy were killed and another engineer was reported to be in
critical condition.
<P>
A fire reported to be half-a-mile long was set off by the collision.
One of the trains was said to be carrying diesel fuel.  Brushfires
were started by the blaze and more than 100 firefighters fought to
contain the flames.  The incident happened on Sunday (01/14/96)
at about 12:30 a.m., about 155 miles east of Perth on the western 
coast of Australia.
<P>
A man, who was first to reach the scene of the crash, said, "There
was a big ball of fire.  I dragged the man out.  He was engulfed in
flames, but I couldn't reach the others, it was too hot.  I could
hear them screaming for help, but there was nothing I could do."
<P>
A police inspector said that one train was traveling west on the
main Perth line and it crashed into the last nine cars of another
train pulling off the main line.  It was believed that the boy, who
was killed, was a family friend of one of the engineers.

<H2>FEMA FLOOD HIGHLIGHTS</H2>

Following are selected highlights of current federal government response and recovery activities for the flood disasters in Middle Atlantic and Northeastern states.  The situation in brief as of Friday, January 26, 1996:
<P>

     To date, more than 300 FEMA personnel have been deployed to
     support disaster operations in the Middle-Atlantic and
     Northeastern states hit by flooding that began January 19.
     The Small Business Administration has also deployed 178
     personnel, and 930 American Red Cross staff have joined
     some 1,800 local ARC volunteers in the affected areas.
     According to state officials, there are now 25 confirmed
     fatalities (13 in Pennsylvania, 10 in New York, two in
     Vermont).  The National Weather Service says warmer
     temperatures with precipitation are predicted in the
     Mid-Atlantic states through mid-day Saturday.  Rain in
     Pennsylvania yesterday (Thursday, January 25) caused
     renewed localized flooding in some areas.  A new major
     winter storm is forecast for tonight in New England.
<P>

     Yesterday, President Clinton announced that all remaining
     Pennsylvania counties had been added to the major disaster
     declaration he signed last Sunday, making all 67 counties
     in the Commonwealth eligible for federal disaster aid to
     individuals and families.  The following Pennsylvania
     counties have also been designated eligible to receive
     public assistance (to repair or rebuild public buildings
     and infrastructure) and hazard mitigation funds:
     Allegheny, Bedford, Bradford, Clinton, Dauphin, Huntingdon,
     Lackawanna, Luzerne, Lycoming, Potter, Susquehanna, Wayne,
     Westmoreland and Wyoming.
<P>

     FEMA's Disaster Field Office in Harrisburg is coordinating
     federal disaster operations in Pennsylvania.  Disaster
     Recovery Centers (DRCs) are opening today in the following
     Pennsylvania counties:  Allegheny (in the city of
     Monroeville), Bedford (Everett), Blair (Altoona), Dauphin
     (Harrisburg), Lackawanna (Scranton), Luzerne (Plains)
     Lycoming (Williamsport), Mifflin (Lewistown),
     Northumberland (Sunbury) and Westmoreland (Greensburg).
     Flood victims should visit their nearest DRC to learn what
     types of assistance are available and discuss their needs
     with representatives from the various agencies involved in
     the relief effort.
<P>


     As of 4:00 p.m. (EST) on Friday, January 26, FEMA's
     teleregistration line had received about 14,000
     applications for disaster assistance from flood victims in
     Pennsylvania (11,812), New York (942), Maryland (441) and
     West Virginia (650).  Individuals and businesses may apply
     for disaster assistance by calling the toll-free number,
     1-800-462-9029, or 1-800-462-7585 (TDD) for the hearing and
     speech impaired.
<P>

     The number of Pennsylvania flood victims housed in shelters
     Thursday night dropped dramatically, from approximately
     3,100 persons in 116 shelters Wednesday night to only 224
     persons in nine shelters.
<P>

     A FEMA Disaster Field Office is opening today in Owings
     Mills, Maryland, to coordinate federal disaster operations
     in the five Maryland counties designated eligible for
     federal assistance: Allegheny, Cecil, Frederick, Garrett
     and Washington. Today or tomorrow, a Disaster Recovery
     Center will open in each of these counties.
<P>

     A Disaster Field Office also opened today in Charleston,
     West Virgina, to coordinate Federal flood relief in that
     state.  On Thursday, President Clinton issued a major
     disaster declaration for 21 W. Va. counties, making
     residents and business owners there eligible for
     assistance.  Designated counties are Brooke, Grant,
     Greenbriar, Hampshire, Hancock, Hardy, Marshall, Mason,
     Monroe, Ohio, Pendleton, Pleasants, Pocahontas, Preston,
     Randolph, Summers, Tucker, Tyler, Webster, Wetzel and
     Wood.  Initial reports indicate 8,325 homes affected and
     over $24.2 million in damages to public facilities and
     infrastructure.  The same counties have been designated
     eligible for hazard mitigation funds and--with the
     exception of Hampshire, Mason and Wood Counties--are also
     eligible for public assistance.
<P>

     Late yesterday, President Clinton declared the state of New
     York to be a federal disaster area, and six counties
     (Chemung, Delaware, Schoharie, Steuben, Sullivan and
     Ulster) were designated to receive individual assistance.
     Seven FEMA/State preliminary damage assessment teams
     continue to survey impacted areas, and additional county
     designations are possible.  Initial county designations for
     public assistance and hazard mitigation are under review.
     By this afternoon, FEMA had received 537 applications for
     individual assistance.  A Disaster Field Office is being
     established in Oneonta, NY (Delaware Co.) to coordinate
     federal operations.
<P>

     Maryland also received a Presidential disaster declaration
     yesterday, and preliminary damage assessments have been
     completed in the counties initially designated (Allegany,
     Cecil, Frederick, Garrett and Washington), and first
     reports indicate 684 homes, 18 mobile homes, and 43
     businesses damaged or destroyed.  FEMA Community Relations
     personnel are being deployed to ensure that all flood
     victims are aware of the types of assistance available and
     how to register.
<P>


     Preliminary damage assessments have been completed in eight
     flood-stricken Ohio counties, and a disaster declaration
     request is under review by FEMA.  The eight affected
     counties are: Columbiana, Meigs, Lawrence, Monroe,
     Jefferson, Hamilton, Belmont and Washington.  Ohio state
     officials report more than 2,000 homes and businesses are
     affected, with approximately $5 million in uninsured
     damages, and they estimate public facility and
     infrastructure losses total approximately $11 million.
<P>

     Several other states have also been hit by recent
     flooding.  In Virginia, federal-state preliminary damage
     assessments are underway in eleven counties (Allegheny,
     Augusta, Bath, Botetourt, Frederick, Highland, Loudon,
     Rochbridge, Rockingham, Shenandoah and Warren) and two
     incorporated cities (Covington and Harrisonburg).  In
     Vermont, preliminary damage assessments began yesterday in
     five counties:  Caledonia, Chittenden, Franklin, Washington
     and Windsor.  Nine counties have been affected in New
     Jersey, and the state may seek Small Business
     Administration disaster loans.

<H3>FOG CAUSES 74-CAR MVA ON NY/NJ PARKWAY</H3>
BY JIM FAY,  ENN NYC/NJ METRO CORRESPONDENT
<P>
Thick fog on a major NY-to-NJ parkway caused a 74 car chain-reaction
collision yesterday, that, remarkably,  resulted in only 16 injuries, none
life-threatening.
<P>
At approximately 1130 hrs., EST,  Officers from the Palisades Interstate
Parkway Police responded to a report of a multi-vehicle accident,
southbound on the Parkway, approximately one mile south of Exit 2, near
the town of Alpine, NJ.  Upon arrival, the officers discovered numerous cars
involved, with several of the vehicles in the surrounding trees and at least
one overturned.
<P>
The Palisades Parkway is a main route from the Bear Mountain region of
New York State, down into New Jersey, and directly connects to the
George Washington Bridge into NYC.
<P>
Realizing the extent of the incident,  patrol officers on the scene requested
all the volunteer ambulance corps from the towns that abut the Parkway.
In addition,  the Heavy Rescue Truck from the Closter (NJ) Volunteer
Ambulance Corps was dispatched.  At least two extrication's were
required.
<P>
The fog, while thick, was sporadic on the Parkway. This reporter had
just traveled the same route only minutes before the first accident
occurred.  Ironically, a clear area with no fog was just about a half a
mile south of the scene.
<P>
While police and Volunteer EMS and Fire Personnel were operating
at this accident, another rear end collision, chain reaction accident
occurred about one mile north. Again, fog was the culprit, assisted
by fast moving vehicles.  This one was just north of the same Exit 2,
with the same situation.  Volunteer Ambulance Corps, already
suffering from a lack of daytime personnel, were sent into a Mutual
Aid mode.  Ambulance Corps and Paramedic Units from throughout
Eastern Bergen County, as well as Rockland County in New York
State,  were dispatched.  In addition, police from the surrounding
towns of Closter, Alpine, Tenafly, Englewood Cliffs and the Bergen
County Police responded to both scenes,  as well as to handle the
massive traffic situation in the normally bucolic area.
<P>
The extent of the operation can be measured by the fact that two
separate triage areas were set up to handle the injuries.  A total of 74 cars
were involved in the two accidents. While many of the cars involved
were seriously damaged, many were "fender-bender" type of accidents,
consisting of crushed grills and broken headlights.

(Updated 03/03/96)
<P>
<p><font size=5>FOUR AGENTS KILLED, FOURTEEN WOUNDED IN CULT 
ASSAULT </font></p>
<p>Waco, TX - A bloody assault has been carried out by agents of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
and Firearms (BATF) at the Mount Carmel compound of a little known religious sect called &quot;Branch 
Davidian&quot;, ten miles East of here. The original raid to serve warrants occurred early on Sunday morning 
(Feb. 28th) and was supposed to have been a &quot;complete surprise&quot;; unfortunately it wasn't a surprise and 
four BATF agents were killed and sixteen wounded by forty- five minutes of withering automatic gunfire 
from inside the compound. </p>
<p>BATF agents killed were Conway LeBleu-age 30, of Hammond LA, Todd Mckeehan-age 28, of 
Mandelville, LA, Robert Williams-age 26, of Little Rock, AK, and Steven Wills-age 32, of Houston, 
TX. Of the sixteen (16) other agents that were injured, most were said to have been shot by automatic 
weapons fire . . . including that from a .50 caliber machinegun. According to BATF agent and 
spokesperson Sharon Wheeler, &quot;The problem was that we were outgunned . . . and we couldn't fire 
randomly into the building because of women and children known to be in there.&quot; </p>
<p>The stand-off between the off-shoot Seventh Day Adventist fundamentalists and more than 250 federal 
officers have gone on for more than 96 hours. During the course of the siege, Cult leader David Koresh 
(legal name - Vernon Howell) has offered a number of &quot;biblical tirades&quot; on radio and television stations, 
before he was isolated from the media by federal law enforcement officials. At one point Koresh offered 
to surrender himself and all of the estimated seventy-five (75) other &quot;Davidian&quot; followers if he were 
allowed make a religious speech on a Dallas radio station. But, after making the speech, Koresh did not 
surrender. During the past several days, however, Koresh has released a total of twenty (20) children, 
women, and elderly adults. </p>
<p>Early reports said that Koresh had been wounded in the initial gunbattle that began the siege. A 
recording of Koresh's voice on his mother's answering machine said, &quot;Hello mama . . . it's your boy . . . 
they shot me and I'm dying . . . I'll see you in the skies.&quot; Police sources say that the wounds must not be 
major, or Koresh would not be able continue his negotiations or to direct the defense of the communal 
compound, which Koresh still reportedly has been doing. </p>
<p>Monday (Mar. 1st), the Federal Bureau of Investigation sent it's elite Hostage Rescue Team from 
Washington, DC, where it had been participating in the Investigation of the World Trade Center 
bombing. Because of the nature of the crimes associated with murdering a federal agent on Sunday, the 
FBI is said to have assumed over-all control of the investigation and negotiations at the compound. As 
many as two hundred and fifty (250) federal, state, and local law enforcement officers are said to have 
assumed defensive and &quot;over-watch&quot; positions surrounding the heavily-armed compound. </p>
<p>BATF and FBI sources have said that they intend to &quot;wait out&quot; Koresh and his followers, and that they 
don't anticipate a further assault on the compound unless circumstances change dramatically. One agent, 
who asked to remain anonymous, said that most of the negotiators were hopeful of being able to 
&quot;manipulate&quot; Koresh into surrendering, but that his irrational behavior and references to &quot;waiting for 
instructions from God&quot; are troublesome to some agents. He said that there is some fear that Koresh may 
commit mass murder or cause mass suicide if he is not totally convinced that the negotiations are being 
satisfactorily conducted. The seige goes on...</p>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 02-19-91-0300HRS.

<H3>GROUND WAR TO BEGIN SOON
</H3>
By Clark Staten
<BR>
Chicago, IL.  All preparations appear to be completed for the
Coalition assualt on Kuwait. Marines are standing by for
orders to assault the beaches in Kuwait and Iraq.  The XVIII
and VII Corps have moved to the pre-designated positions on
the Kuwaiti and Iraqi border.  Allied aircraft are being re-
armed for the attacks on ground targets that have been being
`softened-up' for the past few days.
<P>

Roland Dumas, the French Foreign Minister, has been quoted as
saying that "we are on the eve or pre-eve of the ground
offensive". An unnamed senior military official says the
"table is set".  Foreign Minister Aziz has travelled to
Moscow to confer with President Gorbachev, reportedly in an
attempt to persuade Saddam Hussein that withdrawal from
Kuwait will result in the accomplishment of "mutual goals",
in the region.
<P>

President Bush has received information concerning the
preparedness of the Coalition forces in the gulf, and has
commented that the war will end "very, very soon". After
reviewing a recently submitted Kremlin plan for Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait, a highly placed U.S. government
source is said to have commented, "there's nothing new to
consider in this proposal....the Iraqis have to leave Kuwait
in a short period of time, or suffer the consequences".
<P>

Allied air forces continue to bomb Hussein's elite
"Republican Guard" and reportedly destroy as many as two-
hundred tanks and personnel carriers on a daily basis.
According to Pentagon reports, the American air forces have
developed a new "night-fighting" technique whuich is said to
be particularly effective against Iraqi armor.  Chicago based
intelligence analysts have indicated that the new tactic
involves the use of long-range infared and image intensifying
technology.  Pentagon spokespersons have indicated that the
new techniques may have resulted in the destruction of as
many as 1,500 of the Iraqi "top-line" T-62 and T-72 battle
tanks. Reportedly, the only time that Iraqi forces can be
found to be moving is during nightime hours.
<P>

Reliable sources in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia have privately
suggested that they are prepared to attack at any time the
"Commander-in-Chief" might give the "Go-order".  Most
military strategists indicate that the Coalition forces are
now ready to launch "one of the most awesome demonstrations
of fire-power that has ever occured in the history of
battle".  Military experts indicate that Coalition forces
will not engage in the frontal assault that Hussein would
desire, but rather, they will utilize "fire and movement" to
"confuse, disorient, and destroy the enemy".
<P>

The concept of AirLand battle, as advocated by U.S. military
doctrine utilizes devastating `flanking', Airmobile, and
Airborne assaults against enemy areas of weakness.  Superior
Allied technology is expected to be pitted against the
prepared defenses of the Iraqi forces.  Few military analysts
expect the Coalition forces to get "bogged" down in the
multi-tiered static defenses of the Soviet trained Iraqi
troops.  Unlike the Iran/Iraqi conflict and it's massed
"human-wave assaults" against pre-registered artillery,
mines, and poison gases; Coalition forces can be expected to
bypass the strongest positions and attack Iraqi bunkers from
the flanks and rear.  Positions that can not be immediately
destroyed will be 'enveloped" and isolated until Iraqi troops
surrender or are destroyed by airpower or heavy munitions.
<P>
Special Operations forces (i.e. Green Berets, Navy SEALS, Air
Commandos, Rangers) are expected to have infiltrated rear
areas and will, with the help of Kuwaiti "resistance
fighters" destroy; command, control, communications, supply,
and petroleum centers. Necessary bridges and crossroads will
be controlled and secured for the use of coalition forces.
Key Iraqi military targets will be subjected to "sniping" and
non-conventional warfare techniques. Sophisticated
psychological tactics and techniques will be utilized against
the Iraqi soldiers morale.  Radio and radar jamming
techniques will be used against the remaining anti-aircraft
and artillery units in order to confuse effective response to
the attacks.
<P>
In the event that Iraq chooses to again disregard this last
opportunity to withdraw from Kuwait, it will soon undoubtedly
experiance the full power of the Coalition military forces.
In the words of President Bush, "We are going to stick with
it, we are going to prevail, and our troops will be home soon
with their heads held high".  While the timing of the start
of the "Mother of Battles" is uncertain, the ultimate outcome
is in little doubt.

<TITLE>Warning of Building Collapse Danger</TITLE>

<H3>Chicago Firm Warns of Structural Collapse Dangers</H3>
By Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor
<P>

Chicago, IL, January 11, 1996 (ENN) --Another significant snow
storm is blasting its way through the Midwest and is headed for
an already blizzard-striken Northeast.  With it comes the
possibility of another 6-12 inches of wet snow, and a distinct
potential for the collapse of any number of buildings in New
York, New Jersey, Washington, DC, or other affected areas,
according to Clark Staten of the Chicago-based Emergency
Response & Research Institute.
<P>

Staten, a retired fire department chief and recognized expert
in building collapse rescue, said that he is extremely concerned
that buildings with flat roofs, already stressed and weakened by
more than two feet of snow, may not be able to stand up to the
additional weight of another major snow storm. "We already
received reports of several building collapses in the New
York/NJ metropolitan area, during the original blizzard" Staten
said.
<P> 

"With any additional snow comes an additional danger of
catastrophic failure of already overburdened structures," he
continued. "We would strongly suggest immediate snow removal
from buildings with flat roofs, particularly those large older
buildings that might not be as strong as one might imagine",
Staten added. "Car dealerships, warehouses, theaters,
auditoriums, gymnasiums, and/or other buildings with large
expanses of roof surface may be most at risk in the coming
storm," Staten added.
<P>

According to weather watchers, snow can be a very heavy
substance and can increase in weight when its water to air
content increases. A cubic foot of snow can weigh from 3-10lbs. 
With two or more feet of snow already accumulated on roofs, one
can easily see that they are bearing a tremendous weight load.
That weight will continue to increase as additional snow falls;
this is particularly dangerous if the snow is of a dense, wet
variety or mixed with sleet.
<P>

In closing, Staten said that emergency service resources in the
Northeast are already overworked and understaffed and the threat
of additional building collapses could add to an already
difficult task. Home and business owners are urged to assist
firefighters and paramedics by removing as much snow as possible
prior to the onset of another possibly devastating storm.

<H3>ARREST MADE IN ONE TOKEN BOOTH TORCHING</H3>
By Jim Fay,  ENN NYC/ NJ  Metro Correspondent
<P>

Late reports from NYPD Transit Bureau Police that another Transit
token booth arson was attempted, injuring the booth clerk.  This
occurred at the  Union Ave.and Broadway station of the "G" train in
Brooklyn.
<P>

At approximately 2200 hrs., EST,  a male, with two accomplices,
poured a flammable liquid into the aperture of the token booth, but did
not ignited it.  The group escaped from the scene. The booth clerk was
removed to Woodhull Hospital by NYC*EMS, suffering from psychological
trauma from the incident.  It is unknown, at this late time, if the arrest 
were made at the immediate location, or somewhere distant from the subway
station.
<P>

This was the fourth torching, or attempted torching, of a NYC Transit token
booth in as many days, and the eighth in two weeks.  On Sunday,
December 10, Harry Kaufman, a 50-year-old booth clerk, died from his burns
that resulted from a torching and attempted robbery of the booth he was
working in on November 26. The suspects set the fire by pouring a flammable
liquid into the coin chute of the booth. no arrests have been made as of yet.
<P>

The booth fire was compared to a scene from a recent movie, "The Money
Train," which shows two robbers setting a similar fire.  On December 9,
at approximately 2100 hrs., EST, another booth fire was set in the
NYC Borough of Queens. In this incident, the fire was quickly extinguished,
and the booth clerk was not seriously injured, having escaped the booth
before the fire took hold of the booth.
<P>

In yet another booth attack, a clerk escaped injury again when an unidentified
assailant threw a lit match into a token booth at the Transit station at 4th
Avenue and Union Street in the Borough of Brooklyn. This attacked occurred
at 1500 hrs., EST, on Sunday afternoon of December 10.  NYPD Police
Officer Noreen Murray, of the Public Information Office, stated that  
"....a match was pushed through the aperture of the token booth...,"  and 
activated the Halon fire extinguishment system that is installed in almost 
all the token booths in the City.
<P>

However, Transit officials admit that this  Halon system is sometimes tampered
with by Transit employees, who disable the system in order to prevent it from
going off while the booth clerk is smoking in the booth. But Officer Murray 
was quick to point out that in the Brooklyn incident, the booth clerk, 
"...was not a smoker."
<P>

The movie, "The Money Train," depicts a similar robbery attempt, with the
suspect starting a fire through the coin aperture with the use of a flammable
liquid. It was reported that then-Chief of the Transit Police Michael 
O'Connor, upon reviewing the film's script, was totally against the making 
of a film within the NYC Transit System...that depicted such violence.  It was
O'Connor's contention that the Transit Police, before the recent merge into 
the NYPD, had been successful in reducing crime figures significantly, both 
under O'Connor's tenure and his predecessor, William Bratton, who is now the
Commissioner of the NYPD.
<P>

O'Connor let higher-ups in the New York City Transit Authority know about his
feelings, but was told by them that the movie was going to be made anyway,
regardless of his beliefs. When the NYC Transit and Housing Police
Departments merged into the NYPD, O'Connor retired.  Transit Officials nor the
Police have publicly announced any plans of increased security at the
booths.

<H3>San Antonio Man Kills Two, Three Wounded</H3>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>
A man killed two people and wounded three others before turning the
gun on himself in San Antonio, Texas, on Sunday.  Witnesses told
police that the gunman burst into a house at about 1830 CST looking 
for a 24-year-old woman who he claimed had given him AIDS.  When the 
man began firing at people inside of the house, some of the occupants 
escaped through windows and the back door.
<P>
The body of the gunman, who was armed with a .25-caliber semi-automatic 
pistol, was found in the front yard of the home.  He was identified as 
22-year-old Ulysses Miller.  The woman that he was looking for was 
no longer living at the house.
<P>
One witness, a neighbor, said, "He reloaded several times.  He first
went in and started firing, then came outside and reloaded.  Then he
went inside, fired again."
<P>
One of the wounded was a 42-year-old woman who threw her body on top 
of the children in the house.  She was reported to be in serious condition.
One 28-year-old male victim was reported to also be in fair condition and
the third wounded victim, a 44-year-old male, was said to be in good 
condition.

<H3>Recent Cincinnati Fire Reports</H3>

Unfortunately, ENN is presently unable to obtain immediate reports of fires/EMS runs in Cincinnati, Ohio. As much as we'd like to, we can't seem to get up-to-the-minute incident reports, as we have been able to get them from other departments.  But, your editor thought that it would be interesting to see what the Cincinnati Fire Department has been up to lately.
<P>

On Sunday, December 10th, at 1443 EST, Cincinnati firefighters fought a
2 Alarm fire at 1713 Fairfax Avenue.  Fire was in a 4-flat building.
Firefighters rescued three people from the burning building.
<P>

On Monday, December 11th, at 2119 EST, Cincinnati had a 3 Alarm fire
at 7218 Scottwood Avenue.  First arriving firefighters reported heavy
fire from the basement and first floor of a 2-story brick vacant dwelling.
Fire quickly extended throughout the building.  Command reported an
exposure problem and an exterior attack was conducted.  It took 60
firefighters about three-and-a-half hours in frigid temperatures to
battle this blaze.
<P>

Cincinnati firefighters battled a 2 alarm fire at 2255 EST, on Friday,
December 15th, at 259 West McMicken.  Fire was reported in a 3-story
brick apartment building.  Firefighters had some trouble finding the
seat of the fire in the building.  It was finally found in a large
crawlspace located between the second and third floors.  A lot of
truck work was required to knock the fire down.
<P>

At 0132 EST, on Sunday, December 17th, Cincinnati had a 2 Alarm fire
at 1270 IIiff Avenue.  When first arriving fires companies came upon
the scene, they reported heavy fire on the first floor of a 3-story
dwelling.  The fire extended throughout the structure.  It took 36
firefighters with four engines, three ladders, a heavy rescue, a
paramedic rescue unit, a District Chief and an Assistant Chief about
two-and-a-half hours to bring this blaze under the control.

<TITLE>The Strategic Reality of the Conflict</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 02-22-91  0200 HRS. CST
<BR>
<H3>THE OBJECTIVITY OF REALITY REGARDING THE WAR</H3>
<BR>
Chicago,IL. A Soviet and Iraqi peace proposal will decide the
probability of a ground war.  Foreign Minister Aziz of
Iraq, while in Moscow, indicated that Saddam Hussein will
accept a possible cease-fire and move out of Kuwait. Earlier
in the day, Hussein called for an expansion of the war and
said that his forces " will prevail and destroy the infidels
of the United States and her Allies".  Hussein further
indicated that his forces will win and that " the mother of
all battles will be our battle of victory and martyrdom".
Husssein denounced Saudi Arabia, Egyprt, and Syria as
"traitors" against the Islamic cause.
<P>

A "peace initiative" was proposed by the Soviet Union that
would allow the Iraqi forces to eventually "withdraw" from
the theatre and accept a Soviet plan for the resolution for
the Persian Gulf Conflict.  It is an eight point plan which
contains language which would allow the "unconditional
withdrawal" of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and subsequent
agreements regarding the resolution of the conflict.
Unfortunately, the plan gives various allowances to the Iraqi
forces in regard to future "cease-fires" that might occur.
<P>

U.S. military veterans would suggest that "cease-fires" are
frequently used to re-supply and re-orient battlefield
troops, while providing them with updated intelligence and
logistical capabilities during the period of "no-fire". Viet-
Nam veterans are sincerely aware of the use of "cease-fires"
arrangements that occured during the conflict.  All too
frequently, following a "cease-fire", the NVA (North
Vietnamese Army) choose to infiltrate new areas and re-supply
`beleaguered' units during the "naive" effort at
reconciliation.
<P>

If they were aware, and all frequently, the "well-meaning"
advocates of peace would then find that a "communist"
offensive would follow the "period of peace" and "liberation
of new areas" would soon occur.  To suggest otherwise, would
be to disregard history. The records speak for themselves.
On the other hand, a far more realistic and effective
analysis would suggest that the time to attack is when an
enemy "asks for a cease-fire"...it usually means that the
combatants desire a respite from the damaging effects of a
superior force.
<P>

According to Clark Staten of the Emergency Response and
Research Institute in Chicago, Ill., "the time to press an
attack is when your enemy will suffer the greatest indignity
and and loss of life... due to a lack of will".  "To do
otherwise, is to disregard the advantage of the psychological
and military advantage that has been gained through the shock
effect of insistent bombing and harrasment of the enemy
troops.", Staten said.  "Should the U.S officials allow a
cease-fire and partial withdrawal of Iraqi forces, we will
undoubtedly be faced with the inevitable resurgence of Iraq",
Staten continued.  " To do so, would suggest that we will
again, eventually, face the tyranny of Saddam Hussein",
the anti-terrorist expert predicted.
<P>

"It is likely that, if the Soviet initative is accepted,
that the Iraqi forces will remain intact and that Mr.
Hussein's will judge the Coalition as weak.....to negotiate
an incomplete peace at this point is counter-productive and
disgraceful to those who have given their lives for the
effort in the Persian Gulf", Staten said.  " A far more
productive proposal would involve the complete dismantlement
of the Iraqi military and little, if any, Soviet involvement
in the eventual resolution in the conflict", he continued.
"To suggest otherwise, is to allow for an eventual resurgence
of `revolutionary forces' in the region", Staten continued.
<P>

"I would merely suggest that Mr. Hussein can not be trusted
and that his reason for resolution, at his point, involves
his actual capitulation to the superior forces of the
coalition", Staten said.  "Were he to be given a real
opportunity to damage the United States or Coalition nations
....now... or in the future, I feel sure that he would avail
himself and his people the opportunity for revenge", Staten
concluded.
<P>

A far more rational approach would appear to be that the
Coalition forces insure that Iraq and Mr. Saddam Hussein
would be debilitated or unable to further threaten the
international community.  To do so, will undoubtably involve
a massive ground war that has been anticipated.  It would
appear necessary to insure world peace, that Mr. Hussein and
his "renegade nation" be subjected to the ultimate forces of
the Coalition nations.

<TITLE>Bosnia Update; Landmine Dangers</TITLE>

<B>Special Bosnia Report...</B>
<center><H2>Two US Soldiers Wounded by Landmine</H2></center>
<BR>
<center><IMG SRC="/landmine.gif"></center>
<P>
On Thursday in northern Bosnia, two American soldiers were wounded
when a land mine exploded.  One of the soldiers suffered injuries
to his right foot and other was able to walk away from the blast
with shrapnel wounds to his lower leg.  The incident happened at
about 2:30 p.m. (0930 EST) in the town of Hadizici, which is
located about ten miles southeast of Tuzla.
<P>

NATO issued a statement about the incident.  The statement said,
"Two American engineers were injured by an anti-personnel mine as
they were conducting a joint inspection of a minefield with the
Bosnian Serb Army.  One soldier stepped on an anti-personnel mine,
incurring injuries to one foot."
<P>
Concerns have been raised by ERRI and any number of other sources in regard to the dangers of landmines and other improvised explosive devices in Bosnia.  According to UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund), Bosnia has one of the highest densities of landmines per square mile of anyplace in the world.  UNICEF says that more than 1,800,000 mines may have been laid in Bosnia during the recent years of ethnic conflict.  More troublesome to NATO troops than traditional mines, which are made metal (and pictured above), are mines with plastic cases or improvised mines made from wooden cases and high explosives.  The wood and plastic mines are far more difficult to detect with conventional mine detectors.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>Sniping Threat</H3>
In other news regarding the Bosnian peace mission, United States
Navy Admiral Leighton Smith made some remarks regarding the six
confirmed sniper incidents involving NATO forces since Sunday.
Admiral Smith said, "We've got some jerk up there pulling a trigger
and he's got a nightscope.  That makes it tough.  But boy, let me
tell you, if we do see him he had better be fast and be clad in
bullet-proof stuff.  Because we will attack without warning.  There
are such things as anti-sniping teams ... people who snipe at our
forces are at great risk to themselves.  If we see somebody pointing
a weapon at our forces he will be attacked without warning ... no
warning shots, no 'drop your weapon."
<P>

And true to Admiral Smith's words -- French NATO forces later
killed a sniper in the suburb where most of the shooting incidents
have occurred.  A NATO statement said, "One gunman was located by
the French Special Forces and was later neutralized.  This person
was seriously wounded.  He later died of his injuries in spite of
the intervention from a military physician.  Another armed civilian
was also apprehended by our forces.  This individual was disarmed
without any bloodshed."

<title>2nd Cruise Missile Strikes in Iraq</title>

<p><font size=5><strong>THE UNITED STATES ATTACKS IRAQ</strong></font> ...<br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
The United States unleashed 27 cruise missiles at military targets in southern Iraq on Tuesday morning in response to 
Saddam Hussein's attack on Kurds in northern Iraq over the weekend. Two U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers and two U.S. 
Navy ships in the Persian Gulf launched the missiles during the military operation.<br>
<br>
One unnamed senior military officer at the Pentagon said that any further attacks on Iraq would depend upon damage 
assessments and whether Iraq would withdraw his forces away from the Kurdish strongholds, located north of the 36th 
parallel. The military officer said, &quot;The whole idea is to teach him that aggression doesn't pay, that there will be a cost and 
he will lose real military assets if he continues to violate international norms.&quot; Another Pentagon official said that today's 
operation appeared to be the only attack to be mounted for the time being. The U.S. on Tuesday also said that it is 
extending the &quot;no-fly&quot; zone in southern Iraq, from the 32nd parallel to the 33rd parallel, which includes the southern 
suburbs of Baghdad.<br>
<br>
Targets that were struck today by the U.S. were surface-to-air missile sites, radar installations and command-and-control 
installations. Some military analysts believe that these sites were picked in anticipation for a larger strike should Iraq not 
heed the warnings of the U.S. and pull away from the Kurdish areas. The British government in London on Tuesday, 
quickly said after the attack that it &quot;fully supports the unequivocal message to Saddam Hussein that repression of innocent 
civilians and reckless acts of brutality are unacceptable.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Pentagon announced the attack about 30 minutes after it had been launched, at 9:25 a.m. Baghdad time. In a 
statement, the Pentagon simply said, &quot;At the direction of the President, the Department of Defense has launched cruise 
missiles to attack selected air defense targets in Iraq.&quot; Hardly 15 minutes after that statement was issued, the Pentagon 
announced that the attack was over.<br>
<br>
In many cases, it takes several hours or even days to receive a full assessment on the damage caused by air attacks. In 
their assessment, the U.S. will use spy planes and reconnaissance satellites.<br>
<br>
The B-52s that took part in the raid had been sent to the Pacific island of Guam over the weekend. AGM-86C 
air-launched cruise missiles were used by the Air Force in the attack. Other cruise missiles were believed fired from two 
Navy ships located in the Persian Gulf -- the destroyer USS Laboon (DDG-58, Arleigh Burke Class) and the cruiser USS 
Shiloh (CG-67, Ticonderoga Class).<br>
<br>
It is uncertain if Saddam Hussein will heed the warnings of the U.S. It has been reported that the Iraqis were shelling the 
town of Sham Shamal and it looked as though an attack on the town was in preparation. Iraqi troops also appeared to be 
moving toward the town of Sulaymaniyah. Saddam Hussein remained defiant in the face of the U.S. attack. After the raid, 
he ordered his military to ignore the &quot;no-fly zones,&quot; calling them &quot;null and void.&quot; He also ordered that any foreign planes 
flying over Iraq be shot down.<br>
<br>
The Iraqi military reported that the cruise missiles struck &quot;population centers&quot; and killed five people and wounded 19 
others. Saddam, himself, reported that Iraqi air defenses had managed to shoot down most of the cruise missiles and that 
his country's losses were &quot;minimal.&quot;<br>
<br>
In a televised speech, Iraq's brutal and paranoid dictator said, &quot;From now on, pay no attention to damned imaginary no-fly 
zones above the 36th parallel and below the 32nd parallel. Depend only on Allah and hit hard and professionally at any 
flying target that belongs to the allied aggressors that penetrates the airspace of your beloved and glorious homeland. Fight, 
resist these aggressors and teach them a new unforgettable lesson.&quot;<br>
<br>
International reaction to the U.S. attack was mixed. Russia condemned the bombing and said that it could send events in 
the region spiraling &quot;out of control.&quot; These words are typical of Russian Foreign Minister Primakov, who fancies himself as 
a Middle East expert and who has always supported, for whatever reason, Saddam Hussein. China urged both sides to 
show restraint. Britain, as mentioned supported the action fully. Reaction from France was surprisingly cautious and 
unenthusiastic. Germany and Japan were also cautious in their reactions.<br>
<br>
Experts were mixed in their analysis of what may happen next. Some say that Saddam will once again &quot;blink&quot; and heed the 
warning to pull back to avoid further U.S. attacks. Others were unsure. William Quandt, a Middle East expert at the 
University of Virginia, said on Monday about Saddam, &quot;It's a gamble, but this guy is a gambler. He's constantly testing to 
see what kind of response he's going to get from the powers he's under. He's constantly looking for chinks in the armor.&quot;<br>
<br>
Edward Djerejian, the director of the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Texas, said, 
&quot;What do you expect? He's just lost a terrible war, but he says to his people, 'The battle goes on. You've got to stick by 
me.'&quot; Richard Haas, the director of foreign policy at the Washington- based Brookings Institute, said if Saddam didn't fight 
back, his regime would fall apart. Haas said, &quot;If he were to change he would be not only out of power, he would be dead. 
He rules by fear and force.&quot;<br>
<br>
What will happen next is anyone's guess. But the answer should come soon as we wait and see if the Iraqi military decides 
to pull back. ENN is monitoring the situation very closely.</p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>ENN Instant Update:</strong></font><br>
09/03/96 - 22:30CDT</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=4><strong>US Launches 2nd Cruise Missile Attack in Iraq</strong></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3>(ENN) Following bomb damage assessments (BDA), U.S. forces have again reportedly sent cruise missiles into command 
and control nets and missile sites in S. Iraq. One report suggests that an additional 17 cruise missiles have been launched 
today. It is likely that this follow-on strike package is designed to again strike targets that might not have been destroyed 
by the first wave of U.S. weapons.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in N. Iraq, there are some indications that a portion of Saddam Hussein's forces have consolidated in an area 
approximately 15 miles from Irbil. There are few, if any, reports of any withdrawal by Iraqi forces to normal bases and 
places of deployment. Some reports continue to filter in that Iraqi intelligence agents are continually conducting 
&quot;assassinations&quot; and &quot;purges of personnel unfriendly to Iraq&quot; and the Kurdish factions friendly to them.<br>
<br>
Saddam Hussein, for his part, has again threatened American pilots with death, should they try to enforce a new &quot;no-fly&quot; 
zone designated by President Clinton, in a more central part of Iraq. Even in the face of the cruise missile attacks, Hussein 
still sounds belligerent and unbowed by the military latest developments.<br>
<br>
Concerns are also being raised in counter-terrorist circles that the latest activity in Iraq may provoke a terrorist response 
against the United States...in the Mid-East or elsewhere.<br>

<H3>Pervomaiskoye Assault; hostage deaths likely</H3>
BY: Clark Staten, ERRI Analyst
<P>

Chicago, IL, January 15 --The firing began at about 06:00 (GMT).
Russian forces were seen firing rocket-propelled grenades,
artillery, and mortars at rebel-held positions. Hind and Hip
helicopters were circling the village and began firing their
machine-guns at targets of opportunity.  Black-suited figures,
alleged to be Spetsnatz special forces commandos, were seen
gathered in a nearby field, awaiting the order to assault the
village. Smoke and fire began to fill the air. The Russian
leadership in Moscow had obviously finally decided to send a
very clear and deadly message to Chechen rebels. 
<P>

By 07:00, Russian security officials said that they had ordered
a military assault of the village, because "radio traffic" had
been intercepted that indicated that the rebels were "executing
hostages". Although these reports were unconfirmed by any
independent source, and reportedly denied by Chechen rebels, the
health and the safety of the hostages was very much in question.
<P>
 
Counter-terrorist and military analysts, following the progress
of the operation, said that because of the methods being
employed that it appeared unlikely that this was a "surgical
hostage rescue operation", and that the Russian military forces
fully intend to inflict major casualties upon the Chechens. A
former federal counter-terrorist operative and analyst told ENN
that it was reasonable to assume that the use of mortars,
rockets, and artillery indicated that the "right-wing/hardline"
of Moscow leadership was influencing on-scene negotiations and
that a decision had been made to "terminate the Lone Wolf
rebels", regardless of the fate of the hostages. 
<P>     

Russian presidential candidate Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, in an
interview on Russian television today, said that the entire
hostage drama was a product of "Western intervention" and a
desire by Western powers to provoke a continuing crisis within
"Mother Russia." Zhirinovskiy and other nationalists, in recent
months, have blamed Russian President Yelsin and the "democracy
movement" for many of Russia's continuing economic, political,
and military woes.  Recent congressional elections in Russia
showed a shift back to nationalist and former communist
candidates, who are expected to attempt to block further efforts
by the "reform movement", lead by Yelsin and supported by
President Clinton and the West.
<P>

By late afternoon, Russian forces had claimed the deaths of
sixty (60) Chechen rebels and admitted that at least four (4)
Russian soldiers had been killed. According to a Russian
state-security official, nine (9) hostages had been rescued by
Spetsnatz troops. The entire Southern part of the village was
reportedly in flames and gunfire and explosions continued to be
heard from several quarters. No confirmed reports were available
as to the plight of other hostages or as to the actual control
of the besieged village.
<P>  

At dusk, the fate of the village of Pervomaiskoye remains in
doubt.  The destiny of innocent hostages and villagers, caught
between the vindictive Russian military and the rebellious and
autonomy-seeking Chechens, hangs in the balance.  Experts say
that only one thing is certain; that this will not be the last
crisis of freedom in the former Soviet Union.

<H3>Caution Urged During Heat Wave</H3>
<P>
Chicago, IL, July 13,1995 -- With the temperatures and humidity
at dangerous levels, the air quality diminishing, and no end in 
sight in some parts of the country, the Emergency Response & 
Research Institute (ERRI) is urging extreme caution for persons with
cardiac and respiratory problems.  According to Clark Staten,
director of the Chicago-based emergency service think-tank, the
recent heat wave has already resulted in the untimely deaths of
several people in the Midwest and Southwestern part of the United 
States and more heat injuries or even deaths can be expected.
<P>
"The conditions are ideal for heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and
even heat stroke", the veteran (retired) paramedic said in an interview
today.  "This is the kind of weather that is dangerous to the
elderly, children, and those that have diseases that prevent
them from regulating heat well", he continued.  "People with
cardiac, respiratory, diabetic, asthmatic, and seizure problems
should be warned to use extreme caution when exposed to this
type of hot weather...it can aggravate their condition and even
result in death", Staten added.  "We would suggest that people
with these conditions remain indoors in the air conditioning or
even (if necessary) move to 'cooling centers' that have been 
established by many municipalities", he continued.  "Even those 
that don't have a pre-existing medical condition can easily be 
affected by this type of heat and high humidity...they should 
take some simple precautions to prevent the onset of heat injuries", 
Staten concluded.
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
According to ERRI, during the heat wave, people should:
<P>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>(1) Wear light colored clothing that will reflect the heat
<LI>(2) Drink plenty of water or special electrolyte replacing
fluids like "Gatorade", "Sports Drink" or other
commercial products
<LI>(3) Avoid alcoholic and caffeinated beverages, which tend to    
dehydrate you...rather than rehydrate you...which is
needed.
<LI>(4) If possible, avoid strenuous physical activity while        
outdoors...as this causes sweating and hastens fluid

Staten also listed some of the signs and symptoms, of heat
injuries, that can strike people during a heat wave. In order of
seriousness, they include:
<P>
<P>
<HR>

<P><U>Heat Cramps</U> - Muscle pains caused by a build-up of acid         
compounds and an excessive loss of fluids in
large muscles 
<P>
Signs & Symptoms - Cramps in legs or stomach area
<P>


TREATMENT:
<BR> # Remove the patient to a cooler environment
<P>

	   
	    # Rest the cramping muscles, sit or lie down
<P>

	   
	   # Replace fluids by mouth, use cool water or
	     commercial electrolyte solutions
<P>

	   
	   # If the cramps do not subside, the patient should be
	   taken to medical care
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<U>Heat Exhaustion</U> - Often called heat prostration or heat
collapse, is a serious heat illness. It
occurs when the body loses large amounts
of water and electrolytes
<P>


Signs & Symptoms - Cool, clammy(sweaty)skin, dizziness,feeling  
faint, nausea, vomiting, rapid pulse,
feels weak or "bad"
<P>

TREATMENT: 
<BR>
	   # Move the patient to a cooler environment
<P>

	   
	   # Loosen tight or restrictive clothing or remove

	     excessive layers of clothing
<P>

	   
	   # If the patient is conscious, give up to a liter of 
	   cool water or commercial electrolyte replacing
	   fluids. Do not give fluids by mouth to a
	   patient who can't hold the cup themselves.
	   Never force fluids on a patient who is not
	   alert, they could choke and aspirate the
	   fluids.
<P>

	   
	   # In most cases, the patient ill recover on his/her  
	   own after fluid replacement and exposure to
	   cooler temperatures. If not, or if a
	   diminishing of his/her level of
	   consciousness occurs, 911 must be called and
	   EMT/Paramedics will start an intravenous line
	   (I.V.) and replace fluids internally.
<P> 

	   
	   # Unconsciousness, or a decreasing level thereof is  
	   reason enough to call 911.  Always err on the
	   side of safety and care for the patient in
	   question.
<P>

<U>Heat Stroke</U> - Heat stroke is a true medical emergency! It occurs
	      when a patient that has suffered heat
	      exhaustion does not receive treatment and
	      is continually exposed to additional
	      heat. Typical examples of heat stroke
	      victims include elderly people who live in
	      buildings without fans or air conditioning                      
	      during heat waves, and children that are left in              
	      locked cars on a hot days.  Humidity seems to            
	      contribute to the likelihood of both heat           
	      exhaustion and heat stroke.
<P>


Signs & Symptoms: Hot & dry skin, lack of perspiration,
		  excessive body temperature, lessening
		  consciousness or total unconsciousness,
		  strong rapid pulse diminishing and weaker as
		  becomes unresponsive, imminent death if left untreated
<P>


TREATMENT:
<BR> 
	   # Call 911; request Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
<P> 

	   
	   # Immediately and rapidly move the patient to a
	   cooler environment; preferably air conditioning
<P>

	   
	   # Remove the patient's clothing and cover him/her
	     with a sheet or towel soaked in cool water
<P>

	   
	   # If EMT/Paramedic services are delayed or not       
	     immediately available, ice packs can be
	     applied to the patient's abdomen, armpits,
	     and behind the neck
<P>

	   
	   # The patient will need intravenous (I.V.) fluids and
	     extensive cooling measures to ensure survival.
	     Hospital treatment will include reducing
	     the body temperature by whatever means are
	     necessary.
<P>

Staten concluded by urging everyone to check on elderly
neighbors and watch the activity of children during the
remainder of this heat wave.  He added that by being educated
citizens will be better prepared to prevent heat injuries and
care for family and friends that have suffered it's ill effects.

<H5>Media Ignored Warnings Too....</H5>

Chicago, IL, July 18, 1995 --Chicago's heat disaster was predicted by
one of the nations's lesser known news assets, and that report also
offered ways to help mitigate the problems as they were
occurring.  According to ENN Managing Editor, Steve Macko, the
Chicago-based Emergency Response & Research Institute (ERRI)
sent the following warning to numerous local and national media
outlets on Thursday, July 13, 1995, at 2:30 p.m.:
<P>

Chicago, IL, July 13,1995 -- With the temperatures and humidity
at dangerous levels, the air quality diminishing, and no end in 
sight in some parts of the country, the Emergency Response & 
Research Institute (ERRI) is urging extreme caution for persons 
with cardiac and respiratory problems.  According to Clark 
Staten, director of the Chicago-based emergency
service think-tank, the recent heat wave has already resulted in the          untimely deaths of several people in the Midwest and Southwestern 
part of the United States and more heat injuries or even deaths 
can be expected.
<P>

"The conditions are ideal for heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and
even heat stroke", the veteran (retired) paramedic said in an   
interview today.  "This is the kind of weather that is
dangerous to the elderly, children, and those that have
diseases that prevent them from regulating heat well",
he continued.  "People with cardiac, respiratory,
diabetic, asthmatic, and seizure problems should be
warned to use extreme caution when exposed to this type of
hot weather...it can aggravate their condition and even
result in death", Staten added. "We would suggest that   
people with these conditions remain indoors in the air          
conditioning or even (if necessary) move to 'cooling
centers' that have been established by many municipalities", 
he continued. "Even those that don't have a pre-existing 
medical condition can easily be affected by this type of 
heat and high humidity...they should take some
simple precautions to prevent the onset of heat injuries",
Staten concluded.
(end excerpt)
<P>

According to Macko, the article went on to outline a variety of
recognition factors, precautions and prevention methods, as well
as to offer basic treatment methods. Macko said that the full
text of the warning was distributed by fax to several Chicago
newspapers, news radio stations, TV stations, and distributed to
other national media outlets and a number of emergency agencies,
by means of the Internet.
<P>  

Macko said that he was surprised that the ERRI warnings received
very little attention from the national press, and that ERRI
didn't receive any inquiries about the heat emergency, or the
Institute's recommendations, until late Saturday. By then, he
said that the heat emergency had turned into a "full blown
disaster".
<P> 

Macko continued by saying that ERRI had been following the
progress of the weather system, that caused the temperature to
soar to over 100 degrees for several days, and had received
reports of heat related injuries and deaths to both people and
livestock, in Oklahoma, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, and other
Western states. These deaths prompted ERRI to interview several
experts, who had treated hundreds of heat-related injuries in
the past. The resulting interview, with ERRI's executive
director, was then released at the start of the "heat wave" in
Chicago.
<P>  

Macko concluded by saying that the Emergency Response & Research
Institute studies a variety of disaster and emergency service
issues, and provides both analysis, commentary, and consulting
services to both the media and a number of emergency service
leaders.  Macko said that members of the press, government
officials, and emergency service managers are invited to contact
ERRI.

<H5>Senior Paramedic Resigns Because of Heat Wave</H5>
<P>
Chicago, IL, July 18, 1995 --The City of Chicago's most senior
African-American Paramedic reportedly resigned his appointed
rank today, as the result of the fire department's management of
the recent Chicago heat wave, that has claimed as many as 400
lives.  Sources close to the fire department say that Deputy
Chief Paramedic Robert Scates, a 25 year veteran, and one of the
city's first black paramedics, has reportedly submitted a
request to be demoted to his career service rank and relinquish
supervision of all paramedics on Chicago's Southside.  Scates
will then, reportedly, assume "other duties" within the Bureau
of Emergency Medical Services.
<P>

Scates is, reportedly, said to be angry over "differences in
management styles" between he and other members of the senior
management of the fire department.  Primarily, he is allegedly
"upset" at a lack of planning and sufficient resources to meet
the needs of both citizens and paramedics during the devastating
heat-wave that killed hundreds of senior citizens in Chicago. As
Deputy Chief Paramedic, Scates was responsible for all emergency
medical care needs of Chicagoans living South of 22nd street.
<P>  

In a related story, another Chicago Paramedic, Robert Raica, who
is also a Illinois State Senator, has called for public hearings
in regard to the Chicago heat emergency. Sen. Raica is quoted as
saying that he has some "serious questions" about the management
of the heat-wave and what sort of plans and resources should be
made available for future disasters.  Dates have not been
announced for an examination of these issues, but Sen. Raica
said that he expected that information to be available soon.
<P>

Chicago Mayor Richard Daley has said that he will soon establish
a "blue ribbon commission" of experts to examine all of the
issues surrounding what is being called a "disaster of
unprecedented proportions".  Daley said that he and his staff
will do "everything in their power" to prevent another
occurrence of this type and magnitude. Daley and his staff have
been receiving criticism from the Chicago Firefighter's Union
and several senior citizen's organizations, for the city's
response to the heat emergency.
<P>

Cook County Medical Examiner Edmund Donoghue said that as of
5:00p.m. today that the death toll in Cook county has risen to
376, and that he expects it to continue to rise, to more than
400, as his investigators and pathologists complete their
backlog of cases. Donoghue said that the examiner's office may
have as many as 110 more bodies to examine and determine a cause
of death.
<P> 

Ambulances, hearses, and police patrol wagons are still
reportedly "backed up", at this hour, for more than a block, in
an area near the Medical Examiner's Office, and some police
officers there said that they fear that they will find
additional deteriorating bodies in closed apartments and homes
in the Chicago area.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<HR>  
(Ed. Note: Subsequent to this final report, it was determined that
 in excess of 750 people had died as the result of the heat wave
 that is described above. City and State hearings were conducted
 and the City of Chicago developed a "Heat Warning System" in 
 an attempt to prevent a future accurance similar to that described)

<TITLE>Twin Train Disasters; KY and Mexico</TITLE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE * EMERGENCYNET NEWS * 11-19-91 2300 CST
<P>
<H2>TRAIN WRECKS CAUSE DISASTERS IN KENTUCKY & MEXICO</H2>

Chicago,IL. (ENN) Two separate train crashes have resulted in
major disasters in Shepardsville, KY and Tehuacan, Mexico.
<P>

The first of these events events took place at approximately
12:40 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon in an area 150 miles
Southeast of Mexico City.  Reportedly, the train jumped the
track on a curve and slid onto the Veracruz-Mexico highway.
The resulting multiple collisions with twenty (20) cars and
trucks caused as many as seventy (70) deaths and more than
forty (40) injuried.  The Mexican Federal Highway Police
report that many people were entraped within vehicles and the
train and that the death toll may rise. Mexican officials
hypothesized that the train may have sufferred a brake
failure which prevented it from slowing for a sharp curve,
when the accident occured. Details were slow in being
reported due to the remoteness of the area and the fact the
rescue was still underway at the time of this report.
<P>

Shortly after the Mexican derailment (at approximately 1300
CST), a second train accident involved an eighty-nine (89)
car frieght train carrying hazardous materials and explosives
took place in a small town twenty (20) miles south of
Louisville, KY.  The train, in the Kentucky crash, hurtled
off a bridge outside of Shepardsville, Ky. and tumbled into
the Salt River.  More than 1,000 people from Shepardsville
and the surrounding area were immediately evacuated to a Red
Cross shelter at a nearby county fairgrounds.
<P>

Several train cars were set on fire by the collision and
continued to burn until the time of this report.  Reportedly,
a car containing Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate was being
encrouched by another burning car.  The Diisocyanate is both
extremely poisonous and flammable. It is similar in chemical
make-up to the Diisocyante that was released in Bhopal,
India.  Also reportedly involved in the incident was another
tank car containing Propylene Oxide that remained on the
bridge over the continuing fire.  Another car that contained
military cluster bombs was involved in the wreck, but did not
explode and was not close to the actual site of the fire nor
the cars that went into the water.
<P>

Fire and disaster officials, on the scene, have declined to
send firefighters into the immediate area to fight the fire.
State Fire Marshall Rodney Raby said that he and other fire
officials had a concern, that, "if we put personnel down
there (near the fire)...that we have no assurances that we'd
get them out".  State Disaster Agency Chief Charlie Frazee
reportedly said, "Our foremost concern is the fact that we
have an insulated tankcar down there that has been subjected
to flames for some period of time".  At least one local
emergency medical service official said that there was a fear
of toxic substances being released near the derailment.
<P>

Clark Staten, Executive Director of the Emergency Response
and Research Institute in Chicago,IL  hypothesized that the
Kentucky officials feared a possible "BLEVE" (Boiling Liquid
Expanding Vapor Explosive) of a potentially toxic chemical
car.  He said, "a BLEVE of a flammable liquid that is also
poisonous is a disastrous event, but it can also may be a
`Godsend'...if the fire consumes the toxic material in it's
entirety by the high temperatures and flash of the
explosion".  "Many toxic materials can be effectively
disposed of by burning, if the fire is hot enough... the
problem is compounded, however, when the materials are not
completely consumed and the potentially deadly, partially
destroyed, by-products of combustion are released into the
air" he concluded.
<P>

Local police officials are said to be conducting an
investigation into the cause of the derailment.  A witness
said that a local garbage truck had struck the bridge, that
was involved in the derailment, just prior to the accident
and that it might have caused the wreck.  Kentucky State
Police are said to be interviewing witnesses and studying the
crash site, but that the investigation will be delayed until
the danger of fire and explosion passes. No injuries were
reported by the local emergency medical service agency.
Kentucky Governor Wallace Wilkenson reportedly visited the
scene late Tuesday and declared the site a state disaster
area.

<title>Hints of Possible Plans to Capture Serb Karadzic</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<br>
<font size=5><strong>British Allies Criticize Plan to Capture Karadzic</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
LONDON (ENN) - A British newspaper on Sunday said that the U.S. has made plans to grab Bosnian Serb 
leader Radovan Karadzic in a high-risk commando raid. The British government, on the other hand, believes 
that such a move at this time could prove to be counter-productive.<br>
<br>
Citing intelligence sources in both the United States and in Great Britain, the Sunday Times said that the U.S. is 
planning upon seizing Karadzic in a daring airborne raid in the mountain resort of Pale, where Karadzic is 
believed to be staying. In its report, the Times said that it believes that U.S. &quot;intelligence assets,&quot; which include 
undercover agents and operatives and equipment that are already in place for the mission.<br>
<br>
If asked, the British government will not allow the use of its elite Special Air Service Regiment. The newspaper 
said, &quot;The British government fears that any effort to seize Karadzic could lead to reprisals against NATO 
troops in Bosnia and risks re-igniting the war.&quot; Karadzic and Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic 
have been indicted by the United Nations war crimes tribunal in the Hague for being responsible for the mass 
murders of thousands of people.<br>
<br>
The U.S. State Department is asked usually on a daily basis if there are any plans for NATO forces to arrest 
the two wanted men. The answer has always been no. If true, a capture attempt on Karadzic would be change 
in U.S. policy. A few weeks ago, Karadzic was forced to resign his official position and was exiled to staying 
out of and influencing the upcoming elections that are to take place in September. But it appears, now, the U.S. 
fears that Karaczic cannot be trusted.<br>
<br>
The Sunday Times said, &quot;Britain and other NATO allies believe that any raid will produce high casualties among 
Karadzic's fiercely loyal 2,000-strong bodyguard and reprisals against NATO's 60,000 troops sent to Bosnia 
to implement the Dayton peace pact. Britain, which has 13,000 troops in Bosnia, fears further that capturing 
Karadzic risks derailing the Bosnian elections, considered the cornerstone of the peace agreement.&quot;<br>
<br>
Speculation centers on a plan that would probably be carried out by elite U.S. Delta Force operatives, who would rapidly arrive in a strike 
group of helicopter gunships. A possible plan would then involve operatives who would then slide down ropes, overcome any resistance by guards, 
and carry off Karadzic into custody.  Eventually, Karadzic would be turned over to the International Court in the Hague for prosecution on charges of war crimes.<br>
<br>
In a report that was reportedly compiled by Great Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee, it was said that there 
was not enough &quot;hard intelligence&quot; currently available to pinpoint Karadzic's exact position, to allow American 
troops to launch a successful strike.<br>
<br>
ENN will be closely monitoring this situation and provide updates as the information becomes available.</p>

<H3>Terrorism Widens as Fighting Continues in Russian Village</H3>
By: Clark Staten, ERRI Analyst
<P>
Chicago, IL, January 16, 1996-- Unrest appears to be spreading
throughout Chechnya and surrounding regions of Russia as a
second day of fierce hand-to-hand fighting continues in the
village of Pervomaiskeyo. Unconfirmed reports of the hijacking
of a Russian-bound ferry at the Turkish port of Trabzon have
been received in past hour.  According to the semi-official
Turkish Anatolia news agency, as many as twenty (20) masked
Chechen gunmen have seized a ocean-going ferry and its Russian
crew and have threatened to kill all of the Russians on board
unless they are allowed to put to sea.
<P>  

According Turkish police sources, several gunmen, armed with
AK-47 assault rifles and pistols took over the vessel at
approximately 9:45p.m.(local time). An eyewitness, a woman who
reportedly escaped from the ship, said that several passengers
and crew had been wounded during the assault on the ship. 
Forty-five (45) crewmen and one-hundred and twenty (120)
passengers are believed on-board at the time of the take-over.
Turkish officials say that the ship, reportedly named the
Avrasya, was originally destined for Sochi in Southern Russia,
but that they are now uncertain of its current destination. 
<P>

In the Chechen capitol of Grozny, the ITAR-Tass news agency is
reporting that earlier today an additional thirty (30) hostages
have also been taken from an electric generating plant by forces
suspected of supporting the besieged Chechen rebels in
Pervomaiskoye. Conflicting reports have been issued by differing
government sources as to the facts of the hostage-taking in
Grozny, but it is believed that the several workers were taken
against their will and transported to an unknown destination in
a previously commandeered bus. the current location of the
Grozny hostages is unknown at the time of this report.
<P>

Meanwhile in Pervomaiskeyo, what is being described a "fierce
hand-to-hand" and "building to building" fighting continues.
What was expected by Moscow officials to be a short skirmish
"without extensive bloodshed", has turned into a bloody two-day
siege that has taken the lives of more than one-hundred (100)
Chechens, at least four (4) Russian soldiers, and an unknown
number of innocent civilians. The fate of hostages, taken on
Jan. 9th by Chechen rebels known as the "Lone Wolves", still
remains in doubt at the time of this report. One on-scene
Russian commander was quoted by Reuters News service as saying
that the Chechens were so firmly entrenched and well equipped
that he fears that the "Battle of Pervomaiskeyo" could go on for
the remainder of this week.
<P>

As the battle rages in Pervomaiskeyo, and the destiny of another
one-hundred and ninety-five (195) hostages now is in doubt, it
would appear that the stage is being set for any number of other
crisis situations and dramatic events, throughout the
strife-striken region.

<p><font size=5><strong>RUSSIA'S CRUMBLING MILITARY </strong></font>...<br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
When the Chechen rebels battled Russian government troops for Grozny during the week of 6 August, they did more than 
give the Russians a bloody nose. Some descriptions of the battle said that the Russians were &quot;humiliated.&quot; The statistics 
seem to suggest that description to be true. Killed were 451 Russian troops. Another 1,264 were wounded. Many, many 
more were recorded as missing, but there are reports that many of those may have actually been soldiers who had 
deserted.<br>
<br>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin had handed the Chechen problem over to his national security chief Alexander Lebed. In a 
sense, Yeltsin threw the ball to Lebed to see if he could find a way out of the abyss that the Russian government has found 
itself in with the would-be breakaway region of Chechnya. Lebed has had some success in negotiating a settlement in the 
region, but has consistently been undercut by other military and political leaders in Moscow, as he conducted shuttle 
diplomacy between Grozny and Moscow.<br>
<br>
Some people wonder why has Russia fought so hard to keep this region that few had ever heard of before? The answer is 
quite simple ... it's oil. Black gold. What some Americans call, &quot;Texas tea.&quot; Chechnya has a large amount of oil and the 
Russians aren't just going to let that walk awayand leave it for others. They also have concerns about Moslem incursion 
into the former Soviet Union and the possible instability, in other republics, that allowing Chechnya to break away could 
cause<br>
<br>
Chechnya has become Alexander Lebed's top priority. But our study, here, is not the Chechen war. It's what has become 
of the Russian military. For decades following the second world war, the Soviet military machine was feared and 
respected. Military strength in Russia has been a very important fact for centuries; before and during communism. Leaders 
and members of the military were also held in high esteem. Today, the current Defense Minister, General Igor Rodionov, 
says of his own military, &quot;Our armed forces do not have a single regiment capable of launching a combat action or moving 
by rail or air at two or three hours' notice.&quot;<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>So, what happened? What happened to this once-respected military machine?</strong></font><br>
<br>
The only Russian military force that is still well-run is said to be the Strategic Rocket Force. They control and maintain the 
approximately 700 mobile and/or silo-based intercontinental nuclear ballistic missiles. This force is described as operational 
and efficient. James Brusstar of the Institute for National Strategic Studies in Washington said, &quot;It's the one force that's 
gotten all the money it needs.&quot; But the Strategic Rocket Force is the only operational force that can be looked upon as 
being completely operationally ready. The rest of the military, the army, the navy and the air force would appear to have 
big, major problems.&quot;</p>
<p><font size=3><strong>Here is just a partial list of some of the woes of the Russian Military:</strong></font><br>
<br>
<strong>Military Equipment</strong>. What was once considered to be the former Soviet military-industrial complex has virtually been 
ground to a halt. Plants that once rolled out thousands of tanks are now standing idle. Russia has not completed the 
construction of one single warship since 1991. In 1995, they were trying to sell some uncompleted ships, including at least 
one aircraft carrier. Since 1995, the Air Force has received less than ten new aircraft. Even though the army has 
considerably less personnel today, they don't have enough uniforms to go around and civilian clothing has been permitted 
to be worn.<br>
<br>
<strong>Morale Of The Troops</strong>. It has been said that crime and corruption in the Russian military even exceeds what is 
happening in the civilian world. This area is not pretty. Officers are said to abuse each other and their troops. Border 
troops reportedly deal in narcotics. Air Force officers don't get paid. Tens of thousands of military personnel have second 
jobs. William Odom, the highly- respected former director of the U.S. National Security Agency and who is an expert on 
Russia at the Hudson Institute, said, &quot;If you issue an order, what happens is unpredictable.&quot; Is it any wonder when orders 
from Moscow to commanders in the Chechen theater were not carried out if those commanders didn't agree with the 
orders? This is no way to run a military.<br>
<br>
<strong>Training Of The Troops</strong>. The Russian Army does not hold exercises on the divisional or regimental level. Virtually every 
tank and infantry division is rated unfit for combat. Which in itself is astounding. Jet fighter pilots only receive ten percent as 
many training sorties as their Western counterparts. Another incredible example is that submarine commanders have to fill 
out their crews with sailors from surface vessels in order to go out on patrol.<br>
<br>
<strong>Military Budget</strong>. In 1996, Russia spent about $17 billion on defense. That is less than ten percent what the United States 
spends and about one third what Russian defense officials sought. Some military analysts say that Russia may actually be 
spending a bit more than the above figure -- but its still nowhere near what it used to be during the Soviet era.</p>
<hr>
<p>Andrei Piontkovsky of the Center for Strategic Studies in Moscow says that weak leadership, high-level infighting and 
Russia's uncertainty about its post-Cold War status are to blame to what has happened to its military. In July of this year, 
President Yeltsin replaced the unpopular Pavel Grachev as Defense Minister. In his place, he named General Igor 
Rodionov. It will be Rodionov's job to reform the military. Unfortunately, since Rodionov is near retirement age -- he may 
not have enough time to finish the massive job. Rodionov is no fool. He is said to be a long-term strategic thinker and is 
well-versed on Russian security issues. A purge of the Army's top ranks is said to be likely and at the top of Rodionov's 
list.<br>
<br>
He has a smaller military to deal with. Russian forces today are said to number at about 1.5 million troops. By comparison, 
the Soviet Union had 4.25 million troops in 1989. One important question is whether Russia will be able to go from a 
conscript military to an all-volunteer professional operation by the year 2000. There would be some doubt if that could be 
accomplished. Russia is unable to pay its personnel now. What are they going to offer to a potential recruit?<br>
<br>
Rodionov recently gave an interview and said that he would like Russia to have a professional military at about the 
personnel levels that the country has at this time. The armed forces will place special emphasis on nuclear weapons, 
mobility and high-tech equipment. A very good observation Rodionov made was that Russia is no longer a global power. It 
is now a regional power. It's main military doctrine will place emphasis on defense, as he said, &quot;To repel and contain a first 
strike.&quot; Rodionov did not name who he might consider enemies of Russia. Military experts suggest that Russia's main 
defensive concerns lay not with NATO expansion, but with China and its volatile southern border area -- these are the 
areas most likely that can be considered for any future conflict. The Russians, like the Americans and other major powers 
must also concern themselves with &quot;low-intensity conflicts&quot; and &quot;guerilla movements&quot;, which may be the source of terrorist 
attacks and increasing instability in the coming years.<br>
<br>
It may appear that we wish for the old days of the Russian military to return. But that's not true. What is sad, to a certain 
extent, is that an old, respected adversary has shrunken to thelevel that it has. It really is quite shocking. But it is also very 
dangerous. Russia still maintains a very powerful nuclear arsenal. It is still considered to be the one country that could 
destroy the U.S. or any other country with a nuclear strike. Because Russia has weakened its forces to such a dangerous 
level, it increases the prospect that should an enemy push too hard, Moscow would have to resort to nuclear weapons in 
order to prevail. That is very scary and it is very real.</p>

<TITLE>Virtual Disaster Network</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>"Virtual Disaster Network" Study Begins</H2>
<P>

Chicago, IL, November 21 --The Chicago-based, Emergency Response & Research Institute(ERRI), today announced the formulation of an internal task-force to study a concept that could have far-reaching implications in disaster management.  The idea involves the use of a "virtual" computer network that could be immediately activated in the event of a catastrophic natural or man-made disaster.
<P>  
The size of the network could be determined by the size of the disaster.  It would utilize the Internet, federal government resources, private leased lines, and those contained within individual emergency agencies to form a "virtual net".  This network could formed at the time of the disaster, and grow in proportion to the needs of the locality affected by the emergency event. At the conclusion of the incident, the network could be quickly dismantled, until needed again.
<P>
It is anticipated that this idea could help to assist in obtaining supplies,emergency personnel, and equipment needed by a local area, that is "overwhelmed" by the magnitude of any disaster. Often, telephone and radio circuits quickly become congested and/or disrupted by disasters, while computer links may remain intact.  Additionally, the use of the Internet could allow rapid transmission of data to a variety of national and even international sites on a timely basis.  Requests for specific needs could be routed to a national database of resources, which could then assist in the dispatch of those supplies/equipment/personnel to the scene of a disaster.

<P>
Clark Staten, Executive Director of ERRI, said that the concept could be put in place within the United States at its onset, and then gradually expanded it to allow international cooperation and coordination of emergency events.  He said that, if such a network were in place, that appropriate aid could have been rushed to the Kobe earthquake within hours of the devastating disaster. Additionally, he said that ERRI is unaware of any sort of easily accessable "resource databank" that currently catalogs the location, qualifications, and availability of specialized rescue personnel and resources that might be needed in a major disaster.
<P>
Staten concluded by saying that ERRI would begin the planning process for such a project, and undertake funding of some of the preliminary research to assess the feasibility of the idea, but that external funding and support would become necessary to carry the concept to complete implementation.  Comments, questions, and suggestions about this study are welcomed.

<H2>Bulls Win!  Civil Disturbance Coming??</H2>
By Paul Anderson, ENN Metro Correspondent
<P>

CHICAGO (ENN) -- The possibility that the Chicago Bulls will win 
another national championship is almost a forgone conclusion.  
Leading three games to none in the current series against the 
Seattle Supersonics, Michael Jordan and company have demonstrated 
a magnificent basketball prowess and should be justifiably proud 
of their accomplishments.  Chicago fans, always hungry for a 
winner, are also jubilant about the possibility of another 
Chicago championship.
<P>

Unfortunately, there has been, historically, a "dark side" to
the Bulls winning. On each of the most recent occasions that
the Bulls have won a championship, civil unrest and violence
has broken out in any number of Chicago neighborhoods. All
too regularly, it would appear that street gangs and other petty
criminals have used the occasion of a Bulls victory to justify the
overturning and burning of cars, attacks on innocent people on
the streets, burglaries, looting, and indiscriminate shooting.
<P>

To gain a perspective of past incidents, here is a summary
from a 1993 EmergencyNet News report that was written as
the events occurred:
<P>
<HR>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE-EMERGENCYNET NEWS SVC.- 06/20/93-2300CDT
<BR>
<H3>BULLS WIN CHAMPIONSHIP, PREDICTED UNREST BEGINS</H3>

Chicago, IL - Within minutes of the Bulls 99-98 victory over
the Phoenix Suns, gunshots and fireworks could be heard
all over the City of Chicago.  While much of the early noise
could be attributed to genuine celebration, it wasn't long
before the police scanner began to light up with reports of
shots fired, with some at the police.  Seconds later, reports
were being received of large crowds of "youths" blocking
numerous intersections and stopping traffic.
<P>

Soon, reports of rocks and bottles being thrown at the police
at 23rd and State were received, followed by a request for a
"10-1" (officer needs assistance) at 75th and Coles.  Fires
were reportedly set at the disturbance at 75th and Coles,
and a second request for assistance was broadcast.
Concurrently, police at 2240 S. State reported that they
were "pinned down" and being pelted with "rocks and bottles".
At approximately 2120CDT, officers in the 2300 Block of S. State
frantically requested additional assistance and reported that
they were under fire.
<P>

Even though police and fire officials had planned extensively
for this eventuality, the frenzy of violence continued to escalate.
Police reported that they were having great difficulty controlling
the intersection of Division and State in Chicago's Rush Street
area.  Mounted officers were quickly dispatched to attempt to
clear several downtown intersections and several calls for "gas
teams" were heard on police frequencies.  The "gas teams"
were Chicago Police officers equipped with pepper-teargas
dispensers that are used to disperse unruly crowds.
<P>

At 2130CDT, reports began to be received of "breaking into
stores" in the vicinity of 39th and Martin Luther King Drive,
62nd and Vernon, 66th and Cottage Grove, and in the 400
block of E. 34th Street.  Although not specifically described
as "looting", the intensity and frequency of reports would
suggest that numerous "burglaries" were being committed.
By 2140CDT, police and fire radios were alive with a
constant barrage of reports of mayhem.
<P>

At 2145CDT, a Chicago Fire Dept ambulance was dispatched
to Madison and Laramie for an unconfirmed report of a
"policeman shot".  Radio reports of sporadic violence continued
throughout the city.  Especially on Chicago's Southside,
numerous reports were received of "large crowds" surging
through neighborhoods, overturning cars, and setting of fires in
garbage cans and dumpsters.  Continued reports of "shots fired"
were heard on police radios, and at least one police officer is
known shot and transported to Michael Reese Hospital.....
<P>
<HR>
Veteran police officers and ERRI crime analysts say that they
fear that 1996 events could prove similar in nature. They tell
ENN that they are concerned about spontaneous violence
immediately following a victory on Wednesday evening or
again on Friday, following a planned victory celebration in
Grant Park.
<P>

City police and fire officials tell ENN that they have been
planning for any such an eventuality, and are hopeful that
no violence will occur.  Mayor Richard Daley held a news
conference on Monday afternoon and outlined some of the
steps that Chicago will take to maintain order after the
expected Bulls victory.
<P>

The security plan is believed to cost about $1 million.  Some
of the steps in the security plan include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- Extra police patrols will be implemented.  This means that
there will be about 5,000 officers on the street.
<LI>-- 60 Illinois State Police troopers will assigned to escort
Chicago Fire Department equipment and ambulances.
<LI>-- CTA buses will be used to transport any overflow of prisoners.
<LI>-- 200 Illinois National Guardsmen will be on stand-by for deployment
to troubled areas.

<H2>U.S. TROOPS REVIEW EXPECTED DANGERS IN BOSNIA...</H2>
<P>
By Steve Macko, Managing Editor
<P>
In the last few days, more than one thousand members of the 21st Theater
Army Command (TAACOM) were briefed about what to expect if they are
deployed in the upcoming Bosnia peace mission.  The units from TAACOM are 
logistics soldiers that will support units from the U.S. Army's 1st Armored 
Division, which will be part of the 20,000 American soldiers who will be 
involved in the NATO-led peace mission to the war-torn area.
<P>

Military commanders have not as of yet decided whether TAACOM will be staged
inside of Bosnia or along a supply line that will be stationed in Hungary.
Currently, the unit is located in west-central Germany.
<P>

In the briefing, the soldiers were told that they can expect narrow icy
roads and a threat of terrorism from Serb nationalists.  It is expected
that U.S. forces will take on casualties during the course of this mission.
What the commanders must decide for the TAACOM unit is whether or not it
is better if this support unit is closer to the action or have them
remain in safe comfort in Hungary.
<P>

The public affairs officer of the unit said that it would be better for
the unit to be based in Bosnia -- in order to be as close to the combat
troops as possible.  But the morale of the soldiers must be taken into
account.  Major L. Bruce Shearer related some of the questions that need
to be addressed, "Can we give them hot water?  Can we give them hot meals?  
And if the soldiers don't have anything to do with their free time, they
get in trouble."
<P>

The most dangerous challenge TAACOM soldiers would face in Hungary would
be driving on that country's narrow, crowded and icy roads.  But in
Bosnia, it's a whole different ballgame.  The troops would have to
face treacherous mountain roads near Tuzla, where the U.S. troops and
their tanks and armored vehicles will be deployed.  The troops would
also face blown bridges and ... mines.
<P>

The briefing that the soldiers attended went over such topics as:
the law of war, the code of coduct and most importantly -- the rules
of engagement.  The soldiers were instructed, "You have the right and
obligation to defend yourself.  Normally, you may not shoot at Red Cross
facilities ... but if someone is shooting at you from a Red Cross
building ... you will shoot back."
<P>

Regardless, military experts and analysts agree on one thing ...
this mission won't be a cakewalk.

<H2>WORLD PROBLEMS WITH LOCAL INPUT-  NYPD COVERS ALL BASES</H2>
By Jim Fay   ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

While all the world grieves the deaths of Israeli and Cuban-
American citizens,  NYC has become the "protest
central"  as the the headquarters of the organizations
that are the focus of demonstrations as a result of the two
incidents.  Both are located in the heart of Manhattan.
<P>

The NYPD, understandably, is reluctant to talk about security
at locations that are considered hotspots due to world problems.
But a brief observation will show that the Department was
fortunate this past weekend, with demonstration participants
at a minimum.
<P>

The main demonstration at the headquarters of the Palestine
Observer to the United Nations, at 115 East 65 St., had a vocal,
yet controlled group, letting the Palestinian Representative know
how they feel about the deaths that have occurred in Jerusalem
over the past two weekends.  The NYPD provided a detail from
the Manhattan North Task Force to maintain the peace and
control the crowds, as necessary.
<P>

However, the Manhattan South Task Force (the boundary being
East and West 59 Street) is traditionally the busier of the two
task forces, and this past Sunday MSTF was required at both
the Israeli Consulate to the UN, at 2nd Ave. and E. 42 St., and
the Cuban Consulate, at Lexington Ave. and East 38 Street.
Fortunately, at both locations, the crowds were small and a
minimal number of officers were used, one sergeant and 10
officers at each.
<P>

Under Commissioner William Bratton,  'Mobilization Drills"
take place often at location and areas of NYC.  These drills
are spontaneous responses by the Task Forces in each Borough,
with certain extra specialized units.  The mobilization
procedures have three levels of urgency, in which a first-line
patrol supervisor can request Task Force personnel, depending
on what is needed at a particular time at a location. This is similar
to the extra alarms that are transmitted in a fire department operation.
<P>

Officers assigned to the eight Borough Task Forces (three of the
five boroughs have "north" and "south" commands) have
said off the record that a "busy summer" is expected if world
conditions do not improve over the next three or four months.
But they do not expect a large number of localized street
disturbances, which can run the ranks of the Task Forces thin
on a day to day basis.

We always enjoy hearing from firefighters, paramedics and police officers
when they wish to relate some of their exploits.  Your editor received
the following letter today from Firefighter John Chadwick from the
United Kingdom:
<P>
Dear Steve Macko,
<BR>
                 
This incident happened on the 27th December 95.
This was my first rescue since joining the Fire Brigade in over two
years.   My buddy that entered the building with me confirmed this
was his first in ten years.
<P>

<H3>Fire-Fighters rescue a man from his blazing flat in Bedworth
Warwickshire U.K.</H3>

Three Fire Teams, one from Nuneaton and two from Bedworth were
called to the blaze at 6.34 a.m.
<P>

Crews had been told there were reports that people were trapped
inside the Flat in Dark Lane, Bedworth. firefighters using breathing
apparatus entered the flat and after 15 minutes brought one man out
of the building before going back inside to make sure the rest was
clear.
<P>

The man, believed to be in his mid 20s, was taken to the hospital
and was treated for smoke inhalation.  Divisional Fire officer
Ian Cowley, said: "We had to smash the front door to get in the building.
No one else was in the building."
<P>

The fire is thought to have started in an electric meter box under
the staircase. It was the second blaze at the two storey building in
recent weeks. Malcolm Tandy, spokesman for Warwickshire Fire
Service, said: "We have some concern because we have had two fires in
the same property. We may need to launch an investigation."
A Police spokesman confirmed, "Police & Fire brigade are treating the
fire as suspicious."
<P>
Divisional officer Cowley said that smoke detectors had been fitted
inside the building but he did not think they had been triggered by
the fire.  He urged householders to check smoke alarms regularly.

<p>Excerpted from EmergencyNet News Daily Report<br>
09/12/96 - Vol. 2, No. 256</p>
<p><font size=2><em><strong>(Editor's Note: After reading this highly-detailed report by Ambassador Philip C. Wilcox, the reader will have a complete 
understanding of the U.S. State Department's Office of the Coordinator of Counterterrorism. Wilcox also touches upon the 
responsibilites of the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. As editor of this 
publication, I'd like to thank the U.S. State Department for being very generous with the information that that they provide on a daily 
basis. -- Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor)</strong></em></font><br>
<br>
<font size=6><strong>Testimony: Combating International Terrorism</strong></font><br>
<br>
<u>Testimony by Ambassador Philip C. Wilcox, Jr., Coordinator for Counterterrorism, before the House of Representatives, 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC, March 5, 1996</u>.<br>
<br>
Mr. Chairman:<br>
<br>
Thank you for this opportunity to testify about the responsibilities and activities of the Department of State in combating 
international terrorism. Americans view with growing concern the threat of terrorism at home and abroad. The 
Administration considers the struggle against international terrorism as one of our top foreign policy priorities, because of 
the threat it poses to the U.S., and to many other nations. In speeches last fall to the United Nations, the President and 
Secretary Christopher called for accelerated international cooperation against this menace and in Washington, we are 
strengthening our own capabilities.<br>
<br>
Since there are many dimensions to international terrorism, effective counterterrorism calls for the skills and resources of 
various elements of the U.S. government. We have learned from past experience with fragmented efforts that coordination 
of these resources is essential. For this reason, the President has designated the Department of State, in keeping with its 
overall responsibility for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy, as the lead agency for managing and coordinating 
counterterrorism policy and operations abroad, whereas the Department of Justice has been designated the lead agency for 
domestic terrorism. These responsibilities were reaffirmed recently in Presidential Decision Directive 39, signed by 
President Clinton on June 21, 1995.<br>
<br>
Since the creation in 1972 of the forerunner of the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, my office -- known as 
S/CT -- has been the focal point for this coordinating activity. Coordination, Mr. Chairman, is central to State's 
counterterrorism role, and I want to emphasize this at the outset of my testimony, although the focus of this hearing is on 
specific responsibilities of State, Defense and the FBI. For this reason, I would like to explain State's particular 
contributions in the context of our coordinating role.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Diplomacy and International Cooperation:</strong></font><br>
<br>
Terrorism affects the security and the political and economic stability of nations. Acts of international terrorism, by 
definition, involve the citizens or territory of more than one nation, and terrorists are expanding their regional and global 
reach. Diplomacy and international cooperation are, therefore, critically important to a successful effort against the terrorist 
threat.<br>
<br>
To enhance such cooperation, my office conducts frequent consultations with many foreign governments, usually with 
interagency teams, which might include colleagues from Justice, FBI, CIA, DOD, FAA and other agencies. These 
consultations are a valuable means of projecting U.S. policy aims and obtaining foreign cooperation.<br>
In recent months, I have led interagency teams to Moscow, New Delhi, Islamabad, Riyadh and Sanaa. We have held 
consultations with over 20 governments in the past year, and we have met with counterterrorism experts of the European 
Union and the Group of Eight. This network of international cooperation is growing stronger, as more and more nations 
realize that cooperation is essential.<br>
<br>
A series of regional and international conferences on counterterrorism is a sign of the growing trend toward cooperation. In 
August, I led a U.S. delegation to Buenos Aires to attend a conference of the states of the southern cone countries in Latin 
America, plus the U.S. and Canada. The agenda was cooperation in fighting international terrorism against the backdrop of 
the 1992 and 1994 bombings in Buenos Aires. And we are now working with our partners in the Organization of 
American states to prepare for a hemispheric conference on counterterrorism in Lima this April, which was called for by 
the Summit of the Americas at Miami in December, 1994.<br>
<br>
A Ministerial Conference on Terrorism of the Group of Eight in Ottawa in December, which grew out of the Halifax 
Summit in June, addressed concrete ways to enhance international cooperation against terrorism on a global level. The 
International Conference on Counterterrorism at Baguio in the Philippines last month, was the first such initiative in Asia.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Department of State-Law Enforcement Coordination:</strong></font><br>
<br>
Strengthening the rule of law is a major tenet of U.S. counterterrorism policy. As my colleague from FBI will describe, 
terrorism is a crime under various U.S. laws and the laws of many other nations, and effective law enforcement and 
aggressive prosecution of international terrorists are thus critical to U.S. and international efforts against terrorism. 
Therefore, the Department of State works closely in support of Justice and FBI efforts to pursue terrorists abroad who 
violate U.S. laws. State facilitates anti-terrorism law enforcement overseas in a wide variety of ways, for example, in 
establishing and supporting FBI investigations abroad, and working with FBI, Justice and foreign governments when 
extradition or rendition of terrorist suspects to the U.S. is an option for bringing them to justice.<br>
<br>
My office, working closely with the Department's Office of the Legal Adviser and with Justice, is also making a major 
effort to persuade other governments, who have not yet become party to the ten existing international treaties and 
conventions on terrorism, to do so.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> State - Intelligence Coordination:</strong></font><br>
<br>
Identifying international terrorists and their networks, providing warning so that protective or deterrent measures can be 
taken, and gathering information on terrorist acts requires a major U.S. intelligence effort. For this reason, the U.S. 
intelligence community and the technical and human resources they provide are an indispensable element in our overall 
approach to international terrorism.<br>
<br>
My office relies heavily on State's Office of Terrorism, Narcotics and International Crime (INR/TNC) in the Bureau of 
Intelligence and Research to provide us with timely, all-source intelligence on terrorism, and analysis on issues of current 
policy concern. Intelligence is the lifeblood of effective counterterrorism, and without INR's expert, round-the-clock 
support, we could not do our job. It is essential that INR be given adequate resources to perform its indispensable role.<br>
<br>
State depends as well upon intelligence collection and analytical support from other elements of the intelligence community. 
We have a very close working relationship with the DCI's Counter-Terrorism Center. And officers from the Center are our 
close partners in working groups, international consultations, and counterterrorism operations, which we coordinate.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> State - Defense Cooperation:</strong></font><br>
<br>
Our superb military counterterrorism capabilities, which my colleague from Defense will describe, are another important 
tool in our arsenal to combat international terrorism. When peaceful means fail and the use of military force is feasible, we 
need the world's best specialized military expertise to rescue victims of terrorism, apprehend terrorists, or deter acts of 
terrorism, and we rely on the Department of Defense for other forms of counterterrorism support.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Emergency Response Capability:</strong></font><br>
<br>
To respond promptly to terrorist incidents abroad which require varied U.S. resources, we have developed a unique fast 
reaction team. This team, led by an officer from S/CT, consists of experts from DOD, CIA, FBI and other agencies, as 
needed. At the request of a foreign government or a U.S. Ambassador abroad, this team can be dispatched within a few 
hours on a specially dedicated aircraft provided by DOD to any place in the world. The team's job is to provide support to 
the Ambassador and the host government in resolving a terrorist crisis, and to advise on additional U.S. assets that might 
be needed. Throughout the year, the response team joins our special forces in major training exercises. The team also 
supports our regional CINCS by providing role players for exercises.<br>
<br>
Flexibility and responsiveness are the watchwords of this team concept. Small, tailored teams can be launched, depending 
on the crisis, and specialists from individual agencies can be sent alone, as the situation arises.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Other Examples of Coordination:</strong></font><br>
<br>
Other recent examples of the integrated, coordinated process which State directs to deal with terrorist crises abroad 
include the following: a series of extradition, rendition and law enforcement cooperation efforts which resulted in the return 
in 1995 of two World Trade Center bombing suspects to the U.S. including ring leader Ramzi Ahmed Yousef; discovery 
of and preventive measures to deal with a plot by this group to bomb U.S. civilian aircraft in Asia, and the successful return 
to the U.S. for prosecution of two more members of this group; investigation of the terrorist murders of two U.S. 
Consulate officials in Karachi; the bombing of the U.S. Training office for the Saudi National Guard in Riyadh in 
November, which killed five Americans; support and assistance to Argentina after the bombing of the Jewish cultural 
center in 1994; efforts to learn more about and take measures to deal with threats arising from the Aum Shinrikyo sarin gas 
attacks in Tokyo; responding to a request by Israel for extradition of a suspected HAMAS terrorist; and investigation of 
the recent bus bombings in Jerusalem, in which two Americans died.<br>
<br>
These efforts required resources and careful teamwork from many members of the U.S. counterterrorism community, 
including Justice, FBI, and often CIA, NSA, Defense, Treasury, Transportation, FAA and INS, as well as the 
Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security.<br>
<br>
Because these cases involved international terrorism and foreign governments, they often require rapid reaction, intricate 
planning, and complex coordination. In each case, State played its coordinating role, relying on excellent cooperation from 
all elements of the U.S. counterterrorism community.</p>
<p><font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Protection Abroad, Visa Denial and Threat Warnings:</strong></font><br>
<br>
State's Bureau of Diplomatic Security is another important actor in the U.S. counterterrorism community. DS is responsible 
for protection of U.S. official civilian personnel and facilities abroad against terrorist and other threats. Since 1979, there 
have been 460 such attacks against U.S. diplomatic personnel, buildings and vehicles. Twenty-five diplomats have been 
killed by terrorists, and fifty-five have been wounded.<br>
<br>
In addition to protective duties, Regional Security Officers at U.S. missions abroad have intelligence and investigative 
responsibilities, for example, to investigate passport and visa fraud, which often accompanies terrorist crimes. In 
Washington, DS plays an important part in the process of issuing warnings against terrorist threats and travel advisories. 
DS agents are active in many counterterrorism investigations, and played a lead role in the apprehension of Ramzi Ahmed 
Yousef. DS also helps U.S. business firms and NGO's abroad, through its Overseas Security Advisory Council, which 
maintains an electronic bulletin board for exchange of security related and terrorist information abroad.<br>
<br>
The Bureau of Consular Affairs is another important player in State's counterterrorism effort. CA, working with INR, 
S/CT, DS and the intelligence community and our consulates abroad, maintains systems for denying entry into the U.S. of 
terrorists and suspects. It also issues threat warnings and travel advisories to American citizens overseas.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Identifying State Sponsors of Terrorism:</strong></font><br>
<br>
Identifying State sponsors of terrorism and mobilizing international pressure against them is a major element of U.S. policy, 
in accordance with Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act and related laws. The Office of the Coordinator for 
Counterterrorism, working with regional bureaus, INR and the intelligence community, makes annual recommendations to 
the Secretary of State, which provide the basis for his annual review of state sponsors. We pursue through diplomatic 
channels, and through the UN in the case of Libya and Iraq, the maintenance and broadening of economic and other 
sanctions against these states. Mr. Chairman, I believe we can point to this policy as one reason why terrorist acts 
sponsored by states or their proxies have declined in recent years, although state sponsors like Iran remain a serious threat.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Anti-Terrorism Training, Research &amp; Development and Rewards:</strong></font><br>
<br>
State's Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program, administered by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security with policy guidance from 
the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, is another effective tool in reducing the danger of international 
terrorism. Over the last decade, over 17,000 officials from 89 foreign countries have received training in a wide variety of 
ATA courses. This low cost program, funded at about $15 million annually in recent years, has been a superb investment in 
reducing the terrorist risk to friendly countries and to U.S. citizens and airlines abroad.<br>
We are pleased that the conferees recently increased the appropriation to $16 million for FY 1996.<br>
<br>
State also coordinates an interagency research and development program for counterterrorism technologies, through the 
Technical Support Working Group. The bulk of the funding for this important program is provided by the Department of 
Defense. We also chair U.S. delegations that participate in joint research in counterterrorism technologies under bilateral 
agreements with the UK, Canada, and Israel.<br>
<br>
State's International Terrorism Information Rewards Program is another important part of our counterterrorism effort. This 
program has paid out more than $3 million to individuals who provided information leading to the prosecution of terrorists 
or the prevention of acts of terrorism.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Analytic Reports:</strong></font><br>
<br>
The most prominent unclassified report by the Department of State on terrorism is our annual &quot;Patterns of Global 
Terrorism.&quot; This report, which the Congress requires by April 30 each year, has become the recognized authority in this 
field. We are grateful for the many contributions we receive for Patterns from INR and CIA. From time to time, S/CT also 
publishes unclassified public papers on individual terrorist groups or countries. We have urged the Congress not to impose 
additional, mandatory reporting requirements because of manpower constraints.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Conclusion:</strong></font><br>
<br>
Mr. Chairman, from my experience as Coordinator for Counterterrorism at State, and from my intensive work with 
colleagues from other agencies, I can say with conviction that the United States is well served by our counterterrorism 
community. All U.S. Government Departments concerned share the strong commitment of the President and Secretary 
Christopher to giving our counterterrorism efforts the highest priority. Our counterterrorism community is professional, 
dedicated, and committed to a coordinated, team effort. Terrorism is a difficult and dangerous enemy, but we are making a 
determined and impressive effort to combat it in all its evil aspects.<br>

<H3>Hurricane Opal; Deadly Storm Hits Gulf Coast</H3>
<BR>
<P>
<BR>
Chicago, IL, (ENN) October 4, 1995 -- Although weakened somewhat in
the past few hours, Hurricane Opal is still a Category 3/4 storm
with 125-145mph winds.  It is being called "extremely dangerous"
by weather watchers and emergency officials. Many Floridians,
Mississippians, and Alabama residents must have taken the
warning to heart, as evacuations have caused massive traffic
jams for those heading North to flee the storm. The traffic has
become so bad in some Gulf Coast areas that police and emergency
planners are suggesting that people who aren't already on the
road stay at home and 'button-up" to wait out the storms.
<P> 

National Weather Service forecasters predict that Opal will make
landfall today in the late afternoon or early evening and that
the eye may pass over the Pensacola, FL, area. Opal is reported
to be moving N-NE at 23mph at the time of this report.
<P> 

Emergency service officials say that they fear that some local
residents may not have taken reports of the hurricane seriously,
or not heard them at all as much public attention has been
deflected in the past day or two by the extensive coverage of
the O.J. Simpson trial and verdict. Another concern raised is
that Jewish residents in the area may not have been properly
warned because they are in the midst of celebrating Yom Kippur,
which could essentially prohibit them from watching TV or
listening to the radio. Also thought to be at risk are elderly
or retired people, who may not pay much attention to media
reports. Emergency officials say, however, that they are hopeful
that most of those in the path of Opal have moved to higher
ground.
<P>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which received
much criticism following its response to Hurricane Andrew, has
reportedly sent several senior staff members to the area to
assess preparedness and begin the process of rescue/recovery as
soon as the storm passes. Having FEMA officials immediately
available to assess the damage may help to hasten the state and
federal disaster declaration process and start the flow of
essential supplies, according to several disaster experts.
Controversy erupted in the Miami area shortly after the landfall
of Hurricane Andrew, as difficulties arose in completing the
necessary paperwork and making notifications to activate the
flow of federal dollars and equipment to assist in the local
rescue efforts.
<P>

Local emergency agencies are already said to be on maximum alert
with off-duty police, firefighters, and paramedics being
recalled to stations, so that they can respond as soon as
possible to emergencies caused by the coming deluge of wind and
rain. Many have been assisting in sandbagging efforts in
low-lying areas in the past day or two and others have been
helping friends and neighbors with board-up efforts. Many of the
emergency agencies in the area are volunteers, who may work at a
regular occupation until called upon in an emergency such as
Opal.
<P>  

During an interview this afternoon, with two members of a local
Florida rescue squad, they said that they were in the process of
locating the heavy construction equipment that might be
necessary to assist in the extrication of people that have been
buried or trapped by building collapses. They also say that, at
this time, they are preparing for the worst and are praying for
the best. The interview was concluded with a rapid goodbye and
the sounds of sirens as the volunteer EMTs (Emergency Medical
Technicians) sped off to help someone involved in a traffic
accident caused by the rain-slickened streets. It is likely that
the call will be only one of many in the coming hours.

<H2>American Troops to Bosnia??</H2>
<BR>
Editorial Opinion
<BR>
By Clark Staten, Executive Editor
<P>

Chicago, IL., November 26, 1995 --1st Armored Division troops
are on alert at several bases in Europe. They are preparing for
deployment to Bosnia. A "peace-keeping" mission is being ordered
by their Commander in Chief Bill Clinton, and the troops are
drawing their weapons, ammunition, and coldweather equipment and
making themselves ready for movement. Secretary of Defense
William Perry says that it is possible that the first contingent
of American military engineers will arrive in Bosnia by the
first of December, with as many as 20,000 other combat troops
being sent there by mid or late December.
<P>

  A controversy is swirling in Republican circles in Washington,
as well as in the military itself, about the advisability of
this mission. Parallels are already being drawn, by critics, to
past "peace-keeping" missions in Somalia and Haiti. Memories of
a recent debacle in Somalia, where 18 American troops were
killed on one disastrous October day, are being dredged up and
revisited. The "warlords" that were to have been purged by
American efforts have reassumed their control of the countryside
and hunger and violence again threaten the population. Some
would suggest that nothing was accomplished in Somalia except
the deaths of some of America's finest troops and another
"black-eye" was given to American foreign policy.
<P>

As riots spread through the streets of Cite Soleil, Haiti and
U.S. backed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is allegedly
calling for "vigilante action" against his political opponents,
administration critics wonder what was accomplished there, as
well. Rumors abound that Aristide may not follow constitutional
dictates, and plans to remain in power for an additional three
years. Local experts say that the currently tense situation in
Haiti may well lead to a violent reaction if scheduled Dec. 17th
elections aren't held. Some knowledgeable local observers even
suggest that Aristide could be removed by yet another coup,
similar to the one that removed him from power in the first
place.
<P>

The most obvious parallels that are being pointed out involve
the fact that U.S. troops are about to be inserted to a civil
war that has lasted for many decades.  No specific mission
objectives have been given by the Clinton Administration, except
that the troops are to "monitor a zone of separation" between
Moslem, Croatian, and Serbian forces. The duration of the
commitment has not been firmly set, but estimated by Sec.of Def.
Perry at approximately one year. As in Somalia, U.S. Troops will
not be ultimately under American command, but this time, they
will report to American NATO Commander Gen. George Joulwan,
instead of the United Nations. Concerns have also already been
raised, that like in Somalia, Americans may be perceived as
favoring one side over another in the conflict.  Americans may
be seen by Serb extremist groups as supporting the Croats or
Moslems, because American planes have previously bombed Serb
positions.
<P>  

Military experts say that there are many dangers awaiting U.S.
soldiers in Bosnia. Landmines, terrorist groups, local
paramilitary organizations, and possible guerrilla operations.
They suggest that there could easily be casualties, maybe even
large numbers of American deaths, if artillery, carbombs, or
other explosives are used against American forces.
<P>

Critics would suggest that the only reason that American forces
are being inserted into this perilous set of circumstances is
that President Clinton had made a previous commitment to send
American forces to support a precarious peace accord, finally
engineered by Clinton administration officials. They say the
main motivation for the mission is preventing a "loss of face"
for Clinton and his foreign policy. Neo-isolationists in
Washington question what overriding "national interests" are at
stake in Bosnia and say that aside from "naive altruistic
motives" they can't identify a real purpose in the American
deployment.
<P> 

We, at ENN, agree with the detractors to the deployment. Our
overriding concern is for the lives of the American soldiers
that will be placed "in harms way". Unless new facts come to
light, it is our belief that the Bosnian mission, however well
meaning, may be a futile attempt to solve a problem that must be
resolved solely by the parties involved. American intervention
can not dictate, nor resolve in any meaningful way, the
political or religious differences that have caused the current
state of civil war in Bosnia. Regardless of the level of
American deployment, if Serbian extremists are committed to
killing Moslems or Croats, they will die.  More unfortunate
would be the unnecessary deaths of young American men and women,
caught in the cross-fire of a naive and overly ambitious foreign policy.

(Editor's Note:12/04/95-The American deployment is underway. Regardless of the aforementioned opinions of ENN and ERRI, American troops have arrived on-the-ground in Bosnia. In light of this development, ERRI/ENN sends it's prayers and complete and total support for the American men and women serving with NATO. One of the fundamental rights that they are continually defending it that of freedom of speech, and our right to dissent from administration policies, with which we don't agree. But, the decision of deployment already made, it is also our opinion that all Americans must now  support the brave men and women who have volunteered to defend liberty and facilitate the peace process in Bosnia.

<TITLE>Mystery Disease in Southwest; 13 Dead</TITLE>

<H2>MYSTERY DISEASE CLAIMS THIRTEENTH LIFE, CAUSE UNKNOWN</H2>
By Amy Grant, Medical Correspondent
<P>

Santa Fe, NM - An as yet unidentified illness, that has taken a total of
thirteen lives ,appears to be spreading from its original origins in
the nation's Southwest.  The unidentified disease, which is believed to
have been first identified on a Navajo Indian reservation, now has spread to
other areas of the Southwest and Midwest.
<P>

The mystery disease is characterized by "flu-like" symptoms such
as fever, muscle aches, weakness, and general malaise. The disease then
takes a dramatic turn, with rapid filling of the lungs with fluid and suffocation
In several cases, the unknown ailment has had a very rapid onset, which 
has resulted in death in otherwise health teenagers and young adults. 
First thought to only be effect native Americans, in recent days, the deadly
malady has struck Caucasians and other ethnic groups.
<P>

Public health officials reportedly remain stumped by the "mystery disease",
which reportedly does not fit the normal patterns of any known
food, water, or airborne disease.  Epidemiologists say that they are having
great difficulty in identifying a common vector of transmission that could
help to pinpoint the type of disease that is involved.
<P>  

Health investigators have been pursuing the possibility that the disease is transmitted by direct contact or inhalation of an airborne virus that is carried in rodent feces and that could efficiently pass from one person to another. This theory is being discounted, though, because families and others that have been in close contact with deceased  patients have not, so far, shown any symptoms of the disease.
<P>

Another theory holds that the cause of the deaths is a chemical contaminant,
that could be common to agricultural workers or others living
and working near the region's farming community.  However, state health
workers report that no autopsy results or other chemical tests of patients
have confirmed the presence of any known poisons or other toxic substances
that could explain the sudden deaths.
<P>

An unverified report says that at least one investigator is even
considering the possibility that a "genetically-altered bio-agent" has
"gotten loose" in the Southwest.  Military and government officials, of
course, deny the possibility of any such release.  But, family members and
independent researchers say that they will not "leave any stone unturned" in
their attempt to learn the true cause of the deaths.
<P>

U.S. Public Health Service officials say that they will to survey
more than 200,000 members of the Navajo nation, in an attempt to discover
any "commonality" between those previously stricken by the mysterious
disease.   But, investigators say that members of the Navajo nation are not likely
to fully cooperate in the survey, largely due to long held beliefs regarding death
and not talking about the ascension of the deceased soul .  Public health workers report that they have been unable, so far, to find any place, chemical, water, food, air, or other source of possible contamination that can be commonly attributed to all of the patients that have been taken ill.
<P>

(Editor's Note: This entity was later reported to be "Hantavirus", with 
 sporadic outbreaks since this orginal report. It was linked to "rat
 droppings" with rodents as the disease vector)

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 12:00CDT

<P>
<H2>ERRI Announces International Disaster Assistance Center (IDAC)</H2>
Chicago, IL, June 20, 1996 (ENN) --The Emergency Response &
Research Institute (ERRI) today announced the opening of a new
service on it's emergency service website. The International
Disaster Assistance Center (IDAC) is designed to encourage and
facilitate the exchange of vital information between those
needing specialized rescue personnel, supplies, and equipment
during a disaster, and those that have an ability to provide
such resources.
<P>

The project will provide a public webpage with facilities for
the development of a worldwide databank of available
emergency/disaster resources.  Additionally, requests for mutual
aid assistance by official agencies, will be posted in almost
"real-time", allowing agencies in need of special rescue teams
or equipment to make their needs known to the international
disaster community in a timely manner. Both resources and needs
will be verified for authenticity by ERRI personnel prior to
posting to the webpage. It's anticipated that the actual agreement 
for movement of supplies or personnel will be arranged between 
the agencies involved.
<P>   

According to Clark Staten, ERRI Executive Director, the project
could prove most useful in large disasters like the Kobe
earthquake, or in smaller local incidents, when specialized
rescue assets like "search dog teams" are needed. "The idea is
to provide a organized place for incident commanders to go for
help, when they are in the midst of an incident and don't know
where else to locate a needed resource." Staten said. "This
concept, using Internet and World-Wide-Web technologies,
provides the possibility of information and resource sharing on
a virtually international basis," the veteran emergency manager
added. 
<P> 

Staten emphasized that IDAC will be provided as a free public
service by ERRI, both for emergency service agencies and those
that would offer to contribute goods/services/personnel to
disaster operations. Staten said that all that is needed now is
for those with special expertise, supplies or equipment to begin
to send information to the IDAC for compiling and posting. He
encouraged cave rescue teams, building collapse specialists,
search dog handlers, equipment suppliers, explosives disposal 
technicians, chemical/biological/nuclear experts, and others with
available emergency personnel/assets to share, to please send
information about their organization to ERRI/IDAC by e-mail,
fax, or regular mail.

<H2>The O.J. Simpson Case; Who Cares?</H2>
<BR>
By Clark Staten, ENN Executive Editor
<P>
Chicago, IL, (ENN) January 25, 1995 --"Live from Los Angeles"...are words
that we hear most often these days. A virtual "feeding frenzy"
of publicity and coverage of a murder trial involving a fallen
football star, his estranged wife, and her friend seems to have
captured the imagination of the media, if not the American
public.  As this report is written, all four of the major
television networks have chosen to preempt everything else that
is going on in the world, to hear the opening statements of
several highly paid lawyers, as they discuss the merits of a
case against an accused murderer.
<P>  
No real substantive issues, that concern the rest of America,
are being discussed in that court room.  The outcome, in
acquittal or conviction, will have little effect on poverty,
crime, prejudice, war, pestilence, disease, or any of the other
ills that affect our everyday society. Were it not for the
notoriety of the accused former football star, many journalists
agree that this case would be worthy of a day or two on page
three of their local paper and then relegated to page thirty-six
for the duration of the case...if it were covered at all.  Cases
of this kind happen almost everyday, somewhere in America.  Yet,
somehow, there it is...the O.J. case, at the lead of every
newscast, live in the middle of the afternoon, commandeering my
television set.
<P>

I admit I am at a loss to explain the real significance of this
case, other than to observe that it may have provided an open
forum for the discussion of the burgeoning and troublesome issue
of domestic violence.  I'm afraid, however, that the publicity
surrounding the case may have made it so important to the
careers and pocketbooks of lawyers, TV reporters, writers,
networks, advertisers, book publishers, and others with a
monetary interest, that the facts of the case have become
secondary to a mad rush for the "all mighty buck".
<P>

During the past five (5)days, ENN has conducted an informal news
poll of approximately one hundred (100) people from across the
country.  A majority of these people work in either an emergency
service agency or for the media. Although not scientific in the
least, and with an accuracy of +/- 50%, this study unequivocally
shows that the American people are really tired of the O.J.
Simpson case and feel that the coverage is being vastly
overdone.  83% said that it wouldn't matter to them if the
coverage of the trial were to end tomorrow.
<P> 

When asked about the importance of the O.J. Simpson trial, many
were heard to exclaim, "who cares?" Others said that were it not
for their occupations that they wouldn't pay any attention to
this story.  Still others questioned the merits of the extensive
coverage.  At least one firefighter wanted to know when the
"Soap Operas" would be back on.  All in all, most said that
there were far more important and pertinent issues that should
be covered by "the press".
<P>  

One California newswriter was even courageous enough to admit
that he didn't feel that the current level of coverage was
journalisticly justified, but that the O.J. trial produced
viewers. The viewers produced ratings. And...the ratings
produced his salary.  Therefore, he concluded, he would cover
the trial twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year, if that was
what his boss decided was important.
<P>  

In closing, an interview with a real television pollster
revealed that it is likely that the networks will experience a
"brief blip" in the ratings because of the exhaustive O.J.
coverage, but that they will then probably also experience a
number of complaints regarding their discontinuance of normal
programming. He concluded by predicting that many Americans,
already tired of the "theatrics" in Los Angeles, would rebel and
there would eventually be a ratings backlash against the
"gavel-to-gavel" coverage.
<P>
                      
We at ENN agree and hope that, somehow, America's professional
newspeople will come to their collective sense and return to the
journalistic ethics that have been the hallmark of popular
literature in the United States.  The current coverage of the
O.J. Simpson trial simply panders to the most purulent interests
of us all. It doesn't contribute to the betterment of society or
to a better understanding of ourselves or the world. We hope it
will be over soon.

<H2>America Held Hostage; Day 365</H2>
<BR>By Clark Staten, ENN Executive Editor
<P>

Chicago, IL, June 12, 1995 -- Monday is the first anniversary of
the Nicole Simpson/Ron Brown slaying.  It has received
recognition and publicity that far exceeds most mass murders of
the 20th century. Most media watchers will admit that the
coverage of this case exceeds the national coverage of that of
the twenty-six (26) people killed by John Wayne Gacy, and maybe
meets or exceeds the coverage afforded to the Hillside strangler
and "Son of Sam" killer combined. Some would even suggest that
the O.J. Simpson trial will soon equal that coverage given to
the Holocaust and the entire Korean War. 
<P> 

While admittedly, the later of these statements may be
facetious...how can this situation exist? How can a simple
murder trial of an former Afro-American football player continue
to lead the news on any number of television channels and some
national newspapers, everyday, for more than a year? What
possible significance can be attached to this trial that would
warrant such extraordinary attention and analysis?  How can our
vested heroes of journalism have become this enamored with the
speculation and the easy sensationalism of the O. J. Simpson
trial?
<P>

While admittedly rhetorical questions, these issues speak
directly to state of the current philosophy and ideology within
some newspapers, television stations, and radio outlets in the
United States.  A far larger and more important question looms;
is the O.J.Simpson trial more important than the situation in
Bosnia, the breakup of the Soviet Union, the suffering in
Rawanda, terrorism in the United States, child abuse, teenage
crime, or any number of other ongoing situations that are
currently occurring?  This author and other knowledgeable
citizens would respectfully suggest that the answer is no...
O.J. is not as important as many of the other issues that are
on-going in the world. Yet, that is the coverage that we see and
hear, all day, everyday, on many our most trusted news outlets.
<P>

One can only hope that the backlash of the general public will,
at some point...occur...and visibly revolt against the easily
covered and extremely profitable sideshow that is the O.J.
Simpson trial.  Then, and only then, do we have any chance of
learning more about the issues that concern the "real world"
outside of that now famous Los Angeles courtroom.

<H2>O.J. Found Innocent; Criminal Justice Suffers?</H2>
<P>
Editorial Opinion
<BR> 
By Clark Staten, ENN Executive Editor
<P>

Chicago, IL, October 3, 1995 -- The months of waiting are over.
The "circus" in Los Angeles has ended with the acquittal of
Oranthal James Simpson. The question remains, however, of who
were the real winners and losers. Obviously, Mr. Simpson was a
winner.  But it is less evident who are the losers. 
<P> 

Shortly after the verdict, Mr. Fred Goldman and the Goldman
family expressed their extreme remorse regarding the verdict.
Mr. Goldman, in a press conference immediately following the
jury announcement, said that "Justice was not served".  The L.A.
County District Attorney's office also says that they do not
feel that the outcome reflects the evidence and that they are
"Profoundly disappointed". And...anger is being expressed,
throughout the country, by seemingly disenfranchised
Caucasian-Americans.
<P>

The primary issue being discussed involves the so called "race
card" that was allegedly played by defense attorney Johnny
Cochran. The focus of concern surrounds the issue that Mr.
Simpson was found innocent because of allegations of racial
discrimination and conspiracy on the part of police officers and
not on the evidence. The issue of "check-book justice", bought
by Mr. Simpson's millions, has also been raised by legal experts
and scholars.
<P>

In a larger sense, some (like Mr. Cochran) will say that it was
the entire criminal justice system that was on trial, not O.J.
Simpson. They maintain that it is inherent racial prejudice in
police departments, DA's offices, and in juries that allegedly
convicts a disproportionate number of African-American
defendants. In the system described by Cochran and others, it is
impossible for a black Americans to be given a fair trial, even
when judged by a jury of their peers. Others will disagree and
point to the Simpson verdict as an example of how the system
actually does provide equal justice.
<P>

On a national basis, it is society as a whole that could suffer
the after-effects of the O.J. Simpson verdict. While black and
other minority Americans may find some solace in the decision,
white majority Americans may feel that they were "short-changed"
by the verdict and lose even more faith in a seemingly
irrational criminal justice system.  Some will undoubtedly lose
faith in the viability of the system as a whole, and a
"white-backlash" may result.
<P>

Realistic concerns continue; the verdict may serve to widen an
already deep division between black and white Americans. As the
debate goes on about affirmative action, quota hiring, and
reverse discrimination, some Americans will undoubtedly view the
O.J. verdict as a case of "unequal treatment" for a black man
accused of killing two white people. Others may feel that he was
acquitted only because he was a black man judged by a
predominately black jury.
<P>

Women's rights advocates and the Brown family are also
reportedly upset about the verdict, although they refused
immediate comment on the verdict.  One woman wearing a NOW
(National Organization of Women) T-shirt, seen outside the
courtroom, reportedly was quoted as saying that the O.J. Simpson
verdict "sends entirely the wrong message about spousal abuse"
and that it could "set back women's rights by ten years".
<P> 

One thing is certain.  The O.J. Simpson trial and acquittal will
fuel debate for many months to come. It may serve to exacerbate
racial tensions, although probably not as much as a O.J.
conviction would have. It may undermine the public confidence in
police officers and their racial attitudes and actions. And, it
will raise serious questions about the very foundations of the
American justice system.  One would hope that this reflection
will serve to bring about positive changes that will lead
America to a point where color or ethnic origin are not a legal
issue, and that the facts of any dispute speak louder than the
racial overtones.

<font size=5><strong>FAA INVESTIGATES SECURITY LAPSES <br>
AT NEWARK INTERNATIONAL</strong></font><br>
By Jim Fay ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent<br>
<br>
NEWARK, NEW JERSEY (ENN) - Following a scathing report by The Record of Hackensack (NJ) newspaper in 
which a reporter easily accessed supposedly secured areas at Newark International Airport, the FAA has begun an 
investigation of that airport's security.<br>
<br>
The Wednesday, September 11th, issue of The Record reported that correspondent Michael Moore easily entered 
baggage areas, observed contract security guards sleeping on post, and, at one point, accessed the ramp, or tarmac, area 
of the airport leaning his foot on one wheel of a parked plane. At no time was he stopped or challenged. It was also found 
that checked luggage for international flights were not being hand-searched or even X-rayed by airline personnel, and that 
the machines for those tasks sat unused in the baggage rooms that the reporter easily accessed.<br>
<br>
Due to the importance of Newark in the NYC hub, and the fact that it is the 13th busiest airport, the Federal Aviation 
Administration reported that they found the lapses in security at Newark &quot;disturbing,&quot; and that a Federal investigation is 
mandated immediately.<br>
<br>
Throughout the newspaper article, there are reports that airline personnel as well as private security guards-ostensibly hired 
to prevent just such activity-took no action or questioned the reporter to find why he had no mandatory identification 
displayed. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, who manages the three New York metropolitan airports, 
including Newark, had no comment on the findings, basically stating that they do not comment on security matters in 
general. The article, however, does not specifically fault the Port Authority Police for any of the security breeches.<br>
<br>
In a follow-up report on Thursday, The Record reported that travel agents have been fielding many phone inquiries from 
fearful passengers who are ticketed to depart from Newark as a result of the Wednesday article.<br>
<br>
It has been well reported that many in the security field have faulted the security hiring practices of the airlines, as well as 
the lack of ability of those hired, as it relates to overall airport security. Many have called for the government take over this 
operation from the airlines, in order to prevent ongoing breeches and to maintain a stable work force in this important 
position.<br>

<H2>THE FURY OVER FEMA, PRESIDENT-ELECT CLINTON'S OPPORTUNITY</H2>
By Paul Anderson, EmergencyNet NEWS Correspondent
<P>

Chicago, IL -  The fury of Hurricane Andrew, Hurricane Iniki,
Hurricane Hugo, the Los Angeles Riots, and the San Francisco
earthquake can not be equaled by the feelings some devastated
disaster victims have towards our nation's lead emergency
management agency.  Pointed criticism and tales of
ineptitude, insensitively, and "foot-dragging" continue to
plague the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and
it's leadership.
<P>

"One of the most basic problems, and most frequent criticisms
of FEMA is that they aren't prepared for those critical
first, few, days after a major disaster occurs", according to
Clark Staten of the Chicago-based Emergency Response &
Research Institute.  "This was particularly true of Hurricane
Andrew, where local emergency response agencies were unable
to provide even the very rudimentary rescue/medical care
services that were required", Staten continued.
"Unfortunately, people seem to have developed an attitude
that FEMA and the U.S. Military can come and `rescue' them
within a moments' notice...when that doesn't happen they are
disappointed, hurt, and angry", the veteran emergency manager
added.
<P>

Staten said that there are several fundemental problems with
both people's expectations and FEMA's capabilities to fulfill
the needs.  "First and foremost, FEMA's legislative mandate,
which gives it the power to act, didn't forsee the necessity
for it to act in a `first responder role' following a
disaster', Staten said.  "Next... FEMA does not have the
appropriately trained personnel to effectively manage an `at-
the-scene' rescue/relief operation; they were trained for a
planning and administrative role which isn't consistent with
the immediate needs of an already overwhelmed community", he
continued.
<P>

"Thirdly, FEMA has been continually criticized for spending
all of their time and money planning for a massive nuclear
exchange, rather than attending to the domestic agenda of on-
going natural and man-made disasters that seem to be occuring
with amazing regularity", the emergency analyst added.
"Fourth, FEMA must come into the `information age', with the
necessary mobile communications and computer resources,
databases, and analysts capable of anticipating and assessing
the logistical and personnel needs of any striken area",
Staten said.
<P>

"Fifth, the agency must hire a core group of experienced and
respected emergency managers from law enforcement, fire
suppression, rescue, emergency medical services, hazardous
materials, and other specialty professions to act as `on-
scene' FEMA coordinators, and if need be, to function in
a `command and control' capacity at a major catastrophe", he
continued.
<P>

"If you'd like...these veteran emergency
responders could be grouped into FEMA  "A" Teams, similar in
concept to that used by the U.S. Army Special Forces...to act
in an advisory capacity unless specifically needed to
undertake an operational role at the scene", Staten said.
Staten also noted that such an organizational change could
also help to dispell a widely-held Congressional belief that
"all FEMA employees are there because of their political
connections, rather than their professional credentials".
<P>

"Lastly", Staten added, "this is a most opportune time for a
major reorganization at FEMA...President-Elect Clinton can be
expected to undertake reforms in the various agencies under
his direct command, and FEMA is one of those agencies".
"President Clinton could `clean house' at FEMA without the
political repercussions that affected President Bush during
a hotly contested campaign, and do so in such a way to
establish FEMA as one of the premier emergency management
agencies in the entire world", Staten concluded.

<title>Deadliest Amtrak Crash Reported</title>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE-EMERGENCYNET NEWS SVC.-09/23/92-0800CDT </p>
<p><font size=6>DEADLIEST TRAIN CRASH IN AMTRAK 
HISTORY KILLS 44 </font></p>
<p>Saraland, AL - The worst train crash in Amtrak history took the lives of at least forty-four (44) people 
early Wednesday morning. The derailment and bridge collapse occurred in a very remote area North of 
Mobile, Alabama near the small town of Saraland, Alabama. The Amtak Sunset Limited reportedly 
plunged into the Connor Creek Bayou at a few minutes after 3:00 a.m. The site of the tragedy is only 
accessible by helicopter or boat. </p>
<p>Although the exact details of the crash are still under intensive investigation, survivors described the 
devastating event as a combination of falling, explosion, fire, and being thrown under water. According 
to witnesses, the train was proceeding normally across the eighty-year-old train bridge when a loud 
noise was heard. They then described a &quot;falling feeling&quot; and heard a large explosion. Within seconds, a 
large orange fireball was seen to engulf the area, presumably as one of the locomotives, propelling the 
train, blew up. Next the lucky survivors found themselves in the water or in a car that was rapidly filling 
with water. The bayou, into which the train plunged, was said to be about twelve (12) feet deep. </p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, heros like Michael Dopheide, 26 year old law school graduate, help dozens of people 
from the submerged cars. Chaos reigned as numerous retired people attempted to escape both the 
flames and water. Passengers helped each other by forming lines and passing people, hand to hand, to 
the shore. Others clung to large pieces of debris in the alligator and snake infested bayou that flows from 
the Mobile river. Aside from penlights and one person's small pocket flashlight, the only light that was 
available to help the rescuers was the burning glow of the Amtrak engine that had exploded. </p>
<p>As the first calls for help went out, it quickly became evident that the Saraland bridge wasn't easily 
accessible by roads; there were none nearby. Rescuers had to access the helicopter and boat. The U.S. 
Coast Guard was alerted, and H-60 helicopters that are normally used for Rescue on the Gulf of 
Mexico were diverted to the rescue effort. Pilots and flight medics said that they were hampered in their 
initial efforts due to the fact that it was extremely dark, the sky surrounding the area was filled with dense 
smoke created by burning diesel oil used by the locomotives, and there was no place to land the 
helicopters. </p>
<p>According to survivors, it may have been as much as forty-five to fifty (45-50) minutes before anyone 
arrived at the scene to begin the rescue efforts. Reportedly, the first units at the incident were the crew 
of a Coast Guard helicopter. Coast Guard Lt. Robin Stearrett was quoted by the Washington Post as 
saying, &quot; There was smoke and fire everywhere . . . one train car was totally underwater . . . it was 
obvious that there were going to be injuries . . . it was devastating . . . it was the most catastrophic 
wreck I have ever seen&quot;. It remains unclear whether the train was on fire prior to entering the water, 
largely because no members of the lead engine train crew have been found alive. </p>
<p>Rescuers were dispatched from several nearby jurisdictions, many bringing boats of various descriptions 
to the scene. A command and control point was reportedly established at the Scott Paper Co. parking 
lot, which was located three miles downstream from the actual crash site. The paper company also 
dispatched two work barges to the site, which were used to act as dive platforms and to store the 
recovered bodies of the deceased. Pictures taken by local television stations showed the bodies of 
several people, lined up on the barges, waiting to be taken to a temporary morgue that was established 
at a nearby local lumber company. A Coast Guard spokesperson said that within thirty (30) minutes of 
activation that the Coast Guard had eight (8) helicopters and six (6) boats enroute to the scene. </p>
<p>Early reports said that there were many survivors, but didn't ascertain the number of fatalities. Helicopter 
crew members described the perilous process of extracting people from the water by wench, in a 
dangerous, dark, and smokey environment. As boats began to arrive on the scene, they said that many 
people were clinging to various objects in the water. Several passengers reportedly assisted others to 
swim to the shore. One survivor described several passengers forming a &quot;human chain&quot; that was passing 
children and elderly to the safety of the shore. </p>
<p>Shortly, it became evident that rescue divers would be needed to enter the cars that were partially or 
totally submerged. Divers were requested from several emergency agencies, and more than twenty soon 
arrived on the scene. Divers that were already working described the work as &quot;tedious and demanding&quot;, 
as they moved foot-by-foot, searching through the murky water that filled the coaches. Everything had 
to be done by touch, due to the fact that the water of the bayou was filled with mud and silt. The divers 
reported finding victims still strapped into their seats, and another trapped in a locked bathroom. They 
also lamented the deaths of children, found frozen in the horrible positions of their deaths. </p>
<p>Soon the Mobile County Sheriff's Flotilla was activated and dozens of volunteer boaters and rescue 
divers began to arrive on the scene. Local fisherman were pressed into service, and soon the crash site 
was surrounded by dozens of boats. Volunteers began to appear on the banks bordering the bayou. 
Seemingly, everyone that heard about the tragedy had come to help. Emergency medical service (EMS) 
personnel and ambulances were dispatched from every nearby community. Reportedly, some 
emergency agencies were delayed in their response, due to the remoteness of the accident site and 
confusion in communications between those on-site and those still responding. </p>
<p>EMT's and Paramedics from the Mobile Fire Department and other agencies described the victims as 
&quot;unbelievably calm&quot;, considering the magnitude of the incident. Numerous reports of passengers helping 
passengers continued to be received. Medics described the passengers as suffering from a variety of 
injuries, including joint, head, neck, and back pains. Others were described as suffering from exposure, 
having spent an extended period in the water. Still others were reportedly dazed and in shock. Some 
patients were also described as having burns and smoke inhalation. Helicopters began ferrying the 
injured to local hospitals. </p>
<p>By 8:00 a.m. and full sunlight, it was obvious that several people were still missing and that there were 
numerous fatalities. The grim task of body recovery began, as most of the living were already 
transported to a number of hospitals. One hundred and thirty seven (137) people were found essentially 
unhurt and loaded on another train that Amtrak brought to a site adjacent to the crash site. Ten (10) 
people, including the crew of the lead locomotive, were still thought to be missing. The search went on 
all day, with hundreds of rescuers and support personnel participating. As the end of the rescue 
occurred, the investigation of the cause began in earnest. </p>

The IPA (International Policewomen's Association) was first organized in 1915 and became a &quot;Depression 
Casuality&quot; during the 30's. In 1956, following a CA Women Peace Officer's meeting in San Diego, IPA was 
reorganized under the tutelage of Dr. Lois Higgins, a Chicago Police officer. The name was also changed to 
reflect a new beginning.<br>
<br>
The IAWP was organized primarily to benefit the women in law enforcement. <br>
<br>
In the 70's, as the membership grew, IAWP started meeting for 5 day training seminars. This year's training will 
be held in Birmingham, England - the first time outside of North America.<br>
<br>
The Association spans the globe with male and female members from almost every country. The membership is 
classified as either Active or Associate Memebers, and with their dues, receive the quarterly magazine 
WomenPolice.<br>
<br>
The IAWP Training Conference for 1997 will be held in Dallas, Texas - November 8 -13. We cordially invite 
all law enforcement to come to &quot;The Big D&quot; for an exciting five days.<br>

<title>What are Syria's Intentions?? 08/30/96</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<p>Excerpted from EmergencyNet News Daily Report<br>
08/30/96 - Vol. 2, No. 243</p>
<p><font size=5><strong>WHAT IS THE INTENTION OF SYRIA?</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
JERUSALEM (ENN) - It was reported that on Wednesday, MK Hagai Merom, the former chairman of the Israeli 
Knesset's Security and Foreign Affairs Committee, said that he had evidence that there are increasing indications that Syria 
is seriously considering the option of war against Israel as a way of ending a diplomatic deadlock. Merom said that he has 
requested a special session of the Knesset to discuss the intelligence assessments concerning relations with Syria.<br>
<br>
Professor Anthony Cordesman, who is a highly-respected chief researcher at the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies in Washington, said that the findings of a new study indicate that there is a possibility that Syria might attempt the 
initiation of a limited war against Israel. Syria may feel that it may be able to achieve its objective if it could obtain a 
strategic surprise and capture a significant portion of the Golan Heights, before a cease-fire was imposed.<br>
<br>
Intelligence sources in Lebanon are reporting that Syria appears to be taking up more defensive positions near the Syrian 
border and have made no threatening deployments of armor or troops towards the direction of Israel.<br>
<br>
So what is everyone up in arms about this week?<br>
<br>
Syrian troops made some unexpected movements and it caused jitters over its military intentions. But on Wednesday, 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a small peace offering toward Syria's President Assad. Netanyahu said 
that Israel has not ruled out negotiating a partial withdrawal from the Golan Heights. The message was sent via a letter that 
was delivered by visiting U.S. Senator Arlen Spector, who is the chairman of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee.<br>
<br>
Spector held a three-hour meeting with Assad. He had some interesting things to say afterward. Assad told Spector that 
the troop movements in Lebanon were just normal maneuvers and concealed &quot;no hostile intent&quot; toward Israel. Spector 
added that the Assad that he met with on Wednesday was more &quot;mellow&quot; than the same man that he had met in 1988.<br>
<br>
What Syria wants is for Israel to return the Golan Heights that was captured in the 1967 Six-Day War. Syria insists that 
Israel agree to a land-for-peace agreement.<br>
<br>
In the past week, concern has focused on the 35,000-man army that Syria maintains in Lebanon. Syrian units were shifted 
from the Beirut area eastward to the Bekaa Valley.<br>
<br>
The U.S. State Department indicated that the Syrian troop movements were &quot;defensive in nature.&quot; Israel had not sent any 
message to the U.S. that they were particularly worried about the movements.<br>
<br>
Even in Chicago, where ENN has monitored this situation very closely, most of ENN's sources and analysts did not 
appear to be alarmed by the situation.<br>
<br>
But whatever Syria's Assad is doing is making analysts scratch their heads. There is no concensus of what the message that 
Assad was trying to deliver. Some analysts said that it was a signal that Syria had considered giving up diplomatic efforts. 
Others said that it was an attempt to pressure Israel into being more flexible in its negotiations.<br>
<br>
ENN contacted a number of military and counterterrorism experts in and out of government to get their assessment of what 
was happening and if Syria could reasonably expect any kind of gain from even thinking about attacking Israel. All of the 
different analysis ENN received was very enlightening.<br>
<br>
Reuven Pedatzur, the director of the Galili Center for Strategic and National Security at Tel Aviv University, said, For 
now, there is no real threat of war. But we have to be careful. Things could get out of hand.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Assad seems to have a lot of maybe misplaced confidence in his forces,&quot; said Clark Staten, the senior analyst and the 
executive director of the Chicago-based Emergency Response and Research Institute. &quot;It is my considered opinion that 
Syria can not be successful by themselves; without the cooperation of other countries in the region. Such an attack would 
ultimately be ill-advised and would result in Syria's defeat.&quot;<br>
<br>
Staten added, &quot;Although they may not be on par with a few years ago, strength and motivation may be down, the IDF is 
still one of the premier military forces in that region. They have the best tactical equipment, command and control systems, 
and access to American surveillance satellites and intelligence gathering capabilites. Syria, like Iraq, could be quickly and 
easily &quot;blinded&quot; by aircraft sorties to destroy their rudimentary command nets and radar facilities.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Golan area is fortified by the Israelis, who are well dug in and reserves in place. Beyond the forts are the armed 
kibbutzes,&quot; said Paul Copher, analyst-at-large and a counterterrorism expert. &quot;From the rear operating fields, the IDF 
warplanes would take five minutes to respond. The whole area is mined in a strip by the IDF and old Syrian mine fields still 
kill goats and sheep.&quot;<br>
<br>
According to Copher, &quot;The strategic gain for Assad are the old Golan lines, but their troops would barely get settled in 
before a IDF massive cannon and air attack hits them. I could see a massive build up on their side of the hills as a threat, 
but the IDF would do the same.&quot;<br>
<br>
Copher concluded with some information that could make other analysts stand up and take notice. He said, &quot;Assad is 
going overboard according to a Syrian who just returned from a visit. He noted a massive propaganda campaign and the 
&quot;armed camp&quot; mentality. Rockets are alleged to be ready around the major cities for ground-to-air protection. Larger 
rockets are in camo positions in rural areas. The people are finding it hard to get enough food. The money has devalued so 
much this naturalized citizen has to send dollars to Damascus so his relatives can buy sheep on the bayrams.&quot;<br>

<p>10/01/96 TUE 19:34 <br>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: October 1, 1996 <br>
</p>
<p><font size=5><strong>Explosives-Detecting Dogs Begin Airport Patrols<br>
</strong></font><br>
Port Authority Executive Director George J. Marlin today announced that bomb-sniffing dogs have begun patrolling the 
region's three major airports, as part of the comprehensive 10-point security initiative announced recently by the agency. 
At 2 P.M. today the dogs, accompanied by specially trained handlers and Port Authority Police officers, began checks of 
passenger terminals and cargo areas. In addition to random checks, the dogs will be an call to check suspicions luggage 
and cargo at John P. Kennedy International, Newark International and La Guardia airports.<br>
<br>
&quot;Working with our partners at the airlines and the FAA, we are committed to a security program that includes constant 
reviews and upgrades,&quot; Mr. Marlin said. &quot;Rather than wait for our own detection teams to come into service in a few 
months, we're bringing in fully qualified outside contractors to provide this protection on interim basis. Deputy Executive 
Director John J. Haley, Jr., said, &quot;This is an in immediate and important step, one that we can do quickly. But we will soon 
have in place an expanded program, which will be an important part of cur overall 10-point initiative. We are determined 
that the Port Authority will continue to play a leadership role in providing security.&quot;<br>
<br>
In order to put Bomb-sniffing dogs into service immediately, the Port Authority contracted with an FAA-certified outside 
firm on an interim basis. In coming weeks, the Port Authority will acquire and train its own explosives-sniffing dogs, and 
Port Authority Police officers will be trained and certified by the FAA as handlers. The deployment of the 
explosives-detection squads is one of 10 major security initiatives for the airports announced by Mr. Marlin on September 
16. <br>
<br>
The other measures include: <br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Expand current Port Authority security auditing; <br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Crack down on frequent violators of airport security procedures; <br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Install new physical security measures; <br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Require that all airline contractor personnel involved in security obtain Port Authority-issued identification cards and 
undergo, as a minimum, a 10-year employment history check; <br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Increase to quarterly the annual review by Port Authority police of the 24-point air cargo security program; <br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Require that contractor construction personnel in aeronautical areas have Port Authority Id: * advocate stricter minimum 
training and qualification standards for airline security personnel, and provide refresher training in security for all airport 
staff; <br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Increase the frequency and level of airport-wide security meetings; and <br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Accelerate Port Authority involvement in research and development of technology-based security measures.<br>

<BR><B>**LEAD STORY**</B>
<H3>NOBODY EVER SAID MOST CRIMINALS WERE SMART...</H3>
<BR>
By Steve Macko
<P>
Many films that come out of Hollywood like to portray their villians
as smart, conniving and intellectual.  The truth of the matter, according
to author Leland Gregory, "That's all fiction.  The truth is a guy gets
drunk, tries to steal a TV and gets his foot caught in an air vent."
Gregory has recently co-authored a book with Alan Ray and Daniel Butler,
called, "America's Dumbest Criminals."  The book is published by
Rutledge Hill Press.
<P>

Some of the stories are truly amusing.  Among some of the funnier
examples is:
<P>
-- An armed robber in Nevada who allowed a convenience store clerk
one phone call during the course of the hold-up.  The robber was
quite surprised when the police came to the store.
<P>
-- A man was convicted and sentenced to 90 days in a Rhode Island
prison.  He hated being in prison so much that he spent 88 of those
days devising an escape plan.  On day 89 he escaped from the prison.
A few months later, authorities recaptured him and he was sentenced
to a year-and-a-half for escape.
<P>
-- Rhode Island must have some interesting criminals.  In another
story from that state -- a man was arrested for breaking into vending
machines and stealing the money from them.  His reason for his crime
was so that he could pay his $400 bail all in quarters.
<P>
-- A thief whose modus operandi was to smash the windows of jewelry
stores and then grab whatever valuables he could, came upon a surprise
one night.  One jewelry store that he had previously stole from had
replaced its windows with unbreakable plexiglass.  When the man came
back to rob the store window again -- he threw a cinder block at the
window, the cinder block bounced off the plexiglass and knocked him
out cold when it hit him in the head.  The incident is reportedly on
video tape.
<P>
-- Another man, this one in Tennessee, came up with a very intricate
plot that sounds like something a fiction writer would had dreamed up.
This man planned to blow up the Percy Priest Dam, which is located near
Nashville and flood the entire city.  He then thought that with the
city submerged under water, all he had to do was don some scuba gear
and he could dive for his riches.  Just because he had never went
scuba diving before did not stop this man from his plot.  Before being
caught, he had managed to explode some dynamite near the dam.  His
blast was only able to knock down a door of an old wooden shed located
near the top of the dam.
<P>
And before this article comes to an end, this author would like to
relate one of his favorite humorous episodes that shows the average
intelligence of many criminals.  Each year, the FBI is able to capture
about 20 bank robbers because the robbers write their demand notes, that 
they hand to the bank tellers ... on the back of their own printed deposit 
slips that have their name and address on it.

During the early summer of this year, officers of the Connecticut State
Police seized 18 bags of a green leafy substance that was identified as
ILLY.  ILLY is reported to be a mixture of marijuana and/or mint leaves
that are usually soaked in formaldehyde and PCP (Angel Dust).  ILLY
reportedly causes dizziness, nausea, hallucinations and even death.
The State Troopers who handled the evidence developed a light-headed
feeling and nausea.  They felt the effects from the substance for at
least two days.  This substance is usually kept frozen until the time
of sale.  Once the substance begins to thaw, it emits a strong chemical
odor that has a strong negative effect on people.  EXTREME CAUTION
should be exercised if you suspect that you are dealing with this
substance.  Officers are advised to avoid handling, inhaling or allowing
it to come in contact with their skin.

Two seamen from the Baltic country of Latvia were shot and killed and
one other seaman was wounded in an apparent terrorist attack in Algiers
on Thursday morning.  Witnesses said that four armed men attacked the 
Latvians as they were walking on a city street.  Algerian security
believes that Moslem militants are responsible for the attack.

Authorities in Belfast, Northern Ireland, reported that they found
two suspected bombs on Wednesday, the day before President Clinton's
visit to the city.  One of the devices was found about 600 yards from
the Europa Hotel, where Clinton will be staying during his visit.  This
suspected bomb was blown up by explosive experts.  Police said that it
was crudely made and was bound in tape.
<P>

The second bomb was found about a mile away from the first one.  The
bomb squad was sent to the scene to investigate.  There has been no
claim for the devices and security officials are treating the incident
as serious because of Clinton's visit.

<H4>EGYPT SECURITY THREATS OUTSIDE THE NATION</H4>
<BR>
   LAURIE KASSMAN

   MALAWI, EGYPT
<P>
Egypt is facing more security threats outside its own borders,
but the government insists its crackdown at home against Muslim
extremists is curbing violence. Most of the confrontations are
concentrated in the southern provinces of Minya and Assiut, about
250-kilometers south of the capital.
<P>
In some respects life appears unchanged for centuries in
Malawi, nestled along the banks of the Nile in the shade of palm
trees and sugar cane fields. Water buffalo stand idly by as women
in brightly-colored scarves wash pots, pans, clothes, and babies
in the Nile.
<P>
In town, donkey carts kick up dust as they jostle with cars
and pedestrians on their way to market with onions, beans, and
sugar cane from their nearby farms.
<P>
But the sounds of normalcy are interrupted by piercing sirens
as soldiers and police patrol the town and outlying roads.
Visitors passing through a security checkpoint on the southern
outskirts of Malawi find themselves immediately under army
escort. The police wear bullet-proof vests over black T-shirts
and tote automatic rifles. They are taking no chances.
<P>
More than 900 deaths have been blamed on extremist violence in
the past three-years as Muslim militants fight to set up a strict
Islamic state here. Residents here confide family feuds and armed
burglaries also account for many of the local killings.
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak says the tough crackdown is curbing
terrorism. Analysts suggest that success is forcing the militants
to take their violence outside. Last May, President Mubarak
escaped an assassination attempt in Addis Ababa. This month,
militants murdered an Egyptian diplomat in Geneva and blew up the
embassy in Islamabad.
<P>
A local representative of the Egyptian human rights group,
Fathalla Khafagy, says the situation in Malawi, and elsewhere in
southern Egypt, is calmer than a year ago when people were rarely
seen on the street after dark. Others say the evening curfew that
starts at nine is useless because violence can erupt at any time.
<P>
Mr. Khafagy stresses government force and curfews are not the
answer.  He says, poverty breeds terrorism. Farm land is limited, and
there is too much poverty and too little investment for alternative
projects. Mr Khafagy says the government spends less than seven-
percent of its budget on the south. He says he is less sure about the 
extremist religious views of suspected militants than of their frustrations.
<P>
Amal Rashed is a tiny, sharp-tongued widow in Malawi who is
running for parliament for the opposition El Wafd party. She
defends the security crackdown but also blames corrupt business
and inept administrations for breeding terrorists.  She says putting 
innocent people in jail is also terrorism and so is selling spoiled seeds to 
poor farmers.
<P>
A young salesman in Minya says his business suffers from the
checkpoints and the curfew. Villagers do not move around much any
more, they are afraid of being picked up by police for
interrogation.
<P>
Militants hide in the tall, thick sugar cane fields dominating
the countryside around Malawi and ambush road patrols and tourist
trains. In a new surge of violence this month, militants attacked
three tourist trains in the south. The government has responded
by mowing down the cane fields and sometimes bulldozing houses of
suspected militants.
<P>
A lawyer in the southern university town of Assiut says the
government campaign has produced a deceptive calm. But he does
not expect the low-grade violence to end because, as he puts it,
amputation is not the solution. He says, as long as there is
poverty and no hope for improvement, the south remains a fertile
breeding ground for unrest.

<BR>
A passenger train was raked with gunfire on Wednesday night in southern
Egypt.  Nine people were reported wounded and several train cars were
damaged.  The attack happened near the southern Egyptian town of Malawi,
which is located about 160 miles south of Cairo.  The train was traveling
from Cairo to the city of Aswan.  This was the fourth such attack on a
passenger train in Egypt this month.  Muslim militants are the prime
suspects in the attack.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>Isreal...</H4>
<BR>
Three items of interest come to ENN from the Shomron News Service in
Isreal -- property damage resulting from Tuesday's Hizbollah rocket
attacks on northern Isreal is estimated to have caused about $3.3 million
of damage.  Forty dwellings were either destroyed or severely damaged
and 15 vehicles were destroyed.
<P>
The terrorist organization Hizbollah is reportedly funded with Iranian
money and functions with the permission of the Syrian government.  
Hizbollah enjoys a budget of between $80 to $90 million annually.  The
criminal-state of Iran also supplies Hizbollah terrorists with weapons
which are acquired through Syrian channels.  It is estimated that
Hizbollah has about 600 guerrillas who conduct such operations as
Tuesday's rocket attacks.  There are also estimated to be another 200
Muslim guerrillas who are responsible for laying roadside bombs.
<P>
Isreali police arrested two terrorists who are reportedly members of
of the Islamic terrorist group Hamas.  The terrorists were said to had
been on their way to steal weapons from two villages in southwest Isreal.
After a high-speed chase, police searched the two suspects and found
documents detailing the location of the sought-after weapons.  The
terrorists admitted intending to use the stolen weapons to shoot
passerbys on a nearby highway.  One of the terrorists had been sought
by police for involvement in the murder of a soldier several years ago.
<P>
In other news from Isreal ... Two Isreali border policemen are safe
after being kidnapped by five Palestinian gunmen on Wednesday night.
The two hostages were freed after Isreali Prime Minister Shimon Peres
and PLO chief Yassar Arafat interceded in negotiations on their behalf.
The tense hostage drama lasted about three hours and was said to be the
first real test of Isreali-PLO cooperation.
<P>
The drama began at about 8:00 p.m. on Wednesday when six Isreali
plainclothes agents drove a van into the West Bank village of Qabatiya.
There, they spotted the leader of the small Palestianian Black Panther
terrorist group, Samir Zakarneh.  Zakarneh was on Isreal's Most Wanted
List.  When Zakarneh spotted the Isreali agents, he fled into a nearby
coffee shop that had about 30 patrons inside.  A tense hostage drama
ensued.  Additional Isreali personnel responded to the scene.  When
the suspect refused to surrender to Isreali authorities, IDF personnel
threw one stun grenade into the coffee shop and another into a crowd of
several angry Palestianian villagers.
<P>
While the Qabatiya standoff continued, at about 10:00 p.m. co-horts of
Zakarneh kidnapped two Isreali border policemen who were outside a
police station in the town of Jenin.  The two Isreali hostages were
taken to a nearby Palestinian refugee camp and were ordered to call
the IDF and demand that the Isrealis let Zakarneh go and withdraw
from the village.  After three hours of negotiations, in which Peres
and Arafat oversaw, the two Isreali hostages were released and
Zakarneh was handed over to Palestinian police.  The five kidnappers
were also arrested by PLO police.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>Lebanon...</H4>
<BR>
Moslem terrorist guerrillas shelled an IDF outpost in south Lebanon
on Thursday.  Two Isreali soldiers were reported to had been wounded.
The guerrillas attacked the outpost, located in the central sector of 
the security zone, with mortar fire.
<P>
A few hours later, the IDF retaliated to the mortar attack when four
Isreali warplanes fired eight rockets into hills that are used by
pro-Iranian Hizbollah terrorist guerrillas.

<H4>NATO PLANNERS WORK ON BOSNIA OPERATION</H4>
<BR>
   JOHN FRASER
<BR>
   BRUSSELS
<BR>
NATO planners are working on the alliance's most ambitions
operation to date, securing the peace in Bosnia. If all proceeds
smoothly, a 60,000 member NATO force could be in place by
Christmas.
<P>
Several political moves must take place before the NATO
operation can begin.  The agreement reached Tuesday must be 
confirmed and ratified by all the parties involved, and Bosnian Serb 
reservations need to be overcome. President Clinton needs to settle 
his disagreements with Congress about U.S. participation in the
operation.
<P>
With the United States providing a third of the force of
60-thousand, European allies have made it clear that the
operation cannot easily proceed without the United States. And
finally, NATO will need an international invitation, issued by
the United Nations, before it agrees to go ahead.
<P>
However, the assumption is that all these hurdles can be
overcome. So alliance military planners are hard at work
preparing for the most daunting challenge in NATO history.
<P>
Already, communications systems have been set up, and a team
of two-thousand planners is moving into Bosnia to work on
logistics. The alliance is in close touch with non-NATO nations,
particularly Russia, which also will be involved in the Bosnian
operation. Political command procedures will have to be worked
out with Moscow, although there has been a recent breakthrough in
agreeing on the military arrangements.
<P>
Details of the operation will be discussed by NATO defense
ministers, who meet next week in Brussels. In London early in
December there will then be a conference of the 40 nations that
will be involved in the Bosnian operation.
<P>
Most of the forces for the new operation will have to be sent
into Bosnia, although some will undertake logistics duties from
bases in Croatia. Meanwhile, some of the forces already there,
who have been helping with the humanitarian operations, will stay
on. They will be transferred from United Nations to NATO command.
<P>
The aim of the Bosnian mission is simple, to ensure a smooth
transition to peace, and to assist with the setting up of the new
Bosnian state. This will be a unified entity, with two
sub-divisions. Part of the territory goes to the Serbs, with the
rest falling under Muslim and Croat authority.
<P>
There will be a central government structure, based in
Sarajevo, and it is hoped that elections can be held as soon as
is practicable. NATO is planning to deploy its forces in Bosnia
for one year, after which it is hoped the country will have been
returned to comparative normality.
<P>
In the meantime, NATO troops will secure the frontiers between
the two sections of the new Bosnia, and try to ensure that
disagreements do not escalate into conflict. It is a mammoth
task, which will provide an answer to the question which was
asked at the end of the cold war, does NATO still have a role in
the new world order, now that its former enemies have become its
friends.
<P>
Inside NATO, there is no doubt of the challenges ahead, and
that if why the search for a new secretary general for the
alliance has taken on new urgency. That post has been vacant
since the resignation of previous incumbent Willy Claes, who was
forced to leave after the Belgian parliament voted that he could
be indicted on corruption charges.
<P>
So far, European members of NATO have not been able to agree
with the Americans on a choice of secretary general. NATO
officials hope the challenges lying ahead in Bosnia will lead to
greater convergence of views among the allies.

Officials at the Pentagon have voiced concern about several hundred
non-Bosnian Muslim fighters who are apparently based near Tuzla, where
troops from the United States will be based.  The Pentagon regards
these Muslim fighters as "hard-core terrorists."  Intelligence estimates
that there are "a couple thousand" of these terrorists in Bosnia that
have come from Algeria, Iran, Libya and Pakistan.  These terrorists
have fought against Serbs.
<P>
The military officials are concerned about the threat that is posed by
groups of religious zealots, as well as other hazards such as: rouge
paramilitary groups (mercenaries), land mines, bad roads and weather.

<H2>THE NEW ALAMEDA COUNTY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER...</H2>
<BR>
By Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor
<P>

The new Alameda County, California, Emergency Operations
Center went in service last week in Dublin, California.
This new high-tech disaster clearinghouse will have to
wait for an incident of some type to see how well it will
work.  The new center will be the command center for
incidents from earthquakes and wildfires to floods and
major hazardous materials situations.  Emergency officials
will oversee the incidents from this new $7.9 million,
25,000 square foot center.
<P>

The old Alameda County Office of Emergency Services was in
San Leandro.  The old office was in a bunker-type, windowless
building that was located right over an earthquake fault line.
The new EOC is located right next door to the Santa Rita Jail.
The senior emergency services coordinator of the center said,
"We're no longer 300 yards from a fault, but now we're next to
3,000 known felons.  But at least they're behind bars."
<P>

At the opening ceremony that was held last week, officials from
Alameda County dedicated the new building in honor of Oakland
Fire Department Battalion Chief James Riley, Jr. and Oakland
Police Officer John Grubensky.  Both Riley and Grubensky died
in 1991 while trying to save people from the East Bay Hills fire.
<P>

The new center is designed to withstand a magnitude 8.3 earthquake.
It has two emergency power generators and a backup water supply.
Inside the building, emergency workers will work at an array of
computer stations, large data screens and map displays.  Every
emergency vehicle can be tracked by a computerized map that shows
where they have been dispatched.  The building has telephone, radio
and satellite communications capabilities.
<P>

Each room in the center has been given a name and has a designated
purpose.  Some of the rooms include: the Incident Command Center,
Tactical Dispatch, and the Situation Room.
<P>

The State of California has been making an effort to streamline
disaster preparedness operations.  In Alameda County even though
there may not be an emergency situaton to be handled everday, the
new EOC will not remain quiet.  Everday there will be about 12
people in the center working on drafting contingency plans.
<P>

When an emergency strikes, about 150 people are expected to
converge on the center and they will coordinate response and
recovery efforts with local, state and federal agencies.
<P>

The new Alameda County Emergency Operations Center will also
coordinate all law enforcement mutual aid requests for a
16-county area in northern California, from Monterey to the
Oregon border.

<center><H2>EMERGENCY SERVICE TECHNOLOGY</H2>

                <B>By Clark Staten, CEO, Emergency Response & Research Institute</B></center>
<P>
The 90's have been described by some as the "Information
Age".  Undoubtedly, the events of the past decade have
changed the way in which we record, transfer, store,
retrieve, and evaluate information.  In large part, the
advent of the personal computer (PC) has drastically affected
the way we perceive and utilize information. It's
introduction has opened new possibilities for personal,
professional, and organizational growth and development.
<P>

During the past ten years, vast strides have been made
in regard to emergency service administration and operations.
More enlightened members of the emergency response community
have discovered that there are many more effective and
efficient ways to direct and analyze our function.  Many
forward-thinking emergency managers have adopted methods and
practices developed in the private sector and created hybrid
models for use in Fire, Police, and EMS departments.
<P>

In order to better understand the advances that have been
made, and to explore the applications of the future, we need
to review the history and capabilities of personal computers.
In this retrospection, let's move backward in time and
examine the technology and how it has changed the emergency
services.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>THE 1970's AND BEFORE (THE PAST):</H4>

One of the first computers was called ENIAC; it weighed
thirty (30) tons, was two stories high, and covered more than
fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet of space. It was built
and went into operation in 1946. It did amazing things for
it's time.
<P>

It is probably not commonly known that the International
Business Machine (IBM) Company did not introduce a desk-top
personal computer until 1981.  Several other desk-top
computers had, however, been introduced by various other
companies in the late 70's. Names that come to mind were
Osborne, Apple, Tandy, Kaypro, Xerox, Victor, and Morrow.
The late 1970's and early 1980s were a turbulent time in the
development of PC's, as various manufacturers attempted to
transfer known technology from "Mainframes" to small computer
platforms.
<P>

The early PC's were vastly underpowered and slow, by today's
standards.  Many did not have hard disk drives, and other
stored data on "cassette-type" tape drives. Extended and
expanded memory were still a dream. Many small platforms
actually had less than 640K of RAM (Random Access Memory),
and yet users were amazed about the way that the 8086 and
8088 CPU (Central Processing Unit) machines performed (e.g.
forerunners to 80286, 80386, 80486 central processors of the
80's & 90's).  Color monitors were not in use and no one had
ever heard of a "Mouse" pointing device.
<P>


Early users were thrilled that the "micro-computer" was
finally on their desk. They no longer had to access or learn
mainframe operating systems.  They suddenly could control the
input and output of data, rather than depending on a
"computer specialist" in some other agency or department. The
"personal computer (PC) revolution" had begun.
<P>

Early emergency service applications of computer power were
primarily run on large mainframe type machines and were
generally limited to personnel and inventory records.  The
advent of PC's changed the uses of computers in several areas
of emergency operations.  The earliest transferences of work
probably occured in the administrative areas of police and
fire departments. As in private industry, emergency service
secretaries and record keepers quickly saw the capability and
suitability of personal computers for inputting, storing, and
retrieving of temporary data.
<P>

Another important task that was developed for the emergency
computers was that of computer-aided-dispatching (C.A.D) of
emergency equipment.  So called "system status management"
programs were developed that helped managers/dispatchers to
effectively allocate resources, based on availability and
public demand.  Most were data "input-intensive" and required
dispatchers to spend a great deal of time keypunching
information into the database.
<P>

Communication, in general, were changed by digital and "chip"
technology.  Radio frequencies could be then be synthesized
rather than crystal controlled.  This ability caused far
greater latitude and control of frequency changing
capabilities and allowed radios to be smaller and have more
features.  With digital chip technology, a hand-held
transciever or scanner could listen or transmit on as many as
one-hundred frequencies.
<P>

All in all, the 1970's and early 80's saw tremendous advances
in both technology and the use of it.  However, it should be
noted that during the 70's and early 80's, many emergency
response agencies and personnel didn't avail themselves of
the advances in computer technology.  Whether it was the
complexity of the process, or the mindset of the emergency
community; most did not develop the skills or buy the
equipment needed to apply the benefits of the vast technical
advances that had taken place.
<P>

Unfortunately, all too many departments were mired in the
traditions and practices of the past. Veteran fire and police
officials did not understand the technology or it's uses. It
was, therefore, easier to cling to the file cabinets,
telegraph keys, and paperwork of the past than to accept the
computer technology and young "technocrats" of the future.
<P>
<HR>

<H4>The 1980's & 90's (THE PRESENT):</H4>


Remember ENIAC from the past (see Pg.1)?  It is interesting
to note that the fact that a 1990's model laptop 386/33Mz IBM
Clone can add, subtract, and perform math functions at least
fifty times faster than the earlier, gigantic, ENIAC.
Current hardware is so sophisticated that it can cause
millions of instructions to be instantaneously passed to
various components within the computer in a matter of
seconds.
<P>

At the risk of being accused of using a cliche' of today, the
1980's and 1990's have been "awesome" in terms of technical
advances in personal computer technology.  Probably, no one
decade in history saw more or greater changes in our
capability to develop and manage information than did the
last one.
<P>

The desk-top computing machines became smaller, lighter,
faster, and more graphically capable. The intricate DOS (Disk
Operating System)  command line systems of the past were
replaced with various kinds of GUI's (Graphic User
Interfaces....with MicroSoft's Windows being a typical
example. Various kinds of "mouse" pointing devices became
part of our computer vernacular. Computer Central Processing
Units (CPUs) have come from a speed of 4.77MHz in the late
70's to 50MHz in some early 1990's models (X10 increase in
speed).
<P>

Advancements in computer software have kept pace with the
development of hardware. New and complex software has been
developed that will allow users to easily perform accounting,
word processing, desk-top publishing, graphics, computer-
aided-design, and many other functions.  Demographics,
population shifts, inventory control, equipment use data,
nter-active training, and other types of analysis programs
are benefiting the manager of today.  By combining faster
hardware with more sophisticated software, greater
productivity has been demonstrated.  Business and government
have began to sit-up and take notice.
<P>

The emergency services have also benefited from this surge in
the advancement of technology. Computer work terminals have
been placed on Local Area Networks (LANS) in many
fire/police/ems stations.  Municipal response records are now
frequently kept by entering data at the station terminal or
even from a mobile terminal in a vehicle.  Several police
agencies have mobile cellular or radio links directly from a
car to the NCIC (National Crime Information Center) or state
computer mainframe system.
<P>

This networking arrangement the police with almost
instantaneous information on "wants and warrants", as well as
providing a "rap sheet" of past offfense for the person
entered into the system.  A similar setup also allows
paramedics to keep Mobile Intensive Care Reports, and
firefighters to keep NFIRS (National Fire Information Report
system).
<P>

Many emergency communication centers and hazardous materials
units are reported to be carrying cellular technology and on-
board computers that allow access to;  water grid maps,
addresses, phone numbers, chemical databases, MSDS sheet
programs, occupancy databases, fire safety inspections and
building preplans.  Almost any database that can be accessed
on a telephone land-line can be used, directly from the
scene.  This provides incident commanders with a vast amount
of available information upon which to make better decisions.
<P>

Computer technology has also enabled the development of
cellular telephone technology.  Mobile telephones and pagers
have had a tremendous impact on business and emergency
response agencies. Current chip configurations for hand-held
portable telephones make them light weight enough to be taken
almost anywhere....including the scene of an emergency. With
the added reliability and country-wide accessibility of these
"tiny" transceivers, and the launching of several "SAT-COM"
satellites, it would appear possible to communicate with
anyone....anywhere.
<P>

Many emergency dispatch centers have installed computer work
stations for each dispatcher.  These work stations expidite
and assist the decision-making process and maintain an
ongoing list of available resources.  In more sophisticated
systems, Loran-C radio locaters uses satellite triangulation
technology to locate vehicles and radio transmitters to
within 100 ft. of their actual location on a computer
generated city grid map. Personnel emergencies are
immediately reported with the touch of a button, as well as
the location of the distress signal.
<P>

More advanced systems also record and maintain a history of a
given address/location for future reference. This history
keeping capability provides a list of past occurances at a
specific location. It could also be used to store and
catagorize patients, past medical conditions, and
medications.  A criminal history of an individual or location
could also be stored and generated.  Many municipalities have
found the practicality  of sharing information between
emergency agencies and several have joint communications
centers that can access the same databases. Computer-Aided-
Dispatch of the past has grown up.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>THE FUTURE:</H4>

Future developments in the use of computers stagger the
imagination. Someday soon, we will probably see computer
terminals in the front of most Police, Fire, and EMS
vehicles. These terminals will direct us to the scene of the
emergency with digitalized street maps. The terminal will
provide information about any incident that has occured at
the location previously.  It will give us pre-plans for
hazardous materials or other dangerous situations.  The
terminal will generate response time and other pertinent
reports that will track our progress and efficiency.
<P>

On-Board our "vehicles of the future" we will have computer
controlled communication units with radio repeater
capabilities. Each crew member will wear a comfortable,
lightweight headset that will enable communication (Comm-Link)with each
other, other agencies, the dispatch center, the hospital, the city computer,
a voice mail, and record keeping system. The radio systems
will be multi-tasked and trunked, so that any department can
communicate with any other... instantaneously.
<P>

Medical records will be obtained and stored by simply saying,
"Computer....Recorder on!".  The computer will then
constantly monitor Electrocardiogram reading, drug drips, and
record any and all findings that the medics note. Further
miniaturization will allow blood gas analysis and other blood
studies to be done at the scene and almost instantly.
Treatment protocals will be immediately available, either by
radio link to a physician or direcrted by a computer library
with an artificial intelligence "expert system".
<P>

Computerization of "CAT-SCAN" type equipment, using sound
waves or other electronic phenomena will give detailed
analysis of the body and facilitate appropriate trauma and
medical emergency treatment. Patient assessment data that is
being gathered and recorded by the on-board vehicle computer
will be instantly reviewable by the hospital that is going to
recieve the patient.  Diversions of ambulances will be
computer determined and will automatically take into
consideration the patient load and capability of each
receiving facility.
<P>

Identification of an unidentified criminals will be
accomplished by matching an "on-scene" computer generated
video image of the suspect and database records of all known
or suspected perpetrators. Fingerprints will also be obtained
and matched by computer to verify an identification process.
A complete history of the criminal, his methods of operation
(M.O.), and current suspicions will be compared by the
computer and analysis given to the police investigator for
his/her action.  Comparison "mug-shots" will be computer
drawn at the scene and witnesses will then be able to
identify any matching suspects in a timely manner.
<P>

Known criminals or mental patients that are "on-the-streets"
could be electronically tagged with a emitter that could
automatically be tracked by a computer.  Electronic release
programs could be expanded to include almost all non-violent
offenders with the aid of computer surveillance. A computer
record would constantly be recorded of the movement of these
monitored individuals, and could be immediately reviewed in
the event of suspicion. 
<P> 

Security computers could automatically note any unusual movement or action on the part
of any convicted criminal and activate an police alarm mode
that would direct him/her to be detained by the nearest
police unit or, (if necessary to prevent a violent act),
"shocked and disabled" by a built-in "taser-type" device.
While civil libertarians might balk at such a system, repeat
offenses and offenders could become a thing of the past.
<P>

The same sort of locater devices could be used to insure
firefighter/rescuer safety. A computer tracking device could
identify an individual or unit at the scene of a large
emergency and provide an ongoing monitoring of their location
and consciousness. If the rescuer were to become
incapacitated, or didn't move for a predetermined amount of
time, an alarm would sound at the command post. This alarm
could also be activated by pushing a portable radio button,
or activating an emergency beacon manually.  If radio contact
could not be established, a search of the last known location
of the individual could be undertaken immediately.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>CONCLUSIONS:</H4>

The effective uses of computers in the emergency services
environment have just begun to be realized.  Undoubtedly,
many more applications and capabilities will be discovered
and exploited during the coming years.  Computer experts
predict that many of the author's "predictions of the future"
are closer than many of us might realize.  Many, if not most
of these ideas, can be expected to come into being (in some
form) during the career of today's "rookie" police officer,
firefighter, or EMT.
<P>

The capability and practicality of the emergency service
computers of tommorow will be determined by the needs that
are identified and developed.... today. It would appear to be
the responsibility of those emergency responders that have
some expertise or ability in this area to foster and
facilitate the effective use of our future computer
resources.
<P>

Without the imput and guidance of the "computer pioneers" of
today, we can not achieve the maximum benefit for the
emergency responders and citizens of tommorow.  With that
devotion and participation..... many lives can be saved, our
jobs can be performed more effectively, and our world can
become a happier, healthier, and safer place.

<br>
<font size=5><strong>Iraqi Incursion into Kurdish Area Sounds Alarms</strong></font></p>
<p>WASHINGTON (ENN) - As if we didn't have enough troubled spots to monitor, the United States State Department 
said on Thursday that the situation in Iraq is being closely monitored to see if any hostile intentions were in the offering 
between Iraq and Iran. Iranian troops recently have been making border crossings into Iraq in support of the Kurdish 
regions located in northern Iraq.<br>
<br>
There are reports of an Iraqi troop build-up near the northern town of Arbil. State Department deputy spokesman Glyn 
Davies said, &quot;Obviously, we continue to watch that part of the world very closely and we would take seriously any moves 
that were seen as aggressive. &quot;The State Department has been saying in recent weeks that the rogue state of Iran has no 
business in Iraq and its help to the Kurds is not wanted, warranted or needed.<br>
<br>
Earlier on Thursday, Iraq accused Iran of military aggression and said that it reserved the right to retaliate for Tehran's 
deployment of troops into the Kurdish-populated areas of northern Iraq. Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed 
al-Sahaf said, &quot;Iran, in its pursuit of such stupid aggressive policy, would be digging its grave with its own hands, creating a 
dangerous precendent that will backfire on it.&quot; The Kurdistan Democratic Party said that Iran sent its troops into northern 
Iraq to support the guerrillas of a rival group known as the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.<br>
<br>
Iraq and Iran fought an eight year war during the 1980s in which one side, the Iraqis, used World War I trench tactics and 
the Iranians relied upon Zulu human wave attacks reminiscent of the Boer War at the turn of the century.</p>

<p>ENN 8/31/96 08:22<br>
<br>
<font size=5><strong>Iraq Update; U.S. Forces Plan For Contingencies</strong></font></p>
<p>WASHINGTON (ENN) - Iraq ordered its troops to crush Iranian- backed separatists in the northern part of its country 
on Saturday. Tariq Aziz, the former Iraqi foreign minister and now the deputy prime minister, said the Iraqi forces were 
involved in a &quot;limited military operation&quot; and it was in response to an appeal by the Kurdistan Democratic Party.<br>
<br>
This Iraqi intervention threatens to ignite a new confrontation between Iraq and the allied forces that have policed the 
region since the end of the 1991 Gulf War. It is also heightening tensions with Iran, which fought an eight-year war with 
Iraq from 1980 to 1988.<br>
<br>
The Iranian-backed Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said that Iraqi forces launched a massive tank-led offensive on 
Saturday on the city of Ibril. PUK fighters were said to be resisting, but the Iraqi troops had reached the outskirts of the 
city. The PUK, though backed by Iran, was appealing for help from the Western coalition forces. The PUK reported 
&quot;scores of civilian casualties.&quot; There are said to be 3.5 million Iraqi Kurds who are seeking independence from Iraq.<br>
<br>
The attack was started by the Iraqis at 5:00 a.m. on Saturday morning (2100 EDT Friday). Heavy artillery was said to 
have pounded Ibril and other areas. More than 450 Iraqi tanks were said to be amassed in eastern Kurdistan. Iraqi 
spokesperson Aziz said, &quot;We decided to launch a limited military operation in defense of our sovereignty, our people and 
their properties.&quot;</p>
<p>The White House has reportedly ordered to Pentagon to take steps that the U.S. military is prepared for any contingency. 
&quot;We have made clear to Iraq the seriousness with which we view this situation,&quot; said White House spokesman Mike 
McCurry.<br>
<br>
The Pentagon late on Friday directed U.S. warplanes in the Persian Gulf area to increase their flight activity over the 
northern Iraq &quot;No Fly Zone.&quot; This was considered one of a number of &quot;precautionary moves&quot; in response to Iraqi troop 
movements toward the Kurdish-populated area in the country.<br>
<br>
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Colonel P.J. Crowley said, &quot;There are movements of forces that concern us.&quot; Crowley said that 
Iraq had moved some of its forces northward toward the region where Kurdish separatists have been fighting each other. 
There was no immediate estimate of the size of the Iraqi force. Crowley said that a number of precautionary steps were 
being considered by the United States military, but he would not elaborate on those steps. An unnamed Pentagon official 
said that some of the steps were to move U.S. Air Force fighter aircraft, that are part of an expeditionary group, into 
Jordan or another nearby country.<br>
<br>
Another move was said to be placing the aircraft carriers USS Enterprise (CVN-65, Enterprise Class), which is currently 
stationed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70, Nimitz Class), which is located in the 
Persian Gulf, on a &quot;short tether&quot; -- which means that the ships have been informed to be prepared to move on short notice. 
The aircraft on the Carl Vinson reportedly did increase its number of CAP (Combat Air Patrols) flights in the area on 
Friday.<br>

<p><font size=5>KEEPING SADDAM IN HIS BOX</font> <br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
The United States this past week extended its line in the sane right up to Baghdad. Said one Pentagon official this week, 
&quot;The United States is no longer willing to act just around the periphery of Iraq -- in the Kurdish north or the Shi'ite south. 
We are now prepared to respond to attacks to the center.&quot;<br>
<br>
After Iraq's paranoid, brutal leader was defeated in the 1991 Gulf War, the U.S.-led coalition decided not to move on 
Baghdad, even though it was perfectly capable of doing so. The fear, at the time, was that the U.S. would be sucked into a 
quagmire of Iraq's deeply divided politics. Right or wrong, it seemed to just about everyone that it was not in anyone's best 
interest if Iraq was broken into several pieces. So, the terms of the United Nations cease-fire after the Gulf War called for 
the coalition to keep its distance away from Baghdad.<br>
<br>
The U.S. this week expanded the southern &quot;no-fly&quot; zone from the 32nd parallel to the 33rd parallel. This will new 
expanded exclusion zone will now take U.S. warplanes right up to the suburbs to Baghdad, where Saddam will, himself, 
be able to hear the U.S. planes fly overhead or enjoy their sonic booms.<br>
<br>
If one were to really analyze the response of the United States, one can see the new strategic advantages. It does give 
much better protection to U.S. interests located south of Iraq, namely the Saudi and Kuwaiti oil fields. However, when 
dealing with the likes of Saddam, there are always some risks.<br>
<br>
Henri Barkey, an expert on Iraq and the Kurds at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, said, &quot;There is enormous 
potential for escalation because Iraq may decide to challenge the United States on territory most familiar to Saddam. There 
are a number of things he can do to escalate the conflict within Iraq itself, such as if he tried to fly civilian aircraft over the 
new 'no-fly' area. Or he might try to do something that he thinks could only be responded to if the U.S. increased its 
involvement -- which he knows the U.S. is intent on avoiding.&quot;<br>
<br>
The U.S. explicitly chose not to strike at Iraq's military forces near Irbil, in the northern part of the country. The U.S. 
decided on the second choice that was easier to achieve and much more valuable in the long-term. The U.S. turned Iraqi 
tactical aggression in the north and converted it into a strategic loss to Saddam in the south. Thus, this will hopefully make it 
easier to keep Saddam contained in a smaller box.<br>
<br>
Many military analysts say, however, that this week's missile attacks are hardly likely going to keep Saddam from creating 
mischief. The loss of some key military assets, including two air fields, are not likely to have a great effect.<br>
<br>
Brent Scowcroft, who was the national security advisor for President George Bush during the 1991 Gulf War, said, &quot;The 
U.S. attack struck a relatively small number of air defense targets, not large troop concentrations, much less the elite 
Republican Guard units, which are both the spearhead of the attack against Irbil and the core of Saddam's support. It 
remains to be seen whether the somewhat circumscribed, low- risk attack we launched succeeds in sending the 
high-fidelity message we intend to be heard in Baghdad.&quot;<br>
<br>
The U.S. fired 44 cruise missiles at targets in southern Iraq. In effect, it could be said that the U.S. had effectively 
abandoned the very people that the attack was meant to ostensibly address -- the Kurds. One Pentagon official said, &quot;The 
message is that the United States is now going to orient our acts toward our strategic and economic interests, which are in 
the Persian Gulf states to the south.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, what it really boils down to is that Washington is exasperated by the Kurds, who have been given more than 
$300 million in U.S. humanitarian aid in recent years. Some experts say that infighting between the two Kurdish groups, the 
KDP and the PUK, is really about who gets the smuggling rights in northern Iraq.<br>
<br>
An unnamed senior White House official said, &quot;After five years of very intense good faith efforts, which involved creating a 
U.N. guard corps to protect the Kurds, helping convoys deliver food, building bridges for relief agencies in 1992 when 
Saddam was trying to starve them out, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into redevelopment after the 1991 fighting 
and months of U.S. diplomatic mediation between the two factions, there has been a fundamental change. One faction 
decided to throw in its lot with Saddam Hussein. That was the key fact in Saddam's decision to move. We also have to 
consider it when we decide what to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
But leaving the Kurds to fight it out is bad for the region as a whole. The Kurds are causing friction in other countries, such 
as Turkey and Iran and even into Syria and some of the former Soviet republics. Things are not getting better. On 
Thursday, Turkey decided that it had enough of some of the Kurds and went into northern Iraq looking for PKK members 
and bases. ENN will further explore who and what the Kurds are, in another article, in a few days.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in other news regarding the Iraq situation on Thursday, U.S. warplanes patrolled the skies of southern Iraq 
with challenge. U.S. intelligence is indicating that Iraq's troops were withdrawing from the Kurdish region in the north.<br>
<br>
Speaking before the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, CIA Director John Deutch said, &quot;The most recent intelligence 
indicates his troops and motorized tank units are withdrawing from Irbil and the northern Iraqi frontier.&quot;<br>
<br>
However, the BBC reported on Friday morning that the U.S. intelligence reports of the Iraqis were not true. About 15 
miles south of Irbil, Iraqi forces were seen digging trenches and it looked like that they were planning on staying in the area 
for a period of time.<br>
<br>
There were some reports of fighting in northern Iraq, but it was not certain if Iraqi forces were involved. A spokesman for 
the U.S. Central Command said on Thursday that the U.S. military does not see any Iraqi involvement in the latest clash. 
The spokesman said, &quot;Some activity that is being seen is the Iraqis returning to garrison.&quot;<br>
<br>
Reaction to Saddam was still being voiced in Washington. Senator Richard Luger reiterated his position about Saddam. 
The senator said, &quot;What is clear is Saddam Hussein had not been discouraged by our attacks. ... We have to make certain 
he is badly crippled.&quot;<br>
<br>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher tried to convince the French government to join in on the overflights in the 
new expanded &quot;no-fly&quot; zone. But the French are still hesitant. It was being said that what is foreshadowing the French 
decision is that apparently France has a large economic stake in Iraq, and once again it would appear that the French are 
putting their economic interests first, instead of what is best for the overall good of containing a criminal such as Saddam 
Hussein. The same can be said for French acts and opinions towards the rogue state of Iran.<br>
<br>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said that the U.S. will not back down in the face of any criticism in the 
manner of handling the likes of Saddam Hussein. Burns said, &quot;We are accomplishing our objectives. If we have to do it 
alone, or alone with the British, we will do it.&quot;</p>

<TITLE>Iraqi Command Council Offers Plan</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 02-15-91-13:00 HRS. CST
<BR>
<H3>IRAQ REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND COUNCIL CALLS FOR PEACE</H3>
<BR>
Chicago, IL.  According to numerous reports, Iraq's leading
command council announced it's agreement to United Nation's
Resolution #660, which calls for a withdrawal from Kuwait.
No direct statements were issued, however, by President
Saddam Hussein.
<P>

Iraq demanded that the following conditions be implemented
prior to their compliance with the U.N. resolutions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>* The U.N. Security Council cancel all other resolutions in
  regard to Iraq that have been issued since the August 2nd
  invasion of Kuwait
<LI>* The U.S. and Allies repair all of the Iraqi damage caused
  by the conflict at Allied expense.
<LI>* Iraq's land and sea rights and territorial integrity must
  be maintained.
<LI>* No negative consequences must be imposed on Iraq for their
  invasion of Kuwait
<LI>* All "foreign military presence" must be removed from the
  Gulf area
<LI>* Eighty (80) Billion dollars in Iraqi debts to various
  sources and nations must be cancelled
<LI>* Iraq and other Islamic nations (i.e. Iran) must be involved
  in the political settlement of the boundries of Kuwait
<LI>* Israel must withdraw from "Palestine and other occupied
  territories".
<LI>* Syrian forces must withdrw from Lebanon.
</UL>
<P>
At first euphoric about a negotiated settlement, American
officials became less enthusiastic as the details of the
Iraqi initiative were released.  President Bush and his staff
reviewed the stipulations for the Iraqi withdrawal, and after
deliberation, labelled the proposal a "cruel hoax".  Senator
Paul Simon of Illinois, stated that he hoped that the effort
for peace was genuine, but that he feared that it "may be
another ploy" in the Iraqi propaganda campaign. Military and
intellegence analysts hypothesized that the Iraqi offer was a
secondary gambit to the Iraqi media campaign, launched after
Thursday's bombing of an alleged "civilian bomb-shelter".
<P>
Coalition military forces, after review and cosultation
regarding the "peace plan", declared that the air-war would
continue as before.  Continued reports of Allied convoy
movements towards the Kuwaiti border would seem to indicate
an acceleration of the date of the ground offensive.  The
newly deployed American 3rd Armored Division is reported to
have received a bulk of it's heavy equipment and is
proceeding toward the front lines.  Constant small unit
probes are being conducted to ascertain the actual nature of
the dug-in enemy's positions.

<font size=5><strong>Tensions Continue to Increase Over Iraq Incidents</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
WASHINGTON (ENN) - U.S. warplanes were fired upon by Iraqi forces in northern Iraq on Wednesday. Tensions 
between Washington and Baghdad continued to rise when an Iraqi MiG-25 jet and a military helicopter flew in the 
southern &quot;no-fly&quot; zone during the day. No immediate action was taken by U.S forces to the defiance. On Tuesday, 
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said that if U.S. planes were threatened &quot;we will take action.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pentagon officials said that in the first incident, that occurred in northwestern Iraq, a SAM-6 surface-to-air missile was 
fired at two U.S. F-16 fighter jets. The missile missed the planes. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said, &quot;Our fighters 
which were in the area could not return fire at the SAM site because the Iraqi radars were turned off very quickly.&quot;<br>
The incident happened at 0358 EDT (0758 GMT), near Gir Pahn, which is located midway between the cities of Mosul 
and Zakho in northwestern Iraq. One senior Pentagon official said that the missile was &quot;errant&quot; and suggested that the radar 
was not on long enough to provide for an accurate shot.<br>
<br>
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry was noticeably angry about the Iraqi attack on the U.S. warplanes. He spoke a 
bit more bluntly than he normally does and said that Iraq would soon learn that Washington was &quot;not playing games&quot; and 
that any attack launched against U.S. warplanes would draw a &quot;disproportionate&quot; response from the United States.<br>
<br>
The Pentagon said that B-52 bombers have been moved from Guam in the Pacific Ocean to the British air base on the 
island of Diego Garcia, which is located in the Indian Ocean. One Defense Department source indicated that eight F-117A 
stealth fighter/ bombers had been dispatched to Kuwait.<br>
<br>
Secretary Perry told reporters on Wednesday, &quot;In Iraq, air defense crews are playing some kind of a game and they will 
very soon learn that we are not playing games. The responses that we will make ... will be disproportionate with the 
provocations which are made against us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Perry said that the Iraqis fired a &quot;wild shot&quot; and &quot;only had their radar turned on for a few seconds.&quot; Said the SecDef, that 
was a wise decision on the behalf of the Iraqis who fired the missile, otherwise &quot;They would have had an anti-radiation 
missile down their throats.&quot;<br>
<br>
ERRI analysts believe that confidence is high that another U.S. attack on Iraq will probably take place shortly. However, 
this may be exactly what Saddam Hussein wants. These were direct provocations in order to get the U.S. to retaliate. 
Saddam's game plan may be for the U.S. to attack in response to the provocations. After another U.S. attack, there will 
probably be more disapproval from the world community and he may hope to start driving a wedge into the U.S.-led 
coalition. With that out of the way, he may be able to regain total control of Iraq, once again.<br>
<br>
Hitting these &quot;strategic&quot; targets in southern Iraq with more cruise missiles will not stop the provocations from Saddam 
Hussein. What will be needed to send him back &quot;underground,&quot; if you will, will be a strong attack against targets that he 
cares about. i.e. his many palaces across the country, intelligence and defense headquarters, monuments in Baghdad, or the 
Baghdad power grid. It is necessary to make Saddam feel some pain -- otherwise he is just going to continue to provoke 
the U.S., probably up until election time, at the very least.<br>

<em>An Excerpted </em><em><u>ARAB VIEW</u></em><em> of the United States' Attacks on Iraq</em><br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>SADDAM BECOMES HERO OF THE ARAB WORLD??</strong></font><br>
<br>
CHICAGO (ENN) - There is no question that in the Arab media Israel has become an integral component of the war 
hysteria resulting from the conflict between Baghdad and Washington. Almost all Arab newspapers, particularly in Syria 
and Egypt (countries whose armies were once members of the anti-Iraqi coalition) have now turned Saddam Hussein into 
the contemporary hero of the Arab world. Some went so far as to crown him the new Nasser, on his way to coalescing the 
prevailing manifestations of pan-Arab passion.<br>
<br>
In Egypt, capital of the Arab world, and in other Arab countries, government television stations began to broadcast 
selected clips from the Nasser period. There is a rising tide of popular anti-Western sentiment. To this must be added the 
glaring headlines which claimed, quoting the London Times, that Israel had issued a warning to Iraq not to attack it. 
Baghdad has already retorted in the Arab press that Israel was collaborating with Washington in the planning of American 
military action against Iraq.<br>
<br>
Saddam's popularity is gaining momentum so quickly that Iran, which previously had an interest in the weakening of the 
Iraqi regime, has now announced its readiness to return Iraqi warplanes seized during the Gulf war. This would be 
Teheran's contribution to Saddam's effort to chip away at the US's deterrence posture in the region.<br>
<br>
An incisive reading of the Arab press reveals that Iraq has concluded that the tables have turned; indeed, with the 
exception of Kuwait, all the Arab countries in the former anti-Saddam coalition now lend their support to the 
anti-American front led by Baghdad. Since this morning, the latter is expressing an explicit linkage between the US 
administration and its ally in the region, Israel. All of this is designed to raise the frenzy in the Arab world to its crescendo, 
and with it support for Saddam.<br>
<br>
Commentators across the region posited that Saddam has succeeded in restoring pride to the Muslims, and that, 
historically speaking, this is the start of an Islamic wave that will purge the entire area.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>ARAFAT CEMENTS BONDS WITH SADDAM</strong></font><br>
<br>
Among the Palestinians as well, Saddam is being portrayed as a great leader; there are reports that his ally from the Gulf 
war, PLO chief Yasir Arafat, has already renewed his contacts with Iraq, talking this weekend with Saddam by telephone 
from Cairo.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>IRAN BLASTS ARAFAT</strong></font><br>
<br>
The Iranian media has remained fairly quiet concerning events in the Persian Gulf, instead being satisfied with the general 
statement that during American election campaigns, the administration always seeks a scapegoat on whose back it can ride 
into another four years in the White House. In discussing Yasir Arafat, the Teheran Times called on the Palestinians to rid 
themselves of their leader, and to replace him with a forthright Muslim leader who would concern himself with the interests 
of the Palestinian people. The paper cast aspersions on Arafat's integrity and reliability, citing recent reports in the West 
alleging that Arafat is holding bank accounts in Europe while he declares that his people do not have a morsel of food. In a 
scathing historical review of Arafat's leadership, Teheran Times concluded that Arafat is motivated by personal interest and 
greed, and that the time has come to replace him with a religious individual who would lead the Palestinians into the new 
era of Islam.</p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=4><strong>ERRI Commentary on these developments: </strong></font></font><font size=4><strong><br>
</strong></font>By: Clark Staten, Senior Analyst<br>
<br>
The old saying &quot;my enemy's enemy must be my friend&quot; may be applicable in regard to the Iranian view of the current 
conflict between the United States and Iraq. And, besides, the Iranians would benefit and be happy, regardless of who 
&quot;loses&quot;. It would appear that Iran is using the current situation in Iraq as a propaganda tool and that they view it as a major 
&quot;present&quot; from the USA.<br>
<br>
They are presently protraying themselves as &quot;humanitarian protectors&quot; of the Islamic Kurds, who are fleeing an onslaught 
by KDP and Iraqi intelligence forces. Secondarily, they wish for Iraq to give the United States as many &quot;black eyes&quot; as 
possible, to appear as impotent as possible, and ultimately split the former anti-Iraqi coilition into factions they can later 
exploit. And finally, they are attempting to undermine and repudiate Yasir Arafat and assume both political and religious 
leadership of the PLO, in particular, and all Palestinian groups, in general.<br>
<br>
It should also be noted that at least some of this chaos is also a very pointed attempt at ending the Israeli/PLO peace 
accord, which a number of Islamic powers will go to great lengths to destroy. Outlook?? Continued exploitation of the 
media by use of &quot;information processing and disinformation campaigns, both from Iran and Iraq can be expected. Other 
threats, including terrorism directed against the United States or Israel, may become evident in the coming days. It would 
appear likely that the situation surrounding Iraq could excalate soon. <br>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><font size=5><strong>RESIDENTS WARNED TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS WHEN 
RETURNING TO FLOOD-DAMAGED HOMES</strong></font></font><br>
<br>
WASHINGTON July 19, 1996 -- Federal and state disaster officials are urging people returning to flood-damaged 
homes, apartments or businesses to take extra precautions before and during their clean-up efforts. &quot;The dangers are 
not over after the water goes down,&quot; said James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA), the agency that coordinates the federal relief effort for major disasters. &quot;Flood hazards such as a weakened 
foundation, exposed wires or contaminated floodwater are not always obvious and can be potentially life-threatening 
if precautions are not taken,&quot; Witt said. &quot;If, at any time, you are unsure of or feel uncomfortable with a situation, do 
not hesitate to ask for help or seek advice from an expert,&quot; he added. &quot;Play it safe.&quot; Disaster officials are urging 
people to keep these safety tips in mind:<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><font size=4>BEFORE ENTERING A BUILDING:</font></font><br>
<br>
Check the outside of the building: Call the utility company immediately if you find downed power lines or detect gas 
leaks. (Gas leaks will emit an odor of rotten eggs.)<br>
<br>
Look for external damage: Examine the foundation for cracks or other damage. Also examine porch roofs and 
overhangs to be sure they still have all their supports. Look for gaps between the steps and the house. If any 
supports or portions of the foundation walls are missing or the ground has washed away, the floor is not safe. If you 
see obvious damage, have a building inspector check the house before you go in.<br>
<br>
Enter the building carefully: If the door sticks at the top it could mean the ceiling is ready to fall. If you force the door 
open, stand outside the doorway, clear of falling debris.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><font size=4>AFTER ENTERING A BUILDING:</font></font><br>
<br>
Look before you step: The ground and floors are covered with debris including broken bottles and nails. Floors and 
stairs can be very slippery.<br>
<br>
Be alert for gas leaks: Do not strike a match or use an open flame when you enter the building unless you know the 
gas has been turned off and the area ventilated. Use a flashlight to inspect for damage.<br>
<br>
Turn off the electricity: Even if the power company has turned off electricity to the area, be sure to disconnect your 
house's power supply. Do not use appliances or motors that have gotten wet unless they have been taken apart, 
cleaned and dried. <br>
<br>
Replace exposed wires: Electrical wires that have been exposed to salt water are recyclable junk and must be 
replaced.<br>
<br>
Watch for animals, especially snakes: Small animals that have been flooded out of their homes may seek shelter in 
yours. Use a stick to poke and turn items over and scare away rats, mice, snakes, or other small animals.<br>
<br>
Carbon monoxide exhaust kills: Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machine outdoors. The same goes for 
camping stoves. Charcoal fumes are deadly; cook with charcoal ONLY outdoors.<br>
<br>
Drain your basement carefully: Water in the ground puts pressure on your basement walls and floors. Drain the 
basement gradually to minimize further structural damage.<br>
<br>
Hose the house: Most of the health hazards brought by a flood are in the mud and silt that is left after the water drains 
away. Shovel out as much mud as possible and hose the house down, inside and out.<br>
<br>
Be aware of health hazards: Flood waters have picked up sewage and chemicals from roads, farms, factories, and 
storage buildings. Many flooded items, such as wallboard and mattresses, will hold mud and contamination forever. 
Spoiled food, flooded cosmetics, and medicine are also health hazards. When in doubt, throw them out.<br>

<p><font size=5><strong>REPORT SAYS PENTAGON FAILED TO TAKE ADEQUATE 
SECURITY MEASURES </strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
A study of the 25 June attack where a terrorist truck bomb at the Khobar Towers complex in Saudi Arabia where 19 U.S. 
airmen were killed and more than 250 others were wounded says that despite warnings of a terrorist threat, the Pentagon 
failed to take adequate security measures. The report was released on Monday in Washington.<br>
<br>
A 40-man Pentagon task force that was headed by retired U.S. Army General Wayne Downing, the former commander of 
U.S. Special Forces, is highly critical by saying that military leaders failed to provide clear standards, adequate funding and 
proper attention to protect U.S. forces against what was recognized as a terrorism threat in Saudi Arabia.<br>
<br>
Only one person was singled out by name as for bearing some blame. That was U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Terryl 
&quot;Terry&quot; Schwalier. The report said that Schwalier is said to have failed to heed warnings of a terrorist attack on the Khobar 
Towers in Dhahran. General Downing said that Schwalier did a reasonable job in increasing security inside of the complex, 
but did not do enough about security outside the gates. According to the report, Schwalier should have done more to 
convince the Saudis, who were responsible for security on the outside of the perimeter, to do more towards increasing 
security.<br>
<br>
Downing's report also suggests that high-level inattention to security problems and also contradicts many of the 
explanations that U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry gave shortly after the bombing in June. This new description of 
serious security problems is likely to renew Congressional criticism of the Defense Secretary. President Bill Clinton 
received the report on Monday and called it &quot;unvarnished, blunt and straightforward.&quot; The President promised to see 
through and implement the recommended improvements in security measures.<br>
<br>
The President said, &quot;We know we're living in a world in which terrorism is a bigger problem, in which Americans may be 
the target of terrorists, particularly Americans in Uniform. As we know more about what we can do to protect them, we 
intend to do everything we can. We're going to aggressively implement the Downing report.&quot;<br>
<br>
Right after the report was released, Deputy Secretary of Defense John White and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
General John Shalikashvili, responded by emphasizing the steps that the Pentagon is taking to improve security and efforts 
to collect and analyze information on terrorist organizations.<br>
<br>
White said, &quot;Americans didn't kill these airmen. Terrorists killed these airmen. And our focus then is on what we can do in 
order to make sure that we minimize and protect against these kinds of enormous, complicated and sophisticated threats in 
the future.&quot; Downing's report describes the attack quite differently than the way Secretary Perry described to Congress a 
few months ago.<br>
<br>
<font size=5><strong>Among the differences are:</strong></font><br>
<br>
<img src="/redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> <font size=4><strong>WARNINGS: </strong></font>SecDef Perry said that officials had only, in his words, &quot;fragmentary and inconclusive&quot; intelligence 
about a possible terrorist attack.<br>
<br>
The Downing report cites ten separate suspicious incidents 90 days prior to the attack, as well as other signs that raised 
concerns. The report said, &quot;While intelligence did not provide the tactical details of date, time, place and exact method of 
attack on Khobar Towers, a considerable body of information was available that indicated terrorists had the capability and 
intention to target U.S. interests in Saudi Arabia and that Khobar Towers was a potential target.&quot;<br>
<br>
Downing, himself, also wrote, &quot;I am concerned that insufficent attention is being given to anti-terrorism measures and force 
protection. Specifically, the attack with a stand-off bomb was only one of many vulnerabilities which existed at Khobar 
Towers and other locations visited in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region.&quot;<br>
<br>
The retired general also said that the use of intelligence provided ample time for actions that could have decreased the 
severity of the attack. Downing said, &quot;Intelligence did provide warning of the terrorist threat to U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. 
As a result, those responsible for force protection had both time and motivation to reduce vulnerabilities. However, it was 
not enough. Tactical details were needed and they could only have been provided by human intelligence.&quot;<br>
<br>
The team that wrote the report found that U.S. intelligence capabilites in Saudi Arabia &quot;had eroded.&quot; It was recommended 
that the United States &quot;take immediate action to address this significant shortfall&quot; by placing emphasis on more time, people 
and funds to develop better intelligence capabilites that can improve the forecasting of future terrorist attacks.<br>
<br>
Downing suggested that the government &quot;provide our forces with a state-of-the-art sensors, blast protectors, automated 
entry points and cargo inspection devices.&quot; A security command center which would monitor these technical devices 
should had been in place at the Khobar Towers complex.<br>
<br>
<img src="/redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> <font size=4><strong>BOMB:</strong></font> Secretary Perry described a huge and sophisticated truck bomb that was built beyond what was felt as the 
capabilities of known terrorists in Saudi Arabia. The bomb essentially overwhelmed the security measures at Khobar 
Towers.<br>
<br>
Attached to Downing's report was another report by the Defense Special Weapons Agency. This agency usually makes 
determinations of nuclear bomb blasts. It estimated that the bomb that exploded on 25 June was equivalent to 20,000 to 
30,000 pounds of TNT, much larger than the bomb that destroyed the federal building in Oklahoma City.<br>
<br>
The bomb that exploded at Khobar Towers left a crater 35-feet deep and 85-feet wide. On 27 August, the four man team 
from Defense Special Weapons Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers test-detonated a 21,000 pound bomb that was 
packed in a fuel tank trailer in Fort Polk, Louisiana. Based on the results of this test-detonation, the theory that the bomb 
used at Dhahran was much bigger than the 3,000 to 5,000 pounds that was originally estimated. The team wrote a 
300-page report on their findings.<br>
<br>
The Defense Special Weapons Agency report said, &quot;The unprecedented use of 20,000 pounds or more of explosives in a 
terrorist attack has dramatically upped the ante ... a threat of this magnitude places heavy demands on all aspects of 
security.&quot;<br>
<br>
At a Monday afternoon briefing at the Pentagon, Downing dismissed the Defense Special Weapons Agence report as 
&quot;inaccurate.&quot; Downing gave as evidence a soldier who was standing only 80 feet away from the bomb that exploded &quot;and 
survived&quot; with only minor injuries. Downing noted that the security guard who survived the blast suffered punctured 
eardrums and he also said that the explosion did not blow all the leaves off nearby plants.<br>
<br>
Downing said, &quot;There is no way that bomb could have been 20,000 pounds and have that man survive and have the really 
superficial damage that was done to some of the outlying vehicles and vegetation.&quot;<br>
<br>
General Shalikashvili, however, stood by the Pentagon's bomb assessment. He said, &quot;To me it's convincing. The bomb that 
created that kind of a damage, that kind of a crater ... must have been much larger that we even initially anticipated.&quot;<br>
<br>
Explosives experts that were part of Downing's team estimate that the bomb was 3,000 to 8,000 pounds and only about a 
quarter of the size of the terrorist truck bomb that was used to kill 241 U.S. Marines in Beirut, Lebanon, on October of 
1983.<br>
<br>
<img src="/redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> <font size=4><strong>SAUDI INACTION: </strong></font>Secretary Perry said that military officials had sought to move a security fence that was 100 
feet from Khobar Towers to 400 feet for additional protection from an explosion from a bomb. However, Saudi officials 
would not permit the moving of the fence.<br>
<br>
Downing said that in reality U.S. officials wanted to move the fence only 10 to 20 feet for improving observation, not 
further out for blast protection. U.S. officers said they did ask the Saudis for permission. The Saudis said that they were 
not asked. Regardless of the case, said the report, the matter should have been raised to U.S. officials at higher levels.<br>
<br>
<img src="/redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> <font size=4><strong>SECURITY MEASURES:</strong></font> Secretary Perry said that 130 security-related improvements had been made at 
Khobar Towers before the 25 June attack. These measures were responsible, according to Perry, for saving dozens, if not 
hundreds, of lives.<br>
<br>
Downing says that the security measures were not given a high priority for funding and there are no Defense Department 
standards for physcial security. Security is pretty much left to the base commander. Air Force Brig-Gen. Schwalier, the 
commander of the USAF 4404th Wing at Dhahran, apparently deferred a budget request for protective Mylar film for 
windows to prevent shattering glass. Twleve of the 19 people killed at the Khobar Towers died from flying glass.<br>
<br>
Secretary Perry and other top military officials were scheduled to appear before the House National Security Committee 
on Wednesday.<br>
<br>
In a cover letter that was attached to the report that was given to President Clinton, Perry reaffirmed his support for 
retaining General J.H. Binford Peay III, who is the commands the U.S. Central Command.<br>
<br>
Some military commanders, and especially General Schwalier, will be in some hot water in the coming days. General 
Downing wrote a scathing part in the report that said, &quot;Khobar Towers was identifed to General Schwalier as one of the 
three highest-priority soft targets in the region.&quot; The report noted that Schwalier, however, did not make terrorism a top 
priority. The report added that Schwalier contends that he &quot;never raised to superiors force protection matters that were 
beyond his capability to correct.&quot;<br>
<br>
Later, Downing said that just because a base commander knows how to fly planes, it doesn't mean he knows a great deal 
about securing a base against terrorist threats. Downing proposes a special Pentagon team that will support base 
commanders with the know-how about how to improve base security measures.</p>

<title>Trouble in Mexico; Rebels Attack</title>

<p><font size=5><strong>TROUBLE IN MEXICO</strong></font> <br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
This past week, coordinated rebel attacks were launched on Mexican police and army barracks in six different states in the 
Latin America country. These attacks resulted in the deaths of between 14 to 16 people and another 22 were wounded.<br>
The Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR) took responsibility for the attacks. EPR first appeared on 28 June and, at first, 
was no taken very seriously because all of the first attacks were considered to be small-scale.<br>
<br>
But the operations that took place on Thursday and Friday were anything but small-scale rebel attacks. Witnesses in the 
town of Tixtla described 30 gunmen with their faces covered with bandannas and wearing khaki uniforms. The attackers 
moved through the town's main square in combat formation and proceeded to open fire on the police.<br>
<br>
One policeman, who traded fire with the rebels before he found himself outnumbered and seriously outgunned, said, &quot;I 
didn't believe in them at all, but seeing them I realized that the guerrillas do exist. They are fanatical and dedicated, they 
have killing in their hearts ... it was a commando that knew about strategy and guerrilla war.&quot; Other witnesses who hid in 
shops in the town as the gunbattle was waged said that it was obvious that the rebels were well- disciplined. They 
specifically ordered civilians to get out of the way, saying they were only after the police and soldiers.<br>
<br>
In another southern Mexico town, Huatulco, located in the state of Oaxaca, the rebels attacked a police station, a naval 
base, the town hall and one other public building. Seven people were killed and seven others were wounded in the attacks.<br>
<br>
On Friday, the Mexican military set up roadblocks and searched the hills for the guerrillas. The Mexican newspapers said 
that the attacks were the most wide-ranging guerrilla action in decades. The papers also worried that the EPR could be a 
new threat to the country. <br>
<br>
The Mexican government, later in the day, ordered tighter security at airports and coastal resorts. Dozens of suspected 
rebels were arrested in at least nine states. Mexican Interior Undersecretary Arturo Nunez said that the EPR was an arm 
of a Marxist group called the Clandestine Revolutionary Workers Party Union of the People (PROCUP). Nunez said, &quot;It 
is a radical group which said it seeks power through violent means, which proclaims that a dictatorship of the proletariat 
should be installed in Mexico to construct socialism.&quot;<br>
<br>
The EPR has called for a new Mexican government, a new constitution and leftist economic changes. As far as is known, it 
has not publicly called for a socialist dictatorship. However, one of the suspects who was arrested for having connections 
to the group said &quot;the ideology of the EPR is of a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist type.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nunez said that on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, less than 200 rebels took part in the attacks. Three soldiers, 
six policeman, two civilians and two guerrillas were killed.<br>
<br>
The U.S. State Department did condemn the attacks by saying: &quot;There can be no justification for violence in pursuit of 
political ends in Mexico. However, it is important to underscore that the United States does not consider these actions 
threatening to Mexican political or economic stability.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mexican officials during the summer consistently downplayed the significance of the EPR. About two weeks ago, Nunez 
said that it appeared that the EPR had be confined to the state of Guerrero. On Friday, the perception of the threat 
changed. Federal police could be seen walking with dogs at Mexico City airport. Increased security was checking cars, 
trucks and buses along many highways in Mexico. Nunez said, &quot;New actions by this group cannot be discounted.&quot; He 
added that the rebels &quot;want attention, to generate a climate of anxiety, of uncertainty, to project an image abroad of a 
destabilized Mexico.&quot; Nunez also suggested that EPR may be financing itself with bank robberies and kidnaps for ransom.<br></p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>How much is really known about the Popular Revolutionary Army?</strong></font><br>
<br>
They apparently first appeared on 28 June at a memorial service near Acapulco for peasants who were massacred by 
Guerrero state police in January of 1994. Very little is known about the size of the EPR. Best indications were given this 
past week when it was said that about 200 rebels took part in the attacks. It is believed, but not confirmed, that the group 
grew out of rebel bands that was led by one Lucio Cabanas, who hid in the hills of Guerreo in the 1960s and 1970s. They 
appear to have been trained to carry out operations with military precision, and have some modern weapons. Other than 
that, not much else is know, at this time.<br>
<br>
There is a government concern that poor people living in the areas where the EPR is operating will sympathize and even 
join the rebel cause in southern Mexico. On Sunday night, in his state-of-the union address, Mexican President Ernesto 
Zedillo introduced new social programs aimed at offsetting the poverty that appears to be behind the violence. &quot;Mexicans 
will not permit -- when our country is back on its feet, overcoming adversities -- the appearance of groups that use 
terrorism to assassinate, destroy or threaten,&quot; said Zedillo.<br>
<br>
ERRI analysts have kept appraised of the EPR all summer, but like most analysts -- it was felt that the EPR held no 
significant threat. While ERRI would agree with the State Department assessment, the situation still does bear close 
monitoring until more is known about this group. They most certainly have the ability to cause great havoc in the rural and 
tourist areas in southern Mexico. More attacks by EPR are expected.<br>

<H2>Web Business Systems, Inc. Acknowledges ERRI Rights to "EmergencyNet" Name</H2>
By: Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor
<P>
Web Business Systems, Inc., through their attorney Mr. Barry Shapiro, today officially agreed to discontinue their use of the name "EmergencyNet",  as it related to doing business on the World-Wide-Web.  In a letter to ERRI's attorney, Mr. Frank Nagorka of the Chicago-based Mora & Baugh law firm, Mr. Shapiro acknowledged ERRI's intellectual property rights in regard to the name and advised that the <I><B>emergencynet.com</B> </I>website has been shut-down.
<P>
According to Nagorka, the announcement was the result of a series of letters, faxes, and phone calls that outlined ERRI's position in regard to it's registered ownership of the name and intellectual concept of an "EmergencyNet", that provides news and information to Fire/Police/EMS/Disaster/Counter-Terrorist/Military and other related emergency personnel. Nagorka said, "This letter reaffirms ERRI's rights to the name 'EmergencyNet', particularly as it relates to the provision of emergency news on the Web."
<P>

Clark Staten, ERRI's executive director, said, "I'm glad that we could settle this without going to court; it could have been a costly and protracted situation for both parties..but, one in which I am sure we would have eventually prevailed."  "But, this agreement is a far more civilized and professional solution...we wish Web Business Systems nothing but the best as they choose a new name and proceed with their web marketing plans," Staten concluded.
<P>

Today's decision was the result on a legal challenge that was begun before Web Business Systems, Inc. actually went on-line with a Website named "Emergency Net", that was seen to be in conflict with the already established "EmergencyNet News Service", which is featured at http://www.emergency.com/ennday.htm.

<font size=6>REPORTS CITE U.S. SHORTCOMINGS IN 
SAUDI ARABIA</font> <br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
CHICAGO (ENN) - Phones at the offices of congressmen and senators in Washington were probably ringing 
off the hook on Monday morning after three critical media reports were published and broadcast on Sunday 
about serious shortcomings regarding the U.S. military mission in Saudi Arabia.<br>
<br>
The White House, the State Department and the Pentagon were surely attempting to spin damage control on 
some of the outrage that may be expressed by American citizens about how U.S. servicemen were protected 
and are being treated in the Saudi Kingdom.<br>
<br>
First, the New York Times in its Sunday editions had a special report on apparent shortcomings in the planning, 
in the gathering of intelligence and in security that left U.S. military personnel vulnerable to the terrorist bombing 
attack on 25 June 1996. The Times said that an examination of the attack showed that U.S. officials repeatedly 
failed to understand the magnitude of the threat that they faced.<br>
<br>
The report cited interviews with U.S. and Saudi Arabian officials, reviewed past bombing attacks and obtained 
expert analysis from leading private security experts.<br>
<br>
The report listed these mistakes that lead to the bombing that killed 19 military personnel:<br>
<br>
-- The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other U.S. government experts, that the Air Force 
consulted, misjudged the bomb-making capabilities of the Saudi terrorists. It was the belief of government 
officials that the terrorists could not build a bomb larger than the 200-pound device that was used in the 
November 1995 bombing in Riyadh. The bomb that was used on 25 June was said to be about 5000 pounds. 
The inaccurate estimate was said to be hampered by a lack of information about militant groups operating in 
Saudi Arabia. An unidentified U.S. intelligence official told the New York Times, &quot;We are running with a base 
of knowledge that's virtually zero. We didn't know anything about these people.&quot;<br>
<br>
-- U.S. military commanders in Dhahran deferred action until at least October to coat the windows in the 
compound with a plastic protective film that prevents the effects of a blast from turning the windows of a 
building into lethal shards of glass. The project, said to cost about $4 million, was considered to be too costly 
by the commanders.<br>
<br>
-- The U.S. military commanders in Dhahran did not wish to offend their Saudi hosts when they rejected the 
need for a larger buffer zone around the military compound.<br>
<br>
U.S. Air Force Major-General Kurt Anderson, who commands the joint task force at Dhahran said, &quot;The 
barrier, if it had been further out, would have helped us. There is no doubt in my mind that it would have helped 
us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Appearing on ABC's &quot;This Week With David Brinkley,&quot; a popular American Sunday morning news show, the 
Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar, when asked why the FBI was not allowed to 
interrogate four Saudi militants who were arrested and executed for the November 1995 terrorist bombing in 
Riyadh, replied: &quot;We do things differently than Americans. We do not think that it is a good idea to tell the 
terrorists what we know and what we intend to do about them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Also appearing on that television show was former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker. Baker said that, in his 
opinion, it was inexcusable for Saudi authorities not to allow U.S. officials to increase security at the compound. 
The former secretary said, &quot;Frankly, I see no excuse for a failure to permit Americans to upgrade our security 
there if the Saudis are going to count on us for their security.&quot;<br>
<br>
But, Baker added, that if high-level officials in Washington had been made aware of the U.S. requests, they 
most likely would have gotten full cooperation from their counterparts in Saudi Arabia. Baker said that when the 
Saudis are approached at the highest level, &quot;You get the kind of cooperation that is needed.&quot; He cited his 
experiences with the Saudis during the 1991 Gulf War with Iraq.<br>
<br>
Later in the evening on another popular American televison news show, CBS's &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; there was a very 
disturbing report by reporter Bob Simon about how American military personnel are treated in Saudi Arabia. In 
an interview with eight U.S. Air Force fighter pilots, the pilots expressed their displeasure about being assigned 
to duty in the country. One pilot said that the Saudis treat Americans as &quot;Their dirty little secret.&quot;<br>
<br>
The most disturbing thing that Americans probably heard in the report is that the American flag is not allowed to 
be flown in Saudi Arabia. An issue that is important and close to the heart of most Americans.<br>
<br>
Simon's report may have shown that even before the terrorist bombing, there may have been a morale problem 
for the personnel who are serving in the Saudi Kingdom. The American personnel who were interviewed were 
not very happy about the treatment that they have received.<br>
<br>
There is supposed to be at least three congressional hearings this week looking into the bombing that occurred 
almost two weeks ago. Sunday's news reports are sure to throw gasoline on what was already going to be a 
seemingly fiery examination between Republican Congressmen and Senators and U.S. Secretary of Defense 
William Perry.<br>
<br>
There does seem to be a number of issues that must be examined and addressed between the U.S. and Saudi 
Arabia. However, the rhetoric that is now coming forward and the pointing of fingers of blame at each other is 
only giving the terrorists what they wanted all along and that is to drive a wedge between the U.S and Saudi 
relationship.<br>
<br>
Should the terrorists accomplish their goal and the Americans decide to pull out of Saudi Arabia -- there would 
be considerable repurcussions to security and political considerations throughout the Middle East.<br>
<br>
Everyone should realize that there is a very distinct cultural difference between an &quot;open&quot; American society and 
a &quot;closed&quot; Saudi society that very few Americans understand. But the Saudis have generally always been friends 
with the U.S. in a region where, at times, the U.S. had few friends. There are issues that must be addressed. But 
analysts should keep in mind how an American pull out of Saudi Arabia will be perceived in the minds of the 
Arab world. It will only add fuel to the age old argument, in their minds, &quot;Kill a few Americans and they cut and 
run.&quot;<br>
<br>
Instead of creating more security for our military personnel -- which certainly must be done at all costs, in our 
viewpoint -- an American pull out could create a danger to all Americans throughout the Middle East. One must 
remember with whom we are dealing...and how they think.<br>
<br>
ENN will provide full coverage of the results of this weeks important hearings.</p>

<font size=5><strong>Iraq Launches Biggest Offensive in Five Years</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
WASHINGTON (ENN) - Iraq launched its biggest military offensive in five years on Saturday. Hundreds of tanks, tens of 
thousands of troops and a number of helicopters were sent into northern Iraq to capture the city of Irbil, located about 180 
miles north of Baghdad. U.S. military intelligence believes that Iraq ordered three tank divisions into northern Iraq with 
more than 30,000 troops. The Iraqi forces were being assisted by members of the Kurdistan Democratic Party.<br>
<br>
By Saturday night, most, if not all, of the city of Irbil had been taken by Iraqi forces. The rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan 
(PUK) said that it was continuing to put up a resistance to the invasion. Iraq went into the &quot;safe haven&quot; area for the Kurds 
because PUK had been cooperating with Iran, which has sent troops over the Iraqi border in recent weeks.<br>
<br>
Iraq on Saturday said that its forces &quot;would return to their former positions very soon,&quot; but gave no timetable. If the Iraqi 
forces were to withdrawal quickly it would prevent a showdown with Western forces, which appears likely if Saddam's 
troops stay in the area for an extended period of time.<br>
<br>
In London on Saturday night, a PUK spokesman said that &quot;fighting is still going on and people are resisting. Hundreds of 
Iraqi tanks are inside the city. The army is storming houses and arresting people.&quot; The spokesman also said that he 
estimated that the Iraqi army had captured about &quot;70 percent of the city.&quot; He added that about 450 Iraqi tanks were 
involved in the offensive, as well as helicopter gunships.<br>
<br>
In Washington, the Pentagon alerted U.S. air and naval forces in the United States and abroad to prepare for possible 
deployment to the Middle East in response to the attack on the Kurds. There are currently about 20,000 American troops 
in the Gulf area, most are said to be aboard U.S. Navy ships. President Clinton said that U.S. forces &quot;are now being 
reinforced,&quot; but the Pentagon said that it had not received any orders to send more troops to the region.<br>
<br>
During the day, top national security aides met at the White House to discuss the situation and to consider what options 
were available. The President was in touch with national security advisor Anthony Lake, several times on Saturday. Some 
officials are concerned that Iraq had used some its more powerful forces in the operation, it is still unclear whether what 
has happened is provocation enough to justify the threat of U.S. military retaliation. The situation is made more unclear by 
the reported request of the Kurdish faction to Iraq for assistance.<br>
<br>
It was said that a fleet of about three dozen U.S. Air Force fighter planes from bases in Virginia, South Carolina and North 
Carolina, plus four B-52 bombers, were informed to be ready to move at short notice. Some U.S. Navy ships were 
ordered to move closer to the Arabian Peninsula.<br>
<br>
One unidentified source said that the U.S. was assembling an &quot;air expeditionary force&quot; that would be comprised of about 
30 to 40 planes that would be sent to the Middle East -- possibly Jordan. This force would include: F-15Cs from Langley 
Air Force Base, Virginia; F-15Es from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina; and F-16s from Shaw Air 
Force Base, South Carolina.<br>
<br>
The Pentagon has also reportedly notified members of a U.S. Marine Amphibious Ready Group. One such group is said to 
be already in the Arabian Sea. The Pentagon said late on Saturday that it has more than 300 U.S. warplanes and 20 naval 
ships ready in case it is given the order to use military force against the Iraqis. More than 200 warplanes are already in the 
Gulf region, including 79 on the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70, Nimitz Class). Military experts believe that if the U.S. were 
to stage an attack, it would rely heavily on air attacks.</p>

<p><font size=5><strong>NINE DEAD, FORTY INJURED<br>
IN L.A. APARTMENT COMPLEX FIRE</strong></font></p>
<p><strong>By: Clark Staten, EMT-P </strong></p>
<p>Los Angeles - A fire of questionable origin roared through a three-story apartment complex in Los Angeles 
yesterday. In it's wake, seven children and two pregnant woman are dead and dozens more being treated in several 
area hospitals. The fire, which broke out at approximately 4:30p.m. PDT, also left four others in extremely critical 
condition. </p>
<p>Fire Chief Donald Manning said that the fire began on the second floor of a forty (40) unit apartment building in the 
Westlake section of L.A.. Manning said that the building lacked working smoke detectors and that the fire doors, 
used to prevent the spread of flames and smoke from one section of the building to another, were propped open. 
Reportedly, the open fire doors allowed the smoke and super-heated gases to move rapidly through the hallway and 
probably contributed to the high death toll. </p>
<p>According to fire department sources, the first arriving firefighters were faced with a heavy smoke condition and 
people jumping from the second and third story windows. Paramedics quickly established a traige area at the front of 
the building and several were seen performing cardio- pulmonary resuscitation on children as they were rescued from 
the smoky recesses of the stricken building. Other paramedics put oxygen masks on the faces of dozens of smoke- 
inhalation victims that were carried or stumbled out onto the sidewalk. Several of the victims were said to have been 
found unconscious and &quot;stacked-up&quot; in one particularly long hallway that ran the length of the building. </p>
<p>One of the fire's victims was rushed to nearby Good Samaritan Hospital, were a premature infant was delivered in an 
attempt to save it and the mother's life. A hospital spokesperson said that the baby was in critical condition, and that 
the baby's prognosis is uncertain. Both fetuses of two other pregnant women, that were transported to the hospital, 
also died as a result of the fire. Their mothers succumbed to smoke-inhalation injuries as well. A total of twenty-four 
people were taken to the hospital by L.A. City Fire Department paramedics. Twenty others were reportedly treated 
at the scene. </p>
<p>The cause of the fire is still under investigation, according to fire department spokesman Michael Little. Little said that 
a total of sixteen apartments were destroyed by the fire, and that there was no evidence of working smoke detectors. 
He said that the fire was declared under control within an hour of it's inception, but not before the smoke and flames 
took their toll.  </p>

<HR>
<H3>QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT RABIN'S SECURITY...</H3>
<BR>
By Steve Macko
<BR>
One of the things that Israelis have taken pride in is the efficiency
of their security services.  Known throughout the world as being one of,
if not the, best.  In fact, no country emphasizes security as much as 
Israel.  Some questions have been raised and more are certain to be 
forthcoming about how a right-wing gunman could get within feet of the 
Prime Minister and be able to fire off three shots.  One senior Israeli
security official said, "This is a big blow for the Shabak."  The senior  
security official was referring to the renown Shin Bet, whose mission
is the internal security of Israel.  Shin Bet has a world reputation
for providing excellent security for its leaders and in preventing
terrorist attacks.  Their methods and tactics are textbook examples
for many security agencies in the world.
<P>
The Shin Bet has a special division that handles the security for the
prime minister and for other senior government officials.  This was the
first time that Shin Bet has ever lost a charge.  The unnamed senior
security official said, "There were obviously a lot of mistakes.  There's
going to be a big investigation."  After Rabin left the podium of the
huge peace rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday night and was moving toward
his car, the assassin fired three shots at him.  Rabin was struck twice
and the head of his security detail was reportedly hit in the shoulder.
It is being reported that the murderer, 25-year-old Yigal Amir, used a
9mm Beretta handgun.
<P>
A look back at the television tapes of the peace rally showed that
Rabin was being protected by just two bodyguards.  Witnesses said that
Amir emerged from a passageway at the back of a stage as the prime
minister was only a few steps from his armored car.
<P>
It is being reported that Rabin's security detail apparently mistook
Amir to be a VIP driver and this allowed the assassin to get close
enough to fire his deadly shots.
<P>
According to the Shin Bet's profile for a potential attacker, Yigal
Amir almost fit perfectly -- a fringe activist with no record of
previous violent bahavior.
<P>
A number of questions will be asked in the coming days.  Among them
are: How was an armed man allowed anywhere near the prime minister?
Why were certain standard security procedures not followed?  Why was
the prime minister not wearing a bullet-proof vest, which probably
would had saved his life?   Unfortunately, bullet-proof vests have
become the standard attire of many world leaders since the attempted
assassination attempts on U.S. President Ronald Reagan and 
Pope John Paul II.
<P>
One of the answers to the questions could be in the psychology of the
security detail.  The bodyguards may have been looking for an attack
coming from an Arab and not a Jew.  If this is true, then there was most 
certainly a breakdown in the evaluation of risk assessment.  This is 
because of the political turmoil that has been erupting in Israel during 
the past several months.  There has been physical attacks upon other
government officials in the past few months.  Including the Police
Minister being kicked by a Jewish protester.  Other recent physical 
attacks on Israeli government officials have included: the Environment
Minister's car being forced off a highway, the Education Minister was
punched in the stomach by an extremist, and the Housing Minister was
trapped by an angry crowd.  So, on a whole, the security detail should 
have realized that an attack by an Israeli was possible given the 
political climate in the country.
<P>
An author and expert on intelligence, Yossi Melman, said that the
security was "a total failure because the handwriting has been on the
wall for the past month."
<P>
Even though Israel is or was surrounded by enemies of the state,
politicians were always easily accessible to crowds of citizens and
politicians think of nothing when plunging into crowds to shake hands.
Something that is long gone from the American political scene, to a
great extent.
<P>
It has been reported that the prime minister's security detail had
recently been enlarged from its normal two or three bodyguards, which,
if true, is astonishing at such a low number.  The Mayor of Chicago
and the Governor of Illinois have larger security details than two
or three bodyguards and we will not even broach the subject of the
massive security detail of the President of the United States.
<P>
The former deputy head of the Shin Bet, Gideon Ezrach, said that when
Rabin had recently visited the town of Nablus on the West Bank, the
security detail was "more psychologically alert" then when they were
in Tel Aviv.  Ezrach also said, "I also think that we all did not
believe that such a thing could happen."  In Nablus, the security
detail was alert and focused on any threat that could come from
Palestinian militants.  Especially since Islamic extremists who are
very angry over the recent killing of Fathi Shakaki, the leader of the
Islamic Jihad, in Malta.
<P>
What must also be looked at is Rabin's attitude toward his own security.
In recent months, it was reported that the prime minister had been
heckled at and there were signs of hostility toward him by right-wingers
and some Jewish settlers.  But as Rabin, himself, recently said, "I am
concerned about the overall outlook but not on a personal basis."
<P>
One official said that the prime minister refused to wear a bullet-proof
vest.  Yossi Melman said that Shin Bet should have insisted that Rabin
wear one.  But a political professor at Hebrew University, Ehud Sprinzak,
said that Rabin would had refused in any case.  Sprinzak said, "We are
talking about a very old soldier who went through all kinds of dangers
in his life.  He did not consider an assassination a serious danger."
<P>
It is being reported that during the peace rally a journalist turned
to the prime minister's wife and asked her if Rabin was wearing a
bullet-proof vest.  Leah Rabin turned to the journalist in astonishment
and replied, "Why all of a sudden a protective vest?  Have you gone
crazy?  What are we ... in Africa?"  The journalist answered the prime
minister's wife saying that in light of recent threats, was she not
afraid that some lunatic would rush up and shoot Rabin?  Again, in
utter astonishment, Leah Rabin replied, 'Why all of a sudden protection?
What sort of protection?  That's ludicrous.  I don't understand the ideas 
you journalists have."
<P>
That exchange between the prime minister's wife and the journalist
tells a great deal. If one were to study the history of assassinations, as 
is taught to U.S. Secret Service agents, one would find some similarities
in the attitude of security between Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and
President John F. Kennedy.  It can be quite expected that the attitude 
of Rabin's successor toward his personal security will be different and 
there is talk that the next prime minister may not have much to say about 
how his security is handled, which assuredly will be enlarged.

<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><strong>Reporting Period: 7 AM EDT, September 4, 1996 to 7 AM EDT September 5, 1996</strong></font><br>
<br>
1. <font color="#0000FF"><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></font><br>
<br>
The National Weather Service advises that a large and dangerous hurricane continues to move toward the U.S.<br>
southeast coast. As of 0500 EDT September 5, Hurricane FRAN was located 260 miles southeast of Charleston,<br>
South Carolina, and was moving toward the northwest at 12 m.p.h. The hurricane has maximum sustained winds of<br>
115 m.p.h., making it a Category 3 storm, with further strengthening possible over the next 24 hours. Hurricane-force 
winds extend out 145 miles from the center, and tropical storm-force winds extend out 290 miles from the center. At this 
time Hurricane FRAN is about as large as Hurricane HUGO and has the potential to become just as strong.<br>
<br>
2. <font color="#0000FF"><strong>CURRENT SITUATION:</strong></font><br>
<br>
FEMA Headquarters: The Emergency Support Team (EST) began Level One operations (full staffing) as of 7:00 a.m., 
September 4, 1996. Director Witt had a conference call with the State Emergency Management Directors from Florida, 
Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina on Wednesday afternoon. He also spoke with Governors Miller (Georgia), 
Beasley (South Carolina) and Hunt (North Carolina) to update them on the Federal Government's preparedness actions. 
In addition Director Witt had phone conferences with each of the Congressional delegations from the three States. Finally, 
FEMA liaisons were dispatched to the State emergency operations centers in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North 
Carolina.<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Regional Activity: </font>The Atlanta Regional Operations Center (ROC) became operational at Level 1 at 7:00 a.m.<br>
EDT September 4 and began operating around the clock. Effective at 7:00 a.m. EDT September 5 the ROC will go<br>
to Level 3 activation. Regional ESFs #1 through #12 will support ROC operations 24-hours per day until further notice.<br>
<br>
The Emergency Response Team - Advance Element (ERT-A) is in position at the Georgia EOC. Regional Emergency<br>
Support Functions #2, #3, #5, #6, #7, #8, #10, #12 and the designated 1st US Army DCO/DCE will provide 
representation for the ERT-A at the Georgia EOC beginning at 10:00 a.m. EDT on September 5.<br>
<br>
The Emergency Response Team - Advance Element (ERT-A) is in position at the South Carolina EOC. An Advance<br>
Element of ERT-N-Red (ERT-N-Red-A) will be on site at the State EOC September 5. Regional ESFs #1 through #12<br>
and the designated 1st US Army DCO/DCE will report no later than 1:00 p.m. EDT, September 5 to the South<br>
Carolina EOC.<br>
<br>
The Region IV ROC will provide Mission Assignment Activation Letters and taskings to Federal agency<br>
representatives at the ROC and mail originals to agency offices. Two National Field Assessment Teams (FAsT)<br>
have been activated, and the East Team members will arrive in Columbia, South Carolina, on September 5. ,<br>
<br>
4. <font color="#0000FF"><strong>WEATHER FORECAST</strong></font><br>
<br>
The latest forecast track information from the National Hurricane Center brings the eye of the storm on land<br>
between Charleston, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina, Thursday night. A storm surge of 12 to<br>
16 feet is possible near and to the northeast of where the center makes landfall.<br>
<br>
A hurricane warning now extends north of Cape Lookout, North Carolina, to the Virginia border, including<br>
Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds. This replaces the hurricane watch that was in effect for most of this<br>
area. Hurricane warnings are now in effect from Brunswick, Georgia, north to Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds.<br>
<br>
A hurricane watch is in effect from north of the North Carolina-Virginia border to Chincoteague,<br>
Virginia, including the Greater Hampton Roads Area.<br>
<br>
There will be the possibility of isolated tornadoes over northeast North Carolina and eastern Virginia from<br>
Thursday evening into Friday as the first bands of precipitation arrive from FRAN. Rainfall amounts will<br>
depend on the exact track of the storm, but the potential exists for 1 to 3 inches of rain and locally<br>
higher amounts. A flash flood watch has already been issued for northeast North Carolina and may be needed<br>
for portions of eastern Virginia.<br>

FEMA is identifying and preparing to ship numerous Initial Response Resources (IRR) to support hurricane<br>
response efforts. These resources include tarpaulins, plastic sheeting, tents, cots, sleeping bags, blankets,<br>
emergency portable generators, flashlights and portable radios.<br>
<br>
A. <font color="#FF0000">Information and Planning Section </font><br>
(ESF #5) began operations on Wednesday, September 5, and prepared a late-afternoon briefing. It has been preparing 
daily situation reports, population maps of the affected areas and predicted hurricane tracks.<br>
<br>
1) Defense Coordinating Element<br>
<br>
The Department of Defense Liaison indicated that three mobilization points have been identified depending on where the 
hurricane hits. If FRAN makes landfall south of Charleston, South Carolina, the Base Support Installation (BSI) will be 
Fort Stewart, near Savannah, Georgia. If the hurricane makes landfall south of Camp Lejeune, South Carolina, the BSI will 
be Fort Jackson, Columbia, South Carolina. If the storm makes landfall north of Camp Lejeune, the BSI will be Fort<br>
Bragg, Fayetteville, North Carolina. Each base support installation requires habitability.<br>
<br>
After landfall, but prior to a Presidential Declaration, DOD will be ready to provide support under Section<br>
403 (C) of the Stafford Act. The DOD Director of Military Support will coordinate such support. It will<br>
consist of air transport for various kinds of response and support teams, telecommunications systems and other<br>
needed materiel.<br>
<br>
2) <font color="#FF0000">Operations Support Branch</font><br>

Fort Gillem, Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, Region III is arranging to provide drivers, tractors and trailers to load and move 
768 rolls of plastic sheeting from Thomasville, Georgia, to Fort Gillem.<br>
<br>
Region III staff has contacted 29 vendors in the Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina areas, and 25 of the vendors 
stated that they will be moving their equipment out of the affected areas until after the storm subsides. Once damages have 
been assessed, the vendors would be willing to assist. Four of the vendors are looking for drivers and trucks to handle this<br>
request. Sheila Madison will be on duty at 6 a.m. EDT September 6 to handle this problem.<br>

<br>
<font size=4><strong>News From Israel - Summary of Events - As of 21:40p.m. (Jerusalem time)</strong></font><br>
<br>
The following is a breakdown of the events based on the information available at this time. Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) 
Chief of Staff, Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin Shachak stated that additional debriefings will be held tonight to get to the facts 
pertaining to today's events in Ramallah.<br>
<br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> <strong>Ramallah</strong><br>
<br>
Today's &quot;demonstration&quot; began at the Ramallah campus of Bir Zeit University. The demonstration was organized by the 
Student Body, most of which is reported to identify with the Hamas terrorist organization. The demonstrators, numbering 
over 1,000,began what appeared to be a peaceful march, protesting Israel's opening of the archeological tunnel connecting 
the Temple Mount area to the Jewish Quarter of the Old City in Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
As the demonstrators approached the southern IDF checkpoint at the entrance to PLO-controlled Ramallah, adjacent to 
the Arak Checkpoint, the crowd became violent. Demonstrators began throwing rocks and bottles at the few IDF soldiers 
manning what is normally a quiet checkpoint. The soldiers called for backup units. They too were bombarded with 
hundreds of rocks and other projectiles.<br>
<br>
According to the IDF officers and soldiers on the scene, more than two PLO policemen opened fire in their direction. 
According to the IDF soldiers, only then did they open fire in return. At about 4:00pm, the situation escalated to a gun 
battle in the streets of Ramallah. PLO police fired their weapons, set on &quot;automatic,&quot; at the IDF soldiers. IDF soldiers 
pinpointed the source of the PLO gunfire. An elite IDF Commando Unit was brought in and they quickly took control of 
the building.<br>
<br>
The intermittent gun battles lasted throughout the late afternoon and early evening hours. At the end of the day's violence, at 
least 160 Arabs were reported injured, at least four of them in serious-to-critical condition, apparently from gunshot 
wounds. Three Arabs were killed. It appears they were PLO policemen but there are still contradictory statements 
concerning their identities.<br>
<br>
Ten IDF soldiers were injured by PLO gunfire. Three are listed in light-to-moderate condition and the remainder are 
classified in good condition. They were transported to Hadassah Hospital Trauma Center in Ein Kerem, Jerusalem. The 
Arab injured were transported to local Arab hospitals in PLO-controlled Ramallah.<br>
<br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> <strong>Jerusalem</strong><br>
<br>
Old City Hundreds of Arabs demonstrated and rioted in the vicinity of the Shchem (Damascus) Gate of Jerusalem's Old 
city. Jerusalem Police moved in quickly to prevent any serious rioting in the Old City. Shouts of &quot;Intifada&quot; were heard 
coming from rioting Arabs as they engaged Israeli security troops.<br>
<br>
The demonstrators engaged police, threw projectiles at them, and were eventually removed by force.<br>
<br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> <strong>Bet Lechem (Bethlehem)</strong><br>
<br>
As this report is being written, riots are still going on opposite Rachel's Tomb in Bet Lechem (Bethlehem). Three IDF 
soldiers were injured when a firebomb was thrown at them. They are reported in good condition in Hadassah Hospital.<br>
<br>
Arabs have set telephone poles, vehicles and other items on fire. Fire Department vehicles have responded and are 
attempting to contain the blazes. Hundreds of Arab rioters are throwing rocks and bottles at IDF troops and the area is 
sealed off and the IDF's attempting to take control.<br>
<br>
Arabs have fired live ammunition at IDF soldiers. No injuries from the gunfire have been reported so far.<br>
<br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> <strong>Tul Karem</strong><br>
<br>
Kalkilya Riots were reported in these PLO-controlled cities, as well. No injuries were reported and the situation in these 
areas was described as relatively light.<br>
<br>
<img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11><strong> Jericho</strong><br>
<br>
The PLO-controlled city of Jericho has been declared a Closed Military Zone by the IDF. Jews are prohibited from 
gaining access to the city, including the worshipers and Yeshiva students of the Shalom Al Yisroel Synagogue in the City.<br>
<br>
<strong><img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> A-Tur</strong><br>
<br>
Rioting is going on in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of A-Tur tonight. Fires are being intentionally set and IDF troops 
and police are being attacked by rocks and bottles. As of 9:00pm, the situation is not under control.<br>
<br>
<strong><img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Issawiya</strong><br>
<br>
Riots are taking place tonight as of the 9:00pm report in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Issawiya. Police have moved, 
in firing tear gas at rioting Arabs. No information regarding injuries or other details is available at this time.<br>
<br>
<strong><img src="Blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Lebanese/Israeli Border</strong><br>
<br>
Heavy fighting was reported today between Hezbollah guerillas and elements of the S. Lebanese army and the IDF. Some 
airstrikes and artillery fire were reported. Casualties are unknown at the time of this report, but sporadic firefights continue 
there.<br>

<P>
<H2>BULLS WIN CHAMPIONSHIP, PREDICTED UNREST BEGINS</H2>
By ENN News Team
<P>

Chicago, IL - Within minutes of the Bulls 99-98 victory over
the Phoenix Suns, gunshots and fireworks could be heard all
over the City of Chicago.  While much of the early noise
could be attributed to genuine celebration, it wasn't long
before the police scanner began to light up with with reports
of shots fired, with some at the police.  Seconds later,
reports were being received of large crowds of "youths"
blocking numerous intersections and stopping traffic.
<P>

Soon, reports of rocks and bottles being thrown at the police
at 23rd and State were received, followed by a request for a
"10-1" (officer needs assistance) at 75th and Coles.  Fires
were reportedly set at the disturbance at 75th and Coles, and
a second request for assistance was broadcast.  Concurrently,
police at 2240 S. State reported that they were "pinned down"
and being pelted with "rocks and bottles". At approximately
2120CDT, officers in the 2300 Block of S. State frantically
requested additional assistance and reported that they were
under fire.
<P>

Even though police and fire officials had planned extensively
for this eventuality, the frenzy of violence continued to
escalate.  Police reported that they were having great
difficulty controlling the intersection of Division and State
in Chicago's Rush Street area.  Mounted officers were quickly
dispatched to attempt to clear several downtown intersections
and several calls for "gas teams" were heard on police
frequencies.  The "gas teams" were Chicago Police officers
equipped with pepper-teargas dispensers that are used to
dispurse unruly crowds.
<P>

At 2130CDT, reports began to be received of "breaking into
stores" in the vicinity of 39th and Martin Luther King Drive,
62nd and Vernon, 66th and Cottage Grove, and in the 400 block
of E. 34th Street.  Although not specifically described as
"looting", the intensity and frequency of reports would
suggest that numerous "burglaries" were being committed. By
2140CDT, police and fire radios were alive with a constant
barrage of reports of mayhem.
<P>

At 2145CDT, a Chicago Fire Dept ambulance was dispatched to
Madison and Larramie for an unconfirmed report of a
"policeman shot".  Radio reports of sporadic violence
continued throughout the city.  Especially on Chicago's
Southside, numerous reports were received of "large crowds"
surging through neighborhoods, overturning cars, and setting
of fires in garbage cans and dumpsters.  Continued reports of
"shots fired" were heard on police radios, and at least one
police officer is known shot and transported to Michael Reese
Hospital.
<P>

Local television and radio stations appeared to be taking a
particularly conservative approach to coverage of the
"celebration".  Few, if any live pictures of any criminal
activities were being broadcast on any the network
affiliates.  Broadcasters on all of the local stations
continue to comment on the "general peacefulness" of
the Bull's fans, and show scenes of well-controlled
restaurants and bars.  In fact, no minicam reports were being
filed from any of the neighborhoods where police have
reported violence.  The only official statements being
transmitted by the media have emanated, so far, from Chicago Police
Headquarters at 11th and State.

<P>
To: All Our Friends and Business Associates <P>
FROM:   The Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute<BR>
The EmergencyNet NEWS Service<BR>
The Emergency BBS On-line Services<P>
At this year comes to a close, we wanted to take a few minutes to remember <BR>
the activities of 1995 and reflect on the support and encouragement that we have<BR>
received from so many people during the formative stages of our new business<BR>
endeavor.  In many cases, we certainly couldn't have accomplished what<BR>
we have, without the unique talents and abilities of our friends and associates.<P>
What makes this situation so noteworthy is the fact that most of the people in our<BR>
lives have significant responsibilities of their own, and yet they constantly take the <BR>
time to help, advise, and guide us through the trials and tribulations of everyday<BR>
life.  Time and time again, even in the midst of chaos and grief, those that are <BR>
important to us have been there when the chips were down.  We sincerely<BR>
wanted you to know how much we truly appreciate your time and efforts on<BR>
our behalf.<P>
1995 has been an extremely busy and challenging year for us, and am I am sure<BR>
for all of you.  And yet,  we are confidant that the coming years will prove to be the                 most rewarding of our lives.  Certainly, the past couple of years have been a period of transition that have tested our commitment to private enterprise and entrepreneurship. We continue to look forward to the challenge.<P>
<img src="xmaslt01.gif"align=right><P>
Thank you for your kindness, consideration, and support in the past year. Please 
accept our warmest wishes for a happy holiday season and a healthy and prosperous New Year. We will look forward to seeing/hearing from all of you 
in 1996. Please feel free to contact us if we may ever be of service.<P>
Clark Staten<BR>
Executive Director<BR>
Christmas, 1995 <BR>

<title>Intense Fighting in Israel - 2nd Day</title>

<p>SNS/ENN Special Report - Israel <br>
EmergencyNet News Service <br>
09/26/96 - 13:05CDT<br>
<br>
<font size=5><strong>Intense Fighting Continues; Tanks and Attack Helicopters Deployed</strong></font><br>
<br>
At least ten Israelis have been killed in today's violence. Most of them appear to be IDF soldiers and officers. At least 42 
other Israelis have been injured, 2 are reported by EMS sources to be in very critical condition, 11 in serious condition and 
the remainder are in light-to-moderate condition.<br>
<br>
According to PLO Authority sources, at least 8 Arabs have been killed and two hunbdred (200) injured in today's 
violence. No other information is available at this time.<br>
<br>
<img src="Redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> <font size=4><strong>Shchem (Nablus)</strong></font><br>
<br>
The IDF is moving into the vicinity of Joseph's Tomb in Shchem (Nablus) to extradite Israeli troops now trapped under a 
siege of PLO fire. There has been speculation that the IDF plans to pull out of Shchem following the rescue and abandon 
the Holy Site of Joseph's Tomb.<br>
<br>
The Council of Settlements of Judea, Samaria and Gaza (Yesha Council) has called on the government to not set a 
precedent and retreat under fire, leaving a Jewish Holy Site unprotected.<br>
<br>
This morning, Arabs attacked the site of Joseph's tomb and set an IDF vehicle on fire. The soldiers consolidated and took 
cover inside the site of Joseph's Tomb. The fighting escalated and the soldiers and some civilians are under siege in the site 
for hours. Most of today's fatalities were from the fighting at this site.<br>
<br>
As of 16:30 Israeli time, the IDF is moving in tanks and Cobra helicopters to free the Israelis pinned-down near Joseph's 
Tomb.<br>
<br>
<img src="Redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11><font size=4><strong> Gaza</strong></font><br>
<br>
About 2,000 Arabs came to the Erez Checkpoint this morning and began throwing stones at IDF soldiers. They then 
escalated to gunfire and the situation blew out of control. This is in addition to the fighting in the Community of Kfar Darom 
in Gush Katif.<br>
<br>
<img src="Redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11><font size=4><strong> Hevron </strong></font><br>
<br>
The rioting and attacks continue. A hand grenade was thrown at an IDF soldier stationed near the Maarat Hamachpelah 
(Cave of the Patriarchs).<br>
<br>
<img src="Redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> <font size=4><strong>PLO Radio </strong></font><br>
<br>
PLO Authority Radio has called on Arabs not to fire upon Israelis unless it is self- defense. PLO sources also report IDF 
tanks positioning at the Aram Junction, south of El-Bireh. This has not confirmed by IDF or independent sources.<br>
<br>
<img src="Redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> <font size=4><strong>Current Situation</strong></font><br>
<br>
Fighting is still reported in East Jerusalem and throughout Judea, Samaria and Gaza. As reported earlier, all of Yesha has 
been classified as an Emergency Zone by Defense Minister Mordechai. Prime Minister Netanyahu is on his way back from 
Germany and it is expected he will call an emergency meeting of senior security officials upon his arrival.<br>
<br>
IDF helicopters are being used to rescue Israeli troops in Gaza. Armored vehicles are being deployed in Shchem. Mention 
has also been made of attack helicopters being deployed in Gaza but no details have been furnished. Tanks are also being 
deployed in the area of Ramallah, Bet El (adjacent to PLO-cntrolled Ramallah) and Aram Junction (south of 
El-Bireh/Ramallah area).<br>
<br>
<img src="Redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> <font size=4><strong>Tomorrow's Concerns</strong></font><br>
<br>
The PLO Authority Council has declared tomorrow a day of mourning for the fallen. All Arabs living in Judea, Samaria and 
Gaza were called on to participate in the day's general strike and to hold memorial vigils to coincide with the prayer 
services on the Temple Mount in the Al Aksa Mosque. Local sources tell ENN that they fear that the violence will continue 
to escalate as additional funerals and demonstrations are held.<br>
<br>
<img src="Redtrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> <font size=4><strong>Late News</strong></font><br>
<br>
In Ramallah, at approx. 16:30pm, IDF attack helicopters are reportedly firing upon Arab rioters in an attempt to restore 
order to the area.<br>

<H3>The World's Finest Protection for America's Greatest People</H3>
<P>
3D Medical, Inc. is proud to announce the availability of a new level of personal protection for medical and emergency response workers.  The innovative new product is a high-risk, powder-free, non-allergenic, non-slip latex examination glove. It is the ultimate in protection against both blood borne pathogens and latex protein allergies.
<P>
The new 3D Medical gloves are 10mils in thickness, to afford the wearer an additional measure of protection, while maintaining the maximum sensitivity possible. They are certified to a 1% pinhole level (AQL) to assure the denial of entry of pathogens, and they exceed FDA and ASTM requirements for medical grade exam gloves. The gloves are manufactured to ISO-9000 standards, which are stronger than FDA or ASTM standards for medical grade gloves.
<P>  
In a recent clinical study, conducted by Dr. E. Marcia Boyer of the University of Iowa, 3D Medical's gloves showed a marked decrease in wearer allergic sensitivity. 85% of the previously allergic people, participating in the study, noted a decrease in both the number and intensity of dermatological signs and symptoms when wearing 3D Medical gloves. 3D medical gloves are triple-leached and chlorinated to assure the removal of hand irritating proteins and micro-organisms.
<P>
According to 3D's Ralph Dahm, the high-risk gloves are extremely durable and feature a non-slip finish that will allow emergency and medical professionals to grasp and hold syringes, vacu-tainers, dressings and other equipment, even when they are wet or bloody. Dahm also said that the gloves have a beaded cuff for strength and that they are designed to reduce hand fatigue when worn for extended periods of time. And, 3D Medical gloves are 100% guaranteed to be free of defects.
<P>
The gloves are available in Small, Medium, Large, and Extra-large.
<P>
<B>3D MEDICAL, Inc. is happy to announce a special 10% discount to all ERRI/3DMedical Website users.</B> This discount for all its High Risk 10 mil Powderfree Latex Exam Gloves designed for emergency service applications.

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p><font color="#0000FF"><font size=5>FEMA FINAL SITUATION REPORT</font><font size=2> </font><font size=5>--Hurricane Bertha</font></font><br>
Reporting Period: from <font color="#FF0000">7 a.m., July 12, 1996 to 7 a.m. July 13, 1996</font> <br>
(All times not otherwise stated are Eastern Daylight Times)<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></font><strong> </strong>The National Weather Service Office in Wilmington, NC, indicated that the center of 
Hurricane Bertha made landfall at approximately 4:45 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) at Wrightsville Beach, 
about five miles east of Wilmington, NC. Hurricane force winds of 105 mph impacted the area from Cape Fear 
to New River Inlet, including Surf City. At 3:00 am EDT, the center of now Tropical Storm Bertha was located 
near latitude 36.7 north and longitude 77.0 west or about 45 miles west-southwest of Norfolk, Virginia. 
Maximum sustained winds have diminished to near 65 mph mainly in squalls over the coastal waters. Bertha is 
moving toward the north-northeast at about 18 mph. This motion is expected to bring the center of Bertha near 
the southern Chesapeake Bay of Virginia early this morning. Continued weakening is expected today as Bertha 
travels over land. Tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 230 miles mainly to the east of the center.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">CURRENT SITUATION</font>: The National Emergency Response Team (ERT-N) Red Team has been ordered to 
stand down from an alert status. The alert notification was first issued 7/9/96.<br>
<br>
The North Carolina Division of Emergency Management estimates 250,000 people have evacuated. South 
Carolina officials estimate 500,000 of their citizens have left their homes. The Federal Highway Administration 
(FHA) reports that evacuations have progressed smoothly.<br>
<br>
The ERT-A on station in Columbia, SC, reports that National Guard helicopters will carry Preliminary Damage 
Assessment Teams (PDA) into storm-damaged South Carolina communities Saturday morning, July 13.<br>
<br>
The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), administered by FEMA, shows 42,529 flood insurance 
policies in force in North Carolina and 87,152 in South Carolina. NFIP officials have asked the underwriting 
associations in both States to put a single-adjuster program into effect, so that a single insurance adjuster can 
visit a property and verify both wind damage and flood damage.<br>
<br>
United States Virgin Islands (USVI) Disaster Field Office (DFO) personnel: FEMA employees - 11; DAE 
reservists - 35; Local hires - 0; Other Federal agencies - 12. There are two Recovery Centers on St. Thomas, 
one on St. John, and one on St. Croix.<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">CASUALTIES</font>: Six storm related injuries were reported at the Camp LeJeune Marine Base, two of whom 
remained hospitalized Friday.<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">WEATHER FORECAST</font>: Bertha has been downgraded to a tropical storm and has prompted the issuance of 
tropical storm warnings from the North Carolina-Virginia border to Rhode Island. Coastal storm surge flooding 
of 3 to 5 feet above normal tide is expected in areas of onshore winds to the east of the center. In addition, 
battering waves will occur on top of the storm surge. The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 Mb at 
29.35 inches. There is the possibility of isolated tornadoes along the path of Bertha. Rainfall totals of 4 to 6 
inches with the possibility of flash floods are expected along the path of Bertha.<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><strong>SEVERITY OF IMPACT ON POLITICAL JURISDICTIONS</strong></font>:<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">North Carolina:</font> Significant damage along the coastal and sound areas in the Wilmington, NC, area and 
northward. Heavy flooding along the coastal and near inland areas of the State. The North Carolina Division of 
Emergency Management estimates 250,000 people evacuated ahead of the hurricane. Estimates are 186,000

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p><font color="#0000FF"><font size=6>Hurricane Bertha Update 3</font></font><br>
<br>
The situation in brief as of <font color="#FF0000">6:00 p.m. Tuesday, July 9:</font><br>
<br>
The interagency Emergency Support Team (EST) remains on 24-hour duty at Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) headquarters in Washington, working with emergency response personnel in the field to 
deploy necessary resources to the Virgin Islands and continuing contingency planning for a possible East Coast 
landfall by Hurricane Bertha. The EST, led by FEMA, coordinates all federal disaster response and recovery 
efforts. <br>
<br>
FEMA's national Emergency Response Team (Red), remains on alert for possible deployment on the East 
Coast. It is one of three 100-plus-member teams available for deployment to a catastrophic disaster when 
FEMA's regional emergency response teams are committed to disaster operations within their own jurisdictions. <br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">FEMA's Field (damage) Assessment Team in the U.S. Virgin Islands was demobilized and departed St. 
Thomas at 11:00 a.m. this morning. It will be staged in Thomasville, Ga., in readiness for a possible East Coast 
response.</font><br>
<br>
Today FEMA officials joined U.S.V.I Governor Roy Schneider and Maj. Gen. Rudolfo Francis, commander of 
the U.S.V.I. National Guard, for an aerial inspection of hurricane damage on the islands. They reported homes 
repaired following Hurricane Marilyn had kept their roofs, but those whose owners had delayed making repairs 
had lost their protective plastic tarps and suffered further damage from this storm.<br>
<br>
Electric power has been fully restored on St. John and St. Croix and is steadily being restored on St. Thomas. 
Water and sewage systems are becoming operational as the power is restored.<br>
<br>
Federal disaster officials on St. Thomas confirmed that there is an 8-week supply of food in the U.S.V.I., much 
of it in the form of military AMeals, Ready to Eat@ shipped to the islands during the Hurricane Marilyn 
response last year.<br>
<br>
Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rosello and FEMA officials today conducted a flyover inspection of damaged areas of 
that island, reporting that roads are clear from the eastern end of the island to San Juan. <font color="#FF0000">The Governor earlier 
told FEMA Director James Lee Witt that Puerto Rico's own resources are sufficient to meet its needs from this 
storm.</font> <br>

<title>California Counties Declared Flood Disaster</title>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE-EMERGENCYNET NEWS-02/13/92-1630CST </p>
<p><font size=6>LOS ANGELES &amp; VENTURA COUNTIES 
DECLARED DISASTER AREAS </font></p>
<p>By Clark Staten </p>
<p>Los Angeles, CA - California Governor Pete Wilson today declared Los Angeles and Ventura counties 
as state disaster areas due to the third major rain storm to strike Southern California in the past four 
days. Fire, EMS, and Rescue operations are described as continuing at a &quot;frantic pace&quot;, according to a 
high-ranking Los Angeles City EMS official. </p>
<p>According to Governor Wilson, &quot;Clearly a state of immediate peril to lives and property exists...the 
damage in these areas is extreme and impossible to measure at this point in time&quot;. By 4:00 p.m. 
Wednesday, 2.07 inches of rain had fallen in Ventura, CA, further destabilizing the already satuarated 
hill sides and prompting fears of mudslides. In Los Angeles, the National Weather Service reports that 
as much as 4.00 inches of rain has fallen there in the past two days. Yesterday, the Ventura River was 
reported &quot;out of it's banks&quot; and was said to have &quot;swallowed&quot; a mobile home park. </p>
<p>According to U.S. Coast Guard officials, a Marine CH-46 Air- Sea rescue helicopter on a mission, also 
crashed into the rugged hills of Northern Ventura and one person is missing from the copter and 
presumed dead. Eight others were rescued from the crash site and were transported to the St. John's 
Regional Trauma Center, where their condition is unconfirmed at the time of this report. </p>
<p>According to Ojai, CA. Fire/Rescue officials and the Ventura County Sheriff's office, a couple was 
killed there yesterday at approximately 7:00 a.m., by a mudslide driven boulder which struck their home. 
According to a neighbor, the woman involved in this incident was pregnant and the unborn baby was 
also killed. Rescuers say that the boulder was lossened by torrential rains that have continued in that 
area for the past three days. </p>
<p>A neighbor described the sound of the mudslide as &quot;fearsome&quot; and that it sounded like &quot;thunder&quot; when it 
struck the side of the house were the people were killed. Mark Baker, the neighbor, is quoted as saying; 
&quot;There was screaming coming from the house just after the slide...then you couldn't hear anything&quot;. A 
newsman on the scene described the neighbors in the vicinity as be extremely distraught over the deaths 
of the well-liked couple. </p>
<p>Los Angeles and Ventura County fire departments and Emergency Medical Service agencies are said to 
be working at maximum capacity as the magnitude of the incident continues to become evident. 
Reportedly, Ventura County Rescue helicopters have removed more than 100 people from car and 
rooftops as the rapidly rising flood waters engulfed entire neighborhoods. </p>
<p>Rescue workers are said to be still searching the Los Angeles river near Van Nuys, CA. for the body of 
a 15 year-old boy that had fallen into the swiftly rushing water. Reportedly, Firefighters had twice 
attempted to rescue the youngster with a thrown flotation device yesterday, without success. The boy 
was tentatively identified as Adam Bischoff of that city. Another man was also reported lost in the 
Huntington Park area by Los Angeles County Fire Officials; he was last seen in the vicinity of Compton 
Blvd. and the Los Angeles River. </p>
<p>In Orange County, CA., flooding is also said to be extensive. An Orange County Fire Spokesman said, 
however, that no known loss of life has occured there. He did indicate that all available personnel were 
being utilized to help beleaguered homeowners with flooded property. Areas as far north as Kern 
County and Bakersfield, CA. were said to be evacuating residents because of fears of mudslides and 
additional flooding. </p>
<p>The California Highway Patrol says that many mudslides have struck the Pacific Coast Highway and 
Highway 101, making travel almost impassable in some parts of the area. They also admitted that the 
weather and disruptions of traffic patterns may slow the rescue efforts in some areas. The Patrol also 
reported the storm-related death of one man in a traffic accident on Interstate 5 near the town of Lepec, 
CA.. Many other canyon roads were reported completely covered by mud and debris. </p>
<p>California meteorologists are said to be predicting the possibilty of another major wave of rain and wind 
to follow the now near-record rainfalls that have recently occured. An additional Pacific Ocean storm is 
said to be forming off the California Coast. It is raining in Los Angeles at the time of this report, and it 
could continue for as much as another forty-eight hours, according to sources at the National Weather 
Service. Numerous government and emergency officials are said to be requesting &quot;real-time&quot; weather 
updates from the forecasters, out of fear of worsening conditions. </p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><font size=5><strong>TIPS FOR THE CARE OF WATER-DAMAGED FAMILY 
HEIRLOOMS AND OTHER VALUABLES</strong></font></font><br>
<br>
WASHINGTON July 19, 1996 -- Following a disaster, people often lose family heirlooms and other valuables to 
water damage. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has obtained general 
information/recommendations from the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC) 
and the National Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Property (NIC) for homeowners regarding the recovery of 
water-damaged belongings.<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><font size=5><strong>Ten Tips for the Homeowner:</strong></font></font><br>
<br>
1. If the object is still wet, rinse with clear, clean water or a fine hose spray. Clean off dry silt and debris from your 
belongings with soft brushes or dab with damp cloths without grinding debris into objects.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Air dry objects indoors if possible. Sunlight and heat may dry certain materials too quickly, causing splits, 
warpage, and buckling.</p>
<hr>
<p>3. The best way to inhibit growth of mold and mildew is to reduce humidity. Increase air flow with fans, open 
windows, air conditioners, and dehumidifiers. </p>
<hr>
<p>4. Remove heavy deposits of mold growth from walls, baseboards, floors, and other household surfaces with 
commercially available disinfectants. Avoid the use of disinfectants on historic wallpapers. </p>
<hr>
<p>5. If objects are broken or begin to fall apart, place all broken pieces, bits of veneer, and detached parts in clearly 
labeled open containers. Do not attempt to repair objects until completely dry or, in the case of important materials, 
until you have consulted with a professional conservator.</p>
<hr>
<p>6. Documents, books, photographs and works of art on paper may be extremely fragile when wet; use caution when 
handling. Free the edges of prints and paper objects in mats and frames, if possible. These should be allowed to air 
dry. Rinse mud off wet photographs with clear water, but do not touch surfaces. Sodden books and papers should 
also be air dried, or may be kept in a refrigerator or freezer until they can be treated by a professional conservator. </p>
<hr>
<p>7. Textiles, leather, and other &quot;organic&quot; materials will also be severely affected by exposure to water and should be 
allowed to air dry. </p>
<hr>
<p>8. Remove wet paintings from the frame but not from the stretcher. Air dry, face up, away from direct sunlight.</p>
<hr>
<p>9. Furniture finishes and painting surfaces may develop a white haze or bloom from contact with water and humidity. 
These problems do not require immediate attention. Consult a professional conservator for treatment.</p>
<hr>
<p>10. Rinse metal objects exposed to flood waters, mud, or silt with clear water and dry immediately with a clean, soft 
cloth. Allow heavy mud deposits on large metal objects, such as sculpture, to dry. Caked mud can be removed later. 
Consult a professional conservator for further treatment. </p>
<hr>
<p>Because the information given above is general, FEMA, AIC and NIC strongly recommend that professional 
conservators be consulted as to the appropriate method of treatment for historic objects. Professional conservators 
may be contacted through the FREE Conservation Services Referral System of the American Institute for 
Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, 1717 K Street, NW, Ste. 301, Washington, DC 20006; (202) 
452-9545; fax: (202) 452-9328. Based on a complete description of the artifact, a computer-generated list of 
conservators will be compiled and grouped geographically, by specialization, and by type of service provided. <br>

<font color="#0000FF"><font size=5>SITUATION REPORT #2 HURRICANE BERTHA</font></font><br>
<br>
Reporting Period:<font color="#FF0000"> 6 p.m, EDT July 8 - 6 a.m. EDT July 9, 1996</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><font size=4>BACKGROUND: </font></font>At approximately 3 a.m. EDT, July 9, 1996, Hurricane Bertha became a Category III 
hurricane, with maximum sustained winds near 115 mph. Some fluctuations in strength are possible today. At 
about 8 p.m., July 8, 1996, Hurricane Bertha passed over the Virgin Islands (USVI) and moved on a path 
taking it about 70 miles north of San Juan, and 80 miles Northeast of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico (PR). It is currently 
located near Latitude 20.7 N; Longitude 68.4 W. or about 180 miles east-southeast of Turks Island. Present 
movement is toward the WNW at about 18 mph. A gradual turn towards the northwest is expected during the 
next 24-hours. Although the current forecast for Hurricane Bertha potentially threatens Florida by late 
Wednesday night or early Thursday morning, two computer models suggest the possibility of more of a 
northward turn into a possible weakness in the subtropical high pressure ridge. Thus, there is a distinct hope that 
it will recurve without making landfall on the U.S. </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">As of 11 p.m. July 8,</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><font size=4>CURRENT SITUATION:</font></font><br>

<br>
The <font color="#FF0000"><font size=3>situation in brief as of 7:00 p.m. Friday, July 12:</font></font><br>
<br>
The 70-member interagency Emergency Support Team (EST) at Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) headquarters in Washington, D.C. remains on 24-hour duty to respond to Hurricane Bertha's landfall 
on the East Coast. The EST, led by FEMA, coordinates all federal disaster response and recovery efforts. It 
includes representatives of the 12 key federal response agencies in addition to FEMA and, in this case, the 
National Weather Service.<br>
<br>
Advance elements of three regional Emergency Response Teams (ERT-As) are likewise operating around the 
clock in the states expected to be most affected by Hurricane Bertha initially: the Region VIII (Denver) ERT-A 
is in Columbia, S.C.; the ERT-A from Region VI (Dallas) is in Raleigh, N.C.; and the ERT-A from FEMA 
Region III (Philadelphia) is in Richmond, Va. The Region X (Seattle) ERT-A remains on alert.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">The 130-plus members of FEMA's national Emergency Response Team (ERT-N) &quot;Red Team,&quot; however, who 
had been on alert since Tuesday morning, were ordered to stand down by FEMA Director James Lee Witt a 
short while ago.</font> The Red Team is one of three national teams that deploy to a catastrophic disaster.<br>
<br>
Regional Operations Centers at FEMA Region IV headquarters in Atlanta and Region III headquarters in 
Philadelphia remain on 24-hour duty.<br>
<br>
FEMA's advance Emergency Response team (ERT-A) on station in Columbia, S.C., reports that <font color="#FF0000">National 
Guard helicopters will carry preliminary damage assessment teams into storm-damaged South Carolina 
communities Saturday morning, July 13.</font><br>
<br>
The ERT-A in South Carolina confirms that an estimated 500,000 residents of that state were evacuated before 
Bertha's landfall. Sixty-eight American Red Cross shelters are currently open, but occupants reportedly already 
are becoming anxious to return to their homes.<br>
<br>
The ERT-A on station in Raleigh, N.C., currently totals more than 100 FEMA staff and seven representatives 
of other federal response agencies. It reports that 94 Red Cross shelters are currently open in <font color="#FF0000">North Carolina, 
housing 1,920 evacuees. The ERT-A says preliminary damage assessments will also begin in that state on 
Saturday morning.</font><br>
<br>
The U.S. Coast Guard will close the port of Hampton Roads, Va., at 8 p.m. Friday, July 12, as a safety 
precaution. No vessels may enter, leave or move within the port until at least 4 a.m. Saturday or possibly longer.<br>
<br>
The Food and Commodity Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is the principal source of 
food for emergency shelters in the affected area, most of which are in schools. Substantial food supplies are 
already stocked in the schools through USDA's school nutrition program.<br>
<br>
Data from the National Flood Insurace Program (NFIP), which is administered by FEMA, show 42,529 flood 
insurance policies in force in North Carolina and 87,152 policies in South Carolina. NFIP officials have asked 
the underwriting associations in both states to put a single-adjustor program into effect, so that a single insurance 
adjustor can visit a property and verify both wind damage (covered under homeowners policies) and flood 
damage (covered under flood insurance policies) at the same time, in order to speed the claims process for 
victims of Hurricane Bertha.<br>
<br>
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) teams are on station in the affected areas, awaiting Saturday's 
damage assessments. They will visit damaged commercial facilities and public utilities, looking for oil spills and 
other hazardous wastes. The EPA will be working closely with the U.S. Public Health Service to determine 
water quality and working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on proper disposal of storm debris.<br>
<br>
U.S. Department of Energy staff are on alert pending Saturday's assessments of damage to electric power 
plants and other utilities.<br>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><font size=5>VIRGIN ISLANDS DECLARED MAJOR DISASTER AREA IN 
THE WAKE OF HURRICANE BERTHA</font></font><br>
<br>
WASHINGTON July 11, 1996 -- The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 
announced today that federal disaster funds have been made available for the U.S. Virgin Islands to aid the 
recovery of residents victimized by Hurricane Bertha.<br>
<br>
FEMA Director James Lee Witt said the assistance was authorized by President Clinton under the major 
disaster declaration issued for the territory this evening. The President took the action after FEMA reported that 
at least 1,400 homes sustained damage from Bertha which buffeted the territory last Monday with winds in 
excess of 85 miles an hour.<br>
<br>
Immediately after the declaration, Witt designated the islands of St. Croix, St. John and St. Thomas eligible for 
federal funding to supplement the recovery needs of affected residents and business owners. <br>
<br>
The supplemental assistance, to be coordinated by FEMA, can include grants to help pay for temporary housing 
needs, minor home repairs and other serious disaster-related expenses. Low-interest loans from the U.S. Small 
Business Administration also will be available to cover uninsured private and business property losses.<br>
<br>
In addition, Witt said federal funds will be provided for the territory and affected local governments to pay 75 
percent of the eligible cost for debris removal, emergency services related to the hurricane, and approved 
projects that reduce future disaster risks. Witt added that damage surveys are continuing and other forms of 
assistance may be designated based on the assessments. <br>
<br>
Barbara Russell, of FEMA's regional office in New York City, was named by Witt to coordinate the federal 
relief effort. Russell said that residents and business owners who sustained hurricane losses can begin the 
disaster application process immediately by calling 1-800-462-9029, or 1-800-462-7585 (TDD) for the 
hearing and speech impaired. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (EDT) seven 
days a week until further notice.<br>
<br>
Russell said that those who received assistance for Hurricane Marilyn last year are eligible to apply again for 
Hurricane Bertha losses. However, under FEMA's policy on duplication of benefits, grants for home repairs will 
be restricted to applicants who can verify that repair work from assistance received for Hurricane Marilyn has 
been either totally or partially completed.<br>
<br>
To qualify, Russell said that eligible applicants must show receipts for FEMA funds spent on completed repairs, 
or present the balance of unspent funds if the work has not been completed. Damage surveys following Bertha 
revealed that the most severely affected homes were those that had not undertaken permanent repairs. <br>
<br>
Home repair grants are provided as part of FEMA's Disaster Housing Assistance program. For Hurricane 
Marilyn, FEMA reported that housing assistance to date has been provided to some 14,800 individuals and 
families at a cost of more than $65 million. Of that total, $53.379 million has been disbursed to 8,239 qualified 
applicants for home repairs. <br>

<H3>The International Fire Service Instructor Exchange Program</H3>
<P>

No one country has a monopoly on the best practices and procedures when
it comes to saving lives. We have much to learn from each other.  The
Alliance For Fire and Emergency Management recognizes this and is
developing an international instructor exchange program.
<P>
<HR>

Jack Welch, CEO of General Electric, puts it like this:
<BR>

"In the environment of the 1990s, globalization must be taken for granted.
There will only be one standard for corporate success: international market
share.  Success within a particular country will not even guarantee corporate
survival.  The winning corporations--those which can dictate their
destiny--will win by finding markets all over the world. "
<P>
<HR>

While corporate America is fighting for economic survival, the fire service
is fighting for the survival of innocent victims of fire, most of whom are
children or the elderly. Doesn't it make sense that we should be just as
aggressive in pursuing answers, training techniques and technologies
internationally which could be instrumental in saving lives?
<P> 

The International Fire Service Instructor Exchange program has been
developed to bring together the most elite and knowledgeable fire service
instructors from around the world to share their experience and expertise. 
This program is the first and only one of its kind designed especially for 
fire and emergency service training professionals.  The value of this program
can be seen by the commitments to participate already made by some of the
world's leading fire service training experts such as:
<P>
<HR>  

Jeff Godfredson, Metropolitan Fire Brigades Board, Melbourne, Australia
<BR>
Frank David, Commandant, Fire Service College, Gloucestershire, England
<BR>
Kennie Thorn, Deputy Director, Swedish Rescue Services Agency, Karlstad,
Sweden
<BR>
Alan Walker, Director, Louisiana State University, Firemen Training
Program, Baton Rouge, Louisiana
<BR>
Steve Edwards, Director, Maryland Fire & Rescue Institute, College Park,
Maryland
<BR>
Ronald Hopkins, Professor, Eastern Kentucky University, Richmond,
Kentucky
<BR>
<P>
<HR>

In order to make this program as feasible as possible for instructors to
participate, we are looking at a very short term of two weeks for each
exchange, although we will make it possible for this period to be extended
as necessary depending upon the nature of the course and the availability of
the instructors.
<P>

The goal of The Alliance is to raise enough funds so every instructor
participating will have their round-trip air-fare paid for and will also have
a per diem allowance for their meals. We do not want to see fire service
instructors barred from participating in this exchange program because they
can't afford it.  Instructors will be chosen by an independent instructor
selection committee based on their area of professional expertise, their
career background and qualifications. A needs assessment identifying the
training needs and strengths from each of the participating organizations is
currently in process. This is a proactive approach to ensure that this
program is as value-packed as possible.
<P>

This program will establish a forum for the free exchange of best educational
programs and instructors between participating countries.  The end results
of this program will be the development and application of new training
techniques and technologies from around the world which will be instrumental
in saving lives and property. The front lines of fire fighting are not
found in the heat of the fireground, they're found in the classroom, where
firefighters are taught the skills they need to survive and to save lives and
property.  That's why this program is aimed at instructors.
<P>

Alliance, please mail or fax a brief letter with your name, address and phone

<title>TWA 800; Get Your Stories Straight -OP-ED</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<p><font size=3>Excerpted from the ENN Daily Report - Nov. 17, 1996 - Vol. 2, No. 322</font></p>
<p><font size=5><strong>TWA-800, Get Your Stories Straight! ...</strong></font><br>
<em><strong>Op-ed </strong></em>by Jeremy Zakis, ENN Australian Correspondent<br>
<br>
Since July the 17th of this year, when I received a News Flash from ENN stating that an aircraft, TWA-800 had exploded 
over Long Island and have been following this story with great interest ever since. Being interested in aviation and a starting 
out pilot myself, naturally I feel a sense of need to find out what exactly happened on that fateful night 13,000 feet above 
the ocean. Living in Australia we often get a filtered version of news stories from other parts of the world, this case being 
no different. Hearing however the latest reports about the investigation I have been somewhat confused by what people are 
saying about the causes of this crash.<br>
<br>
At first I thought because of my limited understanding of aircraft accidents like this, maybe I was just inexperienced to 
properly analyse the facts being given to me. But after discussing it with other aviation buffs and people who have taken an 
interest to this one, I have found I am by far not alone.<br>
<br>
Theories about 'friendly fire' downing the jet, 'terrorist fire', 'terrorist bombs', explosions in the fuel tank and even one that 
suggests a fractured cargo door may have been the cause, all come together to cause a mess of hypothesis and 
possibilities. We have all heard former Kennedy aide Salinger go public with the charge that a naval vessel in the missile 
testing area TWA-800 was overflying at the time, accidentally fired a shot that hit the 747. </p>
<p>As has been reported the document his allegations were based upon was brought to his attention by a Secret Service agent 
in Paris, and is posted on the Internet. Reading the article left me with more doubts about this theory than support for it. 
The reasons why I will not go through in detail because Chief Military Analyst of the INTELLIGYST Group, Ron Lewis, 
has already summed up well the faults in a three part article sent through ENN earlier this week (Debunking The Friendly 
Fire Myth 10/11/96).<br>
<br>
Whose to say however that it wasn't a friendly fire incident? That a major cover-up isn't occurring to protect the 
government? Early August I heard an analyst say that if it was a case of an American missile downing the jet, we would 
never hear about it, is this the case now? Evidence at the moment is scarce, but I challenge anyone to find any actual hard 
evidence of this being a possibility.<br>
<br>
The other theory, a terrorist act. So far no real evidence has come to light that can be proof without a doubt that this was 
the cause. Sure traces of explosives such as PETN and RDX were found in the wreckage, both types apparently found in 
many terrorist bombs and air-to-air missiles. But just when it looked almost certain to be a terrorist act, the FBI disclosed 
that the same aircraft had been used in an explosives training exercise with those types of explosives. Also that the aircraft 
had been used to transport troops to the gulf during the Gulf War in 1991. The terrorist theory had been counteracted, but 
not completely disregarded.<br>
<br>
As for mechanical failure, the latest is that the explosion on board was centred around the front of the main fuel tank, near 
the left fuel probe. No sign of electronic arcing was found but that does not rule out a small electrical spark occurring from 
a faulty probe. If a spark had've occurred, it would have caused a low velocity explosion amongst the fuel vapours, 
consistent with the physics involved in the explosion believed to a occurred.<br>
<br>
Three possible theories, with three different groups supporting each. Unfortunately it is those who support the terrorist 
theories who gain the most attention because of the general appeal to the public, everybody likes a murder mystery. I have 
seen many pages on the Internet that are devoted to blaming groups involved in the 'shootdown', people who are angered 
by the belief that they think a government cover-up is involved, but not surprisingly I found only one page devoted to 
looking at the mechanical failure theory. Which in my opinion was easier for me to believe than the other so called 'truth of 
TWA-800' pages. Like I have said before, I would challenge these people to verify their sources, check out all the details 
because in reality all they are doing is confusing the public on this matter. If you wish to convince me of a certain possibility, 
feel free to e-mail me at: dainis@mtc.bns.com.au. I will look forward to hearing from you.<br>
<br>
But until then, the moral of my report is that half-truth theories when in the hands of public figures such as Mr. Pierre 
Salinger, can mislead the general population and disrupt the official investigation which often comes under questioning 
following these incidents. In the case of TWA-800, because of the loss of 229 lives, it is in poor taste to hinder an 
investigation for the cause of the accident by making accusations that are not substantiated.<br>

<font color="#0000FF"><font size=5>Music City USA</font></font><br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><strong>Big things are stirring in Music City....</strong><br>
<br>
For the city that was country before it was cool, music is the keynote in its roster of activities. Renovations to the 
Ryman Auditorium, known as the &quot;Mother Church of Country Music,&quot; have restored the concert hall to its former 
glory days when it was the city's premier performance facility and later the home of the Grand Ole Opry. We'll keep 
you updated as 1997 show dates are announced.<br>
<br>
The District, a 16 square block in the heart of downtown, keeps bringing people back with more to do during the 
day and into the night. Planet Hollywood lands in The District with movie memorabilia and merchandise as well as 
the Apple Strudel that made Mother Schwarzenegger famous way before her son hit it the big time. Having the blues 
is a good thing as B.B. King's Blues Club and Restaurant brings &quot;the world's premier blues address&quot; to Lower 
Broadway. With dozens of shops, restaurants, and clubs, The District has something for everyone.<br>
<br>
Don't forget Music Row ! Fabulous food and shopping surround the Country Music Hall of Fame, a &quot;must see&quot; for 
all music lovers. Other possibilities include a stop at Barbara Mandrels Museum, or the recording studios of RCA, 
Warner Brothers, United Artists Arista, MCA, or Columbia.<br>
<br>
Speaking of shopping...<br>
In addition to shops in The District and Music Row, Nashville has a &quot;new&quot; mall. Located off I-440, 100 Oaks, 
Nashville's very first mall, was recently made contemporary with a massive renovation that transformed it into a 
750,000 square-foot, value-oriented upscale shopping center with stores like Saks Off Fifth, Luxury Linens, and 
Media Play. Don't miss it!<br>
<br>
Opryland USA ....<br>
A destination in itself. Located approximately 15 minutes from downtown Nashville is the fabulous Opryland Hotel 
and Theme Park. From the spectacular 4.5 acre indoor water gardens to the specialty restaurants and shops, this 
1,800 room hotel is Southern hospitality at its grandest. Spend an afternoon at the Springhouse Golf Club, or cruising 
on the General Jackson, the world's largest showboat. Close out your day with a visit to the Grand Ole Opry, the 
tradition continues today in what has become Opryland USA.</font><br>

 <center><H2>A Message from the Webmaster</H2></center>
<P>
<B>As much as it troubles us to do so, we find it necessary to discuss the issue of financial support with you, our esteemed readers, observers, and participants. It is our first priority to make this resource available to everyone from the emergency response community, and those with an interest in what we do. We sincerely want to do that with no strings attached...meaning that it is our desire to not require user IDs, passwords, or subscription fees. Even though several site vistors have suggested that we could charge for this service, we have so far been able to resist that impulse.</B>
<P>
<B>Unfortunately, as with most good things, the costs of providing this site and its information to you are high. Suffice it to say that the purchase of a separate server, software, network equipment and installation of a dedicated Internet line were an expensive undertaking. Hundreds of man-hours were spent assembling original reference information and posting it here for you to read and download. Dozens more are spent every week by our world-wide staff, covering and analyzing the most up-to-the-minute emergency news and issues that we believe are important to you.</B>
<P>
<B>We are attempting, as best we can, to off-set these costs by offering advertising and other revenue-generating sources here on the site.  We would ask that you seriously consider patronizing our advertisers, recommend them to others, and maybe even drop them a e-mail note and tell them how much you appreciate their support for your interests.  It would be our greatest hope that their continuing support would help to provide for our expenses, in lieu of any actual charge for your personal use of the news and information here.</B>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="/pilecash.gif">
<B>Our hope and faith is also in you.  We believe that you will recognize the value and utility of this site and help us to continue this effort.  Although some will think us naive and even scoff and laugh at this request; they will also continue to visit the site, and take what we have to offer. Many will never pay "a nickle", assuming that we can afford to provide this service for them...for FREE...forever.  Of course, they are wrong.
<P>
 Hopefully, others will feel differently, appreciate our hard work, and voluntarily send in a few bucks to assist us in the maintenance and improvement of this unique asset. They might buy a book or computer program from us to help offset the cost of this site. Or, they might subscribe to our on-line bulletin board or daily ENNFAX emergency news service. Or, they will send in a news tip, article, or graphic for inclusion here. If every one of our current website users sends in only what <I>they think</I> our news and information are worth, we would more than be able to meet our annual budget.
<P>
The alternative, if no one choses to contribute in any way, is that this site may (at some point) have to become a totally commercial venture with all of the inherent costs and restrictions. We sincerely hope that doesn't become a necessity.
<P>
It is<I> ONLY</I> with <I>YOUR </I>assistance that this site can continue, improve, grow, and prosper.</B>
<P>
<HR>
<B>Most of all we want to meet your NEEDS!  Tell us what you want to see here! Please send comments, questions, or suggestions about this site to the Webmaster at: </B><A HREF="mailto:webmaster@emergency.com"><B>ERRI Webmaster</B><IMG SRC="/mailbox.gif" align="middle"></A>

<H3>THE CHICAGO FIRE DEPARTMENT</H3>
<BR>

The Chicago Fire Department is the largest fire department in the
Midwest region of the United States.  The City of Chicago covers
228 square miles and has a population of just under 3 million.
<P>

The primary responsibility of the CFD includes the obvious
responsibilities of preservation of life and property from
fire, but it is also responsible for the response and mitigation
of hazardous materials and the delivery of Emergency Medical Service.
The Chicago Fire Department operates the largest totally Advanced
Life Support ambulance system in the world.  The fire department
also responds to many other non-fire emergency responses.
<P>

The Chicago Fire Department has the following resources available:
98 Engine Companies, 59 Truck Companies, 4 Squad companies,
24 Battalion Chiefs, 6 Deputy District Chiefs, 59 Ambulance Companies,
1 Fireboat, 5 Command Vans, and a number of other specialized pieces
of Equipment.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

<H5>
Bureau of Fire Suppression and Rescue</H5>
<BR>
Generally referred to as just, "Suppression," this is the firefighting
force of the department.  Suppression is broken down into six districts
that are each commanded by a District Chief and a Deputy District Chief.
District Chiefs work normal business hours, except when one is assigned
to the "Duty."  When a District Chief is assigned the "Duty" he is on
24-hour call for citywide extra alarm fires and other emergencies.
Deputy District Chiefs work the same type of shift as other members of
subordinate rank in the department.  They work a 24-hour shift and then
are off for 48 hours.
<P>
Districts
<BR>
Each District in the Chicago Fire Department is comprised of four
Battalions.  Each Battalion is commanded by a Battalion Chief.  Each
Battalion is made up of a number of Engine companies and Truck Companies.
Some Battalions have Squad Companies and other miscellaneous units,
such as: chemical units, smoke ejectors, command vans, etc...

<H5>Chicago O'Hare International Airport</H5>
<BR>
Chicago is the home of the "World's Busiest Airport."  O'Hare is located
in the far Northwest portion of the city.  Since many people reading
this on the World Wide Web may, in fact, come through Chicago in their
travels we thought that we would include some information on the
extraordinary and interesting array of specialized fire equipment that
resides at the three Crash stations at the airport.  Presently, the
CFD is not the only fire department at O'Hare.  The United States
Air Force also maintains a large contingent of fire equipment there.
These well trained Air Force Crash teams work very closely with the
units of the 12th Battalion at O'Hare.
<P>

The fire equipment at O'Hare is top-of-the-line and state-of-the-art.
This airport is one of the few airports where commercial pilots feel
very confident about coming to when they have an on-board emergency.
<P>

The following is a list of fire equipment that is stationed at O'Hare:

Battalion Chief 12
<BR>
Engine 9 - 1992 Federal/Emergency One  2000/750/300 with a 50-foot Squrt
<BR>
Engine 10 - identical to Engine 9
<BR>
Tower Ladder 63 - 1988 Federal/Emergency One 95-foot ladder
<BR>
Squad 7 - 1988 Spartan/Super Vac
<BR>
Command Van 2-7-8
<BR>
Ambulance 16
<BR>
Ambulance 26
<BR>
Ambulance 59
<BR>
Aircraft Stairway 6-3-5
<BR>
Crash units: 6-5-1, 6-5-3, 6-5-4, 6-5-5, 6-5-6, 6-5-7, 6-5-8, 6-5-10, 6-5-11
<BR>
<P>
Most of the Crash rigs are Oshkosh T-3000's with 3185 gallons of water
and 420 gallons of foam.  It would take 9555 gallons of water or three
full tanks of water to "eat up" or use up the 420 gallons of foam that is 
carried on-board these rigs.  Units 6-5-1, 6-5-10 and 6-5-11 are reserve
rigs.
<P>
The newest Crash Rig is 6-5-3, which is an Oshkosh T-3000 and is equipped
with a "Snozzle."  A Snozzle is a device that looks like an arm and has
the ability to puncture the thin aluminum skin of an aircraft and inject
foam or water to the inside of the plane.  This Snozzle is also supposed
to be able to be equipped with a television camera that is capable of
seeing inside of the aircraft.
<P>
The United States Air Force has the following equipment assigned to the airport:
<BR>
Chief 2
<BR>
Red 3 - Quality P-2 Crash Rig w/ 2000 gal of water and 205 gal of foam
<BR>
Red 4 - identical to Red 3
<BR>
Red 5 - Ford F350 Rapid Intervention Vehicle. Carries foam products.
<BR>
Red 6 - Chevy C30 Rescue Vehicle
<BR>
Red 8 - Oshkosh P-4 Crash Rig w/ 1500 gal of water and 105 gal of foam
<BR>
Red 9 - Oshkosh P-19 Crash Rig w/ 1000 gal of water and 130 gal of foam
<BR>
Red 11 - Engine company
<BR>

Take all of the firefighting equipment at O'Hare and you have an
impressive armada.
<BR>

Emergency communications at O'Hare is handled by the multi-million
dollar "Command Center" which is a new state-of-the-art communications
and crisis management center that has set a standard for all other
airports, which now model their communications centers after O'Hare.
<P>

Chicago's O'Hare International Airport serves 66 million passengers
every year and has a total of six runways that sit on 7,800 acres --
the acreage is less than half the size of Dallas/Ft. Worth Airport
at 17,520 acres and only one quarter the size of Denver International
Airport at 34,000 acres.

<H5>Chicago Fire Department Response Procedures</H5>
<BR>

The following is the description of alarms and primary equipment dispatched:
<BR>

Still Alarm = 2 engines, 2 trucks, one battlion chief
<P>

Working Still Alarm (A confirmed working structure fire) = add one squad
company (If in district.) and one command van
<P>

Still and Box Alarm (Total Response) = 4 engines, 2 trucks, 
one tower ladder, three battalion chiefs, one Deputy District Chief,
one squad company, one command van and one ambulance
<P>

2-11 Alarm (additional response) = 4 engines, 2 trucks, one tower ladder,
two battalion chiefs, one District Chief
<P>

3-11 Alarm (additional response) = 4 engines and Deputy Fire Commissioners
<P>

4-11 Alarm (additional response) = 4 engines
<P>

5-11 Alarm (additional response) = 4 engines
<P>

Special Alarm = any additional equipment that is requested for by the
Incident Commander.  Usually five engine companies.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>Hazardous Materials Response Procedures</H5>
<BR>

The mission of the CFD, in a Hazardous Materials incident, is to
isolate, contain and stabalize hazardous materials until such time
as the proper officials require the owner of the product to properly
dispose of the material.
<P>

Hazardous materials are defined as: any explosive, flammable, oxidizer,
poison, etiologic agent, radioactive, corrosive or other substance or
material, in a quantity or form that may pose an unreasonable risk to
health, safety and the environment.
<P>

Response
<BR>

Level 1 = Is the minimum initial response to any suspected or potential
Hazardous Materials incident.  This level is primarily for investigative
activities and/or to mitigate incidents involving small quantities or
low potential materials.  A Level 1 HazMat response consists of:
one battalion chief, one engine, one truck, one ambulance and a HIT
task force of: one squad and the Hazardous Materials Squad 5-1-1.
<P>

Level 2 = Is a confirmed incident involving a moderate or high potential
and/or a large quantity of material; or an incident requiring protective
clothing above Level D (Structural firefighting clothes); or an incident
requiring the need to initiate an evacuation.  A Level 2 HazMat response
consists of the following units: one Deputy District Chief, one HIT
Task Force Team engine, one HIT Task Force Team truck, one Safety Officer,
one EMS Field Officer, one Air Mask Support Vehicle and one command van.
<P>

Level 3 = Level 3 HazMat incidents are rarely called.  This would be
an extensive incident which may require additional manpower, more
supplies than are normally carried by the HIT Task Force, and an
expanded evacuation area.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

<H5>
Emergency Medical Service Response Procedures</H5>
<BR>

Pin-In Response = one engine, one truck, one battalion chief, one squad
and one ambulance
<P>

EMS Plan I = 5 ambulances, one EMS Field Officer, one EMS Dpty. Asst. Paramedic, one engine, one truck, one battalion chief
<P>

EMS Plan II (additional response) = 5 ambulances, one EMS Field Officer,
one EMS Triage van, one Deputy District Chief, one command van
<P>

EMS Plan III (additional response) = 5 ambulances, one District Chief,
and the Deputy Fire Commissioner of EMS.

<font size=5><strong>&quot;ECSTASY&quot; IS BEING IMPORTED FROM EUROPE</strong></font><br>
By Clark Staten, EMT-P, I/C<br>
<br>
Chicago,IL - Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS )intelligence sources here indicate that a little known drug,<br>
that is being mass produced in the Netherlands and Germany, is starting to show up on the streets of America. The<br>
designer drug, called &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, had a brief period of popularity during the late 1970's and early 1980's is again<br>
being taken by young people in the United States.<br>
<br>
Recent reports of mass seizures of the drug have taken place in London, England. Police there report a tremendous<br>
resurgence of a drug first developed by German chemists almost one-hundred years ago. The drug was originally<br>
designed to be used as an appetite suppressant. The technical name of the drug is Methylene-dioxymethamphetamine<br>
or &quot;MDMA&quot; for short. When first introduced into the United States, it was commonly called &quot;MDA&quot; or the &quot;Love Drug&quot;.<br>
<br>
Like many drugs in the amphetamine family, it produces a feeling of euphoria, well being, and awareness in low doses.<br>
It also reduces hunger and increases wakefulness. It has even been used by some psychiatrists to lessen inhibitions and<br>
promote interaction between people. In higher doses, however, it can produce rapid heartbeats, cardiac arrthymias 
(disturbances), dehydration, fever, exhaustion, decreased clotting factors, and even a state of &quot;paranoid psychosis&quot;.<br>
<br>
According to anti-drug experts, this change in drug preferences is similar to another that has been recently detected in 
Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and elsewhere. It involves a shift, particularly by younger abusers, away from<br>
recently popular and expensive drugs like Heroin and Cocaine. Numerous reports are being received that indicate that<br>
today's 15-20 year olds have again begun the use of Hallucinogenic drugs like LSD, Peyote, Psilocybin, Mescaline,<br>
and MDMA.<br>
<br>
Inside intelligence sources that the one of the popular forms of these drugs is referred to as &quot;blotter acid&quot;, because it<br>
is produced and then put on sheets of absorbent paper. The paper can then be cut or torn into single dose sizes as the<br>
desire for sale or ingestion arises. All of the aforementioned drugs are also available in tablet form, in various colors and 
sizes. Both city and suburban police have reported several recent overdoses and the seizures of both pills and paper 
containing multiple doses of the mind-altering drugs.<br>
<br>
Interviews with local paramedics, and those from California, indicate that they are seeing an increase in the number of<br>
overdoses involving &quot;bad trips&quot; or patients exhibiting particularly bizarre behaviors after the ingestion of &quot;unknown oral 
drugs&quot;. Many of the signs and symptoms that are being seen would seem related to the use of hallucinogenic type drugs. 
Preliminary anecdotal evidence suggests that the youngsters had ingested &quot;Love Drugs&quot; or &quot;Acid&quot;.<br>
<br>
At least one very veteran paramedic indicated that he has recently seen several younger patients ( Ages 14, 16, and<br>
18), who are reminiscent of patients that he treated during the late 1960's and early 1970's, when LSD and other<br>
hallucinogenic drugs were very popular. He also says that witnesses have admitted that some of the victims are &quot;vegged<br>
out&quot; on &quot;MDA&quot; or other hallucinogenic drugs.<br>
<br>
According to some authors and pop culture authorities, this shift to &quot;new and better&quot; designer drugs is an attempted return <br>
to the simpler and happier times of the 60's. According to police and medical authorities, however, it signals a proliferation<br>
of a new and more insidious kind of &quot;poison&quot;, that is being marketed to our children.<br>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 11/11/96 - 20:00CST<br>
<br>
<font size=5><strong>Nance's &quot;Pandora's Clock&quot; All Too Real?</strong></font><br>
By Paul Anderson, ENN Associate Editor <br>
<br>
Chicago, IL, November 11, 1996 (ENN) -- A television mini-series, based on John Nance's best-selling novel,<br>
&quot;Pandora's Clock&quot;, and airing on the NBC network tonight, has created quite a stir in both the scientific community and 
the<br>
general public. Regular airline passengers have begun to ask questions about the reality of Nance's fictional account of a<br>
potential infectious disease epidemic on a plane in flight. <br>
<br>
Scientists, researchers, military planners, and counter-terrorist analysts say that the proliferation of chemical and biological 
weapons in the world is a matter of utmost concern to them and that they fear it is only a matter of time before these 
fearsome and insidious weapons are (again) used against civilian populations. The experts point to a March 19th, 1995 
release of poison gas in the Tokyo, Japan subway system as an example of what could happen tomorrow in any city<br>
in the United States. <br>
<br>
In fact, the threat of the intentional use or accidental release of a airborne &quot;class-4&quot; biological weapon (BW) is, in some 
ways, far more frightening to researchers than that of a chemical release, for which there may be known specific antidotes 
and counter-measures. In the case, for instance, of a mutated or genetically engineered strain of ebola or some 
hemorrhagic fever, there may be no known effective treatment. Additionally, infectious disease scientists point out that a 
spread of deadly pathogens could take place without any immediate recognition on the part of the medical community, 
until after hundreds or even thousands of people had been infected. <br>
<br>
An examination of current preparedness levels of emergency service agencies, to deal with a potentially deadly release of a<br>
biological agent, in the United States, might also be pause for concern. Georgia Senator Sam Nunn said, in March of this 
year, that the United States had a &quot;remarkable lack of domestic preparedness&quot; to deal with such situations. <br>
<br>
Oakland, CA Fire Chief Lamont Ewell, who is also the president of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, on March 
29, 1996, told the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, that it would be the responsibility of local<br>
firefighting, police and emergency medical units to cope with a terrorist attack that used nuclear, chemical or biological<br>
weapons. He also said that they were not prepared for the challenge. Ewell affirmed something that the Emergency 
Response and Research Institute (ERRI), in Chicago, has been saying for a number of years. The chief told the packed 
Senate hearing room, &quot;It will be local fire and emergency service organizations ...who have to pick up the pieces. Of the 
overall government efforts to prevent and respond to terrorist incidents, these local fire, law enforcement and emergency 
medical services agencies are the least prepared to respond to a chemical or biological terrorist incident.&quot; <br>
<br>
While some efforts have been begun to develop training programs for emergency response personnel and to develop 
military and civilian special teams to deal with the threat of a chemical or biological attack on the United States, experts tell 
ENN that, overall, our country is woefully unprepared for such an eventuality. <br>
<br>
&quot;If a plane were to land at any number of other airports within this country, with a plane load of dangerously infected<br>
passengers, it is our belief that the local firefighters, police officers, and EMTs would be hard pressed to effectively 
manage<br>
the incident or treat the patients...they currently lack the knowledge and equipment to do so,&quot; according to Clark Staten,<br>
retired paramedic chief and Executive Director of the Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute (ERRI).<br>
<br>
During the first few vital hours of any such an operation, analysts say that many emergency agencies would be suffering<br>
from an &quot;information vacuum.&quot; With few exceptions, they would not have immediate access to the needed medicines or 
supplies, nor contact with the necessary experts to successfully resolve the situation. It is also probable that they also 
would not have the appropriate protective clothing, equipment, nor isolation procedures to protect the rescuers and the 
public. <br>
<br>
The expert help that local agencies would need must come from the Center For Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, the 
U.S Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Ft. Derick, Maryland, or a new specially 
trained team of U.S. Marines called the Chemical/Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF). Unfortunately, it might be 
several hours before these highly trained specialists could arrive on the scene of the incident. In the mean time, local fire, 
EMS, and police agencies would be responsible for the management of the emergency.<br>
<br>
&quot;All of this points out the need for immediate funding of new and different kind training and equipment for local 
Police/Fire/EMS personnel,&quot; Staten continued. &quot;They are the front-line of defense if the unthinkable happens...and some 
fanatic were to attack our country with these weapons of mass destruction(WMD),&quot; he added. &quot;Bottom-line...we need to 
develop an totally integrated response against terrorists and terrorism...this must include local emergency agencies, the<br>
military, and the medical research community... if we are to be truly prepared for the threat of a chemical or biological<br>
attack,&quot; Staten concluded.<br>

<H2>'Roofies', The New "Date Rape" Drug of Choice</H2>
By Clark Staten, ERRI Executive Director
<P>

Chicago, IL., January 6, 1995 (ENN) --Like the Quaaludes of the
60's and 70's, there is a new "love drug" being abused in
several parts of the country.  The drug is Rohypnol, or
"Roofies" as it being is called on the street. It is also called
"ruffies", "roche", "R-2", "rib" and "rope" and reportedly is
quickly becoming the "date rape drug of choice."
<P>

Rohypnol is a brand name for flunitrazepam (a benzodiazepine), a
very potent tranquilizer similar in nature to valium (diazepam),
but many times stronger. The drug produces a sedative effect,
amnesia, muscle relaxation, and a slowing of psychomotor
responses. Sedation occurs 20-30 minutes after administration
and lasts for several hours. The drug is often distributed on the street in
it's original "bubble packaging" which adds an air of legitimacy
and makes it appear to be legal. The drug is not commonly used
by physicians in the United States and is not even listed in the
commonly used Physician's Desk Reference.
<P>

Illicit use of Rohypnol was originally reported in Europe in the
late 1970's and world-wide use of it has continually increased
since then. According to police sources in both Florida and
Texas, "roofies" were first seen in the United States in the
early 1990's; they quickly gained acceptance and use by both
high school and college students. According to the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) more than 1,000 cases of
illegal Rohypnol possession have been reported recently, in
thirteen states. Reports have also been received of it being
popular in "gay bars" in selected locations on both the East and
West coasts.  In fact, Rohypnol is now being reported as being
one of the "in" drugs on high school and college campuses and
particularly in college fraternities. And to make matters worse,
"Roofies" are inexpensive and reportedly being sold for as
little as $2.00-$4.00 per tablet in several locations.
<P>

According to a University of Florida drug hotline, "Roofies" are
often combined with alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine to produce a
rapid and very dramatic "high".  Even when used by itself, users
can appear extremely intoxicated, with slurred speech, no
coordination, swaying, and blood-shot eyes...with no odor of
alcohol. The drug has been added to punch and other drinks at
fraternity parties and college social gatherings, where it is
reportedly given to female party participants in hopes of
lowered inhibitions and facilitating potential sexual conquest. Police
departments in several parts of the country say that after
ingestion of "Roofies" that several young women have reported
waking up in frat houses with no clothes on, finding themselves
in unfamiliar surroundings with unfamiliar people, or having
actually been sexually assaulted while under the influence of
the drug. 
<P>

As insidious, disgusting and perilous as this may sound, the
dangers don't stop there. Besides the worries of unprotected
sex, Rohypnol, particularly when mixed with alcohol or other
drugs may lead to respiratory depression, aspiration, and even
death. When taken repeatedly, it can lead to physical and
psychic dependence, which is thought to increase with both dose
and duration of use. An amnesia producing effect of "Roofies"
may prevent users from remembering how or why they took the drug
or even that they were given it by others. This makes
investigation of sexually related or other offenses very
difficult and may account for repeated reports of "date rapes"
involving the use of the drug.
<P>

Both law enforcement and drug counseling services caution that
the use of Rohypnol is increasing and that additional quantities
of it are being imported across the Mexican border, where it can
be obtained by prescription. ERRI drug abuse analysts warn that
"Roofies" are  just another in a long list of dangerous drugs
that are being imported and "pushed" to the impressionable youth
of this country.

<H2>RISING GANG VIOLENCE RESULT OF "TURF WARS"</H2>
By Amy Grant, Medical Correspondent
<P>
Chicago, IL. - The recent shootings of two Chicago Police
officers, and the wounding and killing of hundreds of other
Chicago citizens are the direct or indirect result of an
ongoing attempt by "streetgangs" from out of state to gain
control of given neighborhoods here, according to Clark
Staten, Executive Director of the Chicago-based Emergency
Response & Research Institute.  Staten, who studies all types
of emergency response issues, says that there are at least
four major "gang and drug" pipelines operating into and out
of the Chicago area.
<P>

According to the veteran paramedic, former police officer,
and intelligence analyst, one of the major "pipelines" leads
to New York.  This can be evidenced, he says, by the recently
announced fugitive status of three reported Jamaican gang
members who are suspected in the recent Chicago Police
shootings. In New York City, the "Jamaicans" are known as
some of the most violent and ruthless of gang members. The
Jamaicans are also known to be extremely "closeknit", and are
said to have a very closely held network of drug couriers to
and from the Caribbean.
<P>

New York City Police and Paramedics report a recent, violent,
expansion of their activities in the New York and New Jersey
area.  Distribution of drugs, particularly cocaine, is now
reportedly being carried out throughout other parts of the
country. Intelligence sources indicate that the "Jamaicans"
are now currently operating in the Kenmore/Winthrop corridor
on Chicago's Northeast side.  Further, they have reportedly
been attempting to gain control of drug traffic in several
Uptown and Roger's Park neighborhoods.  This has led to
several recent shootings and attempts at intimidation.
Reports have also been recieved of an ongoing conflict
between the Jamaicans and members of a Chicago gang called
the "Black Gangster Disciples" over the control of areas in
which to sell drugs.
<P>

A second and burgeoning "pipeline" leads to Los Angeles and
the "Crips" streetgang. Evidence of involvement by Los-
Angeles based gangs on Chicago's Westside is continually
being gathered by Chicago police and paramedics. On at least
two occasions weapons and explosives have been confiscated,
that supposedly belong to members of the now infamous
California gang.
<P>

For example, a November 4th, 1991 "raid" on a garage in the
1400 block of So. Ridgeway Ave. resulted the in the
confiscation of Seven (7) military fragmentation hand
grenades, three (3) Soviet "AK-47" Assault rifles, one (1)
Soviet "SKS" Assault rifle, one (1) British "Sten"
Machinegun, one (1) Ruger Semi-auto carbine, several 9mm and
.45 caliber pistols, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. A
burglary suspect that voluntarily helped to locate the
weapons is quoted as saying that the weapons belonged to a
member of the L.A. "Crips" street gang.
<P>

Reports have also been recieved that members of the "Crips"
are said have formed an temporary alliance with members of at
least two factions of the Westside Chicago "Vice Lords"
street gang.  The alliance is said to have involved the
outright distribution of large quantities of drugs and the
trading of guns for drugs.  The "Vice Lords" are said to
control much of the drug traffic on the Westside and are
thought to expanding into other areas of the country.
Reportedly there are Chicago connected "chapters" of the Vice
Lords in such unlikely places as Green Bay, Wisconsin and Des
Moines, Iowa.
<P>

Due to a desire for expansion by both the Chicago and L.A.
gangs into untapped drug markets, a reputable crime analyst
who has requested anonymity, says that in some ways the
linking of the "Crips" and "Vice-Lords" is "an evil natural".
He said, "They both are in it for the money... and in
Chicago, the Vice Lords already control much of the traffic
on the Westside".  "They either have to form some sort of
strategic alliance or fight each other for each block and
street corner", he continued.
<P>

"If they combine forces, the `Vice Lords' obtain vast
quantities of drugs and exotic weaponry, and the "Crips' are
afforded the protection that they need to operate in a
`hostile' environment", he continued.  "In the case of any
out-of-state expansion their combining resources makes good
business sense because, together, there is often no one with
the power to fight the two of them... in the smaller towns
that they are now invading", he told EmergencyNet NEWS.
<P>

"Presently, the violent struggles are about determining who
gets what share of what territory and how the `spoils' will
be distributed", the veteran reviewer said. "There are also
several groups that do not want to form any sort of alliance
and are protecting their `turf' with automatic weapons and
explosives... the large numbers of dead and wounded in recent
months are the results of this resistance", the analyst
concluded.
<P>

An informed drug enforcement agent say that there is also
evidence of the "Crips" attempting to also gain a foothold on
parts of Chicago's Southside. Recent reports have been
received that suggest that members of the "Crips" have been
linked with selling drugs and guns in the vicinity of the
Chicago Housing Authority's Robert Taylor Homes.
<P>

Another report indicates that members of the "Crips" are
thought to be fighting with members of both the "Black
Disciples" and the "Gangster Disciples" in order to further
drug distribution networks in the Chicago Housing Authority
projects. There is a definite difference between the two
Chicago groups, and they also frequently shoot at each other
for control of the "valuable" drug territories in the South
State Street corridor.
<P>

The third drug "pipeline", leads to Mexico and several points
South of there.  It involves the "Hispanic connection". The
largest hispanic gang in the city is the "Latin Kings".  They
have various chapters throughout the city and are known for
their participation in and control of narcotics sales, in the
neighborhoods that they frequent. The "Latin Kings" are also
known as one of the most violent street gangs in the City of
Chicago.
<P>

Involvement has been reported between the notorious "Herrera
Drug Family" and the "Latin Kings".  Although several family
members are in jail, the Herrera's were previously known to
be the distributors of high potency Mexican "Brown Heroin"
that has been popular at various times with Chicago's
"Junkie" population.  The "Latin Kings" also deal in large
amounts of cocaine.  It is believed that it is smuggled from
Peru and Columbia, through Mexico, by gang "mules" of Mexican
descent.  Reportedly, more than one "Latin King" has returned
to Mexico or Central America "for a short vacation" and soon
turned up "back in the hood" with a new car and lots of
spending money.
<P>

At least one Chicago analyst says that there are hints of a
direct connection between a faction of the "Latin Kings" and
couriers of the Columbia-based Mendallin drug cartel.  A
continued proliferation of regular and "crack" cocaine would
seem to signify significant supplies are constantly being
made available to members of the "Latin Kings".  Police
sources confirm that the "Kings" are frequently arrested for
possession of varying amounts of the high-quality and illicit
substance.  Police also say that the "Latin Kings" run
several "drive-up" drug delivery operations in the Humboldt
Park area of Chicago.
<P>

The fourth connection "pipeline" involves Asian-Americans,
particularly those of Chinese extraction. The links to the
old "Burma Triangle" drug production area, that were shown to
have been exploited throughout the Viet Nam War, are still
thought to be active in a small segment of the Chinese
community.  Although extremely difficult to infiltrate, some
drug intelligence information has still been obtained that
indicates that there is an "Asian Connection".
<P>

The primary drugs provided by the Asian drug couriers are
"Poppy-based" and generally involve the addicting opiates.
"China White" Heroin is a particular example of the type of
drugs that are sold, often in bulk, by Asian wholesale
dealers.  Many, if not most, of the transactions involve
sales by Chinese "merchants" to black or hispanic middle-men,
who then sell them to street level dealers.  There are also
Asian "street gangs" who are used as enforcement tools by the
drug dealers.  Although small in number, the members of the
"Asian Connection" are thought to control a substantial part
of the heroin Traffic in the Chicago area.
<P>

Staten points out that not all drug transactions are
exclusively tied to "streetgangs", and that there are
numerous unorganized sources of purchase.  Traditional
organized crime is also responsible for a sizable percentage
of the drug traffic in the Chicago area, according to Police
crime statistics.  Although commonly involved in
prostitution, gambling, extortion, and protection rackets,
the "mafioso" is reportedly now heavily involved in drug
distribution in the Midwest and elsewhere.  This is unlike
several years ago, when the "Wiseguys" were prohibited by
strict internal rules from trafficking in drugs.  Recent
years, however, have seen much "Mob" involvement in this most
profitable business.
<P>

In conclusion, Staten indicated that the ties between the
various groups mentioned are transient and often disjointed.
Further, he indicated that the dynamics of drug buying and
selling are based on a fairly traditional supply and demand
scheme that causes alliances and enemies to "change as
frequently as the weather". But, he noted, the violence
perpetrated by the combination of these groups is certainly
reason for everyone's concern. According to Staten, "The
continued proliferation of these gangs and drugs does
nothing...but, breed death and destruction for the rest of
us".  He strongly recommends that additional resources be
made available to Police to combat this growing menace.

<TITLE>"Good Times" is a Hoax</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
For Immediate Release: 03/01/96
<P>
<U><H2>The AOL 'Good Times' Virus is a Hoax</H2></U>
Reports continue to surface from a variety of normally reputable sources in regard to a so-called "Good-Times" virus that is contained within e-mail sent through or originating from the America On-Line(tm)
computer service. The latest report (02/27/96) came from a Sheriff's Office in California and was distributed through a number of "police" channels on the Internet.  Besides police and military channels, the hoax has also reportedly proliferated among U.S. Dept. of Agriculture employees, and other reputable government offices. It appeared to be totally legitimate...<B>.it was not</B>.
<P>
Sadly, any number of reliable news sources and individuals have fallen for this rumor in the past, including the EmergencyNet News Service. Late in January, we received a copy of a message from an authentic "military souce" which explained the "virus" that was reportedly being spread by e-mail.   Stupidly, believing this previously reliable reporter, we "bit" and passed along the warning...creating quite a furor among several of our readers, who study such issues on an on-going and professional basis. They immediately, and thankfully, notified us of our error.
<P>
Even though we retracted the alert the next day and in one other subsequent story, the "cat was out of the bag".  Although our intent was honest, and our timeliness exemplary, our facts apparently left something to be desired.  We apologize for our error, stand chastised,  and vow to obtain "several" expert opinions before releasing further information about other potentially destructive viruses. If you read a "virus alert" here in the future, it will be based on at least three reliable sources.
<P>
It should be noted that Microsoft(tm) does acknowledge that there currently is a Word for Windows(tm) virus that can be spread by e-mail and that it runs a "macro" that can allow it to be become destructive. The release of that story admittedly contributed to our belief that the problem could have been transfered to other e-mail providers and systems. Experts have advised us that this method of infection of normal e-mail is not technically feasible at this time. It is confirmed that the "Good-Times" virus either doesn't exist, nor spread an infection . 
<P>
<B>REPEAT...the "Good Times" virus is a hoax, designed to waste your bandwidth and increase your insecurity!  PLEASE DO NOT spend any more time or effort spreading this rumor.... </B>

<H2>"KIDS WITH NO HOPE, NO FEAR, NO RULES, AND NO LIFE EXPECTANCY"...
</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>
<B>The Statistics</B>
<P>
There is a bitter battle over how to combat the nation's fastest-growing crime problem -- juvenile offenders.  While overall crime statistics in America's largest cities has dropped, there is one category where it has skyrocketed. That category is homicides committed by youths under the age of 17.  Between 1984 and 1994, murders committed by youths under 17 tripled.  Demographic studies show that there will be a surge in the teen population in the coming years and experts believe that 25 percent of all murders committed by the year 2005 will be committed by juveniles.
<P>

Violence (i.e. Aggravated assaults) committed with guns by youths has also increased at roughly the same pace as homicides.  After years of statistical decline, drug use by teens is also on the rise.  None of these statistics would appear to bode well for future.
<P>

It now seems that everyday we are hearing about horrendous violent crimes being committed by juveniles.  The most famous of late was the 6-year-old in northern California who almost beat to death a small baby.  The baby was just released from the hospital on Thursday and has suffered brain damage from the attack by the 6-year-old.
<P>

There is also the case of the 15-year-old pregnant girl who was shot to death by another student in St. Louis.  In Miami, two 16-year-old males have been charged with the murder of a Dutch woman tourist who just happened to end up in the wrong neighborhood. A 15-year-old New York boy tried to steal a pair of earrings from a woman.  During the attack, the young woman fell to her death under a New York subway train.
<P>

In Fort Meyers, Florida, a group of teenagers shot and killed a high school band teacher.  This case will be the subject of an upcoming ENN report, but a police investigation into this group of teens turned up "would-be junior terrorists" that could of rivaled some of the worst terrorist organizations in the world.
<P>

On Friday, in St. Louis, one 9-year-old and two 11-year-old males were charged with the rape of an 8-year-old female in an overgrown field.  Where are they learning this stuff?  This has to be learned behavior.
<P>

There seems to be growing awareness now of this juvenile crime problem in the United States.  Several experts, as well as this publication, have been trying very hard to get the word out. People who have become victims of these young felons are angry and are calling for changes to be made in the juvenile justice system.
<P>

It has been a long-standing belief in the United States that juveniles who kill, rape and rob, be treated differently than adult offenders.  But this may soon change. In 1899, juvenile courts were established to help protect "juvenile delinquents."  But it seems that today, the reasoning for the protection of the youths in the criminal justice system may be outdated and changes need to be made to accomodate these "14-year-old harden felons."  Many critics, today, say that in reality too many hard-core juvenile offenders are arrested, held, and released time-after-time-after-time in a process that is called a revolving door.  It seems to only come to an end when a truly heinous crime is committed.
<P>
<B>Worse than Better in the Future</B>
<P>

Because of the rise in juvenile crime and the experts predictions that the problem is going to get worse before it gets better, many cities, states and even congress are trying to wrestle with the problem.  Tallahassee, Florida, has been experimenting with a couple of different programs to deal with troubled youths.  In one case, Tallahassee Police received a report of a teenager breaking into an auto.  Immediately, officers knew their suspect.  The suspect was a 16-year-old, who even held a job at a near-by restaurant. This 16-year-old, who was on parole, had been known to commit 32 similar offenses.  Officers had kept the suspect tracked on a point scale.  He was arrested after he barricaded himself inside an apartment building.  Because of his extensive criminal record, prosecutors immediately sent him to trial in an adult court.  This can be called the "get-tough" approach.
<P>

In another case, in the same city, a softer approach is taken with another known troubled child.  A fifth-grader was repeatedly getting into trouble with the law last summer.  In six weeks, after special classes and counseling that were followed by DAILY after-school sessions, the child went from "class problem to developing leader." The child was named his school's "student of the month" in January.
<P>

So, which is the best approach to take?  Because of the grim statistics and depressing stories about problem youths, cities, states and even the federal government are looking at new ways to get a handle on the problem.  On the federal end, Congress is considering rewriting a 22-year-old law that provides anti-delinquency aid to states.
<P>

In one state, Massachusetts, the House of Representatives has voted that that anyone as young as the age of 14 may be tried as an adult in a murder case.  The State of Tennessee has now eliminated any minimum age for trying juveniles as adults.  In 1995, Oregon lowered its minimum age for someone to be able to be tried as an adult from 14 down to 12-years.  Wisconsin went even lower.  A child of 10-years-of-age can now be tried as an adult.
<P>
<B>Causative Factors</B>
<P>
What's the cause of all of this?  Statistics show mounting concerns.  In the mid-1980's there was a cocaine epidemic. Drug wars between street gangs and drug dealers led to an arms race on American streets.  The number of black males aged 14 to 17 is due to rise by 26 percent by the year 2005. Unfortunately, statistics prove that such youths are disproportonately affected by social problems linked historically to crime.  These social problems include: the breakdown of the family, poverty and poor education.  It really is not surprising that facing these kinds of social problems, inner-city black youths are disproportionately involved in crime.
<P>

Sixty-one percent of all juveniles arrested for homicide in 1994 were black.  Remember, blacks make up about 12 percent of the overall population in the United States.  52 percent of the murdered victims in 1994 were also black. "Black on Black" crime appears to be a major fact of the statistics.
<P>

Criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern University in Boston said, "Given our wholesale disinvestment in youth, we will likely have more than 5,000 teen killers per year."  The United States averages, currently, about 21,000 homicides per year.  The number of youths aged 14 and younger who have been charged with homicide has jumped by 43 percent in the past twenty years.
<P>

The thing that worries everyone from police officers to criminologists to the general public are the small number of teens who apparently kill or maim with little or no moral compunction.  Cincinnati judge David Grossmann, the president of a national juvenile judges organization, says that he sees a wave of "undisciplined, untutored, unnurtured young people."  The Judge added, "Gangs have become the alternative to a nurturing family."
<P>

Kathleen Heide is a criminologist and a psychotherapist in Florida. She said that many young murderers "are incapable of empathy." Heide related one case where a teen offender shot and paralyzed a jogger who refused to hand over a gold neck chain.  When the teen offender was asked what might had been a preferable alternative outcome other than shooting the victim, the teen said, "He could have given me his rope (chain).  I asked him twice."
<P>

According to John Firman of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, police officers are now encountering more and more <B>"kids with no hope, no fear, no rules and no life expectancy."</B>  Princeton University political scientist  John Dilulio said that inner-city neighborhoods are raising too many "chaotic, dysfunctional, fatherless, Godless and jobless youths where self-respecting young men literally aspire to get away with murder."
<P>
<B>Criminal Justice Response</B>
<P>
Some states are getting tough on juvenile offenders.  In Arizona, the governor of the state, Fife Symington, is working very hard and is leading a petition drive to abolish the state juvenile court system altogether.  The aim is to send the most violent young offenders to adult courts, regardless of age, even if judges, themselves, object.  An aide to Governor Symington said, "The current law making everyone under 18 a juvenile is absurd." The aide, who was a former prosecutor, said, "We've had kids arrested ten or fifteen times ... that has to stop."  It is said that people "are standing in line" to sign the governor's petition.
<P>

In the United States Congress, many conservatives argue that the current federal anti-delinquency statute is out of date.  Many Congressmen only want to send aid to states who try their most violent youths as adults.
<P>

But even if we, as a country, do crackdown and get tough on these young violent offenders ... it's still not an easy solution. As Donna Hamparian, a crime consultant in Columbus, Ohio, pointed out -- even if we do put more youths behind bars, the projected number of juvenile offenders will probably be so high that "we can't build enough prisons to keep all of them locked up." 
<P> 

Analysts at the Emergency Response & Research Institute (ERRI) say that there has to be another solution, and  that ENN will continue to explore the issue and offer alternatives in this continuing series of reports.

<p align=left>Proven to be highly effective in the hands of Muhajadeen Guerrillas, during their insurgency against the Soviets in 
Afghanistan, the Stinger is a man-portable infra-red guided shoulder-launched Surface-To-Air missile (SAM). Its 
maximum effective range is approximately 5,500 meters. Its maximum effective altitude is approx.15,750 ft. It can be<br>
used to target high-speed jets or helicopters.</p>

<p align=left>Sold by the thousands after the fall of the former Soviet Union, the SA-7 &quot;Grail&quot; uses an optical sight and tracking 
device with Infra-Red seeking mechanism to strike flying targets with great force. Its maximum effective range is 
approx. 6,125 meters and maximum effective altitude is approximately 12,900 ft. It is known to be in the stockpiles 
of terrorist and guerrilla groups.</p>
<hr>
<p align=left><font size=5>Nature of the Threat; ERRI Warnings</font></p>
<p align=left>Counter-terrorist analyst and operatives have long feared that military man-portable SAMs could be used to target 
civilian airliners. Concerns have previously been raised about the availability of these weapons on the black market 
and in covert weapons circles. Literally thousands of them may be available for purchase in the Mid-East, Western 
Asia, and Eastern Europe. Some are surplus from Afghanistan and others may be from the disbanded/surplus military 
stock of parts of the former USSR.</p>
<p align=left>The Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute (ERRI) has previously reported (1992) that it could be relatively 
easy for a single terrorist or small group of dedicated terrorists to drive to a secluded area near an airport and 
effectively &quot;shoot-down&quot; an aircraft as it took-off and started to climb out of restricted airspace. Near several 
domestic airports in the United States, there are numerous geographical positions that could place a terrorist within 
the effective range of a Stinger or Grail surface-to-air missile.</p>

<H2>CALI DRUG CARTEL UNDER PRESSURE...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

In 1995 alone, in the New York City borough of Queens, 20 high-level
Colombian drug dealers were found murdered.  In one gruesome
incident in July, the body of one Colombian was found stuffed
inside of a suitcase along the side of a road in Queens.  The
victim had been bound and gagged with duct tape.  A cord had
been wrapped around his neck and a rotting onion was stuffed
inside of his mouth.
<P>

Authorities say that only recently the Cali drug cartel has
been able to overcome some internal stresses on their illegal
operation that was caused by several high-level arrests in 1995.
Only recently has the violence that has been targeted against
drug dealers leveled off.  What that shows is that a power shift
in New York's drug underworld has taken place.
<P>

It is an underworld of bloody turf wars, hitmen who are trigger-
happy, vicious people who won't even think twice about taking
out opposition.  But even though there was a major shakeup in
what is called the world's premier drug cartel -- the cocaine
and the heroin continued to flow into the United States unabated.
But one thing is for certain, the way that the Cali cartel operates
has been transformed.
<P>

The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has increased its
pressure on the drug dealers.  Large drug shipments have been
replaced by smaller ones.  Flashy displays of wealth by drug
dealers has been eliminated.  Stash houses have been moved.
New people have been hired.  Command centers for drug operations
have moved out of the city and into the suburbs of Long Island
and New Jersey.
<P>

The chief of narcotics investigations for the Borough of Queens
District Attorney's Office, Peter Crusco, said, "Paranoia on
their part has gone through the roof."  Crusco said that the
big-time drug dealers are now "working out of suitcases" to
avoid detection from authorities.
<P>

The pressure on the cartel is not only coming from inside of
the United States.  In Colombia, in 1995, six of the highest-
ranking members of the cartel were arrested.  When those arrests
happened, many thought that finally the Cali cartel had been
brought to its knees.
<P>

Last August, after the arrest of one of the key drug-traffickers
in Colombia, Lee Brown, the former director of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, said, "The cartel is crumbling."
But the situation on the streets in New York City told a different
story.
<P>

While many law enforcement officials say that the Cali drug cartel's
operation may have been disrupted for a short period of time -- the
price and supply of drugs has now begun to once again stabilize.
And that's the best indicator of what is happening.
<P>

Late last year, the wholesale price of a kilogram of cocaine in
New York City was $25,000.  It has now dropped to the current
going price of $21,000 a kilo (2.2 pounds).  The United States
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) says that is a sign that
supplies have been stabilized.
<P>

The Agent-In-Charge of the DEA's New York office said that he is
not surprised that the Cali cartel has been able to rebound.  He
said that because of the immense size of the cartel they are able
to "undercut anyone."
<P>

In another illustration of the power of the Colombian cartel, the
Mexicans have been trying to corner the heroin trade in New York
City for decades -- but they've never been able to quite do it.
The Colombians were able to dominate the New York heroin market
almost overnight.  Four years ago, the Colombians only had a 15
percent market share of the New York heroin market.  Today, they
account for 80 percent.
<P>

Carlo Boccia, the head of the New York City DEA office, said this
about the Cali cartel, "There's not an organization anywhere that
can compete with them."  But even though it sounds like things are going well for the
Colombians -- they have been feeling the pressure from law
enforcement.
<P>

Because of increased police action against them in their
traditional strongholds in New York City -- they've had to
move out onto Long Island, the suburbs of New Jersey and
even to the States of Connecticut and Pennsylvania.
It's even more difficult to spot a drug dealer.  Gone are
the flashy, expensive, luxury cars and the gold chains.
Drug dealers are now trying to keep a low profile.
<P>

Another sign that law enforcement is hurting them is the
effort to cut the risk of losing multi-million dollar
losses of drugs seized.  Drug shipments have apparently 
been reduced in size.  What used to be sent in one shipment
is now sent in twenty. Regardless of all of this seemingly good news -- the war on
drugs is still far, far from being won.

<title>Researchers Report E-Coli Detector</title>

<p>Excerpted from the ENN Daily Report - Saturday - 12/14/96 - Vol. 2, No. 349<br>
<br>
<font size=5><strong>Researchers Say They Have Effective E-Coli-157 Detector</strong></font><br>
<br>
(ENN) Berkeley, CA -- Ray Stevens, a chemist at the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, says that 
his team has developed a rapid and reliable test to detect the now familiar 0157:H7 E. Coli bacteria.<br>
<br>
The bug, which has become famous in recent years for causing outbreaks of illness and even deaths in the United States 
and other countries, took the life of one person and sickened fifty others recently in an unpasteurized apple juice incident in 
the Pacific Northwest. Eleven people have died and more that 300 have also been diagnosed with the E. Coli bacteria in 
Scotland within the past two weeks.<br>
<br>
One of the problems in identifying rapidly progressing epidemics is that of identifying the problem virus or bacteria that is 
causing sickness. In the case of sensor developed at the Berkeley labs, they say that it can almost instantenously report 
whether or not E.Coli is present. And, Stevens says that the test is inexpensive and could be widely used by medical and 
prehospital professionals.<br>
<br>
According to Stevens, &quot;We can make an inexpensive sensor that could be placed on a number of different materials such 
as plastic, paper, or glass...the cost is so nominal that could even be part of a bottle cap or container lid.&quot; &quot;If you open the 
lid and the test sensor has changed color, then you would know you have a contaminated food product,&quot; he concluded.<br>
<br>
Until now, no technology existed to provide rapid, on-the-spot tests for the potentially virulent 0157 strain of E. Coli. 
Currently the laboratory test takes at least 24 hours to determine the presence of the bacteria. Analysts who study 
chemical and biological weapons and infectious diseases said that they hope the new sensors prove reliable and that 
production of them can quickly be &quot;up-ramped&quot; to make them widely available to public health personnel.<br>

<TITLE>"Good Times" is a Hoax</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
For Immediate Release: 03/01/96
<P>
<U><H2>The AOL 'Good Times' Virus is a Hoax</H2></U>
Reports continue to surface from a variety of normally reputable sources in regard to a so-called "Good-Times" virus that is contained within e-mail sent through or originating from the America On-Line(tm)
computer service. The latest report (02/27/96) came from a Sheriff's Office in California and was distributed through a number of "police" channels on the Internet.  Besides police and military channels, the hoax has also reportedly proliferated among U.S. Dept. of Agriculture employees, and other reputable government offices. It appeared to be totally legitimate...<B>.it was not</B>.
<P>
Sadly, any number of reliable news sources and individuals have fallen for this rumor in the past, including the EmergencyNet News Service. Late in January, we received a copy of a message from an authentic "military souce" which explained the "virus" that was reportedly being spread by e-mail.   Stupidly, believing this previously reliable reporter, we "bit" and passed along the warning...creating quite a furor among several of our readers, who study such issues on an on-going and professional basis. They immediately, and thankfully, notified us of our error.
<P>
Even though we retracted the alert the next day and in one other subsequent story, the "cat was out of the bag".  Although our intent was honest, and our timeliness exemplary, our facts apparently left something to be desired.  We apologize for our error, stand chastised,  and vow to obtain "several" expert opinions before releasing further information about other potentially destructive viruses. If you read a "virus alert" here in the future, it will be based on at least three reliable sources.
<P>
It should be noted that Microsoft(tm) does acknowledge that there currently is a Word for Windows(tm) virus that can be spread by e-mail and that it runs a "macro" that can allow it to be become destructive. The release of that story admittedly contributed to our belief that the problem could have been transfered to other e-mail providers and systems. Experts have advised us that this method of infection of normal e-mail is not technically feasible at this time. It is confirmed that the "Good-Times" virus either doesn't exist, nor spread an infection . 
<P>
<B>REPEAT...the "Good Times" virus is a hoax, designed to waste your bandwidth and increase your insecurity!  PLEASE DO NOT spend any more time or effort spreading this rumor.... </B>

<H2>SIXTEEN STUDENTS HURT, ONE DEAD, IN HIGH SCHOOL VIOLENCE</H2>
By: Paul Anderson, Metro Correspondent
<P>
Chicago, IL - Four high school students remain hospitalized
in fair to critical condition at area hospitals following two
separate incidents of gang-related violence that occurred
here yesterday.  Delondyn Lawson, age 15, was reportedly
killed by two shots from a .22 caliber semi-automatic
handgun.  Twelve other students were treated and released for
a variety of injuries.
<P>

The first incident involved a morning "pep rally" at Marshall
High School, 3250 W. Adams, on Chicago's West side.
Witnesses say that the troubles began as school security
officials and Chicago Police conducted metal detector
searches of students reporting to school.  According to a
police spokesman, at least eight (8) students were arrested
for weapons violations, disorderly conduct, and other
charges. Shortly there afterward, the students were to attend
a rally for the basketball team in the school gymnasium.
<P>

As the students gathered in the gym, a disturbance broke out
and students began to push and shove each other. During the
commotion, the pushing became violent and a section of the
brick wall surrounding the balcony collapsed.  Several
students fell from the balcony, and other were injured by
falling bricks and debris.  A total of thirteen (13) students
were transported by Chicago Fire Department paramedics to
several area hospitals. A fourteen (14) year old girl and a
seventeen (17) year old girl were admitted to University of
Illinois and Cook County Hospitals, respectively, for their
injuries.
<P>
<HR>
The second incident, involving a dispute over the proceeds of
a "dice game", took place at Tilden High School, 4747 S.
Union, at approximately 10:00 a.m..  The shooting took place
in a hallway during a class break.  According to witnesses
from the school, an argument began as one student asked
another for his share of gambling profits from a game that
had previously occurred. As the argument escalated, one of
the students reportedly punched Joe White, age 15, in the
mouth.  White responded by pulling a .22 caliber handgun and
opening fire. Deceased is Delondyn Lawson, age 15, who was
struck in the back.
<P>

Two other students were also wounded in the gunfire.  Wilson
Ching, age 17, and Barron Hall, age 15, were transported to
Cook County Hospital were they were considered in critical
condition.  A third youth, reportedly an accomplice of the
gunman, was struck by a car while they were attempting to
flee the scene of the shooting, and was taken to St.
Bernard's hospital in good condition. The assailant, Joe
White, was arrested a short time later when found hiding
under the porch of a nearby building.
<P>
<HR>
Friday's incidents follow weeks of violence and mayhem in the
Chicago school system.  On November 13, 1992, thirty (30)
students were arrested as the result of an alleged gang-
fight at Farragut High school on Chicago's near Southwest
side.  Reportedly, as many as fifty (50) Chicago police
officers were called to the school shortly after 10:30 a.m.
in an attempt to quell a "running battle" that began in the
school's lunch room and spread to nearby hallways and onto
the sidewalk.
<P>

According to police records, twenty-nine (29) students were
charged with mob action in this incident and one was charged
with battery to a school security guard. Six (6) students
were injured in the melee and transported to St. Anthony's
Hospital, where they were treated for contusions and minor
lacerations and released. According to Farragut principal
Steve Newton, the major disturbance was the result of an gang
confrontation that had occurred the day before.  Allegedly,
the earlier fight resulted in retaliation and the major
disorder of the 13th.
<P>
<HR>

November 10, 1992 was also a tragic day for the Chicago
public schools.  As classmates watched, 13 year old Willie
Clayborn of the Sherman Elementary School turned a .22 cal.
handgun on himself and pulled the trigger. Willie was
pronounced dead shortly thereafter at an area hospital.
Classmates described Clayborn as "playing with the gun", when
it went off and struck him in the head. 
<P> 

Reportedly, the youth had earlier shown the gun to several other students and
had pointed it at his own stomach without incident, then he
pointed it at his head and it went off. Clayborn's parents
denied any knowledge of his having a gun and his mother even
said that she had prohibited him from having "toy guns".
Nonetheless, he had one on November 10th, and it took his
life.
<P>
<HR>
According to a recent survey by "Who's Who Among American
High School Students", these incidents are not isolated
occurances.  The survey, which interviewed high school aged
youths from all over the country, said that 40% of the
respondants reported that they knew of violent incidents that
had occurred in their schools.  A third of the reported
incidents were believed to be racially or gang motivated.
More surprisingly, over a third of the male students surveyed
said that they personally own or have access to handguns.
Almost half of the male students interviewed said that they
knew of someone who had brought a weapon to school.
<P>

Clark Staten, Executive Director of the Emergency Response &
Research Institute - a Chicago-based emergency services think
tank, said that the problem is far reaching and appears to be
rapidly escalating.  "Reports are being received from urban
areas, suburban, and rural schools", Staten said.  "Most
notable are the numerous incidents in the New York City
Schools, where dozens of children have been killed this
year...and in the Los Angeles County schools, where gang
confrontations seem to occur on almost a daily basis", the
veteran emergency manager added.  "Now, we see this same
wanton violence erupting in the Chicago School system", he
continued.
<P>

Staten, who operates a country-wide computer based
information sharing system for emergency responders and
managers, said that the preliminary statistics for youth
crime seem to be rising at a disproportionate rate to the
overall increase in street crime. "It seems more and younger
people are involved in violent crime, and that they are
engaging in acts that we may have not seen a few years ago",
Staten said. 
<P> 

"Street gang leaders are reportedly using
younger members to carry guns and drugs for them, because
they know that if the juveniles are caught...they will
receive better treatment and more lenient sentences than
older gang members", the experienced emergency analyst added.
"This earlier and more extensive involvement by younger gang
members seems to be leading them to more violent behavior at
an earlier age", Staten concluded.

<br>
A major emergency response has been declared in Atlanta at the Centennial Olympic Park. Police say that an 
&quot;explosion&quot; has occurred near a stage, where a rock band was playing. According to Atlanta police sources, at least 
100 people are reported injured. The cause of the explosion is not know at this time. Multiple ambulances are either

<font color="#FF0000"><font size=5><strong>Athletes Reported Injured</strong></font></font><br>
<br>
Unconfirmed reports have been received by ENN that at least two U.S. Olympic athletes have been injured in this 
evenings explosion at the AT&amp;T Global Village Stage. Another unofficial report has been received from a state law 
enforcement official that there are fatalities. No official statements have been issued as of the time of this report about 
the cause of the explosion.<br>
<br>
According to a NBC news local cameraman, he was asked by security personnel to move away from a tower prior 
to the explosion. He as warned of a &quot;suspicious package&quot; that may have been found. Shortly thereafter a major 
detonation occurred. Local EMS officials say that as many as 150 people may have been injured, several of them 
seriously. Many others are thought to have received minor &quot;shrapnel wounds&quot; and some concusion type injuries.<br>
<br>
As many as 25 ambulances have responded to the incident along with numerous units of the Atlanta fire department. 
No fire ensued after the initial detonation. A triage station has been set-up on a nearby corner and the injured appear 
to be transported in an orderly manner, according to eyewitnesses.<br>

<font color="#FF0000"><font size=5>Additional Devices Reported in Atlanta</font></font><br>
<br>
As yet unconfirmed reports have been recieved that two additional &quot;devices&quot; have been found in the Olympic 
Centennial park area. According to a Fulton County Deputy Sherrif, and now being reported on CNN, additional 
bomb squad technicians are being called to the scene to attempt to check and secure the additional devices. <br>
<br>
Fear are routinely raised of 'secondary devices&quot;, when a blast of undetermined origin has occurred. Additional 
devices are sometimes left to &quot;delay detonate&quot; and injure or kill rescuers. ENN is gathering additional information and 
will provide it as it becomes available...<br></p>

<font color="#FF0000"><font size=5>FBI Officials Verify Explosion is Caused by Bomb</font></font><br>
<br>
According to FBI Special Agent in Charge Woody Johnson, the explosion at Centennial Park in Atlanta was the 
result of &quot;a bomb&quot; and is being considered a &quot;terrorist act&quot; until determined otherwise. This decision will clear the 
way for the FBI Counter-Terrorist task force and other special units to assume command and control of the 
investigation surrounding the bombing. No confirmation was issued in regard to other devices that were found at the 
scene. <br>
<br>Speculation continues that the device that exploded and killed at least two people, and injured another 110, was a 
&quot;pipe bomb&quot;. Eyewitnesses were quoted as saying that they smelled what was described as &quot;gunpowder&quot; shortly 
after the blast; if true, this could be consistent with a improvised pipebomb. Other witnesses said that the police were 
trying to evacuate the area near the eventual blast, just prior to the explosion. Two sources say that they believe that 
police had recieved a 911 call with a &quot;bomb threat&quot; just prior to the detonation and that the call may have been made 
from a pay phone near the Centennial park.<br></p>

<H2>'Roofies', The New "Date Rape" Drug of Choice</H2>
By Clark Staten, ERRI Executive Director
<P>

Chicago, IL., January 6, 1995 (ENN) --Like the Quaaludes of the
60's and 70's, there is a new "love drug" being abused in
several parts of the country.  The drug is Rohypnol, or
"Roofies" as it being is called on the street. It is also called
"ruffies", "roche", "R-2", "rib" and "rope" and reportedly is
quickly becoming the "date rape drug of choice."
<P>

Rohypnol is a brand name for flunitrazepam (a benzodiazepine), a
very potent tranquilizer similar in nature to valium (diazepam),
but many times stronger. The drug produces a sedative effect,
amnesia, muscle relaxation, and a slowing of psychomotor
responses. Sedation occurs 20-30 minutes after administration
and lasts for several hours. The drug is often distributed on the street in
it's original "bubble packaging" which adds an air of legitimacy
and makes it appear to be legal. The drug is not commonly used
by physicians in the United States and is not even listed in the
commonly used Physician's Desk Reference.
<P>

Illicit use of Rohypnol was originally reported in Europe in the
late 1970's and world-wide use of it has continually increased
since then. According to police sources in both Florida and
Texas, "roofies" were first seen in the United States in the
early 1990's; they quickly gained acceptance and use by both
high school and college students. According to the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) more than 1,000 cases of
illegal Rohypnol possession have been reported recently, in
thirteen states. Reports have also been received of it being
popular in "gay bars" in selected locations on both the East and
West coasts.  In fact, Rohypnol is now being reported as being
one of the "in" drugs on high school and college campuses and
particularly in college fraternities. And to make matters worse,
"Roofies" are inexpensive and reportedly being sold for as
little as $2.00-$4.00 per tablet in several locations.
<P>

According to a University of Florida drug hotline, "Roofies" are
often combined with alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine to produce a
rapid and very dramatic "high".  Even when used by itself, users
can appear extremely intoxicated, with slurred speech, no
coordination, swaying, and blood-shot eyes...with no odor of
alcohol. The drug has been added to punch and other drinks at
fraternity parties and college social gatherings, where it is
reportedly given to female party participants in hopes of
lowered inhibitions and facilitating potential sexual conquest. Police
departments in several parts of the country say that after
ingestion of "Roofies" that several young women have reported
waking up in frat houses with no clothes on, finding themselves
in unfamiliar surroundings with unfamiliar people, or having
actually been sexually assaulted while under the influence of
the drug. 
<P>

As insidious, disgusting and perilous as this may sound, the
dangers don't stop there. Besides the worries of unprotected
sex, Rohypnol, particularly when mixed with alcohol or other
drugs may lead to respiratory depression, aspiration, and even
death. When taken repeatedly, it can lead to physical and
psychic dependence, which is thought to increase with both dose
and duration of use. An amnesia producing effect of "Roofies"
may prevent users from remembering how or why they took the drug
or even that they were given it by others. This makes
investigation of sexually related or other offenses very
difficult and may account for repeated reports of "date rapes"
involving the use of the drug.
<P>

Both law enforcement and drug counseling services caution that
the use of Rohypnol is increasing and that additional quantities
of it are being imported across the Mexican border, where it can
be obtained by prescription. ERRI drug abuse analysts warn that
"Roofies" are  just another in a long list of dangerous drugs
that are being imported and "pushed" to the impressionable youth
of this country.

since then. According to police sources in both Florida and
Texas, "roofies" were first seen in the United States in the
early 1990's; they quickly gained acceptance and use by both
high school and college students. According to the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) more than 1,000 cases of
illegal Rohypnol possession have been reported recently, in
thirteen states. Reports have also been received of it being
popular in "gay bars" in selected locations on both the East and
West coasts.  In fact, Rohypnol is now being reported as being
one of the "in" drugs on high school and college campuses and
particularly in college fraternities. And to make matters worse,
"Roofies" are inexpensive and reportedly being sold for as
little as $2.00-$4.00 per tablet in several locations.
<P>

According to a University of Florida drug hotline, "Roofies" are
often combined with alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine to produce a
rapid and very dramatic "high".  Even when used by itself, users
can appear extremely intoxicated, with slurred speech, no
coordination, swaying, and blood-shot eyes...with no odor of
alcohol. The drug has been added to punch and other drinks at
fraternity parties and college social gatherings, where it is
reportedly given to female party participants in hopes of
lowered inhibitions and facilitating potential sexual conquest. Police
departments in several parts of the country say that after
ingestion of "Roofies" that several young women have reported
waking up in frat houses with no clothes on, finding themselves
in unfamiliar surroundings with unfamiliar people, or having
actually been sexually assaulted while under the influence of
the drug. 
<P>

As insidious, disgusting and perilous as this may sound, the
dangers don't stop there. Besides the worries of unprotected
sex, Rohypnol, particularly when mixed with alcohol or other
drugs may lead to respiratory depression, aspiration, and even
death. When taken repeatedly, it can lead to physical and
psychic dependence, which is thought to increase with both dose
and duration of use. An amnesia producing effect of "Roofies"
may prevent users from remembering how or why they took the drug
or even that they were given it by others. This makes
investigation of sexually related or other offenses very
difficult and may account for repeated reports of "date rapes"
involving the use of the drug.
<P>

Both law enforcement and drug counseling services caution that
the use of Rohypnol is increasing and that additional quantities
of it are being imported across the Mexican border, where it can
be obtained by prescription. ERRI drug abuse analysts warn that
"Roofies" are  just another in a long list of dangerous drugs
that are being imported and "pushed" to the impressionable youth
of this country.

<H3>TERRORIST BOMB ATTACK IN SAUDI ARABIA...</H3>
<P>
<BR>
By Steve Macko 
    & Clark Staten
<P>

Two explosions, one of which was said to be a car bomb, exploded at
a Saudi Arabian National Guard training facility in the middle of
the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Monday morning.  Six people, including
five Americans were killed and 60 people, 34 of whom were also 
Americans, were injured.  Four of the dead victims were reported to 
be civilians employed by the U.S. Department of Defense and the other
two victims were military officers.  Three of the injured victims were
reported to be in critical condition.  The United States reportedly 
leases space at the facility.
<P>

Two previously unknown groups claimed responsibility for the terrorist 
attack that occurred at about 11:30 a.m.(0330 EST, 0830 GMT).  However, 
Saudi authorities are saying that they had received warnings of an 
impending attack.  A phone call was made to an international news 
agency after the blast.  The caller identified himself as being with a
previous unknown group called the "Tigers of the Gulf."  The caller
said that they were responsibile for the car bombing and "If the
Americans don't leave the Kingdom as soon as possible we will continue
our actions."  It was also reported that another unknown group is
claiming to be responsible for the bombing.
<P>

A spokesperson at the United States Embassy in Riyadh said, 
"I am told the explosion was massive and the damage was considerable."  
The U.S. Embassy also said that they understand that the bomb exploded 
in a parking lot at the facility.  30 vehicles were reportedly destroyed 
or burned in the blast.
<P>

After the explosion, there was an ensuing fire in the three-story
building that was the apparent target.  A spokesman for the the
United States Defense Department in Washington said that the 
Pentagon's National Military Command Center had received a preliminary
report indicating that there had been two explosions, an initial large
one and a secondary smaller one, about five minutes apart.  Even
though it is known that terrorists will leave a second explosive
device after an initial bomb blast so that rescuers will be wounded --
the second blast, in this instance, may have been caused by the gas tank 
of one of the vehicles exploding in the ensuing fire.  But this has not
been confirmed by authorities.
<P>

Saudi Arabian authorities said that the explosion was a deliberate
act of terrorism and the Saudi government was confident of "arresting
those who carried out this crime."
<P>

President Clinton reacted strongly to the attack on Monday morning.
The President said, "We have already begun the process of determining
what happened and who, if anyone, was responsible.  We will devote an
enormous effort to that."  Clinton also said, "We it to them and to all
of our citizens to increase our efforts to deter terrorism, to make
sure that those responsible for this hideous act are brought to justice,
to intensify and pressure the isolation of countries that support
terrorism ... and we must spare no effort to make sure our own law
enforcement officers have what they need to protect our citizens."
<P>

A special team from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, headed by
a supervisor from the bureau's National Security division is being
sent to Saudia Arabia to assist in the investigation.  A dozen Special
Agents from the FBI that includes evidence specialists and two bomb
specialists from the FBI laboratory are being sent.  Included in the
special team are two language specialists and an evidence response team
from the Boston office whose job it will be to gather and catlogue
evidence.

<H2>Gunman with Possible Explosives Strapped to His Body; Barricaded in Colorado Springs Office Building</H2>
By Clark Staten
<P>

(ENN) A man, believed to be a disgruntled former construction worker, is reportedly holed-up in the main administration building of a family focus forum in Colorado Springs, CO at this hour. According to witnesses, the unidentified gunman has both weapons and explosives and
has held police at bay since 2:30p.m. MDT this afternoon.
<P>

A Colorado Springs police spokesperson, Lt. Allan Scott, said that the man is holding what appears to be a "stick with an electrical switch on it." The 
stick is reportedly connected by wires to a some sort of a satchel strapped to the man's body. He is also reportedly armed with at least one handgun, which 
he kept brandishing and "playing with the hammer."
<P>

At least four hostages were originally taken by the gunman, two men and
two women. After two hours of negotiations with police, all four were 
released. One of the released hostages confirmed that the man had "some sort 
of device" attached to his torso and had talked about "blowing himself up."
<P>

The gunman reportedly entered the conservative Christian "Focus on Family" building in an attempt to redress grievances in regard to a workman's
compensation dispute, in which he didn't feel that he was adequately
compensated for injures he had received while helping to build the
three-story complex.
<P>

According to a police spokesperson, negotiations continue at this time
and police are hopeful of a peaceful resolution. The assailant has not
been identified.

Twelve members make up the Chicago Police Department Bomb Squad.
The unit considers themselves close-knit and they get to deal with
constant training, sophisticated tools and dark humor about bomb
scares that range from the truly bizarre to the truly terrifying.
<P>

According to 45-year-old Marty Gavin, a member of the bomb squad,
members of the unit must keep informed about the latest in
electronic gadgetry, as well as have nerves of steel.  Gavin, who
has been a CPD officer for 20 years and a member of the Bomb Squad
since 1989, said that his job has become more complex in this era 
of terrorist bombings, like the one that occurred at the World Trade 
Center in New York City and with the emergence of a high-tech Unabomber.  
Gavin said that the CPD Bomb Squad are studying the Unabomber's devices 
and modus operandi.
<P>

The unit is headquarted in a small office on the South Side of the
city.  Their office is called, "The Bat Cave."  In the Bat Cave,
the bomb squad spends much time training, studying and conducting
research.  When you enter the Bat Cave, you immediately notice the
torpedo that hangs from the ceiling.  On shelves you see hand
grenades, rockets and other types of bombs.  This is not your
typical office.
<P>

Toward the back of the office is a workshop.  In the workshop,
Officer Gavin and his colleagues reconstruct bombs and make
their own tools.
<P>

According to Special Agent Jerry Singer of the Chicago office of
the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF),
Illinois ranks second, behind California, in the number of
bombings.  The number of bombings in the State of Illinois has
risen by 66 percent in recent years.  In 1990, there were 275
reported bombing incidents.  In 1994, the figure had risen to 457.
<P>

According to ATF statistics, bombings in the United States, on a
whole, have risen 49 percent in the past five years.  In 1990,
there were 3,541 reported bombing incidents in the U.S.  That
number rose to 5,290 in 1994.
<P>

Special Agent Singer said, "The materials have always been
available to make the devices, but we're seeing more and more
people now willing to sit down and make them."
<P>

The Unabomber has forced bomb technicians to rethink the way
that they would disarm a suspicious package.  According to 
Gavin, before the Unabomber came along, "We'd be more inclined
to just blow it up."  But, today, bomb experts would try very
hard to "surgically" disable the bomb without destroying its
packaging or circuitry.  They would like to keep the device
intact so that it could be used for evidence and training.
<P>

The Chicago Bomb Squad is called out on an average of six
times a week.  They'll go out and handle anything from 
firecrackers that have exploded inside a mailbox to a remote-
control bomb used in a car or building.
<P>

The explosive device that they are most familiar with is --
the pipe bomb.  Pipe bombs are easy to make, according to 
Officer Gavin.  Gavin said that pipe bombs are usually nothing
like you see in the movies, where if you cut the wrong wire --
it explodes.
<P>

When the present CPD bomb squad was first created about 20 years 
ago -- the bomb technicians didn't have much in the way of equipment
and tools.  The technicians were forced to rely upon their street
smarts and a very simple device called a "jerkus rope" to dispose
of bombs.
<P>

The "jerkus rope" is exactly what it sounds like and is still used
today as a last resort in handling suspicious devices or packages.
Very simply, the jerkus rope is a long piece of rope that a bomb
technician loops around a suspicious package.  The rope is stretched
out and then "jerked" to see if the package explodes.  Officer
Ron Harris of the Bomb Squad said that there has been instances,
in the past, where one end of the jerkus rope is attached to the
suspicious package and the other end was tied to the rear bumper
of a car and they would hit the accelerator.
<P>

Bomb Squad members still carry the jerkus rope.  But, luckily, today,
they have many more sophisticated tools that they can now rely upon.
Some of these tools include: X-ray machines, robots, bomb-sniffing
dogs and a device with a science fiction sounding name of "disruptor."
A disruptor can fire water or slugs at a package with pinpoint
accuracy and is supposed to be able to break apart the circuitry of
an explosive device.
<P>

The bomb technicians prefer to disarm a bomb from a distance.
200 feet away is ideal and lessens the chance of any injury
should a bomb explode.  Gavin said, "Most people have the
impression that there's actually a hands-on physical clipping
of wires.  We would only do that in a life-or-death situation.
Most of our techniques are remote.  Whether it's a package bomb
or a car bomb, we are expected to do something.  There really
hasn't been anything where we haven't had options."
<P>

When the Bomb Squad goes out on a call, they approach each
situation in the same way -- "It's a bomb until we determine
it's not a bomb."  The officers see much in the way of hoaxes
and false alarms.  They've been called out to look at paperweights
that look like hand grenades and carrots that look like dynamite.

Gavin says that his job "is kind of a black art.  There is a kind
of mystique to it, about how bombs are made and how they are
rendered safe."
<P>

In November of 1995, Gavin and his partner were called to the 
Dirksen Federal Building to investigate a suspicious package
that was sent to a federal judge from a prison inmate.  The
bomb technicians X-rayed the package and were able to determine
that it was indeed a crude bomb, of some type.  They disabled
the device by using a high-powered jet of water from the disruptor.
<P>

On a cold Christmas Day, a few years ago, Gavin was sent to Chicago's
O'Hare International Airport to check on a plane that was forced
to land when a note was found on a tray on the jet that said,
"There's a bomb on the plane.  You're dead."
<P>

At O'Hare, the plane was evacuated and Gavin had to go aboard to
look for a bomb.  No bomb was ever found.  Gavin said, "It's kind
of an eerie feeling.  These people are counting on you to kind of
bless this plane and say it's alright.  It bothered me the rest
of the night.  You have to dismiss it, but the thought is always
there ... did I do enough?"
<P>

The most dangerous assignment that Gavin took in was on a night
in 1992, when a car exploded at Division Street and Dearborn
Street, located just north of Chicago's Loop.  The bombmaker,
who was a member of a motorcycle gang, was killed while transporting 
his own pipe bomb.  After the initial explosion, another pipe bomb
had rolled out of the wreckage of the vehicle and into the
intersection.  Gavin and other members of the Bomb Squad were
called out to disable the device.
<P>  

It took the bomb technicians about 20 minutes to render the
device safe.  Gavin remembers, "It was pandemonium that night.
Everyone was in the bars.  I thought it might be some kind of
trap.  Maybe someone in a bar would set it off by remote control."
<P>

The job also has it lighter moments.  One time, Gavin's partner,
Officer Harris, was sent to O'Hare Airport to check on a suspicious
piece of luggage that was found in the terminal.  The package was
"beeping and undulating."  The bomb techs X-rayed the suitcase
and did not like what they saw.  In the suitcase was an electronic
device that was connected to wires and batteries.  After carefully
opening the suitcase they found their "bomb."  The "bomb" was in
reality a vibrating sex toy.
<P>

In another instance, a suspicious package was sent to the office
of a Loop executive.  A note was attached that said that the
package contained the deadly E. coli bacteria.  The Chicago Fire
Department was first to arrive at the scene and they didn't know
what to do about the package.  So, they called for the CPD Bomb
Squad.
<P>

Officer Gavin arrived and X-rayed the package.  It was determined
that the package did not contain a bomb -- at least not in the
traditional sense.  Gavin picked up the package and handed it
to the fire department battalion chief. The chief then reportedly looked for some paramedics to help dispose of the biological hazard.

GARY W. NOESNER, M.Ed.
<P>

-Special Agent Botting is assigned to the FBI's Los Angeles Division.
<BR>
-Mr. Lanceley, a retired FBI special agent, formerly worked in the
Crisis Management Unit.
<BR>
-Special Agent Noesner is assigned to the Crisis Management Unit of
the FBI's Critical Incident Response Group.</center>
<P>

In the early 1980s, the country witnessed a rise in the number of
long-term hostage and barricade incidents. For example, members of
the Aryan Nation created a barricade situation on Whidbey Island,
Washington, in December 1984. Earlier, a small, right-wing survivalist
group known as the Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord was
involved in a similar incident in Arkansas. FBI hostage negotiators
successfully resolved these situations and others like them, but the
incidents challenged the crisis negotiation capacity of the FBI and
pointed to the need for a special response mechanism.
<P>

As a result, the Crisis Management Unit (CMU)1 at the FBI Academy
developed a new approach. In 1985, the CMU formed the Critical
Incident Negotiation Team (CINT), a small, highly trained and mobile
group of experienced FBI crisis negotiators. This team became the
nucleus of an organized response to complex and potentially lengthy
hostage and barricade incidents nationwide.
<P>

The FBI typically negotiates approximately 45 bank robbery and
hijacking hostage incidents annually. The wealth of knowledge
developed from these experiences, coupled with lessons learned from
other law enforcement agencies, prepare CINT members to handle
high-risk incidents. In addition to handling situations arising under FBI
jurisdiction, the CINT provides around-the-clock consultation to State
and local law enforcement agencies. 
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/bluefade.gif"></center>

<H3>Selection of Team Members</H3>

The original CINT members were drawn from a pool of more  than
350 FBI negotiators nationwide based on resume reviews, personal
interviews, psychological testing, and negotiation experience. This
group of 25 negotiators was multiracial and multilingual, with one
member being fluent in five languages. Most had been hostage
negotiators for 10-15 years and had extensive operational, investigative,
and training experience. Their diverse investigative experience included
foreign counterintelligence, counterterrorism, organized crime, and
general criminal investigation.
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/bluefade.gif"></center>

<H3>Training</H3>

Because most of those selected for CINT had been police instructors in
the field, they possessed an excellent working knowledge of negotiation
strategies, hostage and barricade techniques, and crisis management
principles, in addition to actual negotiation experience. Nevertheless,
CMU arranged and coordinated semiannual training seminars conducted
either at the FBI Academy or at other field locations that could
accommodate the team's special instructional needs. For example, the
team conducted joint training with the Department of Energy's Nuclear
Emergency Search Team (NEST) and participated in numerous
long-term national training exercises conducted in Albuquerque, New
Mexico; Camp Pendleton, California; and Indianapolis, Indiana.
Criminal profilers and mental health professionals experienced in
personality assessment also provided instruction for the team.
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/bluefade.gif"></center>

<H3>Preparation for Negotiations Overseas</H3>

The International Hostage Taking Act of 1984 tasked the FBI with
deploying agents overseas to conduct hijacking and kidnaping
investigations. This responsibility requires CINT members to interact
regularly with Department of State personnel and to receive overseas
operations training. Training in this area focuses on developing
meaningful threat assessments, devising strategies for responding to
ransom demands, and coordinating the efforts of the U.S. Embassy
staff, host country police, and intelligence agencies, as well as
employers and families of the victims.
<P>

Team members familiarize themselves with diplomatic procedures,
receive numerous inoculations for protection against disease, study
cultural variables, review overseas jurisdiction, and generally prepare
for rapid deployment abroad. CINT members also attend a 2-week
negotiation course offered by the Metropolitan Police Department in
London, England, for supplementary training.
<P>

In addition to general training, CINT also has focused on preparing for
specific threats. Immediately prior to the Gulf War in 1991, a special
session was held at the FBI Academy to prepare CINT negotiators to
deal with the potential threats posed by international terrorists. The
team reviewed past terrorist incidents in the Middle East and examined
the impact that culture, history, politics, and religion had on violence in
the region.
<P>

Today, training for CINT members continues on a regular basis to
address pertinent and current challenges and to maintain the team's
state-of-the-art readiness. Refresher training focuses on such areas as
nuclear, chemical, and biological extortion; cult ideology; international
terrorism; abnormal psychology; and crisis/suicide intervention.
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/bluefade.gif"></center>

<H3>Deployment</H3>

The FBI deploys CINT negotiators for one of two reasons. First, when
the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team responds to a hostage or barricade
incident, a negotiation program manager from the CMU accompanies
the team's advance group. Upon arrival at the scene, the program
manager confers with local field office negotiators to assess the
situation, the need for language or other specialty skills, the projected
time span of the situation, the availability of local FBI field office
negotiators, and the number of additional negotiators who may be
needed. The program manager then contacts appropriate CINT
members and instructs them to report to the scene, if warranted.
<P>

Since 1985, CINT members have negotiated domestic incidents such as
the Cuban prisoner uprisings in Oakdale, Louisiana; Atlanta, Georgia;
and Talladega, Alabama, as well as standoffs with religious zealots in
Marion, Utah; Ruby Creek, Idaho; and Waco, Texas. Other situations
where the team provided assistance include the Lucasville, Ohio, prison
riot and a week-long barricaded siege in Missoula, Montana.
<P>

CINT negotiators also respond to situations in other countries at the
request of a U.S. Ambassador, usually to assist in negotiating the
release of Americans held hostage or kidnaped by terrorists or other
criminal groups. In these international incidents, the CMU dispatches
selected negotiators either to the country where the hostages are being
held or to an adjacent country more receptive to the presence of
Americans. CINT members deployed overseas generally respond in
teams of two.
<P>

Since 1985, CINT negotiators have assisted in the release of American
hostages held in Ecuador, Chile, El Salvador, Bolivia, Colombia,
Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Zaire, Cambodia, and the Philippines.
These delicate international incidents require team members to work
closely with U.S. Embassy personnel, the families and employers of the
victims, and the law enforcement agencies of the host countries. As a
result of the team's successful record, requests for as-sistance continue
to increase. To date, team members have been deployed overseas 22
times.
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/bluefade.gif"></center>

<H3>International Assistance</H3>

Recently, the team acquired an additional mission_international police
training and consulting. As a result, CINT negotiators have met with
police forces around the globe to provide training in crisis
management as it pertains to kidnaping and hostage incidents.
<P>
<H4>Case Study</H4>

On October 25, 1993, deputy sheriffs in Missoula, Montana, attempted
to arrest a subject on an assault warrant. The subject fired a rifle shot
that shattered the windshield of the deputy's cruiser and slightly
wounded the officer. The subject subsequently barricaded himself inside
his home with his wife and three of his nine children. The subject, who
emigrated from the Ukraine 3 years earlier, had limited
English-speaking ability and a history of mental instability.
<P>

The Missoula County Sheriff's Department and Missoula Police
Department set up a perimeter and opened negotiations with the subject
in an attempt to resolve the standoff peacefully. However, the subject's
mental state and his insistence on speaking only in Russian complicated
the negotiations. Commanders at the scene called the CMU, which set
up telephonic support from CINT negotiators for the sheriff's and
police department's negotiators in Missoula. The FBI also dispatched
Russian-speaking agents to the scene to provide language support.
While these agents contributed valuable linguistic assistance, they were
not trained crisis negotiators.
<P>

Missoula County authorities subsequently requested the assistance of a
Russian-speaking negotiator. CMU identified two CINT members, one
a native Russian speaker and the other, an experienced Soviet
counterintelligence investigator, and immediately dispatched them from
Washington, DC, to Missoula.
<P>

To resolve the situation, the Russian-speaking CINT member directed
and coached the subject's wife as she spoke with her husband. By
closely following the guidance provided by the negotiators, she
ultimately convinced her husband to surrender. The direct involvement
of CINT members and the professional effort of the Missoula law
enforcement com-munity peacefully resolved the week-long standoff
without further incident.
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/bluefade.gif"></center>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

Protracted hostage and barricade situations present a special challenge
to law enforcement. By learning from past incidents and tapping into
the experiences of other law enforcement agencies worldwide, the FBI
Crisis Management Unit developed the Critical Incident Negotiation
Team. Through its training and consultation services, the team of
highly trained and experienced negotiators is available to assist law
enforcement agencies around the world to resolve peacefully complex,
high-risk incidents at any time, day or night. 
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/bluefade.gif"></center>

<H4>Endnote</H4>

Formerly the Special Operations and Research Unit, the CMU is now
part of the Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG).

<H3>Obtaining CINT Assistance</H3>

CINT negotiators provide telephonic consultation to law enforcement
agencies 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in response to hostage or
barricade incidents.

<font size=5><strong>ARIZONA MILITIA GROUP ARRESTED BY FEDERAL 
AUTHORITIES</strong></font>.<br>
<br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
PHOENIX (ENN) - Federal law enforcement authorities arrested thirteen members of what could be 
described as a very dangerous anti-government group calling itself the &quot;Viper Militia&quot; on Monday 
afternoon. The suspects are charged with plotting for more than two years to bomb government 
buildings. Members of the militia group are said to have held training exercises in the Arizona desert in 
which they detonated ammonium nitrate bombs.<br>
<br>
In Washington, at a news conference, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said that the group plotted to 
use explosives to destroy buildings that house: the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service (INS), the U.S. Secret Service (USSS), the Phoenix Police Department and 
the Arizona National Guard. Arrest and search warrants were carried out against the twelve suspects on 
Monday. An ATF bomb squad had to remove explosive material at one home in the Phoenix suburb of 
Peoria.<br>
<br>
In a videotape made by the militia group in May of 1994, a member talks about security measures, 
communications equipment and other features of targeted buildings. In Phoenix, U.S. Attorney Janet 
Napolitano said, &quot;The voiceover on the videotape gives advice on how to actually collapse the 
buildings.&quot; The narrator on the videotape suggests that &quot;anti-personnel devices&quot; could be placed in 
mailboxes near the entrance of a building that houses several federal agencies and said that by destroying 
a water main near the building could hamper firefighting efforts. The tape also showed the exterior of the 
building where the IRS is located and describes the schedules of security guards and other security 
measures.<br>
<br>
In describing an attack on the Phoenix Police Department, the narrator on the tape said that it would be 
difficult to take over the building, but that &quot;it would be a major political statement if it were taken over.&quot; 
The records and equipment inside of the building, according to the narrator, &quot;would be invaluable.&quot;<br>
<br>
Much of the information that lead to the indictments of this dangerous group came from an undercover 
Arizona State Police officer who infiltrated the group.<br>
<br>
A next door neighbor to two of the militia members who were arrested in Peoria described the men as 
&quot;definitely pro-gun people.&quot; The neighbor said that the people who associated with the suspects had 
expressed anger at the government's handling of the standoffs near Waco, Texas, and Ruby Ridge, 
Idaho. The neighbor said, &quot;I think they're like the rest of us, they get frustrated about legislation that 
restricts gun use.&quot;<br>
<br>
On Monday, it was announced that twelve militia members had been arrested in the conspiracy plot. On 
Tuesday morning, John Magaw, the director of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said 
that thirteen people have been arrested in connection with the case. The 13th person was arrested late 
on Monday night. Magaw warned, &quot;Terrorism has come to the United States. Do not forget for one 
minute the Oklahoma City bombing.&quot;</p>

<H2>SIX ALARM FIRE RAGES IN NYC COMMERCIAL BUILDING</H2>
By Jim Fay ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

FDNY Units battled a deep-seated fire in a Garment Center
commercial building this morning, March 1st, requiring
a not too often requirement of six alarms to contain it.
<P>

At approximately 0315 EST, FDNY units responded to initial
reports of a heavy smoke condition in the street at Eighth
Ave. and West 36 St.  First arriving units discovered a gas
fed fire in the basement of a Chinese restaurant at 525 Eighth
Ave.  An urgent request went out for Con Edison, the NYC
gas and electric company, to shut down the gas. However, the 
fire gained headway in the rear of the building,
extending upwards to the upper floors of the six story
commercial occupancy, before the gas company could respond.
<P>

Since the start of the FDNY, a five-alarm fire was the highest
number of alarms that could be transmitted.  Additional
units were summoned by way of a "Boro Call," in which a
greater alarm was transmitted for a location in another
Borough, and those units responded to the fifth alarm fire.
However, with the Computer-Assisted Dispatch System (CADS),
the additional units can be dispatched directly by the
Borough Dispatcher, regardless from what Borough they
respond from.  These units are just added as an additional
alarm.
<P>

The  fire in Manhattan continued out of control and
the sixth alarm was transmitted at approximately 0600 hrs.
EST.  Additional rescue and tower ladder companies were also
ordered to the scene, and Fire Department officials estimate
that the operation will be a lenghty one into most of
the day.  The Fire was in the proximity of the Lincoln
Tunnel, which caused a morning rush-hour problem.
One minor injury to a firefighter was reported.
<P>

By late morning, heavy fire was still reported in the fire
building.  More than 300 firefighters were on the scene.  Four
tower ladders were being used in an exterior attack.  An FDNY
spokesman said, "When it gets to be of such a magnitude, with
fire on all floors, it is easier to back out and fight it from
the exterior, so it takes longer."

<H2>Terrorism Alert; Concerns About Mid-East Inspired Attacks </H2>
By Steve Macko, Managing Editor
<P>

An ENN affiliate, the SNS News Service in Isreal, reported on Tuesday that security
for U.S. President Bill Clinton's trip to the country will be
very heavy.  SNS said that Israeli security officials are fearful
of an attempted attack against the President and other world leaders
by Hamas or the Islamic Jihad terror groups.
<P>

National Police Chief Assaf Hefetz said, "We fear there are suicide
bombers poised for action.  That is why there is a very high alert."
A United States Embassy spokesman said that security officials in
Isreal have advised President Clinton that he should restrict his
movements and that security concerns should take precedence during
his visit.
<P>

Overnight on Wednesday, the IDF reportedly arresting another twelve suspected
Moslem militants on the West Bank. Beginning on Wednesday evening and lasting until Thursday afternoon, about 5,000 troops will be deployed in Jerusalem to provide protection
for Mr. Clinton.  10,000 troops will be used throughout the country. 
The codename for the operation is "Song."  The security detail will be 
headed by Commander Arye Amit, who is the Jerusalem District Commander 
of the Police Department.
<P>

At about 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv Highway
(Road Number 1) will be closed to all traffic for about two-and-a-
half hours.  This will allow the Presidential motorcade to travel
from Ben Gurion International Airport to Jerusalem.  The highway
will then be shut down again on Thursday at about 2:30 p.m.
<P>
<HR>
				
All day Wednesday, security and intelligence agencies in the
Middle East and in the United States were buzzing about the
possibility that radical Palestinaian or other militant Islamic
fundamentalists could launch some kind of attack during President
Clinton's visit to Isreal.
<P>

Because security is very tight at the locale of the terrorism
summit in Egypt and in Isreal, terrorists may be forced to look
for suitable targets of attack elsewhere... most likely in the
Middle East.  Western Europe could also be a target.
<P>

ERRI is issuing an alert to Americans overseas and advises that
extreme caution should be undertaken.  The United States is
currently giving very visible support of Isreal at this time and
in the eyes of outlaw regime in Iran and its surrogate Muslim fanatics,
the United States is known as the "Great Satan." 
<P> 

Clark Staten, ERRI CT analyst, said, "The current threat level of possible attacks involving the United States, its leaders, and its facilities throughout the world is as high as it has been since the 1991 Persian Gulf War." "The anticipated threat against Israel is even higher than that," Staten concluded. 
After all factors have been added up -- ERRI feels that there is an increased threat
to Americans everywhere, at this time.

<B>Yahya Ayyash</B>
<P>
In light of recent developments in Israel and the Middle-East, much interest has been generated in the "The Engineer".  Yahya Ayyash allegedly led the military wing of Hamas and was well known for his proficiency as a "bomb maker". He was killed on Jan 5, 1996 by improvised explosive device contained within his cellular telephone. Israeli security officials have neither confirmed nor denied their involvement in Ayyash's death, but it is known that he was #1 on their most wanted list.

<P>
<B>Ramadan Abullah Shalah</B>
<P>
Shalah is reported to be the new operational leader of the Islamic Holy War group. Islamic Holy War or Jihad is an off-shoot of Hamas, although they may not be under direct operational control of them. Shalah and his group claimed that it was one of their members that undertook at least one of the recent suicide bus bombings in Jerusalem. Shalah was last reported to be living in Syria.

Dief is believed to have assumed command of the military brigades of Hamas following the death of Ayyash. He reportedly leads from a small house on the Gaza Strip, although he is known to travel frequently to both Lebanon and Syria.  He is currently among the most wanted by Israeli authorities.

<H2>757 Down in Ocean, 189 Feared Dead</H2>
By: Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>
189 passengers and crew members of a jetliner that had just
taken off from a Dominican Republican airport were feared
killed on Tuesday night when the plane apparently plunged into
the Atlantic Ocean.  The charter flight was bound for Frankfort,
Germany via Newfoundland, Canada.
<P>

Only small pieces of the plane were seen floating in the water
by rescuers.  Only about a dozen bodies had been recovered before
dawn.  The wreckage is said to be strewn across a two-mile long
stretch of the ocean.  Sharks were seen in the area of the crash
and it appeared that some of the recovered bodies had been mangled
by the sharks.  An officer for the United States Coast Guard, who
was involved in the recovery, said, "The area is shark-infested.
It obviously would hamper recovery of either survivors or bodies
from the water."
<P>

The plane disappeared from radar screens about five minutes after
taking off from the airport in Puerto Plata.  The plane took-off
at 2343 EST during a light rainshower.  The deputy director for
civil aeronautics in the Dominican Republic said, "The pilot
gave no indication of an emergency."  A conflicting report said
that the pilot had indicated a problem of unknown origin prior to
the crash and was attempting to return to the field. The jetliner 
was reportedly able to gain an altitude of 5,000 feet 
and was 12 miles off the coast of the Dominican Republic when
it disappeared from radar screens.
<P>

United States Coast Guard ships and planes were sent to the
scene of the crash to assist in the rescue/recovery.  A Coast
Guard petty officer said, "We found a wreckage field of about
50 to 100 yards wide and two miles long, and very small pieces
floating on the water.  There are no large pieces of the plane
to be seen."  No cause of the crash has been determined, but
an investigation has been begun. As of mid-day Wednesday, 
the bodies of 79 victims had been recovered.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 15:00CST-01/06/96
<P>
<H2>'Roofies', The New "Date Rape" Drug of Choice</H2>
By Clark Staten, ERRI Executive Director
<P>

Chicago, IL., January 6, 1995 (ENN) --Like the Quaaludes of the
60's and 70's, there is a new "love drug" being abused in
several parts of the country.  The drug is Rohypnol, or
"Roofies" as it being is called on the street. It is also called
"ruffies", "roche", "R-2", "rib" and "rope" and reportedly is
quickly becoming the "date rape drug of choice."
<P>

Rohypnol is a brand name for flunitrazepam (a benzodiazepine), a
very potent tranquilizer similar in nature to valium (diazepam),
but many times stronger. The drug produces a sedative effect,
amnesia, muscle relaxation, and a slowing of psychomotor
responses. Sedation occurs 20-30 minutes after administration
and lasts for several hours. The drug is often distributed on the street in
it's original "bubble packaging" which adds an air of legitimacy
and makes it appear to be legal. The drug is not commonly used
by physicians in the United States and is not even listed in the
commonly used Physician's Desk Reference.
<P>

Illicit use of Rohypnol was originally reported in Europe in the
late 1970's and world-wide use of it has continually increased
since then. According to police sources in both Florida and
Texas, "roofies" were first seen in the United States in the
early 1990's; they quickly gained acceptance and use by both
high school and college students. According to the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) more than 1,000 cases of
illegal Rohypnol possession have been reported recently, in
thirteen states. Reports have also been received of it being
popular in "gay bars" in selected locations on both the East and
West coasts.  In fact, Rohypnol is now being reported as being
one of the "in" drugs on high school and college campuses and
particularly in college fraternities. And to make matters worse,
"Roofies" are inexpensive and reportedly being sold for as
little as $2.00-$4.00 per tablet in several locations.
<P>

According to a University of Florida drug hotline, "Roofies" are
often combined with alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine to produce a
rapid and very dramatic "high".  Even when used by itself, users
can appear extremely intoxicated, with slurred speech, no
coordination, swaying, and blood-shot eyes...with no odor of
alcohol. The drug has been added to punch and other drinks at
fraternity parties and college social gatherings, where it is
reportedly given to female party participants in hopes of
lowered inhibitions and facilitating potential sexual conquest. Police
departments in several parts of the country say that after
ingestion of "Roofies" that several young women have reported
waking up in frat houses with no clothes on, finding themselves
in unfamiliar surroundings with unfamiliar people, or having
actually been sexually assaulted while under the influence of
the drug. 
<P>

As insidious, disgusting and perilous as this may sound, the
dangers don't stop there. Besides the worries of unprotected
sex, Rohypnol, particularly when mixed with alcohol or other
drugs may lead to respiratory depression, aspiration, and even
death. When taken repeatedly, it can lead to physical and
psychic dependence, which is thought to increase with both dose
and duration of use. An amnesia producing effect of "Roofies"
may prevent users from remembering how or why they took the drug
or even that they were given it by others. This makes
investigation of sexually related or other offenses very
difficult and may account for repeated reports of "date rapes"
involving the use of the drug.
<P>

Both law enforcement and drug counseling services caution that
the use of Rohypnol is increasing and that additional quantities
of it are being imported across the Mexican border, where it can
be obtained by prescription. ERRI drug abuse analysts warn that
"Roofies" are  just another in a long list of dangerous drugs
that are being imported and "pushed" to the impressionable youth
of this country.

<H2>RISING GANG VIOLENCE RESULT OF "TURF WARS"</H2>
By Amy Grant, Medical Correspondent
<P>
Chicago, IL. - The recent shootings of two Chicago Police
officers, and the wounding and killing of hundreds of other
Chicago citizens are the direct or indirect result of an
ongoing attempt by "streetgangs" from out of state to gain
control of given neighborhoods here, according to Clark
Staten, Executive Director of the Chicago-based Emergency
Response & Research Institute.  Staten, who studies all types
of emergency response issues, says that there are at least
four major "gang and drug" pipelines operating into and out
of the Chicago area.
<P>

According to the veteran paramedic, former police officer,
and intelligence analyst, one of the major "pipelines" leads
to New York.  This can be evidenced, he says, by the recently
announced fugitive status of three reported Jamaican gang
members who are suspected in the recent Chicago Police
shootings. In New York City, the "Jamaicans" are known as
some of the most violent and ruthless of gang members. The
Jamaicans are also known to be extremely "closeknit", and are
said to have a very closely held network of drug couriers to
and from the Caribbean.
<P>

New York City Police and Paramedics report a recent, violent,
expansion of their activities in the New York and New Jersey
area.  Distribution of drugs, particularly cocaine, is now
reportedly being carried out throughout other parts of the
country. Intelligence sources indicate that the "Jamaicans"
are now currently operating in the Kenmore/Winthrop corridor
on Chicago's Northeast side.  Further, they have reportedly
been attempting to gain control of drug traffic in several
Uptown and Roger's Park neighborhoods.  This has led to
several recent shootings and attempts at intimidation.
Reports have also been recieved of an ongoing conflict
between the Jamaicans and members of a Chicago gang called
the "Black Gangster Disciples" over the control of areas in
which to sell drugs.
<P>

A second and burgeoning "pipeline" leads to Los Angeles and
the "Crips" streetgang. Evidence of involvement by Los-
Angeles based gangs on Chicago's Westside is continually
being gathered by Chicago police and paramedics. On at least
two occasions weapons and explosives have been confiscated,
that supposedly belong to members of the now infamous
California gang.
<P>

For example, a November 4th, 1991 "raid" on a garage in the
1400 block of So. Ridgeway Ave. resulted the in the
confiscation of Seven (7) military fragmentation hand
grenades, three (3) Soviet "AK-47" Assault rifles, one (1)
Soviet "SKS" Assault rifle, one (1) British "Sten"
Machinegun, one (1) Ruger Semi-auto carbine, several 9mm and
.45 caliber pistols, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. A
burglary suspect that voluntarily helped to locate the
weapons is quoted as saying that the weapons belonged to a
member of the L.A. "Crips" street gang.
<P>

Reports have also been recieved that members of the "Crips"
are said have formed an temporary alliance with members of at
least two factions of the Westside Chicago "Vice Lords"
street gang.  The alliance is said to have involved the
outright distribution of large quantities of drugs and the
trading of guns for drugs.  The "Vice Lords" are said to
control much of the drug traffic on the Westside and are
thought to expanding into other areas of the country.
Reportedly there are Chicago connected "chapters" of the Vice
Lords in such unlikely places as Green Bay, Wisconsin and Des
Moines, Iowa.
<P>

Due to a desire for expansion by both the Chicago and L.A.
gangs into untapped drug markets, a reputable crime analyst
who has requested anonymity, says that in some ways the
linking of the "Crips" and "Vice-Lords" is "an evil natural".
He said, "They both are in it for the money... and in
Chicago, the Vice Lords already control much of the traffic
on the Westside".  "They either have to form some sort of
strategic alliance or fight each other for each block and
street corner", he continued.
<P>

"If they combine forces, the `Vice Lords' obtain vast
quantities of drugs and exotic weaponry, and the "Crips' are
afforded the protection that they need to operate in a
`hostile' environment", he continued.  "In the case of any
out-of-state expansion their combining resources makes good
business sense because, together, there is often no one with
the power to fight the two of them... in the smaller towns
that they are now invading", he told EmergencyNet NEWS.
<P>

"Presently, the violent struggles are about determining who
gets what share of what territory and how the `spoils' will
be distributed", the veteran reviewer said. "There are also
several groups that do not want to form any sort of alliance
and are protecting their `turf' with automatic weapons and
explosives... the large numbers of dead and wounded in recent
months are the results of this resistance", the analyst
concluded.
<P>

An informed drug enforcement agent say that there is also
evidence of the "Crips" attempting to also gain a foothold on
parts of Chicago's Southside. Recent reports have been
received that suggest that members of the "Crips" have been
linked with selling drugs and guns in the vicinity of the
Chicago Housing Authority's Robert Taylor Homes.
<P>

Another report indicates that members of the "Crips" are
thought to be fighting with members of both the "Black
Disciples" and the "Gangster Disciples" in order to further
drug distribution networks in the Chicago Housing Authority
projects. There is a definite difference between the two
Chicago groups, and they also frequently shoot at each other
for control of the "valuable" drug territories in the South
State Street corridor.
<P>

The third drug "pipeline", leads to Mexico and several points
South of there.  It involves the "Hispanic connection". The
largest hispanic gang in the city is the "Latin Kings".  They
have various chapters throughout the city and are known for
their participation in and control of narcotics sales, in the
neighborhoods that they frequent. The "Latin Kings" are also
known as one of the most violent street gangs in the City of
Chicago.
<P>

Involvement has been reported between the notorious "Herrera
Drug Family" and the "Latin Kings".  Although several family
members are in jail, the Herrera's were previously known to
be the distributors of high potency Mexican "Brown Heroin"
that has been popular at various times with Chicago's
"Junkie" population.  The "Latin Kings" also deal in large
amounts of cocaine.  It is believed that it is smuggled from
Peru and Columbia, through Mexico, by gang "mules" of Mexican
descent.  Reportedly, more than one "Latin King" has returned
to Mexico or Central America "for a short vacation" and soon
turned up "back in the hood" with a new car and lots of
spending money.
<P>

At least one Chicago analyst says that there are hints of a
direct connection between a faction of the "Latin Kings" and
couriers of the Columbia-based Mendallin drug cartel.  A
continued proliferation of regular and "crack" cocaine would
seem to signify significant supplies are constantly being
made available to members of the "Latin Kings".  Police
sources confirm that the "Kings" are frequently arrested for
possession of varying amounts of the high-quality and illicit
substance.  Police also say that the "Latin Kings" run
several "drive-up" drug delivery operations in the Humboldt
Park area of Chicago.
<P>

The fourth connection "pipeline" involves Asian-Americans,
particularly those of Chinese extraction. The links to the
old "Burma Triangle" drug production area, that were shown to
have been exploited throughout the Viet Nam War, are still
thought to be active in a small segment of the Chinese
community.  Although extremely difficult to infiltrate, some
drug intelligence information has still been obtained that
indicates that there is an "Asian Connection".
<P>

The primary drugs provided by the Asian drug couriers are
"Poppy-based" and generally involve the addicting opiates.
"China White" Heroin is a particular example of the type of
drugs that are sold, often in bulk, by Asian wholesale
dealers.  Many, if not most, of the transactions involve
sales by Chinese "merchants" to black or hispanic middle-men,
who then sell them to street level dealers.  There are also
Asian "street gangs" who are used as enforcement tools by the
drug dealers.  Although small in number, the members of the
"Asian Connection" are thought to control a substantial part
of the heroin Traffic in the Chicago area.
<P>

Staten points out that not all drug transactions are
exclusively tied to "streetgangs", and that there are
numerous unorganized sources of purchase.  Traditional
organized crime is also responsible for a sizable percentage
of the drug traffic in the Chicago area, according to Police
crime statistics.  Although commonly involved in
prostitution, gambling, extortion, and protection rackets,
the "mafioso" is reportedly now heavily involved in drug
distribution in the Midwest and elsewhere.  This is unlike
several years ago, when the "Wiseguys" were prohibited by
strict internal rules from trafficking in drugs.  Recent
years, however, have seen much "Mob" involvement in this most
profitable business.
<P>

In conclusion, Staten indicated that the ties between the
various groups mentioned are transient and often disjointed.
Further, he indicated that the dynamics of drug buying and
selling are based on a fairly traditional supply and demand
scheme that causes alliances and enemies to "change as
frequently as the weather". But, he noted, the violence
perpetrated by the combination of these groups is certainly
reason for everyone's concern. According to Staten, "The
continued proliferation of these gangs and drugs does
nothing...but, breed death and destruction for the rest of
us".  He strongly recommends that additional resources be
made available to Police to combat this growing menace.

<H3>THE CHICAGO FIRE DEPARTMENT</H3>
<BR>

The Chicago Fire Department is the largest fire department in the
Midwest region of the United States.  The City of Chicago covers
228 square miles and has a population of just under 3 million.
<P>

The primary responsibility of the CFD includes the obvious
responsibilities of preservation of life and property from
fire, but it is also responsible for the response and mitigation
of hazardous materials and the delivery of Emergency Medical Service.
The Chicago Fire Department operates the largest totally Advanced
Life Support ambulance system in the world.  The fire department
also responds to many other non-fire emergency responses.
<P>

The Chicago Fire Department has the following resources available:
98 Engine Companies, 59 Truck Companies, 4 Squad companies,
24 Battalion Chiefs, 6 Deputy District Chiefs, 59 Ambulance Companies,
1 Fireboat, 5 Command Vans, and a number of other specialized pieces
of Equipment.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

<H5>
Bureau of Fire Suppression and Rescue</H5>
<BR>
Generally referred to as just, "Suppression," this is the firefighting
force of the department.  Suppression is broken down into six districts
that are each commanded by a District Chief and a Deputy District Chief.
District Chiefs work normal business hours, except when one is assigned
to the "Duty."  When a District Chief is assigned the "Duty" he is on
24-hour call for citywide extra alarm fires and other emergencies.
Deputy District Chiefs work the same type of shift as other members of
subordinate rank in the department.  They work a 24-hour shift and then
are off for 48 hours.
<P>
Districts
<BR>
Each District in the Chicago Fire Department is comprised of four
Battalions.  Each Battalion is commanded by a Battalion Chief.  Each
Battalion is made up of a number of Engine companies and Truck Companies.
Some Battalions have Squad Companies and other miscellaneous units,
such as: chemical units, smoke ejectors, command vans, etc...

<H5>Chicago O'Hare International Airport</H5>
<BR>
Chicago is the home of the "World's Busiest Airport."  O'Hare is located
in the far Northwest portion of the city.  Since many people reading
this on the World Wide Web may, in fact, come through Chicago in their
travels we thought that we would include some information on the
extraordinary and interesting array of specialized fire equipment that
resides at the three Crash stations at the airport.  Presently, the
CFD is not the only fire department at O'Hare.  The United States
Air Force also maintains a large contingent of fire equipment there.
These well trained Air Force Crash teams work very closely with the
units of the 12th Battalion at O'Hare.
<P>

The fire equipment at O'Hare is top-of-the-line and state-of-the-art.
This airport is one of the few airports where commercial pilots feel
very confident about coming to when they have an on-board emergency.
<P>

The following is a list of fire equipment that is stationed at O'Hare:

Battalion Chief 12
<BR>
Engine 9 - 1992 Federal/Emergency One  2000/750/300 with a 50-foot Squrt
<BR>
Engine 10 - identical to Engine 9
<BR>
Tower Ladder 63 - 1988 Federal/Emergency One 95-foot ladder
<BR>
Squad 7 - 1988 Spartan/Super Vac
<BR>
Command Van 2-7-8
<BR>
Ambulance 16
<BR>
Ambulance 26
<BR>
Ambulance 59
<BR>
Aircraft Stairway 6-3-5
<BR>
Crash units: 6-5-1, 6-5-3, 6-5-4, 6-5-5, 6-5-6, 6-5-7, 6-5-8, 6-5-10, 6-5-11
<BR>
<P>
Most of the Crash rigs are Oshkosh T-3000's with 3185 gallons of water
and 420 gallons of foam.  It would take 9555 gallons of water or three
full tanks of water to "eat up" or use up the 420 gallons of foam that is 
carried on-board these rigs.  Units 6-5-1, 6-5-10 and 6-5-11 are reserve
rigs.
<P>
The newest Crash Rig is 6-5-3, which is an Oshkosh T-3000 and is equipped
with a "Snozzle."  A Snozzle is a device that looks like an arm and has
the ability to puncture the thin aluminum skin of an aircraft and inject
foam or water to the inside of the plane.  This Snozzle is also supposed
to be able to be equipped with a television camera that is capable of
seeing inside of the aircraft.
<P>
The United States Air Force has the following equipment assigned to the airport:
<BR>
Chief 2
<BR>
Red 3 - Quality P-2 Crash Rig w/ 2000 gal of water and 205 gal of foam
<BR>
Red 4 - identical to Red 3
<BR>
Red 5 - Ford F350 Rapid Intervention Vehicle. Carries foam products.
<BR>
Red 6 - Chevy C30 Rescue Vehicle
<BR>
Red 8 - Oshkosh P-4 Crash Rig w/ 1500 gal of water and 105 gal of foam
<BR>
Red 9 - Oshkosh P-19 Crash Rig w/ 1000 gal of water and 130 gal of foam
<BR>
Red 11 - Engine company
<BR>

Take all of the firefighting equipment at O'Hare and you have an
impressive armada.
<BR>

Emergency communications at O'Hare is handled by the multi-million
dollar "Command Center" which is a new state-of-the-art communications
and crisis management center that has set a standard for all other
airports, which now model their communications centers after O'Hare.
<P>

Chicago's O'Hare International Airport serves 66 million passengers
every year and has a total of six runways that sit on 7,800 acres --
the acreage is less than half the size of Dallas/Ft. Worth Airport
at 17,520 acres and only one quarter the size of Denver International
Airport at 34,000 acres.

5-11 Alarm (additional response) = 4 engines
<P>

Special Alarm = any additional equipment that is requested for by the
Incident Commander.  Usually five engine companies.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>Hazardous Materials Response Procedures</H5>
<BR>

The mission of the CFD, in a Hazardous Materials incident, is to
isolate, contain and stabalize hazardous materials until such time
as the proper officials require the owner of the product to properly
dispose of the material.
<P>

Hazardous materials are defined as: any explosive, flammable, oxidizer,
poison, etiologic agent, radioactive, corrosive or other substance or
material, in a quantity or form that may pose an unreasonable risk to
health, safety and the environment.
<P>

Response
<BR>

Level 1 = Is the minimum initial response to any suspected or potential
Hazardous Materials incident.  This level is primarily for investigative
activities and/or to mitigate incidents involving small quantities or
low potential materials.  A Level 1 HazMat response consists of:
one battalion chief, one engine, one truck, one ambulance and a HIT
task force of: one squad and the Hazardous Materials Squad 5-1-1.
<P>

Level 2 = Is a confirmed incident involving a moderate or high potential
and/or a large quantity of material; or an incident requiring protective
clothing above Level D (Structural firefighting clothes); or an incident
requiring the need to initiate an evacuation.  A Level 2 HazMat response
consists of the following units: one Deputy District Chief, one HIT
Task Force Team engine, one HIT Task Force Team truck, one Safety Officer,
one EMS Field Officer, one Air Mask Support Vehicle and one command van.
<P>

Level 3 = Level 3 HazMat incidents are rarely called.  This would be
an extensive incident which may require additional manpower, more
supplies than are normally carried by the HIT Task Force, and an
expanded evacuation area.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

<H5>
Emergency Medical Service Response Procedures</H5>

Chicago, IL., January 6, 1995 (ENN) --Like the Quaaludes of the
60's and 70's, there is a new "love drug" being abused in
several parts of the country.  The drug is Rohypnol, or
"Roofies" as it being is called on the street. It is also called
"ruffies", "roche", "R-2", "rib" and "rope" and reportedly is
quickly becoming the "date rape drug of choice."
<P>

Rohypnol is a brand name for flunitrazepam (a benzodiazepine), a
very potent tranquilizer similar in nature to valium (diazepam),
but many times stronger. The drug produces a sedative effect,
amnesia, muscle relaxation, and a slowing of psychomotor
responses. Sedation occurs 20-30 minutes after administration
and lasts for several hours. The drug is often distributed on the street in
it's original "bubble packaging" which adds an air of legitimacy
and makes it appear to be legal. The drug is not commonly used
by physicians in the United States and is not even listed in the
commonly used Physician's Desk Reference.
<P>

Illicit use of Rohypnol was originally reported in Europe in the
late 1970's and world-wide use of it has continually increased
since then. According to police sources in both Florida and
Texas, "roofies" were first seen in the United States in the
early 1990's; they quickly gained acceptance and use by both
high school and college students. According to the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) more than 1,000 cases of
illegal Rohypnol possession have been reported recently, in
thirteen states. Reports have also been received of it being
popular in "gay bars" in selected locations on both the East and
West coasts.  In fact, Rohypnol is now being reported as being
one of the "in" drugs on high school and college campuses and
particularly in college fraternities. And to make matters worse,
"Roofies" are inexpensive and reportedly being sold for as
little as $2.00-$4.00 per tablet in several locations.
<P>

According to a University of Florida drug hotline, "Roofies" are
often combined with alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine to produce a
rapid and very dramatic "high".  Even when used by itself, users
can appear extremely intoxicated, with slurred speech, no
coordination, swaying, and blood-shot eyes...with no odor of
alcohol. The drug has been added to punch and other drinks at
fraternity parties and college social gatherings, where it is
reportedly given to female party participants in hopes of
lowered inhibitions and facilitating potential sexual conquest. Police
departments in several parts of the country say that after
ingestion of "Roofies" that several young women have reported
waking up in frat houses with no clothes on, finding themselves
in unfamiliar surroundings with unfamiliar people, or having
actually been sexually assaulted while under the influence of
the drug. 
<P>

As insidious, disgusting and perilous as this may sound, the
dangers don't stop there. Besides the worries of unprotected
sex, Rohypnol, particularly when mixed with alcohol or other
drugs may lead to respiratory depression, aspiration, and even
death. When taken repeatedly, it can lead to physical and
psychic dependence, which is thought to increase with both dose
and duration of use. An amnesia producing effect of "Roofies"
may prevent users from remembering how or why they took the drug
or even that they were given it by others. This makes
investigation of sexually related or other offenses very
difficult and may account for repeated reports of "date rapes"
involving the use of the drug.
<P>

Both law enforcement and drug counseling services caution that
the use of Rohypnol is increasing and that additional quantities
of it are being imported across the Mexican border, where it can
be obtained by prescription. ERRI drug abuse analysts warn that
"Roofies" are  just another in a long list of dangerous drugs
that are being imported and "pushed" to the impressionable youth
of this country.

<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
DCSD has completed their Wide Area Network (WAN) along with local area networks
(LAN) in each building.  In accordance with the district's goal to &quot;educate all students as they
prepare for a productive life in a changing world&quot; use of the Internet and associated technology is
playing an increasing role in student education.  Using the Internet to further the educational
process, goals and objectives is a natural extension of the district WAN, school LAN's and
classroom computers.

<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
<U>Purpose</U>

<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">

ethical and legal utilization of network resources.

<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>
<P><STRONG>Webmaster</STRONG>

<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
Defined:  A webmaster is the person who is responsible for the content and publication of their
school or district site World Wide Web homepage upon final approval of the school principal or

provided by the webmaster.<BR>
To keep the district web sever free of outdated or unused files, the district webmaster will
periodically purge all files, requiring each school webmaster to reload their new or updated files. 
Adequate advance notice will be provided to insure that backup files are present and updated.<BR>
The current district webmaster is Brad Paul.  <A HREF="mailto:Brad@cc.davis.k12.ut.us">Brad@cc.davis.k12.ut.us</A>

<P><STRONG>Sponsoring Teacher or administrator</STRONG>

<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">

<BR wp="br2">
Defined:	Student; Any student currently enrolled in the DCSD.

</P>
<P>District Employee; any person currently hired by DCSD or within a higher
education teacher candidate education program.<BR>
<BR wp="br2">
Any student wishing to publish a webpage must first have a teacher willing to sponsor their
material before it is submitted to their school's webmaster.  Any district employee is responsible
for meeting district guidelines before submission to their site webmaster.

<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>
<P><STRONG>Web Page Publishing Guidelines</STRONG>

<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
Each school web page shall contain a disclaimer statement similar to the following:

</P>
<P>&quot;We have made every reasonable attempt to insure that our web pages are educationally sound
and do not contain links to any questionable material or anything that can be deemed in violation
of the DCSD Acceptable Use Policy.&quot;

<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
	Material to be published must not display, access, or link to sites deemed offensive by the
DCSD Acceptable Use Policy.	All published material must have educational value and/or support the district guidelines,
goals and policies.
</P>
<P>	The only material to be published on the district web server must come from the designated
school or department site webmaster.	All personnel defined in this document must have on file the signed signature page found
below.  This signature page will reside with the school or district department administrator.

</P>
<P>	The web is a very dynamic resource.  It is strongly recommended that links to pre-existing
sites be checked regularly to insure that their links are not going to sites that do not meet
DCSD's acceptable use policy.<BR>
	Student work should not be published on a web site unless both the student and the parent(s)
or guardian(s) have signed the signature page found below. <I>An exception would be if the work is part of an existing publication such as a newspaper or school newsletter (Amended 12/11/96).</I><BR>
	Please pay particular attention to the copyright information found below.<BR>
	The principal or district supervisor should designate an additional staff member in each school
or department (if it is not the webmaster) to regularly &quot;visit&quot; their web site to check for
appropriateness and the legal issues which may arise when a school or district department
engages in global publishing.  

</P>
<P>&nbsp;
</P>
<P><STRONG>	Copyright Issues</STRONG>

</P>
<P>	

		The Internet has grown from a relatively small government project to a world wide
computer network with many different types of users with many different purposes for their
presence.  One does not have to look very far to see that copyright issues are often brushed
aside or completely ignored.  As an educational institution we should be aware of the
necessity of conforming to all laws, regardless of how they may be perceived on the Internet. 
The guidelines stated herein are not only for our own protection but for teaching by example
those principles we wish to instill within our students.

</P>
<P>		The following information was taken and modified from &quot;Keeping It Legal: Questions
Arising out of Web Site Management&quot; by Jamie KcKenzie, with permission.

</P>
<P>	The copyright law and the courts have provided exceptions to the rules that govern the
behavior of teachers, students, and schools.   In general terms, teachers, students and schools
are allowed to make &quot;fair use&quot; of materials for instructional purposes.  &quot;Fair use&quot; has been
interpreted to include those limited uses which are not likely to deprive a publisher or an
author from income.

</P>
<P>		&quot;Fair use&quot; of Internet resources by teachers, students, schools or district personnel should
parallel the use of printed resources.  Teachers and students might make limited use of some
text and graphics within their own classrooms.  They should not &quot;publish&quot; those same
materials across other classrooms within the building by posting on a local area network
(LAN) or across other classrooms in other building on a wide area network (WAN) or the
World Wide Web.

</P>
<P>		Teachers and students might make rather liberal use of information, text and graphics so
long as their resulting works remain within the classroom setting.  The moment the works
move out of the classroom, they may fall under a &quot;public performance&quot; clause of the
copyright law which imposes much greater restrictions and fees.  

</P>
<P>		Many schools and district departments have purchased clip art collections to use within
their classroom or department.  In most cases, the agreement is printed on some kind of seal
which is broken upon opening.  In most cases there is specific language outlining your web
rights.  Most of these agreements require you to print a credit line on any document which you
are publishing which includes one or more graphics from the collection.  The best advice is to
read and follow the stipulations within the agreement.

</P>
<P>		Teachers, students nor district personnel may safely make use of other's materials
(graphics, text, etc.) when they publish on the Web unless they have requested and received
formal permission to do so.  This would include downloading or &quot;whacking&quot; another web
site's material down to their school server.  This should only be done after obtaining written
permission from the author of the desired site.

</P>
<P>		To avoid problems with what to use or not use, the following statement should be our
guide. <EM> Unless there is a clear statement that art, photos and text are &quot;public domain&quot; and
available for free use, one should assume that they are copyrighted.</EM> This material should not
be used for republication on a local area network, a wide area network or a Web site unless
permission is granted from the owner.

<P>        Internet access is coordinated through a complex associationof government agencies as well as regional and state networks. With access to computers and people all over the world also comesthe availability of materials that may not be considered to be ofeducational value in the context of the school setting.  DavisCounty School District has taken available precautions to restrictaccess to controversial materials.  However, on a global network itis impossible to control all materials and an industrious user maydiscover controversial information.  We firmly believe that thevaluable information and interaction available on this worldwidenetwork far outweigh the possibility that users may procurematerial that is not consistent with the educational goals of theDavis County School District.  </P>
<H4>Purpose</H4>
<P>          In addition, the smooth operation of the network reliesupon the proper conduct of the end-users who must adhere to strictguidelines.  These guidelines are provided so that you are aware ofthe responsibilities you are about to acquire.  In general,  yourresponsibilities require efficient, ethical, and legal utilization of thenetwork resources.          Each student applying for an account will participate in adiscussion with his or her sponsoring teacher regarding properbehavior and use of the network.  The signature(s) at the end ofthis document is (are) legally binding and indicate(s) the party(parties) who signed has (have) read the terms and conditionscarefully and understand(s) their significance and agree(s) to abideby these terms.                    </P>
<H4>Terms and Conditions of this Contract</H4>
<P><B>1.  Privileges.</B>  The use of electronic information resources is aprivilege, not a right.  Inappropriate use of these resources willresult in the loss of computer services, disciplinary action, and/orreferral to legal authorities.  The systems administrator will closean account if necessary.  An administrator or faculty member hasthe right to request, for cause, that the systems administrator deny,revoke, or suspend specific user accounts.<BR><B>2.  Acceptable Use.</B>  The use of an assigned account must be insupport of education, business and/or research and within theeducational goals and objectives of the Davis County SchoolDistrict (these may be found in the District document entitled&quot;Davis County School District Strategic Plan&quot;).   Each user ispersonally responsible for this provision at all times when using theelectronic information service.</P>

<LI>Do not use the network in any way that would                disrupt network use by others.<BR></LI>
</UL><B>3.  Network Etiquette.</B>  Each account holder is expected to abideby the generally accepted rules of user etiquette.  These rulesinclude, but are not limited to, the following:

Do not demonstrate the problem to other users.  
<BR>
  <B>6. Updating.</B>  If any information on your account changes, e.g.,phone number, location, address, it is your responsibility to notifythe systems administrator.<BR>
<B>7. Services.</B>  The Davis County School District makes nowarranties of any kind whether expressed or implied, for theservice it is providing.

Summer School
</H1>
<P>Many Davis schools offer summer school classes in a variety of areas including 
biology, math, reading, computer skills, volleyball and other sports.  At the secondary 
schools, classes may be taken for both makeup and original credit.  
</P>
<P>Summer school is a self-supporting program, so tuition is charged to each student 
who participates.  Participation is voluntary.  If you are interested in summer school 
programs in your community, call your local school or Adult and Community Education at 
451-1135 after May 1 for class offerings.
</P>
<H1>Adult and Continuing Education
</H1>
<P>Adult and Continuing Education courses continue to offer excellent lifelong 
learning opportunities throughout Davis County.  Over 3,800 adults and more than 3,000 high 
school age students participate in high school completion courses during the evening in 
Davis County schools each year.  This amounts to 192,700 hours of classroom participation.
</P>
<P>An Adult High School Graduation in June highlights the achievements of adults 
who earned the Davis County Adult High School diploma.  Over 2,500 credits are earned 
by students taking courses at night.  This frees 83 classrooms averaging 30 students per 
class if courses had been taken during the day program.  163 adults also completed  the 
GED and earned credit toward their high school diplomas.
</P>
<P>Competency based education and computer aided instruction have reduced the 
&quot;seat-time&quot; frustration that many adults have faced when taking courses.   Additional home 
and video based educational opportunities are now available.
</P>
<P>Over 10,000 Community Education courses are taken by adults and youth interested 
in a wide variety of courses ranging from Auto Repairs to Dutch Oven Cooking.  Courses 
for recreation and self-esteem merge with computer and vocational offerings to 
provide positive experiences for all ages throughout the county.
</P>
<P>For more information about credit and noncredit offerings, contact the Adult 
and Community School director's office in Farmington at 546-7348, 451-1135  or your local 
adult education or community school coordinator located at each district high school.

<H3>Mountain High School
</H3>
<P>Mountain High School serves students in grades 10 through 12 who are seeking 
an alternative educational experience.  The schools seeks to serve these students by 
providing a flexible and personalized school climate where students' pace of progress 
toward graduation is based upon their willingness to engage in the work of the school.  
Mountain High School has an extended day (7:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) and an extended school 
calendar year (August - June).
</P>
<P>Three approaches to study are available to students at Mountain High School.
</P>
<P><B>Team Studies</B> emphasizes curricular integration and community-based 
learning activities.  Teachers and students work together on projects based on 
<I>Core Curriculum </I>standards with the objective of creating tangible products that demonstrate 
students' mastery of the standards.
</P>
<P><B>Directed Studies</B> emphasizes both curricular standards and student accountability. 
 Students earn credit by meeting standards of work completed, mastery as demonstrated 
by testing, and the keeping of time commitments.  Students may schedule hours according 
to personal needs, but are expected to keep the scheduled commitments they make.
</P>
<P><B>Home Studies</B> recognizes that a student may face circumstances that make 
attendance at school impossible.  Students earn credit by completing school work at home, with 
the expectation that 25-30 hours will be spent weekly on school work.  Weekly 
appointments with home study teachers or assistants provide time for tutoring and mastery testing.
</P>
<P>Students at Mountain High School may enroll in studies at the Davis Applied 
Technology Center or in other applied technology courses at Davis High School.  Mountain High 
School is fully accredited and follows Davis School District requirements for graduation.

</H1>
<P>There are many advantages to having a central system for energy.  With a 
computerized energy management system helping to operate the District's buildings' energy 
systems (heating, ventilating, air conditioning and some corridor and outside lighting), the 
District is getting a higher value for energy dollars.
</P>
<P>Based upon BTU's per square foot that were used in the buildings before the 
energy system was installed  and the current BTU's, the overall savings is between two and 
three million dollars a year.
</P>
<P>Because the energy system has report-back capabilities, security and fire 
protection systems were added at a nominal cost.
</P>
<H1>School Security
</H1>
<P>The security number for the District is 774-7670 (answered 24 hours a day).  
Citizens are encouraged to call reporting vandalism, property damage or suspicious activities at 
any school property.

</H1>
<P>The Davis District Crisis Team is composed of social workers, psychologists 
and counselors who have been trained in crisis response, suicide and other traumas.  
They volunteer their time for crisis work.  The team assembles at a school, by invitation of 
the principal, when the death of a student or faculty member has occurred.  In 
coordination with the school's existing mental health professionals, the team conducts crisis groups 
with students who have been impacted.
</P>
<P>In the group, students are encouraged to express grief, to develop a strategy for 
coping with the crisis and to identify peers and adults who can be their support network.  In 
the event of a suicide, crisis workers ask for a commitment from each group member not 
to copy the suicide.
</P>
<P>The team notifies the parents of students identified as being at-risk, and 
encourages them to get immediate mental health intervention.
</P>
<P>The goals of the crisis team are to prevent copycat suicides, offer grieving 
students emotional support and enable students to develop coping strategies. Support 
systems identify students at-risk for self-destructive behavior for an immediate referral.  The 
crisis team acts as an early response team, meeting the initial needs of the school during a 
crisis, but doesn't do long-term counseling with students.
</P>
<H3>
After Hours Student Assistance
</H3>
<P>
The Drug Free Schools Program provides after school group services, as requested 
by individual schools, for at-risk students needing intervention in such areas as 
divorce adjustment, school adjustment, anger management, violence prevention, coping skills, 
and grief.  Follow-up services are available for students impacted by a peer's suicide.  
Referral to more intensive intervention sources is made when indicated.

</H1>
<P>The Davis School District Foundation is a non-profit organization interested 
in improving our public schools.  Led by private citizens of various communities 
and professions, the Foundation secures contributions from private sources to fund 
enrichment and learning projects which cannot be funded through the normal budgetary process.
</P>
<P>It encourages businesses and individuals to forge an essential partnership with 
an individual school, a specific program or the complete district educational system.
</P>
<P>One person, one company or one contribution can make a vital difference.  The 
quality of a community's public school system is a key factor in the quality of life and the 
attraction of new business.
</P>
<P>All contributions are tax deductible to the extent of the law.  Gifts may be used for 
a designated purpose.  All contributions go directly to enrichment and learning activities, 
not to administrative costs.
</P>
<P>Contributions will be publicly recognized unless the donor wishes to remain 
anonymous.  Further questions may be answered by members of the citizen-based board 
of trustees or the Foundation Director, Sheryl Allen.
</P>
<P><B>Foundation, 451-1180</B></P>
<H1>
Parent Teacher Association (PTA)
</H1>
<P>PTA is a national volunteer organization dedicated to the welfare of all children.  A 
local unit operates in every elementary and secondary school in the Davis School District.  
The mission of the PTA is three-fold:
</P>
<P>1.  To support and speak in behalf of children and youth in the schools, in the 
community and before governmental agencies and other organizations that make 
decisions affecting children;
</P>
<P>2.  To assist parents in developing the skills they need to raise and protect their children; 
</P>
<P>3.  To encourage parent and public involvement in the public schools of this nation.
</P>
<P>PTA in Davis District works very hard to involve parents in programs and decisions 
that will directly affect their children.  Programs range from local programs such as 
health screenings, self-esteem building, classroom helpers, and parenting classes to input 
on District policy and lobbying on legislative issues regarding children.
</P>
<P>There is a place for every parent in PTA regardless of time or interests.  Becoming 
a member is easy.  Contact your local school for information, and then join in a 
combined effort that makes a difference for all the children in Davis District.</P>

</H1>
<P>The District's Spectrum Program provides opportunities and options for gifted 
and talented students within the educational system and is driven by the individual needs 
of the student.
</P>
<H3>Basic Classroom Spectrum Program
</H3>
<P>The K-12 education program is based on the Spectrum Policy adopted in June, 1992.  
 This policy suggests that a &quot;Spectrum of opportunities, resources, and encouragement 
be provided to each student based on that student's needs and talents.&quot;  These needs 
and talents are met through the use of the Talents Unlimited Model for creative and 
critical thinking, Differentiated Curriculum, as well as Curriculum Compacting.  The 
Spectrum Program is working to provide this in each classroom in the Davis District.
</P>
<H3>Elementary Spectrum programs:
</H3>
<UL>
<LI>     Schoolwide Enrichment Model (SEM) is the neighborhood school program based 
on Renzulli's Triad.  SEM provides a wide variety of enrichment activities for the 
entire school, as well as for a smaller group of students called the Talent Pool.
</LI>
<LI>     Satellite is a full-time accelerated academic program for high achieving students 
in grades 3, 4, 5 and 6 at four magnet locations:  Cook, Morgan, Valley View 
and Washington elementaries.
</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Secondary Spectrum opportunities:
</H3>
<UL>

</H1>
<P>The Davis County School District updated the Safe School Policy and it was 
approved by the Board of Education on December 5, 1995.  The intent of the policy is to provide 
a safe learning and teaching environment for students and staff.  A due process 
procedure for students caught in violation of the policy is an integral part of the policy.
</P>
<P>The policy requires Drug Free and Weapon Free zones at all school sites, facilities 
and buses.  All school activities are to be considered Drug and Weapon Free zones 
regardless of the location.  The policy clearly identifies what the District considers a violation, 
provides administrators with an investigation process and suggests the disciplinary action to 
be pursued should an infraction occur.
</P>
<P>Each classroom and school has a discipline plan and schools work with 
their communities to develop, refine and communicate their plan.  Student, teacher 
and administrator responsibilities are clearly spelled out.
</P>
<P>If a student does make a poor decision in relation to the Safe School Policy, he or 
she will be given the opportunity to discuss it with the administrator.  The administrator 
may involve the local law enforcement if a trained investigator is required to resolve the 
situation or if a serious violation takes place. 
</P>
<P>A serious violation of law or school policy will result in suspension, expulsion 
or exclusion.  Suspension is usually 10 school days or less.  Expulsion is removal from 
the school for a period longer than 10 days.  Exclusion is the ending of:  educational 
services, participation in any school or district activities and prohibits entering on district or 
school premises for a fixed or indefinite period of time.
</P>
<P>A violation under the Safe School Policy does not need to result in a conviction in 
court for the District to discipline a student according to the policy.
</P>
<P><B>The Davis School District Board of Education is committed to a quality 
educational experience for students and staff.  A major component of this 
educational process is safety for all.</B></P>

</H1>
<P>The SAT results for Davis county indicate all District averages are at or above 
State averages in grades 5, 8 and 11.  The Davis District grade level averages are also within 
the &quot;expected ranges&quot; as determined by the Utah State Office of Education in all subcategories. 
 Eighth grade math and reading scores were slightly lower than previous years and the 
fifth grade language score was four points higher.
</P>
<P>Because SAT scores are related to socioeconomic factors they are commonly 
reported within comparison bands.  The &quot;expected range&quot; is based on the scores of similar 
schools with comparable socioeconomic and demographic conditions, which allows for 
more informed and accurate comparisons.
</P>
<P>SAT Tests are taken in the fall at schools throughout the District and scores are 
median scores (middle scores).

</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#C4C0BD"><IMG ALIGN="bottom" SRC="bMEM.gif"><BR><H2>Welcome...</H2>The School Board and District staff appreciate your interest in the business of the school system.  Public understanding, participation and communication are vital to a successful educational environment for students in Davis County Schools.<H3>Board Members</H3>The School Board is comprised of five local citizens, each elected for a four-year term.  Three members will complete their terms in 1996, the other two in 1998.  A student member (non voting) may be appointed according to state guidelines for their senior year.Anyone who is 18 years old, a citizen of the United States for three months and a resident of the District for 30 days, is eligible to vote in school board elections.  Anyone who is a qualified voter and 21 years old may stand for election to the board.<H3>Duties and Responsibilities of the Board</H3><H4>General Duties</H4>The Board has complete and final control over local school matters within the framework set by the Utah Legislature and Utah State Board of Education.  The Board acts as a legislative body, determining general policies for the care, management, finance and programs of the District's public schools.  The Superintendent and his administrative staff are responsible for the execution of these policies.General Responsibilities<UL><LI>Define the general purpose of the District.</LI>
<LI>Set goals toward the achievement of District purposes.</LI>
<LI>Approve programs and organization for pursuing the District goals and purposes.</LI>
<LI>Secure resources for school operating needs and programs.</LI>
<LI>Decide how resources will be used.</LI>
<LI>Review all phases of the School District operation.</LI>
<LI>Evaluate general achievements of goals and progress.</LI>
<LI>Express and represent the views of the community in matters affecting education.</LI>
<LI>Interpret educational programs and needs of the community.</LI>
<LI>Communicate with other educational governing boards, municipal bodies and legislators.</LI>
</UL>
<P><IMG ALIGN LEFT SRC="DEASTMAN.gif"><B> Dan R. Eastman, PresidentPrecinct 2</B><BR>968 Canyon Crest, Bountiful, UT 84010295-5133</P>
<P>&quot;Our primary challenge in the Davis County School District is to provide balance -- balance between a scholastic education that prepares students to be productive in a competitive world and a social education to help them cope in the world of the mid 90s.  We have to do both while keeping faith with the taxpayers.&quot;</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN LEFT SRC="BSMITH.gif"><B> Barbara A. Smith, Vice Pres.Precinct 1</B><BR>1182 E. 1850 S., Bountiful, UT 84010298-8628</P>
<P>&quot;It is the District's responsibility to offer quality curriculum that meets the needs of the students.  A dedicated team of administrators, teachers, parents and students is necessary to prepare these students for the future.  Through cooperation, our graduates will learn the skills they need to lead productive, full lives.&quot;</P>
<P>  <IMG ALIGN LEFT SRC="DHILL.gif"><B> Dixie H. Hill,Precinct 3</B><BR>388 N. Angel St., Kaysville, UT 84037544-2104</P>
<P>Two years on the Board have given Mrs. Hill a more &quot;informed&quot; perspective about Davis County School District. Discouraged by the numbers of students vs. dollars, she would like the Board to become serious about charging impact fees on development.</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN LEFT SRC="DAVIS.gif"><B> Kathie Lee Dalton,Precinct 4</B><BR>272 W. 700 N., Layton, Utah 84041546-1522</P>
<P>Mrs. Dalton brings 15 years teaching experience and the viewpoint of a mother and grandmother to School Board meetings.  &quot;I am very concerned about safe, quality education for all students in the Davis District.  I want our students to be well prepared for whatever the future holds.&quot;</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN LEFT SRC="PHIPPS.gif"><B> Cheryl Phipps, Precinct 5</B><BR>623 N. 675 W., Clearfield, UT 84075773-1787</P>
<P>&quot;I believe in partnerships of schools, parents, communities and business, working toward a common goal of the best education possible.  I want to see parents strengthening their role in education and becoming more involved in the decision-making process.&quot;</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN LEFT SRC="KENDELL.gif" ALT="Richard Kendell"><B> Richard E. Kendell - Superintendent of Schools</B></P>
<P> The Superintendent is an ex-officio member of the Board and the chief executive officer in administering laws, regulations, and policies in the operation of the schools.  The Superintendent advises the Board on all matters concerning management of the schools and is responsible for giving direction to the staff.</P>
<P></P>
<H3>Recognition of the public</H3>Individuals or delegations that wish to appear before the Board should contact the Superintendent or the Board President 72 hours before the Board meeting.  The Board shall determine whether or not the items will be placed on the agenda.  Questions or comments will be entertained at the President&#213;s discretion, after Board discussion of the subjects under consideration.<H3>How you can be involved</H3>Citizen participation is one of the keys to our successful school programs. Each year interested community members serve on advisory councils (in areas such as vocational education, community school services and special education), advisory committees (school finance, safe schools, transportation, etc.) and PTA study committees (annual reviews of curriculum areas) and others.  Call Community Relations, 451-1296.The community is our greatest resource.  If you would like to be involved, call or stop by your local school and find out what you can do to help.  Volunteers are valuable in schools, tutoring students, community service council, PTA, assisting teachers, classroom resources, etc.  Call the Director of Volunteers, 451-1285 or your school.<H3>How you can be informed</H3>Copies of &quot;Board Briefs,&quot; a summary of action taken by the Board, are sent to schools, PTA and community leaders on a regular basis.They are also posted on the Internet at http://www.davis.k12.ut.us. Persons wishing to be on the mailing list should contact Community Relations, 451-1296.&quot;FOCUS,&quot; a report to the community published in January and September, is distributed with local newspapers.Copies of all policies established by the Board are available for examination through school principals or at the District Office Building through the policy director.<H3>Addressing your concerns</H3>Citizens with questions about the operation of schools are encouraged to first contact the teacher or staff member closest to the situation.  The next step is to communicate with the school principal.  Then, if necessary, concerns may be brought to the attention of a District area director.  Unresolved matters should then be brought to the Superintendent.<H3>Press coverage</H3>News media representatives are invited to each meeting.  Meetings are frequently covered by the Deseret News, Ogden Standard, Lakeside Review, Salt Lake Tribune, Davis Clipper, and in some cases television and radio news.<H3>Agenda</H3>Copies of the agenda are available outside of the Auditorium entrance.  The agenda contains the business to be considered at the meeting.  Board members receive the agenda and supporting documents in advance of each meeting so they may study the materials and be prepared to make decisions.Matters come before the Board on a Consent Agenda, requiring a majority Board approval.  More complex matters are presented first on a First Reading Agenda, giving time for public input before a Final Agenda vote.  Other matters are presented on an Information Agenda.The Board cannot make decisions on important questions without complete information and will usually not consider items not included on the agenda.  Exceptions to the order of business on the agenda may be made at the direction of the President and the Superintendent.<H3>Board meetings</H3>The Board meets regularly on the first and third Tuesdays of each month at 5:30 p.m.  Agendas are posted at the entrance to the District Office Building, 45 East State Street in Farmington.

<H3>

PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS</H3>
<P>
How do adults learn and develop?  Are there predictable life stages?  What are the characteristics of the stages of teacher development?  How do age and gender impact professional development?  How can teachers continue to work hard and progress without risking burnout?  What are your personal styles of learning, communicating, and relating to others?

An increased understanding of adult development can &quot;broaden the window&quot; through which we view ourselves and others.  It can positively impact how effectively we communicate with, respond to, and facilitate learning for ourselves and others.

This class is designed to give teachers a better understanding of the stages of adult development with an emphasis on clarifying and deepening personal and professional growth through self-awareness.</P>

<H3>CONFLICT MANAGEMENT</H3>
<P>
Conflict is a fact of life.  No school is conflict free, nor (believe it or not) would you want it to be...
Dealt with effectively, conflict can:
 	open the lines of communication
 	provide opportunities for creativity and growth
 	increase personal and organizational self-awareness
 	build and improve upon working relationships
Unfortunately, conflict (and the avoidance thereof) can be and often is destructive to people and organizations.  It results in a drain on the time and energy of teachers and administrators, and leads to dissatisfaction, upset and discouraged people.

The constructive use and resolution of conflict is an essential skill for administrators and a valuable tool for teachers.  This workshop will focus on helping participants understand the &quot;ten most deadly&quot; personalities, determine and understand their own preferred style of responding to conflict, and teach some specific skills for turning destructive conflict into win/win scenarios.

<P>     The District's annual recognition evening for outstanding teachers has become a premier event.  Each school selects one outstanding teacher to recognize. 
</P>
<P>     From the teachers who are nominated, the Teacher of the Year is selected as well as</P>
<P>     the Elementary and Secondary Teacher of the Year.  The Bountiful Auto Dealers      Association,   Northwest Pipeline, and Kern River Gas Transmission Company are     major sponsors of this event.</P>
<H4>     Artists In Residence
</H4>
<P>    This program is sponsored by the Utah Arts Council.  It provides an artist of choice for a school.   If the school has not had a previous grant,     the Foundation assists  schools with the match that is required.</P>
<P>     United Way  At Risk Students   The Foundation is a designated agency of United Way. These monies are used to fund At Risk Student Grants to teachers.     United Way  PARC  The Pioneer Adult Rehabilitation Center (PARC) is also a designated agency of United Way utilizing the Foundation's 501(c)(3) tax status. 
</P>
<H4>     PARC's mission is to enhance the quality of life for the severely disabled. </H4>
<P>     United Way  Teen Line  Teen Line is a United Way agency that receives funding through the application process.  It is a statewide telephone line using a 1800 number     where teens can call during evening hours to discuss problems.  Trained teen volunteers man the phones so that troubled callers are always talking to their peers.      However, a trained adult counselor is always available, if needed.  Teen Line's phone number is 1800479TEEN (8336).
</P>
<H3>V.   DONATIONS
</H3>
<P>Most donations received by the Davis School District Foundation have been designated for the support of individual school, district, or Foundation projects.  One hundred percent ofeach donation goes to the program or school designated by the donor.</P>
<P>     Payroll Deductions  It is now possible for district employees to sign up for a payroll deduction to the Foundation and designate a school or program of their choice. 
</P>
<P>     State Income Tax Checkoff  For several years, we have received funds designated for the Davis School District Foundation through the State Income Tax Checkoff     Program. Zions Bank Partners in Education Visa Card  This credit card is available to     district patrons.  This card rebates 1% of all purchases to Davis School District Foundation and 1/2% per year to the credit card holder.  Applications are available     at Zions Bank or from the Davis School District Foundation office.</P>
<H3>VI.  FUNDRAISING
</H3>
<P>PTA's and community councils have been major partners for the schools in our district.  In an effort to benefit local schools and enhance educational opportunities for students, most PTA's and/or school community councils do fundraising.  Fundraising projects need to be approved by the Davis School District Foundation and accepted as part of the schoolfundraising plan by the local school principal.</P>
<H3>VII. INVEST IN FUTURES
</H3>
<P>The focus on partnerships has been the Foundation's single largest initiative.  In concert with Governor Leavitt and school districts throughout Utah particularly along the Wasatch Front, we have worked to establish partnerships for our schools or to enhance existing partnerships. </P>
<P>Layton Hills Mall has also agreed to assist the Davis District Foundation to promote school/business partnerships.   The Foundation has been grateful for the assistance offeredby the Layton Hills Mall.</P>
<P>Four types of partnerships are encouraged:</P>
<P>     Partners in Education  offers businesses the opportunity to donate resources to an area school.
</P>
<P>     Crayons to Computers  businesses or individuals can donate unused materials to enhance classroom activities.
</P>
<P>     Adoptaclass  This program allows businesses to donate to an individual classroom and fulfill a &quot;wish list&quot; of teacher needs.
</P>
<P>     Teachers in Training  2600 teachers need training in classroom software technology.  A $100 donation will pay for a substitute teacher and the purchase of a     site license.  Teachers are trained at the District Technology Training Center at Woods Cross High School.
</P>
<H3>VIII.     SCHOLARSHIPS
</H3>
<P>The Foundation administers a growing number of scholarships.   Scholarships may be designated to a specific school.  Information can be obtained at each local high school inDavis School District.  </P>

<H1><IMG SRC="lowe-mrs.gif" ALIGN=left> Welcome to Clearfield High School's Home Page.  
I'm Tamara Lowe the Principal of the school.</H1>

<H2><STRONG>Can We Brag</STRONG>!</H2>
<UL>
<LI>We will have over 1800 students this year.
<LI>Green is our favorite color.
<LI>We have eleven outstanding Advanced Placement Classes.

<P>We are very proud of the accomplishments of our faculty and students.  Our 95-96 ACT composite score was 22.2, we had outstanding performances in athletic events, and several staff members were recognized for their work by selection for prestigious summer seminars and cash awards for excellence.
<P>This year our student leaders have the theme "<EM>Right Here, Right Now"</EM>  and they introduced an academic challenge to each grade level to raise the class GPA each term.
<P>The very best part of the Clearfield High tradition is the fact that we care about kids, and we put our actions where our mouth is.  We want to make our school a pleasant place to be where the adults meet students with a positive attitude, a smile, and an expectation of excellence.  This year we will be concentrating on preparing students to enter a career field of choice when they graduate.
<P>Several times a year we award "<EM>CHS Pride Pins"</EM> to students who have done something extra to make themselves or the school better.  Students have earned pins in the past for being a special friend to newcomers, for improved attendance or grades, for returning lost property intact, for cleaning up in the Commons without being asked, for service above that expected for the rest of the studentbody, etc.

<H4>Clearfield High School's Philosophy Statement</H4>
<P>	High school is not an end; it is part of a lifelong process of education.  We believe in preparing students for a 21<SUPER> st</SUPER> century world in which most will face multiple careers.  Proficiency in areas such as critical thinking, group collaboration, interpersonal skills, problem solving, and computer literacy must be acquired in order to succeed in a global society.  Students and teachers are encouraged to utilize community resources in order to enhance the curriculum.
<P>	Administrators and teachers will provide a safe learning environment in which challenging expectations are clearly understood.  Students need to be part of the goal setting/curriculum planning process in order to feel a sense of ownership in their education.  Students with special needs and circumstances particularly need a flexible curriculum with viable options to meet their needs.  
<P>	Teachers, students, and parents are all accountable in the learning process.  We encourage parents to reinforce the value of education,  attendance, punctuality, and a strong work ethic.   Attending school is a privilege; respect for the education process is a necessity.
<P>
