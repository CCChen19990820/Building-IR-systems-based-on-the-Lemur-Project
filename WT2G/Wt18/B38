Our constantly-updated mailing system holds some 175,000 companies in the key industrial sectors which can be accessed geographically, by SIC code or by number of employees.

<CENTER><table border=0 width=95%>
<tr>
<td valign=top width=70%>King Sturge & Co has taken a leading role in the evolution of out of town retailing.  This has included the conversion and redevelopment of industrial buildings during the 1970s, the developer lead retail park and food superstore boom of the 1980s to the purpose built retail and leisure parks and regional shopping centres of the 1990s.

New developments need to meet the demands created by the car-borne consumer which are now set against a background of stringent planning and environmental controls.  Mixed use retail and leisure schemes and a variety of new influences from Europe and America are creating a complex market for retailers, developers and property owners.

We offer a full range of agency and professional services including:

<UL>
<LI>Site identification and acquisition 
<LI>Development consultancy
<LI>Agency acquisitions and disposals
<LI>Planning
<LI>Development funding

offices and on mainland Europe, all qualified to advise on the
sale of every type of investment property from local High Street
shops to more complicated disposals such as major portfolios,
swap transactions and sale and leasebacks. We provide immediate
advice on value and the most appropriate method of disposal,
including the production of brochures, arranging marketing,
negotiating terms and reporting fully and on a regular basis to
the vendor throughout the disposal process - all culminating in
the maximisation of value.<p><br><b>INVESTMENT PURCHASE</b><P>We provide investment acquisition advice based on local, regional
and international expertise.  Our clients include institutions,
property companies, private investors and funds who retain us
either solely, for individual acquisitions, or to provide
discretionary acquisition advice.<P>

As part of our service, we provide Portfolio, Research and
Valuation advice.  We pride ourselves on our positive and pro-
active approach, which has resulted in more than 50% of our
clients' investment properties being acquired "off-market".</td>

Ensuring that the tenant is complying with the terms of the lease.

King Sturge & Co prides itself on the quality of service that it is able to provide to clients and has an established policy of maintaining a high ratio of partners to total staff numbers to ensure that a direct client/partner relationship is maintained.  We have achieved a widely recognised reputation for integrity and maintaining the confidentiality of clients' affairs whether valuing for balance sheet, Stock Exchange, privatisation, or alternative use purposes.<P>

Of particular significance is the recent experience of the firm in conducting asset valuations of very large property portfolios. For example for  English Partnerships (formerly English Estates), Welsh Development Agency and British Waterways.  In the private sector large portfolio valuations have been undertaken for Bilton plc, GKN plc (Westland Group), Frogmore Estates plc and Eskmuir Properties plc.  We were also appointed by the Department of Employment to carry out a valuation of the property assets of the Skills Training Agency prior to privatisation.<P>

In summary, King Sturge & Co. has outstanding past and current experience in carrying out valuations on large industrial and office portfolios not only for the private sector, but also for Government and Government funded bodies.<P>

The annual property Tax in the UK ("Rates") yields approximately the same amount as UK Corporation Tax. King Sturge & Co has widespread experience in challenging the valuation level and the extent of liability to rates throughout the UK.

Here are ten tips to make using this site more productive and enjoyable. Five specifically relate to the property search and five are more general.

<A NAME="etps"><td></A> If you have a specific requirement the quickest way of searching is to be as precise as the available options allow. Then, only those properties that fulfill your needs will be displayed. This method will return the smallest number (if any) of suitable properties but will take up the least possible time.</TD>
     </TR>
   
  
     <TR>
        
          <TD valign=top width=10%><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+3>2</FONT></STRONG></td><td>   If your interest is more general, or less specific, then you can view a wider range of properties in various ways. For instance, you could select all available locations by holding down your left mouse button and dragging down the list (or by using the shift key and clicking through the list). Then if your size requirement is relatively fixed you could select an appropriate minimum and maximum and would then be able to view properties from around the country that could cater to your needs. <p>Alternatively you could select a specific location and select no minimum and no maximum size. Or any number of variations on this theme. The trade off is that the more specific your requirement the less properties will be available to view against having more properties to inspect but taking longer to do so. </TD>

          <TD valign=top width=10%><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+3>3</FONT></STRONG></td><td>   Whatever your personal preference do not be afraid of the Reload Button on your Browser. Point 6 goes a long way to helping in this regard, but connections do get stuck so if you are staring at a blank screen for some time hit that button. <p>The property particular pages should load in 20-40 seconds. Each page contains up to five thumbnail photographs which are seldom more than 15k in size. Each of these is clickable to a larger image of roughly 40-50k</TD>
     </TR>

Try Dither for choosing colours. You can also choose whether to view images while loading or after loading. When viewing property details on this site if you select "After Loading" the text will load first, allowing you to start reading while the images load. Alternatively you might prefer an early glimpse of the property, in which case select "While loading". <p>One further option is to turn off the images altogether which you do by going to the Options menu and clicking on Auto Load Images which can be useful if you want to read through the details of a number of properties quickly</TD>

<TR>
         
         <TD valign=top width=10%><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+3>5</FONT></STRONG></td><td>   The way properties are displayed makes them very suitable for printing. If you're pressed for time, download a few, print them out and read at your convenience.</TD>
     </TR>

      <TD valign=top width=10%><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+3>6</FONT></STRONG></td><td>   In Netscape, go to the Options menu and select Network Preferences, then select Connections and enter "Number of Connections" =2 and "Network Buffer Size"=32.

     <TR>
      
        <TD valign=top width=10%><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+3>8</FONT></STRONG></td><td>   Under Options/General Preferences select Fonts and set Proportional Font to Times New Roman size 12 and Fixed Font to Courier New size 10. It's up to you but we like this setup.</TD>

<h2>Help with Search</h2>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Phrases</h3>
<ul>
To make the search look for <B>ALL</B> words selected, you must insert an <b>'and'</b> between each word, otherwise the search will produce results based on <b>ANY</b> word selected.  e.g.
<br>
</ul>
<center>

<TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=590 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFTVALIGN=TOP><b>'milton keynes'</b> will produce any stories containing milton or keynes or both</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><b>'milton and keynes'</b> will find stories that contain both words</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</center>

<BR>

<BR>

<P>

<h3>Odd Words</h3>
<ul>
If you are searching for a word followed by a single number,  such as Phase 1, or Unit 4, you will need to omit the space. There is no need to use any uppercase letters.
e.g.
</ul>
<br>
<center>
<TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=590 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD ALIGN=left><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>For <b>Phase 1</b> type <b>'phase1'</b></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>For <b>Unit 4</b> type <b>'unit4'</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
<ul>
The scoring for each story is computer-generated, and may help as a guide to how relevant each story is to your search choice.	 What is considered the most relevant is given a score of 1000. 
</ul>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
First select the location you require, or drag with your left mouse button for multiple selections. 
Then select the age category, click on Sq Ft if you prefer that to metres, and then a minimum and maximum size for the property you are looking for. Following that define your search more precisely by selecting from the additional options.<p>You might also like to take a look at our <A HREF="http://www.kingsturge.co.uk/docs/hintsks.htm">"Hints and Tips"</A> page - these will help you get the most out of this service.

<H3>NEW KING STURGE PARTNER DOUBTS DEVELOPMENTS PLAN FLEXIBILITY</H3>

<P>

<ul>
"Both main parties support the concept of increased weight being placed on Development Plan policies" says Philip Robin, the new Head of Planning and Development consultancy at King Sturge &amp Co.<P>

Much of the country is now or soon will be for the first time, subject to Adopted Local Plans. Recent appeal decisions indicate that proposals that fly in the face of Adopted Plans are usually unsuccessful.<P>

Philip Robin Says: "It is ironic that these plans have been prepared in arguably the worst property recession since 1945. I have severe doubts that they will be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the pressure for development, which is starting to occur as we enter a period of sustained economic growth."<P>

"Town planning is likely to become an increasingly important issue for occupiers, investors, property owners and developers, whichever party wins the next general election".<P>

<I>Note: Philip Robin joins King Sturge &amp Co this month as a Partner and Head of Planning and Development Consultancy. He was previously with Healey &amp Baker.</I>

<H5>ALEXANDER &amp; ALEXANDER RELOCATE TO COUNTY HOUSE, COUNTY SQUARE, CHELMSFORD</H5>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>December 1996</H3>

<P>

<ul>The international Insurance Brokers Alexander &amp; Alexander have relocated their Chelmsford 
operation to 347 m<sup>2</sup> (3,741 ft<sup>2</sup>) of new offices within County House, the landmark building
on the prestigious County Square office development close to the city centre.<p>

The 3,345 m<sup>2</sup> (36,000 ft<sup>2</sup>) fully air conditioned office building was leased in its entirety to the Crown Prosecution Service in 1994 and as part of that transaction,
a rental guarantee was granted by the developers on the two ground floor suites which were deemed as surplus. Alexander &amp; Alexander have acquired the smaller of these suites on 13.5 year sublease at a rent close to the asking terms of £188.37 per m<sup>2</sup>
 (£17.50 per ft<sup>2</sup>) with inducements equivalent to 15 months rent free. An option to determine was also granted at the 7th year.<p>
 The last suite at County House which totals 554m<sup>2</sup> (5,965 ft<sup>2</sup>) is still available to lease and the agents are confident that
 the improving market conditions together with the limited supply of quality product within the city will soon result in the letting to another quality tenant.<p>
 Richard Ellis represented Alexander &amp; Alexander, whilst Kemsley Whiteley &amp; Ferris and King Sturge &amp; acted for the developers.</ul>

<H3>KING STURGE & CO INDUSTRIAL FLOORSPACE SURVEY</H3><P>
<ul>
<STRONG>Available Floorspace In England And Wales Decreases by 9% In 12 Months</STRONG><P>

The amount of industrial floorspace on the market in England and Wales has decreased by 9% in the past 12 months, according to the latest survey by chartered surveyors King Sturge & Co.<P>

The annual reduction compares with a drop of 7% in 1994. The 1995 drop was 1.334 million m<sup>2</sup> compared with 1.171 million m<sup>2</sup> in 1994. The amount of available factory and warehouse space in England and Wales currently stands at 14.263 million m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

King Sturge carry out their survey three times a year and over the last four months of 1995, a decrease of 2% or 309,000 m<sup>2</sup> is recorded in England and Wales. All regions show less floorspace available, with the exception of Yorkshire and Humberside, where an increase of 6% was recorded and the North region, with a rise of 3%. On an annual basis, however, Yorkshire and Humberside show a drop of 7% or 99,000 m<sup>2</sup> and the North a drop of 4%.<P>


The amount of new building floorspace on the market in England and Wales decreased by 14% or 184,000 m<sup>2</sup> in 1995 compared with a fall of 18% in 1994, but the proportion to total stock remains at 8%.<P>

Available floorspace in the large buildings category fell by a significant 17% to 2.165 million m<sup>2</sup> in 1995 compared to a 12% drop in 1994. Large buildings are defined as those over 9,290 m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

King Sturge are optimistic on demand for industrial and warehouse premises. The figures for requirements recorded by 10 of their UK offices show a steady increase in their volume of quarterly demand indicator since 1991, with a rise of 25% during 1995. King Sturge report that early returns show the momentum increasing in the early part of 1996.<P>

The King Sturge & Co Industrial Floorspace survey is conducted three times a year in April, August and December. The survey covers industrial and warehouse buildings on the market in England and Wales over 465 m<sup>2</sup> in area and excludes properties being marketed at or near site value, recognising that the property no longer has an economic life. Derelict property and that unsuitable for refurbishment is also excluded.<P>

<H3>THE PROPERTY ECONOMY</H3><P>
<ul>
Steady growth coupled with low inflation and low interest rates are setting the foundation for a sustained recovery of the property market, says Chartered Surveyors King Sturge & Co in its report 'The Property Economy'.<P>

<STRONG>Investment Markets</STRONG><P>

King Sturge sees a window of opportunity for property investors. As tenant incentives reduce, certain properties will see rental growth and with interest rates moving lower, yields could also harden. <P>

Investment markets are reported to have been subdued over the past six months. The general shortage of prime stock has been reinforced by the reluctance of property owners to sell below valuation and therefore to crystallise a loss and risk under-performing competitors. This constraint may now ease, following new end of year valuations.<P>

Investment demand for good quality offices within major regional centres and west of London has remained strong reflecting a hardening in occupier market. However, the shortage of prime stock continues to be acute, so that prime transactions remains scarce and a number of funds continue to have unsatisfied requirements.<P>

The growth of High Street rents has been constrained by  weak retail sales and by continuing strong demand from retailers for out-of-town locations. Large retail units in prime High Street positions, however, continue to show growth and best positions in Bath, Chester and Norwich may attract a sub 5% yield. The strongest rental growth is shown in retail warehouses, driven by demand from established out-of-town users and more traditional High Street stores such as Boots, Mothercare and Next.<P>

Well-located, good quality industrial investments are in short supply. Certain high yielding industrial estates have been attractive to investors, because their initial high income return reduces the risks of under-performance.<P>

<STRONG>Occupier Markets</STRONG><P>

King Sturge & Co's Industrial Floorspace Survey has proved to be a good proxy for the state of the industrial market overall. The past two years have seen the volume of industrial floorspace falling steadily as a recovery in the general economy has fed through to the market. Total floorspace available in England and Wales now stands at just over 14.5 million m<sup>2</sup>, a decrease of about 3 million m<sup>2</sup> compared with the peak of supply reached in 1993. <P>

A measure of the hardening market in the popular Heathrow area is the price of around £3.2m per hectare reported on the 6 hectare former oil depot site on Bedfont Road, Stanwell. Signs of renewed interest in speculative development could be the Gazeley's construction of a 32,500 m<sup>2</sup> regional distribution centre at Hemel Hempstead.<P>

The supply of large buildings on the market in the West End of London has been eroded by a number of recent transactions, such as Grand Metropolitan Plc leasing Henrietta House (8,961 m<sup>2</sup>) and Columbia  TriStar leasing Dormeuil House, Soho (6,224 m<sup>2</sup>).<P>

This has led certain users with large requirements to pre-lease developments or develop for their own occupation. Office availability in the City is falling and large new buildings of over 10,000 m<sup>2</sup> are in short supply. The medium term supply line does, however, have a large amount of potential.<P>

The main demand for High Street units continues to come from large multiple stores. However, major landlords need to work with local councils to upgrade the High Street to ensure the future investment performance of their town centre property. This is already occurring in a number of locations in a bid to maintain value against the competition from out-of-town centre developments.<P>

Out-of-town locations continue to see a rising share of overall retail sales. As the planning regime for out-of-town developments becomes tighter, retailers seeking representation out-of-town may become less selective about location and units.<P>

<H3>NEWS FROM PRAGUE</H3><P>
<ul>
King & Co Praha, the Czech Republic arm of King Sturge & Co report that office take up in Prague for 1995 will be approximately 95,000 m<sup>2</sup> for occupational purposes plus a further 30,000 m<sup>2</sup> being developed on a pre-lease or pre-sale basis.<P>

Best rents achieved in 1995 have been DM62 per m<sup>2</sup> per month (approximately £31 per ft<sup>2</sup> per annum). The warehouse market is at last showing some signs of activity with four new schemes in the planning stage and more likely to follow.<P>

Retail letting activity has been quiet but development projects are now reaching completion, with retailers such as Marks & Spencers, C&A and Tower Records all showing interest  in the local market.<P>

King & Co Praha finished the year with the lettings of a 100 m<sup>2</sup> office to Bausch & Lomb at Jachymova 2, Prague 1,  at a rental of about DM 50/m<sup>2</sup>/mth; a letting to Dewey Ballantine <br>of 300 m<sup>2</sup> offices  at  Mala Stupartska 9, Prague 1, at a rental of DM 45/m<sup>2</sup>/mth; the letting of a restaurant to Shamiana Indian Restaurant of  300 m<sup>2</sup> on Pariska 20, Prague 1, at an average rent of  DM 30/m<sup>2</sup>/mth and a letting of 275 m<sup>2</sup> at Stepanska 16, Prague 1 to a Slovak Pension Fund.<P>

Seydlerova, Prague 5 is proving popular with electronics companies. US computer publishing company IDG have taken 1,300 m<sup>2</sup> at a rent of DM 25/m<sup>2</sup>/month and Pike Electronics have rented 360 m<sup>2</sup> at the same address.<P>

King & Co's Paul Betts in Prague predicts that the 1996 market should prove at least as good as 1995 if not even better.<P>

<H3>CDM REGULATIONS - HAVE THE IMPLICATIONS REGISTERED?</H3><P>
<ul>
<STRONG>The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations came fully into force on 1st January 1996.</STRONG><P>

These Regulations affect almost all construction work and have been introduced to
help reduce the number of serious and fatal accidents as well as the numerous cases of ill-health which affect the construction industry each year.<P>

The CDM Regulations require certain action by those instigating construction work including the appointment of a Planning Supervisor.<P>

Mike Johnson, Head of CDM practice at Chartered Surveyors, King Sturge & Co, is concerned that the full implications of the full CDM regulations have not registered.<P>

"These regulations need to be treated very seriously", says Johnson. "The first prosecutions have already been brought and it is vital that those instigating construction work are fully aware of the implications as failure to comply is a criminal offence."<P>

King Sturge & Co have issued a leaflet to all their clients entitled, "The CDM Regulations - What Clients Need To Do."  A copy of this leaflet is available for King Sturge & Co, 7 Stratford Place, London W1N 9AE.<P>

<H3>CONNECT WEST, HEATHROW</H3><P>
<ul>
Maclan Developments and Norwich Union have let their 7,432 m<sup>2</sup> (80,000 ft<sup>2</sup>) high bay distribution warehouse facility at Connect West on Springfield Rd, in Hayes, Heathrow to Future Electronics Ltd.<P>

Future have taken the property on a 25 year lease, with five yearly rent reviews, incorporating a tenant's option to terminate at the 15th year at an initial rent of £560,000 per annum (£7.00 per ft<sup>2</sup>). <P>

Future Electronics are currently based in a 1,115 m<sup>2</sup> (12,000 ft<sup>2</sup>) unit in Poyle, which is primarily office accommodation and are relocating their main distribution operation from continental Europe.<P>

The building is a high bay warehouse designed specifically for the specialist distribution market, which is reflected in features such as clear height internally of 10m with facilities for 10 loading bays, including dock-level and drive in loading facilities. There is a substantial external yard 50m deep extending to 0.6 hectares (1.25 acres).<P>

John Macpherson at Maclan Developments says: "We are particularly pleased with the growing confidence in the distribution warehouse market resulting in this letting".<P>

King Sturge & Co and Connell Wilson acted for Maclan/Norwich Union. Fuller Peiser acted for Future Electronics.<P>

<H3>KING STURGE APPOINTED BY NHS TRUSTS</H3><P>
<ul>
King Sturge & Co have won the rating work for two thirds of the NHS Trusts in the West Country.<P>

The firm will be examining the rating assessments on 430 properties in the South West and South Wales, with a total rateable value of some  £40 million.<P>

King Sturge & Co Partner Tim Stapleton, based in the Bristol office says:<I> "We have already identified a number of situations where reductions should be due on the 1995 Rating Evaluation. A rateable value on a large hospital could be £3 million leading to a rate's bill of £1,300,000  per annum and we will be appealing on behalf of the Trusts to reduce this liability where appropriate."</I><P>

The activities of the new company are likely to encompass not only realising added value from surplus property, but also working with ICI businesses to establish a best practice approach to meet their changing operational requirements. <P>Commenting on the move, Barton said: "The potential lying within ICI's landholdings is immense. The property company will focus on those opportunities capable of producing real returns which will be reflected in ICI's bottom line in both the short and long term.  Parallels can perhaps be drawn with the successful activities of other in-house property  companies, such as Lynton Plc on behalf of BAA."<P>King Sturge & Co Senior Partner Malcolm King says: "Our objective has always been to attract talented people to this firm, who develop an affinity with clients. Perhaps we have achieved this too effectively in Robin's case! He has been a great asset to King Sturge & Co and while we regret his departure, recognise that his talents will be beneficially employed by one of our close clients.

A reduction of 2% or 218,000 m<sup>2</sup> of floorspace in the  past four months produces a total of 14, 045 million m<sup>2</sup> available, a drop of 2.879 million m<sup>2</sup> from the September 1993 peak. This represents a drop of 17% in under three years. <P>King Sturge & Co report that the decrease in the past four months would have been even greater, were it not for some increases recorded in the Northern regions, where the North West increased by 6% and Yorkshire and Humberside by 7%.<P>The Southern regions continue their downward trend with falls of 5% in the South East and 4% in the South West. Wales, however, shows the highest percentage fall at 6%. The Midlands regions both show reductions, with East Midlands down a sizeable 5% and the West a more modest 2%. East Anglia, with a comparatively small percentage of industrial floorspace, is static and the North is up a marginal 1%.<P>King Sturge & Co express some guarded concern on the reduction of available space in new buildings, where England and Wales show a drop of 6%. Despite this lack of availability, some schemes refuse to be taken up, particularly buildings between 2,400 m<sup>2 </sup>and  4,000 m<sup>2</sup>, which are limited in their ability to offer alternative sizes.<P>Large buildings, namely those over 9,290 m<sup>2</sup> (100,000 ft<sup>2</sup>) record an increase of 13% to 2.445 million m<sup>2</sup> rising 2 percentage points and now representing 17% of the overall total.<P><STRONG>SOUTH EAST</STRONG><P>The South East region records a decrease of 5% with the Rest of the South East (ROSE) showing a 5% reduction and Greater London a 4% drop. In floorspace terms the figures of 4.643 million m<sup>2</sup> represents a decrease of 224,000 m<sup>2</sup>.<P>King Sturge & Co advise that there is increased activity in the manufacturing sector of the market, as well as in distribution. This is demonstrated in Milton Keynes, where the Midas Distribution Centre of 8,390 m<sup>2</sup> was acquired by Capital Metalworks for the production of refrigeration equipment. In the same modern estate of Tilbrook, in the south of the new town, a factory of  4,645 m<sup>2</sup> has been taken by Massmould, producers of plastic mouldings. <P>New buildings in the South East continue to decrease by 8%, with a reduction of 29,000 m<sup>2 </sup>producing a total of 316,000 m<sup>2</sup>,  remaining at 7% of the region's total. Greater London accounts for most of the fall, down by 22,000 m<sup>2</sup>, now at just  3% of the available stock. While there is a nominal reduction in Rest of the South East of  7,000 m<sup>2</sup>,  it remains at 9% of the respective stock.<P><STRONG>SOUTH WEST</STRONG><P>A decrease of 4% continues the trend of the steady downward movement in the region, observed in recent surveys. A reduction of 39,000 m<sup>2</sup> produces a total of 970,000 m<sup>2</sup>. Large buildings effectively account for the fall with nominal changes in other categories.<P><STRONG>EAST ANGLIA</STRONG><P>In East Anglia following a decrease in availability observed four months ago, the region is all but static, with a marginal increase of 2,000 m<sup>2</sup>.<P>In floorspace terms, the new total now stands at 529,000 m<sup>2</sup>. The rise in the previously-used, under 9,290 m<sup>2 </sup>category is countered by decreases in both new and large buildings categories.<P><STRONG>WALES</STRONG><P>Wales tops the league in terms of overall percentage reductions with a fall of 6%. A decrease of 61,000 m<sup>2</sup> in available floorspace produces a total of  909,000 m<sup>2</sup>. The previously-used, under 9,290 m<sup>2</sup> (100,000 ft<sup>2</sup>) category is the principal source of the reduction, with the decrease in new buildings countered by the rise in large buildings.<P><STRONG>EAST MIDLANDS</STRONG><P>In the East Midlands, the rate of decrease accelerates with the 5% fall or 65,000 m<sup>2</sup> to 1.178 million m<sup>2</sup>. This reduction is due to falls in the previously-used, under 9,290 m<sup>2</sup> (100,000 ft<sup>2</sup>) category and the new buildings available.  A nominal rise is evident in the large buildings category. Much of this overall decrease has been observed in the southern counties of the region.<P><STRONG>WEST MIDLANDS </STRONG><P>Available industrial property in the West Midlands region decreases by 2% compared with 1% fall in the last survey four months ago. Down by 33,000 m<sup>2</sup>, it produces a total of 1.87 million m<sup>2</sup> with increases in both the new and large buildings categories. All the decrease comes from the previously-used, under 9,290 m<sup>2</sup> (100,000 ft<sup>2</sup>) category. Available new floorspace increases by 26,000 m<sup>2</sup> to 141,000 m<sup>2</sup>, now at 8% of the regional total.<P><STRONG>NORTH WEST</STRONG><P>In the North West, the volatility of the region continues, going against the national trend, with an increase in floorspace availability of 6% or 93,000 m<sup>2 </sup>rise producing 1.744 million m<sup>2</sup>, similar to figures reported last summer.<P>However, new buildings decrease by 19% or 26,000 m<sup>2</sup> to 112,000 m<sup>2</sup> falling 2% to 6% of the available stock.<P>Floorspace available in large buildings rises by a considerable 18% or 82,000 m<sup>2</sup> to 526,000 m<sup>2</sup>, now over 30% of the overall stock.<P><STRONG>YORKSHIRE AND HUMBERSIDE</STRONG><P>In Yorkshire and Humberside, an increase of 7% also bucks the national trend, being 98,000 m<sup>2</sup> up to 1.461 million m<sup>2</sup>. The increase is evident in all categories, but primarily in the previously-used, under 9,290 m<sup>2</sup> and the large buildings categories.<P>New buildings on the market increase by  11% or 8,000 m<sup>2</sup> to 84,000 m<sup>2</sup> remaining at 6% of the increased overall total.<P><STRONG>NORTH REGION</STRONG><P>The North region records a modest increase, with a rise of 1% or 10,000 m<sup>2</sup> to 741,000 m<sup>2</sup>. The rise  is entirely due to large buildings with the remainder of the floorspace available showing a  modest decrease.<P>Available floorspace in new buildings decreases by 9% or 3,000 m<sup>2</sup> to 43,000 m<sup>2</sup> remaining at 6% of the overall total.<P><STRONG>DEMAND</STRONG><P>Demand recorded through enquiries for floorspace by King Sturge & Co's thirteen UK offices continues to improve with over 6 million m<sup>2</sup> of requirements recorded in the system so far in 1996. This compares with below 5 million m<sup>2</sup> during the same period last year.<P>Requirements over 10,000 m<sup>2</sup> accounted for some 11% of the total. The South East continues to increase its share of requirements from 31% in December 1995 to nearly 42% so far this year. The increase has been of the expense principally of the Midlands and Yorkshire & Humberside.<P><STRONG>THE SURVEY</STRONG><P>The King Sturge & Co Industrial Floorspace survey is conducted three times a year in April, August and December. The survey covers industrial and warehouse buildings on the market in England and Wales over 465 m<sup>2</sup> in area and excludes properties being marketed at or near site value, recognising that the property no longer has an economic life. Derelict property and that unsuitable for refurbishment is also excluded.<P></ul><p><br><br>For further information contact <p><b>Bob Thompson, King Sturge & Co. </b>Tel: 0171-493 4933. e-mail <a href="mailto:sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk">sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk</a><br> or<br>	<b>Michael Bellegarde, MBA,</b> Tel: 0171-495 4411. e-mail <a href="mailto:sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk">sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk</a>					</BLOCKQUOTE><P><br><br><HR SIZE=1><A HREF="http://www.estatestoday.co.uk"><IMG align=right border=0 SRC="/images/header2.gif"></A><a href="mailto:sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk">sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk</a><br><a href="http://www.kingsturge.co.uk/docs/kscopy.htm">Copyright © 1996 King Sturge & Co.</a><HR SIZE=1></BODY></HTML>

Negotiations began in early 1995, following the identification of the compatibility and potential  synergy of the two firms.<P>Malcolm King, Senior Partner commented: "It is no secret that, following the merger between King & Co and JP Sturge in 1992, we have been seeking the right opportunity for a City presence, which was obviously the next logical step in the development and growth of King Sturge & Co. We are very pleased to have reached a consensus with the partners of Bates Richards, who provide exactly the right chemistry and image for this objective".<P>"In addition to access and exposure to one of the most important occupational markets in the world, our presence in the Square Mile will consolidate the strong links we have with funds and institutions, as well as providing great scope for extending our range of skills and services nationally and internationally."<P>Oliver Bates, who founded Bates Richards with Peter Richards in 1980 added: "Over the last 16 years, we have established a successful general practice with a strong agency presence in the City of London and a loyal client base. The merger will immediately establish King Sturge & Co as a force in the City  which, amongst other things, will lead to a substantial expansion of the investment and agency business. We look ahead with great confidence".<P></ul><p><br><br>For further information contact <p><b>Malcolm King, King Sturge & Co. </b>Tel: 0171-493 4933. e-mail <a href="mailto:sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk">sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk</a><br> or<br>	<b>Michael Bellegarde, MBA,</b> Tel: 0171-495 4411. e-mail <a href="mailto:sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk">sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk</a>					</BLOCKQUOTE><P><br><br><HR SIZE=1><A HREF="http://www.estatestoday.co.uk"><IMG align=right border=0 SRC="/images/header2.gif"></A><a href="mailto:sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk">sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk</a><br><a href="http://www.kingsturge.co.uk/docs/kscopy.htm">Copyright © 1996 King Sturge & Co.</a><HR SIZE=1></BODY></HTML>

<H3>HOMEBASE AND WHITBREAD CHOOSE LYDIARD FIELDS</H3>

<P>

<ul>
  Homebase have signed up to take a pre-let for their new Southern 
Distribution Centre at Lydiard Fields, Swindon, a development by The 
Equitable Life Assurance Society and project managed by ICP Properties 
Limited.  The site is located on Junction 16 of the M4 Motorway to the 
west of Swindon. <p>

Construction of the 26,200 m<sup>2</sup> (282,000 ft<sup>2</sup>) building on a site of 6.67 ha 
(16.5 acres), to include 1,068 m<sup>2</sup> (11,500 ft<sup2</sup>) offices with 4,273 m<sup>2</sup> 
(46,000 ft<sup>2</sup>) store  and is scheduled to start this month (November 1996) 
for completion in June 1997.  The development will provide 12 m. eaves, 
19 taildock loading bays, vehicle wash and fuel facilities together with 
a separate car park for 250 cars. Sir Robert McAlpine has been appointed 
as contractor.<p>

Homebase have taken a 20 year lease, with five yearly, upward only rent 
reviews at an initial rental of over £1.5 m. per annum.	Healey & Baker acted for Homebase. <p>

Elsewhere on Lydiard Fields, Whitbread have just completed the purchase 
of 0.93 ha (2.3 acres), at the entrance of Lydiard Fields opposite the 
Hilton Hotel, for a new Beefeater and Travel Inn, their 300th such 
facility. Work has started on site with completion due mid-1997.  The 
development will provide a 63 bed Travel Inn and a 152 seat restaurant.	<p>

King Sturge & Co, Walker Son & Packman and Loveday & Loveday Commercial 
advised The Equitable Life Assurance Society in both transactions, and 
are retained in the remainder of the site. <p>

Approximately 20 acres remains available at Lydiard Fields on a design 
and build basis with the benefit of outline planning permission for  
B1/B8 accommodation.  <p>

Earlier this year, Equitable Life began construction of two new 
speculative distribution units totalling 9,149 m<sup>2</sup> (98,482 ft<sup>2</sup>) which are 
due for completion next month.  These units will provide high 
specification accommodation with many important features, including 40 m 
deep yards, 10 m eaves, quality offices and separate car parking.  The 
agents are quoting £6.25 ft<sup>2</sup>.  <p>

Colin Winter, Chief Surveyor of The Equitable Life Assurance Society, 
said the Homebase and Whitbread deals underlined the quality of the 
Lydiard Field location.  There is, he said, strong interest in the two 
speculative units that we are building, and I am very encouraged by the 
number of enquiries showing interest in the remaining plots.  <p>

Roy Callow, a director of ICP Properties, that that Homebase had chosen 
Lydiard Fields in  spite of strong competition from other sites in the 
region, but none of them could offer the direct motorway access which is 
the distinguishing feature of Lydiard Fields nor could they meet the 
extremely tight construction schedule that Homebase require.  <p>

Increasingly new development is being pushed towards brown land driven by concern at the rate of use of greenfield sites and local and central government sustainability policies.  Brown land, often as not, will be contaminated by past uses and may contain derelict buildings and structures.  There may be uncertainties of ownership and the surrounding environment may be unattractive.  Development of such sites is far from simple.  The draft regulations and guidance under the Environment Act 1995 are likely to come in to force early in 1997, with major new obligations on occupiers and owners.  The seminar will cover:<P><UL><LI>Government policy<LI>Developing brown land<LI>Transactions and secured lending<LI>Valuation issues<LI>Grants and regional development</UL><P>The speakers have first hand experience of acting on sites and buildings which will be subject to the onerous and detailed regulations which create new responsibilities, including levels of remediation and criteria for the transfer of liabilities between parties.

<H3>NORTHAMPTON SHOPPING BACK IN TOWN</H3><P>
<ul>
Construction has started on the new 9,874 m<sup>2</sup> (105,000 ft<sup>2</sup>) St Peter's Way retail and leisure development in Northampton.<P>

Located within the Northampton Inner Ring Road, this major 'Edge of Town' development with 541 surface car parking spaces provides the benefits of out of town shopping, with town centre facilities. <P>

Retailers Aldi and Iceland have already signed up for space as has McManus Taverns who will run the on-site public house, their 15th in Northampton.<P>

The agents for the project King Sturge & Co acting jointly with Hadland of Northampton hope to shortly announce a night club operator. <P>

Several of the smaller mall units have already been reserved by local operators and firm interest is being shown in the larger units by national multiples.<P>



John Laker of Wimpey Property, developers of the £12m project says: "Our St Peter's Way development provides large retail space with extensive surface car parking demanded by today's shopper. The development is under three minutes walk from the market square, the traditional centre of Northampton and also benefits from 12 bus routes passing the site."<P>

Construction has commenced on site, with a completion date of October 1996 for retailers to be trading well before Christmas.<P>

<H3>KING STURGE & CO INDUSTRIAL FLOORSPACE SURVEY - SOUTH EAST</H3><P>
<ul>
The amount of industrial floorspace in the market in South East England dropped by a significant 11% in 1995, accelerating from the 3% recorded in 1994 according to the latest survey by chartered surveyors King Sturge & Co.<P>

While both sub-regions contributed to this reduction of 630,000 m<sup>2</sup>, it was Greater London that provided the larger decrease at 13% compared with 10% in Rest of the South East. In floorspace terms, the former now stands at 1.778 million m<sup>2</sup> and the latter at 3.09 million m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

Available floorspace in new buildings floorspace decreases by 22% or 98,000 m<sup>2</sup> to 7% of the region's total. A major transaction during the year was the Korean-giant Daewoo taking 12,355 m<sup>2</sup> of the speculatively built scheme at the Downlands Estate in Worthing. They are also having a further 5,000 m<sup>2</sup> constructed.<P>

The contribution of large building decreases by 13% or 92,000 m<sup>2</sup> remaining at 12% of the overall reduced total. ROSE  accounts for most of the stock.<P>

King Sturge & Co who carry out their survey three times a year, report that for the last four months of 1995, the decrease was some 5% in the South East region. They highlight the investment by K'Nex International in Ashford, taking the former BOC distribution centre of 10,683 m<sup>2</sup> as an encouraging sign for the Kentish growth town. They also point to the added benefit of the new International station offering Eurostar services to the mainland.<P>

Apart from the Daewoo transactions, other new buildings activity includes the Peterwood Park development at Croydon of 7,218 m<sup>2</sup> offering various sizes. The largest unit of 2,323 m<sup>2</sup> has been taken by Vodafone - part of the active telecommunications sector. In Guildford, Surrey the Opus Park scheme has seen British American Tobacco more than trebling their existing presence by taking a further 5,088 m<sup>2</sup>. The Elstree Distribution Park, just off the A1, offers four units totalling 11,648 m<sup>2</sup> with three industrial/warehouse units and a larger distribution centre with higher eaves height. <P>


<STRONG>Available Floorspace In England And Wales Decreases by 9% In 12 Months</STRONG><P>

The amount of industrial floorspace on the market in England and Wales as a whole has decreased by 9% in the past 12 months, according to the King Sturge & Co survey.<P>

The annual reduction compares with a drop of 7% in 1994. The 1995 drop was 1.334 million m<sup>2</sup> compared with 1.171 million m<sup>2</sup> in 1994. The amount of available factory and warehouse space in England and Wales currently stands at 14.263 million m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

Over the last four months of 1995, a decrease of 2% or 309,000 m<sup>2</sup> is recorded in England and Wales. All regions show less floorspace available, with the exception of Yorkshire and Humberside, where an increase of 6% was recorded and the North region, with a rise of 3%.  On an annual basis, however, Yorks. and Humberside show a drop of 7% or 99,000 m<sup>2</sup> and the North a drop of 4%.<P>

The amount of new building floorspace on the market in England and Wales decreased by 14% or 184,000 m<sup>2</sup> in 1995 compared with a fall of 18% in 1994, but the proportion to total stock remains at 8%.<P>

Available floorspace in the large buildings category fell by a significant 17% to 2.165 million m<sup>2</sup> in 1995 compared to a 12% drop in 1994. Large buildings are defined as those over 9,290 m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

King Sturge are optimistic on demand for industrial and warehouse premises. The figures for requirements recorded by 10 of their UK offices show a steady increase in their volume of quarterly demand indicator since 1991, with a rise of 25% during 1995. King Sturge report that early returns show the momentum increasing in the early part of 1996.<P>

The King Sturge & Co Industrial Floorspace survey is conducted three times a year in April, August and December. The survey covers industrial and warehouse buildings on the market in England and Wales over 465 m<sup>2</sup> in area and excludes properties being marketed at or near site value, recognising that the property no longer has an economic life. Derelict property and that unsuitable for refurbishment is also excluded.<P>

<H3>FIAT EXPANDS IN LONDON</H3>

<P>

<ul>The former Abbess warehouse site in the Uxbridge Road, Hayes, has been purchased for development of a motor dealership, as part of Fiat's expansion plans within Greater London.<p>
The site, which comprises 0.52 acres (1.3 acres) lies close to the junction of the Hayes Bypass which links the A40 and the M4, and will be developed to provide a modern dealership facility.<p>
King Sturge &amp; Co has advised on the acquisition, planning and project management of the site, and construction has now started.<p>
Jim Rowland, Building Consultancy Partner at King Sturge &amp; Co commented: "This acquisition will complement Fiat's existing representations and provide a major sales and servicing point in West London." The site lies alongside Gazeley's retail re-development of the former EMI factory at Hayes Bridge, upon which King Sturge &amp; Co is also advising.<p>
Last year, Fiat announced an exclusive agreement with Pendragon Plc, the motor dealer, to sell the Fiat marque throughout the Greater London area. Pendragon is also being advised by King Sturge &amp; Co and Mike Spencer of the motor trade team said: "We have successfully completed acquisitions in Bromley, Welling, Watford and Stratford with further negotiations in progress."</ul>

Wales is down by 4%. East Midlands is down by 3% and West Midlands by 4%. East Anglia drops by 5%. The North is also down by an above average 5%.<P>The North West increases by just 1%, while Yorkshire and Humberside is down by 1%. Available floorspace on the market, in completed new buildings in England and Wales remains static at 1.039 million sq m, representing 8% of the total figure. The overall total disguises an increase in available new property in the South East against decreases in the North West, East Midlands and East Anglia.<P>The reduction of 9% (220,000 sq m) in the large building (over 10,000 sq m) category to 2.225 million sq m represents over half the overall decrease. Large buildings now account for 16% of the overall total.<P></UL><BR><H4>Metric Adjustment</H4><UL>As the final stage in the conversion from imperial to metric measurement, the current survey shows more appropriate floorspace size bands. The base figure for inclusion is now 500 sq m (previously 5,000 sq ft or 465 sq m) and the definition for large buildings is 10,000 sq m (previously 100,000 sq ft or 9,290 sq m). For this transitional edition of the survey, there is a slight distortion in the recorded reductions overall and in the large buildings category.<P></UL><BR><H4>Market Aspects</H4><UL>King Sturge & Co with 13 regional offices in England and Wales reports evidence of properties that have been on the market for some time now finding occupiers. In Sunbury-on-Thames American computer chip manufacturer Kingston Technology Corporation have leased a 3,786 sq m high office content office/industrial warehouse building. The deal was struck in the face of interest from a major Japanese company, keen to take the long vacant building.<P>The development sector is also finding a role, in some cases where property has been hard to sell. In Croydon, the 6,783 sq m former BT depot was acquired at auction by a developer and subsequently sold to Direct Line Insurance who found the large secure yard particularly suitable for an accident repair centre. In St Albans, Herts, the twenty five year old former Polaroid building is being upgraded by a property company to provide 4,850 sq m of improved floorspace.<P></UL><BR><H4>SOUTH EAST</H4><UL>The South East region records a fall of 4% in the amount of industrial and warehouse property available on the market, representing a decrease of 168,000 sq m to a total of 4,475 sq m. Two thirds of these properties are in the Home Counties, known as the Rest of the South East (ROSE) sub-region. Greater London, comprising the London boroughs shows the greater percentage reduction at 8%, being a fall of 138,000 sq m to 1.565 million sq m.<P>New buildings reverse their downward movement by rising 16% or 49,000 sq m to 365,000 sq m, up one point to 8% of the regions total.<P>King Sturge & Co reiterate the 1990s need to attract industry to Greater London as well as other parts of the country and report that a self contained building of 3,577 sq m located a short distance from the A40 Western Avenue in Park Royal is nearing completion, being sited in one of the three locations in the capitol having DTI Immediate Assisted Area Status. At the southern end of the M1 motorway, a number of particularly large speculative distribution centres are available. The Apex, a 15,584 sq m development has been carried out at Milton Keynes, while at Hemel Hempstead, Herts, a short distance from Junction 8, an even larger unit of 21,924 sq m forms part of the Hemel Distribution Centre. The nearby Chevron scheme adding a further 5,354 sq m of new space contributes to Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshires total of almost 50% of the new space available in the ROSE region.<P>The large buildings category shows a nominal increase of just 1%, adding a net 7,000 sq m to produce a total of 678,000 sq m representing 16% of the regions overall reduced figure.<P><BR></UL><CENTER><H4>OTHER REGIONS</H4></CENTER>	<BR><H4>SOUTH WEST</H4><UL>A decrease of 5% continues a steady downward movement in this region, observed in recent surveys. A reduction of 49,000 sq m produces a total of 921,000 sq m. The new buildings total is static at 95,000 sq m, being 10% of the overall total and large buildings show a nominal 1% decrease of 2,000 sq m net to 123,000 sq m, following the substantial decrease of the last survey.<P></UL><BR><H4>EAST ANGLIA</H4><UL>East Anglia joins the ranks of the regions with more significant decreases by falling 5% or 24,000 sq m to 505,000 sq m.<P>The previously-used, under 10,000 sq m category accounts for the majority of the decrease. New floorspace falls by 10,000 sq m to 30,000 sq m equating to 6% of the regions overall total. Large buildings increase by 8% from 62,000 sq m to 67,000 sq m accounting for 13% of the regions total.<P></UL><BR><H4>WALES</H4><UL>The principality has scored a major coup in attracting the South Korean Lucky Goldstar electronics giant to the impressive Celtic Lakes scheme on the western side of Newport. The purpose built complex will provide two plants, totalling 306,570 sq m with the first facility due on stream next summer and the second by 1999.<P>Unaffected by this major development, the overall floorspace falls by 4% or 41,000 sq m to 868,000 sq m.<P>New buildings available decrease by 5% to 7,000 sq m to 145,000 sq m continuing at 17% of the overall stock. Large buildings decrease by 18% or 24,000 sq m to 110,000 sq m, dropping 2% to 13% of the overall total.<P></UL><BR><H4>EAST MIDLANDS</H4><UL>Available floorspace in the region decreases by 3% or 36,000 sq m to 1.142 million sq m. This reduction is due to decreases in the previously-used 10,000 sq m category and new buildings.<P>New buildings decrease by 18,000 sq m to 38,000 sq m and now stands at a very low 3% of the regions available stock. Floorspace in large buildings continues to record an increase. On this occasion, 34% or 29,000 sq m to 115,000 sq m. A manufacturing plant of 23,411 sq m at Lincoln coming on the market dramatically affects the figures.<P></UL><BR><H4>WEST MIDLANDS</H4><UL>A decrease of 4% or 66,000 sq m produces a total of 1.804 million sq m contributed solely by the large building category.<P>Large buildings in the region show a substantial fall of 40% or 116,000 sq m to 171,000 sq m representing just 9% of the overall stock.<P>King Sturge report that in a number of instances, large properties are being demolished for re-development rather than re-occupation. New floorspace increases by 1% or 10,000 sq m to 142,000 sq m remaining at 8% of the regions total.<P></UL><BR><H4>NORTH WEST</H4><UL>This region continues to produce a rollercoaster line graph with a sharp cutback in the rate of increase observed in the last survey. A 1% or 15,000 sq m increase produces 1.759 million sq m. New buildings decrease by 13% or 14,000 sq m to 98,000 sq m, remaining at 6% of the stock. Large buildings more than reverse the rise recorded four months ago, by decreasing 22% or 115,000 sq m to 411,000 sq m.<P>On Merseyside, the 51,000 sq m John Dickinson Stationary complex in Knowsley has been sold to a private developer, who has let over three-quarters of the floorspace to a distribution company. The Bryant & May factory of 27,870 sq m on 14.6 hectares in Speke has been bought by English Partnerships for possible refurbishment or re-developed for housing.<P></UL><BR><H4>YORKSHIRE AND HUMBERSIDE</H4><UL>The region records a small reduction of 1% or 19,000 sq m in available floorspace producing a total of 1.442 million sq m. The decrease is primarily in the previously-used under 10,000 sq m category.<P>New buildings decrease by a modest 2% or 2,000 sq m to 82,000 sq m remaining at 6% of the overall total. Large buildings increase by 3% or 10,000 sq m to 293,000 sq m equating to 20% of the overall total.<P></UL><BR><H4>NORTH REGION</H4><UL>An above average 5% decrease recorded in this region, representing a reduction of 36,000 sq m to a new total of 705,000 sq m. New floorspace increases by a modest 2% or 1,000 sq m to 44,000 sq m remaining at 6% of the overall total.<P>Large buildings return to the downward movement, showing a reduction of 5% or 14,000 sq m to 257,000 sq m representing 36% of the overall total.<P></UL><BR><H4>DEMAND</H4><UL>The King Sturge & Co Volume of Outstanding Demand indicator takes into account the aggregate volume of serious enquiries received by the various offices of King Sturge & Co and the rate at which these needs are satisfied.<P>In terms of floorspace volume of enquiries, demand for premises remains above 6 million sq m continuing the trend observed earlier in the year.<P>King Sturge & Co report that the demand level is similar to that recorded twelve months ago, improving on the 1995 level and 50% more than recorded three years ago.<P></UL><BR><H4>THE SURVEY</H4><UL>The King Sturge & Co Industrial Floorspace survey is conducted three times a year in April, August and December. The survey covers industrial and warehouse buildings on the market in England and Wales over 500 sq m in area and excludes properties being marketed at or near site value, recognising that the property no longer has an economic life. Derelict property and that unsuitable for refurbishment is also excluded.<P></ul><p><br><br>For further information contact <p><b>Bob Thompson, King Sturge & Co. </b>Tel: 0171-493 4933. e-mail <a href="mailto:sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk">sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk</a><br> or<br>	<b>Michael Bellegarde, MBA,</b> Tel: 0171-495 4411. e-mail <a href="mailto:sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk">sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk</a>					</BLOCKQUOTE><P><br><br><HR SIZE=1><A HREF="http://www.estatestoday.co.uk"><IMG align=right border=0 SRC="/images/header2.gif"></A><a href="mailto:sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk">sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk</a><br><a href="http://www.kingsturge.co.uk/docs/kscopy.htm">Copyright © 1996 King Sturge & Co.</a><HR SIZE=1></BODY></HTML>

Strong demand during the early part of this year from occupiers and developers resulted in an informal tender of the 1.32 acre site followed by a quick unconditional sale to local company Lineside Engineering at a figure believed to be in the region of £500,000.<p>The spokesman for BT Group Property Mike Parker said "Having resisted a forced sale situation after the reserve price was not reached at auction at the end of last year the belief of ourselves and King Sturge & Co was that the market was about to improve and this has been fully justified with this excellent result." It is understood that Lineside will initially use the existing building on site for B1, B2 B8 purposes in a refurbished format rather than looking at new development.<p>BT Group Property and King Sturge & Co advised the vendors in the disposal.</ul><p><br><br>For further information contact <p><b>Huw Davies, King Sturge & Co. </b>Tel: 0171-493 4933. e-mail <a href="mailto:sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk">sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk</a><br> or<br>	<b>Michael Bellegarde, MBA,</b> Tel: 0171-495 4411. e-mail <a href="mailto:sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk">sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk</a>					</BLOCKQUOTE><P><br><br><HR SIZE=1><A HREF="http://www.estatestoday.co.uk"><IMG align=right border=0 SRC="/images/header2.gif"></A><a href="mailto:sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk">sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk</a><br><a href="http://www.kingsturge.co.uk/docs/kscopy.htm">Copyright © 1996 King Sturge & Co.</a><HR SIZE=1></BODY></HTML>

<H5>March 1996:</H5><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>Bath</H2>
<ul>
For a city with a population of less than 100,000, Bath supports a shopping centre with an international reputation and image which completely overshadows those of its far bigger regional neighbours. As a consequence, when times are good in the retail sector it is a much sought-after location - the opening of a shop in Bath is regarded as vital to retailers with national aspirations. <P>

A survey by Bath Council indicates there are 621 shops in the city centre, 269 of which are occupied by national multiples with 38 units vacant in the last quarter of 1995. This compares with a peak number of vacant units in 1993 of 73; the lowest figure recorded was in 1988 when there were only 20.<P>

During 1995, the downward trend in vacant units has been significant and there have been a considerable number of relocations and new openings - 62 retail businesses opened in the city centre during 1995. Most of these traders are independent speciality retailers that enhance the attractiveness of Bath as a shopping destination.<P>

The arrival of these new businesses has begun to spark improvements in the multiple shopping facilities available. House of Fraser has refurbished the Jolly's department store in Milsom Street and Jaeger has opened a fashion store in the same street. Karen Millen is to open in New Bond Street and both the Body Shop and Pilot have opened second units in prime positions near Marks & Spencer, which will shortly open a 30,000 sq ft extension to its existing Stall Street store.<P>

Vacancy rates in prime pitch are virtually nil, and rents have remained static for several years at about £1,600 per m<sup>2</sup> zone A.  The indications of activity throughout the market and the number of retailers' requirements suggest that pressure will begin to grow on rents throughout Bath, particularly in prime positions where a number of premiums have been offered.
Demand from occupiers is also creating a suitable environment for refurbishment to take place in prime and good secondary areas of the city.  There are already three or four projects in hand to remodel existing accommodation and create bigger shop units to satisfy large space requirements.<P>

With this sort of pressure mounting and with the retail market in the city showing strong signs of recovery from the recession, now is the ideal opportunity for the long overdue Southgate redevelopment to be resurrected.  Bath needs a quality multiple shopping facility which complements and enhances the atmosphere and environment currently provided by the rest of the shopping centre.  With traffic issues, strategic planning issues and, perhaps most importantly, major strategic land ownership all under the direct control of the new unitary authority of Bath & North East Somerset, a real opportunity exists to create a development which will be a credit to this world heritage city. <P>

In the past 18 months, defence cuts have proceeded apace, in the process de-staffing two large Ministry of Defence facilities in Bath.  In the past, the MoD employed about 6,000 staff. This could fall to below 2,000, prompting the council to lobby Government Agencies hard to relocate staff to the town.<P>

Through 1995 however, the supply of vacant office space continued to dwindle.  1,000m<sup>2</sup> at Palace Yard Mews being let to Future Publishing, now part of the Pearson Group, for example. Previously occupied by Norwich Union, the rent was £136 per m<sup>2</sup>, with no rent-free period.  Take-up is now exceeding supply, even on old space, and the development pipeline is negligible.  Rents in the city can vary from £50 per m<sup>2</sup> to £130 per m<sup>2</sup> with most falling in the £75 to £110 bracket.<P>

<H2>Infrastructure change in the South Coast Metropole</H2><P>
While the transportational links from the Metropole area are improving, rising levels of congestion remain a concern as a result of increased commuting and travel within the area. Links to the rest of the country improved immeasurably with the completion of the M3 extension which now provides a link with the national motorway network. The Newbury bypass on the A34 will solve one of the remaining traffic holdups between the South Coast and the M40, thus easing access to Birmingham and the North. This survived the bloodbath that the roads programme has become and now has to run the gamut of environmental protest throughout its completion.<P>

The implications of both these roads for manufacturing and distribution property markets throughout the region are manifest. The Newbury by-pass when complete, for example, will increase the population accessible from a warehouse in Eastleigh by nearly 20% within a 4½ hour drive time. The complete M3 cuts some thirty minutes off an HGV journey to London.<P> 

Further west, communications are the key to the future of Poole. The key investment for the continuing development of the town is the Poole Harbour Crossing. This would be a bridge connecting Poole to its main arterial road, the A31. This would transform communications  and would open up about 50 acres of land for development in the lower Hamworthy area including the old power station site. An international design competition has been held for the bridge and a shortlist is being drawn up.<P>

The port of Southampton handles over 7% of the UK's overseas trade - about 29.5m tons pa - as well as 210,000 cruise passengers. In the past few years ABP has built new cereals, fruit, vehicle and container handling facilities. More recently the company has acquired the 18.21ha former British Rail Engineering Works at Redbridge, which it wants for open storage and to relocate a container "stuffing" depot. At Portsmouth the City Council is investing around £6m for the reclamation of 4.5ha of land for freight assembly, the seventh phase of expansion at the port. The city has ambitious plans for regeneration following the contraction of the Royal Navy. It has won support from the Millennium Commission, which has allocated £40m of National Lottery money for a mix of commercial, leisure and residential schemes. Three principal sites have been identified - the 10.1ha Gunwharf, 4.9ha at Priddy's Hard and 0.8ha at Gosport Esplanade - all for a mix of uses.<P>

Portland Port, a subsidiary of Langham Industries, is the MOD's preferred purchaser for the naval base at Portland Harbour in Dorset. The company plans to create a major port on the south coast, operating commercial cargo and passenger shipping facilities. Negotiations are likely to be concluded by next March but, in the meantime, Portland Port is already marketing chunks of the site surplus to its requirements through agent Humberts Leisure. These include a 2.63ha site suitable for a marina, adjacent to a 4.86ha expanse of water for the creation of berths. A 91.06ha shorebase training establishment is being marketed separately. Known as the Upper Osprey Complex, this includes 23,2m<sup>2 </sup>of built space.<P> 

The proposal for a Regional Metro is currently being actively promoted and pursued by Hampshire County Council.  With the road network within the region not designed to meet the demands of commuting, such a proposal is an exciting alternative to investment in roads.  The system network is anticipated to start as a rapid light transport system running from Fareham down the Gosport peninsular into Portsmouth, but to be extended in time to Waterlooville, Southampton, Eastleigh and the Waterside. Given the relentless increase in environmental pressure against the use of the car - fuel prices continued their planned upward move in the budget - the principle of a light rail system looks secure. Funding and political will however may prove less so.<P>

The future of Southampton Airport now appears to be secure with a long term lease having been granted to BAA.  The development of a new terminal and ancillary buildings, coupled with an increased drive for business, have allowed the airport to increase its capacity with regular flights to major UK cities, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. Gazeley Properties has purchased a 29ha site at Southampton Airport for £6.5m for development as an industrial and distribution centre. Gazeley estimates that 124,000 m<sup>2</sup> of accommodation could be built on the site.<P>

The planned expansion of Bournemouth airport since its purchase by the National Express Group may prove to have an impact on trade through Southampton.  However, while their plans are to increase charter and air cargo traffic, the growth of the airport will be hampered by its relative isolation in terms of infrastructure for its distribution.  Its advantage will be gained with the planned expansion of the runway which will allow the handling of larger aircraft than nearby Southampton where  runway length is restricted by the proximity of both the motorway and railway.<P>

<H4>Introduction</H4>
<ul>

Until the UK recession of the early 1990's a majority of UK industrial property was let on twenty-five year leases, generally with five year, upward-only rent reviews.  This "Institutional" lease dominated, and some would say distorted, the behaviour of the UK property markets certainly since the 1960's.  Post the recession, which reached its nadir in mid-1992, leases have been much shorter. Currently a lease for industrial property is unusual if it runs for longer than 10 years.<P>

My objective in presenting this paper is to take a market view of UK industrial property in an occupational context. In almost all respects, however, the performance of the industrial property market is indivisible from the performance of UK industry generally, and they share common motivators and objectives. <P>

<BR>
</ul>
<H4>History</H4>

<UL>
The historical performance of the industrial property market has been shaped by the economic and political framework in which it has functioned.<P>

The economic context to the UK industrial property market over the last twenty-five years is one of seemingly inexorable decline.  An occupier of industrial property signing a new lease in 1971 would have been operating in a world in which the UK share of world trade in manufactured goods was over 9%.  Nearing the end of that lease in 1995 the same figure was below 5%.  <P>

In part of course this has been due to the meteoric, in economic terms, rise up the charts of the Tiger economies of the Pacific Rim, but it also has much to do with structural changes in the UK economy.  Between 1971 and the end of 1995 UK manufacturing output rose by a miserly 1.5%. Over the same period manufacturing output in Japan rose nearly 70% and in the USA over 50%.  Productivity growth however has proved to be as good as the output figures were bad - output per person rising by some 80% at the cost of over 3 million manufacturing jobs.<P>

The impact of change has differed disproportionately across the industrial spectrum.  Broadly speaking, our heavy industries have declined, in some cases to a residual rump of activity, whilst lighter, less asset-intensive industries have continued to prosper. There has also been a marked spatial effect. In the early eighties, for example, large areas of the industrial heartlands of the West Midlands and North West were rendered derelict. As you would expect, there are exceptions to this broad analysis but essentially what we have seen is the UK economy adapting to the supply and demand equations of an increasingly global economy.<P>

The economic canvas of the last twenty-five years has been shaped by the battle between employment on the one hand and inflation on the other.  Both these are of no little interest to property markets of course. <P>

In the late seventies a combination of an uncompetitive currency, labour inefficiency, poor plant and wage push (enforced by strikes and other Trades Union action) pushed inflation to a post-war high of 28%. Since then, barring a few alarms and excursions in the late eighties it has been kept more or less under control.  The cost however has been high, unemployment, particularly manufacturing unemployment, rose to unprecedented levels in the mid-eighties and remains at twice the level of 1971.<P>
 

The net impact of the last twenty-five years has been to leave an economy in which domestic expenditure is of paramount importance. Of the four main components of Gross Domestic Product, exports only account for 22% of Total Final Expenditure compared with 47% from Consumer Expenditure.<P>
         
<CENTER> <IMG border=2 SRC="http://www.kingsturge.co.uk/images/impm1.gif"></CENTER>
   


<P>

In fact there is every reason to be relatively optimistic about the prospects for UK manufacturing industry in the short-term at least. Currently by international standards the UK has:<P>

<UL>
<LI>	low inflation 
<LI>	a flexible and elastic labour market 
<LI>	a competitive currency
<LI>	low property costs
</UL>
<P>
Most importantly however the domestic consumer is returning to the market leading to increased expectations of demand.  In short most of the components of a manufacturing recovery are in place.  Are we are about to see UK manufacturing industry gain new strength and return to its dominant position in the world?  Or are we about to see defeat loom from the jaws of victory?<P>

An appropriate point to draw the political context to the fore perhaps.  For those of us that remember it, the 1970's in the UK was a time of fairly rapid changes of Government. Since 1979 however we have had only one party in Government. This has given us at least consistency policy, but it also enables us to identify the guilty men quite clearly, since the policy has been to have no policy at all.<P>

Broadly speaking the two poles of the industrial policy argument are an interventionist approach and a market-led one.  The tragedy of the UK industrial sector has been an inability to find a path of compromise between those poles. <P>

For our occupier in 1971, intervention held sway - guiding industry, diverting resources and even owning the capital stock.  There was broad political consensus around this position which tended to be driven by the need to protect employment.<P>

In 1979 however, all this changed. The election of a right-wing Conservative administration under the Iron Lady proved revolutionary in many ways. In particular the protection of employment implicit in the consensus of the seventies was reversed - control of inflation became the only goal, all other policy was subservient to that.  The effect was a complete abandonment of industrial policy to the whims of the market. Specifically it meant:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Privatisation of state-run industries
<LI>Reductions in funds for the spatial diversion of industry
<LI>Virtual abandonment of the town planning structure
</UL>
<P>
Worse still it fostered a climate of short-termism in which long-term investment in buildings and plant took second place to increased dividends.<P>

Combined with high interest rates these conditions first created a deep recession involving the closure of swathes of apparently uncompetitive industry, followed in time by a boom in property markets in the late eighties.<P>

In the nineties the Major administration has moved back towards the centre ground.  Spatial incentives are back in fashion, as is town planning, what remains noticeable by its absence is a coherent industrial policy.<P>

This may be about to change. The polls indicate a Labour administration is a near certainty post a general election, which has to be held by April 1997. Currently the economic pronouncements of the Labour economy team show very little to separate them from the Conservatives, especially on the key issue of inflation control.  Of course it has been put about, unkindly, that Labour would say anything to get elected and that their economic rectitude is only a veneer. Nevertheless, historically it is inconceivable that a Labour government would put anything other than employment at the top of its agenda and might therefore be expected to place economic growth ahead of the control of inflation.<P>

Structural change in industry has also been apparent during the eighties. Inward investment has been particularly important.  The arrival of manufacturing plants for Nissan, Honda and Toyota , for example, has revolutionised the motor vehicle industry in the UK.  Likewise the arrival of foreign capital has led to significant changes in ownership, continuing with the car industry, the acquisition of the Rover group by BMW saw almost the entire UK manufacturing capacity in the sector in foreign hands.<P>

The net impact of the last twenty-five years on the industrial property market can be seen in snapshots of the stock picture taken at ten yearly intervals.  Whilst the total floorspace of distribution warehouses grew over the period, general industrial property fell by over 40% between 1984 and 1994 reflecting particularly the virtual collapse of some parts of manufacturing industry.<P>
 

The qualitative impact has, however, been largely beneficial.  In many respects the industrial property market in 1971 reflected the failure of large parts of UK industry to adapt to change.  The elimination of large chunks of uncompetitive plant from the equation and the release of land for other, often more appropriate, uses, inevitably raised the average quality of the stock that remains. Over the twenty-five year period of our notional lease however, the quality stakes have been raised again by the spectre of carbon-based taxation.<P>

<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="http://www.kingsturge.co.uk/images/impm2.gif"></CENTER>
     

<P>
<BR>
</UL>
<H4>The current UK market</H4>
<UL>
Industrial property in the UK is used as a generic term to describe operational buildings in the industrial sector. It can encompass many types of building from the "shed" through to the high office content laboratory.  For the purposes of this paper I have identified two distinct types. The distribution warehouse and the "general" industrial property.<P><BR>
</UL>
<H4>Stock</H4>
<UL>
Built stock is measured infrequently and inconsistently within the UK.  England and Wales saw the last official figures in 1995, whilst Scotland and Northern Ireland have never prepared figures on the subject.  These data demonstrate the concentration of manufacturing floorspace in the West Midlands and North West of the country, focused upon Birmingham and Manchester respectively.<P>

Distribution stock is related far more to the motorway (interstate) network than to specific cities.  The vast majority (around 95%) of the distribution of manufactured goods in the UK is undertaken by road and this has determined the location of the stock.  The "golden" triangle determined by Northampton, Birmingham and Leicester has typically been favoured by the major distributors for national centres although indications are that changes to legislation may pull this area further to the south and east.  This legislation makes mandatory speed limiters set at 56 mph for all trucks above 10 tonnes in weight and restricts drivers to a maximum of 42 hours without a break.<P>
<BR>
</UL>

<H4>Vacancy</H4>
<UL>
The King Sturge & Co Industrial Floorspace Survey is the de-facto standard indicator of industrial vacancy in the UK.  Taken three times a year since 1975, the report shows the level of available space in buildings over 5,000 ft<sup>2</sup> split by age and size.  As a proxy for the health of the industrial market, it demonstrates clearly the pattern of activity over time and demonstrates a clear correlation with indicators of industrial capacity.  The dwindling proportion of new vacant property charts the progress of demand quite clearly, since this is, by definition, speculative.<P>

On the face of it, a market with 150 million square feet of available property does not suffer from a supply crisis. However this represents a vacancy rate of under 5%. Furthermore rudimentary qualitative analysis of the total reveals that up to 70% of this stock may have reached the end of its economic life and in better times may well represent development opportunities.  This is particularly true of distribution stock, where the demands of modern distribution systems are ill-suited to older building with inadequate clearance heights for example.<P><BR>
</UL>

<H4>Development pipeline</H4>
<UL>
Analysis of the planning system shows that some 145 million ft<sup>2</sup> of industrial space is in the development pipeline.<P>

Of this just under half is either Under Construction or has detailed planning permission.  General industrial space outnumbers distribution projects by two to one. It should be born in mind however that the general figure may in practice include some distribution space.<P>
<BR>
</UL>

<H4>Absorption</H4>
<UL>
The annual take-up of industrial space has averaged around 23 million square feet over the last decade. Demand for general industrial space has taken the lions share of this, averaging 18 million square feet per annum, whilst Distribution space has averaged some 5 million square feet per annum.<P><BR>
</UL>
<H4>Short-term demand</H4>
<UL>
The King Sturge & Co Volume of Outstanding Demand indicator analyses the volume and type of enquiries active at any point in time. This gives an indication of the rate of arrival of demand for industrial property and the time taken to service that enquiry. The net result is a volume of space "in the system" that can be compared with the volume of space available.<P>

This shows the steady increase in enquiries for space over the last five years. Currently there is some 60 million square feet of demand in the system and the conversion rate is increasing substantially.<P><BR>
</UL>
<H4>Medium-term demand</H4>
<UL>
Medium-term one is looking for demand proxies.  The one we have found to be most effective, despite the impact of falling employment in the industrial markets is manufacturing output.  Projections from the ITEM club, based upon the UK treasury model show a relatively healthy medium-term outlook with output expected to have risen by around 7% by the end of 2000.<P><BR>
</UL>
<H4>Price & Value</H4>

<UL>
UK industrial rents have been falling for five years, the outturn in 1995 showing a disappointing fall of just under 2%.  In terms of range, rental values for new property to institutional specification of say 5,000 ft<sup>2</sup> would be £9.00 in a prime location and £4.00 in an unfashionable backwater.<P>

The UK fares well by comparison with other European locations, coming in the bottom quartile for rents.<P><BR>

</UL>

<H3>The next decade</H3>
<H4>Opportunities:</H4>
<H4>Fitness for growth</H4>
<UL>

The main strength of the UK industrial market lies in the strength of UK industry itself.  Between mid-1992 and 1995 the general economic recovery was driven forward by the exporting capacity of the UK industrial sector in the face of miserable growth in consumer expenditure.  Only weakness in our main export markets have slowed that growth.  By and large UK industry is lean in terms of labour, reasonably fit in terms of capacity and standing on a platform of a very competitive currency.<P>
</UL>
<H4>Competitiveness</H4>
<UL>
Competitiveness is a function of a number of things: Low corporate taxation, an open market, incentives, a skilled labour force, a stable environment, good infrastructure and low labour costs. All these factors combine to make the UK amongst the most competitive of the mature industrial economies in which to base a business, but the key factor is one of cost, both relative and absolute.<P>

Changes in relative costs have been predominantly a function of exchange rate changes and here the indications are favourable for the UK.  Over the past four years, inflation adjusted Sterling rates have shown a substantial devaluation, particularly against the Japanese Yen, but also against the Franc and Mark. In the case of Japan the relative position has changed by a massive 29% due to the strength of the Yen. In practical terms this means that Japanese goods should be 29% more expensive than they were in 1991, an unsustainable increase over a four-year period. The accepted answer for Japanese manufacturers is to manufacture outside Japan ie invest in plant in other countries.<P>

Why should this investment come to the UK? Again cost is an important factor. The UK has one of the lowest rates of corporate tax in the European Union - 30%, compared with 45% in Germany and over 40% in Belgium, for example. Tax burdens are also eased by capital allowances and group relief, in which profits in one part of a group can be offset by losses in another. A further benefit is that the UK has a network of about 100 double-taxation agreements across the world, ensuring that a company's profits are not taxed twice.<P>

Low labour costs, and minimal labour regulation are a significant factor for many inward investors. The pattern of labour costs relative to our competitors stands below the 1985 base line in 1995. It costs 30% less to manufacture in the UK than in the USA for example, and labour costs in the UK are only 48% of those in Germany, inflated by their high non-wage social costs.<P>
</UL>

<H4>Threats</H4>
<UL>
Threats to the UK Industrial market are essentially the threats to investment. These come in four guises. 
</UL>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>Firstly to an extent we hold in our hands the seeds of our own destruction. Real average earnings in the UK have been held back by labour market uncertainties for much of the last fifteen years. There are clear signs now that the era of low labour market conflict ushered in by the miners strike is drawing to a close and that pressure on earnings will increase substantially. Already the UK rate of average earnings growth in the European Union is only bettered by Italy and Spain.<P>

<LI>Secondly there are few who doubt that costs will increase under a Labour Administration. The relative labour cost between the UK and Germany serve as a salutary lesson of the potential impact upon competitiveness of an ill-judged rush to embrace the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. A minimum wage rate of £4.15 per hour, for example,would have a chastening impact upon labour costs.<P>
	
<LI>Thirdly there is the question of monetary union. 1996 will be the year in which the timescale for a common european currency is determined by events. There is no doubt that the UK benefits currently from the position of Sterling relative to the Mark for example. This affects not only investment in the UK, but also the price of UK exports in Germany, our largest trading partner. On the other hand volatility of exchange rates can increase the costs of doing business substantially. The question is whether the benefits of stability inherent in the Euro are enough to offset the trading flexibility of the pound.<P>

<LI>Lastly there is the question of the competition, both for funds and for jobs. The competition for funds is already clear - the exponential growth of China as a market has the capacity to mop up all the available inward investment for many years to come. The so-called transition economies of eastern Europe remain in relative turmoil. Although they have secured significant investment in the nineties the political risk of investing there remains high. Perceptions are that the economies are still fragile, inflation is still high and the disciplines of a capitalist system are yet to become ingrained. <P>
</UL>

The World Economic Outlook produced by the International Monetary Fund in October 1995 shows some telling statistics with regard to these economies, and the rate at which they are becoming a threat.<P>

Overall in 1995 the countries of central and eastern Europe, excluding the Ukraine and Belarus  grew at 4.0% in real terms in 1995, faster than the UK. The inflation rates, whilst high, are comparable with worst excesses of the UK in the late seventies and are falling. Of course labour costs are a fraction of those in the UK. Once the political risk subsides, these countries will prove a major threat to the attraction and retention of inward investment. By the turn of the century they will be pushing for EU membership and will provide a low-cost, high skill base for companies looking to manufacture in Europe.
</UL>


<H4>Conclusions</H4>
<UL>
Currently the UK offers significant cost advantages for the inward investor in a stable political and economic environment.  This optimism should be tempered however by the realisation that these competitive advantages are being eroded relatively quickly by events outside our control.<P>  

There is an argument about that the creation of competitiveness is in some sense a replacement for industrial policy.  One of the problems of having the same Government for sixteen years is that dogma tends to overtake reasoned debate. It has become deeply unfashionable to talk about industrial policy at all.  Whilst it is clear that the wholly interventionist approaches of the seventies are inappropriate in a global economy, it is equally clear that many of the features of rampant market forces are equally unacceptable.<P>

It is unrealistic to pretend that any industrial policy will reverse the de-industrialisation of the UK economy but surely it is realistic to expect a policy that will place industry at the forefront of the economy - one that will identify change, facilitate adaption and mitigate against the effects of market collapse.<P>

The UK industrial property market is at a fork in the road.  In the right climate, long-term investment will improve and the market then is well positioned to see sustained growth in demand over the next ten years.<P>

<H2>Leeds Market Summary</H2>
<ul>

Demand for office space stems from finance and professional services.  It is this demand that keeps Leeds at the pinnacle of the financial and legal services market.  However, in the core area there is limited supply of available space and as a result occupiers have acquired new space in secondary locations.<P>

Nevertheless, occupier demand remains uncertain in the short-term and rental growth will be dependent on the outcome of the larger requirements and whether they are satisfied.  If they are satisfied, take-up space will rise and supply of prime office space would reduce and prime rents would set to increase over the period of the next 12-18 months.  If the larger requirements fail to materialise there will be an increase in over-supply and prime rentals remain static.<P>

The industrial market for the Leeds area has felt the effects of the downturn in the manufacturing industry.  Nevertheless, in the short to medium-term there are indications that overall prospects are improving and this can be seen in the distribution sector.  The area benefits from good communications and planned investment in the regions infrastructure strengthens its position. <P>

There is clear evidence of continued market activity within the industrial sector and enquiries for the first quarter of 1996 are up approximately 50%  compared with the same quarter in 1995.  However, there continues to be a lack of quality space in excess of 9,290 m<sup>2</sup> and a severe shortage for other sizes between 929 m<sup>2</sup> and 9,290 m<sup>2</sup>.  The main bulk of supply is in the region of 929 m<sup>2</sup> for the area.<P>

Whilst there is a decline in supply of existing quality stock there is an abundance of design and build schemes throughout the region.  This mainly forms around the M62 Corridor on green and brown field sites in varying sizes.  However, it is becoming clear that many occupiers are not willing to consider design and build projects as a result of timescales, prices an the obvious complexities of such developments.  Therefore a number of developers are now seriously considering speculative development and if early lettings increase then developer confidence could lead to the reintroduction of speculative developments throughout the region.<P>

Leeds city centre has developed into one of the strongest retail centres in the UK outside of London.  With a choice of 360 multiple retailers and over a 160,000 m<sup>2</sup> of retail floorspace. <P>  

To date there have been five significant development that can only strengthen Leeds as a retail centre:-<P>
<ol>

<li>Harvey Nichols and Lillywhites have opened their first department stores outside of London and this has been a major boost for the city.  Harvey Nichols is located within Prudentials Victoria Quarter on Briggate and totals over 427 m<sup>2</sup>.  Lillywhites are to locate within the former Schofield Centre on the Headrow.  This area of Leeds has been further strengthened as a retail destination by Marks and Spencers revamping their existing store and the citys two major department stores, Debenhams and Rackhams are to extensively refurbish current stores.<P>

<li>The Bond Street Centre is currently being refurbished and includes Boots and BHS.  Virgin will locate a 1,860 m<sup>2</sup> Mega Store in the Centre by the start of 1997.<P>

<li>Outside the city centre, Land Securities are developing the White Rose Centre which is 56,000 m<sup>2</sup> and will be anchored by Debenhams, Savacentre, C&A and BHS.  In addition to this other tenants include Mothercare, Disneyworld, WH Smith, Woolworths, Boots and Next.  It is scheduled to open in March 1997 and there are currently few units remaining.

<H2>Squaring the circle - The Property Economy</H2>
Property markets thrive on two things, growth and change. The former drives short-term demand, pulling forward the need to invest in additional capacity. The latter affects the structure of demand bringing investment in different capacity to the fore. Structural change is relatively easy for the property market to understand and react to, since usually it takes place over a longer time period. Growth, on the other hand, is altogether a more taxing conundrum.<P>

The budget of November last year had the twin objectives of making the Government seem competent economic managers whilst boosting consumer expenditure. The more cynical commentators, myself included, had foreseen the possibility of a Chancellor rolling out the pork barrel in a bid to regenerate the mythical 'feel good' factor in preparation for an election. <P>

<I>In truth, the economy at the end of 1995 was at the crossroads. Manufacturers holding unsold stocks were facing a sluggish economy and wondering whether to keep producing or stop and allow stocks to run down.</I><P>
<br>
<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="/images/econ.gif"></CENTER><P>
<br>
Interest rates over the last forty years have shown two distinct profiles - the stable, low level fifties and sixties and the volatile, high level of the seventies and eighties. Low inflation expectations should ensure that rates in the medium-term follow the former rather than the latter pattern.<P>
Treasury forecasts are for a growth rate of 3% in output in 1996 - an optimistic estimate by the standards of most other analysts, including the panel of Treasury Advisors. <P>

This implies that monetary policy in 1996 will be considerably looser than it has been hitherto, with significant falls in interest rates on the cards.<P>

Market perception of interest  rates has been tempered by the experiences of the eighties when rates rose to previously unseen highs. In fact looking longer term this period of higher rates began with the worldwide recession in the early seventies, before that there had been a long period of stability in interest rates.<P>

Over the last forty years, the period between 1955 and 1972 saw interest rates average just below 6%. From 1973 to 1995, however, in addition to a much increased volatility, average rates were much higher at around 10.6%.<P>

It is precisely this that gives rise to a widely-held concern that rates at their current level will not be sustained.<P>

The secondary effects of that cynicism underpin the subdued levels of consumer expenditure and have an impact upon private sector investment.<P>

Looking at real interest rates over the period - i.e. rates net of inflation - a different pattern emerges. Real rates were relatively low in the fifties and sixties. Between 1955 and 1969 the average was 2.4%. Over the seventies the average rate was negative at -2.3%. From 1980 to 1995 however, real rates have averaged 4.5%. As far as investment is concerned this would indicate that stability of expectation is as important as the actual level of interest rates.<P>

<I>The pattern of fixed investment in new buildings and works over the last forty years demonstrates the impact of interest rate volatility in the seventies and early eighties in reducing investment.</I><P>
<br>
<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="/images/econ1.gif"></CENTER><P>
<br>
There is of course no guarantee that interest rates will return to the pattern of the fifties and sixties. The economic structure of the UK has seen dramatic changes in the intervening period. It seems likely, however, that with an economy on the path of low inflation and steady growth, relatively low interest rates will be a feature of the medium-term economic climate.<P>

The implications of this for the property industry are profound. The high interest rates seen in the eighties may not be expected, but the corollary of this is that neither will the high growth rates. Perhaps most important of all, however, will be the attitude of the consumer.<P>

The economic recovery post 1992 was led largely by exports, with private sector investment and consumer expenditure relatively subdued. Concomitantly the recovery in occupational property markets has been slow to take root. <P>

Reductions in interest rates, and just as importantly a pattern of stability, should have an impact on consumer expenditure, reducing the cost of servicing debts and acting as a incentive to spend rather than to save. Similarly stability in the pattern of interest rates will facilitate private sector investment in plant, machinery and buildings. <P>

Any recovery in occupational markets must be tempered by the fact that much of the space available has probably reached the end of its economic life. However, the policies of economic integrity and steady growth espoused by the current administration may well set the foundation for a sustained recovery in the fortunes of the property market, but based upon change rather than on growth.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>The Industrial Development Market</H2><P>
The statistics available concerning the industrial market are instructive. As at the end of 1995 there were some 14 million square metres of industrial property available in England and Wales.  Of this total around 1 million square metres was brand new, a low proportion of the total historically. Set against this King Sturge & Co are able to identify circa 6 million square metres of enquiries for industrial space at all size bands and qualities. Basic arithmetic appears to dictate that the system is holding over two years supply of vacant space.<P>

It is perhaps surprising then that the development pipeline shows a total of  12.7 million square metres of industrial foolscap - another two years worth of supply. Of this 1.3 million square feet is under construction.<P>
<br>
<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="/images/prev1a.gif"></CENTER><P>
<br>
This indicates two things in particular. Firstly that a considerable proportion of the vacant industrial stock has reached the end of its economic life, secondly that the industrial market has the potential to start moving very quickly as investment decision that have already been made are implemented.<P>

The King Sturge Industrial Floorspace Survey has been recording available industrial floorspace for twenty years. Generally, buildings which have outlived their span are excluded from the total, for example old mill buildings in the North West. The criterion used for inclusion is the pragmatic one of lettability - would a potential tenant be able to occupy the building? There is of course a world of difference between tenant behaviour in a booming market and a flat one, and it is clear that much of the available space would fail this test in better times.<P>

Regular qualitative surveys are undertaken on a sample of the availability database revealing the nature of much of the floorspace. Generally for example, only between 20% and 30% of the available space, depending on region, qualifies as prime, the remainder falling short of this description. In January 1996, only 30% has good access to the motorway or trunk road network. An even smaller proportion meets modern parking requirements (18%).<P>
<br>
<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="/images/prev1b.gif"></CENTER><P>
<br>
A regional breakdown of the development pipeline reveals where the business confidence in an industrial recovery resides. As a proportion of the built stock of industrial property the South West and South East outside Greater London have the largest development pipelines. The South West has 1.5 million square metres either with permission or under construction - nearly 7% of built stock. The Rest of the South East has 2.5 million square metres at the same stage, just over 5% of stock.<P>

The other regions with the biggest stock of space, the West Midlands and the North West, have between 3% and 4% of stock in the pipeline, whilst regions such as East Anglia and Greater London see below 3%.<P>

With respect to timing all regions with the exception of Wales have between 7% and 12% of their pipelines under construction. In Wales, where the market is spurred on by the Welsh Development Agency, the proportion of space under construction rises as high as 18%. Slightly further out however, ther are marked disparities between regions with respect to detailed permissions. In the North, only 19% of the pipeline has detailed permission whilst in Wales the figure rises to 60%.<P>


Early indication of activity in 1996 are that enquiry volumes are rising fast, particularly in the South of the country. After five years of famine it would be ironic indeed if the market failed to react to this demand quickly enough and real shortages emerge.<P>

<H2>Rail distribution</H2><P>
With the announcement of the winning consortium to develop the Channel Tunnel rail link, it seems appropriate to examine the likely impact of rail upon the distribution market. Department of Transport statistics show that rail's share of the UK freight market has suffered long-term decline, with rail accounting for only 6% of goods moved in the UK in 1993 compared with 42% in 1952. Around three-quarters (74%) of all freight moved by rail consists of bulk goods, mainly coal, construction materials, metals, oil and petroleum.<P>

The main explanation for rail's low share of non-bulk products is that rail is uncompetitive for distributing these types of goods over distances less than 400 km (c. 250 miles).  The trend towards the centralisation of warehouse facilities has reinforced this constraint, since many companies are able to serve their regional markets from a single strategically-located national distribution centre, from which transport distances are less than 400 km.  The average length of haul for all goods vehicles, whilst showing a long-term upward trend, was only 82 kilometres in 1992. <P>

However, a number of factors are likely to encourage greater rail use.  These include:<P>
<UL>
	 	the rising cost of road transport, with the Government committed to raising fuel duties in real terms by 5% per annum and currently examining electronic motorway tolling;<P>

	 	increasing road congestion, with the volume of traffic on motorways and trunk roads projected to rise sharply while the Government is cutting back its roads' programme; <P>

	 	the tight regulatory regime for road freight distribution, with existing restrictions on  maximum uninterrupted driver hours (currently 4½ hours) and HGV speed limits (currently 56 miles per hour) likely to become tighter over the longer-term; <P>

	 	increasing environmental concerns, coupled with Government support, via Freight Facilities Grants, to make rail use viable;<P>

	 	greater potential for international rail freight distribution, following the opening of the Channel Tunnel for rail freight distribution in 1994 and the opening of a number of intermodal terminals in 1995. <P>
</UL>
This final factor is likely to be particularly important because it enables rail to distribute goods  over longer distances and overcome the viability constraint of shorter hauls. <P>

Nonetheless, despite these factors favouring rail, the overall increase in rail freight is likely to be relatively limited.  According to forecasts from Cambridge Econometrics, rail freight will actually fall over the remainder of this decade compared with 1994 before staging a slight recovery between 2000-2005.  The Cambridge Econometrics' model forecasts that in 2005 rail freight will be around 8% higher than in 1994, while road freight will be 39.7% higher. <P>

The number of sites with rail facilities in the UK is currently limited and the majority of those which are operational do not provide significant amounts of available property or offer substantial opportunities for new property development.  The principal intermodal facilities currently fully operational are:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Moss End, near Glasgow
<LI>Trafford Park, Manchester
<LI>Willesden, north west London
<LI>Port of Liverpool
<LI>Landor Street, Birmingham.
</UL>
<P>
Of these five intermodal facilities, only Moss End has potential for substantial new property development, having an overall potential for around 650,300 m<sup>2</sup>, including 48.6 hectares in a rail-connected freight village.  The other four intermodal terminals are essentially transhipment facilities and generally do not provide substantial potential for new warehousing and industrial development, although adjacent to Trafford Park, Gazeley and Trafford Park Estates own a 17 hectares (42 acres) site which could be developed with a rail spur.  

The main sites with intermodal terminals scheduled to become operational in the short-term are:

<UL>
<LI>Corby Eurohub
<LI>Wakefield Europort (although this is not genuinely intermodal)
<LI>Hams Hall, Birmingham
<LI>Direct for Europe, Doncaster
<LI>Stratford, east London
<LI>Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal
</UL>
<P>
With the exception of Stratford all of these have a significant potential for associated property development.  The largest in terms of overall floorspace potential is Hams Hall, which has provision for up to 510,950 m<sup>2</sup> of industrial and warehousing space.  Wakefield Europort has potential for up to 325,150 m<sup>2</sup> and Direct for Europe, Doncaster can accommodate around 92,900 m<sup>2</sup>. <P>

Among the proposals for intermodal terminals are two in south Wales, at Gwent Europark and Wentloog, Cardiff - only one of which is likely to be development subject to European Union funding support; two in the South West region, at Merebank, Avonmouth and South Marston Swindon; and a proposal by British Coal Property, English Partnership and Salford City Council to develop a rail centre on the former Agecroft colliery site in Salford. <P>

Whilst relatively limited at present, the number of intermodal sites is set to increase quite significantly over the next few years.  This will mean that users requiring a site with intermodal access will have a wider choice than currently, and this may constrain the growth in values for intermodal sites and associated properties. <P>  

The evidence from recent occupier transactions suggests that there is growing demand for sites with rail facilities, with users either satisfying immediate requirements for rail use or looking longer-term at the potential for rail distribution, as road transport becomes more costly and the regulatory framework for road freight distribution more restrictive.  In addition, currently sites with rail facilities are not attracting premiums over other sites, so users can hedge their bets without incurring additional costs. <P>

Whilst the overall number of occupier transactions completed on sites with intermodal facilities is relatively small, the motor industry has provided the main source of take-up for rail-related distribution.  The demand from the motor sector is primarily for land to store vehicles rather than for property.   Examples of rail-related demand from motor vehicle users include:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Sheertruck Ltd, which stores vehicles for Land Rover at Hams Hall, Birmingham;
<LI>Walon, the largest French-owned third party distributor of motor vehicles, at Corby Eurohub;
<LI>Gefco (UK), a subsidiary of Peugot Citroen, also at Corby Eurohub. 
</UL>
<P>
In addition to these specific examples of motor industry demand, a number of intermodal sites either currently have, or have set aside land for, dedicated car terminals.  For example, Autotrax (a joint venture between Axial Express and Railfreight Distribution) operate a car terminal at Moss End and 16.2 hectares at Hams Hill has been set aside for a car terminal. <P>

Third party contractors comprise the second main source of take-up on intermodal sites, with Transport Development Group (TDG) having a 28,870 m<sup>2</sup> warehouse with rail spur at Mossend, Wincanton Distribution having a 23,225 m<sup>2 </sup>warehouse at Corby Eurohub and a planning application for 14,864m<sup>2</sup>  currently lodged for a contractor at Hams Hall. <P>

In conclusion, recent take-up suggests that demand for sites with intermodal access is relatively healthy, with current supply limited.  The main demand for intermodal site s has currently come from the motor industry.   Whilst we would expect the rail freight market to expand over the longer-term, rail growth will continue to lag behind road freight growth. <P> 

With the number of intermodal terminals set to expand quite rapidly, the rail freight market will become very competitive over the next few years. By 2002, the delivery date for the new Channel Tunnel rail link, the re-establishment of rail to its rightful place in the distribution chain should be well advanced.<P>

<H2>Factory Outlet Centres</H2>

There are over three hundred factory outlet centres in operation in North America, more than double the number open at the beginning of 1988. Outlet floorspace has increased commensurately over the same period, up 92% at over 4 million m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

In the UK by comparison there are only seven outlet centres open, but with a further 20 in the development pipeline. Current occupied space is over 55,700 m<sup>2</sup>, but with 214,000 m<sup>2</sup> at various stages of development.<P>
<br>
<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="/images/out1.gif"></CENTER>
<br>
Factory shops have existed in the United Kingdom for as long, if not longer than in the USA. It has been estimated that over 1,200 of them exist today either in factories, selling the company's products, or integrated into the existing high street structures. <P>

The question for the United Kingdom is whether the specialist outlet centre as a concept will reach enough critical mass to grow at the rates seen during the 1980's in the USA.<P>

That consumer demand exists in principle cannot be doubted. Clark's Village at Street, for example, exceeded its visitor target for the first year within three months of opening. United Kingdom manufacturers may need more persuasion, but they cannot ignore the success of their counterparts across the Atlantic. It should be remembered that many American manufacturers were very sceptical of the concept originally.<P>

In general, United Kingdom developers were slow to recognise this opportunity initially. Hornsea Freeport can lay claim to being the first United Kingdom outlet centre, opening in 1990. <P>
This was modelled on the American pattern, but in miniature. Likewise the Clarks outlet village at Street which opened in August 1993. <P>

The main running is being made by American and European developers like McArthur Glen, the hybrid Value Retail and the indigenous Freeport Leisure.  The Value Retail scheme at Bicester and the BAA/McArthur Glen Cheshire Oaks development are probably the leading outlet centres in the UK.<P>

The main risk to the establishment of Outlet Centres in the UK is the possibility of supply constraint.  Despite the growth in out of town retailing, and the development of a few "mall" type regional centres, comparison retailing, particularly in non-durable goods remains focused firmly on the town centre. Planning policies generally reflect this, protecting the centre by discouraging out of centre development and the current Minister for the Environment has leaped upon this particular bandwagon with some enthusiasm and effect.<P>

United Kingdom retailers generally have been cushioned by relatively high margins over many years and have become adept at using the planning system. In the past these skills have been used against the planning policies of local authorities. In the case of factory outlet development they may well be used to support the status quo against developers.<P>

These risks however are not sufficiently threatening to render the foray into outlet centre retailing unsustainable. The C&J Clarke outlet centre at Street has proved sufficiently successful to merit a doubling of its size, likewise the Hornsea centre and Cheshire Oaks at Chester. Seemingly new proposals are being announced almost daily. <P>


<H4>The potential market opportunity</H4><P>

Sales have become a year-round feature in high streets across the United Kingdom. This begs the question - Have discounts become institutionalised? <P>

The evidence from the USA is that discount retailing is very popular indeed amongst the  middle income earners. These are unlikely to be suffering supply constraints in terms of disposable income so the conclusion should be drawn that  they like discounts. <P>

Determining the potential market size for factory outlet centres in the United Kingdom is problematic. The pattern in the United States is that "Pure" outlet centres took just over 3% of all apparel sales. As in the USA, the factory outlet centres in the United Kingdom are likely to be dominated by clothing and footwear outlets. <P>

At current prices retail expenditure on clothing and footwear in 1992 was some £25 billion. US outlets trade at up to 40% over equivalent high street densities. Taking an average retail density for clothing, and uprating it by 25%, we arrive at a likely floorspace provision of just under 760,000 m<sup>2</sup> in 1995. At an average size of 12,000 m<sup>2</sup> this would mean around  60 such centres in the United Kingdom. Indicating a substantial gap between demand and supply over the next few years.<P>

<H2>The Red Book</H2>
The new RICS Appraisal and Valuation Manual is effectively the fourth edition of the Red Book.  The first edition can be traced back to the problems caused by the property recession of 1973.  It is perhaps indicative that valuers often take the blame when property values fall, whereas rises in values are more often due to the financial acumen of the investor and developer!<P>

The manual is a watershed with its emphasis on demonstrating to clients that their needs are recognised, ensuring the clarity of reports and their relevance, particularly when published.<P>

Clearly the manual is not going to win the Booker Prize and can be criticised as introducing too many  different definitions but it is both a benchmark and a high threshold, and valuers fail to grasp its complexity at their peril. The new Manual combines the old Red and White Books in two main sections:<P>

<UL>
<LI> Practice statements
<LI> Guidance notes
</UL>

<STRONG>Practice Statements </STRONG>
<UL>
The first seven of these refer to the generality of work and the remaining fifteen to particular reasons for valuation; these are mandatory.
</UL>

<STRONG>Guidance Notes</STRONG>
<UL>
These cover both highly specialised types of property and general matters. Their application is defined by exceptions, these are principally:<P>

<UL>
<LI> judicial and quasi judicial circumstances.
<LI> internal work by valuers.
<LI> valuations in the course of negotiations.
<LI> valuations prior to agency instructions (but not sale or purchase reports).
<LI> certain assumptions in forecasts.
</UL>
<P>
At least one of the following examples of their use will be relevant to readers:<P>
</UL>
<STRONG>Intercompany leases</STRONG>
<UL>
Whilst these may be reflected in the accounts of subsidiaries, they should be disregarded in the consolidated accounts of the Group, since unless consolidated, the vacant possession assumption applies.  (Perhaps the solution is to cross transfer freeholds between Institutions in order to raise the asset base of their consolidated accounts.)
</UL>
<STRONG>Secured Funding</STRONG>
<UL>
A new definition of Estimated Realization Price (ERP) is introduced as an alternative to Open Market Value, the principal difference is that with the former it is assumed that the marketing process starts on the valuation date, whereas with the latter definition, the deal is struck on the valuation date.
</UL>
<STRONG>Company Accounts</STRONG>
<UL>
Typical trading companies are valued on the basis of existing use value.  This assumption of continuing use means that some factors that could depress open market value such as restrictive covenants  or assignment issues can be set aside.
</UL>
<STRONG>Overseas Property</STRONG>
<UL>
Here the International Valuation Standards Committee definition of market value may apply, which differs from open market value, though it should result in the same reported figure.
</UL>
<STRONG>Leisure Properties</STRONG>
<UL>
These are increasingly acceptable within the investment forum. There is extensive reference in the statements with a comprehensive guidance note entitled Trading Related Valuations and Goodwill.
</UL>
<STRONG>Insurance Companies </STRONG>
<UL>
Practice Statement 16 specifically interprets The Insurance Companies Regulations 1994 (SI 1994 No 1516), where a "proper valuation" must be made by a named "qualified valuer".
</UL>

<H2>PROPERTY UNDER LABOUR</H2><P>
<ul>
"Property under Labour" is a lengthy document so we have made it available in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) format. To view this you will need a freely available copy of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/readstep.html">Acrobat Reader</a>.<P>Below is an executive summary of the report which you can <A HREF="http://www.kingsturge.co.uk/data/research/1996/12dec/lab2.pdf">download here: </a> <P>




<STRONG>1. INTRODUCTION</STRONG>

<P>
With a general election at most only eight months away, speculation is increasing about the impact on property of a change in government.  The Labour Party will need a larger national swing than it has managed in any previous general election to win an overall majority, but the party's current poll lead suggests that a Labour government is the most probable outcome of the next election.<P>

This report highlights the impact a Labour Government could have on the commercial and industrial property markets.  <P>

<UL>
<LI>Section 2 describes the likely state of the UK economy and property market which Labour might inherit. <P>
<LI>Section 3 outlines current Labour thinking and policies. <P>
<LI>Section 4 provides our assessment of how Labour's stated policies or intentions could effect property.  This section includes some comment on what Labour may do in areas where it has not spelt out its proposals in detail, plus some assessment of how policy may evolve under different scenarios. <P>
<LI>Section 5 briefly examines some issues which are unsustainable in the way they are currently developing and which are, therefore, likely to require a policy response from whichever party is in power.    
</UL>
<P>
<BR>
<STRONG> SUMMARY</STRONG><P>

<UL>
<LI>In many areas effecting property, notably macroeconomic management and transport, there has been a significant degree of policy convergence between the Conservatives and Labour.  At an aggregate level, therefore, we do not expect a Labour Government to make a dramatic difference to the property market. <P>
<LI>The effect of Labour on property would be felt through its impact on the economy and specific property, or property-related, policies.  In our central economic scenario, Labour has a mildly beneficial effect on growth and employment, because of higher  investment, but at the expense of slightly higher inflation.<P>
<LI>There are clearly risks to this scenario if the fiscal prudence of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown comes under a strong challenge from the Party's left-wing.  If Labour wins, much may depend on the size of its majority.  A relatively large majority could strengthen 'New Labour', whereas a small majority might make Tony Blair more vulnerable to 'Old Labour' MPs.  Under various 'Old Labour' scenarios, employment assumes a stronger priority than inflation, leading to higher growth but higher inflation and interest rates.  
</UL>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Occupier Markets</STRONG><P>

<UL>
<LI>Stronger economic growth under Labour could generate a slightly higher level of occupier demand. Set against this scenario is the probability that Labour would increase corporation tax, which could reduce companies' property requirements.<P> 
 <LI>Specific Labour policies could stimulate occupier demand in certain office markets.<P>
<ul>
<LI>Scottish and Welsh devolution could boost the Edinburgh and Cardiff markets.  Edinburgh would benefit much more than Cardiff. <P>
<LI>A new London-wide strategic authority may benefit the London office market.  If the UK joined EMU, concerns about the implications of non-membership for London's status as a financial centre would be dispelled. <P>
<LI>Labour's regional approach, including stronger regional development agencies, may be positive for certain major regional cities. <P>
</ul>
<LI>Occupier demand for industrial property could be affected under a range of scenarios.<P>
<ul>
<LI>Demand from manufacturing companies may be mildly stimulated by Labour's stronger emphasis on manufacturing, but the sector will continue to contract in terms of its contribution to national output and employment. <P>
<LI>Demand from distribution companies could be effected by proposals to increase rail freight distribution and reduce HGV traffic.  Labour remains opposed to motorway tolls. <P>
<LI>Inward investment could be weakened if Labour increased corporation tax significantly.  We do not believe Labour's adherence to the European Social Chapter or introduction of a national minimum wage would have a significant negative impact on inward investment. 
</ul>
</UL>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Retail </STRONG><P>

<UL>
<LI>Labour's effect on the retail occupier market is likely to be neutral overall but  uncertainties remain.   At present, Labour has not said what its personal taxation  plans will be, although it has said that it will not return to 'penal rates' and that it aspires to introduce a new bottom rate of 10 per cent for people on lowest incomes.  Doubts remain about a higher tax rate, although recent reports suggest that Tony Blair favours a top rate ceiling of 50 per cent only for those earning £100,000 or above.  <P>
<LI>Labour has become more pragmatic on out-of-town retail development, suggesting that it may be more accommodating to retailer demands for out-of-town stores than presently under the Conservatives.   
</UL>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Development Markets</STRONG><P>
<UL>

<LI>Developers are unlikely to face a significantly different planning regime under Labour than currently.  Labour's main planning proposals include:<P>
<ul>
<LI>setting up a Planning Policy Guidance Advisory committee to review existing PPGs and to ensure greater consistency in the guidance that emerges from government;<P>
<LI>streamlining development plans inquiries, for example by enabling the inspector to provide a statement at the start of the enquiry identifying the main issues; <P>
<LI>making the Secretary of State more accountable for 'Call-in' decisions by requiring the Secretary to provide reasons for calling-in an application and by imposing a timetable on call-in decisions;<P>
<LI>establishing clear and consistent rules on planning gain to ensure transparency. <P>
</ul>
<LI>Labour is likely to be more pragmatic than the current Government with respect to out-of-town retail development. <P>
<LI>Labour's directly elected authority for London would have a strategic land use role but detailed planning decisions will remain with the boroughs.  Labour will retain the City of London Corporation. <P>
<LI>Outside Greater London, Labour will set up 'regional chambers' with a strategic land use role.  Labour's optional second step proposals for directly elected 'regional assemblies' outside London are likely to be realised, if at all, in only one or two regions, such as the North East. <P>
<LI>Labour will change the urban policy structure but has ruled out any new money over and above the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB).  Existing SRB funds will be consolidated into a new Civic Grant.  The role of local authorities will be enhanced at the expense of Quangos.  Urban Development Corporations will be wound down and the position of English Partnership reviewed.  Existing urban policy projects will be managed to completion. <P>
<LI>Development opportunities may be encouraged through the relaxation of rules governing local authorities' borrowing and by the phased release of capital receipts, which will give local authorities more freedom to invest in their local economies.  If implemented, these changes could remove the incentive for local authorities to pursue Private Finance Initiative options.

<LI>As the election approaches, uncertainty may reinforce current investor caution to produce an hiatus in investment activity for two or three months either side of polling day. <P>
<LI>Our central economic scenario of steady growth and low inflation implies relatively modest rental growth prospects for property overall.  Gilt yields will rise modestly over the medium-term  exerting upward pressure on property yields, especially for over-rented and secondary properties.  We expect rental growth on better quality institutional grade property to offset this upward pressure and, therefore, anticipate a marginal inward movement in yields for this class of property over the medium-term, probably in the range of 25 to 50 basis points. <P>
<LI>In 'Old Labour' scenarios stronger demands for Government spending lead to slightly stronger economic growth but at the cost of higher inflation, interest rates, government debt and gilt yields.  Compared with our central case, these scenarios suggest, on average, higher rental growth but higher property yields.

<STRONG>ENGLAND & WALES</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>1995</STRONG><P>
 
The downward trend established in 1994, following relentless increases earlier in the decade, was consolidated in 1995. An overall decrease in England and Wales of 9% was recorded compared with 7% the year before.  In floorspace terms, a reduction of 1.334 million m<sup>2</sup> was evident compared with 1.171 million m<sup>2</sup> in 1994. <P>

Regionally, the picture is significantly different from twelve months ago. The northern regions together with the West Midlands were showing the largest decreases in our 1994 review, while it is the southern regions and the East Midlands that feature double figure percentage falls in 1995.  The latter having the largest decrease at 15% with the South West down 13% and the South East, provider of about one third of the total floorspace at 11%. All other regions record decreases albeit below the average.<P>

New building floorspace in England and Wales decreased by 14% or 184,000 m<sup>2</sup> in 1995 compared with a 18% fall in 1994. Given the overall reduction, this category remains at 8% of the total stock.<P> 
 
Floorspace in large buildings fell by a significant 17% or 436,000 m<sup>2</sup> compared with a 12% decrease in 1994. With this appreciably larger decrease the percentage of available stock in this category falls by two points to 15% <P>
Distribution remains an active sub-sector as the goal of producing the ultimate in efficient facilities continues, often applying high technology equipment, with the aim of reducing the amount of stock in the supply chain. Such goals are not without pain however both in terms of the workforce and the short term costs incurred. Kwiksave's new centralised distribution centre in Wellingborough, Northants, which came on stream during the year, has resulted in the company allowing a multi-million pound figure for redundancy costs and the disposal of surplus depots.<P>

The availability of surplus government department properties was much in evidence. A number of former airforce bases have been offered during the year, some which are sufficiently large to be described as self-contained communities. The future use and development of the latter in particular, often in a rural setting, is the subject of much debate. The elements of industrial and warehousing are included in most of these properties will only be included in our surveys as and when such premises are offered separately as opposed to part of the overall package. <P>

In infrastructure terms, the importance of rail is set to increase due not only to the direct accessibility to the extensive network on the European mainland but also the ever-tightening pressures on road transport. Though the latter will continue to bear the vast majority of goods traffic, central government seems incapable of keeping to its own road-building programme, as highlighted by the latest dramatic cutbacks in the Budget. Issues of congestion, safety and the environment remain to be adequately addressed let alone resolved. Slowing traffic is seen as a factor with speed limiters set at 56 mph (90 kph) maximum for most trucks over 12 tonnes. If car drivers thought they were exempt, the pilot scheme of variable speed limits on part of the M25 may provide an insight into the future.<P>
    
<STRONG>September to December
 </STRONG><P>
The continuing decrease in available floorspace in England and Wales records a slightly more modest 2% fall compared with 3% in our last survey. The total has eased to 14.263 million m<sup>2</sup> being a decrease of 309,000 m<sup>2</sup>.  <P>

Above average decreases are recorded in East Anglia, the South and North West. The Midlands are at or near the average fall while increases are recorded in the other northern regions. The South East and South West lead the way with 5% and 4% decreases followed by East Anglia down by 3% The East Midlands falls by the average 2% while the West Midlands is down by 1%. In the northern regions, only the North West records a decrease - down by 4% - while Yorks and Humberside increases by 6% and the North by 3%.<P>  

New building floorspace in England and Wales continues its downward trend with a 3% fall or 33,000 m<sup>2</sup> to 1.108 million m<sup>2</sup>. With the modest overall reduction it remains at 8% of the total. The South East and North West record the largest decreases countered by increases in the South West, Yorkshire & Humberside and the North.<P>                                                                                     
The decrease in large buildings is more of a factor in this survey with a reduction of 5% or 107,000 m<sup>2</sup> to 2.165 million m<sup>2 </sup>dropping one percentage point to 15% of the overall total.<P> 

Changes to operational requirements of occupiers may or may not result in premises becoming available on the market as demonstrated by the following examples:-<P>

With logistics needs under regular, if not continual, review the volatility of this market has a marked effect on supply and demand for facilities. Resulting from the expiry of a contract with a food retailer early in 1996, an extensive distribution centre in Corby of 23,780 m<sup>2</sup> is available at a time when the town is experiencing much activity in the property market.<P>

<STRONG><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></STRONG><P>

The focus of this document is manufacturing property, what would, in less technological times, be called factories. Over the last fifteen years the structure of the industrial property market has changed significantly. Warehouses have made all the running in property terms as the buildings became regarded as an integral part of the supply chain rather than just somewhere to store products.<P>

Factories have also changed however. The metamorphosis of the motor industry from a declining post-war liability to a modern, exporting industry is just one example of the changes that have been made across all manufacturing industry in the last decade. The impact of this is seen in the economic recovery - led by exports for the first time in twenty years.<P>

But nothing remains the same. In an increasingly global economy, even a modern manufacturing industry faces risks from low-cost producers. Manufacturing industry in the UK will need to change still further to compete as the political risk disperses in, for example, eastern Europe.<P>

Demand for industrial premises over the next ten years will be driven by the wider economy. The economic fundamentals of most relevance to property markets are inflation, interest rates and employment. This report seeks to identify the likely sources of demand for industrial property ie from which industrial sector will demand flow.<P>

The relative regional location of demand is also germane to any discussion of property supply. This report looks at the projected  output performance by planning region to identify the best spatial opportunities.<P> 
Changes in policy and legislative infrastructure will also affect both the supply of  and demand for industrial property over the next decade. This report seeks to identify the likely changes and their impact.<P>

Trafford Park was the first UK industrial estate. In its conception it set the standard for development across the country. The vision embodied in this report is to create the paradigm for industrial development over the next decade - the new industrial park.<P>

<H2>Southampton Market Summary</H2>
<ul>

The industrial market in the area has increased over the past 12 months to October 1996. Available industrial stock in Southampton and the surrounding Metropole area has almost halved over the past 18 months, providing the most stable and positive market for a decade.  As occupier activity has increased this has led to a shortage of supply, with this increase having a particular effect on second-hand space.  New market completions include the self-contained Strategic Park development in Southampton, which is a landmark scheme located close to junction 7 of the M27.<P>

The area has benefited from increased status as a distribution location, with Tesco and Christian Salvesen occupying space at Nursling of 29,700 m<sup>2</sup> and 7,000 m<sup>2</sup> respectively.  Demand for distribution units is particularly strong around Portsmouth, where 15 out of 18 units have been have been let at Admiral Park where the quoting rent is £59 per m<sup>2</sup>.  <P>

The growth of Southampton docks has been instrumental in strengthening the distribution market and there is demand for speculative development, although a lack of suitable sites to fulfil this.  Principal sites currently available for new industrial and distribution schemes in the area include Test Valley Business Park, Southern Cross Distribution Park, Adananc Park, Strategic Park, Kites Croft and Southampton Industrial Park.<P>  

The volume of new space in the three major commercial centres in the area,  Southampton, Bournemouth and Portsmouth, in the planning pipeline is 75,963 m<sup>2</sup>.  Quality of stock is a significant issue, with a large volume of secondary stock remaining on the market.<P>

Interest from institutional investors remains high, especially for prime property.  There has also been an increase in private investment activity, which has improved deals at the lower end of the market.<P>

Availability of retail stock has remained high in secondary town centres, and demand for space on out of town schemes and for retail warehousing has remained strong.<P>

Southampton city centre, by comparison, has suffered at the hands of the successful Hedge End out of town retail scheme, but will benefit from Imrys proposed shopping centre at West Quay.  Phase Ia, comprising retail warehousing and restaurants is complete andfully let, to tenants including Staples, Childrens World and TGI Friday.  Phase II of The Esplanade has now received outline planning consent and John Lewis has been confirmed as the anchor tenant.<P>

<H2>Roads to ruin</H2>
Six years ago the Government white paper "Roads to Prosperity" outlined a £20 billion roads programme. At the end of 1994, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution recommended that the Government halve the roads programme and double the real price of fuel over a decade. At the time Ministers criticised this as unrealistic.<P>

The Budget of 1995 signalled a final goodbye to the ambitions of 1989 and accepted tacitly the Royal Commission's niggardly thesis that the problem of congestion would solve itself. 77 motorway and trunk road schemes were axed and the duty on unleaded petrol went up over 11%.<P>

The long-term impact of this change on the property industry could be significant. Urban congestion has been highlighted as an important consideration in relocation studies for many years and  motorway congestion has a dramatic effect upon the flow of goods around the country. The growth of out-of-centre retail facilities is one manifestation of the car culture.<P>

The practical effect of this about turn in policy is that congestion will increase for the foreseeable future. Currently road traffic is growing at a rate of 3% a year. The Department of Transports' own projections show a doubling by 2025.<P>
A study by the Transport Research Laboratory of five cities found that even if fuel costs were raised by 50%, there would only be a 3-4% reduction in congestion as a result. Yet the Government acknowledges the role of road building in the economy. To quote "Managing the Trunk Road Programme" - published to explain the cuts - <I>"An efficient transport infrastructure is essential to national competitiveness. The roads network is at the heart of our infrastructure."</I><P>

In addition to the 77 schemes  withdrawn a further 25 were transferred to the private finance list including improvements to the A13 in East London, the A21 and A27 in Kent and Sussex, the A303 in Wiltshire, the Salisbury by-pass. Further north, improvements to the A43 at Silverstone, the A6 at Rushden, the Gargrave bypass and the A650 at Bingley also fall into this category. 178 schemes are transferred to a new longer-term list. <P>

Of the 104 schemes remaining on the main programme, 42 have been identified as likely to be put on hold. The decimation of the roads programme will have a marked spatial impact. The table shows the casualties.<P>

<H2>The Cardiff Property Markets</H2><P>
<ul>
When examining potential investment in anything it is always a good idea to have a feel for the quantum - the relative size and importance of the medium.  Department of the Environment figures reveal that Cardiff has a property market of some 2.7 million square metres split along the lines of chart 1.  The industrial property sector, comprising factories and warehouses, provides the majority of the built stock with distribution warehousing the largest single sub-sector.<P>

<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="/images/card1.gif"></CENTER><P>

The relative importance of Cardiff of course varies from sector to sector.  As far as industrials are concerned the city has the same stock as say Newcastle or Warrington but is much much smaller than the industrial centres of the Midlands and North, Leeds and Birmingham for example.<P>

As far as the office sector is concerned, Cardiff compares with regional centres of the size of Newcastle or Sheffield but is smaller than Bristol and half the size of Leeds or Birmingham. The City of London is over six times larger.  In the retail sector, Cardiff is by far the largest centre in Wales but still has substantially less retail stock than Bristol and a third of that in London's West End.<P>

Projections of relative rates of growth however put Cardiff in the top quartile for growth in output and employment.<P>

So then, in the firmament of investment Cardiff is an important regional centre, but also one with a dynamic local economy and a property market with enormous potential as we shall see.  <P>

<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="/images/card2.gif"></CENTER><P>

Looking at the dynamics of the local economy in Chart 2, we can see that by comparison with a range of cities across Europe Cardiff has above average employment in market and "other" services, about average in Financial Services and Distribution (remember this includes retailing) and below average in manufacturing and Communications.<P>

This has implications for the property markets that house these employees now and in the future.<P>
<br>
</UL>
<H4>Historical perspective</H4>
<UL>
To understand the current property markets one has to look at changes that have happened over time.  Over the last fifteen years there have been enormous changes to the economy of Cardiff and to the property markets.  The genesis of Cardiff Bay and the massive infrastructure changes that it entails; the move of industry away from the city to peripheral industrial parks and the development of new retail centres.<P>

The IPD key centres data, based upon real property performance in properties held by investing institutions allows us to look back at Cardiff over those fifteen years. Chart 3 shows relatively slow, but steady growth in rental values in the early eighties, rapid increases in the boom of the late eighties, decline in the early nineties, stabilising by 1995.  The chart also shows the extent to which retail rents rose relative to the other sectors. In 1986 cumulative growth was virtually identical between property types in Cardiff, by 1996 there is a 40 point spread between them.<P>

<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="/images/card3.gif"></CENTER><P>

 A look at a yield profile over the same period for the three sectors shows industrials in double figures for much of the eighties but falling substantially from that level in the nineties.  By comparison offices started the eighties below 7%, and, although back from the heights of the early nineties now stand at over 10%.  Much less volatility in the retail sector with yields at the end of 1995 within an ace of what they were in December 1981.<P>

<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="/images/card4.gif"></CENTER><P>
<br>
</UL>
<H4>Current markets</H4>
<UL>
Bringing the microscope down further we can examine the state of the individual sub-sectors of the property market and undertake a SWOT analysis of them to guide investment.<P>

At the end of 1995 around 111,500m<sup>2</sup> of office property was available in Cardiff, compared with take up in 1995 of some 22,000m<sup>2</sup>. This gives a high vacancy rate of 17% and shows that at current rates there is over 5 years supply available.  This analysis is a little simplistic however since there is agreement that there is actually very little quality space available, particularly in the City centre, and no suitable headquarters buildings.  Indeed by excluding anything but quality space from the equation brings the figure rapidly to a quality vacancy rate of 7% with around two years supply available. A scenario of famine rather than feast.<P>

<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="/images/card5.gif"></CENTER><P>

Comparing the city with the rest of the UK in terms of rents shows Cardiff in a favourable light. Using a list of centres where King Sturge & Co have offices, at around £150 per square metre only the great metropoli of Swindon and Exeter come in more cheaply. Rents are 25% less than Birmingham or Manchester and much much cheaper than the City of London.<P>

<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="/images/card6.gif"></CENTER><P>

So what of the SWOT analysis.  The strengths of the Cardiff office market lie firstly in the fact that demand remains strong for quality space, the same space that is in short supply, an important prerequisite for investment in property. Secondly however the potential of the City for redevelopment is almost without compare in the UK.<P>

On the downside, the quality of the City centre office stock must be accounted a weakness, as must the non-availability of landmark buildings - a serious shortcoming in a capital city I suggest.
Opportunities for the office market come from three sources:<P>

<UL>
<LI>From occupiers relocating from elsewhere in the UK
<LI>From inward investors - a breed well known in Wales
<LI>From indigenous growth

</UL><P>
The motive forces for relocation are cost related, but increasingly brought about by the popularity of techniques such as Business Process Re-engineering and the locational independence of the information workers that form the majority of the workforce.  <P>

It is a mistake to think of inward investment as being past its peak.  The UK in general remains an enormously attractive European base for the "Tiger" economies particularly. Japan's problems over the last year with the strength of the Yen has set in train a further wave of overseas investment and we have a window of opportunity to attract that investment.  Our competitors in this respect are not the mature economies of the European Union - the UK is much cheaper than them - but the emerging economies of the former eastern block and China.  China has the potential to absorb the entire world stock of overseas investment many times over, all the while political risk remains potent, as demonstrated by the latest spat over Taiwan, the UK and Cardiff remain strong competitors for these funds.<P>

Indigenous growth in the local economy remains the biggest opportunity for Cardiff.  Both relocation and Inward Investment are essentially outside our control, they tend to be driven by world-wide trends over which we have little or no influence.  Indigenous growth on the other hand is within the control of the current occupiers, workforce and investors creating a climate in which investment shows a decent return.<P>

The ever present threat is competition.  Cardiff competes not only within the UK for occupiers, but on a European and world stage.  To succeed it must remain competitive, not only in terms of property cost but labour cost and productivity also.<P>

Industrial property is of much less importance to Cardiff than it used to be, but remains nevertheless a key part of the economy.<P>

Industrial availability stood at some 140,000m<sup>2 </sup>at the end of 1995 compared with take-up of 50,000m<sup>2</sup> in 1995.  A vacancy rate of 10% and 3 years supply available.  These figure demonstrate a much healthier market and it is already clear that there are shortages of both industrial land and quality industrial buildings in Cardiff, particularly those over say 5,000m<sup>2</sup>.  <P>

<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="/images/card7.gif"></CENTER><P>

Comparing rentals around the country, at around £50 per m<sup>2 </sup>Cardiff is in the bottom half of the table, but is bettered by the big industrial centres of the north. <P>

The SWOT analysis for the industrial property market looks very similar to that for offices. The strengths of the market are in its development potential although in this case this is out of the city rather than in the centre and the strong demand for quality space has been such that it has held up rents and values here.<P>

On the back of the ticket the lack of availability of larger footplate industrial buildings must be accorded a weakness as is the pressure on industrial land, particularly close to the city.<P>

Opportunities and threats are driven by the same characteristics as for office markets, but perhaps with a slightly different emphasis.  Inward investment will continue to provide opportunities for industrial investment, but relocation less so. Indigenous growth remains the most important opportunity.<P>

Cardiff is the most important retail centre in the region with a local population over 300,000 and catchment expenditure around £2 billion.  The St David's Centre is the functional heart of retailing in the City. There have been some supply side failures in the retailing sector - the Queens West centre for example and, like many other centres, in-town versus out-of-town retailing is a live issue here.<P>

Looking at a rental comparison, prime retail rents in Cardiff stand at some £1,615 per square metre Zone A, just over half that of London's West End.<P>

<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="/images/card8.gif"></CENTER><P>

The retail sector SWOT gives us the obvious strengths of the market: a large, affluent catchment area giving rise to strong demand for prime sites in and out of town.  The weaknesses must include linkages within the City centre particularly. Visitors arriving by train are greeted by the wasteland of a bus station and tertiary convenience stores with little by way of linkage to the upmarket shopping available in the City.<P> 

Availability is also a problem out of town, Cardiff is relatively under-supplied with retail park facilities.<P>

Opportunities in the Cardiff retail property market lie principally in pulling together the already top class facilities and presenting them more effectively.  The studies addressing Central Square are crucial to this process, but care should also be given to the links with the bay area and out of centre facilities.<P>

As far as threats go Cardiff will no doubt feel a ripple of two from the development of Cribbs Causeway and some types of retailer may see changes as a result of the development of new formats such as Factory Outlet shopping.<P>

In summary then the property markets of Cardiff are set fair to support the dynamic growth of the city over the next decade.  Industrial markets are perhaps the most vibrant, but are the least significant sector.  Shortage of high quality office stock is a current problem, but one that can be addressed by investment, as is the problem of retail linkages.<P>  

Relocation and Inward Investment will continue to contribute but indigenous growth will be the key, creating employment, generating output and regenerating the property stock.<P>

<H2>Paris - Offices</H2>
<ul>
Paris remains a major centre for multinational occupiers.  With 15 million m<sup>2</sup> of built office stock in the city of Paris and 40 million square metres in the Ile de France region, it remains one of the major European office centres.  However the market has been in recession for the past few years.  According to the Observatoire de lImmobilier dEnterprise dIle de France only 1.4 million square metres of office space have been started in the last six years, a nett addition to stock of only 500,000m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

There are some 1.7 million metres of office space available in the City of Paris with around 700,000m<sup>2</sup> in the central business district.  The supply of large buildings in excess of 8,000 m<sup>2</sup> has declined sharply however, reflecting occupier preferences for larger, integrated properties.<P>

Average rents in the Central Business District continued to fall in 1995, standing currently at around D1,700, representing a fall of some 30% since the peak of the market in 1992.  This situation has been compounded by the relocation of large parts of the Financial Services sector to La Defense.<P>

Take-up in 1995 is estimated at 1.5 million m<sup>2</sup>, a rising trend from 1.1 million m<sup>2</sup> in 1993 and 1.3 million m<sup>2</sup> in 1994.<P>

<STRONG> 1	Introduction</STRONG><P>
 

<IMG align=left border=1 vspace=10 hspace=15 SRC="/images/frogl.jpg" LOWSRC="/images/frogsm.jpg">In The Age of Unreason, guru Charles Handy uses a somewhat tasteless analogy to describe how people and organisations react to change. If one were to place a live frog in a saucepan of cold water, then gradually heat it,  the frog would adapt throughout the process, eventually letting itself be boiled alive. Organisations react to changes in the economic temperature in the same way, adapting pricing structures, reducing costs, raising margins and so on. The assumption is that the water will never reach boiling point.<P>

Now suppose that the water switches suddenly from cold to boiling hot - users of hotel showers will understand this - the frog jumps, you leap out of the shower and the organisation takes dramatic action to protect its position. Locational independence is that dramatic action.<P>

By locational independence I mean the ability to function efficiently independent of any particular location. In the framework of this conference it means the ability to work away from the office yet retain the links, relationships and organisation structure inherent in that office. No big deal you might say, many of us are able to work at home, dialling into the office to pick up our E-mail, download files and so on. Broadly speaking the technology to do this has been widely available for the last decade.<P>

Irrespective of our ability to achieve locational independence at this small scale, we still retain a nice warm seat in the corporate womb, we still have territorial claims on office space, we still have managerial responsibilities to exercise and political strategies to implement. In fact we are only temporarily locationally independent. In all probability this spatial relocation is not recognised officially and our contracts of employment still demand attendance between certain hours at the nuclear office.<P>

Now let us suppose that this independence is officially sanctioned, furthermore it is actively encouraged. No longer do we have our own desks, our profit centre rents desks and meeting rooms by the hour as needed. Paper files are discouraged - the majority of documents are held electronically - such as we have will be retained in our portable project filing systems, checked in and out of a central registry. Secretarial services are also handled centrally. The office is a quarter of its previous size, we work from home except for the increasingly rare face to face meetings - most are held by video.<P>

To some this sounds like utopia, to others a scene from Dantes inferno. Some may see it as science fiction, yet there is nothing there that could not be implemented today, and indeed has been by some firms. <P>

Many of the speakers today will demonstrate different aspects and aspirations of the process, but be in no doubt, locational independence is what the future of the office is all about.<P>
<br>
<STRONG>2..	Change - "May you live in boring times"</STRONG><P>

Change is happening all the time. Sometimes, change happens in a continuous, structured and relatively boring fashion. On other occasions, change is genuinely revolutionary, turning all our assumptions, expectations and horizons on their head. This is discontinuous change. <P>

The growth in importance of information is a classic example of continuous change. <P>

<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="/images/locind2.gif"></CENTER><P>

<STRONG><CENTER>Figure 1 - Information as a component of the economy</CENTER></STRONG><P>


The economic importance of information  has grown steadily since the mid-nineteenth century period of industrial expansion. Information workers  now represent by far the largest single category of employment. Information as a commodity has an interesting property - its source can be locationally independent from its use.<P>

This information worker classification is one of degree rather than job description. If we reflect upon the amount of time we as individuals spend collecting, processing and distributing information, the 45% or so attributed to the category is, if anything, an underestimate. This goes a long way towards explaining the relative importance of the subject. We have all read articles on teleworking and most of us accept that disciplines like computer programming can well be located effectively at home. In fact the principle is far more pervasive than that - any information worker  has the potential to be locationally independent.<P>

So why didn't we spot this before? After all, the majority of the technologies that facilitate locational independence have been largely in place for ten years. Instead of building millions of square feet in City centres should we not have been looking at a longer horizon?  In fact the rate of change has  wrong footed us. In this year's Reith lectures, Sir Richard Rogers referred to the fact that whilst only seventy 70-year lifespans separate us from the earliest manifestations of cities along the Euphrates, technology has speeded the rate of change dramatically. Only two lifespans separate the bicycle from the Stealth bomber, and less than one lifespan the first electronic computer and the information superhighway. <P>
<br>
<CENTER><IMG border=2 SRC="/images/locind3.gif"></CENTER><P>

<CENTER><STRONG> Figure 2 - Control innovations</STRONG></CENTER><P>



Figure 2 is drawn after a chart of control innovations constructed by Beninger (1986). Some of these represent continuous change, or have been implemented progressively to simulate this condition. Standards fall into this category as do paper money and perhaps the desktop phone. <P>



Others are clearly discontinuous - the typewriter, the telegraph and the robot for example.<P>

The discontinuous change that concerns us here is a function of two interlocking technologies.  Computing and Communications. The price of computer hardware and software has never been lower in terms of capacity and functionality. An extremely powerful computer is now within the purchasing power of most individuals, and is de rigeur for anyone with children at school.  The growth in the capacity and speed of the global telecommunications networks, and the implementation of digital communications particularly has revolutionised personal contact worldwide.<P>

Change within my own experience is perhaps instructive. When I first started working with computers in 1968 you could stand inside them, indeed one of my jobs was to ensure that chad - the holes punched from cards - was swept from the machine. I am writing this paper on a machine with 500 times more memory, which processes instructions over 1,000 times faster and which has random access storage, a novelty in 1968. When I joined the then King & Co ten years ago, there were but two IBM PC's acting as wordprocessors, we now have over 100. The pace of change is increasing.<P>

In 1927 Marconi transmitted the first transatlantic radio message from Cornwall. In 1991 John Simpson was able to broadcast live on TV news from the centre of a war zone via satellite, whilst missiles, reacting to pre-programmed information, picked off key targets. Changes to communications have changed our perceptions of distance.<P>

From my living room I can book a hotel room in Sydney, buy shares in New York or look at the latest economic data from Frankfurt or Tokyo. Global communications mean that global markets are increasingly locationally independent, as are the people that work in them. The coming together of affordable computer technology with advanced communications has  created the opportunity for discontinuous change in the way we work. This is as profound a change as the invention of the steam engine, and will have an impact of similar scale.<P>

 

It would be interesting to speculate upon the point in time at which the frog, basking in pleasantly warm water, finds it becoming uncomfortably hot. <P>

From 1985 to 1989, the water felt just right, unfortunately the gas has now been turned up and 1995 may prove less comfortable. Initially at least.....<P>

<br>
<STRONG> 3..	The status quo</STRONG><P>

Few people nowadays I suspect have a concept of their "life's work", and if they have, it has little to do with their employment. Yet despite the knock taken to our perception of security by three deep recessions in the last twenty five years, work is still an important and defining concept in our lives. A number of aspects of work are worthy of mention in this regard.<P>

The first is the workplace, since it features so heavily in our lives. After all, we probably spend a third of our lives there.  The workplace is all about territory. If an Englishman's home is his castle, his desk is a fortified outpost - his Martello Tower. It has pictures of the children, the personalised balls acquired from the corporate golf day and all the trappings of authority. The personal computer is a relatively recent intruder into this cosy scenario. At first it was resisted with might and main, but as they began to appear in the home, and began to acquire features which were actually useful, so the resistance crumbled. I would like to say that this resistance was born of the fear that the computer would undermine the walls of this castle, but it was probably more to do with status. The acceptance of the personal computer was the thin end of the wedge.<P>

The second aspect of work is the control structure that it imposes. Due largely to the way the nuclear office has grown up, control structures tend to be based upon physical presence. Traditional hierarchical structures are as much to do with location as status. Contracts of employment impose constraints of place upon employees, the workplace is clearly defined. Reward mechanisms are usually attendance rather than fee-based.  "Clocking in", "Flextime" and so on relate to physical attendance. Informal control also tends to be based on place. Meetings involve physical attendance, committees likewise.<P>
 <br>

<STRONG> <CENTER>Figure 3 - Job mobility</CENTER></STRONG><P>

It used to be true that the work was synonymous with security. A straw poll of dubious sample size within King Sturge showed that our fathers generally only had one employer in their working lives. This is much less true for my generation. The statistics here are instructive. The Labour Force Survey shows that over the ten year period from 1985 to 1994 over 26 million people changed their employer, roughly equivalent to the entire workforce. This will include people changing their jobs more than once, and some who did not change at all. Figure 3 shows the impact of the recession on mobility, in this case enforced.<P>



All these aspects of work do change. People change jobs, exchanging one territory for another. Control structures change as do the mechanisms for rewarding work. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of work to manage, and the most resistant to change is group membership.<P>

<CENTER><I>"Football isn't a matter of life and death. It is far more important than that." </I>  </CENTER><br>
	<CENTER><STRONG>Bill Shankly</STRONG> </CENTER><P>

Football may not seem to be the most obvious analogy for the workplace and I doubt somehow that even the employees of King Sturge have the fanatical devotion of some Liverpool supporters. Nevertheless the tribal aspects of the workplace are a powerful force. A force that is harnessed to drive the company forward, a force that generates ideas, enthusiasm and loyalty.
Maintaining the tribal group will be the biggest challenge facing managers in a locationally independent environment.<P>

On the subject of the status quo, let us not forget, there are a substantial number of people who are already locationally independent. British Telecom estimate that 37% of UK companies and 2.5 million employees are  are already using teleworking or planning so to do to a greater or lesser degree.<P>
<br>
<STRONG>4..	Practical implementations</STRONG><P>

Productivity gains from locational independence can be substantial. Research by consultant SW2000 has shown gains of up to 45% when compared with traditional, office based staff. Similar improvements of between 20 and 40% have been found in the US. Studies by Digital, a big user of teleworking, found that  the average office employee works 50 hours a week including travel, yet is productive for only 20. Home workers work for 45 hours a week, but 40 of these hours are productive.<P>

Staff benefits include more flexibility in the use of time, less time spent commuting, less commuting cost, convenience, efficiency and concentration.<P>

<STRONG>Example 1 - SDC, the virtual office</STRONG><P>

Software Design & Construction have been trading for ten years and have grown to be some 20 strong. They have no physical office, nor have they ever had one. The workforce is spread around the whole country. The entire staff meet face to face every three months when they arrange a two-day stay at a hotel. The workforce is highly motivated and very productive.<P>

<STRONG>Example 2 - IBM, hot desking</STRONG><P>

The 180,000 square feet IBM facility at Bedfont Lakes has an employment density equivalent to around 20 square feet per person, achieved through desk-sharing. The SMART project  (Space, MorAle & Remote Technology) has 5 or 6 people sharing one desk.<P>


<STRONG>Example 3 - British Telecom</STRONG><P>

BT initiated teleworking in 1993 with an experimental scheme to run directory enquiry services through teleworkers in Scotland. Based around Inverness, BT teleworkers provide directory assistance to the rest of the UK. The success of the Scottish scheme has encouraged BT to pursue a more formal teleworking strategy. This includes a trial with technical authors which has delivered a £221,000 benefit after only one years' operation and the creation of a group of home-based sales people within the Volume Business Sales  (VBS) division. <P>

Half the staff of the VBS division work from home, linked to a central server. Daily performance targets are supplemented by monthly team meetings which all home-workers attend. Social events for all workers are also organised centrally. This trial is already proving successful, particularly in terms of increasing out of hours cover.<P>

<STRONG>Example 4 - Burger King</STRONG><P>

Following the relocation of its offices to Uxbridge, Burger King offered its district and franchise managers the opportunity to work from home. The resulting massive drop in staff travelling time to and from client sites has already brought substantial benefits to the company, which is now considering a wider implementation of the principle.<P>

<STRONG>Example 5 - City of Los Angeles</STRONG><P>

The City of Los Angeles Telecommuting Project involved 500 workers and gave an annual cost benefit of over £5,000 per employee. The teleworkers were 12.5% more productive, additional benefits included a 30% reduction in office space, a 23% reduction in private car use, and 18% of workers involved in the trial cited teleworking as a decisive factor in remaining with the employer.<P>

<STRONG>Other examples</STRONG><P>

Cable & Wireless, 3Com, American Express, Shell, the BBC, Natwest Bank, Digital, Mercury, Xerox,  ICL, Bull, Rabobank, Winterthur Insurance, Electricite de France. All these companies are reported to be trialling or giving some or all of their staff locational independence.<P>

Although these companies may be at the cutting edge, they still represent only a tiny fraction of employers. <P>

<br>
<STRONG> 5..	Forces for reform</STRONG><P>

The status quo is facing an increasingly loud clamour of voices in support of change. <P>

It could be argued that conferences like this themselves add to that momentum, particularly as this is the fourth such agenda this year to my knowledge. There are however, far more powerful voices than ours.<P>

<STRONG>Employers</STRONG><P>

Cost pressure is a significant force for reform. During the recession, according to IPD, office rents in central London fell by some 35%. The market had overheated dramatically in the late eighties with prime rents reaching £70 per square foot. With an average City worker occupying 70 of those precious square feet the total accommodation costs per employee at the peak of the market were around £10,000 per head. As an expensive asset, office utilisation rates are very low. A report from the South Bank Business School shows that office buildings are grossly inefficient in use, being occupied the equivalent of only 76 out of 365 days a year. After stripping out absence through sickness, holidays and meal breaks, most companies only use their offices only 10% of the available time. At the peak of the market an effective rent of £700 per square foot!<P>

<STRONG>Trades Unions</STRONG><P>

Trades Unions may also prove to be effective forces for reform. The Signalman's strike last year has been instrumental in giving many employers and employees the opportunity to road test locational independence. Many liked what they saw.<P>

<STRONG>Government</STRONG><P>

The DTI, having commissioned their own survey into teleworking, recognise the potential changes in structure required, and are busy restructuring themselves to give advice locally through the Business Links initiative. A special interest group has also been established by the Department  to give the issue focus. The Employment Department have also undertaken a survey and are making encouraging noises (without committing any expenditure of course)<P>

This is, after all, a forward looking forum. It seems appropriate therefore, without wishing to bring politics into property, to point out that the Labour Party are committed to a national information grid, along the lines proposed in the USA. The commission set up last year is about to report.<P>

<STRONG>Local Government</STRONG>

The concept of teleworking is central to the attractions on offer from many Local Authorities, especially the more remote ones. Grampian Regional Council together with Moray District Council, for example, are backing a teleworking scheme giving tax advice which is predicted to bring 150 new jobs to Grampian. Highlands & Islands Enterprise is funding telecottages throughout its area of operation as is Gwynnedd County Council.<P>

<STRONG>Environmentalists</STRONG><P>

It  would be easy to dismiss green pressure, but car commuters are estimated to burn over 30 million gallons of fuel per workday. A 10% increase in teleworkers could cut exhaust emissions substantially. Whilst telecommunications costs will fall over the next decade, the costs of running a car are expected to rise significantly.<P>

The use of public transport falls less neatly into this category as London Underground and British Rail might not be everyone's choice as reformers. The search for ever greater productivity means that employers need happier, healthier, more relaxed and more effective employees. Exactly the benefits identified in the many teleworking studies. It doesn't take a genius to notice that daily battle with the commuter services create a tetchy, stressed-out, less effective employee.<P>

<STRONG>Employees</STRONG>

Employee pressure for homeworking has been largely confined to particular groups or sections of the workforce. Benefits of flexibility of hours and less time spent travelling are particularly attractive to working mothers for example. Research from the Henley Centre found that 52% of employees would work from home if they were given the opportunity.<P>

<STRONG> 6.	Stumbling blocks</STRONG><P>

So what are the potholes in this road to a new Jerusalem? It would after all be the first time in history if discontinuous change took place with no dissenting voices.<P>

<STRONG>Employers</STRONG><P>

<CENTER><I>"It is an injustice, a grave evil and a disturbance of right order for a large and higher organisation to arrogate to itself functions which can performed efficiently by smaller and lower bodies." </I></CENTER><br>
	<CENTER><STRONG>Pope Leo XIII</STRONG></CENTER><P>
Employers will be against it, fearing a loss of control and just knowing that the cost savings have been overstated. Certainly for the most part existing control structures are inadequate to support locational independence - equally they are probably inadequate to optimise the use of a productive and thriving workforce anyway. In The age of unreason, Charles Handy urges greater subsidiarity in a "federal" company, where each unit/cost centre/profit centre has complete responsibility for their own universe within the corporate framework. This philosophy of subsidiarity is anaethma to most centralised control systems because it requires the centre not only to devolve power but want to do so. <P>

Once employers start to trust employees with the exercise of power, locational independence becomes a real starter, but other issues will be raised. What about the contract of employment? Insurance? Expenses? Liability? Quality control? All these questions ask searching questions of the employer/employee relationship. In many cases I have no doubt the answer will be a commercial contract rather than a contract of employment, and a move from time-based remuneration to fee-based.<P>

The federal organisation also brings ownership into sharp relief. Why should a Chartered Surveying company own publishing expertise? or human resources expertise? or agency  expertise? Would it not be more effective and productive to exercise control through commercial contracts using a small core staff and external specialists? <P>
I am not optimistic that employers will embrace these philosophies with open arms. I suspect they will do what they always do in my experience - adopt a low profile and wait for the storm to pass.<P>

<STRONG>Trades Unions</STRONG><P>

When they put their heads beneath the parapet they will find the Trades Unions already there. As Tony Blair is finding out, Unions are bastions of traditionalism. The workplace gives focus to the Union, any reduction in the standing of the workplace implies a reduction in solidarity, and in Union effectiveness. Quite rightly they are concerned about issues such as Health and Safety when applied to the home office, but they also see that their traditional responses to problems require a radical rethink.  It may be difficult to picket peoples living rooms.<P>

<STRONG>Government</STRONG><P>

The Government are placed firmly in the anti-lobby by default. Not that it is an issue with any political profile. A far-sighted Government would perhaps be looking at legislation to facilitate more flexible workplaces, to ensure that the locationally independent do not become the economically disadvantaged, to clarify the issues surrounding the home office and invest to ensure a workforce educated to a higher standard than our potential competitors.
Instead we have one that seems obsessed with issues like whether or not the Queen's head will appear on a currency that in any event we are unlikely to use for the foreseeable future. <P> 

I suggest that a more pointed response will occur when the realisation hits home in the Treasury that the changes may well result in falling income from rates. 

Locational independence, like markets, respects no national boundaries. In a locationally independent world the work will go  to those best qualified to undertake it cost-effectively, wherever they may live.<P>

<STRONG>Local Government</STRONG><P>

Local Government typically has yet to adapt to changes in the economic structure that occurred twenty years ago. I find it hard to credit that planning officers will be able to accept that those manufacturing jobs are not going to return and make allowance for a devolving service-led local economy, since this will entail almost total flexibility between uses. <P>

<STRONG>Environmentalists</STRONG><P>

The 1994 Royal Commission report on transport and the environment gave the potential of teleworking as an environmental solution to congestion and pollution very short shrift. An unfortunate lapse in an otherwise thoughtful document. It is sad that many of the campaigning environmental organisations have a reputation as being anti-growth. This devalues their contribution to the debate.<P>

<STRONG>Employees</STRONG><P>

And the employees? Locational independence won't suit everyone. For some the strictures of the nuclear office are a necessary discipline. Working at home probably requires more self discipline than within the clearly defined rules and regulations inherent in the formal structure. It also requires a conducive environment. The idyll of the telecottage surrounded by rolling hills may wane if the office doubles as a working kitchen for example. Here we have the post-nuclear office meeting the nuclear family. The results could be messy! <P>

Surveys from Analytica, with a fairly rigorous definition of homeworking, show that 5% of the working population work from home at least part-time, that leaves 95% that don't.<P>



<STRONG>7..	The office of the future</STRONG><P>

So how will locational independence shape the office of the future? The concept of the office as a working club is perhaps the best paradigm to describe it. It is clear from the strength of the opposition that teleworking cannot work for everyone. It is also clear that continuing to occupy an expensive central office facility, will not be an option for a company seeking to compete globally. The working club would provide a suitable half-way house between these two extremes. It would probably work thus:<P>

Instead of one central office, the federal organisation will split its accommodation into local units to support each workgroup. Each of these units would be connected to the group network, would offer a full range of specialist services including meeting rooms, conventional offices and support services and would be managed by a small core staff. The workgroup members, would work either from home or booking space at the working club as needed. Project meetings, social events and formal group communications would use the working club as a base.<P>

Unit sizes will get smaller as the function changes from housing staff to bringing them together. Internal layouts will change from large open-plan space to more discrete rooms. The space available will be mixed - some  permanent desks, some short-stay desks, some communal space,  some meeting space. The "trading floor" will seem hopelessly fin de siecle in very few years time. Equivalent employment densities are projected to fall dramatically, cutting the overall volume of space required.<P>

Many working clubs will be project based with implications for lease length. In the same way as distribution contracts are increasingly the main determinant in warehouse lease length, project length will govern the lease taken for office space.<P>

Together with the changes in the office will come changes in the surrounding environment. Sir Richard Rogers forsees the rebirth of the villages that make up cities like Birmingham and London with a significant regrowth of residential uses. This concept is reinforced by planning guidance such as PPG13. More conventional villages, used to being dormitories for other centres,  may well see the sight of work returning to them instead of workers as local offices and business centres become in demand as working clubs.<P>


 Will it happen? I have demonstrated that its compass runs to the majority of the workforce. Examples have shown that it can give clear productivity advantages to the employer and benefits of flexibility to the employee, but I have also highlighted the reactionary forces arraigned against change. I must say that I am fearful that the Luddites will delay change sufficiently to see the UK's information jobs out of the door, before succumbing. The DTI's own report upon teleworking gives some ominous warnings:<P>

UK/Europe are losing the 'balance of trade' in telework and teletrade. The USA dominates world activity in open electronic networking and in 'information trade' and is well placed to dominate 'high value' telework and teletrade. 'Lower value' telework and teletrade will gravitate to find the right combination of education, skills, business acumen and costs - anywhere in the world. The UK is well placed to lead Europe and secure a strong position in global markets - if we get it right.  But if we get it wrong . . . . remember what happened to heavy industry.<P>

I am also mindful of a friend of my age who works in a senior position in an insurance company. He is perfectly well aware of the changes, and their benefits, but he also realises that it needs his consent to proceed properly. "it won't work in this office for ten years" he told me "I will see to that"<P>
 

Many entrenched attitudes need to change, but if we are to grasp this opportunity the change must be of our own volition. The frog must jump to survive. Now, do you want to stay in that nice warm water just a little longer?<P>

The North is also down by an above average 5%.<P>The North West increases by just 1%, while Yorkshire and Humberside is down by 1%. Available floorspace on the market, in completed new buildings in England and Wales remains static at 1.039 million sq m, representing 8% of the total figure. The overall total disguises an increase in available new property in the South East against decreases in the North West, East Midlands and East Anglia.<P>The reduction of 9% (220,000 sq m) in the large building (over 10,000 sq m) category to 2.225 million sq m represents over half the overall decrease. Large buildings now account for 16% of the overall total.<P></UL><BR><H4>Metric Adjustment</H4><UL>As the final stage in the conversion from imperial to metric measurement, the current survey shows more appropriate floorspace size bands. The base figure for inclusion is now 500 sq m (previously 5,000 sq ft or 465 sq m) and the definition for large buildings is 10,000 sq m (previously 100,000 sq ft or 9,290 sq m). For this transitional edition of the survey, there is a slight distortion in the recorded reductions overall and in the large buildings category.<P></UL><BR><H4>Market Aspects</H4><UL>King Sturge & Co with 13 regional offices in England and Wales reports evidence of properties that have been on the market for some time now finding occupiers. In Sunbury-on-Thames American computer chip manufacturer Kingston Technology Corporation have leased a 3,786 sq m high office content office/industrial warehouse building. The deal was struck in the face of interest from a major Japanese company, keen to take the long vacant building.<P>The development sector is also finding a role, in some cases where property has been hard to sell. In Croydon, the 6,783 sq m former BT depot was acquired at auction by a developer and subsequently sold to Direct Line Insurance who found the large secure yard particularly suitable for an accident repair centre. In St Albans, Herts, the twenty five year old former Polaroid building is being upgraded by a property company to provide 4,850 sq m of improved floorspace.<P></UL><BR><H4>SOUTH EAST</H4><UL>The South East region records a fall of 4% in the amount of industrial and warehouse property available on the market, representing a decrease of 168,000 sq m to a total of 4,475 sq m. Two thirds of these properties are in the Home Counties, known as the Rest of the South East (ROSE) sub-region. Greater London, comprising the London boroughs shows the greater percentage reduction at 8%, being a fall of 138,000 sq m to 1.565 million sq m.<P>New buildings reverse their downward movement by rising 16% or 49,000 sq m to 365,000 sq m, up one point to 8% of the regions total.<P>King Sturge & Co reiterate the 1990s need to attract industry to Greater London as well as other parts of the country and report that a self contained building of 3,577 sq m located a short distance from the A40 Western Avenue in Park Royal is nearing completion, being sited in one of the three locations in the capitol having DTI Immediate Assisted Area Status. At the southern end of the M1 motorway, a number of particularly large speculative distribution centres are available. The Apex, a 15,584 sq m development has been carried out at Milton Keynes, while at Hemel Hempstead, Herts, a short distance from Junction 8, an even larger unit of 21,924 sq m forms part of the Hemel Distribution Centre. The nearby Chevron scheme adding a further 5,354 sq m of new space contributes to Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshires total of almost 50% of the new space available in the ROSE region.<P>The large buildings category shows a nominal increase of just 1%, adding a net 7,000 sq m to produce a total of 678,000 sq m representing 16% of the regions overall reduced figure.<P><BR></UL><BR><CENTER><H4>OTHER REGIONS</H4></CENTER>	<BR><H4>SOUTH WEST</H4><UL>A decrease of 5% continues a steady downward movement in this region, observed in recent surveys. A reduction of 49,000 sq m produces a total of 921,000 sq m. The new buildings total is static at 95,000 sq m, being 10% of the overall total and large buildings show a nominal 1% decrease of 2,000 sq m net to 123,000 sq m, following the substantial decrease of the last survey.<P></UL><BR><H4>EAST ANGLIA</H4><UL>East Anglia joins the ranks of the regions with more significant decreases by falling 5% or 24,000 sq m to 505,000 sq m.<P>The previously-used, under 10,000 sq m category accounts for the majority of the decrease. New floorspace falls by 10,000 sq m to 30,000 sq m equating to 6% of the regions overall total. Large buildings increase by 8% from 62,000 sq m to 67,000 sq m accounting for 13% of the regions total.<P></UL><BR><H4>WALES</H4><UL>The principality has scored a major coup in attracting the South Korean Lucky Goldstar electronics giant to the impressive Celtic Lakes scheme on the western side of Newport. The purpose built complex will provide two plants, totalling 306,570 sq m with the first facility due on stream next summer and the second by 1999.<P>Unaffected by this major development, the overall floorspace falls by 4% or 41,000 sq m to 868,000 sq m.<P>New buildings available decrease by 5% to 7,000 sq m to 145,000 sq m continuing at 17% of the overall stock. Large buildings decrease by 18% or 24,000 sq m to 110,000 sq m, dropping 2% to 13% of the overall total.<P></UL><BR><H4>EAST MIDLANDS</H4><UL>Available floorspace in the region decreases by 3% or 36,000 sq m to 1.142 million sq m. This reduction is due to decreases in the previously-used 10,000 sq m category and new buildings.<P>New buildings decrease by 18,000 sq m to 38,000 sq m and now stands at a very low 3% of the regions available stock. Floorspace in large buildings continues to record an increase. On this occasion, 34% or 29,000 sq m to 115,000 sq m. A manufacturing plant of 23,411 sq m at Lincoln coming on the market dramatically affects the figures.<P></UL><BR><H4>WEST MIDLANDS</H4><UL>A decrease of 4% or 66,000 sq m produces a total of 1.804 million sq m contributed solely by the large building category.<P>Large buildings in the region show a substantial fall of 40% or 116,000 sq m to 171,000 sq m representing just 9% of the overall stock.<P>King Sturge report that in a number of instances, large properties are being demolished for re-development rather than re-occupation. New floorspace increases by 1% or 10,000 sq m to 142,000 sq m remaining at 8% of the regions total.<P></UL><BR><H4>NORTH WEST</H4><UL>This region continues to produce a rollercoaster line graph with a sharp cutback in the rate of increase observed in the last survey. A 1% or 15,000 sq m increase produces 1.759 million sq m. New buildings decrease by 13% or 14,000 sq m to 98,000 sq m, remaining at 6% of the stock. Large buildings more than reverse the rise recorded four months ago, by decreasing 22% or 115,000 sq m to 411,000 sq m.<P>On Merseyside, the 51,000 sq m John Dickinson Stationary complex in Knowsley has been sold to a private developer, who has let over three-quarters of the floorspace to a distribution company. The Bryant & May factory of 27,870 sq m on 14.6 hectares in Speke has been bought by English Partnerships for possible refurbishment or re-developed for housing.<P></UL><BR><H4>YORKSHIRE AND HUMBERSIDE</H4><UL>The region records a small reduction of 1% or 19,000 sq m in available floorspace producing a total of 1.442 million sq m. The decrease is primarily in the previously-used under 10,000 sq m category.<P>New buildings decrease by a modest 2% or 2,000 sq m to 82,000 sq m remaining at 6% of the overall total. Large buildings increase by 3% or 10,000 sq m to 293,000 sq m equating to 20% of the overall total.<P></UL><BR><H4>NORTH REGION</H4><UL>An above average 5% decrease recorded in this region, representing a reduction of 36,000 sq m to a new total of 705,000 sq m. New floorspace increases by a modest 2% or 1,000 sq m to 44,000 sq m remaining at 6% of the overall total.<P>Large buildings return to the downward movement, showing a reduction of 5% or 14,000 sq m to 257,000 sq m representing 36% of the overall total.<P></UL><BR><H4>DEMAND</H4><UL>The King Sturge & Co Volume of Outstanding Demand indicator takes into account the aggregate volume of serious enquiries received by the various offices of King Sturge & Co and the rate at which these needs are satisfied.<P>In terms of floorspace volume of enquiries, demand for premises remains above 6 million sq m continuing the trend observed earlier in the year.<P>King Sturge & Co report that the demand level is similar to that recorded twelve months ago, improving on the 1995 level and 50% more than recorded three years ago.<P></UL><BR><H4>THE SURVEY</H4><UL>The King Sturge & Co Industrial Floorspace survey is conducted three times a year in April, August and December. The survey covers industrial and warehouse buildings on the market in England and Wales over 500 sq m in area and excludes properties being marketed at or near site value, recognising that the property no longer has an economic life. Derelict property and that unsuitable for refurbishment is also excluded.<P></ul></BLOCKQUOTE><P><br><br><HR SIZE=1><A HREF="http://www.estatestoday.co.uk"><IMG align=right border=0 SRC="/images/header2.gif"></A><a href="mailto:sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk">sitemaster@kingsturge.co.uk</a><br><a href="http://www.kingsturge.co.uk/docs/kscopy.htm">Copyright &copy 1996 King Sturge & Co.</a><HR SIZE=1></BODY></HTML>

<H2>The City of London Office Market</H2>
<ul>
Availability in the City market stood at some 390,000m<sup>2 </sup>at the end of 1995, down from <br>510,000m<sup>2 </sup>at the end of 1994. Available new space has fallen by 10% since December 1994, from 230,000m<sup>2 </sup> to 210,000m<sup>2</sup>.  The vacancy rate at the end of 1995 stood at just over 8% down around 2% on the year.  In the central core, focussed on Bank, the rate is 7%, down 2.3% on the year.  Short term there are growing problems in the market with respect to the availability of high quality large footplate buildings, there are only four buildings in the market capable of providing 10,000m<sup>2</sup> for example.<P>

Take-up in 1995 totalled some 400,000m<sup>2</sup>. In the core area, take up was 270,000m<sup>2</sup> of this total. Major deals in the last quarter included 9,000m<sup>2</sup> to the West Deutsche Landesbank whilst their new HQ is constructed in Old Broad Street and Nissho Iwai Europe taking 5,000m<sup>2</sup> for owner occupation.<P>

Prime rental values in the core area increased by nearly 7% in 1995 with incentives beginning to decline in significance. The development  of Winchester House by Wates and Morgan Grenfell will create a single building of 30,000m<sup>2</sup>, with three trading floors, which is expected to be completed by early 1998.  The rent to be paid by Deutsche Bank, which has signed a 25-year lease for the building, is at a level of between £430 and £450 per m<sup>2</sup>, presaging a significant movement in the level of prime rents over the next two years<P>

In the development pipeline, space under construction stood at 220,000m<sup>2</sup> at the end of 1995 in 20 schemes.  In total the pipeline contains over 2.4 million m<sup>2</sup> of permissions, 1.7 million m<sup>2</sup> of which are in the core area.<P>

A survey of overseas banking presence in London, by management consultants Noel Alexander, shows that the number of foreign banks in London increased by twenty in 1995 and now stands at 541.  This is of great significance for the future of the City office market and reflects the maintenance of international confidence in the status of the City as the leading financial centre in Europe.<P>

<H2>Berlin - Offices</H2>
<ul>
The recovery in Germany was not of sufficient magnitude or duration to benefit the property sector. Office rental levels in all the major German cities, including Berlin, fell slightly in 1995.

The office market in Berlin is development led. During the next three years the development pipeline will add some 600,000m<sup>2</sup> of office space per annum to existing stock.  The Daimler Benz complex alone provides some 350,000m<sup>2</sup> of offices, hotel and entertainment.<P>

Take up of offices in Berlin during 1995 is estimated to have been around 470,000m<sup>2</sup>.  The move of the German Government to Berlin in 1998 is continuing to drive expectations of future demand although the direct requirements have been satisfied. Commentators expect that some 30% of second tier organisations will have signed for space by the end of 1996.<P>

Office rents in Berlin have fallen 50% from their peak in 1992, when they touched DM100 per m<sup>2</sup> per month, and the oversupply in the market will take a long time to reverse in secondary locations.  ypical rents in the Unter den Linden/Friedrichstrasse area stand at around DM40 per m<sup>2</sup> per month although small units in first class buildings can reach DM60.  In the Kurfurstendamm, the cities second office centre, rents stand at around DM35.<P>

<ul>
The Exeter office market has a stock of some 260,000m<sup>2</sup> in qualities ranging from modern, custom-built premises to period buildings. Currently there is around 43,500m<sup>2</sup> of space available in the City, 29,500m<sup>2</sup> in the centre and 14,000m<sup>2</sup> out of town, a vacancy rate overall of just under 17%.  Over the last two years take up has averaged around 16,250m<sup>2</sup> per annum. In 1995 roughly two thirds of take-up was in the City Centre.  Overall there is between two and three years supply currently vacant in the city.  Prime rental values for offices in and out of town stand at £107.50 per square metre, whilst prime serviced office land is at about £750,000 per hectare.<P>

Industrial demand in 1995 was just under 19,500m<sup>2</sup>, roughly the same as in 1994.  The supply of available industrial property has however grown to an estimated 48,000m<sup>2</sup>.  At current demand levels this would therefore equate to a supply for about two and a half years.  Prime rental values for industrial space stand at around £50 per m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

The Exeter retail market did not suffer the depradations of the recession that were seen elsewhere, with demand holding up reasonably well.  Prime High Street rentals in 1996 have been achieved at around £1,400 per m<sup>2</sup>, reinstating the levels reached at the peak of the market.<P>

<H2>Bristol</H2>
<ul>
Office take-up for the Bristol area for 1995 was approximately 51,000m<sup>2</sup> with a late flurry of transactions taking the city centre figure to around 32,500m<sup>2</sup> and 20,000m<sup>2</sup> in the principally north Bristol based out of town market.  The city centre saw a limited number of major lettings in the absence of larger scale demand from the financial services sector which has historically underpinned the Bristol market resulting in a fall in take-up of around 15% from the 1994 figure of 32,900m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

Bristol's best office building, Redcliff Quay, saw 1,858m<sup>2</sup> taken by Standard Life, 495m<sup>2</sup> by R A Watson with a further 1,950m<sup>2</sup> under offer.  Scottish Widows refurbished 1 Redcliffe Street was boosted by major lettings to Compuserve who took 1,858m<sup>2</sup> in April 1995.  A feature of the market is organisations downsizing to higher quality accommodation with existing prime office supply facing consistent demand and now down to around 11,600m<sup>2</sup> in five buildings.  This limited supply is holding prime headline rents to between 183-215m<sup>2</sup> dependent on location and quality.<P>

Three new office buildings are completing during the first six months of 1996 being Helical Bar's 1,733m<sup>2</sup> Venturers House; St James Court of 3,412m<sup>2</sup> being developed by Scottish Mutual and University Gate of 2,866m<sup>2</sup> adjacent to Bristol University.  The pre-let market also emerged with taken at 80 Victoria Street by Bristol Contributory Welfare Association at a competitive rental level of around 150 per m<sup>2 </sup>before tenant incentives.<P>

Other new developments include the 69,679m<sup>2</sup> Harbourside scheme at Canons Marsh which has seen interest from British Telecom  and Bristol & West Building Society, both for new headquarters buildings.  English Partnership have now taken over responsibility for the 102,000m<sup>2</sup> Quay Point scheme following the demise of Bristol Development Corporation.<P>

Around 61,500m<sup>2</sup> of refurbished and secondhand office accommodation is available in 31 buildings each offering a minimum of 1,000m<sup>2</sup>.  An estimated 70,000m<sup>2</sup> is expected to be placed on the market in the next two years due to the demise of Avon County Council, restructuring by British Telecom and Bristol & West and Sun Life's move to new headquarters at Bristol Parkway.  Much of this secondhand poorer quality stock is facing very limited demand and a number of buildings such as the 2,573m<sup>2</sup> Culver House in Park Street are being converted to Student accommodation with around 3,000 bedroom units still required by Bristol University and The University of the West of England.<P>

The relocation of the Ministry of Defence's Procurement Division into a new, 112,000m<sup>2</sup> office facility at Abbeywood in north Bristol will bring some 5,500 jobs to Bristol over the next five years and create additional demand from supply companies needing to be close to the MOD.  Already a number of these are looking for space ideally wanting suitable premises by September 1996 when the MOD centre becomes operational.<P>

Existing sites or developments nearby, including Bristol Business Park, where the Quartilis development currently offers four new detached office buildings from 1,000m<sup>2</sup> to 2,000m<sup>2</sup> with one building of 1,100m<sup>2</sup> acquired by National Westminster Bank, and Bristol Parkway and Gifford Court should see strong demand as a result.  Bristol Parkway attracted a pre-let of almost 1,850m<sup>2</sup> to Barclays Bank and United Friendly have taken on a 630m<sup>2</sup> building.  Early this year Sun Life will move staff from ten city centre buildings into a new headquarters building of 37,150m<sup>2</sup> on a site purchased three years ago.<P>

Other major transactions include Orange Personal Communications Services take-up of a further 2,460m<sup>2</sup> at Key Point this builidng now being fully let; a letting of 1,500m<sup>2</sup> at Quadrant, Aztec West to Regus for a serviced office facility,: Beech House at Brotherswood Court of 1,375m<sup>2</sup> to J Rothschild Assurance and a 2,800m<sup>2</sup> pre-let to Alexandra Workwear at Thornbury.  Achievable headline rentals on new buildings range from 161-194 psm dependent on location, specification and importantly, car parking provision.<P>

The MOD development and other major moves within north Bristol has raised the issue of traffic congestion.  Whilst anecdotal evidence suggests that traffic volumes are much lower in north Bristol, particularly out of University and School term times, overall the case for a Bristol light transit system, like Manchester's Metro, remains strong.<P>

<H2>CARDIFF AND THE VALE OF GLAMORGAN</H2>
<ul>
<P>
<br>
Whilst a relatively small centre of around 300,000 people, Cardiff serves a population of approximately two million in South Wales. It is also a major regional retail and leisure centre attracting visitors from outside the region. Part of the attraction of the city is the regular availability of international cultural and sporting events. As the capital of a distinct region, the city has actively promoted such amenities, being consistently voted 'Best Value City in Europe'. Its facilities are concentrated in a compact centre which historically has been relatively well planned and managed. A number of recent projects within the city centre have targeted areas for improvement and enhancement in an ongoing programme. Recent initiatives have included further partnership proposals between the public and private sector to maintain vigorous promotion of the city. <P>

The major development area in the city is the Cardiff Bay Development. This has a target area of 1,090 hectares of former docks and steelworks in the southern part of the city. The ambitious showpiece scheme is designed to expand the commercial area available in Cardiff, and to improve the environment to a level which will enable the city to compete on an equal footing with other major European cities. <P>

The high level of  activity underway in Cardiff Bay includes commercial schemes and  residential developments, leisure and recreational facilities, including two indoor tennis centres and the ongoing Inner Harbour development, which encompasses 13,940 m<SUP>2</SUP> of  leisure within an 'arc of entertainment'. The proposed Opera House development was to be located at Capital Waterside, linked directly to the city centre, although this proposal is presently on hold and awaiting progress on funding. The Techniquest Centre, opened in Cardiff Bay in May 1995, occupies a prominent waterfront position and the scheme, partly EU funded, should increase the number and diversity of visitors in the area. <P>

Infrastructure has also been improving in the region, with the Bute Link Tunnel now providing fast access to the M4 junction 33, whilst aiding Grosvenor Waterside in the regeneration of their waterfront sites. The proposed Bute Avenue is also expected to improve access from the city centre to Cardiff Pierhead. <P>
</ul>
<br>
<H3>Industrial - Issues</H3><P>

<UL>
The shift in the regional property market is evident in the industrial sector, particularly in Cardiff Bay. The decline of the coal industry and consequent impact on the port of Cardiff released huge areas of land for development. By its very nature the shipment of coal required large areas of storage and railway land in and around the docks. Other major changes brought in that immediate area were due to the closure of the East Motors Steelworks and the Rover plant at Pengam Moors.<P>

 	The loss of these major industries and other port related industry had a visible effect on  manufacturing, services and transport in the immediate area. In the short-term the comprehensive proposals for economic regeneration promoted by the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation have also had an effect on the industrial property market in the city. The strategic planning and infrastructure for Cardiff Bay effectively prevented piecemeal industrial development in that area and subsequent land assembly and construction displaced many local companies. The urban regeneration project therefore removed large areas of industrial land from the market during the recession, thereby helping to underpin the value of industrial property elsewhere in the city.<P>

 	This perceived shortage of industrial property has, in turn, encouraged investment in established estates and the development of new premises on the parameters.<P>

 	The re-use of former industrial land in the Bay area for residential, leisure and other purposes has effectively limited the available supply of industrial land. Current development activity evidences the dominance of the new industry, such as the NEG Schott venture, with some local relocation of traditional industry still taking place.<P>

 	This process is not confined to the southern part of the city. The University of Wales has, for example, expanded along redundant railway land, recently taking in the former Powell Duffryn wagon works just north of the city centre. The established industrial estates on Newport Road are now dominated by retail and leisure developments.<P>

 	Whilst provision is made for further industrial development in Cardiff this will be increasingly high-tech and service related. The real growth in the manufacturing sector projected for the region will not take place in the capital itself.<P>
</UL>
<br>
<H3>Industrial - Market Activity</H3><P>
<UL>
The Cardiff industrial market is experiencing a lack of new and modern buildings and there remains a shortage of prime space over 3,710 m<sup>2.</sup><P>

 	There have been several new occupants at Ocean Park in Cardiff, including the taking of  19,050 m<sup>2</sup>  in a joint venture between Nippon Electronic Glass and Schott Glaswerke.  The first phase of TBI's Neptune Point which is part of Ocean Park and totalling 3,580 m<sup>2</sup>,  has now been completed.<P>

 	The former Gilesports Headquarters, comprising 1680 m<sup>2</sup> of modern warehousing with high office content at Links Business Park, St. Mellons, was sold December 1995 to Vodafone Limited for a figure reported to be approximately £800,000.<P>

 	The Pentwyn Industrial Estate has been sold by the WDA to Ashtenne, forming part of a portfolio of such property for which Ashtenne paid in the region of £26 million.<P>

 	Premises at Queen Alexandra Dock, totalling 10,220 m<sup>2 </sup> was let in April 1995 to Fisher Containers and Palletes by King Sturge and Co. <P>

 	There have been 4 new lettings, each of approximately 410 m<sup>2</sup>, achieved at the Ely Distribution Centre in the last 12 months.<P>

 	At East Tyndall Street, Peacock Stores and MFI have taken warehouse space of 1,490 and 1,390 m<sup>2</sup> respectively at circa £32.30 per m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

 	The former Whitbread distribution warehouse just off Newport Road was sold to David Lloyd Leisure in early 1995. The building, which has now been converted to leisure use, extends to approximately 9,290 m<sup>2</sup>. <P>

 	At Cardiff Industrial Park, The Burton Group have taken a short-term lease on units 10a and 10b (1,115 m<sup>2</sup>) at a rental of £43 per m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

 	The former JPM premises at Hadfield Road was bought by Hodge and Co. The unit extends to approximately 4,645 m<sup>2</sup>.<P>
</UL>
<br>
<H3>Offices - Issues</H3><P>
<UL>
The office market in Cardiff can be separated into three districts, the city centre, Cardiff Bay and out of town, which focuses mainly on the Cardiff Business Park and St. Mellons. The city centre market provides the largest concentration of conventional commercial office space in South Wales and  is focused in the area of Windsor Place, Greyfriars Road, Kingsway and Newport Road.<P>

 	In common with the picture nationally, the Cardiff market has suffered from the recession, rationalisation and technological advance and more recently, mergers and acquisitions. This can be seen in the take-up figure for 1995 of just over 22,000  m<sup>2</sup>,  which is down on 1994's figure of about 23,230 m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

 	Total office availability in Cardiff represents about 35% of that for all of Wales, at 111,490 m<sup>2</sup>. Out of this total figure, the city centre accounts for 69,680 m<sup>2,</sup> Cardiff Bay 27,870 m<sup>2</sup> and the out of town business parks 13,940 m<sup>2</sup>. The vast majority of space available in the city centre is secondary  in nature and generally of a poorer quality. Now that Principality House is fully let, the only new space remaining on the market is at Landore Court, Charles Street, which provides approximately 1,500 m<sup>2</sup> of space over 3 remaining buildings. <P>

 	Cardiff Bay offers an alternative to the city centre location, with ample car parking and a regenerated waterfront environment. Links with the city centre and the M4 are improving all the time.<P>

 	In the business parks at Culverhouse Cross, Llanishen and St. Mellons, there is a  shortage of space as a result of a steady take-up in 1995 and a lack of any new development. The situation is now such that some existing requirements can not be fulfilled by the current space. Consequently it is likely that speculative development will commence during 1996 at Cardiff Gate, Ty Nant Court and other locations.  At Cardiff Gate, located at junction 30 of the M4, an office village consisting of some 6,450 m<sup>2</sup> of space is planned.<P>

 	Debate continues concerning the specification of offices in the city, and it is apparent that requirements are being driven by cost and function rather than facilities such as air conditioning and raised floors. However, where there is a high occupancy ratio, such facilities are  required.<P>

 	Cardiff is experiencing a migration to out of town space partly as a consequence of a shortage of parking in the city centre.<P>
</UL>
<br>
<H3>Offices - Market Activity</H3><P>
<UL>
The current shortage of space is being addressed in three developments, outlined below, which are underway in the city centre. <P>
<UL>
		 	Park Gate, Westgate Street. This is a development by Bamfords Trust plc, of which 4,650 m<sup>2</sup> was sold in 1995 by King Sturge & Co to the Lord Chancellors Department. This leaves 5,200 m<sup>2</sup> which will be available shortly.<P>

		 	Knox Court, Fitzalan Road. A development by NIG Sheridan, funded by Scottish Life - 5,480 m<sup>2</sup> is due for completion in March 1996. Legal and General have expressed interest in the development, although to date have still to sign an agreement.<P>

		 	No.1 The Kingsway. A development by Helical Bar plc, funded by CIS and totalling 6,920 m<sup>2</sup>.  This is due for completion in Spring 1996. The  building has the best location of the three, situated on the corner of The Kingsway and Greyfriars Road overlooking the Castle and Civic Centre. <P>
</UL>
 	The latter two developments of Knox Court and The Kingsway were forward funded a year ago as a result of the strength of the investment market at the time.<P>

 	Norwich Union have recently announced the £8 million speculative development of their own site at Park Place, which will provide in the region of 3,715 m<sup>2</sup> of office space.<P>

 	In the city centre, part of the Wales Gas Helmont House, Churchill Way which totals 8,360 m<sup>2</sup> will shortly be available together with the Chemical Bank building of approximately 5,000 m<sup>2</sup> in Fitzalan Place.<P>

 	It  is likely that the Welsh Health Common Services Authority building will be available during the course of the year as a result of ongoing privatisation. This will provide 11,610 m<sup>2</sup> of space.<P>

 	To the south of Cardiff's Central Station between 74,320 and 83,610 m<sup>2</sup> of offices are planned by the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation and Railtrack, although the scheme remains on hold until a Private Finance Initiative is found for the construction of Bute Avenue. <P>
 	Tarmac's Waterfront 2000 scheme at Atlantic Wharf is fully let and the remaining 1,670 m<sup>2</sup> of space available at Atlantic House, Tyndall Street is now let to Peacock's Stores.<P>

 	The £15 million Scott Harbour development has commenced at Capital Waterside, Cardiff Bay. This is being undertaken by Grosvenor Waterside, the property development subsidiary of Associated British Ports. When completed this development will provide office suites of varying size from 950 m<sup>2</sup> upwards, totalling  9,000 m<sup>2</sup> in five buildings. <P>

 	There remain  requirements for suites of up to 500 m<sup>2</sup> in the city centre, which will be fulfilled by existing property.<P>

 	The second hand market has become increasingly polarised, with good quality refurbished space available in the centre of Cardiff from £50 per m<sup>2</sup> .<P>

 	Out of town, rents have been maintained between £120 and £140 per m<sup>2</sup>  as a consequence of relatively healthy demand and limited supply. <P>
</ul>
<br>
<H3>Retail - Issues</H3><P>
<ul>
Cardiff has the largest population in South Wales and consequently its retail market dominates the area, with prime Zone A rents reaching £1,615 per m<sup>2</sup>. <P>

 	Queen Street and St. David's Centre remain the most sought after location, particularly for units in excess of 185 m<sup>2</sup> .<P>

 	Scottish Widows' failed shopping centre, Queens West, remains dormant despite ongoing discussions regarding its redevelopment, with 90% of its component units currently vacant. The anchor unit, formerly occupied by Curry's, remains on the market although terms are thought to have been agreed with a major national retail chain. <P>

 	Cardiff has several secondary retail locations, such as Albany Road, Crwys Road and City Road, which perform well and are popular with traders, offering potential for infill development.<P>

 	In the out of town market, future opportunities are limited because of the Government's introduction of restrictive planning guidance notes and existing local plan policies. Demand still exists in this sector and occupiers now have to consider solus infill sites and fringe of centre locations.<P>
</ul>
<br>
<H3>Retail - Market Activity</H3><P>
<ul>
We anticipate that rentals in excess of £1,700 per m<sup>2</sup> Zone A will shortly be payable for prime city centre space.<P>

 	At the Queens Arcade Shopping Centre, a number of units still remain vacant, although recent lettings have been undertaken to Next and Starlog.  Rents for the centre vary depending on location, with the upper floor proving to be more popular, achieving Zone A rental figures of £1,340 per m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

 	Planning consent has been granted to TBI for a 9,300 m<sup>2 </sup> leisure complex in Cardiff city centre at the former Prudential building, Kingsway. The scheme, due for completion in Spring 1997, includes a 12 screen multiplex cinema,  night club and themed restaurants, with the tenancies on the basis of turnover rents.<P>

 	Storehouse Properties underlet the Habitat store at Roath Coal Yard, Newport Road, to Uno Upholstery at a quoting rent of £92 per m<sup>2 </sup>in late Summer 1995.<P>

 	 Prime out of town retail rents in Cardiff now exceed £140 per m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

 	At Ferry Road, Cardiff Bay,  Wilson Bowden are due to commence work on the  planned retail park, which has consent for 27,870 m<sup>2</sup>  of mixed retail and leisure.<P>

 	The 2,790 m<sup>2</sup> Co-Operative Pioneerfood superstore  and Living store, providing 3,720 m<sup>2</sup>  of space, opened in September 1995 on the Western Avenue. This  includes a licensed restaurant, petrol filling station and travel agency. <P>

 	Adjoining the Co-Operative stores at Western Avenue,  a mixed retail and leisure scheme will accommodate Bay 6, Staples and Gala Clubs.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>Birmingham</H2>
<ul>
The West Midlands has been at the heart of the renaissance of theBritish motor industry.  As the regional capital, Birminghams future prospects are tightly bound up with those of the West Midlands, and thus on the strength of the surrounding manufacturing sector.  Birmingham is still the UKs manufacturing centre, but with Coventry, Sandwell and Wolverhampton also important in the equation the region is pre-eminent.<P>

The retail sector in Birmingham has been hyperactive for the last eighteen months, putting upward pressure on prime zone A rents which rose from £1,700 per m<sup>2</sup> at the start of 1995 to around £2,000 per m<sup>2 </sup>now.  Two major schemes have taken steps forward recently. In March permission was given for Hammerson's proposed revamp of the Bull Ring shopping area in the city centre.  In addition, Richardson Developments and Tarmac have set a completion date of spring 1997 for The Fort shopping scheme on the old Fort Dunlop site.<P> 

In the office sector 47,000m<sup>2</sup> of was taken up in 1995 - the highest total for some years. Pre-lets to Central TV, Eversheds and Lloyds Bank accounted for 42% of the total.  Vacancy rates remain at some 17% of stock and headline rents are static at around £215 per m<sup>2</sup>, although tenant incentives are declining. <P>

The supply of quality office buildings is however at a critical stage. There are no large speculative office buildings under construction, and only three available buildings.  The disposal of the 10,000m<sup>2</sup> Point North scheme in Dudley remove a large part of the available stock.  It was one of the largest office deals in the region during the past five years and was sealed with a long lease at £113 per m<sup>2</sup>.  The three headquarters buildings that are left are the 7,000 sq ft No 1 Brindleyplace, Birmingham; Telford Plaza, a 16,000m<sup>2</sup> two-block development in Telford; and 120 Edmund Street, Birmingham, which is 12,000m<sup>2</sup> to the market behind a retained facade.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>Swindon</H2>
<P>
<br>
<H3>Offices</H3><P>
<ul>
Improvement in the office market looks likely to result in a serious shortage of stock during the next year with only a one year supply of vacant premises of any quality.  Speculative schemes are expected to start but not until 1997, too late to avoid the impending shortfall.<P>

Available office space overall fell to 11% to around 92,000m<sup>2</sup> in October 1995 compared with a year earlier according to figures produced by Thamesdown Council.  Currently around 56,000m<sup>2</sup> of office space is vacant in the town centre.<P>

The only new headquarters-type building available is Maple Oak's 66,000 sq ft Quadrant in Westlea, west Swindon, which has been on the market for three years. The former 79,000 sq ft Galileo building on Swindon's top business park, St Martin Property Corporation's Windmill Hill, was taken within months of coming onto the market by AT&T at a rent structured around £118 per m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

On the demand side there is a continuous stream of enquiries for good quality out-of-town office accommodation with car parking facilities.  Virtually all the remaining space at Delta Office Park has been let and at Sun Alliance's Kembrey Park there has just been a letting of 2,800m<sup>2</sup> to Plessey Semiconductors.  And there are a further three transactions in solicitors' hands amounting to 1,500 m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

However, the council's latest business survey of Swindon's companies shows that confidence has fallen compared with 1994.  Generally, 42% expect their general business situation to improve compared with 48% the year before.  Those expecting their situation to get worse has risen from 6.7% in 1994 to 10.1% in 1995.  In the banking and insurance sector those forecasting better times have declined from 59 to 47.1%.<P>
<br>
</UL>
<H3>Retail</H3><P>
<UL>
In the past eighteen months Swindon has witnessed a substantial amount of investment in the retail sector.  Out of town, both phases of the Greenbridge Retail Park were pre-let. The first phase of 15,000m<sup>2</sup> was let at around £107 per m<sup>2</sup> and the second phase of 8,000m<sup>2</sup> saw this rise above £118 per m<sup>2</sup>.  Demand for out of town space remains strong with little supply coming on stream. <P>

The 10,000m<sup>2</sup> Great Western factory outlet centre has started construction. The 100  units have all been pre-let and will be created from the four grade two listed buildings that made up the workshops of Brunel's Great Western Railway.  
The development is expected to attract two million shoppers a year and provide stiff competition for the existing centres at Bicester and Street.  Developer BAA McArthur Glenn believes it will lure shoppers to the town from a 100mile radius and boost the town centre trade as a whole.<P>

In the town centre, Sun Alliance has completed its £4m enhancement of The Parade, providing seven new units and a kiosk ranging from 110 to 250m<sup>2</sup>.  It is fully let at rents around £1,200 zone A and its main anchor is BHS.  The largest area of investment activity has been the redevelopment of the Brunel Centre.  House of Fraser is due to start trading in September in a 12,000m<sup>2</sup> floor department store.  The refurbishments include direct pedestrian access to a new 800-space multi-storey car park and a new upper level of shopping in the Brunel Plaza.  The refurbishment will provide an additional 14 shops and rents are expected to be around £1,300 per m<sup>2</sup>.<P>
<br>
</UL>
<H3>Industrial</H3><P>
<UL>
Swindon has seen a huge growth in employment during the past 12 years, showing a 28% increase in jobs to around 88,850 in 1993.  In the UK, employment fell by 1% during the same period.  While Honda and Rover have contributed to job creation, most of the growth was accounted for by non-manufacturing activities.  In fact, total employment in manufacturing was almost static - at 19,920 in 1981 and 19,980 in 1992.  This suggests that Swindon does not rely on the motor industry for growth and job creation.<P>

More dynamic has been the rise of the computer and electronic industries, particularly allied to communications and the expansion of Swindon's indigenous industries such as Thorn CD, on Drakes Way, and Motorola.  Swindon is not only an important distribution centre, but has evolved into an influential financial and service sector hub.  Swindon's economy has continued to advance on a number of fronts, further increasing the diversity that has become its key strength.'<P>

<H5>March 1996:</H5><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>Edinburgh</H2>
<ul>
The Edinburgh retail market has been maintaining a healthy profile, in 1995 Princes Street saw rental growth of around 10%.  The latest retail news for Edinburgh is that Speciality Shops and Raglan Estates have made a planning application to add 10 shops and a cafe/restaurant to the roof of Waverley shopping centre in Princes Street, Edinburgh.<P>

The scheme would boost space at the £30m centre by almost one-third and  has been designed by Comprehensive Design of Edinburgh with Keith Scott acting as consultant. Retail warehousing continues to attract demand. Although Edinburgh still suffers from a shortage of open A1 consents - there are a number of schemes in the pipeline that should improve supply.  Funding interest in retail warehousing remains strong, and rental growth is expected to continue.<P>

Meanwhile in the office market Trafalgar House Property has secured the first letting in its 3,000m<sup>2</sup> office scheme on Castle Street, central Edinburgh. Castle International Asset Management, which was recently set up by former Dunedin Fund Management employees with the backing of PNC Bank Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has taken a 15-year lease on 400m<sup>2</sup> at £180 per m<sup>2</sup>, with a nominal rent-free period.  Generally quality stock is diminishing because of the lack of recent development. Any increase in demand will result in rental growth and an acceleration of new development activity.<P>

The distribution and warehouse market still shows a general lack of quality supply.  Most of the activity is demand-led - particularly so in the distribution sector, where Lidl, Booker, Christian Salvesen and Scottish Express have all developed or committed to large distribution warehouses along the M8 corridor.<P>

<H5>March 1996:</H5><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>GLASGOW</H2>
<ul>
One of the key dynamics of the Glasgow office market is the attraction of corporate headquarters and the provision of quality space to house them. There are several developments and sites which could offer prestigious HQ locations for firms coming into the city.<P>

At West Campbell Street on the edge of the traditional central office pitch, Princes House is a 5,000m<sup>2</sup> scheme under construction by Teesland Development. Formerly the site of Alhambra House, a 1960s-style government building, the scheme is scheduled for completion later this year.  Two locations offer the prospects of much larger schemes, both of which could provide larger floorplates than are usually found in Glasgow's central grid. Glasgow & Oriental has consent for a further 12,500m<sup>2</sup> phase of the successful Atlantic, but development is waiting on  an improvement in the market.  A couple of hundred yards away on a previously decaying site on Argyle Street, Anglo Irish Bankcorp is seeking consent for a 20,000m<sup>2</sup> scheme bounded by Robertson Street, Argyle Street and Oswald Street. <P>

Two other sites offer HQ possibilities in Glasgow. George Square, the city's civic centre, is enjoying a development renaissance and could once again become a focus for the office market.  Away from the centre, Miller Developments' Pacific Quay is keen to attract a prestigious HQ as an anchor for the office element of the scheme.<P>

Glasgow is the regional retail centre and in 1995 saw prime rental growth of around 20%.  However the development of out of centre facilities is a live issue in the city. rental growth in Argyle Street for example may be hampered by the development of Braehead and the Buchanan Galleries.  Other significant schemes are in the pipeline.  A 30-screen cinema, Costco warehouse club and more retailing could be built on part of the remaining land at The Phoenix, the 360-acre former Linwood car plant near to Glasgow Airport. Contracts have been exchanged to acquire the existing Phoenix Retail Park, which is only partly let, and plans to complete letting and to extend it to create 17,000m<sup>2</sup> of retail. Application has been made to widen the existing consent to include sports goods, office equipment, discount food retail and toys.<P> 

The site also houses substantial industrial development.  The most recent development is a 14,000m<sup>2</sup> high-bay warehouse for Chivas Glenlivet which is under construction.  <P>

<H2>The Manchester Office Market</H2>
<ul>
Manchester city centre has a multi-tiered office market.  At one level, major firms are leasing or pre-leasing top specification accommodation at headline rents of around £215 per m<sup>2</sup>.  At a second level, occupiers are taking refurbished or second-hand space at rents between £86-£96 per m<sup>2</sup> . Whilst not grabbing the news, this market actually accounts for the majority of occupier demand.  At the 'top end' of the market, the main current trend is the much heralded south-westward expansion of city's office core.  This expansion, reflects the success of new developments on Great Bridgewater Street and Deansgate in attracting large pre-lets and  raises fundamental issues for developers, occupiers and investors. <P>

More than any other regional centre, Manchester can lay claim to being the UK's most important office market outside London.  The city centre has a larger office stock than its major competitors and employs more people in the core economic activities that underpin the office market -banking, finance, insurance and professional services. <P>

Manchester's city centre office market is underpinned by the city's financial and professional services sector together with the head office functions of the region's major manufacturing enterprises. <P>

The late 1980's were a particularly important phase in the development of Manchester city centre economy and office market.  against a background of rapid UK economic growth , Manchester's financial and business companies grew rapidly and developed a greater depth and range of services to meet the requirements of the North West's expanding medium-sized enterprises.  Increasingly, these companies turned to Manchester-based firms, rather than London firms, for advice, support and capital and found that they could get the same quality of service at cheaper rates.  The result, in economic parlance, was a vigorous 'import substitution' of services that formerly could only be had in London.  When the London economy tipped into recession, Manchester's financial and business community had become increasingly self-standing and was able to ride out the recession comparatively unscathed.  <P>

It was during the late 1980's that Manchester also attracted a number of major relocations from London, most notably the British Council.<P>
 
Having weathered the recession, Manchester's financial and business community has continued to expand, reinforced by a number of significant new arrivals.  For example, Leeds-based lawyers Hammond Suddard and Dibb Lupton Broomhead both opened offices in Manchester in 1993 and the city merchant banks were swelled by the arrival in 1994 of Henry Ansbacher, Singer & Friedlander and Arbuthnot Latham, offsetting the departure of Standard Chartered.  Birmingham-based stockbroker Albert E. Sharp opened its office in Manchester in 1993.<P>


 In total around 44,000m<sup>2</sup> of office accommodation was let in Manchester city centre during 1995 compared with about 50,000m<sup>2</sup> in 1994.  The lower level of take-up recorded last year  primarily reflects the conclusion of three large pre-lets at AMEC's Great Bridgewater Street development in December 1994.<P>

These three pre-lets, to Price Waterhouse, Ernst & Young, Addleshaws Sons & Latham, confirmed the extension of the core office area.  Since these deals were signed the largest  occupier transactions concluded in Manchester city centre have all involved existing city core occupiers pre-leasing space in new developments to the south and west of the established core.  Following the original 'consortium' of three, Dibb Lupton Broomhead signed for close to  17,000 m<sup>2</sup>. On Deansgate, Touche Ross has agreed to take 3,716 m<sup>2</sup> at Chestergate Seldon's 201 Deansgate.<P>

In each of these relocations the desire to consolidate offices into a single building with large floorplates has been a major driving factor.  In each case the companies concerned are consolidating their Manchester premises from two or three existing buildings and swapping small existing floorplates (typically from around 300 m<sup>2</sup>) for larger, more efficient, sizes of 1,150 m<sup>2</sup> and over.  The new premises will provide improved on-site car parking and Great Bridgewater Street in particular is close to public car parking and the new International Concert Hall.  <P>

These major relocations will have a significant impact on Manchester's city centre market.  Most obviously they extend the boundaries of Manchester traditional main office and raise the office market profile of the Great Bridgewater area, hitherto a secondary location.  In addition, they provide potential redevelopment/refurbishment opportunities, notably where whole buildings are being vacated, namely York House, Commercial House and Lawrie House.  This could result in more supply becoming available and may exert downward pressure on rents.<P>

In addition the success of Great Bridgewater raises the question of whether other currently secondary locations are likely to see a comparable benefit. (Victoria) <P>

The refurbished and second-hand market in Manchester city centre is seeing significant levels of activity.  This market comprises the vast majority of Manchester occupiers who, in many cases simply do not consider prestige new schemes but position themselves in the market as they sit fit.   The major recent deals in this market are shown in Table 2  below.<P>

As recent occupier transactions illustrate, recent office demand for new or refurbished space in Manchester city centre has been mainly driven by professional services, notably lawyers and accountants, rather than the banking and financial sector.   Over recent years the retail banking sector has undergone significant restructuring, resulting in the closure of many high street branches.  However, the move towards telebanking is likely to generate demand for office property, as evidenced by the Co-op Bank's recent purchase of the 8,000 m<sup>2</sup> Pyramid building in Stockport. <P>

There is around 56,840m<sup>2</sup> of new office space available in Manchester city centre,  including schemes currently under construction.   In the prime core area, The Chancery and 17 York Street have recently been completed, while 82 King Street is due to complete this summer.  Quoting rents for these new developments are around £215.30 per m<sup>2</sup>.  On the edge of the core area, AMEC has recently started speculative development of The Observatory scheme on Cross Street, which offers around 5,200m<sup>2</sup>. <P>

However, whilst there are a number of large occupier requirements, users which require large floorplates are likely to consider pre-lets on schemes outside the core, which can offer larger floorplates.  Each of the three core buildings offer floorplates under 850m<sup>2</sup>  and we believe are more likely to be multi-let on a floor by floor basis rather than let to a single occupier.<P> 
 
The next speculative project likely to get under way is at 52-58 Brown Street where AXA Equity & Law Investment Managers has consent to replace Scottish Provident House with 2,600 m<sup>2</sup> of offices and 158 m<sup>2</sup> of  retail on the ground floor.  AXA Equity & Law plan to start demolition in the summer, with completion scheduled for the end of 1997. <P>

The main period of growth in prime office rents within Manchester occurred during the late 1980's and early 1990's when strong demand met with very limited good quality supply, and new rental 'benchmarks' were set in a succession of major pre-lets.  In 1988 Barclays pre-leased 4,000m<sup>2</sup> in Citygate Plaza, Moseley Street for £124 per m<sup>2</sup>;  in June 1989 Guardian Royal Exchange pre-leased 2,600 m<sup>2</sup> in Fiscal House, Fountain Street for £143 per m<sup>2</sup>;  in September 1989 Direct Line Insurance pre-leased 2,600 m<sup>2</sup> in Centrestage, Peter Street for £153 per m<sup>2</sup>; in October 1990 KPMG Peat Marwick pre-leased St James's House, John Dalton Street  for £188 per m<sup>2</sup>; and in October 1992 Legal & General pre-leased 1 St James Square for £221 per m<sup>2</sup>.<P>

The Legal & General deal represented the top rent achieved in Manchester city centre and rents subsequently fell back under the impact of recession.  At present headline rents for best quality new space are around £215 per m<sup>2</sup> although only before substantial incentives are included.  Headline rents in the second-tier market are currently between £86 per m<sup>2</sup> and £108 per m<sup>2</sup>, depending mainly on location and the quality of premises. <P>

<P><IMG SRC="ncecosummermulch95.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=left>Since 1991,
The Evergreen Foundation has been dedicated to connecting people with
nature through the enhancement of healthy natural environments in
schools and communities across Canada.

<P>More than 70% of Canadians live in cities, and our urban areas are
expanding everyday. As the cities spread into the countryside, nature
is reduced to a few disconnected parks. Natural areas are vital to
the health of our cities and are also a tremendous educational and
recreational resource. Natural areas help filter air and water,
moderate temperatures, create recreational and educational spaces and
provide habitat for bird and other wildlife. The lack of functioning
natural areas is affecting the health of our cities and has a clear
link to the quality of life enjoyed by their citizens and education
provided their children.

<P>The Evergreen Foundation aims to involve schools, communities,
government and business in the process of transforming bleak asphalt,
concrete and mown turf into healthier and more educational natural
environments.

<P><IMG SRC="nsnbbessboroughheader.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>Two
main programs form the basis of these efforts:

<P>* <B><A HREF="nspage.html">SCHOOL GROUND NATURALIZATION</A> </B>is
a national program designed to give teachers, parents, communities
and students the tools to transform their school grounds into
healthier learning environments.

<P>* <B><A HREF="ncpage.html">COMMUNITY NATURALIZATION</A></B> is a
regional program in the Toronto area designed to help people restore
and care for natural areas in their communities. Many aspects of this
program are easily transferable to other communities, and in fact,
this program may be refocused to provide support across Canada.

<P>Not affiliated with any other group or government agency, The
Evergreen Foundation depends on the, support of individuals,
businesses, private foundations and governments to pursue its
objectives.

<LI><H3>Upcoming Learning Grounds Training Sessions
include <A HREF="nslgpage.html">Edmonton, AB; Kingston, ON. London,
On, Saskatoon, SA, and Victoria, BC</A> Learning Grounds Training
Sessions are designed to give community leaders, educators, students,
parents, landscape architects and others the tools to transform
school grounds into natural outdoor classrooms. The training session
will study; project benefits, planning ideas, case studies, and
ongoing project maintenance.</H3>

in 1995, <A HREF="lgcalgary95proceedings.html">Calgary</A>and

<LI><H3>The Outdoor Classroom eMail listserv question(s) of the month:
</H3>

<UL>
   <LI>Not a question this month per se, but an issue: <B>School
   Board Guidelines</B> for naturalizing/improving the learning
   opportunities of school grounds. Do you know of boards that have
   guidelines? What should be included in guidelines?
   
   <LI><A HREF="mailto:dmorton@pathcom.com">Debbie Morton</A> asks "
   Does anyone know what one needs to plant to attract<B>
   fireflies?"</B>
   
   <P><A HREF="mailto:ihendry@mgl.ca">Ian Hendry</A> replied:" Hi
   Debby, Very little seems to be known about fireflies.What I could
   find suggests that
   
   <UL>
      <LI>they are carnivorous.
      
      <LI>the larva prefer swampy areas.
      
      <LI>their decline has been attributed both pesticides and
      competition from human light sources drownding out their
      signals.
   </UL>
   
   <P>Therefore to attract fireflies it seem to be not so much a case
   of providing specific plants, but rather the right general
   conditions i.e. swampy areas for the larva, dark skies for the
   adults and lots of other pesticide-free insects for them to eat.

<H3>Learning Grounds Program</H3>

<P><B>Transforming Canadian School Grounds into Natural Learning
Environments</B>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><B>The Year in Review</B>

<P><IMG SRC="nsonmillgrove3kids.gif"
ALIGN=right>

<P>The enthusiasm generated by the Learning Grounds Program (LGP) in
1995/96 inundated our offices with inquiries. This year, grant
applications more than doubled, and 2 LGP co-ordinators and a part
time assistant were added to our staff in Toronto and Vancouver. The
overwhelming response was partly due to extensive media exposure of 3
new public service announcements. Look for them on CBC, Life, CTV and
YTV! Word was also spread through a video, Grounds for Change, and
through Learning Grounds workshops, which included participants from
the Yukon to the Maritimes. LGP continues to develop as a global
leader with presentations to international gatherings and through
partnerships with Great Britain's Learning Through Landscapes on
International School Grounds Day. The name of this program has
recently been changed from School Ground Naturalization to reflect a
broadening vision; students will be encouraged to explore art,
culture, heritage and technology in combination with nature in the
school ground.

<P><B>Hands-On Help And Model Projects</B>

<P>LGP offers hands-on help to schools in the form of regional
associates. Sponsored in part by Environment Canada, these experts
assist schools in planning naturalization projects. The schools that
receive these free services then act as models to ensure that future
projects are designed to be sustainable and to naturalize rather than
simply beautify school grounds.

<P><B>The Need For Research<IMG SRC="nsonporthopepond96.jpeg" ALIGN=left></B>

<P>The vision of a new school landscape is currently based on
research conducted in Great Britain and the United States. To alter
attitudes toward the design, use and management of school grounds, we
need information that relates to Canadian schools and students. LGP
is seeking partners to conduct research on the impact of naturalized
spaces on student, teacher and community health, the school budget
and the curriculum. Please call Roben at (416) 596-1495 or Tammy at
(604) 689-0766 for more information.

<P>&nbsp;

<P><B>Learning Grounds Program in Action: A Prairie Butterfly
Habitat</B>

<P>Students, teachers and parents at Henry Kelsey School in
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan are planting prairie grasses and wildflowers
to restore a butterfly habitat on their school ground. Last spring,
Painted Lady butterflies were released into the garden. An idea that
began with a grade two class has harnessed such momentum that it has
expanded to include the larger school community.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"The students took more initiative and
responsibility for the project and for their learning as the planting
progressed. The butterfly garden takes the child and educator far
beyond the bean-plant-in-the-styrofoam-cup experiment to a more
holistic learning about plants, soil, plant needs and insect-plant
connections &endash; a native prairie." </I> Teacher Marcia Klein
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><B>Evergreen Foundation Named Most Innovative Nonprofit
Organization</B></H3>

<P>On October 3, the Evergreen Foundation was presented with the 1996
Peter F. Drucker Award for Canadian Nonprofit Innovation. There were
94 applicants for the award. EF was selected as this year's winner
for its innovative approach to managing its Learning Grounds Program,
which has grown from a regional program to one with a national focus
and an international audience. The award is recognized by EF as a
great honour after 6 years of dedication and hard work.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;

<H3>Community Naturalization Program</H3>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>Going National</B>

<P>The Community Naturalization Program (CNP) is an action program
that involves the community in the ecological restoration of public
lands. Over the past year, EF has been developing a strategy for a
national program to support this initiative. During the first phase,
a series of surveys and meetings documented naturalization efforts in
municipalities and neighbourhoods across Canada. Phase 2 entails a
national education and communication series initiated by GroundWork's
'96 (described on the next page). Existing and developing
partnerships with Health Canada, Environment Canada, Active Living Go
for Green, the Canadian Parks and Recreation Association and many
others will ensure success.

<P>&nbsp;

<P><B>Park User Survey - Metro Toronto</B>

<P>This summer, CNP - Metro Toronto collected information about the
present use of, and opinions on, urban parks. Both naturalized parks
(those that include restored areas) and traditional parks were
targeted. Of those surveyed:

<UL>
   <LI>66% wanted to see more trees, shrubs and wildflowers
   
   <LI>52% were in favour of reducing or eliminating
   chemicalfertilizers and pesticides
   
   <LI>69% felt that more signs specifying species names wouldbe
   helpful
</UL>

<P>This valuable information will aid in the development of future
CNP programs. A report of the findings and recommendations will be
available soon. Please contact Kim at (416) 596-1495 for more
information.

<P>&nbsp;

<P><B>Community Naturalization Program in Action:<IMG
SRC="nceverettherptilesummer96.jpeg"  ALIGN=left></B>

<P><B>Everett Crowley Park - Vancouver</B>

<P>Everett Crowley Park is a large, little known, gem in South East
Vancouver. It has a colourful history and lots of community spirit.
From 1944 to 1967, it was Vancouver's "Kerr Road dump". Since then,
it has evolved into an urban wilderness.

<P>EF has worked with the Everett Crowley Park Committee gathering
ecological and historical information for use in making decisions
about the park's future and in finding opportunities to enhance its
habitat. Community volunteers, UBC students, Vancouver Natural
History Society members, Scouts CAN, Champlain Heights Community
School and Community Centre students and Youth Council have conducted
amphibian, reptile and stream studies and have identified 52 bird and
177 plant species in the park. Environmental Science students from
Capilano College have assessed habitat, water and soil conditions.
The Environmental Youth Alliance has helped train volunteers in the
use of produce waste from lettuce, carrots and onions as part of a
sheet mulching technique. In addition, a park user survey and
interpretive brochure have been completed and a historical booklet on
the park will be printed this winter.

<P>EF has been coordinating and facilitating these projects and
partnerships for the past year, but the Everett Crowley Park
Committee is now equipped to continue on its own. EF will be winding
up its involvement with an open house and community workshop in
October, 1996.

<P>&nbsp;

<P><B>Ecosummer 1996 - Metro Toronto</B>

<P>Ecosummer 1996, CNP's Toronto summer site maintenance initiative,
got off to an enthusiastic start following a very busy and successful
spring planting season. Events this summer centred around three main
activities: maintenance of sites in the East and Lower Don parklands,
monitoring of planting success rates in Riverdale Park and wildflower
plantings with the Task Force to Bring Back the Don.

<P>Participation in the program came from a variety of groups,
including St. Michael's Halfway Home, Covenant House, J.D. Griffen
Adolescent Centre, Camp Banbury for youth and young adults with
mental and physical disabilities, Trails Youth Initiatives for inner
city youth, Serve Canada and the University Settlement Centre.

<P>Thanks to all the participants for contributing to Ecosummer and
to The Molson Companies Donations Fund and Levi Strauss and Company
Canada whose support made this project possible.

<P>&nbsp;

<P><B>GroundWorks '96:</B> <B>From Naturalization to Restoration<BR>

October 4 &amp; 5  Metro Hall, Toronto</B>

<P>EF hosted GroundWorks'96, a two day regional conference, sponsored
by Metro Toronto Parks and Culture and Canada Trust, Friends of the
Environment.

<P>Focusing on ecological naturalization and restoration projects in
Southern Ontario, highlights included The Hon. David Crombie as
Keynote Speaker and Plenary Speaker Marianne Cramer from New York
City Central Park's Planning Department. Workshops and tours were led
by Toronto's Lorraine Johnson and Monica Kuhn. By providing urban
residents, parks departments and landscape architects with
information on naturalization efforts, GroundWorks'96 fostered a
sense of stewardship for natural urban areas. To order conference
proceedings, call EF at (416) 596-1495.

<H3>Changes to the EF Team</H3>

<P><B>Kevin McLaughlin</B> has decided to make room for his other
passions. After 68 months of dedication to everything that makes EF
great, Kevin is taking his extensive skills out of the day-to-day
operations of EF and on to new heights. EF has gained an active
Advisor and an inspired Board Member. We wish him well on his
journey.

<P><B>Jennifer McLaughlin </B>wants to travel the world and dance to
the rhythm of flamenco music. Wild in the City was chaired by
Jennifer and set a benchmark for excellence. In her year and a half
with us, she displayed creativity, analytical skills, initiative and
a warm heart. We will miss her as she leaves to explore new areas of
interest.

<P><B>Martha Norman</B> ran our 1994 CNP site monitoring program and
has since become an integral part of our Vancouver team. Lean times
in the nonprofit sector have left us unable to keep Martha at EF. We
have benefited from her intelligent, educated and thoughtful
perspective and hope she fulfills her dream of running a native plant
nursery.

<P>&nbsp;

<P><B>The Role Of Ecological Restoration  In Biodiversity
Conservation: Basic Issues And Guidelines</B>

<P>EF, in partnership with Wildlife Habitat Canada and the Urban
Forests Centre, has completed a research project examining the
relationship between naturalization and biodiversity conservation. A
report, which assesses the potential for making links between urban
and rural landscapes and provides guidelines for groups involved in
naturalization and restoration, is available through EF for $13.00 or
at www.evergreen.ca/restorationandbiodiversity.html..

<P>&nbsp;

<P><B>Our Web Site Grows</B>

<P>Day by Day......www.evergreen.ca is going into its second year.
Expanded to 250 pages, it contains a wealth of information on school
and community projects and now receives about 75 visitors a day. New
to the Internet is <A HREF="oclist.html">oclist@evergreen.ca,</A> a
"listserv" where users can share stories and get info about school
ground naturalization.

<P>&nbsp;

<P><B>Our Message Has Reached Olympic Proportions!</B>

<P>Thanks to the ingenious TV and print ads created for The Evergreen
Foundation by Roche Macaulay and Partners Advertising Inc., our
message is being heard as never before! Viewers across the nation saw
one of our TV spots on CBC during the Opening Ceremony of the 1996
Summer Olympic Games. For those who flip pages rather than channels,
the ads appeared in Time Magazine in July and August. A special
thanks to our national media sponsor, Life Network, for continued
support and airtime.

<P>&nbsp;

<P><B>Wild in the City!</B>

<P>On May 10, 1996, The Evergreen Foundation made a splash on the
social scene. 70 designer bird houses were auctioned at the Art
Gallery of Ontario during Wild in the City, an event which raised
$50,000! Dancers and singers entertained; partygoers reveled the
night away. Thanks to the many dedicated volunteers and generous
sponsors who made the evening possible. Even wilder events are being
planned for Toronto and Vancouver next year.

<H2>Family Album, 1991</H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the beginning there was a group of young, energetic, university
grads who wanteed to save the world - or do something exciting. One
by one they began assembling at Geoff Cape's apartment, and tried to
figure out how to get money to buy trees to give to kids to plant (or
something like that). In April of 1991, all of this work produced: an
8 page insert in Canada's 'national paper', the Globe &amp; Mail; 200
trees delivered to 200 schools in Metro Toronto; an educational
booklet called "Branches &amp; Roots"; and 16 large trees planted at
the mouth of the Don River in Toronto's Ashbridges Bay Park at TREE
DAY, APril 21, 1991.</P>

<P><B>The first Evergreen Team:</B> Nuria Bronfman, Tony Hyland, (Mr.
Donor), Lindsey Taylor, Geoff Cape, (Mr Donor), Philip Brodeur,
Andrea Thomas and Kevin McLaughlin.</P>

Kevin moved Evergreen out of Geoff's office and into a great little
office on Mercer St., Toronto.</P>

<P>Tree Day 1992: We'd done it once before, so what could be the big
deal. 1,000 kids, 1,800 trees and shrubs being planted in Toronto's
Riverdale Park East, media, donors, music, RAIN &amp; MUD! The
biggest tree planting in Toronto history - shall likely remain that
forever. Small is beautiful.</P>

<P>By 1993, Tree Day was still an important public relations event,
but no longer the center peice of the organization. Evergreen
programs focused on reintroducing nature to our urban &amp; suburban
landscapes with community participation on schools, parks &amp; even
corporate property.</P>

<p> Lindsey (left) was responsible for developing our Community Naturalization 
program, as well as many other aspects of the organization. Development of the
"CNP program"
included 
cornerstone relationships in the Toronto area with David Stone / Task Force to
Bring Back the Don River and Garth Armour / Metro Toronto Parks.

<P>Continuing our relationship with Rock &amp; Roll, The Tragically
Hip let us set up a booth at their groundbreaking Another Roadside
Attraction. "Free oranges if you read our info" was the rallying cry,
and the Tree-guy was left to defend himself.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../mikewhiteandfriend93.jpeg" WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=235
X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom>1993 was also
the year that we lost a bright, shining star: Marina Santin. She
joined us in May, after Sara left to go back to school. Marina, a
dynamic, intelligent and creative person with a flare for ecology
&amp; the piano, was killed on her bike just 200m from work in
August, 1993. Those that knew her will always be happier and more
inspired from her brief dance on this earth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Great Evergreen sushi party, 1993: Planned as a farewell 
to our summer interns David Wong & Kim Dunkelman, Evergreen was fortunate enough
to be able to rehire Kim in January of 1994. She learn to swim in Evergreen's "sink or swim" environment
and has grown into the indispensable role of
 director of the Community Naturalization Program.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Evergreen's boundless energy also foresaw offices across Canada,
and we started in Vancouver with the help of the very generous
Vancouver Foundation. (That it seemed like a beautiful place to live,
or that Geoff's "ex" lived there had nothing to do with it....)</P>

<H2>Family Album, 1994</H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Evergreen Foundation began to hit its stride in 1994, with
both offices running many programs with the help of many dedicated
staff and volunteers, our knowledge-base reaching a very strong level
and our financial support base growing. 1994 was also the first major
year of staff changes, with co-founder Lindsey Taylor retiring &amp;
moving to New York City to start a new career and co-founder Kevin
McLaughlin moving to Vancouver to head that office as James Dungate,
who opened the Vancouver office, also moved on to a new career. We
were also joined by Roben Stikeman, the first manager of the School
Ground Naturalization program who could focus soley on that program.

<P>Although our photos here might not show it, 1995 was also a very
busy and successful year for The Evergreen Foundation, with
considerable depth being added to our community &amp; school programs
in both Vancouver &amp; Toronto, and of course, the birth of our web
site!</P>

through a number of seasons since it began over three years ago, with
a little help from Toronto and Vancouver Foundation in James
Dungate's parent's house. For the last year and a half,
<A HREF="mailto:martha@evergreen.ca">Martha Norman</A> has been
crucial to the blossoming success which it has experienced. She
brought an intelligent, dedicated and balanced approach to the
Vancouver team at a time when the future of the office was still
quite tenuous - and made it work. It is with a very heavy heart that
Evergreen has had to face the realities of non-profits in Canada and
not be able to renew Martha's contract. We wish her well on her dream
of running a native plant nursery.</H3>

<P>(a Learning Grounds pilot project for 1997 in British Columbia)
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Learning Grounds program is designed to help schools transform
parts of their traditional asphalt and turf grass grounds into
educational resources. Creating outdoor classrooms and maintaining
these natural areas provides an excellent opportunity to observe,
participate in and learn from a changing, complex environment. The
aim is to go beyond simply beautifying and move towards using school
grounds as an educational tool for students.</P>

<P>The Evergreen Foundation has selected the following four schools
to take part in a pilot "Model" Natural Schools Project to
demonstrate the planning process essential in the success of school
ground projects--Sir James Douglas Elementary and L'ecole Bilingue in
Vancouver, Blueridge Elementary in North Vancouver and Eagle Ridge in
Coquitlam. Evergreen will be helping to facilitate the school
committees through the planning process and will advise on the
various components involved in a Learning Grounds project. Evergreen
will act as a facilitator, however the school committee will be the
lead partner. </P>

<P>As a component of the pilot "Model" Natural School Project ,
Evergreen will be directly supporting these "Model" schools by
offering the Community Champions program. A Champion will directly
service the school committees helping them reach their goals by
offering their knowledge and expertise in their individual fields.
This pilot project will develop successful school projects which can
then act as models for other schools and their communities.</P>

<P>As more schools begin to look at how to make changes to their
school grounds, the need for parents and school staff to access
training, information and resources is apparent. The Evergreen
Foundation with local partners, The Waterwise Gardening
Program-Victoria Compost Education Centre, WILD Education, Swan Lake
Nature Sanctuary, and Naturescape BC, are addressing this demand by
initiating a Training Session for Vancouver Island. &nbsp;</PRE></P>

<P><B>Note: </B>This information was taken out of the Adopt-A-Pond
programme's book "The Urban Outback - Wetlands for Wildlife. A guide
to Wetland restoration and Frog-friendly backyards". This book is
available at the above address.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>The Adopt-A-Pond Programme</B>

<P>The mission of the Metro Toronto Zoo's Adopt-A-Pond programme is
to preserve and restore wetlands; have each of Ontario's 5,000
schools adopt a wetland; empower communities and industries to think
globally and act locally by linking frog-friendly backyards to local
wetlands; and, emphasize the importance of local hydrology,
ecological function, and bioregional constraints in the design of
wetlands. Once a group has undertaken a pond "adoption" by visiting a
wetland, building a pond, or conducted classroom activities
associated with wetland and frog conservation, we will forward
certificates of appreciation and frog stickers for every student as a
token of our appreciation for their commitment. Photos, student
submissions, or reports on projects for our newsletter, "Amphibian
Voice" are encouraged.

<P>Our current projects include developing a cross-curricular guide.
The cross-curricular guide will meet the guidelines of the Common
Curriculum, and will help teachers further integrate wetland biology
and amphibian conservation into the classroom.

<P>We currently have 1,200 Ontario schools participating in the
Adopt-A-Pond programme. Our objective is to involve all 5,000 Ontario
primary and secondary schools and then link them through homeowner's
backyards, industrial lands, hydro right of ways, and railway lines.
If you require any further information or material on this
conservation effort please feel free to contact me at the above
address. One of the most rewarding methods of increasing the natural
value and visual appeal of your property is to construct a water
garden. A water garden with flowering marsh plants and water lilies
are a very attractive focal point. If designed properly, your water
garden will allow you to observe the life cycle of amphibians
throughout the season.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>Building a Pond</B>

<P>After you have fully researched and designed your wetland habitat,
the next step is to start building it. The best pond would simply
form after a scrape is made in the ground. When the water table is
reached water will pool into the pond and remain at the level of the
local water table which may fluctuate with rain or drought. However,
most water tables are too deep and ponds rely on meltwater or rains
to maintain levels. If the soil in your area does not contain clay,
then you will need an impervious layer to hold the pond water.
Pre-molded fibreglass, concrete, clay or flexible pool liners can be
used to hold pond water. In previous sections we've discussed wetland
restoration.

<P>The following sections deal primarily with ponds constructed with
liners

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>1. Where to build a pond.</B>

<P>Before constructing your pond you must take into consideration lot
lines, property deeds, locations of any overhead or underground
lines, and local bylaws requiring fencing or permits. Keep your pond
away from trees.

<P>Urban populations of toads may have high level of predation due to
large raccoon populations or road kills during migrations to an area
away from garden ponds. There have been many documented incidence of
toads, unable to climb concrete road curbs, suffering a high death
rate due to vehicles or, in one case, being swept up into a road
sweeper each morning of the week. Locate your pond where amphibians
can enter and exit without risking death. However, toads produce over
5,000 eggs and we can expect even in pristine areas that only 50
toadlets will survive their first year (1% of the egg mass).

<P>Locate your pond where it can receive meltwater. Look for low
ground that naturally collect's water and where pools form in the
spring. Water can be directed to this area or retained behind a low
dam or berm. If your pond is located near a building, redirect
downspout water to replenish the pond each time it rains. If water is
lost quickly to percolation, a clay liner will prevent water from
soaking into the ground. Deepen your pool if water evaporates too
quickly. You may talk to local contractors or naturalists who can
best advise you on your local conditions.

<P>Your pond should be located away from manure, and chemical
contamination sources such as runoff areas from composts, pastures,
septic tanks and treated fields and lawns. Ammonia, released by
manure and many other fertilizers during wet periods, has been found
to affect tadpoles of amphibians. Runoff, in this case, should not be
directed to the pond. After a period of drought, nitrate and other
salts can be found at high concentrations in the front zones of
runoff. Subsequent rainfall then creates a "toxic wave" retarding and
preventing frog tadpoles from developing. The high levels of
nutrients found in the runoff may also cause algae blooms A
vegetation buffer strip around the entire pond will reduce erosion
and help filter sediment, fertilizer, pesticide and other
contaminants before they enter the pond.

<P>Rivers, creeks and irrigation ditches, with vegetation along the
banks and with occasional adjacent ponds, are ideal breeding grounds
and dispersal routes for frogs. If you build your pond near such an
area, you will have a greater chance of attracting breeding
amphibians to your pond. Other dispersal corridors for both
amphibians and other wildlife include shelter belts, forest
plantations, unused road reserves, remnant woodlands, windbreaks and
overgrown roadside verges.

<P>The location of your pond will determine the kinds of toads and
frogs that can breed there. The closer your pond is to existing
populations, the more likely that some will take up residence and
actually breed in the new pond. You must understand that amphibians
are creatures of habit and will not at first want to move from their
old breeding pond to the new one. However, after one or two frogs or
toads breed in the new pond, their offspring will return year after
year to breed in the habitat that you have created. Remember that
your pond will provide personal enjoyment and contribute to the
diversity of your community. As more and more homeowners develop
wetlands or frog friendly backyards, the more likely that wetland
species will take up residence in your `backyard.

<P>Remember that toads are not "attached" to your property like your
dog or cat. Individual toads may not remain, but if conditions are
right, other members of the species, perhaps its siblings or
relatives will arrive to replace "your" toad if it should choose to
leave!

<P>In many cases, frogs, toads and salamanders have lost their
habitat and have no place to live. No matter how good your pond is,
there may be no nearby populations to replenish your new pond. If
your community or backyard can sustain toads, and with prior approval
from your local Ministry of Natural Resources, naturalists and
wildlife experts or Conservation Authority office, you may move some
tadpoles (about 100 per year) from a nearby pond that is within three
kilometers of your location. It is likely that these tadpoles will
remain part of the local population in your area (one kilometer is
the average migration range for the common toad!). If you wish to
translocate tadpoles, contact the amphibian interest group for
important information. Do not purchase frogs, toads, salamanders or
newts. You do not want to put new tadpoles in your pond if it is not
suitable for that species, and we do not want to deplete tadpoles
from another source population that is itself in trouble of
disappearing.

<P>All ponds need time to develop into good amphibian habitat. The
quality of habitat is improved when plants and algae are well
established, when sediments that cloud the water have settled to the
bottom and stay there even after heavy rain, and when a nice layer of
detritus (decomposed plant and animal matter) settles on the bottom
of the pond. This is a source of nutrients for plants, tadpoles, and
other aquatic organisms.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>(A) Toad Ponds</B>

<P>In a new pond, toads are often the first species to appear. Toads
adapt very well to living around homes and gardens, and are a good
species to attract to your new pond. In most cases, toads are the
model species for new ponds and your efforts should focus on
attracting this species. While you are waiting for the first toads to
arrive, take delight in the first dragonfly that magically arrives at
your new wetland.

<P>Do not worry if your toad pond dries over the summer (ephemeral
ponds) as this is the type of pond that most toads will select. It is
not unusual to see thousands of little 1 cm toadlets lined up along
the shore of a drying pond basking in the sun and taking in the last
of the pond water through the skin of their belly. Because toad ponds
are located in open areas with full sun it is essential that cover
such as boards, flat rocks, tall grasses, or stumps be provided as
shelter for the toadlets while they move away from their birth pond.

<P><B>(B) Woodland ponds</B>

<P>&nbsp; Woodland ponds attract spotted salamanders, spring peepers
and wood frogs. These ponds usually dry over the summer. They are
commonly formed by spring meltwater and because they are located in a
forest, they contain cool water &nbsp; for much of the spring. The
frogs spend the summer feeding in the woodlands and hibernate under
leaf litter or stumps and logs. The large yellow spotted and blue
spotted salamanders live underground in cool retreats beneath stumps
for much of the summer and are often called "mole salamanders"
because of this habit. &nbsp; It is difficult to dig ponds in wooded
areas. Where local hydrological conditions are right, you can either
increase water by damming or directing water to low wooded areas.
Wetlands can be planted with trees that in time will develop into a
swamp (see Appendix for a list of water tolerant trees). &nbsp;

<P><B>(C) Farm ponds </B>&nbsp;

<P>Ponds like those found on farms are usually 1.5 to 3 meters deep;
deep enough to penetrate ground water to keep them filled all summer.
They are exposed to full sunshine, are warm and productive. These
ponds do not dry up so species such as green frogs live here. The
tadpoles of green frogs frogs require at least two years to develop
into frogs. If you have green frogs then you can be sure that there
is a permanent pond somewhere nearby. To improve the area around the
pond plant native species around the edge. This provides cover for
adults and emerging amphibians (See list in the Adopt-A-Pond book
"The Urban Outback - Wetlands for Wildlife".

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>2. How Big and How Deep</B>

<P>The size of your pond will be determined by the space you have
available, thesize required to hold water long enough for the frog or
salamander eggs tohatch and the tadpoles to develop into their
terrestrial form, and if theamphibian species hibernate under water
or not. Amphibian species can requiredifferent lengths of time to
develop. For example, from 60 days for fastdeveloping species like
the common toad or up to two years for green frogs andfour years for
bullfrogs! The average time for most salamanders and frogs is60 to 90
days. Local soils and temperatures also affect the water
holdingability of ponds. Larger or deeper ponds may be required in
well drainedsandy or gravelly soils while clay soils hold water well
and the pond can besmaller with less water.

<P>If the amphibians found in your area hibernate under water, then
they will notsurvive in your pond if it completely freezes. Your pond
will not completelyfreeze if you dig at least one section below the
frost line (at least 2 metersdeep), or you can install a pond aerator
to keep the pond well aerated and todeep ice form forming. Farm ponds
can easily include 2 meter deep sectionsthat do not freeze to the
bottom and provide oxygenated water under icecovered ponds. Amphibian
species which hibernate under water include theBullfrog, Pickerel
frog, Mink frog, Green frog, Northern Leopard frog,Mudpuppy and the
Red-spotted newt.

<P>Amphibians are attracted to ponds by the size of its reflective
surface. Ifthe pond surface is too small (i.e. smaller than 3 X 2
metres), amphibians won'teven notice it! Smaller ponds suffer from
temperature fluctuations and takelonger to become settled and
balanced. There must be enough bacteria andalgae on rocks and bottom
to feed tadpoles, and sufficient aquatic insectproduction to feed the
adult frogs or toads. You will also want to have apond big enough and
deep enough to prevent predators such as crows, garter

<P>snakes and raccoons from having access to the center of the pond.
Mostamphibians will rest or bask along the edges of a pond but
retreat to deeperwater when frightened. If you are concerned about
the safety of smallchildren you may want to restrict access with a
natural looking fence (cedarrail) and gate. However, large rocks can
be submerged just below thewaterline and these will restrict access
to deeper water. The rocks alsoprovide a refuge for frogs and their
tadpoles and may make it easier for wildlife to enter and exit the
pond.

<P>Rather than limiting ponds as wild life habitat, homeowners are
encouraged touse it to teach water safety. Our communities are dotted
with backyard poolsand water courses. Canadian children will have
access to lakes, rivers, andswimming pools at some time in their
life. An awareness of the potentialdanger and how to act responsibly
around water will benefit our children andthe wild life that depends
upon water for survival.

<P>Our first insight that toads would breed in constructed ponds
occurred whenMetro Toronto Zoo received reports of toads breeding in
swimming pool covers.The covers had been placed over in ground pools
and these had filled with snowmelt water in the spring. Because pool
covers are dark in colour they heatfaster than surrounding ponds, and
in this instance the toads actuallyappeared to call and breed two
weeks before toads in natural ponds. Poolowners can help by leaving
their pool covers on until the toadlets leave thewater in early June.


<P>We have studied all known constructed toad breeding ponds in the
Toronto area,a heavily urbanized region which surprisingly supports a
large number of toadpopulations. One of the smallest toad ponds is
concrete, perfectly round, 2.7meters across, 0.45 m deep in the
centre with gently sloping sides, andlocated in the center of a large
expanse of lawn. Ron and Barb Mitchell ofPort Credit, Ontario
contacted the zoo to report that toads had bred twice inone summer in
his backyard pond. Further investigation confirmed that toadshad
indeed bred twice in his pond and more importantly, revealed that
Mr.Martin's pond is the smallest toad breeding pond known to us- a
mere one metreby 0.5 metre!

<P>The habitat of small ponds is enhanced by homeowners who plant
gardens tocreate damp shelters for toadlets. Ponds also located near
ravines or woodedareas where they attract existing toad population
living in the surroundinghabitat. Of course the bigger your pond the
better. Ideally the pond shouldbe 6 meters long and 4 meters wide.
Ponds of this size may be intimidating.However, once set in the
ground and planted around the edges to createterrestrial habitat,
your pond will not appear to be quite so large.

<P>Many suppliers sell small pool liners indicating that they are
suitable forfrogs. Although a frog could live in these ponds over the
summer, there is nopossibility that the frog could overwinter or
breed in these small ponds.Many of the so-called "frog ponds" sold by
nurseries in pre-packaged boxes aresolid fibreglass. These are deep,
with very steep sides and are death trapsto amphibians that may fall
in and cannot climb out of the water. Let yournursery know that these
ponds are either too small or steep sided to support abreeding
amphibian population.

<P>If you are building an irrigation pond please remember that
extreme water

<P>level fluctuations reduce the ability of native plants and animals
toestablish themselves. Increasing the size of the pond will reduce
thefluctuations in water level.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>3. Shape</B>

<P>In most instances people create very unusual shapes when they
start theirfirst pond. You should confine these shapes to crescents
or ovals.Homeowners should stay away from too many curves and square
corners becauseit's difficult to fold most liners into unusual
shapes, and water ends upstagnating in the convolutes.

<P>A shallow 10-18 cm deep shoreline or shelf provides growing areas
for emergentplants and spawning areas for egg laying. Alternating
shoreline depths allowsyou to create different habitats including a
wet meadow, a rock garden and acattail area. In winter the shallow
bank will allow ice to expand out of yourpond so damage does not
occur to the liner.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>4. Concrete, Fiberglass or Clay Ponds?</B>

<P>A. Concrete and Fiberglass Ponds

<P>We recommended that flexible pond liners be used as opposed to
concrete andfiberglass. Concrete ponds are expensive requiring
footings, reinforcementsand several solid inches of concrete.
Although concrete ponds should have along lifespan, it is not
uncommon to find cracking within a few years.Construction of a large
concrete pond often presents technical problems besthandled by
professionals.

<P>A fiberglass pond is expensive costing approximately three times
that of a PVCflexible liner, and is not very natural looking. When
placing a fiberglasspond into the ground you must not use the
original soil that was dug out topack around the liner. Brick sand
which is free of stone should be usedbecause it has excellent
drainage, and will not hold water like soil will.This will prevent
water from becoming trapped below the fiberglass pondcausing it to
cork or come up out of the ground. Check the top of the poolwith a
spirit level at intervals so that when filling is complete the top
islevel in all directions. Several small fiberglass pools can be
placed side byside around a central land area that is heavily planted
to create one wetland.Remember to place rocks or logs in deep or
steep sided pools so that toadletsand froglets can climb out.

<P>B. Clay Ponds

<P>If your soil particle size is small (sandy silty soils) with a
clay content ofat least 10% than soil compaction is the easiest way
of sealing the bottom ofyour pond. Alternatively, soils with a clay
content of more than 20% can beimported for compaction.

<P>Although clay lined ponds are the most natural looking, clay is
not the bestchoice of impermeable barriers for backyard ponds. The
clay itself is veryheavy and can leak if not installed correctly.
Bentonite clay is applied atthe rate of 1 to 3 pounds per square
foot, tilled in, and then rolled tocompact the particles. Use a
sprinkler to wet the bentonite before

<P>compacting. Bentonite swells when wet but if complete drying
occurs bentoniteshrinks and may compromise the seal. Add water
immediately, otherwise theclay will dry out and crack. If you empty
the pool it must not be allowed todry out. A mixture of sand and
earth is placed on top to protect thewater-resistant clay liner from
mechanical damage.

<P>Geotextile clay liner is a product that sandwiches bentonite clay
between twolayers of felt. The felt is sewn so that the clay cannot
move and collectanywhere along the width or length of the roll.
Geotextile clay liners aregenerally used for large farm ponds, and
are expensive.

<P>Consult your bentonite supplier for alternative methods of
application(including adding bags of clay directly to the pond to
achieve a water barrieras the clay particles settle out on the pond
bottom).

<P><B>5. Flexible Liner Ponds</B>

<P><B>A.</B> Size of your Flexible linerIt is best to decide on the
type of liner you wish to buy and see what sizesit comes in before
you decide on the shape of your pond. A number of bulkliner rolls
come in increments of 1.5 m starting at the 3 m width. If ahomeowner
has dug a pond and needs a 4x7 liner, he/she would have to buy a4.5x7
m or 7.5x4 m liner according to the above widths.

<P>Measure the length and width of the rectangle that your pool fits
in. Addtwice the maximum depth of your pond and three feet to each of
thesemeasurements and you have the size of the liner you need.

<P>3 + ( 2 X maximum depth) + length = length of liner3 + ( 2 X
maximum depth) + width = width of liner

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>B. </B>Types of Flexible Pond liners

<P>There is generally four types of flexible pond liners: 40-80 mil
PVCsheeting, rubberized pool liners, 45 mil High Density Polyethylene
(HDPE)liners, and 45 mil Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM)
liner. Most ofthese liners are manufactured in black and, and natural
tones of brown andgreen creating a more natural look for your pond,
and giving your pond theillusion of depth.

<OL>
   <LI>The 40-80 mil PVC liners with ultraviolet inhibitors have a
   lifespan of 10years or more, are non-toxic to pond life. PVC
   liners tend to crack along thefolds during the winter, and have
   poor patching ability.
   
   <LI>Butyl rubber pond liners are UV resistant and generally have a
   20 yearlifespan. Some types of these liners contain toxic
   ingredients that may leachinto the water, therefore make sure you
   ask about it before you buy it. Theseliners are not readily
   available, very expensive, do not come in many sizesand are
   difficult to patch. Butyl rubber liners are flexible, but the
   40-50mil weights are thick and are hard to fold at corners and
   curves.
   
   <LI>HDPE liners are very stable, non-toxic, have the same life
   expectancy asPVC but cost 1/3 the price. HDPE liners are not
   readily available, aredifficult to work with in cold climates, and
   come with no guarantee.
   
   <LI>EPDM (45 mil) liners are flexible, U.V. stable, resistant to
   airpollution, have a lifespan of 20 years, are non-toxic to pond
   life and arevery inexpensive. This liner type is actually more
   flexible than PVC,therefore making it easier to install. Picov
   Water Gardens will only sell theEPDM 45 mil rubber liner to their
   customers because 'It has proven itself tobe the best liner for
   our cold climate. EPDM will not crack in cold climatesthat might
   possibly have winters that reach -40 C.

<P><B>D.</B> Putting in Flexible Pond Liners

<P>Before placing the pond liner you should remove all sharp objects
and makesure the soil is packed down hard and level. Once a pond is
put in, the bottom should be covered with 2-10 cm of washed sand
topped with a layer of gravel.

<P>When you build your pond try to pick a sunny day with no rain in
the forecastfor a couple of days. Sun makes digging more fun, but
also warms up the linermaking it a little more malleable. Do not
leave your liner out on the grassin the sun, because the heat
generated by the liner can kill large areas ofgrass. Before
installing a flexible liner you should check it formanufacturing
defects (holes and weak points), and line the pond with 5 cm ofsand
or a geotextile layer. It is not recommended to use old carpet
ornewspapers as carpet bulks up in the corners and makes for
difficult andunsightly folds in the liner, and newspaper has the
potential to get soggy andbecome penetrable to sticks or rocks.

<P>It is advisable to have four people to help you place your
flexible pondliner. Each person can take a corner and make sure the
liner is equal at allareas over the pond. A flexible liner is
installed by placing it over thehole and it is held firmly with
either a line of bricks or paving stones.Place a garden hose in the
middle of the pond and fill with water. The weightof the water
settles the liner to the shape of the pool. When the pool isfilling
with water, someone should be in it with their shoes and socks
offhelping the liner fold in the corners. They should also insure
that the lineris not being pulled down unevenly which can create a
potential leak when thepond is filled up to level. There is no danger
of the liner snapping backunder water when the weight is off because
it is kept firmly in place by waterpressure. This is the time to make
final adjustments such as levelling theliner edge or to direct
overflow to the intended area. Tuck the edge of theliner under 15 cm
of soil or keep it hidden underneath stones.

<P>We have been advised that if some flex is left in the liner
afterinstallation, the liner has less tendency to rip and allows you
to work in the pool.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>6. Digging Your Pond</B>

<P>There are a couple of things you should do before you start
digging your pond.It's a good idea to outline your pond in the
proposed area with a piece ofrope or flexible hose. You must also
take into consideration lot lines,property deeds, locations of any
overhead or underground lines, and localbylaws requiring fencing or
permits.

<P>Natural debris removed from your pond area may be useful when
creatingwildlife habitat around your pond (see next chapter). When
stripping off theturf, save large pieces to be put around the edge of
the pond. Smaller piecescan be placed in a compost pile. Digging
should be done in layers so that thetopsoil can be kept in a separate
pile. Get the pond excavations level andreshape the surroundings to
blend in before digging the depth of the pond.The pond must be
excavated to a size allowing for a waterproof barrier withits
protective matting (if required) and for a layer of sand at least
threeinches deep to cover the whole pond bed.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>7. Overflow</B>

<P>Make sure the pond is level! Use pegs, a straight board and a
spirit level tomake sure the water level will be the same on all
sides of the pond. Toprevent flooding, an overflow area should be
built beyond the edge of yourpond. This overflow area consists of a
hole dug down to a free-draining layerwhich you should break up,
backfill with clean stones, bricks and then coverwith a filter and
topsoil. The filter should be a piece of old carpet, fibrematting or
a layer of turf laid upside-down and then put topsoil back on
top.Vegetation suitable for a wet meadow can be planted in the
overflow area. Ifyour pond is built on uneven ground, make sure the
overflow is built on thelower end.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>8. Water Source</B>

<P>Downspout runoff from roofs can be directed into ponds. This also
reducessudden runoff into streams. If you are filling your pond with
tap water, you should let is stand a week before transferring plants
and animals. If you have a water meter, take a reading before and
after you fill your pond to give you an exact reading ofthe amount of
water in your pond. Chlorine, commonly found in many suburbanwater
supplies, can kill tadpoles and other amphibious larvae. There is
noneed to purchase de-chlorinating chemicals. Letting the tap water
stand a fewof days allows the chlorine to dissipate from the water.
Placing your hose atan angle to create a spray while filling your
pond increases the evaporationrate of the chlorine out of the water.
** A risk is taken by not using achlorine/chloramine neutralizer. If
by chance your municipality changes fromchlorine to chloramine and
you are not aware of it, you may loose all the wildlife in your pond.
Chloramine does not dissipate out of water.** This couldhappen when
you top up the pool with a hose.

<P>Although you can use tap water if you are not adding any more than
10% of thetotal water volume, it is best to top up your pond with
water that has beenstanding over a week, or with collected rainwater.
Use water as close to thetemperature of your pond as possible. You
can attach a float valve to anunderground water supply which
automatically tops up your pond as it loseswater to evaporation.
Remember to drain the hose before winter.

<P>If you are filling a concrete or fiberglass pond, you may want it
to naturallyfill up with rainwater. A pinch of powdered or crushed
lime can be added tothe water if you live in an area with acid rain.
Measure the pH before andafter your treatment. It is best to seek
professional advise from your watergarden nursery before altering the
chemistry of your pond.

<P>If you are considering diverting water from natural streams or
using waterwaysas sources of water you should consult you local
Ministry of Natural Resourcesor Regional Conservation Authority
because there may be regulations in placeto protect local fish stocks
and water supplies.

<P>There has been concern expressed over the construction of ponds
for"recreation" and large scale irrigation. In some areas of the
NiagaraEscarpment there is a moratorium on pond construction until
the cumulativeeffect of increasing numbers of ponds on water quality
is understood. Pondsare catchments for water runoff loaded with
organic nutrients, pesticides,

<P>herbicides, and other toxins. Water flushed from these holding
areas duringheavy storms may contaminate ground water supplies if the
wetland serves a water recharge function. In addition, water brought
to the surface in pondsmay increase the temperature and evaporation
rate of underground water causingthe water table to drop. Hawaiian
Garden Centre in St.Catharines hascommented that ponds lined with an
artificial liner and constructed with a mudbottom are long lasting
(20 years), and do not rob local groundwater supplies.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>9. Maintenance</B>

<P>Once a pond becomes a balanced unit, annual care and maintenance
should beminimal. If there is excess nutrient release from organic
matter orfertilizer your pond water may lose clarity and become foul.
In this case youshould remove the sources when known. Excess organic
matter such as fallenleaves, needles and dead stalks should be
removed in the spring and/or fall toprolong the period between major
cleanings. A good way to keep falling leavesout of your pond in the
fall is to place a protective screen over it. Thescreen should be
made up of fine nylon so that it will not trap amphibians orfish.
Fertilizer use should be avoided on backyards with ponds, and
compostheaps should be placed a distance from the pond.

<P><B>A. Liner repairs</B>

<P>Existing concrete ponds that have cracked during the winter can be
repaired byplacing a sheet of flexible pond liner over the dried and
cleaned concretesurface. A number of nurseries carry a liquid
E.P.D.M. liner which is anepoxy. Liquid E.P.D.M. is painted onto a
clean pond surface and hardens totake the exact shape of the pond.

<P>A patching kit should be available for each type of flexible pond
liner, butcheck with local nurseries before you make a liner
purchase.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>B. Control of algae</B>

<P>All ponds will have algae and this is a natural component of all
wetlands.Algae, attached to rocks and the sides of your pond, provide
most of yourpond's oxygen and are the most important food source for
tadpoles. However,green water is caused by microscopic algae living
in the water column. Youcannot create a "balanced" wetland in a few
days. Your pond will require timeto reach its own internal balance
and for nutrients which may create algae tobe used up by all the
plants. Do not use algicides as they are only a shortterm cure and
can harm aquatic organisms. Oxygenating plants submerged inyour pond
help to keep the nutrient cycle balanced. They compete with algaefor
nitrogen and other nutrients in the water, thus decreasing the amount
ofalgae in your pond. Emergent or floating leafed plants also take up
nutrientsand reduce light penetration into your pond and to the
algae. The extra coverprovided by the floating leafed plants may
reduce evaporation and thetemperature of your pond.

<P>Algal blooms often occur in the spring due to nutrient runoff and
the lack ofshading from plants. As previously mentioned you can try
and preventnutrients from entering the pond. Otherwise you will have
to wait until plantgrowth shades the pond, retarding algal growth, or
until nutrients are used up

<P>by the rooted plants. During this time you can remove the excess
algae bylifting it out with a rake or by placing a stick in the
middle of the algaemass and twirling it unto the stick. Before
placing the excess algae intoyour compost pile, make sure there are
no amphibian eggs or tadpoles caught init! The algae can be flushed
in a bucket of water first to prevent this fromoccurring. Removing
excess organic material from the bottom of the pond atthe end of the
growing season may help to reduce the amount of nutrientsavailable
for algal growth the next spring. Make sure at this time, that youare
not throwing out the green frog tadpoles.

<P>In the fall all tropical plants must be moved indoors for the
winter. If yourpond is at least two metres deep, then you can move
hardy potted plants intodeeper parts of the pond so that their roots
are found below the frost line.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>C. Mosquitoes</B>

<P>Bt are Bacillus bacteria that are added to your pond and ingested
by softbodied invertebrates. The bacteria interfere with digestion
and the insectlarva dies. Although specific to invertebrates like
mosquitos, some haveexpressed concern over the impact of BT on
beneficial aquatic insects (such asdragonfly and caddisfly larvae),
and even amphibian tadpoles.

<P>Female mosquitos tend to avoid shaded or flowing water preferring
stagnantbackwaters. Bacillus bacteria can be used if control is
necessary, butrealize that mosquitoes are just as likely to be
produced in pop cans oldtires, hollow stumps and buckets. In Ontario
it is probably better tocontinue to live with the problem than to try
to control it. Certainlyencourage birds and bats to roost in your
garden and accept a natural balanceof predator and prey.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<H3><B>11. HOW TO ATTRACT AMPHIBIANS TO YOUR POND</B></H3>

<P>Your wetland is designed for your pleasure and to benefit
wildlife, thereforespecial consideration should be given to the
species of animals you wish toattract. Although most ponds are
specialized for fish and waterfowl, a fewadjustments to your wetland
could transform it into a habitat for endangeredamphibian species.

<P>Besides bringing diversity to your garden, amphibians are good
controllers ofinsect pests.

<P>In contrast to birds, amphibians are completely carnivorous eating
onlyinsects and not the leaves and fruits of your plants. One toad
will eatthousands of insects a year including slugs, beetles,
cutworms, flies,grasshoppers, Gypsy moths, sowbugs, pill bugs,
centipedes, millipedes, molecrickets, ants and earwigs. A single toad
might eat up to 1,500 earwigs in asummer! In addition to the above
insects, larger female toads also tackleJapanese beetles and June
bugs. Although a toad will unfortunately eat theoccasional beneficial
insect, over 81% of its diet consists of pest insects(Organic
Gardening, May/June 1994). Toads are not the only amphibians thatcan
help a gardener. If you are close to a permanent body of water you
mightlure insect eating frogs to your yard. Salamanders, the third
branch of theamphibian family, will eat slugs, grubs, worms, spiders,
beetles, ants mosquitoes and many other insects.

<P>The American toad is our model urban amphibian. It spends most of
its adultlife on land and thrives in our gardens. Toads hibernate on
land below thefrost line and breed in warm, shallow temporary ponds
or the shallowshorelines of larger wetlands. Our choice for a model
rural amphibian(including the American toad) is the green frog which
requires permanent waterfor the tadpole which takes two years to
develop into a mature frog. Thetadpole and adult frog thrive in deep,
warm rich wetlands and ponds like thoseoften found around farms. They
hibernate underwater and require water thatdoes not freeze to the
bottom.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>11.1 Vegetation</B>

<P>All ponds need time to develop into good amphibian habitat. New
ponds cannotreplace the complex ecosystems of established wetlands.
This is why it isbest to protect existing ponds and wetlands. The
quality of habitat improveswhen plants and algae are established, and
when decomposed plant and animalmatter has settled to the bottom,
forming a source of nutrients for tadpolesand aquatic life.

<P>Plants provide sources of food and shelter for a number of animal
species.Plants must suit the soil type, moisture levels, and how much
sunlight thereis in your garden.

<P>Planting should be done in moistened soils and with plants dug no
more thantwo days prior (and kept cool and damp). With appropriate
approvals, clods ofplants can be dug from existing wetlands. If you
are removing plants from awetland destined for destruction remove
strips of vegetation including theunderlying soil profile if
mechanical removal is possible. If you areplanting individual plants,
Picov Water Gardens suggests that one 10 cm pottedaquatic plant every
2 meters squared would be adequate. Slowly raise waterlevels to match
the growth rate of plants or elevate plants on bricks untilthey grow
enough to be lowered into deeper water. If the new plants are"topped"
with water they become stressed and will grow poorly or die
(However,this is one way of eliminating invasive plants like
cattails). The shorelineneeds to be graded to provide a variety of
elevations that match the depthtolerances of the plants you want to
grow. Remember that your long termobjective is to take individual
plants and create a plant community thatreflects the local
hydrological conditions.

<P>If your pond contains insufficient sediment to grow rooted plants,
pottedplants can be placed along the edges. You should place your
plants in potswith 8 cm of organic material and top it off with 2-5cm
of coarse clean sand.Placing your plants in pots also prevents them
from taking over your pond. Ifyou have insufficient sand on the
bottom to root plants, wrap the plant rootsand soil ball in burlap
with a few stones to weight it down. Sew up thesides. Roots will grow
through the burlap and into the sand as the burlapdecays and the soil
ball will be contained by the plant's roots.

<P>Submerged, aquatic plants are important egg laying sites and
provide cover forfrogs and tadpoles. A general rule of thumb to use
when determining thenumber of plants required for your pond is one
water lily and three bunches of pond plants per square meter of pond
surface (Merilees 1989). Make sure mostof the green pond plants are
oxygenating plants which help keep a balancednutrient cycle in the
pond.

<P>Include an island of rocks or a weathered stump set in about a
meter from theedge of the pond. These areas can be used as resting
places, safe frompredators such as raccoons and pets.

<P>To improve the area around the pond, place native emergent plants
around theedge to provide cover for adults and emerging toadlets and
froglets. Sandysoils are nutrient poor and attract different plants
than clays or richorganic soils, that may originate in your compost
bin. Large emergent plantsshould be placed on the north side and at
the back of the pond so that they donot hinder your view. If you are
worried about the safety of children and/orpets, a thick boundary of
plants around your pond will discourage them fromapproaching the
edge. Trees should be planted some distance from the southernedge of
the pond because excessive shading reduces wild life diversity
andproductivity. Any dead timber should be left standing since it
provideshabitat for such species as beetles and woodpeckers.

<P>Aquatic plants rarely grow below 2 meters, unless the water is
very clear. Most emergents are found in water 5 to 30 cm deep.
Submerged plants typically are found in a zone 0.5 to 1.0 m deep. If
excess nutrients become a problem, let duckweed grow to shade out
algae and rake off periodically for nutrient rich compost.

<P>Trees, shrubs, flowers and water plants that are native to Ontario
are,generally speaking, better adapted to local climate and soil
conditions andmore resistant to local disease and pests than are
exotic species. Nativestock requires less of your time and money to
maintain, and stands a betterchance of healthy growth than most
exotic species. Exotic or non-nativeplants often provide little or no
value to wild life as a food source.However, non-invasive ornamentals
are quite appropriate where your goal is toprovide a water feature as
part of a backyard garden. Exotics are oftenaggressive due to the
lack of natural controls in their new habitat. In turn,non-native
plant species often out compete or choke-out our native
species.Invasive plant species include Flowering Rush, Eurasian water
milfoil andPurple Loosestrife.

<P>Purple Loosestrife is threatening wetland habitats by taking over
the wetlandand choking out all native plant species and animals which
feed them. PurpleLoosestrife is a deep-rooted perennial, 1-2 meters
tall, and has severalsquare and woody stalks per plant. The entire
plant must be removed tominimize the chance for regrowth. Dig out the
root mass, making sure you haveremoved all pieces. Once removed, it
must be dried in a safe place (plasticbag) and then either burned,
packaged for disposal or composted. If it's notfeasible to remove the
plant then you can retard its spread by removing theflowers before
they seed. If you like the "look" of the plant, you mayreplace Purple
Loosestrife with Spiked Speedwell, Spiked Gayfeather or GardenSage.
Ducks Unlimited Canada has produced a pamphlet containing a
"reportform" to be filled out when you see Purple Loosestrife (phone
# &amp;amp; Fax inappendix).Delay drawdowns to late summer as
loosestrife thrives in themudbanks of early summer drawdowns.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>We do not recommend that you take plants from a local wetland. In
doing soyou bring some beneficial plants and invertebrates to your
ecosystem, but youmay also bring over unwanted plant and animal
species.

<P>Most emergents including trees and shrubs tolerate spring and fall
floodingbut suffer during the growing season if water levels do not
drop. Grassestolerate shallow flooding (2-5 cm).

<P>Look at local wetlands for species likely to grow in your area and
buy localstock grown in soils with a similar water regime.

<P>Select a variety of marsh and swamp species depending on the
desired habitat.Most emergents germinate from seed banks exposed in
warm muds as waterrecycles. Seed banks take 3 to 4 years to fully
develop and the first animalcommunities to establish.

<P>To control weedy species, such as Typha and Phragmites, deeper
water contourswill prevent invasion; flooding to 40-50 cm will
prevent expansion ofcattails; or cutting stalks (preferable cut off
at ground level) and thentopping by raising water levels above the
cut stems for several weeks (or overwinter) will kill extensive
stands of the plants.

<P>It may be necessary to temporarily flood the newly seeded area or
developingseed bank species with 2-5 cm of water to kill terrestrial
invaders . Afterinundation for one week, water levels are lowered.
This lowering and raisingof water levels will determine which species
survive as long as care is takennot to flood desirable emergents. The
control of terrestrial invaders inswamps may be accomplished by
increasing the frequency, but not the depth orduration, of flooding.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>11.2 Other amphibian shelters</B>

<P>A few rock piles and logs around the pond will provide shelter and
refugesfrom predators.

<P>Place lawn edging around window wells so that amphibians do not
fall intothese death traps. If this is not possible, place rocks or
logs so thatamphibians can climb out.

<P>All amphibians require water to survive. Besides building a pond
in yourbackyard, you can provide moisture by having shady areas where
dew collects,moist patches of soil and/or rotting vegetation. Let the
edges of your gardengrow wild with cover giving amphibians places to
hide from the hot sun. Oneman built a Toad Abode, with a piece of
wood. When placed in a cool part ofthe garden, toads sat under the
two inch opening enjoying bugs attracted tothe dark.

<P>Rocky retreats for toads can be made by placing stones to form a
rocky burrowabout 10 centimeters high with a sandy floor where toads
can dig. Use smallsections of brick drain pipe covered with rock or
pieces of concrete blocksbroken to allow access to the toad chamber.
Plant ferns to shade the area or,if it is too dry, a garden sprinkler
can be used to increase moisture levels.

<P>Some nurseries now sell clay toad shelters, but you can make one
yourself out

<P>of a large clay flower pot. Just drill a series of holes where you
want yourtoad size opening to be and chip out the drilled section
with a hammer. Placeone or two of these upturned flower pots in shady
locations in your garden.

<P>You might want to put a toad light (1 m high or less) between
plant or rockgarden and a lawn area to attract insects for the toads.
The light should notbe placed near or in a garden as it may attract
unwanted pests to your garden.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>11.3 Winter Habitats</B>

<P>The hibernating habitat required by an amphibian will depend on
the species.If the amphibian species you wish to attract hibernates
under water (Bullfrog,Pickerel frog, Mink frog, Green Frog, Northern
Leopard frog, Mudpuppy,Northern Two-lined salamander(?)), your pond
will have to be at least 2 metersdeep to prevent it from completely
freezing. A pile of leaf matter should beplaced in your backyard if
Gray Tree frogs, Wood frogs, Spring peepers,Striped Chorus frogs and
Four-Toed salamanders are to hibernate there. TheBlue-Spotted
salamander and the Jefferson salamander hibernate in
undergroundtunnels, log piles and compost heaps. Spotted salamanders
hibernate inunderground tunnels while Red-spotted newts hibernate
under logs. Americantoads hibernate in sandy soil below the frost
line, or in your backyardcompost heap.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>11.4 Converting a Goldfish pond</B>

<P>Fish like to eat amphibian eggs. A few fish may have little impact
on themany eggs that frogs lay but too many exotic fish can devastate
our nativeamphibian species. It has been suggested that feeding fish
may deter themfrom preying heavily on your frogs. When converting
your fish pond into anamphibian pond, first remove the goldfish and
then drain and dry the pond toremove their spawn and fry. Arrange for
sloping sides at surface level, andensure there are plenty of plants
and moist sites around the pond. Then fillit up!!

<P>Don't be disappointed if your backyard toad habitat is not used
immediately.Amphibians have years when they expand their ranges and
poor years when theirrange contracts. The more habitat there is, the
more amphibians will be ableto move and perhaps even discover your
backyard habitat. Do not depletetadpoles from nearby sources to stock
new ponds. With prior approval of localnaturalists or wildlife
experts you may move some tadpoles (about 100 peryear) from a pond to
within three kilometers (one kilometer is the migrationrange for the
common toad!). This will ensure that all amphibians are
locallyadapted to your area. If you want to move tadpoles, contact
the AmphibianInterest Group to be sure that your pond is suitable for
that species.

<P>&nbsp;

<H3>12. HOW TO ATTRACT OTHER WILDLIFE TO YOUR BACKYARD</H3>

<P>Both your pond and backyard can become 'home' to many other
species of animalsbesides amphibians. A rock or earth island will
provide a safe habitat fornesting waterfowl and basking turtles.
Submerged rocks and logs providehabitat for dragonfly and other
insect larvae, while partially submerged logs provide basking areas
for turtles and frogs, and hunting posts for herons.

<P>You can fill your pond's surrounding habitat with butterflies and
hummingbirdsby planting the specific plant species listed in Appendix
A. Birdhouses forboth upland and waterfowl species are often very
successful around ponds.Waterfowl nesting structures and houses can
be placed on poles in the pond toprotect them from predators. Nest
box and structure design can be obtainedfor virtually any native bird
species from the Essex Region ConservationAuthority.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>A. Metro Toronto Zoo Bat Box programme</B>

<P>Bats are the primary predators of night flying insects. Yet the
most abundantspecies of mammal in Canada is losing habitat. It is
preferable to leave batsin their traditional roosts, but by offering
alternative housing in a bat box, we can learn what bats prefer as
roosting sites and what their requirementsare. The Bat Box Program is
geared to helping people understand that bats arean important
component to our ecosystem. It is not meant to encourage peopleto
evict bats from existing dwellings, but act as an alternative housing
forthose who decide to evict their bats. It is necessary to stress
theimportance of people learning to live with bats. For more
information, pleasecontact the Metro Toronto Zoo's Bat Box programme
at the address on the frontcover

<P>Snakes play a very important role in ecosystems. As part of their
diet,snakes eat unwanted rodents and insect pests. Dense foliage
close to theground offers feeding and hiding areas. Snakes overwinter
in exposed bedrock,stone walls, or in earth holes filled with stones
(see attached diagram). Forthose of you worried about attracting
poisonous snakes to your backyard, thereis only one poisonous snake
in Ontario - the Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake.This endangered
species is restricted to a narrow 25 kilometer strip along theshores
of Georgian Bay, Lake Huron and Lake St.Clair.

<P>You should be ecstatic every time you see a new animal in your
backyardbecause it means you are that much closer to having your own
balancedecosystem. Depending on the size and location of your pond,
naturalsuccession over the years may allow your pond to become home
to rabbits, deer,muskrats, bats, mink turtles, snakes, crayfish,
geese , ducks , herons,dragonflies . These animals are important
dispersal agents for plants. Overtime you should notice an increase
in diversity of plant species in yourcreated wetland.

<P><B>HELP - PROBLEMS AND CONCERNS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION THROUGH
LETTERS FROM HOMEOWNERS.</B>

<P>1. What sort of precautions can be taken to prevent frogs living
in yourbackyard from escaping and being killed by cars?

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Try and locate your pond away from the road. Surround
your pond with a richhabitat so that the frogs do not need to migrate
to find food or a winteringhabitat. Frogs will not generally leave
their pond as they require very moistconditions to survive. Toadlets,
on the other hand, can withstand dryer conditions and so disperse out
of their maternal pond to find new feedinghabitat.

<P>Toads lay 5,000 eggs. Most of these are destined to die. Despite
the highmortality on roads, only two frogs or two toads need to
survive to maintainyour amphibian population. Install toad/frog
crossing signs in the area wheretoads/frogs are killed on roads.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>2. Can I have frogs in my backyard if I have a pet dog/cat?

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Dogs and cats will prey on your backyard frogs/toads
unless you protects them.Pets, except for the most aggressive cats
and dogs, usually leave toads alonebecause they are sensitive to the
mild toxins in their skin. Building awooden fence around your pond
will keep dogs, cats and children out of thepond area and will allow
the amphibians to leave the area if they need to findan overwintering
habitat. The fenced-in area should include the pond as wellas
protective habitat. The planting of bushes, flower and grasses
aroundthe outside of the fence is also encouraged to complete your
natural habitat.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>3. What can I do to stop fishermen at cottages from using frogs as
bait, andchildren from torturing them?

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The issue of declining amphibian populations may not
be well known to thefishermen using frogs as bait. Educating
fishermen and the general public onthe global issue of declining
amphibian populations is the step in stoppingthe misuse of
amphibians. By explaining to fishermen, children and othercommunity
members that they are having a negative impact on both a local
andglobal problem, we might be able to convince to leave our
amphibian friendsalone. There are many examples of the
over-collection of frogs for food orbait resulting in the decline of
their population.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>4. Where can I get frogs/toads?

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Amphibians should never be taken from the wild nor
bought at a pet store ornursery. Your pond may not be a suitable
habitat for the species of amphibianyou put in it, and as a result
they will die. For example, bullfrog tadpolesrequire a very specific
habitat to survive because it takes three or moreyears for it to
develop into an adult frog. Very few urban environmentsprovide or can
provide such a habitat for bullfrogs. If your pond provides asuitable
habitat for a particular amphibian species and that species is
foundwithin your bioregion, it will eventually inhabit it. Have a
little patience- it may take a few years!

<P>All amphibians require very specific breeding and overwintering
conditionsunique to each species. Some overwinter in water, and
others on land. Sometolerate ice in their bodies, while others die if
exposed to frost. Youcannot release frogs/toads in any habitat and
expect it to survive.

<P>Another concern is that pet store and nurseries may not be
carrying nativefrog species. The breeding non-native amphibian
species may introduce anunknown virus to our environment resulting in
the destruction of nativeamphibian populations. Viruses are one of
the proposed explanations for theglobal decline in amphibian
populations.

<P>Do not buy from nurseries or pest control companies live frogs,
toads,salamanders or newts. Most of these have been taken from the
wild where theywere doing well and are likely to die in your
backyard.

<P>Why not breed frogs native to Ontario?

<P>Not all amphibians species found in Ontario are native to every
bioregion inOntario. By introducing an amphibian species non-native
to a particularbioregion, you could be endangering frog species
native to that bioregion.This may be due to increased level of
competition for food and shelter, orpredation. For example, bullfrogs
should not be artificially introduced intoyour backyard because their
favorite food is other smaller frogs. Byintroducing bullfrogs to your
backyard, you could be endangering frog speciesnative to your
specific bioregion.

<P>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>5. Is it viable to make a pond even if there are no frogs/toads
around us?

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Yes! Ponds provide habitat for a wide range of animals
and plants. Inaddition, the more ponds that are built in your area
the greater the chancethat an existing amphibian population will be
linked to your backyard wetland.Build a pond and eventually
frogs/toads will come as nearby habitat isoccupied. In the meantime,
enjoy the dragonflies that live in your pond.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>6. Why did my frogs not return this spring?

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The lack of overwintering habitats is the most likely
reason why your frogsdid not return this spring. As described in this
book, each amphibian speciesrequires a specific overwintering
habitat. If this habitat is not presentthan the amphibian species
will freeze to death.

<P>Other possible reasons explaining the disappearance of your frogs
this springis a natural death. Often "your" frog/toad simply moved to
another habitat -with patience other frogs/toads may return.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>7. Will frogs/toads survive in ponds with muskrats, beaver, otter,
herons andducks?

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Although otter, herons and ducks do eat amphibians,
they will survive in awetland which contain them. Frogs/toads are a
source of food for manyanimals, and so produce thousands of eggs.
Some will survive predation andgrow to be sexually mature adults.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>8. Will frogs survive in ponds containing fish?

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>A number of fish species eat amphibian eggs. Because
most backyard ponds arevery small in comparison to natural wetland
ecosystems (where frogs obviouslylive with fish), we do not recommend
that you put fish in a pond that wascreated to attract amphibians. If
you wish to have both frogs and fish inyour backyard, why not build
two ponds? Of course, one fish cannot breed andwill probably co-exist
well with our native amphibians.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>9. If my pond is not deep enough for the frogs/toads to hibernate,
what do Ido with them?

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Do not try to keep frogs in your pond if it is not
deep enough (at least 1.5metres) to prevent it from completely
freezing. Toads do not hibernate inyour pond, but do hibernate in
sandy soils and backyard compost heaps. Frogsthat do hibernate in the
bottom of ponds will not inhabit a pond that willcompletely freeze
during the winter. Pond hibernating frogs will freeze todeath if they
are introduced into a shallow pond, unless a large deep pond isfound
nearby for them to move into for the winter. If you have
alreadyintroduced pond hibernating frogs to your pond and don't have
a wintering pondnearby, then you might want to move them into an
indoor aquarium for thewinter.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>10. Will frogs/toads survive in an aquarium?

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Frogs and Toads will survive in an aquarium if their
required habitatconditions are re-created. Adult frogs/toads will
require both water and dryland. An aquarium is essential to create a
humid environment. Adultfrogs/toads can survive on live store bought
crickets as long as they arepowdered with a vitamin supplement. A
frog/toad will develop rickets withoutthis vitamin supplement. Make
sure you do not crowd the frogs in an aquariumas they will become
stressed.

<P>We do not recommend that amphibians (or any animal) is taken out
of the wild.Animals can become stressed when taken out of their
natural environments, anddevelop stress-related diseases which may
lead to death. Rest assured thatyou are helping wildlife by creating
the habitat that sustains them.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>11. What can I do about all the mosquitoes breeding in my pond?

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Mosquitoes tend to breed in still waters. A solution
to this problem isBacillus thuringiensis or Bt. Bt is a naturally
occurring bacteria found inthe soil which has become a very popular
form of organic pest control withcommercial-scale organic growers.
Each subspecies of Bt has been found tokill a different insect or
type of insect. Bt only works when it is ingestedby the pest, at
which time it paralyzes the mouth parts and stops it fromfeeding. Bt
releases a deadly protein that tears up the insect's gut liningwhich
causes it to die. Bt israelensis is what is used to kill
mosquitolarvae. It is crucial that the Bt be applied when the larvae
first appear.

<P>Caution should be taken when using Bt. Although it claims that
will not harmmammals nor the fish in your pond, it is unclear how Bt
will affect amphibiansor other invertebrates..</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>12. What can I do about raccoons? They're eating all my
frogs/toads!

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Raccoons love to eat frogs and toads. If you have a
high population ofraccoons in your neighbourhood, you might want to
build your pond with anisland in the center. This island will allow
some of your toads/frogs andother wildlife to take refuge. If your
pond is already built, you can form acentral island with rocks - but
be careful if you have a liner! Otherwise youwill have to let nature
take its course, and hope that the raccoons have lefta few
frogs/toads to breed in your pond next year.

<P>Remember it is natural for raccoons to prey on aquatic species
like frogs andtoads. It is only when raccoon populations get out of
control in urban areas,that their numbers have a significant impact
on frogs/toads. We have someresponsibility for the number of raccoons
and can reduce the number of refuges(such as unkept out-buildings and
sheds) that raccoons require foroverwintering and raising their
young. We must learn to live with thewildlife species that find our
modifications of urban environments to theirliking. Some have
suggested that backyard ponds will encourage raccoons.Raccoons will
visit your pond but the pond itself is not responsible forraccoons.
All good wetlands have raccoons that visit on a nightly basis andyou
should be pleased that your wetland mimics what happens every night
atevery wetland.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>13. How do I make my pond safe for children?

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>If you are concerned about the safety of small
children you may want torestrict access with a natural looking fence
(cedar rail) and gate. Largerocks can be submerged just below the
waterline restricting access to deeperwater (the rocks also provide
refuge for frogs and their tadpoles and make iteasier for wild life
to enter and exit the pond).

<P>Homeowners are also encouraged to teach water safety. Even if no
ponds werecreated as wild life habitat, our communities are dotted
with backyard poolsand water courses. Most Canadian children will
have access to lakes, rivers,and swimming pools at some time in their
life. An awareness of the potentialdanger and how to act responsibly
around water will benefit our children andthe wild life that depends
upon water for its survival.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>14. What can we do to help declining amphibian populations?

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>There are a number of things you can do to help
declining amphibianpopulations: protect existing wetlands, especially
woodland wetlands and wetmeadows; protect existing natural areas;
restore existing or once existingwetlands; build wetlands; talk to
children, neighbours, Parks employeesand/or industries about your
concerns; participate in the Canadian WildlifeService Amphibian
Monitoring Programmes; and of course, Metro Toronto Zoo'sAdopt-A-Pond
Wetland Conservation Programme.This book outlines these activities in
more detail.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<h2>"oclist@evergreen.ca":<p>
The Outdoor Classroom eMail list_serv </h2>


<b>The Outdoor Classroom list_serv facilitates discussion via eMail about the School Ground as an outdoor learning environment: from involving students in the creating and maintaining of natural areas to teaching the curricula outdoors to informal play. 

<p>In addition to teachers, students, parents and school boards, there are a growing number of people, non-profits and government agencies which deal with these issues, from schoolyard habitat & greening-the-school programs which focus on bringing nature back to the school (or even simply beautification) to composting and Project Wild-type teacher training programs.

<p>"oclist" provides an opportunity for all of these people to ask questions, share stories and learn about eachothers programs & school projects, school board policies, curriculum integration, anti-vandalism initiatives, fundraising ideas, summer maintenance and more.

</b>

<p><br>
<h3>WHAT IS A LIST_SERV?</h3>
A list_serv automaticly forwards email to a group of people to facilitates discussion on a certain topic or topics. 
<p>
People "subsciber" to the list (add their email address to the list). Anyone on the list can send an email to the list_serv address (oclist@evergreen.ca), which gets "bounced" out to those people on the list.

<p><br>
<h3>WHY IS A LIST_SERV USEFUL?</h3>
<UL>
	<LI>A very easy way to facilitate people asking questions, sharing their stories or daily observations, problems, successes etc..

<p>	<LI>The list is automated, and requires very little attention by The Evergreen Foundation

<p>	<LI>List_serv's are very popular forums for discussion on the Internet.

Classroom, California</a>, has a pond located in a 180ft courtyard of a typical circa
1950s-60s style school.  The courtyard suffered from serious drainage
problems due to runoff from the roof.  The people at Hooker Oak used this
to their advantage and created a wonderful wetlands outdoor classroom.

	This is a listing of butterflies that are likely to be seen in
a Lower Mainland butterfly garden. There is no data available on their 
populations, and some of those that migrate from Oregon and California 
seem to fluctuate quite significantly in numbers from year to year. It may be 
possible for students at Hyland to join with students at Eagle Harbour School 
in West Vancouver in tagging butterflies for original research on their 
migration patterns. Nobody knows if these migrants from the south, such as 
the Red Admiral, return back there again for the winter.

<H3>November 18 '96</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Moving through the cycles of life at Evergreen:</H3>

<H3><IMG SRC="goodbyemarthakev.jpeg" X-SAS-UseImageWidth
X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>After over 5 years of
crazy, rewarding work, co-founder Kevin McLaughlin is retiring from
the day-to-day duties as Director of the Vancouver office to pursue
new challenges in art, software, media, music, ecology and Life. With
a little help from William Gibson, his
<A HREF="mailto:digitalkev@evergreen.ca"> digital construct</A> now
maintains this web site.</H3>

<H3>Evergreen's Vancouver office has been through a number of seasons
since it began over three years ago, with a little help from Toronto
and Vancouver Foundation in James Dungate's parent's house. For the
last year and a half, <A HREF="mailto:martha@evergreen.ca">Martha
Norman</A> has been crucial to the blossoming success which it has
experienced. She brought an intelligent, dedicated and balanced
approach to the Vancouver team at a time when the future of the
office was still quite tenuous - and made it work. It is with a very
heavy heart that Evergreen has had to face the realities of
non-profits in Canada and not be able to renew Martha's contract. We
wish her well on her dream of running a native plant nursery.</H3>

<H3>The newest member of Evergreen's Team,
<A HREF="mailto:kylie@evergreen.ca">Kylie Hutchinson, Development
Manager, B.C. office</A> has joined Evergreen to handle the
fundraising, strategic planning and administration duties in
Vancouver. If you want to support Evergreen's efforts to connect
people with nature in B.C. by making a donation, she's the one to
talk to.</H3>

<H3>Geoffrey Cape, co-founder and Executive Director, fresh from
saying "I do" but needing a solid break to recharge his batteries
after six years of making Evergreen happen, is taking a well-deserved
two month sabatical avec sa partenaire Valerie. Bon voyage!</H3>

<H3><BR>

</H3>

<H3><LI>Setting an leadership example for School Boards across
Canada, the <A HREF="nscalgaryguidelines.html">Calgary Board of
Education</A> has developed guidelines for School Ground
Naturalization projects. Although what the guidelines set out is also
important, the very fact that they exist makes it easier for schools
to organize a project (because the requirements of the Board are
neither arbitrary nor changing).</H3>

<H3><LI>The Outdoor Classroom eMail listserv question of the month:

<UL>
   <LI>Hi, we're from <A HREF="mailto:sand@planet.eon.net">Belgravia
   Elementary School</A> in Edmonton, Alberta and we're just
   beginning a school learning grounds project. We have students,
   parents and teachers on the committee. As students on the
   committee, we would like to communicate with other interested
   students who have done or are doing a school learning grounds
   project. We are meeting again on November 22 and are interested in
   how you gathered information from students and also how you
   communicated the project progress to the students.

<P>On November 12, 1996 agreements were formally ratified which will
see the Nature Conservancy Canada undertake fundraising to provide
the North Van. School District with the funds to complete the
purchase of NVOS property. In turn, the School Board will register a
Protective Environmental Covenant on NVOS lands protecting its Bald
Eagle and Salmon habitat while maintaining its use as an
environmental and cultural study centre. (This area has registered
the world recordsingle day eagle count.)</P>

<P>The School Board, NVOS Staff and community believe that this a
final step in ensuring financial stability for NVOS. It is an
important milestone in all of the efforts that have been undertaken
to secure the future of North Vancouver Outdoor School for the
present and the future.</P>

convicted still stands. The Canadian Environmental Defense Fund

<P><LI>After five years, The Evergreen Foundation has decided to
change the name of our national program to transform Canadian school
grounds in natural learning environments. Formally called SCHOOL
GROUND NATURALIZATION, the program will now be called
<A HREF="nspage.html">LEARNING GROUNDS.</A> Same great idea, people
and resources, just a new name.</P>

<P>The National Program Manager, Ms. Roben Stikeman, felt that a new
name would help to communicate how the program had evolved from a
focus simply on bringing native trees and shrubs to the school ground
into a more holistic approach to creating healthier, natural learning
environments for students - including the need to tie the curriculum
to the new spaces to ensure long term success.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>"Hi. I'm really new at this. I am a teacher in Oklahoma City,
   and we have just received some money to put together an outdoor
   classroom. We are designing it with several different "pods" or
   areas, and I have been given a budget for a time and measurement
   area. I am looking for ideas, and I don't even know where to start
   looking. Do you have any ideas? Have any of you put a time and
   measurement area in your outdoor class? Is there somewhere else I
   can search to find ideas? It is a K-8 classroom that will be used
   by 1-5 primarily. I appreciate any help you can give!!! Thanks,

One of the wonderful things about naturalizing a school ground is that it is 
not a quick and simple process.  Transforming a bare rectangle into a natural 
oasis takes time, hard work,  lots of energy and the consensus of many stakeholders. 
 That said, natural outdoor classrooms can provide students, teachers and the 
 community with a healthy environment to play and learn and an opportunity to 
 experience how a committed group of people can work together to improve their 
 community environment.
 <P>
Creating a naturalized school ground is a educational process that is as  
important as the 'finished' site.  Students especially, when involved in 
the process, can develop research, communication, consensus building, and 
leadership while developing pride and a sense of belonging.  If you can keep 
that in mind as you go along you may find that your energy level and optimism 
remain high and that you have a lot of fun too!
 <P>
 
The first thing to remember when getting started is to be open-minded.  
No single individual can devise a plan to suit all the school's needs.  
It is crucial that you involve all the affected parties including students, parents, 
teachers, custodial staff, administrators and members of the immediate community.  
An open forum and steering committee meeting can enable all the voices to be heard 
and provides a venue for everyone to work towards a collective vision. 

  <P><A HREF="resnsykchrist.html"><IMG SRC="nsykchristkingheader.gif" align=left border=0></a>

Many schools have demonstrated that projects can be implemented at low to no-cost.  
For instance, the tools can be borrowed or donated, plants can be grown from seed 
or propagated from clippings that the students collect with the help of a local 
naturalist.  Lumber and nails can be donated or scavenged, in fact many materials 
can be recycled for use in the project. Earth can be donated and  advice and time 
can be sought from students, parents, members of the community.
 <P>
Funding, if you need it, is available from a variety of sources including: Canada 
Trust-Friends of the Environment Program, Global reLeaf-Friends of the Earth 
Program, Canadian Wildlife Federation-Habitat 2000 Program and the Evergreen 
Foundation .  Create a proposal with a clear set of goals and objectives and 
include as much information as you can, such as: a timeline, a plan of the 
site and a list of the materials and native species you wish to plant.  
It is useful to demonstrate the student involvement and how the site will be 
used and maintained.     
 <P>
Be ready to answer questions about the project, and have the facts so that you 
can address concerns and criticisms that wary parents and school neighbors may 
have.  Most  concerns can be addressed through a carefully planned site design.  
Involve a local landscape architect if you like, but keep in mind that students 
should be consulted as much as possible in the design process, after all it's their  
place.
  <P>
  <A HREF="resnsnbbessborough.html"><IMG SRC="nsnbbessboroughsunflower.jpeg" align=right border=0></a>
Some commonly asked questions can include:
<UL>
	<LI>"Will the new school ground look unkempt?"   
	Natural areas, by their nature, are not as neat and 
	tidy as manicured gardens but if the site is well marked and 
	the signage clear on the purpose of the project, people will 
	be more understanding and perhaps even interested! 

	 <P><LI>"Will a wild space be difficult for teachers to monitor?"  
	No, not if you design the school ground to encourage visibility .  
	Create a well delineated entrance to the area, include paths and 
	consider the size of the plants in relation to where they will be 
	planted.  Our fears should not rob kids of valuable life experiences, 
	instead we should look for creative solutions.

	 <P><LI>"Won't  kids get hurt in this type of school ground?"  
	Kids have been  scraping, cutting, and bruising themselves for 
	years on asphalt.  A naturalized school ground is softer and bump 
	and knock accidents are usually reduced. Design a even-ground path, 
	areas for seating to accommodate quiet moments, and plant areas for shade cover.   If you are worried about creating a pond there are many successful examples in existence and help can found through the Adopt-A-Pond Program at the Metro Toronto Zoo.  Use this opportunity to discuss safety issues with the students,  after all if we can't teach them at school where will there learn? 
</UL>
 <P>
Remember to; start small, stay open-minded, include all stakeholders, plan, 
and enjoy both the process of creation and the results.

<P>Although as much as 25% of a child's time at school is spent
outdoors, traditionally school grounds have not been designed with
learning in mind. Learning Grounds is a national program which, since
1993, has been helping schools to transform parts of their
traditional asphalt and turf grass grounds into inspiring places of
learning and play. Planting trees, growing plants that will attract
birds and<A HREF="resnsbcbilange5_1.html"><IMG
SRC="littledragonfly.gif" WIDTH=57 HEIGHT=45 X-SAS-UseImageWidth
X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=0 ALIGN=right></A> butterflies, creating
art features and play structures are all ways to enhance and improve
the diversity of students' learning experiences. Creating outdoor
classrooms and maintaining these areas provide an excellent
opportunity for students to observe, participate in and learn from a
changing, complex environment. The goal is to encourage people to go
beyond simply beautifying and use school grounds as a tool for
learning!</P>

<P><B>The benefits of a more natural school ground include:</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>a place to learn about 'the environment' as an interconnected
   series of relationships;
   
   <LI>a living example of a developing ecosystem;
   
   <LI>an opportunity for experience-based learning;
   
   <LI>protection from exposure to harmful UV rays;
   
   <LI>a less hostile and more creative area for play;
   
   <LI>a reduction in violence and vandalism among students and the
   community;
   
   <LI>a reduction in maintenance requirements &amp; chemical use;
   
   <LI>an excellent model for environmental rehabilitation and
   community stewardship.

<p><br>

<H3><a name = Guideline>4.0 Guideline for the Collection and Use of Native Plants</a></H3>
<p>

4.1 Use local Genotypes
<UL>
	<LI>4.1.1 Use plants and seed species native to Alberta.
	<LI>4.1.2 Select plants from econological zone (see map on Page 9).
	<LI>4.1.3 Avoid wildflower mixes.  These usually contain species that are wild in Europe or other parts of North America, but not Alberta.  Some species, such as Ox-eye Daisy or Birdsfoot Trefoil, are potentially invasive.
</UL>

4.2 Use Weed-Free Material
<UL>
	<LI>4.2.1 Make sure seed is purchased from a reputable dealer and is free of all restricted, noxious or nuisance weeds. 
</UL>

4.3 By Nursery-Propagated Material
<UL>
	<LI>4.3.1 Insure that plants are nursery propagated and not collected from the wild.
</UL>

4.4 Where to Collect
<UL>
	<LI>4.4.1 Avoid protected lands such as national, provincial and municipal parks and protected natural areas.  Please note that it is illegal to collect from many of these areas.
	<LI>4.4.2 Obtain necessary permits to collect on forestry reserves.
	<LI>4.4.3 Obtain permission from the landowner or lease holder to collect on private or leased land.
	<LI>4.4.4 Avoid busy highways and roads.  Roadside collecting is dangerous and may encourage indiscriminate collecting by others.
	<LI>4.4.5 Avoid rare or fragile habitats such as sand-dunes or wetlands.
	<LI>4.4.6 Where possible, collect from areas destined to be developed or destroyed in the near future.  Obtain permission from the landowners or lease holders.
</UL>

4.5 Know Your Species
<UL>
	<LI>4.5.1 Know the flora of the area before you collect  avoid rare or endangered species unless they are threatened by development, etc.
	<LI>4.5.2 Identify the plants before collecting seeds or cuttings.
	<LI>4.5.3 Collect common species or those with a large population.
	<LI>4.5.4 Avoid collecting single specimens or from small populations with fewer than 50 plants.
</UL>

4.6 Collect Seeds or Cuttings, Not Plants
<UL>
	<LI>4.6.1 Collect seeds or cuttings, not entire plants (unless essential for identification).
	<LI>4.6.2 Flag or label plants with a marker while in bloom, or be able to identify plants in seed.  (Note that deer and elk are known to eat surveyors tape.)
	<LI>4.6.3 Collect undamaged, ripe seeds (firm, plump and dry).
	<LI>4.6.4 Leave 50% of the seed in place to allow natural propagation, and to provide food and habitat for insects, birds and small mammals.
	<LI>4.6.5 Do not intensely collect the same area year after year.
	<LI>4.6.6 In areas that may be subjected to further collecting by the general public or where grazing reduces natural regeneration, collecting should be minimal (from no more than 10% of the plants).
</UL>

<H3><a name = Installation>5.0 Installation</a></H3>
<p>
5.1 Options
<p>
The objective is to have the landscape properly installed so it will be safe to use and of low maintenance.  It is the suppliers responsibility to ensure this and, consequently, to make good any deficiencies noted in the inspections.

<UL>
	<LI>5.1.1 C.B.E. Installation<br>


This is the preferred route since all experienced people will be involved, and the likelihood of mistakes will be reduced.

<LI>5.1.2 Sponsoring Group Installation<br>

This route is frequently chosen because it benefits both sponsor and supplier (if no money is spent on labour, more can be spent on materials).
<p>
A qualified horticulturist must be part of the group and in charge of construction (even if the group has to hire someone in this capacity).
</UL>


5.2 Site Preparation
<p>
The most important factor in any planting of native prairie species is proper site preparation.
<p>
Native plants are well adapted to our prairie environment, having lived here for thousands of years in a stable community, but they are no match for the host of non-native weeds.  These aggressive species have the ability to muscle out nearly anything that grows, particularly on disturbed soil.
<p>
To have a successful prairie garden or restoration, these invasive weeds must be brought under control before planting begins.  Elimination of perennial weeds is of paramount importance.  The site must be clean and weed free as they compete with your prairie plants for light and moisture.
<p>
The type of weed control measures depends upon your plot.  Small plots can be worked over with a rototiller every week for two to three months during the growing season.  Black plastic can be staked out as a ground cover to kill weeds.
<p>
Larger plots can be cultivated as in summer fallowing.  Roundup or other herbicides may be used for problem areas that cannot be controlled by other means.
<p>
The site should be smooth and well packed to ensure the seeds have good soil contact.  A good rule of thumb is that the soil is firm enough to plant if your footprint barely registers a 3 mm depression.  June is the best time for planting prairie species.
<p>
For small plots, seed should be broadcast evenly over the whole area and lightly raked or rolled in.  Do not bury the seeds deeply or they will not grow.  Keep well watered until plants are well established.
<p>
Larger areas can be seeded with a seed drill or fertilizer spreader, using an inert carrier like cracked wheat to carry the light fluffy prairie seeds through the machine.  Seed shallowly, no deeper than 1 cm.
<p>
Remember, prairie plants are perennials.  They do not show a great deal of growth above ground in their first year.  They prefer instead to spend their time putting down a deep, extensive root system to help carry themselves through adverse conditions like drought and cold.  Be patient  prairie takes its time in establishment  from two to five years will be needed if you start from seed.  Wild seeds have quite variable germination rates as a survival mechanism to ensure that they all do not germinate at the same time.  If you require an instant prairie, seedling plants will mature more quickly.
<p>
Mowing as necessary during the growing season high enough to avoid most prairie seedlings, but low enough to cut off the heads of weeds before they mature, will help your planting along.
<p><br>

5.3 Planting Native Seed
<p>
Several factors affect the germination of native prairie seed.  Being wild seed, the viability will vary.  Wild seeds do not have as predictable a germination rate as common annual vegetable or cultivated species, which have been selected over many generations for easy and quick germination.  Prairie species are nearly all perennials, and perennials take longer to grow than annuals.
<p>
Before planting your native seed, some form of pre-treatment usually is necessary for best germination.  Some species require a period of cool and damp for several weeks (stratification).  Others need to have a tough outer seed coat gently scratched to allow moisture to get to the embryo (scarification).
<p>
Light plays a very important role in successful germination.  Prairie seeds need to be at or very near the soil surface in order to receive enough light to germinate.  Planting too deeply will inhibit sprouting.
<p>
Water is crucial to the growth of any plant and prairie species are no exception.  Seedlings need adequate moisture supplies to begin their lives.  Too much water, however, may promote damping off.
<p>
The soil temperature also is an important factor.  If the soil is too warm or cold, seeds will remain dormant.  Room temperature is the best.

<center><h1> COMMUNITY CHAMPION program </h1></center>

The Evergreen Foundation began developing this program in late 1995. 
We are looking for landscape architects, ecologists, teachers, master gardeners
		and anyone else who wants to help a school project in their community. <p>
		
		Across Canada, people are clamouring to enhance their local environments, but 
		they lack the skills and resources. The COMMUNITY CHAMPION program is being
		developed as
		a network of people with skills and the willingness to volunteer them 
		to help schools create
		more natural, healthier school grounds. <p>
		
		If you are interested in becoming a COMMUNITY CHAMPION or know of any similar
		programs in your community to which we could refer people (eg Master Gardeners)
		please contact <A HREF="mailto:info@evergreen.ca">Roben or Michelle</a> in Toronto, or 
		<A HREF="mailto:sgn-bc@evergreen.ca">Tammy</a> in Vancouver.

People all over the world will be

<p>
<center><h2>Community Naturalization Program</h2></center>
<p>
The Evergreen Foundation's Community Naturalization Program is a regional 
program in the Toronto and Vancouver areas designed to make communities 
aware of the benefits of natural areas in their cities. The Evergreen Foundation  
creates partnerships to rehabilitate nature in parks and open spaces, creating 
healthier, more educational and livable environments. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="nc2kids.gif" align=left hspace=10 border=0>Education and awareness is centered around the planting and maintenance of 
native trees, shrubs and wildflowers. These events are designed to be hands-on 
learning experiences, converting existing marginal and turf spaces into 
functioning natural areas including wildflower meadows, woodlands, and 
marshes. 
<P>
The educational component also includes in-school and community-group 
presentations, public displays, mass-media communications and annual 
"Ground Works" conferences on reconnecting people with nature in their 
communites (for ecologists, landscape architects, parks departments and 
community organizers). 
<P>
Planting takes place in the spring and fall, with extensive monitoring and 
maintenance programs throughout the summer. The projects occur on land 
owned by corporations, park departments and other municipal land-owning 
agencies including transportation and road departments. Volunteers include 
school groups, community centers, corporate employees, individuals, social 
agencies and more. We are always looking for individual and group volunteers.
<P>
Since 1991, over 15,000 people have planted and helped take care of 29,000 
native trees and shrubs in  the greater Toronto area.  In 1993, an office in 
Vancouver was opened. Since then, nearly 1,000 people have planted 2,000 
trees and shrubs. Currently, The Evergreen Foundation is facilitating school 
and community planting and educational presentations in partnership with the 
Task Force to Bring Back the Don, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region 
Conservation Authority, Metropolitan Toronto Parks and Property, City of 
Toronto Department of Parks and Recreation, Vaughan Parks Department, City 
of Vancouver Parks Department, North Vancouver Parks Department and 
Surrey Parks Department.   
<P>
Community ecology <A HREF="respage.html">resources</A> are also made available to assist projects. These include lists of funding, plants, ecology and landscape design and native nurseries.

<center><H2>Riverdale Park<BR></H2>
<h3> Lower Don River Valley, Toronto </h3></center>

In the fall of 1991, The Evergreen Foundation helped the Task Force to Bring Back 
Don with two community planting events in the park's East side. Native trees and shrubs
were planted along a south facing slope in this old landfill area, which for decades
had been a "green desert" of mown grass. These were the first real planting events
for The Evergreen Foundation, coming after our inaugural event in the spring of 1991,
TREE DAY. It was the launch of Evergreen's Community Naturalization program,
(still active today in many areas of Metro Toronto). Since 1991, Evergreen, the Don Task Force and many, many volunteers and partner organizations
have planted and cared for over 6,000 native trees and shrubs in Riverdale Park.

These photos taken in October 1995 (click for bigger views) look out over the planted areas
south towards Toronto. The trees and shrubs are very healthy, and the area teems
with wildlife.

<p>
Metropolitan Toronto Parks and Culture has since 1990 embarked on a naturalization program which has become one of the largest municipal restoration and planting programs in North America. This program has been developed because of a deep commitment to the belief that these natural landscapes would help to increase the diversity of wildlife habitats, improve aesthetic quality for the region and provide community members and park users with an opportunity to develop a sense of stewardship for these areas. Metro Parks and the Evergreen Foundation have worked together on many of these naturalization projects hoping to contribute to the quality of life for the people of Metropolitan Toronto.

<p>
Since 1990, the Evergreen Foundation has been dedicated to restoring natural areas in the urban environment through education and community action. Evergreen's initiatives in the Greater Toronto Area have involved over 40,000 volunteers in naturalization events. Evergreen's programs work towards reconnecting schools and communities with nature by encouraging them to take an active role in the care and maintenance of their local environment. 
<p>


<b>KeyNote Speaker: The Honourable David Crombie, P.C.<br></b>

Mr. David Crombie offers a unique and inspirational perspective on urban planning and community development. His lifelong dedication to his community includes his roles as a former Alderman and Mayor of the City of Toronto, former MP and Cabinet Minister of several portfolios. Mr. Crombie has most recently concentrated his efforts on the Lake Ontario Waterfront as the Chair of the Waterfront Regeneration Trust.
<p>

<br><h3>Program</h3>


<b>1A Metro Parks Naturalization Program - A Success Story in the Making </b><br>

Garth Armour is a landscape architect and the Manager of Landscape and Design
Services with Metro Parks and Culture. From humble beginnings in 1989, Metro's
Naturalization program has grown dramatically in six years. To date over 45,000
trees, shrubs and wildflowers have been planted in Metro Parks. Garth will review
topics such as: highlights of the program to date, the means and development of a
successful naturalization program, appropriate management strategies and site
selection, the importance of public participation and acceptance and possible
future directions for naturalization programs within Canada.
<p>
<b>1B Leaping Over Partnership Pitfalls</b><br>

Jack Layton was elected in 1994 as the Metro Councillor for Toronto's Don River
Ward. He has been actively involved in urban issues through the Metro Toronto
Housing Company, Metro Cycling Committee, and Planning and Transportation
Committee. Well over one-third of urban land area is controlled by municipal
governments. Therefore, bringing municipal government meaningfully to the table
is essential to partnership management of urban landscapes. Drawing on numerous
examples of partnerships and their pitfalls, Councillor Layton will explore
strategies for making partnerships with municipal governments as successful as
possible and for avoiding common disasters such as: smothered vision, runaway
political agendas, budgetary decapitation and others. 
<p>
<b>1C Habitat Restoration on the Toronto Waterfront </b><br>

Scott Jarvie is the Coordinator of Environmental Projects with the Metro Toronto
Region Conservation Authority. Scott's expertise includes the on-going management
of Tommy Thompson Park (Leslie Street Spit). Recent shoreline regeneration
efforts of the MTRCA focus on the integration of wetland habitat in design and
development of Lake Ontario waterfront parks. Scott will present techniques,
planning and implementation tips for shoreline habitat creation projects,
including habitat features, target species and community outreach. 

Tija Luste has worked for the last three years as Coordinator for Shoreline and
Natural Systems Projects at the Waterfront Regeneration Trust. Realizing a need
for easy-to-use tools and information sources for the community, private citizens
and others interested in habitat restoration, the Trust together with the
Ministry of Natural Resources, developed a habitat restoration manual. Tija will
share examples of pit and quarry restoration, storm water management pond
projects and an overview of the Lake Ontario Greenway Strategy. 
<p>
<b>1D Step-by-Step Process of Site-Level Naturalization/Restoration Planning </b><br>

Jean-Marc Daigle, partner and co-founder of Ecological Outlook Consulting, is a
consulting restorationist, landscape designer, educator, facilitator, amateur
naturalist and writer. This workshop will provide a detailed overview of nine key
steps in planning a project, as described in E.O.C.'s recent publication,
Restoring Nature's Place: A Guide to Naturalizing Ontario Parks and Greenspace.
Steps such as identifying project goals and objectives are crucial to developing
a monitoring and evaluation program. The systematic process underlying this
sequence of steps is designed to ensure that projects are set within a regional
context and restoration framework, and emphasizes the need to restore
locally-indigenous plant communities appropriate to site conditions. This
workshop will provide ample time for participation and discussion. 
<p>
<b>1E Wetland Restoration Design and Construction </b><br>

Glenn Harrington has over 25 years of experience as a landscape architect. As
President of Harrington & Hoyle Ltd., Glenn is responsible for directing the
resource planning, environmental assessment, shoreline/aquatic enhancement, and
storm water management aspects of current projects, including Toronto's Lower Don
Valley, Greenwood Race Track Lands, and slope stabilization utilizing soil
bioengineering techniques throughout the province. 

Glenn will provide an overview of the information required to make decisions
about wetland design including investigation and data collection, types of
wetlands, and construction and management techniques. 
<p>
<b>1F Plant Material and Stock Handling</b><br>

Stephen Smith is a forester with Urban Forest Associates in Toronto, and carries
out ecological restoration projects with community groups and government
agencies. He is presently a director of the Ontario Chapter for the Society for
Ecological Restoration; Project Director of the Rotary Ecosystem Education
Program; and Coordinator of the North York Hydro Tree Power Program. 

This session will cover key points regarding use of native plant material,
including the definition of biologically appropriate stock; problems with exotic
species; sources of stock; advantages and disadvantages, appropriate uses, price
ranges , do's and don't's for some common native species. Steve's tips on stock
handling will include requirements of each stock type to survive and thrive, and
the time of year to plant each type.


<p>
<b>Friday, October 4, 1996 - 1:00 pm - 2:30 pm </b><p>

<b>2A Growing on Wastes: A Success Story and Horticultural Resource </b><br>

Dr. Calvin Chong is a Research Scientist with the Ontario Ministry of
Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, Horticultural Research Institute of Ontario.
Dr. Chong's research program has been directed to solving problems of the
commercial ornamental nursery industry. Recent projects have demonstrated the
benefits of container growing using potting mixes derived from a wide variety or
combinations of composted or uncomposted waste by-products such as: spent
mushroom compost; composted municipal wastes; various types of barks, sawdusts,
and woodchips; paper mill sludges; and waxed corrugated wastes. Dr. Chong will
offer highlights of the program, focusing on waste recycling and promotion of
economically-viable alternative production systems for the nursery industry.
<p>
<b>2B Management and Monitoring of Naturalized Sites </b><br>

Carleton Grant developed the initial Naturalization Monitoring Program for Metro
Parks and Culture, and in his current role as Facility Planning Specialist, is
coordinator of the program. A successful naturalization program requires a
commitment to monitor the establishment and health of the plants. Monitoring
helps to determine the successes and failures of individual projects, while
establishing a mechanism by which to correct the failures. Carleton will draw on
examples from Metro's five year monitoring program, of which four years have been
completed.
<p>
<b>2C Watershed and River System Restorations: A Panel Discussion </b><br>

Join David Stonehouse, of the Task Force to Bring Back the Don, for an insightful

projects while gaining an overview of wateshed restoration work-in-progress.
<p>
<b>2D Naturalization of Ontario Roadsides</b><br>

Lois Banks is a landscape architect with the Central Region Planning and
Environment Section of the Ontario Ministry of Transportation. Over the past
seven years, Lois has supervised and monitored projects to ensure that they are
environmentally sound, focusing on noise mitigation, erosion, wind and snow
control. Her presentation will provide a general overview of MTO's current
practices and policies concerning naturalization specific to roadsides and their
interactions with other agencies.
<p>
<b>2E Front- and Backyard Naturalization Efforts </b><br>

Larry Lamb has been involved in naturalistic landscaping as a consultant,
lecturer, author, and photographer and is currently on the faculty of University
of Waterloo in Environmental Studies. He is co-author with Gail Rhynard of
"Plants of Carolinian Canada", produced for the Federation of Ontario Naturalists
and is a Founding Director and Past President of Canadian Wildflower Society.

This presentation will draw on Larry's own naturalization efforts, which have
received extensive national media coverage, including CBC TV's The Nature of
Things, TV Ontario's Commonground, CBC Radio Morningside, and Canadian Gardening,
Canadian Geographic and Cottage Life. Larry will present the development of a
tall grass prairie ecosystem in his backyard and a northern meadowscape in his
frontyard.
<p>
<b>2F One Municipality's Approach to Public Acceptance of Naturalization Projects </b><br>

Karen Boniface, is the Parks Planner for the Town of Markham, the chairperson for
the Scarborough Environmental Advisory Committee, and member of the Ontario
Association of Landscape Architects, Ontario Parks Association, and the
Scarborough Horticultural Society.

The involvement of local residents, community groups and businesses in the
planning, promotion and execution of naturalization projects is critical to their
success. Working with the public to develop a long term vision for a particular
area is vital for an ongoing commitment to its restoration. Karen will discuss
how this can be accomplished and how to avoid situations like the "NIMBY"
syndrome and deserted projects.
<p>
<b>Saturday, October 5, 1996 - 10:00 am - 11:00 am </b><p>

<b>3A Native Plant Propagation</b><br>

In 1992, the City of Toronto formulated a strategy for the preservation and
restoration of the set of ecoystems known collectively as "High Park". With a
view to preserving the existing gene pool and to helping High Park regenerate, a
native plant propagation program was initiated. Arthur Beauregard is the Plant
Production Coordinator of the City of Toronto High Park Greenhouse. He was a
founding member of the City's "Naturalization Committee" and continues to play a
major role in the implementation of native landscapes throughout Toronto.

Arthur will cover the basic principles and activity sets of native plant
propagation including: determination of species to propagate,
locating/identifying species sites, monitoring for flower and seed formation,
seed collection and storage, seed treatment/germination requirements,
transplanting, holding (nursery) for planting and overwintering. 
<p>
<b>3B Ecological Restoration and Biodiversity </b><br>

Ken Towle is an environmental educator and consultant in conservation biology.
Ken teaches part time at the Faculty of Environmental Studies at York University
and is the President of the Association for Biodiversity Conservation. Recently,
he has completed a report for The Evergreen Foundation entitled "The Role of
Ecological Restoration in Biodiversity Conservation". Restoration activities
inherently have an impact on biodiversity. This presentation will cover some
biodiversity basics and conservation concerns; the role of urban versus rural
landscape plantings; and recommendations to help you design a restoration project
that is certain to have positive results towards biodiversity. 
<p>
<b>3C Roof Greening: Urban Greening through Rooftop Gardening </b><br>

Monica Kuhn is a Toronto architect specializing in small scale residential and
commercial projects, permaculture design, and rooftop gardens. She is a founding
member of the Rooftop Gardens Resource Group, and lectures on the subject of
urban greening. A "lack of land" need not be a barrier to implementing a
naturalization project as demonstrated by Monica's various projects.
Environmental benefits include CO2 reduction, insulation, and stormwater
retention,; and social benefits range from community empowerment to urban food
production.
<p>
<b>3D Community Composting: Transforming Communities </b><br>

As Composting Information Officer with Metro Toronto Works since 1990, Kate
Middleton has worked to develop better composting techniques for Metro residents
in single and multi-unit housing. The Community Composting program, which
originated as a pilot project, has now grown to include community gardens,
schools, allotment gardens, religious institutions, parks, and corporate offices.

Kate will discuss the basics of composting, including problem prevention,
pest-proofing and the application of compost to improve soil quality, using as
examples, a number of compost demonstration sites which have been established in
Metro. The demonstration site at the Civic Garden Centre and a compost outreach
project at the Toronto Parks and Recreation Leslie Street Allotment Garden are
two such examples.
<p>
<b>3E An Aboriginal Perspective on Naturalization of Meadows and Prairies </b><br>

Ken Parker, Owner of Sweet Grass Gardens, tapped into his Native heritage and
interest in horticulture in starting the nursery that deals specifically with
plants indigenous to North America before the Euopean settlement. Ken will
illustrate some example projects that are using native plants in site-specific,
drought resistant landscaping characteristic of meadows and prairies. 
<p>
<b>3F The Changing Role of Foundation Funding </b><br>

Bruce Lourie is the Programme Coordinator of the Laidlaw Foundation's Great Lakes
Conservation Programme and a principal in the firm, Lourie & Love, specializing
in environmental management consulting. 
<p>
Most environmental organizations raise money through a variety of means:
corporations, governments, individual donations and almost always foundations.
Bruce will be discussing the changing role of foundation funding in the light of
public funding cut-backs, including funders' changing expectations. 
<p>
Jane Elliott is the Regional Manager, Toronto and Eastern Canada, of Canada
Trust's Friends of the Environment Foundation. In this role, Jane provides
support to the local chapters of the Foundation in this region, as well as
participating in activities that help to increase awareness for the Foundation.

and funding criteria, including practical information on how to apply to the
Foundation for funding support.
<p>
<b>Saturday, October 5, 1996 - 11:30 am - 12:30 pm </b><p>

<b>4A Volunteer Leadership and Community Involvement: Three Unique Perspectives </b><br>

The Evergreen Foundation's Community Naturalization Program has flourished under
the direction of Kim Dunkelman. Join Kim in a panel discussion with Dr. John
Ambrose, Curator of Botany at the Metro Toronto Zoo, and Dr. Stewart Hilts,
Professor of Land Resource Science at the University of Guelph. 
<p>
General issues regarding the growing need for volunteer community involvement and
potential for stewardship will be discussed in the context of Evergreen's urban
programs involving social service groups, corporations and community groups; the
Metro Zoo's volunteer activities as an important means by which communities can
actively participate in achieving more sensitive land management; and an exciting
new approach to training volunteer rural landowners modelled on the Master
Gardener program. 

<p><b>4B Tree Diversity in Canadian Urban Forests </b><br>

Dr. Andrew Kenney has worked as a forester in Africa, Central America, Coastal
BC, and Ontario, and as Assistant Professor of Urban Forestry directs the Urban
Forests Centre at the University of Toronto. While naturalization programmes are
expanding, emphasizing biodiversity, considerable proportions of the urban forest
continue to be regenerated by conventional planting and landscaping. Dr. Kenney
will address issues related to tree diversity at the genus, species and genetic
level in tree populations in our local urban communities, including the
restrictions that limit our ability to increase diversity; and will provide
guidelines for street tree plantings in the urban environment. 
<p>
<b>4C Alternatives to Chemical Lawn Care: A Local Initiative </b><br>

Since 1991, Janet May has held the Chair of the Urban Pesticide Caucus and
coordinated production of policy papers, action kits and a video about lawn care
pesticides and alternatives. She has directed door-to-door campaigns of Metro
residents to eliminate household toxics and currently is the Coordinator of
Toronto Environmental Alliance's Green Thumb Project, a project to demonstrate
alternative turf management practices for schools, parks and homeowners. 
<p>
Janet will briefly outline the extent of the environmental and health problems
posed by the use of pesticides on urban lawns and will highlight alternatives
such as adopting a plant health care approach to turf grass and planting of
native species and alternate groundcovers. 
<p>
<b>4D Naturalizing a Landscape: One Garden At A Time </b><br>

Lorraine Johnson is a Toronto writer and editor. She has had three books on
environmental issues published, the most recent of which is The Ontario
Naturalized Garden. She is a director of the Canadian Wildflower Society and on
the board of the Civic Garden Centre. She is a regular contributor to Wildflower
magazine, This Magazine, and does a regular gardening column for CBC Radio's
Metro Morning.
<p>
In this illustrated presentation, Lorraine will talk about opportunities to
transform our gardens and lawns into ecologically healthy and diverse places by
planting native species, concentrating on woodland, prairie and meadow
communities.
<p>
<b>4E Legislative Barriers to Naturalization </b><br>

Andrew Wickens is the Manager of Conservation Areas with Metro Toronto Region
Conservation Authority, and is Vice President of Ontario Parks Association. Andy
will discuss the need for action to revise the Weed Control Act and municipal
property by-laws to reduce conflict created through greater naturalization
efforts. These efforts have generally taken the form of changes to maintenance
practices and the planting of native species. The Weed Control Act requires
destruction of noxious weeds, generally designated because of harmful effects on
agriculture, and is in conflict with contemporary trends in park landscaping and
maintenance. Andy has recently had articles appear in Wildflower and GreenSward
magazines and speaks frequently on the need for reform of both the Act and
by-laws.
<p>
<b>4F Your House has Environmental Impact</b><br>

Debra Wright has worked for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation for 16 years
and is currently Senior Advisor of Research and Housing Innovation. Debra hosts a
monthly radio show on healthy housing and is currently working on the selection
of healthy building materials for use in renovation of CMHC's new office. New
leading edge, minimal environmental impact housing technology will be shared
through details of the Toronto Healthy House project. The concept behind this
house is unique and shows how a house can be healthy for the occupants and the
environment. It is not hooked up to water or sewer, uses passive and active solar
heating, and all waste is treated on-site. Tips will be provided on how to
operate your house and garden to have minimal environmental impact; and save
energy, water and money. 
<p><br>

<b>Tours</b>

A selection of tours will highlight naturalization initiatives in progress. Casual dress and appropriate footwear are recommended. Planned tours include:

<UL>

<center><H2> Major Funding Partners  </H2></center>



<p>We extend a heartfelt thank you to the following  who have offered
us tremendous support:

<H4>Environment Canada</H4> 
<p>The Environmental Partners Fund has enabled us to
expand the School Ground Naturalization Program, host a conference series in 7
Canadian cities and publish 2 issues of The Outdoor Classroom, a bilingual
newsletter distributed to schools across the country through a grant of $98,000
over 2 years. It has also allowed us to run an Ecological Stewardship Project at 
Everett Crowley Park, a model for community involvement in the care and restoration of nature to urban park space.

<H4>The J.W. McConnell Family Foundation</H4> 
<p>Providing schools with effective
resources is vital to helping them establish healthy, chemical free learning
environments.  To this end,  The J.W. McConnell Family Foundation has contributed
$150, 000 over 3 years to establish a network of Regional Associates across
Canada, improve our digital resources, and further develop promotional material.

<H4>Roche MaCaulay and Partners Advertising Inc.</H4>
<p> During the past year, Roche
MaCaulay and Partners Advertising Inc.  has helped extend awareness of the School
Ground Naturalization Program through their generous contribution of creative
advertising services.   Print and television campaigns compare images of barren,
concrete playgrounds to bleak prison yards and contrast them with the greener,
more natural school environment that Evergreen encourages.

<H4>Vancouver Foundation</H4>
 <p>One of North America's largest community
foundations, the Vancouver Foundation continues to build community resources in
support of positive change.  Their renewed support of The Evergreen Foundation's
Vancouver office this past year provided an important base from which to build
other partners in British Columbia.

<P><B>What is prairie?</B></P>

<P>The word "prairie" is in common use in France and Quebec in
reference to grassland.  In Belgium and parts of France, prairie may
generally mean a grassy orchard or park with scattered trees.  The
French were first to break free from eastern settlements, voyaging
west and southwest of Montreal and Quebec looking for new land,
routes and souls to save.</P>

<P>Today prairie means an area dominated by native grassland. 
"Native" refers to plants that were here before settlement, and were
not introduced from other countries.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Are there different types of prairie?</B></P>

<P>Yes, there are three different types in Canada, each with their
own characteristic plants adapted to the regional climate:</P>

<OL>
   <LI>	Tallgrass prairie
   
   <P>There are only remnants (&lt;1%) of this once extensive prairie
   that covered much of the richer soils in southern Manitoba before
   settlement.  Efforts are being made to collect seed from these
   remnants, and restore small areas in Manitoba to tallgrass
   prairie.</P>
   
   <LI>	Mixed grass prairie
   
   <P>This grassland is found in drier southern areas of Alberta,
   Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  Because of the arid climate, less of
   the mixed grass prairie has been cultivated.  About 24% remains,
   mostly under government ownership.  This land is leased mainly for
   grazing, although there are other uses, including industrial and
   recreational.</P>
   
   <LI>Fescue prairie
   
   <P>This prairie is found on better soils and wetter climates in
   Alberta and Saskatchewan.  It has been divided into the foothills
   fescue prairie and the northern fescue prairie, which stretches in
   a band across the central portions of these two provinces.  About
   20% of the foothills fescue prairie remains, but only 5% of the
   original northern fescue prairie is left, due to extensive
   cultivation.  This is the prairie type that was originally found
   around Edmonton.</P>
</OL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>What did the settlers think of the prairie?</B></P>

<P>The French loved the new country.  In 1673, Louis Joliet reported
the following to his superiors:</P>

<P>"<I>At first, when we were told of these treeless lands, I
imagined that it was a country ravaged by fire, where the soil was so
poor that it could produce nothing.  But we have certainly observed
the contrary; and no better soil can be found, either for corn, or
for vines, ... Sometimes we saw grass very short, and, at other
times, five or six feet high...</I>"</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>A reference to the tallgrass prairie</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Settlers coming from Europe brought with them the idea that land
must be cultivated, planted and nurtured in some fashion in order for
it to be valuable.  In Europe and in Canada today, the term
"unimproved" land refers to our "wildlands", the grasslands, natural
woodlands and wetlands.  However, it is the native grasslands that
scientists studying sustainable agriculture today use as a reference
point to which the now less fertile cultivated soil can be compared. 
The settlers were also terrified of the prairie fires that swept the
Canadian prairies.  These people had no experience of fire outside of
a stove, fireplace or blacksmith's forge.  They did not understand
the reasons for the Indians burning the prairie, and often thought
that if they were stopped from doing it that more "fertile" forests
would cover the landscape.  They did not realize that it was the
grassland, and not the forest that created fertile soil, and that it
was mainly climate that created the prairies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>What is the remaining prairie used for?</B></P>

<P>The primary use of prairie today is for grazing of domestic
cattle.  Secondary uses include oil and gas exploration and
extraction, hunting and recreation.  Some people might think that
remaining prairie should be set aside and preserved without use
because there is so little left.  This would result in the prairie
eventually dying or becoming infested with introduced weedy species. 
The reason for this is that prairie is adapted to both grazing and
fire.  Before settlement, large herds of bison grazed the prairie,
and prairie fires were common.  Indeed, it has been shown that if a
fescue prairie is not grazed or burned, so much dead grass builds up
that it chokes out the living grasses, and either weeds, shrubs or
trees will take over.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Why is it important to conserve prairie?</B></P>

<P>Native grassland communities have a wide variety of organisms,
processes, and communities, which is known as biodiversity. 
Biodiversity is important for the following reasons:</P>

<OL>
   <LI>	Moral and ethical reasons
   
   <P>Most people believe that we have an obligation to protect our
   fellow creatures.  The rate of extinction is alarmingly high. 
   Since much is unknown about the native species that form these
   grasslands, it is important to sustain soils and ecosystems'
   processes of any one species.</P>
   
   <LI>	Aesthetics
   
   <P>The diversity that we find in native landscapes adds interest,
   value and quality to our lives as we learn to appreciate the
   living parts of nature.</P>
   
   <LI>	Economics
   
   <P>Natural or native communities throughout the world provide
   direct benefits to humans in forms such as:  food; medicine;
   building; and industrial products.  Our crops and domestic animals
   are "borrowed" from the "genetic library" of nature.</P>
   
   <LI>	Services
   
   <P>Natural communities, including prairies are also important in: 
   maintaining fertility and formation of soil, cycling of nutrients,
   natural control of harmful organisms, climate and atmospheric
   influence.</P>
</OL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>What can we do to help?</B></P>

<OL>
   <LI>	We can identify, conserve and properly manage the prairie
   that we have left.
   
   <LI>	In addition, we can learn how to restore and reclaim
   different prairie types.  This is important so that we can advise
   companies following industrial development.
   
   <LI>	We can raise awareness about the importance of species
   diversity and create interest by planting "prairie spaces" in our
   schoolyards and gardens.
</OL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>How do you create a "prairie space"?</B></P>

<OL>
   <LI>	The chosen site must be well prepared before seeding.  If
   the area has been seeded to tame grasses, the sod must be dug up
   and the site tilled at least three times prior to seeding native
   species.  The seed bed should be firm.
   
   <LI>	A seed mix containing approximately 70% local native grasses
   and 30% local native flowers can be broadcast by hand in either
   the spring or late fall.  It is suggested that the site be rolled
   afterward to ensure soil to seed contact.
   
   <LI>	The area has to be hand-weeded.  It is extremely important
   to keep the area free of unwanted plants, to give the native
   grasses and flowers a chance to establish.  Expect a very lush
   growth of weeds in the first year.
   
   <LI>	You are unlikely to see any flowering of native plants until
   the second or third year, since these are long-lived perennial
   plants.  Some of the seed may not germinate for several years.

<H3>Establishing a Prairie Space</H3>

<P>Contact:	Heather Gerling, Public Land Management Branch, </P>

<P>Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (403) 427-3932
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Using native plants to restore and reclaim prairie is still in its
infancy.  There are many unknowns about individual plant species and
their needs, such as relationships between plants, and between native
plants and their environment.</P>

<P>One of the "Prairie Spaces" project's goals is to further
knowledge about prairie restoration for the benefit of the general
public and reclamation industry.</P>

<P>Much of our current knowledge about prairie restoration has been
gleaned from John Morgan of Argyll, Manitoba who has successfully
completed tallgrass prairie restorations.  Many of the same
principles will apply to restoration of southern Alberta's mixed
prairie and central Alberta's fescue prairie.  Planning a year in
advance is likely to be necessary to obtain suitable seed and to
adequately prepare the planting site.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Seed Sources</B></P>

<P>Native plants dominated the landscape before Euro-American
settlement.  The value of revegetating areas with native plants has
only recently been recognized.  These plants are well adapted to our
climate and add diversity and interest to the environment.  The use
of many native plants was well know to aboriginal peoples, and should
be explored further.</P>

<P>One obstacle to using native seed is availability.  Native grass
seed is much easier to obtain than wildflower seed.  This is largely
because until recently, the focus in reclamation was on using
grasses.</P>

<P>A number of people and companies are starting to collect and grow
native seed for sale.  Quantities are limited, so the best time to
buy is in the fall.</P>

<P>The Native Plant Council of Alberta has a publication entitled,
"Native Plant Source List and Collection and Use Guidelines".  It is
available for $3 from the following address:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Alberta Native Plant Council</P>

<P>Garneau P.O. Box 52099</P>

<P>Edmonton, Alberta</P>

<P>T6G 2T5</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The recommended seeding mix is 70% native grasses and 30% native
forbs (wildflowers).  To broadcast seed use a rate to 25-30 lbs/acre
(11-13 kg/ha).  Lower rates (10-15 lbs/acre) are possible if you have
access to a Truax seed drill, designed to handle odd seed sizes and
shapes.</P>

<P>If you plan to collect the seed yourself, there are a few
important points to remember (condensed from the Native Plant Council
Collection and Use Guidelines):</P>

<OL>
   <LI>	Find out what native plants were found in your area before
   it was settled.  Obtain seed from your ecological zone, i.e.,
   mixed prairie, northern fescue prairie or foothills prairie.
   
   <LI>	When collecting, avoid protected or sensitive areas and
   obtain the necessary permits and permission to enter private or
   leased land.
   
   <LI>	Only collect seed from common species.  Leave 50 percent of
   the seed behind, or more if others are collecting from the same
   area.  This allows natural reseeding of the area, and provides
   food and habitat for animals.  Don't collect intensively from the
   same area year-after-year.
</OL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Preparation</B></P>

<P>Your biggest challenge after finding seed will be controlling the
non-native plants in your prairie space.  Careful preparation of the
soil can save a lot of time later.  Cultivate the area several times
in the year before seeding.  Don't use herbicides that leave a
residue in the soil - harming the growth of sensitive wildflowers.
</P>

<P>Another consideration is fertility.  Unlike non-native plants, our
native plants are well adapted to relatively low fertility.  You can
give them a competitive advantage over non-native "weedy" species by
not fertilizing.  If possible, pick an area that has not been
fertilized or manured in a long time.</P>

<P>The area used for the Prairie Spaces pilot has been recently
manured.  Soil sampling in September 1994 indicated that available
nitrogen on our plots was very high, 80 lb/acre in the top six
inches.  To counteract this, we have used an experimental technique
called soil impoverishment.</P>

<P>Soil microbes use nitrogen in the process of breaking down the
organic matter (source of carbon) in the soil.  If you supply a lot
of organic matter (approximate ratio of 100 lbs of carbon to 1 lb of
nitrogen), then the microbes will "tie up" the nitrogen that weeks
love such much.  We have experimentally added 700 lbs of mulch from a
native seed cleaning operation, and 200 lb of sugar to our 0.1 acre
plot.</P>

<P>Try to use a weed-free source of organic matter.  Native hay, for
example, is less likely to contain weed seeds and has the added
benefit of extra native plant seeds.  The organic material must be
well incorporated into the soil and the area packed to give a firm
seedbed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Seeding</B></P>

<P>The seeding method depends on the amount of land being restored. 
For small areas - for example, school plots or garden plantings -
broadcasting seed by hand is fine.  If you have a lot of helpers, the
seed can be trampled in.  Raking and rolling is advised afterward to
ensure contact of the seed with the soil.</P>

<P>For larger areas, a Truax seed drill can be used.  There are only
a few of these available in Alberta.  Ducks Unlimited is a good
contact for this.  Normal seed drills do not work because of the
light and fluffy nature of some of the native seed.  Some people
think that broadcasting on large areas is just as effective.  Large
broadcasters are available to do this.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Care</B></P>

<P>Weeding is very important.  If you don't know what the native
plant's seed looks like in a juvenile stage, plant test-strips of
each seed type.  We placed seed on drywall joint tape (adhesive on
one side) folded the tape over, and planted the strips at least 1/2
inch deep.  The location of each strip was clearly marked with the
seed type.  This helps ensure that you pull weeds and not desirable
plants.</P>

<P>When weeding by hand isn't an option, mowing can be useful.  Weeds
likely grow faster and are taller than the slower growing native
plants (since most native plants are perennials).  Mowing gives
native plants a fighting chance for survival.  Using herbicides isn't
an option when the mix contains wild flowers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Expectations</B></P>

<P>Your plot won't look like much the first year.  Remember most of
the plants are perennials and will take at least a year to get
established.  Don't expect flowering until the second year, at the
earliest, except for any annuals that are in the mix.  Also, some
species may not germinate for several years.  These are some of the
reasons that native plants have not been extensively used in past
reclamation efforts.  Sometimes it is necessary to seed fast-growing
plants on a reclamation site just to keep the soil in place. 
Recently, however, there has been a move toward using short-lived
plants to achieve stabilization, but to also seed slow-to-establish,
long-lived native plants along with them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Happy planting! </B> Let us know about your successes and
failures so that we can help others.</P>

<H3>Prairies Spaces:  A Fescue Prairie Restoration Project</H3>

<P>Contact:	Heather Gerling, Public Land Management Branch, </P>

<P>Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (403) 427-3932
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Settlement of the Canadian prairies has resulted in extensive loss
of the original diversity of grass and wildflower species, and an
accompanying loss of wildlife habitat.  There are three types of
prairie in Canada - tallgrass, fescue, and mixed grass - with their
own characteristic species adapted to the regional climate.  Remnants
of the tallgrass prairie are found in Manitoba and cover less than 1%
of the original area.  The mixed grass prairie is found in the drier
parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan.  About 24% of this grassland
remains in its native state.  The fescue prairie is found almost
entirely in Alberta, and is divided into the foothills fescue and
northern fescue grasslands.  Approximately 20% of the foothills
fescue prairie remains, but only about 5% of the northern fescue
prairie can still be found, due to cultivation in the central parts
of Alberta.  Remaining tracts of fescue grassland are mostly found on
public land, which is generally less suitable for cultivation.  Since
the project location is Edmonton, the northern fescue prairie was
chosen as the focus for this demonstration.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There are many ethical and practical reasons to conserve native
species and ecosystems.  Most people believe that we have a moral
obligation to protect the plants and animals that we share this earth
with.  It is in our best interest to do so, since our own survival is
based on healthy ecosystems.  We also receive direct economic
benefits from native plants and animals.  Foods, medicines, building
and industrial products are examples of such benefits.  We should not
forget that our domestic livestock and crops are "borrowed" from the
"genetic library" of nature.  We do not know which species might be
important to us in the future.  Native communities also provide less
direct, but important services.  For example, soil formation and
maintenance of soil fertility, nutrient cycling, climate influence
and natural control of pathogenic organisms are all valuable services
provided by native ecosystems.  Lastly, the aesthetic value of a
diverse native prairie has been appreciated for centuries, and
continue to add interest and quality to our lives.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There is a growing need to learn the science and art of restoring
our prairies.  Our children need to understand the value of
maintaining species diversity in our environment, and learn about
prairie ecology in a practical, hands on way.  It is also important
to learn how to manage our prairies in a responsible way.  This can
be done by recreating prairie spaces in our parks and schoolyards. 
This project will be a pilot, set up as a demonstration for those who
are interested in prairie restoration.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Objectives:</B></P>

<P>The major long term objective of this project is to develop a
prairie restoration model that is transferable to other locations in
the province.  In doing so, some of the following objectives will be
met:</P>

<OL>
   <LI>	to promote public awareness of the value of prairie
   ecosystems;
   
   <LI>	to encourage conservation and responsible use of remaining
   native prairie, found mainly on public land;
   
   <LI>	to further knowledge about prairie restoration, for the
   benefit of industry and the general public, whose interest in
   using native species in reclamation and landscaping is increasing;
   
   <LI>	to provide an opportunity for students to practice
   stewardship of the earth;
   
   <LI>	and to increase species diversity in our local landscapes.
</OL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Project Outline</B></P>

<P>Because of the time needed to successfully establish native
prairie, it is anticipated that a five year commitment will be
required of the participants.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Spring 1994</P>

<UL>
   <LI>	Space has been secured in front of the J.G. O'Donoghue
   Building for three demonstration plots (approximately 100 m2
   each).  Two plots will be seeded by students - one in the fall of
   1994 and one in the spring of 1995.  The third plot will be
   planted with container plants in the spring of 1995 to provide
   earlier visualization of the plants of the fescue prairie.
   
   <LI>	Slides have been obtained from John Morgan, Prairie
   Habitats, Manitoba to show how a similar project was done using
   tallgrass prairie species.
   
   <LI>	Meetings were held with possible corporate sponsor(s),
   teaching staff from a cooperating school, and other interested
   parties.
   
   <LI>	Most of the seed for the plots will be donated by
   Enviroscapes, with some from other seed suppliers.  Joffre
   Greenhouses will grow and donate container material to be planted
   next spring.
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Summer 1994</P>

<UL>
   <LI>	Weed control measures were undertaken on plots.
   
   <LI>	Slide presentations were prepared for students.
   
   <LI>	Soil nitrogen testing was used to determine the nutrient
   status of the soil.  Nitrogen was found to be too high for a
   typical prairie soil.  Nitrogen will be lowed through the addition
   of a carbon source such as straw or a mixture of sawdust and
   sugar.  This should minimize weed growth during the next year.
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Fall 1994</P>

<UL>
   <LI>	Slide presentation delivered to students to familiarize them
   with the importance of prairie ecology and the project itself.
   
   <LI>	Planting date selected (October) and alternate (in case of
   bad weather) and details finalized (plot staked, equipment
   accessed, media coverage arranged, other).
   
   <LI>	Plots seeded, with help from the students from Vernon
   Barford Junior High.
   
   <LI>	Signage made during winter season.
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Summer 1995</P>

<UL>
   <LI>	Arrangements made for seeding of second plot and planting of
   container material on the third plot during Environment Week
   (first week of June).  Students from Vernon Barford Junior High
   were included in these activities.
   
   <LI>	Student contracts for hand weeding the plots were arranged.
   
   <LI>	Growth was documented with slides.
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Winter 1995</P>

<UL>
   <LI>	Written guide for use by schools, etc. were developed with
   help from the Agricultural Education Branch.
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>1996 and Beyond</P>

<UL>
   <LI>	Other schools, groups and individuals will be assisted with
   the establishment of their own prairie plots.
   
   <LI>	Funding permitting, a video may be developed.
   
   <LI>	Student weeding contracts will be continued.

<H3><B>Specifications for Tree and Shrub Planting</B></H3>

<P>Contact: Doran McCreary, Calgary Board of Education Maintenance

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Shrub Planting Specifications Procedure 89-HO-012 </B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>1.0 Large shrubs dug with a tree spade are to planted according to
procedure 91-HO-011, with the exception being that staking is not
necessary.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>2.0 Container-Grown and Potted Shrubs</P>

<P>2.1 Dig a hole in the planting area to the exact diameter of the
root ball but 20-40 mm shallower.</P>

<P>2.2 Remove the root ball from the pot. If root circling is evident
around the outside of the ball, make three vertical slits with a
sharp sod knife the full length of the ball and only about 5 mm deep.
Space these slits evenly around the ball at 120û to one another.</P>

<P>2.3 Place the root ball in the hole, and rotate the plant until
its best side is facing the direction from which it will most
frequently be viewed.</P>

<P>2.4 Using a spading fork, thoroughly loosen the native soil
surrounding the root ball in a band 30 cm wide. While performing this
function, ensure that the soil contacts the root ball all the way
around.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>3.0 Ball and Burlapped Shrubs</P>

<P>Same as above, but cut and remove the twine and sacking from
around the lower stems and the top of the ball. If the sacking is not
bio-degradable, also remove it from the sides of the ball. These
steps must be performed after the root ball is correctly positioned
in the hole.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>4.0 Bare-Root Shrubs</P>

<P>4.1 Dig a hole large enough to accommodate the root system when it
is fully spread out. Ensure that the hole is of the correct depth so
that when the roots are resting in it, they will be at the same depth
as they were before the shrub was dug.</P>

<P>4.2 Prune off any roots which are broken or damaged.</P>

<P>4.3 Place the root's system in the hole, and shift the shrub
around until its best side faces the direction from which it will
most frequently be viewed.</P>

<P>4.4 Sift loam (no lumps) around the roots, and add water to settle
the loam. Repeat this procedure as often as necessary until the loam
is at the same level as the surrounding soil. Do not tamp this soil
excessively or growth may be restricted due to reduced pore space and
resultant oxygen levels.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>5.0 Fertilization, Pruning, Provisions for Watering</P>

<P>See Procedure 89-HO-011.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>6.0 Mulching shrub beds with a 50 mm layer of wood chips will
conserve soil moisture, prevent harmful temperature fluctuations, and
control weed growth. Top up with 25 mm every four years. They will
gradually decompose, but not so rapidly that nitrogen will need to be
added.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Woody Ornamental Planting Guide Procedure 88-HO-017</B></P>

<P>The following factors should be considered when landscape plans
are being drawn:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>1.0 High Maintenance Items</P>

<P>These should be avoided as much as possible because high
maintenance is not only costly, but frequently it is not provided,
resulting in substandard plant quality or even deterioration to the
point of death.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Examples Problems</B></P>

<P>Betula papyrifera ¥ high water requirement</P>

<P>¥ to die-back</P>

<P>¥ severe leaf-miner infestations</P>

<P>Betula verrucosa gracilis ¥ same as above</P>

<P>Cotoneaster acutifolia ¥ severe pear slug infestations</P>

<P>¥ shearing required two or three times throughout the growing
season</P>

<P>Fraxinus nigra ¥ high water requirement</P>

<P>Picea glauca ¥ subject to many insect problems</P>

<P>Populus sp. ¥ root systems cause damage to lawns, underground
services, asphalt, concrete, etc.</P>

<P>Prunus tomentosa ¥ fruit attracts children into shrub beds</P>

<P>P. virginiana "Schubert" ¥ excessive suckering</P>

<P>Ribes alpinum ¥ very susceptible to powdery mildew</P>

<P>Rosa "Hansa" ¥ severely chlorotic</P>

<P>Sorbaria sorbifolia ¥ excessive suckering</P>

<P>Spirea arguta ¥ excessive suckering</P>

<P>Symphoricarpos albus ¥ excessive suckering</P>

<P>Syringa vulgaris ¥ excessive suckering</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>2.0 Borderline Hardiness</P>

<P>Some tree and shrub varieties must either be placed in
microclimates or eliminated from the landscape since they will not
thrive under normal exposures.</P>

<P>Examples</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Cornus alba elegantissima Acer saccharinum
   
   <LI> Cornus alba siberica Celtis occidentalis
   
   <LI>Elaeagnus angustifolia Cotoneaster dammeri
   
   <LI>Euonymus alatus (&amp; compacta) Euonymus alatus compacta
   
   <LI>Juniperus horizontalis plumosa Salix alba "Tristis"
   
   <LI>Prunus cistena Salix purpurea gracillis
   
   <LI>Thuya sp. Tilia cordata
   
   <LI>Tamarix pentandra
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>3.0 New Varieties</P>

<P>Our experimental plot has indicated that a number of desirable
varieties not used in past are entirely suitable for our climate.
Those which have undergone sufficient testing to indicate their
adaptability should be included in plans, provided that we are
reasonably assured of their availability.</P>

<P>Some other varieties whose hardiness has already been well
established, but which have been used infrequently, can also be
considered here.</P>

<P>Examples</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Aesculus glabra
   
   <LI>Daphne cneorum
   
   <LI>Forsythia ovata "Ottawa"
   
   <LI>Fraxinus mandshurica
   
   <LI>Hydrangea arborescens "Annabelle"
   
   <LI>Larix kaempferi
   
   <LI>Pinus ponderasa, sylvestris, flexilis
   
   <LI>Populus tremula erecta
   
   <LI>Rosa "Adelaide Hoodless" (1 m tall, dark red, ever-blooming
   shrub rose)
   
   <LI>Rosa "Dr. F. L. Skinner, large cream" (2 m tall, large cream,
   semi ever-blooming)
   
   <LI>Weigela "Dropmore Pink"
   
   <LI>Quercus macrocarpa
   
   <LI>Yucca glauca
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Specifications for Purchase of Trees and Shrubs Procedure
90-HO-024</B></P>

<P>1.0 Plant material must be true to name and type, well branched,
healthy, free of insects and disease, and free from damage.</P>

<P>2.0 Bare-root stock shall be allowed only as hedging or liner
stock and must be dug while in a dormant state with the root system
extending a minimum of 380 mm in diameter for each 25 mm of caliper
measured at a height of 300 mm above ground level. Roots must not be
broken, and must not be allowed to dry out.</P>

<P>3.0 Ball and burlapped material must have solid earth balls
wrapped in burlap and contained in a wire basket. Plants with cracked
or broken root balls will be rejected.</P>

<P>4.0 All trees for landscape planting will be dug by tree spade or
container grown (not bare-rooted material which has been potted). The
root ball shall have a diameter of 380 mm for each 25 mm of caliper,
and tree spade material shall be burlapped and wire basketed in a
basket with loops strong enough to withstand lifting the tree by the
top loops of the basket at a minimum of two points.</P>

<P>5.0 Any plant material may be rejected by the Grounds Department
if it does not conform to specifications.</P>

<P>6.0 Minimum sizes of material to be used for landscape planting
shall be:</P>

<P>6.1 coniferous trees: 2 m height</P>

<P>6.2 deciduous trees: 3.75 m height and 63 mm cal.</P>

<P>6.3 ornamental trees: 2.75 m height and 40 mm cal.</P>

<P>6.4 evergreen shrubs: 5 gal. container grown</P>

<P>6.5 deciduous shrubs: 2 gal. container grown</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Tree Planting Specifications Procedure 89-HO-011</B></P>

<P>The following specifications apply to trees dug with a tree spade
and/or ball and burlapped, with a caliper 30 cm above the soil level
of up to 75 mm.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>1.0 Dig a hole in the desired location matching the dimensions of
the root ball of the tree to be planted as closely as possible.</P>

<P>1.1 It is essential that the root ball not settle after planting,
so the depth of the hole must be equal to the depth of the root ball.
If the hole is deeper than the root ball, clean fill must be firmly
tamped into the bottom until the dimensions match.</P>

<P>1.2 At surface level, the diameter of the hole must exactly match
the surface diameter of the root ball.</P>

<P>2.0 Lower the root ball into the hole, and adjust it by means of a
chain hooked onto the wire basket and manipulated with some means of
mechanical hoist until the tree trunk is plumb when the root ball is
resting freely.</P>

<P>3.0 Flush clean shredded loam into all cracks between the top of
the root ball and the surrounding soil with a hose until no more loam
is accepted.</P>

<P>4.0 Using a pressurized root feeder with no bottom hose and with
lateral holes drilled perpendicular to the shaft, fracture the native
soil by performing the following steps:</P>

<P>4.1 Inject pressurized water into the native soil surrounding the
root ball, in a concentric circle 20 cm outside the perimeter of the
root ball.</P>

<P>4.2 The root feeder must penetrate vertically to a depth of 20 to
30 cm.</P>

<P>4.3 Make injections at 30 to 40 cm intervals around the perimeter
of the root ball.</P>

<P>4.4 Force the root feeder to the desired depth while under
pressure, then immediately withdraw it slowly to the surface.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>5.0 Staking will adhere to the following format:</P>

<P>5.1 Firmly drive three 2m snow fence stakes into the native soil
120cm from one another, with the prevailing wind striking midway
between two of the stakes.</P>

<P>5.2 Depth of staking will depend on the firmness of the native
soil, but should be no less than 45 cm.</P>

<P>5.3 The stakes must be placed 15 to 20 cm away from the edge of
the root ball.</P>

<P>5.4 Tie wires (baling wire is fine) must be attached to the top of
the stakes, and placed through sections of garden hose or similar
material where they pass around the tree trunk.</P>

<P>5.5 Tie wires must be placed immediately above a lateral branch to
prevent them from slipping down.</P>

<P>5.6 All tie wires must be firmed up uniformly, taking care not to
stress the trunk one way or another in the process.</P>

<P>5.7 Flagging must be placed on each tie wire.</P>

<P>5.8 All stakes and tie wires must be removed 12 months after
planting.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>6.0 Provisions for watering:</P>

<P>6.1 If the tree has been planted in an area serviced by an
underground automatic irrigation system, a tree well is neither
necessary nor desirable.</P>

<P>6.2 In areas not serviced by underground automatic irrigation, a
tree well consisting of shredded loam should be placed around the
circumference of the root ball.</P>

<P>6.21 The innermost edge of the tree well should be 20 cm away from
the outside of the root ball.</P>

<P>6.22 The tree well should be sufficient to retain a depth of 80 to
100 mm of water.</P>

<P>6.3 After two growing seasons, the tree wells are neither
necessary nor desirable since the feeder roots will have grown past
them, so should be removed. Further use of the well may actually
discourage the feeder roots from developing outward as a consequence
of hydrotropism. If watering becomes necessary after this stage,
saturate the entire surrounding area with portable irrigation
equipment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>7.0 Fertilization should be done sparingly if at all, in order to
avoid a salt imbalance between the roots and the surrounding soil,
which will result in desiccation of the newly planted tree. There is
no need for a high phosphorous fertilizer, since phosphorous does not
promote root growth. Auxins will promote root growth, but are
specific to certain species -- there is currently no generally
effective auxin available.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>8.0 Pruning at transplanting time is neither helpful nor harmful,
since the effects of water loss and auxin -- carbohydrate loss tend
to cancel one another out. Consequently, pruning is best restricted
to whatever is necessary for shaping purposes (do not shear or head
back).</P>

<P>Trees larger than 75 mm caliper are to be planted in exactly the
same fashion, except that staking is to be accomplished by means of
#9 of steel guy wires attached to Duck Bill anchors driven below soil
surface level in three locations at 120û spacing as per 5.1, but
placed a distance away from the trunk equal to 40% of the tree's
height. The guy wires should also be placed around the trunk at a
height equal to 40% of the tree's height.</P>

<P>Root growth will be slower on these larger trees, so the guy wires
should be left in place for two growing seasons.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Landscape Design Procedure 88-HO-018</B></P>

<P>1.0 Architectural Plans Required</P>

<P>1.1 Site plan complete with levels</P>

<P>3.3 Screen parking lots, electrical and garbage boxes, etc.</P>

<P>3.4 Arrange planting plan to enhance building utilizing focal
points such as main entrance, windows, doors, natural land contours,
etc.</P>

<P>3.5 Utilize evergreen trees to windward and deciduous trees to
lee.</P>

<P>3.6 Indicate fencing type and quantity where it may be needed,
e.g., 6' or 4' chain link, post and cable, ornamental.</P>

<P>3.7 Consult the Woody Ornamentals Planting guide when selecting
plant material.</P>

<P>3.8 Indicate areas to be graveled.</P>

<P>3.9 Indicate areas where additional hard surfacing such as
asphalt, concrete, interlocking brick, red shale may be needed but
hasn't been included on architectural plans.</P>

<P>3.10 Include signs, sports equipment, bike racks.</P>

<P>3.11 Consider the possibility/advisability of utilizing pathways

<P>There are literally hundreds of ways to integrate a native plant
park into the curriculum. When we say integrate, we don't mean
"add-on", instead we mean how can we use a native plant park as a
vehicle to deliver the curriculum in a hands-on and relevant fashion?
</P>

<P>Community involvement and student empowerment are essential to
both establishing these areas and maintaining them after they are
finished. From the word go, students and parents were involved in the
process of planning and developing the area at our school and it has
produced dividends in and out of the classroom. The learning
associated with this extends from math (calculating the quantities of
soil, rock, compost, etc., needed for the area), art (diagramming
what the area will look like over time regarding plant size and
needs), language arts (writing letters for grants and thank you
letters) and health (how do these areas improve the quality or
"wellness" of our lives) to science (information about plants and the
elements necessary to create a successful ecosystem) to name a few.
</P>

<P>This handout is a summary of a few ideas we have tried or are
planning to work on this year. Attached is a planning sheet, similar
to the one we used, to help you consider how to incorporate these
efforts across the curriculum.</P>

<P><B>Language Arts</B></P>

<P><B>Script Writing and Plays</B></P>

<P>The year 5/6 students developed a play, which was presented at the
workshop, that portrayed an aspect of the creation, purpose and
philosophy behind the development of the plant park, from their point
of view. Students discussed questions such as: why do we want a
native plant park?; why are these native plant parks important in a
city?; how is a native plant park different from your local city
park?; and what elements are needed for an area like this to
survive?.</P>

<P>Students grouped themselves into groups of four to six
participants. A plan was then completed, followed by an individual
rough draft of the script. Each group then collaborated on producing
an overall script that incorporated aspects of the individual
scripts. Rehearsals were held in class and the play was then
presented to other classrooms. The performances were videotaped and
sent to other schools that were interested in developing a plant
park. During the entire process, students followed "the writing
process" to ensure the high quality writing skills were being
developed. Self assessments and peer assessments were also used
throughout.</P>

<P><B>Journal Writing</B></P>

<P>Year 5/6 students maintain a "creative journal", which is a
collection of their thoughts, reflections and experiences. To start
this year, students were asked to write an entry about how the plant
park has improved the school, why it is important, and what their
role is in maintaining the plant park. These journal entries require
the use of rubbings, pictures and diagrams from the plant park area.
In one case, students were asked to make an entry in their journal
without "writing" in it. This meant they could ask someone else to
write in it, use pictures, and be creative in many other ways.</P>

<P><B>Silent Reading</B></P>

<P>The plant park is simply a great place to go for silent reading
time, reading aloud, or to relax. The amphitheater is good for groups
presentations, class lessons, and for guest speakers to talk to
individual classes. The community also uses the area for evening
meetings and gatherings.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Math</B></P>

<P>Once the park was completed last spring, the year 5/6 classes
plotted out the park using a grid pattern. After developing the grid
system, students worked in pairs to measure and make a scaled drawing
of the park. Plant names, height, and canopy size were determined and
recorded on the grid. The intent of this exercise was to initiate a
longitudinal study that can be continued over the next few years to
compare how the park has grown and changed over time.</P>

<P>As mentioned above, the planning process provides opportunity to
perform extensive calculations about park needs (e.g., rocks, top
soil, plants) and compare these calculations with the actual amounts
used.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Science</B></P>

<P>There are many areas within the new science curriculum that lend
themselves to native plant parks. In grade 5, the plant park provides
a basis for comparison in the Pond Study unit. After students have
developed an understanding of an aquatic ecosystem, they can apply
this learning to the plant park environment and look for similarities
and differences.</P>

<P>In the Weather unit, students may use a "solitude time" experience
to record how the area changes over time as a function of the
weather. They can also set up a weather station in the plant park and
develop their own forecasting equipment. These forecasts may become a
routine part of school announcements. Weather can also be discussed
during the planning of the plant park, since many plant and animal
requirements are related to climate. Basically, the plant park
provides a piece of natural landscape in an urban setting.</P>

<P>In the grade 6 unit Trees and Forests, a comparison of plant and
animal populations and diversity may be done over an expanse of time
that would allow students to contrast the "natural" plant park with
local urban parks.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Health</B></P>

<P>This area has produced the most surprising spin-offs. The "quality
of life" discussions and writing opportunities have provided some
exciting and reflective thoughts from students and parents alike. It
seems that the plant park has encouraged people to spend much more
time outdoors. As a result, we spend more time simply "being" in the
plant park.</P>

<P>While the park was being created, we had many people come into the
classroom to discuss career options associated with park development,
municipal planning, horticulture, technology, labour, and community
relations, to name a few.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Art</B></P>

<P>Sketching, painting, rubbing, aesthetic considerations during
planning, colour schemes, and a place to work outdoors are all
provided by the plant park.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Music</B></P>

<P>Last year's grade 5/6 students wrote songs and videotaped them.

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Project 1: Visioning</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>We could design a "utopian" dream community. What would a
   perfect community look like? Think about what our homes might look
   like. What kinds of people would be in our community? How would
   people treat one another? What would a sustainable house look
   like?
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <LI>How would our community relate to the rest of the city or
   urban environment? Where would people work and what kinds of work
   would they do? Would there be rich and poor people? What would the
   health of the people be like? What kinds of food might they eat?
   How would resources be used? What new environmental technologies
   might be used? What would schoolyards be like? What would ideal
   schools be like or would there even be schools as we know them?
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <LI>What kinds of stores, and other services would be in the
   community? What other services would be necessary? Are there any
   green spaces? Natural areas? Parks? Other? Are there any wildlife
   species? Is there technology being used? What and how? Are there
   any community gardens? Any markets? Do local farmers bring fresh
   produce to the community? How is money used in the community?
   Where do the elderly life and what are they involved in doing? How
   will people move about? Where would garbage go?
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Project 2: Reality Check</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>Take a community walking tour. Make notes? Draw some maps?
   Create some bioregional maps.
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Project 3: Making Connections</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>Interview some residents or people who lived in the community
   forty or fifty years ago. What has changed?
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Project 4: More Thinking</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>How would one retrofit your community to become more like the
   "utopia" which you envisaged? What changes might be desirable? Is
   there one project that you could start? How could one involve more
   people? Who might you want to involve? Where might you find
   resources?
   
   <LI>Media? Politicians? Parents?
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Project 5: Involving More People</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>Write a press release to tell others about the new
   initiative(s) that you want to start. Organize a bigger meeting.
   Invite some key people. Involve many people. Are there some people
   from government that you could involve?
   
   <LI>Ask people what they think about your community and what they
   would like to see changed.
   
   <LI>Plan a survey.

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Introduction</B></P>

<P>Ontarians remain very concerned with the future of their immediate
environment.  In a recent survey commissioned by the Regional
Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, people rated their top five
priorities as: protecting the environment, keeping taxes down,
preservation of greenspace, promoting health and increased economic
diversity.  Further down the list were increased police protection,
improving public transit and maintaining arts.</P>

<P>Profound changes in the way we live, work and play means that
landowners, community groups and schools will access money, expertise
and labour in different ways to accomplish projects in the future. 
Individual, group, corporate and agency cooperation ("commonly called
partnerships") have become the only way to accomplish work as
resources from individual sources continues to dwindle.  This is
evidenced in the fact that most funding agencies and foundations
stipulate contributions from a number of sources as necessary for
proposal approval.</P>

<P>People value a high quality environment but not at the cost of
excessive regulation.  The time is right to provide alternatives to
the reliance and enforcement of regulations to protect and enhance
the environment.  Government, non-governmental organizations,
community groups and the business community are interested in these
alternatives - this in part is why the concept of stewardship  is
becoming so well supported by so many today.</P>

<P>Stewardship  involves the caring for land in ways that benefit or
sustain it while benefiting the landowner's quality of life. 
Stewardship  implies: respect for natural ecosystems and the
relationship between land, water, plants, animals, and humans;
responsibility of the landowner as a custodian to pass the land on
undamaged and hopefully improved for future generations; while
utilizing resourceful approaches to land management activities.</P>

<P>Stewardship  has not been well defined in an urban context.  In
urban areas, stewardship  activities frequently overlap and involve
other aspects of the urban environment: land use planning,
aboriculture, urban forestry, landscape architecture and education. 
Urban land stewardship  views the urban environment as a functioning
ecosystem -- areas of natural value within areas of intensive human
influence.  Components of this ecosystem include: woodlots,
plantations, shade trees, hedgerows, open field in various stages of
succession, wetlands and riparian areas.  Components also include
shrubs, herbs, mammals and birds, invertebrates, abacteria,
organisms, soil, water and minerals.  Humans are an important
component of the ecosystem.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>A Conservation Agency Approach to Stewardship</B></P>

<P>Against the background of the concept of sustainable development
the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR) adopted its goal: To
contribute to the environmental, social, and economic well-being of
Ontario through the sustainable development of natural resources.
</P>

<P>In order to properly fulfill this mandate while building on its
solid reputation of providing landowner services and programs, the
OMNR recently introduced its contribution to province wide
stewardship under the Private Forest Sustainability Program.  At
present, 32 Stewardship Coordinators  are in place across southern
Ontario, mostly on an upper tier municipal basis.  The Stewardship
Coordinators  will be responsible to the community through a
Stewardship Council  that will seek to represent local landowners and
land interests, promote resource sustainability, identify problems
and prioritize actions, promote land stewardship and seek funding
opportunities for projects.</P>

<P>The urban Ottawa-Carleton area is well-known for its endowment of
greenspace, mostly under the ownership of the National Capital
Commission but also owned by individual landowners, other government
agencies and the corporate/development community.  Ottawa-Carleton
has one of the most educated, bilingual and highly skilled workforces
in Canada.  Approximately 90% of the Regions 700,000 people live on
the 11.8% of the Regions urbanized land.  English is the mother
tongue for 68.5% of the Region's residents.  17% count French as
their mother tongue while 9.7% are allophones.  The economy of the
area is shifting.  Although the federal government remains the
largest employer, advance technology firms have become the second
largest employer (ahead of tourism) and have showed the largest
increase in employment since 1986.  The ability of governments-
federal, provincial and municipal, to effectively manage greenspace
with their own resources will continue to diminish.  An environmental
review of the Regional Office Plan stresses the need to integrate a
natural environment system with any future development.  In this
context, there exists great opportunities for effective urban land
stewardship  in Ottawa-Carleton.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Solving The Sustainable Community Ride</B></P>

<P>Many papers, documents, and literature have described communities
as analogous to an ecosystem.  It is complex.  It is diverse.  It is
dynamic.  The Ontario Round Table on Environment and Economy through
extensive consultation has defined the characteristics which
distinguish a sustainable community.  The sustainable community:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>recognizes that growth occurs within some limits, employs
   ecological decision making, has respect for life forms and
   supports biodiversity and minimizes harm to the natural
   environment
   
   <LI>values cultural diversity and share values amongst the members
   of the community
   
   <LI>makes best use of local efforts and resources (solutions at
   local level)
   
   <LI>makes decisions and plans in a balanced, open, and flexible
   manner that includes perspectives from social, health, economic
   and environmental sectors of the community
   
   <LI>uses renewable and reliable sources of energy and fosters
   activities which use materials in continuous cycles
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Solving the sustainable community's riddle implies an
understanding of:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>the community as an ecosystem,
   
   <LI>land ownership patterns, and
   
   <LI>the "stewardship toolbox"
</UL>

<P>The community as an ecosystem is composed of people - in all their
diversity, the natural environment - climate, air, land, water,
biota, the built environment - buildings, streets services and the
network relationship between these.</P>

<P>Land ownership patterns particularly urban land ownership patterns
are complex and very important.  It is the land owner who ultimately
decides, how and for what the land will be managed.  Because of this
it is important that environmentally responsible behaviour be
encouraged through influence and example -- the landowner must see,
experience, learn and realize that certain actions are in his or her
(and hence the community's) benefit.</P>

<P>In all communities, especially urbanized ones, the diversity of
land ownership is indeed staggering: </P>

<UL>
   <LI>the city lot (50' x 100') under one or more ownership's
   (detached, semi, townhouse)
   
   <LI>communally owned/managed land (co-ops, condominiums)
   
   <LI>apartment buildings and rental accommodation
   
   <LI>agency owned land (municipal parks, Ontario Hydro
   right-of-ways, government
   
   <LI>complexes, NCC lands, Conservation Authority properties)
   
   <LI>development company/home builder owned lands
   
   <LI>business community/corporate owned land 
   
   <LI>schoolyards
   
   <LI>utility corridors/easements
   
   <LI>waterways
</UL>

<P>Because the objectives of ownership differ dramatically, several
"tools" from the stewardship toolbox (or approaches) are needed to
assist and benefit land stewardship activities.  These include:
knowledge of regulation -- acts, bylaws, and agreements; landowner
and community programs, volunteer programs, educational programs
offered in schools, colleges and universities and other methods being
developed to secure greenspace, also known as "creative
conservation."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Regulation</B></P>

<P>Knowledge of regulation is important, even though stewardship by
definition is not directly enforced as a result of regulation.  In
Ontario, there are a variety of pieces of provincial legislation
oriented towards the protection of the natural environment.  Some of
the more important ones include:</P>

<P>Planning Act  - regulates land use by encouraging municipal
adoption of Official Plans, Zoning Bylaws and Site Plan Controls on
development;</P>

<P>Municipal Act - enables municipalities (lower tier) to pass bylaws
including those to protect trees on municipally-owned land and since
March 28, 1995 on private land through a permit structure to
municipalities greater than 10,000;</P>

<P>City of Ottawa Act - enables the City of Ottawa to enforce bylaws
prohibiting the injuring or destruction of woodlots designated under
the City's Official Plan;</P>

<P>Trees Act - enables municipalities (upper tier) to pass bylaws
restricting and regulating the cutting of woodlots, encouraging good
forestry practice</P>

<P>Ontario Heritage Act - enables communities to designate properties
of historic/architectural value whose description can include trees.
</P>

<P>Regulation should be regarded as one tool which protects the most
significant aspects of the natural environment.  Regulation in
compliment with other stewardship tools can provide great community
environmental benefits.  Concern has been expressed by some people
wary of regulatory on private land designed to benefit "the public
good."  In some extreme cases, restrictive regulation can actually
encourage people to undertake activities of a decidedly
anti-environmental nature as a "spiteful" reaction.  Stewardship
seeks to build and expand on the regulatory framework of
environmental protection.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Landowner/Community Programs</B></P>

<P>A number of programs differing in implementation, landowner
involvement and complexity are available to landowners.</P>

<P>A number of "big-picture" initiatives may be of interest to some
landowners.  These include position papers and discussion documents
related to sustainable development from the Conservation Council of
Ontario, the Ontario Environment Network and the Sustainable
Communities Working Group of the Ontario Round Table on the
Environment and the Economy, etc. Frequently these initiatives seek
consensus between seemingly disparate groups around issues of the
environment.  A similar group called Greenprint, A Roundtable on the
Environment for Ottawa-Carleton has a similar local mandate.</P>

<P>Every municipality, particularly Ottawa-Carleton have a number of
agencies, organizations and consultants who can provide technical
expertise and organizational assistance to community groups for
environmental projects.  These include:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>the two Stewardship Coordinators for Ottawa-Carleton presently
   located at the Landowner Resource Centre at Manotick
   
   <LI>foresters, engineers, biologists and technicians with one of
   the three area Conservation Authorities - Rideau Valley, South
   Nation River and Mississippi Valley as well as the Ontario
   Ministry of Natural Resources, Carleton Place District;
   
   <LI>foresters who work for both the Regional Municipality of
   Ottawa-Carleton and the City of Ottawa;
   
   <LI>consulting landscape architects, architects and urban
   foresters with an interest in the outdoor environment;
   
   <LI>members of the landscape profession, many of whom are members
   of Landscape Ontario;
   
   <LI>faculty and staff of two universities and two community
   colleges which offer courses in geography, horniculture, botany
   and land use planning.
</UL>

<P>A number of community-oriented funding programs are accessible to
the public including the Green Communities Initiative of the Ministry
of the Environment and Energy and Action 21 from Environment Canada 
Many of these programs fund initiatives which include aspects of
natural landscaping, xeriscaping and education which fit well with
the concept of urban land stewardship.</P>

<P>There are a number of neighbourhood funding initiatives accessible
to the public through various foundations and agencies. These include
Friends of the Environment a program established by Canada Trust and
the Shell Environmental Fund of Shell Canada to fund community
projects.  The Community Environmental Grants Program from the
Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, Greening our City
initiatives from the City of Nepean and Naturalization in City Parks
from the City of Ottawa are examples of municipal programs to
encourage stewardship activities in urban areas.  Other initiatives
such as the Old Ottawa South Community's Riverbank Project is an
example of a community-driven project which seeks to naturalize and
improve water quality on the Rideau River.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Volunteer Groups</B></P>

<P>Voluntarism, the notion of providing service to the community is
well entrenched in the Canadian psyche and will become even more
important in future years.  Partly as a reaction to the continuing
reduction in government services, but also as a means of building
healthy communities, voluntarism will play a large role in sustaining
the environment within our cities.  From the scouts, cubs, guides,
brownies and beavers, to school environmental clubs, community
associations, service clubs, environmental employee days, municipal
Environmental Advisory Committees and other environmental
organizations, volunteers are a significant resource to be
challenged, channeled and supported to accomplish meaningful
environmental work.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Educational Opportunities</B></P>

<P>Because stewardship inevitably involves activities which purposely
seek information and influence people's behaviour, educational
activities are of extreme importance.  The concept of "education" can
be thought of as being flexible - it can include "in-school" classes,
organizing field trips, tours, workshops, demonstrations, etc.,
on-the-ground activities (tree planting, birdhouse installation,
etc.).  A number of agencies and non-governmental organizations are
engaged in educational endeavors, these include:</P>

<P>Focus on  Forests, Project Wild and Fishways are offered by the
OMNR for elementary and secondary school children introducing
ecological concepts related to forests, wildlife and fish;</P>

<P>Envirothon, offered through the Ontario Forestry Association seeks
by means of friendly competition to teach students about ecological
principles.  Similar programs are also available through the Boards
of Education.</P>

<P>The Evergreen Foundation  is an educational/funding organization
which sponsors projects to encourage schoolyard restoration and
environmental values with schoolchildren;</P>

<P>Other opportunities exist outside the schoolyard with initiatives
such as the Fletcher Wildlife Garden, a demonstration area of natural
gardening techniques, The Ontario Master Gardener Program through the
Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, as well as
the many interpretive trail systems set up throughout the National
Capital Region.</P>

<P>Many Universities and colleges offer material which supports
efforts related to urban stewardship.  Locally, for example,
Algonquin College and La Cite Collegiale offer diploma courses in
horniculture.  Carleton University and the University of Ottawa offer
</P>

<P>course in land use planning.  The Centre for Land and Water
Stewardship at the University of Guelph and the Urban Foresters
Centre, University of Toronto are examples of academic institutions
who lend support to stewardship activities</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Creative Conservation</B></P>

<P>The term "creative conservation" was coined to describe
alternative mechanisms to secure greenspace for conservation
purposes.  This is done through land trusts and conservation
easements.  Land trusts are non-governmental, charitable
organizations operated for public benefit and dedicated to the
protection of natural areas.  They work directly with specific
parcels of land, through purchase, donation and cooperative programs
and are community-supported through memberships, donations and
volunteer involvement.</P>

<P>Conservation easements are voluntary legal agreements between a
landowner and easement holder normally a conservation organization. 
Here the owner voluntarily agrees to restrict future uses of the
property, on title with certain tax concessions.  Both land trusts
and conservation easements may be seen as an alternative to
less-than-successful attempts at resource protection through
traditional planning mechanisms.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Conclusion</B></P>

<P>With some creative thinking, patience and a willingness to work
with a number of people, interested landowners, groups and
associations can accomplish meaningful and substantial projects in
urban areas.  Money and resources are present in the community -
there is a need to connect those interested in funding or working on
environmental projects with those who own land and wish to "do the
right thing".  Information on land management needs to be better
transferred.  Landowner desires for more and better information needs
to be satisfied.  Gaps in programs within urban areas need to be
filled, especially in those urban pockets outside the main centres.
</P>

<P>This will be the challenge of stewardship in urban
Ottawa-Carleton: linking seemingly disparate groups and allowing
effective communication to freely flow between agencies, landowners
and communities while implementing alternatives in: urban design,
securing greenspace, backyard landscaping, maintenance of public
lands and managing urban wildlife.  The possibilities are endless,
the opportunities will become immeasurable and the results should
secure the style of life which this area has become so well-known
for...and accustomed to.</P>

<H3>Curriculum Connections: Ways to Integrate Natural Outdoor
Classrooms at the Intermediate &amp; Secondary Levels</H3>

<P>Phil Weir</P>

<P>Outdoor Educator,</P>

<P>MacSkimming Outdoor Education Centre</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>- Ways of Integrating NATURE and the CURRICULUM </P>

<P>   (Intermediate + Senior Levels -including adults)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>- my background - secondary, special education, outdoor education.
credit courses, MacSkimming </P>

<P>- survey the room - brief background, interests and current
position</P>

<P>- trying to hit on a few points which perhaps haven't been covered
yet at this conference, and hopefully not too much repetition.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>4 Main areas will be discussed:</B></P>

<P>1) "Greening" nearby physical spaces</P>

<P>2)  The Curriculum (We must give credibility and value to nature)
</P>

<P>	- Visiting natural areas (the outdoor classroom)</P>

<P>	- In the indoor classroom</P>

<P>3) "Greening" People (young and old, friends and opponents)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Before Starting, a few coaching tips:</B></P>

<P>- We are talking about values education. ("knowledge, skills,
values")</P>

<P>		e.g. "The natural world is the basis of everything."</P>

<P>- mission statement of MacSkimming and Outdoor Education	</P>

<P>"Helping people to know, to understand and to love the natural
world, and their place in it."</P>

<P>- There are many levels of "Green", or "Natural" (naturalizing)
</P>

<P>	-e.g. plant tree, but what kind?, use fertilizer? tend it?</P>

<P>- Guideline = DO WHAT COUNTS.</P>

<P>- Examine your own mind set, adapt, and try to influence others.
</P>

<P>- Be a positive force. Find ways to sell your ideas and values.
</P>

<P>- Key idea is to have a mind set that looks for ways to include
the natural world where possible in teachings, and actions.</P>

<P>- We have to, in a very personal and creative way, set a good
example.</P>

<P>- The bottom line is courage and determination. Hang in there.
</P>

<P>- Don't be defeated by the magnitude of the task. Emphasize each
win.</P>

<P>- Remember the progress that has been made, and keep working for
the cause in both big and small ways. </P>

<P>- Education is incremental.</P>

<P>- Don't assume people know things. They may not.</P>

<P>- We people who are "up" on environmental issues are still a
minority.</P>

<P>- Be a "Hope-a-holic". - Keep trying, take a break, try some more.
</P>

<P>- Your best allies are: </P>

<P>		THE CARE STAFF (custodial maintenance) and THE PRINCIPAL
</P>

<P>			-get them on your side............. and keep them there. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>PART 1: Greening the nearby physical spaces</B></P>

<P>	<I>(We don't have to shut nature out to have people learn)</I>
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The first curriculum connection is that the physical learning
environment affects all learning.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Fairly easy steps:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>start with your own room's environment, or one you share:
   
   <LI> little or no permission is needed
   
   <LI> make the room' s environment ergonomic, human-friendly,
   alive.
</UL>

<P>	</P>

<P>* plants, plants, plants, flowers, plants, plants.... </P>

<UL>
   <LI>e.g. philodendrons need little light, spider plants,
   
   <LI>or little care, such as jade, African violets, cactus
   
   <LI>remember to water them (don't rely on other staff)
   
   <LI>if student waters, remember to check occasionally
   
   <LI>something natural to look at in a sterile humanscape
   
   <LI>tend them, occasionally change or add
   
   <LI>maybe give a plant or two to other staff?? (hard to turn down)

</UL>

<P>	</P>

<P><B>* air</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>try to get windows open, even slightly makes a big difference
   
   <LI>affects temperature, air quality, smell, sound (e.g. bird
   call)
   
   <LI>even open for only a few minutes then close if necessary
   
   <LI>sometimes for dramatic effect (e.g. storm, wind, birds)
   
   <LI>also opening your door can make a big difference
   
   <LI>if closed air system (air conditioning) complain if
   malfunctioning
   
   <LI>if necessary a fan can help
   
   <LI>might have to ask care staff to help get into shape (e.g.
   sticky)
</UL>

<P>	</P>

<P><B>* light, sunlight, daylight, </B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>"play" the blinds, or curtains -shouldn't stay the same
   
   <LI>aim for as much light as possible, esp.  in winter, or dim
   days
   
   <LI>natural brightness is a shock after a dark hall or other class
   
   <LI>hang tough against pressure -usually it is only habit
   
   <LI>sometimes this can affect seating plan (who likes it?)
</UL>

<P>	</P>

<P><B>* mirrors</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>every class should have one.
   
   <LI>very popular, plus it is like Adding a Window - adds skylight
   
   <LI>position it by the door, or on the door wall = reflects
   windows
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>* pictures</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>photos, posters, artworks, etc. - With SKY in them, or trees,
   etc.
   
   <LI>something non human-centred - put up lots
   
   <LI>like adding a window, a view, an alternative to "THE SUBJECT"
   
   <LI>ambiently, positively "affects visual learners"
   
   <LI>maybe give a picture or poster or two to a neighbor teacher
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>* music</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>at times calming quiet music, or solitude's tapes in
   background
   
   <LI>e.g. during a test , or during seatwork 
   
   <LI>be ready for objections but hang tough (again)
   
   <LI>don't always use the same, don't switch to student tapes,
   unless nature or very calm. - you control volume, etc.
</UL>

<P>	</P>

<P><B>* Furniture/Room Layout</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>if you can, set up to take advantage of windows, natural views
   
   <LI>a few tables with items such as plants, or nature magazines.
   
   <LI>if you can influence purchasing, get away from combo desks
</UL>

<P>	</P>

<P><B>* Note natural events ("Wow look at the storm out there")</B>
</P>

<P>	- we don't exist in isolation from nature - mention it, include
it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Medium effort steps:</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>the school's indoor environment is harder to affect. It
   requires help from:
   
   <P>1) your principal (to back you in the crunches)</P>
   
   <P>-let them know what you're trying to do, why, etc.</P>
   
   <P>- sell it, simply, quickly, give them some ammunition</P>
   
   <P>- give them advance warning of possible controversies.</P>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <P>2) your care staff - they "make it or break it"</P>
   
   <P>- especially the head, but also each individual counts</P>
   
   <P>- sell it to them, and involve them as much as possible</P>
   
   <P>- when trying to change long term values, often patient,
   repeated explaining is needed. (= true for everybody.)</P>
   
   <P>- plants in the school - wherever possible - e.g. offices,
   staff room, library, classrooms, displays</P>
   
   <P>- air in the school - open outer doors on nice days and
   re-oxygenate</P>
   
   <P>- put up pictures, posters, artwork with SKY, TREES, NATURAL
   AREAS, etc.</P>
   
   <P>- these can be simple and inexpensive, or large permanent
   works.</P>
   
   <P>- try not to block off windows (e.g. signs, posters on door
   windows)</P>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>School's outdoor environment
   
   <P>- has been dealt with extensively at this conference, so I
   won't go into detail.</P>
   
   <P>- one preference is for indigenous species plantings, whether
   trees, or other.</P>
   
   <P>- the more natural the better. -the best school is a forest,
   river, mountain.</P>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Long term efforts:
   
   <P>- environmental ethics that lead to use of environmentally
   friendly materials </P>
   
   <P>  and processes in maintenance and custodial work (e.g. type of
   cleansers)</P>
   
   <P>- in some areas Board directives may be needed (e.g. 
   Recycling, Photocopiers)</P>
   
   <P>- saves a lot of individual small efforts, but requires
   lobbying.</P>
   
   <P>- design and architecture of schools to use natural light,
   views, air flows, etc.</P>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>PART 2:  The Curriculum -again this involves one's mind
set.</B></P>

<P>	- Visiting natural areas (the outdoor classroom)</P>

<P>	- In the indoor classroom</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>- About MacSkimming - can modify many ideas to fit other natural
settings</P>

<P>- Self-led trips to other natural areas can be valuable.</P>

<P>- we have to be accountable re: the curriculum and Outdoor Ed.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>2 approaches when planning, or trying to justify to others:</B>
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>1)- What needs doing (e.g. tree planting) --------&gt;
How best to do it.</P>

<P>(fitting an activity to some area of curriculum)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>2)- Curriculum area to cover--&gt; fit to a desired activity</P>

<P>(How to cover a curriculum topic via methods that include nature)
</P>

<P>The curriculum bases are there for including nature.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Common Curriculum  </B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>just read it  - a couple of quotes
   
   <LI>COEO study group working to ensure that standards, tracking,
   etc. include nature, the environment, outdoor/envir. ed.
   
   <UL>
      <LI>- mention COEO membership forms 
   </UL>
   
   <LI>on the local level we have to ensure it is included in
   curriculum documents. 
   
   <UL>
      <LI>- handout on MacSkimming from report
   </UL>
   
   <LI>Transitions formats allow for integrated studies/trips
   
   <LI>OSIS - now almost past tense but equally emphasized nature
   
   <LI>Credit Course in Outdoor Ed. - under Tech, Phys.Ed., etc.
   
   <LI>We also have to combat elitism and ensure opportunities for
   all.
   
   <LI>The importance of EQUITY (e.g. low income, ESL, Sp.Ed.)
   
   <LI>Kinesthetic, aesthetics, values
   
   <LI>Include First Nation viewpoints
   
   <LI>The Leadership connection - outdoor growth opportunities
   
   <LI>REAL LIFE
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
</UL>

<P><B>PART 3: "GREENING PEOPLE"</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>The greening of hearts and minds 
   
   <LI>in some ways the arts side of us needs clout
   
   <LI>The activities of clubs, school leaders, and staff should also
   try to include natural events. 
   
   <LI>overnights are special opportunities
   
   <LI>There is a passive and an active side to outdoor activities
   
   <LI>By setting a good example we encourage others.
   
   <LI>We should look at our own words and our own actions
   
   <LI>Do we integrate nature into our lives?
   
   <LI>Should we be doing more, or something different?
   
   <LI>Remember the different levels of "natural" - are we addressing
   them
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>"A" Ways to integrate the natural outdoor classroom into the
curriculum at the elementary level.</B></P>

<P>Before I begin to talk about curriculum I would like to provide
you with some very brief information regarding my interest in the
topic.  Then I want to demonstrate a quick introductory environmental
activity.  Then I will relate the outdoor classroom to the Common
Curriculum.  Then I will close with some hands-on activities.  </P>

<P>During my years as a primary and junior classroom teacher, one of
my goals was to find ways to get outside and still teach all the
curriculum materials that seemed to be increasing every year.  I'm
convinced that every spring a new curriculum book was given to me
with instructions to start teaching the new program in September.
</P>

<P>  "Going outside is important.  There is so much to do.  How can I
justify being there?"  Those were my thoughts. Frequently I would get
out a curriculum document.  Almost anyone would do.  I would look at
the behaviour objectives or learning outcomes or goals of the program
or whatever titles were used in those first few pages of those fat
books.  Almost always there would be one or more objectives that
could be reached by doing what I wanted to do outside.  The
objectives actually gave me a focus.  Then we would be off to the
great outdoors. </P>

<P> Evaluating the activity was another challenge.  Looking at the
subject integration was the way that worked well.  I'd start
thinking, "That was math -  we looked at repeating patterns.  We
estimated how many dandelions were growing in the playground.  That
was a science skill.  We classified those leaves in so many different
ways.  That was language.  New vocabulary  was developed. That was
art.  The child drew the flower on her Mother's Day card.  It just
went on and on.  Curriculum had been taught.  </P>

<P>I was so interested in integrated studies that I piloted a few
programs for the Ottawa Board of Education.  I also applied for a
leave to write curriculum.  At the very same time the position at
MacSkimming was advertised and I thought it was too good an
opportunity to miss.  I can't stop smiling about the fact that I no
longer have to justify to myself or anyone else why I am outside all
the time.  Although my comments are based on my own experience as a
classroom teacher and as an outdoor educator, I believe my concerns
about curriculum are similar to other teachers everywhere who want to
teach about environmental issues, particularly in the outdoors
classroom.</P>

<P>Let me give you a demonstration of an introductory environmental
activity which is effective for students of all ages: Consider this
apple as a representation of the earth.  Predict how much of the
earth's surface is suitable for growing food.  3/4 of the earth's
surface is water, oceans, rivers, lakes, wetlands  (remove 3/4 of the
apple).What is left is LAND.  1/2 of the earth's land is mountains,
deserts, forests, tundra, icecaps.  (Cut the remaining 1/4 inhalf).
The remaining 1/8 represents all the land that is suitable for
growing food.  (Cut the 1/8 piece into 4 pieces.)Set aside 2 pieces.
These pieces represent the land that is really too steep, too rocky
or the soil is too poor to actually grow food.  Set aside 1 more
piece.  This represents the part that could be used for food but is
buried under cities, highways and buildings that people have
constructed.  This leaves us with 1/32 slice of the earth. (Peel this
one).  This peel represents our top soil, the very thin layer of soil
on which we grow our food.  Our soil is fragile. We need to carefully
conserve this precious resource.  </P>

<P>As you are aware, in its recent restructuring of education, the
Ontario Ministry of Education and Training has clearly enunciated
that the overriding purpose of the entire school program is the
development of interrelated understandings, skills and values as
stated in the Cross-Curricular Learning Outcomes.School boards across
the province are committed to ensuring that the learning outcomes are
met in an authentic real life setting.  An outdoor classroom provides
the site.  </P>

<P>The classroom teacher can provide the curriculum to meet the needs
of the students in the class.  Besides introducing and supporting
knowledge, skills and values the interactive nature of the
experiences outside allows the teacher to identify each student's
location in the curriculum continuum.  Following an outdoor
experience the teacher can refer to the experience in clarifying
abstract concepts with concrete examples.  I will use this
opportunity to reacquaint you with the Ten Essential Learning
Outcomes as stated in the Common Curriculum:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Now think about environmental activities that you could do or
would like to do.  Which learning outcome would the activity `match'?
Also you could think of it another way.  Look at the outcome first.
Then think of an activity to `match' it.  Many Environmental
activities help students integrate classroom learning into the
natural world.  You will note that in the materials that I will give
you, that there are some integrated units which list in detail the
curriculum connections.  Others are just quick 10 minute
environmental lessons that help </P>

<P>young children explore, understand and appreciate the world around
them.  They are all the kind of lesson where you don't have to spend
money and you  don't have to go anywhere on a school bus.</P>

<P>Speaking of 10 minute lessons, this would be a good opportunity
for me to show you one of my favorite environmental teaching tools.
It is the Pot Maker.  It can be purchased from LeeValley Tools for
$12.95.  It is great for a whole class gardening lesson or for a
classroom learning centre.  We'll take a few minutes now and try out
the pot maker lesson.  I will use the format I use with my students.
1) Choose one kind of flower seeds. 2) Take a paper pot. 3) Fill it
half full of soil. 4) Plant 3 seeds all the same kind. 5) Cover the
seeds with 6 mm of soil 6) Take a stick.  Write the name of your
flower and your own name on it. 7) Put the stick in the pot. 8) Make
a paper pot or draw your flower.  Which Learning Opportunity would
this activity "match"?  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I would like to show you a few resources that I have found very
useful for outdoor lessons:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>1) 10 Minute Field Trips  Helen Ross Russell - Natural
</P>

<P>Science Teachers' Association</P>

<P>2) Worm's Eye View  Kipchak Johnson - Millbrook Publishing</P>

<P>3) Kids' Wildlife Book - Warner Shed - Williamson Publishing.  
Helpful workshops from the Ministry of Natural Resources: Project
Wild. They are already cross-referenced Focus on Forest to the
Learning Outcomes in Fishways  "Science is Happening Here".</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Excellent courses for people interested in Outdoor Education are
offered in this area through Northern Illinois University. The
Council of Outdoor Educators of Ontario also sponsors conferences and
courses that are excellent.  "Pathways" is the magazine published for
the Council of Outdoor Educators of Ontario.  KEY Foundation 10 day
conferences are filled with environmental concerns (Knowledge of the
Environment for Youth). </P>

<P>I attended one in Regina two years ago.  They are also free.</P>

<P>Once outside the curriculum can become whatever specific learning
experiences are being provided at the time.  Students should be
encouraged to explore their environment, ask questions, generate,
test, evaluate and create.  They will learn about natural
environments and acquire confidence in their scientific ability. The
message that I'm trying to convey is that the more varied the
experiences a child has, the more chance there is of transferring the
experience into environmental action.  They will know how important
environment is to them. It is important that the students learn facts
during the experience so they develop opinions based on knowledge.  
</P>

<P>One of our objectives is to teach knowledge even when the emphasis
is on process.  I like to think the child has learned at least one
new fact by the end of the lesson.  Sometimes it is the child's
comment that let's me know what the fact should be.  Here is an
example that occurred during one of my recent lessons.  I was doing a
lesson on trees.  Some of the children were looking at the birch
trees with the beautiful white bark.  One little boy said very
seriously "How do you guys paint those trees?".  I decided the fact
of the day had to be `BIRCH TREES HAVE WHITE BARK, WE DO NOT HAVE TO
PAINT THEM WHITE'.</P>

<P>One thing I must say before closing is to put emphasis on safety
skills.  Safety concepts, skills and attitudes related to the
outdoors should be developed and understood by the students before
going outside for the lessons.  Teachers in the outdoor classroom
want students to value the outdoors as a great place to learn, play
and be healthy.  Safety needs to be emphasized to ensure that it is
an enjoyable experience.  In closing, I cannot </P>

<P>emphasize enough how important it is to let children enjoy nature.
 It is clear that we also need to know what the skills, knowledge and
values are that we want to teach. The Common Curriculum will tell us
what learning outcomes are to be met.  It is not known which
variables appear to be the most influential in motivating individuals
to take environmental action but you cannot expect a child or adult
to want to protect something they haven't learned to enjoy.  I
believe that by using the classroom that is outside the school walls
the students will remember the knowledge, skills and values that are
enunciated in the Common Curriculum.  </P>

<P>In this presentation I have attempted to convey to you some of the
connections of curriculum to the natural outdoor classroom for
primary and junior students.  I hope that I have been successful in
convincing you that using the outdoors for your lessons is probably
the most beneficial thing you could do for any student.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Introduction</B></P>

<P>Grant Alternative Public School is located on about 5 acres of
land at 2720 Richmond Rd., Ottawa, Ontario.  The school is part of
the Ottawa Board of Education (OBE).  It opened in September 1991
with 120 students but now has an enrollment of 300.</P>

<P>In order to take full advantage of the school's setting and
greenspace, the school community in November 1991 agreed to accept
the Learning Through Landscapes program as a guide to the future
development of the school grounds.  Consequently, over the next two
and a half years, a long term (25 years) site development plan was
drafted.  The plan was designed to serve as the blueprint for the
development of the school ground.  The main development criteria was
that the plan maximize the site's potential in terms of the formal
curriculum (outdoor classroom), the children's social or play
interaction (provide stimulus for play) and the environmental
attitude of the school.</P>

<P><B>Conclusion</B></P>

<P>It is a long process requiring a lot of work, patience and money
but the end result is worth it.  The school now has a long term goal
to build on and work towards as resources</P>

<P>permit.  In the end it is a benefit for the children and secondly
to the community as it shows there are no quick fixes, that it takes
time and energy.  It also teaches pride</P>

<P>in participation and enjoyment in learning.</P>

<H3>Vegetation Management</H3>

<P>Paul Leale<BR>

VMAP Technology Transfer Specialist<BR>

Science and Technology Transfer Unit<BR>

Ministry of Natural Resources<BR>

Brockville, Ontario (613) 342-8524</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Everyone understands the benefits of planting trees and there are
four steps that must be taken to ensure your trees growth and
survival. The four steps are: (1) planning, (2) site preparation, (3)
stock handling and planting, and (4) controlling the competing
vegetation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Planning and Site Preparation</B></P>

<P>There are many options for obtaining planting stock, including
commercial nurseries, Ministry of Natural Resources nurseries or
growing your own. Creating your own nursery in the schoolyard can be
a useful educational tool. There are books available and people
within your community that may be able to help start such a project.
In your own nursery you can grow wildflowers as well as trees, for
transplanting in and around your school. It is important to involve
custodian staff in school yard projects. They can care for your
projects during the summer holidays.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Use of native tree species is recommended. Native species
alternatives for commonly planted non-native species include:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Austrian pine substitute Pitch, Red or White pine
   
   <LI>Norway maple substitute Sugar, Red or Silver maple (* this can
   be highly invasive in some areas. Please check before planting.)
   
   <LI>European Highbush Cranberry substitute American Highbush
   cranberry
</UL>

<P>Site Preparation is an important step in tree planting. Site
preparation helps control the vegetation and facilitates the actual
planting of the trees. You will find idea's for site preparation in
other sections of the proceeding.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Stock Handling and Planting</B></P>

<P>Arrange to have all the necessary equipment for the tree plant;
shovels, water and planting stock. Make sure your planters are
prepared for the weather (raincoats, sun block lotion, boots).</P>

<P>It's important to handle nursery stock carefully since seedlings
are highly perishable. Keep the amount of time the roots are exposed
to the air to a minimum, handle the stock gently; do not play with
the roots. Following these actions will increase the chances of your
tree's survival and growth.</P>

<P>Trees should be planted properly. Plant trees in a large enough
hole to hold the complete root system. This allows the root system to
become well established and ensures the tree's survival during
periods of hot, dry weather.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Controlling the Competing Vegetation</B></P>

<P>Trees require four elements for growth: water, nutrients,
sunlight, and room to grow. Weeds are more aggressive in consuming
these requirements than trees. By controlling the competing weeds or
tending, tree survival will be ensured. Controlling the competition
is an ongoing job that must continue until the trees are taller than
the surrounding vegetation. Trees generally do most of their own
growing late spring and early summer, therefore, tending is most
effective if done before then.</P>

<P>The method of tending should be decided at the planning stage and
depends on the workforce and equipment available. For example,
applying wood chips around trees provides vegetation control for 1
year but labour is intensive. Three types of vegetation control
commonly used are described in Table 1.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Vegetation Management Alternatives Program of the Ontario
Ministry of Natural Resources is investigating alternative methods of
weed control to reduce the amount of herbicide being used in
reforestation programs. Methods of weed control being investigated
are; mulches, cover crops and tree shelters.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Mulches:<BR>

</B>When placed on the soil around the tree base mulches improve tree
growth and survival. Mulches protect plants from dry conditions by
trapping moisture beneath them. Traditional mulch materials include
wood chips and newspaper. New mulch products include Brush</P>

<P>Blankets (RR), a photo degradable plastic sheet mulch. Table 2
contrasts the advantages and disadvantages of these 3 mulch
materials.</P>

<P>Mulches work by preventing weed growth by blocking sunlight and
act as a physical barrier to weed growth. Mulch will improve growing
conditions for trees by maintaining soil moisture.</P>

<P>Mulches are labour intensive to apply, but are very suitable for
volunteer tree planting projects since volunteer labour will usually
not be available for manual, mechanical or chemical vegetation
control later in the growing season.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

   <LI>Not always effective
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Cover crops:</B></P>

<P>A mixture of white clover and rye grass make an excellent cover
crop that will slow the spread of weeds, thus helping the trees
compete for sunlight, nutrients and water. This reduces the need of
other types of vegetation control. Because they grow low to the
ground, cover crops give seedling's access to sunlight, while
discouraging competing weeds from taking root. While its true cover
crops also compete with seedlings, they are not as damaging as weeds.
Cover crops also enrich and stabilize the soil preventing erosion.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Tree protection</B>:</P>

<P>Trees can be protected by using tree shelters or tree guards. Tree
shelters improve the growth and survival of tree seedlings and
protect them from damage caused by weather, animal browsing and
equipment. Tree guards are used to prevent injury from the weather,
animals and equipment. Weather damages include frost crack. Animal
damage is caused by animals eating the bark or browsing. Voles can
girdle a tree by removing a strip of bark around the tree. Equipment
damage is mechanical abrasion by lawn mowers and weeds trimmers on
the tree's bark.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Tree shelter:</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>Plastic tubes that are placed around the trees when they are
   planted
   
   <LI>Prevents animal damage to the trees
   
   <LI>The shelters are like little greenhouses, which allow light to

   protection (annual inspection)

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Wild flowers are often defined as flowering plants with noticeable
blossoms that grow in the wild unattended by man. There are countless
thousands of wildflowers throughout the world bearing blooms that
range in colour from green to black.</P>

<P>All of our cultivated garden plants have wildflower ancestors and
many are now being introduced to the garden trade, for example
Penstemons, Cardinal flower, Lewisia, Rudbeckias, etc., shrubs, trees
or vines.</P>

<P>Much of this workshop will be directed to growing and selecting
wildflowers for the primarily basic to neutral soils of
Ottawa-Carleton. There will also be a discussion of how to attract
wildlife to your wildlife garden.</P>

There are wildflowers that will grow in most other conditions.</P>

<P>This talk will concentrate primarily on woodland and
oldfield/meadow wildflower gardens as these are probably the easiest
to create on school properties.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Soils</B></P>

<P>Before you start planning a wildflower garden examine your soil.
</P>

<P>Texture- is it gravelly, sandy, silty, clay, non-existent (bedrock
or pavement), compacted?</P>

<P>Organic content- does it need an infusion of organic material
(compost, peatmoss)?</P>

<P>Moisture regime- does the soil get very dry?</P>

<P>is it always dry?</P>

<P>is it always wet?</P>

<P>is there a high water table?</P>

<P>pH level- is the soil acidic or basic?</P>

<P>Other problems- does the soil crack when it drys or heaves in the
winter? (these activities can break plant roots)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Soil Improvemen</B>t</P>

<UL>
   <LI>adding organic material
   
   <LI>mulching
   
   <LI>adding new soil
   
   <LI>breaking up compacted soil
   
   <LI>aerating soils
   
   <LI>improving drainage (if necessary)
   
   <LI>adding slow release organic fertilizers
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Selecting the Type of Wildflower Garden</B></P>

<P>If the property has an abundance of trees a woodland garden is a
natural choice. However if you want a woodland garden and trees are
lacking you can start from scratch as most of the woodland
wildflowers are quite tolerant of full sunlight. Use a mix of fast
and slow growing trees, especially those kind that are attractive to
wildlife.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Some Fast Growing Trees</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>Black Locust
   
   <LI>Pin Cherry
   
   <LI>Black Cherry
   
   <LI>Big Tooth Poplar
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Some Slower Growing Trees</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>Beech
   
   <LI>Sugar Maple
   
   <LI>Blue Beech
   
   <LI>Ash
   
   <LI>Basswood
   
   <LI>Yellow Birch
   
   <LI>Red Oak
</UL>

<P>If the property has large open areas that receive an abundance of
sunlight throughout the day, there are several possible wildflower
garden types that are suitable. These include prarie, old
field/meadow, marsh, bog, and pond.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Designing Your Wildflower Garden</B></P>

<P>Before you start digging up the ground you should have some idea
of the desired "end product" and the basic plan for your wildlife
garden. Here are some suggestions to consider in your design process:
</P>

<UL>
   <LI>add focal points, i.e., weathered logs, old cedar stumps,
   large rocks preferably moss or lichen covered, stone pathways, or
   elegant, striking plants such as Alternate Leafed Dogwood (even
   statuary if you are so inclined.)
   
   <LI>if possible (not too dry an area) use some ferns especially in
   a woodland garden. Their lacy foliage will greatly enhance the
   garden.
   
   <LI>design your garden for easy access so that basic maintenance -
   weeding, pruning, dividing and replacing - can be carried out
   without damaging a lot of plants.
   
   <LI>&nbsp;
   
   <LI>incorporate sufficiently wide interpretation areas for
   students i.e. wide pathways and nodal points
   
   <LI>&nbsp;
   
   <LI>keep wildflower bed widths reasonable i.e. no wider than 10ft
   (standard perennial bed) for easier maintenance
   
   <LI>if there are a lot of trees on the property design a woodland
   garden around them
   
   <LI>consider labeling the wildflowers so that both students and
   the general public can familiarize themselves with the wildflowers
   without interpreters or teachers
   
   <LI>consider positioning the lowest plants closest to the pathways
   and the tallest, farthest away. This will aid in teaching.
   
   <LI>try to intersperse wildflowers that retain their foliage
   throughout most of the growing season with those plants that go
   dormant quite rapidly, i.e., Spring Beauty, Dog's-tooth-Violet,
   Squirrel-corn, Dutchman's-breeches which last about six weeks
   before withering away.
   
   <LI>remember for annuals and biennials to flourish some bare or
   exposed soil will have to be available for re-seeding and
   re-establishment
   
   <LI>select plants that are suitable for your soil type
   
   <LI>observe wildflowers in nature
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Selecting the Plants</B></P>

<P>Try to obtain fairly detailed information about all the plants you
wish to put in your wildflower garden. This will minimize frustration
and disappointment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Questions to ask about a plant:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>height
   
   <LI>spread
   
   <LI>flowering time
   
   <LI>does it die back immediately after flowering
   
   <LI>is it an annual, biennial, perennial
   
   <LI>is dividing required to maintain vigour
   
   <LI>is it weedy or invasive
   
   <LI>does it prefer acid or basic or neutral soil
   
   <LI>does it prefer dry, wet, or mesic soil
   
   <LI>is it drought tolerant
   
   <LI>does it have very specialized requirements that are difficult
   to duplicate i.e. rich, moist organic soil that is well drained
   
   <LI>can it stand competition from other plants
   
   <LI>can it stand being shaded by other plants even if this occurs
   for only a few weeks each year
   
   <LI>is the plant readily available at a reputable wildflower
   nursery
</UL>

<P><B>Note: </B>Don't buy or transplant Pink Lady's, Slippery Orchids
or Mayflower (Epigaea) as they will most certainly die.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Preparing the Site</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>using stakes and string or garden hose lay out the paths or
   walkways
   
   <LI>remove sod or asphalt and all weeds (try to remove all
   dandelion roots as they often sprout new plants)
   
   <LI>wear good garden gloves
   
   <LI>remove any garbage from the soil - old boards, shingles,
   especially nails and pieces of glass
   
   <LI>examine soil carefully - if it needs enrichment take necessary
   action
   
   <LI>&nbsp;
   
   <LI>if soil is lacking or abominable bring in some good top soil
   
   <LI>put focal points such as old stumps, logs, large rocks etc.
   into place
</UL>

<P>If you wish to develop a bog/fen, marsh or pond wildflower garden
(kinds of wetland gardens) it would be best to excavate a hole
between 14 and 20 inches (depending on the type of wetland garden)
and spread several inches of fine sand over the bottom and sides of
the excavation. This can be covered with a felt liner which in turn
is covered by a good quality plastic or butyl rubber liner. Rocks,
assorted pavers or cement flagstones can be used to anchor the liner
at the top edge of the excavation. The plastic liner helps to keep
the desirable water level constant.</P>

<P>Bog/fen gardens and marsh gardens should be about 12 inches deep.
Bog/fen gardens should have the appropriate peaty soil while marsh
gardens have a greater soil type selection ranging from sandy to
silty, often with a good organic content.</P>

<P><B>Note: </B>If you have to add water to your bog/fen garden use
rain water or distilled water. Ponds should be at least 16-18 inches
deep (to grow waterlillies) and should be stocked with fish to
control mosquitoes. If you have aquatic plants growing in pots
remember to cover the soil with about 1/2" of pea gravel. This stops
the fish from digging in the soil and clouding the water.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> There are a number of good books in print that
describe in detail the construction of ponds.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Acquiring your wildflowers</B></P>

<P>It is best to either grow your plants from seed or obtain them
from a reputable nursery - one that does not pillage wildflowers from
the wild but grows them from seed or divisions. There are two
advantages to purchasing live plants:</P>

<P>1. They are generally in pots with a good rootball and are more
likely to succeed than plants dug from the wild.</P>

<P>2. Our local stock of wildflowers is not reduced.</P>

<P>However under certain conditions as when a developer is going to
destroy a site for a housing development or when a new road is being
constructed a wildflower "rescue" is possible. Before you initiate a
"rescue" make sure your soil is compatible and that you have
permission from the developer or construction foreman.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Technique</B></P>

<P>1. dig up as much roots and surrounding soil as possible</P>

<P>2. immediately put into a plastic bag with some extra soil</P>

<P>3. add water or wet paper towel or cloth</P>

<P>4. keep bag closed</P>

<P>5. do not leave bag in full sun or plants will "cook"</P>

<P>6. when replanting dig hole larger than root mass</P>

<P>7. place plant in hole and add extra collected soil around the
roots</P>

<P>8. finish adding garden soil and press down firmly</P>

<P>9. water well and every 2nd or 3rd day until the plant is well
established</P>

<P>10. if there is a drought water as needed</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Using a "Sunshade"</B></P>

<P>To help a plant establish itself more quickly and less stressfully
build a sunshade using four sticks and a piece of white cloth. Leave
in place 7-14 days.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Plants that need Restraints</B></P>

<P>Some plants can rapidly increase their numbers by underground or
superficial stems. If you wish to grow these wildflowers it is
advisable to have long lasting barriers, about 10-14 inches deep
(depending on plant species) around the plants to keep them in bounds
- otherwise they may overrun your wildflower garden.</P>

<P>Examples:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Perennial Sunflowers
   
   <LI>Common Milkwood
   
   <LI>Groundnut
   
   <LI>Wild Roses
   
   <LI>Wild Morning Glories
   
   <LI>Some Asters
   
   <LI>Panicled Dogwood
   
   <LI>Moonseed Vine
   
   <LI>Ostrich Fern
   
   <LI>Braken Fern
   
   <LI>Wild Grape
   
   <LI>Bittersweet Vine
   
   <LI>Mints
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Additional Hints</P>

<P>Woodland Gardens- mulch with old leaves or shredded leaves
especially in autumn (shallow mulch)</P>

<P>Meadow Gardens- in late autumn use a mulching mower to cut down
plants. This will control trees and shrubs in large areas that cannot
be properly managed by a few people. This is a form of mulching
returning organic material and nutrients to the soil.</P>

<P><B>Note: </B>Use the Creating a Wildflower handout for areas with
basic to neutral soils. This contains a list of easy to grow
wildflowers.</P>

<P><B>Myth:</B> Wildflower gardens require no care!</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Attracting Wildlife to your Wildflower Garden</B></P>

<P>If you wish to attract wildlife to your wildflower garden it
should be designed in such a way as to provide nesting and shelter
opportunities for animals and contain plants that produce a fairly
continuous supply of food. Choose wildflowers that produce copious
amounts of nectar and pollen for bees, butterflies, moths, other
insects and hummingbirds. Select plants that produce edible fruit,
i.e., berries or nuts for birds and other animals. Provide host
plants for larval stages of butterflies and moths. Plant groups of
conifers such as cedars or white spruce which provide winter
sheltering for birds. Curtail the spraying of pesticides and
herbicides which are harmful to wildlife and humans. Use biological
controls such as ladybugs to control outbreaks of insects such as
aphids. Have a source of water, i.e., pond.</P>

<P>Although large gardens often offer a better chance of not only
attracting but keeping wildlife year round, small areas that are well
designed can be quite effective in promoting urban wildlife.</P>

<P>The secret to a successful wildlife garden is to follow natures'
designs and principles. Go out and carefully observe woodlands,
meadows and even hedgerows. Well established hedgerows are havens for
wildlife as they often contain a good assortment of food-bearing
tress, shrubs, vines and herbaceous plants. Take notes as to the
species that are growing in your area and pay attention to their soil
requirements.</P>

<P>If you are planning a meadow wildflower garden that is designed to
attract butterflies make sure it is sheltered from prevailing winds.
This can be achieved in a number of ways - preferably with living
materials such as trees and shrubs or by man made structures such as
a wooden fence. Lilac hedges are excellent as their flowers attract
butterflies, moths, and hummingbirds. You could also create a
protective hedgerow by using a variety of native trees and shrubs
that provide both cover and food sources for wildlife. Don't forget
to use host plants in your garden design (See the Butterfly Garden
Plants handout).</P>

<h3>Introduction to the Project</h3>

In September, 1993, our school was directed by the Mount Rundle Board of Trustees to find a solution
to the impact of approximately 500 students playing in the treed area which boarders the 
school grounds. AS one of our school's goals is to promote Environmental Education across the curriculum,
we accepted this project with enthusiasm. We formed an Environmental Committee with representatives from the Town of Canmore, Elizabeth Rummel School,Mount Rundle School Division and Kanaskis
Country. The mandate of the committee was to explore ways to prevent further deterioration of the natural, and to restore the area to its natural state.
<p>
<i>The students had been using the area as a playground. Building forts was a favourite past-time.
This had a very heavy impact on the antural area.</i>

<h3>Getting organized (the Before pictures) </h3>

The forested area was heavily used by students during recess. It was also used by students and the community after school hours. Most of the undergrowth was trampled.
Some trees were dying as their roots were exposed [and/or compacted].

<br clear>
<br>
<IMG SRC="nsabrummel3.jpeg" align=right border=0>
In some areas, rocks and construction debris from neighbouring lots had been disposed of in the forest.
<p>
At one time a cut-line has been cut through the forest. This large space was very heavily used and most of the growth (flowers, shrubs) had disappeared.

<br clear><br>
<IMG SRC="nsabrummel4.jpeg" align=left border=0>

Our committee chose a portion of the forested area to be designated as a Nature Reserve through which we planned to build an interpretive trail.
As well, we planned to re-introduce native plant species to the area.

<p>
We believe that the long term success of the project will depend on the invovlement 
and support of our students and community. We explained our project to the students and explained to them that the area which had been designated as Nature Reservewould be off-limits. We began teaching the students about environmental issues in order to help them understnad and appreciate the diversity
and interrelationship of life in the Nature Reserve and of their impact on the area. WE have encouraged the teaching of environmental issues across the curriculum through such programs as" Project Wild, Learners in Action, and our Envirolypics.

<h3>Transformation - the community in action</h3>

We invited and encouraged community participation. The response, in the form of financial support, expertise and volunteer time and labour, has been wonderful. We couldn't have done it on our own.

<br clear> <p>
<IMG SRC="nsabrummel6.jpeg" align=right border=0>
We received fuinding from <b> The Canadian Wildlife Foundation - Habitat 2000</b> program in order to purchase topsoil for our trees and shrubs. We were also able to purchase some shrubs with this grant.
<p>
We received a grant from <b> The Evergreen Foundation </b> in order to purchase native plants and trees for our re-naturalization project.

<br clear> <p>
<IMG SRC="nsabrummel7.jpeg" align=left border=0>
The <b> Town of Canmore </b> donated 15 trees and delivered them to the school

<br clear> <p>
<IMG SRC="nsabrummel8.jpeg" align=right border=0>
<b> Canadian Western Natural Gas </b> provided a backhoe to dig holes for the larger trees and to help lift the trees.

<p><b> Montane Landscaping </b> provided advice on native species and how and where
to plant. They also donated man-hours to help us plant the trees.
<p>

<br clear> <p><br>
<IMG SRC="nsabrummel14.jpeg" align=left border=0>
We had many willing helpers with the planting.

<p>

Our neighbours kindly allowed us access to their water until we were able to have an outlet installed on the school grounds.

<h3>Creating an Interpretive Trail</h3>

Our Students enjoyed working on the trail system. They helped to remove some of the rockjs and spread wood chips, which were donated by <b> Kananaskis Country </b>,
along the trail.

<br clear>
<br>

<IMG SRC="nsabrummel19.jpeg" align=left border=0>
We received a grant from <b> Active Living - Go for Green </b>, which we
used to purchase interpretive signs. These signs were placed along the trail.

<p>

A grant from the <b> Youth Action Fund</b> was used to have interactive signs made. The information in these signs can be changed as classes complete various activites in the nature reserve.

<h3>Maintenance and the first blooms</h3>

Watering the re-naturalized area was very important. We were pleased when we were able to have a water outlet, which had been buried under the grass, uncovered and made functional.

<br clear><br>
<IMG SRC="nsabrummel22.jpeg" align=left border=0>
Our efforts were rewarded with a profusion of wildflowers which blossomed throughout our Nature Reserve. These were the first flowers to bllom since the school opened.

<h1> What is a native plant? </h1>

<h3>
A widely accepted definition of native for our part of the world is
species that dispersed to and became established in this area before
Euro-American settlement.  This would include species that may have been
introduced by humans who arrived via the land bridge to Asia during the
Pleistocene epoch, (the last ice age) which ended about 10,000 years ago.

Non-native species that are well-adapted to some habitats of a region
and have become securely established (eg in the Pacific North West 
Himalayan blackberry, English
plantain, etc.) are known as "naturalized".  Non-natives that do not
reproduce or persist for more than a few generations without human
intervention are called "waifs".

<h3>
The Evergreen Foundation was been awarded the<A HREF="Druckeraward96.html">
1996 Peter F. Drucker 
Award For Non-Profit Innovation,</a> given annually to the non-profit 
organization that best displays qualities of  innovation and excellence 
in  program management. Evergreen was selected this year for the innovation 
and leadership of its Learning Grounds program.
<p>
According to Peter F. Drucker, the "father of modern business management", 
the purpose of the award is to "find, celebrate, and inspire innovation" 
in the non-profit sector.  "With the growing importance of the 
non-profit sector in society, non-profit organizations face new 
challenges, new opportunities, but above all, growing pressure to change, to 
innovate, to lead," says Drucker.
<p>
"When I heard about the Learning Grounds program I said to myself 
'Of course! Why didn't anyone think of this before?'", 
said Peter Drucker. "When I think back to my childhood in 
Austria almost 80 years ago, I can remember my school as 
resembling a sort of minimum security prison."
<p>
"The award is a great reward after 6 years of dedication and hard work" 
says Geoff Cape, Executive Director of The Evergreen Foundation.

<TITLE> Everett Crowley Park: Ecological Stewardship Process:

<h2>Autumn 1996 Update</h2></center>

The Community-based Ecological Stewardship Process at Everett Crowley Park is coming to an end in October, 1996. For the Evergreen Foundation that is! The Everett Crowley Park Committee is now ready to keep it going.
<p>
Everett Crowley Park is a large, though little known gem in South East Vancouver. It is a park with a very colourful history and lots of community spirit. Set within an urban context and with it's history as Vancouver's former "Kerr Road dump" (1944-1967), the disturbed conditions of the park provide an excellent opportunity for residents to learn about healthy ecosystems. Since the landfill was closed, the site has begun to naturalize with native pioneer species and numerous non-native species many of which are invasive. 
<p>
The Evergreen Foundation has been working with the Everett Crowley Park Committee for over a year to harness community energy and gather the ecological and historical information on the park. The community can then use this to make informed decisions about the future of the park and opportunities to enhance the park's habitat.
<p>
<IMG SRC="nceverettcapilanocrew.jpeg" align=left border=0>
Since the early spring, people have been seen in Everett Crowley Park dragging ropes around, staring into the bushes with binoculars, wandering through tall grasses in single file, looking at test tubes full of stream water, and using lettuce, carrots and onions (hold the dressing) as part of a sheet mulch technique for planting vegetation. Slightly odd behaviour you might think? Well not really, all sorts of people have been out in the park completing numerous studies and projects. 
<p>
Community volunteers, UBC students, Vancouver Natural History Society members, Scouts CAN, Champlain Heights Community school students and Youth Council conducted bird, vegetation,  herptile and stream studies. Environmental science students from Capilano College assessed deciduous, coniferous, riparian and herptile habitat, water and soil; and finally, the Environmental Youth Alliance helped train volunteers in using a sheet mulching technique. Other projects were a park user survey, an historical booklet, and an interpretive map/brochure of the park. 
<p>
The Evergreen Foundation has been coordinating and facilitating these projects for the past year and will be winding up their involvement with an open house and community workshop in October, 1996. It has been a wonderful experience both for the Evergreen Foundation and all those who have participated. 
<p>
The Everett Crowley Park Committee is now keen and equipped to continue exploring, learning and caring for their park.

<h2> What is North America's largest Urban Park?</h2>
<h3>
A recent query to the <A HREF="Richard@Flora.Com"> Tree_House,</a> the Community Forestry listserv, about North America's largest urban park
brought back the answer (as well as many others about big - but not biggest - 
urban parks).

<b>However</B>, a recent story in Canada's National Newspaper about cougars roaming near
Toronto (Canada's megalopolis), alerted me to another Park, even BIGGER. So, here you have
North America's Largest Urban Park: <p>

<b>Rouge Park,</b> Ontario, is the largest urban park in North America, at 11,400 acres.

<p>

It spans the Rouge River to the east of Downtown Toronto, starting north of Markham 
and running to Lake Ontario. For more information, please contact Sue Russell, Rouge Park Council
(416) 287-6843. (The cougar, by the way, are likely pets which were released, but may be surviving.)

<p><br>
 - and the runner up:
 <p><br>
 Published in an article in the Winter '96 issue of 'America
 Forests,' entitled 'Workday Wilderness,' by Bill Donahue ...
<p>
        <b>Forest Park,</b> a thin green expanse of 5,000 acres
        that stretches along the face of the Tualatin Moun-
        tains [created by Portland's City Council in 1948],
        begins just 20 blocks outside the business district.
        It is the nation's largest self-contained urban forest
        -- nothing else even comes close -- and is home to
        a sprawling pastiche of second-growth conifers and
        dotted with a few small, diverse stands of old-growth.
        Sword ferns are ubiquitous in the moist soil here,
        and there is wildlife -- deer, coyotes, great blue
        herons, and even reports of black bears -- and also
        a 27-mile-long path, the Wildwood Trail, that takes
        you past a rose garden, an old mansion, and a creek
        with cutthroat trout ...
<p>
        ... Though Forest Park is by far Portland's largest
        wild place, it is hardly its only one.  Portland has
        about 5,000 additional acres of park land, including
        an extinct volcano and a wetland that is home to Bald
        Eagles.  The metro area is likely to stay green over
        the coming decades:
<p>
        Last May, metropolitan Portland voters decided to
        spend $135 million to buy 6,000 acres to preserve wild
        spaces in the city and the suburbs and small towns
        surrounding it.
<p>
        Most of the money will not go to Forest Park, says
        Nancy Chase, a senior planner with Portland's regional
        government, Metro.  The "open Spaces" program will
        focus instead on saving wild areas that are now un-
        protected and threatened by development ...
<p>
        "We want to secure the wildlife corridor," says Chase ...

At Edmison Heights Public School in Peterborough, Ont., we are now in the 6th
year of our schoolyard naturalization project. Called the "Habitat Area", the
main components include most of the trees and shrubs native to Central Ontario, a
butterfly garden, classroom gardens, a meadow, paths, numerous benches, feeders
and bird houses, the school composter, a brushpile, a rockpile, interpretive
signs, a cedar rail fence and, as of June 1996, a SUN SHELTER. The shelter is a
post and beam, A-frame wood structure with a metal roof. There are 15 seven foot
benches which allow seating for 50 children. The shelter serves both as a source
of shade during recess and an outdoor classroom to compliment the Habitat Area.
<p>
It is proving very popular with the students and seems to be encouraging more
teachers to use the Habitat since there is now a place to gather the children,
complete work sheets in the shade, etc. 
<p>
We are also developing monthly activity sheets that teachers can use with their
students.To further reduce Outdoor Ed. anxiety, we also include an
answer/background information sheet. 

If you have material available that has been developed by other schools, we would be 
very interested in receiving it. Our phone
number is 705-745-0722.

<h2> The Magical <p>
Urban Wilderness:<p>


Spring / Summer '96 Update</h2>

<br clear>


<p><br><br>
		
		
<h3>The Everett Crowley Park Committee</h3>
The Everett Crowley Park Committee is a very spirited and enthusiastic group of local residents and other park users who are interested in preserving the urban wilderness at Everett Crowley Park.
<p><br><b>The mandate of the committee is:</b><br>

"To oversee and involve itself with the continued enhancement and planning of Everett Crowley Nature Park; to preserve it for today's citizens and Vancouver's future generations"

<p>The Committee meets on the fourth Wednesday of each month at 7 pm at Champlain Heights Community School, 6955 Frontenac.

<p><b>Have some fun, get involved and learn about this magnificent park.</b>

<p>The Champlain Heights Community is working with the Evergreen Foundation to enhance the background knowledge and skills the community needs to care for the health of the park. This process involves the community in a variety of exciting projects.  You can participate by preparing a booklet on the colourful history of the park or an interpretive map/brochure; collecting information on vegetation, birds, and park use by people; organizing community events.

<b>WHAT IDEAS DO YOU HAVE? </b>Let us know. Contact Donna Tilley at 437-9115 or Martha at 689-0766.
<p>
<b>The Park User Survey</b><br>
Your input is making a difference.  Response has been excellent for the Everett Crowley Park User survey which went out to the local community on March 8th.  If you are interested in filling one out, they are available at the Champlain Heights Community Centre or call 689-0766.  Results will be available this summer or early fall.

<p><b>The Ecological Assessment </b><br>
Wondering who those people are that you have seen out in the Park dragging ropes around, staring into the bushes with binoculars, looking at test tubes full of stream water?  Community volunteers, UBC students and Vancouver Natural History Society members are conducting vegetation and bird surveys; stream studies are being completed by the Champlain Heights Youth Council and Scouts CAN.  A class from Champlain Heights Community school will be working on a reptile and amphibian study.  Also, Environmental Science students from Capilano College are doing their field school studies at Everett Crowley Park.  They will be donating their detailed research findings to the community. 

<p<b>UPCOMING EVENTS </b><br>
Please call  689-0766 to pre-register for the following events.
<p>

<b>Coyotes: curious or concerned ?</b><br>
 <IMG SRC="coyotesinaline.gif"><br>
 
<p>There will be a presentation about coyotes on Thursday June 6, 1996 7:30 pm at Champlain Heights Community School Library (6955 Frontenac).  Kristine Webber of the Urban Coyote Project will answer questions such as what do they eat? where do they live? what do they look like? what do you do when you see one?  Phone the coyote hotline @ 822-5715 to report coyote sightings or if you have any questions.

<p><b>The Community Vegetation Survey </b><br>
Everyone is welcome! It's a fantastic opportunity to learn more about plants that grow in Everett Crowley Park. You will be guided by experienced surveyors and botanists.  On  May 11, June 8 and June 22, gather in the Kerr Road parking lot at 9 a.m.

<p><b>Sounds of the Solstice </b><br>

June 23 & 4 pm in Everett Crowley Park.<br>
Come and sense the music of Everett Crowley Park flowing through the trees. Celebrate music and the Solstice at a free family event.  Original melodies for the Flute, French Horn and Alto Saxophone have been written in tribute to Everett Crowley Park by Lowell Morris, a local resident.  Donations appreciated.Ê

<p><b>Kerr Road Sidewalk</b><br>
The City plans to repave Kerr Road.  They are also building a sidewalk on the east side of Kerr Road, along the edge of Everett Crowley Park, north from South East Marine Drive.  For more information please contact Martha Norman at the Evergreen Foundation, 689-0766 or Donna Tilley, 437-9115 or Celine Rich at the Discovery Project, 876-6052.

<p><b>How to Get There: </b><br> Everett Crowley Park can be accessed from the parking lot on Kerr Road, just south of 63rd Ave. or behind the Champlain Heights Community Centre playing fields.

<h2>School Yard Environmental Projects:<br>
 A Planning Primer </h2>

Prepared by<br>
Mark A. Megalos, Extension Forestry Specialist<br>
Barry New, Extension Associate<br>
North Carolina State University<br>
Forestry Division<br>
<p>
Many teachers, parents, and administrators are realizing the benefit of enhancing school yards and grounds for environmental education. The challenge for most is how to transform their good intentions into fruitful and positive results. This note describes the planning steps and other practical considerations to establish successful trails, outdoor classrooms or other environmental education improvements on school grounds. The final sections deal with important educational curriculum, programs, and resources available to school systems within North Carolina.
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
The interest in environmental education for youth is at an all time high. The Cooperative Extension Service receives many requests to assist schools hoping to capitalize on outdoor activities and opportunities available on their schools grounds. In an effort to supply interested schools with critical planning steps and ideas, we've compiled the following information gleaned from years of experience working with successful projects.
<p>
This document is arranged in the typical order that a school follows in
implementing a successful environmental education effort. The chapters are fairly self-contained and can be read in any order to match the needs of the user. The appendices will aid you in the planning effort to help coordinate, prioritize and schedule your efforts for maximum success. A common theme is stressed throughout this paper: "Strive to include all of the potentially impacted parties and the stakeholders that can benefit from a coordinated environmental education effort." 
<p>
<h3>Needs</h3>
Every school is in need of special attention: new paint, materials, A-V equipment...... and resources are scarce. Often times the request for additional funds for outdoor classrooms or nature trail can be viewed as another luxury that the school can't afford. One successful method is to "piggy-back" or promote your environmental project as a solution to an existing problem. Propose an environmental education project that will solve an existing problem (erosion, littering, beautification needs). Be proactive in your requests. Look for an initial project that can be completed "in-house" and will address an existing need or rectify an eye-soar, potential hazard while building school spirit. 
<p>
Start small and address a need. Establish a reputation as a team player and build a supportive team that will help your accomplish subsequent projects. In the process you'll be developing an awareness in your student of the environmental concerns around the school and, more importantly, the opportunity to solve problems with a "Team Approach." 

<p>

Begin by making a "needs-list" of the school grounds. Your list should be all inclusive. Cover the items needed to make your school a show place, including beautification, landscaping, appearance, recreation, any other outdoor enrichment opportunities useful across all disciplines. The list might seem too inclusive to begin with but it will afford you the opportunity to visualize the potential to influence future school improvements with an environmental education message, lesson or impact. For instance, any future landscape planting can include wildlife beneficial and native plants. Mulch application can turn into a science experiment where natural materials are compared with recycled newsprint or other materials for costs, efficacy, beauty and benefit.
<p>
<h3>Project Possibilities: What's Are the Options? </h3>
At this point you may need to look at the breadth of environmental education projects that can potentially be conducted on your school property. The following section list many of the successful project that a feasible on school grounds.
<p>
Nature Trail <br>
- Planned trails provide students areas to learn, recreate, observe and interpret nature. Trails offer low-cost access to natural surroundings and require little maintenance when properly constructed. Trail design should be set by the needs and interests of your intended users. Needs will vary with age, physical ability and interests. For a detailed treatment of trails, request Recreational Forest Trails, WON - 29 from your local Cooperative Extension Service Center. 
<p>
Greenhouse/Cold Frame 
<br>- For the serious biology class interested in studying plant growth, floriculture or agriculture a green house may be a worthy environmental education project. A cold frame may fit the bill where winter protection and early spring seedling production is your goal. See HIL-404 Low Investment Propagation-Winter Protection Structure from your local Cooperative Extension Service Center and Recreational Buildings and Facilities, Ag, Hnbk. 438 available from Extension Forestry (address on page 11).
<p>
Hummingbird-Butterfly Garden
<br>- Students can attract and support hummingbirds and butterflies by the planting of beneficial plants on school grounds. Procedures are available in Hummingbirds and Butterflies - WWW-20
from your local Cooperative Extension Service Center. 
<p>
Composting Demonstration 
<br>- Decomposition and renewal of nutrients are brought to life to students with an active composting demonstration. Procedures and details are available in Composting for Home Gardens - HIL-8100 and Backyard Composting from your local Cooperative Extension Service Center.
<p>
Vermiposting 
<br>- Where outdoor space is limited bring worms into your classroom. Vermiposting uses redworms to teach the message of decomposition and recycling to life in a small container. Details are available in many naturalist books and the classic: Worms Eat My Garbage, M. Applehof, 1982. Flower Press. Kalamazoo,MI. 
<p>
Wildlife Feeders 
<br>- Attracting birds to your school campus can be a great way to introduce students to wildlife identification and nature. Check your local library for resource books or see How To Attract Birds, K. Burke. 1983. Ortho Books, San Francisco. 
<p>
Wildlife Plantings 
<br>- Planting for wildlife can be a great way to enhance the school property, control erosion and add diversity to the school landscape. Technical assistance, plant recommendations and sources of commercial wildlife materials are available from the NC Wildlife Resources Commission.
<p>
Wildlife Observation Stations 
<br>- In the right locations wildlife blinds offer a low-cost way for small groups to observe birds and other common wildlife. Rural schools with adjacent timbered property or water bodies lend themselves to the placement of blinds for pre-school and afterschool viewing by small clubs.
<p>
Wildlife Tracking Station
<br>- School-sized classes don't lend themselves to great wildlife viewing, however tracking stations can provide wonderful learning opportunities. A "track station" is a prepared area where animals will imprint the ground. Most commonly bait or some lure is placed to attract wildlife during the night. Details are available in Animal Tracks, 4-H Wildlife Project # 438. from your local Cooperative Extension Service Center.
<p>
Timber Measurements Plot
<br> - One of the simple ways to get students interested in math, measurements and the out doors is with a timber measurements plot. Students use trees to learn about height and volume measurement of standing trees. Details are available in Measuring the Volumes of Standing Trees...WON-5 and Handy Tables for Measuring Farm Timber, AG 119 from your local Cooperative Extension Service Center. 
<p>
Wildlife Exclosures
<br> - One of the most dramatic ways to learn about the impact of wildlife on vegetation is through a wildlife exclosure. Low-cost fencing is erected to keep deer, rabbits and other wildlife from a small space. Over time students document vegetation changes and draw conclusions about the impacts of wildlife on habitat. 
<p>
Outdoor Classroom/Amphitheater 
<br>- Expanding the use of outdoor facilities often takes the form of low-cost, low maintenance benches and a podium. Many schools already have a natural amphitheater waiting to be developed. Plans are available from Extension Forestry. 
<p>

Successional Vegetation Plots 
<br>- Plant succession is the orderly progression of vegetation from bare soil (disturbed land) to mature forest. By sectioning off small plots and protecting them from mowing and other management students can track the vegetational changes that occur. A series of three to five annual plots can be installed on unused hillsides or tough to mow areas that will grow into a living experiment for science and biology classes
<p>
Historical / Cultural Resource Interpretation
<br> - Historical and prehistorical activities can be a great addition to social studies and history curricula. Recreations of historical landscapes and hands-on activities of pottery crafts, flintknapping, primitive tools and colonial life can be the focus your outdoor classroom. Year-round usage helps to instill an appreciation of the hardships of our predecessors. Local historians, craftpersons and reenactment enthusiasts can help bring life to history texts individually or as a day long, school-wide program.
<p>
Experiment / Learning Stations 
<br>- Special features and opportunities for environmental education exist on all school grounds, such as: water treatment facilities, old trash dumps, wetland areas, streams, gullies, exposed geological features, forest stands, and the like. To take maximum advantage of these opportunities you must know of their existence, appreciate their worth and develop them to a safe, useful capacity. In most cases, safe pathways and a small congregation area are all that is needed to develop these sites. Other sites might require experiment benches, storage lockers for equipment or other low cost improvements. Check your environmental education curriculum for ideas. Remember, the purpose is to expose the students to the outdoors, therefore maximize activities while minimizing infrastructure. 
<p>

<h3>Thinking it Through</h3>
Begin with a brief exercise of documenting the purpose and intent of your efforts? Why is this needed? Who will it benefit? How will it be accomplished?
Is it needed? Is it a duplication of effort? Who will maintain it? Will it be used? What's the life expectancy of the project? 
<p>
Project Effort:<br>
Need:<br>
Purpose:<br>
Audience:<br>
Potential Players:<br>
Life Expectency:<br>
Who'll have ownership:<br>
<p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
The next step in planning a school environmental project is to list the potential resources (property, materials and organizational support) available to plan and conduct the anticipated environmental education projects. The procedure can take the form of an administrative mandate ( quickest method but least favored) to a cooperative brainstorming effort with all interested parties ( most involved method with the greatest chance for success).
<p>
How does the momentum begin? Typically an enthusiastic teacher (often a biology or science coordinator) has seen a successful nature trail or outdoor classroom and hopes to replicate that program at their school. That key individual makes a few calls and discusses the possibility with other teachers with in a team and hopefully has garnered some support from school administrators. At this point a contact is made with the local cooperative Extension Service office to determine the extent of technical support and guidance available. The recommendation is made to make an inventory of the assets on hand that can make the mission possible.
<p>
List the human resources available. These can be teachers, parent volunteers, student clubs, classes, teaching assistants, ground maintenance crews, local scouting groups, garden clubs, or even community service workers. The length of your possible resources list will give you a fair assessment of the likelihood for success on large scale projects. The following section provides a list of resources (partners) that can aid your project.
<p>
<h3>Resource Partners</h3>
Successful projects only come to fruition with the aid of many partners. We've divided them into three important groups by purpose:, Labor/Physical, Material Suppliers, and Potential Funding Sources. <p>
Surprisingly if you can line-up the appropriate partners in the first two categories, the third ( and often dreaded) group is minimized in importance.
<p>
Labor/Physical/Technical Support:<br>
Student/ Faculty,
Parent Volunteers,>
Scouting Groups,
After School Clubs,
Civic Groups,
Gardening Clubs,
Resource Agencies,
Master Gardeners,
Forest Industry,
<p>
Suppliers / Materials: Many low-cost or free materials are available for the asking or recognition of the source. These include: mulch, wood chips, railroad ties, power poles, lumber, building materials and hardware. The following groups can often supply needed materials as a favor or as a part of their community outreach:

<h3>Determining What's There</h3>
Surprisingly, few individuals actually have seen the back portions of school properties to know the full extent or potential to develop environmental education projects. Begin by collecting a plat map or surveyor's sketch of the property to determine property boundaries. A plat map will show the location of buildings, ball fields and parking lots, and water treatment facilities. Plat maps give a rough idea of the area that will be "leftover" and can be developed for environmental purposes. These maps are often available from your county school administration office (planning and building maintenance department). 
<p>
Additionally, your local offices of the N. C. Forest Service and Consolidated Farm Services Agencies can be contacted to obtain an aerial photograph of the property. An aerial photo can aid in determining vegetation types, stream locations and the general land uses adjacent to the school property. While at the Consolidated Farm Services agency ask for a photocopy of a topographic map of the property that illustrates the elevation changes on the property. Likewise an elevation map may be available from the architect that designed the school originally. Elevation maps, property maps, building blueprints and other important planning documents are often kept by your county school administration or planning office and can be requested from them. 
<p>
After obtaining the maps and photos listed above circle potential areas that may be suitable for environmental education use. Then arrange a afternoon when an outdoor education specialist or professional can walk the property with you to check the usefulness, site conditions, and any potential safety or liability issues related to the site. Often times this can be done by the school staff itself. 
<p>
Don't be surprised if little natural space is available. Most school sites are leveled to the maximum extent possible to keep construction costs low and to develop field sports areas. "Leftover areas" are often the hillsides, slopes or streams that couldn't be leveled or resulted from the leveling process itself. Often construction debris, rocks and even school related trash are concentrated in these areas making development for educational use a struggle. Don't be discouraged! The initial walk through will help you prioritize needs, realistically assess what's there, evaluate the workload, and help (re)focus your purpose.
<p>
Some schools have addressed the trash problem in a proactive fashion - using the clean-up process as a learning opportunity. In a similar fashion to the NC Big Sweep Program, students collect trash, separate it into several categories (glass, plastic, aluminum, construction waste, sports equipment, etc.) and weigh it. Then a report can be drafted (with graphical representations of each waste category) and presented to the school administration and maintenance staff with suggestions for future reduction of litter on the school property. The students will be involved, and school ownership, pride and knowledge will soar. 
<p>
<b>Adjacency Issues / Property Lines<br></b>
The importance of locating and respecting property boundaries can not be overstated. Legal, trespassing and liability issues related to property are serious concerns and are crucial to the long-term success of any project. Often an adjoining landowner may have serious reservations regarding the student use and unintended attraction to their property. Be sure to respect and account for adjacent landowner concerns about the development of a trail network that could lead to vandalism, resource abuse or student loitering. 
<p>
The best solution for many of this issues is to meet with all parties prior to the layout of any construction project. By envisioning the future and sharing concerns , adjustments and reassurances can be made to create a "win-win: situation. Nothing is more important than the reputation of a school in the community and risking that reputation over a failure to communicate with neighbors should be avoided at all costs. 
<p>
<b>Safety/ Clean-up<br></b>
One of the critical components of planning any project on school grounds is to maintain the health and safety of the students and staff. During the initial walk through of the property you may be aghast at the condition of the school property at the margins of ball fields and creeks. The extent of old tires, trash, construction and school-related debris may be a shock to most teachers and certainly to the environmentally oriented students. Trash an other potential hazards must be noted and dealt with from the onset of a project. Likewise, if certain hazards can not be removed they must be fenced or physically excluded from proposed project to maximize student safety and minimize liability.
<p>
<b>Maintenance<br></b>
The enthusiasm at the start of the project can only be maintained if there is a strong commitment to maintain a project throughout its intended lifetime. The key is to secure "shared-ownership" of the project so that it's continued survival isn't dependent solely on one individual. Often times a key teacher is promoted, transferred or is reassigned duties and can not maintain the scope of the project. The best insurance against project abandonment is to have broad base support and "buy-in" throughout the effort.

<h3>Curricula Integration Across Disciplines/Grades </h3>
Fortunately, you do not have to dream up activity ideas for all or any of the projects listed above, because they already exist in a multitude of formats in award-winning environmental education curriculum. The challenge is to utilize your outdoor projects across multiple classes and curriculum. Much of this work has already been accomplished and documented in the following curricula. All is available free and may already exist in your school. Other curriculum requires attendance in a sanctioned program before you can receive the training material. In any case, take advantage of the resources available to you within your town and county, or attend a workshop to receive the material (most offer teacher recertification units and are a real pleasurable learning experience.

<h2>Greening your School Ground <p>

A Working Manual 1995 </h2>



<br>

<h3>Written by Linda George <p>

 

Environmental Educators' Provincial Specialist Association </h3></center>



<br> <br> <br>



The Greening your School Ground - Working Manual is 

provided for use by Parent Advisory Committees (PAC's), 

students, teacher groups, and others wanting to create shade 

and naturalization areas on school grounds. It will give school 

community groups the knowledge to take the first steps toward 

initiating a Green a School Ground project. <p>







Written by Linda George on behalf of 'The Environmental Educators' Provincial

Specialist 

Association' (EEPSA). Printed with the financial assistance of Canada Trust: 'The

Friends 

of the Environment Foundation'. The illustrations  were done by Kim Denman.

<h3>Acknowledgements: </h3><p>



Many people have generously given their time, energy and knowledge to assist with

the making 

of the Greening your School Ground - Working Manual. A big thanks to all of you!

In particular, 

a special thanks goes out to Kim Denman, a parent at Hyland Elementary, who spend

many 

hours of 'hands on' experimentation to find a workable process. Peter Kreuk, Rob

De Gros, Bill 

Skerrett, Harold Reesor, Steve Lott,  Edith Bettison and Paulus Vrijmoed were

invaluable 

sources, at various stages of the manuals development, with their encouragement

and technical 

advice. The students themselves have been an inspiration, showing the path to

school community 

stewardship, with their enthusiasm, questions and caring attitudes. <p>



The printing and distribution of the manual would not have been possible without

the generous 

support of Canada Trust: 'The Friends of the Environment Foundation'. <p>



This manual is now available on The Evergreen Foundation's Internet site:

<h3><a name = intro>1. Introduction</a></h3>



Many school community groups today wish to plant shade trees and 

naturalization areas on their school grounds, but to transform wishes to 

reality is not a simple task. While there are a number of excellent books 

available outlining the benefits of naturalization, there little information 

available detailing the actual nuts and bolts of undertaking a project.  

<p>



The purpose of  the 'Greening your School Ground - Working Manual' is 

to provide a practical guide for school community groups so that they can 

successfully undertake a planting project with the maximum educational 

value and the minimum hassle. <p>





The Working Manual provides a guide for novice 'greening' enthusiasts by 

offering planning strategies, hints on design and maintenance, and sample 

letters and forms to facilitate the permission, communication and fund 

raising aspects of a project. The Recommended Hardy Plants Lists,  

(Appendix D) will help the school community decide on suitable plants 

for the different areas of the school ground. Appendix A profiles school 

ground management responsiblities, Ministry recommendations and legal 

implications.

<p>



The pages of the manual are designed to be placed in a binder to which  

notes, letters, replies, copies of plant orders, funding applications, etc can 

be added. The manual is meant to be a tool for organizing a school ground 

planting project.

<h3><a name = planning4>SAMPLE: 

A letter to the District Ground Maintenance Department informing them of the

school's 

intent and requesting a copy of  a site plan which indicates the school's

infrastructure . </h3>



<p>





Manager,<br>

Ground Maintenance Department,<br>

____________School District.<p><br>



Dear________________,<p>



The students, PAC and staff would like to design an 'Outdoor Classroom' 

landscape plan for the area __________________. The PAC are planning 

to apply for funding from __________________. I fully support the 

project and I intend to be kept informed of all aspects of its development. 

I will apply to your department for approval of the draft plan before 

proceeding with the project. I understand that our school community will 

be responsible for the maintenance of any new landscaped area. <p>



To assist with our planning of the area I would like to have an enlarged 

photocopy of the school ground site plan, including the school's 

underground infrastructure. I'd like to know the location of the sewer, 

water, gas, electrical lines, catchment basins, etc. I need to ensure that the 

landscaping will not interfere with there functions. The infrastructural 

plan will be kept confidential. An outline of the fire exit requirements and 

the fire lane plan would also be helpful.<p> 



I look forward to hearing from you soon.

<p>

Yours Truly,<p>

<h3>SAMPLE: 

A letter to the District Ground Maintenance Department requesting final approval

 of the landscaping plan. </h3>

<p>







Manager,<br>

Ground Maintenance Department.<br>

 _______________School District, <p><br>

<p>

Dear _______________,<p>



Thank you for discussing with me on ______________________the 

'Outdoor Classroom' landscape plan for the area 

______________________. The copy of the school's infrastructure that 

you sent me is much appreciated.  Enclosed is a map indicating the  

location and a draft plan of a proposed outdoor classroom. We request 

your approval for the draft plan. As you know the PAC plan to apply for 

funding from ____________________. They are hopeful that the funding 

permission will be granted within the next month or two.<p>



The trees have been positioned so that there mature canopy will not 

overlap the school roof, or the sports fields. Consideration has been given 

to, fire access, safety and the school's underground infrastructure. The 

plants have been positioned to give the students a place of refuge from 

intense sun-rays. We have enclosed a list of the plant species selected and 

the rationale for our choice.  <p>



We understand that we will be responsible for the maintenance of the 

outdoor classroom, and we will do this with the help of the students in the 

Environment Club and with volunteer parents. 

<p>

The staff, the PAC executive and the students are supportive of the 

project. We look forward to meeting with you soon to discuss your 

viewpoint of the proposed project. Please let me know when we can 

arrange a meeting.<p>



Yours Truly,

<p>

<h3><a name = hints>3.  Helpful Hints</h3>

<h3><a name = hints1>Maintenance Considerations</h3>



Suggested Planting Guidelines:<br>

Each school district will differ in their planting guidelines. Check with your

local Ground 

Maintenance Department.<p>



WATER: <br> Decide on the method of watering plants. Plan for water access during 

the summer months (obtain a tap key).<p>



ROOTS:<br> Don't plant large trees, that have invasive root systems, near water/ 

sewer /gas/ electrical / and drainage lines. Small shrub gardens are acceptable.<p>



EMERGENCY EXITS:<br> Keep a clear area of 6m in front of doorways and fire 

exits. Don't plant tall grasses next to the school building as they may be a fire



hazard.<p>



BUILDINGS: <br>Keep big trees 4m from school buildings. Small trees and shrubs 

are acceptable as foundation plants. <p>



PORTABLES:<br> Consider planting hardy, inexpensive trees near portables (many 

portables will stay in schools for decades). Be aware that any trees, planted in 

future truck access routes, may have to be re-located. 

<p>

TREE CANOPY: <br>Avoid placing tall trees in positions where the canopy will 

eventually extend over the school building roof. <p>



SPORTS FIELDS:<br> Plant trees 4-5m back from sport playing fields, so that the 

tree canopy doesn't enter over the playing field. Consider a grove of trees

adjacent 

to a playing field, or between playing fields, to offer students a place of

refuge 

from the sun. Ideally the grove should be located on the West or North side of

the 

field. Planting in these directions leaves some areas in sun, yet provides a

refuge 

to move in to.

<p>

NEIGHBOURS: <br>In respect for your school neighbours, request their input before 

planting along a fence line. Tall trees south of a neighbour may block the

sunlight 

from their garden. 

<p>

DRAINAGE: <br>Drainage lines are often along fence lines. Don't use trees that have 

a 'water loving' root system near a drainage line.

<p>

WATER CATCHMENT BASINS:<br> Plant away from areas where leaves will 

block water catchment basins (run off from ashphalt areas).

<p>

ADVENTURE PLAY GROUNDS:<br> Plant on the West or North side of an 

adventure playground so that the trees can provide a filtered shade refuge, for

the 

children, from the sun. A shaded adventure playground may get slippery.

<p>

GARDEN SIZE:<br> Design low maintenance, naturalized areas. Don't plant a 

garden area larger than the school community can maintain over time.

<p>

MOWING CONSIDERATIONS: <br>

<UL>

	<LI>It is easier to mow the lawn when the trees are in a straight line. 

	<LI> Check with your maintenance department as to the mower cutting 

	width. Most mower cutting widths are 3 metres wide. Allow a 3 metre 

	space between trees. 

	<LI> Consider placing landscaping tyes, logs or rocks to define a newly 

	planted area. Check with your local maintenance department on their 

	preferred  form of barrier. A barrier will  minimize tractor and weedeater 

	damage. Other methods of  protecting new trees from tractor damage are 

	to use rubber 'garden edging' and/or  Big O strips (slit).  Rows of 70 cm  

	upright logs make an inexpensive, yet effective barrier. Secure the logs in 

	concrete. If tree bark is damaged, the tree may not live.

	<LI> Oval shaped gardens, with a wide tractor tray swing, can be easier to 

	mow around than rectangular shaped gardens. 

	<LI> Trees with small leaves are preferred, in high use areas, as they will be 

	mulched by the lawn mower. 

</UL>



MULCH:  <br>Use organic, composted mulch. Organic, composted mulch (20cm 

thick) will retain water, control weed growth as well as add nutrients to the

soil. 

Add new mulch every couple of years. Avoid using bark mulch on gardens.

<p><br><br>





<h3><a name = hints2>Design Considerations</h3>



PRIORTIZE:<br> It's a good idea to plant large trees first, to set the stage and to 

provide shading for later plantings. Look to the edges of the school site to 

determine periphery things that can be done.

Areas that are adjacent to existing natural areas are often ideal for an

extension of 

native plantings.<p>



SPECIES SELECTION: <br>

<UL>

	<LI> Do an analysis of the soil for fertility, drainage and moisture before 

	selecting plant species. 

	<LI> Consider planting a mix of fast growing deciduous trees and slower 

	growing coniferous trees so that the playground can be shaded as soon as 

	possible. 



	<LI> When planting in open spaces, choose tree species that have a wide 

	range of tolerances to moisture and shade levels. Large dark green leaves 

	usually means that a plant prefers shade. Small light coloured leaves 

	usually means the plant likes full sun (but there are exceptions to the rule).

	<LI> Most native plants will not survive in the disturbed hard packed soils 

	that are found immediately adjacent to school buildings. Extensive soil 

	conditioning will most likely need to be done before planting natives near 

	school buildings.

	<LI> Native plants from the southern pacific coast states may have better 

	resistance to global warming factors than our own native species. Look for 

	trees with a wide southern distribution. 

	 <LI> Species that have a southern latitude distribution will have more 

	tolerance to light, however they need also  to withstand our frosts.

	<LI> Species that occur in nature, with a broad goeclimatic zone, are most 

	likely to be tolerant to different conditions. 

</UL><p>



AESTHETICS: <br>

<UL>

	<LI> When placing a bench in a treed area, have the bench facing a large 

	open space. When possible, place benches facing West or South with a 

	<LI>tree behind it.

	<LI> A row of shade trees on a slope is attractive. Slopes often have good 

	drainage, although stability and seepage can sometimes be an issue.

	<LI> Prevent erosion on a steep bank by placing log steps (they are great to 

	sit on and to jump from.)

	<LI> Check the balance of plant colour and plant fragances in your 

	landscaping plans.

</UL><p>



WET AREAS: <br>In wet areas plant water loving plants or raise the planting bed 

about 20cm to prevent the roots of the trees from sitting in water. 

<p>

SOIL CONDITIONING: <br>Many of the native trees like acidic soil. The hard 

packed soil adjacent to school buildings is usually alkaline. Add peat to make

the 

soil acidic. 

<p>

PLANTERS: <br>Trees in planters should have the base of the roots actually 

touching at ground level. Do not raise soil level more than 20cm from ground 

level. Be prepared to water raised planters often as they tend to dry out quicker

than ground level plantings.

<p>

BUILDING STRUCTURAL DAMAGE:<br> Most trees, if they are planted with a 

wide base of topsoil, will not cause structural damage to a school building.. 



<p>

UVB RAYS:  

<UL>

	<LI> Ideally you want to look for trees that will have early spring leaf 



formation, so that the children have some protection from the strong 

spring UVB rays.



<LI>Rather than actually shading a playground, create a shade area to the 

East or North of the play ground. The students will naturally take refuge 

into treed areas when they need a break from direct sun rays. The sun rays 

will filter through the trees.

</UL>

<p>

ALLERGIES: <br>Avoid planting trees that produce excessive amounts of airborne 

pollen as some students may be allergic to the pollen. 



PLAY VALUE:<br>

<UL>

	<LI> Include in your design  quiet, reflective spaces where small groups of 

students can gather. 



<LI> Consider a grouping or row of large rocks be included in the design. For 

safety reasons, ensure that rocks have no sharp edges and that they are 

spaced far enough apart that children won't get their feet caught.

</UL><p>

VANDALISM:<br> To minimize vandalism, choose deciduous trees with at least a 

5cm trunk diameter. Coniferous trees are less susceptible to vandalism and can be

somewhat smaller (2m tall).<p>



PROWLERS: <br>

<UL>

	<LI> From convenient viewpoints, the playground supervisors should be able 

	to have a reasonably clear view of all areas on the school ground.

	<LI> For safety reasons plant shrubs that will grow no higher than knee 

	height. 

	<LI> Prune mature trees to the shoulder height of an adult. Plant low shrubs 

	or ground cover at the tree base.

	<LI> Consider planting tall oregon grape, native black hawthorn or pine in 

	areas where you want to discourage prowlers. 

</UL>

<p>

ROTTING TREES:<br> Rather than removing a rotting tree, consider keeping it as a 

wildlife tree for woodpeckers and cavity nesting  birds. Cut off any rotting 

branches so that they won't be a safety hazard. 

<p>

CULLING:<br> A forest culled of trees does not have a good survival rate. The water 

table changes.

<p>

TIMING:<br>

<UL>

	<LI>  Deciduous trees with a 5-6cm caliper usually come packaged as 'Ball 

	and Burlap'(B&B) rather than in a container. Plant them before the green 

	leaves have appeared (March). Container plants are somewhat more 

	flexible and can be planted later than B&B.

	<LI> Native deciduous trees with a 5-6 cm caliper can be difficult to find in 

	Nurseries. 

	<LI> To ensure that the plants on your purchasing are available it may be 

	necessary to order plants a year in advance. 

	<LI> Every nursery has a bargain area that is worth checking for low prices. 

	Most nurseries clear out their stock in late fall to make space for Xmas 

	tree sales.

</UL>

<p>

ETHICS:<br> Purchase local native plants from a nursery that propogates their own 

trees. 

<p>

MEASUREMENTS:<br> Most measurements on old school sites are in inches and 

feet and may need to be converted to metres.

COMMUNITY PROJECT<br>

 An Outdoor Classroom<p>



RATIONALE FOR LOCATION: <br>

The site of the outdoor classroom is south facing. It is immediately next to the

school 

building and backs onto three primary classes. It is heavily used as a

throughfare to other 

parts of the school. It sometimes gets slippery during the winter. It is under

utilized as a 

play/learning area. The parents of the primary students use the area to drop off

and pick up 

their children. The parents often have pre-schoolers with them. The area is

basically used as 

meeting place for many people in the community. <p>



GOALS of the Outdoor Classroom: 

<UL>

	<LI> to provide an outdoor classroom setting

	<LI> to create and area that is more livable

	<LI> to provide an opportunity for children to experience the natural world

	<LI> to provide shade from UVB rays

	<LI> to improve the passive play/learning value of the area

	<LI> to foster student and community stewardship of our school ground

	<LI>to teach about native plants and their wildlife and historical uses

	<LI>to provide a wider path in front of the primary wing (to safely access the

	outdoor classroom and the play ground)

	<LI> to provide seating

	<LI> to design a low maintenance space

</UL>

<p>

BENEFITS of an Outdoor Classroom: <br>

<UL>

	<LI>community decision making process;

	<LI>the student and school communty

	 participation;

	<LI>  the

	opportunity  

	for positive social and environmental change, 

		<LI>opportunities for cross-curricular

integration; 

	<LI>the positive educational play and learning value;

	<LI> and the shade protection for

	students from 

	UVB rays. 

</UL>

<p>

By involving students in the design process for an Outdoor Classroom we are

giving them the 

message that their opinions are important. We are also giving students the hidden

message 

that the school staff, and their parents value the spaces that they play in,

thereby indicating 

that we care about them and their needs. 

The school community and the school environment club plan to adopt stewardship of

the 

outdoor classroom.

<h4>School Ground Management Responsibilities</h4><p>

New schools are given a budget from the Ministry of Education that mandates the  

landscaping of new school grounds. Existing school grounds, however are managed 

locally by elected school boards. It is the decision of individual boards to

provide funds 

for landscaping. (Unfortunately, in these times of financial restraint it is

usually ground 

maintenance landscaping costs that are first cut from School Board budgets). 

Some school communities raise funds to landscape their school grounds through

local 

businesses and non-profit associations. In these cases, it is usually the school 

community's responsible to maintain the area. <p> <br>

 

<h4>What is the Ministry of Education's Position?<p></h4>

The  Ministry of Education has recognized the need for landscaping exisiting

school 

grounds. An excerpt from the 'School Facilities Branch Update'.  December, 1994 

titled 

The Greening of School Grounds states: <p>



"it is recommended that school boards and district officials 

consider the value of having a certain percentage of school 

grounds as a shade and naturalized area. Incorporation of 

shade and naturalized areas into general landscape plans for 

individual schools would be determined by school boards, in 

consultation with facility managers and the school community, 

including school administrators, teachers, students, parents and 

other interested community groups. Consideration would be 

given to issues around location, safety, grounds maintenance, 

and financing. The Ministry has awarded a statutory grant to a 

non-profit group, the Evergreen Foundation, that will provide 

information to school districts and parent advisory councils on 

the greening of school grounds." <p>



The Minister, Honourable Art Charbonneau has also encouraged EEPSA  to work

closely 

with locally elected boards of school trustees and parent advisory boards around 

incorporating naturalized and shade areas into school site plans. In particular,

he stressed 

that health, safety and aesthetic issues be discussed. It is understood that

detailed overall 

planning may not be necessary for all school sites, as some schools already have

natural 

areas and shaded areas.<p>

<br>

<h4>What is the Ministry of Environment's Position?</h4> <p>

Minster Moe Sihota, October 25, 1995 stated "I recognize the economic and 

environmental benefits of naturalized areas on school grounds... I hope that the 

information in the naturescape British Columbia kits and the planned Canadian

wildlife 

Federation publication in schoolyard habitat for Canada's wildlife will further

encourage 

teachers, parents and adminstrators to undertake projects that support the

initiative.<p> <br>







<h4>What is the Ministry of Health's Position?</h4><p>

The Ministry of Health supports those aspects of greening school grounds "which

will 

result in the provision of trees that produce shade. For example, trees should be

located 

in areas such as schools and playing fields where they will provide needed UV

protection 

while at the same time not interfering with the outdoor activity." <p> <br>



<h4>Legal Implications</h4><p>

Where a pupil is injured while participating in school activities, either inside

or outside 

of the school, the pupil has no claim for damages against the school board nor

the teacher 

unless negligence on the part of the school board or teacher is proven to have

resulted in 

the injury. The best protection against liability is careful planning, the

acceptance and use 

of proven procedures and standards, and the presence of qualified leaders.

Negligence, 

resulting from poor supervision, can be charged when the three following

conditions 

exist each is dependent on the others:



<OL>

	<LI> Failure on the part of a teacher employed by the school board to conform to a 

	standard of care for the protection of others against unreasonable risks. The 

	standard of care which in a court of law would likely use as a criterion in 

	negligence suits is that which would be exercised by a careful parent.



	<LI> A reasonably close connection between the conduct of the person in charge and 

	the resulting injury.



	<LI> Actual loss of damage to the injured person(s).

</OL>

<p> <br>

Approval by school boards for school community projects is essential.

Every School Board has a different insurance policy. In the event of a community 

planting/construction day, ensure that your district school board has extended 

insurance coverage for community volunteers, on the school grounds, on that day.

<p>

<h4>School District Support :</h4> <p>

School community projects can sometimes get technical direction from School

District 

Landscaping Guidelines (guidelines may not yet be developed in all districts). A 

landscape architect, who has experience designing educational play environments,

may 

also be available to consult with school community groups. There might be a

locally 

developed overall landscape plan, divided into manageable steps, for each school

site in 

the district. 

<p>

Before starting a project, check the services that are available through your

school 

board.  

<p>

Check your local District School Board to ensure that they support the concept of



community school ground naturalization projects and that an extended insurance 

coverage for community volunteers  is available .

<p> <br> <br>



<h3><a name = appendixb>Appendix B</h3>



<h4>Suggested Planning Steps: </h4>

(Each school community and School District will have a unique approach to

naturalizing their school grounds.) 

<p><br>

<h4>Background Research:</h4>

<UL>

	<LI> Informally survey the school community for support of a shade and/or 

naturalization project. Talk to the school administrator, teachers, parents, 

	and students.  



	<LI> Educate yourself about School Ground Maintenance, Safety, and 

	>Landscaping issues by looking at the Greening your School Ground - A 

	Working Manual, and by phoning the Evergreen Foundation and talking to 

	the School Ground Naturalization coordinator. She will be able to send 

you Evergreen's publication : 'A Guide to School Ground Naturalization'       

	Ph: 604.689 0766. 



	<LI> Get yourself a hole punch, and a key tabbed binder. Managing a 

	naturalization project is a complex task. It will make it easier, over time, if 

	you have all information kept in one place. Keep all copies in your Green 

	a School Ground 'Working Manual' binder. 



	<LI> Write a brief outline giving the reasons for the project: clarify your 

	goals, give the benefits, state the intended decision making process, 

	indicate funding possiblities and suggest an implementation process 

	(draft).



	<LI> Ask the administrator to obtain a school site plan from Ground 

	Maintenance. It should indicate the sanitary lines, waterlines, gas lines, 

	drainage tiles or pipes, water catch basins, electical lines meter, fire lanes, 

	and future building expansion plans.  The site plan is an invaluable tool 

	for the planning team as it will allow unsuitable locations to be quickly 

	identified. The site plan should be kept fairly confidential. 



	<LI> Ask your school adminstrator to informally talk to Ground Maintenance 

	- seek locational and technical advice.



	<LI>Start making funding enquiries.  What organizations have a history of 

	funding schools? What is the criteria for funding? Find out application 

	deadlines. Clarify the payment timeline. Request application forms. </UL>



	<p>Community Consensus:<br>

	<UL><LI> Make a short presentation to the PAC and staff. Obtain support, in 

	principle, for the project. It is critical to have the full support of the 

	administrator.



	<LI> Identify and priotize potential project areas. Consider infrastucture 

	current and future, shade potential, safety, native wildlife values, asthetics, 

	short and long term maintenance. By identifying potential project areas it 

	will SIMPLIFY the decision making process and allow the project to be 

	more managable! Your research will help focus others. However it is 

important that be receptive to alternative suggestions by others. 



	<LI> Form a planning committee, ideally consisting of parents, school staff 

and students. The effort to Green your schoolyard is by consensus, which 

	means that everyone is invited to give input. Everyone's ideas are given 

	consideration by the sub-committee. Ideally, most of the committee  

	should be able to ' live with'  the decisions being made by the group. In 

	order to facilitate the process some members may have to backdown from 

	their position.



	<LI> Make a few general enquiries about possible local community 

	donations (monetary, materials or time donations). If a project is being 

	organized by PAC it may be possible to use a parents' business licence to 

	purchase from wholesale nursery outlets. Start making material cost 

	enquires on estimated amounts. Consider delivery and tax costs. Place 

	copies of your estimates in the Working Manual binder. 



	<LI> Keep the administrator and the community informed at all times! The 

	adminstrator needs to have copies of all communication. Communicate 

	with the school community through posters and short articles in the school 

	newsletters. Place copies of your notices in this binder.



	<LI> Request landscaping design suggestions from the students and others 

	in the community. There needs to be an open invitation for participants to 

	sit on the planning committee. To foster community stewardship of the 

	area it is important that the community is involved in the descision 

	making processes. If the person or persons that initiated the project move 

	to another school, then the stewardship of the area will continue if the 

	school community feels that they have ownership of the landscape. 

	Consensus takes time, but the rewards are worth the effort!



	<LI> Consult with a Landscape Architect to achieve a more professional 

	result. The landscape architect will be able to ensure that all technical 

	considerations have been taken into account. He/she may be able to offer 

	design or plant species choice modifications. Choose a landscape architect 

	who is willing to give meaningful consideration to the input from the 

	school community, and who has the communication skills to participate in 

	a group desicion making process. The process (fostering community 

	stewardship) is just as important as the finished product!



	<LI> Create a draft plan. Try and keep the scale of the drawing reasonably 

	accurate. A scale of 1:200 (1cm = 2m) works quite well. Consider the 

	appropriate placing of plants depending on: infrastructural considerations, 

soil conditions, sun exposure, mature tree canopy width, wildlife values 

	and safety factors. Distribute the plan and respond to feedback. 

</UL>



	<p><br><h4>Permission:</h4>

	<LI> Once the ground maintenance dept has a sketch, they will come out 

	and view the site with the administrator, and other interested parties. 

	Permission with then be given to proceed, or alternative plans suggested. 

	Confirm the parameters of the permission given, in writing, so that there 

	are no misunderstanding by either the school community or the ground 

	maintenance department. 



	<LI> Talk to the funding agency coordinator to ensure that you have 

	followed the required process and to learn of any changed funding criteria. 

	Send funding applications. Enclose a letter of support from the 

	administrator outlining community and ground maintenance support. 

	Submit a short outline of: the cost, the goals, the rational for the location, 

	the social and environmental benefits to the community, the process 

	followed for community decision making, and the process that you intend 

	to follow for task implementation (ie: community planting day). 



	<LI> Confirm funding grants and/or material donations. Make design 

	adjustments if necessary. </UL>

<p> <br>

	<h4>The Big Day:</h4>

	<UL><LI> Plan the community planting/building day: order materials, arrange for 

	material delivery and payment, request volunteers, access any tools that 

	are needed, consider safety factors, list tasks, train task leaders, and 

	estimate the timeline. Sometimes the school maintenance dept will offer 

	to come loosen the soil, especially in areas where the soil is compacted. 

	Invite the students that have graduated from the school to come back and 

	assist with the community planting day.  It'll be great to see them again 

	and it may help in fostering community stewardship.





	<LI> Contact the media so that others may be inspired to follow your 

	example and to indicate to the students that the action is valued by the 

	community.  Record the event with before and after photographs.



	<LI> Hold the community planting day. Have a few leaders come early to 

	position plants and materials. The plant positions can be marked with 

	either the actual plant pot, or by using labelled popcicle sticks. It is most 

	useful to have the  plant species name attached and written on surveyors 

	tape. Provide refreshments (everyone brings their own cup).



	<LI> SUPERVISE !

		<UL><LI> Have one person greeting and organizing volunteers. All tools 

		<LI>need to be labelled.

		<LI> A second person needs to closely supervise plant locations, etc.

		<LI> A third person needs to be solely responsible for monitoring 

		safety. All tools that are not being used should be placed in one 

		location. </UL>

</UL>



	<p><BR><h4>Finishing Up:</h4>

	<LI>  Thank the participants and the funding agencies. Give a list of all 

	participants and community/business donors to the Administrator so that 

	the school can publicly thank them.  Write an article on the project and 

	distribute it.



	<LI> Complete the finances. Keep all records.

A PROFESSIONAL LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT:<br> Your Local School 

Maintenance Department may  be able to provide your project with Landscape 

Architect advice.  In consideration of the large amount of money that you may be 

spending on a naturalization project it is prudent to consult with a professional



landscape architect. A landscape architect  will be able to ensure that your 

drainage considerations, safety precautions, species selection and educational 

play ideas will serve the purposes that you intend them to. Artistic viewpoints, 

knowledge, decision making styles, and consultation fees vary dramatically 

amongst landscape architects. If you do your homework  ahead of time, a one 

time site consultation visit might cost as little as $250.00. A full landscape 

architect drawing could cost thousands of dollars.

species. Likes full sun. 

Needs lots of space. The biggest of Canada's native maples, with the largest leaf

size (18cm wide).  Fast growing to 

30m tall and 20m wide. Doesn't tolerate hard packed soils, needs aeration. Big

leading branches can break away 

during windstorms if not cared for by a professional. Appropriate for a

naturalization area. Not suitable for small 

gardens or as a stand alone tree. Bark retains moisture and hosts mosses, ferns

and liverworts. Symbolic of Canada. 

Natural Range: Alaska to California. Found in abundance in B.C. Good wildlife

values. R&C 4m @ $45.00

or shrub. 14m tall (can grow 10m with a 10m spread in 55 years). Grows in the

edge of a forest, rocky areas and in 

floodplains. Requires well drained acidic soil. Ideal for a naturalization area.

Winged seeds  have a high germination 

rate. Yellow/orange/red leaf is not quite as attractive as the Vine Maple's, but

the tree is hardier. The wood was used 

by 1st Nation's people for snowshoes, paddles, rattles, etc. They used the bark

as an antidote to poison.  Natural 

range: West Coast of North America. Good wildlife values, ie: hummingbirds. 

R&C 2m @ $30.00

<p>

*Vine Maple ( Acer circinatum):<br> A beautiful, small, slow growing, gnarled shape

tree growing tree to 10m. 

Needs shade and moisture. Does well at the protected edge of a forest or in a

forest understory, rather than planted 

by itself.  Light green leaves (5cm) turn a maginificent red in the Fall. Likes

well drained acidic soils. For effect, plant 

in groupings with 40cm spacing. The 1st nation's people used the wood for carving

spoons and bowls. Range is

Lorquin's Admiral Butterfly is attracted to 

willows. Can withstand drought. Range: Coastal Washington and B.C. Can be

purchased at R&C #1 pot@$3.25



<p>

*Western Flowering Dogwood or Pacific Dogwood(Cornus nuttallii):<br> Emblem flower of

British 

Columbia. Can grow to about 15m (usually smaller). Likes filtered sunlight. Needs

fertile, slightly acidic, well drained 

soil. Intolerant of excessive watering and fertilizing. Does not survive well in

hard packed, alkaline soils. Can be 

difficult to get started. Thin bark. Grows best when shaded by other trees. Would

look spectacular planted as an 

undercover of coniferous trees, on the Eastern edge of a naturalization area.

Colourful leaves in Fall. Excellent 

wildlife values. Range B.C. to California. R&C 1.75 m @ $27.50 (get a larger tree

if you can find one).

<p>

Likes sun, but tolerant 

of shade. The largest of the birches, it can grow  25m x 15m. Grows in a range of

soil types from well drained to wet.  

Looks effective when grown as a cluster or in a row. Consider the combination of

a group of birches, a cedar and a 

salal groundcover, in a naturalization area. The gum was used historically as

chewing gum. The 1st nations people 

peeled off strips of bark and used it to make canoes and containers for water.

The growing range is from B.C. to 

Washington. Good wildlife values.  R&C. 3m tall @ $26.00

<p>

attractive weeping 

branches. 15m tall and 8m wide. Interesting bark. Relatively short lived. Good

Fall colour. Looks wonderful in a 

groove between playing areas. A great place to put a bench and create an outdoor

reading area. Combines well with a 

low growing juniper groundcover.  Good wildlife values. Found in the wild in B.C.

Origin: Europe. Jones Nursery 4m  

$75.00

<p>

*Black Cottonwood (Populas trichocarpa): <br> An enormous tree with an astounding

rate of growth. 30m 

tall by 15m wide. Leaves 18 -22 cm long. Used to restore degraded wet areas.

Large root system. Nitrogen fixing. 

Likes deep moist soils. Invasive, will put out suckers. Consider planting well

away from school building. Plant in a 

naturalization or succession area. Will create shade very quickly for other 'sun

sensitive' native plants. Sexes are on 

separate trees. Plant male only. Female releases masses of white cottonwood fluff

(allergies). Range: Alaska to 

California. Good wildlife values. (?Availablity)

<p>

***Western Trembling Aspen (Populas tremuloides): <br>Zones 1-7.  Elegant tree. 

Likes sun. Grows 

rapidly to 20m tall and 12m wide. Dainty, light green leaves that turn a golden

yellow in the Fall. A good shade tree 

for a large space. Thin trunk with attractive white bark. Prefers moist soils and

open areas.  Extensive root system. 

Place well away from sewers and drainage areas. Known as "woman's tongue" or

"noisy leaf" because of the constant 

rustling of the leaves. It is sometimes used as a roadside plant. An ideal

foreground tree for native shrubs and 

wildflowers. Looks good in groupings. To increase early spring shade, consider

<Center><H3>GRANT APPLICATION 1996</H3></Center>
	<Center><H3> School Ground Naturalization</H3></Center>
<Center><H4>Deadline: April 10,1996 </H4></Center>
 
The total grant amount available per school in a given year is $500.00 (including taxes)
<P>The grant is only available to purchase trees and plant material that are native
to your region.  You must research which species would be appropriate for your
site and find nurseries which are able to supply them .  We promote the use of
native plants to help bring back our native wildlife and establish healthy
ecosystems.  Among the many plant species introduced to Canada, some have
displayed unexpected aggressive growth tendencies that cause problems to our
natural ecosystems.

<P>Native Trees of Canada, by R. C. Hosie is an excellent resource that depicts
the native trees and their geographic ranges and also lists non-native species.
The Peterson Guides on trees and shrubs for your region may also be helpful.
(Note: the Peterson Guides list natives and non-natives.  By reading the text
carefully you can determine where the plants originated and can avoid those
described as "alien" or "introduced".

 <font size="+1">September  1995</font size="+1"></center>


<P>
The Vancouver office has recently added Tammy Keetch and Chloe Hartley to our team.
With the recent strong financial support of Environment Canada, VanCity's Enviro Fund, 
Vancouver Foundation and the BC Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks, Tammy and Chloe will
be helping Kevin & Martha to implement these projects for 1995 /6.<P>

<UL>
	<LI> Tammy Keetch is the new BC Coordinator for the local, hands-on 
	SCHOOL GROUND NATURALIZATION PROJECT FOR THE
	LOWER MAINLAND. This project will build on the strength of the national program to
	make Lower Mainland schools healthier learning environments by creating 
	natural areas as part of their playgrounds.
	It will focus on small workshops and presentations for 
teachers, parents, students and school board trustees, but also include planning,
ecology and fundraising resources specific to the Lower Mainland. Please call
<A HREF="address.html">Tammy </A>for more information about how this program can help you and your school. Special
Thanks to VanCity for their recent EnviroFund support.
<LI> With an Equinox Experience September 23, Evergreen will be launching an
ECOLOGICAL STEWARDSHIP PROJECT for EVERETT CROWLEY PARK in 
south east Vancouver. This 100 acre "undiscovered gem" in Vancouver's park system
was once the Kerr St. municipal dump. Since closing, this area has been left to fend
for itself from the onslaught of invaders such as Himalayan Blackberry, Japanese Knotweed, 
Scotch Broom and even goldfish (in one of the otherwise healthiest ponds in the 
Lower Mainland). The few native trees and shrubs have a shaky future, as do the many 
birds, insects, fish and mammals which depend on them for their habitat. Evergreen will
coordinate an ecological assessment of the park (including such partners as nearby 
Langara College's Environemnt Program), and get the extended community involved in 
the long term care of the park (facilitated by establishing a community-based Environment
Committee). Many thanks to Environment Canada and the BC Ministry of Environment, Lands & Parks for their support.
Please call <A HREF="address.html">Martha </A>for more information about how this program
<LI> and last but not least, Evergreen's vancouver office will be working to make this WEB SITE an excellent community-based 
ecology resource, including techical ecology information, school and community project case studies and your stories about favourite natural areas!

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>ECOLE BILINGUE (Vancouver, BC):<BR>

Communication / Community Awareness</H2>

<H3><IMG SRC="littlebutterfly.gif"  ALIGN=left>HERE'S THE
DIRT!</H3>
<br clear>
<P>This is a report of L'Ecole Bilingue's first Greening Our School
Yard meeting (May 16th, 1995)</P>

<P>"I can't think of a better way to encourage community at a school
than by gardening together. Certainly not if the enthusiasm from
about 20 students, teachers and parents attending the brainstorming
evening is anything to go by.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="littledragonfly.gif"  ALIGN=right>I don't think
any of us knew quite what to expect of this evening but the mood was
set by a splendid array of floweras from the garden of Constance
Barnes and an invitation by several students to view their composting
bins and get our hands in the dirt right away, so to speack.</P>

<P>Barb Quinn began the meeting by orienting us to the school site
and areas we can look at "greening"and then invited us to share some
of our past gardening memories and future visions for our garden
here. It was quickily obivious we had some passionate gardeners and
some handymen too! We also learned about other Vancouver Schools
already in the "Greening" process. I made a mental note to look and
see how Queen Mary and Lord Tennyson are progressing.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="littleflower.gif" ALIGN=left>During a lively Brainstorming
session, Laurie Lee wrote down all these ideas on a large "web" and
we quickly saw our garden grow in our imaginations and before our
eyes. Other ideas for places to sit made of all kinds of materials,
climbing evergreens, pizza garden, water, a tree fort, shady areas,
wild flowers, paths, rocks, a vegetable garden and many many moore.
</P>

<P><IMG SRC="littlesmilingsun.gif"  ALIGN=right>All this we saw
as an Outdoor Classroom where students could learn among other things
to be keepers of the garden, botany studies, natural pest control,
preparing produce, pressing flowers, bird studies - in fact science,
math, history, art, nutrition, environmental concerns, creative
writing - or just the pure pleasure of sitting in the shade with a
book.</P>

<P>Then we had to ask ourselves some practical questions. Like, How
do we begin? We all agreed that these are long term goals and
planning, preparation, design, costing and funding have to come
first. We were encouraged by the wisdom of 2 Representatives from the
Evergreen Foundation who advised us to start slowly and to get
students involved at the beginning. Their original ideas will give
the project its identity and promote ownership and traditions. They
also suggested we keep people well informed, perhaps through a Nature
Club of Newsletter.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="pollinator.gif" ALIGN=left>In the meantime, ideas will be
gleaned from the teachers and students as well as families before the
next step of drawing up plans and proposal. As Laurie Lee said, "This
was an evening of 'sowing the seeds'. We hope, with combined efforts,
to watch our garden grow.</P>

<P>So, if you meant to come to the first meeting and didn't make it,
watch for the next meeting- hopefully before school ends in June.
Come and be part of the L'Ecole Bilingue Greening Project and have
fun. We did."</P>

<P>Thanks to Carolyn Main for writing up this report.</P>

<P>Stay tuned folks, there's more news comin'. May 22nd, 1995</P>

<h2>A Celebration of the Opportunities:</h2>
<h3> School Ground Naturalization</h3></center>
<P>
 

   Throughout Canada, schools and their grounds represent thousands of 
opportunities for experience-based learning, community building, and 
environmental rehabilitation. How can you take advantage of these unique 
possibilities? By turning some of your school's asphalt and mown lawn into a 
living, growing outdoor classroom!
<p>

<IMG SRC="nssasegremont1small.gif" align=left hspace=10 border=0>
   The naturalization of school grounds in Canada is a relatively recent 
phenomenon, but the movement has deep roots and a long history throughout 
the world. In 1991 The Evergreen Foundation initiated a program called School 
Ground Naturalization (SGN) with the mandate to support  projects across the 
country, and to provide schools with the information they need to naturalize 
their grounds and connect these  efforts with the curriculum. Along with our 
Guide to School Ground Naturalization:Welcoming Back the Wilderness, we 
feel that a newsletter is necessary-something that will serve as a resource, a 
networking tool, and a forum for the sharing of information.

<br clear>
<p>
   Welcome to the first issue of The Outdoor Classroom.  Inside you will find 
stories from schools across the country. Since the idea of naturalizing school 
grounds is still new to Canada, sharing information about successful projects is
one of the best ways to learn what works and what doesn't. You will also find 
the1995 SGN grant application form inside.  The objective of the grant is to 
offer financial support to schools initiating naturalization projects.
<p>
    We hope that this newsletter will provide you with the support and 
encouragement you need to start a project. Please let us know of your 
experiences. Through the combined efforts of individual schools, the sharing of 
successes and problems, and the feedback from those people directly involved, 
we will be able to spread the word about a method of learning that finds its 
guidance in the nature right outside our schools' doors!
<p>
THE EVERGREEN FOUNDATION, Autumn 1994

<h2>Why we need nature on our school grounds<h2>


The importance of creating natural outdoor classrooms on school grounds has become a local, national, and international issue for the simple fact that it makes sense. The benefits, among others, include: an opportunity for experience-based learning; an environmentally improved landscape; a less hostile play area; and the best possible model for environmental rehabilitation and community building. 
<p>
<UL>
	<LI>The advantage of using school grounds for environmental teaching is that they provide first-hand experience of the natural world. The issues faced in developing a school ground project can be seen as a microcosm of the environmental problems that face us on a global level. 

	<p><LI>Natural school grounds are less hostile environments than the typical fenced and surfaced grounds.  

	<p><LI>Natural school grounds are environmentally more responsible. The use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers is dangerous to the environment, and more specifically to young children.  Natural school landscapes can use composting and organic maintenance methods as an alternative. 

	<p><LI>Creating a sense of community and enabling the community to take stewardship of the site are of central importance to every project.

<h2>International Programs<h2>


Many international groups are addressing the issue of school ground naturalization. Providing children with a natural school environment is being recognized as a global priority, reinforcing further the need for Canada to do the same. The following is just a sampling of international projects.

<b>Learning Through Landscapes, Great Britain: </b>
   This British program aims to encourage  the educational use of school landscapes. Their primary goal is to raise the profile of cross-curricular environmental education in schools through permanent outdoor classrooms. Contact: Director Bill Lucus, 3rd Floor, Southside Offices, Winchester SO23 9DL Tel:(0962) 846258
<p>
<b> Project Beautification Initiative, USA: </b>
   In partnership with the Chicago Public Schools, the Chicago Community Trust has funded projects at 27 schools. One particularly innovative project was initiated at Beethoven School in a tough neighbourhood: 825 children planted and tended a geography garden in the shape of the 7 continents and 4 oceans. The garden was used to support geography studies. Contact: Mari Christopherson, Project Director, The Chicago Community Trust, 222 North LaSalle, suite 1400, Chicago, IL 60601-1009 Tel: (312) 372-3356
<p>
<b>Skolans Uterum, Sweden: </b>
A government-funded organization committed to bringing green spaces back to school grounds, the program includes 12 pilot schools, 900 members, and the publication of a newsletter. In May 1995 they will host an international conference on school ground naturalization. Contact: Gareth Lewis c/o Barnmilijrdet Box 221 06, 104 22 Stockholm 
Tel: 08-650-94-91
<p>
<b>La Fondation Yves Rocher, France: </b>
Through international projects the Yves Rocher Foundation is working towards both the conservation of the earth's plant heritage and educating children about the environment.  The initiative "One school, one arboretum" supports children planting native trees on their school grounds.  Supported by the Ministries for Education and Agriculture, and destined to be integrated into school curricula, children are learning the importance of the natural environment.

<h2>Tips: Getting started; writing a community letter;<h2>


<b>Getting Started</b>

<UL>
	<LI>Be sure to take before and after photographs of your naturalization site for your records.  These are invaluable in your project newsletter to the community.

	<p><LI>The best resources you can find are local naturalists, landscape architects and hobby gardeners who want to lend a green thumb. They are full of ecological and horticultural knowledge, and are often willing to volunteer their time for a worthwhile community project. 

	<p><LI>Your school custodians will be your best friends in this project, so get them involved right from the beginning.

	<p><LI>Stress the curriculum benefits of naturalization with teachers; spread the word about the potential of learning through natural landscapes.
</UL>

<p><br>

<b>writing a community letter</b>
<p>
After you've done the initial groundwork for your school ground naturalization with staff and principal, it's time to communicate with the community to let people know that this is a planned project and your school cares about the face it presents to the neighbourhood. This letter(below) was sent by the principal of Runnymede Public School in Toronto to the school's neighbours:

<p>

<UL>
   <LI>"To the Neighbours of Runnymede Public School:
<p>
Runnymede Public School is embarking on the first phase of a project to create a nature study area on the hillside along the east side of the school property. This will enable children to participate in outdoor education activities in a safe, convenient location. They will be able to monitor changes over the seasons and from year to year.
<p>
The plants for Phase One have been selected to provide food and shelter for birds. These plants are generally native to our region, and so will require very little maintenance once they become established. Regular cleaning of the hillside will continue as usual.
<p>
The students, staff and parents of Runnymede Public School. are contributing a great deal of volunteer work to make this project a reality. Funding has been obtained from the Shell Environmental Fund and the Ontario government's Community Wildlife Involvement Program. Planting will take place on Saturday, April 20th and during the following week.
<p>
We hope you will enjoy the beauty of the new nature area, which will include flowering mountain ash trees in the spring and the red leaves of sumachs in the fall. We would also appreciate it if you could keep an eye on the nature area and report any suspicious activities promptly to the police.
<p>
Thank you."

<b>BRINGING BACK THE B.C. FOREST</b>

   by Janice E. Brown, Langley, British Columbia
<p>Alex Hope Elementary School is situated in a new subdivision in Langley, British Columbia. When construction of the school began in an area known as Forest Hills, much of the area was indeed forest, home to many species of native trees, birds and small animals. As the subdivision grew, houses replaced the forest.
 <p>  Three years ago, our staff decided to make environmental awareness one of our school goals. In the intervening years,  in order to foster an awareness that responsibility for the care of our environment belongs to each of us, we have undertaken numerous classroom and school projects  We particularly like to encourage projects in which students take an active role and see the results of their efforts.
<p>   One of the most exciting projects has involved tree planting. Our school backs on the Trans Canada Highway, and we are gradually replacing the green belt between our school and the freeway. Our first modest planting, which took place on Earth Day 1991, saw each class planting a small cedar tree. The following year, with a grant from the Evergreen Foundation, and a lot of help from our school district, the planting was extended to cover 300 feet of fence. This year, our students planted a further 30 trees, some native red cedars, the rest a variety of native maple trees, in front of the original cedars. We hope to continue the planting next year with the addition of native shrubs in front of the deciduous trees.
<p>   Already the freeway traffic is less visible from the school grounds, and we hope that as the trees grow, our students will be further insulated from noise and pollution.

<b>*Learning to Make Room for Trees <b><br>
by Nancy C. Coulter<p>

   As the population of Lower Mainland continues to grow, an increasing number of community-based initiatives are developing to ensure that natural habitats are retained.
 <p>  "There has been a huge concern about trees in this area," says Karen Christianson, a landscape technician with the West Vancouver Municipality, where Caulfield Middle School is being built. "The residents would like the school to keep the green character of the neighbourhood and for trees to screen the school from view."
 <p>    Unfortunately, bulldozers have cleared the once tree-filled site, and local residents are concerned that no attempts have been made to integrate the school with nature.
  <p>   Ms. Christianson has proposed that students be involved in the replanting process to help return the school to its naturalized landscape. As yet no definite plans have been set, but Ms. Christianson hopes to see trees planted in time for the school's opening in 1995.

<b> DIRT AND DIGGING EQUALS LEARNING: <p>
School Ground Naturalization in the Chinook Region</b>


   by Tamara Gordon,  Calgary, Alberta

 <p>   As a new teacher to Springbank Middle School near Calgary, I was immediately struck by the mesmerizing view of the mountains on the horizon and the sheath of golden prairie that wrapped its blanket of wild grass around the school. I thought that surely nothing could be better than this. But after a few months of outdoor supervision, I soon realized that there was a price to pay for our eye-pleasing view: windblown hair caked with dirt and dust was the tattoo of each adventurer.
 <p>   It was during our grade 5 science unit on plant and animal adaptations that our principal informed us of grants available for school ground naturalization. We eagerly jumped at the opportunity. After receiving the grant, Steve Repic, our grounds co-ordinator, brought several plans to our team and discussed our planting options. In spite of the harsh conditions, he assured us that there were several hardy plants that would beautify and enhance our school yard.
 <p>   We selected five students from each class to assist in the planting. Within a week, each class had "adopted" a plant, done some research on the plant, and begun to care for it until we were ready to transport it to the great outdoors.
 <p>   In addition to our regular science program, we also invited Mr. Repic to address all grade 5 students and discuss the effects that the environmental conditions at our school have on our plants, how to select plants that suit our habitat, and how to plant and maintain our trees and shrubs.
 <p>   Where unbroken, flat land once was, small plants are now struggling to survive. Not only have we increased the aesthetic value of our surroundings, but we have also helped create a group of fiercely devoted student environmentalists who have pledged themselves to the care and protection of a group of courageous plants.

<h2>Yes, In My Back Yard!</h2>




by Elizabeth Caron-Boucher, Montreal, Quebec

 <p>   Although changing habits and instilling new values is not easy, one way to raise children's awareness of the natural environment is through planting projects right in their own back yards--in their schools.
<p>   Some people think that natural spaces on school grounds will reduce playing space and that they can be unclean, even dangerous. However, with a well-orchestrated funding plan, including the help of regional sponsors, the play area can be modified rather than reduced, and dirt will not be a problem if you choose your planting time wisely.  Experience has shown, in fact, that vandalism is almost entirely eliminated when children become involved with the stewardship of their own spaces through naturalization projects.

<p><br>
<h2> Planting for Wildlife </h2>

   Rachel Carson called it a "sense of wonder"-how better to describe the enthusiasm and excitement that children bring to their encounters with living creatures?
   If you plan to focus your project around wildlife, keep the following points in mind:

<UL>
	<LI>   the more diverse the vegetation, in general, the more diverse the wildlife, so plant a variety of species;

	<LI>   native plants have evolved over thousands of years in association with native animals, so give preference to locally adapted native species;

	<LI>  by encouraging wildlife to your naturalization project, you have a responsibility to learn about their natural requirements and to not harm them inadvertently.
</UL>

<b>INVOLVING LOCAL EXPERTS: Ecological Restoration at Millgrove P.S.</b>
   by Marietta Stonehouse-Kish, Millgrove, Ontario

<p>   After planting trees with the "Bring Back the Don" project in Toronto and experiencing the feeling of participating in the restoration not only of the environment but of the community and its people, I decided that our students in Millgrove should have the opportunity to participate in this type of project. I was not knowledgable about native species or landscaping but once my decision was made, many experts came forward to help.
<p>   One expert who visited and shared her knowledge with the grades 4 and 5 classes was Lynne Hanna-Folkes from the Hamilton Naturalist Society. She showed slides and gave a talk comparing lawns to forest restoration projects. The students were quite interested, since the schoolgrounds had initially been lawn and were now well on the way to becoming forest, and asked many good questions.
<p>   Another visitor was Larry Travers, who has studied the Carolinian forest in which the school is situated. He appeared one day with a cedar bench and a stump for sitting on, which have now become favourite spots for enjoying the garden.
<p>   Albert Butwick, who is retired from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and knows a lot about trees, volunteered to make signs so we could identify the species in our school yard.
<p>   Little did we know when we started this school ground naturalization on Earth Day 1993 that just one year later we would have such a beautiful place as this garden.

<b>AN ISLAND GARDEN:  Sherwood Elementary School </a>

   by Ruth Smith, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island

<p>   Encouraged by the success of the garden classroom on the southern exposure of Sherwood Elementary School, P.E.I., the garden committee has planned to turn the shady area on the northern side of the school into a natural shade garden. This area tends to be cool and receives little light, lending itself more to woodland plants such as spreading evergreens, ferns, rhododendrons and mosses.
<p>   The garden classroom has offered the 600 students at Sherwood many opportunities to observe and appreciate the beauty of our environment. Each student plants an annual in the garden in the spring as part of our continued commitment to nature. Community volunteers maintain the garden over the summer.
<p>   Young students are the future leaders and tomorrow's caretakers of our earth. What better place to learn guardianship and develop a love of nature than in our school environment!

<b>THE SWALE STORY </b><br>
 
   by Kathy Kowpak, Etobicoke, Ontario

  <p> A presentation concerning the loss of habitat and decline in the amphibian population by Bob Johnson from the Metro Toronto Zoo inspired Richard Dvernachuk, a grade 5 teacher at Broadacres school in Etobicoke, Ontario, to investigate the possibility of restoring a swale, or low marshy ground that bordered the school property. After discussion with the City Parks Department, the school was given permission to plant. Our main priority was to use native plants to encourage wildlife. Biodiversity was important to us, and we decided that no chemicals would be used.
  <p> The transformation of the swale from ditch to wildlife habitat began in May when students, staff and community volunteers began digging 300 holes for planting.
  <p> The 2,305 plants purchased from Humber Nurseries and Otter Valley Native Plants arrived on May 24 and the planting began. Wildflowers, grasses, reeds and rushes were planted in the wet part of the swale, and various native plants and grasses were planted in drier areas. Gail Rhynard, the owner of Otter Valley Native Plants, was a valuable advisor. She was able to supply us with plugs, which are less expensive than larger plants, and therefore we were able to purchase more restoration materials.
  <p> With the planting complete, the plants are left alone to survive in "the wild" or perish. They are already providing a home for wildlife. Various birds have been seen--killdeer, red-winged blackbirds, robins, ducks--and dragonflies were seen laying eggs in the pools.
  <p> The children are now being "nurtured by nature" and have "nature to nurture"--to learn from, to care for, to enjoy.

<h2>The Outdoor Classroom and Cultural Identity,</h2>




 by Ann Coffey, <br>Green School Project,<br> Ottawa, Ontario

 <p>  The "tractor tire" garden at Charles H. Hulse Elementary School in Ottawa is ablaze with colourful annuals and perennials donated by Loblaws and a local nursery. The tomatoes are ripening, the squash is out of control, the broccoli is sprouting, the outer leaves of lush lettuces are being picked daily, and the rose hips are almost ready for jelly-making. In the herb garden, the lemon thyme is threatening to engulf the sage and chives. A bed prepared for autumn planting has disappeared under a thicket of weeds that, interestingly, have been selectively gathered by local residents, presumably for salad greens.
 <p>  This garden was specifically designed to pique the interest of the school's multi-cultural population, many of whom are expert gardeners. The children, who speak a total of 46 languages, enthusiastically engaged in planting projects, and several contributed plants or seeds brought from home. They also assembled the eight outdoor composters used to compost the garden waste and leaves and grass clippings generated on the school grounds. During the spring term, swarms of children arrived every lunch to inspect their plants, pull out weeds, and rake up grass left by the mowers.
<p>   A variety of native plants will be added soon: perennials will replace annuals; trees and shrubs will provide shade and windbreaks as well as food and shelter for wildlife; and vines such as grape, bittersweet, Virginia creeper and Dutchman's pipe will be used to cover bare fencing and walls.
<p>   There is a wildflower garden in-the-making, planted in May with a variety of sprouting, unidentified plants rescued from the school's hedgerows and playing fields, and now covered with delicate blooms.
<p>   Also, an area of grass left unmown has a growing population of toads, which both fascinate and repulse the children--especially when they learn how many slugs, caterpillars, grubs, mosquitoes, earwigs and other creatures this hungry amphibian can eat in a season!
<p>   The rationale behind starting to naturalize the school yard in this rather roundabout way was to create an understanding of the relationship between human food needs, organic food waste, the land, and the complexity of organisms that keep soil healthy. By experiencing as well as understanding their place in this cycle of life, death, decay and regeneration, the children are now ready to respect other creatures' needs and grow a place for them--and for learning about them--on their school grounds.

<h2>School Ground Naturalization and Sustainability</h2>



by The David Suzuki Foundation,
<br> Vancouver, British Columbia 
 
<p>The David Suzuki Foundation is pleased to be part of the first issue of the Outdoor Classroom.  Returning nature to the school grounds of Canada is a great educational challenge.
<p>   All of the Suzuki Foundation's projects, from West Coast Forestry to Social Change, are based on a single, unifying notion: biodiversity is not negotiable!  The average school yard has some grass, perhaps some plants, and likely a few trees.  But few if any of these are the same local, diverse plants that would have grown in the area before it was developed.  The challenge in "naturalizing" school grounds can include finding out what grew where, what will grow now, and how school grounds can be brought back to their original state of biodiversity.
<p>  We face the same challenge with our forestry and fisheries projects: find out what Mother Nature designed over thousands of generations and help to restore and protect those precious ecosystems. Returning nature to our school yards is an important step towards restoring the life cycles of earth. Good luck!
<p>For more information about the Foundation's projects contact 219-2211 West 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC V6K 4S2  Tel: (604) 732-4228

<h2> THE KARNER BLUE BUTTERFLY </h2>
<h3> by Kim Bilous, World Wildlife Fund - Canada</h3></center>
<P>
 
  

  
  <IMG SRC="karnerbluesmall.gif" align=left hspace=10 border=0>
   Once, bright blue butterflies made their home in Ontario's prairie
grasslands.
Wait a minute! Bright blue butterflies? Prairies in Ontario? <P>

   It's true. A beautiful species of butterfly, the Karner blue, once made its
home 
on the now-rare prairies of southern Ontario, in the area known as Carolinian 
Canada. As farms and subdivisions and roads and other developments replaced 
the rich flowering meadows that fed the butterfly populations, the Karner blue 
couldn't survive. Now, the Karner blue is extirpated (no longer found in some 
places) in Ontario. Fortunately, there are some fairly healthy populations of
this 
butterfly in the northwestern U.S. prairie states.
<p>
   Dedicated people are working to help bring the Karner blue back to Canada. 
In Pinery Provincial Park, near Port Franks, Ontario, park naturalists are 
working at careful prairie habitat rehabilitation. This area was one of the last

places Karner blues were sighted. Park staff are re-establishing native prairie 
species like butterfly weed, New Jersey tea, and the Karner blue larvae's only 
food, the wild lupine. They are bringing back the butterfly habitat since they 
recognize that saving endangered spaces means saving endangered species.
<P>
   So while you are considering the beauty and value of your own native plant 
school ground naturalization, think about all the hard working people who are 
dedicated to conserving wildlife and wild places, including some of Ontario's 
rarest butterflies. Please be careful not to plant or release wildlife species
not 
native to your area--but feel good that with your school's native plants, you're

working for species survival, too.
<P>

<H3>Giving Students A Voice for Nature</h3>
<P>
A school ground naturalization project holds extremely rich possibilities
for learning and play as  students learn from hands-on experiences with
natural ecsosytems. Idea that project often starts as getting away from
concrete, standard, conventional school yard (beautification) whatever, to
making greener play area and as the project ":grows" (sorry) participants
start to realize potential of 1)  extent to which students can be involved
in planning and making the changes to their school ground and 2) the
potential for taking the classroom outdoors to provide an experiential
rather than textbook learning environment and possibilities for hooking it
up to curriculum.
Often the project is integrated into the school's formal curriculum only
once it is complete.  However, Evergreen believes that  learning
opportunites exist for the children long before the "outdoor classroom"
comes to life.
<P>
The process of establishing a naturalization project on your school ground
is as much, if not more,  a learning opportunity as is the finished
product.   nd the students should be involved from the beginning.  The
learning process can begin when the idea is proposed by a parent, teacher
or student and continue long after the planting has been completed.  To
me environment they are helping to create.

<H2>Pesticide Concerns Popping Up Like Weeds</H2>

by Fay Katay and Jack Locke.<P>
[Fay Katay is a Calgary artist, author of "Lawns for Kids" and freelance
environment educator.]<BR>
[Jack Locke is a freelance editor and manager of Pancake Theatre Productions
in Calgary, AB]<BR>
<P> 
Like dandelions in springtime, pesticide critics have been popping up all
across Canada.  From Sechelt, British Columbia to Baddeck, Nova Scotia,
citizens are demanding freedom from pesticides in food, in water, in
playgrounds and in residential areas.  As an alternatives to conventional
pesticide literature, they set up booths in malls, deliver fliers
grassroots style -- door-to-door, and plant My Yard is Chemical Free  Power
Flowers and Power Bugs in unsprayed yards.
<P> 
Should people be concerned that urban centers are now using ten times more
chemicals per square acre than is used by farms?  This question begs not
only a local answer, but a global one.  The war being waged against
usure at low levels produces health time bombs.
<P> 
While some professionals are slow to acknowledge the dangers of pesticides,
not all defend the status quo.  For example, Dr. June Irwin of Point
Claire, Dr. Libuse Gilke of Nepean, and Dr. David Swann in Calgary, have
both been writing and speaking publicly to create awareness.
Stuart Hill of McGill's McDonald College is urging urban municipalities and
rural growers alike to see the merit and economical benefits of redesigning
planted areas to include diversity.  An outspoken entomologist, Hill's
simple yet revolutionary approach could eliminate the need for urban lawn
chemicals.  He suggests planting a  variety of appropriate native species
to create natuexisting budgets.  In some cases, the impetus for rethinking
management
techniques has been the slashing of spraying budgets.
<P> 
Our society is becoming less tolerant of risks.  "Safety tests used to test
pesticides are fundamentally inadequate" says Merryl Hammond, a nurse with
a doctorate in community health.  "They only test the acute effects of
single chemicals on healthy adults exposed to single or small doses over
short periods of time."  Children are not used in tests and no studies are
conducted on the chemically sensitive, Hammond observes.  This
anti-pesticide dynamohe use of pesticides for cosmetic use in
residential areas.
<P> 
 Municipal councils across the land are reacting to public pressure to
involve citizens in pesticide decision-making.  The City of Waterloo
citizen's Pesticide Task Force involved at least eighteen representatives
from a broad spectrum of community interests.  The democratic composition
of such committees is crucial, yet sometimes the balance tilts towards the
undemocratic.  "Committees need to be balanced with fair representation
frtry of Health.  The
most recent revision to the pesticide registration regulations occurred in
the late 1970's.  Partly funded by the federal Green Plan, an Alternatives
Branch is being revamped to promote research and education about pesticide
reduction, the redesign of systems, and alternative growing strategies.
<P> 
While the government is proposing and supposing, grassroots publications
are flourishing.  For further reading: Get Your Lawns and Garden Off Drugs
by Carole Rubin; Lawns for Kids, a Grassroots Calgary learning kit; and
Pesticide bylaws: a comprehensive kit for concerned town councillors and
citizens, by Citizens for Alternatives to Pesticides.

	This butterfly garden is an ecosystem created for our winged companions.<BR>
	  It is our legacy, and will grow with us into our futures.</center>



<P> 
<H3>Introduction </H3>

<P>

                                


<IMG SRC="nsbchylandbutterflybox.jpeg" align=left hspace=10 border=0>	The Butterfly Garden at Hyland Elementary was planted on Earth
Day, April 22, 1995, by  parents, students and staff. Approximately 30 
enthusiastic volunteers turned up and in 3 hours accomplished a great deal 
of work. They planted, shoveled dirt, cemented in the log post wall and 
constructed planter boxes for the playground shade trees.  Students in the 
school Environment Club wished for a garden, and the club leader, Ms.Linda 
George, felt they could obtain the optimum benefit from a native plant 
garden. This could provide a place that demonstrated how ecosystems function 
and also give children a concrete opportunity to have a positive effect on 
their environment. <P>
< br clear> <p>
<A HREF="resnsbchyland1b.html"><IMG SRC="nsbchyland95drgsml.gif" align=left hspace=10 border=2></A>The decision 
to focus the garden on butterflies evolved from meeting 
with Mr. Harold Reesor, a local butterfly expert, and from the opportunity 
to raise Painted Lady butterflies in the school. Butterflies, as well as 
other insects, are considered indicator species for our environment similar 
to the historical canary in the coal mines. Butterflies have declined quite 
dramatically in the Lower Mainland, largely due to loss of habitat and such 
things as aerial spraying for the Asian Gypsy moth. A garden planted for 
butterflies is pesticide free and includes nectar flowers for the adult 
butterflies to feed on as well as the larval food plants required by the 
caterpillars. While adult butterflies seem fairly adaptable in finding the
nectar they require from a variety of flowers, the caterpillars tend to be 
very specific in their food requirements. 
<P>
	Not surprisingly, many of the larval plant foods required by our 
native butterflies are those plants that are indigenous to this region.  
In making our plant selections, we  included the larval food plants we were 
able to obtain, while at the same time we needed to meet other criteria such 
as avoiding toxic species and those non native nectar flowers which could 
become invasive. The availability of native nectar flowers is extremely
limited, so other flowers were included to attract the butterflies to our 
garden. A few of the plants we chose were not directly beneficial to 
butterflies at all, such as the native ground covers, but it was necessary 
to include them for the overall health of the garden. They serve to hold the 
soil in place and to reduce the chance of unwanted plants  introducing 
themselves. 
<P>
	It is also worth noting that the garden will benefit other local 
wildlife such as birds, providing either the nectar required by hummingbirds 
or the berries eaten  by others, and even caterpillars themselves as food. 
A number of the native plants also have an interesting history of use by 
indigenous peoples; they were used for such things as basket weaving, food,
tools, and for medicinal treatments. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="nsbchylanddiggers.jpeg" align=left hspace=10 border=0>	It is our hope that the garden will become an outdoor classroom, 
enjoyed by students and staff as place of beauty and used as a place to 
interact with and observe nature in their own "backyard."  We hope that the 
students will feel a sense of empowerment too, in realizing that they can 
make positive contributions to their environment. The garden may need
alterations in the future, but that is the nature of a garden, and the 
possibilities for additions are numerous. One parent suggested a collection 
of large rocks for geological interest, and the element of water would 
greatly enhance both the ecological and educational value. Frogs and 
tadpoles may show up,  butterflies require damp areas to absorb soil 
minerals, and birds always  enjoy a chance for a drink and a bath.
<P>
	Finally, the garden would not have been possible without the
commitment of parents to take on the task of maintenance, particularly those 
who will come to water throughout the summer. This will be essential to the 
garden's survival, and Hyland is fortunate in having enough volunteers to 
have undertaken the project.

<H2>THE POND PROJECT</H2></center>
<P> 
by Jill Grandy,  Grade 3 teacher, 
<br>,  Harry R. Hamilton School <br>
Mid Sackville,
Nova Scotia
<P> 
The discovery of a small, neglected pond on our school property has brought
both the school and the community together to strive for it  restoration .
After much planning, "The Pond Project" officially got under way on Earth
Day, 1995. A general clean-up of the school property and pond area took
place, including the removal of an old wrecked car which had been
contaminating the water.
<P> 
Resistance to the Pond Project has been minimal.  Th fact that a thriving
amphibian pond need only be eighteen inches deep has alleviated any fears
concerning safety.  The project  is a good example of how real life
experiences lend themselves to integration  with the school curriculum.
Students learn first hand the importance of preserving natural
biodiversity.   All the children have been involved in observing,
identifying, surveying, recording, and problem solving, as well as writing
poetry, stories, letters, reports and drawing cartoons.  They  have
constructed bridges and built and sailed boats.  The students' active
involvement in all aspects of the project has developed within them a sense
of commitment to the future of the pond.

<p>by Heather Gosselin,  Adopt-A-Pond Program, Metropolitan Toronto Zoo
<P> 
It is estimated that between 80 and 98% of Canada's urban wetlands have
been destroyed, contributing to the global decline of amphibian
populations.  To help improve these statistics, schools  are encouraged to
undertake a pond "adoption" by visiting or restoring a wetland, building a
pond, or conducting classroom activities associated with wetland and frog
conservation.
<P> 
Some schools are reluctant to construct a pond for safety reasons, but with
proper information, they can ensure a safe environment for their students.
Toads will breed in water as shallow as 46 cm deep and the placement of
submerged boulders in the pond will make the water even shallower. Building
a brim around the deep sides of the pond and planting a dense layer of
shrubs and perennials will discourage people from accessing the pond from
these sides. Rather than limiting the use of ponds to the study of wildlife
habitat, schools are encouraged to use them to teach effective water safety
.  An education and awareness program, focusing on potential dangers in
addition to  responsible action, will benefit our children in addition to
the wildlife.
<P> 
The Metro Toronto Zoo's Adopt-A-Pond programme was created to increase
awareness of the dependence of amphibians on wetland habitats, and to
empower Ontario students and community members to protect local amphibian
populations.  With over 1000 schools already participating in the
programme, we are committed to involving all 5000 Ontario primary and
secondary schools and then linking them through homeowners backyards,
industrial lands, hydro right of ways, and railway lines.
<P> 
In addition to programme material designed for classroom use,  the Metro
Toronto Zoo has recently published a guide with the support of the Ontario
Horticultural Association and the Canadian Wildlife Service, entitled "The
Urban Outback - Wetlands for Wildlife".  This guide focuses  on  the
restoration and creation of wetlands, while considering the local hydrology
and bioregion.
<P>

<h2>Live Action Research</h2><BR>
by P. Francis, Principal, General Byng School  Winnipeg, Manitoba
<P>
Last fall we developed a school project aiming to integrate concepts of
sustainable development and experiential learning with the school
curriculum while aesthetically improving our school grounds.   We received
funding that has permitted us to start our project with the planting of one
hundred Green Ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica  var.lanceolata) and one hundred
Manitoba Maples (Acer negundo).
<P>
The elementary students began the project this spring.  Each student
planted a deciduous seedling in a pot and "adopted" it for the summer.  The
students will  plant the small trees on the school grounds in the fall
after their leaves drop.
<P>
Our plan for "live action research" is to integrate the care and
development of the trees with the provincial curriculum.  Students will
gather data on tree growth by taking height measurements at planting time
and at annual intervals thereafter.  Class studies on water cycles and soil
classification will be taught concurrently.
<P>
The collected data will be stored on a computer database and posted in
conjunction with our school division's "Kidsnet" technology program.  Other
schools or groups interested in this project are welcome to contact General
Byng School via the Internet at the following address:

<H2>Learning About Plants</h2><BR>
Compiled by Janice Harper, teacher, 
<br>Broadacres Junior School, Etobicoke ON
<P>
A grade one class in our school created a classroom pond in an old sandbox,
modeled on our outdoor pond.  After researching which types of plants and
animals would live in and around this habitat, the children grew a variety
of the appropriate plants and made models of animals to place in the
environment.
 <br clear><br>

<IMG SRC="nsonbroadacreskid3.jpeg" align=right hspace=10 border=0>
A grade five class identified plantain as a weed which they would like to
eliminate from our outdoor classroom.  The children divided into teams and
each team attempted to dig out the most plantain  (only weeds with roots
counted).  After twenty minutes, the teams counted the number of weeds that
they had collected and graphed the results.  The class then issued a
challenge to the rest of the school.

<B>Ossington Old Orchard P.S., Toronto Ont</B></center>
<P> 
The following examples from Ossington Old Orchard Public School in Toronto, illustrate how environmental activities are used across the curriculum
and not just as an "add-on".  These activities were done with groups of
children in the primary and junior grades.  The subject  studied was seeds.
<P> 
The younger children (from kindergarten and grade one) mixed dried seeds
commonly used as soup mix.  The seeds were identified (rice, several types
of beans, dried peas, lentils etc.) and sorted as to type, size, shape and
colour.  The seeds were counted and weighed and used to fill containers of
different volumes and shapes.  Soup was made and enjoyed by all the
classes.  Stories and folk tales were read about seed, planting and
gardening.  Finally, bean seeds were planted and cared for by the children
in the school garden.  Each child was able to harvest beans and eat them as
a snack.
<P> 
The children in grade two and three used the dried  seeds to make picture
mosaics after sorting and identifying them.  They also read stories
relating to seeds and planting.  In addition they read native legends about
corn, agriculture and the "three sisters" (beans, corn and squash).  These
children also made corn husk dolls and planted seeds in the school garden.
They learned about the composition of seeds, germination and soil
conditions.
<P> 
The junior level classes spent additional time studying native legends.
They learned about native planting patterns for the"three sisters", water
conservation, soil composition, geotropism, and heliotropism.  Many
experiments were done to illustrate these concepts.  The older children
also made "dream catchers" and wrote their own  "growing" legends

<H2>The Greenhouse: A Special Place To Learn</H2>
<P> 
by   Mary Pat Christie, Teacher,
<br> Lucy McCormick School, Toronto
<P> 
The benefits of working with plants have been known for centuries. With
this in mind, Lucy McCormick School, a facility devoted to the education of
students with a developmental handicap, includes regular visits to the
school's  greenhouse as an integral part of the curriculum.    The
students' time is divided between working as a group on a common project,
such as repotting cuttings or starting seeds, and working in the greenhouse
spraying or watering plants or  mixing soil.    Although many  students
require hand-over-hand assistance or close supervision, the horticulture
program provides endless opportunity for improved hand-eye coordination,
and manual dexterity.  The rhythm of tasks such as mixing soil, washing
pots and planting seeds can be relaxing and spatial.   Numerical aptitudes
can improve as a student transplants rooted cuttings or plants seeds.
Horticultural activities are conducted so that students learn to follow
instructions, make decisions, solve problems  and expand their vocabulary.
The horticulture program at Lucy McCormick ensures that the classroom is a
place where its students can grow emotionally, socially and intellectually.

<h3><b>Native Traditions, Native Plants</h3>
by John McKay, Teacher, 
<p>Princess Royal Elementary School, 
<p> Nanaimo, British

<IMG SRC="nsbcproyal2.jpeg" align=left hspace=10 border=0>
Native people lived for many years in harmony with nature, their source of
food, shelter, transportation, clothing and spiritual inspiration.  They
were the original conservationists and respected all living things.  Many
of our students are of First Nation  heritage so a section of our school
garden will include native plants that are used as food and/or medicine.
The plants will be labeled with their names in Hulq'uminum, the traditional
language of the Coast Salish people.  Eventually we will utilize the plants
as native peoples did in the past.
<br clear><p>
<IMG SRC="nsbcproyal3.jpeg" align=right hspace=10 border=0>
Naturally these plants are native to our area but unfortunately they are
becoming scarce as the land is developed.  We feel it is important that the
curriculum be used to nurture  in our students understanding and respect
for native traditions, plants and the environment.

<P>
Everyone loves talking about the weather.  But these days, weather
increasingly makes the news because of global warming and its potential to
dramatically change our climates worldwide.  Global Releaf - a programme of
Friends of the Earth - is concern about the impacts change and the thinning
of the ozone layer will have on our children
<P>
Because of these worries, Global Releaf encourages children of all ages to
plant trees where they go to school and where they play.  These tree will
provide protection from the sun and reduce the effects of heat on them and
their environment.  To do this, Global Releaf offers tree planting grants
twice a year for community tree planting project all across Canada.
<P>
This is only one example amongst many to show that people of all ages can
take action and participate improving the environment.

<H2>The Tree House naturalizes schools in New Brunswick</H2>
<P> 
by David Folster.
<P> 
For Arbor Day the Tree House in Fredericton, NB offered school packages of
200 tree seedlings, purchased with the help of a Tree Plan Canada grant.
To receive the trees, the schools had to create a plan showing where and
how the trees would be planted on school grounds, and how they would be
maintained.
<P> 
Eighty-six schools from all over the province submitted palns, most of them
done by students themselves. The trees were planted as natural dividers,
hedges, shelter belts, and wind breaks. They were arrayed so as to attract
wildlife, prevent erosion, add to an outdoor classroom, or make the grounds
more attractive and peaceful.
<P> 
Teachers and students planted the trees, which consisted of five high bush
cranberry, 40 eastern white cedar, and a mixture of red pine and white
spruce in each 200-seedling package.  Parents' committees, municipal
maintenance crews, and local nurseries also lent a hand.  In a few
instances, schools planted their trees in city parks or at senior's
complexes.
<P> 
At the same time The Tree House features school ground naturalization in
its annual promotional publication, The Arbor Day Planter , distributed to
schools, libraries, musems, and municipal governments.
<P> 
The Tree House, a non-profit organization, runs a variety of programs
throughout New Brunswick, including Woodsy Owl School Visits, Project
Learing Tree, Nature walks for youngsters, and The Tree House educational
resource center.  Its headquarters is at 124 St John Street, Fredericton,
New Brunswick, E3B 4A7. Tel: 506-452-1339   Fax: 506-452-7950

<H2>International School Grounds Day   May 3, 1995:</H2>
<P>
 A day of celebration to raise awareness about the importance of school
grounds.
<P>
May 3, 1995 saw the first annual international school grounds day
celebrated by thousands of children around the world.  The event obviously
captured peoples imagination:  creative ideas included maypole dancing,
tree surveys, official openings of special gardens and curriculum
activities.  The day involved more than 100,000 young people around Britain
and the interest spread abroad with schools in Canada, the United States,
Sweden and other parts of Europe participating.  Here are several examples
of how various Canadian schools celebrated this special day:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Broadacres Junior School  Etobicoke, ON</B> held a family breakfast 
with a multimedia display of their naturalization project.
<P>
<LI><B>General Byng School Winnipeg, MB</B> conducted a major tree 
planting and prairie habitat wildflower  program.
<P>
<LI><B>Port Hope High School Port Hope, ON</B> involved the whole school and 
community in the creation of their outdoor classroom and demonstrated to the
community how to plant for wildlife.
<P>
<LI><B>Richelieu Valley Regional High School McMasterville, Que</B> had the 
whole school focus on school ground naturalization and the...
<P>
<LI><B>Rocky View School Division 4 Calgary, AB</B> celebrated by planting 
trees in a number of schools.
</UL>
<P>
For information and ideas on how your school can participate in
International School Ground Day on May 3, 1996 please contact the Evergreen
Foundation.
<P>
In commemoration of International School Grounds Day the Evergreen
Foundation created the "Good Ideas Grow in School Grounds" poster with the
support of Learning Through Landscapes in Great Britain, Skolans Uterum in
Sweden, Barnas Uterum in Norway and the Cleveland Botanical Gardens in the
United States.  Copy appears in English, French, Spanish and Swedish. Color
posters can be ordered from Evergreen for $15 including
taxes, shipping and handling.

Smile!!  Yes, these projects are a lot of work but the rewards are numerous!!  The difference they generate in the children, makes it all worth it so...enjoy, discover and learn together!  
<p>
<OL>
	<LI>  Start small.  Build on your successes!  These projects are a PROCESS.  Add a little more each year.  Think about the opportunity of using the space as an outdoor classroom rather than just a beatification project.    

	<p><LI>  Approach your principal and school community.  Talk to teaching staff, parents (including your PAC), students, and members of your school community and neighbourhood.  Put a message in your school newsletter asking for interest and support.

	<p><LI>  Develop a committee.  Include the people above and any experts that you may find that might be interested.  Assign one or two to lead the project through the development (often organizations like to deal with the same person).  

	<p><LI>  Involve students, community and district maintenance staff from the beginning.  The key to a successful project is the involvement of all key stakeholders.  Include them in the planning, development and planting and the ongoing care and maintenance of your naturalization projects. Decide on priorities (eliciting comments/survey the stakeholders) and create different phases of the project.
	Keep people informed throughout! 

	<p><LI>  Start a binder to organize yourself--consider the following sections:  before and after pics, committee names and contact #'s, goals of project, project plan (including site map), record of contact with community (meetings), students input, maintenance/district contact, materials, funders, donations in-kind, volunteers, phase one, long term plans (including summer maintenance-- 1 yr, 2 yrs, 5 yrs), letters received, thank yous. 

	<p><LI>  Find Experts to assist. This applies to all components of your project from the planning to the planting and care. Go to your school community and neighbourhood first, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the resources available at your fingertips!  Contact other schools who may have a school ground naturalization project, these people are the true experts and may be able to offer helpful advise. 

	<p><LI>  Choose a Site.  It is essential to check with your grounds maintenance department in your district to ensure the project is following guidelines and policies set out in your area.  You must also consider the placement of waterlines, sewage and gas lines, drainage tiles or pipes, fire lanes, high traffic and service areas etc.  Also consider:  location, soil condition, sun exposure, etc.

	<p><LI>  Create a draft plan.  Get students input first, creating a sense of belonging and ownership.  Again, consider the particular components of your site.  Consult with your district maintenance department.  Be sure to include a plan for ongoing maintenance (including the summer). 

	<p><LI>  Find out about funding.  Look to your local community first, many things will be donated to your project.  Secondly, look to outside sources and funding agencies. 

<p>	<LI>  Materials.  Go to your community first, often people will donate materials and time rather than money.  (You never know when someone's brother runs a landscaping company!)  Find out about local companies, what they offer and how much they charge-- some may be willing to give you a discount if you let them know about the project.
	Native plants- replace traditional high-maintenance  landscapes with native plants that are better adapted to local soils and climate, usually require less watering, pruning, and fertilizing. Native plants welcome wildlife and lets natural habitat return to urban areas .

<h3><b> <a name = faq> Frequently Asked Questions - and some answers</b></h3>
<p>
We all agree that making school grounds a healthier learning environment is a step in the right direction!
As with every kind of project there are always challenges to address, however, let it not be the reason not to begin a project.  As with all concerns there are usually some alternative solutions to explore.  Here are 
some sugestions for some of the typical questions that arise.  Please let us know if you can add anything.

	<LI>	explain about the learning opportunity for the students and that this area will be used as an "outdoor classroom"
	<LI>	be prepared!...have a plan for what area you will be working on or are thinking about, and a maintenance plan ready to give/discuss with them which includes your plans for summer maintenance 
</UL>

<p><b>How do we deal with problems from unions?</b>

 <a name = queenmary><h3> <b> Queen Mary Elementary School Green Project</h3></b> 
 
	<p>Thank you for your interest in our Greening Project.  Our goal was to improve the outdoor environment in which our children learn and play.  Although our school is set in a beautiful neighborhood, the school ground more closely resembled a concrete pit.  Our committee was struck in September of 1994 and immediately set to work on designing a plan to bring nature into our school yard.  Meanwhile, the students raised funds to finance this project by way of a walkathon and the sale of the school trampoline.
 
	<p>After much effort and fine-tuning the building began in March 1995.  The courtyard area was graced with beautiful decorative pear trees which are covered in fragrant white blossoms in spring.  The planters are filled with interesting, even quirky varieties of plants.  We chose things which would provide the children with different textures, colors and fragrances, taking care to choose varieties that bloom during school months. 
	
	<p>The cedars will grow across the back of the fence and droop down to create a dragon effect!  We have left room for the children to plant bulbs in the fall and the teachers will be free to use the garden for their class science projects.  

	<p>The benches are built double-wide to allow several children to gather together.  We took special care to design the height of the planters so that they would provide seating for parents and children.  We have placed more benches around the school area to provide pleasant seating areas for many more children.  Another area of improvement is down the main driveway into the school.  Here we have planted young maple trees of a variety which will grow upright so as not to interfere with the tall fence surrounding the field.  The finishing touch is our "Welcoming Tree ", planted at the entrance to the school property.  It is a big maple tree which will turn scarlet in fall.  We then built a hexagonal bench around the base of this tree to create an inviting meeting spot for parents and children.  

	<p>Our final purchase this year was two special garbage containers which add a splash of color to the play area and are designed to prevent the crows from scattering garbage all about.  These have been such a hit that we are hoping to purchase several more next year and in time we may eradicate the problems of the crows altogether. 

	<p>I hope this summary of our project, and the "before and after" photos help to illustrate to you how this sort of endeavor can benefit your community and enrich your child's schooling environment.
<p>
									Yours truly, <br>
									Janet MacPhail  

 <a name = queenmary2><p><br><b>Queen Mary Greening Project "How to"</b><p>

	<p>The Queen Mary project began with a simple suggestion from our new principal, Murray Stephenson.  He felt that the look of the school yard was a little bleak and that it could be improved by the planting of a few trees.  The idea really took off and the result is a stunning improvement.  I hope that these suggestions will help in your own planning process.

<b><p>Strike a committee -</b> Interested parents will offer to take on this project.  The best people for the job are; an organizer, an architect, an expert gardener, and several interested helpers.  The organizer, architect, and gardener form the core group. Early meetings-these will be brainstorming sessions and may be frustrating as the focus seems to switch and change.  Try to view this as a good thing, as it will allow you to speak confidently about your choices when they are challenged later.  There are bound to be critics as the job gets underway and it is comforting to know that you have considered lots of options prior to making the final plan.  Eventually, the ideas will be honed down to a workable plan which can then be presented to the school board.  

<b><p>Involve as many people as possible - </b>ask for parental input through the newsletter and at monthly meetings.  Send a committee member to speak to the students' council asking for student ideas and priorities.  One or two teacher representatives will inform you of the teachers' thoughts for outdoor classroom opportunities.  If your project involves neighboring community facilities, speak to their representatives to get valuable support and interest. 
 
<b><p>Later meetings - </b>Once you have canvassed many people at the start of the project it is necessary to reduce the number of active committee members to the core group, the principal, and one or two others which may change from meeting to meeting.  This will allow for more decisive meetings and less frustration.  Other members will still be called upon to help, but it isn't necessary to try and get all members out to each meeting.   

<b><p>Fundraising - </b>Your project must be funded, or at least promised to be funded, before the planning goes too far so that you know what the scope of the work will be.  Student, parental, and community fundraising is beneficial in creating a sense of pride in the project.  This will be important over time to help prevent vandalism and deterioration through neglect.  Fundraising should also include the application for funds from local groups such as Evergreen Foundation, Vancity, local merchants associations, etc.   

<b><p>School board involvement -</b> Once you have a rough idea of what you would like to do, contact the school board maintenance department to arrange a meeting at the site.  These people are vital to your project and have years of experience in dealing with the restrictions and special limitations of school yards.  You will discover that some of your ideas have been tried in other schools and have been disastrous.  Your meeting with the maintenance department will surely result in changes to your plan but they will be for the best.  Once again, remember that you will be asked to defend your choices later and it helps to have considered many options.

<b><p>Drawing up the plans - </b>This is where your architect is invaluable.  The best thing to do is to obtain a copy of the school yard blueprint and work from that.  It will tell you of underground water pipes etc. and will be a good starting point.  Be as specific as possible, including measurements of planter boxes, materials preferred and plants desired.  If your site is near roadways, be sure to find out about firelane restrictions.   

<b><p>Plant Materials - </b>Choose plants which are native to the area, reducing the need for maintenance and improving the chance of freedom from disease.  We chose plants which would be intriguing to children by way of appearance, texture, color, and smell.  Plants were chosen so that they would do their thing during the school months.  Room was left to allow space for children to plant bulbs in fall.  

<b><p>Formalities - </b>Once your project is fairly definite, write to the school board facilities services department to obtain a budget for the work.  They meet at specified times during the month and once your plan is received and approved it will be passed on to maintenance for a quote.  

<b><p>Getting quotes - </b>As with any building project, it is recommended that you get at least three quotes.  This is where the school board can be very competitive.  They are able to provide many plant materials at minimal cost and the labor is reasonable.  Be sure to discuss all plant and building material choices with maintenance as there are many restrictions for school yards.  Once you receive all quotes and adjust the plan to meet available funds, write to facility services again.  This time you are informing them of your plan to go ahead, and how much you plan to spend.  

<b><p>Work begins - </b>The starting day of the project will be very exhilarating.  It will also bring out many people who now feel compelled to offer advice!  

<b><p>Completion - </b>The job, once started, should be completed as soon as possible to avoid the problem of vandalism. The coordinator may need to pressure the crew to stay on task if they have more than one project on the go. 
  
<b><p>Maintenance - </b>Summertime maintenance is especially necessary during the first year.  A schedule of parent volunteers for the hot months from early May to October will be necessary to allow plants to become established.  Encourage all parents, students and teachers to "own" the garden.  Everyone should feel welcome to pull a few weeds while waiting to pick up their children, or re-secure a new plant which has become loosened from its bed.  This ownership was wonderfully illustrated by an event which happened at our garden in May, soon after it was completed.  One weekend, as part of a child's birthday party activities a group of several children came to the school yard.  The parents distributed purple pansy plants amongst the girls who proceeded to plant them all around the beds.  Those pansies came as such a delight to everyone, and they continued to bloom right through to the fall.  In addition, the day care planted tomato, corn and sunflower plants which grew wildly and provided a fabulous surprise to the students returning to school in September.  

<b><p>Finally - </b>This is a huge undertaking and requires a lot of time.  The coordinator's job will be to pull it all together and constantly prod the other committee members to do the job they have been assigned.  The results will be well worth the effort.

<a name = gettingstarted><b>Getting Started...</h3>
<p>
Smile!!  Yes, these projects are a lot of work but the rewards are numerous!!  The difference they generate in the children, makes it all worth it so...enjoy, discover and learn together!  
<p>
<OL>
	<LI>  Start small.  Build on your successes!  These projects are a PROCESS.  Add a little more each year.  Think about the opportunity of using the space as an outdoor classroom rather than just a beatification project.    

	<p><LI>  Approach your principal and school community.  Talk to teaching staff, parents (including your PAC), students, and members of your school community and neighbourhood.  Put a message in your school newsletter asking for interest and support.

	<p><LI>  Develop a committee.  Include the people above and any experts that you may find that might be interested.  Assign one or two to lead the project through the development (often organizations like to deal with the same person).  

	<p><LI>  Involve students, community and district maintenance staff from the beginning.  The key to a successful project is the involvement of all key stakeholders.  Include them in the planning, development and planting and the ongoing care and maintenance of your naturalization projects. Decide on priorities (eliciting comments/survey the stakeholders) and create different phases of the project.
	Keep people informed throughout! 

	<p><LI>  Start a binder to organize yourself--consider the following sections:  before and after pics, committee names and contact #'s, goals of project, project plan (including site map), record of contact with community (meetings), students input, maintenance/district contact, materials, funders, donations in-kind, volunteers, phase one, long term plans (including summer maintenance-- 1 yr, 2 yrs, 5 yrs), letters received, thank yous. 

	<p><LI>  Find Experts to assist. This applies to all components of your project from the planning to the planting and care. Go to your school community and neighbourhood first, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the resources available at your fingertips!  Contact other schools who may have a school ground naturalization project, these people are the true experts and may be able to offer helpful advise. 

	<p><LI>  Choose a Site.  It is essential to check with your grounds maintenance department in your district to ensure the project is following guidelines and policies set out in your area.  You must also consider the placement of waterlines, sewage and gas lines, drainage tiles or pipes, fire lanes, high traffic and service areas etc.  Also consider:  location, soil condition, sun exposure, etc.

	<p><LI>  Create a draft plan.  Get students input first, creating a sense of belonging and ownership.  Again, consider the particular components of your site.  Consult with your district maintenance department.  Be sure to include a plan for ongoing maintenance (including the summer). 

	<p><LI>  Find out about funding.  Look to your local community first, many things will be donated to your project.  Secondly, look to outside sources and funding agencies. 

<p>	<LI>  Materials.  Go to your community first, often people will donate materials and time rather than money.  (You never know when someone's brother runs a landscaping company!)  Find out about local companies, what they offer and how much they charge-- some may be willing to give you a discount if you let them know about the project.
	Native plants- replace traditional high-maintenance  landscapes with native plants that are better adapted to local soils and climate, usually require less watering, pruning, and fertilizing. Native plants welcome wildlife and lets natural habitat return to urban areas .

<a name = faq><h3><b> Frequently Asked Questions - and some answers</b></h3>
<p>
We all agree that making school grounds a healthier learning environment is a step in the right direction!
As with every kind of project there are always challenges to address, however, let it not be the reason not to begin a project.  As with all concerns there are usually some alternative solutions to explore.  Here are 
some sugestions for some of the typical questions that arise.  Please let us know if you can add anything. 
<p>

	<LI>	Staff				
	<LI>	Community
</UL>

<p><b>How do we get the support of the Maintenance Department?</b>

	<LI>	ask if they have any regulations concerning these type of projects--stress that you want to follow the rules but need to know them
	<LI>	explain about the learning opportunity for the students and that this area will be used as an "outdoor classroom"
	<LI>	be prepared!...have a plan for what area you will be working on or are thinking about, and a maintenance plan ready to give/discuss with them which includes your plans for summer maintenance 
</UL>

<p><b>How do we deal with problems from unions?</b>
	<UL>
	<LI>by letting them know that these projects are for instructional purposes
	</UL>

		</UL>
	<LI>	plant native including drought resistant species that are better suited to our local environment
</UL>

<p><b>What about vandalism?</b>
<UL>
	<LI>	foster a sense of ownership/responsibility among your students and the community  by getting them involved from the beginning with the plans, research, and fundraising as well as with the planting and care of the outdoor classroom
	<LI>	it has been proven that vandalism actually decreases when this is done
	<LI>	when students have such ownership they will have a lower tolerace level for others who are doing harm and will "call" them on it
	<LI>	the same applies for neighbours and the community, if they have been involved in the project they will be more likely to report any disturbances to that space 
</UL>

<p><b>How do we fund the project?</b>
<UL>
	<LI>	apply for grants to support your project, refer to the funders list provided by The Evergreen Foundation	
	<LI>	rely on "in-kind" donations from your school community as well as the local neighbours and community at large
	<LI>	sometimes your PAC will be willing to contribute some funds
</UL>

<p><b>What about safety issues?</b>
<UL>
	<LI>	encourage high use of the area-an area that is well used offers security for children
	<LI>	keep bushes trimmed/use short ones so that people can't hide behind them
	<LI>	plenty of "escape routes" so a child cannot become trapped within an area
	<LI>	keep tree branches trimmed up for easy supervision
	<LI>	choose species with these factors in mind and keep your area well maintained
</UL>

<p><b>How do we ensure the continuity of the project?</b>

	<LI>	install other plants around the base of the tree 
	<LI>	put in more trees and spread out the love!
</UL>

<p><b>How do we get community support?</b>

<a name = queenmary> <h3> <b> Queen Mary Elementary School Green Project (Vancouver, B.C.)</h3></b> 
 
	<p>Thank you for your interest in our Greening Project.  Our goal was to improve the outdoor environment in which our children learn and play.  Although our school is set in a beautiful neighborhood, the school ground more closely resembled a concrete pit.  Our committee was struck in September of 1994 and immediately set to work on designing a plan to bring nature into our school yard.  Meanwhile, the students raised funds to finance this project by way of a walkathon and the sale of the school trampoline.
 
	<p>After much effort and fine-tuning the building began in March 1995.  The courtyard area was graced with beautiful decorative pear trees which are covered in fragrant white blossoms in spring.  The planters are filled with interesting, even quirky varieties of plants.  We chose things which would provide the children with different textures, colors and fragrances, taking care to choose varieties that bloom during school months. 
	
	<p>The cedars will grow across the back of the fence and droop down to create a dragon effect!  We have left room for the children to plant bulbs in the fall and the teachers will be free to use the garden for their class science projects.  

	<p>The benches are built double-wide to allow several children to gather together.  We took special care to design the height of the planters so that they would provide seating for parents and children.  We have placed more benches around the school area to provide pleasant seating areas for many more children.  Another area of improvement is down the main driveway into the school.  Here we have planted young maple trees of a variety which will grow upright so as not to interfere with the tall fence surrounding the field.  The finishing touch is our "Welcoming Tree ", planted at the entrance to the school property.  It is a big maple tree which will turn scarlet in fall.  We then built a hexagonal bench around the base of this tree to create an inviting meeting spot for parents and children.  

	<p>Our final purchase this year was two special garbage containers which add a splash of color to the play area and are designed to prevent the crows from scattering garbage all about.  These have been such a hit that we are hoping to purchase several more next year and in time we may eradicate the problems of the crows altogether. 

	<p>I hope this summary of our project, and the "before and after" photos help to illustrate to you how this sort of endeavor can benefit your community and enrich your child's schooling environment.
<p>
									Yours truly, <br>
									Janet MacPhail  

<a name = queenmary2><p><br><b>Queen Mary Greening Project "How to"</b><p>

	<p>The Queen Mary project began with a simple suggestion from our new principal, Murray Stephenson.  He felt that the look of the school yard was a little bleak and that it could be improved by the planting of a few trees.  The idea really took off and the result is a stunning improvement.  I hope that these suggestions will help in your own planning process.

<b><p>Strike a committee -</b> Interested parents will offer to take on this project.  The best people for the job are; an organizer, an architect, an expert gardener, and several interested helpers.  The organizer, architect, and gardener form the core group. Early meetings-these will be brainstorming sessions and may be frustrating as the focus seems to switch and change.  Try to view this as a good thing, as it will allow you to speak confidently about your choices when they are challenged later.  There are bound to be critics as the job gets underway and it is comforting to know that you have considered lots of options prior to making the final plan.  Eventually, the ideas will be honed down to a workable plan which can then be presented to the school board.  

<b><p>Involve as many people as possible - </b>ask for parental input through the newsletter and at monthly meetings.  Send a committee member to speak to the students' council asking for student ideas and priorities.  One or two teacher representatives will inform you of the teachers' thoughts for outdoor classroom opportunities.  If your project involves neighboring community facilities, speak to their representatives to get valuable support and interest. 
 
<b><p>Later meetings - </b>Once you have canvassed many people at the start of the project it is necessary to reduce the number of active committee members to the core group, the principal, and one or two others which may change from meeting to meeting.  This will allow for more decisive meetings and less frustration.  Other members will still be called upon to help, but it isn't necessary to try and get all members out to each meeting.   

<b><p>Fundraising - </b>Your project must be funded, or at least promised to be funded, before the planning goes too far so that you know what the scope of the work will be.  Student, parental, and community fundraising is beneficial in creating a sense of pride in the project.  This will be important over time to help prevent vandalism and deterioration through neglect.  Fundraising should also include the application for funds from local groups such as Evergreen Foundation, Vancity, local merchants associations, etc.   

<b><p>School board involvement -</b> Once you have a rough idea of what you would like to do, contact the school board maintenance department to arrange a meeting at the site.  These people are vital to your project and have years of experience in dealing with the restrictions and special limitations of school yards.  You will discover that some of your ideas have been tried in other schools and have been disastrous.  Your meeting with the maintenance department will surely result in changes to your plan but they will be for the best.  Once again, remember that you will be asked to defend your choices later and it helps to have considered many options.

<b><p>Drawing up the plans - </b>This is where your architect is invaluable.  The best thing to do is to obtain a copy of the school yard blueprint and work from that.  It will tell you of underground water pipes etc. and will be a good starting point.  Be as specific as possible, including measurements of planter boxes, materials preferred and plants desired.  If your site is near roadways, be sure to find out about firelane restrictions.   

<b><p>Plant Materials - </b>Choose plants which are native to the area, reducing the need for maintenance and improving the chance of freedom from disease.  We chose plants which would be intriguing to children by way of appearance, texture, color, and smell.  Plants were chosen so that they would do their thing during the school months.  Room was left to allow space for children to plant bulbs in fall.  

<b><p>Formalities - </b>Once your project is fairly definite, write to the school board facilities services department to obtain a budget for the work.  They meet at specified times during the month and once your plan is received and approved it will be passed on to maintenance for a quote.  

<b><p>Getting quotes - </b>As with any building project, it is recommended that you get at least three quotes.  This is where the school board can be very competitive.  They are able to provide many plant materials at minimal cost and the labor is reasonable.  Be sure to discuss all plant and building material choices with maintenance as there are many restrictions for school yards.  Once you receive all quotes and adjust the plan to meet available funds, write to facility services again.  This time you are informing them of your plan to go ahead, and how much you plan to spend.  

<b><p>Work begins - </b>The starting day of the project will be very exhilarating.  It will also bring out many people who now feel compelled to offer advice!  

<b><p>Completion - </b>The job, once started, should be completed as soon as possible to avoid the problem of vandalism. The coordinator may need to pressure the crew to stay on task if they have more than one project on the go. 
  
<b><p>Maintenance - </b>Summertime maintenance is especially necessary during the first year.  A schedule of parent volunteers for the hot months from early May to October will be necessary to allow plants to become established.  Encourage all parents, students and teachers to "own" the garden.  Everyone should feel welcome to pull a few weeds while waiting to pick up their children, or re-secure a new plant which has become loosened from its bed.  This ownership was wonderfully illustrated by an event which happened at our garden in May, soon after it was completed.  One weekend, as part of a child's birthday party activities a group of several children came to the school yard.  The parents distributed purple pansy plants amongst the girls who proceeded to plant them all around the beds.  Those pansies came as such a delight to everyone, and they continued to bloom right through to the fall.  In addition, the day care planted tomato, corn and sunflower plants which grew wildly and provided a fabulous surprise to the students returning to school in September.  

<b><p>Finally - </b>This is a huge undertaking and requires a lot of time.  The coordinator's job will be to pull it all together and constantly prod the other committee members to do the job they have been assigned.  The results will be well worth the effort.

<center><h2> SCHOOLYARD ECOLOGY FOR <BR>
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHERS</h2> </center>

<BR>
WHAT IS SYEFEST?
<BR>
SYEFEST is "Schoolyard Ecology for Elementary School Teachers," a
project of the Institute of Ecosystem Studies (IES) in Millbrook, New
York. The Ecological Society of America is an active supporter, and
funds have been provided by the National Science Foundation.
<BR>
SYEFEST is for teachers, students and scientists ...
<BR>
   - Teachers learn to use their own schoolyards and develop skills in
     teaching science through guided and open-ended inquiries.
<BR>
   - Students discover that nature is everywhere, and that science gives
     them a way  to build their own understanding of the natural world.
<BR>
   - Scientists take an active role in fostering ecological literacy of
     next generation of citizens.
<P>
HOW DOES SYEFEST WORK?
<BR>
SYEFEST is a family of teams comprising a teacher and an ecologist,
coordinated by scientists and educators at IES. During its first year,
1994, over 150 teachers across the United States took part in SYEFEST.
<BR>
SYEFEST teachers participate in ...
<BR>
   - a ten-day SUMMER INSTITUTE where they become ecological researchers
     and reflect on their teaching practices, leaving with new skills
     and concrete plans for the school year.
<BR>
   - three days of FOLLOW UP PROGRAMS during the school year.
<BR>
   - the national SCHOOLYARD ECOLOGY NETWORK of ecologists and
     educators, sharing ecology research results and teaching methods
     with others nationwide.
<P>
INTERESTED IN SCHOOLYARD ECOLOGY?
<BR>
SYEFEST is developing a Schoolyard Ecology Network for anyone interested
in schoolyard ecology. The Network's publications will include a
directory of teachers and their interests, and a periodic newsletter
with practical ideas for teaching ecology in the schoolyard and
information about the next generation of SYEFEST activities for 1995 and
beyond. The insights and successful strategies developed in SYEFEST will
be shared through a Schoolyard Ecology Teacher Development Manual,
scheduled for completion in early 1996.
<BR>
To become part of the Schoolyard Ecology Network, please write or send
the form to:<BR>
     Dr. Alan R. Berkowitz, SYEFEST PROJECT DIRECTOR, or<BR>
     Ms. Catherine A. Corey, SYEFEST PROJECT COORDINATOR<BR>

<TITLE> Everett Crowley Park: Ecological Stewardship Process: 
Natural Communities: </TITLE>



</HEAD>
<BODY>

<br>

<h2>The Ecological Stewardship Process</h2></center>

Everett Crowley Park is a large, though little known gem in South 
East Vancouver. It is a park with lots of community spirit and a 
very colourful history as Vancouver's former dump. During the past 
25 years the area has been left to be reclaimed by nature and recover 
from the disturbance.
<p>
<IMG SRC="nceverettlogo.gif" align=right border=0>
As cities grow,  plant and animal habitat becomes increasingly 
fragmented causing undocumented effects on the health of our cities. 
Yet, natural areas are vital to the health of our cities and are a 
tremendous educational and recreational resource. The sustainability 
of our urban centres depends upon our ability to rehabilitate our 
cities and, in the long term, integrate our lives with nature.
<p>
The Evergreen Foundation has been supporting the Champlain Heights Community's
efforts in Everet Crowley park since April 1993, when a tree planting event was
organized for the park. The Ecological Stewardship Process was launched in 
the fall of 1995,  and will result in the identification of: 
the flora and fauna of the park; the history of the park; 
and any opportunities to enhance the habitat of the park. <p>

Local schools, community groups and residents of all ages 
and skills will be involved in collecting this background 
information and using it to participate in the enhancement 
of park habitat. An ecological assessment, park user survey, 
workshops, special events and the initiation of an interpretive 
program are just some of the many projects to become involved in.

<br><br>



<H2>Ecological Assessment in Everett Crowley Park </H2>
<p><br>

<H3><A NAME="goalsandobjectives">Goal of Ecological Assessment</A></H3>

The goal of this exciting project is:
<UL>
	<LI>to compile information on the flora, fauna and other ecological elements of the park in order
		to develop recommendations for the future health of Everett Crowley Park and the Community.
</UL>
<p>
<H3>Objectives of the Ecological Assessment</H3>

The objectives are:
<UL>
	<LI>to conduct surveys and analyze how Wild Life and Humans use Everett Crowley Park 
	<LI>to interpret and report on the ecological profile of the Park and the connection with humans
</UL>

<p><br>
<H3>Ecological Assessment Work</H3>
The ecological assessment will consist of collecting baseline data for terrestrial and aquatic 
ecosystems and human impacts which will be presented to the Community in a final report.
<p>
<h4>I - Base Line Data Collection</h4>

<b> A)	Wild Life and Habitat Surveys </b>

<b>Flora</b>
<UL>
	<LI>identify and record the composition and structure of the vegetation in the Park 
</UL>

<b>Fauna </b>
<UL>
	<LI>identify and quantify insects, herptiles, and birds and assess their different life history 
		requirements in the Park
</UL>

Note: small mammal studies will not be conducted with volunteers because of concerns with the Hanta virus.  Alternative procedures are being examined so that this facet of the assessment can still be completed. 
<p>
<b>Water Bodies</b>
<UL>
	<LI>complete an analysis of the water quality of the pond and stream 
	<LI>map the stream and riparian area
</UL>


<b>Soil</b> 

<UL>
	<LI>determine general conditions of soil within various areas of the park correlate them to 
		existing vegetation and the potential for reintroducing native species 
</UL>
	<p><br>
<H4>B) 	Survey of Human Uses of Everett Crowley Park</H4>

<b>Park User Survey</b>
The park user survey will:

<UL>
	<LI>identify who visits the park and how often
	<LI>assess peoples attitudes regarding the park and why they use it or do not use it
	<LI>discover people's awareness of the Park's history, its Wild Life, as well as sociological 
		and ecological pressures affecting the Park	
	<LI>document what people envision the future of the Park to be
</UL>
<p><br>
<H4>C) History of Conditions at Everett Crowley Park	</H4>

<b>Natural and Human History</b>	

Components of the history section will involve:

<UL>
	<LI>conducting archival research and resident interviews
	<LI>preparing lists of animal and plant species that might have frequented the area
	   (including stream life) prior to European settlement
	<LI>determining former human uses of the park
	<LI>determining historical conditions of the stream including its location prior to being used 
		as a dump site
	<LI>compiling the information available regarding the landfill 
	<LI>finding photos, maps, stories, anecdotes and illustrations of Everett Crowley Park and the
	    Champlain Heights / Killarney area.
</UL>
<p><br>

<H3>II 	Final Report on the Ecological Status of Everett Crowley Park</H3>
A written assessment of the Park will be prepared which will provide information on potential 
opportunities for habitat enhancement.

<H4>A) Assessment Results	</H4>
The results of the assessment components will consist of:

<UL>
	<LI>results of Flora, Fauna, Stream, Soil, Park User, and Natural History Surveys
	<LI>identifying vegetative communities within the park and faunal wild life that they could support
	<LI>preparing a series of maps which describe conditions of park according to the results of the
		baseline data  
	
</UL>
	
<H4>B) Conclusions	</H4>

Conclusions will be formulated for:

<UL>
	<LI>the general health of the park
	<LI>its role as an ecological and social link in South East Vancouver / GVRD
	<LI>the general attitude(s) of community members towards the Park 
	<LI>the Community's priorities regarding enhancement projects
	
</UL>


<H4>C)	Recommendations</H4> 

The recommendations to be developed for the Community to evaluate and accept according to their 
ideas, will entail:

<OL>
	<LI>suggesting any areas for habitat enhancement including: 

	<UL>
		<LI>		reintroduction of native species
		<LI>		managing aggressive species which may be threatening habitat
		<LI>		opportunities for slope and stream bank stabilization to prevent erosion and 
					sedimentation of stream
	</UL>

	<LI>suggesting areas to leave for Nature to continue regenerating without any human interference


	<LI>suggesting appropriate species and respective amounts, for reintroduction in areas 
		identified as suitable for habitat enhancement (e.g. signs, washrooms, greater disabled 
		access to the park etc.)

	<LI>proposing opportunities for linking wildlife corridors, expanding connections to river and 
		other natural areas, for example, Burnaby Central Park, the Fraser River, and Fraserview
		Golf Course.
</OL>

<H2>PLANTS OBSERVED IN EVERETT CROWLEY PARK, MAY 22, 1996.</H2>

On May 22, Terry Taylor, an expert botanist in Vancouver British Columbia, traversed 
Everett Crowley Park in the rain and identified all of the plant species that he could
find.  Wow !!  He then compiled the following comprenhesive vegetation species list.
Please note that they have <EM>not</EM> been organized into Families.  They have
been separated into major plant categories (e.g. trees and shrubs), and 
alphabetized according to the <EM><B>common name</B></EM>.
<P>
 
His volunteer contribution will be incredibly valuable to the Champlain Heights 
community, the Evergreen Foundation, and the numerous participants in the 
vegetation surveys.  <STRONG>THANKS TERRY FOR ALL YOUR FINE WORK.</STRONG>
<P>

Before checking out the species, <A HREF="mailto:martha@evergreen.ca">what is your
best guesstimate</A> as to how many have been identified as of May 22, 1996?  If 
you don't mind we will publish the names of those who have replied with their 
guesses on this web page. The correct answer will be published here at the end of 
July.
<P>

I would like to know what plants, in the following categories, grow in Everett 
Crowley Park:

Well, if you have gone through this entire list, you will realize that there are an
incredible number of plant species, native and non-native, growing in Everett
Crowely Park.  This impressive mixture has colonized and prospered over the last
thirty years since it was closed as Vancouver's garbage disposal site.
<P>

Do not forget to <A HREF="mailto:martha@evergreen.ca">guess the number of species</A> 
or let us know what <A HREF="mailto:martha@evergreen.ca">new plant discoveries</A>
you have made.  Thanks!

<h3> The results of this survey will be used as part of a larger ecological assessment of the 
park currently underway. The final ecological assessment report will be presented to the Everett Crowley park
Committee, a sub-sommittee of Champlain Heights Community Association, in October 1996. This report will
be a valuable tool for the local community to plan and care for the health of the park.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
<BR>


The Evergreen Foundation would like to thank Tree Plan Canada (Forestry Canada) and the Community Planning Fund (Environment Canada) for providing direction and funding for Ground Work '94.  Thanks also to the University of Guelph for their support and the use of their facilities and services for the conference.  Finally, a special thanks to all the speakers and the participants of Ground Work '94.  Without any of these contributions, the event would not have enjoyed the success it did.
<P>
PREFACE
<BR>
The idea for this conference arose from the need to acknowledge and develop the abilities and accomplishments of community naturalization groups.  The Evergreen Foundation, Tree Plan Canada, and the Community Planning Fund teamed-up to design a forum to help solve common problems, recognize excellence and identify new directions in community based tree planting.  Ground Work '94 was the product of this partnership and through a stimulating environment of learning, discussion, and networking these goals were met.
<P>
Ground Work '94 was held March 26, 1994 at the University of Guelph and was attended by 125 participants.  These participants represented over 80 individuals, community groups, school boards, universities, private enterprises and government agencies all with a common interest in planting and naturalization.  The event was a success, the first indicator and perhaps the best compliment was the fact that the conference was over-subscribed and a waiting list was created for overflow registration.  The speakers were of excellent quality and presented a wide array of topics; there was material of interest for everyone attending.  Follow-up evaluations were full of comments such as "practical, useful, informative, inspiring and a great day!"   The evaluations also provided direction for the next time in terms of new topics, facility, location, services and format.  People are still talking about it and hopefully taking some new skills to the field for the upcoming planting season.  
<P>
For those that commented "looking forward to next time" and for those who missed this one, The Evergreen Foundation is pleased to announce that preparations are already underway for another "Ground Work" early June in Vancouver organized through our regional office EF-West, and a national conference series in the fall of 94' on school ground naturalization aptly named "Learning Grounds".  Stay in touch and we'll see you there.
<P>
EDITOR'S NOTE

'WILD THING' <BR>

Naturalization is a feeling for all that is wild and free in our spirit and in our world. Through a variety of mediums, whether song, poetry, or photography, the philosophy of naturalization with all its' inherent beauty can be related to people and communities.  As passion and devotion are an integral part of our lives in things we hold dear, to foster this in communities within the context of naturalization must be a starting point for all of us.

<a name =FORWARD>FORWARD</a>


<P>The concept of biodiversity reflects the most fundamental elements of life on earth and it is being seriously threatened by human action. Explosive population growth, urban sprawl, overindulgent resource use, and toxic pollutants have made life on earth increasingly precarious. 

<P>As the search for solutions to the growing international environmental crisis continues, many claim that the most important issues lie in preserving what is left.  By the same token a growing number of people are considering the massive potential held by the process of restoration. The obvious answer is an effective combination of both preservation and restoration. 

<P>Preservation compartmentalizes nature, separates it from us and protects it by building a wall around it. This act is necessary and very effective in the short and medium terms. But long term change will only come with a fundamental shift in our relationship with nature.  

<P>Restoration offers this hope. If managed effectively restoration can accelerate and set the stage for short and medium term improvements in biodiversity conservation, and begin to transform the way we interact with nature.  As stated by Edward Grumbine ÒIf we begin to gain direct experience with ecosystems by working to protect biodiversity, we may find that nature becomes part of culture again.Ó 

<P>We must begin to rethink the way we integrate our lives with nature. The process of restoration will help us reconnect with the natural world and establish an understanding of our place in the  environment. As the 1990Õs progress, restoration projects are being adopted by a variety of land managers around the world. Barren landscapes are being reforested,  wetlands and waterways are being brought back to life and existing forest fragments are being linked and expanded. 

<P>The success of restoration lies in our ability to work effectively in this infinitely complicated field. This publication has been designed to introduce the concepts of biodiversity, present the principals of conservation and offer guidelines for action. 

<P>The original hope for this study was to prove - beyond a doubt - that restoration work has a positive impact on biodiversity conservation. Unfortunately it is not that simple. An enormous learning curve lies ahead for all restorationists and we must do all we can to move along this curve quickly - time is of the essence.

<P><h3><A  name = INTRODUCTION>INTRODUCTION 		</a></h3>

<P>As the environmental restoration movement gains momentum, an increasing number of books and documents are appearing on the subject.  Many of these are "how-to-style" manuals designed to direct action and provide resources.  This document is designed to supplement existing manuals as an informative reference with a specific focus on restoration and biodiversity.  As a report that deals with complex issues, it is primarily targeted towards those who are actively involved in restoration.  A  glossary has been provided so that the information presented should be comprehensible to all.
<P>While emphasizing that a landscape approach is needed to fully address biodiversity conservation concerns, this document makes special reference to urban areas in recognition that most public plantings occur in this context.

<P>An increasing number of programs and accompanying documents are advocating restoration as a means of helping biodiversity. Unfortunately, it is often assumed that attracting wildlife and helping biodiversity are one and the same.  This is not necessarily true.  Furthermore, many documents imply that public restoration and naturalization projects automatically benefit biodiversity and fail to recognize that under some circumstances serious negative consequences might also result from such actions.
<P>It is important to direct action away from potential problem areas towards genuinely positive solutions to specific biodiversity conservation concerns.  Hopefully this will help ensure that the limited resources available for biodiversity conservation are wisely allocated.  Thus the objectives of this document are:
<OL>
	<LI> To clearly define the concept of biodiversity.  
	<p><LI> To introduce some basic biodiversity conservation concerns and some fundamentals of conservation biology, the science that deals with biodiversity conservation.
	<P><LI> To show how restoration (or naturalization) activities can have an impact on biodiversity in both positive and  negative ways.
	<P><LI> To provide guidelines on how to address biodiversity conservation concerns through ecologically sound restoration projects.
</OL>
<P>Restoration ecology and conservation biology are both relatively new fields of discipline, and the issues that they deal with are highly complex.  Therefore, much of the discussion about the potential impacts of restoration on biodiversity is speculative.  As will become obvious, one can not address biodiversity goals in isolation.  Whatever action is taken to deal with one issue will have some form of impact on biodiversity elsewhere.  For this reason it is important to develop monitoring programs to study exactly how, and to what degree restoration projects do affect biodiversity.  In the meantime, the best approach is to know about the issues and possibilities, and to make decisions accordingly. It is hoped that this document will contribute significantly to this awareness.
<P>It should be emphasized that, given our limited understanding of ecosystem dynamics, restoration is still very much a process of trial and error.  While the replacement of lost or degraded habitat represents an important and even necessary approach to biodiversity conservation, most acknowledge that there is no substitute for the protection of existing significant habitat.

<P><h3><A name = PART1>PART 1	A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION BIOLOGY	</a></h3></b>
Before exploring the potential impacts of restoration work on biodiversity it is important to clarify key concepts and to introduce some conservation concerns that might be addressed through restoration projects.  This section is divided into two parts.  In order to deal with common misconceptions, the first part introduces biodiversity as a concept and conservation issue.  The second part is designed to aquaint the reader with the science and methodologies of conserving biodiversity.
<p>
<A name = a>a.  WHAT IS BIODIVERSITY?
<br>The popularity of the term biodiversity (a contraction of biological diversity) has increased dramatically in the past decade - to the degree that it is at risk of becoming a much misunderstood buzzword.  Part of the confusion is undoubtedly based on the failure to recognize biodiversity as a broad concept rather than a specific phenomenon.  In order to simplify what is in reality a complex issue, the term is frequently interpreted using the tangible concept of species.  As a result, biodiversity is often mistakenly thought to be synonymous with species diversity, that is the number of species within a particular area, or what is referred to by biologists as Òspecies richness.Ó  Thus ÒhelpingÓ biodiversity has often meant public action to provide opportunities for as many species as possible - especially through habitat restoration work.  Yet, species diversity is only one component of the broader concept of biodiversity.  Focusing on this alone while ignoring other issues can potentially work against biodiversity conservation goals.
<p>The numerous definitions of biodiversity currently in use do little to eliminate the confusion.  According to the World Conservation Monitoring Center the term biodiversity Òis commonly used to describe the number, variety and variability of living organismsÓ (Groombridge 1992).  A more concise definition is provided in the Global Biodiversity Strategy.  This document states that Òbiodiversity is the totality of genes, species and ecosystems in a regionÓ (WRI, & UNEP 1992).  Although they appear to be different, each of these definitions is correct, and in fact they are complementary.  The former emphasizes variety and variability of life forms, a crucial component of the concept.  The latter definition clarifies the three basic levels at which this variety and variability is recognized: genetic, species and ecosystem.
<p>What is needed is a comprehensive definition that encompasses both of those described above.  Conservation biologists Reed Noss and Allen Cooperrider have proposed the following:  ÒBiodiversity is the variety of life and its processes.  It includes the variety of living organisms, the genetic differences among them, the communities and ecosystems in which they occur, and the ecological and evolutionary process that keep them functioning, yet ever changing and adaptingÓ (Noss and Cooperrider 1994).  This definition demonstrates how complicated the concept of biodiversity is, and it includes the frequently ignored, but vitally important evolutionary context of biodiversity.
<p>In addition to the standard approach using the genetic, species and ecosystem levels of biodiversity, it has been suggested that landscape diversity also be taken into consideration. According to Noss and Cooperrider (1994) ÒLandscape or regional diversity is pattern diversity - the pattern of habitats and species assemblages across a land area of thousands of millions of acres - and can be considered a higher level expression of biodiversity.Ó  Only by considering the landscape level in biodiversity conservation can we ensure the maintenance of large scale phenomena such as dispersal of wide ranging vertebrates, seed dispersal, pollination, natural fire regimes and other processes.
<p>For a variety of reasons, including climate and periods of major disturbance such as glaciation, biodiversity tends to increase from the poles towards the equator.  For example, Ontario supports approximately 290 species of breeding birds (Cadman et al. 1987), while Columbia, which is only slightly larger in size, supports some 1,395 species (Forsyth 1990).  By far the ecosystems that feature the highest degree of species richness are tropical rain forests, which contain well over 50 percent of all plants and animals on Earth (Collins 1990).
<p>Because the natural and perhaps optimum diversity of any given area is that which has evolved and adapted to local conditions, even areas with relatively low native biodiversity may be valuable if that is what is most suited to the site.  As in any ecosystem, removal of species or genetic variability by unnatural means may place the integrity of the whole system at risk.  
<p>
Is There a Biodiversity Crisis?
<br>The short answer to this question is Òyes.Ó  Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson estimates that in tropical rain forests alone the rate of loss of whole species (not merely genetic varieties or subspecies) is now a minimum of 27,000 per year, or three per hour, and the rate is increasing.  This is believed to be at least 1000 times the ordinary ÒbackgroundÓ rate of extinction (Wilson 1992).  There is little doubt then, that we are slipping into a great extinction that may well rival that which resulted in the demise of the dinosaurs some 65 million years ago (see Figure 1.1).  Virtually all of this destruction is ultimately due to the activities of an ever-expanding human population.	
<p>There are many individual factors contributing to the biodiversity crisis, including such major environmental problems as climate change, pollution and use of pesticides.  Use of wildlife products and collecting of rare plants and animals can also have serious impacts.  The single most important contributing factor in the biodiversity crisis is habitat loss, which effects all three of the principal levels of biodiversity.  Today, along with the reduction in overall fitness resulting from population decline in some species and the complete demise of others, entire ecosystem types are being threatened or destroyed.

<P>Biodiversity Loss in Canada
<br>A country as large as Canada is certain to feature considerable landscape diversity, and indeed Canada has been variously divided into over 400 terrestrial and marine natural regions. According to World Wildlife Fund CanadaÕs Endangered Spaces campaign, only about 5% of these regions are well represented in protected areas, while some 55% have no representation whatsoever (WWF 1995).  Given the small human population and the huge land mass in Canada, this amounts to a rather poor conservation record, and it is no surprise that biodiversity is threatened in many regions.
<P>Canada features some 1,800 species of vertebrates and about 3,300 plant species (Burnett et al. 1989).  Of these, some 244 species are currently listed as endangered, threatened, or vulnerable (Environment Canada, Canadian Wildlife Service 1995).  Unfortunately, the areas with highest species diversity also tend to be the areas with the best climate conditions for agriculture and human settlement.  Thus, in Canada as in many areas, the principal threat to biodiversity has been the destruction of natural habitat.
<P>Causes of habitat loss are many, but in Canada it has been primarily agriculture, forestry, and urbanization that have had the greatest impacts (Biodiversity Science Assessment Team, 1994). Each of these will be discussed briefly below.

<P>Agriculture
<br>Since the early arrival of Europeans, settlement of North America has involved converting natural ecosystems - particularly forests, prairies and wetlands - to agriculture.  In short, complex self-sustaining ecosystems supporting a great diversity of species have been transformed into high yield monocultures requiring substantial inputs of fertilizers and pesticides which themselves have an impact on biodiversity (Mineau and McLaughlin 1994). Agriculture has also resulted in the fragmentation of habitat, especially forests.  This major concern of conservation biology will be discussed in Part 2.
<P>Forestry
<BR>Unsustainable forestry practices can also be detrimental to biodiversity conservation goals.  While some foresters have argued that clearcuts create edge habitat that increases diversity, species requiring large expanses of forest can be negatively impacted by the fragmentation of remaining forest blocks (Noss and Cooperrider 1994).  The common practice of cutting forests before an old growth stage is reached results in a shortage of dead wood in the form of standing snags and fallen logs.  Many species depend on these for food, shelter, or nest sites (Hunter 1990).  Also, the heavy use of pesticides to control insect infestations may have a negative impact on other species.  Finally, artificial replanting with a narrow range of genetic stock from other areas represents a loss of diversity that could have a negative impact on forest fitness (Middleton 1994a).  Plantations of a few high yield species also represent a loss of biological diversity (Hammond 1991).
<P>Urbanization
<br>Urbanization is a process that involves converting landscapes into habitat for high densities of one species - Homo sapiens. This represents a substantial loss of biodiversity.  In some regions cities and towns cover a considerable portion of threatened bioregions such as the deciduous forest zone of southern Ontario (Middleton 1994b).  While remnants of significant ecosystems remain in some urban areas (where there may be strong public support for protection), natural areas in cities are often built over or replaced by manicured lawns and gardens featuring ornamental species that can be of limited value to wildlife.  As human populations grow, the conversion of natural habitat and agricultural land to urban areas is increasing rapidly.  Those non-human species that can survive in settled landscapes are those that are most tolerant of disturbance - in many cases exotic species that have been introduced either inadvertently or deliberately during the process of colonization.  Fortunately, people have begun to show an interest in modifying urban habitat so that it might benefit other species as well.
<P>In summary, changes in the landscape resulting from agriculture, forestry and urbanization have an impact on patterns of biodiversity.  Overall, ecosystem diversity and species richness tend to be reduced.  Invasive exotics and human-tolerant native species thrive, while those that are sensitive to disturbance disappear.  It is the latter that are of greatest concern to those involved in the conservation of biodiversity.
<P>
<A name = b>b.  BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION
<P>
What is Conservation Biology?
<br>Conservation biology is a relatively new science devoted to the conservation of biological diversity.  Conservation biology is of necessity multidisciplinary (Primack 1993, Noss and Cooperrider 1994) in recognition of the need to involve many professional fields if success at so daunting a task is to be assured.  These include ecology, biology, genetics, anthropology, philosophy, and economics among others.
<P>Conservation biology works in both ex situ and in situ  contexts.  That is, conservation of biodiversity can in part take place through gene banks and captive breeding of species in zoos, but the goal is best served through protection of natural areas, their component species, and the ecological and evolutionary processes occurring there.  This requires a landscape approach, and it is here that the disciplines of conservation biology and landscape ecology come together.  Landscape ecology has been defined as Òthe study of the structure, function, and change in a heterogeneous land area composed of interacting systemsÓ (Forman and Godron 1986).  A review of some of the basic issues and concerns of these two disciplines in relation to the impacts of humans on biodiversity will be useful to introduce some of the issues that can be addressed through restoration work.

<P>Population Viability
<br>To help comprehend the impact of landscape manipulation by humans on biodiversity, it is important to introduce the issue of population viability.  Obviously, the greater the population of a species, the lower the risk of extinction.  As populations decrease the risk increases as a result of several factors.  For example, low populations have a greater vulnerability to disease or environmental catastrophes.  These can eliminate many individuals and isolate others.  The demographic make up of small populations can also have a profound impact on long-term survival.  In this case, large mammals that produce only one or two young every few years might be at risk if the population contains low numbers of females of breeding age.  Reduction of a population below a certain level may also have negative impacts on species with elaborate social structures and behavioral patterns, possibly preventing breeding (Wilcove 1987).
<P>The concept of the minimum viable population (MVP) was introduced in response to the above risks to populations, and emphasizes the role of genetic variability in relation to species survival (Shaffer 1981, Gilpin and Soule 1986).  All individuals of each species carry inherited genetic information that will help determine their ability to survive within a changing environment. Much of this information varies from one individual to another.  In general, the greater the size of the population of any given species and the space it occupies, the greater will be the overall diversity of information.  As populations are reduced, the corresponding lack of genetic diversity may ultimately compromise the ability of the species to survive under local conditions.  This reduction in fitness reaches an extreme when populations are reduced to such an extent that inbreeding depression occurs (Primack 1993).
<P>From a conservation perspective, larger populations are the best means of maintaining genetic diversity and ensuring the survival of most species.  But exactly how big must a population be for the species to survive in a given area and to continue to be viable indefinitely?  The answer varies from one species to another, and from plants, to invertebrates, to vertebrates. However, conservation biologists predict that in order to prevent inbreeding depression and to maintain enough genetic variation for the species to survive and evolve, a MVP for vertebrates would be 500 to 1000 individuals or more (Lande 1988).  Anything less could result in extinction over the course of several generations.
<P>Reduced availability of habitat leads to a decrease in population size.  Degrading or eliminating natural areas can therefore have a negative impact on population viability.

<P>Habitat Fragmentation
<br>The theory of island biogeography (see text box) implies that parks and reserves are not in themselves sufficient to conserve biodiversity.  If this is the case then the role of natural areas outside of parks becomes increasingly important.  In Canada, large wilderness areas still exist to fill this role in some regions.  Unfortunately, the areas that are most biologically diverse tend to be settled first leaving only remnant natural areas.  A flight over southwestern Ontario for example, reveals that only small patches remain of the extensive forested areas that existed before European settlers arrived (Pearce 1993).  While this is a particularly severe case, the situation is much the same wherever intensive agriculture and urban areas exist.  Such fragments of habitat are also subject to the problems associated with island biogeography because of their isolation within the landscape.  In fact, habitat fragmentation - and in particular forest fragmentation - has become a major issue in conservation biology.
<P>There are other impacts and processes resulting from fragmentation that have serious consequences for biodiversity.  One of these is the dispersal capability of organisms within a fragment. Many small vertebrates are reluctant to cross open fields between forest patches because of the threat of predation by birds of prey, coyotes, foxes etc.  For instance, a study in eastern Ontario indicated that white-footed mice, chipmunks and most birds preferred to move along fencerows rather than cross open fields (Wegner and Merriam 1979).  For a number of reasons dispersal is necessary for the survival of most populations.  Trapped in small fragments, a species may suffer from a shortage of food or shelter. Escape from external threats may also be impossible.  Finally, finding a suitable breeding partner may not be feasible under such conditions, or inbreeding may occur, ultimately lowering the fitness of the population.  

<P>Edge Effects
<br>Perhaps the most insidious problems related to fragmentation are those referred to as Òedge effects.Ó  When an area of continuous forest is dissected by roads, railroads, utility corridors, drainage ditches etc., an unnatural edge is created where one previously did not exist.  A forest that becomes completely isolated by surrounding agriculture or urbanization has such edges on all sides.
<P>From a mathematical perspective, long, narrow habitat fragments have more of an edge than do compact blocks of habitat with rounded borders.  Of all possible shapes, the circle offers the lowest edge to exterior ratio since edge effects can penetrate 100m or more into forest fragments, large blocks are required to maintain core areas with habitat suitable for forest interior species (see Figure 1.2).
<P>An isolated patch of forest is subject to a whole series of environmental perturbations.  Exposure to high winds is one example.  Small patches are highly susceptible to disproportionately high amounts of storm damage such as fallen trees.  High winds may also destroy bird nests in the understorey.  In smaller fragments continuous penetration of the forest edge by wind can create a drier interior environment.  This in turn may change vegetation patterns and discourage some animal species.  Generally speaking, the impact zone for any known edge effects within a given habitat is all considered to be Òedge.Ó
<P>The issue of edge habitats in relation to biodiversity is somewhat of a paradox.  Generally speaking, edges tend to support more species than interior habitats, in part because they combine a variety of physical and biological conditions.  This in turn may result in a more elaborate vegetation structure, providing a greater diversity of habitats and promoting interspersion between these (Noss 1994).  Thus, a forest edge for example, will have wildlife species of the forest itself, the adjacent landscape, and opportunistic species that are generally associated with edges because they can make use of several habitats.  For this reason edge habitat has historically been encouraged in wildlife management (Leopold 1933, Smith 1980).  Under natural conditions such as riparian areas in prairie landscapes, or natural openings in forests, edges are both important components of landscape diversity and help to maintain a greater species diversity at a regional scale.
<P>The problem arises with respect to how much edge habitat exists in relation to interior habitat.  Under natural conditions an unbroken forest is composed primarily of interior habitat, with occasional treefalls or water bodies creating isolated edges.  Many species are dependent on the relatively darker, cooler, more humid interior forest conditions.  When forest dominated landscapes are converted to agriculture or urban dominated landscapes, remaining fragments may not only be too small to support populations of interior species, the ratio between interior and edge may favor species that prefer the latter.  Thus, although diversity of common species remains high because of the amount of edge habitat, populations of uncommon forest interior species may be greatly reduced, resulting in a conservation concern.
<P>Another conservation concern is the increase in invasions of habitat fragments by exotic species.  Seeds of alien plants may be windborn or transported by mammal and bird species as they move from exterior to interior habitats.  While these invasions can temporarily increase the species diversity of a site, in time they may overwhelm the native vegetation to the point where overall species diversity becomes greatly diminished.
<P>The White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is not an exotic species, however it too is having a negative impact on biodiversity in many eastern forest fragments.  This species thrives in edge habitats because of the abundant browsing material. Unfortunately, deer also take shelter in forest fragments, and browse on interior vegetation species.  Ordinarily this would not be a problem.  However, where natural predators have been eliminated by humans in settled landscapes, deer populations can become artificially elevated.  Heavy browsing not only reduces vegetation diversity, it changes the structure of woodlands, removing much of the understorey that is the habitat of many bird species (Alverson et al. 1988, Miller et al. 1992).
<P>One of the most publicized conservation concerns related to habitat fragmentation and edge effects is the issue of disappearing migratory songbirds in eastern North America.  Observations at bird monitoring facilities such as the Long Point Bird Observatory on Lake Erie indicate persistent declines in the populations of numerous species over the past few decades.  There has been much speculation about the extent and causes of the declines (see Terborgh 1989, Askins et al. 1990 and Towle 1994 for overviews). Factors that have been implicated include pesticide use, air pollution, increased urbanization, tropical deforestation in the wintering grounds, forest fragmentation on the breeding grounds, and general loss of habitat on the migratory route.  That birds specific to a variety of habitat types are affected suggests that a combination of factors may be involved in most cases.  Nevertheless, fragmentation and the associated edge effects are thought to play a major role in the precipitous declines of forest interior species such as the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) and the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) which require large blocks of habitat for breeding.
<P>Increased rates of predation and parasitism (see text box on Brown-headed Cowbird) are two of the edge effects most associated with songbird decline (Wilcove 1985, Terborgh 1989).  Agricultural land surrounding forest fragments has resulted in inflated populations of omnivorous or opportunistic species.  These include mammals such as Coyote (Canis latrans), foxes, Raccoon (Procyon lotor), skunks, oppossoms, squirrels, chipmunks, and birds such as American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), and Blue Jay (Cyanocitta cristata).  All of these may supplement their diet with eggs or young of songbirds .
<P>The decline of neotropical migrant songbird populations is a conservation concern that can act as a flagship to draw our attention to a whole range of environmental problems.  Of these, habitat fragmentation in particular has been called Òthe most serious threat to biological diversityÓ and Òthe primary cause of the present extinction crisisÓ (Wilcox and Murphy 1985).

<P>Conservation Needs
<br>This section has presented the impacts of ecosystem fragmentation on biodiversity within a landscape framework.  By now it should be clear that large blocks of habitat and connecting links will be required if we wish to maintain the full complement of biodiversity within CanadaÕs natural regions, and to ensure the long-term functioning and integrity of these.
<P>If anthropogenic extinctions may be inevitable under present circumstances, and our parks and reserves may not be entirely adequate for biodiversity conservation, then what are the alternatives?  Clearly, a different approach to land use planning will be required - one through which the needs of other species and the goal of ecosystem integrity will be addressed.
<P>It is now widely acknowledged by conservation biologists that, in order to maintain biodiversity at the national level, an adequate network of protected areas is necessary.  These may then serve as protected core areas within the broader landscape matrix. This is essentially the goal of World Wildlife Fund CanadaÕs Endangered Spaces program.  A document developed for WWF by Noss (1995) has provided an excellent overview of how to work towards the goal of preserving ecosystem diversity and integrity through reserve networks (Noss 1995), while another reviews the methodologies involved in choosing representative sites (Iacobelli et al. 1995).  However, since we have already concluded that parks and reserves alone will not suffice, the real success of our biodiversity conservation efforts will be measured by our ability to conserve the integrity of ecosystems outside of reserve boundaries.
<P>On crown land with substantial natural areas, this will involve incorporating the goal of biodiversity conservation into development planning.  The goal is already being pursued at the national and provincial levels in accordance with CanadaÕs National Biodiversity Strategy (Biodiversity Working Group 1995) and the international agreements signed at the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro in 1992.  The success of this approach will no doubt be based on the availability of adequate funding and a balance between government commitment, corporate compliance, and public scrutiny.
<P>On private lands, biodiversity conservation will be a greater challenge, for it is here that the most degraded areas - those converted to agriculture and urban development - may be found.  A number of landowner stewardship options are available for private individuals who are concerned about conservation.  These include land trusts, conservation easements etc. (see Frombetti and Cox 1990 and Hilts and Reid 1993).  However, the focus of these has mainly been restricted to the protection of significant remnant areas, most of which are disconnected.  The next step must be to identify potential to expand the size of these areas, as well as (if appropriate) to create linkages between them.  This is perhaps where restoration work can achieve its greatest potential for biodiversity conservation, while inherently involving the public in the process.

<h3><A name = a>Part 2 - RESTORATION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION</a></h3>

"There can be no purpose more inspiriting than to begin the age of restoration, re-weaving the wondrous diversity of life that still surrounds us."
<br>- Edward O. Wilson
<P>
<P>Some Misconceptions and Dilemmas
<br>As might by surmised from the review of conservation biology in the previous section, "helping" biodiversity and attracting wildlife are not necessarily the same.  Given that the distinction is seldom considered, this topic is worthy of some clarification before proceeding with a more detailed discussion about the potential effects of restoration work on biodiversity.
<P>The idea of planting trees, shrubs or wildflowers to attract wildlife is not a new one.  Nevertheless these activities have expanded dramatically along with a growing environmental awareness on the part of the general public.  Usually a specific wildlife goal is sought through such projects.  For example, one might plant specific trees or shrubs to attract birds, or plant a Òbutterfly gardenÓ of wildflowers.  There are now dozens of books on the market promoting planting for wildlife, many of which do not discriminate between using native and non-native species.
<P>Goals in attracting wildlife generally reflect personal preferences and prejudices, and the desired species usually are the more charismatic ones.  It is unlikely that many would plant to deliberately attract spiders, snakes, skunks, etc.  In urban areas there may be practical reasons for choosing what to attract and what to discourage.  Raccoons might be undesirable because of their tendency to eat garbage, or worse, their potential as vectors for rabies.  Certain wildflowers and other plants such as poison ivy might be considered noxious weeds.
<P>There are a number of potential problems with this approach that help to distinguish between attracting wildlife and ÒhelpingÓ biodiversity.  Fundamentally, it is important to recognize that the attraction of some wildlife species for their aesthetic qualities may actually have negative impacts on biodiversity.  For instance, blue jays are beautiful birds that many would consider welcome. Chipmunks too, are often encouraged.  Yet for many it may come as a surprise to learn that these species will not hesitate to supplement their diet with the eggs and young of songbirds.  The presence of those songbird species experiencing population declines could therefore be put at risk by this activity. In short, planting based on personal preferences does not automatically benefit biodiversity.
<P>There are moral dilemmas involved with the issue of planting for wildlife or biodiversity as well.  While not everyone plants to encourage particular species, when a site is manipulated with this goal in mind its status as ÒnaturalÓ comes into question.  Can we legitimately say we are attracting nature, or is this in fact a form of gardening?  Have we attracted ÒwildÓ life or ÒwilledÓ life?
<P>Some serious biological implications of planting habitat need to be considered as well.  Attracting desired species of wildlife is a form of management, and it may be argued that managed nature is quite different from wild nature.  Given that genetic diversity and natural selection - the evolutionary process - occurs in nature under wild (unmanaged) conditions, such manipulation may ultimately work against biodiversity.  This should be a concern even for professional restorationists.  In essence there is a potential contradiction in the idea of managing nature for biodiversity (Towle, 1996).

<P><A name= how>How Restoration Can Have an Impact on Biodiversity
<br>From the moment a shovel lifts the soil, restoration work has an impact on biodiversity.  The planting of vegetation can represent a profound change in the biodiversity of the site, both actual and potential.  As should be obvious from the discussion above, this impact can be beneficial, benign or even detrimental. What follows is a detailed review of such impacts on all three levels of biodiversity, while recognizing that considerable overlap exists between these levels.  The objective is twofold:  1) to provide a deeper understanding of challenges facing conservation biologists, and  2) to ensure that restoration efforts do indeed have a positive effect on biodiversity.
<P>It should be noted that "true" restoration of degraded landscapes would automatically benefit biodiversity.  Nevertheless, in this section the term is used in recognition that it is often loosely applied to a variety of rehabilitation approaches.
<P>
1) Ecosystem Diversity

<OL>
	<LI> Basic Issues<P>

	Although in extreme situations conservation efforts are needed to address the species and genetic levels of biodiversity, a focus on the ecosystem level tends to be the most effective approach. This is because the continued existence of the various system types helps to ensure the presence of component species, and if the areas are large enough, adequate genetic diversity within these.  While genetic and species concerns can and should be important for restoration, most often it is ecosystems that are to be enhanced or restored.  An understanding of the basic ecology of the system in question is therefore essential in order to make sound decisions about restoration objectives and methodologies.
	<P>According to Odum (1983) "Any unit (a biosystem) that includes all the organisms that function together (the biotic community) in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined biotic structures and cycling of materials between living and nonliving parts is an ecological system or ecosystem."  The term "Ecosystem" is often used rather loosely to describe everything from isolated natural features such as ponds or meadows, to entire bioregions or even the biosphere itself.  The boundaries of ecosystems are difficult to define because they are always connected to other landscape features, and many species move freely between ecosystem types.
	<P>Ecosystems are a reflection of prevailing and local climatic conditions and soil types.  The plant species characteristic of any given system tend to be those which are best adapted to the local conditions, and which have had the dispersal capacity to colonize.
	<P>Each bioregion features a characteristic major vegetation type that is composed of a mosaic of different habitats.  In forests for example, lowlands and uplands or south-facing versus north-facing slopes all have microclimates that support different tree species. A contiguous forest may also include swamp or meadow habitats. Similarly, prairies contain patches of scrubland or trees around the perimeter and river valleys with riparian habitat.  In mountainous areas vegetation zones change according to elevation and the direction of the slope.  Such varying patterns of ecosystem diversity across the landscape represent a major contribution to biodiversity.
	<P>Habitat loss or fragmentation reduces this diversity.  In addition, specific ecosystem types such as wetlands have often been targeted for destruction due to human prejudices.  These, along with the species that depend on them, may be under-represented at the regional level.  Ecosystem supply analysis (a process of ensuring that we maintain sufficient supplies of these ecosystem types and their various successional stages throughout the landscape) could be a useful tool for maintaining ecosystem diversity (Hounsell 1994).
	<P><LI> Positive Potential of Restoration
	<P>There are two principle approaches by which the conservation of ecosystem diversity can be addressed through restoration projects.  First, under ideal circumstances groups would identify and restore threatened ecosystem types at the regional level.  This would involve either the re-establishment of these habitats where they once existed, or construction of them on degraded sites where they could exist.  Local environmental organizations, naturalist groups, or government natural resource departments are usually well aware of what ecosystem types are threatened in their area and could help in setting priorities.
	<P>What makes this approach a challenge is the fact that such systems have usually become threatened in the first place through the actions of private landowners.  Forests have been cleared, wetlands have been drained and prairies have been converted to agriculture or urbanization.  In short, the availability of sites may be limited.
	<P>Nevertheless, the crucial role that private property owners can play in biodiversity conservation is now widely recognized (Grumbine 1992, Riley and Mohr 1994) and many significant natural areas have been protected via land trusts and other legal devices (see for example Trombetti and Cox 1990, Hilts and Reid 1993). Sympathetic land owners can also be approached about providing restoration opportunities, especially in areas where large amounts of land have been taken out of production.  It may even be possible to convince some land developers to include the preservation or reconstruction of threatened ecosystems such as wetlands as part of their plans.  On agricultural lands, windbreaks planted with a diversity of indigenous trees, or planted buffers around streams have the potential to improve productivity and reduce erosion.
	<P>A second and less direct approach to the conservation of ecosystem diversity through restoration involves simply finding a degraded area within the community (including oneÕs own property) and deciding to improve the site.  This can be useful in both rural and urban contexts.  While not actually replacing a rare ecosystem type at the regional level, such efforts can conceivably contribute to local ecosystem diversity or, if undertaken carefully, the increased viability of existing natural areas.  For example, planting around an existing site can buffer against negative environmental impacts, reduce or soften edge habitat, and expand the size of the overall area.
	<P><LI> Negative Potential of Restoration
	<P>At the ecosystem level, the potential hazards associated with restoration may be limited to two main problem areas: 
		<OL>
		<LI>	  the risk of displacing an existing significant ecosystem; and 
		<LI>	   the planting of an inappropriate system for the site in question.
		</OL>
	<P>The first possibility demonstrates the importance of reviewing existing literature, speaking with persons familiar with the site, or undertaking a baseline biological inventory as part of the restoration process.  Unless it is obvious that the site is severely degraded, these should precede any project that might involve disruption within or adjacent to an existing natural area. In short, no action should be considered under such conditions without advice from professional field biologists, unless the restoration is limited to removal of debris or invasive exotic vegetation species.  Even unattractive or degraded sites can support threatened or significant species.
	<P>Planting inappropriate vegetation at a site is perhaps more of an economical hazard than an ecological one.  If the species planted are not adapted to existing site conditions their survival will be jeopardized.  Given the limited resources available for biodiversity conservation, such wasted efforts must be avoided.  In cases of uncertainty it is best to plant naturally occurring pioneer species that may eventually provide enough cover for other species to colonize the site at a later date.
	<P>With respect to limited available funding it should be recognized that some degraded areas might better be left to regenerate on their own, and may do so quite rapidly.  Such areas may already be undergoing ecological succession, or have optimum conditions such as good soils and nearby seed sources.  Resources may then be allocated to sites identified as having a higher priority.  Professional guidance from an ecologist or forester may help to identify such priorities.

2) Species Diversity
<OL>
<P><LI> Basic Issues
<BR>Because species diversity and ecosystem diversity are interdependent, some repetition is inevitable in any attempt to discuss them as separate concepts within the context of restoration.  For example, the most obvious outward features of ecosystems are the species of which they are composed, in particular the dominant vegetation types.  Thus to a great extent the nature of any given ecosystem is based on those species which share the capacity to deal with existing physical and climatic factors and the capability to colonize the area.
<P>The issues of succession and vegetation structure demonstrate this close association between ecosystem and species diversity, and for this reason they will be dealt with first in this section.  A discussion of other biodiversity conservation issues that deal more directly with the species level will then follow.
<P>Ecosystems are dynamic by nature.  As they undergo the process of succession their species composition changes.  If we take forests as an example, a young, early successional forest will support very different species than will an old growth forest.  Yet all are characteristic of that particular forest type (be it temperate rainforest, boreal forest, temperate mixed forest etc.). The forest ecosystem is not merely what stands before our eyes here and now.  It is the full range of successional stages and the characteristic species of each of these as expressed through time and space.  Each ecosystem then, has an actual and potential species diversity.
<P>The implication for restoration work is that if the job is to be done well, the process of succession must be given consideration.  The species targeted should be those that are characteristic of a given seral stage.  In other words, an attempt to attract as many species associated with that ecosystem as possible would be inappropriate.  Rather, one should decide on the level of succession to be addressed by the restoration effort and plant vegetation accordingly.  Ultimately, the wildlife species that appear on their own will likely be those most suited for the restored site.  In short, the diversity of species should be determined more by local conditions than by human preferences.
<P>Determining the ideal level of succession to aim for may be difficult.  Our rudimentary knowledge of ecosystem dynamics and the fact that restoration ecology is as yet a young science have so far meant that most projects are carried out on a trial and error basis.  Certainly, what works for one ecosystem type may not work for another.  Even for the same ecosystem type, local soil and climate conditions may require different approaches.  Again, it is safer to commence with early successional plant species.  These ÒpioneersÓ are adapted to the rough conditions typical of disturbed areas.  If a suitable source exists nearby, late successional species may eventually seed in on their own.
<P>When a site is restored, selection pressures are applied to planted vegetation by physical and climatic conditions and natural ecological associations.  Although one may plant with a specific goal in mind such as establishing a threatened ecosystem or attracting target species, in the long run the vegetation community that survives on the site - whether or not it is intentional - will determine the degree of success.  This is why it is important to take issues of site suitability and succession stage into consideration for the survival of planted vegetation.  These must be considered not only to ensure the most efficient use of resources, but to determine the ultimate effectiveness of a project in addressing biodiversity conservation goals.
<P>The issue of vegetation structure also demonstrates the close relationship between ecosystem and species diversity.  What is referred to can include both vertical and horizontal structure of vegetation within an ecosystem.
<P>Vertical structure is most obvious in forests.  Here the canopy, understorey and herbaceous ground cover tend to be distinct layers of vegetation.  While this in itself is an expression of vegetation diversity, the real importance of vertical structure for biodiversity is in the provision of niches for many species.  Birds are an excellent example in this respect.  Studies of foraging behaviour have demonstrated resource partitioning through the use of different vegetation layers (MacArthur 1958, Morse 1989).  This not only reduces competition, in the long term it may promote speciation.  Birds also tend to choose specific vegetation layers for nesting.  

<P>"Healing is the dominant metaphor in ecological restoration."<BR>
- Stephen Mills
<P>Concern about horizontal structure within the context of restoration is based primarily on vegetation associations.  In addition to determining what species are most suited to local conditions, the characteristic associations between these should also be considered.  It may be more appropriate to plant stands of some tree species such as cedars, birches, aspens, sumach, etc. Observing and attempting to mimic similar sites in nearby natural areas may help in this respect.  Some species may even be allelopathic, making it difficult for others to become established in close proximity to them.
<P>Basic concerns that are more or less exclusive to the species level of biodiversity include threatened species and exotic species.  The former topic is well documented and too complex to deal with here, although it will be considered below with respect to how restoration may make a contribution.
<P>The presence of exotic species represents a serious challenge for restoration ecologists on both philosophical and ecological levels.  According to Noss and Cooperrider (1994) exotic (or alien) species are Òspecies that occur in a given place, area, or region as a result of direct or indirect, deliberate or accidental introduction of the species by humans, and for which introduction has permitted the species to cross a natural barrier to dispersal.Ó Exotics include both animal and plant species.  They can be divided into two principal categories: those which are invasive, and those which are not.
<P>Even non-invasive exotics are scorned by some restorationists, in part perhaps because their mere presence represents a fundamental challenge to the idea of restoration.  To such purists, restoration means recreating an ecosystem composed entirely of indigenous species, usually one that presumably existed prior to the arrival of the supreme invasive exotic, the European colonist. Given the difficulty in their removal, others tend to accept the presence of a few exotic plants within a natural area.  In some cases non-invasive exotic vegetation may even be used as part of the restoration process for their ability to treat soils, prevent erosion, attract wildlife etc.  However, few would consider the deliberate planting of long-lived exotics as a legitimate part of true restoration.
<P>Invasive exotics, by contrast, can be a serious hazard to ecosystems and are receiving increased recognition as a serious threat to biodiversity at the global scale.  The invasion of wetlands across much of North America by Purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) and the resulting decrease in diversity of other species is one of the best known examples (White et al. 1993), and there are many, many others.  Indeed, some 28% of the vascular plant species now found in Canada are exotic (Middleton and McLaughlin 1994).
<P>Exotic animals can also pose serious problems.  The European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) is a well known example.  It was introduced to North America in 1890, and quickly spread across the continent.  The birdÕs aggressive nature has allowed it to successfully displace native cavity nesting species such as the Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) and the Eastern Bluebird (Sialia sialis) (Ehrlich et al. 1992, Terborgh 1989). Feral cats, dogs and livestock such as pigs can also have severe impacts on ecosystems and their component species.
<P>Aquatic ecosystems face similar threats.  The Great Lakes Basin now contains numerous exotic fish species, including the parasitic Sea Lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), which attacks species of commercial value, and Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio), which can be very disruptive of shoreline vegetation (Ashworth 1986). Invertebrates such as the highly invasive Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorhpa) can also cause severe problems (Primack 1993).  
<P>While the introduction of an alien species represents an immediate increase in species richness, invasive exotics can ultimately lead to a decrease in diversity as they displace native species (Saur 1992).  It is likely that invasions of alien species place considerable stress on native ecosystems as they struggle to adjust to the new conditions.  In some natural areas, especially those adjacent to the highly disturbed environments where exotics flourish, this stress can be acute.
<P>Ultimately, the degree to which the presence of alien species is to be tolerated is a decision for the manager.  The tendency of exotic vegetation to invade disturbed areas suggests that returning an ecosystem to health through restoration may itself eliminate much of the problem (Haney 1993, Primack 1993).  For example, shade-intolerant invasives may eventually die out as indigenous vegetation matures.

<P><LI> Positive Potential of Restoration
<BR>Restoration can encompass more than merely planting vegetation; it can include action to ensure the survival of existing natural areas and their component species.  Removal of exotic species from such habitats, especially those that are invasive, can be as important as restoring a degraded area by planting.  Indeed, this alternative should receive more attention from citizen groups interested in restoration.  Local naturalist clubs or natural resource departments can be consulted to learn more about exotic species and their management in any given region.
<P>Habitat can be restored or managed for the benefit of legally designated threatened plants or animals.  In some cases, reintroduction of a rare species to a restored site may also be an option.  However, such projects are within the domain of experts only, and should not be attempted by the public unless they involve such expertise and are sanctioned by local authorities.
<P>Some species conservation concerns can be at least indirectly addressed by the public through the planting of trees and shrubs. One of these is the problem of declining songbirds discussed in Part 1.  Because the behaviour of birds is relatively well known, the food and shelter requirements of these species can be taken into consideration even in the most rudimentary community tree planting projects.  The additional effort required to improve the conservation value of sites in this manner is minimal, and the process can have great educational value (Towle 1994).  These efforts may be especially valuable in urban areas.
<P>Amphibian declines can also be addressed through restoration projects.  Wetland breeding areas can be identified and maintained through the management of concerned citizens (Gosselin and Johnson 1995).  Where these are severely degraded they may be enhanced, or in cases where they have been completely eliminated, they can be reconstructed (Hough et al. 1995, Kusler and Kentula 1990, Payne 1992). 
<P>The particular needs of species can be incorporated into the restoration process in other ways as well.  For example, bird boxes can provide breeding opportunities for cavity nesting species, including those which have suffered population declines such as the Eastern Bluebird.  These are especially useful in early successional habitats where the older growth that may normally provide standing dead trees (snags) is absent.  Snags themselves can be imported and erected at the site, or can be created by girdling mature trees (preferably exotic species).  Such standing dead wood is also important as roosting habitat, and may attract birds of prey such as hawks.
<P>Management techniques can also be used to invite previously maligned creatures to restored sites.  Bat boxes, for instance, have become increasingly popular in part because bats can help control insect pests at a site.  This may be especially useful around wetlands where the presence of mosquitoes could otherwise reduce public support for a restoration project.  Snakes can also be encouraged to a site through the construction of winter denning sites or hibernacula.  Such techniques are reviewed by Payne (1992) and Payne and Bryant (1994).  Local naturalist groups can be consulted about the degree to which these could be useful for species conservation.

<P><LI>Negative Potential of Restoration
<BR>It was mentioned above that when working with a site that already supports a natural community, as much information as possible should be gathered about the existing species diversity before proceeding with any potentially disruptive restoration activity.  Although it may be unlikely in heavily disturbed areas, there is a possibility that activities could harm a threatened species of vegetation or to disrupt the habitat of other significant wildlife.
<P>Plantings can have negative impacts on biodiversity at the species level when we use vegetation or encourage animals that can cause problems for native species in nearby natural areas.  For instance, planting invasive exotics such as Common Buckthorn or Autumn Olive (Elaeagnus umbellata) (just two among many) to provide fruit for birds could result in the expansion of these shrubs into local forests.  Here these aggressive species can reduce indigenous vegetation diversity by shading and their high rate of seed production.
<P>Working under the misconception that more species diversity is better, some groups have promoted the deliberate planting of edge habitat to attract as wide a variety of wildlife as possible.  From a conservation perspective this trend is disturbing.  As discussed in Part 2, the presence of a high species richness at a given site is not necessarily natural or desirable.  Furthermore, the landscape in any settled area already contains much more edge habitat than is likely to occur under natural conditions. Therefore, creating more edge is unlikely to contribute to biodiversity conservation goals.  Indeed, it may even work against such goals.
<P>The issue of edge effects in relation to species diversity has already been discussed in detail.  While it is important to distinguish between forest edge and isolated plantings of edge habitat, it remains a concern that certain species associated with edges can be undesirable.  Deliberate planting of edge habitat may encourage these species, conceivably increasing the negative impacts on nearby natural areas where they occur.  While recognizing that in the case of small-scale community naturalization projects it may be impossible to plant anything but edge, it may nevertheless be irresponsible to deliberately encourage people to do so under the guise of Òhelping biodiversity.Ó
<P>A final concern related to restoration and species diversity is the planting of vegetation species outside of their natural range.  This can happen when people confuse what is a native species according to political borders with what is indigenous to a bioregion.  Because a species is considered native to Canada does not imply that it can or should be grown anywhere in the country. Even within a bioregion, species have restricted ranges.
<P>Whether or not a species planted outside of its natural range will survive depends on the genotype of the individual, the local climate and soil conditions, the presence of predators or pathogens etc.  If the plant does manage to survive and reproduce, then provided it does not displace other vegetation or wildlife, we have essentially increased local species diversity.  Yet we have also altered the nature of the ecosystem.  Aside from the obvious moral dilemmas associated with such an action, we should be aware that our limited understanding of the dynamics of these systems means that we may not be capable of predicting the impacts of an introduction, some of which could be negative.  It is safer to limit our focus to indigenous species that are known to occur locally.  Even then, there are genetic concerns that should be addressed.

3) Genetic Diversity
<OL>
	<LI> Basic Issues

<P>In the past, concerns related to genetic diversity have often been ignored by restorationists - especially those with a focus on public naturalization projects.  Yet it is here where some of the greatest potential harm to biodiversity can result from restoration work.  Although going into a detailed summary of genetics and conservation is well beyond the scope of this paper, it is nevertheless important to review a few key concepts that anyone interested in undertaking this kind of work should be aware of.  It should also be pointed out that the processes of genetic variation in relation to evolution and extinction are complex and poorly understood.  Exceptions to the norm are frequent.  From a conservation perspective this is all the more reason to proceed with caution.
<P>The conservation of species diversity is dependent on the degree of genetic diversity within each species (Woodruff 1989).  This variation is the result of mutation and the recombination of genes (Noss 1994).  Because genes can result in competitive advantages, genetic diversity at the individual and population levels ultimately determines the ability of the species to survive and adapt to environmental conditions.  This measure of fitness is fundamental to the process of natural selection, and ultimately to evolution.  In theory then, higher genetic diversity offers more opportunities for survival, and vice versa (Ledig 1986, Cockburn 1991).
<P>Under natural conditions a degree of genetic diversity is retained as populations of a species interact over time and space. This is referred to as the gene flow.  When viable populations become isolated for long periods, adaptations to local conditions can eventually result in speciation (Primack 1993).  This process, known as adaptive radiation, contributes to an overall increase in species diversity.
<P>Yet when only small populations are involved, isolation can reduce genetic diversity and eventually species diversity as well. In such cases diminished gene flow and the increased likelihood of inbreeding may lead to a reduction in overall fitness of the population, and the eventual risk of local extinction.  Thus are revealed the mechanisms behind the theory of island biogeography and the potential legacy of habitat fragmentation.
<P>The mere presence of a species within a fragment then, does not automatically imply its long term survival.  Without a minimum viable population (see Part 1) and sufficient resources to support this, extinction may be inevitable unless individuals are recruited from other populations.
<P>The situation with plants may be quite different from animals. Here local adaptation may be extremely important.  For example, genetic variation in individuals of a species growing in one soil type or under micro-climatic conditions may be quite different from that of another population under different circumstances (Ambrose 1990, Knapp and Rice 1994).  This is of concern to the restorationist because the site to be restored may be markedly different in this respect from the site where plant seeds or stock were collected (Millar and Libby 1989).
<P>Interestingly, while a higher degree of genetic diversity is often assumed to be advantageous for long-term survival of a population, the dictum that Òmore is not necessarily betterÓ (discussed previously with respect to species diversity) may be true in this case as well.  For example, there is evidence that some plants and invertebrates may actually require a certain amount of inbreeding in order to maintain viability within very specific environments (Shields 1993).  In such cases outbreeding (the opposite of inbreeding) could be a problem.
<P>The idea that inbreeding could actually be desirable challenges an historical trend in evolutionary theory that was based on a bias towards highly mobile vertebrates in population viability studies.  As we shall see, it has profound implications for restoration work - particularly with respect to appropriate plant stock.

<P><LI> Positive Potential of Restoration
<P>The means by which restoration may directly promote the conservation of genetic diversity may be limited.  One possibility would be the enhancement or creation of habitat to support a threatened genotype, i.e. a localized population of rare plants or invertebrates.  Reintroductions of the genotype to a restored area could increase population size.
<P>Projects such as the above should not be attempted by the general public without professional supervision.  It may be more appropriate for citizens interested in restoration or naturalization to be aware of the potential dangers of these activities with respect to genetic diversity, and avoid negative impacts wherever possible.
<P>Perhaps the most significant role that restoration can play in the conservation of genetic diversity is to ensure that biodiversity goals ar met at the landscape level.  This approach would make a major contribution (albiet indirectly) by maintaining or restoring ecosystem integrity and providing the habitat linkages needed to ensure gene flow among populations.

<P><LI> Negative Potential of Restoration
<P>Based on the above discussion, an evident concern in this context is the possible disruption of significant genotypes by the construction, maintenance or improved access associated with restoration activities.  Among other things, such genotypes could include isolated populations of wildflower or grass species that differ substantially from distant populations in genetic make-up. Regard for biodiversity seldom focuses on such fine details unless a species is threatened.  Nevertheless, the fact that the loss of such isolated plant populations does contribute to the gradual deterioration of genetic diversity within the species as a whole should cause restorationists to weigh the benefits of their actions carefully.  A preliminary biological inventory of the site by qualified experts could eliminate this risk.
<P>The greatest concern with restoration and genetic diversity is the possible contamination of local stock through the introduction of foreign genetic material.  It may surprise and confuse people to learn that under some conditions even native species should be treated as though they were aliens - especially when we are dealing with plants.  Imported seeds and plant stock may be genetically adapted to very different climatic or soil conditions from the site to be restored.
<P>Suppose a plant species is already established at or nearby a site to be restored and foreign genetic stock of the same species is introduced through the restoration effort.  An opportunity then exists for genetic exchange between the original and introduced populations through crossbreeding to produce hybrid strains.  A number of possible outcomes can result depending on the species and local conditions: 
<OL>
	<P><LI> The exchange of genetic material improves the fitness of both populations, or at 	least has no negative effect (this would be the best situation).
	<P><LI> The new genetic material is so different from the local stock that the offspring of 	crossbred parents turn out to be infertile.  Theoretically, this could eventually cause the extinction of both populations if the species is rare or localized.
	<P><LI> The genetic exchange could result in outbreeding depression.  As the new genes spread through the local population they undermine the evolved genetic response to specific local conditions, and thus reduce fitness (see Schonewald-Cox et al. 1983, Ledig, 1986, Cockburn 1991, Padgett and Crow 1994).
</OL>
<P>It may be impossible to predict which of the above outcomes is the most likely.  Widespread species or those that have wind born seeds tend to be less susceptible to such negative impacts than those that are localized, or that have limited dispersal ability.
<P>These concerns should immediately preclude the use of many mass-produced canned or other seed mixes marketed for wildflower gardens.  First, the variety of species in these mixes virtually assures that some of these will not be indigenous to areas where they are being sold.  Second, what is indigenous may be genetically adapted to dramatically different climate and soil conditions.  In short, use of these seed mixtures can conceivably be detrimental.
<P>While the effects of most plantings may well be benign, in order to avoid the risks, an attempt should be made to ensure that material planted is both from local genetic stock and, where appropriate, from a variety of parent plants.  Achieving these goals will be difficult, in part because of our limited knowledge with respect to the requirements of individual species.  As well, the additional expense this would entail could reduce marketability, even to restorationists.
<P>Although it is time consuming and requires a much greater commitment, the best method is to collect seeds or cuttings from the site itself or from nearby areas, and to propagate and plant these.  This indicates the importance of preserving local natural areas as potential sources of restoration material (Handel, et al. 1994).  Because genetic qualities can even be variable in on site micro-environments such as north versus south facing slopes and different soil conditions, material should ideally be categorized and planted accordingly (Knapp and Rice 1994).
<P>Addressing genetic diversity dramatically complicates the work of restorationists, but it is should be done to avoid placing wild plant populations at risk.  It is important to at least make an effort to obtain appropriate plant stock.

<A name= landscape>The Landscape Approach
<br>In Part 1 we learned that fragmentation is a major contributing factor to biodiversity loss and that the isolation of populations in small ÒislandsÓ of habitat may inevitably lead to the local extinction of species.  It was also noted that the existing system of protected areas is probably inadequate for biodiversity protection.  At the same time, conventional approaches to agriculture, forestry and urbanization have dramatically altered the landscape and are compromising ecosystem integrity.  In order to ensure biodiversity conservation it will be necessary to make land use practices more sustainable.  Also required will be an improved and expanded protected areas network, and where bioregions with high diversity are severely degraded, extensive restoration will be necessary.
<P>So far, the majority of public restoration or naturalization initiatives have occurred within urban areas.  As will be discussed in Part 3, these efforts can make valuable contributions towards biodiversity conservation goals.  However, such work should not be undertaken in isolation, nor should urban restoration be the principal focus of limited resources.  Although cities and towns can be viewed as simply the most heavily altered parts of the settled landscape, and they certainly do suffer from problems associated with extreme fragmentation (in addition to other pressures), the higher priority of conservation and restoration in rural areas must be dealt with if we are to succeed.
<P>There are three principal means by which fragmentation might be addressed through restoration:  1) enhancement or improvement of fragments;  2) expansion of existing habitat blocks; and  3) creating linkages between fragments.  The potential of each of these will now be discussed.

<P>Enhancement of Fragments
<br>Some existing fragments of potential significance may have been degraded by overuse, livestock grazing, dumping of waste material, the presence of litter, invasions of exotic species, etc. Such sites can be improved with relative ease through habitat management or clean-up programs.  Enhancement of a site could include such things as improving reproductive capacity of characteristic vegetation species through seed planting and propagation, providing cover for threatened vertebrates, selective cutting of trees, etc.  Priorities will vary both regionally and by habitat type.  In all cases, supervision by local authorities is recommended.

<p>Expansion of Habitat Blocks
<br>It may be possible to reduce some negative edge effects by changing the character of the existing edge (Agee 1995).  For example, ÒhardÓ edges where forest abruptly meets agriculture or other forms of development can be ÒsoftenedÓ by encouraging shrubs and secondary growth around the perimeter.  This can be done by creating openings through limited cutting of trees around the edge, or by planting a native shrub periphery.  A softened edge can help buffer the fragment against wind, invasive exotics and predators. Planting of such habitat or changing land use practices around the outside of fragments can also help by creating a buffer zone that reduces impact on the protected area (Noss and Cooperrider 1994).
<P>If large patches of habitat are likely to be more viable than small ones, then expansion of existing areas by allowing natural regeneration or planting appropriate vegetation around the perimeter may be beneficial.  This can function like the buffers described above.  Exactly what vegetation to plant depends on what already exists on the site and what level of ecological succession might be addressed.
<P>In forests, expanding sites of sufficient size can create or increase regionally rare interior habitat, thus benefitting interior-dependent species such as the Wood Thrush, the Ovenbird and others.  Given that edge and associated effects may extend for up to 400 metres into a forest, patches under 30 ha are likely to be entirely edge (Morrison et al. 1992).  Only patches this size or larger will be good candidates for expansion if creation of interior habitat is the goal.  While the amount of energy required and the expense of restoring on this scale may be beyond the capacity of most citizen efforts, this should be seen as a priority if biodiversity conservation is the goal.

<p>The Pros and Cons of Corridors
<br>Using restoration to connect significant fragments through the development of corridors has been widely advocated and hotly debated in recent years (see for example Noss and Harris 1986, Hudson 1991, Simberloff et al. 1992).  Corridors can range in size from simple hedgerows, to river valleys, to huge swaths of habitat connecting existing parks and reserves.
<P>Potential benefits of corridors for biodiversity conservation include an increase in habitat diversity at the landscape level and promotion of wildlife population viability through providing dispersal opportunities.  The first of these will help insure appropriate species diversity at the regional level, while the latter is crucial to the long-term local survival of non-generalist species that require large home ranges.  Additional roles of corridors include erosion control and their potential as windbreaks.  
<P>Based on these advantages corridors have been widely promoted by many conservation advocates.  However, the potential negative impacts of corridors on local biodiversity are serious, and they should be given consideration before proceeding with this form of restoration.  These have been summarized by Simberloff and Cox (1987) and Simberloff et al. (1992).  They will be briefly discussed below.
<P>One potential disadvantage of corridors is the ease with which they may allow the spread of catastrophes such as fire, disease, exotic species and predation.  While it may be argued that some diseases and exotics are more likely to spread into fragments because they are isolated, the potential role of corridors in this respect should nevertheless be reviewed within the context of local conditions and concerns.  Newly developed corridors might also encourage predators to gain access to new sites.  Here they may have a negative impact on sensitive or rare species that had survived in part because they were isolated.
<P>A second problem with corridors is their role in increasing the amount of edge habitat within the landscape.  For example, long, thin strips of forest can provide habitat for opportunistic species that make use of edges.  As discussed in Part 1, these may prey upon or parasitize less common interior habitat specialists nesting close to edges.  A possible solution may be to make the corridors themselves large enough to provide substantial amounts of interior habitat (Noss 1994).  Although planting so large an area would be difficult, a combination of long-term restoration with natural regeneration might help to address this challenge.
<P>Another negative impact of corridors may be their ability to act as population sinks in themselves, or to encourage dispersal to areas that become population sinks.  The risk involves attracting populations to deficient corridor or fragment habitat rather than allowing them to remain in fragments where they may have had a better opportunity for survival (Henein and Merriam 1990, Soule and Gilpin 1991).
<P>Finally, Simberloff (1992) has argued that development of corridors may be a poor conservation investment when so little empirical evidence is available on the degree to which they may be beneficial.  Given the shortage of resources available for conservation, it may be more efficient to protect large blocks of existing habitat that are known to support viable populations, or that are significant for other reasons, rather than to invest in something that involves unnecessary risk.
<P>Despite their potential hazards, it is widely accepted that corridor development, in combination with fragment improvement and expansion, will be necessary to avoid the pitfalls of island biogeography.  The exact circumstances of a given region and the site context will determine if corridors are indeed appropriate, and if so, what form they should take.  Obviously, in order to ensure success, any project that involves restoration for corridor development should incorporate expertise in conservation biology and landscape ecology.

<P><A name = PART2summary>Summary
<br>Given the paucity of available resources, the identification of opportunities for biodiversity conservation through restoration at the landscape level should not be undertaken haphazardly. Ideally, not merely regional, but bioregional biodiversity strategies should be developed to set priorities for habitat protection and restoration.  This would involve long-term partnerships between various levels of government and the public sector, as well as the voluntary cooperation of land owners.  Preferably the process would occur under the supervision of conservation biologists and ecologists and would involve the following:
<P>First, at the regional landscape level areas of quality fragments that have a high potential for biodiversity conservation and connectivity must be identified.  This can be done through gap analysis studies using satellite images, maps, and aerial photographs combined with existing biological records and surveyorÕs notes of the area.  The potential for macro-scale corridors that cover large areas and micro-scale that can connect smaller fragments can then be assessed.
<P>Second, landowners must be contacted to determine the level of interest they may have in contributing to the conservation effort. Appropriate legal mechanisms such as land trusts can then be pursued.
<P>Next, an impact assessment should be undertaken to determine the potential positive or negative effects of a corridor on the biodiversity of the fragments to be connected.  This would involve a review of local conservation concerns as well as in-depth biological inventories of the sites by qualified naturalists or field biologists.  Involvement of expertise in conservation biology is essential both in the coordination of such an effort, and in the ultimate determination of restoration potential.
<P>Once restoration opportunities in rural settings have been identified, public involvement can take many forms.  Those who own farms and are sympathetic to the cause may be willing to set aside land for restoration purposes, or to allow natural regeneration to occur in unproductive areas.  The potential role of agricultural land and rangelands for wildlife conservation is now receiving considerable attention (Fedorowick 1992, Noss 1994, Payne and Bryant 1994), and with more research there may be many new approaches developed as well.
<P>Local naturalist or environmental groups can have a role in coordinating restoration efforts that fit within a regional strategy.  Combining the efforts of these groups with other community groups and schools could provide valuable labour and education opportunities.  It may also be possible to bus students from urban areas to restoration sites for interpretation and habitat planting projects.
<P>Meeting biodiversity conservation goals through restoration at the landscape level will, of necessity, involve many separate projects by concerned individuals and groups.  These efforts will be most effective if they are tied into a regional strategy such as that described above.  Although the organizational and logistical complexities of the task may seem overwhelming, this is a challenge that must be met if we are to conserve biodiversity and ensure the long-term integrity of our life support systems.  Although it has many detractors, the Wildlands Project - which advocates large-scale connectivity and a greatly improved reserve system - has been lauded by many conservation biologists as a shining example of the required approach (Forman et al. 1992).  The journal Wild Earth provides a forum for projects across North America that are working to meet these goals.  The determination of many individuals and the strong partnerships between groups on such a scale are a positive sign that change is possible.

<h3><A name= URBAN>PART 3 - 	THE URBAN CONTEXT	</a></h3>
"Rather than analyzing nature for the sake of dominating and controlling it, restorationists are synthesing it for the sake of living symbiotically within the whole."
<br>- Carolyn Merchant
<P>
<P>Most "naturalization" projects occur in urban environments. This recent trend to plant backyard and school ground habitat to attract wildlife indicates that there is a growing awareness of a need for human/nature interaction, but is there potential within an urban environment to go a step further and address biodiversity conservation goals through ecological restoration?
<P>Historically, cities and towns have been designed as habitat for one species alone.  In short, they have been fundamentally at odds with biodiversity.  Natural areas remained in urban environments either because they were unsuitable for development, or because they were retained as recreational zones for humans.  While people have deliberately attracted birds for decades, for the most part the presence of wildlife in cities was coincidental.  Urban parks and ravines have long been considered an asset, but recently (perhaps as a result of growing environmental awareness), an increased appreciation of Nature among the populace has led to a greater demand for "wild" areas as an important component of western cities.

<P>Biodiversity in Urban Areas
<br>VanDruff (1979) suggested that most metropolitan areas can be divided into three distinct zones:  1) metropolitan centres,  2) suburbia, and  3) the rural-urban interface.  Each of these provides different opportunities for wildlife and supports a distinct pattern of species diversity.
<P>In some metropolitan centres vegetation and natural habitat may be so sparse that only a small variety of species is present. Trees may be limited to exotic pollution-tolerant ornamental, or invasive exotics such as Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus altissima). Exotic, human-tolerant species such as House Sparrow (Passer domesticus), European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) and Rock Dove (Columba livia) may be the only birds capable of breeding here. Beyond these the expression of diversity may be limited to a few scavengers such as Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis) and American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) that enter the city centre from surrounding areas to take advantage of abundant garbage. Mammals may be restricted to exotic pests such as the House Mouse (Mus musculus) or Norway Rat (Rattus norvegicus).
<P>Suburban areas provide a mosaic of green spaces such as manicured lawns, and trees or shrubs - mostly exotics - planted as ornamentals.  Here the bird diversity is considerably higher.  The American Robin (Turdus migratorius) gains easy access to worms on open lawns.  Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura), House Finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), American Goldfinch (Carduelis tristis) and Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) do well in part because of bird feeders, while the Blue Jay (Cyanocitta cristata), crows, grackles and others are opportunistic, and therefore equally adaptable to suburban and rural conditions.  Mammals can include opportunistic native species such as Raccoon (Procyon lotor) and skunks, as well as rodents such as Meadow Vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and Woodchuck (Marmota monax) which enjoy open areas. Species associated with metropolitan centres and suburban environments are thriving in areas where rising human populations have resulted in the accelerated growth of urban areas.
<P>The rural-urban interface can provide a greater diversity of habitats such as farmland, floodplain, and woods.  Here the many species associated with each of these live in close proximity to those found more typically in suburban areas.  
<P>In summary, ecosystem and species diversity tends to increase as the density of human population and settlement decreases. Therefore, although restoration within urban centres and suburban areas is needed as part of a broad landscape continuum, and there are many such efforts underway, ultimately it may be within the rural-urban interface that the best opportunities for biodiversity conservation occur within the urban context (Adams and Dove 1989). Where large metropolitan areas have been thoroughly developed within their existing boundaries, surrounding municipalities will present the best opportunities in this respect.
<P>In addition to VanDruff's three general categories, cities frequently contain remnants of the ecosystems that existed before urbanization.  These can survive in suburban areas, or even within metropolitan centres amidst high density human settlement.  Such fragments can be of importance for erosion control, water retention and aesthetics (Agee 1995).  They also provide refuges for wildlife and increase local biodiversity in an otherwise impoverished environment.
<P>Other than the occasional forest fragment, meadow, or utility and railway rights-of-way, river valleys or ravines are perhaps the most common example of remnant natural areas in cities.  Ravines that have experienced minimal disturbance can support wildlife not normally associated with urban environments, including threatened species.  Furthermore, they can form natural linkages or green corridors between urban habitat nodes such as parks, or between city centres and the rural landscape.  This allows for migration and dispersal of wildlife populations, increasing the viability of connected fragments (Adams and Dove 1989, Hough 1995).  Ravines may also provide crucial habitat for migratory birds that must pass through ever expanding urban areas each Autumn and Spring.  Species intolerant of human disturbance, including those experiencing population declines, may be especially dependent on these areas. Improving such habitats through restoration can help ensure the survival of these species.
<P>Remnant natural areas may also include threatened ecosystem types.  In such cases urban centres can play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation.  High Park in Toronto provides an example of the challenges involved under such circumstances.  Much of the park is a degraded but significant remnant of Black Oak (Quercus velutina) savanna.  This is perhaps CanadaÕs rarest ecosystem, supporting up to 30 percent of OntarioÕs rare plant species (Hoepfner 1994).
<P>A number of factors have contributed to the degradation of the High Park site, including human recreation pressures, invasion of exotic vegetation and the deliberate planting of ornamental tree species.  Most importantly, the natural disturbance regime that maintains oak savanna systems - in this case periodic fires - has been eliminated (Whitney 1994).  Thus, in order to preserve remnants such as High Park, selective removal of ornamental trees and periodic controlled burns will be necessary (Suhanie 1994). Under such circumstances public education becomes a crucial component of the restoration program.





<P>Urban Areas and Biodiversity Conservation
<br>Urbanization represents a radical and more or less permanent alteration of the environment to suit human needs.  Disturbance of this magnitude affects ecosystem diversity by eliminating large areas of natural habitat.  Because of the limited dispersal capacity of many species found within remaining habitats, genetic diversity is also reduced.  The inevitable local extinctions under these conditions result in the dramatically reduced species richness characteristic of urban natural areas.
<P>In addition to the direct loss of habitat there are other factors that have a strong influence on urban biodiversity.  These include pesticide use, pollution, nutrient loading, degraded soils, and the presence of invasive exotic species and feral animals such as dogs and cats.
<P>The influence of these factors may be so extensive that only limited restoration of a given site may be practical.  For example, severely degraded or contaminated soils may prevent the growth of many vegetation species, while pollutants absorbed by existing plants could be passed up the food chain to harm other wildlife. Furthermore, polluted water on the site may be uninhabitable by sensitive species of wildlife.
<P>Under ideal circumstances cleaning up such sites would be seen as fundamental to any true restoration project, and to biodiversity enhancement.  However, removing contaminants is likely to be too complex and expensive a procedure for the average community restoration program to tackle.  In lieu of such measures, a number of options remain.  
<P>It may be more practical and expedient in the short-term to allow such sites to regenerate naturally (to the degree to which this is possible), so that they provide at least a minimal amount of habitat, while focusing restoration efforts on more promising areas.  If there remains a determined local effort to do more, some energy might be devoted to site enhancement by removing invasive species or attempting to diversify the habitat types present. Finally, it may be possible to gradually improve degraded sites through creative use of ecological succession, beginning with pioneer species and combining this with limited clean up programs, use of fertilizers and so on.  Obviously this would demand a serious commitment to the site and the involvement of expertise in the fields of waste management and restoration ecology.
<P>Invasive exotic plants do particularly well in disturbed areas, hence they have become firmly established in many urban green spaces.  These plants can be so pervasive on a site and in the vicinity that their complete removal may be difficult.  
<P>Ravines in cities provide a good example of the challenges facing restorationists under such conditions.  Despite their importance as remnant natural areas and corridors, ravines are often plagued by exotic plants.  Here seeds spread in riparian areas through flooding, while uplands are invaded by wind-born seeds and those dispersed by wildlife.  Crack Willow (Salix fragilis), Common Buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), Siberian Elm (Ulmus pumila), Dog-strangling Vine (Cynanchum medium), Purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), Garlic Mustard (Alliaria officinalis), Japanese Knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum), and other aliens now dominate many sites, reducing species diversity and homogenizing ecosystems.
<P>Discerning between invasive and non-invasive species is an appropriate first step towards management of exotic vegetation.  If the commitment exists to do so, non-invasive species can be removed from small sites with relative ease.  Where this becomes impractical it may be of little concern if the plants are having a minimal impact on the restored system.
<P>Removal of invasive exotics, by contrast, can involve intensive management in both the short and long terms.  Indeed, with some species, managers may find themselves facing a losing battle.  Unless positive results are evident, one must question the validity of investing limited resources in ordinary restoration efforts.  Nevertheless, this intensive management approach may be justified as a form of restoration in itself in cases where the continued existence of rare species or ecosystems is threatened by the invasive vegetation. 
<P>Approaches of enhancement, expansion and connection of habitat have been introduced as means to address biodiversity conservation at the landscape level.  This strategy can also provide a framework for dealing with many urban biodiversity conservation issues.
<P>Isolated populations of threatened species can survive in metropolitan areas, or sometimes these may be threatened by expanding suburbs.  Such species are likely to be those with limited capacity or need for movement such as plants, invertebrates or herpetofauna.  In some cases ensuring the protection of existing habitat may be sufficient to sustain a population.  This can involve designation of core reserve areas within an urban zone, as was the case with the Coachella Valley Fringe-toed Lizard (Ulma inornata) near Los Angeles (Beatly 1994).  However, if a species is in a precarious position and it has been determined that extinction will be imminent without intervention, then the enhancement or expansion of habitat becomes a viable option.
<P>The needs of uncommon wildlife, including certain species of reptiles and amphibians or birds can also be considered in urban restoration projects.  Placement of snags, decaying wood or use of other techniques discussed in Part 2 can enhance habitat for the benefit of these.  One of the easiest ways to address a conservation concern through restoration is by creating or enhancing urban habitats to help migratory birds in passage (see text box). 
<P>As in rural areas, there may be opportunities to not only enhance, but to expand and connect significant urban habitats through restoration (Agee 1995).  For example, wooded areas surrounded by open areas or degraded habitat might be expanded to provide more forest interior.  As with any forest fragment, rounded edges can help to reduce negative external threats.  Providing buffer zones through such enhancement and expansion efforts can be particularly useful in urban situations where recreational overuse can be highly damaging to sensitive areas.
<P>Adams (1994) and Adams and Dove (1989) have emphasized the importance of designating core protected areas and developing corridors between these in urban areas.  As in rural landscapes, providing linkages between such habitat nodes can contribute to population survival by allowing dispersal opportunities.  A visual example of corridors and habitat enhancement opportunities is provided in figure 3.1.
<P>The potential dangers involved in corridor development were discussed in detail in Part 2.  As always, these should be considered before proceeding with linkages.  What is necessary in this context is to draw a distinction between connecting urban nodes with other urban nodes in metropolitan centres and suburban areas, and connecting urban nodes with rural nodes in the rural/urban interface.
<P>Because of their proximity to heavily settled landscapes and the degree of disturbance to which they are subjected, the ecology of urban natural areas may be profoundly different from their rural counterparts.  For example, wildlife that is intolerant of human activities is likely to be absent, while artificially high populations of opportunistic species such as raccoons, skunks, foxes etc. is characteristic.  Also typical is an abundance of roaming domestic dogs and cats as well as the preponderance of exotic plant species.
<P>The extent of degradation in these remnant natural areas suggests that with respect to potential negative consequences for biodiversity, connecting urban nodes through corridors may have fewer risks than might be the case in rural landscapes.  However, caution should still be taken when considering this option, especially if there is a substantial difference in the degree of degradation at the sites.  In this case biological inventories and studies of historical records are recommended.
<P>Landscape linkages through corridor development may be most problematic at the urban/rural interface.  Theoretically, making such connections could increase the population viability of some urban wildlife by improving dispersal capacity and thus opportunities for genetic exchange.  Simultaneously, the increased access to metropolitan areas would probably result in a higher species diversity within the urban setting.
<P>Countering these possible benefits are a number of serious negative consequences that could result from creating such linkages.  The principal concern in this respect is the issue of biological invasions.  We have already noted that urban natural areas frequently contain inflated populations of opportunistic species and tend to have problems with invasive exotic vegetation. Is it wise to allow these greater access to previously isolated and less disturbed sites in the rural landscape?  Could this put the integrity of such sites and some sensitive species at risk?
<P>Given these risks, it would be irresponsible to freely advocate corridor development without careful consideration of the consequences.  Indeed, it is possible that severing existing linkages could be an equally valuable management option under some circumstances.  Certainly, impact assessments based on thorough biological inventories should be undertaken before any such linkages are contemplated, with expertise in conservation biology informing the decision-making process.
<P>A second negative impact involves movement of wildlife in the opposite direction: from rural habitat into metropolitan areas. The problem referred to is the attraction of undesirable species into settled areas.  While under some circumstances this could be a threat to urban biodiversity (such as increased predation on a threatened species), it is more a social issue relating to the human tolerance of wildlife.
<P>Ecological restoration is a process of working towards long-term ecosystem integrity.  Assuming this would of necessity involve replacing the full complement of species associated with the ecosystem restored, then some of these species are bound to be incompatible with human settlements.  Bears, Coyote, or even Beaver (Castor canadensis) (to name but a few examples), are not likely to be welcome in the average neighbourhood.  Yet watershed restoration combined with landscape linkages at the rural/urban interface could invite these into metropolitan areas.  The question to be asked is:  How far are we willing to go with restoration in the urban context?
<P>In urban areas then, it may be difficult to achieve true restoration.  Perhaps the best opportunities for addressing the needs of biodiversity here may lie in some combination of naturalization and restoration.  Enhancing existing habitat and creating new habitat on degraded sites can help to maintain or improve existing species richness in an urban area without directly contributing to a conservation concern.  In limited circumstances these activities might be undertaken to benefit uncommon or threatened plant or small animal species found at specific locales in urban areas.

<P><A name = part3summary>Summary and Conclusions
<br>As suggested previously, a broad landscape approach will be required to conserve biodiversity where natural habitats have been fragmented by agriculture and urbanization.  Given that enhancement or expansion of existing habitats and the development of linkages between them are priority approaches, then obviously opportunities will be greater in rural areas than in urban settings.  The extent of degradation in urban natural areas and the potential negative consequences of connecting these with rural habitats further emphasizes the need to channel resources beyond urban centres.
<P>In general then, rural landscapes have much greater potential for biodiversity conservation than do urban areas.  Ultimately our success or failure in the conservation of biodiversity will be dependent on our ability to concentrate our limited resources on identifying, protecting, enhancing and connecting significant natural areas within the broader landscape matrix.
<P>This is not to exclude urban areas or to imply that these are of little value for conservation.  For one thing, it is largely urban residents that have an interest in the naturalization alternative.  Furthermore, natural habitats in urban areas provide excellent educational opportunities, and education is fundamental to biodiversity conservation (see text box on backyards and schoolyards).  As discussed above, restoration can be applied to urban areas to enhance significant habitat, to improve population viability of uncommon species, and to help birds during migration.
<P>Cities and towns are prominent features within the landscape. Their impact on surrounding natural areas - for example through the importation of resources and export of waste - is dramatic. Therefore the ÒgreeningÓ of urban areas, through promoting environmentally sound behavior and development as well as restoration, is an essential component of addressing biodiversity and ecosystem integrity.  The actual and potential role of urban areas in both the destruction and protection of biodiversity must be addressed.
<P>In Part 2 the need for regional biodiversity strategies was emphasized.  It is recommended that local strategies be developed by municipalities within the context of regional concerns.  These should identify local conservation concerns and significant areas for biodiversity.  Restoration opportunities should be based on opportunities to improve, expand, connect or create significant habitats.  This would involve the following:
<OL>
	<LI> identifying local expertise and information sources;
	<P><LI> biological inventories of natural areas within the metropolitan area;
	<P><LI> developing maps of priority sites for restoration;
	<P><LI> determining appropriate vegetation for each site;
	<P><LI> coordinating municipal and public plantings to address designated priority areas.
</OL>
<P>This approach should be combined with an effort to promote greener forms of development that have a low impact on biodiversity, or better, that enhance or encourage natural diversity and allow for habitat continuity at the landscape level.  Ideally such development would be consistent with local and regional biodiversity strategies, and would recognize that habitat protection and restoration is not only necessary to maintain the integrity of our life-support systems, it can be a real asset to the community.


	
<h3><A name= GUIDELINES>PART 4 - RESTORATION FOR BIODIVERSITY:<p>
SOME BASIC GUIDELINES</a>	</h3>

If an individual or an organization has taken an interest in restoration or naturalization that goes beyond backyard plantings, and biodiversity is an important concern, what steps should be taken to ensure that work is successful and the results are ecologically sound?  The following basic guidelines are designed to answer this question while incorporating the concerns addressed in other parts of this document.

<P>
General Guidelines
<br>No matter what type of restoration is undertaken - be it in school grounds, parks, ravines, or in rural environments - a number of basic steps should be considered before proceeding.
<OL>
	<LI> Try to involve people with expertise in biology and conservation in your project.  Local naturalist groups and provincial or federal government departments may be able to provide some support, or help make connections.

	<P><LI> Consider options such as removing waste or exotic species to enhance an existing site as a possible alternative to planting a new site.

	<P><LI> Undertake research into historical site conditions.  Can current soil and climate allow restoration of the original ecosystem, or would another type be more appropriate?

	<P><LI> Choose an existing ecosystem similar to the one to be restored to act as a reference.

	<P><LI> Plant only locally indigenous vegetation species.

	<P><LI> Study the on-site microclimate, the soil type and condition, and the types of habitat found nearby.  What type of ecosystem will be most appropriate for the site?

	<P><LI> Consider ecological succession.  What stage of succession do you wish to address?  The best bet may be to plant pioneer species the first year, and add others in successive years.

	<P><LI> Select plant species according to what is appropriate for the site more than for personal preferences, or for the sake of maximizing species diversity.  It is better to plant only a few suitable species than to risk the survival of many.

	<P><LI> Attempt to obtain seed from local stock that has grown under conditions similar to the planting site.  Always be sure to leave enough for the plant to reproduce.  Collect and propagate your own seed, or look for a nursurey that obtains stock from local sources.

	<P><LI> Draw up a site plan so that you and your partners are clear about your objectives and approach.

	<P><LI> Design and implement a monitoring program to determine both the survival rate of your planted material and the ultimate impacts of your work on biodiversity.  Consultation with an expert can help you choose a method that suits your objectives and capacity.  This involves a long-term commitment because it entails returning to the site in consecutive years.
	<P><LI> Conduct a biological inventory of the site before proceeding to ensure that no significant features will be disrupted and to provide a baseline for future monitoring.
</OL>

<P><BR><BR>
The Rural Landscape
<P>This is where restoration has the greatest potential to deal with conservation concerns, particularly habitat fragmentation.  
<OL>
	<LI> Identify regional conservation issues that might be addressed and groups that may already be involved in similar work, or that could be potential partners.

	<P><LI> Protecting existing habitat should be the priority.  From here attempt to restore buffers and corridors.

	<P><LI> Identify priority areas for restoration.  These can range from addressing the needs of threatened species, finding habitat blocks that can be enhanced or enlarged, or identifying areas where connecting links may be feasible.

	<P><LI> Undertake research into conservation mechanisms such as land trusts or alternative agriculture methods that may have potential in your area.

	<P><LI> Contact land owners that hold key sites to determine potential interest.  This is a delicate business that should only be undertaken by individuals who are both knowledgeable and diplomatic. Working with respected community members and innovative farmers may help to garner respect and open doors.

	<P><LI> Develop a restoration strategy at the local or regional level, depending on your capacities.  Include an education and outreach component.

	<P><LI> Choose demonstration sites and involve the local community, naturalist groups, conservation authorities etc. in the planning and restoration process to the greatest degree possible.
</OL>
<P><BR><BR>

Urban Areas
<br>As discussed in the main text, urban biodiversity issues can be very different from the rural context, primarily due to the degree of habitat degradation and the different species composition that results.  In addition to the general guidelines above, the following are suggested:
<OL>
	<P><LI> Decide whether you wish to plant habitat in an isolated school ground or park context, or adjacent to an existing natural area. The former may be of limited direct value for biodiversity conservation, although such projects can be extremely valuable education tools.  If the latter option is chosen, more care must be taken, and involvement of appropriate expertise is recommended.

	<P><LI> There may be opportunities to clean up or remove invasive exotic species from existing natural areas.  This form of restoration may be more valuable than planting new habitat, or could complement naturalization projects.

	<P><LI> Identify local biodiversity conservation issues that might be addressed through restoration such as threatened or uncommon species, rare ecosystem types, fragmentation etc.  Contact local naturalist groups for information and advice.

	<P><LI> Make sure that whatever caused the conservation concern in the first place has been eliminated as an obstacle.  There is little point in trying to encourage wildlife that cannot tolerate existing disturbances or that will likely end up as road kills.

	<P><LI> Identify any opportunities to enhance or expand existing natural areas to reduce edge effects or promote forest interior habitat. Can or should significant nodes be connected by corridors?

	<P><LI> Based on site conditions and local counterparts, decide what type of habitat is most appropriate for the site.

	<P><LI> Identify any possible external threats to the site or the wildlife that may be attracted before proceeding.  There is little point in trying to attract small animals, for example, if there is a good possibility they will end up as road kills.  Are any major developments planned that will affect the integrity of the site?

	<P><LI> Consider the degree to which human access should be encouraged or discouraged.  Will trails compromise the siteÕs conservation capacity?  Can buffers be planted to protect core areas?

	<P><LI> Consider what types of wildlife are likely to be attracted to the site.  Are these likely to have a negative impact on sensitive species in nearby natural areas?  Are there ways to discourage undesirable species?

<h2>Tatlow Creek & Park, Vancouver B.C.</h2><br>

<h3>KevinÕs Favourite Òsmall parkÓ in Vancouver</h3>
<P>

The <b> Tatlow Creek Daylighting Committee </b> is working with the Vancouver Board of Parks & Recreation, City of Vancouver Dept. of Engineering, Kitsilano Residents Association, Point Grey Foreshore Preservation Society, water quality engineers, and local residents to research the 
opportunities to ÒdaylightÓ Tatlow Creek on its course through Tatlow Park, divert storm water to the creek (recreating a real watershed), and improve habitat with reduced maintenance and allowing water and riparian plants to return.
<p>


Tatlow Park is a small park west of MacDonald @ 2nd avenue, in Kitsilano just past 
the west end of Kits beach. It has one of the few open ÒcreeksÓ in Vancouver, although
this one is open for only a hundred feet and most of the water comes from a tap, not natural runoff.
<p>A couple of heron were spotted here one morning,
with one hiding in the trees while the other waded into the shallow water, perhaps
for a drink. <p>

For more information about the project and how you can get involved, please contact Mel Lehan in Kits 731-0599.

<center><h1>The Beltline / Oriole Park, </h1>
<h2>Toronto, Ont.</h2></center>


<h3>This midtown neighbourhood has been blessed by a failed commuter railroad from the
late 1800's, The beltline Railway, which follows the natural path of an old stream and links many 
green spaces down its path to the Don River. The true blessing came from the local 
residents, including Howard Joy, who made sure that this linear natural area was
purchased by the parks department (and not turned into townhouses by the CPR).

<p>
<A HREF="jengardenbig95.html"><IMG SRC="jengardensmall95.gif" align=left hspace=10 border=2></A>
<p>Long time local residents Kevin & Jennifer began 
their work in the spring of 1995. Their efforts are still
 modest, but demonstrate a commitment to improving the natural
health of their neighbourhood. <P>

Jen convinced her old-school, lawn-loving landlord that a 
herb-vegetable-native flower garden would look great. <P>
<br clear>
<P>
.
<p>
<A HREF="kevbeltlinebig95.html"><IMG SRC="kevbeltlinesmall95.gif" align=left hspace=10 Border=2></A>
<P>Kevin finally convinced the Parks Dept. to 
stop mowing in a few places around the Beltline 
entrance near Oriole Park and the Davisville TTC 
(then planted some local source Black Walnuts, 2 Ash trees,
 Lupine and other wildflowers for good measure). <p>
<br clear>
<p>
 More to come! :-)

So, for a great walk, take the TTC to Eglington West Station. Find the Beltline Trail just
North of Eglinton Ave. on the East side of the Allen Express Way. It will take you on
a beautiful 6 km+ trip along two different ravines through Forest Hill, Mount Pleasant Cemetary, Moore Park, the
old Don Valley Brick Works and down into the Lower Don River Valley just north of 
CastleFrank below Rosedale.

<center>Bill Lucas, Director, Learning Through Landscapes</center>
<p>
<p>

<p>Bill Lucas is the founding Director of Learning Through Landscapes.  Before taking on this challenge, he taught for eleven years, running an interdisciplinary arts faculty and becoming the Deputy Headteacher of a large community school in West London.

	<p>He is the author of more than twenty books about English, the arts and the environment.  He writes regularly for the Times Educational Supplement and The Guardian Newspaper and is a regular contributor to specialist journals.  His most recent books are Bright Ideas in the Outdoor Classroom (Scholastic) and Looking at Language (Cambridge University Press).

	<p>Under his leadership, Learning Through Landscapes has grown to be a major UK charity, carrying out research, delivering training, running projects, publishing resources and advising government.   In October, Bill was honoured by the British Secretary of State for Health with a Guardian/Jerwood award for individual excellence in the charity field.

<p>Learning Through Landscapes promotes improvements to the environmental quality and educational use of school grounds by coordinating an imaginative programme of activities  designed to encourage  sustainable developments.  Their aim is to help individual schools to help themselves.  

<p>To achieve this, Learning Through Landscapes:

<UL>
<LI>	provides information and advice to teachers and parents, governors, landscape 	architects, local authorities and anyone else who request it.

<LI>	provides publications to meet the needs of those involved in school grounds 	development.

<LI>	carries out research to ensure that they are constantly able to give out the best advice.

<LI>	runs a range of training courses, especially for principals  and works with other training 
<LI>	organizations.

<LI> 	strives  to ensure that the issue of school grounds is at the top of the agenda for 	educators and environemntalists.
</UL>

	<p> Bill Lucas' key note address was highlighted by an inspiring slide show featuring  innovative school naturalization projects around the globe.

<p>
<p>

 
<p>The school grounds of my childhood were grassy areas, mowed to give some space
around the school, where children could play red rover or prisoners' base or
scrub baseball during recess and the noon hour.  Big trees shaded the grounds,
which were bordered by  wildflowers and old field shrubs.   Lunches were often
eaten by teacher and students on the rocks beside the river, with discussion
about glaciation and the carving force of the water that had created the swirls
and kettle holes in the rock.  Games at recess were self organized, with the
rules taught to the first graders by the older students, who kept an eye on the
younger ones.

<p>Today school children are lucky to have grass that isn't either sports field
or "Don't walk on the...".  Most school yards are used by hundreds of  students,
organized sports are the norm, and grounds are gravel or asphalt with chain link
fence protecting either the students, or the passers-by and neighbours, depending
on how you look at it.  Play equipment is painfully ugly, violently colored,
non-creative, but guarantied liability free.  Most students spend their recess
time fairly aimlessly.  Their environment, trampled by their numbers, is a barren
waste, and their mental engagement is about the same.  Comparisons have been made
to prison yards and refugee camps.

<p>The movement to naturalize school yards -- to make them environmentally richer
places, places of learning,  places of the unexpected, of discovery, that open
minds to the world around them --  is both new and old.  Periodically school
grounds become a focus of attention, a sign that they have become dysfunctional
with the societal mindset  and thus educational needs.  What is new today is not
the concept of learning grounds, or the focus on the environment, or the opening
of young minds to the real life situations that classrooms teach in the abstract,
 but the focus on teaching children about an environment that is not controlled 
by themselves, their teachers, their parents.

<p>Ontario has more history of learning grounds thinking than I had imagined, and
has, on occasion, been on the front edge of educational theory for school
grounds.  Schooling in Ontario's early days was accomplished within the family,
or by a teacher hired and boarded by several families, or the small community.

<p>In 1816 the passage of the Common School Act marked acceptance of the idea
that the whole of a society has the responsibility for education of the young.
<p>In the 1850s the first real public schools appeared, in the sense of being
funded by property taxes (1850 Act) rather than fees.

<p>The 1850s - 1870s were years of great growth in the school system, along with
a change in attitude from disdain for education outside of the family(s), to
education as a pillar of rural Victorian society -- along with the family and the
church.

<p>In 1857, in what was apparently the first focused look at school yards,
Toronto's Dept. of Public Instruction for Upper Canada recommended that school
grounds be planted to promote a taste for neatness, order and beauty -- with
trees to provide shade for the building and playground , "and not leave both
exposed, as is too often done, to the fierce heat of summer and the storms of
winter".  Today we are recommending the planting of trees to help protect
children against skin cancer.

<p>The 1870s were years of reform for the schools, with attention being given to
the lighting, and the physical health of students.  Along with increasing
population, the effects of the Industrial Revolution were becoming factors, in
the growth of cities, crowding, poor health, disease, and crime.  Entrepreneurs
were finding that slum conditions affected productivity, and this, coupled with a
growing desire to match their  society against the culture of England or Europe, 
led to the City Beautification movement.  This had a profound effect across North
America, not least of all on the "beautification" of school grounds.

<p>Canada's first Arbor Day was proclaimed in 1887.   In the previous two decades
Ontario's Chief Superintendent of Education, Edgerton Ryerson, had campaigned for
schools to be set "in a sylvan setting of lawns and trees".

<p>Shortly thereafter, around 1900, the school garden movement began in earnest. 
In 1890 the Massachusetts Horticultural Society had sent a representative to
study school gardens in Europe.  The trip resulted in the first school garden in
the U.S.. -- a wildflower garden in Roxbury, Massachusetts.  Ten years later that
school initiated a vegetable garden.

<p>Also during the 1890s in Canada, philanthropist William MacDonald funded
school gardens in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward
Island, as well as the MacDonald Institute at Guelph.  The purpose was threefold:
  to introduce advanced agricultural methods, to encourage beautification, and
for student health.  The impetus here also had come from the European school
movement.

<p>At the beginning of the 1800s European estate owners instituted garden
instruction in rural schools for the economic reason of stopping the flow of
unskilled labour to towns and cities, to build the national agricultural wealth. 
Schlleswig-Holstein in 1814, and Prussia in 1819 introduced the culture of fruits
and vegetables in rural schools.  Gradually, plant study became a feature of
rural and city schools.  In 1869, by royal edict, both Austria and Sweden took up
the movement.  By 1890 the French Ministry was stating that school gardens would
inspire a love for the country and develop interest in flowers and birds.

<p>The emphasis  was certainly on ensuring the agricultural supplying of an
industrial nation, but there is also the legacy of the Romantic movement with its
new interest in the beauty of Nature and the moral superiority of beings closely
attuned to Nature.  MacDonald put the European idea of the utility of school
gardens as secondary to, above all else, the "symmetrical education of the
individual".

<p>Thus, in the Canada of 1900 to 1910 the school garden became an outdoor
classroom -- teaching arithmetic, banking, business practices, mechanical
drawing, entomology, chemistry, botany, and physical geography. In 1910 an author
on school gardens wrote that these gardens taught civic virtues:  the private
care of public property, economy, honesty, application, concentration,
self-government, civic pride, justice, the dignity of labor, and the love of
nature.  In other words school gardens formed good, responsible citizens who
would contribute to society.

<p>In 1915 another author wrote that "children's school and home gardening is no
longer considered a fad, or experiment, but is now recognized by leading
educators as a very important factor in the health and education of the child,
and in making our cities and villages more beautiful and desirable places to live
in, as unsightly places, rubbish piles, etc. will be replaced by growing plants
and flowers. "    The subtext is a recognized need to create order, neatness,
propriety, and control -- of society, and of nature.   In some cities in the U.S.
school children were organized into "city garden soldiers".  The children paid 2
cents for a button that said "We Conquer the Earth".

<p>The Ontario Horticultural Societies' Annual Report for 1932 quotes Magistrate
John Fry of Dundas (who was also the President of the Dundas Horticultural
Society):  "Since the organization of horticultural societies in our town, there
was a marked decrease in the number of youthful delinquents, until, in the year
1931, there was not a conviction."

<p>During the war years of the 40s the emphasis was still on the school gardens'
contributions to society in the form of Victory Gardens -- but by the late 40s
there was a return to school grounds of grass and trees -- perhaps a reflection
of the desire for peace and an end to striving.

<p>During the late 50s and through the 60s schools again went through a time of
upheaval and retrofitting, as school consolidation and busing reflected the
population shift to urban centres that had occurred, the baby boom, and the
modular unit approach to dealing with large numbers and large needs that was a
legacy of the war years.  The increase in density in the schools resulted in
school grounds of gravel or asphalt that could withstand the impact, and an
increase in liability concerns that resulted most visibly in fencing, and
guarantied safe play equipment.  Organized team sports and their dedicated
playing fields, though long a presence in schools, became a paramount use of
school grounds.

<p>In reaction to these desolate and impoverished grounds the 1970s in Britain
produced the "adventure playgrounds", designed to encourage the inventive,
creative aspects of play as both an individualistic and cooperative adventure. 
The "messy" aspects of adventure playgrounds were much discussed, as were the
liability issues.  The legacy of the cult of neatness and order and control was
not prepared to bow out.

<p>Also during the 70s and 80s organic gardening made its school garden debut. 
As well as being another subversion of neatness and order, the organic garden
began to address the issue of control of nature -- not by giving up control, but
by using nature to control nature, for the benefit of humanity.  These are the
years of a growing understanding of the meaning of ecology, of the birth of the
"green" movements, and of a gradually increasing societal concern with the
divorce of people from their natural surroundings, and the impact of human
population on the earth's resources.  The first photos from space revealed the
fragile finiteness of the planet.

<p>An article published in 1987 exclaimed over playgrounds in Vancouver that had
looked like prison yards -- asphalt, gravel, and chainlink fence -- being
converted into a productive food gardens through organic gardening.  "95% of the
kids were apartment dwellers and didn't even know what a plant was".  The article
went on to comment on how the garden had livened up the science program.  Another
article spoke of the school garden contributing to studies in biology, nutrition,
mathematics and economics in terms very similar to those of the book from 1915: 
"The urban school garden of the 80s is a way to introduce a whole new generation
to food production, and to think about related issues of energy conservation and
pesticide use.  All the environmental issues of the last ten to twenty years can
be better understood through gardening."

<p>In March 1989 David Suzuki's column featured a letter from Catherine Verrall,
a kindergarten teacher from Hamilton, worrying about the Board of Education's use
of weedkillers on school grounds.  She was not only concerned about the
children's health, but also the health of the school grounds, and the example
that was being set for the children.  She spoke of non-grass genocide, of
teaching that nature is an enemy to be destroyed rather than a nurturer, that
system-organized violence against nature is OK, that gifts of nature such as lady
bugs, purslane, creeping Charlie, are welcome only if controlled by human beings.
 She said, "The absence of interesting life trains children not to look, not  to
notice..."

<p>Today we are looking not only at how children learn, and the benefit that an
outdoors, linked-with-the-earth program can bring,  but also the realization that
the next generation must be knowledgeable about the environment -- from the micro
to the macro level.  The understanding cannot be abstract and academic, as it is
for much of this generation, but an intimate comprehension of how humans are
woven into the intricate complexities of the life of the planet,  the value of
each bug and dandelion and vole, and the understanding that hard-won control of
natural systems demeans and impoverishes both the controllers and the systems. 
Its a new goal for an old practice -- turning our school grounds into learning
grounds.

<H3><center>THE STUDENT PERSPECTIIVE </center></H3>
<center>A Video By Ted Cheskey, Waterloo Board of Education</center>
<p>
<p>

<p>During the summer of 1994, I produced a 30 minute video titled: The Students'
Perspective: What students think about school yards, with the cooperation of
students and staff at the Waterloo County Board of Education.  The video includes
scripted questions asked by student interviewers to small groups of students at
three elementary and three secondary schools of the Waterloo County Board of
Education.  Over two hours of spontaneous student reactions to the questions have
been edited in to twenty minutes of revealing commentary on the state of school
yards.

<p>The video begins at a suburban elementary school surrounded by expansive turfed
playing asphalt.  A progression of schools with contrasting school yards are
subsequently visited including a small entirely asphalted elementary school, a
'restored' school yard (previously entirely asphalted), containing several
gardens, an inner city high school with 2,000 students, a rural high school with
numerous playing fields, and a suburban high school.

<p>Students are asked a variety of questions intended to get them to describe their
school yard, express what they like and dislike about it, and finally to
recommend what they could change in it if they could.  The students in the video
were selected by a contact teacher based on their ability to communicate.  In
some schools, they were part of an "environment club", while in others, they were
simply articulate young people with no explicit connection to "the environment' 
In all cases, the students had previewed a video on school yard habitat
restoration from the British organization "Learning through Landscapes"  so that
they had a basis from which to comment on what their school could be like if they
could change something.

<p>Repeatedly, students pointed out short comings of their school yard ranging from
lack of shade and trees, to lack of privacy and places to sit.  Students comments
are refreshingly spontaneous and unpracticed, adding legitimacy to their message.

<p>
<p>

<p>Why Naturalization?
<UL>

<LI>desire for Ecology Club activities
<LI>friendlier school grounds
<LI>need for shade during recesses because of depletion of natural ozone layer
<LI>create own natural outdoor classroom to cut back on field trips
<LI>support curriculum and classroom activities
<LI>learn about and appreciate life, life zones at all levels
</UL>

<p>What do you do with an idea?

<UL>
<LI>tell it to someone so you can share it and spread the word
<LI>get approval of administration, who gets approval and total support of the Board and 		Maintenance Department.  Let them know every step taken, so they can take their 		steps along with you 
<LI>start small, and let it grow as you receive financing, expert advice and people to help 		make the idea a reality
</UL>

<p>Where is help available?

<p>A) Technical:
<UL>
<LI>Ministry of Natural Resources
<LI>Local conservation authority
<LI>naturalist clubs
<LI>local biologists
<LI>engineers
<LI>landscape architects
<LI>nurseries (the more local, the better in most cases)
</UL>

<p>B) Financial
<UL>
<LI>Ministry of Natural resources, through C.W.I.P. grants
<LI>Canada Trust-The Green Foundation
<LI>Lions Clubs
<LI>Shell Canada
<LI>The Evergreen Foundation
</UL>

<p>Expertise and Advice

<p>It is recommended that at least Boards of Educations develop an advisory Board
to guarantee that these things are done once and done correctly.  It is desirable
to have a Board for each school; however, if this is not possible, a Board of
experts at the Board level is feasible. <p>Experts should come from: biologists,
Ministry of Natural Resources (technologists and technicians), parent
representative, school (teacher) liaison, administration of the school,
foresters, landscape designers, native species growers, construction engineer,
good resource books, nursery people.

<p>Possible features to include in naturalization project:

<UL>
<LI>native species of trees, shrubs, plants
<LI>walkways
<LI>benches and picnic tables
<LI>interpretive markers
<LI>wetlands area-ever wonder what to do with the waterholes on the playground? 
<LI>butterfly garden
<LI>a florist
<LI>a pool for frogs and birds
<LI>bird houses
<LI>bird feeders
<LI>trellises
<LI>fences: (for visual or real barriers)
<LI>stores of leaf and wood mulch (Ontario Hydro)
<LI>shade house or nursery area
</UL>

<p>What makes it successful?

<UL>
<LI>student, teacher, parent,  Board,  and administration input and decision making
<LI>a plan to maintain during all seasons
<LI>school's own working tool and equipment
<LI>working hand in hand with maintenance
<LI>thanking volunteers and donors
<LI>publicize success and steps taken: get the media on board
<LI>invite the Board members to visit or participate in several aspects
<LI>a Board of Directors  or a body of experts who will see the project continue, even when 		administration moves from the school.  The project can run with the Board of 			Directors.
<LI>hard work, a willingness to work, someone to organize work sessions.
<LI>use the manual developed by Henry Kock and Steven Aboud

<p>
<H3><center>CREATING A NATURAL OUTDOOR CLASSOOM:</center></H3>
 <H4><center>THE FIRST STEP </center></H4>
<center>Anne Coffey, Green School Project Coordinator</center>

<p>
<p>

<p>Goals
    

<p>The short-term goal is to change behaviors and attitudes towards the natural
	environment by involving school communities in restoring school grounds to
health.

<p>The medium-term goal is to expand these activities, through education and
community involvement, to home owners' property, "waste" or "vacant" lands, and
city parks.

<p>Our long-term goal could probably be nothing less than the Conservation,
Protection 	and Restoration (CPR) of Canada's entire garden.


<p>Achieving Goals

<p>The reinvention of school gardens is a vital step in the process of personal
spiritual 	healing,  human rehabilitation, improved interpersonal
relationships and community renewal.

<p>To gain widespread support for school gardening activities, it has to be
demonstrated 	that human rehabilitation and behavioural modification are
possible through 	horticultural  therapy.  There are many well-documented
examples of how actively 	tending plants, or  simply having a view of a
woodland from a hospital bed or senior's 	home, produces beneficial
physiological and psychological results.

<p> Violence in schools is of widespread concern.  Providing young people with
hands-on opportunities to improve their school environments contributes to
improved behaviors 	 and  attitudes.

<p> At the beginning of the century, the Canadian Council of Women began a
movement to build playgrounds on school property.  In addition to play
structures, the playgrounds 	were to include places for sports, leisure,
crafts and gardening.  Parents reacted	negatively,  and were horrified at the
very idea.  Children, after all, attended school to 	learn, not to play!  It
took  about a decade for the playground movement in Canada to 	be firmly
established.  Nowadays  no one would question the importance of play as an
	indispensable part of learning.

<p>The reduced crime and vandalism levels in areas tapped by the playgrounds
helped to change people's attitudes.

<p>People's attitudes about naturalization can also be changed by demonstrating
how children's  active participation in the creation and maintenance of
school gardens 	reduces antisocial behaviors.

<p>The term "naturalization" is often received with trepidation and suspicion
by the public. Many urban residents believe that municipalities support
naturalizing city parks and 	roadway verges simply to save money.

<p>Schools in areas that oppose naturalizing city parks may find it advisable
to promote 	school gardening instead.  "Naturalization" for some conjures up
images of unkempt 	spaces that provide hiding places for every unsavory
character and animal pest in town.  	Others worry about reduced safety for
children and lower property values.

<p>Playing safe by starting small

<p>To build support for school gardens, it is best to start with low-key, easily
implemented   projects that are unlikely to incur negative reactions, and that
are of benefit to the school and area residents.There is no single fixed approach
to planning school gardens since factors such as the geographic location,
existing programmes, and the ethnic and socio-economic make-up of  any school
community first need to be taken into consideration.

<p>For example, regenerating land adjacent to a woodcut already in existence on
school property  would probably not cause a negative response; however, planning
to create woodland on   part of a ten acre mown field would be likely to set off
all kinds of alarm bells.  Only a few decades ago, gardens used to be an integral
part of school grounds.  The reintroduction of all kinds of gardens including
vegetable, fruit and herb gardens, tree nurseries, rock gardens, recreated wet
land and ponds will provide our urban children with opportunities to forage.

<p>The simple act of foraging -- poking about in the soil, collecting all manner of
living and non-living things, observing the cycles of life, death, decay and
regeneration, and the way in which Nature has a habit of occupying every
available niche -- will probably do more to promote our children's understanding
of interconnectedness and biodiversity than any other activity.

<p>Obstacles

While school ground naturalization is exciting for some, there are others who,
for various reasons, will resist change.The chances are that we are facing
several years of collectively countering opposition from school boards, parents,
women and safety groups, the police, and neighbours.Whatever the degree or kind
of resistance, the main thing to remember is that difficulties can usually be
overcome by taking a consensus-building approach at the outset to involve all
affected parties throughout the process.

Possible areas of resistance:

<p>School Board Plant Maintenance Departments

There is usually a degree of "turf" protection.  Plant's attitude is often
something like: 	"The  school community's concern is either teaching,
learning, supervising or parenting 	and not grounds management".

 The school's "interference" in grounds management is often unwelcome.

<p>Future maintenance costs - eg. tree and shrub pruning, disease control,
leaf raking, 	care  of perennial beds, etc. - are often cited as reasons for
limiting surfaces to grass 	and asphalt.

<p>School grounds maintenance staff are accustomed to the mechanized upkeep
of asphalt 	and combined asphalt and grass surfaces.  Trees are typically
spaced thirty feet apart to 	permit  motorized mowers to drive freely around
them.  The preferred surface is asphalt 	first, grass second, and grass with
trees spaced thirty feet apart third.

<p> Pathways through sodden areas are invariably paved with asphalt.  Often, a
swath 	wider than the path is ploughed and salted in winter by a contractor. 
Narrower, more 	people -  friendly paths have to be cleared by care staff
either with a scoop or a snow-	blower.

<p>In creating a garden where nine tractor tires were used as planters, there
were concerns that a mini Hagersville tire fire would result.  Mowing around the
tires was also cited 	as as a time management problem for staff if the school
community failed to help 	maintain their  garden.

<p>Care Staff

<p>Care staff may be concerned about the additional workload school ground
	transformation could represent:, for example: clearing up the mess such as
muddy 	pathways, mud tracked into school, dirty tools, misplaced or lost
equipment, problems 	with flies caused by improperly managed composters, and
dealing with unwanted 	animals attracted by new habitat.

<p>Wherever low-maintenance becomes higher-maintenance, care staff are
likely to object unless plans are accompanied by a programme to ensure the
long-term participation of 	the school-community.  It's up to participants to
alleviate fears and build trust by 	demonstrating their commitment.

<p>Police and Safety Concerns

<p>Police, teachers and parents are afraid that bushes and long grass will
create hiding 	places for "weirdoes".

<p>Shrubs and trees placed too close to windows can provide hiding places
for break and entry operations.

<p>In Ottawa, police like to be able to drive around school property, shine
their headlights across the grounds, and have a clear view of everything from
their vehicle.

<p>The police have no objection to deciduous trees but prefer not to have
conifers and shrubbery near buildings, footpaths and parking areas.

<p>Fire Department

<p>Fire departments require emergency access to be kept clear.

<p>Neighbours And "Noxious" Plants

<p> Local residents will often be concerned about weeds invading their
property - school boards receive hundreds of calls about dandelions every Spring.

<p>Some plants are undeservedly classified as noxious weeds.  While there was
strong Canadian reaction to the destruction of Monarch butterfly habitat in
Mexico, butterfly weed or milkweed is listed as "noxious" in Ontario.

<p>Sometimes a plant is defined as noxious because it hosts pests detrimental
to food 	crops,  is invasive, or narcotic.

<p>Teachers' Smoking Space

<p>Even when everyone has been included in the planning process, unforeseen
problems 	can arise.  For example, a school garden was planned during the
winter when everyone 	had  forgotten that teachers and care staff used an
adjacent space as a smoking area in 	the warmer  months.

<p>Children wanting to help out with gardening activities at lunch time were
not welcome 	since the teachers did not like them to see them smoking.

<p>The solution involved building a trellis which both served as a screen and
provided a support for climbing plants.

<p>Communications/Promotion

<p>INVOLVE the school community in using the gardens by making jam, wine,
salads 	and teas from plants grown in the school garden; in particular, from
"noxious" plants. (eg. jam, wine,  salads from dandelions, clover, nasturtiums,
pansies, lamb's quarters and garlic greens; crabapple and squash preserves;
pumpkin pie; carrot cake; green tomato pickle; herbal remedies from plants such
as mallow;  teas from rose hips, sumac, sweet fern, linden flowers, etc.)  Flower
petals can be used to colour artwork.  Dyes for dyeing natural fibres can be made
from onion skins, 	walnut leaves, and tiger lily and golden rod flowers. 
Plant exchange and school 	produce days  can be organized.

<p>INFORM people of what you are doing, and why, through newsletters and
media.

<p>ANTICIPATE possibly contentious school grounds projects prior to
implementation 	and gain input from local residents.  Take such opportunities
to provide information on, 	for example, the value of "noxious" plants such as
mild weed or butterfly weed as food 	for Monarch, and Queen Anne's lace for
swallowtails, and also on the benefits of 	animal "pests" such as bats, skunks
and toads.

<p>ENSURE that school newsletters regularly include short articles on the
positive effects school gardening is having on children's attitudes and
behaviours in your school and elsewhere.  Also include information on the
potential for reducing operating costs.

<p>DEMONSTRATE how typical grounds maintenance costs can be avoided. 
	Permaculture methods for bed preparation, such as laying down cardboard to
kill sod, 	mulching on  top and cutting holes in the cardboard when planting,
save the time, 	energy and money  normally expended on digging and rototilling
equipment.  Low-tech 	approaches allow  children to fully participate.

<p>ASSESS the present grounds maintenance costs for future reference including:
grass 	seed  and fertilizer, annual flower beds, mowing and raking, organic
waste disposal, 	vandalism, litter pick-up, snow ploughing, path upkeep, etc.

<p> As behaviours, attitudes and values change, building operating costs may
also be 	reduced. Involving children results in unexpected cost savings
arising from decreases 	in 	garbage generation and energy and water
consumption, fewer acts of vandalism, 	and increased participation in 3Rs
programmes.

<p> OUTREACH to groups less likely to come forward on  their own accord
since the 	skills of  new Canadians coming from farming communities and senior
citizens' local 	gardening  expertise can prove invaluable.

<p>CONTACT local businesses to encourage their involvement.

<p>Are Vegetables Native Species?

<p>Can vegetable gardening lead to the creation of wildlife habitat?

<p>For some schools, vegetable gardening might be the place to start.  The following
was written for the Evergreen Foundation:

<p>The "tractor tire" garden at Charles H. Hulse Elementary School in Ottawa is
ablaze with colourful annuals and perennials donated by Loblaws and a local
nursery.  The tomatoes are ripening, the squash is out of control, broccoli is
sprouting, the other leaves of lush lettuces are being picked daily, and the rose
hips are almost ready for jelly-making.  In the herb garden, the lemon thyme is
threatening to engulf the sage and chives.  A bed  prepared for Autumn planting
has disappeared under a thicket of vigorous weeds which, interestingly, have been
selectively gathered by local ethnic residents, presumably for salad greens.

<p>This garden was specifically designed to pique the interest of the school's
multi-cultural population, many of whom are expert gardeners.  The children, who
speak a total of 46 languages  between them, are enthusiastically engaged in
planting projects, and several contributed plants or seeds brought from home. 
They also assembled the eight outdoor composters used to compost the garden
waste, leaves and grass clippings generated on the school grounds.  During the
Spring term, swarms of children arrived every lunch time to inspect their plants,
pull out weeds, and rake up grass left by the mowers.

<p>Seven months' worth of castings from sixteen school vermi-composters, which
converted all of the organic waste created by 550 children and staff, were used
to fertilize the soil.  The worms also devoured numerous bags of waste
predominantly fruit diet.

<p>A variety of native plants will be added soon: perennials will replace annuals;
trees and shrubs will provide shade an windbreaks as well as food and shelter for
wildlife; and vines such as grapes, bittersweet, Virginia creeper and Dutchman's
pipe will be used to cover bare fencing and walls.

<p>There is a wildflower garden in-the-making, planted in May with a variety of
sprouting, unidentified green things rescued from the school's hedgerows and
playing fields, and now covered with delicate blooms.  Not exactly native, but
nevertheless much esteemed, is an exuberant stand of Himalayan Balsam, alive with
bees and visited frequently by Monarch butterflies.

<p>Also, an area of grass left unmown has a growing population of toads which both
fascinate and repulse children - especially when they learn how many slugs,
caterpillars, grubs, mosquitoes, earwigs and other creatures this amphibian can
eat in a season!

<p>The rationale behind starting to naturalize the schoolyard in this rather
roundabout way, was to create an understanding of the relationship between human
food needs, organic food waste, the land, and the complexity of organisms that
keep soil healthy.  By caring for their worms, children made  excellent soil
conditioner which helped grow food plants whose waste was then fed back to the
healthy soil again .  By experiencing as well as understanding their place in
this cycle of life, death, decay and regeneration, the children are now ready to
respect other creatures' needs and grow a place for them - and for learning about
them - on their school grounds.

<H4>Key Steps In Consensus Building</H4>

<p>There are four basic steps in a consensus process:

<OL>
<LI> Assessment - talking about whether to talk

<LI> Getting started -talking about how to talk

<LI>Running The Process - talking

<LI>Implementing And Monitoring The Results - turning talk into action
</OL>

<p>Identifying the participants

<p>Starting a consensus process requires taking the time to identify the
participants. The task consists of two parts - identifying the interests and then
identifying the appropriate representatives of those interests.

<p>Principle #1: Purpose Driven: people need a reason to participate in the process

<p>The parties should have a common concern and believe that a consensus process
offers the best opportunity for addressing it.  If the parties agree consensus
building offers a better option to pursue their interest, then a greater
commitment to the process and its outcome will be generated.

<p>Principle #2: Inclusive not exclusive

<p>All parties with a significant interest in the issues should be involved in the
consensus process.

<p>Care needs to be taken to identify and involve all parties with a significant
interest in the outcome.  This includes those parties affected by any agreement
that may be reached, those who need to successfully implement it, or those who
could undermine it if not included in the process.

<p>Principle #3: Voluntary Participation.

<p>The parties who are affected or interested participate voluntarily.
<p>
The strength of consensus flows from its voluntary nature.  All parties must be
supportive of the process and willing to invest the time necessary to make it
work.

<p>Principle #4: Self Design

<p>The parties design the consensus process.

<p>All parties must have an equal opportunity to participate in designing the
process.  There is no single consensus process.  Each process is designed to meet
the circumstances and needs of the specific situation.

<p>Designing a consensus process enables the participants to become better
acquainted before they deal with substantive issues.  It is important to take the
time at the beginning to:

<p>define the issues carefully; .   	assess the suitability of a
consensus process for each issue - as opposed to other 	decision-  making
processes; .  	clarify the roles and responsibilities for everyone involved; .
   establish ground rules for operating.

<p>Communications can be helped by establishing ground rules, and by allocating time
for the participants to appreciate each other's values and interests.

<p>Principle #5: Flexibility

<p>Flexibility should be designed into the process.

<p>It is impossible to anticipate everything in a consensus process.  By designing
flexibility into the process, participants can anticipate and better handle
change when it faces them.   A consensus process involves learning from the
perspectives of all participants.  Feedback must, therefore, be continually
incorporated into the process.

<p>Principle #6: Equal opportunity

<p>All parties must be able to participate effectively in the consensus process. 
Unless the process is open, fair and equitable agreement may not be reached and,
if reached, may not last.

<p>Not everyone starts at the same point - particularly in terms of experience,
knowledge and resources.

<p>For example:

<br>the process involves time and expenses - resources that not all
participants may readily afford;

<br>the process revolves around the sharing of information on issues and impacts
- 	something to which not all participants have ready access.

<br>To promote equal opportunity, consideration needs to be given to providing:

<br>training on consensus processes and negotiating skills;

<br>adequate and fair access to all relevant information and expertise;

<br>resources for all participants to participate meaningfully.

<p>Principle #7: Respect for Diverse Interests

<p>Acceptance of diverse values, interests and knowledge of the parties involved in
the consensus process is essential.

<p>A consensus process affords an opportunity for all participants to better
understand one another's diverse values, interests and knowledge.  Recognizing
and addressing all relevant stakeholder's values and interests provides a basis
for crafting creative solutions that are more likely to last.

<p>Principle #8:  Accountability

<p>The participants are accountable both to their constituencies and to the process
that they have agreed to establish.

<p>It is important that the participants representing groups or organizations
effectively speak for the interests they represent.  Mechanisms and resources for
timely feedback and reporting to constituencies are crucial and need to be
established.  This builds understanding and commitment among the constituents and
minimizes surprises.

<p>Given significant public concern about environmental, social and economic issues,
keeping the public informed on the development and outcome of any process is
important.

<p>Principle #9: Time Limits

<p>Realistic deadlines are necessary throughout the process.

<p>Clear and reasonable time limits for working towards a conclusion and reporting
on results should be established.  Such limestones bring a focus to the process,
marshall key resources, and mark progress towards consensus.

<p>Sufficient flexibility, however, is necessary to embrace shifts or changes in
timing.

<p>Principle #10: Implementation

<p>Commitment to implementation and effective monitoring are essential parts of any
agreement.

<p>Parties must be satisfied that their agreements will be implemented.  As a
result, all parties should discuss the goals of the process and how results will
be handled.  Clarifying a commitment to implementing the outcome of the process
is essential.

<p>The support and commitment of any party responsible for follow-up is critical.  A
post-agreement mechanism should be established to monitor implementation and deal
with problems that may arise.

<p>These ten principles have been developed by the Round Tables on the Environment
and Economy in Canada.

<H4><p>Just Imagine ...</H4>

<p>Imagine yourself in a typical school yard.  The forty-five minute lunch break is
just starting.  It is a hot sunny day in May.  You and your friends are in Grade
2 and tend to be quiet and rather afraid of the "big kids" rough play.

<p>It is a Kindergarten to Grade 6 school whose student population is 525.  The
schoolyard is large.  There is hard surface area adjacent to the school.  The
rest of the yard is grass with a small woodlot on the side furthest from the
school building.  The woodlot is out of bounds because of its distance from the
school and the difficulty lunch time monitors would have in adequately
supervising this area.  There is a large shade tree with two giant boulders. 
Like the woodlot, this area is also out of bounds due to its distance from the
school.  There are two play structures, a sand box one shade tree, no seating and
no tables.
<OL>

<LI>In a landscape that offers little choice, where would you choose to play?

<LI>What would you do to avoid high-energy areas used by more-boisterous

traffic, garbage 	cans, seagulls' and dogs' droppings, rotting food)

<LI>How does the presence of litter all over the yard make you feel?

<LI>	Do you think it possible to develop a caring attitude in surroundings that
say "I don't care how much I assault your senses of smell, sight, touch and
hearing with offensive 	smells, ugliness, unnatural hard surfaces and loud

<H4><center> THE NEXT STEP - MAKING THE CONNECTIONS
 </center></H4>
<center>Beth Richardson, Landscape Architect</center>
<p>
<p>



<p>The next step in creating a natural outdoor classroom is to make the
connections that will establish the relationships and find the links that will
bond the connections.  It is these strong connections that will help a
naturalization project to achieve its long term goals, to have lasting power, and
to be a sustainable project.  A few dedicated individuals with a vision can work
hard to start a project - but what will keep that vision strong 10-20 years or
more into the future? Connections!

<p>I want to talk about the schoolyard naturalization project at Ridgeview Public
School - a story about people.  But first, a little history on the project...

<p>Ridgeview Public School in Brampton, Ontario, grades K through 5, is a school
with about 500 families.  The school celebrated its 30th anniversary in September
1993.  It is located in a residential area with a mix of older homes, newer
subdivisions, and also some high-rise apartment buildings.  Ridgeview is situated
on a 5 acre site with a play area that includes asphalt and limestone playground
surfaces with swings and play structures.  This play area is bordered on one side
by the school building and on the other by portable classrooms.  It is typical of
many school playgrounds: hard and somewhat bleak, with the only pleasant aspect
being the sights and sounds of playing children.  In the warmer months this hard
surfaced play area can get extremely hot.  The school site also has a grassy
sports field area of about 300 x 250 feet (91 x 76m), which had only a clump of 3
mature, but majestic Burr Oak trees  prior to the start of our naturalization
project.  In an opposite corner of the school site, behind the portables, is a
meadow, approximately 2700 square feet, which was planted in 1990 as a wildflower
garden by an enthusiastic teacher.  It has progressed through the natural process
of plant communities replacing one another, called succession, from that initial
stage of wildflower garden to its present state today of a second stage meadow.

<p>In 1992, a few parents proposed planting some trees in Ridgeview's playground
to offer some cooling shade and protection from the sun.  As a parent, I wanted
to be involved in a project that would enhance my own child's school experience
as well as offer the community and future students a valuable resource.  As a
landscape architect, I knew there were many more creative possibilities that
could expand the initial idea of tree planting into providing more natural
outdoor spaces for children to play and learn.

<p>Therefore, in 1993, with the restraints of fire lanes, portable access  and
budget in mind, I designed a raised planting area that would offer a
meeting/seating space for students, classes, parents, and community...an oasis
that would support two large trees and a mix of smaller mostly native shrubs (to
maintain visual sight lines across the playground)- a little bit of nature with
some shade in the hard, hot playground.  The 16 x 28 foot, crescent-shaped raised
planter has tiered seating on the inner curve, and although it looks a little
lost in the schoolyard expanse, it is a busy and well-used place.  The inside
border is not planted so that students can use the edges for their own planting
projects.  A grade 5, a 1-2 split grade class and teachers have adopted this area
to care for it.  They are enthusiastic, but their question is "What do we do
now?"

<p>Bennett's Green, as the planter/seating area has been named and dedicated to
the memory of a former school secretary, received a lot of attention and
accolades from the school community and became the impetus for continuing with
the goal of school naturalization at Ridgeview.  With such a small, but visible
project, and enthusiasm running high, it was easier to request monetary support
from the P.T.A., teachers, and community to purchase and plant 10 large 2-1/2"
caliper size native trees for the sports field area in the fall of '93 and spring
of '94.  Although, the majority of parents, teachers and others supported these
projects, it was a small number of individuals who actually did the organizing
and the work -- and even though the students did not directly help to plant, we
planted at times when the children were on the playground, making an event out of
the planting experience.  I feel that the decision to use larger trees, rather
than seedlings, at the initial stage of our project has greatly helped to
maintain the visibility and viability of Ridgeview School's naturalization
efforts.

<p>At this point the connections become important - the "make it or break it"
step: to ensure the sustainability of the project for the future, to get the
students, teachers, parents and community more involved, to foster caring
attitudes and stewardship through pride of ownership.  Right now, before going
any further -- Ridgeview needs to pause, evaluate, plan, and set realistic short
term and long term goals down on paper, and to integrate these goals into the
fibre of the school so that Ridgeview will have a direction for the present, as
well one for new members of the school and community to follow in the future.

<p>FIVE CRUCIAL CONNECTIONS:

<p>1) Connecting Students with the Schoolyard:

<p> A key factor is the involvement of students in planning, digging, planting,
care and evaluation. This is necessary in order to foster pride of ownership
resulting in stewardship        and minimal misuse and vandalism of the
schoolyard areas. One way to get students involved in the planning stage is to
first  discuss with students what they like best about meadows,  forests, ponds
and other natural habitats--evoking memories of   nature walks in nearby park
areas or out in the country,  summer vacations, and schoolyard discoveries--and
then ask the   students to put their thoughts into pictures and words that 
express what they would like their own schoolyard to  look like.  The most
unusual and amazing ideas can be  channeled into realistic directions without
compromising naturalization objectives.

<p>Understand that classroom walls can extend to the outdoors. Older students and
younger students can work and learn  together as buddies.  Grade 5 students at
Ridgeview are helping to dig a multi-use garden for the kindergarten classes. 
The garden will include a Serviceberry, spring bulbs, native plants, and
vegetables. Although it is not a habitat restoration, the multi-use garden brings
the relationships of agriculture, native habitat, and ornamental gardening
together to the learning grounds of the school to help the students understand
the connections.  Having their  own hands-on space to plant and dig will give the
kindergarten children a caring attitude that will stay with them through their
next  5 years at Ridgeview and beyond.

<p>2. Connecting Teachers with the Schoolyard:

<p>Before the teachers can effectively open the doors to the   outdoor classroom,
they need information and practical  knowledge to use for their curriculum
planning.

<p>Set up a resource area in the school library with books,  newsletters and
other sources of information on natural habitats, outdoor environmental
activities, native trees and       plants, etc.  Make it easy to access.  Promote
workshops  such as this one.  Talk to other teachers who have an interest  in
birding, native plant species, butterfly study, and other       topics that could
relate to your naturalization project.  As  a  former teacher, I can relate to
the desire to find ways to enhance and support existing lessons, as well as
introduce         exciting new learning situations.

<p> It might be assumed that all teachers know about the  Carolinian zone, native
habitats, succession, or how to plant a bulb or a bush, what with all this
emphasis on                  environmental awareness, right?  Teachers shouldn't
be reluctant to say they don't know what that "weed patch" over there is good for
(in reference to the meadow).  I have had         teachers ask questions like
"Why doesn't the meadow still have those pretty flowers in it like it did when it
was first planted?" and "How on earth do I connect all this with my unit       on
birds?"  When I start to explain that the meadow's plant diversity is important
to encourage insects that will attract  birds, and ask them to take a closer look
at the textures and  colour variations of the plants and grasses (or so called
weeds) throughout the seasons, a new interest and better understanding starts to
take place. Interpretation is              important, and the connection between
seeing and understanding  comes from knowledge.

<p>Teachers can study along with the students while making trail guides and
interpretive material for different grade levels, and for the community.  Put up
signs that welcome all    into the various naturalized and garden areas.  We are
trying to make our meadow at Ridgeview more user friendly and accessible with
paths, sitting logs for outdoor study and contemplation, as well as planning to
provide signage and  interpretive guides.

<p>3. Connecting the Parents with the School and Schoolyard:

<p> hope most of you have parents active in your schools.  At  Ridgeview this
project would not have gotten off the drawing board without parents. Parents
volunteer their ideas,  talents, time, and labour, to make Ridgeview a school
active  in many areas.  All parents need to be kept informed and, if they desire,
to be welcomed as participants in projects such as schoolyard naturalization.
School newsletters, student newspapers, planned activities with students,
parents, and teachers...in other words: communication and cooperation are the
links that make the  connections strong.

<p>4. Connecting the Local Community with the School:

<p>Reach out to the local community with information and through personal
contact.  Whether Ridgeview families, families of  students attending other
schools, or retired people--we need to let them know what our project is all
about.  Continue  to include school community neighbours in ongoing plans.

<p>At Ridgeview when the meadow was planted in 1990, the teacher who organized
the project went to the houses of the neighbours that had backyards bordering the
proposed meadow or wildflower  garden (as it was originally called), and informed
the people  of his intentions.  The teacher relates that he received  positive
support from the neighbours.  When the teacher left the school the following
year, there wasn't any plan or stated       objectives in place that would have
helped other teachers take over the care and development of the wildflower
garden.  The garden naturally went into the next stage of succession which meant
it looked less like a garden and more like a  natural meadow, causing teachers'
and neighbours' perceptions  about the garden/meadow to change.  The edges of the
maturing meadow were not well-defined by mowing or by fence, nor were       paths
maintained, nor other means taken to show that this  meadow was a desirable,
natural place. 

 <p>The meadow was labeled a weedy eyesore, and while teachers were
wondering what to do,  an anonymous neighbour complained to the City, with the
result  that last fall the City came on to the school property without 
permission or the principal's knowledge and mowed the meadow flat.  Although the
City was trespassing, the noxious weed         bylaw was used as the basis for
doing so.  We are lucky that   herbicide was not used, and this past spring the
meadow sprang  back.  Presently, I am working with a teacher who has taken an 
interest in maintaining the Ridgeview meadow and who will help to define the
short and long term goals and objectives for the meadow. This will include plans
for interpreting the natural  processes to teachers, parents and the neighbouring
community.       Increasing opportunities to attract birds and butterflies
through the addition of typical native meadow plants for  butterfly larvae, for
seed and fruit desired by birds, will   also be part of next springs' activities.
 The grade five students are researching those plant species with their  younger
buddies in grades 2,3 and 4 throughout the winter.

<p>The term "wildflower garden" will be changed in name to "Ridgeview meadow". 
Many people's perception of a "garden" is that of a neat and tidy area - a more
cultivated space with  lots of flowers (or vegetables) in rows or clumps. 
Ridgeview's  meadow will be a lot easier to understand when we can use the 
correct word to explain what it is all about.

<p>5. Connecting the School with the Neighbourhood Natural Areas

<p>Using the nearby natural areas as resources for study and observation will
help students, teachers, and parents compare what's happening in their own
schoolyard's developing natural areas with the larger neighbourhood habitats.

<p>Students can use the local areas as sources for native seed collection in a
responsible way: understanding the need for collecting small numbers of seeds
without destroying either  plants or habitats, which can then be used for
studying and growing locally adapted native plants for use in the schoolyard
naturalization projects.

<p>Students are usually very enthusiastic about hands-on study  and take much
pride in learning by doing.  One recent project  by a second grade class at
Ridgeview involved a walk to a  local park and meadow area to collect seeds and
leaves.  The  teacher planned this project even though she later confessed to me
that it was hard for her because she doesn't know the  identity of a lot of
plants.  With a parent volunteer, small  groups of students went to the library,
and with the help of the librarian and a selection of books, identified most of
the collected seeds and leaves.  The parent volunteer also said  she learned
quite a bit from this exercise.  The students proudly displayed their mounted and
identified seeds and   leaves at a school assembly.  When I asked the teacher a  
couple of days later if I could take a picture of the students with their
project, the teacher informed me that the project   had been loved to death and
the seeds had all crumbled from  the touching and examining by the children.  I
think it is better for the project to have been really used than for the mounted
seeds / leaves to be relegated to a "no touch" display in the corner of the room
left to gather dust.  Next year that same class can go back to the meadow and
know what kinds of seeds to gather for a native plant nursery at Ridgeview.

<p>6 Connecting the School with Other Schools

<p>Projects and ideas can only flourish and maintain stronger connections if
planning is not  done in a vacuum.  Observing and communicating with other
schools and individuals who are  involved in naturalization projects, no matter
how dissimilar, is crucial for long term sustainability.  That's why we are at 
this Learning Grounds conference today.  But don't keep this knowledge to
yourself.  Knowledge and communication are the  links to bonding the connections.
 When you return to your  school and your community, talk with other teachers, 
administrators, parents, and by all means, with the students.  You will be able
to approach your successes with pride and  your problems with fresh, creative new
solutions.  You may think I'm talking about something you already know to be
true, but after  being closely involved with a project, and busy with work and my
family, I think we all need to be reminded to step back and  take a look around,
once in awhile.  I know I need to remind myself.  Also, many colleagues, clients
and others depend upon you to be an important resource.  Visit the school often
and get to know the teachers and students better.

<p>7. Connecting the School with Future Generations

<p>This is where the circle of connections links up with the   local community. 
This is the point where we see how  connections create a sustainable project,
thus endowing our        children with the ability and understanding to care for
their school, neighbourhood, country, and future families...which brings their
stewardship back to the community.  The school is the hub of a young person's
life for many years and the pride that students develop in themselves and their
school is  crucial to learning and attitudes.  Can we help our children to take a
greater stewardship approach towards the earth than our generation has?  I hope
so, for their sake.  Let's start small, at all the schools...in all the
communities...let's  make the next step a lasting one.

<p>
<H3><center>SCHOOLYARD TOUR 
</center></H3>
<center>Lyn Hanna-Folkes, Education Director, Hamilton Naturalists Club</center>
<p>
<p>

 
<p>This tour focused on naturalizations at urban elementary schools in Hamilton-Wentworth.  St. Patrick's School started one of the first naturalization projects in the Region in the spring of 1992.  In one month, students and staff transformed the entire school yard from a monoculture of sod into various kinds of gardens.  Although a low maintenance approach was recommended by Hamilton Naturalist's Club members, some high maintenance annual, herb and vegetable gardens were incorporated into St. Patrick's plan.  With an encouraging principal, a committed school spirit, and an enthusiastic custodian, the school has managed their project well.

<p>Changes have been made since the original plan was implemented and the current plan is flexible.  At St. Patrick's School the herb garden was used as an annual and perennial bed in 1994 and they are also considering adopting more low maintenance practices for their butterfly habitat.  This should be an exciting time in the naturalization process.  The original plan has been implemented and now new interesting ideas can be incorporated -- gradual modifications and improvements make the project sustainable and manageable.  

<p>This naturalization project had many benefits for the school and community.  The appearance of the school yard was enhanced.  A better buffer from traffic noise and pollution was created.  One student's father worked outside, together with his son,  for the first time.  Seating areas were created along East Street by using recycled telephone poles as a frame for flower beds.  Members of the church next door and neighbours helped by donating plants and providing labour.  The school gained much media attention and attained further funding from various agencies and resources from many community groups and businesses.  So many very different people contributed and were happy working together to improve the quality of life in their neighbourhood -  and for their children at school.

<p>Responses to some questions asked by tour members:  

<p>Q: How are the naturalized areas on the school yard maintained?  

<p>A:  In 1992, one very energetic teacher supervised the naturalization project at this school, and she had the students do all of the naturalization activities - they prepared the soil, dug, planted, composted, did crafts, wrote stories and poems, etc.  When that teacher was transferred to another school and no system was in place to continue the project, the custodian was happy to take care of the school yard.  Now the students do some outdoor extracurricular activities but the custodian has really taken ownership.  The school has recently formed a new team, however, and hopefully they will  find imaginative ways to integrate the naturalization project into the regular school curriculum.  In the future, the students should be doing most of the maintenance activities as part of their education in the outdoor classroom.   In Britain some schools run small farms,  so we are capable of managing naturalized school grounds with a little more organization.  We're learning exciting things with each new project because they are all so different. 
 
<p>Q:  Is vandalism a problem?

<p>A:  Some plants on the corner of King and East Streets were damaged, so they were replaced with prickly shrubs.  Surprisingly, more vandalism has occurred at rural schools.  It certainly helps that the people in and around this school take pride in their project and don't want to see it vandalized.

<p>Q:  Where did they get the plants from?

<p>A:  Many of the annual and perennial plants that are not native to Ontario were donated by friends, neighbours, and the Royal Botanical Gardens.  The native plants that have a higher wildlife value were either purchased from a nursery that sells native plants or they were rescued from a development site by volunteers.  More and more nurseries sell native plants and seed mixtures but someone who can identify the plants and knows reliable sources for plant material should be consulted.  Many schools in this area call the Hamilton Naturalists Club for assistance in planning their habitat and purchasing the best plants for their purposes.

<p>Q:  How was the soil modified for the natural habitats?

<p>A:  The school compost and donated manure, leaves and compost were applied manually.  Soil for shrub and forest habitats often needs enrichment but the area for a butterfly habitat should not be high in nitrogen and is preferably well drained (sandy rather than clay).  Certain plant species are more suitable for clay soils (which are common in the Hamilton area).  It is always best to choose a suitable habitat for the conditions on your school yard rather than trying to modify those conditions.

<p>Q:  How could the butterfly habitat be changed to make it a lower maintenance area?

<p>A:  Currently, each plant in the butterfly habitat is dug into its own small hole which is surrounded by sod.  This planting technique requires individual weeding, watering, and continual sod removal for each flower and shrub.  The maintenance staff must also mow around each individual plant - very time consuming and increases fuel or hydro use.  If one manageable area had been cleared of sod, and planted (and/or seeded) more densely,  then the area could be maintained as a whole, with much less time and effort.
		
	<p>The next stop on this field trip was at Stinson Street School, still in downtown Hamilton, where pavement was removed to plant two trees.  Pavement removal is very expensive but this school was lucky to find some volunteers to do most of the work at no cost. 
 
	<p>One of the trees planted was a Norway Maple which is becoming a pest in natural areas because it can outcompete our native trees in growth and germination rates.  Nurseries often recommend Norway Maples and other aggressive non-native tree species because they can tolerate city conditions well and grow quickly.  There are native trees that also tolerate city conditions, however, and really, how important is fast growth?  If nurseries can grow trees quickly, they can sell more trees, and make more money.  So, they are not always recommending a Norway Maple in your best interest.  

	<p>What about other tree characteristics such as:  appearance, educational value, ecological benefits, and the ability to grow smaller plants beneath a tree?  The school asked for a tree that would provide some shade but the plan also included growing shrubs beneath the tree.  This was not considered by the nursery salesperson.  All trees provide some shade but Norway Maples provide so much shade, and have such a dense and shallow root system, that few plants can survive under their canopy.  Perhaps a better choice could have been made if the school consulted a non-profit environmental group, a nursery that sells only native plants, or a specialist in natural restoration projects at a university or college. 
 
	<p>In crowded school yards, it is beneficial to buy a large tree that can survive the scrutiny of many curious children and cannot be broken or vandalized as easily.  All trees planted in less than preferable conditions are going to die some day, so why not choose one that will offer benefits that are much more interesting than "fast growth" while it lives in your community.  For example, choose a tree that helps migrating birds by providing food for them at a time of year when less food is available and teach your students about migrating birds.

	<p>The next naturalization project visited was at St. Eugene School where a recycling minded environmental team helped to transform a courtyard that contained a large tunnel surrounded by patio stone pavement into a green oasis.  The custodian, Mike Blanche, was active in the project and was present to answer questions (the Principal would have attended but was transferred to another school recently).  This naturalization includes a small pond, trees, shrubs, raised beds for native flowering plants, a composter, interesting seating ideas, a path, bird feeders, some sod for heavy traffic areas, and a statue with plants surrounding it.  The benches were constructed using wood from the tunnel that was removed.  Patio stones were lifted and used around the pond and for the path.  Old telephone poles were cut and installed vertically to make flower beds and seating areas.  The recycling theme was impressive.

	<p>St. Eugene also did a thorough inventory before making naturalization plans.  As a result, they were made aware of an area of bare earth that was home to an insect called, "Sweet Bees."  (They called the University of Guelph's Entomology Department and described their findings.)  The bees are common in the area but presented a wonderful learning experience for all.  The area was seeded (on expert advice) but remains undisturbed so the harmless Sweet Bees can continue their business of surviving and doing a little pollinating - a benefit for the plants in the courtyard.   

<p>Questions and comments:

<p>Q: Where do the schools get their funding from?

<p>Mainly, Canada Trust, Shell, The Evergreen Foundation, and from participating in environmental walkathons.  The Hamilton-Wentworth area holds an annual Walkathon for the Environment in June, from which students can use the money they raised for their school's environmental projects.  One school even held their own walkathon.

<p>2.  Why was non-native grass incorporated in the courtyard plan - it is not really appropriate for a naturalization is it?

	It wasn't originally.  The plan was designed so that a certain number of students could fit comfortably into the courtyard using pathways.  The original plan was modified later to include some sod areas for more standing and sitting room.  In this way, a whole class could be held in the naturalized area.  (This may have been encouraged by a shortage of funds at some point.)

	Plans are often designed by a volunteer with naturalization experience and are to be used by the school as a guideline.  Other than the recommended plant species for different areas, the plan can be modified to fit the needs of the school.  Sometimes inappropriate plants are used but this is eventually realized and is part of the educational process.  'Mistakes' are often disguised 'learning opportunities'.  In the future, when they obtain more funding, maybe St. Eugene will consider replacing their Kentucky Blue Grass mix with some lower maintenance native ground cover that has more value to the local native wildlife they may attract (it could still be grasses).

	Inappropriate plants are also donated by generous people who want to help the school.  This can be dealt with in different ways.  If you can't refuse a gift, build a separate flower bed specially for donated plants.  While the plants grow in the 'donated plants' bed you can take time to identify them, research their educational value, and make a decision about the plant.  Can you incorporate it into your natural area or should it stay in the 'donated plants' bed where it won't become unmanageable?  Maybe it is a plant that has educational value because of its negative traits.  For example, Purple Loosestrife is grown in some home gardens but is aggressively invading our wetlands.  So, teach the students about it and how to identify it, and then burn it to show them that it is not a welcome part of any naturalization project.  Make sure that the students and the donor are aware of the detrimental affects that this plant has on our wetlands so that they understand why we should not grow it.  The donor may be upset but still thank you for informing them.


<H4>SCHOOLYARD TOUR #2</H4>


	<p>This tour focused on naturalizations at rural elementary schools in Hamilton-Wentworth.  The students and staff at Millgrove Public School have been creating a deciduous forest habitat  including native species that are restricted to the "Carolinian Zone" in their backyard since April 1993.  This project has progressed very well with the participation of students, teachers, the custodian & maintenance personnel, parents, student teachers, friends, neighbours, and outside technical  experts.  The support of the principal, funding agencies, and local businesses has made this naturalization project come together successfully.  Mary Kisch, the teacher coordinating the project team at Millgrove, was present to describe the naturalization and answer questions.  

<p>Responses to some questions asked by tour members: 
 
<p>Q Since the natural area is far from the school, how much interaction with students is there?  

<p>A:  Daily; the students use the entire playground and are attracted to the naturalized area.

<p>Q:  Is the natural area included in the school curriculum?

<p>A:  Yes, many teachers have used the natural area as an outdoor classroom for environmental studies, English, art, and game activities; students from McMaster University are helping to fit the environment into the curriculum; volunteer "experts" from the University of Guelph and the Hamilton Naturalists' Club have worked with the students in the natural area and given slide presentations; held an environmental fair with outdoor planting activities; relevant reference books were purchased for the library; an employee of the RBG made signs to identify the plants

<p>Q:  Are there plans for more seating areas in the schoolyard?

<p>A:  A friend donated a cedar bench and a stump for the children to sit on but more seating is necessary and there are plans for more benches.

<p>Q:  Why is the natural area fenced off?

<p>A:  A temporary snow fence was installed to protect the plants until they become established.  The children are free to enter the area through a gate until the fence is removed.

<p>Q:  What do the neighbours [with the adjacent manicured lawn] think about the project?

<p>A:  With their own garden hose, the neighbours water the plants whenever they are too dry.  This is appreciated very much during the summer when school is out.

<p>Q:  Is the grass creeping into the natural area a problem?

<p>A:  Yes, the grass creeps quickly along underneath the mulch but we have been efficient in pulling it out so far.  Some type of border between the grass and the mulched area is being considered.  

<p>Q:  Is vandalism a problem?

<p>A:  No, the signs identifying the plants are moved around sometimes but we move them back again.  

<p>Some things that the students and teachers have learned from their project:
<OL>
<LI>root beer flavour originally came from sassafras roots.
<LI>how to work together cooperatively.
<LI>how to problem solve (ie. bucket brigade game to water the plants).
<LI>how to use compost.
<LI>how to plant trees, shrubs and flowers.
<LI>about worms.
<LI>to write and read stories about nature, composting, etc.
<LI>ownership and responsibility (ie. students want to help weed during their recess time).
<LI>older students have learned to teach the younger students.
<LI>to give tours.
<LI>about dedicating a planted tree to a special person.
<LI>to enjoy nature.
<LI>to identify plants.
<LI>what native plants provide food for birds.
<LI>about gardening, and students want to garden at home with their parents.   
</OL>

<p>Although a lot has been accomplished at Millgrove both inside and outside the school, the method made the project manageable.  Here are some of the things that the Millgrove Team did to make their naturalization project easier and more educational:

<OL>
<LI>started with a plan.
<LI>involved the whole school.
<LI>consulted other schools that had started naturalization projects.
<LI>consulted naturalization experts before purchasing plants so careful choices were made 	to maximize the value of the natural area for educational purposes.
<LI>informed the neighbours and involved them in the project right from the start.
<LI>they were organized.  Anticipated funding was allotted to part of the plan before the	funding was obtained - they were prepared for activities in advance and were always 	aware of something that was needed as a next step (ie. the mulch was there and ready to 	apply soon after the ground was cleared, avoiding unmanageable weed invasions).
<LI>a dedicated organizational team was formed with a teacher coordinating the team.
<LI>the students were involved right from the start, so educational benefits were worked 	into the entire process (and still are as the process continues). 
<LI>a pathway was installed as part of the plan before planting, so plant trampling and 	overgrowth of the path in the long run would be avoided.
<LI>when advice was asked for, constructive criticism was accepted openly, advice was 	taken seriously, and these continue to be acted on.
<LI>the project was started and continued in a gradual, and therefore,  a sustainable manner.  	In this way the work was enjoyable, there was time for learning, and the school will 	continue the project from a positive perspective.
</OL>

<p>The next stop on this field trip was at a development site on Parkside Drive in Flamborough, where mature forest was cleared in order to build residential housing and a new fire hall.  Plants were rescued before the forest was cleared and some of these were planted as part of a naturalization project at Flamborough Centre School.  

	<p>The Hamilton Naturalists' Club would rather see some of these mature habitats preserved than have to rescue the few plants that we can manage.  The developers and land owners could be more flexible in their planning of communities and incorporate some natural habitat as an aesthetically pleasing area for the residents.  There is fear mounting that if plant rescues become more common, then developers will use plant rescues as a mediation measure for developing -- "the plants will be rescued so we can clear the forest with a clear conscience?"  The problem with this attitude is that you can never replace an ecosystem, and every ecosystem and habitat is unique -- clear it and it is gone forever along with most of the inhabitants.  Before the Hamilton Naturalists' Club conducts a plant rescue, therefore, we find out if the area is in imminent threat of destruction before obtaining permission to rescue any plant life.

	<p>The next naturalization project visited was at Flamborough Centre School where a habitat for birds and butterflies has been created.  This was one of the first projects in the Hamilton-Wentworth region (started in 1992) and so many learning opportunities presented themselves. 
 
	<p>The project started out very well.  The habitat was planned and created carefully,  consulting experts and involving many people within the school and community.  It was cost effective with many expensive items and much labour donated.  The students held an opening ceremony for their habitat which they named, "For the Birds."  They wrote songs and poems about the project and gained media attention.  It was a great success but was eventually neglected.  

	<p>The neglect occurred for several reasons:  only one teacher was involved in coordinating the project and it became overwhelming when she took ill; the project was considered short term - it was done and "finished" in one month in order to have a demonstration project for other schools to see; there was minimal support after the habitat was finished and neglected; no plans were made to involve the naturalization in the school curriculum; the natural area was far from the school and ignored by students after "completion";  maintenance was not kept up; expert advice was not followed promptly enough; and vandalism became a problem.

	<p>Although the butterfly habitat was maturing fairly well, the shrub portion of the habitat was lost to vandals, weeds and grass that grew back in quickly.  Then it was mowed by the grass cutters.  What was learned and what can be done?  

	<p>Correcting vandalism swiftly may deter vandals because they don't get their kicks observing the damage they did for long.  Also, plant thorny shrubs that vandals can't touch or walk through easily.  If the habitat was closer to the school there may have been less vandalism, more interaction and, therefore, more care and maintenance.  A weedy area, if left unattended to worsen, will cause a loss of interest in the project because it appears unmanageable.  Neighbours will have complaints if they are not properly informed in advance and if bad weeds are not attended to.  It is too much to ask of one teacher to be in charge of all activities related to a naturalization project, so schools now adopt a team approach.  Also, the project takes commitment, energy, and enthusiasm from the whole school.  Everyone needs to take part and be responsible in a positive educational light.  We are learning, and more and more schools are eager to take a careful, long-term, sustainable approach to naturalizing their school grounds.

<p>Questions and comments were similar to those at Millgrove School with the following exceptions:

	<p>There was a discussion about vandalism which included those points mentioned above as well as using signage to explain the project goals to passers by.  If neighbours understand the project well, they are more likely to discourage and/or report vandals.

	<p>Since weeds were noticed at this school, there were questions about weed regulations.  Land owners can be fined for allowing ragweed, Canada thistle and other species of weeds to grow on their property because they are considered agricultural pests.  A list of these illegal weeds can be obtained from the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food.

	<p>Fortunately, Ted Cheskey was present as a tour member to answer questions about creating prairie habitats.  He said that prairie plants will compete well with weeds so the best approach is to start with a weed-free area, sow seed and/or plant prairie species, then do not disturb the soil by weeding manually.  It is more effective to kill weeds by preplanned burns which will not harm the prairie plants.  If you are planning a prairie habitat, you need to consult with an expert, like Ted, on prairie restoration techniques.

	<p>One tour member asked me, as a private landscaper, what I would do if a neighbour complained about a plant from one of my naturalization projects spreading into their yard. I  I have not had a complaint yet.  I would welcome the opportunity to educate that neighbour about naturalizations or at least about the plant that had seeded into the neighbour's yard  I choose plants carefully and create barriers along property lines just so neighbours won't have their adjacent lawn "invaded."  I don't want to create negative attitudes.  I want people to be curious about naturalized yards in a positive or at least a neutral perspective.

<p>Concluding Quote:

"<p>We must build landscapes that heal, connect, and empower, that make intelligible our relations with each other and with the natural world: places that welcome and enclose, whose breaks and edges are never without meaning.  Nature parks cannot do this work.  We urgently need people living on the land, caring for it, working out an idea that includes human culture and human livelihood.  All this calls for a new culture of nature, and it cannot come soon enough."

<p>Developing realistic time lines, responsibilities, and school and community partnership.

<p>Decisions! Decisions! Decisions!
<UL>
<LI>	Why are you developing the site? 
<LI>	Where is the site to be developed?
<LI>	How large is the area? 
<LI>	Are there any features that will need to go?
<LI>	Are there any features that you definitely want to keep? 
<LI>	What type of site are you planning? Natural, semi-natural, or structural/formal?
<LI>	How many people are involved in making decisions?
<LI>	How much maintenance will be required? Who will be doing it?
<LI>	How will the neighbouring property owners be affected?  How do they feel about your 	plans?  
</UL>

<p>The Development of ENSTAR ( ENvironmental STudy ARea) at Palmerston P.S.

<UL>
<LI>	Planning began in the Fall of 1990. Actual work on site began in Spring 1992.
<LI>	Goal to develop site over period of five years.
<LI>	Involvement of local nurseries to help plan sections of site
<LI>	Local (and not so local) businesses approached for the donation of materials and/or 	equipment.
<LI>	PEG (Palmerston Environmental Group, the school club) sold seeds and mini-	greenhouses as fundraising for some start-up funds.
<LI>	Grant for major purchase of chainlink fence from Shell Environmental Fund
<LI>	"Help Sheets" for parents and community members for rototilling and donations of 	trees/shrubs. Sheets part of a called "Message from PEG" distributed to all students and 	businesses in town.
<LI>	Certificates of Appreciation and badges awarded to all Patrons.
<LI>	Peggy and Pokey, our two club mascots, held poster contest to keep environmental 	interests in students' minds.
<LI>	PEG helped every student in school start seeds to go into the flower beds at ENSTAR
<LI>	Approached a Horticultural Society to see if members were interested in acting as 	planting partners to help students plant seedlings.
<LI>	PEG took part in local Environmental Fair and set up display about ENSTAR and other 	concerns.
<LI>	Tree planting on a local farm and finished by starting several nursery sections in 	ENSTAR.
<LI>	PEG held our own Environmental Fair on Earth Day, 1993 for the Official Opening of 	ENSTAR.  We invited all the schools in the county to send representatives, and all 	Patrons were invited. We had newspapers and TV coverage of our day.
<LI>	Continue to evaluate, and add  to site.
<LI>	Work sessions to remove dandelions and seed heads (Milkweed and thistle to keep the 	neighbours happy, and Purple Coneflower, Monarda, etc. for next year's plantings and 	expansion)

<p>SCHOOL YARD REGENERATION (PRIMARY-JUNIOR-INTERMEDIATE)

<p>Objectives:

<p>To provide first-hand learning opportunities for Environmental / Outdoor Education on the school site
<br>To give students the opportunity to understand the need for wildlife habitat, and thereby develop an appreciation and respect for living things
<br>To allow students to have a positive impact on their environment
<br>To provide a pleasing natural environment and set an example for others

<p>What Can Be Accomplished:
<br>The closer your school yard is to a native habitat, like a woodlot or field, the more wildlife you can expect to find visiting your property. Along with the native plant life students will have an opportunity to view a variety of birds, insects, and other small creatures.  Keep the project simple. Don't try to accomplish too much at once, but rather phase the changes in over a number of years. Your regeneration area can be constantly growing and improving.

<p>Developing a Wildlife Habitat
<br>The basic requirements for a wildlife habitat are food, water and shelter.

<p>Provide a Variety of Plants
<br>To ensure there is the diversity of food and shelter needed for a wide range of wildlife.

<p>Plant in Patches and Clumps
<br>Shelter is best provided by planting shrubs and trees in natural-looking clumps, hedgerows and thickets. Leave open areas of grasses and flowers between the clumps.

<p>Provide Layers of Plants
<br>Food and shelter should be provided in a wide range of levels by using grass, flowers, shrubs, small and large trees. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources offers up to 100 conifer and 200 deciduous tree seedlings to schools at no cost. Call your district office for details.

<p>Use Native Plants
<br>Generally speaking, native plants are adapted better to the local climate and soil conditions, are more resistant to disease and pests, and cost less to purchase and maintain. Local wildlife is adapted to these native plants since they make up their natural habitat.

<p>Avoid Chemicals
<br>Synthetic fertilizers and pesticides promote lush plants, but kill many organisms that are vital to the natural processes of pollination and decay. These organisms are also food for wildlife. Plant hardy native species, and use compost to fertilize them. Use mulch to retain moisture, and hand weed if necessary.

<p>Aim for Low Maintenance
<br>Let leaves remain in your habitat because they provide nutrition for both plants and wildlife. Decaying leaves also contain insect pupae, spider eggs, seeds, and old berries which can be food sources for birds migrating in spring. Avoid trimming the lower branches of shrubs and trees to leave more shelter for wildlife. The use of herbs and annuals will require yearly maintenance, while a habitat using true native species will become self-sustaining. The habitat should not be attached to any single individual. It must continue to exist even if that initiating teacher leaves.

<p>Water Sources
<br>A bird bath, or other container to catch rainwater will enhance the habitat. The inclusion of water need not be elaborate or extensive.

<p>HOW TO PROCEED IN SCHOOL YARD REGENERATION

<p>Get Permission
<br>The support of your school administration and the Board is essential to the success of this project. Also, the support of other staff members and the general student population will lessen complaints about the project and instances of vandalism.
<br>Check municipal regulations regarding planting near lot lines and species classified as noxious weeds. (e.g. Horticulturists view Golden Rod as a native species, but others view it as a weed.)
<br>Hold a public information meeting. Invite all the parents and neighbours to explain the project and receive their input. This reduces the likelihood of complaints and may turn up expertise, volunteers, or financial support.
<br>Apply for funding.

<p>Survey Your School Yard
<br>Make a drawing on graph paper showing existing buildings (and portables) and structures such as climbing apparatus.
<br><Mark on the locations of power lines (overhead or underground), water and sewer mains, telephone cables, tile beds and septic tanks (you will need to contact Bell, Ontario Hydro and the gas company).
<br>Indicate existing plants, shrubs and trees, which could be integrated into the nature garden.
<br>Map the soil type. (Clay soil clumps together when squeezed, sandy soil is loose and course, well drained soil holds little water even after a heavy rain).
<br>Draw in the paved or asphalt areas, and other areas necessary for recreation (such as ball fields).
<br>Indicate land uses adjacent to the school yard, such as streets, private yards, or wild fields.
<br>Indicate any fenced boundaries.
<br>Show approximate dimensions of the yard.
<br>Make note of significant slopes or contours.
<br>Indicate 'North'.

<p>Select a Regeneration Site
<br>Choose a site away from heavy use, noisy areas and places where snow containing salt is commonly deposited.
<br>Try to have a mixture of light and shade in your nature garden to support a variety of plant types.
<br>Consider how the site will be watered (barrels for rain collection may be useful).
<br>Consider the possibility of a "Friendship Garden". If the school is adjacent to a senior citizens' home or hospital, an intergenerational partnership can be formed.

<p>Make a List
<br>List the wildlife you would like to attract (research what plants provide food for them).
<br>List all the plants you wish to have in your nature garden (research what is the natural vegetation).
<br>List other items that will be required such as bird feeders, bird baths and wildlife platforms.

<p>Developing a Planting Plan
<br>Unless you are a trained horticulturist, landscape architect or experienced gardener, you will probably need assistance at this point. Take your preliminary plan, and the description of the growing conditions (soil, light, contours, and so on) to an expert. Consult with your local garden centre staff, the Hamilton Naturalists Club or Horticultural society for professional advice.
<br>Remember to consider phasing the project. That way there will be less immediate financial expenses, the manual labour can be spaced over a period of time, a greater number of students can become involved, and the project can be adjusted and altered as it progresses.

<UL>
<LI>Energy during projects goes up and down 
<LI>High energy at the beginning -take advantage of this: sign up volunteers, do 	presentations for the community to
spread interest and solicit more help
<LI> Arts projects, kid's performances,
community plantings etc.  generate lots of energy and visibility
<LI>First project or phase needs to be a crowd pleaser -visible, fun, hands-on
<LI>Use energyfrom these events to sustain volunteers through low energy times - winter,
	fundraising, grant writing 
<LI>Try to schedule high profile events a few timesper year - space them out so the 	momentum carries on
<LI> Realize that people willburn out or want to move on
<LI> As children graduate from the school, their parents
usually move on to other projects, 	so make  an effort to recruit JK and SK
parents to your group
</UL>


<p>CONNECTING WITH THE CURRICULUM


<p>Teaching about the environment has many similarities with teaching reading - it
must not be seen as only a school subject.  It must connect with all aspects of a
child's life.  Therefore parents and home need to be involved.

<p>Ways to involve parents:<br> Help in classroom<br> Help with planting, maintenance and
harvesting<br> Garden club for parents <br>Info re:  recycling, organic gardening, wise
water use, alternatives for pesticides and  	toxic cleaners that can be used
at home

<p>Ways to promote environmental teaching throughout the curriculum:

<p> Arts projects- very powerful tool - use local artists, parents, Artists in
the School grants, Inner  City Angels etc.
<bRrStart a garden or environmental club
for students - at lunch or after school- some 	funding available through After
Four programs - have this club give reports or 	presentations at  school
assemblies or P.A. announcements Hold special events i.e. plantings,
celebrations, theatrical presentations etc. and invite	the whole school
community and the neighbourhood 
<br>Start a recycling and compost program at lunch -
should be carried out by the students 	and include the teacher's lunchroom Do
regular litterless lunch presentations and tote your own trash days Involve
classes in sorting, weighing, tabulating and graphing results
 <br>I wrote curriculum
binders for each class in the school, however they have not 	been 	used
much - teachers seem to be overwhelmed by written material - far more effective
to go into the class and offer to do an activity
<br> Get on the staffing committee
for your school - designate the "resource" position as environmental education
<br>Start an environmental resource centre in the school library

<center>Barbara McKean

Plant Ecologist</center>
<p>
<p>



<p>As part of a world wide network of 600 botanical gardens, Royal Botanical
Gardens has its mission:

<p>"...to be recognized in Canada and throughout the world for our unique
contribution to the collection, research, exhibition and interpretation of the
plant world, and the development of public understanding and appreciation of the
relationship between the plant world, humanity, and the rest of nature."

<p>While the purpose of our collections vary from genus-specific grouping to
thematic displays, this tour focused on the latter.  Participants examined
several collections that have a strong overview of plant science and the Wild
Life Garden (a display featuring plants that attract wild life.)

<p>The major focus for the tour however, was Project Paradise, RBG's marsh
restoration programme.  The goal of Project Paradise is the restoration of over
200 hectares of self-sustaining submergent and emergent marsh habitat in Cootes
Paradise; a Class 1 wetland and a Provincial Area of Natural and Scientific
Interest (ANSI).  It is part of the $20  million Fish and Wildlife Habitat
Restoration Plan, developed as one component of the Hamilton Harbour Remedial
Action Plan (under auspices of the International Great Lakes  Joint Commission).

<p>In the early 1800's this marsh was vegetate, and considered to be one of the
most outstanding natural areas yet encountered in Canada.  The degradation of
wetland habitat.  has been due to a number of factors, including nutrient loading
from sewage, sedimentation resulting from erosion in the surrounding watershed,
and the activity of carp, an introduced fish species whose numbers have
skyrocketed in the area.  As vegetation disappeared, wind and waves became
contributing factors to the further decline of habitat.  Even the control of
Great Lakes water levels for shipping has played a role in the elimination of
submergent aquatic plants, and the decline in emergent plant cover from 85% to
less than 10%.

<p>Several projects are currently underway to restore habitat.  Carp will be
controlled with the help of a carp barrier and fishway, and larger populations of
predatory animals (including pike and osprey) whose numbers are being increased
through habitat management.  Combined sewage and storm sewer overflows are slowly
being controlled with the construction of a series of overflow containment
basins.  Aquatic plantings are a major component of the restoration plan, and RBG
has established an aquatic plant nursery.  We require between 20,000 and 30,000
plants each year and these are being produced  from locally collected seed so as
to maintain the appropriate  genotype.  Much of this work is experimental as
there is very little known about the production of wetland plants.  We have tried
a variety of methods for propagation, germination and transplanting with varying
degrees of success.  School groups help out by growing the seed, as part of a
Classroom Plant Nursery Programme.   Growing kits are distributed in March, and
schools return the young plants to us in June.  In 1994, over 5, 000 plants were
produced by local schools and we hope to double the number in 1995.  RBG also
supplies plants to other restoration projects in Ontario, through sale of excess
plant materials, and through growing site-collected seed. <p>As well as the
nursery, participants also visited a planting site.  The area behind a
water-filled portable dam was dewatered, and a variety of plants had germinated
on exposed mudflats.  Transplanting had augmented this population, resulting in a
quickly revegetated area.  This revegetation method is experimental, and may be
used on a larger scale in future, along with creation of floating cattail mats
using log rafts as a planting platform.

<center>Fiona Rintoul, Landscape Architect</center>
<p>
<p>






<p>The creation of an effective outdoor classroom means that attention must be paid
to ecology, safety, aesthetics, site function, community input & recreation, play
space, vandalism, maintenance and a number of other considerations.  Each factor
must be considered separately and in conjunction with the others, and coordinated
with the individual site and the specifics of the curriculum of the school. 
Developing a creative solution to this complex challenge is the role of design.

<p>Design is  a creative problem solving process and it is critical to project
success.  Design is more than planning which trees to plant, and which class will
plant them on which day.  It involves comprehensive research, intense
brainstorming, knowledge of your school grounds and neighbours and ideally
involvement of all those that will be affected by the creation of the product. 
The design process takes time and energy but it can be a wonderful learning tool
for students, parents and teachers alike.  What it requires is a strategy.  As
educators know, in the learning experience, often the process is more important
than the product.  However, it is equally true that if you employ a thoughtful,
creative process you will most often be rewarded with an item of quality.

<p>Definitions:

<p>Design: To plan or work out something creatively.  While this definition is
appropriate for the fine arts, it does not address one of the key components of
the "functioning arts", like landscape architecture and architecture--the
creative solution must work.  There is a saying that "form follows function",
meaning that how things look  (form) is directly influenced by how they work
(function).  Correspondingly, the landscape will function (well or poorly) based
on how it was formed.

<p>Restoration:    An ecological development stately involving the re-introduction
of presettlement plant communities on sites previously occupied those plants; the
density and diversity of species should match the original plant community. 
Technically this is very difficult to do, and usually not appropriate for most
school grounds due to existing conditions and site use.  If this sort of project
is contemplated, your budget should allocate money for a professional consultant
to be hired, due to ecological complexity involved. (ie ecologist, naturalist,
specialized landscape architect).

<p>Naturalization:   A modifies version of restoration usually (preferably)involving
native plant communities (species associations, natural proportions, ecological
patterns).  This strategy involves both active planting and a revised maintenance
approach.

<p>Habitat Gardens:    A term that applies to many school ground projects as well as
residential gardens (hopefully bordering your school)  that are trying to provide
homes for animals and as a result, many native plants also. Since the definition
of habitat is really 'home'  and the definition of garden is really plant
cultivation, a habitat garden is really an attempt to cultivate plants and create
conditions where plant and animals can establish, and where humans can be a part
of it. Requirements for these gardens are water, food, protection and  living
space.

<p>Native vs. Exotics:   This distinction is becoming increasingly more important to
make as the native gene pool dwindles due to increased development.  Native
plants are indigenous, therefore, like indigenous peoples, they have always been
in a particular place.  Native plants existed in pre-settlement times
(approximately 1600's in North America)  .  During settlement  many alien or
exotic plants were brought to America, some of which naturalized (escaped
cultivation and acted like they had always been here). Some aliens were
hybridized with natives and were therefore no longer native plants can be
invasive, choking out many rare natives (loose strife, norway maple, european
buckthorn, tartarian honeysuckle); also using native plants helps preserve
genetic integrity important in resisting pests and disease.

<p>The Design Process

<p>A process can be described as a method of doing something, a course of action or
a series of changes over time.  Natural processes are the basis of ecology; the
hydrological cycle, decomposition, soil formation, plant community succession,
evolution, creation--all are processes that involve change over time, all have
direction and many involve cycles.  The design process is similar.  It involves a
number of components, evolving to a product by way of several feedback cycles. 
It is complex, inter-related, and never static.

<p>The comparison between natural process and design process is appropriate for
school ground naturalization design due to the important role that ecology plays
in these projects.

<p>The design process has often been referred to as a 'spiral' in that you start off
with a great deal of information and in the process of zeroing in on the design
solution you continually loop back to evaluate each design decision in the
context of the whole.  The main point is that design is not linear.  The
following steps are listed in a linear order, but each step assumes that a
feedback loop exists connecting it to previous stages -- hence, the spiral.

<p>A. Establish what you want to do and why
<p>
Groups that share a common purpose often have the most success.  Goal setting
helps focus the vision of the group as well as set up some basic design
parameters.  These should be written down and eventually given some hierarchy to
reflect the groups priorities.

<p>B.  Start gathering resource information

<p>Generally the more information you have at the beginning the better-- you can
always evaluate and 'deep file' the less relevant materials at some later date. 
Some items to search out are:

<UL>
<LI>site plans with a noted scale
<LI>	plans for sites bordering your school,
especially parks or other community land uses
	utility locations (above and
below ground; ask utility companies to do 'locates' for you 	and you will get
a plan drawing)
<LI>plans showing possible future locations of portables (from
your school board) 
<LI>contact your local Recreation and Parks to see if they
may have any info for you (ie. 	plan drawings, municipal regulations and
bylaws, naturalization guidelines, articles 	etc.)
<LI>contact other boards who are active in this area, they may have a resource pool that you 	can draw
on; a number of excellent resource manuals do exist, some local, others from
England, Florida, Ohio etc.
<LI>public and University libraries have lots ofinformation now on such things as butterfly 	gardens, planting for birds and
creating ponds etc. 
<LI>collect nursery catalogues for plant and pricing info.

<LI>	collect grant application forms from organizations like The Evergreen
Foundation, 	Habitat 2000, Tree Plan Canada etc. so that you are aware of
requirements, deadlines.
</UL>

<p>C. Organize 'brainstorming sessions' to generate as many ideas as you can

<p>A key part of the creative process that is design, is the technique known as
'brainstorming' or 'brain-dumping'.  As it sounds, the idea is that you literally
expel as many ideas as you can in a very intense, energetic form.  By saying
whatever comes into your head, no matter how zany that idea is, you can increase
the potential for really imaginative ideas to tumble forth.  It is critical that
these ideas  are not censored or evaluated during the brainstorming session, or
the creative process is hindered.  There will be lots of opportunity to evaluate,
eliminate and prioritize these ideas at a later date -- this is not the time to
do it.

<p>These brainstorming exercises can be applied to the following areas:

<UL>
<LI>	goal setting; vision statement development, 
<LI>	creation of a 'wish list',
which is a list of physical entries or even qualities that you 	would like the
project to have (ie quiet spaces for children, play areas that are shaded, a
	butterfly garden etc.)
<LI>	make a list of 'issues and concerns', again
noting all things expressed, some may be  	easily dealt with others may need
more investigation, or may require input beyond the 	committee. It is very
likely  that several of these will strongly influence the final design
	product, which is realistic. It is when important issues are brushed aside
<LI>during the 	design process that problems occur later,

<LI>	fundraising,
<LI>installation days--finding ways to make these events successful, curriculum
 focused, community based and fun, <LI>gaining community support and community involvement, 
<LI>connecting with curriculum,
</UL>

<p>D.  Do a complete site inventory and analysis

<p>Design solutions must respond directly to the site that they are being applied
to, and that requires some field work.  For this portion of the project, it may
be advisable to engage a professional consultant (landscape architect, ecologist,
naturalist) to evaluate your sites' potential and its restraints and recording
this information on a copy of the base plan.  The following information should be
a basis for this exercise:
<UL>
<LI>existing vegetation (where, what , condition, potential)<LI>	neighbouring
vegetation/plant communities with which to connect<LI>	microclimate and
environment information (sun, shade, winter wind, wet areas, dry 	areas,
slopes) <LI>	soil conditions, types.<LI>	ecosystem potential: does your site
have the conditions for a prairie, a woodlot, a 	wetland? <LI> 	current site
use patterns: parking, sidewalks, dumpsters, natural 'desire lines', active
	play spaces, obstructed views (of traffic, from school windows to playground
, within 	playground) <LI>site safety: night lighting, dark spots, sites of
previous vandalism, isolated places, 	obstructed views(of traffic, from school
windows to playground, within playground). <LI>	maintenance areas: snow storage,
garbage areas/litter accumulation, current high 	maintenance areas.<LI>	good
and bad views into and out of the site. <LI>	school identity (image, entry
points, signage)
</UL>
<p>While it is important to note the physical facts of the site, it is equally
important to determine the impact these realities may have for a naturalization
plan.  All of this information should be written down and where possible, should
be noted on a site plan for future reference throughout the design process.

<p>E. Evaluation of information

<p>Up to this point you have amassed a great deal of information: now, it is time to
critically evaluate what you have, and what you realistically can do.  Basically,
you need to sift, sort and prioritize.

<p>1. Review your goals, vision statement: are they still valid?  Prioritize the
goals: decide, in light of what you know at this point, what is most important to
you.

<p>2. Assess your resource information and file it in a manner that reflects its
relevance to your  project.  Are you missing anything?  Determine what you still
need.  It is probably too early to actually discard anything at this point, but
file it appropriately.

<p>3. Go back and review your brainstorming sessions, rewrite these lists assessing
priorities.  Do not discard the original lists from their freewheeling sessions,
you may find, sometime later there is a little gem buried there.

<p>4. Compare your site inventory & analysis information with your goal, wish lists
and list of issues and concerns --it will likely cause further modification of
your list and/or the requirement  for further site work or research.  This is one
of the design process 'loops'.

<p>F. Preparation of design concepts (doodling time)

<p>This is where the realities of your site (from the site inventory) become merged
with your wish list, while keeping in mind your issues and concerns.  During the
development of a design concept, many concepts are usually generated on paper. 
Each concept is striving to find the perfect fit between all the parts.  This
process should generate 2 or 3 solid concepts for future evaluation. Once again,
this stage involves a lot of looping.

<p>To understand what concepts actually look like, consider their other
name--'bubble diagrams'; circles, ellipses or similar shapes that are arranged on
a page, each one representing a physical area (soccer field, butterfly garden,
tree nursery).  Together, all of these are like a collage of bubbles, hence the
name.  The reason for the lack of detail at this stage is that, like
brainstorming, the important thing is getting the ideas out, where they can be
seen by others and evaluated.  At this stage, you do not want to get hung up on
details (that comes later).

<p>G. Consolidation of one design concept

<p>After considerable evaluation in the context of all your information, a concept
is developed that attempts to merge  all wishes, concerns and realities  into
what will likely be the best parts of each concept developed in F. (above).  Now
it is time to widen your sphere of evaluation to possibly include your
neighbours, the larger community, or your Board (particularly for maintenance and
safety concerns).  Revisions invariably result.

<p>Once again, it is helpful to use a final plan from your bubble concept involves
making many new design decisions.  Two of the most important areas requiring
detail are the specifications of sizes of things, and the physical space required
to do what we want you to do.  People invariably undersize objects in the
landscape, so as to avoid drawing plans  that are physically impossible to build
, you must go back inside with tape measures and clip-boards and actually measure
out your ideas.  Once you trust your field notes, you can confidently draw things
to scale on your plan.

<p>The second area that requires considerable detail is that of planting
information.  In this case experience is truly an asset, so either draw upon
knowledgeable  committee members (gardens, horticulturists, landscapes
architects, ecologists) or hire a consultant for a couple of hours, to guide you
in your choices of plants, plant combinations and recommended spacing.

<p>I. Phasing

<p>This involves dividing the final plan into manageable pieces, or individual
projects.  Many people are comfortable with the idea of a 5-year plan for
installation, the challenge is how to determine what happens in  year 1, year 2
etc.  Here are some things to consider when making things happen:

<LI>	Re-visit your goals and your wish list--which areas were your priorities? 
Have those    	priorities changed?

<LI>How rich is your naturalization fund?  This  may change priorities rapidly.
 Determine 	the cost of each manageable mini-project, maybe some very visible 
projects would not 	cost a lot, yet would set a positive tone & get students
involved quickly.

<LI> projects are suitable for which grants?  Usually projects that
require plants only, 	and clearly create habitat are the most appealing to
grant agencies.

<LI>What should be started early, based on rate of growth?  Creating shade or
woodlots 	takes time, so it may mean making tree planting a year one priority,
even through there 	are few immediate benefits beyond the planning day event.

<p>J. Monitoring and Maintenance

<p>Conditions and priorities are always evolving, and a good Master Plan must allow
for this. Records on growth rate, species diversity and general success should be
kept by the committee to help in future decision making, but it can also become a
core part of the student curriculum related to naturalization. In other words,
the students can be your record keepers and have a valuable educational
experience doing it.

<p>Maintenance can be a real stumbling block for many projects, so it is important
to have the maintenance stuff fully involved in the design and installation
process. One of the benefits of a naturalization approach should be lower
maintenance. Your records should bare this out, but if not, design revisions may
be in order.

<p>Since you are working with a living system, things are never static, so the
design process is really never complete. This is the challenge of naturalized
school grounds, but it is also part of their charm.


<p>HOW TO PUT THIS PROCESS TO WORK.

<p>he design process described above requires several things: a motivated
facilitator, an energetic committee, some professional input at critical stages,
a larger audience to react to your ideas and eventually support them, and of
course the support and enthusiasm of your students.

<p>Forming a 'naturalization or environmental committee' is the first step. Tapping
into your own teaching staff, your students' parents and your immediate neighbour
is very important. This mixture of people can go a long way to creating early
support for the project, and can often bring you a useful collaboration of
talents.

<p>In assessing the needs of your project versus the expertise of your committee,
there may be some gaps. Recognizing what these are (and this appraisal must be
done honestly) will allow you to make decisions regarding which consultants to
hire, when to bring them in, and what you want them to provide. Any good
consultant will be happy to discuss, free of charge, what their specialties are,
provide references if required, confirm rates hourly, and tell you what they can
do for you, and how long it will take. There should be no surprises which you
could not afford.

<p>Taking your ideas to a larger audience is also very important. Naturalization is
still a new concept to many and still has some scary connotations attached to it
: weedy sites, rabid animals, vandalism, litter and things generally running
amok. consistently including the community in your activities, from being
involved in design development, to providing reaction to the concepts, to
planting to evaluation to monitoring ( an environmental version of 'neighbourhood
watch')will help to make the project run smoothly and will turn it to a community
project not just a school project.

<p>NVOLVING THE STUDENTS

<p>To broaden the design process experience, you may wish to try running design
concept workshops with your students. Children usually show great enthusiasm for
these events and it encourages them to take ownership of the project even before
a plant even goes in the ground. As with your adult committee, you need a
facilitator to run the brainstorming sessions and the design sessions, and let
the students do the rest.

<p>A suggested format for these student design sessions is as follows:

<p>1.	 Using one or two classes together (smaller numbers are better) explain
what will be happening to their school grounds and how they can be involved. Take
them outside following this explanation and get them to start to use their
imagination and powers of observation -- this can be their site inventory and
analysis. It is suggested to take along a clipboard to record their thoughts. To
keep it simple and involve all grades, divide the property up and focus each
group's attention  on a particular part -- you may want to do this after your
committee has generally allocated certain spaces to certain general ideas, by way
of your bubble concept.

<p>2. 	Take them back inside and use their enthusiasm (after being outside) to do
a wish list brainstorming session with them. One starting point could be wildlife
-- ask  which animals would they like to have in their gardens; ask them which
animals they don't like to have also ( some animals will show up on both lists!).
From here you can get them to determine  and then brainstorm what kind of
habitats you would need to have in order to encourage these animals. This whole
process can provide wonderful opportunities to educate children on ecology.

<p>3. 	On the following day, have them create plans and models, in small groups,
to represent  their ideas ( you will need to review with them the results of
their brainstorming sessions before hand). Two methods are :

<p>Models: give each group a base plan and then supply generous amounts of
		   	creative material -- plasticine, pipe cleaners, egg cartons,
paint, beads etc. They will need a half an hour or more to complete this.
Co-operative 		   	design is an important concept to stress here.

<p>Plans: this can work for individuals or groups with baseplans being 		
  	supplied once again. Prepared cut-outs of plants, logs, rocks, and other
		   	items are provided along with each base plan and the student
chooses and arranges the items as they please, gluing them down when they are
happy 		   	with arrangement. Colour can then be added individually by
the student.

<p>4. 	With either of these scenarios it is important to in some way incorporate
the ideas presented, and then to return to the class when the design is finalized
to show how their work become part of the plan. Prior to this, completed models
or plans can be displayed in the school to raise awareness for the project.
