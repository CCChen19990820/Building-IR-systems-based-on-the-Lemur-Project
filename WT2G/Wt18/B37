<h3><a name="NAIROBI"><font size=5><strong>NAIROBI</strong></font></a><font size=5><strong> </strong></font></h3>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=13%><img src="images/ke_nbo.jpeg" align=bottom width=168 height=158></td><td width=50%>NAIROBI is one of Africa's major cities: the UN's fourth 'World Centre', East Africa's commercial and aid hub, and a significant 
capital in its own right with a population of one million (and growing). Nairobi came into being in 1899: an artificial settlement, 
created by Europeans at Mile 327 of the East African railway line, then systemati-cally being forged from the coast into the 
interior. It was initially a stores depot, shunting yard and camping ground for the thousands of Indian labourers employed by the 
British; the site, bleak and swampy, simply the spot where operations came to a halt whilst the engineers figured out the next move 
- getting the line up the steep slopes that lay ahead. The name came from the local Swahili term for the valley, Ewaso Nairobi, 
'Stream of Cold Water'. Unplanned and unexpected, the settlement took root, undergoing a total rebuilding a few years on, after 
the outbreak of plague and the burning down of the original compound. By 1907 it was so firmly estab-lished that the colonisers 
took it as the capital of the newly formed British East Africa. Europeans, encouraged by the authorities, settled in large number. 
The Africans, meanwhile, were forced by tax into employ-ment or out to specially created reserves: the Maasai to the Southern 
Reserve, the Kikuyu to their own reserve in the highlands. The capital, lacking development from any established community, was, 
and is, somewhat anonymous in character. The original centre preserves an Asian influence in its older buildings but is today shot 
through with high-rise blocks, indistinguishable from any western city's. Surrounding it are thousands of acres of suburbs: 
wealthiest in the west and north, to the east and south increasingly poor and in parts out and out slum.</td></tr>

<h3><a name="Around Central Nairobi">Around Central Nairobi</a></h3>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=13%><img src="images/ke_hsta.jpeg" align=bottom width=190 height=158></td><td width=50%>Looking around Central Nairobi, Kenyatta Avenue is an obvious place to start and a good initial overview of it- and much more - 
is to be had from the vertigo-inducing glass paneled elevators in the ICEA building at the corner of Wabera Street on the north 
side. If an excuse for entrance is needed by the guards at the bottom, tell them you're visiting the Japanese Embassy on the 
seventeenth floor; they may even be persuaded to escort you on to the roof. Kenyatta Avenue was originally designed to allow a 
full turn of a twelve-span of oxen. Broad, multi-laned and planted with flowering trees and shrubs, it remains (along with the 
Kenyatta Conference Center) the capital's favorite tourist image. The avenue is smartest- and most tourist- on its south side, with 
would-be moneychangers and itinerant souvenir hawkers assailing you from every direction, and shoe shiners inspecting each 
passing pair of feet from their stands. The focus of it all is the New Stanley Hotel's Thorn Tree cafe opposite Woolworth's at the 
avenue's eastern end on the corner of Kimathi Street. The Thorn Tree is Nairobi's one proper pavement cafe and despite 
irritatingly slow service ('we are stock taking') an enduring meeting place. Around the imposing thorn tree in question is a message 
board, intended for personal notes but always worth scanning for vehicle-sharing deals, unused air tickets for sale and so on.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Proceeding to the other end of Kenyatta Avenue you come to the GPO and just before it Koinange Street, named after the Kikuyu Senior Chief Koinange of the 
colonial era. Here too is the peculiar Galton-Fenzi memorial, a monument to the man who founded, of all things, the Nairobi branch of the Automobile Association. 
Fenzi was also the first motorist to drive from Nairobi to Mombasa - in 1926. Head down Koinange Street and on to Kaunda Street, passing the Intercontinental 
on your right and, crossing City Hall Way, you enter City Square. This is Nairobi's front room. Jomo Kenyatta's statue sits benevolently, mace in hand, on the far 
side of the wide, flagstoned court; his mausoleum, with flickering eternal flames, on the right as you approach the Parliament building. When the flags are out for a 
conference it all looks very bright and confident. Like Westminster, Kenya's Parliament is open to the public. Talk to the guards at the gate who will tell you when 
the next session is taking place or, alternatively when it's not in session, how to get a tour of the building. To sit in the public gallery you first have to register at the 
gatehouse on the corner of Parliament Road and Harambee Avenue. You must leave all belongings with the attendant outside, and, once seated, be on your best 
behavior. The gallery tends to be full- of very well-behaved school children; which of course is more than can be said for the house - or the MP&#146;s. Don't expect any 
startling revelations - the tone of debate is aptly suggested by the legend over the main doors, 'For a just Society and the Fair Government of Men' - but try to get 
hold of a copy of the Orders of the Day, there may be a juicy question or two worth anticipating.</p>
<p>From Parliament, walk down Harambee Avenue along the shady sidewalk and you come to Nairobi's pride and joy - the Kenyatta Conference Center and its tall 
brother, 'KANU tower', the party headquarters. This, as well as being the tallest building in Kenya, is capped by a spacey looking, mile-high revolving restaurant (a 
mile above sea level that is). Occasional confusions arise on the ground floor about whether you're allowed up to the twenty-eighth; you are. The restaurant is no 
great shakes and revolves only on special occasions, but the view of Nairobi has no equal and is a firm reminder of the vastness of Africa. Just 4km to the south 
you see the Mombasa road leave the suburbs behind and take off across the yellow plains; to the north, hills of coffee and, higher up, tea roll into the distance. If 
you pick a good day' you really can see Mount Kenya in one direction and Kilimanjaro in the other. The Conference Center restaurant is worth visiting after dark 
as well - though perhaps only for a drink. There are usually discos at weekends. The American Cultural Center, further along Harambee and right down Aga Khan 
Walk, on the ground floor of the National Bank building, is worth to look for an idea of the kind of image the USA would like to project to Kenyans. On Thursday 
and Friday at 1 lam you can see select footage of the previous week's ABC news. A well-stocked library and periodicals room are available for the purpose of 
letting 'ideas contest in an open marketplace' as the handout prosaically puts it. More palatable are the two or three feature films shown every month (details in 
monthly programs From this American corner (the Embassy is down here too), cut across to Moi Avenue and up to the National Archives. Housed in the striking 
old Bank of India building on the bend of Moi Avenue across from the Hilton, they amount to a museum/art gallery which few visitors to Nairobi seem to know 
about: entry is free and certainly worth an hour or so . The collection, sold to the government in 1966, ranges from uninteresting dabbles to some beautiful drawings 
and striking collages, but in a city that is not exactly cluttered with art collections it does deserve a look. With a few exceptions, things to do north of Kenyatta 
Avenue have a commercial bent. </p>

<h2><a name="momb">MOMBASA</a></h2>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=13%><img src="images/ke_mom.jpeg" align=bottom width=170 height=93></td><td width=50%>Kenya's second city is the slightly indolent hub of the coast, a faded, flaking, charming city that still despite its gentle sprawl - feels 
like a small town that was once great. Actually an island - now connected to the mainland west by causeways, north by bridges 
but south, still, by a ferry - Mombasa is intricate and its streets wriggle deceptively. At its most appealing heart is the Old Town, a 
lattice of lanes, mosques and cramped, elderly houses sloping gently down to the once-busy chow harbor. Fort Jesus is an 
impressive reminder of Mombasa's complicated, bloody past, still overlooking the Old Town from where it once guarded the 
harbor entrance. It's now a national monument and museum.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Within easy walking distance and clustered all around is the whole of down-town, 20C Mombasa - wide streets, a refreshing lack of high-rise and a surprising 
number of open spaces. Even here, in the commercial center of one of Africa's busiest ports, the atmosphere is relaxed and congenial. Rush hours, urgency, 
paranoia seem to be Nairobi's problems (as everyone will tell you) not Mombasa's. And the gaping, marginal slums that one expects to find outside African cities 
are hardly here either. Despite the palms, the sunshine and the happy languor, it's not all bliss and perfection: street crime, though it hardly approaches Nairobi's 
level, is a serious problem and you should be wary of displaying your valuables or accepting invitations to walk down dark alleys. But as a general rule, Mombasa 
is a far less neurotic city than Nairobi. There's nowhere in the center that could be considered a no-go area. Indicative of this, the city stays awake much later. 
Climatic encouragement may be part of it, but at an hour when down-town Nairobi is empty but for taxis and askaris, Mombasans are strolling in the warm night, 
old men are conversing on the benches in Oigo Road and many shops remain open: the small-town freedoms are still healthy here. All this adds up to a city which is 
richly satisfying and rewarding to stay in.</p>
<p>Ethnically, Mombasa is perhaps even more diverse than Nairobi. Asian and Arab influence is particularly pervasive with fifty mosques and dozens of Hindu and 
Sikh temples lending a strongly oriental flavor. Still, the largest contingent speak Swahili as a first language and its the Swahili civilization which, more than any other, 
accounts for Mombasa's distinctive character As a tourist town Mombasa doesn't go out of its way and indeed its best quality is its lack of pretension. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Around Central Mombasa">Around Central Mombasa</a></h3>
<p>From Fort Jesus, the OLD TOWN is an easy objective. The first impression - of a quarter that seems entirely devoted to gift and curio shops - is none too 
encouraging. But this turns out to be purely the result of Fort Jesus' adjacent car park and tourist appeal, and the shops don't extend far into the Old Town. They 
are especially ostentatious down at the end of Ndia Kuu Rd where several emporia are overwhelmingly luxuriant in their displays and multilingual enticements. One 
or two provide free coffee - which alone is nice. Many of them, it has to be said, are selling a great deal of worthless junk: some deal in shells too and shell 
lamp-stands, ornaments, etc. - a trade which operates on the fringes of the law in Kenya. Further west, away from the Fort, they're smaller and correspondingly 
cheaper and less pretentious. Utamaduni, just down Ndia Kuu from the crafts corner, has some interesting bits and pieces worth looking over. The Old Town is not 
in fact that Old. Most buildings date from the 19C and though there may be foundations and even walls which go back many centuries, you&#146; ll get a clearer guide to 
the age of the town from its 20-odd mosques. Officially the oldest (founded in 1570) is the Mandhry mosque on Bachawy Road - rarely open to visitors, it has a 
striking minaret. The Basheith mosque in Old Kilindini Road, recently repainted in fresh cream and white, is acknowledged also to be very old. Entering the 
mosques - as long as they're not locked - is usually all right for men who arrive properly covered and bare-footed. Sometimes you may be expected to wash hands 
and feet as well. Women, however modest, will as often as not be politely refused. </p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=50%>Much of the other architecture in the Old Town is profoundly influenced by the Indian-style as Zanzibar tastes of Busaidi occupation 
during the l9C. This is noticeable particularly in the elegant fretwork balconies and shutters which are still maintained on a few houses, 
notably on Ndia Kuu For older relics you'll have to poke around more conscientiously. There are a number of quite ancient tombs 
along the seafront, especially towards the northern end of the Old Town' some of which have pillars: this is the part of Mombasa 
considered to be 'medieval' - or in other words pre-Portuguese. Returning south along the twisting seafront road (`seafront' although 
the harbor&#146;s only glimpsed) you come to a gigantic new mosque of the Bohra Muslims. 'Burhani Masjid for Dawood' Bohra 
Community' says the sign. In the unassuming setting of the Old Town it's an imposingly massive edifice. The chow harbor is wildly 
overrated. There are usually a few boats in port but no longer can you guarantee seeing dozens - let alone hundreds - even at the end 
of the north-east monsoon in April, traditionally the peak time for arrivals. Seasonal variations are less important now the big jahazis 
have engines. Nor are you likely to have the opportunity of going aboard one of these exotic vessels - a tourist tradition with coffee and 
souvenirs that's died a death as port officials have become more officious. Instead, try to imagine how it must once have looked, chat 
to the many policemen standing around and don't, whatever you do, raise your camera. Attempting to travel by chow from Mombasa 
is, I'm afraid, an equally discouraging story. Lamu holds more promise </td><td width=11%><img src="images/ke_mom2.jpeg" align=bottom width=163 height=195></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Heading up towards Digo Road, you might enjoy calling in at the Jain Temple, whose entry is in Langoni Road, This sublime creation - intricate icing sugar exterior, 
scrupulously clean and scented inside, decorated in dozens of pastel shades - was built only in 1963. Jainism is a Hindu religion closely related to Buddhism, which 
prohibits the eating of any kind of animal food: in its extreme form even subterranean vegetables are taboo. The temple interior is ornamentally and substantially 
magnificent: painted figurines of deities in their niches are each provided with a drain so they can be easily showered down; around the ceiling exquisitely stylized 
pictures portray scenes from a life, including a familiar snake temptation in a garden. </p>
<p>For a return to earth, visit Mackinnon market- Mombasa's municipal - which has a splendid abundance of tropical fruit including such exotics as jak fruit and 
soursops. Check out the latest kanga designs in Biashara Street- probably the most clued-up fashion center in Kenya. Some of the home-product patterns are so 
good they' re beginning to make an impact abroad as well - unusual combinations of brilliant fast colors used to startling effect. It's worth pricing several shops 
before buying and perhaps bargaining for several lots at once: For the most part, the rest of Mombasa's pleasures derive just from being here.'- Strolling, with 
plenty of cold drink stops, is a time-honored Mombasan diversion. You'll probably want to see that immortal double pair of elephant tusks on Moi Avenue, To get 
to them you have to run the gauntlet of curio kiosks which have almost hidden the cool hideaway of Uhuru gardens. And when you get there, you may regret your 
determination to view the tusks close up - they're revealed as grubby aluminum. More rewarding, if you have time and an inclination for a long walk, is the circuit 
which takes off around the breezy, seaward side of the island down Mama Ngina drive - Come down here in the early evening and you'll find half of Mombasa 
doing the same. At the end of Mama Ngina is an extensive and surprising forest of enormous baobab trees, frequently associated with ancient settlements on the 
coast: and just across the Likoni ferry roundabout is a hut pillar tomb - the Mbaraki pillar. Supposedly the burial place of a 174 mainland sheik, chief of one of the 
'twelve tribes', it's some 8 Mts. high but even so is dwarfed by the nearby towers of a molasses refinery.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Jambo! We are pleased you have decided to travel with us to to East Africa, the land where man first walked the Earth 
and where today the graceful gazelle, the mighty elephant and the lordly lion roam free. Having operated safaris in East 
Africa for many years, <font color="#FF0000">VANTAGE</font> has compiloed the following information. We hope you will find it helpful in preparing 
for your trip with us. </h3>
<h3><font color="#FF0000"><em>IMPORTANT</em></font><em> </em>- One of the most important considerations you need to have when traveling with a group, however small 
it is, is that each individual should show cooperation, consideration and continual patience. Many countries tend to be 
very different from what you are used to at home. Remember, when you travel you are the foreigner. Be appreciative, 
cheerful and friendly. You alone will measure the success of your tour, so bear in mind that your attitude will affect that 
of the other tour members. An interested and cheerful outlook by you is most likely to create the same response in 
others. A quick information survey of your trip follows .....</h3>

<p><a name="eas"><font color="#804040"><strong>AN &#147;EAST AFRICA&#148; SAFARI</strong></font></a><font color="#804040"><strong> </strong></font>&#151; The moment you arrive in Nairobi the elation starts. This is the Sun City of East Africa...relax... Next day your Safari begins 
with the fascination of animals by the thousands...the lush country followed by desertic areas.... Elephants by the herds, giraffe, waterbuck, rhino, buffaloes and 
some of the most beautiful birds anywhere in the world. Your transportation is surprisingly comfortable, it takes you from site to with a driver who incredibly knows 
where animals are. Lodges can be rustic in the exterior, but all offer deluxe accommodation and service with a comfort unimaginable in most locations. Feel the call 
to adventure! At the mention of Africa your mind fills with images: open prairies where wild animals still roam, snowcapped Kilimanjaro, thousands of flamingos 
taking flight and sunsets that take your breath away. Images that create a desire to see it all. Our deluxe tours are designed to give you all you expected of Africa 
and much more.....</p>
<p><a name="tvs"><font color="#804040"><strong>TRAVELING VANTAGE STYLE </strong></font></a>&#151; All of our care and imagination have gone into the planning of our itineraries. You will get to know a different Africa from 
the primitive Ngorongoro Crater to the luxury of Mount Kenya Safari Club. Africa offers special challenges, yet we have succeeded in giving you the most modern 
comforts and some little touches like day rooms on days when your flight does not take off till late at night. No more waiting in an airport hall from check out till 
departure time. Your comfort is of the utmost concern to us and extra conveniences are provided to eliminate all discomforts. When you book a Vantage Safari 
you are automatically enrolled as a member of the Flying Doctors&#146; Society to enjoy the adventure and excitement of the great plains and parks of Kenya with peace 
of mind.</p>
<p><a name="los"><font color="#804040"><strong>LIFE ON SAFARI</strong></font></a><font color="#804040"><strong> </strong></font>&#151; A steaming cup of coffee at 6.00 will see you off on an early morning game drive with the sun appearing over the horizon. Later on a lavish 
breakfast, then time to relax and look at the magnificent vastness of Africa. Game drives are fantastic but, if you chose, you can just relax by the pool, open a book 
and let time go by....and, in the evening, drinks at the bar before dinner, then gather by the fireplace to recount the sights of the day. <font color="#804040"><strong>MEALS</strong></font> - The food served in 
Kenya offers great quality and variety combining gourmet, continental and international cuisine along with local specialities. Table d&#146;hote menus do not mean small 
selections...in Kenya you will enjoy helping yourself to extraordinary buffets or full table service. Your meals are part of your enjoyment and, at Vantage, we keep 
this ultimate goal on our mind at all times.</p>
<p><a name="hin"><font color="#804040"><strong>YOUR HOSTS IN NAIROBI</strong></font> </a>&#151; U.S.T., our network office in Nairobi, will be your local host throughout your stay in Kenya. Upon arrival you will be met by 
our personnel who will have a sign with your name on. All safari drivers are also directly employed by U.S.T. Our representative office is located in Cots House 
between the Hilton and the Intercontinental Hotels. If for any reason someone needs to contact you while on Safari, please have them contact our office in KENYA 
and ask to relay the message to the passengesr specifying the program booked for them. </p>
<hr>
<h2>GENERAL TRAVEL INFORMATION</h2>
<p><a name="pass"><font size=4><strong>PASSPORT/VISAS</strong></font> </a>&#151; USA passport holders must have a passport whose validity is at least 6 months beyond their return date from East Africa. The 
passport must be signed and must have several blank pages left in it. All children must travel on their own passport. In addition passengers must have an onward 
airline ticket and a visa. Visas are issued by the Country&#146;s Consulate in USA (Visa service agencies facilitate this task for a fee) and is usually valid for 3 to 6 
months from the date of issue. We recommend applying for your visas as early as possible. </p>
<hr>
<p><a name="health"><font size=4><strong>HEALTH INFORMATION</strong></font> </a>&#151; No vaccinations are currently required for entry into Kenya or Tanzania if coming directly from the USA. However, if you 
plan to visit more than one country, including both Kenya and Tanzania, YELLOW FEVER vaccination is required. This vaccination requirement applies to anyone 
traveling from KENYA or from TANZANIA to: Egypt, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Zaire, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mauritius, Malawi or 
Sudan. If your itinerary requires you to have a yellow fever vaccination, you must ask your doctor to provide an &#147;International Certificate of Vaccination&#148; which 
should always be carried with you at all times while traveling. If you do not carry it, you may be denied entry into the country. Even if you are not required to obtain 
this vaccination, the CDC recommends that you consider vaccination if you are traveling outside urban areas. Malaria is prevalent in sub-Saharan countries, 
therefore East Africa visits require that malaria prevention be started before departure from home and continued after your return as per doctor&#146;s prescription. 
Malaria is carried by a mosquito which primarily feeds between dusk and dawn, so personal protection measures are also very effective at minimizing the risk of 
malaria. The CDC recommends an ample supply of an insect repellent containing &#147;DEET&#148; which you can find in good sporting good stores. In addition keep 
covered as mush as possible wearing long pants, socks and long sleeved clothes especially during the mosquito&#146;s feeding hours. Perfume or any other scented 
spray should be avoided as it will attract mosquitoes. Finally remain in screened areas as much as possible and use mosquito netting where provided. These 
hygienic measures do not take away the need for you to consult with your doctor and use the anti-malaria drug suggested by him. In most cases this would be 
mefloquine or, for those not able to take it, doxycycline as mosquitoes in east Africa are cloroquinine resistant. The CDC also recommends that travelers consider a 
meningcoccal vaccine as both Kenya and Tanzania lie within the &#147;Meningitis belt&#148; of Africa. In all cases we strongly urge to seek expert advice. Detailed 
recommendations for the prevention of malaria may be obtained 24-hours a day by calling the CDC HotLIne at <font color="#804040"><font size=4><strong>404-332-4555 </strong></font></font></p>
<p>If you wear prescription glasses or contact lenses, we recommend bringing an extra pair and a copy of your prescription. Passengers who wear contact lenses 
should give high consideration to bringing a pair of glasses, as the dust in the game parks area may irritate the lenses. You should also always carry with you enough 
supplies of any prescription medicines as they may not be available in the locations visited. Medicines should not be packed in your suitcases but hand-carried to 
avoid the risk of losing them in a misplaced piece of luggage. A safari is not particularly strenuous, and no more than average health is necessary. You should check 
with your personal physician before leaving, and keep in mind that much of East Africa lies at a altitude of over 5000 feet. Although the water and food are 
perfectly safe mild stomach upsets do occasionally occur, and you may wish to ask you physician to recommend medicine for diarrhea. Tap water is considered 
safe to drink in the better hotels on Nairobi and Arusha; but on safari tap water should not be consumed. A carafe of purified water is provided in your room. 
Remember to use this water not only for drinking but also for brushing your teeth. </p>
<p>VANTAGE Tour Members should consult their physicians for any required or recommended general health measures at time of travel. Trip members should have 
a personal supply of any special medications which they may need. It is understood that Vantage is not a medical facility and therefore has no expertise nor 
responsibility regarding what medications or inoculations you and your private physician should decide necessary for your safe participation in the trip. Regulations 
frequently change, and it is recommended that prior to your departure you consult your travel agent. In the unlikely event you become ill after your return to the 
U.S. be sure your doctor is aware that you have recently been to east Africa.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="cust"><font size=4><strong>CUSTOMS</strong></font></a><font size=4><strong> </strong></font>&#151; Visitors are permitted to enter Kenya and Tanzania with 200 cigarettes or 50 cigars plus 1 liter bottle of wine or liquor in addition to their 
personal effects. There are no restrictions to the amount of foreign currency carried in Kenya while Tanzania still allows any amount as long as it is all exactly 
declared upon entry into the country. We recommend you enter the exact amount and not an estimate as this could create problems upon exiting Tanzania. Also we 
suggest that you count your money in advance as not to have to openly count it at the border. Export of some articles is strictly forbidden, especially products made 
in whole or in part with any type of wildlife. US Customs as well prohibits the import of any product made from endangered species of wildlife, including ivory. 
<strong>U.S. CUSTOMS </strong>Your camera equipment and jewelry should be registered with U.S. customs prior to your departure from the United States. This may be done 
in your home town if you have a Customs office there; it can also be done at Kennedy Airport though it may not be terribly convenient. In any case, keep handy the 
sales slips for these items so you can prove you bought them in the U.S. before you left. At present, returning U.S. residents are allowed to bring back $400 worth 
of merchandise duty-free. Much of what is sold in East Africa is totally exempt from U.S. duty under to &#147;GSP&#148; program; the major exception to this is textiles. 
Regulations frequently change, and if you are in doubt, ask for the pamphlet &#147;Know Before You Go&#148;, available from the Department of the Treasury, U.S. 
Customs Service, Washington, DC 20229.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="nbo_apt"><font size=4><strong>NAIROBI AIRPORT INFORMATION </strong></font></a>&#151; When you arrive in Nairobi, you will proceed through passport control before continuing to the baggage 
claim and customs areas. Be sure you have one of the landing/entry cards filled-in to save time. Once inside the luggage area (our personnel CANNOT enter this 
area) look immediately for one of the luggage carts available free of charge. Claim your luggage and pass through customs control. Our representative will be 
waiting for you just beyond the customs area and will be carrying a U.S.T. - VANTAGE sign. (Our network office in Nairobi is U.S.T. and our office is located in 
Cott&#146;s House, a short walk from the Intercontinental). <font size=4><strong>PLEASE BE PATIENT</strong></font>. You have just landed after a very long flight and there is always an amount 
of confusion at airports, especially in Africa and when several aircrafts arrive at the same time. You may not be able to see our representative immediately as he 
may be attending to other passengers, please be patient, you will find your transportation and smiling welcoming host soon after. Kenyatta Airport is just 10 miles 
from Nairobi&#146;s city center so the transfer is quite short. Airport taxes when departing Kenya are not included in your ticket and need to be paid directly at the 
airport. At the moment an airport departure tax of $ 20 per person is charged <em>(it can change at any time, please check with your guide on arrival how much 
the departure tax will be)</em> and needs to be paid in US Dollars, not in Kenyan Shillings. Traveler&#146;s cheques and coins are not accepted, so please set aside this 
amount in advance. For local flights within Kenya a local airport tax of 50 Shillings per person per flight is charged and is payable in local currency.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="bag"><font size=4><strong>BAGGAGE </strong></font></a>&#151; We recommend packing light! Baggage allowances vary considerably especially if you are on one of our programs using charter flights within 
Kenya and/or Tanzania. Internationally from/to the USA you can travel with 2 pieces of luggage (with a total weight of 44 pounds) plus 1 carry-on bag. For charter 
and regular flights within Kenya/Tanzania only 1 piece of luggage is allowed not to exceed 25 pounds! . On safari also 1 piece of luggage is allowed so any extra 
bags will need to be stored in your Nairobi hotel until the end of your tour. We also remind you that weight limits are enforced outside of the USA and any baggage 
weight in excess will have to paid a substantial freight charge which is entirely your responsibility. For all safari we urge all passengers to use soft-sided luggage 
only, at it is lighter in weight and stores better in a safari vehicle. At certain times of the year East Africa is very dusty, you may consider taking along a few large 
garbage bags in which to place your luggage before it travels from one game park to another. VANTAGE will take every possible precaution with your luggage, 
but we cannot be held responsible for any damaged or lost bag; we strongly urge you to purchase adequate baggage insurance. &#151; Should you take a domestic 
flight to the gateway city from which you depart the U.S., please ensure that you initially check your baggage only to that gateway city. Collect it there and re-check 
it for East Africa when you depart on your international flight. Rechecking your baggage at the gateway city may be inconvenient but it will lessen the likelihood of 
lost luggage. It is also a good idea to check in early for your flights. Pay close heed to baggage restrictions. On departure from the U.S. and departure from 
Tanzania, the free baggage allowance is for two pieces per person with a combined length, width and height of 106 inches (economy class) or 124 inches (first 
class). No one bag may exceed a combined 62 inches. In addition you are permitted underseat baggage with total dimensions of 45 inches. On departure from 
Kenya, <em><strong>LUGGAGE TRAVEL BY WEIGHT! </strong></em>Economy-class passengers are allowed 44 pounds and first-class passengers 66 pounds. <em><strong>EXCESS 
BAGGAGE CHARGES ARE ENFORCED AND ARE STEEP</strong></em>. Liability for damage, loss, theft or destruction of baggage is strictly limited. You are strongly 
urged to insure your baggage prior to departure. Baggage Tags: Special VANTAGE baggage tags and labels are sent with your final documents. PLEASE BE 
SURE THEY ARE ATTACHED TO ALL YOUR BAGS before you leave the U.S. They are essential for identifying your luggage to our staff and to hotel and 
lodge porters.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="elec"><font size=4><strong>ELECTRICITY</strong></font></a><font size=4><strong> </strong></font>&#151; Electricity in both Kenya and Tanzania is 230/240 volts, 50 cycles. You will also find two type of sockets: one with two thick, round 
pins, another with three rectangular prongs. We recommend having with you an international converter kit which has a complete set of adapter plugs besides the 
converter. Please also consider that most lodges produce their own electricity from generators and converters/adaptors may not work efficiently: For example, the 
average hair dryer, even when used with adapter and converter, blows up frequently in East Africa. Battery operated appliances are recommended and a flashlight 
is a definite must have. It is essential for you to have extra batteries for videocameras as rechargers may also not work efficiently.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="lang"><font size=4><strong>LANGUAGE </strong></font></a>&#151; English is spoken widely; in most of Kenya and Tanzania it is the accepted language of business. However, East Africans will be very pleased 
if you speak a few words of Swahili. </p>

<hr>
<p><a name="MEALS "><font size=4><strong>MEALS</strong></font> </a>&#151; As mentioned in the itinerary with (B,L,D) all meals are included while on Safari with full breakfast only included while at the Nairobi hotel. Some 
program, also include a Farewell Dinner in a typical restaurant, please refer to the specific tour information of the safari you are joining. <em><strong>While in KENYA </strong></em>&#151; All 
breakfasts in Kenya are full English style breakfast. Most travelers are surprised by the abundance quality and variety of the food generally served. Plenty of locally 
grown fruit is available (pineapple, avocados, mangoes, bananas, papaya etc.) and fresh vegetables are widely used. Lunches are usually lavish buffets with a wide 
selection of courses with a variety of cold cuts, fruits, vegetables etc., sometimes a full hot meal is provided. Dinners are more elaborate sit-down 4 courses affairs 
with very good an well prepared food. Tea and Coffee (Kenya produces some excellent varieties) are included in the cost of your tour while wines, soft drinks, 
beer etc. are not included but are available (the selection of wines is not great as the climate does not allow it to remain good for a long time, also wines and 
generally imported liquors are quite expensive due to custom fees). Soft drinks and local beer are quite inexpensive and good. In Lodges early morning coffee/tea is 
served before the Game Drives. <em><strong>While in TANZANIA</strong></em> &#151; Food served in Tanzania is not generally of the same quality standard as in Kenya, quantity rather than 
quality is still the ruling principle. Selection of fruits and vegetables is rather poor and meals can be monotonous. Many travelers carry some dry snacks to 
compensate this and you may find that dried fruits, nuts, granola bars etc. will be very handy while in Tanzania. Drinks are also in short supply and we may 
recommend that you use your duty free allowance to import a bottle of liquor or wine, if desired. Local beer is quite good but is usually served lukewarm due to 
lack of proper refrigeration (because of this ice is also difficult to find). Soft drinks are generally available but no diet or decaffeinated beverages are to be found.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="clim"><font size=4><strong>CLIMATE</strong></font> </a>&#151; Altogether, the East African climate must surely be one of the finest in the world. As the area lies along the equator, the temperature varies little 
throughout the year - a few degrees cooler in July and August than in January and February. Daytime highs can be expected to e in the mid to upper 70s, in the 
evening lows near 60; it is somewhat warmer along the coast and some of the drier bush country, and may be cooler in some of the upland areas like Treetops, the 
Mount Kenya Safari Club and Ngorongoro Crater, where it can actually be chilly at night! There are two rainy seasons: the &#147;long rains&#148; of April and May and the 
&#147;short rains&#148; of November. The amount of rain varies greatly from year to year. During the rainy seasons, it has the good sense to rain mostly at night, so safari 
itineraries are rarely affected. During the rains, the countryside is green and especially beautiful. An abundance of game is seen at all times of year. Another 
consequence of lying astride the equator is that the days vary little in length. Sunrise is about 6:20am and sunset at 6:30pm. More specifically: Kenya does not have 
a distinct change of season as it straddles the Equator and temperatures remain fairly constant through the year. The coast is usually hotter and more humid: 
December through March - This is &#147;summer&#148; but with weather never really hot and with cool mornings and evenings. Migration can be viewed in the Southern 
Serengeti (Tanzania) - April-May - This is the rainy season even though in these past few years there has been more rain in January than in April. It is a great time 
to visit as parks are full of animals and there are fewer tourists. The Serengeti is still the best park for viewing but the migration is starting to move towards the 
Masai Mara in Kenya - June to August - This is the coolest period with lows in the upper 40&#146;s and highs in the mid 70&#146;s The country is green and the migration is 
concentrated in the Masai Mara. - September to December - A great time to visit as it is spring-like weather. There may be some short scattered rains in 
November but they only freshen the country and settle the dust.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="cloth"><font size=4><strong>CLOTHING </strong></font></a>&#151; Travel light! Whatever you bring, you will find you took too much. In packing, keep in mind that economy-class passengers are only allowed 
44 pounds of baggage on departure from Kenya, after all souvenirs have been bought. The emphasis should be on comfort. Safari clothes should be washable and 
loose-fitting; many people find the perfect safari outfit to be a T-shirt and jeans. Cotton or cotton-synthetic combinations are preferable to pre synthetics, which 
retain heat. Safari suits are fun, though certainly not necessary; although they can be purchased in Nairobi if time permits, it is better to buy them in the U.S. before 
leaving. Neutral colors are most practical and perfect for game-viewing and a bush-jacket highly recommended for carrying film, binoculars, sunglasses, insect 
repellent, bean-bags etc.. Also note that it is illegal to wear any camouflage clothing in both Kenya and Tanzania&#146;s park reserves. Don&#146;t forget to pack a warm 
sweater for the chilly evenings you may encounter up-country. A light nylon windbreaker may come in handy early mornings or late afternoons. Also do not forget a 
swimsuit as many hotels and lodges have a swimming pool and you will be idle during the hottest hours of the day. Please do remember to have with you some 
sunscreen for the direct equatorial sun along with a good pair of glasses (with UV protection) and a brimmed hat ! </p>
<p>Informality is the order of the day; at the game lodges no one cares if you show up for dinner in the same clothes you wore during the day. The one exception to 
this is dinnertime at the Mount Kenya Safari Club, where gentlemen must wear jackets and ties and ladies skirts, dresses or elegant pants suits. Similar dress is 
appropriate for, thought not usually required if you eat out in Nairobi. For footwear, comfort is again the watchword. Although there is not ordinarily a great deal of 
hiking on most safaris, you will want a par of lightweight shoes suitable for walking; sneakers or running shoes are ideal. A pair of sandals or &#145;flip flops&#146; can be 
worn around the swimming pool. Loafers are fine for evenings. Women should avoid high- heeled shoes, which are not suitable for the terrain and anyway are 
inappropriate for the safari atmosphere. You will not need either heavy hiking boots or rubber rain boots. </p>
<p>Bring sunglasses and a collapsible sun hat, which will also serve to keep your hair free of dust. Most lodges have swimming pools, so carry a bathing suit. A 
lightweight raincoat, though not a necessity, can also serve as a topcoat or bathrobe. Surplus clothing can be stored in Nairobi or Arusha for the duration of the 
Safari, so you will not have to carry around any winter coats you may have brought. Bring a pair or two of walking shorts, but short shorts are not appropriate. <br>
Passengers visiting the crater of Ngorongoro should pack a warm sweater at any time of the year as the crater&#146;s temperatures especially from June to August are 
quite cold. We also always find useful to pack a very light raincoat. Please remember that Tanzania has a large Muslim population and modesty of dress is 
expected. This is also true on the coast of Kenya which is mainly Muslim (In Tanzania, women are not permitted to wear shorts of any kind, and neither men nor 
women are permitted to wear tight-fitting trousers).<font size=4><strong> </strong></font><font size=3><strong>LAUNDRY</strong></font> &#151; Laundry service is available at any game loge or camp where two nights or more are spent. It 
is efficient and moderately priced. Dry cleaning, on the other hand, is not available except in Nairobi and Mombasa. If you wish to do any of your washing yourself, 
bring along &#145;Woolite or soap powder.<font size=4><strong> </strong></font><font size=3><strong>MISCELLANEOUS </strong></font>&#151; Bring pocket tissues, &#147;Wash-n-Dry&#148; towelettes, washcloths, a small flashlight, insect repellent, 
and a traveling alarm clock. You will find innumerable uses for various-sized plastic bags. And don&#146;t forget suntan lotion, aspirin and other medication, band-aids 
and whatever else you normally pack in your toilet kit. Bring a needle and thread. A jeweler&#146;s screwdriver can come in very handy for fixing eyeglasses and making 
minor repairs on cameras and lenses.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="time"><font size=4><strong>TIME CHANGE</strong></font></a><font size=4><strong> </strong></font>&#151; By the time you arrive in Nairobi, you will have jumped a 7-8 hour time period. Your body will need to adjust, so take it easy the first 
day.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="cur"><font size=4><strong>CURRENCY </strong></font></a>&#151; East African currency CANNOT be taken out of Kenya or Tanzania. The amount of dollars or other currency you bring will depend on you 
appetite for souvenirs, drinks, personal purchases, etc. However as all essential items for your safari are included, there is no need to bring large sums. When 
entering Kenya or Tanzania you will be required to declare all money you are bringing in on a currency declaration form, which you will receive on the airplane. 
Don&#146;t forget to have it stamped when changing money. You will have to return it on your departure from Kenya or Tanzania. Traveler&#146;s checks or cash dollars can 
be exchanged at banks and at most hotels and lodges. Credit cards such as Visa and American Express are accepted at many Kenya hotels but at few shops, and 
at very few places altogether in Tanzania. When leaving Kenya, you can change any remaining Kenya money back to dollars at the airport, PROVIDED YOU 
PRODUCE YOUR CURRENCY DECLARATION FORM. When leaving Tanzania, you will probably not be able to obtain dollars, so you will have to plan to 
spend any Tanzania shillings still in your possession.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="saf"><font size=4><strong>SAFETY</strong></font> </a>&#151; East African cities are relatively safe compared to their American counterparts, but you should exercise the same common sense care you would in 
the U.S. or Europe. Don&#146;t carry around large amounts of cash, hang on to handbags and don&#146;t walk in unlit areas at night. Beware of con artists with bogus &#147;hard 
luck&#148; stories and people who offer to change your money at inflated rates. Do not leave cash, jewelry or traveler&#146;s checks unattended in your hotel room. Every 
lodge or hotel will be happy to place them in safe deposit for you. Take your passport on safari with you; do not leave it in storage in Nairobi or elsewhere. You 
may need to produce it when changing money. Remember that many of the game lodges are in the bush and that wild animals may enter the lodge compound, 
especially at night. When walking at night between your room and the dining area in such lodges, stay on the lit pathways and wait for a guard to escort you. &#151; 
Western media coverage of events in Kenya has portrayed a country in turmoil. In fact the situation is under control thanks to the deployment of special police units 
and rangers who are flushing out poachers who had taken to robbing some isolated tour buses as an easier alternative to poaching. As in the old days (1970&#146;s), an 
armed game ranger now escorts cars on game drives.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="tree"><font size=4><strong>TREETOPS/THE ARK - ABERDARES </strong></font></a>&#151; Only one overnight bag per person (plus camera bag) may be taken to Treetops or The Ark; large 
suitcases are left in storage until the following day at the Outspan Hotel (Treetops) or the Aberdare Country Club (The Ark). Remember to pack your flight bag 
with toilet items and night clothes the night before. </p>
<hr>
<p><a name="sun"><font size=4><strong>THE SUN </strong></font></a>&#151; You will be near the equator, at an altitude of several thousand feet above sea level, and it is possible to burn very quickly under those conditions. 
Keep your exposure to the sun moderate. During the middle of the day, on no account should you sunbathe for more than 30 minutes at a time. Bring a lightweight 
hat and suntan lotion.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="sing"><font size=4><strong>SINGLE ROOMS</strong></font></a><font size=4><strong> </strong></font>&#151; Please note that neither we nor anyone else can guarantee single rooms, since the capacity of the lodges is small. If you signed up for a 
single room, let us know at the end of the trip if you had to share, and where, so that we can forward the necessary refund. <font size=4><strong>At Treetops, The Ark and 
Mountain Lodge, there are no single rooms and no private bathrooms. </strong><em><strong>This has been taken into account in computing the 
single room supplement.</strong></em></font></p>
<hr>
<p><a name="fly"><font size=4><strong>FLYING DOCTORS ENROLLMENT</strong></font></a> &#151; As part of your VANTAGE EAST AFRICA safari, you will be enrolled in the Flying Doctors Society. 
This will enable you, in the event of an emergency on safari, to be evacuated by air to the nearest medical center, usually Nairobi. Even the most remote lodges and 
camps have radio-telephones that permit communication with Nairobi, where the Flying Doctors are based. Excellent medical care is available in Nairobi, including 
several outstanding hospitals. </p>
<hr>
<p><a name="tip"><font size=4><strong>TIPPING</strong></font></a><font size=4><strong> </strong></font>&#151; On most safaris general tips are included. However it is a normal practice to tip hotel and lodge porters and waiters. For drinks at the bar and 
extra meals, ten percent is the applicable rule of thumb. A tip of about five shillings for some small extra service is appropriate. At your discretion, if you have 
received good service, it is customary to tip your driver/guide at the end of the safari. $4-$7 per person per day is an approximate guideline.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="sho"><font size=4><strong>SHOPPING/SOUVENIRS </strong></font></a>&#151; East Africa offers excellent value for many items. A very incomplete list of things you may wish to take home:</p>

<p>Some outstanding jewelry is available. A green garnet known as &#147;Tsavonite&#148; is locally mined; some specimens may be especially high in quality. a translucent blue 
stone locally known as &#147;Tanzanite&#148; (the mineral is called zoisite) is lovely. Locally produced rubies are excellent. Gold and silverwork has been practiced, 
particularly along the coast, for centuries; some fine old pieces can still be found. Malachite and tiger-eye of varying quality are widely sold, even though they are 
not actually mined in Kenya or Tanzania. Please note that VANTAGE assumes no responsibility for any purchases made by you while traveling. If clients 
specifically ask for a type of shop to patronize, our local people, AS A COURTESY to the clients, will refer them to a local shop. This is NOT an endorsement of 
the shop by Vantage and no responsibility is taken for any articles purchased at the shop. Further no responsibility is taken for follow-up if merchandise bought in 
Africa is not received by the clients or if it is received in unsatisfactory conditions. We suggest that you bring your purchases home with you as it may take a very 
long time to receive any article back in the USA. Also do not buy anything of high value unless you are completely sure of what you are buying. Unless you are an 
expert in gems, antiques etc. do not assume that the quality and value is as represented by the vendor. <a name="GAME TROPHIES"><font size=4><strong>GAME TROPHIES</strong></font></a> &#151; In Kenya, it is illegal to sell 
any product made from a wild animal, including ivory, hides, and skins, rhinoceros horn, elephant-hair bracelets, crocodile handbags and so on. In Tanzania, certain 
items may be legally sold, provided an official permit is supplied at the time of sale. But please note it is ILLEGAL to bring to the U.S. Anything made from 
elephant, rhino or crocodile. </p>
<hr>
<p><a name="gift"><font size=4><strong>GIFT-GIVING</strong></font></a> &#151; Travelers to East Africa take pleasure in giving out little gifts especially to children they encounter while on safari. This has unfortunately 
created a problem and has started children into begging. Children are now skipping school classes in order to stand near the area where tourists are. Village elders 
are very disturbed at the effect this is having on their social traditions. We urge all passengers NOT to give any gifts directly to begging children! If you are inclined 
to give a gift please tell your driver or UST&#146;s office in Nairobi instead: we will see that the gift is passed on to a charitable organization or directly to a village elder 
or a school. <em><strong>THANK YOU! </strong></em></p>
<hr>
<p><a name="bin"><font size=4><strong>BINOCULARS</strong></font> </a>&#151; Regardless of whether you plan to take photographs, it is absolutely essential you bring a good pair of binoculars, preferably one pair per 
person, since it can be annoying to have to pass them back and forth when trying to look at something interesting. The magnification should be in the region of 7 - 
10 power, and they should be as light as possible. Bring binoculars with you from the U.S., as you will not be able to count on renting them in East Africa.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="read"><font size=4><strong>Recommended Reading:</strong></font></a><font size=4><strong> </strong></font><br>
Books about Africa are notoriously difficult to obtain in the United States; in general they are more readily available in Nairobi. Some are of the &#147;coffee table&#148; 
variety and may weigh down your baggage and lighten your wallet. Many are out of print. <br>
Two bookstores may be helpful. The Travellers Bookstore, 22 West 52nd St., New York, NY 10019, has a generous selection of books about Africa, and 
accepts telephone orders at (212) 664-0995. The Audubon Book Shop, 1621 Wisconsin Ave. N.W., Washington, DC 20007 carries field guides and other 
nature books, it will accept telephone orders at (202) 337-6062.<br>
&#147;A Field Guide to the National Parks of East Africa&#148;, by John Williams<br>
&#147;A Field Guide to the Birds of East Africa&#148;, by John Williams and Norman Arlott<br>
&#147;A Field Guide to the Larger Mammals of Africa&#148;, by Jean Dorst and Pierre Dandelot<br>
&#147;The Wild Flowers of Kenya&#148;, by Michael Blundell</p>
<p>You will want to read up on the habits of the animals you see. The best single book for doing this is &#147;Portraits in the wild&#148; by Cynthia Moss (University of Chicago 
Press, 1982), which has chapters on most of the prominent species you will encounter. &#147;A Wildlife Guide&#148; by David Western has illuminating descriptions of 
common species and also serves as a guide to Kenya&#146;s Amboseli National Park. &#147;Pyramids of Life&#148; by John Reader and Harvey Croze (Lippincott, 1976) gives an 
excellent view of how the various plants and animals in the ecosystem relate to each other, and has marvelous photographs. &#147;Africa&#151;A Natural History&#148; by Leslie 
Brown (Random House, 1965) shows many parts of the continent and has excellent descriptions of habitats and animals.<br>
Several interesting accounts have been published by wildlife researchers of their experiences. Notable among these are &#147;Among the Elephants&#148; by Lain and Orea 
Douglas-Hamilton (Viking, 1976), &#147;Folding Shadows, Flying Hooves&#148; by George Schaller (Knopf, 1973) and the classic &#147;Serengeti Shall Not Die&#148; by Bernhard 
and Michael Grzimek (Dutton, 1961). Many great wildlife photographers have worked in East Africa, and four outstanding collections are: &#147;Savage Paradise&#148; by 
Hugo van Lawick (Collins, 1977), &#147;Elephants&#148; by Reingard Kunkel (Abrams, 1982). &#147;Safari&#148; by Gunter Ziesler and Angelika Hlfer (Facts On File, 1984) and 
&#147;Last Days in Eden&#148; (Amaryllis, 1984) by Elspeth Huxley and Hugo van Lawick. &#147;The Africans&#148; by David Lamb offers many insights into current African political, 
economic and social life.</p>
<p>Readable books about East African history are hard to find. &#147;Out of Africa&#148; by Karen Blixen, who wrote under the pen name of Isak Dinesen, is a classic of 
literature, and interesting in its description of Kenya in the early years or the twentieth century. The well-known &#147;The Flame Trees of Thika&#148; by Elspeth Huxley 
describes the period of colonial settlement. &#147;The Lunatic Express&#148; by Charles Miller (Macmillan, 1970) is an entertaining account of the period of exploration and 
early colonial times. &#147;Zamani&#148;, edited by B. Ogot (Longman, 1973) is a collection of essays about the Kenyan past.</p>
<p>Books about the peoples of East Africa are also scarce. &#147;Peoples and Cultures of Kenya&#148; by Andrew Fedders and Cynthia Salvadori (Rex Collings, 1982) 
contains short descriptions of the customs and history of most of the tribes of Kenya. The enormous book called &#147;Maasai&#148; by Carol Beckwith and Tepilit ole 
Saitoti (Abrams, 1980) has an excellent account of the life of a tribe that arouses the curiosity of many visitors&#160;</p>

<h3><a name="film"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=4>FILM:</font></font></a></h3>
<p>With regard to film, no matter what kind of equipment you use, we strongly recommend that you buy all your film before you leave. It is expensive in Africa, 
approximately $12 per roll. If you own a pair of binoculars, by all means bring them. When photographing Africans, remember that dark skins reflect very little 
light, so do open the aperture by at least on stop. The advice of your driver should be sought before photographing local people. While some Masai eagerly pose 
for shots, others believe that their souls will be stolen if their pictures are taken. And it is also against the law to take pictures of the Masai. Frequent stops are made 
for close-up shots of animals and birds. Camera supports are unnecessary since picture taking is done from inside the safari buses. However, a bean bag is useful 
to steady the lens. The sunroofs in the mini-buses will enable you to stand for shots, and the lighting at the game lodges is perfect for evening photography. Your 
camera when not in use should be protected by a dust-proof bag. The following list will be helpful: </p>
<dir>
<li>Minimum of 12 to 15 rolls of film</li>
<li>2 lenses (50 mm and zoom)</li>
<li>lens tissue</li>
<li>dust-off</li>
<li>extra batteries</li>
<li>film type 30% fast (400)</li>
<li>70% asa 64/100</li>
<li>camera bag</li>
<li>skylight filter</li>
<li>A polarized filter can be helpful to the experienced photographer.</li>
</dir>
<hr>
<h3><a name="equip"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=4>KNOW YOUR EQUIPMENT:</font></font></a><font color="#FF0000"><font size=4> </font></font></h3>
<p>The first rule is <strong>NEVER</strong> to go on safari with camera equipment that is new to you. If you feel like borrowing a camera or investing in some new paraphernalia 
before setting out, by all means do so, but obtain it several weeks before you leave, become thoroughly familiar with it, and shoot several test rolls of film. The cost 
will be very low compared to the value to you of your safari pictures. Allow time to have the film developed and to have any faults in the equipment rectified before 
you set out. This may take weeks, so plan ahead. Be completely comfortable with everything you take. All too often I have seen people wrestling with cameras and 
lenses that were too big, too heavy or too complicated, and as a result losing good pictures. It is much better to have equipment that can be used readily than to 
spend a lot of money for apparatus whose operation you can&#146;t understand. Bring along everything you need, and don&#146;t count on being able to rent or replace any 
items in East Africa. Far and away the most appropriate and flexible kind of camera for safari photography is the 35mm single lens reflex. It is hand-holdable, 
accepts different lenses and displays in the viewfinder an image close to what the final print or slide will look like. The camera should have a built-in light meter for 
easy exposure setting. Many of the newer models offer automatic exposure, which is controversial; many pros prefer to make all adjustments manually. However, I 
find that I am able to expose about 80 percent of my pictures with the camera set on automatic, and that often saves valuable time when trying to get a picture in a 
hurry.<font color="#FF0000"><font size=4> VIDEO EQUIPMENT: </font></font>A safari is a very &quot;photogenic&quot; experience, and if you carry a video recorder, you are sure to be well rewarded. Bring 
equipment as light in weight as possible. The only problem arises with battery power. Most minibuses have cigarette lighters that, with the appropriate adapter, may 
be used for operating your camera. However, it is possible that several people may want to use the lighter simultaneously! It may not always be possible to 
recharge batteries at the game lodges. Where possible, you will need an adapter for 220-240 volt current, along with converters for two-pin round and three-pin 
square plugs. Perhaps the best thing possible to bring with you enough fresh batteries to last the entire trip, although that may be a bulky and costly solution. 
<font color="#FF0000"><font size=4>OTHER USEFUL DEVICES: </font></font>If you are serious about your photography or would be heartbroken if you were to miss out on any photo opportunities, you 
might want to consider bringing a second camera, preferably of the same model as your first one, or at least accepting the same lenses. It is most unlikely that you 
would be able to have any major camera repair done quickly while you are on safari. Another advantage of a second camera is being able to keep a second type of 
film and another lens ready for use at all times. A jeweler&#146;s screwdriver is very handy for performing minor repairs along the way!</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="tec"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=4>NOTES ON TECHNIQUE: </font></font></a></h3>
<p>Being a good wildlife photographer involves a combination of patience and quickness of hand. Wait for the shots you want and be prepared to put in plenty of time, 
sometimes in the hot sun, if you want outstanding pictures. Be as ready as possible to shoot. That means presetting your camera as closely as possible to what is the 
most likely focus and exposure. If your camera has automatic exposure, leave it set on automatic unless you are sure that conditions warrant otherwise. Once again, 
it is vital that you be thoroughly familiar with your camera so that you don&#146;t have to fumble with it at the critical moment.</p>
<p>Be generous in your use of film. If you see something that is especially worth photographing, take several pictures. Try several different exposures because too 
often, film comes back scratched or spoiled in some way. Or you may send your film in to have prints made and gave it either lost or damaged. If this should 
happen, you will then always have another copy.</p>
<p>When using telephoto lenses, try as hard as possible to minimize camera vibration. Make sure your driver switches off the engine of your vehicle. Prop the camera 
up on a window ledge or on the roof, using if possible a bean bag, and use fast shutter speeds. Practice releasing the shutter without jarring the camera. The classic 
rule of thumb is that you should not try to hand-hold a camera at a shutter speed slower than the inverse of the focal length of your lens. Translated into English, that 
means that if you are using a lens of 200mm, you should use a shutter speed of 1/20, 1/500 or faster. If you are using a 50mm lens, you can manage with a shutter 
speed of 1/60, 1/125 or faster.</p>
<p>Be aware of the angle from which the sunlight is coming. Most of your shots will look best if the sun is behind you and your camera, and the subject directly 
illuminated. Your driver will be aware of this and try to position the vehicle at the best possible angle. But you may want to try for unusual effects such as 
backlighting: if you do, make sure you know how to set your camera&#146;s exposure meter so that it isn&#146;t fooled by the extraneous light in the background.</p>
<p>Even though you will make frequent use of the roof hatch of your vehicle, don&#146;t neglect the view from the windows. A lower angle of view may allow a more 
dramatic view of, for example, a large animal like a giraffe or elephant. The knack of photographic composition is to some extent unteachable, but before you leave 
on safari you might want to study some books of wildlife photography to see what makes for good pictures. One thing the great photographers have in common is a 
feel for the context in which animals occur. They often include in the frame something of the landscape and background.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="len"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=4>LENSES:</font></font></a><font color="#FF0000"><font size=4> </font></font></h3>
<p>A telephoto lens is a necessity for wildlife photography. The newer telephoto zoom lenses are virtually as good in quality as fixed focal length lenses, and I 
recommend them highly for their flexibility. It is possible to get so close to animals such as lions that a fixed lens of 200mm is actually too long: with the zoom you 
simply adjust the lens. The appropriate focal length for a telephoto zoom is in the range of approximately 80-200mm.</p>
<p>A super-long telephoto lens of 400mm or more is not necessary, unless you are a very experienced photographer with a keen interest in photographing birds. Long 
lenses are unwieldy, hard to focus, and call for a steady and experienced hand. Protect your lenses by putting a filter over each one. A 1A Skylight or UV filter 
does not cut down the light and is useful in screening out haze. And if anything should hit the lens, you would certainly prefer to damage a $10 filter than an 
expensive lens. I simply leave a filter permanently attached to each of my lenses. You will probably not need any other filters except, if you are so inclined, for a 
polarizing filter to make clouds stand out vividly. It is essential to put shades on your lenses, since glare can all too easily ruin your pictures. This is particularly true 
for telephoto lenses; some of the longer ones come with built-in hoods. </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=3>KEEP YOUR CAMERA AND LENSES CLEAN! </font></font>Fingerprints or dust on your lens can effectively spoil your shots. Bring a blower brush, lens cleaning fluid and 
lens tissue. Sprays such as &quot;Dust Off&quot; are very handy and take up very little space (but be sure not to use them on the mirror of your camera). &quot;Q-tips&quot; are useful in 
cleaning in the nooks and crannies. Check your equipment frequently to be sure it is clean. It is painful to see someone who has spent a small fortune on equipment 
taking pictures through smudged lenses.</p>
<p>A compact electronic flash is a necessity for taking pictures at your lodge or camp at night, or indoors. Although Treetops, The Ark and Mountain Lodge frown on 
the use of flash, it is sometimes permissible if the animals in question have been at the water hole for a while and every one has had a good look. The newer 
electronic flashes operate automatically, but you should in any case fully understand how to use your flash before you leave.</p>
<p>Much has been written about whether airport X-ray machines damage film. The latest evidence is that some do; at any rate the effect is cumulative, and if your films 
pass through several machines you may find them fogged. Invest in a lead-lined &quot;Film Shield&quot; bag, and always ask customs inspectors to check your camera 
equipment by hand. Many will cooperate in doing so. It is absolutely essential that your cameras be protected from vibration and dust. I strongly recommend a 
foam-lined camera bag on the floor of a moving vehicle; the vibration may loosen screws or otherwise cause damage. Leave your cameras on a vacant seat or 
carry them on your lap. And bring a supply of plastic bags and rubber bands to keep dust off.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="sug"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=4>USEFUL SUGGESTIONS: </font></font></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Always check that you reset your ASA setting to the specifications of the film you are using</li>
<li>Rest your camera in a position that provides a firm base when taking a picture (a bean-bag is very useful here)</li>
<li>Pictures taken from the roof-hatch, even if beautiful, may not make as much of an imposing portrait as the picture taken at eye level from a window</li>
<li>Be sure you know how to operate your camera and are familiar with all aspects of it</li>
<li>Compose your picture taking into consideration the background </li>
<li>Please take time BEFORE YOU DEPART, to learn about shutter speed and depth of focus in order to take the best possible shots under any circumstances<hr>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="eti"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=4>PHOTOGRAPHY ETIQUETTE: </font></font></a></h3>
<p>Always ask permission before taking photos of other people and always be considerate of anyone's wish not to be photographed. Under no circumstances take 
pictures of airports, government buildings and installations or of military compounds and personnel. Taking photos where permission is not granted can result, at 
best, in confiscation of your film.<br>
Please be also conscious that you will be with other people, as eager as you are to take the greatest photo of their life. Share the best views with other fellow 
passengers and do not disturb their pleasure by making unnecessary noises, creating a commotion, or impeding their view and picture taking. Do not stand up 
suddenly in the vehicle as this may cause a subject to take flight before anyone has the time to photograph it</p>

<h3><a name="HARARE">HARARE</a></h3>
<p>Zimbabwe's capital, a city of over 800~000 people was blessed by its planners with open spaces, flowering trees and gardens. It offers sophisticated restaurants, 
art galleries and traditional craft centers, while nature lovers can enjoy Ewanrigg Aloe Gardens, the National Botanic Gardens, or the wildlife of Mukivisi 
Woodlands, Larvon Bird Gardens, and Lake Chiwero. Accommodation: Meikles, Monomatapa, Jameson, Sheraton, Holiday Inn, Bronte, Courtney Hotels.</p>
<h3><a name="EASTERN HIGHLANDS">EASTERN HIGHLANDS</a></h3>
<p>Zimbabwe's eastern border offers some of its most spectacular scenery - the mountain ranges of Nyanga, Vumba and Chimanimani. Nyanga evokes images of 
Scotland, with heather covered hills and trout streams. The Vumba's misty heights and precipitous roads hide country hotels of great charm, while Chimanimani's 
rugged peaks are a backpackers? delight and home to Zimbabwe&#146;s Outward Bound adventure school. Linked by excellent roads, the Eastern Highlands can entice 
visitors for a quiet weekend or a week of exploration. Hotels: Troutbeck, Montclair, Rhodes Nyanga, Brondesbury Park, Pine Tree Inn, White Horse Inn, Impala 
Arms, Wise Owl, Manica Hotel, Leopard Rock, Chimanimani, Chipinge.</p>
<h3><a name="BULAWAYO/MATOBOS REGION">BULAWAYO/MATOBOS REGION</a></h3>
<p>Bulawayo is Zimbabwe's second largest city and capital of Matabeleland. Its streets are &quot;wide enough to turn an ox-wagon around&quot;. Apart from its excellent 
Natural History Museum, the Railway Museum, and craft centers, Bulawayo is also gateway to the Matobos National Park, with its distinctive rocky hills, noted for 
white and black rhino and eagle species, as well as the grave of Cecil Rhodes and some of the finest rock art in Africa. Nearby are Kame Ruins, and Chipanga]i 
Wildlife Trust. While most packaged tours bypass Bulawayo, it is well worth the visit and easily scheduled.</p>
<h3><a name="GREAT ZIMBABWE">GREAT ZIMBABWE</a></h3>
<p>The Great Zimbabwe ruins, which gave the country its name, were built around the 13th century by the dynasty of the period. From here they traded ivory and gold 
as far as Arabia and China. The civilization collapsed for ecological reasons and conflict with other tribes around 1470. The ruins remained hidden until the 
mid-19th century. Early European explorers mistook them for Ophir or the realm of the Queen of Sheba. However modern archaeology has firmly placed their 
origin as local. Built entirely without mortar, the massive stone walls of Zimbabwe represent as great a construction effort as the castles and cathedrals of medieval 
Europe.</p>
<hr>
<h3>ZIMBABWE NATIONAL PARKS</h3>
<p>The largest concentrations of wildlife are found in the national parks. No commercial development is allowed within these areas. All hotels and lodges lie outside the 
park boundaries. Tented camps are permitted in designated areas. Among the more famous of Zimbabwe's National Parks are:</p>
<h3><a name="vic">VICTORIA FALLS</a></h3>
<p>Victoria Falls is the emblem of Zimbabwe. 5600 feet (1700 m) wide and dropping 420 feet (128 m) into the Zambezi Gorge, the falls create a roar--and a cloud of 
mist--so great that they are perceptible from a distance of 25 miles (40 km). David Livingstone named them after the queen of England. The best time to visit is 
between September and November. During March and April, when the water volume is at its peak, the falls create so much mist that they are difficult to see, and 
from May to September the mist adds to the season's high humidity. The Victoria Falls are twice the size of Niagara and the immediate surrounds of the falls have 
been left as natural as possible, with no artificial barriers to impede you. Accommodation: Victoria Falls Hotel, Makasa Sun, Rainbow, A'Zambezi, Sprayview, 
Elephant Hills, Victoria Falls Safari Lodge.</p>
<p>All sorts of activities are offered at Victoria Falls, including bungee jumping, small plane flights over the falls, and raft trips to the Boiling Pot at their base. Victoria 
Falls is also the center for some of the best safari and adventure opportunities in Africa. Above the falls, outstanding canoe and kayaking safaris are available, 
offering one of the most exciting and memorable ways to experience both the Zambezi and the abundant game of Zambezi National Park. Below the falls, the 
Zambezi becomes a whitewater rafting paradise. The rafting trips that run through the river's gorges are internationally known as the most exciting, and least 
dangerous, to be found anywhere. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="kari">LAKE KARIBA</a></h3>
<p>Downstream from Victoria Falls you find this enormous (almost 2000 sq. mi.) man-made lake. Formed in 1958 by damming the Zambezi at Kariba, the lake now 
offers scattered islands, clear waters, and and adjoining game reserve. The reserve, Matusadona National Park, was begun as a refuge for animals saved from the 
rising waters of the lake itself. Today it has an abundance of game gathering along the lake shore, particularly in the dry months. Viewing is very easy from the 
water. Zimbabwe's fine small houseboat lodges are located here, and the Lake also serves as the starting point for canoe safaris to Mana Pools National Park. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="mana">MANA POOLS PARK</a></h3>
<p>The next major attraction along the Zambezi is Mana Pools, a region in which the Zambezi slows and spreads out into a multitude of small ponds and pools. From 
the evergreen Natal Mahoganies to the acacias which provide a major food source in the dry season, to the impenetrable jesse bush, Mana is a constantly changing 
ecology, home to elephant, rhino, lion' leopard, buffalo, waterbuck, kudu, impala, hippo, crocodiles and spectacular flocks of birds. Canoe safaris to and through 
the Mana Pools during this time of year are stupendous experiences. Another attraction of this park is that walking safaris are the only other means of touring 
allowed in certain sections, ensuring not only quiet but also many fewer signs of other visitors. Safaris on foot are a Mana feature. Accommodation: Chikwenya and 
Ruckomechi Lodges' or tented camps. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="HWANGE PARK">HWANGE PARK</a></h3>
<p>The largest national park and most famous, over 5,000 square miles in the Northwest of Zimbabwe. It enjoys one of the highest concentrations of wildlife in the 
country, and is the particularly renowned for its great numbers of elephant. Like Kruger National Park in South Africa. Apart from the well developed Main Camp 
area, it has numerous private safari lodges along its northern and eastern borders, and excellent tented camps in its drier southern part. Hwange is known for its 
large elephant herds, but over 107 animal species and 430 bird species are found there. Accommodation: Hwange Safari Lodge, Sikumi, Sable Valley, Ivory Safari 
Lodge, Jabulisa, JiJima~ Linkwasha tented camp, Makalolo tented camp</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="MATUSADONA">MATUSADONA</a></h3>
<p>Created along the shore of Lake Kariba, and backed by the impressive purple majesty of the Matusadona Mountains, this reserve has a burgeoning buffalo 
population, thanks to the lush torpedo grass growing along the lake. The buffalo form the main prey for lion, so that Matusadona has some of the largest prides of 
lion in Zimbabwe, as well as elephant, leopard, hippo, zebra, impala and many other species. The lake offers excellent fishing, which may account for the size of the 
crocodiles basking beside it. Game-viewing by boat allows freedom of movement and a close approach without disturbing the game. Accommodation: Bumi Hills, 
Tiger Bay, Sanyati Lodge, Fothergill Island, Spurwing Island, Lake Wilderness, Water Wilderness.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="CHIZARIRA">CHIZARIRA</a></h3>
<p>Chizarira is the most remote and rugged of Zimbabwe's national parks. It is home to excellent rhino populations. Few visitors manage to penetrate its undeveloped 
state. There are few roads and only basic campsites within the park. Game-viewing is on foot, stalking the game through the park. Accommodation: Tented camps, 
Chete Lodge. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="KAZUMA PAN">KAZUMA PAN</a></h3>
<p>Kazuma Pan is a haven for birdlife, as well as home to roan antelope, tsessebe, cheetah, rhino, giraffe and many other species. Teak forests edge its open grassy 
plains. Accommodation: Tented campsites, or nearby luxury lodges such as Vakatsha.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ZAMBEZI NATIONAL PARK">ZAMBEZI NATIONAL PARK</a></h3>
<p>Upriver from the Victoria Falls, Zambezi National Park is known for its concentration of elephant and magnificent sable antelope herds. Game-viewing tours or 
camping safaris can be arranged from Victoria Falls. Accommodation: Imbabala and Westwood lodges, tented camping. </p>

<hr>
<p>The independent landlocked country of Botswana is one of Africa's best-kept secrets, having been spared the exploitation and turmoil of other parts of the 
continent. It offers one of the last unspoilt wildernesses in Africa, with unfenced game reserves where the largest herds in southern Africa roam free and wild 
alongside some of the continent's most spectacular and varied birdlife. The great Kalahari Desert covers two-thirds of the country, yet the world's largest inland 
delta - the Okavango - transforms 5,800 square miles of potential desert into a paradise of palms, papyrus and crystal-clear waterways. AlI the elements of an 
ageless African experience are to be found throughout the Okavango and Kalahari, combined with the Chobe and Moremi National Parks and the Makgadikgadi 
Salt Palms. The principal areas of population are to be found in the capital city of Gaborone, noted for its national museum, craft shops and open-air markets; and 
the townships of Maun and Francistown. May to October is the best game-viewing period. These are the dry winter months when game is concentrated around 
available water. The bush is brown and dried out, making the animals easier to spot. </p>
<h3><a name="oka">OKAVANGO DELTA</a></h3>
<p>One of the last utterly unspoilt regions of the world, this is a maze of waterways, lagoons, islands and flood plains on the northern edge of the Kalahari Desert. 
Home to about 36 species of mammals, 200 species of birds, 80 species of fish and a wealth of flora, the Okavango was created by shifts of the earth's surface 
forcing a river system away from its natural path (to the Indian Ocean), to form the greatest inland delta in the world. Game to be seen here includes elephant, 
buffalo, lion, leopard, cheetah, hippo, rhino, kudu, crocodile, and the rare and elusive sitatunga.</p>
<h3><a name="moremi">MOREMI WILDLIFE RESERVE</a></h3>
<p>Covering 700 square miles in the north-east corner of the Okavango, this is one of the most beautiful - and perhaps the most spectacular -game reserves in 
southern Africa. It was created by the baTwana tribe on whose land it is situated. The few sand tracks to be found here wind between trees, around lagoons filled 
with water lilies, crocodiles and the occasional hippo.</p>
<h3><a name="chobe">CHOBE NATIONAL PARK</a></h3>
<p>The 4,500-square-mile home of a splendid variety of wildlife, including white rhinoceros and elephants who move in their thousands along well-worn paths of the 
Chobe River every afternoon in search of water. Also to be seen at the river's edge are herds of buffalo, hippo, lechwe, kudu, impala, roan and puku. The most 
popular areas of the park - a maze of swamps, floods plains, fossil lake beds, pans, rivers and forests -are the Linyanti-Savuti region in the south-west and 
Northern Chobe along the banks of the Chobe River.</p>

<hr>
<p><font color="#804040"><strong>Namibia - </strong></font>in southwest Africa, is a large and mainly barren country sharing borders with Angola to the north, Botswana to the east, South Africa to the south and, 
in the Caprivi Strip, a narrow panhandle of Namibian territory jutting from the northeast corner of the country, with Zambia and Zimbabwe. It is a country of 
compelling beauty, abundant sunshine, and a feeling of unconfined space. With its unspoilt landscapes, wide horizons, clear unpolluted skies and a population 
density which is among the lowest in the world it creates a sense of freedom in ebveryone. Along its entire length, the vast shifting sand dunes of the Namib Desert 
spread inland for 50 to 80 miles. In the interior one finds the vast sand basin of the Kalahari. In the far northwest the 25,500 sq miles of the Kaokoland mountains 
run along the coast, while further inland lies the Etosha Pan (a dried-out saline lake), surrounded by grasslands and bush which support a large and varied wildlife. 
The Etosha National Park &amp; Game Reserve is one of the finest in Africa, in that it remains, to a large extent, free of man's influence. To the west is 1280km (795 
miles) of some of the most desolate and lonely coastline in the world. The port of Walvis Bay, situated roughly halfway down Namibia's coast, was returned by 
South Africa to Namibian jurisdiction in February 1994. Namibia is the first country in the world to include protection of the environment and sustainable utilization 
of wildlife in its constitution. About 15,5 % of the country has been set aside as national parks. In these areas, rare and endangered species of animals, birds and 
plantlife are preserved and protected, a living reminder to us and the future generations, of how Africa once was before man ruined it.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="wind">WINDHOEK</a></h3>
<p>The capital is an attractive city surrounded by clusters of hills and the impressive Auas and Eros Mountains. The height above sea level is only slightly less than that 
of Johannesburg, South Africa, or Denver, the `mile-high' city in the United States. The climate is typical of a semi-desert country, with hot days and cool nights. 
The continental-style sidewalk cafes and beer gardens add to the relaxed atmosphere enhanced by stately historic buildings in the German architectural style of the 
turn of the century. Old buildings which lend a singular charm to the city include the historic seat of government which is known as the Tintenpalast, meaning Palace 
of Ink, and the Christuskirche with its graceful spire which provides the city with a striking landmark. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="fish">FISH RIVER CANYON</a></h3>
<p>One of the natural wonders of Africa is the Fish River Canyon. The 161 km long, 27 km wide ravine with a maximum depth of 550 m is surrounded by high, 
forbidding cliffs, and is gashed into the plateau with startling abruptness. The awesome grandeur of the canyon is surpassed only by the Grand Canyon in the USA. 
A road running for 25 km along the eastern edge of the canyon leads to a series of viewing sites with splendid views of this grand, sombre and immensely powerful 
natural phenomenon. Hiking through the canyon is a popular endurance test for the hardy, and regarded by hikers as the ultimate challenge. The hike starts from the 
main look-out point and ends at the hot springs resort of Ai-Ais, a distance of some 90 km. Open only between the beginning of May and the end of September, 
this trail through the great ravine takes up to five days to complete. A medical certificate of fitness is required, due to the strenuous nature of the trail. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="namib">THE NAMIB</a></h3>
<p>The Namib-Naukluft Park, covering over 49 768 km2 is not only the largest nature conservation area in Namibia, but is rated as the fourth largest in the world, as 
well as being the most unusual. Landscapes range from an impressive mountain mass to desert plains and high dunes, from deep gorges to an estuarine lagoon. For 
the connoisseur of scenery, atmosphere and the unusual, there is nothing quite like the Namib. It has an essence of timelessness, and, depending on the time of day 
there is a shift of moods, a play of light and shadow, giving desert landscapes entirely new tints and textures. The Welwitschia Nature Drive ranges from vast plains 
where herds of oryx, springbok and zebra roam, to the eerie landscape of the badlands, known as the &quot;valley of the moon&quot; in the Swakop River valley. </p>
<p>The Sossusvlei area is a dune wonderland, with towering dunes up to 300 m high surrounding a huge, dried-up pan. Dunes extend as far as the eye can see and 
their rich tints vary from pale apricot to vivid reds and oranges. During a good rainy season the Tsauchab River flows into the pan which creates a haven for water 
birds. Even during the dry season, oryx, springbok and ostriches can be seen feeding off the sparse vegetation along the water courses. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="swa">SWAKOPMUND</a></h3>
<p>Swakopmund, Namibia's seaside resort on the west coast is a place of singular charm, and resembles a small Bavarian village nestling between the desert and the 
sea. It has a restful and relaxing atmosphere with promenades, palm trees and beautifully tended public gardens. The particular attraction of the town lies in the fact 
that one can enjoy the wild beauty of the desert and the sea and yet be within easy reach of the solid comfort of Swakopmund's hotels and restaurants. The source 
of Swakopmund's continental atmosphere is the graceful art nouveau buildings dating back to the turn of the century. The local jail, for example, resembles a 
country mansion, and the railway station is a magnificently ornate building. Eleven of these charming old buildings are national monuments. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="skel">THE SKELETON COAST</a></h3>
<p>The Skeleton Coast Park, which covers more than a million and a half hectares, is a strange landscape of fog-bound coast, gravel plains and mirages. Its singular, 
eerie atmosphere is compounded by shipwrecks and abandoned mines. This vast area extends from the Ugab River in the south to the Kunene on the Angolan 
border. Its relentlessly stark beauty is highlighted by unexpected waterholes where a surprising number and variety of hardy desert animals gather. The southern 
section of the park is more accessible to tourists than the northern area or wilderness section of the park. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="eto">ETOSHA PARK</a></h3>
<p>The Etosha National Park is one of the major sanctuaries for wildlife in Africa and was proclaimed a game reserve by German Governor von Lindequist in 1907. 
The heart of the park is the Etosha Pan, meaning &quot;place of dry water&quot;, an extensive, flat depression of about 5 000 sq km. This great, white expanse is a place of 
shimmering mirages, and seeing large herds of game in this setting makes Etosha a unique experience in Africa. Expert game management and the protection of the 
unspoilt environment, makes the Etosha National Park one of the greatest and most important game parks on the sub- continent. Due to the carefully controlled size 
of the restcamps, visitors experience the feeling of being truly in the wilds. There are 144 mammal species in the park, which covers an area of 22 270 km2. This 
includes elephant, giraffe, blue wildebeest and black rhino. Among the predators are lion, cheetah, leopard and several species of wild cat. Hyena and jackal are 
the scavengers. There are various species of antelope ranging from the majestic eland to the smallest antelope, the shy little Damara dik-dik. The most striking of 
the antelope species is the gemsbok, with its dramatic black and white markings, which also appears on the Namibian coat of arms. Birdlife is prolific and some 
340 species have been identified, including Namibia's national bird, the vividly coloured crimson- breasted shrike. A highlight of the park is the flood-lit waterhole at 
the Okaukuejo rest-camp where elephant and other game come down to drink at night. </p>

</td><td width=50%>Namibia is in many ways Africa's most surprising country, and certainly one with many contrasts, It is larger than Germany and yet has 
less than 2 million inhabitants. The Namib Desert, the result of the cold Benguela Current which sweeps northward from the Antarctica, 
occupies much of the country. Thousands of rock engravings are found around the Namib area of Brandberg, in the Etongo Mountains. 
However, two other phenomena match the Namib&#146;s eerie existence - the foreboding Skeleton Coast, with its numerous wrecked hulls, 
and Etosha National Park uniquely strange amongst Africa's game reserves. By contrast, Windhoek, is a busy cosmopolitan city, with 
more than a hint of Germany about it.	A Discover of the Northern portions of Namibia</td></tr>

<hr>
<p>A unique safari for the adventure and wilderness lover. This safari offers physical activities coupled with viewing Africa's wildlife in the finest of settings. Facilities in 
some of the areas are limited and on occasion non-existent. Zambia is a landlocked country comprising of 750000km2 and 8 million inhabitants. Although well 
within the tropics the climate is generally temperate due to the high altitude (average 1300 m above sea level). It was in 1855 that David Livingstone was shown the 
&quot;smoke that thunders&quot; by the Chief of Kololo, living in the area. This natural wonder of the world came to be known as Victoria Falls. Livingstone pursued his 
exploration into Zambia, bringing world attention to the Arab controlled slave trade, and eventually died on the shores of Lake Bangweulu. Kafue National Park 
was established in 1924 and covering 22 400km2 is one of the largest in Africa. Its ecological diversity has resulted in the widest range of mammal species of any 
park in Zambia. Predators abound with lion, cheetah and leopard. The park is considered an important refuge for the endangered hunting dog. Kafue is one of the 
best reserves for antelope in Africa. Roan, sable, Liechtenstein's hartebeest, eland, wildebeest, impala, puku, oribi, sitatunga and red lechwe all occur here. 
Yellow-backed duiker are said to inhabit Kafue too. The Kafue River supports an enormous hippo population where birding is excellent. Over 400 species of 
birds have been recorded in the park. The forgotten wilderness of 4 092km2 of the Lower Zambezi National Park lies on the north bank of the Zambezi, in 
Zambia, and opposite Mana Pools in Zimbabwe. We canoe for 3 days observing large herds of buffalo, waterbuck, impala, elephant and numerous predators such 
as lion, hyena and leopard. Birdlife is incredible, offering sights of hornbills, Meyer's parrots, Lilian's lovebirds, and in the summer, Narina Trogon.</p>

<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="fez">Fez</a></h3>
<p align=left>The mosque of Fez is big, and when you walk around the old city, you get a feeling that it's never ending. Every now and then, you discover a port to a mosque, 
just to realise that it's the same mosque over and over again. The most vital parts of the old city are making up a circle around the mosque, called Kairaouine. This 
is based upon old Muslim patterns where the jama',&lt;Picture&gt; the main mosque is the centre of town. And with these patterns, all the cleanest forms of commercial 
activity are situated in the nearest vicinity, while unclean activities are put as far away as possible. But in Fez you find the dyers, just some 50 metres away from the 
mosque. This was a surprise to me, as dyeing is counted among the least clean activities of all. The dyers' plant is a tourist attraction, much because it is colourful, 
and make great motives. The plant consists of hundreds of basins filled with all colours, and the mint sprig given to you at the entrance is to be held between the 
stench coming up from it, and your nose. But just like most other major Moroccan cities, Fez is a place to get lost (in the evening this can be literal). And the city do 
keep enough attractions to stroll around aimlessly for several days. What makes its architecture great, are the gates all over. They are big, well kept and of high 
quality handicraft.&lt;Picture&gt; Apart from that, the houses of Fez aren't that splendid, but inside the city, remember that it is the totality that makes Fez one of the 
most outstanding examples of medieval cities in the Arab world.</p>
<h3 align=left><a name="mar">Marrakech</a></h3>
<p align=left>Marrakech might be the most famous Moroccan city, and the air seems full of stories, true or not true, even in modern times. Marrakech is primarily the world 
famous square, Jema l-Fna, which vibrates from life all day through. On the one side of it the suq starts, which really lets you go back into something resembling the 
Middle Ages. It might not contain more than most suqs in Morocco, but it is so much larger. And its all in a colour somewhere between red and pink. At night Jema 
l-Fna turns into a grand fun fair, where stories are told, fire swallowed, poisonous snakes played with. And cameras and wallets stolen. So after having fought with 
aggressive hustlers inside the suq all day, you can easily end up losing all you brought out into the night. Remember that when night falls, crime gets easier. So, leave 
your things in the hotel. Marrakech' reputation as a pot of hustlers is not undeserved, but few things happen here that can't be handled. If you show respect, and 
keep your things close to your body, and become alert when you're in a crowd. Marrakech' old quarters has many poor people, that have little chance to find 
regular work. What is central to understanding Marrakech' position, is that it never has been Arabic, always Berber. While Arabs and Berbers mingle in most parts 
of Morocco, Marrakech remains a bastion of Berber culture. It was its own centre in the struggle against the French earlier this century, and could have become a 
capital in a country away from Morocco if history had wanted it differently. Anyway, it's the place that from where Europeans have derived 'Morocco'. </p>
<p align=left>Marrakech is situated close to the Atlas mountains, and on most days you can see blue mountains covered with snow over the rooftops. Marrakech has been a 
resort for many years, and comes with all the luxury those being able to pay for it, can afford. The attractions have not always been all moral. The setting of 
Marrakech is splendid, the city exceptionally beautiful, and the liveliness almost never ending. The city offers most activities, swimming in the hotel, and excursions 
to the mountains. But what is often forgotten in short presentations, just 40 years ago, as much as every three woman was a prostitute, either full time or once in a 
while. And child prostitution was offered in the middle of the street, in full daylight, outside popular restaurants, from the receptionist in the hotel, from poor 
mothers. A little bit is apparently left of this, but Marrakech is no worse than most other North African city. There are many sights of Marrakech. The centre square 
(upper photo), Jema l-Fna is already mentioned. The 850 year old Koutoubia minaret is just some hundred metres west from the Jema l-Fna, and the foremost 
landmark of the city. The beautiful, large mosque and madrasa of Ben Yussef inside the large suq, that begins at the northern side of Jema l-Fna, can be entered. 
For deeper understanding of Moroccan architecture, the Almoravid koubba, 20- 30 metres south of the mosque of Ben Yussef, offer several of the oldest 
examples of the artifacts of the Moroccan architectural style: decorative patterns, windows, and the structure of the dome itself. </p>
<h3 align=left><a name="cas">Casablanca</a></h3>
<p align=left>If the Hollywood image of 'Casablanca' is important to you, be careful about visiting Casablanca. No other city in Morocco is further away from the romantic 
Orientalism presented in the classical film of 1942. Actually the film has never been correct about the image presented of the city that gave the film its name. The 
Orient is found all over Morocco, Casablanca is a modern city, and beautiful in its own respect. The centre of Casablanca is fairly impressive. It's squeaky modern, 
with big, lively boulevards, high, white, well-kept buildings. And it's clean and efficient. People visiting Casablanca as their first city, could easily end up hating this 
place: There are few things here confirming the newcomers conception on the Orient. But for people having visited other parts of Morocco first, Casablanca is 
good! The city is modern in a Moroccan way, and an excellent example of Moroccans capacity of taking charge of the future of their country. But as soon as you 
step out of the impressive centre of town, dark clouds cover the realities of people here. Extreme poverty and prostitution only to be matched by Tangier is what 
you'll find without even looking for it. No other place in the country displays bigger differences between the haves and the have-nots. If anything in Casablanca 
should fit the Casablanca of Bergman and Bogart, it should be the old city. It's small, consisting mainly of smaller houses, which all seem to be from this century, 
and the alleyways dominating in other old cities, are rarely found here. There is a good market here, but look around before you buy, shop keepers here know their 
skills. Some thousand people live here, and in one or two spots, true beauty occurs.</p>
<h3 align=left><a name="rab">Rabat</a></h3>
<p align=left>Rabat is by some travellers rated among the best of Moroccan cities. But the majority of the city is just as Casablanca not very Moroccan. And it's far smaller. 
Town centre is French in style, and not very lively. If capitals are marked by people rushing, Rabat is nothing like a capital. When in Rabat there are certain things 
to do. You could get a change from Moroccan cuisine, as there are a handful of good international restaurants,- chinese, vietnamese, italian, and good eating is easy 
to find all over. You could rush through the old city, which will disappoint you, as it's only giving shelter for the people who can't find space in the modern parts of 
Rabat. The result is that Rabat's old city is marked by little else but poverty, and has no exotic market areas. The Muhammad V mausoleum is beautiful, tranquil, 
with intricate masonry, and a nice place to sit down for a minute or two. If you visit Rabat in summer time, as I did, you'll appreciate all small rests there are. 
Reaching the beaches of Rabat also proves rewarding, as they are full of easygoing Moroccans, treating you with all possible respect and curiosity. The old 
fortress, or ribat, is well-kapt, and has a small population. Its position looking over both the Atlantic, and the city of Rabat on one side and Sale on the other, is a 
startling addition to the village-like charm. Except from the monuments, and some museums, I got to admit that Rabat is not high on my list of preferred Moroccan 
cities. Nice, but far from exiting. </p>
<h3 align=left><a name="mek">Meknes</a></h3>
<p align=left>Meknes has been called the Versailles of Morocco, but the grand scheme for a royal palace was never completed. Today the city is the centre of a productive 
area, producing olives, wine, cereal crops and citrus. The old city is not among the finest in Morocco, but the royal palace is filling a considerable part of it. The 
palace was the made under Sultan Moulay Ismail, reigning for 55 years around 1700. He was a true tyrant, and one believes that he had some 30,000 people 
killed, but the figures are far higher if you count the ones killed in his battles he conducted. His motto was: &quot;My subjects are like rats in a basket, and if I don't shake 
the basket, they will gnaw their way out.&quot; Despite Ismail's great interest in building, he never succeeded in making Meknes the great imperial city he planned it to 
be. Meknes has for always been stamped by its feeling of emptiness. Not even the newer French city, situated on the other side of the gorge that divides the city in 
two halves, managed to change this.</p>
<h3 align=left><a name="tan">Tangier</a></h3>
<p align=left>Tangier is the main port of the ferries coming from Europe, and almost no other place in Morocco holds more discos than Tangier. But they are totally different 
from the European ones. You should enter these for the sake of the music, but stay away if you're going for company. Inside you find small orchestras playing 
classical Arabic music, and if you like this kind of music, it's some of the performers here are first class. The music they play is rarely heard outside North Africa. It 
sounds like a mixture of symphonic music and Indian string music, and is based on melody lines that are built up in a process resembling what Westerners call 
jamming, until a crescendo is reached. The result is that the piece of music you heard will never return, unless somebody recorded it. The next time the same 
melody line is used, the result can be very different. The women you meet at the discos, are prostitutes. All of them, it seems. And they don't only stick to discos 
and night clubs, you get approached by them even in normal restaurants, restaurants of good reputation. What surprises you, is their bluntness, and the acceptance 
of ordinary Moroccans around. This is all part of a long tradition, where foreign travellers have come to Tangier to stay, with the promiscuity in mind. Even today 
there are a lot of very young prostitutes, as well as a lot of homosexual prostitution. But still Tangier is a very nice city, close to the sea, a long beach, an exotic old 
city. But sadly, the hustlers here are so professional that they're organised (actually true!). The moment you come out of the quay area, they run for you. One wants 
to show the city, -&quot;for free&quot;. Another knows about a very good hotel, and he can get you in at a special price. And unlike hustlers in any other place in Morocco, 
there is nothing you can do to get rid of them. But do remember, many of them are good people, as long as you don't trust them too much. So choose one of them, 
bargain a price (1$/hour is maximum), and enjoy. If an experience like this doesn't frighten you, Morocco will be yours. Otherwise, you should choose another port 
for entering Morocco, and enter with air plane.</p>
<h3 align=left><a name="tet">Tetuan</a></h3>
<p align=left>Tetuan holds a reputation of being the worst city in Morocco, with tricksters to be found everywhere, in the shape of hustlers and aggressive guides. This is also a 
place where mugging and physical crime is so much a possibility that you should consider staying away. And if you have your first meeting with the Arabic countries 
in this spot, your impression of travelling in this part of the World could be wrecked forever. If you have the basic knowledge on how to deal with the troublesome 
minority of Moroccan men, you could make a try in Tetuan. The city is beautifully situated in a hillside with a view over the Mediterranean, that is separated from by 
the city with some kilometres wide farmland. It's one of the whitest cities of Morocco, and both the old city and the modern one are nicely arranged, with a nice mix 
of Moroccan and Spanish architecture. But then again, the people destroy what this city could have been.</p>

<h2><a name="cai">CAIRO</a></h2>
<p>Founded on the site of Babylon, near the ruins of ancient Memphis, Cairo has been the largest city in Africa for centuries. Modern Cairo encompasses many former 
cities and their monuments: the first pharaonic capital and the three main pyramids, early Christian history, and a fine medieval legacy that fittingly reflects the city's 
importance from the 8th to the 14th centuries. Five thousand years of culture are all concentrated here, at the crossroads of three continents. Here lies the great 
sphinx, the oldest and greatest surviving sculpture from ancient times, and of course the huge Pyramids of Giza, amongst man's oldest stone edifices. </p>
<p><a name="giza"><strong>GIZA PYRAMIDS</strong></a></p>
<p>Built around 2500 B.C., these awesome legacies to mankind's search for immortality represent the zenith of the pyramid building age in Egypt. Each aligned with 
the point of a compass when built and with the corners of their central chambers similarly accurate to a fraction of a degree (long before the compass was invented) 
these monuments offer a unique experience for the visitor of a guided tour inside the largest of them. Measuring one hundred and sixty meters in height, and 
spanning an area of nearly fifteen acres, the largest of the pyramids is composed of an estimated 2.3 million limestone blocks, most weighing 2.5 tons, but some as 
much as 15 tons and is easily the largest stone edifice in the world. </p>
<p><a name="saq"><strong>SAQQARA - MEMPHIS</strong></a></p>
<p>Situated about 10 miles south of the main pyramids at Giza lies the step pyramid of Saqqara. Started around 2630 BC this is one of the richest archeological sites in 
the world. The pyramid itself rises 200 feet from the sand and was engineered by Imhotep, one of the most celebrated of pharaonic engineers. It is surrounded by 
Zoser's funerary complex part of the original wall and temples of which still stand, as well as other more minor pyramids. A few kilometers to the south east of 
Saqqara lies Memphis. Originally established by the first Pharaoh of the first Dynasty, around 3000 years BC, it became Egypt's ancient capital for well over five 
hundred years and remained powerful throughout the three millennia that spanned the age of the Pharaohs. A mixture of time, the Nile's erosion and neglect has 
eroded much of the splendor of this once great city, however an eighty ton alabaster sphinx remains among a few statues and relics to remind of the glorious days of 
the first great capital of ancient Egypt.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="lu"><strong>LUXOR</strong></a></p>
<p>Luxor is unique among the cities of the world. It is the world's greatest open air museum filled with monuments of the grandeur of the Ancient Egyptians. The &quot;city 
of palaces&quot; lies on the East bank of the Nile, but there are monuments of astounding merit on both sides of the great river. It remained the seat of power from 2100 
BC to 750 BC , and its archeological legacy suitably reflects its place as the center of gravity of ancient Egypt for over a millennium during the finest period of its 
pharaonic civilization - The New Kingdom. After the turmoil, decline and foreign invasion that lasted over 200 years after the end of the Middle Kingdom in 1800 
BC, Egypt was once again united by Ahmose I of the 18th Dynasty, who drove out the foreign invaders and inaugurated the start of a vigorous and expansionist 
golden era of Pharaonic civilization known as The New Kingdom in 1570 BC. This dynamic and confident period in Egyptian history was reflected in the arts. The 
capital of the empire that was to be, moved squarely to Thebes now, here on the west bank of the Nile at Luxor. This era saw challenges to the traditional social 
and religious structure of Egypt. Long gone were the days of the invulnerable God-Kings who built the great pyramids of Giza a millennium earlier, now, as the 
society became more sophisticated, a powerful priesthood developed, as well as an army, a civil service and a hierarchy of nobility. Though still hugely powerful as 
the symbolic and actual head of this vast national infrastructure, a more human representation of the monarchy was depicted in relief and on papyrus dating from the 
period. In one instance the Pharaonic Queen Hatchepsut is even ridiculed with graffiti carved by workers building her temple at Deir el Bahari. It was in this 
perhaps inevitable environment that was the result of the increasing sophistication of the Egyptian state that some of the most magnificent monuments of ancient 
Egypt were built, and the boundaries of the country stretched far and wide in the known world as foreign enemies were defeated and their lands garrisoned by the 
soldier-Pharaohs that characterized this era.</p>
<p><a name="lux"><strong>LUXOR TEMPLE /KARNAK </strong></a></p>
<p>Built by the two pharaohs Amenhotep III and Ramses II, the temple was dedicated to the god Amun-Ra, whose marriage to the goddess Mut was celebrated in 
ancient times annually by a grand procession which moved by boat along the Nile and by land along an avenue of sphinxes from Karnak Temple 2000 meters to 
the North, down to Luxor temple itself. At the entrance to the temple lie two huge seated statues of King Ramses II, fronted by what was originally two large 
obelisks made of pink granite. Only one of the obelisks remains now, whilst the other stands on the Place de la Concorde, in Paris. After the seated statues and the 
obelisk lies the first courtyard also built by Ramses II. Over two hundred and eighty meters in length, the bulk of the rest of the temple was built during a period of 
great prosperity by Amenhotep III. Amenhotep was a peaceful and enlightened pharaoh, and the structure and hieroglyphic relief on his section of the temple in 
particular illustrate the deep spiritual significance it held for the King. - About two miles to the North of Luxor temple lies what is probably the most majestic and 
engaging place of worship in history - Karnak. Built and enlarged by successive pharaohs, it now spans almost 250 acres in a complex of temples, colossi, chapels 
and sphinxes, reflecting the fifteen hundred year legacy of a nation at the height of its power.</p>
<p><a name="val"><strong>VALLEY OF KINGS</strong></a></p>
<p>Across the Nile on the West bank, lies the rest of the remains of the ancient city of Thebes. Here the visitor will discover the Valley of the Kings, the final and 
eternal resting place for the pharaoh's of the New Kingdom, amongst which the most famous tomb is that of Tutankhamun. This boy King was chosen by 
Amenhotep IV, husband of the beautiful Nefertiri, to marry one of his daughters. Upon the death of his father in law, Tutankhamun acceded to the throne but died 
in the eleventh year of his reign at the age of just eighteen, making him a minor King by the standards of the pharaohs. His fame today lies in the fact that his small 
tomb remained intact until discovered in the twentieth century by Howard Carter, the British explorer.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="edfu"><strong>EDFU </strong></a></p>
<p>Bisecting the 200km or so between Luxor and Aswan lies Edfu temple. Even from a distance the grand size of the monument (about 150 meters long with 36 
meters colonnades) can clearly be seen rising from the left bank of the Nile. No temple in Egypt is better preserved than this. Dedicated to Horus, the 
falcon-headed god, work started under the reign of Ptolemy III in 237 B.C. by the celebrated Egyptian priest and architect Imhotep on the foundations of an earlier 
sanctuary. Well preserved relief and wall inscriptions including a complete liturgical calendar and the story of the birth and events from the life of Horus have added 
much to Egyptologists' knowledge of the ancients. The temple, which rivals those at Luxor in grandeur, also contains a Nilometre, a Court of Offerings and a huge 
pylon at its entrance.</p>
<p><a name="kom"><strong>KOM OMBO</strong></a></p>
<p>About 30 miles north of Aswan situated in an elevated, somewhat dramatic setting on high ground beside the Nile is the Ptolemaic temple of Kom Ombo. Dating 
back to the 2nd century B.C. this Greek/Roman temple is all that remains of the ancient city of Nubit. Kom Ombo's dual dedication to the worship of Sobek, the 
crocodile god, and Haroeris, the hawk headed god, is reflected in an intriguing double design with twin entrances, halls and sanctuaries. Sculpted wall relief show 
ancient surgical instruments including suction cups, dental tools, lances, bone saws, retractors, scales and scalpels, indicating the advanced nature of medical care in 
early times.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="aswan"><strong>ASWAN</strong></a></p>
<p>Graced with one of the most beautiful settings on the Nile, Aswan enjoys a slow, relaxed way of life. Days can be spent strolling up and down the broad Corniche 
watching the sailboats etch the sky with their tall masts or sitting in floating restaurants listening to Nubian music and eating freshly caught fish, in this, Egypt's 
southern most city and gateway to sub-saharan Africa. The High Dam was an engineering achievement of the highest proportion when completed by Soviet and 
Egyptian engineers in the 1960's and today provides Egypt with the bulk of its electricity as well as controlling the annual flooding of the Nile with which the 
country's farming population had previously to contend since time immemorial. It is two miles long and offers spectacular views from its top as well as quite a site in 
itself when the flood gates are opened. After the construction of the Aswan High Dam, the Island of Philae's treasures were likely to be submerged throughout the 
year by the artificial lake created behind the Dam, hence the temples were dismantled stone by stone and reassembled on the nearby island of Agilkia, a few miles 
south of Aswan in a serene and tranquil setting. The temples date from the fourth century BC or the XXX Th. dynasty to the 2nd century AD. The temple of 
outstanding interest is the temple of Isis, with its forecourt, first pylon and huge carved figure of Ptolemy II. The temples all celebrate the deities involved in the Isis 
and Osiris myth with which the ancients explained the origins of the world. Again the best time to see the buildings is in the evening twilight where a visit may be 
combined with the sound and light show. Much of the red granite used for ancient temples and colossi came from quarries in the Aswan area. The Unfinished 
Obelisk still lies where sculpting work continued until a crack was discovered in the stone as it was being hewn from the rock. Possibly intended as a companion to 
the Lateran Obelisk originally in Karnak, now in Rome, it would have measured 120 feet and weighed over a million kilograms and offers a unique insight into the 
process of preparing stone for the grand monuments of Egypt. The site has recently been renovated and equipped with tourist facilities. Nearby is the Fatimid 
Cemetery, hundreds of mud brick tombs dating back to the 8th century AD, including that of Sayyida Zeinab, granddaughter of the prophet Mohammed.</p>
<p><a name="abu"><strong>ABU SIMBEL</strong></a></p>
<p>Built by perhaps the greatest pharaoh of them all, Ramses II, this temple is a masterpiece of pharaonic engineering. Warlike and ambitious, Ramses II reigned for 
67 years reaching perhaps a hundred and bequeathing one of the most prolific architectural legacies of any pharaoh to the modern age. This temple, situated on the 
very southern frontier of Egypt's ancient border was designed partly to remind his enemies to the South, that on entering Egypt, they would be entering his land and 
that he, Ramses II, the greatest pharaoh of them all, would receive any hostile intent with the same uncompromising manner implied by this imposing shrine. Built 
facing the sunset to the west, the rays of the sun still penetrate deep into the temple to gradually rise and fill the inner chamber, or Holy of Holiest on the same two 
days each year - October 20th and February 20th. The design of Abu Simbel is unique - rock hewn grotto temples being quite unusual in Egypt. The image of the 
main temple facade is projected powerfully and majestically by the four huge colossi, 70 feet tall, representing the pharaoh-god himself and symbolizing the 
masculine prowess and military power of the divine king who had led a successful sixteen year long war against the Asian Hittites. But Abu Symbol also shows the 
tender side to Ramses since, side by side with his own temple, he built another equally impressive, dedicated to his wife Nefertari, said to be one of the most 
beautiful women in Egypt and with whom Ramses is known to have been deeply in love.</p>

<h3><a name="red"><strong>THE RED SEA</strong></a></h3>
<p>The Red Sea was until just a few years ago virtually undiscovered by all but a few locals and fishermen. No more however. In the last ten years billions of dollars 
have been spent by both foreign and Egyptian companies and organizations in developing the region as a tourist resort. The main attraction lies beneath the surface 
of the water. Half a million years of isolation, warm nutrient rich waters, and the total absence of pollution has created an underwater ecosystem unparalleled in the 
density and variety of its marine life. Coral grows at a rate of about .3 to 6 or 7 centimeters per annum. Now multiply that by a few hundred thousand years or so 
and one begins to get a picture of the abundance of coral reefs here. The two main resorts are Hurghada, particularly attractive due to its proximity to the 
magnificent attractions of Luxor, and Sharm El Sheikh, situated at the southern tip of the Sinai peninsular.</p>
<p><a name="Hurg"><strong>HURGHADA</strong></a></p>
<p>Less than three hours by car from the wonders of Luxor lies the tranquil seaside resort of Hurghada. Though only a small fishing village until a few years ago, the 
area has grown rapidly as European and other holiday makers have discovered the beauty of its location and that of the marine life to be found here. Arguably the 
richest and most concentrated varieties of aquatic life in the world center around numerous coral reefs peppering the shallow sea, many of which species are unique 
to the Red Sea. The sea is absolutely beautiful radiating a distinctive green almost transparent hue turning to gradually darker shades of blue as it becomes deeper. 
Marine photographers report outstanding light conditions with visibility up to 50 meters. Scuba diving is the main sport here not surprisingly and the area has 
become a mecca for dedicated enthusiasts </p>
<p><a name="sharm"><strong>SHARM EL SHEIKH</strong></a></p>
<p>Approximately five hours by boat from Hurghada lies its sister resort of Sharm El Sheikh. Perched on the Southern tip of the Sinai peninsular, the gateway to Asia, 
Sharm and its more lively resort of Naama a few kilometers to the North is equally popular with divers as its mainland alternative discussed above. Frequent boat 
trips take divers offshore to one of the most impressive marine parks in the world - Ras Mohammed. Sharks, Rays and a multitude of other species can be seen 
here and from amongst other places, the underwater shark observatory. The density of marine life here is unparalleled anywhere in the world. Frequent trips into the 
Sinai mountains are arranged using four wheel drive vehicles or simply camel power. </p>
<p><a name="cater"><strong>ST. CATHERINE'S MONASTERY</strong></a></p>
<p>The favorite destination inland is St. Catherine's Monastery at the foot of the biblical Mt. Sinai. It was originally founded by Greek Orthodox monks in AD330 on 
what was believed to be the site of the apparition of the Burning Bush, where God is said to have given Moses the Ten Commandments. The Monastery boasts a 
rich history and its library contains thousands of priceless manuscripts and a large collection of ancient icons. In AD 527 the Roman Emperor Justinian ordered the 
building of a fortified monastery around it due to frequent raids by Ishmaelites and Nubians. The monks were protected when Egypt adopted Islam thanks to a 
letter signed with the prophet Mohamad's own handprint. A copy of the letter hangs near the entrance gate, the original was removed along with the prophet's 
banner and sword in 1515 and is now displayed in Istanbul's Topkapi Palace. Among the ancient icons of note is a 6th century mosaic depicting Jesus, Moses and 
Elijah, surrounded by disciples. A 4th century Greek translation of the Bible given by the Emperor Justinian to the Monastery was stolen and after a circuitous route 
around Europe taking in Germany and Russia is now to be found at the British Museum. Many religious texts remain however amongst the ten thousand or so 
documents including some of the oldest translations of the bible. During repairs in 1975, over a thousand manuscripts were found dating from the fourth century to 
the eighteenth, including the oldest known translation of the gospels in existence dating back to the 5th century. </p>
<p><a name="sinai"><strong>MT. SINAI</strong></a></p>
<p>A visit to the two thousand meter plus summit of Mt. Sinai is a must and an evening out under the stars can be a pleasurable experience. From the monastery it 
takes about three hours to reach the top where a church has been built in praise of God's gift of the Ten Commandments to Moses; penitent monks have carved a 
three thousand step stairway to the summit which makes the journey only fractionally easier! Try to make it to the top by sundown for a breathtaking natural scene. 
The Red Sea actually takes its name from the mountains around it which assume a crimson tint at this time of the evening. </p>

<p><a name="atm"><font color="#804000"><font size=5><b>ATMOSPHERE</b></font></font></a></p>
<p><font size=3>There's always something very special about the people you meet and the friends you make on holiday - it's even more so on Safari. With us, the groups are 
invariably small, usually cosmopolitan and always include people from all walks of life with an extensive range of interests. When you sit around the flickering camp 
fire, with the hypnotic sounds of nature around you, conversation flows fast and intensely and a bond between people is formed. It's something to do with shared 
experience that creates a magic you won't find on any other type of holiday. Let us show you the REAL Africa - the REAL way</font><font size=2> </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a name="veh"><font color="#804000"><font size=5><b>VEHICLES</b></font><b> </b></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#804000"><b>Q: I am concerned about joining a group of people I do not know?</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#804000"><b>A: </b></font>One of the overwhelming responses we get from clients after a safari is: I never dream that half the fun and interest would come from my fellow passengers, That 
says it all. The groups have limited numbers and are therefore informal. You'll meet and make friends with an interesting array of people, often different nationalities, 
and you'll feel at home with them right from day 1. </p>

camps with all facilities: hot and cold running water, showers, toilets etc... The participants are very quick to adapt themselves to the conditions of the safari.</p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#804000"><b>Q: I am concerned about having to follow a rigid itinerary, would it be better to travel on my own?</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#804000"><b>A: </b></font>We travel in small groups to allow for more flexibility and participation. Our itineraries remain flexible and should we wish to spend more time in one place, we 
can do so without having to rush to the next camp. You will be able to sit back and relax while we do all the tedious organizing required for the smooth running of 
the safari. </p>

<h3><a name="afr_con">AFRICAN CONDITIONS</a></h3>
<p>Please note that the itinerary is flexible &amp; will depend on local conditions: traveling in Africa is sometimes unpredictable. <font size=4><strong>The South Africa to Kenya 
Safari is a rugged safari.</strong></font> Facilities in the remote areas we shall be visiting are somewhat primitive and at times non-existent. By the very nature of traveling 
in remote areas there are unforeseen challenges to overcome and passengers must have a taste for adventure and must be willing to put up with the occasional but 
inevitable hardship. Unforeseen circumstances due to problems with road conditions, weather, mechanical breakdown or accidents can delay and change the 
performance of the expedition. Please come prepared! </p>
<ul>
<li><b>LOCAL LAWS &amp; CUSTOMS</b> - We are guests in each country we, visit and it is only good manners that we comply with their customs. All participants 
are required to obey the laws &amp; regulations of the countries visited and any passengers contravening such laws may be required to leave the tour immediately 
with no right to refund of the tour fare. </li>
<li><b>CONSERVATION </b>- Most countries are members of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) which 
restricts the import/ export of numerous species and their products. Please do not purchase products made from ivory and skins. These may be confiscated 
by customs. In the interest of Wildlife Conservation and Ecotourism we ask you to refrain from the purchases of any animal skins, ivory or any Wildlife 
products. </li>
<li><b>PHOTOGRAPHY</b> - For photography of birds and animals a 300mm telephoto lens is recommended. Films &amp; batteries are only available in larger cities 
and tend to be expensive. We recommend that you take along sufficient films and a spare battery for your camera. Participants must not take photographs of 
border posts or military/ police posts as this can lead to an unpleasant situation and even arrest. Please refer to our <a href="afr_pho.html"><font size=4>Photography Guide of Africa</font></a></li>

<hr>
<p>To discover her treasures of art, to savor her heritage, and to understand how history has molded her people. Italy is a country where besides the places usually 
visited by the tourist there is much to delight. With these itineraries you are accompanied by Terence Mullaly, the art historian who has organized exhibitions in Italy 
such as Ruskin in &quot;Verona&quot; and &quot;Veronese Drawings of the 16th Century&quot;, and who is art critic of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. With him you will see what you might 
otherwise miss, will come to love Italy, and to appreciate more deeply the land and her people. To survey Italian art or, better still, to travel through Italy aware of 
architecture, painting, sculpture, and the other arts is to do more than pass in review many of man&#146;s greatest achievements. It is to understand the Italians and, 
beyond that, to grasp the nature of the European heritage.</p>
<h3><a name="early">EARLY ITALIAN ART</a></h3>
<p>The story of art in Italy goes back to prehistory. Recent archaeological excavations have revealed Bronze Age settlements upon the hills of Rome, and traces are 
found of the early manifestations of art in Italy, such as the rock carvings, some of the most interesting from prehistory, in the Val Camonica in Northern Italy not far 
from Brescia. Great architecture came to Italy with the Greek settlements in Sicily and Southern Italy. In the 5th century B.C. above all there are, in Sicily, 
Agrigento, the ancient Akragas, Syracuse, Selinunte, and Segesta, and in southern Italy, Paestum. Nowhere in Greece herself is there a Doric temple so well 
preserved as the temple of Concord at Agrigento. It rises massive, austere and perfect in its proportions. To look out from the modern town of Agrigento and see a 
line of temples silhouetted against the blue sea is to roll back the centuries to the time when men began to forge the European consciousness. The same is true of 
Paestum, in flat country south of Naples. The three huge Doric temples seem like witnesses half forgotten.</p>
<h3><a name="etrus">ETRUSCAN &amp; ROMAN PERIOD</a></h3>
<p>With the Etruscans there is the first great civilization which had its origin on Italian soil. From the 8th to the 1st century BC they were to dominate much of central 
Italy. Our knowledge of these strange people is based primarily upon the paintings in their tombs and upon a large number of small Etruscan objects, above all in 
terracotta and bronze. The Etruscan tombs near Tarquinia, not far from Viterbo, and at Cerveteri, in the Province of Rome, are among the most memorable of all 
works of art in Italy. In the Tomb of the Leopards at Tarquinia dancing figures in vivid colour painted upon the walls express a joy of life which is immediately 
infectious. The intervening centuries are annihilated. If this is true on a tiny scale in many Etruscan tombs, it is equally so in the heart of Rome. All around are the 
remains of public buildings and temples in which the grand and the measured find expression. That Roman law has been the basis of almost every civilized legal 
code suddenly becomes explicable when we marvel at the union of sheer physical size with the balance and proportion of the buildings about the Forum and of 
other classical buildings, such as the Colosseum and the Pantheon, scattered through the city. At the same time there are reminders of how intensely human the 
Romans were, above all the huge Baths of Caracalla, and the remains of Pompeii and Herculaneum, the two towns near the modern Naples smothered by the 
eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD. Walking the streets of Pompeii passing into houses in which wall paintings, in their subject matter wonderfully human, indeed 
sometimes lewd, have been preserved, we feel ourselves citizens of these places.</p>
<h3><a name="byza">BYZANTINE ART</a></h3>
<p>When Constantine moved the capital of the Roman Empire to Constantinople in 330 Italy entered a period of uncertainty and tumult. In Rome herself the basilican 
plan was adapted to church architecture, as in S. Maria Maggiore, S. Clemente, S. Paolo fuori le Mura and S. Sabina. The Roman arts of mosaic and mural 
decoration were also taken up by the early Christians. In Rome mosaics of great splendor dating from the 4th century are in S. Maria Maggiore and other 
churches.A different development took place in Ravenna. There Orthodox Christianity established one of its greatest centers, and we find some of the best 
surviving examples of Byzantine art.</p>
<h3><a name="roman">ROMANESQUE ART</a></h3>
<p>Romanesque art, which in Italy marks the growth of cities, of civic pride, and of monastic orders, extends from the 8th to the 12th century. The basilican plan 
remains common in church architecture, but on facades galleries, as at Pisa, Ferrara, and Parma, are common, and this is true both of Cathedral facades, and of 
baptisteries, and of bell towers such as the famous leaning tower of Pisa. At the same time in Bologna the Torre Asinelli, which because it is so thin appears even 
taller than its 225 ft., and close to it, the Torre Garisenda, are reminders of the fortified towers into which in these times warring families retreated, while in Tuscany 
the little hill town of San Gimignano, with its thirteen towers and largely unspoiled Medieval appearance, is unforgettable. In the south Romanesque architecture also 
manifests itself, in such buildings as S. Nicola in Bari, while in Sicily it takes on a very special development. There under the Norman kingdom, in the 12th century, 
thanks to a remarkable degree of tolerance there flourished a curious mixture of Norman architecture, Islamic influence, and the work of Byzantine craftsmen. 
Standing 2 before the cathedrals of Monreale, close to Palermo, and Cefalu, on the north coast, the eye takes in the massive solidity of Norman architecture, while 
on entering these buildings the senses are dazzled by the splendor of the mosaics installed by craftsmen from Byzantium.</p>
<h3><a name="gothic">GOTHIC ART</a></h3>
<p>With the Gothic phase, extending in Italy from the 12th century and lingering into the 15th century, art in the peninsula takes on an entirely new complexion. Nothing 
could be further removed from the massive simplicity of Modena cathedral than the pinnacles and profusion of detail of Milan cathedral. The Gothic is also manifest 
in civic architecture. The great tower of the Palazzo del Comune in Verona, rising high above the city, a symbol of civic awareness, expresses the spirit of the 
Gothic, as also does the Doge&#146;s Palace in Venice, the facades of which date from 1309-1424. Seeming to float upon the water it is at once exotic and a symbol of 
the pride of Venice. If the Doge&#146;s Palace sums up Venetian Gothic, Giotto&#146;s Campanile in Florence, rising triumphant, beside the cathedral, epitomizes the Gothic 
in Florence. While Italian architecture was passing through the Romanesque and Gothic phases much was happening in the other arts. Finest of all Romanesque 
sculptors is Benedetto Antelami who in the last quarter of the 12th century executed reliefs in Parma cathedral and baptistery, Gothic sculpture also has a rich 
flowering. Above all Nicola and Giovanni Pisano active in the second half of the 13th century, and Andrea and Nino Pisano in the first half of the 14th century 
produced lovely work. It is in the second half of the 13th century and the early years of the 14th century that the story of Italian painting begins. Before that time the 
Byzantine tradition with its lack of modeling and hieratical presentation had been dominant. Three artists, Cimabue, who was a Florentine and lived circa 
1240-1302, Duccio active from 1279 until his death in 1319, who was the founder of the School of Siena, and Giotto (1266-1336), a Florentine, one of the 
greatest artists of all time, and the prime precursor of the Renaissance, tower above all others. The revolution begun by Cimabue and Duccio is completed by 
Giotto in his frescoes in the Upper Church of S. Francesco in Assisi, and in the Arena Chapel in Padua. Today standing before these great fresco cycles, and the 
other works of Giotto, such as his frescoes in the church of S. Croce in Florence, so lifelike are the figures, so subtle is his rendering of modeling, of what Bernard 
Berenson called &quot;tactile values&quot; so complete his mastery of movement, and so profound his grasp of psychological nuances that it is difficult to remember how far 
reaching was the revolution wrought by Giotto- Suddenly art enters our own world.</p>
<h3><a name="renai">RENAISSANCE</a></h3>
<p>With the Renaissance we quite suddenly feel at home. However much philosophy, politics, and social change have since that time altered the face of the world, we 
still see it as did Renaissance man. This is largely the gift of Florence. Many threads, economic, social, and political came together. Above all the Florentine 
temperament, at once inquiring and caustic, capable of grand endeavor, but deeply dedicated to reality must be recognized. Two figures from the first half of the 
15th century, Donatello (1386-1466) and Masaccio, who was born in 1401 and lived only to be 27, are preeminent. After Giotto Masaccio represents one of the 
three turning points in the art of Florence. He gave to the human figure a new sense of weight and reality. In his frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel of the Carmine, in 
Florence, we are not only in a world in every respect recognizable, but one in which psychological nuances are conveyed. With Donatello the qualities found in the 
painting of Masaccio are echoed in sculpture. His figures both herald the new naturalism, and are deeply expressive. In particular the equestrian statue of 
Gattemelata, in Padua, is the consummate image of man as a triumphant being, while his &quot;Annunciation&quot; in Santa Croce, in Florence, combines naturalism with one 
of the most poignant renderings of the subject. In opening up the new world of the Renaissance quasi-scientific interests are preeminent. Uccello (1397-1475) with 
his preoccupation with perspective is a key example of this, as are the brothers Antonio and Piero Pollaiuolo with their mastery of anatomy. Then there was the 
dedicated religious expression of Fra Angelico (1347-1455), so movingly conveyed in the Convent of S. Marco in Florence, and Domenico Ghirlandaio 
(1449-1494), who in his frescoes in the choir of S. Maria Novella, in Florence in our age of cynicism is equally appealing as is the vein of piety running through the 
work of so many Florentine artists such as Fra Filippo Lippi (1406-1469), Lorenzo di Credi (1456-1537), Filippino Lippi (1457-1504), and Piero di Cosimo 
(1462-1521). Standing apart from all his contemporaries is Botticelli (1444-1510). He, as can be seen clearly in his most celebrated works, &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; 
and &quot;Primavera&quot;, in the Uffizi in Florence, had a magical, wayward sense of line. </p>
<p>In architecture the supreme figure is Brunelleschi (1377-1446), who was also a sculptor. His dome of Florence cathedral is one of the consummate work of 
engineering of all time, just as his Pazzi Chapel at S. Croce, in Florence, is among the ideal expressions of the Renaissance. Not only is it a perfectly calculated 
geometrical shape, but every detail is subtly adjusted. Standing in this building we experience the sense of harmony at the heart of the Renaissance. Bramante 
(1444-1514) carried on the heritage of Brunelleschi, with buildings in Rome and Milan. Sculpture in Florence throughout the 15th century followed the path 
established by Donatello. Nor was he alone in his example. A contemporary, Ghiberti (1378-1455), moved from being an exponent of International Gothic to, in 
his second set of doors for the baptistery of Florence cathedral, which Michelangelo declared were &quot;worthy to be the gates of Paradise: the creation of a wonderful 
illusion of reality&quot;. In a lighter vein, the many members of the Della Robbia family perfected the technique of sculpture in glazed terracotta. On a level of high 
seriousness Verrocchio (died 1488) was both sculptor and painter, and his Colleoni Monument in Venice vies with Donatello&#146;s Gattamelata as the greatest of all 
equestrian statues. Outside Florence, and not only in Venice, there was a rich flowering of the Renaissance. Piero della Francesca (died 1492) painted figures of 
monumental seriousness. In Umbria Perugino (1445-1523) produced art of great beauty characterized by his mastery over what Bernard Berenson described as 
aerial perspective: that is the ability to convey a sense of space and depth in the painting of the sky. Luca Signorelli&#146;s (died 1523) concerns were different, and in his 
frescoes in Orvieto cathedral he combines an interest in anatomy with the vigorous representation of movement Other regional schools, were also important. In 
Ferrara, Tura (died 1495) and others used spiky sharp forms, and he filled his pictures with sea shells, but it was Mantegna (circa 1430-1506), in Mantua working 
for the Gonzaga, who achieved real greatness. He painted figures which look as if they were hewn out of rock.</p>
<p>It was, however, in Florence with Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) that the Renaissance found its noblest expression. Starting as a pupil of Verrocchio he became 
the archetypal man of the Renaissance. He was painter, sculptor, architect, and engineer, and, at the same time, mentor, and an indefatigable observer of natural 
phenomena. He left few finished works but a mass of drawings among the most beautiful in all art. What remains of major commissions, above all his fresco of &#146;The 
Last Supper, in S. Maria delle Grazie in Milan stands as the perfect example of the nobility of the Renaissance concept. In Milan Leonardo left many followers who 
imitated the superficial aspects of his style, but never achieved greatness. In Florence it was left to Andrea del Sarto (1486-1531) and Fra Bartolomeo 
(1475-1517) to give, with bulky figures, a last expression to the Renaissance. Two other artists, Raphael (1483-1520) and Correggio (1494-1534), had a 
profound influence upon the future. Raphael in his short life achieved much. He produced lovely Madonnas which, above all with the French, have remained as a 
standard of beauty. Most influential for the art of the 16th century were his frescoes in Rome in the Vatican, executed with the help of vastly talented assistants. 
Correggio was different. Working in isolation in Parma he painted pictures of gentle piety with a highly personal range of soft color which in the first phase of the 
Baroque was to be taken up by many artists. </p>
<h3><a name="venet">THE VENETIAN SCHOOLS</a></h3>
<p>The history of painting in Venice follows a completely different development from that of Florence. At the time when Giotto was revolutionizing art in Tuscany, 
Venice &#146;s links with the East ensured that her art was still tied to that of Byzantium. Venetian painting comes into its own with the members of two families, the 
Vivarini and the Bellini Bartolomeo Vivarini (certainly active from 1450 to 1491) and Gentile Bellini (died 1507) both delight the senses, the former with his pious 
Madonnas. but he is still not fully imbued with the Renaissance spirit and continues to use gold backgrounds, and the latter with his scenes of the pageantry of 
Venetian life. There is, too, Carpaccio (active 1490, died 1523/6), one of the most immediately delightful of artists. He commands a sense of the courtly and the 
ability to charm us with his power to tell a story. It is with Giovanni Bellini that Venetian art has its first truly great figure. He was active from circa 1459 and died in 
1516. Early on he was influenced by the stern principles of Mantegna, but he soon evolved to a gracious style in which he produced a vast number of altarpieces to 
be seen in Venetian churches and many Collections. One of the most important is his altarpiece commanding yet human but what is so beautiful is the color. The 
painters of the Venetian School were above all great colorists, and the color of the S. Zaccaria altarpiece is at once varied and clear. What also stamps Giovanni 
Bellini as one of the most extraordinary of all artists is his evolution. Towards the end of his life he produced for Duke Alfonso I d&#146;Este of Ferrara &quot;The Feast of the 
Gods&quot; now in Washington. Along with it were three companion paintings by Titian, and with them the two artists, the one aged, the other youthful, introduced into 
art a novel poetic sensibility. Venetian painting of Bellini&#146;s later years is full of delightful altarpieces produced by his many assistants and pupils, but it is with two 
artists of a younger generation, Giorgione and Titian, who emerge from Bellini&#146;s orbit, that the future lies. Giorgione was tragically short-lived and by 1510 was 
dead, while Titian lived to a prodigious old age; he was active before 1511 and did not die until 1576, and along with Veronese and Tintoretto dominates Venetian 
16th century painting.</p>
<p>The new sensibility forged by the aged Bellini, and the youthful Titian and Giorgione finds fullest expression in Giorgione. Two paintings by him, the &#146;Tempesta in the 
Accademia in Venice, and the altarpiece at Castelfranco, just to the north of Venice, point to the qualities of his art. There is a deep vein of poetry, of the 
mysterious beauty of the world. This needs to be seen in the context of Venetian life; the Venetian patricians were at this time building many villas on the mainland to 
which they retreated from the summer heat of Venice. A new awareness of nature was born, and finds its consummation in the Giorgionesque moment in art, which 
for a short period was to dominate the art of Venice. What must be remembered, however, is that Venice was primarily a great trading center, and a proud state. 
This finds its most perfect expression in Veronese (1528-1588). He was a wonderful colorist, and more fully than any other conveys to us that sense of well-being, 
of man as a splendid creature, which is one of the prime gifts of Venetian art. Like Veronese, many sculptors and architects fulfilled the needs of Venice&#146;s rich 
merchant families, and of the state. Among the architects there was above all Sansovino whose Old Library of S. Marco, erected between 1536 and 1553, 
expresses the spirit of the Renaissance, while remaining in keeping with the Doge&#146;s Palace which it faces. The churches of Venice, are, too, full of splendid 
monuments. Working on the Venetian mainland were brilliant architects, Sanmicheli (1484-1559) and Palladio (1518-1580). Sanmicheli in Verona designed city 
gates and palaces at once severe and elegant, while Palladio was responsible for several great churches in Venice, notably S. Giorgio Maggiore, and with his many 
villas on the mainland created a style of architecture which echoed all over the world, and, in particularly was profoundly to condition the design of the English 
country house. </p>
<p>Titian living to anoble old age, like Giovanni Bellini before him, was in his work to evolve far beyond his Giorgionesque beginnings. As he grew older his brushwork 
became freer and freer, culminating in his last works in which according to Marco Boschini, writing in 1674, he finished his pictures &quot;more with his fingers than his 
brush&quot;. This tonal method of painting was to have a profound influence in the 17th century. Outside Venice in those cities subject to her on the mainland individual 
schools of painting had developed in the 15th century, and flourished in the 16th century. Occasionally artists who do not quite reach greatness produced a noble 
picture. Moretto (circa 1498-1554) and Savoldo (active 1508, still alive 1548), in Brescia, painted in lovely cool harmonies of gray, and in Verona, which 
produced many admirable painters, Francesco Morone (circa 1471-1529), with his &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, in S. Bernardino, painted a deeply moving picture. Away from 
Venice, the early years of the 16th century were for Italy a troubled period, culminating in the sack of Rome in 1527. The old age was over, men could no longer 
believe in themselves. Consciousness of self was superseded by self-consciousness. Yet art was sustained by the towering genius of Michelangelo (1475-1564). 
He commanded the visual arts, and also that of the pen. In sculpture he expressed both the grand, and agony, and his tombs of Lorenzo and Giuliano de&#146; Medici in 
the New Sacristy of San Lorenzo, in Florence, symbolize the active and the contemplative life. After Giotto and Masaccio, Michelangelo represents the third 
turning point in Florentine art, and he exerted the greatest single influence upon the art of the 16th century. As an architect his crowning glory was the dome of St. 
Peter&#146;s, just as his greatest work as an artist is also within the Vatican. This is his fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, and his &#146;Last Judgment on the end wall. 
In his &quot;Last Judgment&quot; in both size and accomplishment one of the most stupendous achievements in all art, a vast number of figures of noble proportions are in 
postures eloquent of man as a consummate physical animal. The exaggeration inherent in the Sistine was carried to extremes by Michelangelo&#146;s followers. 
Exaggeration, both of anatomy and movement, and equally of emotion is, indeed, one of the dominant characteristics of Mannerism, the style which flourished in 
Italy throughout much of the 16th century. In Parma, Parmigianino (1504-1540) gave to art an extraordinary, affected elegance, while in Florence Bronzino 
(1503-1572), and Pontormo (1494-1557) were the leading Mannerist painters. They often achieved beautiful color harmonies, and Bronzino was a fine portrait 
painter, but Mannerism was to end in affectation. One artist in Venice, Tintoretto (1518-1594), was to carry on the old Venetian feeling for color, and to use 
Mannerist devices of composition and in the painting of individual figures. Like Titian, Tintoretto was one of the great colorists of all time.</p>
<h3><a name="rom_bar">ROMAN BAROQUE</a></h3>
<p>In painting Caravaggio (1573-1610) and Annibale Carracci (1560-1609) were the heralds of the Baroque. Caravaggio, whose life was stormy, introduced a new 
manner in painting, which was carried on by his followers, both Italians and northerners, known as Caravaggisti. There is an emphasis upon light and shade, and, 
above all, upon the direct observation of nature rather than the artificialities of Mannerism. Annibale Carracci, on the other hand, represents a Classicising trend, 
and his decoration of the Farnese Palace, in Rome, recalls Raphael&#146;s Stanze in the Vatican. Roman Baroque art can best be understood in terms of the conflict 
between, on the one hand, this Classicism and, on the other, the pure Baroque. The exponents of both trends were influenced by the past, the Classicists above all 
by Raphael, the exponents of the Baroque by Caravaggio and the Venetians. Classicism found expression in Annibale Carracci&#146;s pupil Domenichino (1581-1641), 
and with Poussin (1593/4-1665), the Frenchman long resident in Rome. It had a champion in Andrea Sacchi (1599-1661) and was carried on into the 18th 
century by Carlo Caratta (1625-1713). The other trend, that of the High Baroque, finds its first major expression in Guercino&#146;s &#146;Aurora&#146; in the Casino Ludovisi 
(1621-23), and in Lanfranco&#146;s decoration of the cupola of S. Andrea della Valle (1625-27). But it is with three other figures, Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598-1680), 
Pietro da Cortona (1696-1669), and Gaulli (1639-1709), known as Baciccia, that it is most fully exploited. Bernini, who practiced painting, architecture, and 
sculpture, but was above all a great architect and sculptor, is the supreme representative of the Roman Baroque. In his hands that union of the different arts, which 
is a key element of the Baroque, finds perfect expression and his influence was in the latter part of his life all pervasive. His great baldacchino over the High Altar in 
St. Peter&#146;s, his fountains in the Piazza Navona, with their writhing monsters, and his Cornaro Chapel in S. Maria della Vittoria are all examples of the spirit of the 
Baroque in sculpture, while his vast piazza in front of St. Peter&#146;s is his greatest architectural work. Baroque is represented by Baciccia&#146;s ceiling of the nave of the 
Church of Ges&ugrave;, where the figures spill out over the ceiling, and with Pietro da Cortona&#146;s ceiling of the saloon in the Palazzo Barberini, crowded with a vast number 
of figures in agitated movement In architecture Maderno in 1612 completed the, nave and facade of St. Peter&#146;s, while Borromini (1599-1667) in the church of S. 
Carlo alle Quattro Fontane used a complex, yet practical spatial effect, which is highly sensuous, and was vastly influential. Outside Rome there was also, 
throughout the 17th century and into the 18th century, feverish building activity. In Naples Cosimo Fanzago (1591-1678) perfected elaborate decorative schemes 
in marble, in the first half of the 18th century Sanfelice (1675-1748) designed daring polygonal churches, and Domenico Antonio Vaccaro (1678-1745) was an 
exponent of the light and airy architecture and decoration of the Rococo. In Turin Juvarra, the greatest Italian architect of the 18th century, built (1717-31) the 
church and monastery of the Superga, upon a daring undulating plan and his palace at Stupinigi, near the city, unites low wings with a great central core. There was 
also much building activity in Venice. Many palaces were erected, and in S. Maria della Salute, on the Grand Canal. Longhena in 1632 and 1656, produced the 
most grandiose of all centrally planned buildings. It is in effect one vast open space under a huge dome. In painting there were many local schools. and artists such 
as Luca Giordano traveled all over Italy executing fresco Cycles and paintings full of energy and decorative effect. In Bologna Guido Reni (1575-1642) produced 
pious religious pictures, to this day for the faithful deeply moving, in Lombardy, at such places as the Sacro Monte at Varallo, sculpture and painting were united to 
illustrate the Life of Christ, Neapolitan painters like Solimena (1657-1747) worked in a vigorous style. and in Genoa many palaces were decorated by local artists.<br>
It was in Venice towards the end of the 17th century, and in the early years of the 18th century, that there was a revival in painting. Two artists. Sebastiano Ricci 
(1659-1734) and Pellegrini (1675-1741), looking back to Veronese, produced pictures which are colorful, light in tone, and wonderfully painterly. The spirit of the 
Rococo was to find its perfect exponent among artists in another Venetian, G. B. Tiepolo (1696-1770). He was one of the most brilliant of all decorators, and his 
frescoes over the grand staircase of the palace at Wurzburg. and on the ceiling of the Ges&ugrave;ati, in Venice, for sheer daring rival the achievement of the Roman 
Baroque, while being lighter and gayer in feeling, and his decoration of the Palazzo Labia, in Venice, recalls Veronese at Maser, but is more sumptuous. Venice 
also produced two view painters of genius, Canaletto (1697-1768), much loved by the English for his accurate views of the city, and Francesco Guardi 
(1712-93)~, who with his atmospheric paintings of real and imaginary Venetian scenes captured the spirit of the Rococo.</p>
<h3><a name="modern">MODERN TIMES</a></h3>
<p>At the same time, particularly in Rome, there was a classical trend, represented by Pompeo Batoni (1708-87), a fine portrait painter. It was to lead on to Canova 
(1757-1822), the sculptor, and one of the greatest exponents of Neo-Classicism. The frozen perfection of such figures as his Pauline Borghese, in the Borghese 
Gallery, in Rome, dominated the taste of an age. In the 20th century, in our own time. there has been a great revival in Italian architecture. Nervi has produced 
brilliant sports palaces, while Gio Ponti&#146;s Pirelli Building, in Milan, is perhaps the most elegant of all skyscrapers. Both architects carry on the great Italian tradition 
of architecture by making imaginative use of 20th century technology.</p>

<h4><a name="early">Early Settlements</a></h4>
<p>The earliest human settlements within the territory of present-day Italy date almost certainly to the initial &#160;phase of the Quaternary era (Pleistocene). This period was 
characterized by frequent alternation in climatic conditions, with consequent phases of expansion and retreat in the Alpine and Apennine glaciers and relative 
variations in sea level. These settlements were generally situated in coastal caves, in shelters at the base of rock walls or near lake shores. They date to around 500 
000 years ago and correspond to the Lower Paleolithic, the longest period of human prehistory, which was dominated by the notable diffusion of tools made from 
flaked stone and ended some 10 000 years ago. Among the earliest sites of this period are Pineta di Isernia, recently discovered and dating to some 730 000 years 
ago, and Quinzano (Verona), from over 400 000 years ago. Other important Lower Paleolithic sites have been found near Imola (Valle del Correcchio), in Lazio 
(Torre in Pietra, Fontana Liri, Anagni, Arce), in Abruzzo (Teramano, Maiella), in Basilicata (Venosa), in Puglia (Gargano), in Campania (Capri), in Liguria (Balzi 
Rossi). Although rich in tools and animal bones, only some of these sites have provided a small quantity of human skeletal remains resembling those from the more 
recent sites of the Middle Palaeolithic, dating to the Riss-W&uuml;rm interglacial period and part of the succeeding W&uuml;rm glaciation (circa 120 000 to 36 000 years 
ago). These bones belong to a species named `Homo Sapiens Neanderthalensis', who lived in the caves of Circeo (Lazio), the terraces of the Tiber Valley (Rome), 
the coasts of the Salento (Grotta Romanelli) and the Gargano (Puglia), those of Western Liguria (Balzi Rossi and Finalese) and many other sites. Here they left 
traces of an industry known as Mousterian and characterized by the presence of scrapers (flakes of flint retouched only on one side). During the Upper Palaeolithic, 
the successive period covering from circa 36 000 to 10 000 years ago, the Neanderthals gave way to the present species of man `Homo sapiens sapiens' during 
the final phases of the W&uuml;rm glaciation. The numerous traces from this period are particularly rich in burials, animal bones and tools, the latter having been worked 
with increased precision. The first examples of rock art now appear (engravings and graffiti in the caves of M. Pellegrino and Levanzo in Sicily, in Grotta Romanelli 
on the Salento Coast and the Balzi Rossi in Liguria) and statues like the small female ones from Savignano and Chiozza di Scandiano in Emilia and the Venus 
figurines from the Balzi Rossi. In the few thousand years of the following Mesolithic period (circa 10 000 to 6 000 years ago) the climate continued to grow milder. 
Tools became very small (microliths) and inhumation came into use. Sites from this period have been found throughout the entire Italian peninsula, principally at the 
Balzi Rossi, Arene Candide, in the Colli Berici (Covolo della Paina), on Capri (Grotta delle Felci) and at Positano (Grotta La Porta), being along the coasts in the 
plains and on the mountains.</p>
<p>With the Neolithic period, from circa 6000 BC to 2800 BC, the traditional hunting and gathering economy was replaced by the introduction of agriculture, stock 
rearing, weaving and pottery. This new cultural influence came particularly from the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East. Using the pottery production above 
all, it has been possible to reconstruct fairly accurately the various phases of this complex period. Initially it was characterized by Impressed Ware, such as that 
found on the Tremiti Isles, in Sicily (Stentinello) and Liguria (Arene Candide) and then by the painted forms (Southern Italy). Among the noted Neolithic cultures 
are those of Lagozza (Varese), Fiorano, Chiozza and Pescale (Emilia), with their square-mouthed and scratched decorated pots. Some interesting Neolithic traces 
have remained in the hut villages of the lower Brescian area, in Emilia and the Teramo area (Valle della Vibrata) or in the rock dwellings and tombs of Pulo di 
Molfetta (Puglia), Stentinello, Megara Iblea and Matrensa (Sicily). The second half of the third millennium BC is characterized by the use of copper, introduced into 
Italy from the Eastern Mediterranean, alongside stone. The Copper Age has produced interesting pottery types from Rinaldone (Viterbo), Gaudo (Paestum) and 
Remedello (Brescia); these were pastoral settlements with rock-cut tombs or trench graves. The working of flint, as still practiced by the Campignians in parts of 
the Gargano and Veneto, declined. Instead, the Camunian culture, which has left its traces in the rock engravings of the lower Val Camonica (Brescia), began the 
development that was to continue throughout the Bronze Age. Also in the Copper Age appeared the first examples of palafitte or villages of pile dwellings built on 
the pre-alpine lakes. These reached their maximum development in the subsequent Bronze Age (corresponding to the second millennium BC), which was 
characterized by the widespread growth of metallurgy. The type site for this culture is Polada (Lake Garda), contemporary with which there flourished on the 
southern margin of the Po Plain the Terramare culture of sedentary agriculturists. The pastoral way of life is instead represented by the Apennine culture that 
developed especially in Central-Southern Italy and was also characterized by a war-like spirit.</p>
<p>The Bronze Age also saw the flowering of true regional groupings, with highly organized social structures and territorial ranges. This can be seen from the remains of 
their permanent settlements and respective megalithic constructions, like the nuraghi in Sardinia, the castellieri in the Eastern Alps, and the dolmens and menhirs on 
the Salento, of clearly Middle Eastern derivation. The rock engravings on M. Bego (Maritime Alps, now in France) belong to the late Bronze Age, as do the 
urnfield cultures that spread so rapidly and mark the change of rite from inhumation to cremation. The Iron Age then followed with the beginning of the first 
millennium BC. During all this period there were increasing contacts with the Phoenician and Greek colonists: the former being largely present on the coasts of 
Sardinia and western Sicily and the latter in Southern Italy. These colonies had a considerable influence on the development of local cultures (from the Picenian to 
Campano-Samnite and the Apulian to Bruttio-Lucanian). Among the main Iron Age cultures are those of Golasecca (Varese) in north-west Italy and Atestine 
(Adige Valley) mainly in the Veneto, while the Villanovan culture, direct heir of the urnfield cultures (indicated as proto-Villanovan) spread throughout Emilia and 
the remainder of Central Italy, even reaching Campania (Pontecagnano). This was the cultural base on which the Etruscan civilization was to develop.</p>
<p>With the Iron Age Italy and her population practically enter the historical period, even if some while after the more advanced Eastern Mediterranean and Near East 
civilizations from where arrived particular influences. At the beginning of the first millennium BC the following native tribes could be distinguished on Italian territory: 
the Ligures, on the coast that bears their name, in the northern Apennine valleys, part of the pre-alpine valleys and the western Po Valley; the Sicani, in the interior 
of Sicily; and the Itali, in present-day Calabria (from whom comes the name `Italy', which was to be extended to all the territory of the peninsula). Besides the 
already mentioned Terramare tribe, on the southern edge of the Po Valley, and the Villanovans, probably from Eastern Europe and settled throughout Central Italy, 
there were also the Umbrians to the east of the upper basin of the Tiber. The Veneti, who occupied the territory that still bears their name, originally came from 
Illyria as did the Messapii and Iapyges, who settled in present-day Puglia (Apulia). Many other populations of Central-Southern Italy were created by the mixing of 
local and foreign elements dating back to the previous millennium. As in the case of the Sabines and Latini who settled in Lazio together with Falisci, Aequi, Volsci, 
Hernici and Ausones. The interior of Abruzzo was dominated by the Vestini, Paeligni and Marsi, while the central Adriatic coast was populated by Picentes, 
Marrucini and Frentani. The Apennine area of Molise and Basilicata was peopled by the Samnites and Lucanians. In Calabria and Sicily there were also the Bruttii 
and Siculi. The Phoenician colonization of the coasts of the Western Mediterranean were limited in Italy to Sardinia and western Sicily and preceded that of the 
Greeks. It was followed by Punic settlements (Trapani, Palermo, Cagliari) linked to the ancient Phoenician colony of Carthage.</p>
<h4><a name="greek">Greek and Etruscan Colonization</a></h4>
<p>During the 8C BC the Greeks arrived in Italy. They came from Euboea, Argolis, Locris, Crete and the Aegean islands, settling on the southern coasts (from 
Campania to Apulia) and eastern and southern Sicily. They founded many prosperous colonies whose economy was generally based on agriculture and commerce. 
Often they allied together against common enemies but they were also divided by disagreement and rivalry. The term `Magna Grecia' describes a population and 
civilization rather than a political reality. Among the first to settle on the Italian coasts were the Achaeans (of Dorian origins) who founded towns like Taranto, 
Metaponto, Posidonia (Paestum), and Sibari. They were followed by Locrians and then Chalcidians from Euboea who founded Naxos (Taormina), Zancle 
(Messina) and, after the occupation of Pitecusa (Ischia), Cuma in Campania. The Corinthians founded Siracusa, still in the 8C BC, and the Megarians Megara 
Hyblaea on the Gulf of Augusta. Finally, the Phocaeans founded Elea (Velia) in Campania. While in Northern Italy, during the first half of the first millennium BC, 
there began the increasing penetration of the Gauls (of Celtic origins) from beyond the Alps, who would gradually occupy the entire Po Valley, on the Tyrrhenian 
slopes of Central Italy the Etruscans began to take form (circa 8C BC). The latter had an advanced civilization whose origins are still not clear. Whether they 
migrated from the East (as many aspects of their civilization suggest) by land or sea, or developed on the peninsula itself as direct heirs of the Villanovans, it is clear 
that the Etruscans formed the most important Italic cultural and political ethnic group before the advent of Roman power</p>
<h3><a name="roman">ROMAN CIVILIZATION</a></h3>
<p>Already during the Copper Age the area of the Alban Hills, just to the south of the mouth of the Tiber, was inhabited by an Italic agricultural and pastoral tribe 
called Latini. And it was due to them, in all probability, that Rome was founded towards the middle of the 8C BC on one of the numerous hills (the Palatine) in the 
marshy depressions surrounding the river. The town and territory occupied by the Latini expanded gradually during the royal period (753-510 BC, under the seven 
kings of Rome: Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquin Priscus, Servius Tullius and Tarquin the Proud). In this period the juridical and 
social organization of the new nation evolved, revealing clear influence from the nearby Etruscan civilization.<br>
Territorially, at the end of the 6C BC, Roman Lazio extended over some 2000 sq. km. It covered the lower Aniene Valley as far as its junction with the Tiber and 
from there to the sea, besides including the major part of the Alban Hills and the coast from the mouth of the Tiber to the promontory of Anzio. Alongside stock 
rearing and agriculture the economy of the Latin monarchy was based on commerce, favored by Rome's geographic position between Campania (Magna Grecia) 
and Etruria as well as by the proximity of the mouth of the Tiber, which was a harbor of growing importance also because of the presence of productive salt pans.</p>
<h4><a name="rom_rep">The Republic</a></h4>
<p>The passage from monarchy to republic (510-509 BC) was not only a simple institutional change. It also involved a profound juridical and social transformation, as 
with the emancipation of the plebes who succeeded in gaining access to the highest offices of State, previously a monopoly of the patrician oligarchy. The complex 
events of the social struggles with the latter class produced the promulgation of written laws for the first time. These Laws of the Twelve Tables, carved in bronze 
(450 BC), were soon followed by others. While developing its own institutions and social structure, the Roman State found itself involved in a series of conflicts 
with the neighboring populations. Rome so succeeded in strengthening her position that at the end of the 3C BC rivaled the other four great military Mediterranean 
powers: Carthage, Egypt, Syria and Macedonia. After having survived the danger of new Gallic invasions, which in 390 BC had crossed the Po Valley and the 
Apennines to sack Rome itself after having defeated armies first at Chiusi and then on the banks of the Allia (387 BC), Rome completed the conquest of Lazio. It 
did this by conquering the towns of the Volsci (Anzio) to the south and those of the Etruscans (Tarquinia, Faleri and Caere) to the north of the Tiber; Veio had 
already been acquired after a ten-year siege at the beginning of the century (396 BC) by Furius Camillus. In mid-4C BC, following its gradual expansion, Rome 
necessarily came up against the Samnites who had descended from the heart of the central-southern Apennines towards the fertile lands of Campania, where they 
rapidly conquered the flourishing towns of Capua (438 BC) and Cuma (421 BC). The rich town of Paestum had already been occupied by the Lucanians. Rome 
wisely entered an alliance with the Samnites (354 BC) against the pressure of the nearby populations. Conflict with the Samnites for Campanian dominance was 
however inevitable and lasted for over half a century (343-290 BC). It had three distinct phases with alternating fortunes, such as the crushing Roman defeat at 
Caudine Forks (321 BC), until Rome won the definitive victory at Sentinum (295 BC) against a coalition that also included Etruscans and Senones, a Gallic tribe. 
With her predominance in Central Italy consolidated, Rome prepared to extend it over the rest of the peninsula during a ten-year conflict with Taranto (282-272 
BC), who was allied with the king of Epirus, Pyrrhus. While they enjoyed a modest victory at Ausculum (279BC), they were heavily defeated at Beneventum (275 
BC). Rome thus achieved total supremacy of the Italian peninsula and set up a complicated system of alliances between the territory of Rome, towns and colonies 
enjoying full or partial Roman citizenship (`civitates sine suffragio') and the others who, while being independent, recognized Roman sovereignty in the context of a 
confederation extending over some 130 000 sq km and equipped with well over half a million soldiers Romans and allies). The economy of the whole Italic 
federation, whose territory now extended from Tuscany (through Pisa-Pistoia-Fiesole-Rimini, but excluding the upper course of the Arno) to southern-most 
Calabria, was strengthened by the construction of the first important inland road, the Via Appia, running from Rome to Capua and Benevento (312-268 BC), as 
well as the development of the fleet and marine transport. At the same time the monetary system was expanded with the minting of bronze (300 BC) and silver 
(269 BC) coins.</p>
<h4><a name="ro_ca">Rome &amp; Carthage</a></h4>
<p>For more than two centuries, since when in 509 BC the new Roman Republic had made a friendship treaty with Carthage, relations between the two states had 
remained good. Indeed, in 306 BC they were reinforced with the reciprocal recognition of a Roman sphere of influence over Italy and a Carthaginian one over 
Sicily. On the island, in fact, the last tyrant of Syracuse, Agatocles, was defeated at Ecnomus in 310 by the Carthaginians who had been opposed by the 
Syracusians for almost a century. With their expansionist policy, the young and powerful Rome certainly could not be content with only the Italian peninsula. The 
conquest of Magna Grecia had to be completed with that of Sicily, even if it meant breaking with Carthage. The opportunity came with the revolt of the Mamertine 
mercenaries, who had seized Messina and asked Rome for help against the Carthaginian garrison (265 BC). The struggle between Rome and Carthage was to 
continue until the end of the century (264-201 BC) ending in two separate conflicts: Sicily was the scene of the first (264-241 BC) until it became a Roman 
province; and slightly later (238-227 BC) Sardinia and Corsica met the same fate. In this way the Tyrrhenian became the first entirely Roman sea (`Mare nostrum').<br>
The Second Punic War (218-201 BC) began from the Carthaginians besieging Saguntum (219 BC), an Iberian town allied with Rome. Despite Hannibal's 
legendary crossing of the Pyrenees and Alps into the heart of Italy and his repeated defeats of the Romans (at the rivers Ticino and Trebbia, Lake Trasimeno and 
Canne), the Romans still managed to definitively defeat the Carthaginians at Zama (202 BC). Gaining this victory under Scipio Africanus. Forced, during the conflict 
with the Carthaginians, to fight on different fronts and against different allied enemies, from the Iberian peninsula to the Po Valley and from Illyria (on the opposite 
shore of the Adriatic) to Macedonia, Rome took the occasion of its many victories over the Celtic (Iberi and Galli) and Hellenic (Greeks and Macedonians) 
peoples, who were often allied with Carthage, to enlarge her territorial domain and political sphere of influence over a large part of the Mediterranean basin. Of 
particular importance in this regard was the conquest of Greece, through the three Macedonian Wars (215-146 BC), and the control of Asia Minor (133 BC). 
While with the destruction of Carthage (146 BC, at the end of the brief Third Punic War), Corinth (146 BC) and Numantia (133 BC) Rome had become the major 
Mediterranean military power. Meanwhile, to the traditional Roman economic activities of agriculture and pastoralism, which had declined due to war destruction 
(with the consequent abandonment of the fields and rural deterioration), there were added military and commercial interests. The latter was a monopoly of the 
equites (the knightly or propertied class) who, also thanks to contracts for revenue collection and public works, began to form a rich urban middle-class. The 
conquest of Greece also had a profound effect on the cultural development of the Roman world. This took the form of Hellenisation, which changed society and 
customs while handing on the inheritance of Greek civilization to successive centuries. Finally, under the socio-economic heading, came the agricultural crisis. This 
was to cost the lives of the brothers Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus (133-121 BC), tribunes of the plebes, who came up against the conservatism of the oligarchic 
senate. However, the agrarian question gradually led to the rebellion of the Italic peoples, who were still excluded from Roman citizenship and therefore the 
allotment of land to cultivate in the `ager publicus'. In 90 BC a league was formed that, after varying military fortunes, finally achieved its aspirations. In this way too 
the political unification of Italy became concrete and was not to be interrupted even during the following period of bitter civil wars: between Gaius Marius and 
Lucius Sulla (88-82 BC); Caesar and Pompey (49-46 BC); Octavian and Anthony (3630 BC); or even by the fierce struggles provoked by the slave revolts.</p>
<h4><a name="emp">The Empire</a></h4>
<p>The events of the first century BC in Italy are marked by a move from republican liberties to dictatorial regimes and a return to a democratic-type structure (rather 
similar to present-day presidential republics) with the advent of the principate of Augustus (27 BC-AD 14). At this stage the State was transformed into the Roman 
Empire, which gradually became a kind of elective monarchy although hereditary transmission was also not a rare occurrence. The Empire was to formally last until 
beyond mid 5C AD (476 was the year in which the last emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed) but came to an end for all practical purposes at the death of 
Emperor Theodosius (AD 395). During the forty years of his principate, Octavian sought to give his empire a better organized territorial structure, which was 
necessary for the administrative, judicial and military reforms that were to flow. In this structure Italy formed one of the senatorial provinces in which the Empire 
was divided; this province was divided in its turn into eleven independent administrative regions, with the exceptions of Sardinia and Corsica that were imperial 
provinces. Much later, under Diocletian (284-305), these last two, together with the Italian peninsula and the addition of Rhaetia, formed the diocese of Italy, which 
was united to that of Africa as one of the four prefectures of the Empire. Octavian also took particular care to construct an efficient road network to link the various 
imperial provinces. These roads are represented in detail on the `Tabula Peutingeriana', which shows the entire imperial road network and probably dates to AD 
4C. Though retaining the Empire's capital (until it was transferred to Constantinople at the beginning of the 4C), the imperial period saw a radical economic and 
political change. In Italy this was characterized by the gradual loss of its pre-eminence in comparison with the other provinces with which it had to compete. The 
possibility of importing from many parts of the world all types of products, including foodstuffs, signaled the progressive decline of cultivation by small and medium 
proprietors and favored the large cereal and pastoral estates to which flocked as tenants the old peasant class. Also, after the relative prosperity of the Augustan 
and Antonine periods, there was a profound reduction in cultivation and large-scale crops partially replaced specialized forms, such as grapes and olives. Another 
aspect was the growth of towns, which became the centers of political and economic life and thus also attracted an increasing population. Industrial production was 
organized by the State through its `fabricae', while craftsmanship took a corporate form that served to further harden social structures. </p>
<p>The last hundred years of the Western Roman Empire, from the second half of the 4C, coincided with large migrations of Germanic peoples (Visigoths, Vandals, 
Burgundians, Huns, Heruli, Alemanni etc.) who on different occasions settled within her territories. At the same time economic conditions also reflected the political 
instability of the imperial government, it deteriorated gradually and was accompanied by a chronic fall in population. Already by the 5C the Italian population had 
been reduced to some six million inhabitants. With the end of the Western Roman Empire the Italian territory remained basically united, first under the rule of 
Odoacer and then that of Theodoric the Ostrogoth (493-526). Under the latter, the country had periods of relative economic prosperity and peace. This was also 
due to the contribution of illustrious Romanists such as Boethius, Cassiodorus and Symmachus. It was in this period that the influence of the Christian church began 
to make itself felt more consistently. This was in contrast to the progressive orientalization of the Empire, now focused on its new capital of Costantinople, founded 
by the emperor Constantine between 326-330 on the site of the ancient Greek colony of Byzantium. The Christian church sought to continue the authority and 
prestige of Rome. In particular there emerged the figures of popes such as Leo I (440-461) and Gregory the Great (590-604) who were capable of bringing 
prestige to the institution they represented. Under the latter in particular, the church also began to assume political and administrative functions due to repeated 
territorial acquisitions (St. Peter's patrimony). Also at the end of the 4C there began to flower western monachism, with its major figure in St. Benedict of Nursia 
(480-543). The Benedictine monasteries and abbeys, but also those of other orders, became already in the early Middle Ages not only places of religion but 
centers for the preservation and spread of culture. In addition, they took an important economic role due to their schemes for the drainage and use of lands 
devastated and depopulated by recurrent war. The papacy, monasteries and other ecclesiastical institutions found themselves in possession of huge estates, often 
enlarged by further donations, that contributed to strengthen their political authority and power. The deterioration in relations between Theodoric's successors and 
the Eastern Empire offered the emperor Justinian (527-565) the opportunity to re-unite the Empire. This he did at the price of a difficult conflict, the Graeco-Gothic 
War (535-553), which had grave consequences for the Italian territory as it was placed under the government of the Exarchate of Ravenna.</p>
<h4><a name="lombard">THE LOMBARDS AND CHARLEMAGNE</a></h4>
<p>Byzantine dominion was however short-lived. In 568 a new Barbarian invasion brought the Lombards of Alboin to Italy. They reached as far as the southern 
regions and built a large kingdom, with its capital at Pavia, which was to last for over two hundred years (774). This put an end to the political and territorial unity 
that the country had preserved thus far. In fact, alongside the Lombards the temporal power of the church began to take shape. It acquired the Exarchate and the 
Pentapolis, former Byzantine territory corresponding to today's Marche and eastern Emilia, obtained from the Lombards themselves after their conversion to 
Christianity. Meanwhile, the island and both extremities of the peninsula, Calabria (modern Puglia) and Bruttia (modern Calabria), remained under Byzantium. Italy 
was now incapable of taking an independent political initiative and after the Lombards had to submit to another European people. The Franks descended into Italy 
to support the pope against the Lombards. With the victory of Charlemagne over the Lombard Desiderius, Italy was to remain for over two centuries (774) in the 
orbit of the Carolingian dynasty, which had substituted the Lombards in the Kingdom of Italy. It was, however, a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire in the context of 
which it co-existed with the Patrimony of St. Peter, which was to become the future Papal States. The Lombards retained the Duchy of Benevento, which was 
transformed into a principality and maintained considerable independence until the beginning of the 11C when it provided the origins for the principalities of Salerno 
and Capua. In the meantime, there occurred the Arab expansion throughout the Mediterranean and Italy herself was involved. During the 9C, in fact (827-902), 
Sicily fell entirely into Saracen hands and became the base for raids along the coasts or even into the interior of the Italian peninsula. Still in the South of Italy, there 
began to appear in this period the first independent city-states with the formation of independent signorie such as at Naples, Amalfi and Gaeta, which because of 
their position on the sea were able to develop a mercantile economy. These are the first examples of the free communes that were to flourish slightly later in 
Central-Northern Italy. In Southern Italy instead they were to be suffocated after a brief season by the arrival, towards the middle of the 11C, of another 
conquering northern people. The Normans were professional soldiers and rapidly took control of all Southern Italy, Sicily included. Their rule lasted for almost two 
centuries, from 1029 (acquisition of Aversa) to 1220, which was the year of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen's accession to the Sicilian throne. </p>
<h4><a name="feud">THE FEUDAL SYSTEM</a></h4>
<p>With first the Normans and then the Hohenstaufen (1220-1266), besides the institution of particularly efficient state structures that formed a network of control 
throughout the territory, there was introduced into Italy, with all its juridical implications, the feudal system. This further favored the expansion of large 
establishments, whether civil or ecclesiastical, but conserved for the towns sufficient independence to guarantee the development of economic activities. Frederick 
II also made a notable cultural contribution. He founded the University of Naples and encouraged the formation of the Sicilian School, which made a fundamental 
contribution to the development of the new Italian language, alongside the contemporary Tuscan poets and prose-writers. The enlightened absolutism of Frederick 
II was however accompanied by an administrative reform (Constitution of Melfi, 1231) favoring bureaucracy and tax collection. The latter, in particular, imposed 
restrictions on economic activities. Northern and Central Italy after the bitter contests of feudal lords, like Guy of Spoleto and Berengar of Friuli, was conquered, 
after the collapse of the Carolingian Empire, by Otto I of Saxony(951). He was crowned Holy Roman Emperor (962) by the pope, thus uniting the crowns of Italy 
and Germany in a relationship that was to last for some thousand years. Again in Northern Italy, the city of Venice had managed to become independent. Founded 
on the lagoon by refugees from Aquileia destroyed by the Huns of Attila, it had initially developed under the protection of Byzantium. Lacking a hinterland for 
centuries, the city was governed by a Maggior Consiglio presided over by a doge, supporting itself essentially by sea trade. It managed to achieve a monopoly over 
Eastern Mediterranean traffic by establishing permanent commercial bases (fondachi) that were often transformed into colonies. In this quest for sea trade, Venice 
was often in competition with other marine republics. Genoa, for example, managed at the beginning of the 11C to conquer Corsica and Sardinia. Amalfi codified 
maritime law with its `Tabulae Amalfitanae'. While Pisa, who besieged Sardinia (1116), was permanently defeated by Genoa at the sea battle of Meloria (1284). 
Perhaps the most significant factor in their development, however, were the Crusades (10-13C).</p>
<h4><a name="communes">THE FREE COMMUNES</a></h4>
<p>This development of mercantile activity by the maritime cities (which also favored the accumulation of capital as a necessary condition for economic enterprises, 
apart from often being an instrument of political influence) was accompanied, over the period spanning the first and second millennium AD, by a slow but sure 
social, economic and cultural growth in the rest of Italy. A new religious spirit can be seen in the initiatives of various, rulers, as in the case of Henry II, the last 
emperor from the House of Saxony (1002-24). Agriculture, crafts and commerce prospered, the latter two in particular becoming the foundations of an urban 
economy that was to produce the Free Communes so characteristic of a large part of Central-Northern Italy. Notwithstanding their formal subjection to the 
emperor, his Italian feudal lords (and with them, though often in opposition, the newly emerging urban middle-classes, the religious and military aristocracy and the 
administrative bureaucracy) were particularly attached to the personal and caste privileges they had gradually acquired. Thus it was not surprising that they rebelled, 
led by Arduin, marquis of Ivrea, who was elected king of Italy (1002-14), against the excessive demands of the bishops and counts and the imperial attempts to 
re-establish supremacy. The particular interest of the German imperial dynasties (Saxons and Franks) in Italy and the Church of Rome's constant assertions of 
independence, combined with identical claims for supremacy, inevitably led to conflict between emperor and pope. The ensuing investiture contest was to last for 
over sixty years (1059-1122) before being settled, in favor of the church, by the Concordat of Worms. With the replacement of the Swabian House of 
Hohenstaufen over that of Bavaria at the head of the empire, the Italian Free Communes formed the Lombard League and, supported by the pope, defeated the 
new Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick I Barbarossa at the Battle of Legnano (1176). This was soon claimed as a symbol of refound national unity in the face of 
foreign intervention but can more realistically be seen as a particular reaction of Italian society of that period against the sovereignty of the emperor. An echo of this 
conflict was to occur in the following century with the tragic end of the House of Hohenstaufen, following the deaths of Manfred, Frederick II's illegitimate son, at 
Benevento (1266) and then of Conradin (1268). These events marked the decline of the Ghibelline idea of imperial and lay supremacy against the consolidation of 
the church's temporal power and the prevailing Guelf ideal of papal authority over the State. The resolution of differences between lay and religious ideals, realized 
with a further request for help from foreign powers, was a choice that was very soon to damage Italian liberty. The pope's request to the Angevins for assistance 
against the last of the Hohenstaufen only laid Italy open to new foreign occupations and the division of her territory among the early European nations. The Angevins 
were to remain in Southern Italy for almost two centuries (1266-1442), only initially encountering the obstacle of the war following the Sicilian Vespers Revolt 
(1282-1302) with the island consequently passing to the House of Aragon. In 1287 the capital of the Kingdom of Sicily was transferred to Naples, while the 
strongly fiscal and centralizing policy of the new rulers led to the surrounding territory being sacrificed to the capital, traces of which can still be seen today in the 
social and economic imbalance of Southern Italy.</p>
<h4><a name="ori_mod">THE ORIGINS OF THE MODERN STATE</a></h4>
<p>The ending of imperial authority, quickly followed by the papal crisis involving its transfer to France from 1309 to 1377, was accompanied by a strengthening in the 
independence of the Northern and Central Italian communes. There was also a notable economic improvement for the majority of towns in the Po Valley and 
Tuscany. In particular, while the maritime cities (Venice, Genoa etc.) retained control of the spice trade and other oriental products, industrial and commercial 
activities (especially the working of wool and the dyeing of textiles) flourished in the cities of the interior, like Florence and Milan, favoring the accumulation of 
capital and therefore the growth of financial dealings. It is of significance that it was in Tuscany that Francesco Datini of Prato introduced the promissory note that 
was so useful for banking transactions. Tuscan, Lombard and even Venetian and Roman bankers financed the military undertakings of European sovereigns and the 
papacy, thus increasing their own prestige and political influence. </p>
<p>The scarce inclination of the newly-formed urban middle-class for military activities led to a search for the protection and support of their interests by the powerful 
feudal families. In a short time, although in the name of the people, they acquired the signoria or lordship of the old communes. Their sphere of interest then often 
spread considerably beyond the original town and its surrounding district, forming a much more extensive territory. In practice, the change from commune to new 
signoria also signified the transformation of the first city-states into true and proper States, whose political force was therefore directly connected to their economic 
power. In this atmosphere of renewed vitality, culture also prospered with a new enthusiasm for the study of the classical world and a revaluation of interest in 
nature and man (humanism). The arts (from literature to the expressive and figurative) had one of their finest moments. The appearance of towns was transformed 
with the introduction of new styles of architecture. During this period Italy indeed became the cultural center of Europe. Among the great seigniorial families 
emerged the Este at Ferrara, Gonzaga at Mantua, Scaligeri at Verona, Malatesta at Rimini, Montefeltro at Urbino, Carraresi at Padua and Torriani at Milan. At 
Florence there survived, although with considerable difficulty (as the Ciompi Revolt of the woolworkers in 1378), the free republican institutions, and at Rome the 
absence of the papacy resulted in the brief, impossible, revolutionary dream of Cola di Rienzo (1347-54).</p>
<p>Among the young Italian signorie in the second half of the 14C, the most ambitious proved to be the Visconti, who had succeeded the Torriani in governing Milan 
(1350). Their founder, Gian Galeazzo, pursued a policy of expansion (not without the support of well-organized mercenary armies and their condottieri) throughout 
a large part of the Po Valley and even as far as Genoa, Umbria and Tuscany but came up against the firm resistance of the pope and Florence. On the death of 
Gian Galeazzo in 1402, the ambitions of the Duchy of Milan were reduced and Venice, having subdued the other Venetian signorie, succeeded in advancing as far 
as the banks of the Adda. In the meantime also the Florentine republic was drawing to an end. In 1382 the last corporations represented in the city's government 
were removed and an oligarchic regime installed that would later lead to the signoria of Cosimo de' Medici (1434). While several years later the king of Sicily, 
Alfonso d'Aragona, seized the throne of Naples (1442) and the Visconti of Milan were replaced by the Sforza (1448), after the brief interlude of the Repubblica 
Ambrosiana. A period of calm, in the agitated political panorama of Renaissance Italy, seemed to be heralded by the Peace of Lodi (1454). The great Italian states 
of Milan, Florence, Venice, Rome and Naples agreed to guarantee through the Lega Italica at least forty years of peace and stability.</p>
<h4><a name="spa_fra">SPANISH AND FRENCH INGERENCE</a></h4>
<p>The solemn intentions declared at the Peace of Lodi only lasted a short time. Scarcely ten years later the Sforzas took over Genoa (1464), which had become a 
pale reflection of the once glorious republic and the energetic rule of Simone Boccanegra (1339-63, with a gap between 1344 and 1356) and now gravitated 
towards French influence. Plots and disagreements underlined some of the best-established signorie, such as the Sforza and Medici, fostered by papal interests that 
in this period were characterized by the most blatant nepotism. Also in the Kingdom of Naples there occurred conspiracies among the barons, indicating a lack of 
capacity on the part of various Italian States, despite their now solid economic foundations, to provide a stable political and administrative structure. However, 
there were already worrying signs of a financial crisis in the bankruptcy of prestigious banking families, like the Bardi and Peruzzi, who were ruined by the 
insolvency of the sovereigns and princes to whom they had made loans. The whole system being threatened by seigniorial particularism. Consequently, the great 
European powers of the period (France, Spain and the German Empire) did not find it difficult to expand in Italy, often using dynastic claims as justification. Charles 
VIII of France descended into Italy to claim the throne of Naples (1494-95); his successor Louis XII was a pretender to the Duchy of Milan (1499); there was yet 
another Franco-Spanish contest over the division of the Kingdom of Naples, secretly agreed at Grenada (1500); cession of the Ticino to the Swiss Confederation 
(1503); and, finally, there was the French reconquest of Milan (1515) by the Valois Francis I and his subsequent agreement with the Spanish ruler Charles V, at the 
Peace of Noyon 1516, whereby Italy was to be divided into two spheres of influence, French in the north and Spanish in the south and the islands.</p>
<p>But the conflict between the king of France and Charles V, who had meanwhile also become emperor of Germany, was to last for some thirty years, until the death 
of Francis I in 1547. During this period Rome was sacked by the Lansquenet (1527) and Florence, after a brief republican period (1527-30), once more accepted 
the Medici dynasty. While in order to counteract the Protestant Reformation led by Martin Luther (1517), vainly excommunicated in 1521, Pope Paul III was 
forced to summon the Council of Trent (1544-63) in order to organize the Catholic response. With the Peace of Cateau-Cambr&eacute;sis 1559, between Henry II of 
France and Philip II of Spain, the predominance of Spain over Italy was confirmed. This was directly represented by the three kingdoms of Naples, Sicily and 
Sardinia (1503-1734) governed by a viceroy, by the Stato dei Presidi in Tuscany (1559-1714) and by the Duchy of Milan (1535-1714). The independence of the 
other States was only an appearance. The Duchy of Savoy, for example, was returned to Emanuele Filiberto, previously commander of the Spanish army against 
the French at St. Quentin (1557), but he had to accept the presence of Spanish and French garrisons. Only the Papal States and the Republic of Venice maintained 
full independence. The consequences of this new alignment, also on the cultural and economic level, were not slow to manifest themselves. Though the culture of the 
Italian Renaissance was to continue for some considerable time to influence the rest of Europe, nevertheless Italy gradually became marginal to the cultural, scientific 
and political movements of modern Europe. The latter benefited particularly, at least in the Germanic countries, from an increased freedom of thought consequent to 
the Protestant Reformation. States such as Portugal, Spain, England, the Low Countries and France, with the advent of voyages of exploration and above all the 
discovery of the Americas, saw a notable expansion in their economic influence. While the Mediterranean, and with it Italy, was slowly but surely cut out of the 
great international commercial trade routes. For the Italian economy this situation signaled the beginning of an inward-looking phase; however, it did produce the 
advantage of greater interest in the utilization of its land, with a consequent development in agriculture and an increase in rural population. There were exceptions 
though such as Genoa, which achieved a financial position of European importance, and Leghorn, which became an active center for English trade in the 
Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The French attempts to gain domination of Italy, so tenaciously pursued by the unfortunate Francis I, were limited at the Peace of Cateau-Cambr&eacute;sis (1559) to only 
the Marquisate of Saluzzo and the traditional influence on the Duchy of Savoy and the Republic of Genoa. Besides, new dynasties were establishing themselves in 
the peninsula, like the Farnese at Parma and Piacenza and the Gonzagas at Mantua and in Monferrato. However, it is also true that when it was necessary internal 
differences could be set aside in the common defense of European civilization: as with the historic defeat of the Turks in the waters of Lepanto (1571) by the Holy 
League, a coalition which included all the Italian States and Spain in defense of the threat to Christianity. The whole of the 17C saw little change in Italy's political 
and territorial alignment: the Papal States once more acquired Ferrara (1598) and Urbino (1631); Saluzzo passed to Savoy (1601); and the Grey Leagues in the 
Grisons kept the Valtellina (obtained in 1512) despite the bitter Catholic rebellion in 1620 against the local Protestants. Nevertheless, there were episodes such as 
the brief civil war in the Duchy of Savoy (1637-42), provoked by a question of inheritance, and the popular revolts in Naples (Masaniello) and Palermo 
(1647-49). The opening of the 18C was marked by important differences among the European powers, which increasingly involved, through rapidly changing 
alliances, the Italian States. The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-14) was concluded by the treaties of Utrecht (1713) and Rastatt (1714), resulting in Italian 
territorial changes: the kingdoms of Naples and Sardinia were given to Austria, together with the duchies of Mantua and Milan and the Stato dei Presidi, while Sicily 
went to Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy along with the title of king. A couple of years after, in 1718, Sicily was exchanged for Sardinia, thus creating the new title of 
the state of Savoy. The other two wars of succession fought in this period, the Polish (1733) and Austrian (1740), also had new political and territorial 
consequences for Italy. In 1734 Naples and Sicily were conquered by the Bourbon Charles III, who became king of Spain in 1759, and made some useful political 
reforms. In Florence, the Medici were replaced by Francis of Lorraine in 1737, husband of the empress Maria Teresa. At the same time the Savoy&#146;s Kingdom of 
Sardinia followed a policy of expansion, Milan being occupied by Carlo Emanuele III for a brief period (1733-38). The Bourbon dynasty in its turn obtained 
Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla (1748), while Genoa was forced to cede Corsica, which was constantly in revolt, to France in 1768. A certain stability finally 
seemed to follow the agreement of Aranjuez (1745) by which France, Spain and Naples guaranteed Italian territorial alignments. This was completed with the later 
Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748), ending the Austrian War of Succession, by which the House of Savoy obtained Vigevano and the Pavese Oltrep&ograve;. </p>
<h4><a name="illum">ILLUMINISM</a></h4>
<p>The next fifty years saw a period of relative political stability and economic progress for all the various Italian States. Judicial and administrative reforms were 
carried out, generally marked by increased efficiency in state structures. This was also due to the actions of statesmen and enlightened sovereigns like Maria Teresa 
of Austria and Joseph II in Lombardy, Bernardo Tanucci at Naples, Pietro Leopoldo in Tuscany and Pius VI at Rome. Following this brief but intense period came 
first the echo of the French Revolution (1789) and the tragic end of the French monarchy (1792) and then the resounding reality of the Napoleonic armies. The 
latter's first Italian Campaign (1796) carried with it the hope of an independent Italy before too long. Spanish predominance in Italy, extending over some two 
centuries, had rather negative consequences for the country, whose economy, especially in the rich northern and central regions underwent a disastrous decline. 
This brought in its train social and cultural repercussions. The imbalance between the southern regions and the rest of the country increased, above all in the 
agricultural sector. The south had mainly large feudal agricultural and pastoral estates and exported considerable quantities of traditional Mediterranean crops 
(cereals, wine and olive oil) and sheep products (wool and cheese) to the great urban areas of Central Italy and the Po Valley. The north, meanwhile, alongside its 
large-scale irrigation cultivation was developing the production of silk (with its main working and trading centers in Lombardy) and the characteristic landscape of 
mixed farming (especially in Tuscany, Umbria and Marche). Besides silk, which was very profitable, other industrial-type activities were prospering (even if in this 
period the production of the finished goods still had the character of a craft and an organization based on the medieval corporations), such as the weaving of wool 
and flax. The Alpine and Apennine forests provided the raw material for boat building, a particular specialty of Venice and Genoa. In addition, the pre-Alpine 
Lombard and Venetian regions had well-developed metallurgy, due to the presence of metal-bearing deposits that had been utilized since ancient times. Other 
important areas of production were the manufacturing of glass at Venice, paper at Fabriano and the continuing quarrying at Carrara of the splendid marble of the 
Apuan Alps. Also in the commercial sector the difference between the north and south of Italy was apparent in the active presence of merchants from Tuscany, 
Genoa and Venice in the Spanish viceroyalty where they had fondachi or permanent commercial bases. Moreover the Central and Northern regions were in 
constant contact with the rest of Europe through their own trading offices at Lyons, London, Antwerp and Genoa. The ports of Genoa, Naples, Messina, Leghorn 
and Venice were particularly active, the latter also being involved in Eastern Mediterranean trading.</p>
<p>The inflation provoked by the flow of precious metals from the New World through Spain also heavily involved Italy. It increased the division between the lower 
classes and the feudal nobility, while landownership now also became the only refuge of the trading middle-classes for their capital. The economic depression that 
characterized the period of Spanish domination was further aggravated by the heavy taxation imposed by the viceregal rulers to meet the financial demands of the 
state (weighed down by a muddled bureaucratic structure) and continuing military commitments. In addition, devastation was caused by continued contests among 
the great European States, who found in Italy their favorite battlefield, and recurrent epidemics of plague (as that in 1630 which overran Milan and Venice or that of 
1656 which struck Naples). The result was a dramatic drop in population, not only in the rural areas of both the south and north but also greatly reducing numbers 
in the large urban centers. Consequently, at the beginning of the 18C the population of Italy probably amounted to some 14 million inhabitants, being almost 
equivalent to that of a century earlier. The drop in investment returns and economic activities resulted in the utilization of capital that had previously been 
accumulated and the construction of elaborate religious and civil buildings. When after the Peace of the Pyrenees, however, Italy knew a period of relative peace 
the various States of the peninsula were no longer capable of competing with the developed economies of the great European nations, who had succeeded in 
monopolizing trade and industry. Consequently at the opening of the 18C when the Spanish presence was declining in favor of Austria and the Bourbons, Italy was 
heavily agricultural but dotted with medium and small towns that had kept, if not increased, their urban characteristics.</p>
<p>Italy's political and economic difficulties during this period did not always have a reflection at the cultural level. Following the revival of classical studies with 
humanism and the splendid flowering of the Renaissance, which had made Italy the cultural center of Europe, there was a further development in literature, the 
figurative arts and architecture. The stimulus for this new phase came from the ideology behind the Council of Trent and the general atmosphere of the 
Counter-Reformation. The magnificence of the resulting Baroque period and its expressive liberty was to last well into the 18C. Also in the fields of science and 
philosophy Italy was to make fundamental contributions, as through the renewal of research utilizing experimental methods as exemplified by Galileo and the daring 
philosophical theories of Campanella. Nevertheless, Italy had to concede to France cultural leadership. A contribution that was to play a significant role in the 
political and philosophical debate leading to the revolutionary spirit of the 18C. Earlier, however, and again from France, there had spread throughout Europe, of 
course including Italy, the new spirit of Enlightenment. This was a reaction against the restrictions imposed by tradition and religious faith, revaluing the human 
intellectual capacity and individual conscience in its ability to confront and resolve the great issues of humanity and its destiny through the use of reason alone. 
Favored also by the renewal of economic and civil life through a series of reforms stemming from the tolerant and enlightened rulers of the period, Italy made her 
main contribution in this field at Milan and Naples by the actions of statesmen and economists of the caliber of Beccaria, Verri, Romagnosi, Galiani, Genovesi, 
Pagano and Filangieri.</p>
<p>Reforming activities were however abruptly interrupted by the events of the French Revolution, bringing into question the very concepts of State and Society under 
the pressure of the new Jacobinism. In the social sphere, the middle-class was to assert its indispensable economic importance, forced by a proletariat that was still 
uncertain in its objectives. At the same time, especially in Northern and Central Italy, an expansion in agriculture was under way due to the development of firms 
with an increased capital base and commercial outlets on the European markets (silk, products from timber cultivation etc.). Profits from agriculture accumulated by 
the upper and middle-classes were directed into the Industrial Revolution that was already renewing the economy of all northwestern Europe. Meanwhile Southern 
Italy, which had already registered the first signs of industrialization due to the farsightedness of the Bourbon dynasty, still retained an agriculture based on large 
estates (latifundia) that were nevertheless able to meet the needs of a population increased to over 5 million inhabitants. </p>
<p>The Italian political and territorial picture, which at the end of the 18C seemed to have stabilized, rapidly disintegrated in the face of Napoleon Bonaparte's first 
military campaign across the peninsula so as to successfully attack the Austrian Empire on its southern flank. After the Peace of Paris (16 May 1796) reached with 
the neighboring kingdom of Savoy, that of Campoformio (17 October 1797) marked the end of the now enfeebled Republic of Venice. The latter was exchanged 
with Austria for the Duchy of Milan, which went to form the Repubblica Transpadana (November 1796). With Napoleon's entry into Italy there came also the new 
ideas of liberty diffused from the French Revolution and these had an immediate effect. After the French occupation of the territory of the Papal Legations in 1796, 
in August of the same year the ducal government of Reggio (Emilia) was overthrown and in the following December the Repubblica Cispadana was proclaimed. 
This latter included the rest of Emilia and adopted for the first time a flag with the present-day white, red and green colors. On 29 June 1797 the two republics 
were joined in the new Repubblica Cisalpina and towards the end of the year the Repubblica Ligure was formed. At the beginning of 1798 the rest of the Papal 
States were occupied and turned into the Repubblica Romana, while the pope had to seek refuge in Tuscany. The next year (in January 1799) it was the turn of 
Naples, where a group of intellectuals and aristocrats formed the Repubblica Partenopea, while King Ferdinando IV had to flee to Sicily. A republican government 
was then also established in Tuscany. But the dream of liberty seemed of brief duration. The absence of Napoleon, on the Egyptian Campaign (1798-99), favored 
a coalition of the great European States allied with the Russian czar and the English monarchy. As quickly as it had arrived the French army was forced to withdraw 
from the peninsula leaving the way open to the restoration that was to be particularly violent at Naples (June 1799).</p>
<p>The Second Italian Campaign began with the resounding victory of Marengo (14 June 1800) and ended with the Peace of Luneville (9 February 1801) whereby 
France regained control over Italy. The republican ideals having been replaced by Napoleon's dynastic aspirations, the Repubblica Italiana, direct heir of the 
Cisalpina with the addition of the Venetian domain, was established on 28 December 1805 and then transformed into the Kingdom of Italy on 31 March 1805. The 
pope's authority over part of his territories was re-established; the Grand Duchy of Tuscany was transformed into the Kingdom of Etruria; the territories of 
Piombino, Lucca, Massa and Carrara were assigned as a duchy to Napoleon's sister Eloise; the Kingdom of Naples was given (30 March 1806) his brother 
Joseph; and only Sardinia and Sicily remained for the Savoys and Bourbons. Successive events further reinforced Napoleon's control of Italy. His brother-in-law 
Murat ascended the throne of Naples; the Kingdom of Italy was expanded with the Trentino and Alto Adige (the latter fiercely defended by Andreas Hofer); and 
Tuscany and the Papal States were incorporated in the new French Empire (Peace of Sch&ouml;nbrunn, 14 October 1810). But after a brief interlude, the failure of 
Napoleon's Russian Campaign and his defeats at Leipzig (1813) and Waterloo (1815), as well as Murat's tragic end (October 1815), brought back to Italy the 
restoration of the old political and territorial order under the terms of the Congress of Vienna (June 1815).</p>
<h4><a name="monarc">THE MONARCHY</a></h4>
<p>But the seeds of liberty and change had been sown in Italy above all with the First Napoleonic Campaign and a sense of national unity had been aroused by the 
establishment of first republican structures and then the Kingdom of Italy. These, united to the administrative and judicial reforms extended from France into Italy 
(especially the introduction of the Code Napol&eacute;on), began to take root despite the restoration. Support came from the intellectual and middle-classes in all the 
Italian States and from numerous patriotic associations, often working in secret (as the `Young Italy', of Giuseppe Mazzini) but profoundly influencing society. The 
demand for freer and more democratic institutions, the frequency of episodes of insurrection stretching from Piedmont to Sicily but above all the concession of the 
Spanish constitution forced the Italian rulers (from Carlo Alberto to Leopoldo II and from Ferdinando II to Pius IX) to follow suit also during 1848. A year that 
was rich in events and innovations not only for Italy but also for the rest of Europe with the revolutions in Paris and Vienna. Encouraged by the uprisings of Milan 
and Venice, the king of Sardinia Carlo Alberto intervened in 1848 against Austria with the help of volunteers from various parts of Italy and the regular armies of 
the pope and Naples. But the sudden defection of the latter two destroyed at birth what had seemed an aspiration already realized. A second attempt by the same 
Carlo Alberto failed the following year at Novara and he was forced to abdicate in favor of Vittorio Emanuele II. Meanwhile Rome was living with Mazzini and 
Giuseppe Garibaldi a short republican season, like Tuscany, Sicily and Venice, before the French and Austrian troops intervened to restore the deposed rulers who 
reacted by revoking the constitutions conceded the previous year.</p>
<h4><a name="unif">THE UNIFICATION OF ITALY</a></h4>
<p>The following decade coincides with the presence of Count Camillo Benso Cavour in the government of Piedmont and his able and patient pursue of a policy that 
succeeded in inserting the small State of Savoy within the schemes and alliances of the great European powers, as well as ensuring the friendship of neighboring 
France. Results were not slow in arriving. At the Congress of Paris (1856) concluding the Crimean War, fought by the army of Piedmont in a coalition with France 
and England against Russia and Turkey (in the Battle of the Cernaia the new corps of the Bersaglieri, founded by General La Marmora, distinguished itself), Cavour 
managed to raise the Italian question although without obtaining immediate territorial advantages. These were to come three years later in 1859. Following the 
speech from the throne at the beginning of the year by Vittorio Emanuele II on the support of Piedmont for Italians with nationalistic aspirations, Austria, having 
failed in her request for the disarmament of Piedmont, declared war on the Kingdom of Sardinia. This was the occasion for which Cavour had long waited. The 
intervention of France under Napoleon III with the bloody victories of Solferino and San Martino forced Austria to the armistice of Villafranca and the cession of 
Lombardy. At the same time all Central Italy and Romagna rebelled, overturning the old regimes. Following the plebiscite that voted in favor of annexation to 
Piedmont (1860), there then began the construction, together with the territory of Southern Italy that had been taken by Garibaldi's expedition of `The Thousand', 
of the United Kingdom of Italy. This was to be proclaimed at Turin on 17 March 1861, though the acquisition of Rome and Venice were still outstanding. The latter 
was added five years later (1866) following an unfortunate conflict with Austria, which was resolved in Italy's favor thanks to the intervention of Prussia; Rome was 
conquered by force, 20 September 1870, on the fall of Napoleon III. With these events the territorial unity of the Italian nation was almost complete and it was 
now necessary to construct its own social, economic and cultural image.</p>
<h4><a name="colon">THE COLONIES</a></h4>
<p>Among the numerous and complex problems of the new State emerged the need to bring uniformity to a territory that was so politically and economically diverse. 
The indiscriminate application of the administrative, judicial and fiscal structures of the old Piedmont was to create a further divide between Italy's more 
economically developed Northern and Central regions and the structurally weaker Southern region (the Mezzogiorno). A mass emigration of peasants and the 
poorest classes to the two Americas occurred (in the decades spanning the 19-20C the number reached several million) and the so-called southern question took 
root. At the same time, in order to compete with the other European powers, Italy followed a policy of colonial expansion in Africa. She occupied Eritrea 
(1885-96), Somalia (1889-1905), Libya and the islands of the Aegean (1911-12). A commercial concession (500 sq miles) centered on Tien-Tsin was obtained 
from China in 1902. In the economic and social areas the period from the taking of Rome to Italy entering the First World War (1870-1915) was characterized by 
general growth in the whole country. This was undoubtedly favored by an interlude in international politics that allowed Italy to put her financial affairs in order and 
re-organize her administrative structure. There then followed the development of certain essential sectors, such as the rail network and basic industries, often 
making use of foreign capital. At the same time, attempts were made to strengthen international political relations (by joining in the Triple Alliance with the Germany 
of Bismarck and the Austria of Franz Joseph) and commercial links, even if it was eventually necessary to resort to protectionism in order to protect the still fragile 
national economy. While agriculture encountered notable difficulties due to the fall in prices on foreign markets and the backward conditions of a large part of the 
countryside, as well as the scourge of malaria, industry was a growth area. The textile industry, with its two main sectors of silk and cotton, as well as the 
metallurgical and mechanical industries were favored by increasing supplies of electrical energy from the newly built water-powered plants in the upper Alpine and 
Apennine valleys.</p>
<h4><a name="soth_ita">THE PROBLEM OF SOUTHERN ITALY</a></h4>
<p>The country's social conditions were marked by a strong contrast between rural and urban environments. The south saw frequent protests by the peasants over the 
burden of taxation (such as the notorious milling tax), while the industrial proletariat gradually organized itself into political associations and trade unions. From the 
latter there arose in 1892 the foundation of the Partito Socialista, partly drawn from anarchic and equalitarian movements, and then in 1896 the Democrazia 
Cristiana party was established, inspired by the principles in the `Rerum novarum' of Leo XIII published in 1891. The participation of the outstanding 
representatives of these movements to parliamentary activities greatly enlivened political debate, which had been limited in the first decades of national unity to the 
differences between the deputies of the old right monarchists and liberals and the left republicans and reformists.</p>
<h3><a name="frst_war">THE FIRST WORLD WAR</a></h3>
<p>The direct participation of the masses in national political life occurred in 1913 with the introduction of universal suffrage, although women were still excluded. 
Consequently, on the eve of the First World War (1914-18) Italy appeared on the international scene as a country that was more socially uniform, freer in its 
choices (which then swayed, often with passionate dispute, between interventionism and pacifism) and altogether more modern in its organization than immediately 
after its unification. The cooling of relations with Austria and the renewal of Irredentist designs on the Trentino and Venezia Giulia lead to a reversal of Italy's 
traditional European alliances and she fought on the side of the Allies, together with France and England. The outcome of the war, which also saw the presence of 
the United States of America, despite the grave crisis of Caporetto (November 1917), was in Italy's favor. At the Conference of Versailles (1919) Italy received 
the Trentino, Alto Adige, Venezia Giulia and the Dodecanese, while being refused Fiume and Dalmatia. A reaction to this followed with the occupation of Fiume 
(1919-20) by the legionaries of Gabriele D'Annunzio. In the context of the grave political crisis following the war, from which Italy had emerged victorious but 
economically ruined due to her efforts, the country underwent a series of political and social agitations that the weak government of the period was unable to 
control. One remnant of the war was however resolved with the Treaty of Rapallo (1920) by which Dalmatia, with the exception of Zadar, went to the new State 
of Yugoslavia, formed from the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Italy's possession of Istria was confirmed. Fiume was also declared a free town but 
was annexed by Italy only three years later with a specific agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia. In this period were founded a number of political parties; 
Partito Popolare (1919), by Luigi Sturzo, as a continuation of the Democrazia Cristiana; Partito Comunista d'Italia (1921, at Leghorn), from a split with the Partito 
Socialista and led by Antonio Gramsci; and, finally, the Fasci di Combattimento of Benito Mussolini, previously a socialist leader and an ardent interventionist. This 
latter movement, after having obtained 35 deputies in the 1921 election, transformed itself into the Partito Nazionale Fascista equipped with a revolutionary 
program that, after the episode of the March on Rome of 28 October 1922, brought Mussolini to the head of a government. </p>
<h4><a name="fasc">FASCISM</a></h4>
<p>Having obtained a parliamentary majority in the 1924 election and the following year passed a law increasing the powers of the head of government, it was in 1926, 
with the abolition of all the other political parties, that the Fascist dictatorship formally began. By such means Mussolini, both on the national and international level, 
was able to expand without any further formal hindrance. In 1929 following the Concordato with the Catholic Church, he also managed to gain the support or at 
least not the hostility of the Church itself an through this the Catholic masses, which were equivalent to the majority of Italians. Such consensus increased also 
because of an undoubted improvement in the country's economic condition and a policy of social reform involving the poorest classes. The continuation of land 
reclamation, already begun in the previous century even before the unification, increased the amount of land under cultivation with a satisfactory level of basic 
provisions. Examples of these initiatives can be found in the `grain battle' and the draining of the agro pontino, which produced an entirely new piece of territory. At 
the same time, industry was being brought up to date and developed, especially after the world economic crisis of 1929. The Istituto Mobiliare Italiano was created 
in 1931 to provide credit for industry and the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (1933) began the era of public intervention in large-scale industrial reform.<br>
In its external policy the Fascist regime especially sought prestige by further colonial expansion, as that into Ethiopia (1935-36) or participation in the Spanish Civil 
War on the side of Franco's forces. Gradually, Italy's good relations with France, Britain and the Soviet Union (whose revolutionary government Italy was the first 
country to recognize) deteriorated, while her links with Hitler's Germany increased (Rome-Berlin Axis, 1936). In 1939 the Pact of Steel with Germany, after an 
initially non-belligerent phase, inevitably dragged Italy, in 1940, into the tragic events of the Second World War (1939-45). Italy's increasingly unsuccessful war, 
fought on many fronts and against better trained and equipped armies, overwhelmed Mussolini in 1943, when he was censured by his own party. He was replaced 
as head of government by the Marshall Pietro Badoglio, who immediately signed an armistice with the allied powers (3 September 1943). The formation of a new 
government by Mussolini in Northern Italy, the Repubblica Sociale Italiana based at Sal&ograve;, with the support of Germany and in opposition to the monarchical 
government (temporarily based at Brindisi) provoked a civil war. This was only brought to an end by the intervention of the allied armies, the formation of the 
partisans, the abdication of the king and the end of Mussolini (28 April-2 May 1945). After an interlude with several national coalition governments and the 
provisional rule of Umberto II of Savoy, Alcide De Gasperi of the Democrazia Cristiana became President of the Council. On 2 June 1946 the results of the 
institutional referendum brought to an end the monarchy of the House of Savoy (its last king, Umberto II, going into exile) and heralded the republic which was 
officially proclaimed on 18 June 1946. Enrico De Nicola was elected as the Republic's first President. Under the government led by De Gasperi, the first 
parliamentary assembly to be freely elected by the people began work on the new Constitutional Charter that was to come into force on 1 January 1948.</p>
<h4><a name="post_war">POSTWAR RECONSTRUCTION</a></h4>
<p>Coming out of the Second World War completely ruined and crippled by the severe territorial restrictions imposed by the peace treaty (Paris, 1 February 1947), 
the new Italian Republic had to face the many problems of material and moral reconstruction. It did this with an impressive effort that in the space of a few years 
produced extraordinary results. Thanks were also due to the massive aid given by the United States through the Marshall Plan and made available to the other 
European countries, Germany included, that had been so heavily damaged in the conflict. A policy of reconstruction and economic development was followed by 
the various governments in power after 1948, the year in which the party of the Democrazia Cristiana acquired a large parliamentary majority. Initially this took the 
form of severe anti-inflation measures and then a lifting of restrictions combined with public intervention through a re-launching of the Institute for the Reconstruction 
of Industry (the Senigallia Plan for the development of the iron and steel industry). The establishment of the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno (funds for the development of 
Southern Italy) set in motion a complex series of extraordinary interventions to provide the southern regions with the necessary basic structures (roads, drainage, 
services etc.) to assist in economic and above all agricultural development. Agrarian reform was particularly necessary in combating the centuries-old land based 
states of the South. Nevertheless a new and even greater migration occurred, this time not overseas but towards the countries of northwestern Europe (Germany, 
France, Belgium, England, Switzerland etc.), where the post-war industrial boom required large quantities of manpower. However, the movement of population 
towards the north of Italy (Piedmont, Lombardy and Liguria) was even greater, due to the efforts of private initiative in creating an industrialized climate, whose 
rapid and often disorderly growth created talk of an `economic miracle'. This was borne witness to by the large increase in national income and a profound and 
radical transformation in the country's social and economic structure. Even at the beginning of the 1960s, the majority of the working force was employed in the 
industrial sector, while agriculture continued to diminish and the service industries began their expansion. In the international sphere, with her entry to the United 
Nations and participation in military alliances and economic agreements with the other western countries (European and North American), Italy began to regain the 
dignity and prestige due to her geographical position and the richness of her historical and cultural traditions.</p>
<h4><a name="rec_year">DEVELOPMENTS AND PROBLEMS IN RECENT YEARS</a></h4>
<p>To the centrist governments led by the Christian Democrats from the advent of the Republic, there followed at the beginning of the 1960s coalitions that were 
increasingly open to collaboration with the parties of the left. In particular with the Socialist Party after it had gradually loosened its close ties with the Communist 
Party. After the nationalization of the electrical industry in 1962 the socialists became part of the government. Meanwhile, the policies of social reform combined 
with the imposition of taxation on investment returns and ground for building required to finance the provision of public housing, implemented by the governments 
presided over by Amintore Fanfani, provoked a loss of confidence. There was a general uncertainty on the national political scene in the face of a fundamental 
choice in economic policy, leading to a fall in investments and a critical contraction in share dealings. Thus came to an end in 1963-64 the long period of national 
economic growth that had carried Italy into the group of most industrialized nations. Following this crisis, there occurred a new phase of economic expansion 
(1966-69), though at a slower rate. An economic plan was drawn up containing territorial implications requiring the institution of regions with autonomous powers 
of administration, legislation and management. In particular, special autonomous status, which was already in force, was conferred on the five peripheral regions of 
Valle d'Aosta, Trentino-Alto Adige, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Sardinia and Sicily. From 1968, in line with protest movements in other European countries such as 
France and Germany and while, especially among the young, there was a growth in emotional participation condemning violent local conflicts in the 
under-developed regions of the third world, Italy also began to be involved in student and trade union agitation (1968-69). These increased in frequency and 
unfortunately produced episodes of collective violence. </p>
<p>They did however obtain considerable standard and economic concessions that all too soon reflected negatively on a national economy that was already weakened 
by a high level of consumption and a consequent imbalance in international trade. Thus, when in 1973 there was the energy crisis (provoked by yet another 
Arab-Israel conflict) that threw the world economy into confusion, Italy found herself in a particularly difficult situation. She was forced to absorb the grave 
consequences of a rate of inflation that even reached 20% per annum, while the numbers of unemployed grew to over two million, due to drastic cut-backs and 
failure of the weakest firms. The country's situation was aggravated considerably by the phenomenon of political and ideological terrorism, which was often allied 
with organized crime (the assassination of the Christian Democrat statesman Aldo Moro in 1978 formed the most significant episode). Finally, during the first half of 
the 1980s there were national coalition governments (supported by the parties of the &quot;constitutional arc&quot;) who weathered the political emergency and applied severe 
measures of economic austerity to contain consumption. The last of these governments being headed for the first time by members of the `lay' parties such as the 
republican Spadolini and the socialist Craxi. The national economic situation has registered a net improvement, with inflation falling to acceptable levels, a growth in 
investments (favored by a reduction in trade union conflicts) and an improvement in the value of the lire, all within a climate of renewed faith in the capacity of the 
whole nation to develop. &#160;</p>

<hr>
<p>Rome is a city, in essence &quot;the&quot; city, but it can also be considered a vice &#151; actually, one of the most violent vices in the world. Once a man has, for some time, 
been exposed to its mellow beauty, the handsomeness of its women, the caustical wisdom of its people, the lazy rhythm of its life, its hearty food, its below standard 
but somehow acceptable wines, he may not realize it, but he is no longer the same person. He will manage to come back for more and more of the same, more and 
more often, confident he can stop coming any time he wants to. One fatal day he discovers he cannot get away and live happily anywhere else. He has become an 
incurable addict. There have been and still will be thousands of such cases with countless transplanted residents especially from the foggy North of Europe. Many 
will even resent the chains bounding them to the city. Some complain endlessly, the streets are dirty, shopkeepers will always try to cheat them, nobody can be 
trusted, traffic is chaotic with drivers carelessly pass red lights all the time and enter one-way streets against the traffic, mail is always days or weeks late, trains are 
never on time, nobody is ever punctual: but these are the same lamentations we read in the Latin Poet Horace, and are as old as Rome itself. To complain is one of 
the pleasures of life here, and all believe that Rome was at its best 20, 30, 40 years before &#151; as some husbands might be repelled by a nagging wife, but still recall 
with tenderness the splendidly radiant girl he became engaged to.</p>
<p>What is this magic? There are several answers, all of them true, all evident and yet none of them sufficient, none entirely convincing: the incredible wealth of art, 
some say, 2000 years of it, from Greek and Roman sculpture to the Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical masterpieces; the architecture, say others, not only the 
famous basilicas, the stately Palazzi, the Castel Sant&#146;Angelo, the great and little churches, but also the anonymous houses of the anonymous people, hidden away in 
the more ancient quarters, and everywhere, the travertine stone which ennobles anything, a stone post, a stone curb or mailbox; history, say others still, the history 
which belongs to all men and not Romans alone. To be sure, everything in Rome, every stone, piazza, street, crooked alley, every ruin, monument, fountain, statue, 
gate, garden has a story behind it, sometimes many stories, but also a wealth of legends. There is no denying that an art lover or a conscientious sightseer could 
dedicate all his life to his passion or curse. There are in Rome some of the most renowned museums of the world, packed with famous works, each of which 
deserves hours of observation and quiet meditation.</p>
<p>There is the Vatican, the Pope&#146;s residence, which nobody can boast of having entirely explored. It is a labyrinth of courtyards, gardens, corridors, stairs, halls, 
chapels, most of them frescoed and decorated by great or nearly great masters. There is St. Peter&#146;s. There are the private Palazzi, each with its centuries-old 
collection of paintings and sculptures, which can be visited by applying for permission. There are almost 400 churches and chapels. There are also several hundred 
miles of underground catacombs already explored, and who knows how many more unexplored. And there are books galore to read. Everything one sees should 
be fitted in its proper historical background - remote, ancient and less ancient - surrounded by the names of the right emperors, Popes and artists. A lifetime is 
evidently not enough to master it all.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="colos">The Colosseum</a></h2>
<p>A hollow hill of travertine that covers six acres of ground at the lower end of the Ancient Forum. The exterior consists of awesomely massive arches, darkly lifting 
157 feet up into the tender blue sky. The interior, 1790 feet around, is a vast crumbling ellipse of masonry, its floor criss-crossed with excavations like open 
wounds. The brickwork laid over the travertine foundations is the color of sunbaked earth, and it in turn supports a multitude of forlorn marble fragments, like dirty 
snow. I felt as if I were in a crater, a dead Vesuvius or Etna. For there had been eruptions, human ones, in the Colosseum of yore. Whole groups of tourists seem 
to be swallowed and made almost to disappear in the vastness of the Colosseum. Goethe noted that the place is &quot;...so huge that the mind cannot retain its 
image....so that every time one returns to it one is again astounded by its size&quot;.</p>
<p>Begun by Emperor Vespasian in 72 AD, the Colosseum was completed in 80 AD by his son Titus with the forced assistance of 12000 Jewish captives. Legend 
credits the Colosseum&#146;s design to a Christian named Gaudentius. Titus dedicated the Colosseum with a stupendous show that involved battles between dwarfs and 
cranes, individual battles between male and female gladiators, struggles with no less that 5000 wild beasts, and finally the flooding of the arena for a naval 
engagement between war galleys. Emperor Hadrian, in his turn, had the arena planted to resemble a jungle, with every shrub and tree concealing a trapdoor, 
beneath which lay a lion or lioness ready to spring up and do battle with gladiator-huntsmen. Emperor Commodus himself fought with wild beasts and human 
gladiators alike in the Colosseum. He wore a lion skin on such occasions in imitation of Hercules, and had his hair sprinkled with gold dust to represent divine 
inspiration. Gladiator combat continued to be the chief entertainment at the Colosseum until 403; that is to say, even after the triumph of Christianity. The heroism of 
an Asian monk named Telemachus finally put a stop to it. Leaping the barrier and rushing in among the gladiators, Telemachus loudly implored the crowd to 
renounce such cruel performances. He was stoned to death on the spot. However, a general revulsion set in immediately afterward, and the protest of Telemachus 
posthumously carried the day. The Colosseum stood quite whole until the 8th Century.</p>
<p>For the next 500 years, it was a fortress subject to the many vicissitudes of war. During the early Renaissance, bullfights were held in the Colosseum. It also served 
as a sometime hospital. And according to Benvenuto Cellini&#146;s account, it was a necromancer&#146;s lair. But its precipitous decline began when Cardinal Farnese 
received permission from his uncle, Pope Paul III, to quarry the Colosseum&#146;s stones to build his own palace. The Papal grant allowed the Cardinal to remove as 
much material as he could in 12 hours. Farnese loosed 4000 workmen; he got away with many a ton, and other builders followed his lead. Not only the Palazzo 
Farnese but other Palaces, such as the Barberini, Venezia and Cancelleria were built of Colosseum travertine. Pope Sixtus V established a textile factory in the 
plundered monument. Clement XI turned it to the manufacture of saltpeter. He finally consecrated the arena to the memory of the martyrs, and erected a chapel in 
one of the archways. The hermit in charge of the chapel was stabbed to death, whereupon Benedict XIV had the Colosseum gated and barred in 1742. And it still 
is so today.</p>

<h2><a name="capit">The Capitol</a></h2>
<p>The CAMPIDOGLIO (Capitol Hill) is the smallest and steepest of the legendary hills of Rome. It has the Forum at its back, the Piazza Venezia on its right-hand 
flank, a medieval church on its right shoulder, and a contrasting pair of grand stone staircases aslant its front. One broad flight rises to the church, the other to the 
small, incredibly elegant piazza that Michelangelo designed for the saddle of the hill. The Italian name stems from the Latin &quot;Capitolium&quot;, meaning the &quot;head of 
Tollius&quot;. and this has its own tale... Shortly before 525 BC, when the foundations were being laid for the Temple of Jupiter atop this hill, workmen turned up a 
perfectly preserved head that, the augurs said, belonged to a hero of the dim past whose name was Tollius. The omen was regarded as excellent: tt signified that 
Rome itself would be preserved for century after century, as head of all nations. </p>
<p>The Piazza Venezia side of the Campidoglio is burdened with a pretentious Victorian memorial to King Victor Emanuel II. By circling to the right, around this 
&quot;wedding cake&quot; (As the Romans call the monument, not without sarcasm), you first reach the ruins of an apartment house built at the time of Christ. Beyond this 
tottery relic, a broad 14th Century staircase leads up to the medieval Church of S. Maria of Aracoeli, built on the ancient temple of Juno Moneta. The shrine 
housed the Roman mint; it&#146;s the source of our word money. To the right of the church steps, a second flight rises at a shallower angle to the small piazza in the 
saddle of the hill. The imposing staircase, the piazza itself, and the facades of the buildings that flank the piazza on three sides were all designed by Michelangelo. 
This High-Renaissance architectural ensemble strikes us as beyond praise. The ancient equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius that used to stand at its center has been 
removed for restoration, exposing the full flower of Michelangelo&#146;s black and white pavement design. The Campidoglio is still Rome&#146;s Capitol; the Senator&#146;s 
Palace on the piazza is still a municipal administration center and the two palaces at the sides are now museums, not to be passed by. In one, the Palazzo dei 
Conservatori, you&#146;ll be startled to confront a snarling bronze she-wolf (5th Century BC) suckling the twins Romulus and Remus, which Antonio Pollaiuolo added in 
the 16th Century. The other, the Capitoline Museum, contains the 84 bust Hall of the Emperors, perhaps the most intriguing portrait gallery in the world.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="forum">The Roman Forum</a></h2>
<p>The ROMAN FORUM is the magnificent complex just a short stroll from the Campidoglio. Passing to the left of the Senator&#146;s Palace, you&#146;ll find and incline that 
leads steeply down and then around the edge of the Roman Forum to its entrance gate. But first, stop on the stairs for an overview: the narrow vale below, with its 
islands of broken marble, its gleaming arches and columns, seems a deep lake of history. And you are indeed standing right over the massive &quot;tufa Tabularium&quot;, 
where the state archives, including the bronze Tablets of the Roman Law, were stored for a thousand years or more, upon which rests the Senator&#146;s Palace itself. </p>
<p>First, notice the triumphal arches that stand like bookends at the extremities of the Via Sacra (Sacred Way), down to the Forum&#146;s center. The near one is the Arch 
of Septimius Severus, built in 203 AD to honor his victories over the Arabs and the Parthians. Its bas-relief show his captives in floppy Phrygian caps, which have 
been a sartorial badge of the resistance fighter from that day to this. The distant arch, erected in 81 AD commemorates the conquest of Jerusalem 11 years earlier 
by Titus, and its best known bas-relief depicts the troops of Titus carrying off the seven-branched candelabrum from the inner sanctuary of Herod&#146;s Temple. That 
sacred spoil stayed here until 455, when marauding Vandals carried it off to Carthage. The Byzantine general Belisarius captured it from the Vandals for his 
emperor, Justinian I, who ceremoniously restored it at long last to Jerusalem. There it remained till the Persian sack of 614....so swing the centuries-wide whirlwinds 
of war. Now let your eye caress the various standing columns. The nearest belonged to Vespasian&#146;s temple. The splendid row standing almost at right angles to 
them formed the portico of the temple of Saturn. The three columns in the middle distance mark the Temple of Castor and Pollux, twin deities who were believed to 
have succored the city at the battle of Lake Regillus.</p>
<p>Appropriately enough, the Temple of Vesta lies just beyond that of the twins. Here the Vestal Virgins presided in quietude, sheltering and nurturing an eternal flame. 
Finally, glance along the grand structures lining the Forum to your left. First comes the 17th Century Church of St. Luca and St. Martina, which stands on what was 
once the &quot;Comitium&quot;, or open-air assembly point, for citizens of Rome. The Baroque elegance of the church makes a striking contrast with the ancient building just 
beyond. This was the Senate House, begun by Julius Caesar in 44 BC. Still farther on, you see the lofty pagan portico of the church of S. Lorenzo in Miranda. Like 
a new plant in an old pot, this church grew inside a temple dedicated to the emperor Antoninus and his wife, Faustina. Christianity had at last conquered Rome from 
within.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="palat">The Palatine</a></h2>
<p>The PALATINE is nothing but a small hill honey-combed with vast brick cellar ruins and strung with the most pleasant garden walks imaginable, but its historic 
associations and incomparable views will cap and climax your Forum wanderings. Reach it from the Forum itself, passing the arch of Titus and climbing the narrow 
street angling uphill to the right. The hill was home to a shepherd tribe as early as the 10th C BC. Virgil tells us that this is where the shepherd king Evander 
welcomed Aeneas of Troy. Here, according to the legend, the she-wolf suckled Romulus and Remus. Later on the breezy knob was home to the aristocracy of 
Republican Rome. Here Cicero has his house, and Caesar Augustus was born. Succeeding Emperors erected massive, multi-story substructures along the flanks of 
the hill and topped them off with ever more resplendent palaces.</p>
<p>In fact our word &quot;Palace&quot; stems from the word Palatine...... Emperor&#146;s Nero Domus Aurea &quot;Golden House&quot;, the most pretentious palace ever built, incorporated 
the entire area. For convenience in consulting his Divine Ancestors, Caligula built a bridge from the Palatine&#146;s northern corner right over the Forum to the Temple of 
Jupiter on the Capitol, completing a scene of fairytale splendor and menace. And, as in a fairytale, all of that vanished. As we now see. We know that King 
Theodoric the Great lived here in the 5th Century, and that the Byzantine governor Narses made this his home as late as 570. From that time on, the Palatine 
crumbled to loam, in which lofty umbrella pines take root.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="pant">The Pantheon</a></h2>
<p>The PANTHEON nestles in the midst of a warren of winding little streets about halfway between the Corso and the Piazza Navona, in Rome&#146;s old central quarter. 
Externally, its gray, forbidding bulk seems oppressive at close quarters, like some perfectly immense tortoise stuck in a maze. The bricked excavation trench around 
part of its base is home to scores of stray cats. The severe portico is borne by 16 smooth unfluted columns, each more that 14 feet around and 41 feet high. The 
massive bronze entrance doors are the originals, believe it or not, and although the interior stands stripped of most ancient adornments, it is structurally intact.</p>
<p>The Pantheon is the best preserved, in fact, of all great Classical monuments. Admiral Agrippa, who defeated Anthony and Cleopatra at Actium, dedicated the 
Pantheon in 27 BC. Its seven interior niches were apparently designed for the seven planetary deities, Apollo, Diana, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, who 
also ruled over the days of the week, maintaining total control of the space-time continuum. In short, the Pantheon was built to incorporate late-pagan faith at its 
most philosophical beliefs. The soaring dome expresses that function miraculously well. The dome&#146;s diameter is precisely the same as its interior height: 142 feet. At 
its apex there is a bronze- lipped circular aperture 30 feet across, wide open to the weather and also to the changing angles of light ordained from hour to hour by 
the circlings of the sun and moon overhead. </p>
<p>Struck by lightning in the time of Trajan, the Pantheon was extensively restored by Hadrian shortly after 110 AD. Pope Boniface IV reconsacrated the still perfect 
structure on March 6, 609 as the Church of St. Mary of the Martyrs. Italian kings and queens are interred here, with monuments where statues of the gods once 
stood. So too is Raphael, the prince of Renaissance painters.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="angel">Castel Sant&#146;Angelo</a></h2>
<p>The CASTLE OF THE HOLY ANGEL, as CASTEL SANT&#146;ANGELO is called, resembles the broken base of a giant goblet. Its immense round mass of stone 
dominates the Tiber river&#146;s mid-city bend. This forbidding fortress was once a marble-faced mausoleum, far larger than the present structure, which Emperor 
Hadrian had built for himself and succeeding Caesars. There were ranks of colossal statues a sky-hung grove of hemlock trees, a slender central tower, and so on - 
adornments long ago destroyed. A raised passageway runs all the way from the castle across the Borgo to the Vatican. Pope Clement VIII came here along that 
escape route when Spanish and German troops were sacking the Vatican, together with the rest of Rome, in 1527. </p>
<p>The Pope sat out the sack in the castle which proved invulnerable. The fortress took its name from a vision by Pope Gregory the Great in 590, as he was leading a 
procession to pray for the city&#146;s release from plague. Crossing the bridge that leads to the Castle gate, he looked up to see an angel in the act of sheathing a sword. 
The Pope interpreted this as a pledge that the plague would cease. Gratefully Gregory built a chapel and an image of the angel to be set at the castle&#146;s topmost 
turret. Earlier in the same century, in 537, the troops under Justinian&#146;s general Belisarius had been hard put to defend this castle against a sea of Goths. </p>
<p>The contemporary historian Procopius relates that Rome won the day by hurling whole ranks of marble statues down upon the barbarians heads, creating a mighty 
slaughter below. Those statues, were each about three times life size. Their first function had been to tower all around the rim of the Emperor Hadrian&#146;s wide and 
handsome tomb. After designing his own mausoleum, it would seem, and topping it off with a mammoth statue of himself driving a four-horse chariot, Hadrian was 
interred here soon after 138, in a lofty columned tower. Subsequent emperors down to Caracalla (who died in 217) repose below, in a lofty chamber reached by a 
spiral ramp, at the monument&#146;s stony heart. Apparently the ramp was walled off by fortifiers of the castle in about 1390 and not rediscovered until 1823.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="carac">Caracalla Baths</a></h2>
<p>The BATHS OF CARACALLA consisted, in their day, of 27 acres surrounded by a mile long wall, within which might be found facilities ranging from steam 
rooms through tepidariums and immense pools to frigidariums for the cooling-out process. There were also fountains, statues, mosaics, gardens, playing fields, 
gymnasiums, restaurants, libraries, promenades, galleries, theaters and concert halls. Similar baths presented to the citizenry by Trajan and Diocletian offered much 
the same melange of culture and pleasure. </p>
<p>There must always have been room, for Imperial Rome had close the 50 smaller bathing places, and the great ones were truly enormous. Caracalla&#146;s baths had 
marble seats for no less than 1600 people. Aqueducts and slaves made all this possible. Multitude of slaves worked below ground to keep the water hot and the 
wine chilled. Scurrying along hidden corridors, they would pop up here and there to accept or deliver orders. It&#146;s thought that the sybaritic, slave- dependent life of 
the baths contributed to the decline and fall of Rome. Barbarians sieges stopped up the aqueducts; subsequently apathy allowed them to crumble. Rome, 
dehydrated, shrank to a small town. The fabled baths of old reverted to suburban wilderness.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="catac">The Catacombs</a></h2>
<p>The CATACOMBS OF ST. CALIXTUS, these ancient burial chambers, extended for six miles deep underground, just off the Appian Way and some distance 
from the Baths of Caracalla. They make a telling contrast with that site in every way. Believe it or not, Rome has some 600 miles of catacombs altogether. They are 
early Christian cemeteries, so named from the Greek word coemeteria, or sleeping places. Tunneled in the tufa bedrock of the city&#146;s ancient suburbs, some dive as 
many as five stories underground. They are winding, labyrinthian; yet thanks to the broad staircases and vertical air shafts that were carved for them in ancient 
times, the air of the catacombs is sweet and warm. They are not at all unpleasant, let alone unhealthy, to visit. Nor were they unsuited to the memorial and pilgrim 
services that used to be performed in their depths. </p>
<p>The tunnels and tomb-chambers of the catacombs are lined throughout with the long- empty shelves, like ship&#146;s berths, that were cut for thousands upon thousands 
of corpses. Funerary inscriptions abound. So do rathery cursory frescoes, which illustrate Old Testament and even pagan scenes. The shadowy paintings in th 
catacombs demonstrate conclusively that the early Christians were syncretists to a degree, giving imaginative welcome to certain aspects of rival faiths. For instance, 
you will find images of the Good Shepherd in unaccustomed guise, as Orpheus harping to the animals. Or, still more commonly, frescoes that recall Hellenistic 
representations of Hermes, Guide of Souls, bearing a kid on his shoulders.</p>
<p>The Catacombs of St. Calixtus were named after the deacon who was put in charge of them by Pope Zephyrinus (199-217) and who subsequently became Pope 
himself. No less than nine third-century Popes, many of them martyrs, were interred here. But these catacombs, like so much else of Roman civilization, fell into 
disuse following Alaric&#146;s conquest of Rome in 410. Gradually overgrown with vegetation, blocked by earthfalls and forgotten, they were not reexplored, let alone 
restored, until the middle of the 19th Century.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="vatic">THE VATICAN</a></h2>
<p>Every time you turn the corner and look down the Via Conciliazione toward St. Peter&#146;s, your heart beats faster. Sometimes the great dome seems to float like a 
huge white chalice against the blue sky. On cloudy days it is brown and solid, a massive throne rooted deeply in the earth. And at night it glows like a vast candle 
illuminating the sky. San Pietro, the largest church in the world, the mother church of Catholicism, the dominant sight in the Vatican City, the gravestone, in all 
probability of Peter the Fisherman. As one walks down the broad street leading to the Vatican and see its garish political posters, its marble lampposts, its bustling 
sidewalk cafes, its procession of strangely clad ecclesiastical figures, and its occasional empty old church, the other side of a normal Roman reaction takes effect: 
anger, frustration, disappointment. St. Peter&#146;s led to the &quot;selling of indulgences&quot; to finance its construction, which even Catholic scholars today admit was 
outrageous, and led to Martin Luther&#146;s Reformation. </p>
<p>Drawing near the great piazza, read the legend across the top of the facade: Peter and Paul, the apostles in whose honor the church is dedicated, are mentioned off 
on the left-hand side, while the Borghese Pope who built the church receives top billing across the center. One knows that the Church is made up of human beings 
with human faults who make human mistakes. Yet it is a bit much to walk down a street to a basilica constructed to flatter the ego of an arrogant Renaissance 
monarch. But San Pietro is magnificent, with its dome from the Pantheon, and the aula of Diocletian&#146;s law court (the ruins of which can be seen in the Forum, and 
from which some of the marble to build St. Peter&#146;s, in a nice irony, was taken). And if arrogant Renaissance monarchs have stood on its balcony, so too have 
saints. If the Reformation began with St. Peter&#146;s, so did the ecumenical era 20 years ago, when one of the greatest successors of Peter the Fisherman summoned 
the Second Vatican Council. What is amazing about the Catholic Church is not that it makes mistakes, sometimes monumental ones. What is astonishing about it 
rather is that it still has the durability and the fresh youthfulness to produce a John XXIII and Second Vatican Council. The mistakes may continue, but if Jesus 
wanted a Church in which no mistakes were made, he would not have entrusted it to humans. But let&#146;s see the inside of this Vatican City and what it means to the 
world. </p>
<p>The word VATICAN is an ancient place-name of Etruscan origin. In pre-Christian times it was applied to a vast area of swampy land stretching between what is 
today Trastevere and Monte Mario. During the Imperial age, however, the area was transformed into sprawling parks, with huge arenas built for sporting events. In 
fact, what is now St.Peter&#146;s Square was probably a circus for chariot racing, and the sire where early Christians in the early part of the 4th Century, constructed a 
great basilica on the site of what is thought to be St. Peter&#146;s Tomb. The current St. Peter&#146;s, built during the 16th and 17th centuries, replaced that basilica. </p>
<p>For centuries the Popes lived in the area of the right bank of the Tiber that has become the Vatican City, but the Vatican only developed into the Church&#146;s 
governmental center in the 14th Century when Pope Gregory XI returned from exile in Avignon. From the late 16th through the mid-19th centuries, the Popes again 
neglected the Vatican, preferring to live in a new palace on the Quirinale Hill, where they believed the air was healthier. It was only after 1870 and the political 
unification of Italy that the Popes permanently returned to the Vatican. And it was not until 1929, when the Lateran Treaty between Italy and the Holy See 
recognized its sovereignty and defined its boundaries, that the State of the Vatican City was established as the official home of the Pope and the center of the 
Roman Catholic Church. The Vatican is the smallest sovereign state in the world (its 108 1/2 acres make it one-third the size of Monaco). It has its own currency, 
postal service, passport, newspapers, radio station and railroad system. Its population of less than 1000 consists almost entirely of Church personnel, Vatican 
administrators and representatives of international organizations.</p>
<h3><a name="peter">St. Peter&#146;s</a></h3>
<p>Try to arrive in the square before the real crowds begin to gather. The person who stands in this enormous cobble-stone piazza clearly owes a debt of gratitude to 
the great architects Bernini, Maderno and Michelangelo. Standing watch from above the 284 columns of Bernini&#146;s colonnade, and from the rooftop of St. Peter&#146;s 
itself, are 140 larger-than-life statues of saints. The Basilica of St. Peter was begun under the papacy of Julius II in 1506. As you enter the basilica, which has the 
traditional form of a Latin cross, several things will strike you: its size, its incredibly ornate decoration and, most of all, the pervasive golden light that bathes every 
corner of the church. The central and side naves are filled with altars, monuments to the Popes, statues of the founders, intricate mosaics. </p>
<p>Dominating the apse is the monumental papal altar of Saint Peter in Glory, crowned by a highly theatrical gild bronze canopy, a masterpiece of Baroque energy by 
Bernini. Look directly overhead and you will see the dome designed by Michelangelo. The highlight of any visit to St. Peter&#146;s is in the first chapel in the right nave, 
just beyond the entrance to the church. It is Michelangelo&#146;s &quot;Piet&agrave;&quot;. This sculpture is, quite simply, mesmerizing, and a half hour can easily drift by as you stand 
transfixed in its presence. Entrance to the dome is from the left aisle of the church. An elevator takes you as far as the first terrace above the nave. From here you 
have fine view of the Vatican City and beyond. If you want to climb beyond this level, you must do so on an endless and precarious one-way staircase. The reward 
for this grueling ascent is a spectacular panoramic view of Vatican City, Rome and beyond. The Vatican Grottoes lie between the floor level of the old 
Constantinian basilica and the nave of the present church. The winding underground passageways lead past tombs of the great Popes, and the relics and sarchofagi 
that remain from the ancient basilica. The pre-Constantinian Necropolis is one of the most fascinating and mysterious areas of the Vatican. In 1940, the remains of a 
Roman burial ground were discovered below the grotto level of St. Peter&#146;s, with the mausoleums of both pagans and early Christians clearly revealed.</p>
<h3><a name="sistine">The Vatican Museum and Sistine Chapel </a></h3>
<p>The gargantuan Vatican Museums complex is composed of more than two dozen distinct collections, any of which could be a self-sustaining gallery. They are a 
testament to the power of papal art patronage and curatorial talent. The museum has a one-way system to prevent visitors from getting side-tracked in the maze of 
rooms, stairways and courtyards. However, you can be selective within this framework or choose to follow one of four color-coded itineraries. Each itinerary, 
however, culminates in the Sistine Chapel. </p>
<p>As you begin your tour you will pass through the Egyptian Museum, where an underground tomb-chamber of the Valley of the Kings is reproduced, and then make 
your way through the long, sweeping corridor that forms the Chiaramonti Museum, a virtual warehouse of prepossessing busts of ancient Romans and fine copies of 
classical Greek works. The sculpture of antiquity is also the focus of the Pio- Clementine Museum, which contains such masterpieces as the elegant Apollo 
Belvedere, the Lacoon Group and the Belvedere Torso. From here you can wind your way into the Etruscan Museum or continue on to the Rooms of the Greek 
Originals, filled with 5th and 4th Century BC Statues and parts of the original decoration of the Parthenon. Covering the walls of the Gallery of Tapestries are 
enormous, expressive masterpieces of weaving based on cartoons by the pupils of Raphael. The Gallery of Maps is covered with frescoes that serve as an 
important record of 16th Century geography and cartography.</p>
<p>The required viewing of the Vatican Museums include the Raphael&#146;s Stanze, where young Raphael made his mark; the tiny Chapel of Nicholas V with exquisite 
frescoes by Fra Angelico; the Borgia Apartment which offers a virtual one-man show by the Renaissance master Pinturicchio. A stroll through the Collection of 
Modern Religious Art will get you back in the 20th Century. The hundred of works by such artists as Rodin, Chagall Munch etc., provide proof that this subject is 
still persisting in modern art. The elaborately decorated Vatican Library is also considered part of the museum with more than a million books and prints. Finally, no 
tour is complete without a visit to the 15 rooms of the Picture Gallery or Pinacoteca, which provide a fine survey of Italian Painting ranging from the Primitives of the 
11 and 12 Century, the Florentine masters, to the painters of the Renaissance and Baroque periods.</p>
<p>You will know immediately when you have reached the Sistine Chapel, because not only everyone is in the room standing with his eyes turned toward the ceiling, 
but there is an amazing hush that descends as you enter. Although the walls of the Sistine Chapel are covered with paintings by a number of Renaissance masters, 
including Botticelli and Ghirlandaio, they become secondary in the company of Michelangelo&#146;s extraordinary fresco covering the great vaulted ceiling. Also in this 
rooms, on the wall behind the altar, is his sweeping fresco The Last Judgment.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="shop">SHOPPING IN ROME</a></h2>
<p>Shopping is certainly a major attraction for visitors to Rome. Whether you are looking for the high-fashion, big-name purchase or simply for the well-crafted, well 
styled product that Italians have become famous for, there are countless good buys, particularly with the current favorable rate of exchange. Women&#146;s and men&#146;s 
clothing, accessories and leather goods can be bargains. And although the high price of gold makes jewelry expensive anywhere, smaller, beautifully crafted 18K 
items, such as ear-rings, often are surprisingly well priced. Artisan&#146;s expertise makes some products like brass-ware and tablecloths exceptional, and there is plenty 
to excite antique lovers even if they have just come to look. Today there are nice shops throughout Rome, but the best places are still concentrated in several 
downtown areas. Because there are so many stores and boutiques, some pre-purchase reconnoitering is advisable if you have time. Shops are now allowed to be 
open at lunch, but most stay close from 1.00 pm till 3.30 pm. Almost all prices are fixed, but for sizable purchases, a small discount may be offered in exchange for 
cash. Let&#146;s start with the area around your hotel, the Via Veneto and Via Sistina and then progress to some other sections of the &quot;Shopping Rome.&quot;</p>
<h3>Via Veneto, Via Sistina</h3>
<p>These streets and those around them once were the heart of fashionable Rome, the gathering place of movie stars, aristocrats and the Roman pre-jet set. Those 
days are gone now, and Via Veneto&#146;s pleasant sidewalk cafes largely attract clients from the nearby expensive, elegant hotels. For this reason many smart shops 
have remained in the area, and because of its higher prices and broader sidewalks, it is spared the human crash of other shopping districts. The major attractions of 
Via Veneto are its large, fashionable shoe stores. like Bruno Magli, right opposite the American Embassy.</p>
<p>Three blocks up on the other side of the street you can find the gorgeous boots and shoes of Raphael Salato (By chance, &quot;salato&quot; is the Roman word for 
high-priced). Albanese in the middle of Via Veneto has trendy luxury shoes as well as Samo on the opposite side of the sidewalk. Across the street is Luisa 
Spagnoli&#146;s boutique with famous women&#146;s clothes. Pitti, the men&#146;s store nearby usually takes in a large selection of wool and cashmere sweaters. Roxy, back down 
in Via Veneto has a large selection of silk ties with some starting at only $ 5 ! Many leather shops and jewelers are located nearby this area, look at their 
production and choose, if you want, after having shopped around. To go to Via Sistina, continue along Via Ludovisi, the street opposite the Excelsior Hotel and 
turn left at Via Crispi when starting downhill.</p>
<p>At Nocerino you will find bargain prices on some items such as ear-rings of unique make. At Norma, find some unusual knit outfits. Via Crispi intersects Via 
Sistina, which runs towards Trinit&agrave; dei Monti and the Spanish Steps. Here there are expensive boutiques like Gattinoni as well as stores like Femme Sistina. Turning 
left toward Piazza Barberini you pass the Romagnoli men&#146;s store with its many suede items. You can join Gina Lollobrigida shopping at Pancani boutique right 
across the street at N.117 or at Tomassini, next door at N.119 which has elegant women&#146;s clothes or at La Bottega where you can find elegant shoulder bags with 
gold clasps. There are many shopping areas of Rome and we cannot cover them all. But the principal shopping center is along Via del Corso, from Piazza del 
Popolo to Piazza Colonna, and on the pedestrian side streets that run from the Corso to Piazza di Spagna.</p>
<p>Because of its smart sportswear stores and its moderate shoe-shops, the narrow Corso attracts hordes of younger shoppers and easily gets quite crowded, making 
early shopping a must. Shop all along the Corso where you can find inexpensive, even if not great quality, leather jackets and articles of any style and kind. If you 
get tired stop at the San Carlo Bar for a cappuccino and, while you are there, try the luscious &quot;marrons Glac&eacute;s&quot;. Remember that walking through the side streets 
that lead from the Corso to Piazza di Spagna- via Borgognona, Bocca di Leone, Condotti, Frattina- leads you to the top names in Italian Fashion. You can visit 
Gianfranco Ferr&eacute; or Gianni Versace in Via Borgognona, or Fendi where fur-trimmed suede capes sell for about $1860, or Missoni with its nouvelle-vague men&#146;s 
jackets. Also remember Via Condotti, probably the better known of all these narrow streets &#151; where Gucci with its silk scarves and accessories can be found 
along with Bulgari, Ginori, Nazareno Gabrielli, Cucci, the whole Gotha of Italian fashion along with the old and charming Caff&eacute; Greco, originally an hang-out of 
artists and intellectuals and now a reason enough to patronize this area, not to mention spending some time in its vaulted interior and sip cappuccino or espresso, 
sitting at a table where probably Dal&iacute; sat and fantasized.</p>
<p>For visitors interested in antiques, Via del Babuino, running from Piazza di Spagna to Piazza del Popolo, is one center. The other is via dei Coronari, near Piazza 
Navona, which organizes an intriguing street fair every year during the last week of May. A good street for antique jewelry is Via dei Pettinari, running from the 
Tiber to Via dei Giubbonari near Campo dei Fiori. And sometimes there are unusual bargains at the crowded Sunday morning flea market at Porta Portese, on the 
far side of Trastevere.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>FLORENCE </strong>- The &quot;Divine&quot; city lying between the hills of the Arno Valley, idealized by a diaphanous, amber light and mingling art and life gracefully, like no other 
city could. Florence grew from a 200 BC outpost to guard the crossing of the Arno to the incredibly powerful Comune and Signoria of the 11th and 12th Century. 
&quot;The God who made the hills of Florence was an artist&quot;, wrote Anatole France as he looked down at the city, ringed by hills as though cupped in the palm of a giant 
hand, its orange roofs and domes jumbled like an unruly bunch of marigolds. Not just God, but centuries of Florentines have been artists. The Florentines invented 
the Renaissance, which is the same as saying they invented the modern world. For nearly three centuries, from Giotto&#146;s time to Michelangelo&#146;s, Florence was the 
hub of the universe, not only producing palazzi, basilicas and countless art treasures, but also generating ideas that form the cornerstone of 20th Century thought.</p>
<p>Five centuries after the Renaissance, despite neon lights in the storefronts and swarms of mopeds and Fiats honking petulantly where horses and carts once rumbled 
past, Florence remains a Renaissance city. The streets in the center are still paved with uneven flagstones, and away from the main thoroughfares they are so 
narrow that the jutting eaves on opposite sides almost touch, keeping you dry on a rainy day if you hug the ochre-yellow walls. As it is, there is a war of wills every 
time you meet someone coming toward you on the sidewalk no wider than a ledge, and your umbrellas tend to get into a clinch. On a sunny day, look up at the 
skyline, at the leafy terraces, the square towers, the odd gargoyle or coat of arms worn smooth by time. The forbidding palazzi, built of massive blocks of brown 
stone, still seem to bristle as though in expectation of forays by bands of Guelphs and Ghibellines, the two warring factions that divided Florence in the Middle 
Ages. And the faces of today&#146;s townspeople come straight out of the frescoes painted centuries ago, when their ancestors were busy building the biggest dome in 
Christendom. Indeed for many Florentines, little has changed since Giotto drew his perfect &quot;O&quot;. Florence is still the center of their cosmos, and there is no greater 
hardship, as Dante complained, than to &quot;eat the bitter bread of exile&quot; far from their native city. Florence is not a melting pot like Rome or Milan, and the Florentines 
have been Florentine for centuries, especially the nobility, which claims to date from the 1200s. Sardonically witty, parsimonious, suspicious of ostentation, the 
Florentines are intensely critical of anything and everything not Florentine, including God. According to one story, during the flood of Florence in 1966 a street 
vendor, surrounded by the debris of his cart and wares, shook his fist at the heavens and demanded: &quot;And now, what should I say to you?&quot;</p>
<h3><a name="flo_mag">The magic of Florence</a></h3>
<p>The most magical walk in Florence is down the Lungarno (literally &quot;along the Arno&quot;). Swallows wheel above the dome of the Church of San Frediano and over the 
higgledy-piggledy rooftops of the houses. Some of the buildings, jostling each other in a hodgepodge of styles, have foundations in the water. The iron lampposts, 
whose lion&#146;s feet grip the parapets all along the river, look as though they were still lighted by gas. Rowers in kayaks occasionally skim over the surface of the 
fast-flowing yellow river, which gurgles beneath the arches of stone bridges. Rebuilt after World War II, the bridges are not as ageless as they appear, Only one 
remains from early days: the Ponte Vecchio, which was so quaint, with its goldsmiths shops elbowing for room on either side, that Hitler ordered his troops to leave 
it standing. The present structure dates from 1345, and the tiny jeweler&#146;s boutiques that seem stuck to the sides of the bridge like limpets to a rock were once 
butcher shops. In the distance, atop one of the hills whose green flanks, crested with cypress trees, thrust their way into the city, sits that most harmonious of 
Florentine churches, San Miniato, with sun glinting on the gold in its perfectly proportioned Romanesque facade.</p>
<p>Renaissance is also the delight of the frescoes found everywhere in Florence. Giotto&#146;s frescoes of the lives of the two Saint Johns in the Peruzzi Chapel in Santa 
Croce are 650 years old, but they seem almost modern in their color, light and form. So do the Masaccio frescoes in Santa Maria del Carmine, done a century 
later, painted at a time when art was emerging from the era of stern Madonnas with gold-encrusted halos and anemic-looking babies, the faces of Masaccio&#146;s 
subjects, Adam and Eve being expelled from the garden of Eden, are those of real people. The cloisters and cells of the Monastery of San Marco were frescoed 
by their most famous resident, Fra&#146; Angelico, whose stunning Annunciation depicts the Archangel Gabriel with entrancingly striped wings. The walls of the tiny 
chapel in the Palazzo Medici, painted by Benozzo Gozzoli, show the procession from Tuscany to Bethlehem of the Three Kings and their retinue. Dressed in the 
velvets, damasks and cushionlike headgear of the Medici courtiers, the Magi look anything but Oriental. The frescoes in the cloisters of Santa Maria Novella and 
the adjoining Spanish Chapel are breathtaking even by Florentine standards, especially the cosmic disaster of The Flood by Paolo Uccello.</p>
<p>Whether you spend a lifetime seeing Florence or a few days, there are a number of things you must not miss. One, in the Accademia, is Michelangelo&#146;s David. 
Frowning from his pedestal, his sling over his shoulder and every vein and sinew bursting out of the white marble, David makes the rest of us feel very small. One 
wonders how Michelangelo would have portrayed Goliath. There is more marble and more Michelangelo in the Medici Chapels behind the Basilica of San 
Lorenzo; the 16th Century genius was responsible for both the architecture and the sculpture of the reclining figures of Night and Day and Dawn and Dusk. In the 
Uffizi Gallery is some of the most remarkable Renaissance art in the world, including Botticelli&#146;s Birth of Venus and his Primavera, an allegorical painting of Spring 
with the three Graces dancing on flower-strewn grass. The Doni Tondo by Michelangelo has been recently restored and Room 18, with a mother-of-pearl ceiling 
and marble-inlaid floor, its red walls covered with Bronzino portraits of Medici courtiers, is by itself worth a visit to Florence.</p>
<p>In the days when justice was rough and rudimentary, the building that is now the Bargello Museum was Florence&#146;s courthouse, and condemned men were strung 
out of the windows of its tower. Today the museum houses Renaissance statues by Cellini, Giambologna and Verrocchio, among others. There is also another 
David, this one by Donatello, and it is said to be the first nude statue of the Renaissance. The Pitti Palace crouches like an enormous yellow crab around Pitti 
Square, one of the few parking areas in Florence. The palace was built by a Renaissance nobleman, Luca Pitti, who wanted his mansion to be bigger and better 
than anyone else&#146;s. It is now divided into five different museums: the Palatine Picture Gallery, famous for its Raphaels, Titians and Rubens landscapes, the Silver 
Museum, with Lorenzo de&#146; Medici&#146;s vases, the Costume and Porcelain Museum, and the Gallery of Modern Art, which exhibits paintings by Tuscan &quot;Macchiaoli&quot; 
artists, ideological cousins of the French Impressionists. The Pitti&#146;s Monumental Apartments, as they are called, were the living quarters of the families who ruled 
Florence through the centuries &#151; first the Medicis, the merchant princes and Renaissance patrons of the arts; then the Hapsburg-Lorraines in the days when 
Florence was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; and from 1865 to 1870, when Florence was briefly the capital of Italy, the House of Savoy.</p>
<p>The blue and white ceramic reliefs wreathed in garlands of fruit that you see around Florence were probably created by a member of the Della Robbia family, 
which was to ceramics what Michelangelo was to stone. Among the many Della Robbia masterpieces are the sculptured medallions, or tondos, of swaddled infants 
along the facade of the Hospital of the Innocents in Piazza Santissima Annunziata. On the doorsteps of the orphanage, whose name refers to King Herod&#146;s 
infamous &quot;slaughter of the innocents&quot;, unwed mothers once abandoned their newborn. Like most Florentine basilicas, the Duomo, or cathedral, is striped is a 
geometric patchwork of different colored marble. It looks huge even by today&#146;s standards, let alone those of 1296, when the cornerstone was laid. No one had 
succeeded in hoisting aloft a massive dome since the building of the Pantheon in Rome. Bit Brunelleschi, the great Renaissance architect, solved the problem in the 
early 15th C by building two separate domes, one on top of the other, like two salad bowls of different sizes. If you can face the 463 steps that lead to the very 
top, you actually can walk between the two layers of the dome. Or you can climb Giotto&#146;s campanile, or belltower, which Longfellow called &quot;the lily of Florence 
blossoming in stone&quot;. Almost as great a feat as the construction of the dome was the creation of the Baptistery doors, which Michelangelo called the Gates of 
Paradise. It took the sculptor and goldsmith Lorenzo Ghiberti 20 years to forge them in gilded bronze. Two of these panels, which were recently restored, depict 
scenes from the Old Testament and can be seen in the adjacent Museo dell&#146;Opera del Duomo which also houses the treasure of the Cathedral itself. Another 
church of striped marble, Santa Croce, could be called Florence&#146;s Hall of Fame, as it contains tombs and monuments that constitute the Who&#146;s Who of Italy&#146;s 
glorious past. Among the greats memorialized here are Michelangelo, Galileo, Machiavelli and Dante. The splendid frescoes by Ghirlandaio and Filippino Lippi are 
sometimes swallowed up in the darkness of the chapels, which were built by leading Florentine families in gratitude for having survived the Black Death of 1348. 
The wooden crucifix in the sacristy is by Giotto.</p>
<p>Florence is a living art center where people enjoy constant intimacy with masterpieces without losing their natural qualities. Discover just the surface of it and yet we 
return changed, bettered, ready to understand art in its purest forms. Visit the Cathedral and Piazza Signoria and look at the famous David in its outstanding 
position at the Accademia Museum. Florence is so much better seen on your own: you may stroll in the Via Tornabuoni, where dress-makers and antiquaries carry 
on their trade, or round San Lorenzo which is lively with open air stalls. You may pause among the second-hand booksellers of the Annunziata and beneath the 
Loggia dei Lanzi or stop at the luxurious shops on the Ponte Vecchio. At the luncheon or dinner seek out a trattoria or a &quot;buca&quot; (cellar) where to sample delicious 
Tuscan cuisine and everywhere, as you walk, you will see the familiar street scenes, the six-balled shields of the Medicis, the niches, the flower decked resting 
places, the altars and the sculptures that adorn the facades. You may finally discover Florence and its inhabitants with all their facets: irony, artistic sense, quick wits 
and a love of the spectacular. Visit, explore, shop, relax and become one with the natives. Do not forget that this is the city where the best leather can be found, 
and the thousands of shops will attract you constantly, along with some of the best crafted jewelry.</p>
<h3><a name="flo_med">Florence and the Medici</a></h3>
<p>The most glamorous period in the history of art is the Renaissance, and at its very center is Florence, the prosperous merchant city that in the early 15th Century 
became the intellectual and artistic capital of Europe. Many of the most celebrated men in the history of art - Giotto and Ghiberti, Donatello, Brunelleschi and 
Masaccio, Michelangelo and Leonardo - were Florentines; looking back to the grandeur of Rome, they created an artistic tradition that was to last until the late 
19th Centuryentury. Florence remains a small and beautiful city where narrow streets and squares are flanked by medieval and Renaissance buildings; much of its 
attraction lies in the combination of this intimacy and charm with the overwhelming fame of its monuments. The most moving way to begin a visit is to climb to the 
terrace before the Romanesque church of San Miniato and survey the city spread out against the encircling hills; Brunelleschi&#146;s great cupola dominates the view, 
rising over the red rooftops and contrasting with Giotto&#146;s campanile and the slender tower of the Palazzo Vecchio.</p>
<p>From here, across the picturesque Ponte Vecchio - &#145;The Old Bridge&#146;, lined with elegant jewelers - past the bank of the Arno River where Dante met Beatrice, one 
reaches the center of Florence, the Piazza della Signoria. Before the massive Palazzo Vecchio stands a copy of Michelangelo&#146;s David, whose tense grandeur 
contrasts with Cellini&#146;s languorous and dreamy Perseus among the sculptures beneath the arches of the Loggia dei Lanzi. Close by, on Orsanmichele, majestic 
figures of saints look down from their niches with the new confidence and authority of the Renaissance. Further on are the great bronze doors of the baptistery 
(Battistero) - the delicate grace and beauty of Ghiberti&#146;s later set caused Michelangelo to call them the Gates of Paradise. All these sculptures do much to create 
that sense of closeness to the past that is so characteristic of Florence.</p>
<p>The city was dominated by the Medici and their presence is everywhere - in the little chapel in the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi designed by Michelozzo and frescoed 
by Benozzo Gozzoli with a festive procession of the Medici family; in the convent of San Marco (Museo dell&#146; Angelico) where Cosimo de&#146; Medici reserved for 
himself a couple of cells, charmingly frescoed by Fra Angelico and assistants; and in the disturbing melancholy of Michelangelo&#146;s Medici Chapel in San Lorenzo. A 
new note is sounded in the 16th Century when, with Cosimo 1, the Medici became hereditary dukes; their power and authority are felt in Cellini&#146;s vibrant bust of 
Cosimo I (Museo del Bargello) and in Bronzino&#146;s coldly polished portraits.</p>
<p>The collections of the Medici fill the museums of Florence; the Galleria degli Uffizi has the most celebrated collection of Renaissance art in the world; the Galleria 
dell&#146;Accademia boasts Michelangelo&#146;s David; the Palazzo Pitti across the Arno evokes the splendor of the princely collections of the Medici grand dukes. Other 
areas away from the immediate center have a quiet charm and character of their own - Santa Croce, with frescoes by Giotto and the graceful early Renaissance 
Pazzi Chapel, and Santa Maria del Carmine, with crucially important frescoes by Masaccio and Masolino. The best time to visit Florence is in late spring or early 
autumn, either before or after the main onslaught of summer tourists and while the weather is sunny, warm and breezy. From June to August the narrow, congested 
streets and world-famous galleries become almost impossibly crowded, and noise and heat may deter even the most determined sightseer.</p>
<p>The Medici name has a strong fascination, so closely is it associated with that brilliant period of Florentine history when the city shone as the intellectual center of 
Europe; the spirit of this famous family lingers on in the still small and still recognizably 15th Century town. The Medici were originally a banking family, whose 
fortunes were laid by Giovanni di Bicci (l360-l429); his son, Cosimo il Vecchio (l389-l464), returning triumphantly from a period of exile, subtly and warily 
established Medici domination over the government of the Republic. Cosimo&#146;s grandson, Lorenzo the Magnificent (&quot;il Magnifico&quot;, 1449 - &#146;92), a celebrated patron 
of poets and scholars, was his most glamorous successor. Two great popes, Leo X (1475-1521) and Clemente II (l478-l534), sprang from the Medici family. 
After a period of strife, a second era of Medici fame opened with Cosimo I (1519-&#146;74), who became Duke of Florence in 1537 and Grand Duke in 1570. A 
series of grand dukes wielded absolute power over an increasingly gloomy and bigoted court, until the melancholy death of Gian Gastone in 1737.</p>
<p>The PALAZZO MEDICI-RICCARDI, which makes brilliantly clear the contrast between two periods of Medici history, was built for Cosimo il Vecchio by 
Michelozzo, an architect whose restrained brand of classicism particularly appealed to Cosimo&#146;s Republican modesty. The austere, arcaded courtyard is decorated 
only with tondi enclosing the Medici arms and with severely classical, cameo-like scenes from mythology. Here once stood Donatello&#146;s David and Judith and 
Holofernes. Within, the small chapel decorated with the Adoration of the Magi by Benozzo Gozzoli is perhaps the best loved memorial to Medicean taste. It was 
commissioned by Cosimo&#146;s son, Piero the Gouty (&quot;il Gottoso&quot;, 1416-&#146;69); the horseman leading the retinue of kings has been identified as a portrait of Piero, and 
the old man beside him as Cosimo; the youth on the outside may be Lorenzo. This is a courtly, aristocratic art but its fresh gaiety and touches of shrewdness 
contrast with the overwhelming hyperbole of the frescoed gallery across the courtyard. The palace was acquired and enlarged by Marchese Francesco Riccardi in 
1659: he commissioned Luca Giordano to decorate his new gallery with an allegory of human life and of the Medici family. The artist created an exalted panegyric 
to the power of a waning dynasty; at its center is the Apotheosis of the Medici, with the ruling duke, Cosimo III (1642 - 1723), and his two sons, Ferdinando 
(right) and Gian Gastone (left), shown as Castor and Pollux before the throne of Jupiter.</p>
<p>SAN LORENZO sits on the side of the piazza where Bandinelli&#146;s stiff statue of the condottiere, Giovanni delle Bande Nere, father of Cosimo I, resides. The 
monuments of the Medici church sum up three centuries of their taste, opening with the pure simplicity of Brunelleschi&#146;s Old Sacristy, commissioned by Giovanni di 
Bicci in 1421. In 1520 Michelangelo was asked by Cardinal Giulio de&#146; Medici (later Clement Vll) to create the New Sacristy, a profoundly disturbing reflection of 
a troubled age; his bizarre, highly idiosyncratic staircase to the library of the church was commissioned in 1524. A new and grander family mausoleum, the so-called 
Cappella dei Principi, was planned by Cosimo I from c.1570 and built from l602; encrusted with polychrome marble in the reign of Grand Duke Cosimo III 
(1642-1723), it is a final flowering of the twilight Medicean taste for overwhelming splendor and richness. In 1540 the tyrant Cosimo I moved from the Republican 
Palace where Cosimo il Vecchio resided to the Palazzo della Signoria (later Palazzo Vecchio), where his ancestor had been imprisoned. Giambologna&#146;s equestrian 
statue of Cosimo I in the Pizza della Signoria, outside, was intended to give the approach to the palace an air of imperial grandeur, and Vasari transformed the 
palace itself into a princely residence extolling the absolute power of the Medici. Vasari&#146;s frescoes are stiff and dull, but their imagery provides fascinating evidence 
of the Medici story. </p>
<p>Only 10 years later, in 1550, Cosimo once more shifted his residence, this time to the PALAZZO PITTI across the Arno. The decorative programme at the 
Signoria - now renamed the Palazzo Vecchio - meanwhile continued, but the Pitti was to remain the seat of the later grand-ducal court. Here, the splendor of the 
sequence of rooms decorated by Pietro da Cortona speaks a new language that looks on to Versailles; the imagery celebrates the education and achievements of 
the ideal prince. In the first room, the Sala di Venere, note the lively stucco portraits of the Medici. In the third, the Sala di Marte, Pietro&#146;s allegory and illusion are 
at their most dazzling. In the Sala dell&#146; Iliade, below, a grimmer reality is indicated by Susterman&#146;s portraits of the decadent, declining family. If time permits, 
recross the Arno via Ponte Santa Trinita to view Ghirlandaio&#146;s frescoes in the Cappella Sassetti in SANTA TRINITA. Here, the scenes from the Life of St. Francis 
include the finest portrait ever painted of Lorenzo the Magnificent.</p>
<h3><a name="fiesole">Fiesole - Florence&#146;s Own Hill Town</a></h3>
<p>Long before there was a Florence (as early as 800 BC), little Fiesole sat atop a hill overlooking the Arno Valley where the Tuscan Capital would later flower. 
Fiesole was one of the 12 great towns of ancient Etruria, which stretched clear to Arezzo, 50 miles to the southeast. The Romans conquered Fiesole in 283 BC yet 
the town did not grow much under Roman rule, unlike such other Etruscan cities as Bologna and Perugia. The chief Roman contribution to Fiesole was an 
amphitheater, built in 80 BC, in whose restored ruins classic plays are still presented. Although the inevitable rise of Florence robbed Fiesole of much of its glory, it 
remained an enchanting refuge for many, Lorenzo de&#146; Medici used to retreat there from the rigors of governing Florence, and earlier the town was much admired 
by Boccaccio, who set the action of the Decameron there. Clearly good times could always be had in old Fiesole, And so it is today. After the obligatory yet 
rewarding sightseeing and shopping amid the crowds of Florence, nothing is more restorative than a picnic under a Della Robbia blue sky after a 25 minutes trip up 
a winding road lined with pines and cypresses through which you can glimpse villas and gardens.</p>
<p>From Fiesole&#146;s Piazza Mino, follow the ochre colored path leading to the Monastery of San Francesco. Stop along the way at one of the benches near the Church 
of San Alessandro to enjoy the panorama of Florence that made moviegoers gasp in A Room with a View. Continue up to the Gothic monastery to see its lovely 
cloister, which is filled with Chinese art collected by an itinerant monk. Be sure to visit the Roman amphitheater and the Duomo, built in 1000 AD and has gray 
Corinthian columns and Romanesque arches. The Museo Bandini displays paintings by Fra&#146; Angelico and Fra&#146; Filippo Lippi, sculptures by the great Nicola Pisano 
and works by the Della Robbia family.&#160;</p>

<hr>
<p>&#160;Horses were banned in Venice in 1392, and since that time it has been not merely a city on the sea, but one in which access and thoroughfare and even assembly 
are by water or on water. In a way that has never been quite true of any other city, all Venetian streets are back alleys, even though the Austrians filled in some 
canals and created a few wider streets in the 19th Century. For the first-time visitor, the city can nevertheless be utterly confusing. It is a good idea to start where 
Venice started, with the glittering arches and shimmering. dark interior of S. Marco. This is the main monument of the medieval Republic, with its potpourri of stone 
carvings, magnificent mosaics and bejeweled Pala d&#146;Oro altarpiece. The Palazzo Ducale beside it is a monument to the later Middle Ages and of the Renaissance, 
with clusters of late Gothic. The Piazza was the religious and political center of historic Venice; it still is its most magnetic center. </p>
<p>To the north of the Piazza a maze of crooked streets leads to the Rialto Bridge, the commercial center of Venice. To the west is the Accademia Gallery with its 
collection of Bellini, Veronese, Titian, Tintoretto and Tiepolo. Nowhere else in the world is the lasting Venetian flirtation with radiant color and light more 
extensively displayed. The Piazza, Rialto and Accademia constitute a triangle around which the rest of the city sprawls. And skirting this triangle, passing under the 
bridges, snakes the Grand Canal. Outside these limits one should arm himself with a good map. Here begins Venice the city of unexpected views, of narrow 
backwaters and gently lapping tides, of beautiful altarpieces discovered unexpectedly in lesser known churches, and of spectacular picture cycles still in their 
original settings in the ancient Venetian &quot;scuole&quot;. It was Thomas Mann in his famous novel, Death in Venice, who noted that, as in no other city, crowded 
thoroughfares can turn in a moment in deserted, eerie streets. </p>
<h3><a name="intro">An introduction to Venice</a></h3>
<p>Venice is the most bewitching of cities, but the spell it casts is not simple, nor is it altogether benign. It is impossible to feel indifferent about the place. Indeed, many 
reasonable people loathe it at first sight. They go away grumbling, echoing Gibbon&#146;s complaint about &quot;stinking ditches dignified with the pompous denomination of 
Canals,&quot; muttering also about high prices, crowds and the vulgarity of Murano glass. But other people - be warned - fall unexpectedly, obsessively in love with 
Venice - and they find that whatever else Venice may be, she is not an easy mistress.</p>
<p>Venice-lovers tend to be worldly, lonely wanderers. The city can induce violent swings of mood in the most even-tempered of them; but it also soothes their 
restlessness. They know that no place on earth is more exotic, that there is no more richly concentrated blend of cultures. As capital of a precocious and extensive 
empire stretching from Cyprus to the Lombard plain, the city&#146;s character was determined from the start by Orient and Occident and remains a unique fusion of both 
- floating improbably and precariously in the middle of the sea, as uncompromisingly urban as New York, as softly insinuating as a seraglio. It is a cosmopolitan 
city, visited sooner or later by everyone who is anyone, not to mention some 6 million visitors each year; it is also a cozy, gossipy village that you can walk across in 
less than an hour - a salotto citt&agrave; -, Venetians call it: a city like a drawing room . Like the most intriguing of courtesans, Venice offers more than merely physical 
pleasure. It challenges the imagination. It insists upon itself, commanding total attention - yet it seems ultimately unknowable. Its dense labyrinthine topography 
baffles the sense of direction. Buildings and bridges are dissolved and reassembled by the light, their proportions altered by the ebb and flow of the tides. Even after 
years of intimate acquaintance, you may delight in some undiscovered detail in the course of an aimless walk: a minor relief carving, an archway or wellhead. There 
are crystalline winter days when you can see as far as the Dolomites and the Euganean Hills; on such days Venice holds no secrets, is as crisp and colorful as a 
postcard. But there are other days when a dazzling explosion of golden morning fog will modulate through a silvery haze to the tilting purple shadows of evening: 
Turner into Guardi into Monet. And there are evenings when all color and dimensions drain away with the setting sun and the city becomes a black and white 
engraving of itself. </p>
<p>In such a changeable, complex and famous city it is impossible not to feel sometimes bewildered and self-conscious. Venice has been so often described, painted, 
photographed and filmed that we can only sigh, with Henry James, that &quot;There is nothing new to be said about her... originally of attitude is completely impossible.&quot; 
This, as he added, is annoying, it is also muddling, because inevitably everyone&#146;s perception of Venice is veiled by layer upon layer of other people&#146;s 
interpretations. The facts about the city&#146;s past and present, even about its arts, become unfocused. There is certainly no lack of hard factual information about 
Venice. The State Archives are unusually rich in sources of information. But the myths are more compelling than the facts. If you are in love with the city, at first it 
scarcely seems to matter which is the Bridge of Sighs and which is the Rialto and whether Giorgione painted for of four hundred pictures. You are inclined to 
believe the less reliable guidebooks when they tell you that Venice rose from the water like her namesake Venus, or that this was Desdemona&#146;s house and that was 
Othello&#146;s. Then, slowly, you come to realize that you have been beguiled by myth-makers who were themselves beguiled by other myth-makers. The character of 
Venice as we see it is a superimposed invention. One of the more macabre myths, for instance, is perpetuated by modern novelists and film-makers, who persist in 
associating Venice with the uncanny, the morbid, and with death. This myth goes back to the early 17th Century when Venice was regarded, particularly by the 
English, as the most successful but also the most corrupt and sinister of Italian cities. The myth persists in the face of the truth, which is that Venice is one of the 
safest and healthiest of all cities, with a very low crime rate and a high record of longevity. Nor is there anything new about the &quot;schadenfreude&quot; with which 
journalists attack the question: &quot;Is Venice Sinking?&quot; Submersion was predicted by many Romantic writers including Shelley, Byron and Ruskjn. It was, and still is, a 
good metaphor for moral decay. In fact, although flooding remains a danger, the sinking has abated since the construction of aqueducts, obviating the need to draw 
water from the subsoil. </p>
<p>Now Venice faces more complex problems, of which tourist pollution and excessive economic reliance on tourism are only the most obvious. Political impotence 
(the historic center commands only one-third of the municipal vote) leaves the fragile city more and more vulnerable to what the Russian-born poet Josef Brodsky 
has called &quot;rape&quot; by industrial interests that have much to gain by dragging Venice into the 21st century. So modernization schemes are proposed and destructive 
crowd-pulling events are mounted while the ecological balance of the lagoon is neglected and the canals stagnate for lack of dredging. Housing is increasingly 
scarce and expensive. Since the 1950s more than half the native population has emigrated to the mainland. Cynical exploitation and depopulation are more 
imminent dangers than drowning, and should divert the attention of those who love Venice from the more romantically chilling Byronic convention of palaces 
crumbling to the shore. A peculiar aspect of the historic image of Venice as depraved and decaying is that it co-existed for so many centuries with an exactly 
opposite idea of the city. From the middle of the 15th Century until quite recently, the constitution of the Venetian Republic, an elaborate system of checks and 
balances, was widely regarded by political thinkers as the perfect form of government. Apparently impervious to hostile forces from within or without, it placed the 
pursuit of justice above personal ambition and allowed the social classes to co-exist in productive harmony. James Harrington cited the Venetian Utopia in his 
seminal work Oceana (1656); it influenced the philosophy of, among many others, John Locke. Historians now tell us that this ideal of Venice was an exaggeration, 
that a close examination of events under the thousand-year life of the Republic reveals flaws and weaknesses in the Venetian constitution, remarkable an instrument 
though it undoubtedly was. Nevertheless, this myth of Venice was to have far-reaching consequences. When the founding fathers of the newly independent United 
States of America drew up a constitution, they looked to the Venetian model of checks and balances. Republican government in Venice itself was by then nearly 
finished. Venice, in the Age of Enlightenment, was wholly despised. But the myth persisted. Myths, as all Venice-lovers know, are often more powerful than reality.</p>

<h3><a name="inter">The Interior of Venetian Palaces</a></h3>
<p>Visitors to Venice must frequently be curious as to what lies behind the innumerable palace facades that line the city&#146;s canals. Four of the most magnificent of these 
palaces - the PALAZZO DUCALE, CA&#146; D&#146;ORO, CA&#146; PESARO and CA&#146; REZZONICO - Will be seen in the course of any standard tour of the city; yet the 
vast majority are not officially open to the public, are rarely described in guidebooks and - unlike the city&#146;s churches - have no plaques outside them to indicate the 
treasures contained within. All this should not deter the interested tourist: these palaces now house mainly offices and institutions, and can simply be visited by 
seeking the assistance of the porter. </p>
<p>A tour of this little known side to Venice can begin with a part of the Palazzo Ducale now divided off from the main building and called the Palazzo Patriarcale; it is 
entered from the Calle Canonica. Once inside you should ask to see the Sala dei Banchetti. This is a massive 18th Century banqueting hall with a ceiling completely 
frescoed in 1760 by Jacopo Guarana, a follower of Tiepolo, in collaboration with the ornamentalist Francesco Zanchi. The frescoes, representing allegories of 
Virtues, were the last major artistic commission of the Republic; their unveiling was one of the most celebrated events of the Venetian 18th Century. A short walk 
to the N of the Palazzo Patriarcale, along the Calle Specchieri and Merceria San Zulian, brings you to the Palazzo Dandalo, known in the second half of the 1 8th 
Century for its notorious gambling hall, the Ridotto Venier. Only aristocrats or those wearing masks were allowed to enter the Ridotto; it was closed down by the 
Republic in 1774, in an effort to prevent the nobility from losing all their money to foreigners. The interior is as intimate as the Sala dei Banchetti is grand, and 
comprises a series of tiny rooms with walls and ceilings covered with some of the finest and most fantastic Rococo stuccoes in the city. Going west from here, 
through the Campo Manin, you eventually reach the Palazzo Sandi Porto at Calle dell&#146; Albero 3870. The interior of this rather dark and sinister building is now 
divided into a series of private apartments. The main room on the first floor contains one of Tiepolo&#146;s earliest ceiling frescoes. No one now lives in this part of the 
palace, and it can be difficult to find a porter who will let you in. Those who persevere will be rewarded by the sight of a fresco of quite astonishing power, the 
Triumph of Eloquence (1724-25 ) . It is a dark and melodramatic work, with figures disposed around the rim of the ceiling as if by some centrifugal force. </p>
<p>The Salizzada San Samuele and Calle delle Carrozze, to the west of the Palazzo Sandi, lead to the Campo San Samuele, dominated on the North side by the 18th 
Century Palazzo Grassi. This is one of the masterpieces of Giorgio Massari, the 18th Century Venetian architect who built the Ca&#146; Rezzonico just across the Grand 
Canal. The Palazzo Grassi houses the Centro delle Arti e del Costume which puts on exhibitions devoted mainly to folklore and costume. It has a grand marble 
staircase with charming mid 18th Century frescoes featuring figures in contemporary costume staring down at the spectator from behind a fictive balcony The artist 
is unknown. Just to the west of the Ca&#146; Rezzonico, at Fondamenta Foscarini 2597, is the late 17th Century Palazzo Zenobio. The enormous ground floor Salone 
has walls covered with mirrors and exuberant Baroque stuccowork, and a frescoed ceiling by the leading Venetian decorator of the late Baroque, Ludovico 
Dorigny . One of the least visited and in many ways most enchanting parts of the city is the northern district known as Cannaregio. </p>
<p>On the south edge of this is the PALAZZO LABIA, famous for its gloriously ethereal Tiepolo frescoes, perhaps the very finest of this artist&#146;s mature works. Two of 
Cannaregio&#146;s long parallel thoroughfares have palaces frescoed by his son, Giandomenico. The Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo at Fondamenta Gaspare Contarini 3539 
has a ceiling fresco by Giandomenico (1784) in the first floor Salone. The room is now the sitting room of an old people&#146;s home but occasional visitors who are 
prepared to make themselves pleasant to staff and residents provide a welcome distraction . The interior of the Palazzo Caraggiani at Fondamenta della Sensa 
3336 is so small that it seems almost like that of a dolls&#146; house. There are two rooms here with frescoes by Giandomenico (1790-95) . The exceptionally delicate 
and simple style of these works - in one case, just a few birds against a clear white background - is strikingly different from the grand allegorical manner displayed 
by the artist in the Palazzo Contarini. Such simplicity indicates the changing attitudes towards decoration at the very end of the 18th Century .</p>
<p>Making your way back to the Piazza San Marco, you may like to have a brief look at the staircase vestibule of the Palazzo Sagredo on the Strada Nuova. On one 
of its enormous walls is portrayed the Fall of the Giants (1734). The effect the artist aimed for was of the whole building collapsing around the spectator: 
unfortunately his technical abilities were not up to it. These truly abysmal frescoes are by none other than Pietro Longhi, the well known specialist in intimate genre 
scenes of 18th C Venetian life. Looking at the Palazzo Sagredo frescoes, one can only sympathize with the artist in his subsequent decision to abandon a Baroque 
manner and work on a small scale. &#160;</p>

<p>Few places on earth, especially of comparative size have as rich a natural heritage as does Peru. Its archeological treasures are unearthed each day reflecting many 
of the oldest and some of the world&#146;s most cultured civilizations which existed long before Christ. They could fuse metals in a plating process before the new 
testament was written, tamed the llama and irrigated cultivated crops more than 6,000 years ago. Archeologists believe that the Moche had more land under 
cultivation 1,500 hundred years ago than modern day Peru until the last few decades in the northern departments.</p>
<p>This country&#146;s wonders don&#146;t stop with its cultural accomplishments they only begin with them for many of Peru&#146;s greatest treasures are found within its complex 
environmental structure. Twice the size of Texas but smaller than Alaska, Peru harbors 84 of the 101 classified lifezones used to describe environmental areas. It 
has 1701 known species of birds which is more than 50% of all the birds found within the neotropics, a region 25 times larger. Thirteen hundred and forty-seven 
species of orchids in 167 genera are known to grow in Peru and more than sixty are awaiting classification and verification. More than half of the orchids are found 
in eight of its departments and six of those same regions are home to more than 50% of the endemic species. What kind of varied terrain is required to sustain such 
diversity and numbers? It&#146;s a well studied question. Peru is not a giant in terms of landmass but it&#146;s been physically organized and located at the top of the ladder as 
far as natural structuring is concerned.</p>
<hr>
<p>Peru has three major regions: </p>
<ul>
<li><font size=4><em>a narrow coastal belt, predominantly desert with Peru's major cities; </em></font></li>
<li><font size=4><em>the wide Andean mountains </em></font></li>
<li><font size=4><em>the Amazon Basin. </em></font></li>
</ul>
<p>The vast wealth of wildlife is protected in a system of national parks and reserves with almost 30 areas covering nearly 5% of the country. Peru's climate can be 
divided into two seasons - wet and dry - the coast and western Andean slopes are generally dry, with the summer falling between December and April; during the 
rest of the year, the gar&uacute;a (coastal fog) moves in and the sun is rarely seen. In the Andes, the dry season is from May to September, while the wet season takes up 
the remainder of the year. On the eastern slopes of the Andes, the drier months are similar to the highlands, though the wet season (January to April) is more 
pronounced. The country can be divided into three different sectors, each with its own main city and attractions:</p>
<p><a name="north"><font size=4><strong>Northern Peru</strong></font></a><font size=4> </font>- From Lima to the border with Ecuador, one finds extraordinary archaeological monuments such as: Sechin in Casna, Chan Chan in Trujillo 
and Tucume in Chiclayo. There are beautiful tropical beaches in Piura and Tumbes as well as the highest mountain (6,880 mtrs.), the majestic Huascaran is located. 
North of the mountains one finds Cajamarca and its lovely countryside, Inca ruins and Spanish Colonial Buildings. A little more to the north are the charming towns 
of Huanuco and Tingo Maria, home of the Sleeping Beauty, a mountain shaped like a sleeping woman. <a href="per_nor.html"><em><strong>Click here for detailed information on this region</strong></em></a></p>

<h2><a name="cuis">Peruvian Cuisine</a></h2>
<p>Peruvian cuisine is characterized by its variety because of the diversity of ingredients employed, being products of different climates. We have more than 200 
varieties of potato and other tubers, as well as t wide variety of pulses, different types of fruit and an abundant choice of green vegetables. The use of garlic, onion 
and different kinds of chili peppers and &#145;rocotos&#146; (a red, hot pepper not to be confused with the sweet pepper of the same color) is frequent in many of the typical 
dishes. Amongst these may be mentioned &#145;cebiche&#146; belonging to the coastal region, differing slightly from place to place according to the proportions of the 
ingredients and to the type of fish and/or shellfish used as a basis for its preparation. </p>
<p>Cebiche is fish &#145;cooked&#146; in lemon juice and garnished with raw onion, corn on the cob, sweet potato (or plain potato) and lettuce as well as garlic and chili pepper 
or &#145;rocoto&#146;. There is also a variety of &#145;escabeche&#146; dishes based on fish, chicken or duck, garnished with cooked onion, sweet potato, chili pepper, fresh cheese 
and olives. </p>
<p>Other tasty dishes are &#145;aji de gallina&#146; (piquant chicken dish; &#145;cau cau&#146; based on tripe and potato; &#145;tamales&#146; of pork or chicken; &#145;humitas&#146; (a smaller and different 
mix of tamale) which may be sweet savory; &#145;chupes&#146; (fish soups or stews like chowder based on fish or crayfish, lanticuchos&#146; of beef heart (a kind of shish-kebab) 
the meat being marinated prior to its broiling over charcoal; &#145;papa la huancaina&#146;; &#145;ocopa a la arequipefize (both hors d&#146;oeuvres dishes based on cooked potato 
covered with a piquant sauce), stuffed potatoes (papas rellenas),&#146;causa a la limenia&#146; or &#145;causa&#146; which is stuffed (both based on yellow potatoes which have been 
cooked, mashed and highly seasoned); &#145;ollucos con charqui&#146; (a tuber prepared with dried lama meat); &#145;arroz con pato a la chiclayana&#146; (duck and rice, Chiclayo 
style); a variety of dishes based on lightly cooked fish (steamed, etc.); &#145;carapulcra&#146; (based on naturally freeze-dried potato); and innumerable other dishes.</p>
<p>As for desserts, these come in a huge variety, particularly grain and potato-based puddings, viz: mauve maize pudding containing fruit, molasses pudding, others 
made of potato flour (similar to the consistency of arrowroot), semolina, orange, milk, sweet potato, wheat flour, molasses and spices, etc., rice pudding, &#145;arroz 
sambito&#146; (dark rice pudding due to use of molasses), &#145;arroz mestizo&#146;, &#145;sanguito&#146;, &#145;huevo chimbo&#146; (sweet and based on sponge cake of egg yolks soaked in liquor 
syrup - a sort of Peruvian baba au rhum), &#145;picarones&#146;, &#145;buniuelos&#146; (both these a sort of light, fried donut), &#145;suspiros de Limenia&#146; (literally: a Lima lady&#146;s sigh - very 
sweet with meringue topping), &#145;turron de Dona Pepa (a kind of cake-cum-biscuit drizzled with molasses syrup previously spiced). etc.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Early Period</h3>
<p>The coastal strip around 4000 BC was wetter than today's desert and a number of small settlements were established, thus changing the status of the people from 
nomadic hunters and gatherers to settled agriculturalists and fishermen. Several of these settlements have been excavated, with the garbage mounds yielding the best 
information about life at that time. Some of the best known sites are Huaca Prieta in the Chicama Valley near Trujillo, Chilca and Asia, south of Lima. Chilca was 
inhabited about 4000 BC and the other two sites about 2000 BC. The inhabitants fished with nets or with bone hooks and collected seafood such as crabs and sea 
urchins. Various crops were cultivated, including cotton which appeared early (about 3000 BC) as well as chill) peppers, beans' squashes and, about 1400 BC' 
corn. The cotton was used to make clothing, mainly with the simple techniques of twining and later by weaving. The people lived in primitive one-room dwellings, 
lined with stone in Huaca Prieta, or they had branch or reed huts as in Asia. Ceramics and metalwork were still unknown although jewelry made of bone and shell 
was used. Roughly contemporary with these coastal settlements was the enigmatic site of Kotosh near Huanuco - one of the earliest ruins in highland Peru. Little is 
known about the people who lived here, but their buildings were the most developed for that period, and pottery fragments found here predate by several hundred 
years those found in other parts of Peru. From around 1250 BC to 850 BC there are remains in the Viru Valley and Guanape area, about 50 km south of Trujillo 
on the north coast which show that, during this time, ceramics developed from rude undecorated pots to sculpted, incised and simply colored pots of high quality. 
Weaving, fishing and horticulture also unproved and simple funerary offerings have been found.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chavin">Middle Perior ( or Chavin Period)</a></h3>
<p>This period is named after the site of Chavin de Huantar, 40 Km east of Huaraz in the Department of Ancash. It is also known as the middle formative period and 
lasted from about 850 BC until 300 BC. It is termed a 'horizon' because its artistic and religious influences can be seen in several contemporary cultures, including 
the Cupisnique ceramics of the Lambayeque region (north of Trujillo) and the early pottery of Paracas Cavernas (south of Lima). Thus the Chavin influence was felt 
in a huge area covering most of the northern two-thirds of Peru's highlands and coast. The salient feature of the Chavin influence is the repeated representation of a 
stylized jaguar, hence the Chavin is often termed a jaguar-worshipping cult. Most importantly, this period represents the greatest early development in weaving, 
pottery, agriculture, religion and architecture - in a word, culture. Many archaeologists see the Chavin Horizon as the most important cultural development of 
pre-Columbian Peru. </p>
<p>Around 300 BC the Chavin style suddenly and inexplicably disappeared and there was little unity in the cultures found in Peru during the next 500 years. Although 
none of these cultures were individually outstanding or widespread, several were locally important. The best known are the Salinar culture of the Chicama Valley 
area near Trujillo and the Paracas Necropolis south of Lima. Salinar ceramics show advanced firing techniques, whilst the textiles of the Paracas Necropolis are 
markedly improved and different from the earlier Paracas Cavernas; these textiles are considered the finest pre-Columbian textiles to have been produced 
anywhere in the Americas.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="moche">Regional </a>Period and Wari Empire </h3>
<p>This period lasted from about 100 AD to 700 AD and, as its name suggests, was not marked by any single unifying horizon but by local development in several 
regions. Pottery, metalwork and weaving reached a pinnacle of technological development throughout Peru and hence this period is often referred to as either the 
Florescent or Classic. Two distinct cultures of this period are particularly noted for their exceptional pottery - the Moche from the Trujillo area and the Nazca 
people from the south coast. These cultures recorded their ways of life in intricate detail on their ceramics and so provide archaeologists with an invaluable 
reference tool. Many of Peru&#146;s main museums have good collections of Nazca and Moche pottery. These two cultures also left some interesting sites which are 
worth visiting: the Moche built massive pyramids such as the Temples of the Sun &amp; Moon near Trujillo and the Nazca made their enigmatic giant petroglyphs in the 
desert. These last are known as the Nazca Lines and are best appreciated from the air in one of the many overflights in small airplanes available in the town of 
Nazca. <em><strong>For more information on the Moche Period </strong></em><a href="per_moch.html#The Moche"><font size=4><em><strong>Click Here</strong></em></font></a></p>
<p>Soon after we find the signs of a new culture in the highland city of Wari (Huari), about 25 km north of Ayacacho. Wari was the capital of the first expansionist 
empire known in the Andes. Unlike the earlier Chavin Horizon, expansion was not limited to the diffusion of artistic and religious influence. The Wari were vigorous 
military conquerors who built and maintained important outposts throughout much of Peru. These included Pikillacta near Cuzco, Cajamarquilla near Lima, 
Wilcahualn near Huaraz, Wariwillka near Huancayo, Wiracochapampa near Huamachuco and Los Paredones near Cajamarca. The Wari culture was the first 
strongly militaristic and urban culture of Peru. Also, it was influenced by the Tiahuanaco religion from the Lake Titicaca region.</p>
<p>The Wari attempted to subdue the cultures they conquered by enforcing their own values and suppressing loca1 oral traditions and regional self-expression. Thus 
from about 700 AD to 1100 AD, Wari influence is noted in the art, technology and architecture of most areas in Peru. More significantly, from an archaeologist's 
point of view, any local oral traditions which may have existed were forbidden by the conquerors and slowly forgotten. With no written language and no oral 
traditions, archaeologists must rely entirely on the examination of excavated artifacts to gain an idea of what life was like in the early Peruvian cultures. The Wari too 
in their turn were overthrown and their culture obliterated. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chimu">The Period of Regional States</a></h3>
<p>Because of their cultural dominance and oppression, it is not surprising that the Wari were generally not welcomed, despite their improvements in urban 
development and organisation. By about 1100 AD they had been overthrown, not by a new conquering force but by individual groups in their local areas. These 
separate regional states thrived for the next 400 years, the best known being the Chimu kingdom in the Trujillo area. Its capital was the huge adobe city of Chan 
Chan which is often referred to as the largest adobe city in the world. Roughly contemporary with the Chimu was the Chachapoyas culture of the Utcubamba River 
basin in the Deparunent of Amazonas. Its people built Kuelap, one of the most mysterious of the highland ruins. Also contemporary with the Chimu were the 
Chancay people from the Chancay Valley just north of Lima. The best collection of Chancay artefacts is at the excellent Amano Museum in Lima. Further south 
was the Ica-Chincha culture whose artifacts can be seen in the Ica Regional Museum. There were also several small altiplano tribes who lived near Lake Titicaca 
and were frequently at war with one another. They left impressive, circular funerary towers dotting the bleak landscape - the best are to be seen at Sillustani. There 
were also the Chanka who lived in the Ayacucho-Apurfmac area and, of course, there was the kingdom of Cuzco which was the predecessor of the greatest 
pre-Columbian empire on the continent. <em><strong>For more information on the Chimu Period </strong></em><a href="per_moch.html#The Chimu"><font size=4><em><strong>Click Here</strong></em></font></a></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="inca">The Inca Empire</a></h3>
<p>The Inca Empire, for all its greatness, existed for barely a century. The Incas had no written language and their history was entirely oral, passed down through the 
generations. The empire's main expansion occurred in the 100 years or so prior to the arrival of the conquistadors. Our knowledge of their history dates back to the 
&quot;chronicles&quot; which included accounts of Inca history as related by the Incas to the Spanish chroniclers. </p>
<p>Manco Capac was the first of the Inca rulers. The reigns of the seven Incas who succeeded Manco Capac spanned a period from around the 12th century to the 
early 15th century. The small tribe they governed was one of several groups living in the Andean highlands during the 13th and 14th centuries. These Incas left few 
signs of their existence, though the remains of some of their palaces can still be seen in Cuzco. </p>
<p>The 9th Inca, Pachacutec, began the empire's great expansion. Until his time, the Incas had dominated only a small area close to Cuzco, frequently skirmishing with, 
but not conquering, various other highlad tribes. One such tribe, the expansionist Chancas. occupied a region about lS0 hen east of Cuzco and, by 1438 was on the 
verge of conquering Cuzco. Viracocha Inca and his eldest son, Urcon, believed that their small empire was lost but Viracocha Inca's third son refused to give up 
the fight. With the help of some of the older generals he rallied the Inca army and, in a desperate final battle, managed to rout the Chancas. According to legend, the 
unexpected victory was won because the boulders on the battlefield fumed into warriors and fought on the side of the Inca.</p>
<p>The victorious younger son changed his name to Pachacutec and proclaimed himself the new Inca over his father and elder brother. Buoyed by his victory over the 
Chancas he began the first wave of the expansion which was to eventually create the Inca Empire. During the next 25 years, he conquered most of the central 
Andes between the two great lakes of Titicaca and Junin. As a mighty military figure, historians have frequently compared Pachacutec to the likes of Alexander the 
Great and Genghis Khan. He was also a great urban developer. Pachacutec devised the city's famous puma shape and diverted the Sapphi and Tullumayo rivers 
into channels which crossed the city, keeping it clean and providing it with water. He built agricultural terraces and many buildings, including the famous Coricancha 
temple and his palace on what is now the western corner of the Plaza de Armas in Cusco. </p>
<p>Huayna capac, the 11th Inca was the last to rule over a unified empire. By this time, Europeans had discovered the new world and various epidemics started 
sweeping down on the Empire. A civil was also erupted. In 1532, after several years of warfare, Atahualpa's battle-hardened troops won the major battle of the 
civil war and captured Huascar outside Cuzco. Atahualpa, the new Inca, retired to Cajamarca to rest. Meanwhile, Francisco Pizarro landed in northern Ecuador 
and marched south in the wake of Atahualpa's conquests. Although Atahualpa was undoubtedly aware of the Spanish presence, he was too busy fighting the civil 
war to worry about a small band of foreigners. By the autumn of 1532, however, Pizarro was in norehern Peru, Atahualpa had defeated Huascar and a fateful 
meeting was arranged between the Inca and Pizarro. The meeting, which took place in Cajamarca on 16 November 1532, was to change the course of South 
American history. The Inca was ambushed by a few dozen armed conquistadors, who succeeded in capturing Atahualpa, killing thousands of unarmed Indians and 
routing tens of thousands more. The conquest of the Incas had begun. <em><strong>For more information on the Inca Period </strong></em><a href="per_inca.html"><font size=4><em><strong>Click Here</strong></em></font></a></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="The Conquest">The Conquest</a></h3>
<p>The conquest succeeded for two main reasons. Firstly, Pizarro realized that the emotion of the recent civil war still ran high and decided to turn this to his 
advantage. Accordingly, after holding Atahualpa prisoner and then murdering him, he marched into Cuzco and was accepted by the people because their loyalties 
lay more with the defeated Huascar than with Atahualpa. The second reason was the superior Spanish weaponry. Mounted on horseback, protected by armor and 
swinging steel swords the Spanish cavalry was virtually unstoppable. The Spaniards hacked dozens of unprotected Indian warriors to death during a battle. The 
Indians responded with their customary weapons - clubs, spears, slingshots and arrows - but these were rarely lethal against the mounted, armor-plated 
conquistadors. Furthermore, in the early battles, the Indians were terrified of the Spaniards' horses and primitive firearms, neither of which had been seen in the 
Andes It took Pizarro almost a year to reach Cuzco after capturing Atahualpa. In an attempt to regain his freedom, the Inca offered a ransom of a roomful of gold 
and two rooms of silver. This was to be brought from Cuzco. To speed up the process, Pizarro sent three soldiers to Cuzco early in 1533 to strip Coricancha or 
the 'Gold Courtyard', of its rich ornamentation. Pizarro himself entered Cuzco on 8 November 1533 after winning a series of battles on the road from Cajamarca. 
By this time, Atahualpa had been killed and Pizarro appointed Manco, a halfbrother of Huascar, as a puppet Inca. For almost 3 years, the empire remained 
relatively peaceful under the rule of Manco Inca and Pizarro.</p>
<p>In 1536 Manco Inca realized that the Spaniards were there to stay and decided to try and drive them from his empire. He fled the Spanish and raised a huge army, 
estimated at well over 100,000. He laid siege to the Spaniards in Cuzco and almost succeeded in defeating them. Only a desperate, last-ditch breakout from Cuzco 
and a violent battle at Sacsayhuaman saved the Spanish from complete annihilation. Manco Inca retreated to Ollantaytambo and then into the jungle at Vilcabamba. </p>

<p align=center><a href="#The Moche">Moche Culture</a> - | - <a href="#The Chimu">Chimu Culture</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Moche and Chimu cultures left the greatest mark on the Trujillo area, but are by no means the only ones as over 2000 sites in the Moche River valley. Many of 
these sites are small and nearly forgotten, but others include the largest pre-Columbian city in America (Chan Chan) as well as pyramids which required in excess of 
an incredible 100 million adobe bricks to construct. Five major archaeological sites can be easily reached from Trujillo by local bus or taxi. Two of these sites are 
Moche, dating from about 500 AD. The other three, from the Chimu culture, date from about 1200 AD to 1300 AD.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="The Moche">The Moche</a></h3>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=13%><img src="images/pe_moch.jpeg" align=bottom width=157 height=240></td><td width=50%>The fascinating Moche period begins with the decline of the Cupisnique period at about the time of Christ.The Moche didn't 
conquer the Cupisnique; rather, there was a slow transition characterised by a number of developments. Ceramics, textiles and 
metalwork improved `greatly, architectural skills allowed the construction of huge pyramids and other structures and there was 
enough leisure tune for art and a highly organised religion. The Moche culture, a culture that has left impressive archaeological sites 
and some of the most outstanding pottery to be seen in Peru's museums, is named after the river which flows into the ocean just 
south of Trujillo. The word Mochica has been used interchangeably with Moche and refers to a dialect spoken in the Trujillo area 
at the time of the conquest, though not necessarily spoken by the Moche people. Moche is now the preferred usage.<p>As with the Nazca culture, which developed on the south coast at about the same time, the Moche period is especially known for 
its ceramics, considered the most artistically sensitive and technically developed of any found in Peru. The thousands of Moche 
pots preserved in museums are so realistically decorated with figures and scenes that they give us a very descriptive look at life 
during the Moche period. Pots were modelled into lifelike representations of people, crops, domestic or wild animals, marin life 
and houses. Other pots were painted with scenes of both ceremonial and everyday life. From these pots, archaeologists know that 
Moche society was very class conscious.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p> The most important people, especially the priests and warriors, were members of the urban classes and lived closest to the large ceremonial pyramids and other 
temples. They were surrounded by a middle class of artisans and then, in descending order: famrers and fishermen, servants, slaves and beggars.</p>
<p>The priests and warriors were both honoured and obeyed. They are the people most frequently shown in ceramics, which depict them being carried in litters 
wearing particularly fine jewelry or clothing. Their authority is evident from pots showing scenes of punishment, including the mutilation and death of those who 
dared to disobey. Other facets of Moche life illustrated on the pots include surgical procedures such as amputation and setting of broken limbs. Sex is realistically 
shown; one room in the Rafael Herrera Museum in Lima is entirely devoted to (mainly Moche) erotic pots depicting most sexual practices, some rather imaginative. 
Clothing, musical instruments, tools and jewellery are all frequent subjects for ceramics. As there was no written language, most of what we know about the Moche 
comes from this wealth of pottery. The ceramics also show us that the Moche had well-developed weaving techniques but, because of rare rainstorms every few 
decades, most of their textiles have been destroyed. Metalwork, on the other hand, has survived. They used gold, silver and copper mainly for ornaments but some 
heavy copper implements have also been found.</p>
<p>The Moche did not live in towns as we know them. A more accurate description would be a high-density peasant population surrounding a central worship site 
such as a massive pyramid. Two of these survive, side by side, a few km south of Trujillo. They are known as the Huacas del Sol y de la Luna, or the 'Temples of 
the Sun and the Moon', and are easily visited. The Temple of the Sun is the largest pre-Columbian structure in South America </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="The Chimu">The Chimu</a></h3>
<p>The Moche period declined around 700 AD and the next few centuries are somewhat confusing. The Wari culture, based in the Ayacucho area of the central 
Peruvian Andes, began to expand and its influence was felt as far north as the Chicama Valley. The next important period in the Trujillo area, the Chimu, lasted 
from about 1000 AD to 1470 AD. The Chimu built a capital at Chan Chan, just north of Trujillo. </p>
<p>Chan Chan is the largest pre-Columbian city in Peru, covering about 28 sq km, and is estimated to have housed about 50,000 people. The Chimu was a highly 
organised society - it must have been to have built and supported a city such as Chan Chan. Its artwork was less exciting than that of the Moche, tending more to 
functional mass production than artistic achievement. Gone, for the most part, is ~e technique of painting pots. Instead, they were fired by a simpler method than 
that used by the Moche, producing the typical blackware seen in many Chiml1 pottery collections. Despite its poorer quality, this pottery still shows us life in the 
Chimu kingdom. Although the quality of the ceramics declined, metallurgy developed and various alloys, including bronze, were worked. The Chimu were also 
exceptionally fine goldsmiths.</p>
<p>It is as an urban society that the Chimu are best remembered. Their huge capital contained approximately 10,000 dwellings of varying quality and importance. 
Buildings were decorated with friezes, the designs molded into the mud walls, and the more important areas were layered with precious metals. There were storage 
bins for food and other products from their empire, an empire which stretched along the coast from the Gulf of Guayaquil to Chancay. There were huge walk-in 
wells, canals, workshops and temples. The royal dead were buried in mounds with a wealth of funerary offerings.</p>
<p>Chan Chan must have been a dazzling sight at one time. Today, only the mud walls and a few molded decorations remain and the visitor is amazed by the huge 
expanse of the site as much as anything else. The Chimu were conquered by the Incas in about 1460 but the city was not looted until the arrival of the Spanish. 
Heavy rainfall has severely damaged the mud moldings, though a few survive and others have been restored.</p>

<hr>
<p>In the early decades of the 15th century, an obscure people whose rulers claimed descent from the sun embarked on a series of conquests that would enable them 
to dominate the last hundred years of Andean history. Known later by the name they used to designate their leader, these Incas rose to power in Cusco. Although 
their subsequent supremacy was often achieved through diplomacy, the Incas boasted one of the most well organized and ruthless armies of the ancient world.</p>
<p>Leading them was Pachacuti a military strategist, statesman, and diplomat of enormous skill. Armies under Pachacuti and his son and successor, Topa Inca, 
conquered the entire mountainous area from Quito south past Lake Titicaca. Topa Inca also subjugated the coastal kingdom of Chimor, and extended the Inca 
domain farther south, as well as east to the fringes of Amazonia. The Incas maintained their realm with astonishing efficiency. They called their empire 
Tabuantinsuyu, &quot;the land of the four quarters,&quot; reflecting a fourfold geographic division that was in turn subdivided into more than 80 provinces. These were 
populated by taxpaying citizens in carefully documented groups. </p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=50%>At the apex of power stood the emperor, the ''<em><strong>Unique Inca,</strong></em>&quot; a divine representative of the sun. From him 
control filtered downward through an elite class of nobles. Some were hereditary. Other select groups in 
conquered lands who were willing to cooperate with their new leaders became &quot;Incas by privilege.&quot; The majority 
of the empire's able-bodied citizens sustained its economy with the mita, or service tax in the form of agricultural 
work or of labor in government-owned mines, and on bridges, buildings, and roads. In return, the system 
guaranteed that every individual even the old or disabled would receive his or her basic needs. <p>The diverse peoples of the empire were controlled by a highly authoritarian bureaucracy. Potentially rebellious 
groups were transplanted into the midst of loyalists, while trustworthy subjects were moved to areas of dissent. 
The use of Quechua, the Inca language, as the common tongue of administration helped to unify the patchwrork 
population, as did commerce and the institution of the Inca pantheon as the official state religion. The military 
garrisons that dotted the land served as constant reminders of Cuzco's might. </p>
</td><td width=23%><img src="images/inc_cit.jpeg" align=bottom width=300 height=248></td></tr>
</table>
<p></p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=17%><p align=left><img src="images/inc_rd2.jpeg" align=bottom width=186 height=383> </p>
</td><td width=50%>A vast network of highways linked all parts of the Inca Empire. Along these thoroughfares moved mobile army units, 
accompanied by pack trains of llamas and by chasquis, specially trained runners who relayed memorized news and the 
orders of the empire between carefully spaced tambos, or way stations. These messengers formed a communications 
system that could guarantee one-day delivery for every 140 miles of road. Often the Inca himself, bedecked in splendor 
and borne on a golden litter, traveled along the roads, followed by an elaborate entourage of courtiers, entertainers, 
soothsayers, concubines, ant1 sometimes the mummified remains of his ancestors.<p>Topa Inca's son, Huayna Capac, pushed the boundaries of his realm even farther north and ruled over the greatest period 
of Inca magnificence. But Huayna Capac died suddenly in 1524. Infighting over succession followed, spurred by the 
spread within the royal line of contagious diseases introduced by the earliest European explorers. These factors, coupled 
with a growing number of rebellious subjects throughout the far-flung Inca territories, rendered the empire particularly 
vulnerable to the armies of Francisco Pizarro in 1532. As soon as the Spaniards had disrupted the state's monolithic 
bureaucracy, the sun began to set on ancient South America's most spectacular civilization. </p>
<p>The most visible and enduring monuments of ancient South American civilization are indeed the marvels of engineering that 
helped tame the landscape and bridge the rivers of the Andean area. The earliest systems of irrigation canals eased the 
lives of settlers along the strip of desert coast, where the only sources of water were narrow rivers. In the highlands 
massive stone terraces transformed the steep Andean slopes into fertile fields. The most amazing achievements of 
engineering, however, are to be found in the roads, bridges, storehouses, fortified towns, and way stations built by the 
Incas. </p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Given the raw materials and tools available to them and their predecessors, these accomplishments seem almost miraculous. What they did achieve was largely due 
to their organizational abilities. Inca roads in the highlands were especially designed for the challenging terrain. Switchbacks scaled the steepest slopes, much like 
their modern counterparts. Sometimes paved with smooth stone, the throughfares were often supported by retaining walls that have lasted for more than 500 years. 
To bridge rivers, the Incas lashed balsa-reed boats together or built sturdy stone spans. The deepest ravines they conquered with the world's first known 
suspension bridges, swinging constructions of braided fiber and vine anchored to pillars on opposite sides of a chasm.</p>
<p>The anonymous Inca engineers achieved artistic immortality with the design of massive masonry walls that incorporated stones weighing more than 100 tons. The 
irregular but fastidiously finished blocks interlock so perfectly the joints between them appear as mere hairlines.Such walls make up fortresses of sophisticated 
military design, like Sacsahuaman on the outskirts of Cuzco, and temples whose remains lie undisturbed beneath modern towns. The stonework even provides the 
foundation for great cities like Machu Picchu, the spectacular outpost of Inca culture that still crowns its mountaintop site high above the turbulent Urubamba River. </p>

<hr>
<p>Traveling from Lima, the capital of Peru, along the Northern Pan-American highway, we can view the Bay of Ancon, the town of that name now convened into a 
modem seaside resort. Then continuing towards the Chancay Valley, rich in vestiges of the culture of the same name, and after passing through the provinces of 
Huacho and Barranca, we can admire Paramonga fortress, a monumental, pyramidal structure of mud which stands out on the landscape. Continuing on a modem 
highway northeastwards towards the Sierra, we reach the Cailejon de Huaylas, an immense valley situated between the snowcapped mountain range (Eastern 
cordillera) and the black rage (Western Cordillera). </p>
<p>This is a red paradise where tourists can view the highest and most beautiful of our mountain peaks, enjoy the lovely mountain valleys, the multicolored lakes, the 
perpetually snow-clad peaks and the hospitality of the inhabitants, always ready to exhibit the varied expressions of local popular culture. We shall also visit the city 
of Huaraz, in the museum of which exists the largest collection of monoliths of ancient cultures that once flourished in the region before the formation of the Inca 
Empire. We can also enter the temple of Wilcahuain and its passages and innumerable labyrinths, afterwards enjoying a relaxing bathe in the thermal medicinal 
waters of Monterrey or Chaiicos. In this same region is located Chavin de Huantar, cradle of the culture of the same name, which has left behind an impressive 
testimony of its greatness: the temple of Chavin where we can admire the &quot;Lanzon&quot; stone and the tenon heads. </p>
<p>Upon returning to the coast we can visit Sechin, ancient temple divided into upper and lower sections, the first corresponding to a pyramidal stone construction 
containing many monoliths, the second being of mud and earth, older than the first; this complex is located near the town of Casma. Continuing our trip northwards, 
we reach Chimbote, an important fishing port where the fish is industrialized and where the iron and steel industry is situated, processing ores for industry and 
construction. Pressing further northwards we come upon Trujillo (Capital of Spring) where we find colonial churches and mansions. </p>
<p>Close by is Chan Chan the largest mud city in the world, once the capital of the Great Chimu Empire. Likewise, close to Trujillo are located Huanchaco and 
Huanchaquito, fishing hamlets where we can see the &#145;caballitos de totora&#146; (literally: little reed horses) small boats made of a spongy sort of bullrush. These have 
served for fishing in this area since time immemorial. Further north we find Chiclayo, the point reached by the civilizations of Mochica and Chimu and where they 
left many vestiges of their advanced development in craftsmanship, mainly in gold and ceramics. This can be appreciated by making a visit to the Bruning Museum 
in the town of Lambayeque. </p>
<p>Proceeding onwards into the Andes, eastwards through the Porcuya Gap, we find Cajamarca with its beautiful countryside and extraordinary climate. The famous 
&#145;Ba&ntilde;os del Inca&#146; (Inca&#146;s Bath) is located here, the waters of which reach a temperature varying between 62&#146; and 74C. &#145;Me city preserves its ancient buildings with 
stone facades all making up its cultural and artistic heritage. Here, also, is to be found the colonial complex of &quot;Belen&quot; (Bethlehem) which consists of a temple, a 
convent and a hospital. It also houses a rich collection of colonial paintings and items of craftsmanship, outstanding amongst which are mirrors and picture frames 
made of painted glass. </p>
<p>On the border with Ecuador is located the department of Tumbes, 1,300 km. from Lima. Its climate is hot and sunny all year, the temperature ranging between 24&#146; 
and 360C in the course of the year. This area contains important archaeological remains such as &#145;Cabeza de Vaca&#146;4 km. to the south of the town of Tumbes, 
Plateros&#146;, &#145;Cabeza de Lagarto&#146; and Rica Playa&#146;. A variety of fine sandy beaches washed with warm waters offers the possibility of practicing different water sports 
in such places as: Puerto Pizarro, Jeli, La Cruz, Zorritos, Bonanza, Punta Mero, Cancas or Punta Sal, not forgetting Isla del Amor off Puerto Pizarro. </p>
<p>Taking to the sea we can indulge in deep-sea fishing. Back on land there are visits to the mangrove swamps containing impressive aquatic flora; boat trips through 
the inlets or a visit to Tumbes national forest, suitable for hunting activities and adventure trips especially between July and November; there are also several thermal 
baths such as: Hervideros, Tronco Mocho and Ucumares.</p>

is a series of intrigues, plots and disbelief by archeologists and the local community alike. Only after the apprehension, 
arrest, and standoff with police did the original huacaros or grave robbers give in to authorities. Their reason is easy to 
understand, they had taken more than twenty sacks of artifacts from what was a royal tomb with the remains of a man 
who would become known as the &quot;Lord of Sipan&quot;. Sales of the artifacts had already hit the international market as Dr. 
Alva began his preliminary excavations on the Moche culture site. Golden masks were selling for $100,000 and these 
were probably not the oldest pieces. Unfortunately the finest pieces will probably never be found and returned because 
of the worldwide market for Peruvian artifacts.</td></tr>

fishermen who raised avocados, corn, peanuts, beans and squash. They fished for clams and small coastal species, 
hunted deer and seals but kept a stockpile of domestic animals like Muscovy Ducks, Guinea Pigs, and Hairless Dogs. 
They had no written word but developed a highly sophisticated craft guild that produced some of the finest ceramics in 
the country. They built structures of clay and wood from the local Carob Tree. Some of the thousands of structures used 
over a million individual clay bricks, each one with the logo of its maker. Some structures were over 200 ft. high with 
platforms consisting of more than 4,000 sq. ft. They were successful for many reasons but their development of irrigation 
systems was unequaled. They had hundreds of miles of gravity fed canals that brought water from the Andes to the 
barren coastal plains and had reached their heights with more cultivated lands than even modern inhabitants until recently.</td><td width=18%><img src="images/pe_si2.jpeg" align=bottom width=240 height=170></td></tr>

<h3><a name="caja">CAJAMARCA</a></h3>
<p>Cajamarca is a Spanish town that hasn't changed a great deal since colonial times. It is set in a beautiful valley ideal for walking. The remains of several 
pre-Columbian civilizations dot the valley. Cajamarca's most famous landmark is the Cuarto de Rescata (Ransom Room) but far more interesting is the small 
museum in the education department of the university near Calle Revilla. It contains objects belonging to a pre-Inca society which flourished in the Cajamarca 
valley. Also worth seeing is the Museo de Arte Colonial in the Convento de San Francisco. Outside Cajamarca itself, the Banos del Inca- natural hot sulphur 
springs, where open air swimming pool and private baths are available. Cumbe Mayo, a pre-Inca sanctuary with caves attributing to the Chavin civilization, is 
located about 20 km outside of town. The artificial caves are interesting for their petrogliph cravings.</p>
<p>The Caxamarca culture developed on its fertile valley reaching its summit during 500-100 AD It was incorporated to the Tahuantinsuyo and later raised to be one 
of the major cities of the Empire and seat of the first encounter of two great cultures: the Inca and the Spanish in 1533. Inca Atahualpa was in Cajamarca when this 
meeting took place; (which later resulted in his death in spite of the ransom offered by him to fill the Ramson Chamber with gold and silver in exchange for his 
liberty). Famous in town is the<strong> Cuarto del Rescate</strong> (Ramson Chamber) &#151; Located half a block from the Plaza de Armas it is the only Inca remain left. This is the 
chamber where Atahualpa was imprisoned and offered Pizarro to fill it with gold and silver in exchange for his liberty. The room is about 7 m long by 6 m wide by 3 
m high. Outside the city are the <strong>Banos del Inca</strong> (Inca's Bath)&#151;Thermal fountains 6 km from the city. Its medicine waters have been in use since pre-lnca times. 
Atahulpa was resting in this resort when the Spanish arrived. </p>

<h3><a name="truj">TRUJILLO </a></h3>
<p>Trujillo is located in a green oasis with a background of Andean foothills and peaks. Founded by Pizarro in 1536. The city has many graceful old churches, colonial 
balconies and windows overhanging its modern streets. Trujillo is the gateway for interesting excursions including many burial grounds and pyramids (largest 
pre-columbian structures in South America) of the Mochica civilization. Nearby Chan Chan is the location of the greatest clay adobe city ever built. Trujillo was the 
imperial city of the Chimu civilization which stretched 1,000 kilometers along the coast from Ecuador into Peru. Huanchaco is located nearby Trujillo. The long 
narrow fishing rafts make from &quot;totora&quot; reeds are also worth seeing.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="piura">PIURA</a></h3>
<p>Piura, an oasis in the hot and parched desert, is a proud and historic city, 264 km from Chiclayo. Population 293000. Founded in 1532, three years before Lima, 
by the conquistadores left behind by Pizarro (whose statue is in the Parque Pizarro). There are two well kept parks, Cortes and Pizarro, and public gardens, old 
buildings are kept in repair and new buildings blend with the Spanish style of the old city. Its special dish is the delicious natillas, made mostly of milk and sugar. a 
few blocks from the Plaza de Armas, where the cathedral strands, is the San Francisco church, where the city's independence from Spain was declared on January 
4, 1821, nearly 8 months before Lima. The colonial church of Las Mercedes has ornately carved balconies, three-tiered archway, hand-hewn supports and 
massive furnishing. San Sebastian, on Tacna near Bolognesi, is also worth seeing. Birthplace of Admiral Miguel Grau, hero of the War of the Pacific with Chile, 
whose house Casa Museo Grau, on Jiron Tacna opposite the Centro Civico, has been opened as a museum; it contains a model of the Huascar, the largest 
Peruvian warship in the War of the Pacific, which was built in Britain. Interesting local craftwork is sold at the Model Market. Cotton has been grown mainly on 
medium-sized properties, which have changed hands frequently in recent years and which now form communal or cooperative farms, sponsored by the agrarian 
reform program. Worth seeing as an example of a fine old plantation is the former Hacienda Sojo, in the lower Chira valley, which was the center of the properties 
of the Checa family.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ancash">ANCASH</a></h3>
<p>Bearer of a great historical background, this region was the birthplace of different cultures. One of them was Chavin (1,200 BC.), whose influence spread over 
other regions and later cultures of ancient Peru. Another is the Recuay or Huaylas Culture, which developed here about 1,000 years ago and left us interesting 
ceramic artifacts and stone statues. Circa the 15th century, the Incas conquered this region and annexed it to their vast dominion. In 1533, Hernando Pizarro, one 
of the Spanish conquerors, found it on his way to Pachacamac. At present, Huaraz has turned into one of the most important tourist center in the country thanks to 
its archaeological remains. The principal archaeological attractions are:</p>
<p><strong>Chavin de Huantar </strong>&#151; Located at 3,177 m above sea-level and 102 km southeast of Huaraz (circa 80 km from the town of Catac to the South of Recuay). This 
important archaeological zone, where the Chavin Culture developed around 1,000 BC. was discovered by Julio C. Tello in 1919. It is a grand Pre-lnca 
archaeological stone ensemble made up of temples, squares and irrigation channels. There are also underground galleries; the famous monolith Lazon (larger spear) 
measuring 4 &#189; m high is found in the meeting point of two of these galleries.</p>
<p><strong>Sechin Archaeological Ensemble</strong>&#151; Just 7 km from Sechin on the left bank of River Sechin and on the turnoff to Huaraz, this 3,500 year-old archaeological 
zone houses stone walls, cemeteries, houses, deposits, irrigation channels and temples.</p>

<p>The central railway leads to the central sierra, via &quot;Galera&quot; the highest tunnel in the world (4,781 m.a.s.l.). We shall also pass La Oroya, the premier metallurgical 
center in the central region of the country. In the valley of the River Mantaro which rises near the town of Jauja we shall come upon the attractive lake of Paca, on 
the shores of which is the lodge for visitors. This is an attractive tourists venue and enjoys a pleasant climate. Continuing on our way we shall pass through 
numerous small villages, each with its ancient history and very rich popular lore, until we reach Tanna, a town enjoying a pleasant climate and where flowers are 
cultivated for export. </p>
<p>Taking the direction to the east, we descend to Chanchamayo and can visit also Oxapampa, Pozuzo &#145; and Villa Rica, San Ramon and La Merced all of which 
towns coffee and many varieties of exotic fruit are cultivated. From La Oroya there is also a branch of the highway which leads to the Pampa of Junin where one of 
the most crucial battles for the Independence of America took place. From there the road leads to Cerro de Pasco, Huanuco, the latter well-known for its mild, 
intermediate valleys; Tingo Maria, near to which town the Marginal Highway starts (high jungle are with hot climate) then on to Pucallpa in the middle of the jungle 
lying on the River Ucayali (the most important point of access for development of the Amazon jungle region). </p>
<p>From Jauja southwards one reaches Huancayo, capital of the department of Junin, an important trading center from time immemorial, then on to Huancavelica, a 
mining region. From Huancayo one can also travel to Ayacucho, known as the city of churches. It is outstanding for its hand-crafted goods, the manufacture of 
which is one of its principal activities: its figurines, triptychs, pottery, silver filigree work and myriad .mufti-colored textiles. </p>
<p>From Ayacucho one crosses into the department of Apurimac en route for Cusco, the main seat of the Quechua Empire (or Inca Empire), passing by a multitude of 
archaeological remains and high-altitude villages, over highways cut by hand from the rock, winding round chains of mountains. From Cusco one carries on 
southwards in order to reach Puno, town situated on Lake Titicaca (the highest in the world) dotted with islands of varying sizes. </p>
<p>This department is outstanding for its vast repertoire of folk-dances and for having been the seat of the Tiahuanaco Empire which preceded the Inca Empire and 
which covered much of Bolivia </p>

</td><td width=50%>Lima is situated in the central western region of Peru between the sea and the western cordillera of the 
Andes. It is home to more than 6 million inhabitants and has been the nation&#146;s capital since the Spanish 
Conquest, having been founded in 1535 by Francisco Pizarro. From that period in history still survive old 
mansions, churches and convents as well as the bullring Plaza de Acho, the third most ancient in the world; 
likewise the original building of the University of San Marcos, the oldest in America. Lima has grown and 
modernized; it has many excellent hotels and restaurants where one can savor both local and international 
dishes. It is important to note that Peruvian cooking is one offering an abundance of varied and exquisite 
dishes. As regards museums, the most outstanding are the Anthropological and Archaeological, the Larco 
Herrera, the Amano, and the Gold Collection. Neighboring Lima, the port of Callao has been prepared for 
reception of tourists on cruises. <p>Lima, Peru's capital, is overcrowded, polluted and noisy but, if you want to see the major archaeological 
finds it has a great selection of museums. Attractions include the Museo de Oro del Peru, which has 
numerous artifacts of gold, silver and precious stones, and the Museo Nacional de Antropolog&iacute;a y 
Arquelog&iacute;a, which is noted for its excellent exhibits of prehistoric Peru. Churches such as San Francisco

<h2><a name="cuzco">Cusco</a></h2>
<p>The archaeological capital of the Americas and the oldest continuously inhabited city on the continent, Cuzco is now an important link in the South American travel 
network. Its legacy as the hub of the Inca empire is readily apparent: most of the city streets are lined with Inca-built stone walls and crowded with 
Quecha-speaking descendants of the Incas. </p>
<p>The city has magnificent repositories of colonial art such as the cathedral (begun in 1559) and La Merced Church. There is also the Coricancha ruins, east of the 
city center, which were formerly covered with gold (the stonework is all that remains) and the Museo de Arqueol&oacute;gia, the interior of which is filled with metal and

<h3><a name="mp">MACHU PICCHU </a></h3>
<p>The Inca citadel of Machu Picchu (Old Mountain) lies 120 km. distant from Cusco city, situated on the summit of the mountain of the same name some 2,350 
m.a.s.l. on the Urubamba Canyon over from Huayno Picchu (Young Mountain). The whole archaeological complex covers approximately 5 square kms. As it is 
situated in the high jungle, its climate is semi-tropical, warm and humid. It is open every day from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm. </p>
<p>The archaeological Complex of Machu Picchu was revealed to the world in July 191 1 by Hiram Bingham professor at Yale University, U.S.A. Considered as one 
of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, it all makes up a complex of constructions located at different points of the Vilcanota cordillera, unique for 
their network of pathways or roads traditionally known as the Inca Highway. </p>
<p>The citadel of Machu Picchu has sectors clearly distinguishable amongst themselves, the agricultural zone (terraces) and the urban sector, divided by a dry ditch 
which takes advantage of a geological fault. The agricultural sector is made of numerous terraces. In this sector are 5 chambers having the characteristics of storage 
areas (Qolqas). The lookout post consisting of a building with three walls and windows, permits a panoramic view of the urban and agricultural areas. The upper 
cemetery and the rock on which ceremonial rites were performed have a space in which a person could perfectly well fit in a supine position. </p>
<p>Urban Sector.- This houses the most important architectural elements in this Inca city and has used granite for their construction. This sector is U-shaped and is 
subdivided into the religious sector including the Intihuatana, the Sacred Plaza some 60 m2 in area, on to the which the main religious-type buildings converge: the 
Temple of the Three Windows, Main Temple and Priest&#146;s House. To the south side are located the military buildings, thus named by Bingham and where there is a 
set of rooms of more simple construction and workshops on platform terraces. </p>
<p>Across from this whole group of buildings is Huaynapicchu (signifying in Quechua - small peak or mountain) a pyramid shaped peak so strategically located as to 
have almost certainly been used as a lookout post. It also houses archaeological groups constructed for different purposes such as the Temple of the Moon, built to 
take advantage of a geological fault; as well as a series of terraces which probably had esthetic-religious purposes because of their location. Access is by a narrow, 
steep path.For more information about <font size=4><strong>Machu Picchu</strong> </font><a href="per_mp.html"><font size=4><em><strong>click here</strong></em></font></a></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="inka">THE INKA TRAIL</a></h3>
<p>This is the path used by ancient Peruvians in order to gain access to the citadel of Machu Picchu. It has been recently included in tourist attractions and offers the 
possibility of seeing numerous Inca constructions which in conjunction with the natural surroundings, gives an integral idea of the grandeur and importance which 
Machu Picchu once enjoyed. This walk begins at km. 88 of the railway running to Machu Picchu, or from km. 77 on the same track at the village of Chillca. </p>
<p>The 34 or 45 km. respectively of walk can be done in from 3 to 5 days, depending on the physique of the visitor and on his interest in enjoying the geographical 
features surrounding him. One should carry good camping equipment as well as appropriate clothing for the varying climatic conditions. Once a start has been 
made, the first ruins to be reached are those at Liactapato (2,498 m.a.s.l.) then the path continues through the Cusichoca ravine until Wayllabamba (3,000 m.a.s.l.) 
is reached, where camp may be set up and the magnificent panorama enjoyed, especially if the sky is clear. </p>
<p>Continuing along the path, one hour&#146;s walk further on, we reach Sayaimarco (3,569 m.a.s.l.) and then continue towards the ruins of Phuyupatamorco (3,495 
m.a.s.l.), where the descent begins Winaywayna (2,568 m.a.s.l.), these ruins being strategically located some 6 kms. from final destination and approximately 2 
hours&#146;walk from Intipunku, the official main entrance into Machu Picchu.</p>

<hr>
<p>On the central coast south of Lima there are numerous beaches, many suitable for practicing sports such as surfing, water-skiing, sailing, etc. In the provinces of 
Caficte and Chincha one may enjoy the rhythms, dances and songs typical of Negro and ethnically mixed folklore. Then on to Paracas Bay where one of the most 
advanced ancient civilizations of this country, prior to the Inca Empire, had its seat. It is particularly outstanding for its weavings and ceramics as well as for its 
funeral rites. Very rich fauna also inhabits this area: both fish and sea-lions, turtles and innumerable species of bird.</p>
<p>Carrying on further south we reach Ica, with its excellent, dry climate; its well earned fame as a producer area of wines and &#145;pisco&#146;, made from the various kinds of 
gapes which grow on the sun-kissed land, and its wine harvest celebrated at the beginning of March. Ica has good hotels for accommodating visitors. 100 km. to 
the south is Nazca, known for its famous &#145;lines&#146; which have been declared part of the world&#146;s heritage. Here also a pre-Inca culture of the same name flourished, 
outstanding for its exquisite ceramics. </p>
<p>Thereafter, following the road south and leaving the coast for some distance, we arrive in Arequipa, lying at the foot of the volcano &#145;Misfi&#146;; this is a city 
well-endowed with churches, convents and mansions, the majority built or faced with &#145;sillar&#146; volcanic stone coming in light colors: white, cream, rosepink. 
Outstanding of the convents are Santa Catalina and Santa Clara and amongst the churches, that of the Company of Jesus, and innumerable mansions restored to a 
perfect state of repair. Very close to Arequipa is its &#145;campinia&#146; or typical countryside where one finds Sabandia Mill, the village of Tiabaya and the thermal baths at 
Yura. At its famous &#145;picanterias&#146; (country restaurants) one can sample the delicious regional dishes. Nearby attractions include the Colca Canyon, suitable for 
canoeing and the &#145;Valley of Volcanoes&#146;, several of which are active. </p>
<p>From Arequipa one returns to the coast in order to reach the southern departments of Moquegua and Tacna. In the first-mentioned lies the Cuajone copper 
deposit, considered the largest open-cast mine in the world. The department of Tacna borders on the Republic of Chile. The sierra region of these departments 
offers many archaeological remains, most likely initial settlements of the ancient Uros, one of the most ancient civilizations in America.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ica">ICA / PARACAS / NAZCA</a> </h3>
<p>This is an area with a long historical background. Its first dwellers are estimated to have lived there 10,000 years ago. Outstanding pre-lncaic cultures like Paracas, 
Nasca, Coastal Tiahuanaco and Ica developed there. </p>
<p>The most important ones are without doubt, Paracas (7th C BC. to 2nd C AD.), famous for its incomparable textiles, skull trephine and mummification; and Nasca 
(3rd to 8th C AD.), renown for its artistic ceramics of wonderful colors and designs, and of course, the Nasca Lines, the tracing of which still remains inexplicable 
up to date, arising diverse interpretations and theories. </p>
<p>The Nasca Culture also built underground aqueducts, which permitted them to farm in the deserts. In the 15th C, Inca Pachacutec conquered this area (Ica, Nasca, 
and the Valley of Chincha) and annexed it to his ample dominion.Years later, when the Spanish conquerors arrived, Captain Jeronimo Luis de Cabrera founded 
Villa de Valverde del Valle de Ica (1536) turning the whole area into an important viti-vinicultural and cotton center.</p>
<p><em><strong>PRINCIPAL ATTRACTIONS are:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chincha </strong>&#151; Located at km 202 Chincha was one of the most flourishing coastal oasis before the Spanish Conquest; the great number of 'huacas' (Indian 
burial flat top pyramids) found in this area can very well prove that it had been a prosperous town: the most outstanding is Huaca Centinela. </li>
<li><strong>Fortress of Tambo Colorado</strong> &#151; The Incaic ensemble&#146;s strategic position suggests that it might have been a control point for the entry of people coming 
down from the Andes.</li>
<li><a name="Paracas"><strong>Paracas</strong></a><strong> &#151; Paracas National Reserve</strong>, 250 km to the south of Lima has an area of 335,000 ha and is dedicated to the protection and preservation of 
animals threatened by extinction. There you find sea lions, Humboldt Penguins, flamingos, turtles, lizards and innumerable sea birds, fish and dolphins. Apart 
from the rich fauna, you can also find over5,000 year old archaeological remains. Its site museum houses interesting articles found during excavations in the 
area. </li>
<li><strong>El Candelabro or Tridente</strong> &#151; From Paracas, you can go to different offshore islands, especially isles Ballestas to observe the great variety of sea bird, sea 
lions and penguins. On the way to the islands, you can see 'El Candelabro' (The Chandelier) on the northern sand slope of the Paracas Peninsula&#151;a figure 
traced by low-relief.</li>
<li><strong>Ica</strong> is located 30 minutes south of Lima. It is known as the birthplace of &quot;pisco,&quot; the typical Peruvian grape brandy. Today it is also known as a wine center. 
It's a green oasis in the middle of huge rolling sand dunes along a desert coast. - In Ica, you should not miss the Regional Museum This important museum 
houses a vast collection of fossils, mummies and Paracas textiles, Nasca ceramics, as well as artifacts from the colony and Republic.</li>
<li><strong>The </strong><a name="Nasca"><strong>Nasca</strong></a><strong> Pampa</strong> measures about 500 sq. km and is renown for the mysterious lines traced on its desert floor. Nazca serves as the base from which to 
take fly-overs of the etchings. Gigantic etchings spanning some 52 square miles is a collection of etchings made by three different civilizations between 900 
BC and 630 AD. The lines were discovered by Toribio Mejia Xesspe in 1927 and since then have been studied by scientists and scholars like Paul Kosok, 
Hans Horkheirmer and Dr Maria Reiche, a German rnathemathician who has lived in the area for over 45 years to study the lines and try to relate the lines, 
the drawings and the constellations mathematically. However, up to the present, the meaning of these lines still remains unknown.</li>

<h2><a name="are">Arequipa</a></h2>
<p>Nicknamed the `white city', Arequipa is surrounded by spectacular mountains, including the volcano El Misti. A feature of the city is its many beautiful buildings 
made of a light-colored volcanic rock called sillar. The Convento de Santa Catalina, perhaps the most fascinating colonial religious building in the country, was, until 
recently, home to almost 450 nuns. Many of the city's beautiful colonial houses, such as Casa Ricketts, are now used as art galleries or museums. Accommodation 
and food is cheap and often provided in lovely locations. The Colca Canyon, arguably the world's deepest canyon, is a popular excursion from Arequipa.</p>
<p>Arequipa has an important historical background dating back to immemorial times {5000 6000 BC), testimony of which are its cave paintings and 400 
archaeological monuments registered up to now. When the Incas conquered this territory, they found two ethnic groups inhabiting the area of the Colca Valley: the 
Collaguas and the Cabanas. In spits of the short period of the Inca domination, Arequipa was undoubtedly and important supplier of agrarian products to the 
Empire. Proof of this are the terraces which can still be observed today. In 1540, the &quot;Villa Hermosa de Arequipa&quot;, was founded in the old district of San Lazaro. 
Being located in a telluric area, Arequipa overcame the ups and downs of nature during Colonial times. Adapted to its environment, learned how to get advantage 
of it admirably. </p>
<p>As a city, it survived in isolation when the route for the consignments of gold and silver from Potosi to Spain was changed, until 1870 when the train system arrived 
to put it back in contact with other cities of the coast and the highland'. The so called &quot;Ciudad Blanca&quot; (White City) named after its white buildings made of ashlar 
(Chachani's petrified volcanic ash) was a very important bastion of Peru's independence in the 19th C. </p>
<h3>PRINCIPAL ATTRACTIONS </h3>
<ul>
<li><font size=3><strong>The Cathedral</strong></font> - Built in 1656, this neo-Renaissance building is located in front of the Plaza de Armas. Built in ashlar, it has been reconstructed twice since 
its destruction by a fire in 1844 and an earthquake in 1868. What is worth mentioning is its monumental organ from Belgium and the wooden pulpit carved 
by the French artist Rigot in 1879.</li>
<li><strong>La Compania</strong> &#151; Ancient Jesuit church dating back to the 17th C. Its facade is admirably sculptured; its carved-wooden pulpit and the sacristy are real 
works of art. The cloister, &#189; a block from the church, has vaulted galleries and semicircular arches with columns sculptured in the most typical Arequipeno 
style. </li>
<li><strong>Santa Catalina Monastery</strong>&#151;This is the most important and astonishing religious monument in Peru. Founded in September 1580, under the avocation of 
St. Catherine of Siena, it was closed to the public until 1970. With an area of 20,464 square m, the Monastery has preserved almost intact its 16th and 17th 
C features. Inside the Monastery, visitors are guided by arrows through narrow streets, squares and gardens with Spanish names reminiscent of the old 
districts in Sevilla or Granada. You can visit the cloister of the orange tree painted in Indigo blue</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><a name="COLCA"><strong>COLCA</strong></a><strong> VALLEY AND ITS CANYON</strong> - The canyon is cleaved by the Colca river that appears on the upper part of the valley between two extinct volcanoes; 
Coropuna (642S m) and Ampato (6310 m), forming with some other zones of 3400 m the deepest canyon in the world. In 1954, Gonzalo de Reparaz informed 
about this canyon and studied it geographically. He explored the canyon by train and published some articles and photographs that brought about in the first 
expedition to explore the bottom of the canyon in June 1978. Dr. Arias, from Spain, guided the expedition in canoes and rafts with a group of Polish expeditioners 
that traveled for 17 days the swift flow of the river, naming the deepest and most important zones. At present the Colca Canyon is an important and dangerous 
challenge for river running and adventure tourism.</p>

<p align=center><a href="#puno">Puno</a> - | - <a href="#titi">Lake Titicaca</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Lake Titicaca, at 3820 metres, is the highest navigable lake in the world. At over 170 km long, it is also the largest lake in South America. Its altitude means the air 
is unusually clear and the azure waters particularly striking. Interesting boat trips can be made from Puno, the major port on the lake. The area is also known for its 
folk dances and huge herds of alpacas and llamas. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="puno">PUNO</a></h3>
<p>At 12,500 feet altitude, Puno sits on the shores of the highest navigable lake in the world, Lake Titicaca, from the depths of which the first Inca is supposed to have 
arisen and struck out to found the center of the empire. Reached by plane via Juliaca from Lima, or train from Cuzco and Arequipa, hotels provide comfortable 
overnight accommodations while discovering the area-including a boat ride on the Lake to visit the floating islands of the Uros Indians and the ancient graves of 
Sillustani. Puno was once the hub of one of the most important pre-lnca cultures, Tiawanaco, utmost expression of the ancient Ayamara people. </p>
<p>According to legend the first Inca Manco Capoc and his consort Mama Ocllo, emerged precisely from the waters of Lake Titicaca, charged by their father the Sun 
god to found an Empire or Tahuontinsuyo, which was composed of four regions or quarters, Puno occupying that of Collasuyo which extended over the whole of 
the Collao Plateau. When the Spaniards reached Cusco (mid- 16th C), they heard of the area's great mineral wealth, especially gold and silver. </p>
<p>Around 1660 the gory battles waged for possession of a rich mine in Laicota (one league from today's town of Puno) obliged the Viceroy Count of Lemos to travel 
to the area in order to bring about its pacification, which in turn lead to the founding (4th November 1668) of today's town of Puno. In their eagerness to catechize 
the native peoples, Spanish priests set up beautiful churches built with the imagination and by the hands of Puno artists; thus producing their own mestizo style. Juli 
became from the 17th century the Jesuits&#146; experimental center for missionaries destined for Paraguayan Missions and those for the Mojos in Bolivia. </p>
<p>It is also worthy of note that during the colonial years, the western shore of Lake Titicaca constituted an important means of communication between lima and 
Cusco to Potosi, the great silver producing center during the Peruvian vice-regal period. </p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>The main attractions in Puno are: </strong></font></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The cathedral</strong> dating from the 18th C. The cathedral's style is baroque and is a good example of local 'mestizo' architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Count of Lemos' Balcony</strong>. It is said that the Viceroy lodged here when he visited Puno in 1668.</li>
<li><strong>Dreyer Museum</strong>, exhibits a collection of ceramics, gold objects, textiles, stone sculptures both from the pre-lnca and Inca periods. It also has a collection 
of coins and documents referring to the history of the Spanish founding of the city of Puno. <hr>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="titi"><font size=4><strong>Lake Titicaca</strong>,</font></a> the highest navigable lake in the world, at 3,808 mt, approximately 8,100 sq.kms. in area, 194 km. long and having an average width of 65 
km. In the parts of the lake where its depth is over 25 m. its waters are blue and in the shallower areas it is transparent and green in hue due to the presence of 
aquatic plants. It is home to extraordinary fauna such as: flamingoes, duck; fish such as &quot;suche&quot;, &quot;capache&quot; and trout which has found the Lake to be a great habitat. 
As for flora, the 'totora' (a kind of cat-tail or red mace) abounds here and serves as a food both for people and cattle and as construction material for houses, rafts, 
etc. From the river port at Puno town interesting excursions may be made to the Uros islands. It is said that the inhabitants of these islands descend from one of the 
most ancient peoples of America. Their dwellings sit on the surface of Lake Titicaca. Click here for more information on<a href="titicaca.html"><font size=4> Lake Titicaca </font></a></p>

<h1 align=left><font color="#008080"><img src="images/bx_lam.gif" align=bottom width=72 height=72> PERU - THE AMAZON BASIN</font></h1>
<p align=center><a href="#iqui">Iquitos</a> - | -<a href="#pt_mal"> Puerto Maldonado </a>- | - <a href="#pulla">Pullacpa </a>- | - <a href="#manu">Manu Reserve </a>- | - <a href="per_amlo.html">Lodges around Iquitos </a>- | - <a href="per_amcr.html">Amazon Cruises </a></p>
<hr>
<p>Situated in the Eastern area of the country, this is the most extensive but with the lowest population. Its thick jungle contains an infinite variety of exotic plants and 
an unending variety of wild animals. It is crisscrossed by innumerable streams and rivers, the largest of these being the Ucayali and the Maranon which join to form 
the Amazon, the mightiest in the world. </p>
<p>The most important towns in the Amazon region are:<strong> Iquitos, Pucallpa, Tarapoto, Yurimaguas, Contamana, Nauta </strong>and <strong>Puerto Maldonado</strong>. Chachapoyas 
and Moyobamba lying higher up in the high jungle should also be mentioned. At all are to be found modem lodges or comfortable hotels, as also palm-thatched 
wooden cabins which fit in with the landscape. </p>
<p>There are many interesting places for the visitor such as the ancient city of Cuelap, all stone-built and surrounded by a huge wall; there are also traces of a stone 
road. Near to Tarapoto, the village of Lamas constitutes a curiosity for ethnologists and anthropologists due to certain characteristics of its ancient inhabitants. </p>
<p>Climate in all of this area is hot and humid with abundant rainfall between December and April, the showers being more intermittent between May and November. 
The aboriginal inhabitants of the Amazon still live in a fairly primitive state, being a semi-nomadic people. They mainly live from hunting, fishing and gathering fruit. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="pt_mal">PUERTO MALDONADO</a></h3>
<p>On the eastern slopes in the &quot;Selva&quot; or jungle, Puerto Maldonado is easily reached by plane from Lima via Cuzco. It is the entry point into the vast, still largely 
unspoiled Madre de Dios with three superb jungle preserves Manu National Park, Tambopata Wildlife Reserve and Rio Heath Pampas Sanctuary. Within the 
Tambopata Wildlife Reserve are two jungle lodges providing an up close opportunity for viewing the 547 species of birds, 1,100 species of butterflies, 150 species 
of dragonflies and mammals such as the giant otter.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="pulla">PULLACPA </a></h3>
<p>Pullacpa is located 533 nautical miles from Iquitos. Pullacpa is a rapidly expanding jungle town and capital of the new Department of Ucayali. There are several 
well run jungle lodges nearby which offer a close up look at the jungle. Picturesque Lake Yarinacocha with the Moroti-Shobo Indian market is the main attraction, 
but excursions into the jungle and along the river are easily arranged. The town is accessible by plane from Lima (1 hour) and Iquitos (20 minutes).</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="manu">MANU</a></h3>
<p>Because it protects an entire virgin watershed, from Andean grasslands, elfin forests, and cloud forests to high and low elevation rainforests, the Manu Biosphere 
Reserve is the most important rainforest park in the world. The Reserve, which is half the size of Switzerland and span elevations from 1,000 feet to 11,500 feet 
above sea level, boasts world record diversities of birds (more than 1000 species), mammals (more than 200 species), reptiles, amphibians, fresh water fishes, 
insects, and plants (over 15,000 species). </p>
<p>No other park on earth can compare with Manu in terms of sheer variety of life forms. A patch of lowland rainforest in Manu harbors 40% more species of birds 
than a comparable patch of forest in central Amazonian Brazil. Furthermore, no other area in North or South America offers such superb viewing of rare or difficult 
to observe animals, such as two meter long giant otters, numerous large and small species of monkeys (1 3 species), white and black caimans (crocodiles), seven 
species of macaws (the world&#146;s largest parrots),ten species of toucans, guans, curasows, and trumpeters (rare game birds), and the largest land animal in Central or 
South America the Tapir. Finally, Manu offers the best chance on earth to see a wild Jaguar; approximately one in ten tourist groups spots this beautiful cat. If you 
have only one opportunity to visit the jungles of the Neotropics and you want to see many large and small animals as well as a record-breaking variety of tropical 
plants, then Manu is your best choice. </p>
<p>Because of the exciting wildlife viewing afforded by river travel in Manu, all good itineraries in Manu include at least several hours to several days of motorized boat 
travel on the Manu River and/or on the Alto Madre de Dios River. For speedy access to the wildlife rich lowland parts of the Reserve, a hard gravel airstrip at the 
mouth of the Manu River is a mere 45 minutes by small twin-engine plane from either Cusco or Puerto Maldonado.The most important and rewarding habitats for 
viewing animals and plants in Manu are the banks and beaches of the Manu River itself (viewed best from your large motorized canoe), the water and banks of the 
many oxbow lakes in the flood-plain of the meandering Manu River, the forest along the trails in mature flood-plain and upland forest along the lower Manu, and 
the high elevation cloud forests in the narrow Cusco-Shintuya road. </p>
<p>This road offers what many biologists and birdwatchers consider to be the world&#146;s most thrilling transect of habitats from lowland forest to mountain grasslands. 
With dramatic mountain scenery as a backdrop, the colorful tanagers, Cock-of-the-Rocks, hummingbirds, Andean quetzals, orchids, and even occasional Woolly 
Monkeys or Spectacled Beards provide an unparalleled tropical Andean experience.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="iqui">IQUITOS</a></h2>
<p>Peru's main city on the Amazon. Iquitos is 2,300 miles from the Atlantic Ocean. Several hotels in town provide accommodations while visiting the town and the 
&quot;floating suburbs of Belen.&quot; A variety of jungle lodges are found 1 to 4 hours away. Cabanas with private bath to more rustic shelters which offer a camping style of 
facilities are available for one or more nights. Short camping treks can be arranged and expedition style boats for 4-12 persons provide multi-day in-depth visits 
into the many tributaries, creeks and channels. Indians that can be visited depend entirely upon how far you travel in the jungle, but nearby you can generally visit 
the Yagua and Jibaro tribes: deeper in are the Uuitotos and Shipibos.</p>
<p>In the rainforest surrounding Iquitos we have only 2 &quot;seasons&quot;. From about December-May, it is considered &quot;high water&quot; season and from June-November, &quot;low 
water&quot; season. The river rises due to melting of snow and ice from the mountains during the summer and from rain during the rainy season in the upper jungle. Low 
water occurs during winter in the mountains when precipitation is held in ice and snow and during the upper jungle's dry season. The water level of the Amazon can 
change as much as 45 feet between high and low water although the climate is relatively constant. </p>
<p>Our daytime high temperature is about 88&#176; F and nighttime low about 72&#176; F with relatively constant high humidity. It rains between 200-250 days during the year, 
usually a good hard rain of short duration, and occurring at any hour of the day and at any time of the year. We offer more walking excursions during &quot;low water&quot; 
season and more boating excursions during &quot;high water&quot; season, but at any time of the year there is a good mixture of both!</p>

<p align=left>Landlocked Bolivia is the Tibet of the Americas - the highest of the Latin American republics and the most Indian country on the continent, with over 50% of the 
population maintaining traditional Indian values and beliefs. Bolivia may be one of the poorest countries in South America, but its indigenous cultures, the 
mind-blowing Andean landscapes, and the remnants of mysterious ancient civilizations make it the richest and most exciting destination for adventurous and 
independent travelers. 30% Quechua Indian, approx. 28% mestizo, 25% Aymar&aacute; Indian, approx. 10% European (principally Spanish) Languages: Spanish but 
most Indians speak either Quechua or Aymar&aacute;; composite dialects of Spanish-Aymar&aacute; and Spanish-Quechua are also widely spoken. Bolivia is the fifth-largest 
country on the continent with five geographical regions: the highly populated Altiplano, a 3500-meters-high plateau stretching from the Peruvian border north of 
Lake Titicaca to the Argentine border; the highland valleys, south and east of the Altiplano with near optimum climatic conditions and fertile soils; the Yungas, the 
transition zone between the icy peaks of the Andes and the steamy Amazonian forest; the Chaco, a hot, dry, impenetrable and uninhabited plain along the 
Paraguayan and Argentine borders; and the underdeveloped swamps, savannas and rainforest of the Amazonian Basin. With its extreme geographical variations, 
Bolivia has a wide range of climatic patterns. Generally, temperatures are cool, with the rainy period extending from November to March in most of the country. 
The cities of La Paz and Potos&iacute; often experience very cold temperatures and sometimes snow, while the Altiplano region is prone to severe flooding. During the dry 
period the climate is pleasant, though clear skies can cause night-time temperatures to drop. In the lowlands, the weather is hot and sunny, with the occasional 
cloudburst helping to cool things down.</p>
<p align=left>Musical traditions within Bolivia are distinctly regional: strains of Andean music from the desolate Altiplano are suitably haunting and mournful, while those of 
warmer Tarija, with its compliment of bizarre musical instruments, take on more ebullient tones. Dances such as the cueca, auqui-auqui and tinku hold a reverent 
place in popular culture. Other forms of folk expression include spinning and weaving, which display regional differences but have changed little over the last 3000 
years.</p>

</td><td width=50%>Sucre, the constitutional capital of Bolivia, is a living expression of both colonial and modern times. The Cathedral, churches and 
cloisters of La Recoleta, San Felipe and Guadalupe, the House of Liberty, where Simon Bolivar signed the Declaration of 
Independence, the Be]1 of Freedom at San Francisco cloister, the second oldest university in South America, San Francisco 
Xavier, as well as the university Museum offer fine examples of anthropological research, colonial and modern art.</td></tr>

<tr><td width=50%>At three hours' drive from Sucre, you reach Potosi, the famous colonial city, source of silver during colonial times. The rich 
mountain towers over the city, and according to legend, it has produced enough silver to build a solid silver bridge from Potosi to 
Madrid. The Cathedral, the church of San Francisco and The Casa de la Moneda (Royal Mint), with its wooden machinery 
used to make the silver coins for Spain during the colony, are the main local attractions. Potosi was also declared by UNESCO:

</td><td width=50%>La Paz, the highest capital city in the world, looks like a moon crater. The city is four km above sea level, situated on a canyon 
floor which shows only a hint of greenery. Even oxygen is at a premium. People congregate around the splendid Iglesia de San 
Francisco (construction began in 1549) with its arresting blend of mestizo and Spanish styles. Behind the church is the 
Witches' Market where you can buy a bizarre assortment of goods including amulets, potions, delicately crafted silver jewelry, 
sweets and dried llama fetuses. La Paz also has a number of museums, including the Museo Costumbista Juan de Vargas, 
which contains some superb dioramas of the city, and the Museo de Metales Preciosos Pre-Columbinos, which houses three 
impressively presented salons of pre-Conquest silver, gold and copper works. Standing guard over all this is Illimani (6460 
meters), some 60 km to the east, which is arguably Bolivia's most famous peak. </td></tr>

species of animals and exotic birds can be seen at the local zoo. Luxurious hotels, casino, restaurants and night clubs offer ~ 
wide variety of entertainment. On the outskirts of Santa Cruz, you will find yourself surrounded by tropical vegetation and the 
typical agriculture of the area. Mennonites and Japanese settlements, as well as some primitive tribes give a special flavor to this 
area. At only one and a half hours' drive from Santa Cruz, you reach the ruins of Samaipata, where you can see strange carvings 
on a giant rock representing a snake and many other enigmatic figures, which generate countless archaeological debates, and 
have inspired Erick Von Daenicken in his extraterrestrial theories.</td><td width=14%><p align=center><img src="images/bo_scr.jpeg" align=bottom width=187 height=117></p>

<h3 align=left><a name="cocha">Cochabamba</a></h3>
<p align=left>Called &quot;The Garden of Bolivia&quot; and reputed to have the world's most perfect climate and Bolivia's most hard-core drinkers, the city of Cochabamba occupies a 
fertile green bowl in a landscape of fields and low hills. The city, founded in 1574, is Bolivia's largest market town and was once the nation's granary. The native 
market (La Cancha) the Anthropological Museum the Palace of Portales Patino's home (the king of tin) La Coronilla the weavers' cooperatives and the residential 
areas are its highlights. It is still prosperous and progressive, and has a clutch of historical and archaeological attractions, including the 400-year-old cathedral and 
the Convento de Santa Teresa. - At three hours from Cochabamba is Chaparez a tropical area of great panoramic beauty (waterfalls, orchids' and luxuriant 
vegetation) </p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="titi">Lake Titicaca</a></h3>
<p align=left>Traditionally regarded as the highest navigable body of water in the world (in reality there are higher lakes in Chile and Peru), Lake Titicaca is immense: its 
dimensions measure 233 km from north-west to south-east and 97 km from north-east to south-west. The lake has an indented shoreline, 36 islands and 
exceptionally clear sapphire-blue water. Titicaca is revered by the Indians who live on its shores, and the Islas del Sol and Islas de la Luna, two islands in<br>
the lake, are the legendary sites of the Inca's creation myths. The main town in the area is Copacabana, which has a sparkling white Moorish-style Cathedral and is 
host to the Fiesta de la Virgen de Candelaria. Isla Suriqui is world-renowned for its totora reed boats; Isla Kalahuta for its stone tombs; and Isla Incas is reputed in 
legend to have an underground network of passageways linking it to the old Inca capital of Cuzco in Peru. Travelers should wear protective headgear around the 
lake because the thin air results in scorchingly high levels of ultraviolet radiation. Half of the lake lies within the borders of Peru; Puno is the principal settlement and 
main center for excursions on the Peruvian shore of the lake. <a href="titicaca.html"><em><strong>Click here for more information on Lake Titicaca</strong></em></a></p>

<h3 align=left><a name="salar">Salar De Uyini</a></h3>
<p align=left>This 12,000-sq.-km saltpan at an altitude of 3650 meters was once part of a prehistoric salt lake which covered most of south-western Bolivia. Although estimated 
to contain 10 billion tons of fine salt reserves, the only harvesters of this resource are the local campesinos armed with nothing more than picks and shovels. Isla de 
Pescadores, in the middle of the saltpan, has spectacular stands of cactus and is home to a stranded colony of vizcachas (long-tailed rodents related to the 
chinchilla). The village of Uyini, south-east of the saltpan, is the best base for excursions. North-west of Salar de Uyini is the Salar de Coipasa, on whose northern 
shore is a unique Chipaya Indian village. Residents of this village may be descendants of the lost Tiahuanaco civilization. If you travel this far off the beaten track, be 
sensitive to local culture; photography of people in this region is discouraged.</p>
<h3 align=left><a name="l_col">Laguna Colorada</a></h3>
<p align=left>This fiery, red lake in the far south-west of Bolivia is in a remote highland area surrounded by a surreal treeless landscape spotted with gentle hills that resemble spilt 
chocolate sundaes. Birdwatchers will be particularly interested in the rare James' flamingos which inhabit the lake. Temperatures drop below -20 degrees Celsius, 
but the bitterly cold air is heavily perfumed with the scent of yareta - a shrub used as a fuel. Fifty km south of the lake is the 4800-meters-high Sol de Ma&ntilde;ana, 
where a geyser, bubbling mud pools and hellish fumaroles fart and belch stinky sulfurous fumes into the fresh mountain air.</p>
<h3 align=left><a name="l_ver">Laguna Verde</a></h3>
<p align=left>This stunning blue-green lake situated at an elevation of 5000 meters is tucked into the south-western corner of Bolivia, almost 100 km from Sol de Ma&ntilde;ana. 
Behind the lake rises the 5930-meters cone of Volc&aacute;n Licancabur, whose summit shelters an Incan crypt. If you get goose-bumps up here, it may not just be the 
weather. Young Inca men were marched to the summit without protective clothing and forced to freeze to death as a sacrifice to the gods. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PUNO</strong> - The Peruvian main town near Lake Titicaca is remarkable for its churches, gold and silver, and colonial style craftsmanship.</li>
<li><strong>KALAUTA ISLAND </strong>- Visit a stone village with two and three stories high-ChulIpas (Mortuary towers). This sacred place is the largest Necropolis in the

<p align=left>According to metaphysical laws, there are two main sources of power on earth: 'Male and Female&quot;. This concept is considered relevant, since it represents the two 
antagonistic meanings of life. Good and Bad, Night and Day, Light and Dark, the Physique and Psychic, emphasizing the complete circle of nature representing the 
two faces of our daily existence. During thousands of years, these two main sources, characterized by two magnetic rays, have been in the HIMALAYAS (Tibet)</p>
<p align=left>Now we are under the Page of Aquarius, the source of power has moved from Tibet (Northern Hemisphere - Male) to LAKE TITICACA &quot;The Central Vertex of 
Cosmic Energy&quot; (Southern Hemisphere - Female). Six different levels of spirituality (and cultures) arose in the Northern Hemiphere (Egypt, Babylon, Tibet, etc.) 
under the &quot;Male&quot; sign. Now this seventh level is for the first time in the Southern Hemisphere under the &quot;Female&quot; energy sign: the Pachamama. According to ancient 
prophecies, a new beginning commences and the Pachacuti in the Andes represents the &quot;awakening&quot; of a new and better world.</p>
<p align=left>From now on, the positive energy of the world will be generated by Lake Titicaca, while serenity will be kept by the Himalayas. It is said that most of the problems 
the world has been through, have been impelled by a lack of equilibrium, and the dramatic changes in the last years are supporting this theory: The time of joy for 
mankind has finally arrived with the harmony of this shared balance of power.</p>
<h2 align=left>THE ANDEAN AWAKENING - &quot;PACHACUTI&quot;</h2>
<p align=left>The Shallot Cross is the sign of the Aymara religious identity: it outlines are living space in unity. It's center is the &quot;Taypi&quot;, the core of Aymara spiritual existence. In 
the center of the Shallot Cross is the Pachamama (Mother Hearth) together with the Achachilas or Mallcus (Sacred Mountain Souls) acting as creative forces. The 
Pachamama controls everything and harmonizes all opposites: the &quot;Above&quot; with the sun, moon, rain, stars, thunder and winds - the &quot;Below&quot; where evil spirits live 
represented by earthquakes and lack of land fertility. From all this stems the basis of the Andean cosmovision based on 3 elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Alajpacha </strong>- a supreme identity representing the &quot;Above All&quot; (God)</li>
<li><strong>The Acapacha</strong> - the space in which we find ourselves sharing together with the Pachamama </li>
<li><strong>The Manqhapacha</strong> - the inside space which represent destructiveness and physical death </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="kalla">THE KALLAWAYAS Legend and Science</a></h2>
<p>Northwest of sacred Lake Titicaca live the Kallawayas, healers and masters of natural medicine. The Kallawayas know how to treat the body and the mind. 
Kallawayas legend says that their healing powers come from Achachila, the soul of one of the snowcapped peaks of the Andes, the sacred Akamani. The 
Kallawayas were among the first to use penicillin, streptomycin and quinine and they knew more than 200 plants and natural products to aid in healing. The 
mysterious Coca leave has been used by the natural medicine for thousand of years: it has vitamins and minerals and a unique effect on hunger control or potent skin 
treatment elements The Kallawayas were also among the earliest healers to adopt preventive medicine techniques focusing on spiritual health and strength through 
mysticism and ancient methods. In Bolivia natural medicine is legally recognized and Bolivians who follow the Kallawayas' natural traditions are strong and healthy. 
Today modern </p>
<p><strong>THE MYSTIC WORLD OF THE KALLAWAYAS</strong>, These natural medicine doctors of Bolivia, are authorized by law to practice medicine like any other MD. 
They were using Penicillin, Terramycin and Quinine many centuries ago and they believe that you first have to heal the soul in order to heal the body. Due to their 
wisdom of nature's secrets, Bolivia was declared the cradle of natural medicine (Natural Medicine World Congress, Mexico, 1988~. After the night visit, of its 
mystic world(1 the Kallawaya of our community, Tata Lorenzo, will bless visitors performing a ChalIa (Tribute to Mother Earth &quot;Pacha Mama&quot;) and could tell their 
future by casting his sacred coca leaves. This living museum has received international awards as well as constant feedback from our visitors who, among other

waterways and abundant life of the Antarctic Peninsula, best-known region of the 
White Continent. Even today this land, just 600 miles south across the Drake Passage 
from South America, remains a world apart a majestic last frontier. </h3>
<p>These are voyages of discovery to a land where Adelie Penguins tend their fast-growing young, Gentoos squabble 
over pebbles at the nest and Chinstraps perform ecstatic displays for their faithful mates. Marauding Skuas and 
watchful Sheathbills patrol the busy penguin rookeries. Elephant seals haul themselves ashore at rocky beaches 
strewn with ice and Weddell seals search out snow banks to rest after their long dives. Asleep on drifting ice floes, 
leopard and crabeater seals barely take notice of us. We offer the most comprehensive program to the Antarctic 
Peninsula aboard three thoroughly comfortable ice-reinforced vessels. All are led by a diverse team of outstanding 
expedition leaders and naturalists/lecturers. Our experienced Russian captains are recognized as world experts in ice 
navigation. Sturdy Zodiac landing crafts take us almost anywhere in this land without docks or piers. </p>
<p>We travel at the height of the short austral summer, the few short months when the magnificent Antarctic waterways 
are open to navigation and its rocky headlands are crowded with life. In addition, two departures also include the 
wonders of the Falkland Islands and extraordinary South Georgia, home to an astounding concentration of wildlife. 
All voyages feature 06 days in Antarctica (Peninsula and South Shetland Islands), enabling travelers enough time to 
fully enjoy the many unique experiences these areas offer. With ice-strengthened hulls and sophisticated satellite 
navigation equipment, the Professor Khromov, Akademik loffe and Alla Tarasova are all outstanding expedition 
vessels, sailing with ease high latitude waterways that are closed to larger vessels. We have the luxury of small shore 
parties, the best way to experience the wonders of the last great continent. And our program is flexible&#151;allowing us 
to take advantage of unexpected opportunities. We explore this remote and fragile world in a fully 
environmentally-responsible manner, leaving no mark on one of the last great wild places on Earth. </p>

<h3><a name="expl">&#160;EXPLORING ANTARCTICA</a></h3>
<p>No two Antarctic voyages are alike and our actual programs vary to take best advantage of weather and ice conditions. Our captains and expedition leaders have 
the freedom to follow the course of nature so you can experience a pod of passing whales, or a newly-calved iceberg. With years of experience, our adventurous 
expedition team discovers new sites every season. Weather permitting, expect to see more of Antarctica aboard our vessels and with our staff. Our experienced 
Zodiac drivers get you ashore safely and efficiently. </p>
<p>We offer voyages aboard three different expedition vessels of 10, 12 and 19 days. In addition, the rates for each of our departures include 2 nights in Buenos 
Aires. We travel with at most 100 fellow passengers and one of our vessels carries just 36. These are in-depth voyages of discovery. All our departures feature 
4-6 days exploring the Antarctic Peninsula the most accessible and celebrated region of Antarctica. The 19-day expeditions also include South Georgia and the 
Falkland Islands. We allow enough time on our voyages to fully appreciate the wonders of this little-visited part of the world. </p>

Cruising south through the Gerlache Strait, Neumayer Channel and other scenic waterways, we enjoy a spectacle of icebergs, glaciers and 
rugged mountains. Here are some places we plan to visit:<br>
<strong>South Shetland Islands</strong><br>
Places such as King George Island, Elephant Island and Livingston Island support huge numbers of nesting Chinstrap, Gentoo and Adelie 
Penguins. Mosses, lichens and Antarctica's two flowering plants thrive during the short summer on the low-lying peninsulas of these rugged 
maritime islands. We explore the busy penguin rookeries and marvel at the huge elephant seals that wallow along the shore. We sail into the 
flooded caldera at Deception Island, an active volcano called &quot;one of the most remarkable crater islands in the world.&quot; Climbing up the 
slopes of Half Moon Island, we encounter one of the oldest research stations and busy Chinstrap Penguins. We follow the Bransfield Strait 
south to the Continent.<br>
<strong>Gerlache Strait</strong><br>
Aboard the Belgica in 1899, Frederick Cook wrote &quot;the scores of islands that dot the virgin waters are inhabited by countless millions of 
penguins and cormorants, while great numbers of seals are in evidence on every accessible rock or ledge of ice.&quot; We retrace his voyage 
through the Gerlache Strait, where humpback and mink whales are abundant. Several thousand Gentoo Penguins wait for us under dramatic 
lichen-clad cliffs on the icebound shores of Cuverville Island. Kelp Gulls, Sheathbills, Antarctic Terns, Wilson's Storm Petrels and Antarctic 
Blueeyed Shags nest along the rocky shores.<br>
<strong>Antarctic Peninsula</strong><br>
We sail into Paradise Bay on the Danco Coast, where a series of glaciers flows from the 10,000-foot Foster Plateau into quiet waters. 
Zodiacs take us along dramatic cliffs dense with nesting Cape Petrels, Antarctic Blue-eyed Shags, Kelp Gulls and Antarctic Terns. From 
the bridge we keep watch for whales and groups of seals on the ice. We push south through Lemaire Channel to Petermann Island, where 
Jean Baptiste Charcot overwintered in 1901 aboard the Pourquoi Pas.</td></tr>

<h3 align=left><a name="gen">GENERAL INFORMATION</a></h3>
<p align=left>Located south of Mexico, Guatemala's mountains, valleys and lowlands give the country its own range of climates and great biodiversity. Nearly twothirds of the 
country is mountainous, the most dramatic chain of mountains being a continuation of the Sierra Madre, parallel to the Pacific coast and reaching heights of 12,000 
feet. There are lush, tropical rain forests in the north and rich and fertile plains to the south. There are over thirty active or dormant volcanoes, most in the Western 
Highlands. Although there is some regional variation, Guatemala has two basic seasons: rainy, from May to October and dry, from November to April. The 
average temperature is a moderate 75 degrees F (in Guatemala City, the temperature ranges from 17 to 23C (35.6 to 71.4F), In other places the climate depends 
on the time of the year and the altitude. but the lowland area of El Pet&eacute;n in the north is always hot. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="over">An Overview</a></h3>
<p>Guatemala is a nation rich in history, famed for its friendly people, native arts and crafts, natural beauty and vast diversity of wild life. Northernmost and most 
populous of the Central American republics, the country is bordered by Mexico, Belize, Honduras and El Salvador, a rugged highland with high mountains that 
extend east and west. Deep canyons slice through the high country, divide north from south by the valley of the Motagua River, which flows into the Caribbean. 
Each of Guatemala&#146;s several regions has distinctive climatic, topographical, economic and sociological features:</p>
<p>The warm humid and sparsely populated strip of jungle bordering the Pacific coast is about 30 miles wide by 200 miles long. There is some cattle ranching and 
bananas, sugar, rice and tropical fruits are grown in the area. Further inland, along the mountain slopes is the Pacific Piedmont, with swift streams and rich volcanic 
soil making it the most productive agricultural area. Cotton and sugar are grown on the lower slopes and coffee in the temperate zone above 2,000 feet.</p>
<p>Mountains soar to 9,000 feet in the temperate Western Highlands that surround the city of Quezaltenango. The mostly Indian population of this area raise limited 
crops of corn, beans and wheat on the mountain slopes. Elevations vary from 1,500 to 4,000 feet in the Eastern Highlands, a subtropical to tropical area of 
relatively limited rainfall, where agriculture is limited to subsistence farming and some ranching. The North Central region along the eastern slopes of the 
Cuchumatanes plateau, with its abundant rainfall, cooler climate and ample supply of labor is the nation&#146;s primary coffee production area with some light industry 
centered around the city of Coban.</p>
<p>The Peten, Guatemala&#146;s northern panhandle, is covered by rain forests and occasional humid savannas. The region comprises a third of the country&#146;s total area but 
is home to only a tiny fraction of the population. It resembles parts of Brazil&#146;s Amazon basin, producing hardwoods, chicle and rubber. Guatemala&#146;s visitors have a 
unique opportunity to combine explorations of the nation&#146;s famed Maya ruins with natural history tours through incredible rain forests and jungles that abound in 
birds and other wildlife as well as unique tropical flora. The restored pyramids and temples pay silent tribute to the Maya civilization which first appeared more than 
3,000 years ago. The complex Maya society is evident in the impressive structures and ruins of Guatemala&#146;s Tikal, Rio Azul, Uaxactun and Piedras Negras. 
Reminders of Maya culture can also be found at Zaculeu in Guatemala&#146;s western highlands and Quirigua in the Motagua Valley which offer magnificent examples of 
the Post or Late Classic Mayas. For reasons still unknown the Maya civilization declined sharply after 900 A.D. and by the time the Spanish conquistadores 
arrived in the 16th century, little remained of a once great culture.</p>
<p>Tikal, for example, with its splendid pyramids and temples is the largest and most important of the archaeological sites, is situated in the midst of a 576 square 
kilometer protected park that is home to 220 resident bird species. Four of the species are considered endangered, including four nesting pairs of the Harpy Eagle. 
Among the other more dramatic appearing birds seen in the area is the Keelbilled toucan with its bright yellow green, orange, red, white and black coloration and 
banana like bill. This is also the best area to see the Oscillated Turkey, a close relative to the wild turkey of North America and almost as large. Vivid in color, with 
a blue featherless head and neck, orange skin flaps and gold body with bronze and aqua highlights.</p>
<p>Economic importance in the Caribbean lowlands at the mouth of the Motagua River and around Lake Izabal centers on large banana plantations the production of 
fruits and vegetables and the commercial port of entry at Puerto Barrios.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="cos">Colorful Guatemala</a></h3>
<p>No other place in the world is as colorful and hospitable as Guatemala. Color is everywhere, from lush, green foliage, tranquil blue lakes, to the multicolored 
costumes of the inhabitants. Add to this setting a background of 8-million smiles, as seen in the faces of Guatemala&#146;s people, and you now have the picture... a 
paradise of color and of friendship. The typical rural Guatemalan family is quite industrious, with males generally working the fields while the females take care of 
the family. Everyone, including grandparents, become involved with the hand crafting of exquisitely embroidered textiles and meticulously carved masks and 
figurines. Each piece is unique and indigenous to the area in which it&#146;s made. Professional or tradesman, artisan, storekeeper or farmer, the Guatemalan is ever 
ready to share his smile and the natural beauty of his country with you. </p>
<p>In the Indian communities, as it was with their Mayan ancestors, the basic staple diet is corn. The clothing worn today is as it was in the past. It is relatively easy to 
determine the village in which the clothing was made by the type of embroidery, color, design and shape. Mayan dialects of Quiche, Cakchiquel, Kekchi and Mam 
are still spoken today, although the majority of Indians also speak Spanish. The mestizo, or &quot; ladino &quot;, the mixture of Indian and Spanish, live in the larger towns and 
cities and have developed a culture of their own. This is where the traits and beliefs of the Spanish are evident. The cosmopolitan side of the Guatemalan can be 
seen in the capital, Guatemala City. Here there are large universities, and English and Spanish are spoken side-by-side. </p>
<p>In Livingston, on the Caribbean Coast, you will find the influence and traditions of the African culture, brought into Guatemala in the 16th Century by the 
immigration of Caribbean blacks. The &quot;gariganu&quot;, as they are called, speak a mixture of Spanish, English and Dutch called &quot;garifuna&quot;. Their typical dishes include 
tapado, enchiladas and sweet coconut bread, and drinks such as horchata and rosa de Jamaica. </p>
<p>In Guatemala, the visitor is offered a legacy spanning many thousands of years. From the monumental cities of the ancient Maya, through the heritage of the 
Catholic Spanish, who came ashore in the 15th Century, to today&#146;s Guatemala, a blend of the past into the present. Although aspects of each separate culture can 
still be seen, the synergy of this blending has made Guatemala the happy, colorful and friendly country it is today. In Guatemala it is possible to live in a modern 
environment yet experience the magic and enchantment of a legendary past.</p>
<p>The Maya, one of the most important civilizations of Latin America, flourished in Guatemala. Still to be solved are the enigmas of the undeciphered hieroglyphics 
which shield the mysteries of the ancient Maya. And why did they suddenly abandon their metropolis around the 10th C. after generations of construction? The 
arrival of the Spanish brought new ways to Guatemala. Mixed and merged with those of the Indian descendants of the Maya and verbally handed down from father 
to son over generations, they have formed the idiosyncrasies which are such a charming facet of today&#146;s Guatemala. </p>
<p>he village of Chichicastenango is a place where great emphasis is placed on this fusion of cultures. Ancient rituals and Christian rites are practiced side-by-side, 
giving a glimpse of typical life in the Guatemalan countryside. It was here, centuries ago, that the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; was discovered, a sacred book often called &quot;the 
American Bible&quot;, containing ancient histories of the Quiche. In Antigua this intriguing marriage of culture has produced the most beautiful and unusual legends of 
colonial times. Visitors here experience a pleasant, yet mysterious, feeling of relaxation. This legendary climate is also quite evident in modern Guatemala City. One 
of the most romantic spots is La Ermita, the site on which the present capital was founded. This area is rich in history and legends which never lose their charm and 
glamour. So strong is the legendary spirit in Guatemala that its writers and poets have made it world renowned. A case in point, Miguel Angel Asturias, 1967 
Nobel Prize winner for Literature.</p>
<p>Guatemala is a country of magic, as chronicled by the first historians and travelers, not only because of the beauty and splendor of its climate and landscape, but for 
the spirit of fantasy that has always been evident in its elaborate religious rituals and the ways of its people.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="his">A Short History Overview</a></h3>
<p align=left>The history of Guatemala falls into three welldefined periods. Prior to the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores, Guatemala was the center of a great Mayan 
civilization. More and more information is being accumulated as archaeologists excavate the temples and pyramids of the ruined cities. Mayan culture flourished in 
Guatemala between 2000 B.C. and 900 A.D. It was during the Classic Period, between 250 900 A.D. that the greatest temples and pyramids were built and the 
Mayan calendar was developed from astronomical observations. The second period begins with the arrival of Pedro de Alvarado in 1524. He founded the first 
capital of the kingdom where Tecp&aacute;n now stands, later moved it to Ciudad Vieja and then, after a mudslide, to Antigua Guatemala.. It was from this capital that the 
Spanish ruled the colonies that stretched from the Yucatan to Panama. After much of Antigua was destroyed by an earthquake in 1773 the capital was moved to 
Guatemala City The third period began with its independence from Spain on September 15th 1821. The country declared itself a republic in 1847</p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left>What to wear</h3>
<p align=left>Bring lightweight waterproof clothing and an umbrella if visiting in the rainy season they are not as easy to find outside Guatemala City as you might have expected. 
The evenings can be chilly in the highlands, particularly during November and February, and bringing sweaters is advisable although tourists can of course buy some 
beautiful sweaters, along with felt jackets, in the Indian markets. March, April and May are generally hot.</p>
<h3 align=left>The People</h3>
<p align=left>The Indian descendants of the Maya represent 53 percent of the country's population. The Indians have preserved their traditional way of life and kept their 
traditional costumes, their languages and for the most part, their pagan religion. The remainder of the population is divided between white and mixed race with a 
small black population concentrated in Puerto Barrios and Livingston.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="surp">SURPRISING FACTS</a></h3>
<dir>
<li>In Chichicastenango, the design on the Quiche man&#146;s costume depicts his marital status, how many children he may have, and how many of his sons are 
married.</li>
<li>The Maya ate amaranth, a breakfast cereal similar to the ones we eat today. It was high in levels of protein and Iysine, an essential amino acid. </li>
<li>The 365-day Mayan calendar consisted of 18 months of 20 days each, followed by five days of bad luck.</li>
<li>The Maya had mirrors made from magnetite, ilmenite, hematite, and pyrite crystals. The small mirrors were worn around the neck to ward off evil spirits.</li>
<li>Mosquito eggs were harvested as a type of caviar. </li>
<li>The planet Venus was considered an evil, sinister heavenly body and a threat to the Mayan people. </li>
<li>Solola men are identified by the bat motif on their jackets. The design, feared and respected for its mystical powers, came from the Cakchiquel tribe of the 
Maya who used it as a symbol of their order. </li>
<li>Mayans used the Quetzal (kuk) symbol in many weaving motifs because it symbolized freedom and inner strength.</li>
<li>The eagle, seen in so many costume designs, might in fact be the Harpy Eagle. The exaggerated head size commonly seen in these costumes might refer to 
the Harpy&#146;s ability to raise its feathers and increase the overall appearance of the upper torso. </li>
<li>The huipil (blouse), tzute (male headcloth). and the paya (apron) each tell stories about the cultural background of the person wearing the garment. They give 
the social standing, marital status, membership in a native group, and identifies in which region he or she may reside. </li>
<li>The simplest form of the loom, the backstrap loom, still can be seen throughout the highlands, but its use is declining rapidly. </li>
<li>Tikal has one of the largest concentrations of Oscillated turkeys remaining in the Americas. An endangered species, it is the closest descendent to the North 
American wild turkey. </li>
<li>Tikal has six different species of parrots includ-ing the large Mealy or Blue-Crowned Parrot. </li>
<li>The dry, tropical forest of Guatemala is an excellent location to search out the small woodcreepers which follow the lines of foraging army ants. The 
woodcreepers grab those helpless victims that evade the tenacious ants. </li>
<li>Guatemala is one of the last countries in Central America where you still can see the Bairds tapir in the wild. Two locations have stable populations: Tikal 
National Park and along the banks of the central Usumacinta River. </li>
<li>Pharomcrus mocinno, the Resplendent Quetzal, is the national bird and symbol of life. It was revered by the Maya and turned into a god by the Aztecs. The 
Aztecs called the bird Quctzallo, meaning &quot;strikingly beautiful.&quot; They combined its beauty with mystical attributes and turned the magical symbol into a 
feathered serpent, half bird, half snake. The dicty was called Quetzalquatl. The long plumes were plucked and worn by nobility or priests. Today, with 
declining populations and fewer secluded nesting sites, the Quetzal is an endangered species. A special biological reserve has been created to protect it, the 
&quot;Mario Dary Rivera Reserve For The Preservation Of The Quetzal.&quot; in the high misty forests of Baja Verapaz, where visitors can wander through well kept 
trails with guided tours and admire many other species of plant and animal life.</li>
<li>The descendants of the Maya migrated from North America about 2,500 years ago. </li>
<li>Most native children have a small dark spot at the base of their spine. It is called the Mongoloid spot and is common in East Asian children. The spot 
disappears by the child&#146;s 10th birthday. </li>
<li>The Maya developed the concept of the zero (0) hundreds of years before the Europeans. This concept provided the foundation for their highly sophisticated 
calendar as well as time concepts which stretched to infinity. </li>
<li>The Maya was never a single empire; rather, it comprised more than 20 interconnected cultural communities, the largest located at Tikal. </li>
<li>The native population of Livingston is of Afro Caribe ancestry. They are called the &quot;Garinagu&quot; and speak a language mixed with Spanish, En-glish, and Dutch 
called &quot;Garifuna.&quot; </li>
<li>Jade or jadilc was the most precious stone of the Maya. Its hardness was rated at 6.g on the Rockwell scale, compared to 10.0 for the diamond. </li>
<li>Temple IV in Tikal, at 229 ft., is the highest man-made Mayan 75 meter structure. </li>
<li>The largest single piece of jade found in the region was from the ruins of Kaminaljuyu and weighed 207 lb. located in Guatemala City. </li>
<li>The most complex cave systems in Central American arc found in Guatemala at San Pedro Marlir, Lanquin, San Juan Chamelco, Jobitzinaj, and at Cuncn. 
Many of the cave systems have large stalactites and stalagmites. </li>
<li>Guatemala has more nesting Harpy eagles than any other country in Central America. </li>
<li>One thousand years before Columbus landed on the shores of Central America, the Maya had developed the four main compass points used in marine 
navigation.</li>
<li>The deepest lake in Central America, Guatemala&#146;s Lake Atitlan, is 1,019 ft. deep.</li>
<li>The Maya had seven base form of musical instru-ments but never developed a stringed instrument. In 1700 the city of Antigua had 70,000. inhabitants, 60 
cobbled streets, 6.000 houses, 18 convents, 32 churches, 15 hermitages, 10 chapels, one univer-sity, seven colleges, one orphan asylum, and live hospitals.</li>
<li>Guatemala is the only country in Latin America that has set aside a protected reserve exclusively for the manatee.</li>
<li>The largest piece of carved jade ever found from the Mayan empire was 10.5 inches high and weighted 11.11 lb.</li>
<li>The Maya never developed the wheel because domesticated animals were too small to draw a cart.</li>
<li>Guatemala was the first civilized country to abol-ish slavery (April 17,1824) -before the United States, France, or England.</li>
<li>The Ixchel Museum has over 5, 000 pieces of hand-made costumes that represent 145 different highland Mayan groups. </li>
<li>Guatemala has a single highway that cuts across the country from the Pacific to the Caribbean. It is 400 km. in length.</li>
<li>The first university in Central America (and the third in Latin America) was founded in Guatemala in 1687. It was called the Royal and Pontifical University 
of San Carlos of Borromeo. </li>
<li>The first bank opened on January 14, 1731, before most neighboring countries had established a money system.</li>
<li>Guatemala is the largest producer of jadite in Central America. The colors range from the famil-iar emerald green to black and even the prized brilliant white 
variety.</li>
<li>The largest three-dimensional map in the world is in Guatemala City. The 1300 sq. meter relief map is about 9% of scale. </li>
<li>The largest stela ever produced in the Americas was carved at the Maya site of Quirigua, Guatemala.</li>
<li>The first newspaper ever published in Central America, La Gaceta de Goathemala, was printed in Guatemala in 1729.</li>
<li>The first Central American Conservatory was opened in Guatemala City in 1880. One of the longest and largest navigable subter-ranean rivers in the 
Americas runs through Guatemala&#146;s Candelaria Grotto. This sacred Mayan site is over 28 km. long. </li>
<li>The first and only complete paleontology museum in Central America is located at Estanzuela, Guatemala.</li>
<li>The Tajumulco Volcano, at 4, 210 meters, is the tallest volcano in Central America. The country has 23 different language groups, each considered native of 
the region. </li>
<li>Guatemala has 15 public and private museums open all year.</li>
<li>The country has one of the oldest candy compa-nies in Latin America. It produces over 100 different types of candies flavored and designed like fresh 
fruit.</li>
<li>The North region of Guatemala has over 3,000 Mayan ruins, most of which remain untouched. </li>
<li>The largest carved stone mask ever found in Central America is in Tikal. The face represents Chac, the Mayan rain god. </li>
<li>The brightest colored bird in the Guatemalan skies, the Scarlet Macaw, is the representative of the underworld in Mayan mythology.</li>
<li>One of the main attractions inside the National Palace are the beautiful and descriptive stained-glass windows designed and executed by the master Julio 
Urruela from 1941 to 1945, in which scenes of daily life in Guatemala during the XVIIth and XlXth century are depicted, as well as the 10 Civic Virtues and 
full life size representations of Tecun Uman, Don Pedro de Alvarado, Bishop Francisco Marroqufn and other national historic figures and scenes of 
prehistoric and colonial times.<hr>

<p>Occupying the northernmost position in Central America, Guatemala offers one of the most exciting natural history destinations in the Americas. Consider this: a 
wildly varied land of virgin jungles, intermingled with beautiful lakes, rivers and volcanoes; caves, valleys and ravines, mountains and plateaus. Within its ecosystems 
are myriad species of flora and fauna, changing with a graduated climate whose average temperature is 680 F. For the visitor, it is important to note that many of 
the country&#146;s most beautiful and interesting natural regions are sites of enormous archaeological importance, monuments of colonial architecture, and centers of 
traditional Indian culture. Such tourist assets add up to an unquestionably fascinating travel destination. </p>
<p>Guatemala&#146;s 8,000 species of vascular plants include 600 species of orchids, with nearly 200 species endemic to the country. Of those, 70 species are found only 
in their isolated habitat areas. However, orchids of one kind or another exist in nearly every life zone of the nation under 1 1,000 feet. Some 35 species of Lycastes 
have been identified with more than a dozen still waiting classification. They can be found in the southern portion of the highlands and occasionally in and around the 
Alta Verapaz, they include Guatemala&#146;s national flower, the gleaming white Lycaste Skinneri Alba. For naturalists and those with a sincere interest in the wonders 
of this beautiful country, specialized tours to the National Parks and various wilderness areas are available. With expert guides who can describe the wonders of 
Guatemala&#146;s rich natural resources. Three types of subtropical forests are found in Guatemala: <strong>warm and very humid; cool and very humid; warm and dry 
forest</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Warm and very humid</strong> forests are found throughout the country in the departments of Izabal, El Peten, Alta Verapaz, Santa Rosa, Escuintla, Suchitepequez, 
Retalhuleu, San Marcos, Quiche and Quetzaltenango. Altitudes in this area range from 59 feet to over 5,000 feet above sea level. The temperature varies between 
70&#146; F to 82&#146; F. The area contains over 60 different species of trees as well as aquatic vegetation inhabited by nesting, spawning fish and crustaceans. There are 
about 180 species of native birds and over 300 species of migrating birds. <strong>Cool and very humid forests</strong> are found in the departments of Alta Verapaz, Baja 
Verapaz, Jutiapa, Quiche and Huehuetenango. The altitude varies from 558 to 2,133 feet above sea level. Temperature is in the range of 68&#146; F to 80&#146; F. The 
vegetation of the area differs with the altitude and ranges from weeds, bushes and ferns (some arboreal) to palms. There are more than 50 species of trees and 
hundreds of orchids and bromeliads. Butterflies and beetles, amphibians, lizards and snakes are plentiful. The most spectacular bird of the region is the quetzal the 
national bird of Guatemala. <strong>Warm and dry forests</strong> are found in the departments of Santa Rosa, Jutiapa, Izabal, El Peten, Escuintla, Suchitepequez, Retalhuleu, 
Quetzaltenango and San Marcos. They are found from sea level to 1,312 feet in a temperature of 66&#146; F to 86 F. This type of forest is located in areas of brackish 
water so that mangroves and bulrushes are prevalent. The area also has a great variety of fruit trees, medicinal plants and other timber. Many different species of 
mammals, reptiles and birds are there.</p>
<p>National parks and recreational areas have been established throughout Guatemala to preserve the flora and fauna. One of these areas is the &quot;Mario Dary Rivera&quot;, 
located in the Sierra de Chuacus in Baja Verapaz, and devoted to the preservation of the quetzal, Guatemala&#146;s national bird. The &quot;Chocon Machacas&quot; located in 
Livingston, Izabal, on the Caribbean coast, has been designated for the preservation of the manatee and the mangroves. This tropical jungle area forms part of Lake 
Izabal, the Rio Dulce and the Bay of Amatique. The &quot;Cerro Cahui&quot;, located on the banks of the Lake Peten, Itza, is dedicated to preserving the wild Peten turkey, 
a species on the verge of extinction. Guatemala is split, almost down the middle, by a mountain range which forms two mountain systems: the Sierra Madre, which 
is parallel to the Pacific Ocean, and the Cuchumatanes Range, in Huehuetenango. Other mountain systems in Guatemala are the Sierra de las Minas, Sierra de 
Chama, Sierra de Chuacus and the Merendon Mountains.</p>

<h3><a name="NATURE ZONES">NATURE ZONES</a></h3>
<p>LAKE ATITLAN</p>
<p>Lake Atitlan, which is volcanic in origin, is the main tourist attraction in the Department of Solola. The lake is 90 miles from Guatemala City, and has been 
described by experts as the most beautiful lake in the world. It is located 5,125 feet above sea level, covers an area of 50 square miles and has a depth of 1,600 
feet. Its clear waters are home to several species of fish including the very edible black bass. Three spectacular volcanoes Toliman, Atitlan and San Pedro form a 
natural backdrop for the lake waters which change colors with the varying light. Lake Atitlan is a mecca for water sports: fishing, swimming, diving, water skiing and 
boating. The surrounding mountains are a natural springboard for hang gliding and competitions are often held there. A visit will bring you to the &quot;poc&quot;, another 
nearly extinct bird that spends its entire lifespan on the water. Efforts are also being made here to ensure the survival of this rare bird. The Monterrico Reserve is 
located in Santa Rosa, on the Pacific coast. Here, among the rich jungle vegetation, mangroves and beaches, there exist fruit trees and an amazing variety of marine 
life, including marine turtles. </p>
<p>AMATIQUE BAY</p>
<p>This scenic Caribbean coast area still not fully developed for tourism has sand beaches interspersed with patches of forest. Places to visit include Punta Cocoli, 
Punta de Manabique and Bahia Santo Tomas. Boats can be hired in Puerto Barrios, capital of the Department, to visit other fascinating towns. One such is 
Livingston, an AfroCaribbean town inhabited by the Garifuna people. The Rio Dulce, approximately 19 miles long, is Lake Izabal&#146;s outlet to the Caribbean. At its 
widest point, the river has a &quot;lakelike&quot; stretch known as El Golfete. This scenic river is lined with dense tropical vegetation inhabited by both tropical and sea birds.</p>
<p>PACIFIC COAST</p>
<p>Guatemala&#146;s Pacific Coast is characterized by the volcanic black sand beaches found there. These are much like the beaches found on many South Pacific atolls. 
The best known of these beaches are found in the departments of Retalhuleu, Suchitepequez, Escuintla and Santa Rosa. Among these beaches are La Empalizada, 
El Semillero, Zipacate and Hawai. In the Department of Escuintla, beautiful waterfalls add to the natural beauty of the caves at San Pedro Martir.</p>
<p>EL PETEN</p>
<p>The humid soil of this department is due to the rain and the lakes which are prevalent here. The long and slow running rivers include the San Pedro, Usumacinta, La 
Pasion, Santa Isabel, Machaquile, San Juan, Azul and El Subin. Most of these rivers are navigable. The many lakes in El Peten are small in size. Some are aligned 
to the geological pleats of the Arco de la Libertad. The same is true of the lakes of Mendoza. San Diego, La Gloria, Larga, Sacpuy, PetenItza, Yaxha and Sachab. 
Other lakes such Petexbatun and Del Tigre are not in the Arco, but form part of the El Peten&#146;s marshy environment and biological wealth</p>
<p>ALTA VERAPAZ</p>
<p>Some of the rivers in this department are navigable. Most have spectacular waterfalls. Among them are the Cahabon, which is great for white water rafting, 
Polochic, Sebol and Chajmaic. The most accessible waterfalls are Sepemech, near the town of Cahabon, La Prensa, in San Juan Chamelco, Patal, in Tactic, 
Pelizimpec, in Cahabon, and Seamay, in Senahu. Lake Lachua is near the Chixoy Valley in Coban and sits amidst some wonderful scenery. Semuc Champey is 
considered to be the most beautiful place in Alta Verapaz. The area consists of a series of naturally terraced pools in limestone terrain branching off the Cahabon 
River. Nearby there is a cave through which the river runs. </p>
<p>BAJA VERAPAZ Chorros, the bathing resort, is located in Rabinal as are two valleys with particularly impressive beauty. One, San Jeronimo, is watered by 
several rivers and dotted with historical sites. Urram, the other, can be best appreciated from the hill where the Cahyup archaeological site is located.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="VOLCANOES">VOLCANOES</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pacaya (8,373 feet): Located south of Lake Amatitlan, To climb to the top, it takes four hours from Santa Elena Barillas, but only an hour and a half from 
San Francisco de Sales. The small McKenny crater, with its boiling lava, has been active since it formed in 1975. It takes approximately a half hour to climb 
and is an excellent spot from which to take photos.</li>
<li>Agua (12,325 feet): The peak of this volcano can be reached in five hours starting from Santa Maria de Jesus, ten miles from La Antigua Guatemala. The 
view from the top is magnificent! You can see almost all of the southern part of Guatemala including the western mountain ranges.</li>
<li>Acatenango (13,041 feet) and Fuego (12,346 feet): Both are located to the west of La Antigua Guatemala. Acatenango has two cones: the largest of the 
two is Acatenango, the other is Yepocapa. Fuego&#146;s cone was destroyed during the 1962 eruption, but it is still active and spews ash and sand clouds 
frequently. Starting at Acatenango, both volcanoes may be climbed during the same trip.</li>
<li>Atitlan (11,600 feet), Toliman (10,282 feet) and San Pedro (9,908 feet): These are the three majestic volcanoes which surround Lake Atitlan. Climbing 
Atitlan usually takes eight hours, Toliman about six hours, and San Pedro about five. The climb is well worth the effort as the view of the lake, from any of 
their tops, is breathtaking.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="CAVES">CAVES</a></h3>
<p>El Peten, being primarily a limestone region, has many caves some which evidence occupation by preHispanic people. The best known are Ajtun Kan (the 
Serpent), Naj Tunich and Jobitzinaj. There are a number of caves in Alta Verapaz, each with its own particular attraction. The most popular are Chisec, Lanquen, 
Esmeralda and San Juan Chamelco, all located in San Miguel Tucuru. Chuchuba is located in Santa Maria Cahabon, and Seamay in Senahu. La Candelaria Caves 
are also located in Chisec.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="NATURE RESERVES">NATURE RESERVES</a></h3>
<dir>
<li><strong>Cerro Cahui: </strong>It is located in the northeastern region of Lake PetenItza. Its dense jungle preserves the hydrological resources of the zone. This 1.608 acre 
area is the habitat of the ocellated turkey, a large bird with bright blueturquoise feathers. The geologic formation of the soil is limestone and is characterized 
by limestone hills. There are more than 60 species of trees, approximately 28 species of mammals and over 300 species of birds. Its principal rivers are the 
lxpot and Ixlu. There are also intermittent streams such as El Tigre and El Pollo.</li>
<li><strong>Chocon Machacas:</strong> Located in the north central part of Rio Dulce&#146;s El Golfete in Izabal. A 17.791 acre protected area created to preserve the manatee 
(sea cow) the largest mammal in Guatemala. Its habitat is within the connecting lakes of the reserve and the Rio Dulce, and between the Rio Dulce and the 
Caribbean Sea. Most of the protected area is broken and rugged terrain crossed by the Chocon Machacas and Cienaga rivers. There are also six beautiful 
lakes and five streams in the reserve. The area has at least 60 species of trees, approximately 180 migrating bird species, of the existing 300, and a large 
variety of mammals, fish, turtles, toads, frogs and iguanas. </li>
<li><strong>&quot;Mario Dary Rivera&quot; Quetzal Reserve:</strong> Located in Purulha, Baja Verapaz, the 2,849 acres of this protected area includes part of Sierra de las Minas, 
the top of Carpintero Hill and the Quisis Mountain. It was created to protect and preserve the quetzal (Pharomachrus Mocinno). the national bird of 
Guatemala. The principal asset of this reserve is its crystal clear water. Its dense foliage protects the Polochic River&#146;s high basin from erosion and favors an 
almost continuous presence of very humid mist. The terrain of this reserve is broken and rugged, formed mostly by mountain ranges. There are many small. 
superficial and intermittent watersheds and four subwatersheds which originate in the Cafetal and Colorado rivers. Its jungle is stratified and contains many 
species of grass, bushes, ferns, moss, bromeliads and orchids as well as over 50 species of trees. Mammals are few, only about 25 species.</li>
<li><strong>Monterrico:</strong> A nature reserve with multiple objectives located in Monterrico, Taxisco, in the Department of Santa Rosa. Its primary purpose is the 
protection of mangrove forests and sea turtles. This reserve is an interaction of subtropical ecosystems, estuaries of saline water and the seasonably flooded 
sea coast. Covering 6,918 acres, of which 657 are under water, it is habitat to a great variety of fish and crustaceans and a sanctuary for migrating birds. Its 
principal river system became the Chiquimulilla Canal when it was created in 1895 in order to navigate 785 miles of marshland, lakes and pools parallel to 
the south coast. Flora includes mangroves, bulrushes, white water lilies and bromeliads. On the coastal sand banks there are fruit, medicinal and timber trees.</li>

</td><td width=50%>Guatemala City is a contrasting counterpart to the country&#146;s ancient beginnings and the colonial heritage 
which offers such allure to visitors. Modern and cosmopolitan, the city hosts hundreds of travelers daily from 
the United States, Europe and Latin America. The first sights that greet you in this friendly, cosmopolitan 
metropolis are the gleaming, modern buildings sparkling in the sun. Luxury and firstclass hotels here are on a 
par with those anywhere, with one delightful addition ... the friendly, smiling service that is typically 
Guatemalan. A full range of services catering to the businessman is also available as well as convention 
facilities. The city maintains all the modern social amenities such as tennis, golf courses, swimming pools and 
health clubs. The national telephone, telegraph and telex systems help keep you in touch with the rest of the 
world. A modern uptodate television network is supplemented by daily local and international newspapers 
and publications, provided in several languages, which are available throughout the city.</td></tr>

<p align=left>Guatemala City is the capital of the country and the largest city in Central America, situated about 4,000 feet above sea level on a broad plateau on the Sierra 
Madre, 50 miles north of the pacific coast. The climate is mild with little seasonal variation in temperatures, and most of the rainfall between May and October. 
Most visits to Guatemala begin in the capital of Guatemala City, a vibrant cosmopolitan city of modem buildings blending with magnificent examples of the finest 
Spanish colonial architecture, and the political, cultural and commercial center of the nation. Guatemala City has more than 25% of the nation&#146;s population of eight 
million inhabitants. It is a center of the light industry that generates more than half of the nation&#146;s manufacturing output, producing textiles, clothing, food, furniture 
and other products. A modem international airport provides connections for visitors from throughout the world. Broad avenues extend from the city&#146;s hub at 
Parque Central, the Central Plaza. Here are situated the imposing National Palace and the Cathedral. One of the few buildings to survive the devastating 
earthquakes of 19171918, the Cathedral (17821815) is an unsurpassed example of Neoclassical architecture of its era.</p>
<p align=left>Nearby La Merced an early 19th century church rebuilt after 1918, contains altars and other treasures transported from the former capital at Antigua. Guatemala is 
a city of culture with many museums, theaters and art galleries and the nation takes special pride in the Cultural Center Miguel Angel Asturias, who won the Nobel 
Prize for literature in 1967 and for whom the Cultural Center is named after. Modern stores and colorful markets teem with native arts and crafts, and points of 
interest include numerous parks, the Central Market, Olympic Stadium, University City, the Cerro del Carmen, with a reconstructed hermitage set in a hillside park 
and the map in relief, and extraordinary engineering feat completed in 1904 , which represents the country in a threedimensional monumental scale. Shopping is one 
of the most popular activities of visitors, and the beautiful array of native arts and crafts are moderately priced although the visitor is well advised to do some 
bargaining and not pay the first price asked. Particularly popular are the brilliantly colored and uniquely patterned fabrics, ranging from jackets and dresses to belts, 
blouses and blankets. Many are hand loomed just as they have been for centuries and some designs are unchanged from preHispanic and colonial times. The design 
woven into the traditional apparel of the Chichicastenango Indian will even relate to the informed his marital status, how many children he has and how many of his 
sons are married. Chichicastenango, two hours drive from Guatemala City, is famous for its open market, with the traditionally garbed Indians offering their wares in 
open stalls. On Thursdays and Sundays. visitors can observe the unusual religious rites at the town&#146;s Santo Tomas Church, where traditional Catholicism has 
absorbed native customs and ritual that predate the birth of Christ. </p>
<p align=left>From modern hotels to small pensiones, Guatemala City boasts a wide range of accommodations and there is a variety of fine restaurants that feature the most 
sophisticated international cuisine and the outstanding native dishes of the country. Native food is unique and varied blending Spanish and European influences with 
that of the Indians and the spicier African inspired dishes of the Caribbean coast. Figuring prominently in the typical Guatemalan dishes, with their special sauces 
and seasonings are fish, lobster, shrimp, turkey, chicken, pork, beef, corn, beans, squash, tomatoes, hot chilies, rice, coconut, bananas and other tropical fruits.</p>
<p align=left>A wide range of restaurants offer specialties from all over the world. Enjoy a simple but hearty homecooked meal, or some of the most sophisticated creations of 
French hautecuisine, whatever suits your taste. All are at very reasonable prices. Night life in Guatemala can be enjoyed in a number of ways. Primarily located in 
the center of town and in major hotels, entertainment can vary from quiet piano bars to lively discos. In &quot;Zona Viva&quot;, you can mingle with both tourists and locals to 
participate in an entertaining evening. There is a high degree of culture and sophistication in Guatemala City. The National Theater, the city&#146;s most impressive 
modern building with its angled, pyramid shape, has a seating capacity for 2,020. The Gallery of the National School of Fine Arts, the National Museum of History 
and Anthropology, the Museum of Modern Art and the lxchel Museum of Indian Costumes are among a few of the more interesting places to visit. A new wave of 
artistic style and technique is developing today in Guatemala, a blend of the traditional with the modern. This intriguing combination can be seen in new and original 
styles of jade and silverjewelry, and in the modern fashionable clothing boutiques and stores throughout the city. </p>

<tr><td width=20%><img src="images/gu_co3.jpeg" align=bottom width=222 height=158></td><td width=50%><strong>COLONIAL GUATEMALA</strong><p>Guatemala treasures its colonial past. Primarily Spanish, its structures can be found in most major cities and villages 
throughout the country. But nowhere can they be seen better than in Antigua, a colonial city which grew to be more 
beautiful than in Antigua, a colonial city which grew to be more beautiful than any other in Latin America. Following 
two futile attempts, the government of the &quot;Kingdom of Guatemala&quot; was established in 1543 and included what is 
now Costa Rica, in the south, to Mexican states in the north.</p>

<h2 align=left><a name="ant">Antigua</a></h2>
<p align=left>Antigua Guatemala or &quot;the Most Noble and Loyal City of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala&quot; as it was entitled by Spanish royal decree, represents the 
'colonial' past of the country. Antigua is among the oldest and most beautiful cities in the Americas. Set amidst three magnificent volcanoes Agua, Fuego and 
Acatenango its superb yet sturdy colonial buildings have weathered 16 earthquakes and numerous floods and fires. </p>
<p align=left>The city of Santiago de los Caballeros, known today as Antigua, was founded in the Valley of Panchoy and became the third capital in the New World following 
only those of Mexico and Peru. Antigua today is a beautiful colonial city where time has stopped. Walk the cobblestone streets, let the aura of its history permeate 
your mind and soul. The opulent, baroque buildings are elaborately decorated. Some of the building elements, although beautiful, are also utilitarian, such as the low, 
wide columns which were necessary to withstand earthquakes. Standing in mute testimony to times long past are the Palace of the Captains General, the City Hall, 
the Cathedral, the churches and monasteries of Las Merced, Capuchinas and Santa Clara. In the middle of the 18th Century the School of Santo Tomas was 
founded and later became the University of San Carlos de Borromeo, third in America.</p>
<p align=left>Antigua has retained its historic character, preserved its monuments and kept is original architectural style intact. The city's churches have lost much of their 
Baroque splendour, the postearthquake repair and restoration leaving them denuded of embellishment and elegance. However, many remain impressive, in 
particular La Merced, the Iglesia de San Francisco and the Convento de las Capucinas (now a museum). Casa K'ojom is a fascinating museum of Mayan music 
and ceremonies and related artefacts, and a visit to the local cemetery also provides an insight into ancient Mayan beliefs. </p>
<p align=left>After two centuries as the capital of Guatemala, the city of La Antigua Guatemala was destroyed by earthquake in 1773 and the seat of government moved to the 
site of what is now Guatemala City, 25 miles to the east. Today, the city remains one of Guatemala&#146;s most popular attractions. With some of the nation&#146;s most 
prestigious museums and the site of the finest examples of Spanish Colonial art and architecture in the Americas, La Antigua has been declared a &quot;Monument of the 
Americas&quot; by the PanAmerican Institute of History and Geography in 1942.</p>
<p align=left>The magnificent ruins of La Antigua&#146;s cathedrals, convents, plazas and stately homes remain as outstanding reminders of 16th and 17th century Guatemala with the 
government buildings surrounding the Plaza de Armas at the center of the city. They include the palace of the Captain General built in 1764 to house the Royal 
Mint, Treasury, courts, and official reception areas.Across the park is the old City Hall (Palacio del Ayuntamiento)which housed the city jail and town council 
during colonial times, and is now a museum. Nearby are the ruins of the Cathedral and archbishop&#146;s palace completed in 1680. La Merced Church with its white 
stone work, has survived a number of earthquakes and remains unchanged since 1773. The ruins of San Francisco Church built by the Franciscans late in the 16th 
century houses elaborate frescoes, paintings and statues. Convent of the Capuchinas, one of La Antigua&#146;s best preserved structures, was once a center of study 
and meditation for the nuns who lived there, while the University of San Carlos, which opened in 1681, has been a museum of colonial art since 1936, its cloistered 
arcade is the most elaborate in La Antigua. The city is also known for its festivals, particularly during Holy Week, when elaborate sawdust carpets are made for the 
processions.</p>
<p align=left>In 1979, UNESCO declared it a Cultural Heritage Landmark. Buildings with Spanish facades, arcades and courtyards, reconstructed buildings and colonial ruins 
that tell the story of Guatemala's colonial past have made Antigua one of the country's most popular tourist centers. Every day except Tuesday, Wednesday and 
Friday is a market day. While Antigua's cannot compare with the spectacular markets in western highlands towns like Chichicastenango, it is still well worth seeing 
full of color and movement as Indian families descend from the surrounding mountain villages to sell their produce and fine traditional handicrafts. Antigua is world 
famous for its jade, ceramics and woodwork Colonial Guatemala represents the glory of the past that has been perpetuated through the majesty of its constructions. 
These stand in testimony of over 300 years of history covering the period from the arrival of the Spanish, in 1524, until 1821 the year that Guatemala gained its 
independence from Spain.</p>

<h3><a name="trad">&#160;The Traditional Guatemala</a></h3>
<p>The folklore of Guatemala is possibly the most interesting and varied in the world. This is a natural result of the country&#146;s rich preColumbian and Spanish colonial 
past. One of the best expressions of traditional Guatemala can be seen in its textiles, with more than 325 different variations of style and color, each with its own 
historical meaning. Traditional fiestas, at least one each day throughout the country, commemorate the patron saints of each town and major events of historical 
significance to the celebrants. Dances and rituals take place during these celebrations. Marketplaces dot the countryside, and the most diverse handicrafts and 
agricultural products are sold. A myriad of color can be seen as Indians bargain for, and purchase, daily necessities and visit with each other. The famous 
Chichicastenango market in Quiche is an open market meeting center for the Indians and &quot;Ladinos&quot; of the highlands, who meet to sell their wares and to worship 
the Catholic saints and ancient gods at the Church of Santo Tomas. Other markets of note include San Francisco El Alto in Totonicapan and Chiquimula.</p>
<p>The most magical and majestic manifestation of Guatemalan spiritual belief occurs during Holy Week. During this countrywide celebration, the smell of incense 
enhances the aura of religious devotion toward saints, traditions and beliefs handed down over countless generations. Guatemalans combine the splendor of Spanish 
Catholic processions with the ancestral rites and traditions of their forefathers. All Saints Day, November 1st, is a popular event. Especially so in Santiago 
Sacatepequez, where huge, multicolored kites are flown as a message to the spirits of the departed. Music, art and literature form a way of life in Guatemala. The 
marimba is the national instrument, and its melodious sounds can be heard throughout the cities and countryside. Paintings of all sorts and carved handicraft can be 
found in typical marketplaces as well as in deluxe shops. On the coast of the Atlantic, where the inhabitants are descendants of Caribbean blacks, traditions unique 
even to Guatemala can be found. Music is accompanied by percussion instruments and can be heard throughout the streets of the major city, Livingston, in the 
rhythmic Afrobeat of the &quot;Punta&quot; and the &quot;Yancunu&quot;.</p>

<h3 align=left><a name="ati">Lake Atitlan and its villages </a></h3>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=15%><img src="images/gu_lk1.jpeg" align=bottom width=220 height=103></td><td width=50%>The volcanic lake is more than 5,000 feet above sea level and the maximum recorded depth is over 1,000 feet. At 12 miles 
long and between 4.5 and 7.5 miles wide, it covers an area of more than 80 square miles. Volcanic in origin, the lake is framed 
by the three volcanoes Toliman, Atitlan and San Pedro. It's a comfortable drive from Guatemala City to Panajachel, the main 
town, which has a fine view of the lake and the volcanoes. We recommend a visit too Santiago Atitlan, the largest of the lake 
towns, which is noted for its beautiful textiles. Boats for Santiago leave Panajachel at 9 am every day and return at about 1 
pm.</td></tr>

<h3 align=left><a name="chichi">Chichicastenango</a></h3>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=50%>At 2030 metres, this magical and misty town is surrounded by valleys and overshadowed by looming mountains. Though isolated, it's 
always been an important market town. This is the market town of Guatemala, a twiceaweek bustling mass of highlands Indians who 
bring their produce, textiles and other handicrafts from the surrounding towns to sell. The market is on Thursdays and Sundays and is an 
absolute must if you are in the vicinity. The Sunday market is really the one to catch, as the cofrad&iacute;as (religious brotherhoods) often hold 
processions on that day. The locals have combined traditional Mayan religious rites with Catholicism; the best places to witness these old 
rites are around the church of Santo Tom&aacute;s and the shrine of Pascual Abaj, which honors the Mayan earth god. Incense, food and drink 
are offered to ancestors and to ensure the continued fertility of the earth. </td><td width=10%><p align=center><img src="images/gu_sh1.jpeg" align=bottom width=140 height=171></p>

<h3 align=left><a name="quet">Quetzaltenango</a></h3>
<p align=left>Beautiful buildings and a colonialstyle layout distinguish this city, second in importance as a trading center in Guatemala. The city prospered during the 19th century 
as a coffeebrokering and storage centre, until an earthquake and volcanic eruption ended the boom. The town's major sights are the central square and the buildings 
which surround it, a couple of basic though useful markets and the ubiquitous Parque Minerva. There are hot sulfur springs throughout the Quetzaltenango region, 
including Los Vahos and Almolonga, just outside the city. The Friday livestock market is the country's best</p>

<h2 align=left><a name="tik">The Peten</a></h2>
<p align=left>To reach the Peten you need to fly from Guatemala City to Flores. This is the best way as crossing the jungles is a multi-day adventure better experience by those 
who truly want to discover the heart of Guatemala. The main attraction is, of course, Tikal and most visitors (about 80%) come on the daily tour, returning to 
Guatemala City in the late afternoon. If you can, and if you want to discover more of Guatemala, we recommend staying at least 1 night in the Peten. From the small 
Jungle Lodge inside the excavations to the Camino Real on the lake at Flores a variety of hotels, mosty small are available for your pleasure</p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left>Flores</h3>
<p align=left>The capital of the junglecovered northeastern department of El Pet&eacute;n, Flores is built on an island on Lago de Pet&eacute;n Itz&aacute;, and is connected by a 500metre causeway 
to the service town of Santa Elena on the lakeshore. The city was founded by the Itzaes, and at the time of conquest was perhaps the last stillfunctioning Mayan 
ceremonial centre in the country. The pyramids, temples and idols were crushed under the foundations of the Spanish city, and the dispersal of the Mayan citizens 
into the jungle gave rise to the myth of a `lost' Mayan city. </p>
<h3 align=left>Tikal </h3>
<p align=left>The monumental Mayan ceremonial centre at Tikal lies northwest of Flores in the department of El Pet&eacute;n. Towering pyramids rise above the jungle's green canopy, 
while down below howler monkeys swing nosily through the branches of ancient trees and colorful parrots squawk. The steepsided temples rise to heights of over 
44 metres, and although the jungle carpet has been swept, the dense rainforest canopy is not far away, making passage within the enigmatic site an unforgettable 
experience. The many ruins include plazas, an acropolis, pyramids, temples and a museum. </p>

A visitor to this part of the country, should not, however, expect to find the sandy golden beaches and sophisticated 
ambience of the better know Caribbean, it offers a more rugged, primitive kind of beauty.<p>These are the main sights:</p>
</td><td width=20%><p align=center><img src="images/gu_rd1.jpeg" align=bottom width=245 height=137></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>LAKE IZABAL:</strong> is the largest of Guatemala's lakes. It is a gentle expanse of water hemmed in by the Sierra de las M~nas to the south and the Santa Cruz 
range to the north. The waters of the lake arc nch in perch, tarpon and other game fish. Unique to the lake is the fresh-water manatee, or sea cow, a mammal 
that weighs up to a ton.</li>
<li><strong>CASTILLO DE SAN FELIPE</strong>; Usually thought of as a defense fortress, the location where the Castle was built has been largelydiscussed, mainly because 
it never proved to be a very officient defense structure, and because, coincidentally, it is situated right between the spot where merchandise was unloaded in 
the 17th contury and the storage deposits used at the time. At different periods of time, it was used as a prison. The castle may be reached by boat from &quot;El 
Relleno&quot;. </li>
<li><strong>RIO DULCE </strong>: Above Livingston, the Rio Dulce plunges through a great gorge between green cliffs. Tropical and seabirds flitter about and soar above the 
tangled vegetation. About two miles north of Livingston are the SIETE ALTARES, a series of small pools and waterfalls where the river empties into the sea. </li>
<li><strong>LIVINGSTON: </strong>The laidback island hideaway of L&iacute;vingston is accessible from the Caribbean port of Puerto Barrios. Black AfroGuatemalans called the 
Garifuna live on the island, descendants of Africans brought to the New World as slaves who escaped or were shipwrecked. Intermarriage with 
shipwrecked sailors of other races and the indigenous Maya has created a distinctive culture and language incorporating African, Mayan and European 
elements. Tiny L&iacute;vingston is an interesting anomaly, the way of life definitely more Belizean than Guatemalan, with coconut groves, gaily painted wooden 
buildings and a fishing economy. The town is the starting point for boat rides on the R&iacute;o Dulce.</li>
<li><strong>THE KEYS:</strong> Special arrangements can be made to visit the Belize keys, where one can fish, scuba dive and en joy snorkeling. These trips can be organized 
for any number of passengers and days and arrangements include provisions, food, camping supplies and everything that is needed, as the keys offer no 
facilities.</li>
<li><strong>QUIRIGUA:</strong> The largest block of stone ever quarried by the ancient Mayas is to be found at Quirigua, located on the north bank of the Motagua river, 
near Rio Dulce, the giant shaft of sandstone, carved in 771 A.D., measures 35 feet long by 5 feet wide and weighs 65 tons. There is a splendid series of 
monuments. It was declared &quot;World Culture and National Monument&quot; by UNESCO.</li>

<li><strong>Belize City / Goff&#146;s Caye</strong> - For a taste of real Belizean culture, head to the shops downtown. Okay. it's not 
&quot;downtown&quot;, it's a right at the Texaco and across the tiny swing bridge. But you get the idea. After you check in 
and grab a mango juice cocktail we'll head to a five-palm sand bar for a barbecue and your first dip in the warm 
Caribbean Sea.</li>
<li><strong>Sapodillas Caye / Barrier Reef</strong> - Ever snorkel in a swimming pool and pretend you were in the ocean? Ever 
see a coral reef the size of New Jersey? Ever get all wrinkly from staying in the bathtub too long? The snorkeling 
in Sapodillas Caye is some of the best in the western hemisphere. Scuba dives, certification and resort dives will 
take place here. </li>
<li><strong>Livingston, Guatemala</strong> - In the morning we'll cruise up the Rio Dulce. a river that plunges through a huge gorge 
covered in lush green vines and trees. We'll stop at the Castillo San Felipe, a Spanish fort that was burned by 
pirates then used as a prison. It's the perfect spot for lunch. Seriously. You'll also have a chance to hit the local 
shops for that stuff you always need to bring back for somebody. </li>
<li><strong>Puerto Barrios, Guatemala</strong> - In ancient Mayan culture, priests used to drive sting ray spines through their 
tongues so they could appease their gods. We'll settle for a ceremonial dance after we visit this port town. You'll 
have your choice of touring the jungle along the Rio San Carlos or walking through the Mayan ruins of Quirigua. </li>
<li><strong>Owen&#146;s Caye / Placencia / Seine Bight</strong> - After a day of snorkeling at Owen&#146;s Caye and strolling the beaches 
of Placencia, you&#146;ll experience the haunting drums and beautiful dance of the Garifunas in Seine Bight. You also 
might feel the haunting effects of the rum punch the next morning after spending the night dancing with the natives 
at the beach barbecue.</li>
<li><strong>Monkey River / West Snake Caye</strong> - Monkey River is set along a magnificent forest where herons, egrets and 
other birds the size of small biplanes make their home. Hey, was that a croc in the water? Naaah. Just keep your 
toes inside the Zodiac please. We'll make a wet landing along the shore then wander into the trees with a few local 
guides to catch a glimpse of the howler monkey.</li>
<li><strong>Laughinbird Caye</strong> - Laughinbird is the only underwater national park in all of Belize. If you're lucky you'll see 
parrot fish, bonefish, houndfish and grunts. If you&#146;re really lucky and can breathe through a plastic tube with your 
heart pounding in your throat you&#146;ll see nurse sharks, barracudas and sting rays. This is the last night to sit under 
the stars, play dominos and share fish stories with your fellow passengers.</li>
<li><strong>Altun Ha</strong> - You'll wake up in Belize City with plenty of time to catch your flight home. For those departing later, 
there's a half-day tour of the ruins of Altun Ha. Ever see Indiana Jones? Wimp. Archaeologists found a 
nine-pound jade head carving among these ruins, the largest ever uncovered in a Mayan civilization. </li>

<p>The Temptress is a boat. And by association that makes a vacation with us a cruise. But you better not let our nature guides hear you call it that. Or the naturalists 
that lead you through hikes in the rainforest. See, we're not shuffleboard. And nobody here sports white gloves. Because when you're three miles down the 
Monkey River in a little rubber dinghy and a giant jabiru is swooping over your head, the last thing on you mind is what time the talent show starts and if you 
packed your cuff links along with your tux. With the second largest barrier reef in the world, the number one attraction in Belize is its waters. Picture snorkeling in a 
heated swimming pool. Now add a billion or so brightly colored fish plus a sunburned back and you have some idea of how you'll spend your days. And when the 
landlubber in you takes hold, don't fret. There are miles of rainforests you can hike, acres of ancient Mayan ruins you can climb and a few native dances to learn.</p>

<p align=center><a href="gua_mali.html">The Highlands: The Living Maya </a>- | -<a href="gua_mahe.html"> The Peten: The Archaeological Heritage</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The World of the Maya has many faces: some of them ancient as found carved on towering temples, others as modern as those of the people who live in 
Guate-mala today. They are the descendants of a mighty Maya people whose customs and traditions are still part of the fabric of Guatemalan life. Guatemala is a 
showcase of natural history and dramatic landscapes, yet its most distinguishing asset is the rich and colorful traditions of the various ethnic communities, such as 
K&#146;iche, Kaqchiquel and Achi. Each group has its own language, its special folklore, yet they share a common ancestral heritage as expressed in religion, music, 
dance, foods and even social organization. While Spanish and Indian cultures integrate into the country&#146;s &quot;mestizaje&quot; the purest of the Maya influences can be found 
in both the performing and design arts. The handicraft of textiles, in partic-ular, is purely Mayan and a wonderfully colorful, part of the everyday dress.</p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=10%><img src="images/gu_tk3.jpeg" align=bottom width=150 height=168></td><td width=50%>Most archaeologists agree that ancient Guatemala was the cultural center of the New World, and that the storied Mayan civilization, the 
jewel of that culture, originated in Guatemala. One of the greatest civilizations the world has ever known once centered in what is now 
Guatemala, extending through-out the nation and into neigh-boring Mexico, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras a region known as 
Meso-america. The Mayan Empire developed about 250 B.C. in the tropical lowlands of northern Guatemala and adjacent Belize 
reach-ing its peak from about 250 to 900 A.D. Arrival of the Spanish conquistadores in the 16th century spelled the end of the Mayan 
culture, which had already faded with many of its great cities and monu-ments deserted. Decline and eventual demise of the Mayan 
civilization has been variously attributed to war, famine, natural calam-ity and more obtuse causes, but the real reason is still a mystery, 
subject only to theory and conjecture. From the magnifi-cent ruins they left behind, archaeologists and scientists have learned much of the 
warlike and highly complex Maya society.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The Maya developed a unique society that boasted a rather complex social, political and scientific structure. Mayan research into the fields of mathematics, 
astronomy and the measurement of time is truly astonishing. They also developed a hieroglyphic script which has made it possible for modern scholars to interpret 
and understand their contributions to these disciplines and to Mayan history. Mayan art was equally impressive, as is evidenced by the careful urban planning of 
their ceremonial centers; their architecture based on the use of terraced pyramids; their sculpture, preserved in altars and historical monuments; the vestiges of their 
paintings; and in the beauty of their ceremonial pottery, stone and jade.</p>
<p>Literally thousands of archeological sites throughout Guatemala alone have shown the Maya to be a people of great intelligence, determination and ability. While 
Europe still languished in the Dark Ages, the Maya evolved a calendar equal to that of today. They fully compre-hended the theory of mathematics and developed 
the concept of zero. Mayan astronomers accurately traced the path of planets and predicted solar and lunar eclipses. Hieroglyphic records and iconographs have 
shed much light. Maya architects established huge pyramids and temples built aqueducts and roads, developed innovative agricultural techniques and irrigation 
systems. Accomplishments are all the more startling considering that the Maya lacked metal tools and the wheel. Sometimes called the Phoenicians of the new 
World, the Maya plied the coastal seas in huge canoes piled with trade goods.</p>
<p>According to one expert on the period as many as 4, 000 Maya canoes were at sea at any one time during the height of their culture trading in wax, honey, salt, 
furs, feather, &#145;jade and cotton. In the tropical lowlands of Guatemala, the Maya built an agrarian civiliza-tion that supported one of the high-est population densities 
in the pre-in-dustrial Americas at least 20 times what it is today. At its peak, the Maya civilization functioned through many states each run by an aristocratic family 
which claimed descendancy from the Gods and passed ruling power from father to son in the manner of royalty. One of the principal Maya site in Gua-temala was 
Tikal, now a national park in the Peten region with its immense cer-emonial center, soaring pyramids and 50 square miles of city that once had a popu-lation 
estimated at 55,000, 000, Tikal was equal to any world capital of the time, it flourished during the 3rd and 4th Centuries, representing to the New World what 
Athens was to the Old World: &quot;Birthplace of Civilization&quot;.. Abandoned by 900 A.D., Tikal lay overgrown by the humid tropical jungle until its ruins were 
discovered in 1848. It was another 100 years before archaeolo-gists excavated and reconstructed the site which today invites visitors from throughout the world. In 
1979 Tikal National Park was de-clared &quot;Patrimony of Humanity&quot; by UNESCO because its unique combina-tion of rain forest, fauna, flora and archeology. Recent 
excavations in the area of Tikal have uncovered a complex of structures which predate the existing ruins; archaeologists have named them Mundo Perdido. These 
structures were probably built during the early Pre-Classical Period (2000 B.C.-250 A.D.).Tikal is only one of the countless ar-chitectural sites already uncovered. 
Other major excavations are at El Mirador and Rio Azul, and experts estimate there are at least as many still undiscovered.</p>
<p>Other major archaeological excavations include: Uaxactun, with its oldest known stelae, the Pyramid of the Masks, the first observatory, and the oldest known 
Mayan mural in existence; Naj Tunich, El Mirador and Rio Azul, archaeological sites explored and documented by National Geographic magazine; Ceibal, located 
by La Pasion River, with its intriguingly carved monuments, dating from the Pre-Classical Period; Quirigua in Izabal with the largest stelae carved by the Mayan 
civilization, also declared by UNESCO a &quot;World Cultural and Natural Monument&quot;; and Kaminal Juyu in Guatemala City, also of Pre-Classical origin. La 
Democracia, located in Escuintla, dates back to the oldest period of the Olmec civilization that flourished near the Gulf of Mexico. </p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=50%>Minor archaeological centers of note include Mixco Viejo, the religious center of the Pokoman and Iximche, the old capital of the 
Cakchiquel kingdom, burnt by the Spaniards in 1525 in order to construct nearby the first site of the colonial capital of Santiago de los 
Caballeros. El Baul and Las Ilusiones, in Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa, were possibly inhabited by the Pipiles or Cholutecas, of Mexican 
origin. Zaculeu, of Mam origin, is located in Huehuetenango, and Utatlan, in Quiche, which was the capital of the Quiche kingdom. The 
sites have provided archaeolo-gists a wealth of material for study and the paintings and glyphs found in the tombs and temples tell the 
story of a glorious civilization, its religion, social structure, science and the men who ruled it. While the Maya civilization is gone, the 
descen-dants of these proud people live on, comprising a substantial part of the nation&#146;s population and protecting their arts, crafts, 
language and customs.</td><td width=10%><img src="images/gu_arc1.jpeg" align=bottom width=140 height=147></td></tr>

<tr><td width=22%><img src="images/chichi.jpeg" align=bottom width=279 height=153></td><td width=50%>When English novelist Aldous Huxley visited Guatemala, he referred to Lake Atitlan as 'The most beautiful lake in 
the world&quot; and this same phrase is often heard from the European and American visitors that constantly travel 
through the narrow winding road that lead to Lake Atitlan. The beautiful lake, as it is seen from Panajachel, Santa 
Catarina and San Antonio Palop6, has three volcanoes (Tolman, Atitlan, and San Pedro), as its backdrop. Lake 
Atitlan is volcanic in origin. Its surface is 1562 meters above sea level, although this figure varies somewhat from 
year to year as the lake rises and falls. The maximum recorded depth is 324 meters, but the lake is probably 
somewhat deeper in parts. It is 12 miles long and between 4.4 and 7.5 miles wide. The total surface area of the 
lake is 81.25 square miles. Traveling by car from Guatemala City, Lake Atitlan can be reached via (1) the 
Panamerican Highway up to Los Encuentros at kilometer 127, from where the road leads south to Solola and 
then to Panajachel. (2) The Pacific Coast Highway goes through San Lucas Toliman, to Godinez and there it joins 
the road along the north side of the lake. Lake Atitlan offers not only the beautiful view, but also very picturesque 
towns along its rim, that can be visited in day outings, it offers water sports and recreation of all sorts.</td></tr>

<p>Solola</p>
<p>This department, and the town of the same name, are located in the highlands 84 miles from Guatemala City. Market days are Tuesday and Friday, and it is the 
major market in the area. Its major festival, Nim Ajij Solola (Grand Day of Solola), is celebrated on August 15th.</p>
<p><a name="pan"><strong>Panajachel</strong></a></p>
<p>The main tourist center of this region is Panajachel, located on the shores of Lake Atitlan. The town dates back to preColumbian times, and today is a lively resort 
community of hotels, restaurants and shops. It is also the hub where visitors can travel by boat to other villages around the lake shore. Among them are:</p>
<p>Santa Catarina Palopo</p>
<p>The main attraction in this village, located about two miles from Panajachel, is the colorful costumes worn by its inhabitants. The women&#146;s dress consists of three 
pieces, all woven on a backstrap loom. The &quot;huipil&quot; (the Indian lady&#146;s traditional blouse) has colorful embroidered geometric patterns which are repeated, in the 
design of the men&#146;s trousers.</p>
<p>San Antonio Palopo</p>
<p>Located five miles from Panajachel, the village of San Antonio Palopo can be reached by either boat or car. The inhabitants, of Cakchiquel origin, are mainly 
involved in agriculture and the production of &quot;maguey&quot; mats and fiber goods which are woven from reeds harvested directly from the lake.</p>
<p><a name="san"><strong>Santiago Atitlan</strong></a></p>
<p>This is the largest and most traditional of the lake towns. It is reached by boat from Panajachel. The inhabitants are of Tzutuhil origin with a demonstrated talent for 
the arts: oil and water paintings and carved sculptures. The women wear a distinctive halotype headdress created by winding a long ribbon around the crown of 
their heads. Other villages on the lake shore are San Lucas Toliman, San Pedro, San Juan, Santa Ana, San Pablo, San Marcos and Santa Cruz La Laguna. The 
inhabitants of these villages engage mostly in agriculture and fishing as well as the production of textiles and woven baskets.</p>

<p><a name="chi"><strong>Chichicastenango</strong></a></p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=50%>Santo Tomas Chichicastenango, known for its Indian market held every Thursday and Sunday, is only 87 miles from Guatemala City. It 
is the commercial center of the Department of Quiche. Indians from throughout the region stream into town on market days to buy, sell, 
socialize and worship. Add the tourists attracted to the market from all over the world, and you have the colorful outdoor spectacle 
which has made Chichicastenango one of the world&#146;s popular tourist destinations. While buyers and sellers bargain for items such as 
produce, flowers and handicrafts (textiles, ceramics, carvings, basketry, wooden chests and traditional masks), MayanChristian rites are 
practiced by devout Indians on the steps of the Santo Tomas and Senor Sepultado del Calvario churches which face on either end of the 
market plaza. The Shrine of Pascual Abaj, where mystical and ancient rites dedicated to this stone idol are performed, is located on a 
nearby hilltop.</td><td width=10%><img src="images/gu_ch1.jpeg" align=bottom width=140 height=171></td></tr>
</table>
<p><a name="que"><strong>Quetzaltenango</strong></a></p>
<p>Quetzaltenango, Guatemala&#146;s second largest city, is 128 miles northwest of Guatemala City. Situated in a large valley surrounded by mountains and volcanoes, this 
highland city maintains the traditions of its MayanQuiche cultural heritage together with its colonial past and dynamic modern life. Two principal Indian towns in the 
region are Salcaja and Zunil. Salcaja is the main producer of &quot;lkat&quot; (knottie dye), and is the site of the San Jacinto Church the first church built in Guatemala. Zunil is 
famous for its textiles, and Almolonga, across the Samala River, for its large orchard.</p>
<p>Huehuetenango</p>
<p>Further north, atop the Cuchumatanes mountain range, is the Indian village of Todos Santos Cuchumatan about 31 miles north of Huehuetenango, the department 
capital city. The village is known for the brilliant colors in its costumes and the traditions centered around its annual festival held around November 1st.</p>
<p>Chimaltenango</p>
<p>Thirtyfive miles northwest of Guatemala City is the Department and town of Chimaltenango, located in the highlands of the Sierra Madre. The surrounding terrain is 
broken with deep ridges, beautiful valleys and extensive plains. The villages here are of Cakchiquel origin. Santa Apolonia is a center for the production of 
preHispanic type ceramic. Comalapa is an important center for popular Indian painting. Patzun is known for the Corpus Christi festivities the first week of June. </p>

<p>EI Peten, the northernmost department of Guatemala was once the center of the ancient Maya people. Reminders and remains of this civilization are found within an 
area covering more than 125,000 square miles and five countries. Today, we still call this &quot;El Mundo Maya&quot; the World of the Maya who lived not only in 
Guatemala, but in Belize, Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador. The development of the Maya culture covers three periods: (1) Preclassic from 2000 BC to 300 AD 
(2) Classic from 300 to 900 AD, and (3) Postclassic from 900 to 1500 AD. The sciences of mathematics, astronomy, agriculture and architecture were astutely 
developed by the Maya who also made great strides in the complex areas of sociopolitics and economics. The hieroglyphics they developed to convey their 
thoughts have not yet been totally deciphered and are found in their cortex, stelae and monuments as well as in the evolution of their ethical, aesthetic and religious 
thinking. Many of the Indian dialects, presently spoken by the different ethnic groups in Guatemala, have a common linguistic root. the Maya.</p>

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30%><img src="images/gu_tk1.jpeg" align=bottom width=347 height=98></td><td width=50%>The park covers 222 square miles amidst the thick, tropical jungle of El Peten. Created in 1958, 
UNESCO declared the park a &quot;Monument of the World&#146;s Heritage &quot; in 1979. It is regarded as one of 
the most important cultural and natural reserves in the world. The easiest access to the park is by air. 
It is just a 20minute flight from Guatemala City to the airport of Santa Elena. From there you can reach 
Tikal in 45 minutes over an excellent highway. There are more than 41000 structures or constructions 
in Tikal. The oldest date from the Preclassic period (800 BC), and the most recent from the 
Postclassic period (900 AD). It was during this period that the Maya attained their artistic, 
architectural, mathematics, agricultural and commercial heights. The most important plazas and temples 
in Tikal National Park are:</td></tr>

<h3><a name="site">EL PETEN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ceibal:</strong>	Located in the southeastern part of this department on the shores of La Pasion River. The most beautiful and best preserved stelae of the Postclassic 
period can be found here along with ceramic pieces and anthropomorphic pottery figurines. The origin of the founders is still unknown, but the first 
settlements date back as far as 800 BC.</li>
<li><strong>Yaxha:	</strong>The city is composed of two sectors of rectangular structures laid in such a manner that they form streets and plazas, Yaxha is located 50 miles from 
Flores. The hieroglyphic inscriptions indicate that it was inhabited sometime between the Preclassic and Postclassic.</li>
<li><strong>Topoxte:</strong> This Postclassic city is found in the small islands of Lake Yaxha. Its buildings are similar to those found in Mayapan, Yucatan, Mexico. Topoxte 
may be reached from El Remate at the end of Lake PetenItza.</li>
<li><strong>Uaxactun:</strong> The oldest of the Maya cites, it is believed that this is where the Maya consolidated their culture; where their writing system was perfected and 
where their calendar started Located about 16 miles north of Tikal, it is accessible from Flores. Discovered in 1916, it bloomed during the Classic period. A 
beautiful painted mural was discovered in one of the structures and here you will also find the oldest Maya stela dated about 328 BC.</li>
<li><strong>El Mirador: </strong>Of all the sites in the Maya World, El Mirador has the greatest number of structures It is located four miles from the Mexican border in 
northern El Peten, Guatemala. Excavations are presently underway so a special permit must be obtained to visit.</li>
<li><strong>El Naranjo: </strong>Here you will find impressive architectural structures and numerous stelae containing priceless information about the Maya. The most important 
monuments are a staircase covered by hieroglyphics and a ball court. Studies reveal that this city was closely related to Tikal.</li>
<li><strong>Rio Azul: </strong>It is located in the far northeast corner of El Peten, close to the borders with Mexico and Belize. Rio Azul reached its peak during the late 
Preclassic period when it served as the administrative center of a region encompassing approximately 66 square miles and more than 500 buildings The trip 
from Tikal takes about five hours along rugged paths. Therefore; the site can be visited only during the dry season.</li>
<li><strong>Nakun: </strong>Nakun is located 16 miles from Tikal on the road to Yaxha and can only be visited during the dry season. There are two large building complexes 
joined by a &quot;sacbe&quot; or causeway. Some of the structures have singular vaulted chambers and interesting stelae. Aguateca; Dos Pilas and Tamarindito are 
archaeological sites located in the Petexbatun area, El Peten southwest of Ceibal and south of Sayaxche and La Pasion River. </li>
<li><strong>Aguateca:</strong> Recommended for specialists and adventure lovers, this site is magnificent. Dos Pilas was home to elite groups between 600 AD and 760 AD 
when it was abandoned due to constant wars. It reached its peak during the late Classic period. At the site there is evidence of various causeways and of 
two concentric walls as well as stelae, carvings and a network of caves. Ceramic artifacts where recently found in a tomb probably belonging to one of its 
rulers.</li>
</ol>

two small ball courts.</li>
<li>K&#146;umarcaaj: This ancient capital of the MayaQuiche Kingdom was also known as Utatlan. Located almost 100 miles from Guatemala City, its ruins are 
evidence of a magnificent past that was burned down by the conquistadors in 1524.</li>
<li>Zaculeu: Located less than three miles from the capital of Huehuetenango. Like all the Postclassic cities it was fortified. Today, there is a small museum on 
the site.</li>
<li>La Democracia Museum and Park: This site, located 22 miles from the capital of Escuintla, is considered to be one the most ancient in the Americas. It 
contains monumental stone heads carved by the artists of the Monte Alto culture (mid Preclassic period, 1800 BC to 250 AD). Other sites in this area are 
Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa, El Baul and Las Ilusiones. All have large sculptures of the Cotzumalguapa culture which flourished during the Classic period.</li>
<li>Abaj Takalik: A recently discovered site located in El Asintal, nine miles from Retalhuleu; This is a site of impressive archaeological structures, some dating 
to the most ancient glyph period of the Americas.</li>
<li>Quirigua: Located near Puerto Barrios, in the Motagua Valley, this is a site noted for its spectacular stelae, large zoomorphal stones and a temple. It was 
probably constructed within a period of 65 years (746810 AD). The twelve stelae reveal a detailed style of singular beauty. The largest stela is carved from 
one block of stone quarried by the ancient Maya. Stela &quot;E&quot; measures 35 feet high, 5 feet wide and 5.5 feet thick. It weighs 65 tons. The zoomorphic 
structures are altars that bear commemorative dates. The temple has three chambers. One bears the last carved date in Quirigua: 810 AD. After this date, 
the history of this site stops. In 1979, it was declared a &quot;Monument of the World&#146;s Heritage&quot; by UNESCO.</li>

<hr>
<p>&#160;Only in the last few decades has the florescence of this hemisphere&#146;s prehistory and the cultures that formed the early empires risen above speculation and 
cynicism. Long before it became the Americas these continents were a myriad of large cultural and political divisions, with names reflecting almost as many dialects, 
lead by cacique&#146;s dynastic heads, and conquerors. This century spans less than one percent of the time frame man has called this region home now science is 
breaching the envelope of historical obscurity and bringing to light civiliza-tions that could read the heavens, navigate the open seas, and cure sophisti-cated medical 
problems with wild plants. Scholars are turning glyphs into words and art into recre-ations of early life styles. Unscrambling form, color and physical remnants 
re-searchers are finding that many of the social ills created within densely populated urban centers may have provided the catalyst for unrest, possibly leading to 
war, slavery and increased sacrificial offerings.</p>
<p>This short guide focuses on a few of those cultures and linguistic groups whose ancestors left legacies that reflect their accomplishments and trying to show isolated 
populations living in regions where long term evidence is impossible to gather among the humid world of the neotropical rain forests. There is much more to early 
America than the Maya and the Inca but with recent activity .surrounding the development of tourism to the countries harboring these early cultures, much of the 
world has become focused on these two cul-tures. It's easy to under-stand why, they left leg-acies the size of ten story buildings, used construc-tion methods we 
don't fully understand today, devised the methodology to develop an accurate cal-endar, and lived within a highly sophisticated social structure. Perhaps some of 
the newest theories about the demise of these early cultures will have a familiar ring, one we can all relate to. Still speculative, new research leads the growing cadre 
of investigators to look at the possibility that over population, loss of productive land and problems inherent in an overburdened society may have lead to levels of 
cultural vulnerability.</p>
<p>Beyond the edifices, the ceramics and burial sites which reflect those culture's abilities and aspirations lies another aspect of their world. The environment is a mirror 
of this former stage which has passed into this generation, scared but representative of what existed. With few excep-tions even today we can walk in their 
footsteps, look across a highland plateau or into the canopy of a tropical forest listen to the same sounds, see the same world in much the same way. Unfortunately 
some of those former environments such as the dry tropical forests of Central America and a few of the highland forests of South America's Pacific Northwest are 
all but gone or in great danger of disappearing. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="bridge">The Bridge</a></h3>
<p>The dry forests formed one of the most important biological corridors used in one of the great migration stories for more than 10,000 years. The route has a trail of 
petroglyphs few people know exists. Part of the route runs along one of the most active volcanic chains in the world, Central America&#146;s contribution to the Pacific 
ring of fire. Nearly a dozen of the Structure offer periodic re-enactment of what has been a part of the geogra-phy for thousands of years. These are important 
parts of the environmental story of the region and have been included in its protected lands. Today visitors can see jaguar and primates and visualize images of 
hunters who secured them with the Clovis point. One can climb through the stone architecture of Sacsahuaman overlooking Cuzco, run a finger down the perfect 
seams between boulders weighing as much as modem trucks and ponder the complexities of the Inca people construct-ing an edifice so large in reverence of a 
place they considered the center of the world.</p>
<p>As important as the major cultures to early pre-history are the indigenous groups who lived in smaller chiefdoms, maintained an agricultural existence and only left 
scattered remains for anthropologists and archaeologists to study. Now these remains may provide even closer links to their cultural heritage. Remote existence has 
kept many groups isolated, living in primitive condi-tions. The shaman&#146;s verbal library of medicinal plants, ancestral .stories, and secrets surrounding food gathering 
and hunting techniques are being unraveled to better under-stand yesterday's cultures. Today a few of these groups live outside the sphere of interference from 
missionaries and land developers but numbers dwindle rapidly as ancient customs give, way to new society's enticements. These people are the focus of planners in 
developing new park systems and reserves so they will remain an important part of the regions heritage. The boundaries of the Pacaya--Samiria national park in 
Peru and the Montes Azules biosphere Reserve in Mexico have both made critical boundary changes to deal with indigenous populations in the region. A few 
scattered groups especially among the Embera and Wounaan still live the way ancestors did a thousand years ago, moving about great forest floors like the Darien 
and Choco hunting for protein and gathering edible plants. Hopefully an impor-tant part of their heritage is protected from deforesta-tion and outside interfer-ence 
under the auspices of protected land trusts.</p>
<p>Part of the mystery surrounding the lands be-tween the Maya in southern Mexico and the Inca in Peru is a complex mosaic of cultural remnants. The Kuna of 
Panama and Colombia, have become a dominant force within regional and national politics, almost to the point of gaining regional autonomy in many decisions 
effecting land use change. The Misquito have assisted in the groundwork for the establishment of a Bio-sphere Reserve within Honduras that protects much of the 
ground they consider sacred. The Yaguas of Peru have been instrumental in the funda-mental development of a regional museum dedicated to the preservation of 
cultural artifacts. The movement to preserve quickly disappearing cul-tural remnants is beginning to take shape as a viable argument to the destruction of scared 
lands and this may someday work towards increasing the awareness of all history students about cultural roots.</p>
<p>Although most park-lands and reserves protect a region's national heritage, a growing number are including indigenous people and relics. This guide offers a list of 
the protected lands where visitors can see, first hand how cultural activities have been woven into the parks or reserves overall attrac-tion base. Many of the best 
petroglyphs within the geographical range of this guide are not protected and lie vulnerable. Their locations are included in many local tour formats. Touring the 
indigenous attractions of the five countries that make up the Maya World and the four countries that make up the Inca Empire re-quires some knowledge of 
regional geography. All of the available experiences offer a lifetime of travel opportunities but few can fulfill the vast majority of expectations. Large temples looming 
above forest canopies, structures hidden amid rocky crevice, or small grass huts along the banks of a tropical river all reflect a part of the past, each also has its 
own components for adventure. Its these components that can heighten spirits, in-crease adrenaline or unravel some of the mysteries surrounding these lands. To 
see a true representation of the Maya or Inca worlds would take several weeks, traveling to four or five key destinations that have important archaeo-logical sites 
and represen-tative cultural populations. To see a representative cross section of indigenous groups between those worlds would take even longer and a more 
experi-enced planner because of the distances between cul-tural attractions and limited scheduled transportation.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="maya">The Maya</a></h3>
<p>Major attractions of the Maya world are located in southern Mexico, including the Yucatan, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and EI Salvador. Tikal and the Peten 
region of northern Guatemala is a popular hub for tours that begin or end in the Yucatan and include the important sites of Honduras and Belize. Seasonality is not 
an important factor and does not hinder experiences to the major sites but rainy season can pose obstacles to anything less than a four wheel drive vehicle in many 
of the off road locations. These sites offer some of the best opportu-nities to see up close what the Maya were capable of because fewer tourist visit them and time 
is an im-portant factor in trying to visually translate stelae or architectural forms. Again, this guide lists both popular and lesser known sites within the region.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="inca">The Inca</a></h3>
<p>The core of the Inca world is in Peru. Everything radiates from here but Ecuador, Bolivia and even northern Chile have im-portant sites or exhibits within museums. 
Several of Peru's most important national parks such as Machu Picchu are dedi-cated to Inca heritage but to visit Peru and not see Chan Chan, El Brujo, Sipan, 
Tucume or Sican and Nazca would be cheat-ing yourself. Recent exca-vations in northern Peru have resulted in several of the worlds greatest archae-ological 
discoveries. Sipan and Sican are still bringing in artifacts and data that has been unprecedented to date and visitors can walk up to the tomb at Sipan and look 
down at the re-creation of one of the richest finds in history. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="beetw">Cultures In Between</a></h3>
<p>Between southern Mexico and Peru, more than 2,000 sites of cultural and bio-logical importance are being protected within a fragile framework of parklands and 
archeologi-cal zones. Some contain the vestiges of endangered fauna while others reflect the contributions of past cultures. A few combine multiple experiences 
within the concept of natural history touring. Like Tikal and Palenque they offer the visitor a dual experi-ence of cultural and envi-ronmental dimensions, pushing the 
experience into a more realistic concept Most of the protected zones in this guide offer either a biological or cul-tural experience. Focus on a preferential topic in 
each area, if its biological, determine the most important goals, birds, mammals, plants or the overall en-vironment. If its cultural, focus on the exhibits or attractions 
and try to push the experience beyond the site and into neighboring villages or towns. The Maya never disappeared, they continue to live within the same regions 
and today offer numerous op-portunities to delve into the past by visiting their mar-kets or observing their customs.</p>
<p>Add time for visits to museums which will greatly enhance the overall experience by putting many of the great contributions into perspective. To tour Tikal in awe of 
artwork that dates back thousands of years and not visit its small museum to see the drawing of the scribes hand certainly decreases the overall experience. Take 
time to stroll through local mar-kets, for explanations of how textiles are woven or medicinal plants are used even today in everyday remedies. This brings the 
environmental adventure into better perspective because the traveler can begin to piece together the whole scenario.<br>
The following quick reference list of protected lands and archeological sites is an introduction into a few of the areas that may contribute to an overall natural history 
experience. Focus on the dual experi-ence sites where a single visit can offer both the cul-tural and the environmental dimensions. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="nat">Natural Environment</a></h3>
<p><strong>Birds</strong></p>
<p>Birding within the realm of the Maya and Inca worlds is to venture into one of the most biologically diverse regions on earth. Thou-sands of species live within the 
geographical frame-work. They include some of the most sought after birds on lifelists and in dreams. A few like the resplendent Quetzal, Andean Condor, Harpy 
Eagle and even the Muscovy Duck have played important roles in cultural beliefs and festivi-ties. The Muscovy even become a cultural icon and was molded into 
gold logos like those made for the aristocrats of Sipan, in northern Peru. Quetzal feathers were traded like money and even became legal tender for the pay-ment of 
taxes. Few other regions on earth can offer the diversity and excitement of birding in this area of the neo-tropics. The list of birds in this environment show many 
endemic, endangered and a few, very rare species. Some may be extinct already and others have maintained healthy popula-tion levels in spite of major 
topographical and environ-mental changes. </p>
<p><strong>Orchids</strong></p>
<p>Between the Inca and the Maya worlds, nearly 6,000 species of orchids flourish within vast tracts of primary forest and tiny niches of endangered habitat In one 
small country, Ecuador, more than 3,000 species have been classified and experts predict that hun-dreds of new plants are still awaiting collectors. Many of the 
neotropical orchids are undergoing changes in classification as specimens are coming under closer scrutiny by a growing cadre of experts. Herbariums and large 
collectors are awaiting revised lists as new species are renamed and Mexico is probably near the top of the list of countries that is making the most changes, even 
adding a redefined genus, Mexipedium. Serious threats to many of the genera are in-creasing in the region but one of the habitats that has experienced the most 
en-croachment has been the tropical dry forest of Cen-tral America. Agriculture has also had a decisive effect on species along the slopes of the major mountain 
ranges from Peru to Mexico. More than half of the countries either have an orchid as a national or official flower including Guatemala, Costa Pica and Panama. 
They carry com-mon names like White Nun, Holy Ghost or Purple Guard and are mentioned in folklore and songs of the cultures. One of the most serious threats 
to orchids has been deforestation and habitat loss but mass collections of some species which are in demand on the international market has contrib-uted to the loss 
in regional diversity. All of the countries within the Inca to Maya World Guide have established regulations pertaining to the collection or removal of specimens from 
their wild state. Most of these have well defined regulations regarding the purchasing of specimens from licensed growers. Individuals or groups with an interest in 
learning more about the region's orchids should contact the tourism officials of each country or any of the major herbariums in the US. for details on collecting or 
purchasing of plants abroad and exporting them.</p>

<hr>
<p>... the Adventure Coast ..dive the Azure Caribbean, explore Jungle-veiled Arch&aelig;ological sites, encounter exotic wild-life or just luxuriate in the warmth of the sun. 
Belize is a well kept secret of friendly, English speaking people, English is the national language with Spanish, Garifuna, Creole widely spoken. The country is 
democratic, stable and peaceful, a preserve of virgin forest and marine wonders! </p>
<hr>
<h3>Geography of Belize</h3>
<p>Belize is located on the Eastern or Caribbean coast of Central America, bounded on the north and part of the west by Mexico and on the South and the remainder 
of the West by Guatemala. The inner coastal waters sheltered by the Barrier Reef (the 2nd largest in the world at 180 miles) is dotted with over 200 islands, atolls 
and islets called &quot;cayes&quot; extending the entire length of the country. <br>
The Belizean mainland has a low coastal plain covered with mangrove wetlands, but the land rises gradually towards the interior. The Maya Mountains and the 
Cockscomb Range form the backbone of the Southern half of the country; the highest point is Victoria Peak, at 3,699 feet in the Cockscomb Range. There are 
many rivers, waterfalls, creeks, and lagoons. A large part of the mainland consists of tropical forest. Temperatures average 79 degrees F; and can vary from 50-95 
degrees F. Trade winds cool the coastal areas and cayes most of the year; except for a couple of weeks a year, typically in August or September. The dry season 
is typically November through May; and the rainy season June through November. However, even in the dry season, brief rains are not uncommon; and 
occasionally northern storms bring rain in December and January. Belize is in a hurricane belt; there have been three serious hurricanes in the past 60 years. </p>
<h3><strong>The Weather </strong></h3>
<p>The climate in Belize is subtropical with a mean annual temperature of 79 degrees F, so you can expect a variance between 50 - 95 degrees F. There are definite 
wet and dry seasons. The dry season generally lasts Nov.-May and the wet season June - Nov. NOTE: In the tropics it's not unusual to have rain in the dry season, 
maybe just in shorter spurts. The amount of rainfall varies widely form north to south. The north receives 40 - 60 inches and in the south averages 160-190 inches 
with an average humidity of 85%.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of Belize</h3>
<p>Numerous ruins of ancient cities and pyramid-style ceremonial centers show that for hundreds of years, Belize was heavily populated by up to a million Maya 
Indians, who built elaborate cities and temples, and created advanced mathematics, astronomy, engineering and art. The Mayan empire, centered in Belize, reached 
its height between AD 300 and 900, and then rapidly declined. Historians and archeologists have several theories--war, drought, rebellion, religious and cultural 
conflict are but a few--but whatever the reason, by the time the Spanish arrived in the early sixteenth century, most of the Mayans had disappeared and their 
once-huge cities were covered over by the jungle. In 1502, Columbus sailed into and named the Bay of Honduras, but did not actually visit the area later to be 
known as British Honduras. The first recorded European settlement was established in 1638 by shipwrecked British sailors. This settlement was later augmented by 
disbanded British soldiers after the capture of Jamaica from Spain in 1655. In 1763, England and Spain signed the Treaty of Paris, but territorial skirmishes 
continued until 1798, when a small contingent of British soldiers and Baymen defeated the Spanish in a key battle on tiny St. George's Caye, putting a permanent 
end to Spain's claims to territorial rights in Belize. In 1821, Spain granted independence to Mexico and Guatemala, both countries asserted claims to Belize; the 
claims were rejected by the British government. In 1859, the British signed a treaty with Guatemala whereby Guatemala agreed to withdraw its claims to Belize and 
the British agreed to finance a road from Guatemala's capital to Belize City. (The road was never built; and Guatemala's government failed to ratify the agreement. 
Guatemala continued to periodically threaten to annex Belize until 1991, when its newly elected government finally agreed to recognize the independence and 
sovereignty of Belize.) On September 21, 1981, Belize formally became an independent nation belonging to the British Commonwealth. Belize is a parliamentary 
democracy with a high degree of electoral participation and a Constitution that guarantees basic rights and freedoms to all citizens. </p>

<h3><a name="bze">Historic Belize City</a> </h3>
<p>Belize City is the largest city in Belize, with a population of over 60,000. It offers the visitor an unusual combination of rustic, old-fashioned Caribbean charm and 
bustling modernity. The Belize river meanders through the middle of the city; and twice a day, the city's swing bridge closes to allow sail boats to pass. There are 
many traditional street vendors selling fruits, vegetables, arts and crafts in the city's public squares, especially in the colonial marketplace on Saturday mornings. 
Visitors can purchase handmade wood furniture made by the Mennonite community and many kinds of craft items from the National Handicraft center, as well as 
from the vendors who congregate near the Belize Commercial Center. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="land">THE LAND'S MAIN SITES</a></h3>
<p><strong>CROOKED TREE WILDLIFE SANCTUARY -</strong></p>
<p>Located 33 miles northwest of Belize City and just 2 miles off the Northern Highway, the Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary provides an opportunity to view some 
of Belize's fascinating wildlife. Established in 1984 for the protection of resident and migrant birds, the sanctuary consists of a network of inland lagoons, swamps 
and waterways. During the dry season (October early May) thousands of birds congregate here. Most notable, perhaps, is the jabiru Stork, the largest flying bird in 
the Western Hemisphere, with a wing span of up to twelve feel Also to be seen are a variety of herons, grebes, pelicans, ducks, vulum, kites, ospreys, hawks, 
sandpipers, kingfishers, gulls, tems, egrets, swallows and numerous others. The variety of habitats at Crooked Tree also provides food and homes for a diversity of 
other wildlife such as rare black howler monkeys, crocodiles, coatimundi and iguanas</p>
<p><strong>GUANACASTE PARK -</strong></p>
<p>Guanacaste Park is a fifty acre parcel of tropical forest located in the Cayo District, at the ' juncture of Western Highway and Hummingbird Highway, 
approximately 2 miles north of Belmopan. The park derives its name from the giant Guanacaste (tuberous) tree, one of the largest trees found in Central America. It 
can reach a height of over 130 feet, with a diameter in excess of six feet. In addition to the Guanacaste there are many other species of trees growing In the park 
including Raintree, Mammee Apple, Bookut, Quamwood, Cotton Tree, Cohune Palms and Mahogany, the National Tree of Belize. An abundance of wildlife can 
also be seen in Guanacaste Park including jaguarundi, kinkajou, paca, armadillo, agoutk white tailed deer, iguana, and several species of bats and opossum. Over 
one hundred species of birds have been spotted including Blue-crowned Motinots, Blackfaced Trogon, Smoky-brown Woodpecker, Black-headed Trogon, 
Squirrel Cuckoo, Bright-rumped Attila and White-breasted Wood-Wren.</p>
<p><strong>COMMUNITY BABOON SANCTUARY AT BERMUDIAN LANDING -</strong></p>
<p>The Community Baboon Sanctuary was established in 1985 to protect one of the few healthy black howler monkey populations left in Central America. The black 
howler monkey, known locally as the 'baboon,' is an endangered species found in Belize, southern Mexico and isolated areas of Guatemala. One of the most 
outstanding traits of the howler monkey is its loud, rasping howl which can be heard across a forest for well over a mile. The black howlers typically live in troops 
of 4 to 8. During the day they travel from one tree canopy to another, feeding and resting. Unlike any other existing wildlife management project in the world, the 
sanctuary is a voluntary program dependent upon the cooperation of private landowners. Most landowners in the 18 square mile sanctuary have signed pledges 
signaling a commitment to make their farming practices work in unison with the needs of the monkeys and other wildlife, thus protecting the howlers' habitat. A visit 
to Bermudian Landing provides visitors with an intimate view of rural Belizean life. The seven predominantly Creole villages in the sanctuary are agricultural 
communities with a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. A small natural history museum and visitors' center can be found at Bermudian Landing.</p>
<p><strong>SHIPSTERN NATURE RESERVE &amp; BUTTERFLY BREEDING CENTER -</strong></p>
<p>The Shipstern Nature Reserve is located on 22,000 acres of land in the Corozal District. This is the only protected area in Belize which includes the more seasonal 
northern hardwood forests, saline lagoon systems and mangrove shorelines. Its unique position assures the visitor of an entirely different experience in comparison 
with other Belizean reserves. The forest is exceptionally heterogeneous and is in a state of regeneration. The Shipstern Lagoon is very shallow and forms an 
important habitat for many wading and fish-eating birds. Between the forest and lagoons are wide belts of savannah, occupied by white tailed deer, brocket deer 
and tapir. While nearly 200 species of butterflies can be seen within the reserve, a Butterfly Breeding Center has been established to concentrate on the 
development of 25 of these species. The best time to visit the Breeding Center is on a sunny day. on overcast or rainy days the butterflies hide themselves between 
the foliage. The Reserve is located three miles from Sarteneja, approximately a one hour drive from orange Walk. Visitors must register at the Visitors' Center 
where guided tours are available.</p>
<p><strong>COCKSCOMB BASIN WILDLIFE PRESERVE -</strong></p>
<p>The Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Preserve is located in southern Belize near the town of Dangriga. Originally declared a Forest Reserve in 1984, two years later a 
portion of it was set aside as a preserve for the jaguar, a protected species which densely populates the Cock-scomb Basin area. The third largest member of the 
cat family, jaguars can grow up to six feet in length, usually exceeding 200 pounds. Approximately 150 square miles are now protected as the world's first jaguar 
preserve. Besides the jaguar, Cockscomb Basin is home to such other cats as the puma, ocelot, and jaguarundi. Local wildlife includes otter, brocket deer, 
peccary, agouti, paca, anteater, armadillo and the national animal of Belize - Baird's tapir (&quot;Mountain Cow'). The lush jungle of the Cockscomb Basin is also a 
birder's paradise with over 290 species recorded including the scarlet macaw, great curassow, keel-billed toucan and king vulture.</p>
<p><strong>RIO BRAVO CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT AREA -</strong></p>
<p>The Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area (RBCMA) currently consists of 202,000 acres of sub-tropical moist forest, located in the northwest corner of 
Belize in the Orange Walk District. The RBCNTA is being managed for conservation, scientific research, sustained-yield timber harvesting, non-timber forest 
product extraction, ecotourism and educational pur-poses by the Program for Belize (a private, non-profit Belizean organization whose primary purpose is the 
conservation and sustainable economic development of Belize's natural resources). Areas of upland broadleaf forest, swamp forest, palm forest, savanna and marsh 
can be found In Rio Bravo. Partly due to its remoteness and the fact that hunting has been actively eliminated in recent years, many endangered species can be 
found here, including: black howler monkeys, Central American spider monkey, five cat species - jaguar, puma, ocelot, margay and jaguarundi, tapir, white collard 
peccary, occellated turkey and brocket deer. And, for bird watchers, as of November 1991, ornithologists recorded 355 species of birds in the greater Rio Bravo 
area.</p>
<p><strong>THE BELIZE ZOO -</strong></p>
<p>The Belize Zoo is located approximately 30 miles west of Belize City and is home to over 100 species of native Belizean animals including the tapir, black howler 
monkey, scarlet macaw and jaguar. The Belize Zoo offers visitors the opportunity to see these unique animals In their natural habitat. </p>
<p><strong>BLUE HOLE NATIONAL PARK &amp; ST. HERMAN'S CAVE -</strong></p>
<p>The Blue Hole National Park is located 12 miles south-east of Belmopan. Through and under the Blue Hole National Park flow some of the upland tributaries of 
the Sibun River, one of Belize's principal waterways. Much of this central area of Belize is limestone of Cretaceous age and includes such karstic features as 
underground streams, rivers, sinkholes and extensive subterranean cave systems. The Blue Hole is a popular recreational spot where subterranean water, on its 
way to the Sibun River, emerges into the base of a collapsed sinkhole. The sink itself is said to be about I 00 feet deep and is roughly 300 feet in diameter. The 
pool, about 25 feet deep, is filled with sparkling turquoise water, chilled by a long underground journey. St. Hermans Cave is located 400 meters from the 
Hummingbird Highway and is accessible via a hiking trail from the Blue Hole. The nearest of the three known entrances is impressive - a large sinkhole funneling to 
a 20 meter entrance. Maya pottery vessels, used for the collection of 'Zuh uy Ha,&quot; or virgin water from cave drippings, along with spears and torches have been 
found in this cave.</p>
<p><strong>MOUNTAIN PINE RIDGE</strong></p>
<p>The 300 square mile Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve ecosystem is found nowhere else in Central America. Here you will find a scenic combination of cool 
pine forest, tumbling streams, lush river valleys, numerous caves and waterfalls. The air is cool; and there are many birds and sometimes large numbers of 
butterflies. The area has many sections of whitewater rivers, waterfalls, and cave systems. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hidden Valley Falls</strong> is the tallest waterfall in Central America; the views are spectacular. It is approximately nine miles from the reserve's main entrance 
east to the falls and this road is often impassable in the rainy season and no one should attempt it without a 4 wheel vehicle. </li>
<li><strong>Rio On Pools</strong> - About 8 miles southwest of the top of the falls, the road crosses the Rio On River. The giant rocks through which this tributary passes 
create little waterfalls amidst deep pools. </li>
<li><strong>Rio Frio Cave and Nature Trail </strong>- The Rio Frio Cave is the largest river cave in Belize, extending for half a mile. The cave is easily reachable from the 
road, or via the Rio Frio Nature Trail a few miles away. This cave is inaccessible during the rainy season, and damp even in the dry season. Visitors should 
be wearing sturdy, non-slip shoes. It gets darker and darker as you go further into the cave; flashlights are a necessity if you want to proceed more than a 
few hundred feet. Used as a source for raw materials, it is believed never to have been occupied by the Maya.</li>

<hr>
<p>The Maya make Belize a heaven for both archaeologist and visitors. many are the sights available and many more may still be undiscovered in the jungles of the 
country. The governments of Belize, Mexico, Guatemala, Salvador and Honduras are working together on a program which is designed to showcase and preserve 
their shared Maya Heritage. This program will transcend the political boundaries of these nations and will connect their Maya ruin sites, providing visitors with a 
complete history of the Maya Culture and access into remote areas. Most important to the Mundo Maya project is to develop this program without endangering 
the delicate ecosystems of each country.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="altun">ALTUN HA (WATER OF THE ROCK) -</a></h3>
<p>Altun Ha, the most extensively excavated of all of the Maya centers in Belize, is located approximately 30 miles north of Belize City. It is believed to have first been 
settled over 2000 years ago. This Classic Period ceremonial center, located six miles from the sea, was important as a trading center and as a link between the 
coast and the settlements of the interior. Many spectacular discoveries have been unearthed here, including the ornately carved head of Kinisch Ahau, the Mayan 
Sun God. This head, weighing 9 3/4 pounds and measuring nearly 6 inches from base to crown, is believed to be the largest Maya jade carving in existence. Also 
uncovered was the Temple of the Green Tomb, a burial chamber which contained human remains and a wealth of jade pieces including pendants, beads, figures 
and jewelry.</p>
<h3><a name="xun">XUNANTUNICH (MAIDEN OF THE ROCK) </a>-</h3>
<p>This major ceremonial center is located approximately 80 miles from Belize City, near the western border at San Jose Succotz. Xunantunich is accessible only by 
ferry which runs from Sanjose Succotz daily from 8am-5pm. The most prominent structure at Xunantunich is 'El Castillo,' a pyramid rising over 130 feet at the 
south end of the main complex. &quot;El Castillo' has been partially excavated and can be climbed on a trail that winds back and forth across its panoramic views of 
Belize and distant Guatemala.</p>
<h3><a name="luba">LUBAANTUN (FALLEN STONES) -</a></h3>
<p>This Late Classic ceremonial center, located northwest of Punta Gorda near the village of San Pedro Columbia, is not directly accessible by vehicle - there is a five 
minute walk from the road to the ruins. Lubaantun is noted for its unusual style of construction ... the large pyramids and terraces are made of precision cut stone 
blocks fitted together without mortar.</p>
<h3><a name="nim">NIM LI PUNIT (BIG HAT) -</a></h3>
<p>Preliminary excavations at this ceremonial center, discovered in 1976, indicate that it was important during the Late Classic Period. Twenty five stelae have been 
found at the site, including one measuring 31 feet in height - the largest carved stelae in Belize. Nim Li Punit is located off the Southern Highway, approxi-mately 25 
miles north of Punta Gorda, near Lubaantun.</p>
<h3><a name="lama">LAMANAI (SUBMERGED CROCODILE) -</a></h3>
<p>Lamanai is one of Belize's largest ceremonial centers, with an occupation span dating from 1500 B.C. to the 19th Century. Spanish occupation is represented by 
the remains of two Christian churches on the site. The ruins of Lamanai are generally uncleared with only a few trails in existence. Visitors can climb to the top of 
the main temple by a steep, intact stairway - a true adventure. Lamanai can be reached by road from San Felipe. Otherwise, a boat may be hired on the New River 
at either Orange Walk, Guinea Grass or Shipyard.</p>
<h3><a name="rita">SANTA RITA -</a></h3>
<p>The modern town of Corozal is built over the ancient Maya center of Santa Rita. This site was important during the late Post Classic Period and was occupied up 
to the time of the Spanish contact in the 1500's. Archaeological excavations there have shown Santa Rita to be the ancient province of Chetumal where a large part 
of the Post Classic civilization once thrived. The largest building in the central core of Santa Rita has been excavated and is open to the public.</p>
<h3><a name="carac">CARACOL (SNAIL) -</a></h3>
<p>Discovered in 1938 and later explored in the 1950's, Caracol was thought to be little more than a Maya ceremonial center. It was not until more extensive 
excavation efforts began in 1985 that the importance and expanse of Caracol became known. in 1986, a round elaborately carved altar stone was uncovered 
which described a victory by Caracol over Tikal, once considered to be the most powerful Maya metropolis. This discovery filled an important missing piece of 
Maya history, covering approximately 140 years in the Middle Classic Period, and positioned Caracol as the .supreme' Maya city. The largest pyramid in Caracol, 
The Canaa (Maya for 'sky palace') rises 140 feet and is the tallest manmade structure in all of Belize. Caracol is lo-cated south of San Ignacio and is accessible by 
road.</p>
<h3><a name="noh">NOHMUL (BIG HILL) -</a></h3>
<p>This site was a major ceremonial center occupied during the Late Preclassic and Late Classic Periods. Comprised of twin ceremonial sites, Nohmul is connected 
by a raised walkway (sache). The tallest structure at this site is also the highest point in the Orange Walk/Corozal area. Nohmul is located in the village of San 
Pablo which is easily accessible by public transportation from Orange Walk Corozal and Belize City.</p>
<h3><a name="cuel">CUELLO -</a></h3>
<p>Cuello is a small ceremonial center and of great archaeological importance, revolutionizing previous concepts about the antiquity of the ancient Maya. Prior to the 
discovery of Cueno, the Maya civilization was believed to have begun around 900 B.C. However, excavations at Cueflo have unearthed artifacts dating back to 
2500 B.C. Located only 4 miles from Orange Walk on the Yo Creek Road, the site is located on the grounds of the local rum distillery and takes its name from the 
landowners. Permission must be obtained from the owners prior to entering the grounds.</p>
<h3><a name="uxben">UXBENTON (OLD PLACE) -</a></h3>
<p>Discovered in 1984, Uxbenton is noted for its more than 20 stelae, of which 7 are carved. One of these carved stelae his been dated back to the Early Classic 
Period, a previously unknown period for Southern Belize. The site itself sits on a ridge overlooking the village of Santa Cruz, affording a panoramic view of the 
foothills and valleys of the Maya Mountains. Although Uxbenton is situated only 3 miles west of San Antonio Village, it is not reachable by public trans-portation.</p>
<h3><a name="caha">CAHAL PECH -</a></h3>
<p>Cabal Pech is a medium-size Maya center located in the Cayo District. The present name of the site is a com-bination of Yucatex and Mopan Maya meaning 
&quot;Place (or City) of Ticks&quot;; a name coined in the 1950's when the. land around the site was used for pasture. Situated along the west bank of the Macal River, 
Cabal Pech offers the visitor a panoramic view of San Ignacio Town and the Belize River Valley below. The re-markable contrast between the town and the jungle, 
which are in such close proximity, makes Cabal Pech a unique place to visit. Within a few minutes a person can leave the bustle of San Ignacio and enter an 
atmosphere where life remains in its natural state and ancient monuments become silent testimony of a grandiose civilization that once was There are no facilities at 
the site so we suggest that you carry at least a canteen of water with you. The central precinct is within a 10 minute walk, or a short drive south of the Benque Viejo 
junction of the Western Highway. The road up the hill leads you directly into Plaza B. </p>
<h3><a name="pilar">PILAR -</a></h3>
<p>Pilar is one of Belize's largest Classic Maya centers. At least 15 courtyards or plaza groups cover a 50 acre area, making it three to four times larger than 
Xunantunich. The complexity of the site suggests a long building sequence and the settlement density around the center doubles that of the surrounding area. Pilar 
lies in a part of the Cayo District which has been cultivated for years; although much of the area is under secondary growth, many milpas are situated nearby. One 
of the site's greatest potential assets is that once cleared and exposed, its panorama will probably be matched only by that from Xunantunich; it may indeed be 
possible to see one site from the other, and to speculate on their relationship and domains.</p>

<p align=center><a href="#isl">The Island </a>- | - <a href="#ref">The Reef </a>- | -<a href="bel_ham.html"> The Hotels</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The largest caye along the Belizean coast is Ambergris, and if it weren't for a very small canal separating the island from the Yucatan mainland, Ambergis could 
easily have been a part of Mexico. In fact, Mexico has occasionally staked its claim over the years. As for its name, Ambergris is a waxy substance occasionally 
found floating in or on the shores of tropical seas. San Pedro is the only town on Ambergirs and for years has been the main tourist attraction of Belize. This may 
change in the future with the development of hotels and guesthouses all over the country. But despite its many new hotels and golf carts, this small island still offers 
the &quot;feeling&quot; of old Belize and hopefully it will never change. Activities are pretty low key, but if you're looking you will find a couple of discos and bars with a lively 
nightlife. Enjoy a Belikin beer at one of the waterfront hangouts and watch the sometimes hectic but mostly quiet traffic in the harbor. It's not unusual to see a small 
sailboat balancing a car on wooden planks across its bow (the only way to get a car to the island).</p>
<h3><a name="isl">THE ISLAND</a> -</h3>
<p>Twenty-five-miles long Ambergris is three-quarters of a mile off the Belize Reef and 35 miles from Belize City. Its beach runs parallel to the reef except at Rocky 
Point where they briefly come together. Four and a half miles north of Rocky Point, at Boca Bacalar Chico, a narrow channel separates Belize and Mexico. The 
scant strait is said to have been dug by hand by the ancient Maya so that they could bring their canoes through, rather than going all the way around the peninsula. 
In dry years when water receded it was impossible to get a boat through, so in 1899 the Mexican government dug it deeper and wider to allow their warships easy 
access to the other side of the peninsula. Ambergris Caye was formed by an accumulation of coral fragments. That, along with the silt emptied nearby from the Rio 
Hondo River, has created a lovely bit of terra firma where people have been making a living since pre-Hispanic times as fisherman. The caye is made up of 
mangrove swamps, 12 lagoons, a plateau, and sand ridges. San Pedro is located on a sand ridge at the southern end of the island. Over the years the constant 
wind, rain, and tide have reduced the shoreline and beachfront of the village by 30 feet. The water surrounding the caye offers rich fishing grounds and has 
supported fisherman for more than 300 years.</p>
<p>As with the rest of Belize, the first people on the caye were the Maya. They managed to rout the invading Spaniards as early as 1508. Very little is known about 
these Maya. However, a small post-Classic site located in the Basil Jones area and a few jade and carved ornaments have been found along with obsidian flakes 
and fragments of pottery. At the southern end of the caye the ruins of Marco Gonzalez are also considered of strategic importance. It is presumed that because of 
the location of Ambergris Caye ( in the center to the sea lane) it was a stopover for Maya traders traveling up and down the coast. The island is rich in lore, some 
of which still reaches out and taps the modern islander on the shoulder. The establishment of the fishermen's co-op enabled the population of Ambergris to develop 
a good middle-class economy over the years. The financial upswing has allowed the town to improve the infrastructure of the island, which in turn has created a 
good atmosphere for tourists.</p>
<h3><a name="ref">THE REEF </a></h3>
<p>Probably the main reason that people first started traveling to Belize is its pristine dive areas. Get together with a group of serious divers and at least one will rave 
about the underwater adventure encountered in Belizean waters. Belizean waters are universally clear except where, during heavy rains, the river outlets gush 
silt-clouded water into the sea. Particularly pristine areas are around the atolls, the reef, and certain cayes. On some cases visibility is extraordinary; more than 200 
feet. Coral heads are magical with unique shapes reaching, floating, and quivering, interspersed with minute to immense fish all with personalities of their own. When 
flying over the reef and as you approach Ambergris Caye, study the seascape around the island. The Belize Reef is clearly visible, about a half mile in front of the 
island. If the plane is low enough you can see marine life suspended in the sea, coral heads, large fish, and of course, the inviting multicolors of blue that lure even 
the nonscuba diver to learn how to snorkel. You can also see the layout of the reef, how shallow the water is, and how close to the surface the corals rise, making it 
possible for even the most shallow-draft craft to cross over. Take a boat ride. Explore the Caribbean Sea in and around the many cayes of the area. Some boats 
have glass bottoms so the nonswimmer can enjoy the beauty of the sea. Snorkeling is also part of the activity on these boats - gear is readily available. Ambergris 
has joined the high tech tourist community, and most of the upscale hotels have fun toys for rent. Along with the latest in diving equipment and dive boats, fun 
seekers will find sailboards, jet skis, catamarans, and waterskis. </p>

<h1><font color="#800000"><font size=6><img src="images/bx_lam.gif" align=bottom width=72 height=72> </font></font><font color="#008040"><font size=6>THE BARRIER REEF - THE CAYES</font></font></h1>
<hr>
<p>Belize possesses the longest unbroken living coral reef in the world, second in length only to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Diving and snorkeling are second to 
none in Belize! Brain coral, elkhorn coral, star coral, sponges, seafans, parrotfish, snappers, angelfish, moray eels and sting rays are just a sampling of the 
underwater wonders just waiting to be seen. </p>
<p><strong>AMBERGRIS CAYE</strong></p>
<p>Ambergris Caye is the largest of the 200-plus cayes (islands) located off the Belizean coast. Only half a mile from the barrier reef, Ambergris Caye is a premier 
destination for scuba divers and snorkelers. Ambergris Caye receives cooling tradewinds most of the year, which keeps the temperature down and the mosquitoes 
away. San Pedro Town, located in the south of Ambergris Caye, is about a mile long and only a few blocks wide. The streets are sand, great for walking around 
barefoot and the vehicles of choice are electric golf carts, which are available for rent. San Pedro is laid-back, most of the activity happens near the waterfront - it 
has many restaurants specializing in fresh seafood (lobster and conch are plentiful and inexpensive when in season) and the Belizean national dish (spicy stewed 
chicken, served with a delicious rice and bean combination cooked with coconut juice) </p>
<p><strong>Scuba Diving and Snorkeling </strong>- The clear turquoise waters (which average 79-84 degrees) and the proximity of the barrier reef make Ambergris Caye a favorite 
destination for divers and snorkelers. The most popular destination is Hol Chan Marine Reserve, located 4 miles southeast of San Pedro. The ocean floor ranges 
from 5 to 35 feet, so both divers and snorkelers have the opportunity to swim in what seems like an underwater aquarium, teeming with colorful tropical fish of all 
sizes and types and beautiful coral formations. The &quot;cut&quot; (channel) leading out to sea functions as a sort of &quot;fish freeway&quot; for many large fish, including giant 
groupers, barracuda and nurse sharks. The rocks are home to many moray eels, who sometimes venture out in search of a meal. <br>
A special favorite of both scuba divers and snorkelers is the Sand Bar (only 8 feet depth), sometimes referred to as Sting Ray City. Hundreds of sting rays of all 
sizes congregate here, often accompanied by families of nurse sharks. The Sand Bar is not far from Hol Chan, and only a few minutes by boat from San Pedro. </p>
<h3><strong>THE OUTER ATOLLS AND THE BLUE HOLE</strong></h3>
<p>Southeast of Ambergris Caye are several groups of cayes that are popular dive (and fishing) destinations. The Turneffe chain of small islands offer diverse scuba 
environments, including shallow coral head diving, wall diving and wrecks. Blackbird Caye Resort, an ecotourism resort that doubles as a research station for the 
Oceanic Society is located here and is attractive to snorkelers because of its proximity to the reef. Lighthouse Reef is best known for its famous Blue Hole--a 
circular limestone sinkhole 300 by 400 feet that was the subject of a documentary by underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau. The Blue Hole is probably Belize's 
best known scuba diving attraction, but Lighthouse Reef is also the site of Half Moon Caye National Monument, established as Belize's first nature reserve in 1982. </p>
<p><strong>HALF MOON CAYE NATURAL MONUMENT - LIGHTHOUSE REEF</strong></p>
<p>The Half Moon Caye Natural Monument Is located at the southeast corner of Lighthouse Reef, the most eastern of the three atolls in Belizean waters. This 45 acre 
area, Belize's first National Park, established in 1982, is dedicated to the preservation of the rare Red-footed white phase Booby bird. The adult booby population 
of this Caye is unusual in having a pre-dominance (98%) of the white color phase. Other bird species which make their home on Lighthouse Reef include 
magnificent frigate birds, ospreys, mangrove warblers and white-crowned pigeons. Half Moon Caye is also home to prominent members of the lizard family: 
iguanas and Wish-Willies. Loggerhead turtles and hawksbill turtles, both	fisted as internationally endangered species, come ashore to lay their eggs on the sandy 
eastern beaches. Surrounding Half Moon Caye are waters abundant with life. From the shallow lagoon area to the southeast buttress formations, many marine 
species can be observed.</p>
<p><strong>HOL CHAN MARINE PRESERVE -</strong></p>
<p>This five-square-mile area on the southern end of Ambergris Caye was established as a national marine preserve in 1987 - the first of its kind in Central America. 
Buoys mark the area and permanent moorings have been installed to protect the fragile coral from anchors. No fishing or coral collection is allowed in this area in 
an effort to preserve the area and its inhabitants for future generations. Marine fife flourishes in this part of the reef</p>
<p><strong>THE BLUE HOLE -</strong></p>
<p>'One of the most astounding dive sites to be found anywhere on earth' is how British writer and scuba diver Ned Middleton has described the Blue Hole. Located 
at the center of Lighthouse Reef, the Blue Hole is an almost perfect circular hole, measuring 1000 feet in diameter and 80 feet deep. The Blue Hole is believed to 
have been a land cave approximately 10,000 years ago, and one of the most remarkable features of diving the cave is to discover the numerous stalactites and 
stalagmites which still exist.</p>
<p><strong>LAUGHING BIRD CAYE -</strong></p>
<p>Laughing Bird Caye is located 23 kilometers off the coast of Placencia, in the Stann Creek District of Belize. The Caye is a Faro, an angular atoll on a continental 
shelf, also known as a shelf atoll. Like atolls, faroes are steep sided and enclose a central lagoon. They are separated by deep channels from the mainland, the 
barrier reef, and one another. The Caye derives its name from the local name of the Laughing Gull. Other birds can be seen on the Caye including the Brown 
Pelican, Green Heron, Swifts, Melodious Blackbird and many other birds from the surrounding cayes and strays from the mainland. There are also a variety of 
lizards and insects on the Caye. Laughing Bird Caye can be reached with a local guide by motorboat from Placencia</p>

<hr>
<p>Blackbird Caye is located 32 miles east of Belize City in the Turneffe Atoll. Blackbird Caye Resort lies on the eastern side of the Turneffe Atoll, which is one of 
only three atolls in the Caribbean that is completely surrounded by an eliptical fringing reef. The shallow area covers 210 square miles. It is just 18 miles from Half 
Moon Caye and from there it's just 8 mile trip to the world famous Blue Hole. </p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=20%><img src="images/be_bk1.gif" align=bottom width=279 height=187></td><td width=50%>The resort offers 4,000 acres of remote, unspoiled tropical jungle, a virgin paradise preserving and encouraging study 
of marine life in a unique island habitat. Ecotrails allow you to explore the breathtaking beauty of our island. You'll 
discover natural treasure at Blackbird Caye, both in and out of the water. Explore the marine life, the tropical flora 
and fauna, the reef, the mangrove jungle, and observe all forms of life in the richest diversity of life forms on the 
planet. Blackbird is dedicated to the preservation of diverse marine and wildlife in the atoll and has established 
Blackbird Resort as an ecotourism facility to promote and protect this area. The exceptionally clear and unspoiled 
waters, make this the ideal location for snorkeling. The shallow waters inside the reef provide excellent snorkeling for 
beginners. Brain coral, elkhorn coral, star coral, angelfish, seafans, sponges, snappers, parrot fish, moray eels and 
sting rays are just a sampling of the underwater wonders just waiting to be seen in less than 8 foot depths. </td></tr>
</table>
<p>Here you can alsodive vertical walls just beyond the coral reef in front of your cabana extend for miles in both directions. They offer divers unlimited opportunities 
to experience large tubular sponges, gigantic basket sponges, purple sea fans, inquisitive reef fish, barracuda, schools of permit and jellyfish, sea turtles, lobster, 
crab and snapper. Or you can fish the reef, the many creeks, channels and flats of the Turneffe Islands. And waht a choice, bone, permit, tarpon, grouper, 
barracuda, snapper or snook. Beyond the reef you will find marlin, sailfish, wahoo and king. Many fly-fisherman come to Blackbird to stalk the elusive bonefish, an 
almost transparent fish known for its feisty spirit and crafty ways. Blackbird is home to the very rare golden bonefish. A unique fishing experience where 
sportsfishermen can enjoy catch-and-release fishing. All the joys of the ocean are to be found in the water at Blackbird.</p>
<p>A chance to relax and enjoy the simple thatched roof cabanas, with private baths, that are cooled by natural trade winds off the pristine waters. A remote, private 
jungle island paradise where you can enjoy Island cuisine prepared with native foods by a Belizean cook and served buffet style in a unique dining palapa, by a 
gracious staff that is friendly and eager to serve you. </p>

<hr>
<p align=left>Honduras is the second largest country located on the Central American Isthmus and is bordered by Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. To its north lies the 
Caribbean Sea and to the south the Pacific Ocean. Much of the country is mountainous, with lowland areas in the north east which follow the coastline east The 
Caribbean Bay Islands offer some of the most pristine beaches left in this area. Three-quarters of the country is composed of rugged hills and mountains, lowlands 
are found only along the coasts and in major river valleys. The climate in Honduras varies between the mountainous interior and the coastal lowlands and between 
the Pacific and Caribbean coasts. The interior is much cooler than the humid coast, and temperate Tegucigalpa has maximum temperatures varying between 25 and 
30 degrees Celsius. The dry season, or verano, in Honduras is from December through April , with March and April being the hottest and driest months. The rainy 
season, or invierno, is from May through November and the wettest months are August and September. Honduras was the original banana republic, and is still one 
of the least developed and industrialized countries in Central America. </p>
<p>&#160;In many ways, Honduras is a country of extremes. The topography as well as the density and distribution of the population are inseparable from its history and 
character. This land of contrasts, with its 44,835 square miles, forms the second largest republic in Central America. Its triangular shape creates a northern border 
on the Caribbean Sea that extends about 386 miles. This forms a strategic extension of coastline and beaches. Moving inland, green valleys are drained by the 
numerous rivers born in the surrounding mountains which cover about 80 percent of the national territory. Such a basic topographical pattern of rugged interior and 
lowlands relatively close to the coast creates a dichotomy that is reflected in Honduras' social and economic development, particularly between the northern coast 
and the interior land. Pristine islands and sandy beaches off the Caribbean Sea move into the forested peaks of the Central American Andean highlands, breaking 
the territory into two fundamental orographic groups: east and west. Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean and its beautiful beaches lie beyond the mountains. Rivers with 
indigenous names do not let us forget the incredibly beautiful regions filled with unique flora and fauna, the Rivers Chamelecon, Ulua, Aguan, Patuca, Choluteca, 
Goascoran, Nacoome and Negro. Also, the nation has many lakes and lagoons; the largest is Lake Yojoa, also known as Taulabe, situated about 2,095 feet above 
sea level.</p>
<p>But the most precious jewels are found in the surrounding archipelagos, like those in the Caribbean Sea. There are several, but the Bay Islands&#151;encompassing the 
islands of Roatan, Utila and Guanaja&#151;are world-renowned for its coral reefs. So are the Cisne Islands, also called Santanilla or Santillana. Another archipelago in 
the Pacific Ocean comprises the islands of Zacate Grande, El Tigre, Violin, Matate, El Jicaro and Perejil. In order to conserve these natural treasures and the 
country's unique flora and fauna, the Honduran government has established reserves and national parks. One can especially appreciate the country's natural 
splendor in the large tracts of protected land in the provinces of Gracias a Dios, Colon, Yoro, Olancho, and Francisco Morazan. In the very heart of the country is 
the capital city of Tegucigalpa. San Pedro Sula, an industrial center and one of the fastest-growing cities in Latin America, is situated in the north. As the country's 
second city, it is a departure point for many travelers who are interested in nearby attractions like the Caribbean beaches and the idyllic Bay Islands. The Pacific 
coast in the south is home to the provinces of Valle and Choluteca; Amapala and other islands are in the Gulf of Fonseca.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="central">CENTRAL ZONE</a></h3>
<p>As a main tourist attraction, the Central Zone has Tegucigalpa, the political center of the nation. The city's topography and urban design reflect its colonial mining 
town origins. A generator of great cultural activity and commerce, Tegucigalpa is also a stepping stone to the nearby picturesque towns of similar mining origins: 
Santa Lucia, Valle de Angeles, Cedros, San Antonio de Oriente and Yuscaran. Special mention must be made about Comayagua, Honduras' first capital. Its 
nostalgic air of old traditions conserves a great part of the religious patrimony and architecture from colonial Honduras. In fact, the town's historic central district is 
home to a handsome cathedral and other edifices built during colonial times. Meanwhile, from Tegucigalpa, connections to the exterior can be made by way of the 
Pan American Highway in the south, a region that is home to Choluteca, its tourism center. Also found there are Nacoome, Tiger Island, and the beaches bordering 
the Gulf of Fonseca. <a href="hon_tegu.html"><font size=4><em><strong>Tegucigalpa and surrounding area</strong></em></font></a></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="north">THE NORTHERN ZONE</a></h3>
<p>The nation's Caribbean coast has a skirt of lowlands and beaches that seem to be guarding the El Merendon Mountains. It extends from the valley of the Ulua River 
toward San Pedro Sula, the nation's second largest city with a population of 400,000. The Caribbean region has the most fertile and productive lands in all of 
Honduras. Plantations of bananas and other fruit grown for export cover thousands of acres in this area. There has been an enormous demand for Honduran fruit in 
recent years and this has led to a huge expansion of plantations operated by companies that have been active here since the early days of this century. Today, San 
Pedro Sula is figuratively a long distance away from its origins as the city of Puerto Caballos, founded five centuries ago by Pedro de Alvarado in the Valle de los 
Pajaros, or Valley of Birds. From a small agricultural town, it has transformed itself into a dynamic urban center. In fact, it is one of the most industrialized in Central 
America, with repeated surges of economic growth and steadily increasing population. <a href="hon_nor.html"><font size=4><em><strong>San Pedro Sula and North area</strong></em></font></a></p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="bay">BAY ISLANDS</a></h3>
<p align=left>Thirty miles off the northern coast of Honduras, the Bay Islands group is an oval chain of eight islands and 65 small cayes forming the largest and most southerly 
chain of Caribbean islands at the end of the barrier reef. The islands have been inhabited for more than 1,000 years and have an interesting history, including 
evidence of Maya occupation. Columbus landed here during is 4th voyage in 1502 and the islands were used by British, Dutch and French pirates as a base for 
raids on Spanish treasure ships during the 18th century. <strong>Utila</strong> is a low sandy piece of land and the cheapest of the Bay Islands to visit and basic budget 
accommodation and facilities predominate <strong>Roatan</strong> is the largest and most popular of the Bay Islands, also the most expensive Some of the resorts here rank 
among the best sun and sea destinations in the world -<strong> Guanaja</strong>, the easternmost of the group, was declared a forest reserve in 1961 and is now also a marine 
national park. Diving and other aquatic activities again are the main attractions. <a href="hon_bay.html"><font size=4><em><strong>The Bay Islands in more detail</strong></em></font></a></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="copan">COPAN</a></h3>
<p>The ruins of the monumental Mayan city-state of Copan are about 96 miles west of San Pedro Sula. Despite the passage of time and the force of nature, Copan 
preserves the grandiosity intended by that civilization of mathematicians, astronomers and architects. Although their origins go back to about 435 B.C,, the Mayan 
Classical Period has been determined by scholars as having fallen between the seventh and eighth century AD In 1200, the city of Copan was abandoned by its 
more than 30,000 inhabitants. The quickly growing surrounding jungle took it over. The biggest attraction at the ruins is its ceremonial center, with a vast display of 
buildings, stairs, and platforms. It has strategically placed intriguing monuments of intricate designs. Even today, researchers are continually amazed by how 
advanced the Maya civilization was, During the excavations made within Copan, a complete and complex residential area was uncovered adjacent to the 
ceremonial center, it has been restored. Under the pyramids of the Copan temple, hidden prayer rooms, tombs and other structures have given scientists a greater 
understanding of the Maya. It is hoped that these and each new discovery will bring us closer to the mysteries of this great civilization. The Regional Museum, 
situated in the center of the small town of Copan-Ruinas, has a fascinating collection of artistic objects from that era. The collection includes the original sculpted 
facade of the recently restored residential sector. <a href="hon_cop.html"><font size=4><em><strong>Copan in detail</strong></em></font></a></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="south">THE SOUTHERN ZONE AND THE PACIFIC ISLANDS</a></h3>
<p>Choluteca, capital of the province with the same name, is the largest city in the southern part of the country. It is an important agricultural and commercial center, a 
kind of hub for the traffic moving to the southern region. This southern part of Honduras opens onto the Pacific Ocean by way of the Gulf of Fonseca&#151;shared with 
El Salvador and Nicaragua&#151; and comprises a series of high mountain ranges that gradually give way to savannas. The Spaniards discovered the Gulf of Fonseca in 
1522, and they named it as such in honor of Bishop Juan Rodriquez de Fonseca. In 1578, the English pirate Sir Francis Drake occupied it, using Tiger Island as a 
base for his attacks on the rich colonial communities in Peru and Baja California. It is said that the buccaneers left an immense treasure hidden in the area, but no 
one has yet found it' What is certain is that the true riches are in the waters of the gulf&#151;rich in fish, that is, particularly sailfish, dorado and tuna. The handsome fan 
of the archipelago contains 30 islands, the largest being Tiger and Zacate Grande. Tiger Island, with its ancient port of Amapala, is the best known and is easily 
accessible from various points on the coast. The white sands, the transparent waters, the beautiful flora and fauna of these islands offer a paradisiacal place for rest 
and recreation. From the beaches to the majestic peaks of the once-active volcanoes, visitors will find miles of green footpaths to take them places&#151;all within their 
reach.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="mosq">THE MOSQUITO COAST AND EASTERN HONDURAS	</a></h3>
<p>The region known as La Mosquitia makes up the northeastern part of the country. It is quite different from the rest of Honduras, for its vast coastal plain is sparsely 
populated, and covered by forests. There, the landscape is only occasionally cut by winding rivers. No roads lead toward the interior of this vast land. Again, the 
majority of it is unpopulated. There are, however, a few indigenous communities who live in La Mosquitia. These are the Miskito Indians, and small tribes of Paya 
and Sumo, all distinct in their cultures. In this land, travelers who love adventure and unspoiled nature will discover the enchantment that perhaps is only found in the 
most hard-to-reach places, like the Mato Grosso in Brazil. It is one of the lesser-known and explored lands in Central America, The largest town in the area is 
Puerto Lempira, with a population of 5,600. It is situated on Caratasca, a shallow lagoon. Visitors are sure to spot manatees, along with hundreds of species of 
birds and fish, in and around this lagoon that abounds in wildlife. Despite its inaccessibility, there are excursions to the Mosquitia by way of the Platano and Patuca 
Rivers. Furthermore, trips can be made by traveling along the coastline. In other words, this is a region for travelers who want to see one of the planet's 
least-explored places.</p>

<hr>
<p>&#160;Because of excellent land and air communications, temperate climate, and surrounding fertile lands, San Pedro Sula is a choice destination for many travelers 
leaving from the capital or from Puerto Cortes on the Caribbean coast. Many visitors are drawn by the city's reputation for fresh seafood and quality fruits and 
vegetables. Another draw for travelers are the many interesting places just outside of San Pedro Sula. For example, the Pulhapanzak Waterfalls, on the River 
Lindo, with a canyon surrounded by a thick tropical forest. What is more, the Saint Barbara National Park has one of the highest peaks in the country&#151; Maroncho 
Peak, at about 9,000 feet above sea level.</p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=8%><img src="images/ho_lk1.jpeg" align=bottom width=120 height=202></td><td width=50%>Additionally, Yojoa Lake has one of the most beautiful environments in the entire region. It is bordered by cypresses, and, beyond them, the 
mountains rise to meet the skies. Sports fishermen love this lake because it is excellent for catching bass. Just under an hour's drive north 
travelers will find two places worthy of visiting: Omoa and Puerto Cortes. The latter, just 34 miles outside of San Pedro Sula, is important 
because the nation's first free zone was established there in 1976. This main Honduran Caribbean maritime port and primary naval base is 
constantly growing. Part of the growth can be attributed to the assistance it receives from the government. However, its proximity to other 
ports, such as New Orleans and Miami, with only a two-day distance by freighter, can account for much of its continuing expansions. Nearby 
are first-rate beaches: Coca-Cola, Baja Mar, El Faro and Travesia, easily accessible and very popular with tourists and residents alike. The 
northern zone is also unusual because it is the home to the Garifunas, or Black Caribs, the descendants of the African slaves and indigenous 
Caribs of the Antilles. Centuries ago the English brought them to Honduras by force to avoid a possible uprising in their then Caribbean 
colonies. With the exception of Haiti, the Garifunas today make up the most African of the ethnic groups living in the Caribbean Basin.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Their African roots are reflected in their language and traditions, which can be appreciated by certain cultural manifestations: artisanry, ceremonies, dances, and 
customs. Some nine miles north of Puerto Cortes are the ruins of the fortress of San Fernando de Omoa, built in 1777 by order of King Fernando of Spain. It was 
intended to protect the coast from pirates. The fort's thick walls have resisted earthquakes and hurricanes, but were not able to stand up to the cannonballs of the 
English fleet The fort was captured after a siege of four days, mere two years after it opened North of San Pedro Sula, near the port city of Tela, there is a large 
concentration of Garifuna communities. Tela, with about 70,000 residents, has played a key role in the economic development of the country. Small Caribbean 
villages like La Ensenada, El Triunfo de la Cruz, or San Juan are wonderful because, besides their charm, they are great places to enjoy the good cooking of the 
Garifunas. Some of the specialties are fish in coconut milk, and seafood soups. And they&#151;as well as others on the most beautiful beaches in the country&#151;are often 
the sites of extraordinary presentations of Garifuna folklore.</p>
<p>Tela is a port town characterized by its incessant movement as a free exporting center, especially bananas and pineapples. The center of town maintains a 
picturesque and nostalgic air, with many interesting places to visit, among them the Lancetilla Botanical Gardens. This garden, created as a tropical research station 
by the United Fruit Company in 1926, spans about 1,800 acres. Here is one of the best botanical collections in the world, especially when it comes to tropical 
plants. Many plants are very rare and were first planted here, then transplanted to the rest of Central America. Certainly, Tela can be divided into two cities: the old 
and the new In the older section of town, bungalows are popular dwellings. They are characteristic of the housing provided by fruit companies during the first half of 
the century They are wooden with zinc roofs. The windows are covered with screens and have canvass awnings to protect against the sun and rain. These 
cabin-like houses, however, are in sharp contrast with the more modern part of town, where building materials and architectural styles are quite varied. The modern 
district also has more commercial and tourist activity, which is radically different from the tranquil and bucolic atmosphere maintained in the older neighborhoods. 
Approximately an hour away is La Ceiba, the nation's third largest city. It is sheltered by the Nombre de Dios Mountains, whose Bonito Peak reaches almost 
8,000 feet above sea level, surrounded by banana and pineapple plantations. The town is named after the ceiba tree, which apparently was used as a reference 
point for travelers and as a meeting point for local barterers and traveling traders' Today, La Ceiba is home to an active community of 81 ,000 inhabitants. </p>
<p>Each year during the spring, thousands of visitors come to the city to take part in the Festival de San Isidro, or Great National Carnival. It is held the last week in 
May, and festivities include a parade, Garifuna and Caribbean dances, multi-colored costumes and musical concerts&#151;all conducted in a joyful spirit. As an 
Honduran popular saying goes, &quot;Tegucigalpa thinks, San Pedro Sula works, and La Ceiba celebrates.&quot; And &quot;celebration&quot; is a word that best sums up the marvelous 
expressions of folklore and color that make up the spring festivals, always held on the third Sunday in May. Other neighboring places of interest include the Bonito 
Peak National Park, best known of the forest reserves in the country. It has a great hiking path for those who would like to climb to its highest point. Lookouts are 
accessible for a panoramic view of spectacular Yoro and Punta Sal mountain peaks as well as Trujillo Bay. On this bay is a city of the same name. </p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=50%>In fact, Trujillo is Honduras' oldest city, founded in 1525 by Francisco de las Casas. Near there, Christopher Columbus 
landed on the continent on August 14, 1502, having come from Jamaica on his fourth and last voyage. The first Mass on the 
continent was celebrated there. And through the centuries, Trujillo was an important Spanish port. As such, it received the 
attention of the crown. Defensive fortresses, like Santa Barbara, were built there, and its ruins can still be seen near the town's 
central plaza. Raided and destroyed by Dutch pirates in 1643, it lay in ruins for more than a century until it was reconstructed 
in 1787. The people of that period made an effort to preserve many architectural structures, as well as many objects, which 
can be viewed in a local museum.</td><td width=15%><img src="images/ho_for.jpeg" align=bottom width=220 height=152></td></tr>

<hr>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=40%><img src="images/ho_is1.jpeg" align=bottom width=425 height=191></td><td width=50%>Because of their incomparable natural beauty, the three idyllic Bay Islands, just 30 miles off 
the northern coast of Honduras, are some of the most visited places in the entire country. A 
coral reef, second only to Australia's Great Barrier Reef, is the major draw. As the world's 
second most important reef, both for its size and beauty and extending into Honduran 
territory from Belize, it attracts divers from all over the world. The small archipelago has 
three main islands&#151;<strong>Roatan, Guanaja </strong>and<strong> Utila</strong>&#151;and more than 60 islets and keys. 
They are remnants of an underwater mountain range that was once connected to the Omoa 
Sierra Mountains on the mainland. The volcanic peaks are encircled by ancient coral and 
limestone rock. The people of these islands are a synchronism of origins and cultures, </td></tr>
<tr><td width=40%><img src="images/ho_is2.jpeg" align=bottom width=425 height=191></td><td width=50%>maintaining some characteristics and unusual traditions of the English. Their ways are 
derived from the successive colonial occupations and migrations to this virgin territory. 
Ever since Christopher Columbus landed on Guanaja Island on July 30, 1502, the entire 
archipelago it belongs to, was desired by many. The Spaniards first enslaved the 
indigenous Payas, and a mere 26 years later, there were none left alive. Although they 
were the first colonizers, the Spaniards did not stay for long. English privateers and pirates 
landed in the islands, making them a base from which to attack the Spanish ships that 
traveled those maritime routes, heavy with the riches gathered in America. After several 
failed attempts to end the attacks on their ships, in March 1782, Spain attacked Port 
Royal, the largest settlement in the islands, by land. They killed most of the people and 
enslaved the remainder. From that point on, the islands were not populated. Then, in 1797</td></tr>
</table>
<p>the English brought 4,000 Garifuna Indians to Roatan. They lived there until 1859, when the islands were ceded to Honduras. However, English remained the 
official language. Some decades ago schools there began teaching Spanish. The dream of pirates and adventurers, the mountain peaks of these fantastic, unspoiled 
Bay Islands rise from the middle of a thick forest, an echo of the larger rain forests on the mainland. </p>
<p>The difference is that these smaller island forests are surrounded by the Caribbean's crystalline, warm waters. All the nautical and underwater activities are possible 
in the paradise that forms the Bay Islands. Small cayucos, or motorized canoes, traverse the emerald waters of the quiet lagoons. The islands are bordered by white 
sandy beaches dotted with elegant, sleepy palms. Small island towns are characterized by picturesque houses on stilts, bunched together at the edge of the sea, 
facing the waves that break on the coral reef. Yet there is a counterpoint to the natural beauty and splendor of the marine life at one&#146;s feet. Travelers will find the 
<a name="isl">comforts</a> of civilization in the tourist lodgings and hotels. Accommodations here are unique, and they all maintain an island atmosphere. </p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=50%><img src="images/ho_roa.jpeg" align=bottom width=490 height=137></td><td width=50%>The largest and most populated of the group of islands is Roatan, with its 10,565 
inhabitants. It is 30 miles from the coast of Honduras, at the same latitude as La 
Ceiba. The island is 28 miles long and becomes quite narrow at one end. A spine 
of highlands comprise the island's center, the highest point reaching 1,207 feet. 
Roatan has an international airport. Good paved roads take travelers from 
tourism centers and coastal villages to the small town of Coxen Hole, named after 
the famous pirate. It is the largest town on the island.</td></tr>
</table>
<p></p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=50%><a name="ut">Coxen</a> Hole has good hotels and restaurants with a wide selection of dishes. There are inexhaustible possibilities on menus, thanks 
to the variety of tropical fruit like mangos, guavas, mamey, almond and breadfruit. What is more, the shellfish is abundant and so 
are the many types of finfish. After dinner, you may want to dance at the discotheque in French Harbor. The coral reef encircling 
Roatan is notorious for its coral gardens near the coast. On the very eastern part of the island, they unite and form one point that 
faces Utila Island, which is the closest to the mainland. While Utila Island's handsome beaches and spectacular underwater sights 
are a main attraction, it also has a grouping of picturesque houses perched on the edge of the sea: East Harbor. There, fishing is a 
way of life for many of the natives, many of whom may break championship records with their amazing fish catches. </td><td width=13%><img src="images/ho_uti.jpeg" align=bottom width=200 height=125></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Two other islets that are interesting are Cochino Grande and Pequeno &#151;also known as the Cochino Cays, just 11 miles off the mainland. As it only shelters a small 
fishing village, the Cays are a veritable paradise for those who like tranquillity and the welcoming nature of the warm Caribbean islands. The extreme eastern side of 
Roatan is mostly mangroves, bordering a narrow canal that separates it from Helene, a neighboring island. One must pass by Helene to reach Morat, a green 
hillock rising from a turquoise sea. Then, the island of Barbareta follows, a place where nature has surpassed its own beauty. The privately owned Barbareta is 
open to the public. It's a piece of paradise on earth&#151;a postcard of green, tropical forest surrounded by beaches, with strings of palms washed by crystalline waters 
and a mountain topped by authentic indigenous monticulus. In addition, just off the coast, is a trio of sandy islets&#151;Pigeons Cays. Their waters are ideal for 
snorkeling, and the beaches are wonderful places for picnics. Equally attractive are Trunk Turtle Bay Brach and Jade Beach, on the northern coast of the barely 
<a name="gua">deserte</a>d islands, which are among the most natural in the entire world.</p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=13%><img src="images/ho_gua.jpeg" align=bottom width=200 height=132></td><td width=50%>Some 11 miles from Barbareta is Guanaja, the second largest of the Bay Islands, its highest point reaching about 1,700 feet above 
sea level. It is shaped like an arrow. This mountainous island has a coastline dotted with sleepy palms; the finishing touches are its 
hills covered with pine trees. On Guanaja, there are only three residential areas. One, the village of Bonacca, is on an artificial islet 
just off the island. The people of Bonacca use canoes as transportation, as the houses are built on piles on the water. Guanaja 
Island has a landing strip, but lacks roads. Pine forests, beautiful beaches and numerous rivers&#151;perfect for exploring. The sea is a 
fantastic turquoise color everywhere, inviting deep sea divers into its depths. The place is considered by experts as one of the 
world's best diving spots. </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The reefs off these islands have enormous coral formations with more than 65 species of rocky polyps leading to steep cliffs, most of them drop-offs. Furthermore, 
both inside and outside the walls of the coral reefs, an incredible variety of marine flora and fauna thrive&#151;sponges, seafans, marine whips, and deep water fans. 
Marine life from both the coral reefs and deep oceans abound in these waters. The islands maintain the richest collection of coral pillars in the world, In the case of 
Roatan, both of the island's coasts have continuous opportunities for scuba diving. </p>
<p>The coral reef on the north is almost a solid barrier with just a few ruptures near the coast. Perhaps the main attraction is off the island&#146;s extreme eastern part, 
where steep slopes occur in the southern and another in the northern part of the reef. They are separated by a narrow meseta. Some of the most popular diving 
spots include Half Moon Way Wall, with a wide variety and colorful selections of sponges; West End Wall, with a dive that is absolutely vertical; Bear's Den, 
where, under the sea's surface, a coral cavern winds under an enormous reef. South of Roatan, the reefs are impressive; generally, they are close to the coastline, 
Nevertheless, further out, another phenomena frequently occurs. The reefs join together with islets and sometimes they open up at the entrances to bays and 
lagoons. Another unusual topographical feature on the great reef is created by the presence of a sandbar that is pretty far off the coast, where the Coxen Hole 
International Airport is. There are impressive opportunities for diving there, sought after and frequented by those &quot;in the know.&quot; </p>
<p>Such is the case of the Valley of the Kings, a coral crevice filled with sponges, or the Prince Albert Shipwreck, an island freight ship that sank to a depth of 56 feet. 
Still another is Mary's Place, which is reminiscent of a spectacular underwater Colorado canyon. Despite these very poorly described marvels, there are places on 
the islands that have barely been explored. In the case of Utila Island, few scuba divers have been in its waters, although it is known that acres of coral gardens are 
in its depths. In fact, skin and scuba divers are the main protagonists in any underwater adventure. At any hour of the day or during night dives, these fortunate 
people have a whole different world to admire or photograph. Finfish, octopus, seahorses, and others await them. </p>
<p>One of the most important areas for scuba diving off the coasts of Barbareta is an almost mile long fall off the southern coast, known as Barbareta Wall. The coral 
reefs there are complete with enormous barrel and basket sponges, along with a myriad of different kinds of fish. As for Guanaja, its northern coast offers divers a 
great coral barrier leading to the depths, but descents in some places begin at about 80 feet. Many of the sites are well visited, such as in the case of a series of 
medium-high walls and a labyrinth of coralline canyons with lava formations inside the main reef. However, the most interesting dives in Guanaja are Jim's 
Silverlode, Black Rock Canyon and Devil's Cauldron, where thousands of groupers meet in the winter to spawn. The Jado Trader is the best sunken ship a modern 
freight ship, intact, home to thousands of fish and sometimes even to sea turtles. Expert scuba divers will find thousands of interesting routes in the reefs. Complete 
diving gear and equipment can be rented in the islands, Novices can opt to take beginning courses at any of the tourist complexes on the islands Also, a 
professionally maintained decompression chamber is on Roatan. In order to better protect the reefs from occasional damage from anchors, there are permanent 
places to tie boats to. Underwater visibility is generally between 80 to 1 00 feet, and during most of the year, water temperature is between 75 and 85 degrees F 
Numerous national marine parks have been established in the area, like in Barbareta and Guanaja, as well as a reserve off the northern part of Roatan. Guanaja's 
protects close to 90 percent of Barbareta, including its surrounding reefs. </p>
<p>The Caribbean islands are paradise on earth, with an abundant and incredible animal and plant life, and the same is true for their underwater environments. The 
white egrets wade in the sand-bars near the mangroves while the colorful parakeets chatter. We cannot forget the native yellow mussels, the opossum or iguanas. 
The agouti is a strange rodent that resembles a rabbit; it inhabits the hills and in the brushwood. If you get to know the natural footpath on Baily Cay, north of 
Roatan, you will be able to find all these creatures and others, like the white-faced monkey, the spider monkey, and huge red macaws. As for fishing, there are 
plenty of needlefish, sailfish, wahoo, mackerel, pike, and barracuda. One may rent boats and fishing equipment on the islands, and even take part in international 
tournaments held every summer in Roatan, It was precisely here, in the Bay Islands, in the waters off Guanaja, where Columbus, during his fourth voyage to the 
New World, ran across a commercial canoe traveling from a land called Maiam. This encounter is considered the first contact between the European and American 
cultures. After the extermination of the indigenous Payas by the Conquistadors, the islands were populated by lumbermen from Belize, black Caribs from Saint 
Vincent, political refugees from Cayman Islands, slaves from plantations from all over the Caribbean, and French, Dutch, English, and Scottish pirates. To launch 
his attack on Panama, Henry Morgan chose Roatan for his base Today, there are still those who look for buried treasures here. Certainly, there are many ancient 
sunken ships in these waters. Throughout the island one finds old bottles of rum and other relics left behind by the pirates. But the true treasure is before one's very 
eyes, the natural splendor and marvel of these islands. To paraphrase the Grand Admiral when he arrived in these American lands, they truly do deserve to be 
called the most beautiful land that human eyes will ever see.</p>

<hr>
<p>&#160;In the land known today as Honduras, the Maya-Toltec culture was born 3,000 years before	Christ while Europe was still considered a land of barbarians. 
Scientists consider the Maya-Toltec civilization to have become the most developed indigenous culture in the world. Without a doubt, it was the most advanced in 
Middle America. Copan&#146;s Pyramids, temples, and stone monuments justify the claim. They are in the northwestern zone of Honduran territory, near the border with 
Guatemala. At Copan, Mayan structures date back to at least 1000 years BC. Nevertheless, in the 1 0th century AD, this colossal metropolis of 3,450 buildings 
and more than 15,000 inhabitants, was mysteriously abandoned. So were several other Mayan city-states.</p>
<p>The grandiosity of the ruins astonishes visitors. They are a testimony to the abilities of a civilization of astronomers and mathematicians, a people who discovered 
the zero centuries before the Europeans. It was a culture that bred magnificent architects to design huge temples and pyramids, as well as aqueducts and roads that 
united their empire. Historic testimonies speak of the importance of corn in the Maya-Toltec civilization. It was the Mayan-Toltecs who began the cultivation of the 
golden kernel. It spread through the Americas and then the rest of the world Because of its nutritive value and variety, corn became and remains a main staple in the 
diet of many nations. </p>
<p>The archaeological zone of the Mayas extends from the Tehuantepec Isthmus in Mexico to Honduran territory in Central America. Today, Guatemala, Belize and 
Honduras encompass the land that once belonged to them. In this vast geographical region, there are a number of archaeological ruins. Scientists come to unveil the 
mysteries of hieroglyphics, engraved stelae, altars, ceramic and jade objects in the land of the ancient centers, like Copan, Tikal, Chichen Itza and Uxmal. While the 
area is rich in minerals, the inhabitants only utilized the precious stones, particularly jade, and some metals like gold and silver, with sumptuary ends in mind. Stone 
was mostly used for building structures and monuments. It was also used to make construction tools, fishing implements, household utensils and weapons. </p>
<hr>
<h2 align=left><a name="cop">Copan</a> </h2>
<p align=left>The Copan Valley is the site of some of the most important sources of information on the ancient Maya civilization. The ancient city of Copan has always been 
referred to as the most artistically advanced and elaborate of all the Maya cities. The principal attractions are the main park, Las Sepulturas, Los Sapos, the 
museum located in the town, and the 'tree stones' or stelae surrounding the valley.</p>
<h3 align=left>The Main Park</h3>
<p align=left>The park has different areas of interest: </p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=50%><ol>
<li><p align=left>The Ball Court, the most artistic in Mesoamerica, with unique side wall markers resembling macaw heads. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>The Great Plaza famous for its stelae and zoomorphic altars scattered around it. The Hieroglyphic Stairway 
holds the longest known text left by the Maya civilization. It was erected by ruler number 15, known as 
Smoke-Shell, and is believed to be a lineage tree recording the ascension and death of all Copan kings from 
Ya-Kuk-Mo to Smoke-Shell himself. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>The Acropolis is divided into the east and west court plazas and features the most monumental temples in 
Copan. </p>

<p>The urban splendor of Copan was declared by UNESCO as a Cultural Patrimony of Humanity in 1 979. Copan has great plazas, enormous monuments, and 
astronomical observatories. Its temples, though in ruins, are fantastic, key milestones in Honduras' history. Access to this religious and ceremonial center&#151;a stone 
showcase of the best, definitive era in the Mayan world&#151;is easy by way of San Pedro Sula or Tegucigalpa.</p>
<h4>The Great Plaza</h4>
<p>The Great Plaza is an enormous space that is today covered by grass. Three sides of it are surrounded by stairways and terraces. There, travelers will find quite a 
few stelae with teas reliefs as well as monolithic stone monuments. Most of them were erected by Regent Conejo 18, who ordered their construction between 731 
and 736 A D. He broke the tradition of using teas relief to decorate by adopting a more realistic, holistic style, unique to Copan. Maya tradition demanded that 
each new king destroy the monuments erected by his predecessor, a custom that is reminiscent of the Egyptian Pharaohs. The remains were used to fill in the 
foundations of the new constructions. But Conejo 18 was an exception. He conserved the buildings constructed by his father, Humo Jaguar, who preceded him as 
King of Copan. In 738 A D., the start of the slow decline of Copan, Conejo 18 was captured and beheaded by a rival monarch of a satellite city-state. </p>
<h4>The Central Patio</h4>
<p>This enormous grass-covered plaza is within the area where the Mayas played their ball games. The arena is one of the most beautiful structures, with its stairway of 
hieroglyphics, now protected from the natural elements by an enormous tarp. More than 2,500 individual hieroglyphics are on the stone stelae. It is the longest 
ideographic text found in the Mayan world. Much of the information about the dynasty during the Classical Period was obtained from it. </p>
<h4>The Western Patio</h4>
<p>This complex makes up what is considered to be the acropolis, forming part of the ingenious architecture of the city of Copan. Various artificial platforms, 
constructed at different levels, hold together the multiple buildings and structures. Behind the Temple of Inscriptions is the platform for reflection. Underneath it, in 
the western patio, there is a symbolic playing field. Some historians believe the players went there to do much more than play ball. The religious importance of these 
games ended with the sacrifice of prisoners of war and of the losers, who, while being gladiators, fell under spectator disdain or fury for their double failure. Two of 
the most notable sculptures in Copan are those of the monkey executioners&#151;they surround the reflection platform. In the western patio, on the famous Q Altar, the 
sculptures represent the 16 mandates of the Classic Period in Copan.</p>
<h4>The Eastern Patio</h4>
<p>This rectangular plaza has, in its extreme western side, the Stairway of the Jaguar, which is guarded by two fierce stone animals. Above, in the center of the stairs is 
a powerful Altar of Venus, It is an image of the sun god, Kinichi Ahau, surrounded by hieroglyphic signs of the planet Venus. In the extreme north of this patio are 
the ruins of Temple 22, constructed by Conejo 18 in 715 AD The exterior door to this temple once represented the open mouth of a serpent or stylized monster, in 
a symbolic representation of the other world. It is indicative of a place where gods and ancestors could materialize in the real world. </p>
<h3 align=left>Las Sepulturas Archaeological Site </h3>
<p align=left>&quot;Las Sepulturas&quot; archaeological site has been most important in understanding how the Mayan elite lived during the days before the collapse of Copan. </p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left>Cop&aacute;n Ruinas</h3>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=15%><img src="images/ho_co3.jpeg" align=bottom width=206 height=111></td><td width=50%>This beautiful village with cobbled streets and white adobe buildings is near the famous Maya ruins and boasts a lovely colonial 
church. The archaeological site at the ruins is open daily and includes the Stelae of the Great Plaza, portraying the rulers of 
Cop&aacute;n, dating from 613; the ball court and hieroglyphic stairway; and the Acropolis, which has superb carved reliefs of the 16 
kings of Cop&aacute;n. There are hot springs a one-hour's drive from the village. church. </td></tr>

<h2 align=left>&#160;<a name="coun">The Country</a></h2>
<p align=left>Located in the heart of Central America, El Salvador is the smallest and the most densely populated of these countries. A land of agriculture, the rich volcanic soil 
on the slopes of over 25 dormant volcanoes attracted the largest farms and, through time, the major population centers in the country established on these slopes. 
The lowlands and middle highlands are planted with coffee, which is the main crop, supplemented by cereal grains, cotton and sugar cane. El Salvador is also the 
world's primary source of balsam which is used for perfumes and medicine. </p>
<h3 align=left>History</h3>
<p align=left>El Salvador is an important part of the ancient Mayan world: impressive step pyramid ruins at Tazumal and San Andres testify to the once large and sophisticated 
Mayan civilization. When the Spaniards arrived in the 16th century, Indian warriors put up a fierce fight but by 1540 the country was under Spain's control. 
Independence from Spain came 300 years later when El Salvador adopted a constitution and became a sovereign independent nation in the 1840's. Because the 
wealth of El Salvador has, historically, been in the hands of a few, there have been numerous feuds and bloody revolutions in the past. The original &quot;14 families&quot; 
who formed a landholding oligarchy have, in this century, expanded to about 250 families. Their wealth comes not only from the land but also manufacturing and 
business. While there is a small emerging middle class. the wealth of the country is primarily in the hands of a mere 2%, with the remaining population classified as in 
a state of &quot;extreme poverty&quot;. This, along with the effects of the recent civil war, has led to steady migration of people to other countries.</p>
<h3 align=left>Climate</h3>
<p align=left>There are three climates zones which vary according to the altitude above sea level, which are: Warm land or hot tropical savannas, from 0 to 600 mts.;temperat 
lands from 600 to 1200 mts.; and cold lands or height tropical climate, from 1200 to 2700 mts. There are two seasons and two transitions periods during the year:a 
dry season from November to April and rainy season from May to October,and approximately a 30 day transition in between. </p>
<hr>
<h2 align=left><a name="arc">Archeology</a></h2>
<p align=left>Precolumbian culture in El Salvador has left many archeeological sites, the most important being: Tazumal, the pyramids of Campana San Andres, the ball of 
Cihuatan, the Ruins of Quelepa and Cara Sucia, and Joya de Ceren, a well preserved Maya site with dwellings buried under 20 feet of volcanic ash clutter 
Together with Guatemala, Honduras, M&eacute;xico and Belice, El Salvador is part of the &quot;Mayan World Route&quot;, a tourist itinerary that takes the visitor to the most 
important vestiges of Meso-american history. </p>
<h3 align=left>JOYA DE CEREN</h3>
<p align=left>Only 30 minutes from San Salvador, is one of the most important Mayan vestiges of the region. A 1400 years town, conserved almost intact by several meters of 
volcanic ashes that in year 600 DC. buried it hermetically. It was discovered by chance about 20 years ago. In it were found domestic instrument, grain-vats, etc.</p>
<h3 align=left>SAN ANDR&Eacute;S PIRAMID </h3>
<p align=left>An exquisite group of ceremonial centers, courts and piramids built between the years 300 A.C. and 600 D.C. where Mayan high dignitaries lived. It has a court 
named &quot;Tlatchtti&quot;, where the indians played a primitive basketball or football, both a pastime and a religious rite. </p>
<h3 align=left>TAZUMAL PIRAMID </h3>
<p align=left>65 kms from San Salvador, it shows 14 different phases of construction, from before Christ to the year 900 . </p>

<hr>
<h2 align=left><a name="gen">GENERAL INFORMATION</a></h2>
<p align=left>Nicaragua is the largest of the Central American countries and contains Lake Nicaragua, the largest of the Central American lakes and the 10th largest freshwater 
lake in the world and is prt of the Ring of Fire, with over forty volcanoes - many active. The volcanic soil makes fertile farmland, and fields of maize, sugarcane, 
beans, cotton and, in the higher areas, coffee, dot the landscape. The population is increasingly urban, however, and over 60% of Nicaraguans live in Managua, on 
the shores of Lake Managua. The population is less dense to the north, and virtually non-existant in the tropical rainforest that covers the eastern 50 percent of the 
country. The Atlantic region, known as the Mosquito Coast, is accessible only by boat or plane. Nicaragua has seen extraordinary shifts in the size of its population 
over the past couple of decades. It is estimated that around 20 % of the population fled<br>
during the civil war, many returning in the relative stability of the early 90s</p>
<h3 align=left>History</h3>
<p align=left>Turbulet is the best way to describe Nicaragua's recent history. The name conjures up images of the bitter revolution fought between the Sandinistas and the 
Somoza regime in the late 70s, and the U.S. backed Contra war against the victorious Sandinista government that followed in the early 80's. Tourism will probably 
help bring some prosperity and stability to this country where man's early presence is evident in 10,000 year old footprints - the Footprints of Acahualinca, 
preserved in volcanic ash. </p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="man">Managua</a></h3>
<p align=left>The capital of Nicaragua is spread across the southern shore of Lago de Managua and is crowded with more than a quarter of Nicaragua's population. Racked by 
natural disasters including two earthquakes this century, much of what was formerly the city center is still vacant land; in some parts, people have constructed 
houses out of tin and cardboard boxes on the bare dirt. Near Managua is the Volc&aacute;n Masaya National Park, with volcanoes still steaming and belching, surrounded 
by smaller volcanoes and thermal springs. Legends say that the Indians used to throw young women into the boiling lava to appease Chaciutique, the goddess of 
fire. </p>
<h3 align=left><a name="gra">Granada</a></h3>
<p align=left>Colonial Granada, founded in 1524, it is one of the oldest cities on the continent. Its strategic position on the shores of Lake Nicaragua made it an important trading 
post, and the fertile farming land surrounding it, ensured the city's continued prosperity throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Several areas of Spanish 
colonial buildings are being restored, thanks to international funding; their adobe walls repaired and repainted in the original reds, ochres, yellows and blues and 
broken tiles replaced in the shady, internal courtyards. Horse drawn carts are used instead of taxis and an archipelago of more than 350 small islands is just 15 
minutes from the city by boat. Boats can be hired from many of the restaurants or from the dock </p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="lake">Lake Nicaragua</a></h3>
<p align=left>Home to the world's only freshwater sharks, Lake Nicaragua offers boat excursions to its many islands. There are over 400 islands, 300 of which are known 
collectively as Las Isletas, and are clustered together just offshore from Granada. A second archipelago, Solentiname, lies at the southern end of the lake. </p>
<h4 align=left>Ometepe Island</h4>
<p align=left>According to Indian legend, the Chorotega and Nahua tribes migrated south from Mexico in search of a place prophets had described as an island with two 
mountains rising from a freshwater sea. Ometepe, with its twin volcanoes, fitted the description and petroglyphs, sculptures and tombs show that the tribes settled 
here. The Island can be explored by bus, on horseback or on foot. </p>
<hr>
<h2 align=left><a name="adv">Adventure areas</a></h2>
<h3 align=left>R&iacute;o San Juan</h3>
<p align=left>The San Juan River which is part of a natural border between Nicaragua and Costa Rica has been the site of many explorations throughout the centuries by teams 
of surveyors hoping to use it as a possible link between the Caribbean and Pacific instead of Panama. For much of its 180 km course, the San Juan passes through 
dense jungle, making it a popular destination for nature lovers wanting to see tropical exuberance in comfort. </p>
<h3 align=left>The Atlantic Coast</h3>
<p align=left>The large region of the Atlantic Coast covers more than 50% of the whole territory. Very few people live in this vast lowland jungle where rivers are the main form 
of transport. Most inhabitants are groups of Miskitos, Sumus and Ramas Indians. The area, known as the Mosquitia region was not colonized by the Spanish, but 
at the request of its inhabitants, protected against the Spanish by the British. As a British protectorate and with the colonial contacts with the British Caribbean 
islands, many people speak a mixture of English and their own native languages.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="bea">Beaches</a></h3>
<p align=left>San Juan del Sur is a watersport paradise. Giant sea bass, red snapper, moray and marlin abound in its shallow bay waters, making sport-fishing popular, and the 
clear waters are excellent for diving. Montelimar is a popular destination near Managua. The wide stretch of beach is fringed with palm trees. There is a pretentious 
beach resort here, built around a luxurious colonial home once owned by the Somoza family. The Islas del Ma&iacute;z lie 70 km off the Caribbean coast are two tiny 
islands, one of which has very basic tourist facilities. The big attractions are the clear, blue sea, coral reefs, white sand and absolute peace. </p>

<hr>
<p align=left>These are a few common sense advice from the pros on how to enjoy and get the most out of your trip to Costa Rica, along with some suggestions that will make 
you feel more at ease while there.</p>
<h3 align=left><a name="cos_exp">What to expect</a></h3>
<p align=left>Your probably have many expectations on how your trip will be. You may have read books and magazines, watched TV documentaries and movies: Please 
remember that these documentaries were taken over a long period of time, waiting for the &quot;just right&quot; conditions (sometimes it has taken years to be finished). You 
may also expect Costa Rica to be more like your country than it really is. Please do not compare Costa Rica with the USA, there are economical, social and 
political characteristics which are intimately related to a completely different culture and heritage. Also there are different per-capita income, minimum wages, 
political parties and many social structures so the two countries are structurally not the same and a comparison would not be possible. The best result of travel is the 
cultural exchange which we experience, let&#146;s not ruin it by trying to impose our ways to a different culture, we are hosts of the country after all. Like to every other 
destination, we strongly suggest that you live all your expectations at home and accept Costa Rica for what it is, rather that what you expect it to be: if this is your 
attitude from the start, we are sure Costa Rica will even exceed you expectations.</p>
<h3 align=left><a name="adapt">How You Need To Adapt</a></h3>
<p align=left>A major part of the fun and experience of traveling to new and different regions of the world, is to try and adapt to each country and its different environment (food, 
hotels, transportation, entry regulations, climate, hours of business etc.). We understand it is not always easy, especially at first, to adapt. But look at it as a positive 
as well as interesting and exciting experience. By calmly looking around, you will be able to notice that not only the animal and plants, but also the very people of 
Costa Rica, have adapted to their own environments. If you slow down and learn to live like them, while in their country, your visit will be very rewarding. First of 
all, you cannot fight the system by saying that things &quot;should not be done this way&quot;! If you try to fight the system, you may as well pack up and go home! You 
should, instead, try to understand (even if not accepting it) to make the most of your stay and enjoy it fully. While on one of our packages, we will strive to make 
things run for you more efficiently than they usually do here, but we cannot make everything &quot;as you are used to&quot;. Actually you may lose an important part of the 
experience of being in Costa Rica if we were to be able to run everything at &quot;industrialized world standards&quot;. Slow down, relax, it is YOUR vacation. Part of the 
fun of traveling is to try and communicated with the local people. Whatever Spanish you know you should use, and smile while using it. Smiling is a MAJOR mean 
of communication everywhere in the world, make the most of it.</p>
<h3 align=left><a name="country">In The Country</a></h3>
<p align=left>Costa Rica has many remote wilderness areas and you will be probably visiting some of them during your visit. These are only a few words of advice to make your 
vacation problem-less: </p>
<ol>
<li><p align=left>The sun rays in Costa Rica are much stronger than in the USA due to its position of only 10* north of the Equator. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>Many locations are mountainous of comparatively high altitude which means the sun will even be stronger - </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>You may actually not feel you are burning till it is too late. Sunburns can be very strong to the point of making you change your plans, so prepare for it. Use 
sun block, possibly of 15 protection (or more depending on your skin), especially if you are not usually in the sun at home, wear a wide-brimmed hat and 
long sleeves and long pants. Sunglasses are also highly recommended. - </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>Very few tourists ever get bitten by a snake, but they do exist in all areas you will be traveling to and a few precautions are advisable and will make your 
vacation safe. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>One precaution is usually more than enough to give complete protection: <strong>WATCH WHERE YOU WALK</strong>! Do not step over the blind side of a log or rock 
obstructing the hiking trail, stop on top of it and look before stepping down! Snakes camouflage perfectly in their environment but they coil before 
attacking.If you feel there is something round on the forest floor <strong>STOP and STEP BACK</strong>. It usually is enough to produce enough noise and use a walking 
stick to ensure that snakes will go away from your path. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>Falling down is actually quite common as the forest floor may be quite slippery and you may not war the best shoes for hiking in this environment. Falls 
usually happen when you are trying to avoid a puddle and you do not pay enough attention to the trail itself. In tropical rain and cloud forest you will sooner 
or later get your feet wet: to avoid a fall we recommend walking through the first puddle you see. Generally speaking the interesting portions of a tropical 
forest are up in he trees, while what is dangerous is usually on the ground! For your safety just remember these guidelines: If you are looking up, DO NOT 
MOVE; When you are moving, LOOK DOWN; Do not spend extended periods of time under coconut trees. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 align=left><a name="saf">General Safety </a></h3>
<p align=left>Even though you are much safer in San Jos&eacute; than in most other cities in the world, tourists generally make better victims for theft that local city would as they are 
more distracted. Do not spend all your time worrying about it as chances are you will not encounter any crime whatsoever. If you are paranoid about it you may as 
well stay home (and that may also be more dangerous). Just pay attention to what you are doing, watch out when you are entering or leaving a bus or taxi (an 
especially vulnerable time), avoid flashy jewelry (why would you want to wear it in the forest anyway?), wear day pack chest side rather than on your back, hold 
firmly on your purse and wear it on the side opposite the open road, do not flash large amounts of money around and DO NOT keep a wallet in your back pocket. 
If you are renting a car DO NOT leave any valuables in it and definitely do not leave bags or luggage exposed to view. With these simple precautions you will feel 
free to wander around San Jos&eacute;, it is quite safe and if you find yourself wandering into an area that seems shady or does not make you comfortable, just wander 
back.</p>

<h3 align=left><a name="tro_cli"><font size=4>Preparing For A Tropical Climate</font></a></h3>
<p align=left>Dressing for the tropics can mean preparing for sun, wind, rain or even cold conditions, depending on the season and the location. Most visitors stay in the warmer 
lowlands along the coast where temperatures rarely fall below a comfortable 70&#176; F, but some of the shorter daytime adventures require climbing above the tropical 
warmth and into cooler environments. <br>
Our average visit is 7 days and includes both coastal and mountain retreats visiting places as Arenal, Monteverde, or Tango Mar and Lapa Rios offering a variety 
of climates. Poas&#146;s crater rim can fall to near freezing just before sunrise and take several hours to regain a more comfortable temperature level. Both coasts are 
warm all year. The two main factors which affect the local weather patterns are rain and wind. They are seasonal, well defined and can be planned for. The secret 
to a successful as well as pleasurable trip is knowing what to expect on the itinerary especially if side adventures are going into the higher elevation.</p>
<p align=left>The sun&#146;s rays are very strong because of Costa Rica&#146;s location near the equator. Within a very few hours in the midday sun, visible burns can begin to appear on 
fair skinned sun worshippers: carry both sun block and a sun screen with a PABA rating of at least 15. We suggest loose fitting garments made from natural fibers 
for the highest level of optimum comfort. Wear long garments in the midday sun which cover legs and arms. Don&#146;t forget to cover ankles which can burn severely. 
Beware of hiking in the tropics without taking precautions: heat exhaustion is a serious effect of a hiker&#146;s failure to prepare for the tropics and can cause serious side 
effects to even the most healthy physiques. Insects are not a serious consideration in the country, but a good repellent is recommended if your trip requires walks in 
mangrove estuaries or dense forests. </p>
<h3 align=left>Quick Hints For Quality Touring </h3>
<ul>
<li><p align=left>Take pre-worn, comfortable shoes that lace tightly if hikes are planned. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>Pack several waterproof garbage bags to protect valuables in case of unexpected rain. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>Take large bandannas for hot weather especially if walks are planned in the midday heat. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>Use a water resistant sun screen if you perspire or want to get wet. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>Consider a small bag to pack small items on day trips. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>Prepare for high humidity conditions if you plan to take along a video recorder. Ask the dealer nearest you for recommendations. Bring along a wide 
brimmed hat for sun protection and eye comfort. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>Do not take blue jeans; they are hot, heavy when wet and take longer to dry than light cotton pants .... unless you plan to horseback ride. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>Drink plenty of fluids and do not overeat. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 align=left><a name="food">Food And Water</a></h3>
<p align=left>Travelers are often apprehensive about food and water when planning a trip abroad. Costa Rica is different from most destinations in that it has acquired a basic 
understanding of the need to protect its inhabitants and visitors from contaminated food and water sources. <br>
You can safely eat the food in almost every corner of the country and in all of the facilities that cater to tourists, food is grown and prepared using most of the same 
standards accepted in North America and European communities (the possible exceptions would be streetside vendors and small questionable roadside stands 
which may have the appearance of not using all of the precautionary measures necessary to preserve a standard level of hygiene). Do not miss the local dishes and 
fresh fruits because you feel they might create a problem. Try everything within reason and use limitations on experimental dishes. Overeating becomes a mad 
compulsion when the first time visitor digs into a plate of Gallo Pinto or Guanabana ice cream. Also, most foods are not highly seasoned and hot peppers are not a 
common fare. Water here is an important part of life, it is potable nearly everywhere, with a few exceptions. Water from a tap in homes or hotels is safe in 99% of 
the facilities with only a few exceptions in very remote regions. Never drink directly from an open water source like a stream or lake no matter who tells you it is 
okay; it is not under the most pristine conditions. If you could follow a general rule it would probably be to use general common sense and if this failed ask the 
guide.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="arr_cos"><font size=5>Arrive in San Jose</font></a></h3>
<p align=left>You will always arrive at Juan Santamaria International airport in San Jos&eacute;. After Immigration collect your luggage and proceed through Customs. Right after 
customs there are steps and an escalator to the exit. Please make sure that you have all your bags before exiting the airport! </p>
<p align=left>For itineraries including transfers, local personnel will be waiting outside the airport (nobody is allowed inside for safety reasons). As you exit there will be hundreds 
of people waiting for arriving passengers. Please take a moment to look around, our transfer personnel will have a board with your name and the destination hotel 
written on. Please give them a few minutes if you do not see them directly, they may be helping some other arriving passengers. </p>
<p align=left>If you are picking up a rental car, please proceed to the exit. Here a local car rental personnel will be waiting with a sign bearing your name with the papers 
necessary to pick up your car Is&#151; give this person your voucher, a current major credit card which will be charged for any extras and for the CDW daily insurance 
which is not included in your car cost and compulsory in Costa Rica (the credit card must have a credit balance of at least $ 750) PLEASE LOOK AT THE C.R. 
MAP WHILE YOU ARE PICKING UP THE CAR AND ASK THE ATTENDANT FOR ANY INFORMATION IN HOW TO GET TO YOUR 
DESTINATION!!!!! Vantage is not responsible if you get lost while driving in Costa Rica.</p>
<p align=left>For itineraries not including transfers but only some services, local taxis are available to take you to the destination of your choice directly at the exit of the airport. 
We recommend contracting rates before taking any taxi. If you want to take local bus transportation please check with the local bus services directly for directions 
and timetables. </p>
<p align=left>If your itinerary includes TravelAir flights within Costa Rica please note:</p>
<ol>
<li><p align=left>Check-in: Check in is 45 minutes before departure of the flight. If the passenger does not check-in at the airport 30 minutes before flight, the reservation will 
be considered canceled and space reallocated without any refund to the passenger </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>Airport: TravelAir uses Pavas airport, all taxis (unless you have scheduled a private transfers, know where this airport is. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>Luggage: The maximum baggage allowance is 25 pounds per person. Excess baggage will be charged depending on destination and is subject to space 
and/or weight capacity. Oversize baggage (i.e. surfboards) will be charged $ 15 each way </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 align=left>Documents/Vouchers/Services</h3>
<p align=left>At the airport upon arrival or at the hotel if you do not use our transfers, you will need to give the vouchers supplied by us to our local correspondent office&#146;s 
personnel. They will give you the proper vouchers you will need for all services included and supply you with the final itinerary which will include the updated 
information on timetables, flights etc. that you will need to have for your tour. SERVICES IN COSTA RICA ARE SUPPLIED BY ALL TOP HOTELS AND 
SUPPLIERS. For your information their local telephone numbers are listed in the final information sent out before departure time with all documents as well as the 
contact and numbers of OUR REPRESENTATIVES FOR ALL INBOUND TRAFFIC TO THE COUNTRY </p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="dep_cos">Departure from Costa Rica</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><p align=left>Do not forget to <font size=4><strong>reconfirm your return flights</strong></font> with the carrier after arrival in Costa Rica. This is solely your responsibility. If you have not 
reconfirmed your flights with the carrier at least 72 hours before departure, your reservation may be automatically canceled by the airline and your seat 
allocated to another passenger. You may have to buy a new ticket at a much higher class of service. NO refunds will be possible. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>Check in is <strong>AT LEAST</strong> 2 hours before departure of the flight. If you arrive later the airline may assume you are not traveling and re-assign that space. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>A departure tax will be payable after check-in and before entering the departure lounge. It can be paid in either colones or US Dollars. The amount is 
around $ 6.00 and is subject to changes. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>In view of the above we always recommend spending the last night in San Jose. If you still want to fly in from another location the same day of your 
international flight <strong>WE CANNOT</strong> have any responsibility for delays causing you to miss your homebound flight, after all you are in a tropical country and 
delays and changes are the norm of the day. </p>

<hr>
<p align=left>Cars do not usually yield for other cars (or for pedestrians) and Ticos behind a wheel automatically become the very next &quot;Race Driver of Repute&quot;! Be careful and 
do not drive a rental car unless you are comfortable with the idea. Roads are also not well marked (Ticos themselves get lost all the time) and can have devastating 
pot-holes. Also remember that rental cars have special plates and this may indicate to thieves that valuables may be in the car, even a suitcase full of clothes may be 
a prized possession in Costa Rica. A rented car gives you the most flexibility possible, allowing you to visit to your heart&#146;s content all the locations you really want, 
and at your own pace. </p>
<p align=left><strong>BUT DRIVING IN COSTA RICA IS NOT THE SAME AS IN YOUR COUNTRY! IF YOU PLAN TO DRIVE IN COSTA RICA</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p align=left>There are very few road signs, and the few are sometimes confusing. At all times you will need to be VERY careful of where you are in relation to where you 
are going in order not to waste too much time back tracking </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>A good road map is quite essential, the ones provided by the rental company are enough for general driving but cannot include all the small locations you will 
need to reach. One of the better road maps is produced by International Travel Maps Productions in Vancouver (P.O.Box 2290 - Vancouver B.C., 
V6B3W5 Canada). You can find in San Jos&eacute;, buy it from the open market stall in front of the Colon Theater (in front of the Grand Hotel Costa Rica). They 
cost about $ 10 each </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><strong>EXPECT TO GET LOST.</strong> All Ticos get lost in their own country, even the professional taxi and tour van drivers do! It is practically impossible not to. So 
just take it calmly. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>It is quite necessary to speak some Spanish if you want to get to where you are going without getting too lost. Most of the Ticos you will meet outside the 
city do not speak English, but they will be VERY helpful. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>ASK DIRECTIONS as soon as you arrive at the rental booth, at the hotel concierge etc. ask about the best way to reach your destination, some of the 
hotels are small, beautiful and secluded thus a little more difficult to find. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>When you chose to drive your own rented car, you decided to be more flexible, adventurous and un-regimented. A rented car gives you that complete 
freedom of traveling at your own wish, but YOU ALONE ARE FULLY RESPONSIBLE for getting to the right place on the right day if you are holding 
hotel reservation! </p>
</li>

<h3 align=left>IMPORTANT CAR INSURANCE INFORMATION</h3>
<p align=left>In Costa Rica there is only one insurance company and the State itself is the owner of this Company. General Insurance is included and provides protection as

<li><p align=left><strong>A</strong>. Responsibility for injury or person death. It pays for the damage caused from death or bodily injury to a person or to a group in an accident. The 
insurance will accept the claim just if the driver is considered responsible of the accident according to a legal court. It protects to a maximum of 20,000,000 
colones </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><strong>B</strong>.	The Liability Insurance provides protection for third party automobile liability claims to property damage and protects to a maximum of 50,000,000 
colones </p>
</li>
</dir>
<p align=left>In your car rental rate, <strong>CDW IS NOT INCLUDED </strong>and needs to be paid directly on location (it varies from $ 12 to $ 17 per day depending on the size of the 
vehicle). Such insurance is compulsory and has to be bought regardless if your credit card offers collision protection or not. This payment covers all damages 
caused by an accident to the rented car BUT still has a deductible of $ 750.00 which you are responsible for. The rental company will gladly accept your credit 
card both as a guarantee for the vehicle consigned to you and as a payment for these extras.</p>

<hr>
<p>There&#146;s magic in their names... just say them out loud, and you&#146;ll compose a lyrical poem: ochere-breasted aqntpitta, bright-rumped attila, speckledmourner, 
bananaquit, scarlet-thighed dacnis, masked tityra, oleaginus pipromorpha, fiery-billed aracari, olivaceus piculet, white-breasted softwing... Costa Rica is what bird 
watchers dream of. Few places in the world can boast of so many different birds in such a small area: 820 species of birds &#151; more than all of the United States 
and Canada combined &#151; have been reported in Costa Rica, a country the size of West Virginia. Bird watchers are delighted when they hear that there are 75 bird 
families represented here that include 51 species of hummingbirds, 48 warblers, and 45 tonagers. Not only is Costa Rica&#146;s avifauna diverse, but also well protected 
by a world-renowned national park system and well studied by a long series of investigators. Living between two great continents each with its peculiar avifauna, 
Costa Rica is a land bridge where the faunas of the two continents meet and intermingle. Largely due to its geographical position and diversity of its habitats, Costa 
Rica&#146;s avifauna is exceptionally large. In order to get a good sampling of the birds of Costa Rica, you should plan a visit to each of its four major avifaunal zones. 
Each zone has its own distinctive avifauna as well as vegetation and climate. Following is a description, albeit brief, of each of these four zones.</p>
<h3>1- Northern Pacific Lowlands</h3>
<p>Lying in the rain shadow of the central mountains, this region in northwestern Costa Rica, principally the Guanacaste province, is covered mainly by tropical dry 
(and moist) forests. Being the southernmost segment of the Central American dry forest avifauna, the zone consists primarily of birds of northern origin rather than 
southern. Two outstanding bird watching sites occur in the zone: Santa Rosa National Park and the Palo Verde National Park and Dr. Rafael Lucas Rodriguez 
Caballero Wildlife Refuge. Santa Rosa, located in the extreme northwestern part of the country, protects one of the few dry tropical forests remaining in Central 
America. Among its ten different habitat types are wooded savannahs, mangrove swamps and gallery forests. Birds are particularly easy to see in the dry season 
months (from December to April), when they are clustered near waterholes and in shady parts of the forest. Some of the more interesting of the park&#146;s 260 birds 
are the magpie jay, long-tailed manakin, turquoise-browed motmot, and the blackheaded trogon. </p>
<p>The other area, Palo Verde and the adjacent wildlife refuge, becomes the winter home for up to 75,000 migratory birds who arrive yearly between December and 
March. Located in the Tempisque river basin, the zone contains an extensive system of seasonal swamps and lagoons that support the richest freshwater avifauna in 
Central America. About 260 bird species have been reported from the area. Among the migratory birds are the roseate spoonbill, blue wing teal and northern 
shoveler. One particular bird of interest is the jabiru, a stork whose population in the country has been reduced to 30-35 individuals.</p>
<h3>2. Chiriqui Highlands </h3>
<p>Another distinct zone is the highlands, which form the backbone of Costa Rica and contain the cloud forests. Here the avifauna contains a rich representation of 
Southern or Andean types. The level of endemism is amazingly high. Some 50 species and 75 subspecies, well over half of the zone&#146;s avifauna, are endemic to 
these highlands. Situated high in the mountains of the Central Cordillera, Monteverde Cloud Preserve, administered by the Tropical Science Center, is the choice 
site in this zone. Of its 235 species, which include the wrenthrush, three-wattled bellbird, fiery-throated hummingbird and the emerald toucanet, the resplendent 
quetzal is doubtless the most famous. The best time to see them is March and April, when they are breeding.</p>
<h3>3. Caribbean Lowlands </h3>
<p>The entire eastern half of the country is composed of lowlands where rainfall is high and uniformly distributed throughout the year. Most of the birds here are also 
found in South America, with such Neotropical groups as the antbirds, jacamars, toucans and tanagers well represented. Perhaps the best birding site in the zone is 
&#147;La Selva&#148; Biological Station, owned and operated by the Organization for Tropical Studies and located where the Atlantic lowlands meet the foothills of the 
Central Cordillera. The species diversity is incredible (385 species!) and you&#146;ll encounter the great tinamou, northern jacana, aztec parakeet, pale billed 
woodpecker, great curassow, rufous-tailed jacamar and the chestnut mandible toucan. </p>
<h3>4. Southern Pacific Lowlands </h3>
<p>The avifauna here is much the same as the Caribbean. Although there are numerous forms endemic to this zone, it has fewer resident land birds than the Caribbean. 
Corcovado National Park is the best side to view birds in this zone. With eight habitats, Corcovado, located in the extreme southwest on the Osa Peninsula, is one 
of the country&#146;s most diverse parks. Within this classic jungle are 360 species which include the scarlet macaw, fiery-billed aracari, slaty-tailed trogon and 
blue-crowned motmot. </p>

<h3 align=left>The Caribbean</h3>
<p align=left>The Central Valley is tied to the Caribbean coast through memory and migration. The nucleuses of today&#146;s dominant cultural circles had their roots planted in the 
Caribbean and were attracted to the lush valley to escape heat, precipitation and the Anopheles mosquito. This eastern coast is a part of the Caribbean rim land 
with strong cultural and physical ties to this tropical sea. This a mosaic of black, yellow, tan and white skinned people who have forged frail farmsteads and 
livelihoods between the sea and the region&#146;s largest remaining stand of lowland tropical rain forest. Historically, this eastern half of the Central Highland&#146;s Atlantic 
watershed has had inhabitants since 8,000 B.C. but its present political development did not begin until four decades after Columbus&#146;s visit. Less than half the size 
of the Pacific shoreline, the Caribbean coast extends from Nicaragua on the north to Panama on the south for more than 200 km. It&#146;s divided into two regions, 
culturally however, they are contained within a single &quot;provincia&quot;, Lim&oacute;n. The northern extension is referred to as Tortuguero and the south, the Talamanca coast. 
Both names are derived from the same source, the seasonal slaughter of sea turtles that frequented the region during the nesting cycle. Coastal residents would 
intercept them on their courting and nesting routes using the turtles for protein supplement and the shells of some species for ornaments. The slaughters have 
stopped except for a special, controlled season which allows lucky fishermen picked in a lottery, to ply their ancestor&#146;s trade in sea turtles.</p>
<p align=left>Talamanca stems from a Miskito Indian word, Talamalka, which translates into place of blood, directed at the aftermath of past turtle hunts. This is in complete 
contrast to today&#146;s coastal atmosphere of tropical warmth. Most of the area remains remote, an untouched paradise of bleached white beaches, tropical coconut 
palms, slow lapping waves and a sea that looks like glass accenting the abrupt wall of the rain forest that grows against the roads and trails in the region. A region 
dotted with nearly half a dozen parks and protected reserves which remain the least explored in the entire system. They will one day open up to attract birders and 
horticulturists from around the world but until that day, only those liking a &quot;rustic&quot; environment appreciate them. Lim&oacute;n, the country&#146;s bustling port city is also the 
commercial hub for the residents along the coast. This was the birthplace of Costa Rica&#146;s narrow gauge railway and the land of Pan Bon, the good bread, coconut 
cookies and spicy dishes that reflect the Caribbean cultures that call the port home. To the north of Lim&oacute;n is the largest stretch of undeveloped coastline on the 
Caribbean; it is called Tortuguero, land of the turtles. There are few roads that cut through this giant rain forest so most traffic is on board boats. Sports fishing for 
snook and tarpon have made this northern half of the coast popular. </p>
<h4 align=left><a name="hito">HITOY-CERERE PARK</a></h4>
<p align=left>Along the northeast quadrant of La Amistad lies Hitoy-Cerere Biological Reserve atop the Caribbean slopes of the Talamanca mountains. Lower, denser, and as 
remote as Amistad, Hitoy&#146;s secrets lie undisturbed within its mysterious interior niches. Twenty feet of precipitation falls on the reserve almost 365 days a year. This 
moisture envelops complex ecosystems below the upper canopy which rises over 150 feet into the sky. Here hikers can find a wonderland of white water rivers 
that cut across the landscape, heading east. Within its enclosed biosphere lianas, vines and trees are covered with a rich, vibrant coat of lichen, mosses and fungi 
like thinly napped carpet draped around a pole- Two hundred and eleven species of orchids are found in the reserve and knowledgeable estimates speculate that at 
least another dozen or more may be awaiting classification. Hitoy remains one of the last strongholds of the margay, here the limber but smaller cousin of the 
common cat, the ocelot which finds seclusion among the dense foliage of the upper canopies. Other popular but endangered mammals found frequently in Hitoy 
are; the Wolly and Gray four-eyed opossum, Baird&#146;s tapir, Collared peccary, Howler, white-faced and Capuchin monkeys. Two of the birds most sought after by 
naturalists are the Blue-headed parrot and the Cayenne squirrel cuckoo.</p>
<h4 align=left><a name="cah">CAHUITA PARK</a></h4>
<p align=left>Still further east along the Caribbean coastline sits yet another park, Cahuita, from two Miskito Indian words &quot;cawi&quot; which is a small red wooded tree and &quot;ta&quot;, 
which implies pointed land. Literal translation is mahogany point. This is a park with dual attractions divided by a coast some writers call the only tropical beach on 
the Caribbean. Shimmering crystalline beaches and waving coconut palms separate the marine environment from the lush rain forest, visitors have the option to 
explore either. Coral reefs and sunken wrecks or primates and rare avifauna, both call Cahuita home. </p>
<h4 align=left><a name="gan">GANDOCA-MANZANILLO PARK</a></h4>
<p align=left>South of Cahuita hidden away along the humid coast is another parkland, the Gandoca-Manzanillo National Wildlife Reserve. Its 9400 hectares may-be the least 
known of all the Caribbean tracts which fall under park system control. Its reef system may be larger than the more popular Cahuita reef but little is known about 
the region. An important part of the marine ecology is a long oyster bed which stretches for miles and lines many of the coastal lagoons that dot the refuge and 
neighboring coast. This marine nursery may be one of the mysterious breeding grounds of the Atlantic tarpon. Many factors lead to speculation that it&#146;s possible that 
this could become an invaluable asset to the sports fishing industry here and in Panama to the South, if pending research proves its importance as a breeding 
ground. This refuge also gets large numbers of manatee which researchers say swim in from the Boca del Toro island chain to the South.</p>
<h4 align=left><a name="tort">TORTUGUERO PARK</a></h4>
<p align=left>Two other parks lie along the Caribbean but several hundred kilometers to the North of Cahuita and Gandoca-Manzanillo. The most famous of the two, 
Tortuguero National Park gained much of its popularity from its association with the sea turtles. For hundreds and possibly thousands of years indigenous and 
wandering cultures have hunted the sea turtle for food, for precious medium on which to carve, and to instill the skills of masculinity on future turtle hunters: 
Tortuguero means &quot;land of the turtle&quot;. Turtles are not the only attraction but their nesting beaches are open during the humid summer months to visitors who want to 
help tag an endangered animal. The rain forest that straddles the beaches and stretches west to the first major elevation changes is an even greater attraction. It&#146;s 
here in the quiet coastal lagoons that environments meet, mingle and begin forming separate ecosystems. Salty estuaries give way to brackish gallery forest and 
slowly into freshwater forests with rivers filled with tannins tainting even metal debris on their floor. This is sloth land: cecropias hiding around every corner along the 
trails and canals surprise first time visitors with close-up views of a mammal with a metabolism rate one half of man&#146;s. Two of the largest neotropical mammals are 
found in the park: the manatee and the Baird&#146;s Tapir. Surprisingly they can be found within a short-distance of each other when the marine giant swims up the 
brackish lagoons in search of quiet courtship waters. If sounds were assigned to parks perhaps this would be one of the regions where the distant woofing bark of 
the Howler would be most memorable. They stoke the excitement levels of adventurers who visit a neotropical rain forest for the first time and their territorial 
vocalizations at night push light sleepers into primal dreams. It&#146;s something rarely forgotten once heard and an undeniable part of the rain forest experience. This rain 
forest is at its peak during the three wettest months, January, June and July. All of the coastal waters rise and allow easy access to the interior lagoons for birdying 
and backwater tours of one of the last Caribbean rain forest. During the three driest months, February, April and November it&#146;s easier to spot fauna amidst the 
open foliage.</p>
<h4 align=left><a name="barra">BARRA DEL COLORADO PARK</a></h4>
<p align=left>Less than 40 kilometers to the North lies yet another rain forest which receives nearly thirty percent more rainfall than Tortuguero, Barra del Colorado National 
Park. They are connected by man-made coastal canals that wind through the salt and brackish waters of the estuaries and gallery forest. 92,000 hectares 
encompass an unusual combination of wildlife habitats and small communities along the San Juan River on the North with the Caribbean on the East. Barra&#146;s core is 
relatively undisturbed except for logging along two of the major river systems in the park&#146;s northwest quadrant. Within the park&#146;s buffer zone lies a town of 900 
people, mostly fishermen and three of the country&#146;s oldest and most popular sports fishing camps in the region. The navigable waterways penetrate the deepest part 
of the interior and major rivers like the San Juan lead eventually into main river routes such as the Sarapiqui, less than two hours from San Jos&eacute;. More than 240 
species of birds reside in the Barra Park and many can be seen without great effort by traveling along the canals. Most of the coastal waterways are lined with 
Raphia palms, one of the oldest on earth, bloodwood, cativo, and wild tamarind.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="lim">LIMON</a></h3>
<p>Columbus, hopelessly lost while navigating these shores, landed in Puerto Limon thinking it was Siam. The area at the time was described as &quot;lofty, full of rivers and 
abounding in tall trees&quot; so it was called &quot;the Garden&quot;. Present day visitors may be disappointed! Limon is a teeming tropical port with limited tourist facilities and 
little of interest to see. The colorful street life is about the only thing interesting to watch and, as a town, it has more sleaze than charm. Its decayed building are 
badly in need of repair, or at least a pint job, the wide streets are uniformly potholed and full of garbage which vultures feast upon greedily. On top of it the last 
earthquake really shook the town and broken pavements and toppled houses are still there to see adding to the town's gone-to-seed appearance. The town was 
originally built in a swampy area with rampant yellow fever near the site of an ancient Indian village <em>&quot;By the way the name of Limon goes back when there was, 
indeed, a lemon tree where the Town hall stands today&quot;</em>. The harbor (there are 4 docks) handles most of the sea trade for Costa Rica but the city has never 
fully recovered from the slump in the banana industry in the 1950s and moves with the lassitude of a tropical port - <em>A warning: beware of pick-pockets by day 
and muggings at night</em></p>

<h3 align=left>The Central Valley</h3>
<p align=left>The central highlands straddle the three major mountain ranges above 300 meters and reach down the country from Oros&iacute; volcano on the North to the southern tip 
of the Tilar&aacute;n mountains on the Panama border. Before the turn of the century the people of the highlands called this midsection Tierra Fria which literally means 
cool ground. Up to 1500 meters the region is pleasant, almost spring-like all year, but as one rises higher the temperatures begin dropping up to the paramo above 
3500 meters where frost is common most of the year.</p>
<p align=left>San Jos&eacute;, the national capital and seat of the government, lies in the cradle of this Tierra Fria. Ask a Costa Rican from the Central Valley about their country and 
the immediate reply is, &quot;Everything begins and ends in San Jos&eacute;&quot;, and to a great extent most of the tours emanate from this capital hub. Its regional popularity can be 
traced back more than 12,000 years with the earliest recorded campsites made by hunters and gatherers who crossed the isthmus in search of new land. </p>
<p align=left>Today&#146;s historical remnants can be sought out as evidence of Europe&#146;s colonization. Evidences of any great cultures of the former indigenous groups which 
occupied the valley have yet to be found, but most experts agree that previous people lived in smaller chiefdoms rather than large population units such as found in 
Copan or Tikal. Jade was the prized commodity until the 11th century when the art of gold metallurgy began to move into the region from the south. The one 
endeavor and staple of regional life which remained basically the same except for advanced technology is agriculture. Its importance has not changed in two 
thousand years. Periodically, two of the largest volcanoes would dump millions of tons of ash on the central valley and surrounding areas: the rich fallout of ash and 
debris have created one of the healthiest soils in the region: everything here grows quicker, higher, greener and tastier.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="gs_pk">Parks</a></h2>
<h4 align=left>PO&Aacute;S VOLCANO PARK</h4>
<p align=left>Po&aacute;s and Iraz&uacute; volcanoes have been as much a part of the region as the landscape. In fact, they are the main reason for the Central Valley&#146;s lush terrain. Poas is an 
indigenous name for a small prickly plant that has a bright yellow blossom and grows throughout the upper slopes of the two main craters. Po&aacute;s&#146; main attraction is 
its active crater which incessantly emits varying amounts of visible steam and gaseous mixtures which permeate the surrounding air. Sulfur has the expected reaction 
among onlookers. Standing at the crater&#146;s edge it is easy to understand why it is the largest geyser-type volcano in the world. Twelve hundred and forty feet below 
the rim, the craters open core looks like a placid lake, but in fact is the mouth of the volcano&#146;s heated interior. Periodically, when pressure expands beyond the 
lake&#146;s ability to hold the force, the activity disgorges molten sediment, large boulders, water in the form of steam and gaseous mixtures as high as 30,000 feet. Once 
vented, it regains its quiet state and again the rain washes down to the crater&#146;s floor to reform the lake. An elfin or dwarf cloud forest surrounds the crater&#146;s slopes 
and has several well-marked trails through the terrain that most slow walkers find mountable. Along the trails visitors will find picturesque crater lakes, rare 
squirrels, several different species of trogons, a multitude of hummingbirds and a rich pattern of epiphytic growth beyond the most vivid imagination. </p>
<h4 align=left>IRAZ&Uacute; VOLCANO PARK</h4>
<p align=left>Iraz&uacute; Volcano National Park to the south has a totally different edifice which resembles a colder, more spartan lunar landscape. Dormancy lends a more mysterious 
facade to the quiet crater. The gray landscape captures the overall visual concept of this volcano in a false reflection of a serene mountain top when in fact, its 
history is one of repeated destructive eruptions. Its name stems from two words of an indigenous language &quot;ara&quot; which means peak or mountain top and &quot;tzu&quot; which 
is thunder. Together, they best describe the volcano&#146;s reputation, thunder mountain. </p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="sjo">SAN JOSE</a></h2>
<p>San Jose, the nation's capital, squats on the floor of the Meseta Central, a fertile upland basin 1,150 meters (3,773 feet) above sea level in the heart of Costa Rica. 
The basin is a tectonic depression some 20 km wide and 70 km long, with volcanoes rising on every side, their slopes covered with dark green coffee &quot;fincas&quot;. 
Earthquakes regularly give San Jose a shaking. The last major one, in April 1991, did significant damage to the National Theater, while cracks in hotel walls are 
evident everywhere. Virtually every part of the country is accessible within a four-hour drive from San Jose. Two-thirds of the nation's urban population now lives 
in greater or metropolitan San Jose, whose population of 1.2 million represents 30% of the nation's total. Nearby towns such as Heredia have become virtual 
dormitory towns from which many people commute daily into San Jose.<br>
San Jose is not a colonial quaint town! You will immediately note the relative lack of a colonial or even a pre-20th-century legacy, just a chaos of architectural 
styles, part Spanish, part Moorish, some even adobe with ornamental grillwork abutting the sidewalk and opening onto inner patios in the colonial style. <br>
Equally lacking is any vestige of an Indian heritage, such as gives Guatemala its characteristic feel. Only west of the Plaza de la Cultura is there a bustling market 
area that presents a stereotypically Central American aspect, with gaily colored fruit and produce stalls spilling from the sidewalks onto the streets. Almost every 
street corner has its vendor carts bursting with mangos, bananas, coconuts, pineapples, and papayas. And the neighborhood corner store (pulperia) remains the 
center of social life, as it was 200 years ago. San Jose mirrors North America far more: commercial center with hotels, offices, and shops stocked with the latest 
fashions; narrow streets clogged with cars, trucks, and buses; appallingly ugly modern high-rise architecture; neon signs advertising Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
McDonald's, and Pizza Hut contending with billboards touting condoms, Mercedes, and the Moulin Rouge-style lures of Josephine&#146;s, one of the nightclub. The 
Josefinos' (as San Jose residents like to be called) passion for cars has added to the detrimental effects. Downtown San Jose's traffic scene is a choking nightmare 
of honking cars, buzzing mopeds, trucks and gaily painted buses spewing diesel fumes everywhere.<br>
Josefinos are relatively progressive and cosmopolitan. True, on weekends suburbanites flock into San Jose to stroll the Avenida Central, but the city is large enough 
to support a vital cultural milieu and vivacious nightlife. The city is also not without its share of homeless and beggars, even though there are very few of the ghoulish 
slums that scar the hillsides of so many other Latin American cities. The modest working-class neighborhoods are almost everywhere clean and well ordered. And 
the residential districts like Sabana Sur, San Pedro, and Rohrmoser, are usually calm. </p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="sjo_mus">Museums</a></h2>
<h3>National Museum</h3>
<p>A large collection of pre-Colombian art (pottery, stone, and gold) and an eclectic mix of colonial-era art, furniture, costumes, and documents highlight the Museo 
Nacional, located in the old Bellavista Fortress, on the east side of Plaza de la Democracia, at Calle 17 and Avenida Central/2. Separate exhibition halls deal with 
history, archaeology, geology, religion, and colonial life. Only a few exhibits offer translations in English. The National institute of Biodiversity also has a small but 
interesting display of insects downstairs. The towers and walls of the fortress, an old army barracks, are pitted with bullet holes from the 1948 civil war. The 
museum surrounds a beautiful landscaped courtyard featuring colonial-era cannons.. (Hours: Tues.-Sun. 9 a.-5 p.m</p>
<h3>Pre-Columbian Gold Museum</h3>
<p>Given the paucity of pre-Columbian sites in Costa Rica, the Museo del Oro Precolombiano&#151;run by the state-owned Central Bank comes is a pleasant surprise. 
There are over 2,000 glittering pre-Columbian gold artifacts (frogs, people, etc.) weighing in at over 22,000 troy ounces. A collection of old coins is also displayed 
in an adjoining room in the Museo Numismatica, while a small exhibit hall features works from the bank's art collection. The museum is adjacent to the ICT tourist 
information office in the basement beneath the Plaza de la Cultura (Calle 5 and Avenida Central/2). The entrance is at the base of the steps beside the large silver, 
funnel-shaped air vents at the east side of the plaza. Free guided tours presented by bilingual guides are offered Tues. and Thurs. at 2 p.m., and on weekends at 11 
a.m. and 2 p.m. Bring your passport or other identification for the security check upon entry. (Hours: Fri.-Sun. and holidays, 10 a.m.-5 p.m)</p>

<hr>
<p align=left>With all the hyperbole about Costa Rica's magnificent beaches, the northern lowlands and the mountains of the northern area must be feeling forgotten. During the 
colonial period the valley of San Carlos was intensely cultivated but the lower northern region was a no-man's-land marked only by murky rivers.But this first 
impression is not a fair one as the vistas can be as grandiose as any in the country and the naturalist fins splendid sites nearly untouched by tourism</p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="are">ARENAL</a>: Lake and Volcano </h3>
<p align=left>Surrounded by mountains kept perpetually emerald green by the winds from the Caribbean and dominated by the Arenal Volcano the Lake is properly a reservoir. 
Volcano Arenal is a picture perfect cone, the most active volcano in Costa Rica and a must see for the visitor. Adored by the local Indians, it become famous again 
on July 29, 1968 when it awakened from a long sleep with a giant earthquake and massive explosion which wiped out the villages of Tabacon and Pueblo Nuevo, 
whose entire population perished. Although it has not erupted with any serious force in the past 20 years, its lava flows and eruptions are constant on virtually and 
on any day you can see smoking cinderblocks tumbling down the slope from the horse-shoe shaped crater, or, at night, watch a fiery cascade of lava spewing from 
the 140 meter deep crater. It is regarded one of the world's most active volcanoes. </p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="can_neg">CA&Ntilde;O NEGRO WILDLIFE REFUGE</a> </h3>
<p align=left>One of the undiscovered gems of Costa Rica, Ca&ntilde;o Negro, 25 Kms SW of Los Chiles is a remote tropical everglades teeming with wildlife The 9,969 hectare 
preserve protects a lush lowland basin of soft, knee deep watery sloughs and marshes, <em>holillo</em> groves and tan carpets of sturdy sedge. Life here evolves around 
Lake Ca&ntilde;o Negro, a seasonal lake fed by the fresh waters of the Rio Fr&iacute;o, which snake down from the flanks of Volcano Tenorio and collect in this basin, where 
they slow almost to a standstill. </p>
<p align=left>In the wet season, when the region is flooded and great pools and lagoons form, vast numbers of migratory waterfowls flock in, turtles and crocodiles can be seen 
in abundance basking on the banks, and looking down into waters as black as Costa Rican coffee you may see the dim forms of big snook, silver gold tarpon, and 
garish garfish lurking in the shadows. </p>
<p align=left>In February the dry season sets in (generally through April), Ca&ntilde;o Negro dries out, and the area is reduced to shrunken lagoons. Caiman gnash and slosh out pools 
in the muck, and wildlife congregates in great abundance along the watercourses. Ca&ntilde;o Negro is a bird-watcher paradise with the largest colony of neotropic 
cormorants in Costa Rica and the only permanent colony of Nicaraguan grackle . And cattle egrets, wood storks, anhingas, roseate spoonbills, etc. The reserve is 
remarkable as well for its healthy population of endangered mammal species: jaguars, cougars, tapirs, ocelots and tayras. But everything has its price &#133; the 
mosquitoes are fierce!</p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="tab">TABACON</a> Hot Springs</h3>
<p align=left>At the base of the volcano. On the NW face, is Tabacon hot springs where steaming waters of the Rio Tabacon tumble down from the lava fields and cascade 
alongside the road. A dip here is supposed to be perfect for treating skin problems, arthritis and muscular pains. A new full facility &quot;spa cum restaurant&quot; has opened 
and provide great service </p>

<hr>
<h3 align=left>The Northern Pacific</h3>
<p align=left>Guanacaste's Nicoya province sits atop a dry plain, pocked with small hills and cut off from the eastern half of the nation by a mountain chain, the Tilarans. This is 
the southern tip of the Meso American Plain, an extension of the cultural influence from the great pyramid builders to the north. Trade routes with the northern 
empires of the Maya and the Olmec civilizations kept the region a focal point of cultural activity. </p>
<p align=left>Surprisingly different from the other six provinces, it remains a vestigial arm of mysterious cultures which have disappeared along with their language. The power of 
attraction in the area comes from a combination of its pre-Columbian past as well as its showcase atmosphere as a habitat for rare and endangered species found in 
protected parks like Santa Rosa. This was the first national park in the system for several reasons including its historical value as a site where local citizens fought 
off an attempt to take over the country and because of the large tract of land encompassing endangered habitats found nowhere else in the country. The coast is a 
crooked line of bays, peninsulas, cave-lined rocky ridges and sandy beaches that have attracted man and beast for thousands of years. Even the marine life is 
directed to this coast by favorable currents which wash the shoreline and carry the origins of the food chain that eventually leads to the ocean&#146;s largest game fish. 
National parks and reserves are found throughout the province and their numbers and sizes continue to grow, guaranteeing future generations the opportunity to see 
many of the species that will become the last of their kind, regionally and globally. </p>
<h4 align=left><a name="sr">SANTA ROSA PARK</a></h4>
<p align=left>Due West of Barra lies the northernmost mountain chain, the Tilar&aacute;n or Guanacaste formation where the humid influence of the Caribbean stops and a contrasting 
environment begins on the northwest corner of the country. Dry heat penetrates every aspect of life on the Guanacaste plateau where wind and a six month rainy 
season temporarily wash away the signs of draught. Santa Rosa National Park sits atop this plateau with its western boundaries stretching into the Pacific. The dry 
tropical forest which covers a large percentage of the park is one of the remaining tracts of an environment that covered much of the coast of Central America until 
only a few decades ago. One of the attractions which has brought international publicity to Costa Rica and Santa Rosa is the &quot;arribada&quot; of the Pacific Ridley sea 
turtle which takes place each year on one of the park&#146;s protected beaches. One, of only two beaches, which experiences an &quot;arribada&quot; with this species the turtle 
remains protected from outside intervention. That other beach is less than 100 kilometers to the South and it too is protected by the framework of the park&#146;s 
system. Encased in a low pressure trough during the full moon phase, the beach is stage and platform for one of nature&#146;s disappearing miracles. The exact time, the 
stimulus, the number of turtles, or the length of the event are as mysterious today as they were a thousand years ago. It is the tide, the water temperature, the wind 
or the exhausting end to a long journey when many of the offshore turtles decide to nest on Nancite on the same night? No one knows for sure; but on that night, 
more than one hundred thousand Ridleys beach themselves and begin the nesting ritual. They literally climb over each other to reach the sand to dig the cavity so 
they can lay their eggs and return to the sea. All of this on a tiny beach less than 0.9 km&#146;s long and less than 30 mts wide. Long before dawn scavengers begin to 
arrive, scurrying about digging, clawing at obvious nests and gorging themselves on Ridley eggs. Most of the night visitors are Coati Mundis and other small 
mammals. Then at first light a second wave of nest robbers arrive in the form of vultures and sea birds. As the last turtle leaves the beach for the surf at sun&#146;s first 
light, the scene changes from the last turtle treks into the surf to scattered digging by frenzied scavengers poaching nature&#146;s bounty.</p>
<h4 align=left><a name="ost">OSTIONAL NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE</a></h4>
<p align=left>The 248-hectare Ostional National Wildlife Refuge begins at Punta India and extends along 15 km of shoreline to Punta Guiones, 8 km south of Nosara. It 
incorporates the beaches of Playa Ostional, Playa Nosara, and Playa Guiones. The refuge was created to protect one of two vitally important nesting sites in Costa 
Rica for the lore, or olive Ridley turtle (the other is Playa Nancite, in Santa Rosa National Park). Ostional was named by the World Conference for the 
Conservation of Sea Turtles as one of the world's most important sea turtle hatcheries. A significant portion of the world's Pacific Ridley turtle population nests at 
Ostional, where they head for a narrow sandy strip between Punta Division and Ostional estuary, invading the beach en masse for up to one week at a time from 
July to December (peak season is August and September), and singly or in small groups at other times during the year. These waves of synchronized invasions 
arribadas can include 100,000 or more female turtles over the course of a few days. The arribada follows a strategy that assumes that only a fraction of eggs will 
hatch and the babies mature to adulthood. Thus, millions of eggs are deposited at a time. Since the beach is literally covered with thousands of turtles, the eggs laid 
during the first days of the arribada are often crushed by turtles arriving later.</p>
<h4 align=left><a name="bau">LAS BAULAS MARINE TURTLE NATIONAL PARK</a></h4>
<p align=left>The 445-hectare Las Baulas National Park formerly Tamarindo National Wildlife Refuge protects not only the prime nesting site of the Leatherback turtle on the 
Pacific coast, but also the mangrove estuary that forms the boundary of Tamarindo Beach, plus 22,000 hectares out to sea. There are turtles at Playa Grande year 
round. The nesting season for the giant Leatherback is October through April, when females come ashore every night at high tide. Often, over 100 turtles might be 
seen in a single night. PLAYA GRANDE Costa Rican beaches don't come more beautiful than this endless curve of coral-white sand with sky-blue water, but 
there are no palms or shade trees. There are a few tidepools for snorkeling and bathing, and a 400-hectare mangrove estuary at the southern end, where crocodiles 
might be spotted. Superb surf pumps ashore at high tide. Playa Grande is renowned among surfers for its consistency and good mix of lefts and rights. Playa 
Grande Park was created to stop turtle poaching. The park is undermanaged and underfunded and needs to enforce the current guidelines for visitors. There's a 
large sign, easy to miss before the beach which gives instructions for turtle-watching but many thoughtless visitors get too close to the turtles, try to touch them, ride 
their backs, or otherwise display a lack of common sense. Newborn turtles are difficult to see at night as they scurry down to the sea and many are inadvertently 
crushed by tourist feet. The Hotel Las Tortugas, by the park entrance, serves as the wildlife center for the marine park. </p>

<h3><a name="sbg">A Short Beach Guide </a></h3>
<p>The northern Guanacaste beaches are some of the most visited in the country, by tourists and Costa Ricans alike. Each beach has its own distinct character and 
varies in level of development and available facilities. The following is a rough guide working from north to south, to help you find the beach that suits you. We start 
with the best known (until recently they were the only beaches to provide some good accommodation, now you can find even better accommodation at other 
beaches - click here to go to our <a href="cos_hnp.html"><em><strong>Guanacaste Hotel Page</strong></em></a></p>
<p><strong>Flamingo</strong> - (officially and more accurately called Playa Blanca The two km-wide expanse of white sand that forms part of Potrero Bay (Bahia Flamingo) is one of 
the most magnificent beaches in Costa Rica. There are no flamingoes, however. The area has long been favored by the wealthy and expensive villas sit atop the 
headlands and line the beach. A great many private homes are under construction along the headland to the north; it's well worth the walk for the fabulous views. 
Many of these fortunate have their own little coves as private as one's innermost thoughts. Playa Flamingo has been called the &quot;Acapulco of Costa Rica&quot; but there's 
little night-life to speak of. More appropriate is its reputation as the nation's sportfishing capital. Flamingo is home to Costa Rica's largest sportfishing fleet, which 
anchors in what is supposedly the largest marina between Acapulco and Panama. </p>
<p><strong>Tamarindo - </strong> 8 km south of Huacas, is one of the most popular beach destinations for foreign travelers and gets very full in high season Although the selection isn't 
wide, Tamarindo is blessed with an array of accommodations for every budget. Advance reservations are recommended. The massive gray sand beach is very 
deep when the tide goes out, and somewhat pebbly. It's backed by tamarind trees, which give the beach its name. Tiny sand flies that pack a jumbo-sized bite are a 
problem around dusk. The estuary which separates Tamarindo from Playa Grande to the north is a nirvana for birders; the estuary is now incorporated into the 
Guanacaste Marine Turtle National Park and protects crocodile and monkeys, among other creatures. If swimming, beware of riptides. Tamarindo is popular with 
surfers. The beach has three surf breaks: a rocky right-point shore break named Henry's Point in front of the Restaurante Zully Mar, a left shore break named Pico 
Pequeno 100 meters north, and a superb rivermouth break </p>
<p align=left><strong>Potrero </strong>- Immediately north of Flamingo, Potrero is considerably less developed than its neighbor. Known for its safe swimming waters, the quiet beach makes for 
a pleasant change of pace for those looking for a little seclusion. A four-wheel drive to master the dirt road joining the two towns is recommended. </p>
<p align=left><strong>Brasilito </strong>- Just south of Flamingo, Brasilito is a place to go for those seeking to escape the tourist scene and sample a bit of local color. Small and with a funky, 
laid-back feel, Brasilito has a number of modest sodas (small cafes) and bars in which to pleasantly while away an afternoon. The beach itself is smaller and not as 
impressive or well-kept as others in the area. </p>
<p align=left><strong>Conchal </strong>- One of the most beautiful beaches in the country, Conchal is named for the fact it is formed almost entirely of shell fragments, giving it a glistening white 
appearance. A spectacular shell mountain at one end of the beach can be reached with a four-wheel drive. Playa Conchal is the site of the beach and golf resort 
hotel, Meli&aacute; Conchal, just finished </p>
<p align=left><strong>Grande</strong> - Living up to its name, this massive stretch of smooth sand beach is popular with both turtles and surfers (though not necessarily at the same time). During 
the season, (October through March), Playa Grande is the biggest nesting area in Costa Rica, and one of the biggest in Central America, for the endangered giant 
leatherback turtles. The beach is protected, and entry is forbidden after dark. Camping is not permitted at any time. Surfing season, on the other hand, is 
year-round and dedicated surfers flock from far and wide to take advantage of the great swells and breaks famed on this stretch of shore. Few buildings and a 
bumpy dirt road (about a twenty-five minute journey from the main Flamingo road) ensure the remote and reclusive atmosphere that is part of Grande&#146;s appeal.</p>
<p align=left><strong>Samara </strong>- Being added on continuously it still has one of the best closed bays on the coast and great fishing even from off-shore. It is a sleepy area well suited for 
those wanting to relax without and yet have everything nearby</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="tamb">Tambor</a></h3>
<p>&#160;Tambor is a small and funky fishing village in Bahia Ballena (&quot;Whale Bay&quot;), 18 km southwest of Paquera. There's a narrow and unappealing gray-sand beach taken 
over partially by the Playa Tambor Hotel (looking more like a concentration camp than an hotel and a project that had raised the ire of environmentalists by 
violating protective laws). and a tiny church. VVhales are sometimes sighted &#151; hence the name. 8 Kms south, at <a href="cos_tmar.html"><strong>Tango Mar</strong></a> starts one of the country's more 
beautiful sections of coast. Monkeys and other critters hang out by the shore. </p>
<h3>Paquera</h3>
<p>This quiet village, 24 km from Playa Naranjo, is centered on the junction for the Paquera ferry. The road to the left at the T-junction leads past a gas station (fill up 
here, as this is the only gas station in the whole southern region) and dead-ends at the ferry terminal. You can continue along a rough dirt track to the end of Punta 
Corralillo. The road to the right leads to Curu National Wildlife Refuge, Playa Tambor, Montezuma, and Cabo Blanco.</p>
<h4><a name="cur">CURU</a> NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE</h4>
<p>This private reserve forms part of a 1~214-hectare hacienda' two-thirds of which is preserved as primary forest. It is tucked in the fold of Golfo Curu, four km 
south of Paquera. The 84-hectare reserve includes 4.5 km of coastline with a series of tiny coves with three beautiful white-sand beaches: Curu, Colorada, and 
Quesera. Olive Ridley and hawksbill turtles nest on the crystalline beaches. Mangrove swamps extend inland along the Rio Curu, backed by forested hills. There's 
good diving close to shore, where lobsters and giant conches are abundant. Whales are often sighted offshore (January is reportedly the best month). Birds include 
motmots, white-fronted amazons, laughing hawks, and lineated woodpeckers, in addition to at least 111 other species. Mammals include agoutis, ocelots, margays, 
pumas, howler and capuchin monkeys, whitetailed deer, sloths, and anteaters. Isla Tortuga lies three km offshore.</p>
<h4><a name="cab">CABO</a> BLANCO ABSOLUTE NATURE RESERVE</h4>
<p>This jewel of nature at the very tip of the Nicoya Peninsula is where Costa Rica started preserving its natural resources with a 1,172-hectare reserve, the oldest 
protected, following the tireless efforts of Nils Olof. In 1960, when the first patch of cleared land appeared at Cabo Blanco, Olof launched an appeal published in 
the April 1961 journal of the World League Against Vivisection and For the Protection of Animals to save the land. Although several international organizations 
responded with money, buying the land and protecting the area was difficult. Conservation had not yet entered national consciousness. The first warden killed the 
last 10 spider monkeys for their fat; the third warden felled trees to grow crops. </p>
<hr>
<h4><a name="tor">TORTUGA ISLAND</a></h4>
<p>This stunningly beautiful, 320-hectare island is a popular day-trip from Puntarenas. It's a 14-km (90-minute) journey aboard any of half-a-dozen cruise boats. 
Tortuga is as close to an idyllic tropical isle as you'll find hereabouts. The main attraction is a magnificent white-sand beach lined with tall coconut palms. Each of 
the cruise companies that put day-trippers ashore gets its own section of the beach. It can get a bit cramped at weekends, when three or four boats might disgorge 
their passengers at the same time. Still, it makes for a tremendous trip on a sunny day. You can snorkel, swim, play volleyball, hike, or simply snooze in the sun. 
The boats pass by Islas San Lucas, Guayabo, and Negritos en route. Calypso Cruises with the new Manta Ray (booked on all our programs) is the only boat able 
to beach directly on the sand without using a tender. Your buffet lunch on the beach will be one of the best you'll have in Costa Rica, with fare such as mahimahi in 
shrimp sauce, salads, and tortillas. </p>

<h3 align=left>Central Pacific Parks</h3>
<p align=left>Moisture and precipitation increase as the traveler heads South. The Tarcoles river provides the natural boundary between the dry North and the humid South. This 
too is a land of mystery with sacred burial grounds, violent thunderstorms, and the oldest national park in the country, Manuel Antonio </p>
<h4 align=left><a name="car">CARARA</a> BIOLOGICAL RESERVE</h4>
<p align=left>Carara Biological Reserve (4,700 hectares) is a transition zone between dry tropical forest and the wetter regions to the south. It is laced by countless rivers, the 
largest being the Tarcoles. During the rainy season, the Tarcoles floods its banks, creating a large lagoon that quickly fills with water hyacinth. Crocodiles and 
caimans are easily spotted along with plenty of wading birds. Coatimundis, peccaries, white-face capuchin, howler and spider monkeys, and the rare-two toed 
sloth can all be found here along with a great variety of plant life including fabulous heliconias. Carara is one of the few nesting areas remaining for the scarlet 
macaw. Throughout the day, the macaws can always be heard and often seen in flight, particularly around dusk. There are two paths. One starts at the main 
entrance and takes a short circular route, the other begins 2 km away and passes the lagoon. Easily accessible for day trips from San Jose, but accommodation 
also available locally.It is located 88 km west of San Jose </p>
<h4 align=left><a name="man">MANUEL </a>ANTONIO PARK</h4>
<p align=left>Manuel Antonio National Park (683 hectares) is Costa Rica's most famous national park and one of its most visited. It comprises a small, forested area, heavily 
populated by monkeys and raccoons, and three exceptionally beautiful beaches. It is one of the few remaining areas in which the squirrel monkey is found. Trails 
pass through secondary forest and primary forest, dominated by bastard cedar and balsa and mangrove swamps. The beaches are fringed with coconut palm, as 
befits a tropical paradise. A tombolo makes a footbridge, connecting the mainland to what used to be an island, Punta Catedral. Unfortunately there is no bridge 
across the river that has to be crossed to reach the park entrance and visitors arriving at high tide will have to wade through chest high water. </p>
<h4 align=left><a name="monte">MONTEVERDE</a> CLOUD FOREST </h4>
<p align=left>This small community in north-western Costa Rica was founded by Quakers in 1951 and is now a popular and interesting destination for both local and 
international visitors. Its attractions include a cloud forest, walking trails, quetzals, cheese factory, butterfly garden and a number of art galleries. The Cloud Forest, 
probably the best known Cloud Forest park in Costa Rica, is a private reserve and can be easily visited on one's own or with one of the local guides. The park has 
been over-visited for years so animals are difficult to spot and the authorities have been trying to limit the number of daily visitors.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Punta">Puntarenas</a></h2>
<p>Puntarenas is the largest province of Costa Rica, and also the main city on the Pacific Coast. The city economy has been steadily declining and we now use it as a 
boarding point for Calypso cruises and for the ferry to Paquera - Puntarenas also encompasses the Gulf of Nicoya and its many small islands most of which are 
biological preservation areas. Islands in the Gulf and is a starting point for cruises through the Gulf.</p>
<h3>Calypso Cruises</h3>
<p>One of the great experiences in Costa Rica on the most modern vessel cruising the Nicoya Bay, the <strong>Manta Ray.</strong> An incredible combination of blue water, white 
sand, green mountains and gourmet cuisine on board a deluxe catamaran featuring an underwater viewing window, fresh water showers and a full bar. The 
spacious, air-conditrioned main salon combines with an expansive deck area which includes 2 Jacuzzi pools. Bring casual clothing, bathing suit or shorts, suntan 
lotion, camera, sun glasses, hat, light weight long-sleeved shirt, sandals, tennis or boat shoes only. We include the Calypso Cruise on many of our packages.</p>
<h2><a name="jaco">Jaco Beach</a></h2>
<p>Jaco Beach, being one of the beaches closest to San Jos&eacute; is a favorite among tourists. The gray sand beach extends for 5 miles and is located only 119 km from 
the Central Valley. Surfing is one of the main attractions as well as the nearby Carara Biological Reserve. </p>
<h2><a name="que">Quepos</a></h2>
<p>The little village of Quepos is famous for its nearby Park of Manuel Antonio and as a small leisure fishing port </p>

<hr>
<h2 align=left>South-western Pacific</h2>
<p align=left>Moisture and precipitation increase as the traveler heads South. This too is a land of mystery with sacred burial grounds, violent thunderstorms, and two of the most 
beautiful national parks in the country, Corcovado, and Isla del Coco, the latter being an island under the administrative control of the national park&#146;s department 
360 nautical miles off this tropical coast. The historical ties of past cultures stem from South America and have provided archeologists and collectors with some of 
the most beautiful and ornate gold ornaments and bisquit pottery found on the isthmus. The archeological background of this region is not complete with some of 
the most puzzling mysteries regarding this region&#146;s past. This is the land of giant spheres which one Dutch author speculated are projectiles fired by spacecrafts 
thousands of years ago. Science cannot agree on their origin; it&#146;s their size and weight that poses doubts to most theories. The largest are over nine feet in diameter 
weigh over 2,000 pounds and are hundreds or thousands of years old. How did those ancient craftsmen cut the hard volcanic stone in spheres only degrees off 
perfect circles.</p>
<p align=left>Corcovado National Park is the tropical jewel of this system. It is pristine except for a few areas of radical destruction caused by illegal gold miners on the south 
end of the park. Most of its rare and endangered species are cradled between this disturbed zone and the growing communities on the northern coastline. Covering 
30% of the Osa Peninsula on which it sits, it harbors eight distinct habitats from mangrove estuaries to mountain forests. It protects over 280 species of birds and 
nearly 140 species of mammals. It is also the administrative center for a neighboring island, Ca&ntilde;o. Here visitors can see the large sights where ancient chiefs and 
shamans were buried amid a tropical ambiance that covers the island in a sparse green forest belt. The surrounding sea is clear and harbors dozens of different reefs 
where tiny fish abound. </p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="sp_pk">The Parks</a></h2>
<h4 align=left><a name="cor">CORCOVADO PARK</a></h4>
<p align=left>Further South the coast forms a peninsula which receives the influences of a wetter climate pattern during the rainy season from April to early December. Osa 
Peninsula gets its name from the ant bear, or giant anteater which raises its body partially upright in an intimidating gesture when approached by a predator. Not 
unlike the ant bear the peninsula can be very intimidating to the inexperienced. It&#146;s covered with a large coastal rain forest uncommon on the Pacific side of the 
isthmus which is protected by the boundaries of Corcovado National Park. Its central forest core is untouched in most areas with a large semicircular tract of 
primary forest which extends to the north end of the park. Its southern flank has retained much of the original primary forest but has been marred by the 
indiscriminate exploitation of gold along many of its riverbanks during the 1980&#146;s. Rivers were disrupted with dynamite and damming changing the face of the 
park&#146;s southern watershed for some time to come.<br>
Today the park is healing and visitors have the rare opportunity to see one of the last stands of pristine rain forest on the Pacific side of Central America. Nineteen 
feet of rain falls on Corcovado from mid April until Christmas keeping the 42,000 hectare park enveloped in a moisture bath. Deeper windless environmental niches 
are cloaked in epiphytic growth anchored into patches of lichen, moss and algae. Giant trees here often hold more leaf mass than they produce and are sometimes 
forced to stand with thousands of pounds of water collected in the staggering number of bromeliads. After the rain the only thing that prevails visually besides green 
is the shimmer-and iridescence of moisture reflecting off the leaf surfaces. Corcovado is home to the largest numbers of Scarlet macaws. Three hundred and 
fourteen other birds also reside in the Park including some of natures most melodic songsters like the tinamou and yes even the Great potoo. Four species of sea 
turtles nest on the park&#146;s beaches: the Green, Pacific Ridley, Hawksbill, and Leatherback; and the waters beyond the surf are well known for their large population 
of Tiger sharks. Less than twenty kilometers from the northwest corner of the Osa lies a tiny island called Ca&ntilde;o. Under the administrative guidance and protection 
of Corcovado, Ca&ntilde;o is an archeological site among blue waters, rocky reefs and a contrasting climate pattern that shakes the vicinity during fast moving 
thunderstorms. More than any other point in the region, lightening strikes the island hard, often visible from the mainland. Indigenous cultures worshipped the ground 
because of the frequent strikes, and it became a sacred place to bury leaders and shaman. Charts and broken implements are scattered around the island. </p>
<h4 align=left><a name="ami">LA AMISTAD PARK</a></h4>
<p align=left>One park highlights this attribute, La Amistad, for within its boundaries which extend North to include Mt. Chirripo and South to include the Panamanian Chiriqui 
region, 65% of Costa Rica&#146;s flora and fauna is represented on less than one-tenth its landmass. It&#146;s these consistent figures that envelope the researcher and slowly 
unfold the real value of this multi-faceted environment. If this giant park, La Amistad or the &quot;Friendship Park&quot;, is in fact only half as rich in flora and fauna as has 
been touted it will still remain the greatest biological reservoir in Central America. But what if it comes close to biological estimating or even exceeds local 
researchers expectations, what would these two countries have? If comparisons are bantered about due to the lack of precise data from the field, one might end up 
with figures like, nearly six hundred species of birds, more than two hundred species of reptiles and amphibians and almost as many mammals. It has the only true 
paramo in the country and probably the largest concentration of the Resplendent Quetzals remaining in the wild, throughout its range. With the exception of a 
popular trail used to ascend Mt. Chirripo on the north end of the park, La Amistad remains tightly knit against the highest mountains in the region, remote and 
untouched. Dr. Luis Diego Gomez, Director of the Wilson Botanical Gardens and former Director of the Museo Nacional, is probably one of the most 
knowledgeable scientists who has explored the trails of Amistad. For the last two decades he has classified the ferns, orchids and related plants of the region but 
one of his most outstanding experiences came with a fellow researcher when they entered a valley full of the endangered Quetzals. In three days while working in a 
premontane forest on another project, Dr. Gomez and the other had counted seventy-five Quetzals.</p>
<p align=left>La Amistad&#146;s nearly two hundred thousand hectares holds the richest tract of montane forests in the country and probably on the isthmus. Mt. Chirripo National 
Park on Amistad&#146;s Northwestern corner of the tract has a large percentage of the three major mountain life zones; lower montane forest, montane rain forest and 
sub-alpine rain paramo. At the pinnacle of Mt. Chirripo observers can see both the Caribbean and the Pacific with a turn of the head. On more nights than not, the 
peak freezes with the coldest recorded temperatures reaching minus 9 C or 16 F. Several of the lakes near the summit have been established as formations left by 
glaciers 30,000 years ago on this largest mountain range in Costa Rica, the Talamancas. This is one of the least known parklands because of its remote location and 
lack of access roads into its interior of dense, sloping montane forest. Higher elevation cloud forests are buffeted by high winds and driving rains creating logistical 
nightmares for those in search of experiences or scientific goals within the canopied forest! For those who eventually make the journey it quickly becomes one of 
the most memorable experiences of a lifetime. It lies untouched with sounds and sights that have all but disappeared in many neotropical regions.</p>
<h3><a name="wil">&#160;WILSON BOTANICAL GARDENS</a></h3>
<p>The Wilson Botanical Gardens (also known as the Las Cruces Biological Station), six km south of San Vito, is much more than its name suggests and well worth 
the drive south in itself! Foremost are the 10 hectares of cultivated gardens established in 1963 by Robert and Catherine Wilson, former owners of Fantastic 
Gardens in Miami. The garden was inspired, in part, by the famous Brazilian gardener Roberto Burle-Marx, a friend of Wilson's, who designed much of the garden 
following his vision of parterres as a palette. Wilson and his wife are buried in a humble grave in the grounds. Approximately 10 km of trails meander through the 
Fern Grove, Orchid Grotto, the largest palm collection in the world, agave and lily beds, and heliconia groves containing over 1,000 genera in 212 plant families. 
Las Cruces acts as a center for research, scientific training, and public education. New plants are propagated for horticulture, and species threatened with habitat 
loss and extinction are maintained for future reforestation efforts. The forest reserve is one of the few intact forest remnants in the area: all other adjacent lands have 
been clear-cut for agriculture. The reserve is located in mid-elevation tropical rainforest along a ridge of the Fila Zapote Range. During the wet season, heavy fog 
and afternoon clouds spill over the ridge, nourishing a rich epiphytic flora of orchids, bromeliads, ferns, and aeroids. The forest is a vital habitat for paces, anteaters, 
opossums, kinkajous, porcupines, armadillos, sloths, tayras, monkeys, deer, small cats, and over 35 species of bats. Bird-watching at Las Cruces is especially 
rewarding: 315 species have been recorded.</p>
<h3><a name="cano">CANO ISLAND BIOLOGICAL RESERVE</a></h3>
<p>Cano Island is 17 km off the western tip of the Osa Peninsula. It is of interest primarily for its inshore coral reefs and its importance as a pre-Colombian cemetery. 
There are many tombs and artifacts and granite spheres (boles) gathering moss in the rainforest undergrowth. The 300-hectare island is ringed with secluded 
white-sand beaches which attract olive Ridley turtles. Among its residents are boa constrictors (the only poisonous snakes here are sea snakes), giant frogs, a 
variety of hummingbirds, and three mammal species: a marsupial, the pace (which was introduced), and a bat. Surprisingly, only 13 terrestrial bird species are found 
here. Snorkelers can see brilliant tropical fish and moray eels among the coral beds. Offshore waters teem with common and bottle-nosed dolphins, and sperm, 
pilot, and humpback whales, which migrate down from Alaska.<br>
If you think you see the beach moving, it's not the heat waves nor last night's possible excesses. Daily, whole columns of little whelks and conchs of green and blue 
and russet-chrome march down from the root of the mangroves on to the sand. Scavengers only an inch long, soldier crabs are born and grow up without 
protective shells. For self-preservation they move into empty seashells they find cast up on the beach. Although they grow, their seashell houses do not; thus whole 
battalions of crabs continually seek newer and larger quarters. When threatened, a soldier crab pulls back into its shell, totally blocking the entrance with one big 
claw.</p>

<h3><a name="iti"><font color="#008040">The Itinerary Highlights</font></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Puntarenas</strong> - From San Jose, you will depart on a scenic 90 minute drive along the Pan American Highway to Puntarenas. After a few words from our 
crew and a few margaritas from our bar, we'll set sail for Curu.</li>
<li><strong>Curu/Tortuga Island </strong>- This private biological reserve means plenty of things you want to see (monkeys and black hawks and dry tropical forests). In the 
afternoon we'll head to Tortuga Island where you can play volleyball, sea kayak, or just watch the seagrass grow. And don't bother getting up from your 
towel - dinner will be served right on the beach.</li>
<li><strong>Corcovado National Park</strong> - Please don't feed the tourists. The ones found in the rainforests here are on a strict diet of isolation, enlightenment and 
education. There are plenty of hikes and plenty of animals &#151; 624 species of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians to be exact. We'll anchor at night in 
the peaceful waters of Drake Bay and watch a group of local Costa Rican children perform. </li>
<li><strong>Golfo Dulce/Golfito</strong> - Golfo Dulce is home to a huge variety of orchids and an 800 acre coconut tree lined beach at the foot of a rainforest. After a hike 
among the toucans and monkeys of this primary forest, we'll head to Golfito, one of the more booming towns we'll visit. There's actually a restaurant here. Of 
course, you have to paddle your sea kayak to get to it, but why burden you details? </li>
<li><strong>Corcovado </strong>- Again we'll visit Corcovado, this time to explore the Conservation Area for an early morning birdwatching hike. You&#146;ll have a chance to take a 
horseback ride along the beach or head off with the local guides on a deep-sea fishing trip. For the even more adventurous, cruise up the Agujitas River for 
happy hour at the local lodge. </li>
<li><strong>Manuel Antonio National Park</strong> - It's quiet. It's peaceful. It's idyllic. Then a pack of squirrel monkeys swing through the rainforest and all hell breaks loose. 
The toucans squawk. The agoutis scatter. The sloths...don t do anything, they're sloths. Be sure to wear your sunscreen today. Tonight's the last night 
onboard and you know what that means&#151; yep, dance contest. </li>

<h3><a name="iti"><font color="#008040">The Itinerary Highlights</font></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Puntarenas</strong> - From San Jose, you will depart on a scenic 90 minute drive along the Pan American Highway to Puntarenas. After a few words from our 
crew and a few margaritas from our bar, we'll set sail for Curu.</li>
<li><strong>Curu/Tortuga Island </strong>- This private biological reserve means plenty of things you want to see (monkeys and black hawks and dry tropical forests). In the 
afternoon we'll head to Tortuga Island where you can play volleyball, sea kayak, or just watch the seagrass grow. And don't bother getting up from your 
towel - dinner will be served right on the beach.</li>
<li><strong>Cano Island </strong>- The snorkeling is extraordinary in the reefs of Cano Island. Did you hear that? Cano has its roots in pre-Columbian trading. There it is again. 
Oh yeah, it's also a former burial ground for Coastal Indians. You'll spend an entire day here hiking, reading and looking over your shoulder.</li>
<li><strong>Corcovado National Park</strong> - Please don't feed the tourists. The ones found in the rainforests here are on a strict diet of isolation, enlightenment and 
education. There are plenty of hikes and plenty of animals &#151; 624 species of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians to be exact. We'll anchor at night in 
the peaceful waters of Drake Bay and watch a group of local Costa Rican children perform. </li>
<li><strong>Golfo Dulce/Golfito</strong> - Golfo Dulce is home to a huge variety of orchids and an 800 acre coconut tree lined beach at the foot of a rainforest. After a hike 
among the toucans and monkeys of this primary forest, we'll head to Golfito, one of the more booming towns we'll visit. There's actually a restaurant here. Of 
course, you have to paddle your sea kayak to get to it, but why burden you details? </li>
<li><strong>Corcovado </strong>- Again we'll visit Corcovado, this time to explore the Conservation Area for an early morning birdwatching hike. You&#146;ll have a chance to take a 
horseback ride along the beach or head off with the local guides on a deep-sea fishing trip. For the even more adventurous, cruise up the Agujitas River for 
happy hour at the local lodge. </li>
<li><strong>Manuel Antonio National Park</strong> - It's quiet. It's peaceful. It's idyllic. Then a pack of squirrel monkeys swing through the rainforest and all hell breaks loose. 
The toucans squawk. The agoutis scatter. The sloths...don t do anything, they're sloths. Be sure to wear your sunscreen today. Tonight's the last night 
onboard and you know what that means&#151; yep, dance contest. </li>

<p align=left>A shoreline of 767 miles, three mountain ranges that soar to 12,533 feet at Mt. Chirripo and slice through the center of the nation, feeding literally hundreds of 
magnificent rivers. These make Costa Rica a true water wonderland. Its fishing is legendary, but Costa Rica also offers world class white water rafting and 
kayaking on its turbulent rivers. On its coasts, sea kayaking, unsurpassed diving, and surfing that has been rated as among the best in the world. Knowledgeable 
travelers already know about the rich natural treasures that Costa Rica offers: a world-famous system of National Parks, ideal climate, incredible scenery, a 
mind-boggling variety of tropical flowers and exotic birds. In addition to the world's best year around fishing, and idyllic beaches. Not so well known&#151; except 
among true aficionados is the fact that Costa Rica offers some of the world's best white water river rafting.</p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=15%><p align=center><img src="images/raftings.jpeg" align=bottom width=161 height=108> </p>
</td><td width=50%><p align=left>Wild and untamed, these big, brash rivers plunge through spectacularly beautiful, largely unexplored tropical wilderness. 
According to the experts, Costa Rica's white water rivers compare favorably to California's Tuolomne and Idaho's famous 
Middle Fork of the Salmon. The Chirripo River, for example, drops 50 feet per mile and produces more than 100 top-class 
rapids in the first 40 miles. Costa Rica's ideal weather allows year around rafting, even in the rainy season, which generally 
runs from late May through the end of November. In fact, its is during the rainy season when the rivers are at their highest and 
wildest, that the really serious rafters come to Costa Rica. Among the most popular rafting rivers are the Pacuare, Reventazon 
and Chirripo. </p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p align=left>These big, exciting rivers plunge through canyons traversing virgin jungles while waterfalls cascade down the slopes of surrounding mountains. Wildlife is abundant, 
iguanas sun themselves, otters play in the pools, and the surrounding wilderness is home to tapir, jaguar, ocelot, deer and hundreds of varieties of birds. The 
Pacuare tumbles down from the Talamanca mountains east of San Jose and finally empties into the Caribbean. With conditions suitable for rafting all year, the 
Pacuare offers spectacular two or three day trips through virgin jungle as the river rushes through steep, forested canyons. The Reventazon has something for 
everyone, with one day runs of varying difficulty. The upper run is for those in good shape and highly motivated. In the first three miles, the river drops 126 feet per 
mile. It's virtually one constant rapid. A lower run on the Reventazon is even more challenging, offering nine miles of continuous Class V action. The middle run is 
fine for children as well as older folks, according to the white water tour operators. &quot;It's safe but not boring, with enough rapids and water in the face to provide 
excitement.&quot; The Chirripo is bigger and wider and flows with more power than the Pacuare, but because the chutes are not as narrow and tricky it is not as difficult 
to navigate. Nevertheless, waves up to 15 feet high and flows that reach upwards of 15,000 cubic feet per second provide incredible excitement.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="river"><font size=5><strong>THE RIVERS</strong></font></a><font size=4><strong> - </strong></font>The five rivers described below are typical of the variety of white water available. </p>
<dir>
<li><p align=left><strong>SARAPIQUI RIVER</strong> - Gathering its waters from the slopes of Poas Volcano, the Sarapiqui flows north through the province of Heredia, joined by 
numerous cascading tributaries. From La Virgen to Chilamate, the Sarapiqui drops continuously over moderate rapids while flowing alternately between lush 
forest and open fields, an ideal intermediate river. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><strong>REVENTAZON RIVER</strong> - Reventazon means bursting waters and this is one river that lives up to its name. From the put-in at the Cachi powerplant to the 
town of Tucurrique, the river descends at breakneck pace, producing continuous Class IV rapids. From Tucurrique to Angostura, the gradient decreases to 
half of its previous value, producing long pools between rapids and allowing paddles opportunity to enjoy the scenery. There are still some memorable rapids 
in this section, however. Below Angostura. the Reventazon enters a small gorge adjacent to the CATIE research center and undergoes another 
transformation, with fierce rapids and little opportunity to recover between them. After the junction with the Turrialba River, the corridor opens up, but long, 
difficult rapids are encountered all the way to Siquirres. These lower sections have many Class V rapids, making the section appropriate only for expert 
paddlers. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><strong>PACUARE RIVERS </strong>- Flowing parallel to the Reventazon, only 15 to 20 miles away, the Pacuare is as different from its neighbor as any two white water 
rivers can be. While the Reventazon flows almost entirely through open cultivated fields, the Pacuare flows through a narrow canyon cloaked in dense virgin 
forest. Further, the Pacuare is smaller, much more secluded and generally inaccessible. The section of the Pacuare from San Martin to Siquirres has every 
element of the perfect river trip: many rapids of intermediate difficulty and a few difficult rapids, wondrous scenery and abundant wildlife. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><strong>GENERAL RIVER </strong>- Starting at the town of San Isidro, a trip down the General begins on a small mountain stream. With every bend, however, it seems 
that another tributary joins the river. By the time the trip ends 50 miles later at El Brujo, the General has grown to a river even larger than the Reventazon. As 
it grows, the river changes character constantly. The channel gets wider, while the rapids grow in power with each mile. The culmination of this growth is a 
rapid called &quot;Chachaloca&quot; where a standing wave that reaches up to 15 feet lies in wait. Trips down the General last from three to five days, with nights spent 
camping along the river. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><strong>COROBICI RIVER</strong> - Unlike the other rivers described here, the Corobici is a small stream with a rather gentle gradient. Its flow is augmented 
substantially by the diverted flows of the Arenal River, making it voluminous enough for kayaking and rafting. Flowing through the relatively arid region of 
Guanacaste, the river channel is a true oasis in the midst of the extensive ranches of the region. As a result, birds nest in profusion here. At the adjacent Palo 
Verde National Park, over 300 species of birds have been identified. There are also Howler monkeys, iguanas and lizards in abundance. The Corobici trip is 
highly recommended for anyone who wishes to see an abundance of wildlife. The rapids are easy, making the river well suited to beginners. With 635 miles 
of shoreline along the Pacific coast and 132 miles on the Caribbean, and both oceans fed by literally hundreds of rivers, Costa Rica offers unequaled 
opportunity to enjoy the rapidly growing sport of sea kayaking. </p>

</td><td width=50%><p align=left>With thousands of miles of shoreline, lake shores and rivers, Costa Rica is one of the foremost watersport wonderlands in the 
world. From diving on tropical coral reefs to running white water rivers through upper elevation rain forests, the action runs 
throughout the year. Organized sports include: white water kayaking and rafting, open water and shallow water diving, surfing, 
wind surfing, ocean kayaking, sailing, swimming, and thermal dips into volcanic eddies that line the active crater slopes. </p>
<p align=left>News of Costa Rica&#146;s incredible white water scenery and wildlife spread quickly through the international kayaking community 
following the first major expedition in 1980. Kayakers from Europe and North America have been coming in increasing 
numbers ever since. With its tropical climate, rugged scenery and abundant rainfall, Costa Rica is a white water paradise; no 
other place on earth can match its abundance of navigable waters in such a small area. At least 20 different rivers have been 
kayaked and more are being explored every year. The five rivers described below are the best available. </p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<dir>
<li><p align=left><a name="riv"><strong>THE MAIN KAYAKING RIVERS:</strong></a> </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><strong>SARAPIQUI RIVER</strong> - Gathering its waters from the slopes of Poas Volcano, the Sarapiqui flows north through the province of Heredia, joined by 
numerous cascading tributaries. From La Virgen to Chilamate, the Sarapiqui drops continuously over moderate rapids while flowing alternately between lush 
forest and open fields, an ideal intermediate river. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><strong>REVENTAZON RIVER</strong> - Reventazon means bursting waters and this is one river that lives up to its name. From the put-in at the Cachi powerplant to the 
town of Tucurrique, the river descends at breakneck pace, producing continuous Class IV rapids. From Tucurrique to Angostura, the gradient decreases to 
half of its previous value, producing long pools between rapids and allowing paddles opportunity to enjoy the scenery. There are still some memorable rapids 
in this section, however. Below Angostura. the Reventazon enters a small gorge adjacent to the CATIE research center and undergoes another 
transformation, with fierce rapids and little opportunity to recover between them. After the junction with the Turrialba River, the corridor opens up, but long, 
difficult rapids are encountered all the way to Siquirres. These lower sections have many Class V rapids, making the section appropriate only for expert 
paddlers. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><strong>PACUARE RIVERS </strong>- Flowing parallel to the Reventazon, only 15 to 20 miles away, the Pacuare is as different from its neighbor as any two white water 
rivers can be. While the Reventazon flows almost entirely through open cultivated fields, the Pacuare flows through a narrow canyon cloaked in dense virgin 
forest. Further, the Pacuare is smaller, much more secluded and generally inaccessible. The section of the Pacuare from San Martin to Siquirres has every 
element of the perfect river trip: many rapids of intermediate difficulty and a few difficult rapids, wondrous scenery and abundant wildlife. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><strong>GENERAL RIVER </strong>- Starting at the town of San Isidro, a trip down the General begins on a small mountain stream. With every bend, however, it seems 
that another tributary joins the river. By the time the trip ends 50 miles later at El Brujo, the General has grown to a river even larger than the Reventazon. As 
it grows, the river changes character constantly. The channel gets wider, while the rapids grow in power with each mile. The culmination of this growth is a 
rapid called &quot;Chachaloca&quot; where a standing wave that reaches up to 15 feet lies in wait. Trips down the General last from three to five days, with nights spent 
camping along the river. </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><strong>COROBICI RIVER</strong> - Unlike the other rivers described here, the Corobici is a small stream with a rather gentle gradient. Its flow is augmented 
substantially by the diverted flows of the Arenal River, making it voluminous enough for kayaking and rafting. Flowing through the relatively arid region of 
Guanacaste, the river channel is a true oasis in the midst of the extensive ranches of the region. As a result, birds nest in profusion here. At the adjacent Palo 
Verde National Park, over 300 species of birds have been identified. There are also Howler monkeys, iguanas and lizards in abundance. The Corobici trip is 
highly recommended for anyone who wishes to see an abundance of wildlife. The rapids are easy, making the river well suited to beginners. With 635 miles 
of shoreline along the Pacific coast and 132 miles on the Caribbean, and both oceans fed by literally hundreds of rivers, Costa Rica offers unequaled 
opportunity to enjoy the rapidly growing sport of sea kayaking. </p>

<p align=left>The long, slender one and two man craft provided are remarkably stable and ideally suited for investigating both the ocean coast and the many flat water rivers of 
Costa Rica.</p>

<h3 align=left><a name="sea">SEA KAYAKING</a></h3>
<p align=left>With nearly 800 miles of shoreline along the and Caribbean coast, Costa Rica offers great sea kayaking. The long, slender crafts provided are remarkably stable 
and ideally suited for investigating both the ocean coast and the many flat water rivers of Costa Rica. The basics of kayaking are easy to learn. Long, two-bladed 
paddles allow the paddlers to stroke alternately on each side of the boat, and they have rudders operated by foot pedals which makes steering in the wind and 
waves easy to control. Experienced guides will give the beginner a fast course that includes getting in and out, basic paddling and handling, and even a &quot;dunk&quot; test 
that requires deliberately rolling it over and slipping out. After a discussion of safety procedures and a &quot;map check&quot; to agree on the day&#146;s destination, the 
adventurers glide silently through the shadows of overhanging trees. Only the steady click of cameras and soft voices betray their presence.</p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=14%><img src="images/cos_ska.jpeg" align=bottom width=186 height=85></td><td width=50%>The original sea kayak was designed centuries ago by the Aleut people of northern Canada, but those original fragile craft of 
sealskin and driftwood have since evolved into seaworthy boats of fiberglass and plastic, with built-in watertight compartments 
to provide permanent flotation and make them virtually unsinkable. The basics of kayaking are easy to learn. Long, two-bladed 
paddles allow the paddlers to stroke alternately on each side of the boat, and they have rudders operated by foot pedals which 
makes steering in wind and waves easy to control. </td></tr>

<p align=left>Experienced guides will first give the beginner a fast course that includes getting in and out, basic paddling and handling, and even a &quot;dunk&quot; test that requires 
deliberately rolling it over and slipping out. After a discussion of safety procedures and a &quot;map check&quot; to agree on the day's destination, a typical voyage might 
begin on the jungle lined Bebedero River, through Costa Rica's Palo Verde National Forest. The adventurers glide silently through the shadows of overhanging 
trees. A huge salmon colored iguana basks on a branch, inches away. Only the steady click of cameras and soft voices betray their presence. Slipping back into the 
gentle current, they drift through doppled sunlight as multi-colored birds tense for flight and then relax as they pass. Howler monkeys start up a raucous chorus. and 
suddenly the guide signals from the bank that he's found something of special interest. Each boat swings in his direction, where a boa constrictor is wrapped around 
a tree branch in the shade, only five feet away. </p>
<p align=left>The following day, the adventurers paddle to a pickup point and a short shuttle to the second part of the journey. They will spend five days on the ocean, paddling 
from one secluded Pacific beach to another along the rugged Pacific coast. The paddlers establish a rhythm in the mesmerizing motion of the sea. Dolphins and 
schools of fish break the surface near the boats and a couple of avid anglers in the group trail fishing lines in hopes of catching a treat for dinner. Passing rocky 
points, they watch the swells thunder against the foam flecked rocks, and as confidence in their kayaking skills increase, they find caves and arches to explore.<br>
At night, the kayaks are pulled high on shore and camping gear is shuttled from the accompanying support boat to the beach. The guides produce hearty meals. 
complete with plenty of fresh tropical fruits, tasty deserts, beer and wine. It's an adventure like no other. </p>

then disappear, leaving promises unfulfilled. But for many surfers, the search has ended in Costa Rica where a tantalizing array of 
year-round waves and uncrowded beaches have convinced countless devotees from throughout the world that this is as close to heaven 
as they can ever expect to get. From the short, powerful rise of the Caribbean coast to waves so long on the Pacific side that you can 
take a nap on them, the surf in Costa Rica is world class. With two oceans sending swells to this nation, countless magnificent beaches 
provide surf year around. It is difficult to gauge the best months to surf at the various spots, but if one break is not working, another is 
sure to be cooking. Surfing is highly seasonal but available most of the year on one of the coastlines. As winds shift from interior mountain 
chains they interact with the seaborn breezes and create surfing playgrounds. The country is so diverse that experiences are continuous</td></tr>

<dir>
<li><strong>BOCA DE BARRANCA</strong>, located near the city of Puntarenas. It is the closest surfing spot to San Jose, only two hours by bus, and often considered the 
place where surfing began in the country. Although the left breaking wave is relatively slow, it can be one of the longest in the world, sometimes traveling 
nearly a mile. Most surfing is May through December.</li>
<li><strong>PLAYA NARANJO,</strong> often called one of the best beach breaks in the country, is located in Santa Rosa National Park on the country's northern Pacific 
coast in the province of Guanacaste.</li>
<li><strong>PLAYA TAMARINDO</strong>, in Guanacaste, has three areas for surfing: A rocky right point, an excellent river mouth and another rocky point. Traveling south 
of here, to the isolated Nicoya Peninsula, should satisfy anyone dedicated to a surf safari, providing literally dozens of isolated beaches with hollow beach 
breaks, right point breaks and very fast waves. Tamarindo, Naranjo and other beaches in the Guanacaste province are characterized by light offshore winds 
from November through April. However, the swells are normally bigger during the rainy season from April through October.</li>
<li><strong>JACO BEACH</strong> and <strong>PLAYA HERMOSA</strong> are located south of Puntarenas on the Pacific coast. Jaco offers waves for beginners and intermediate surfers, 
while Playa Hermosa has miles of expert beach break. An international contest is held here every August.</li>
<li><strong>QUEPOS</strong> and <strong>PLAYA DOMINICAL</strong>, further south, are great for beginning surfers, with smaller waves.</li>
<li><strong>PAVONES</strong> is located near the Panama border on the Pacific sic-e. It's hard to get here during the rainy season from April through October, but that's when 
the waves are biggest and the long left point can offer a three minute ride. The nearby Osa Peninsula is one of Costa Rica's wildest jungle areas, and has 
many still unexplored surfing beaches accessible only by boat.</li>
<li><strong>PLAYA BONITA</strong>, near the Caribbean port city of Limon, features waves that are big, powerful and dangerous.</li>
<li><strong>PUERTO VIEJO</strong> is located south of Playa Bonita. Besides a heavy dose of reggae in this charming Caribbean town, you can find Costa Rica's biggest 
waves at a point called &quot;Salsa Brava,&quot; which provides a thick, hollow right. </li>
</dir>
<p align=left>Two seasons define the Caribbean coast. From December until March, offshore storms kick up waves, while from June through late August Costa Rica enjoys the 
benefits of great surfing generated by hurricanes in the distant islands of the Caribbean . In addition to the spots named above, surfers will find numerous other 
breaks just by exploring the Caribbean's 132 miles of coastline or the 635 miles on the Pacific side. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="wind">WIND-SURFING</a></h3>
<p>Some the best wind-surfing in the world (second only to The Gorge in Washington State) is available in Costa Rica on Lake Arenal. Here you will find 20 - 30 + 
Knot winds, 70/75 degrees water with 3 foot swells while the air temperature is 70 to 80 degrees. The lake is 48 square miles, 24 miles long. All this makes it a 
veritable paradise for the wind-surfer. <em><strong>CALL or E-MAIL us for details </strong></em></p>
<p>The best way to surf Costa Rica is by having your own car and &quot;follow the waves&quot;. In the Green Season (from April to November) we offer a SURFARI Program 
which is particularly aimed at the surfers wanting to experience what Costa Rica has to offer. Click the link to the <a href="cos_flex.html"><font size=4><em><strong>SURFARI PROGRAMS </strong></em></font></a>to learn more

have opened miles of coastline and inshore islands to underwater exploration. New facilities along the west coast 
now offer first class dive boats, compressors and all equipment, including fully stocked dive shops. Operators have 
certified instructors and dive masters available. It is truly virgin diving, as every trip opens undersea vistas that have 
never before been explored. Most diving is around rock formations, from 20 to 100 feet depths. Visibility ranges 
between 20 and 80 feet and water temperatures a steady 75 to 85 degrees, with 80 to 90 degree air temperatures

<p align=left>The Guanacaste region in northwest Costa Rica has been the site of most recent activity. Favored dive destinations in that area are the<strong> Murcielagos (Bat) 
Islands</strong>, about one hour running time from the boat landings, and the <strong>Catalina Islands</strong>, only 30 minutes away. Both areas present a spiny outcropping of rocks 
that abound in big fish, including grouper, snapper, jacks, sharks and mamas, as well as indigenous tropical species.</p>
<p align=left>But you don't have to go even that far to see the vast schools of brilliantly colored fish that abound in local dive spots only minutes away by boat. About mid-way 
down Costa Rica's Pacific coast at <strong>Bahia Herradura</strong> is an area known as El Jardin (The Garden), that is famed for its formations of soft coral and sea fans. There 
are no local dive operators, so charters would have to be arranged from Quepos or Puntarenas.</p>
<p align=left>Further south, <strong>Cano Island,</strong> just off the Osa Peninsula, is another virgin diving area with a reef that hosts a large variety of tropical fish as well as immense grouper, 
snapper and such game species as wahoo, roosterfish, jacks and tuna. That area is serviced by operators out of the Drake Bay region, or charters can be arranged 
out of Quepos. While the west coast of Costa Rica does not have the live coral reefs typical of the Caribbean, divers will see a great variety of soft coral, 
invertebrates, and fish beyond number. </p>
<p align=left>In addition to the coastal diving, there are multi-day charters out of Puntarenas to fabled <strong>Cocos Island</strong>, which has frequently been documented by television crews 
and has been the subject of a Jacques Cousteau special.</p>
<p align=left>On the Caribbean coast, the type of diving changes. Isla Uvita, just offshore from the port city of <strong>Limon</strong>, presents an opportunity to see a wide variety of tropical 
fish, sea fans and coral. There is also wreck diving on the Fenix, a cargo ship that sank about a mile off the island many years ago. </p>
<p align=left>Further south, at <strong>Cahuita</strong>, is Costa Rica's most beautiful coral reef <font color="#0000FF"><em>(please trake note that the last hearthquake has raised the level of the coast and created 
havoc wqith the coral species)</em></font>, host to a diverse population of brilliant tropical fish, and below that is Puerto Viejo, a very different area, with many undersea 
caverns. Although plans are in progress, the Caribbean coast has not yet developed an infrastructure catering to sport divers. However, there is a compressor in 
Limon and arrangements can be made in the local villages for small boats to take the adventurous to the dive spots. It is recommended for experienced divers who 
will be on their own. </p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=4><strong>Different programs for diving are available on the Pacific side where refulat infra-structures do exist. Packages are 
mostly arranged to the upper Guanacaste area (El Ocotal - Playa Samara). Southern Guancaste (some diving at

</td><td width=50%>The water explodes as a giant tarpon rockets from the depths of the blue Caribbean to soar skyward, twisting and turning in a wild frenzy to 
shake the angler's barb from its bony jaw! For legions of sportsmen, Megalops atlanticus offers the ultimate in sportfishing thrills, and no place 
in the world provides more or better tarpon action than the waters along Costa Rica's Caribbean coast. The aerial acrobats are here year 
around, but during the peak of it&#146;s season it is not unusual to raise 20 or more fish per day that average around 80 pounds each, with plenty 
running 100 pounds and over. But tarpon aren't the only prey available for anglers out of the five fishing lodges that dot Costa Rica's 
Caribbean coast. The region is world famous for its snook fishing, and five of the current International Game Fish Association world records 
plus a fly fishing record for that species came from this area, including the all tackle 53 lb. 10 oz. snook taken here in 1978. Winter months, 
from about November through January, provide a special treat as great schools of a small variety of snook known locally as calba move into 
the area. They average around four pounds, and are taken on jigs and bass plugs worked along the river banks. You can fill the boat when 
the run is in full swing, hooking a fish on nearly every cast. Two IGFA record cubera snappers and a jack crevalle world mark have been 
caught by tarpon anglers working just outside the mouths of rivers flowing into the Caribbean, an area that also abounds in barracuda, 
kingfish, giant grouper and sharks, tripletail, mackerel and a host of other species. Less common in the region are catches of Atlantic sailfish, 
dorado and wahoo. Fishing the estuaries and freshwater rivers and backwater lagoons of the Caribbean region, light tackle enthusiasts also 
find plenty of drum, catfish, gar, and such exotic species as the rainbow bass (guapote), mojarra and machaca. </td></tr>
</table>
<p>But it is tarpon&#151;`'The Silver King&quot;&#151;that attracts most of the anglers from foreign shores, and the first class fishing lodges are ready, able and willing to show them 
the finest sport in the world. Three of the lodges are located near the mouth of the Rio Colorado, largest of the many rivers that flow into the Caribbean. Others are 
located at the mouths of the Tortuguero and Parismina rivers further south. You will fish from outboard powered launches, with a guide (most guides speak English) 
and two anglers in each boat. Tarpon are nearly always lip-gaffed, hoisted in the air for photos and released. The edible fish are taken back to the lodge for dinner. 
When weather and surf conditions permit, anglers usually move outside the river mouths where schools of leaping tarpon frequently spread for acres in every 
direction, and if the tarpons aren't hungry that day, there are always plenty of other fish to take up the slack. On those days when the boats can't get outside, there 
are usually tarpon to be found in the rivers and back lagoons as well, where you fish amidst an orchid draped jungle with monkeys chattering from the branches 
overhead. You are likely to see giant crocodiles basking along the shoreline, tree sloths clinging like statues to the towering trees, and a multitude of brilliantly hued 
parrots, macaws, toucans and other tropical birds When fishing for tarpon, two rules are paramount:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sharpen your hooks and set them hard, to penetrate its bone-hard jaw. Not just once, but twice and then again!</li>
<li>Remember always to &quot;bow to the king,&quot; which means dropping the tip of your rod each lime he jumps to allow slack in the line, cranking fast to pick it up 
again when the fish hits the water. You can be sure he will jump, probably four or more times, frequently soaring as high as 12 feet out of the water, shaking 
his head and putting on an unbelievable acrobatic display!</li>
</ol>
<p>The big snook are most often caught fishing from the beach around the river mouths as you wade in the 80 degree waters, but they can also be taken trolling along 
the shoreline or casting shallow running plugs. All of the lodges offer packages of one or more days fishing that include air transportation between San Jose and the 
lodge, overnight accommodations, all meals, boat and guide, Costa Rican fishing license, and beverages on the boat. Except for the fishing lodges along the 
northern coastal area, the Caribbean provides limited opportunity for offshore anglers. Fishing on your own generally requires some exploring to find a local 
fisherman with a boat and an outboard that is willing to negotiate a day's fishing out of areas such as Limon, Cahuita and Puerto Viejo further south. There the 
action is likely to be for corvina and snapper, although occasional schools of jacks will sometimes show. You can also find some good fishing from the beaches 
along the southern Caribbean coast at times, with best results around the mouths of the rivers and rocky promontories. Even tarpon are occasionally caught from 
the beach in those areas. Remember, however, that a Costa Rican fishing license is required. They can be most easily obtained through one of the tackle stores in 
San Jose, and it usually takes about two days. </p>
<h3><a name="tac">FISHING TACKLE</a></h3>
<p>The lodges have loaner tackle available, but it is a good idea to bring your own. A six to seven foot medium action rod and a reel (spinning or conventional) that will 
spool 150 to 200 yards of 20-pound test line is ideal for tarpon and trolling for snook. A lighter bait casting outfit will work for snook and as a backup for tarpon, 
and you may want a light bait casting or spinning rig for the backwaters. Favorite lures are the seven and nine inch sinking Rapalas in natural colors, fluorescent 
orange and red and white, Bomber plugs in bright colors: Seahawks: a selection of hair jigs or plastic tailed jigs like the Scampi or Sassy Shad; a variety of your 
favorite deep and shallow running bass plugs. Dark colored hair jigs and rattler plug work best for the winter calba runs. </p>

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=12%><img src="images/cos_fis2.jpeg" align=bottom width=181 height=482></td><td width=50%><p>Fishing just doesn't get any better than what you will find along Costa Rica's Pacific coast. . . Where else can you raise 20 to 30 
sailfish in a single day or have a chance for a super grand slam with sails, blue, black and striped marlin on the same day? Costa 
Rican anglers have scored as many as three super slams in a single season, and the largest marlin ever confirmed was a 958 
pounder. Even bigger ones have been hooked, so we know the &quot;granders&quot; are out there, just waiting to be caught. When fishing is at 
its best, the sails move in like sharks on a chum line, crashing the teaser, with double and triple hookups routine. Action begins only 
20 to 30 minutes running time from the landings, and seldom do boats have to go out more than 25 miles. In recent years, charter 
boats have caught and released an average of 500 marlin during the peak season from January through August and raised an average 
of 10 sails per boat each fishing day from April through mid-August. The annual four-day International Sailfish Tournament has 
consistently posted the highest success ratio of any billfish tournament in the world, with an average of from 1.5 to 2 sails per day, 
per angler caught and released on light tackle.</p>
<p>Besides billfish, Costa Rican waters also produce exceptional action on dorado, big snapper, tuna, jack crevalle, rainbow runner, 
blue runner, amberjack, grouper, mackerel. trevally, bonito, skipjack and other species. The dorado runs begin with the first rains in 
late May, as the myriad rivers flowing into the Pacific run full and carry logs, branches and other debris to sea that form into the trash 
lines that the colorful dolphin use for refuge. An 87-pound dorado caught here in 1976 still holds the International Game Fish 
Association all tackle record for the species, and fish in the 30 to 40 sound class are so common they're often considered a nuisance 
by billfishermen. An IGFA 78 lb. 12 oz. all tackle world record for Pacific dog snapper and two other line test records for the 
species were caught in Costa Rica's Pacific waters, and other IGFA line test and fly fishing records from the area include rainbow 
runner (two records), Pacific sailfish (two records), roosterfish, bigeye tuna and bigeye trevally. About 50 charter boats are available 
along the west coast, ranging from 23 feet to more than 50 feet, and most are fully equipped with 20 to 50 pound tournament quality 
tackle. Experienced captains and crews&#151;most of them English speaking&#151; will help rig your tackle if you wish, assuring even the 
first time angler a memorable experience. </p>
<p>The three basic fishing areas on the Pacific coast are the Guanacaste region to the north, the central coastal area around Quepos, 
and the Drake Bay, Golfito region to the south. Fishing will vary in each area according to the time of year, but it's impossible to 
offer more than an estimate of when fishing will be best for any given species in a specific area because of the seasonal differences in 
weather, currents, water temperatures and other variables. It's safe to say, however, that regardless of the time of year, Costa Rica 
will provide some of the best fishing in the world. </p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>To the north, boats are available in and around the areas of Flamingo Beach, Playa del Coco, Potrero, Playa Hermosa, Tamarindo and Playa Carillo. Two charter 
boat services run out of Quepos in the central coastal region, and both operators also arrange multi-day trips to the Drake Bay and Canos Island areas further 
south. Another fishing lodge is located on the Osa Peninsula in the Golfito area at the extreme southern end of Costa Rica. Packages normally include the required 
Costa Rican fishing license. </p>
<p>For anglers who want go exploring on their own, it is also possible to find local commercial fishermen with outboard powered launches who are willing to negotiate 
a price for a day's local fishing out of the small villages in Guanacaste, Puntarenas, Jaco, Quepos, the Osa Peninsula and Golfito. There are no guarantees, however, 
and the visiting fisherman will have to obtain his own fishing license and provide his own tackle and lures. Fishing from shore is also productive along the west coast, 
but access to some of the best areas is difficult except by four wheel drive. Best bets are at the river mouths and rocky points, for a variety of snapper, corvina and 
snook. Among the most productive snook areas are the mouths of the Nosara and Bongo Rivers on the Nicoya Peninsula, the Parrita. Naranjo and Savegre along 
the central coast and the Sierpe on the Osa Peninsula. The rocky jetties at the mouth of the estuary in Puntarenas usually have a run of small roosterfish on the 
outgoing tide, and also produce catfish and snapper. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="tac">FISHING TACKLE</a></h3>
<p>Charter boats provide a full range of tackle that includes 20 to 50 pound tournament class rods and reels. Fresh or frozen mullet is sometimes trolled, but skirted 
lures are equally productive. Lures are provided on the boat, but if you have some favorites, bring them along. If you prefer fly fishing or want to try for records on 
light tackle, it is advisable to bring your own equipment even though some of the charter operators now offer fly rods and light tackle for use. For shore fishing, a six 
to seven foot medium action spin casting or conventional outfit works fine. You may want to go to301b. test line to keep from losing a lot of lures in the rocks. Best 
all around lures are plastic tailed and hair jigs, heavy Sonics or Cordell rattlers and spoons. Bring hooks and sinkers for fishing with natural bait. </p>

<h4><a name="bnp"><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4>Best Fishing Seasons</font> </font></a><font color="#0000FF">- </font><b>PACIFIC - GUANACASTE REGION - NORTH</b> </h4>
<p>Marlin are caught every month, with mid-November to early March little short of exceptional. It generally slows from April into early June when it picks up again, 
peaking in August and September. Sailfish are also caught all year, with May through August the best months. They may begin to thin out in September and the 
slowest months are from late August through November. Tuna fishing is best from August through October, but they're around all year. Yellowfin and bigeye tuna 
are often found well inside the Catalina Islands, 30 minutes or less running time from the beach, while schools of 12 to 20 pounders often spread for acres under the 
working porpoise on the outside. Y ou will also frequently find concentrations of 40 to 60 pounders. Really big tuna, running over 200 pounds, peak from 
September through December. Dorado are most abundant from late May through October when the seasonal rains flood the rivers that carry out debris that forms 
trash lines close inshore that they like to lie under. Wahoo usually begin to show in May, peaking in July and August. Most are caught around the rocky points and 
islands. Roosterfish can be caught throughout the year, but biggest catches are generally made from November through March when more boats in the north are 
fishing inshore because of the winds. <font color="#008040"><strong>F</strong></font> = Fair -- <font color="#0000FF"><strong>G</strong></font> = Good -- <font color="#FF0000"><strong>E</strong></font> = Excellent</p>

<p>Marlin action is usually best from September through November, peaking in October. Sailfish action is normally outstanding from the middle of December through 
April, when they begin moving north. Tuna are found here throughout the year as they are all along the Pacific coast, but are most abundant from June through 
September. Wahoo are abundant in the late summer south of Quepos , especially in the Drake Bay and Cano Island area. Dorado action begins with the winter 
rains in late May. The wash debris from the river mouths create the inshore trash lines that they like to lie under. Roosterfish angling is excellent off the river mouths 
and the rocky dropoffs. Favored areas are at the mouth of the Parrita; Palo Seco; Damas; off the mouth of the Naranjo; around the points at Dominical and 
throughout the Drake Bay area. Best fishing is during the summer months. Snook are found off the river mouths all along the central coast, up the Sierpe river and in 
the big lagoon on the Sierpe. Best months are from July through November. <font color="#008040"><strong>F</strong></font> = Fair -- <font color="#0000FF"><strong>G</strong></font> = Good -- <font color="#FF0000"><strong>E</strong></font> = Excellent</p>

<p>Marlin peak from August through December. Sailfish are found in limited numbers every month, but peak from December through March, slowing from April into 
early June, then picking up again to a peak in August and September. Tuna fishing for the bigger fish corresponds with marlin and sailfish season, but small fish can 
almost always be found. Dorado season is from late May through October. Wahoo are not plentiful, but will be occasionally found. Roosterfish run really big, and 
they can be caught throughout the year. Snook are caught all year, with best months from middle or late May through July and in January and February. Tides are 
more important than the season, and best fishing is generally from a very high tide as it drops. . <font color="#008040"><strong>F</strong></font> = Fair -- <font color="#0000FF"><strong>G</strong></font> = Good -- <font color="#FF0000"><strong>E</strong></font> = Excellent</p>

<hr>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=25%><img src="images/cos_fi7.jpeg" align=bottom width=256 height=126></td><td width=50%>Costa Rica has long been recognized for its world-class saltwater fishing in two oceans, the freshwater sport 
available in its lakes and hundreds of miles of fishable rivers also offers a challenge for visiting sportsmen. 
According to William Bussing, an ichthyologist and professor of biology at the University of Costa Rica, there 
are 127 species of freshwater fish in 33 different families found in Costa Rica inland waters. While the 
majority are better known to the tropical fish collector than to the sportsman, many provide outstanding sport 
and fine eating. More than a dozen rivers abound with rainbow trout that average about 11 inches and 
frequently hit the three to four pound mark, while lower elevation rivers and lakes provide action on such 
exotic species as the rainbow bass (guapote), mojarra, machaca, bobo, vieja and others. </td></tr>
</table>
<p>Lake Arenal, in the San Carlos Valley about a three hour drive from San Jose via good highway, is famous for its rainbow bass, a member of the cichlid family that 
is fished just as you would for large mouth bass, Gleaming in iridescent turquoise, splashed in delicate shadings of rose and purple with feathered ends to its caudal 
and dorsal fins and a distinctive hump on the head of the mature male, the rainbow bass or guepote frequently run five to eight pounds. with an 11 &#189; pounder 
holding the world record. Located at the base of a highly active volcano surrounded by tropical jungle rich in wildlife, the beautiful 1 5-mile-long lake has two 
fishing lodges that offer overnight accommodations, guides and boat rentals. Rainbow bass and other exotic species are also found near the mouths of the rivers 
feeding the Caribbean coast providing diversion for anglers out of that area's tarpon and snook lodges. Fishing in the rivers will vary with the seasons, and most of 
the spots are difficult to find and hard to get to for those unfamiliar with the area, even though some of the most popular areas are within a 1 &#189; to 3 hour drive from 
the capital city. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="tac">FISHING TACKLE</a></h3>
<p>Recommended tackle for visitors planning to sample the rainbow bass fishing is a light to medium action bass rod and good selection of bass plugs, including deep 
runners like the Rapala for trolling, shallow running rattlers, surface poppers and spinner baits. Spinning rods are fine for the trout, with a selection of small spinners 
and cheese hooks. If fly fishing, bring a short rod as the tropical growth along the rivers makes it difficult to cast a longer stick. A little heavier spinning outfit and 
large Mepps spinners are ideal for bobo, a member of the mullet family that runs up the rivers feeding to the east coast, most often found in fast water. You will fish 
them much as you would for steelhead, and if the spinners don't work, 1TY a chunk of banana on a hook. Planning a Costa Rica fishing vacation? Remember, this 
is a tropical country but also gets a lot of rain certain months of the year, so plan accordingly. Be sure to bring a good sunscreen, sunglasses, cap with a bill, insect 
repellent, lightweight poncho or rain suit. Provide a change of shoes in case you get caught in the rain. Shorts are the preferred garb of most anglers, but if especially 
susceptible to the sun pack some light cotton trousers and long sleeved shirt. NOTE: The seasons specified in the charts are based on catch reports compiled over 
recent years, but like anyplace in the world, fishing in Costa Rica is subject to change, depending on wind and weather conditions, water temperatures, rainfall, 
moon phases and other factors that may vary substantially from year to year. Remember that a valid Costa Rican fishing license is required for freshwater. To 
obtain a license for 60 days, non-residents including tourists can deposit $30 at any national bank and obtain an &quot;entero&quot; showing that the amount has been paid. 
Take the entero, a passport photo and your passport to the Departamento de Control Silvestre, where the license will be issued. </p>

<p>Internal flights within Costa Rica are available with regular companies (SANSA and TRAVELAIR) but, especially in the high season, can be a hassle as planes are 
small and sell out fast. Sansa may cancel a flight or two and may sell your seat even though you have a pauid ticket. Travelair may, besides that, may change plane 
and not have enough space to carry all ticketed passengers (and you are not going to be re-protected on any other flight) Also extra luggage charges seem to have 
become quite lucrative as luggage weight is enforced, &quot;for flight security reason&quot; they say, while it is stored aboard immediately if you pay the hefty supplements! 
<font color="#FF0000"><font size=4><em><strong>The cost of your flight ticket will be included in your itinerary if flying is necessary within the country.</strong></em></font></font></p>

<h2 align=left><a name="gen">GENERAL INFORMATION</a>&#160;</h2>
<p align=left>Located on the narrow isthmus that links the Americas, Panama is endowed with a rich biological diversity. With an area of 78,200 sq. km [roughly equivalent to 
South Carolina], Panama boasts more plant species than all of the U.S. and Canada combined. Almost a thousand different species of Panamanian birds have been 
reported. Naturalists have been attracted to Panama because of the combination of natural splendor and relative ease of access. The isthmus of Panama is the 
umbilical cord joining South and Central America. At its narrowest point, it is only 50 km wide, the famous canal is 80 km long and effectively divides the country 
into eastern and western regions. Tropical rainforests dominate the canal zone, the eastern half of the country and the Darien Gap. The highlands have alpine 
vegetation and mountain forests; the west coast is predominantly grassland. There are 1600 islands near the Panamanian coast. The two major archipelagos are the 
San Blas and Bocas del Toro chains on the Caribbean coast, but most of the islands are in the Pacific. Panama has two season. The dry season lasts from January 
to mid-April and the rainy season from mid-April to December</p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="pan">Panama City</a></h3>
<p align=left>Panama is a modern, thriving commercial center stretching 10 km along the Pacific coast from the ruins of Panam&aacute; Viejo the ruins of the first city built by the 
Spaniards in the east, to the edge of the Panama Canal and Parque Natural Metropolitano, a wild tropical forest on a hill behind the city center with monkeys, deer, 
sloths, iguanas and 200 species of birds in the west. A short trip from downtown Panama City can take you to remarkably pristine wilderness, where animals that 
are considered endangered throughout most of the tropics are fairly easy to see, and the bird watching is as good as anywhere on the planet. Protected within a 
series contiguous national parks to the north of the city is a vast expanse of nearly virgin tropical rainforest, which was part of the former US Canal Zone until the 
signing of the Panama Canal Treaties. Long protected from loggers and hunters, that wilderness is home to a wealth of flora and fauna, including such hard-to-see 
animals as collared peccaries, crocodiles and tapirs. The old district of San Felipe (Casco Viejo) is on the south-western side of town, it's an area of decaying 
colonial grandeur, striking architecture, peeling paint and decrepit balconies. Panama City is one of the great shopping cities of the Americas and many visitors, 
especially the hordes who arrive from other Central and South American countries just before Christmas, spend their whole time there wandering the extensive 
shopping precincts.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="can">Panama Canal</a></h3>
<p align=left>The Canal is both an engineering marvel and one of the most significant waterways on earth. Stretching 80 km from Panama City on the Pacific coast of Col&oacute;n on 
the Atlantic side, it provides passage for over 12,000 ships per year. Commercial ships pay an average of US$30,000 to navigate the passage, bringing millions of 
dollars of foreign currency into the local economy. The best way to visit the Canal is to go to the Miraflores Locks, on the north-eastern fringe of Panama City, 
where a platform offers visitors a good view of the locks in operation. There's also a museum with a model and a film about the Canal. Boats leave Balboa, a 
western suburb of Panama City, for a five-hour tour through the locks to Miraflores Lake.</p>
<h4 align=left>History and Construction</h4>
<p align=left>Already at the time of the Conquistadores, after realizing the riches of Peru, Ecuador, and Asia, and counting the long time it took the gold to reach the Courts of 
Spain, it was suggested to Charles V, that by cutting out a piece of land somewhere in Panama, the trips will be shorter and the risk of taking the treasures through 
the isthmus would justify the enterprise. Here we have to remember the strong influence of the Catholic Church in he Courts of Spain: &quot; What was joined by God, 
no man should attempt to separate&quot;. A very long time passed and Ferdinand de Lesseps dreamt of extending his feat at Suez to the American Continent. The link of 
Africa and Asia had been severed, why not so with the Americas?. But Panama was not Egypt: over there the lowlands were arid and dry, and solitary swamps 
dotted the scenario. In Panama the story was the opposite! There was a big river, yes., but the jungle was filled with diseases and all difficulties were 
underestimated. After a decade the only result was a ditch about 4 km inland to the west of Colon City. Then the U.S. seized the opportunity, ideologically 
supported by the Monroe doctrine dictating the limitation of European influence in the American continent. A Treaty was proposed between Colombia and the 
U.S. as the territory of the isthmus of Panama had been under the control of Colombia since 1822. But only two ships were dispatched with 3 Marine battalion, the 
U.S. military landed in Panama to stay. Colombia reluctantly backed off and did not recognize Panama until 1921. Fifteen days later, on November 18 1903 the 
Panama Canal Treaty was signed between Hay and Buneau-Varilla without a Panamanian stamping their signature on it: Varilla was the solely representative of 
Panama in the plot. Later President Theodore Roosvelt announced in his State of the Union address to Congress proudly he had taken Panama. The treaty and the 
project were quickly approved. The construction started almost inmediately. </p>

<h3 align=left><a name="isl">Archipi&eacute;lago de San Blas </a></h3>
<p align=left>The islands of the San Blas Archipi&eacute;lago are strung out along the Caribbean coast of Panama nearly all the way to the Colombian border. The islands are home to 
the Cuna Indians, who run the 378 islands as an autonomous province, with minimal interference from the national government, in effect the most sophisticated, 
independent and politically organized of Panama's three main indigenous groups. They maintain their own economic system, language, customs, and culture, with 
distinctive dress (decorated with molas, intricately stitched appliqued textiles), legends, music and dance. The economy of the islands is based around coconuts and 
fishing, but also they also offer travelers good diving, snorkeling and swimming; the best diving conditions are between April and June. Several planes make the 
30-minute flight from Paitilla airport in Panama City to El Porvenir.</p>
<h3 align=left>Archipi&eacute;lago de Bocas del Toro</h3>
<p align=left>Several of the pristine islands of the Bocas del Toro Archipi&eacute;lago in the Caribbean Sea are protected by the marine Parque Nacional Bastimentos. The park offers 
great diving, snorkeling and swimming and its beaches are used as a nesting ground by carey, canal and green turtles. The main town on the archipelago is Bocas 
Del Toro on the south-eastern tip of Isla Col&oacute;n.</p>
<h3 align=left>Taboga Island</h3>
<p align=left>Taboga is a picturesque fishermen's village offering a lovely and comfortable environment of sand and sun. This small peaceful island, 20 km south of Panama City, 
has a good beach, snorkeling, an attractive village, a pelican colony and few thoroughfares bigger than a footpath. Known as the Island of Flowers, because at 
certain times of the year it is filled with the aroma of sweet-smelling blooms, the island is a favorite retreat from the city. The ships take about 1 hr to reach the 
island. . You can rent a beach umbrella (or take your own) and enjoy the white sandy beach </p>
<h3 align=left>Contadora Island Resort</h3>
<p align=left>From Paitilla Airport you can fly to Contadora in 15 minutes. Contadora Island lies nestled snugly within a chain of islands knows as the Pearl Archipielago, gently 
lapped by warm Pacific waters. It is famous and fabulous with its resort and casino boasting 13 beaches that are pure white sand, swimming pool, lighted tennis 
courts, snorkeling, diving, fishing, waterskiing etc.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="dar">Darien</a></h3>
<p align=left>Darien is the largest and least developed area of Panama, a huge densely forested barrier separating Central and South America and one of the world's premier 
destinations for the ecotourist adventurer. It is a land where the rivers are roads, where the official color is green, where the indigenous are happy and proud to 
welcome visitors and where nature's abundance and exuberance knows no bounds. The region's most important indigenous group is the Choco Indians, comprised 
of the culturally distinct Embera and Wounaan. Their links with the Indians of South America remain apparent, both in their physical appearance and cultural 
traditions like the use of decorative pigments, loincloths, blowguns with poison darts and particular housing materials. Ecologically, Darien is one of the richest 
regions on Earth. It is here that South American animals and plants are found at the extreme north of their range, living in proximity with North and Central 
American wildlife at the southernmost part of its range </p>
<h3 align=left>Boquete</h3>
<p align=left>Known for its cool, fresh climate and pristine natural environment, the small alpine town of Boquete is nestled into a craggy mountain valley 35 km north of David. 
It's a fine place for walking, bird-watching and horse-back riding. Flowers, coffee and citrus fruits are grown in the area and the town's Feria de las Flores y del 
Cafe is a popular annual festival held in mid-April. </p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="gen">GENERAL RULES</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>With regard to film, no matter what kind of equipment you use, we strongly recommend that you buy all your film before you leave. It is expensive in Africa, 
approximately $12 per roll. </li>
<li>If you own a pair of binoculars, by all means bring them. </li>
<li>When photographing Africans, remember that dark skins reflect very little light, so do open the aperture by at least on stop. </li>
<li>The advice of your driver should be sought before photographing local people. While some Masai eagerly pose for shots, others believe that their souls will 
be stolen if their pictures are taken. And it is also against the law to take pictures of the Masai. </li>
<li>Frequent stops are made for close-up shots of animals and birds. Camera supports are unnecessary since picture taking is done from inside the safari buses. 
However, a <strong>bean bag</strong> is useful to steady the lens. </li>
<li>The sunroofs in the mini-buses will enable you to stand for shots, and the lighting at the game lodges is perfect for evening photography. </li>
<li>Your camera when not in use should be protected by a dust-proof bag. </li>
</ul>
<h3>The following list will be helpful: </h3>
<ul>
<li>Minimum of 12 to 15 rolls of film</li>
<li>2 lenses (50 mm and zoom)</li>
<li>lens tissue</li>
<li>dust-off</li>
<li>extra batteries</li>
<li>film type 30% fast (400); 70% asa 64/100</li>
<li>camera bag and skylight filter</li>
<li>A polarized filter can be helpful to the experienced photographer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Know Your Equipment</h2>
<p>The first rule is <strong>NEVER</strong> to go on safari with camera equipment that is new to you. If you feel like borrowing a camera or investing in some new paraphernalia 
before setting out, by all means do so, but obtain it several weeks before you leave, become thoroughly familiar with it, and shoot several test rolls of film. </p>
<p>The cost will be very low compared to the value to you of your safari pictures. Allow time to have the film developed and to have any faults in the equipment 
rectified before you set out. This may take weeks, so plan ahead.</p>
<p>Be completely comfortable with everything you take. All too often I have seen people wrestling with cameras and lenses that were too big, too heavy or too 
complicated, and as a result losing good pictures. </p>
<p>It is much better to have equipment that can be used readily than to spend a lot of money for apparatus whose operation you can&#146;t understand. Bring along 
everything you need, and don&#146;t count on being able to rent or replace any items in East Africa.</p>
<h2>What Type of Camera</h2>
<p>Far and away the most appropriate and flexible kind of camera for safari photography is the 35mm single lens reflex. It is hand-holdable, accepts different lenses 
and displays in the viewfinder an image close to what the final print or slide will look like. </p>
<p>The camera should have a built-in light meter for easy exposure setting. Many of the newer models offer automatic exposure, which is controversial; many pros 
prefer to make all adjustments manually. However, you will be able to expose about 80 percent or more of your pictures with the camera set on automatic, and that 
often saves valuable time when trying to get a picture in a hurry</p>
<h2>Video Equipment</h2>
<p>A safari is a very &quot;photogenic&quot; experience, and if you carry a video recorder, you are sure to be well rewarded. </p>
<p>Bring equipment as light in weight as possible.The only problem arises with battery power. Most minibuses have cigarette lighters that, with the appropriate adapter, 
may be used for operating your camera. However, it is possible that several people may want to use the lighter simultaneously! </p>
<p>It may not always be possible to recharge batteries at the game lodges. Where possible, you will need an adapter for 220-240 volt current, along with converters 
for two-pin round and three-pin square plugs. </p>
<p>Perhaps the best thing possible to bring with you enough fresh batteries to last the entire trip, although that may be a bulky and costly solution.</p>
<h2><a name="tec">Notes on Technique</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><address><font size=3>Being a good wildlife photographer involves a combination of patience and quickness of hand. Wait for the shots you want and be prepared to put 
in plenty of time, sometimes in the hot sun, if you want outstanding pictures. </font></address>
</li>
<li><address><font size=3>Be as ready as possible to shoot. That means presetting your camera as closely as possible to what is the most likely focus and exposure. If your 
camera has automatic exposure, leave it set on automatic unless you are sure that conditions warrant otherwise. Once again, it is vital that you be 
thoroughly familiar with your camera so that you don&#146;t have to fumble with it at the critical moment. </font></address>
</li>
<li><address><font size=3>Be generous in your use of film. If you see something that is especially worth photographing, take several pictures. Try several different exposures 
because too often, film comes back scratched or spoiled in some way. Or you may send your film in to have prints made and gave it either lost or 
damaged. If this should happen, you will then always have another copy.</font> </address>
</li>
<li><address><font size=3>When using telephoto lenses, try as hard as possible to minimize camera vibration. Make sure your driver switches off the engine of your vehicle. 
Prop the camera up on a window ledge or on the roof, using if possible a bean bag, and use fast shutter speeds. Practice releasing the shutter 
without jarring the camera. The classic rule of thumb is that you should not try to hand-hold a camera at a shutter speed slower than the inverse 
of the focal length of your lens. Translated into English, that means that if you are using a lens of 200mm, you should use a shutter speed of 1/20, 
1/500 or faster. If you are using a 50mm lens, you can manage with a shutter speed of 1/60, 1/125 or faster.</font> </address>
</li>
<li><address><font size=3>Be aware of the angle from which the sunlight is coming. Most of your shots will look best if the sun is behind you and your camera, and the 
subject directly illuminated. Your driver will be aware of this and try to position the vehicle at the best possible angle. But you may want to try for 
unusual effects such as backlighting: if you do, make sure you know how to set your camera&#146;s exposure meter so that it isn&#146;t fooled by the 
extraneous light in the background.</font> </address>
</li>
<li><address><font size=3>Even though you will make frequent use of the roof hatch of your vehicle, don&#146;t neglect the view from the windows. A lower angle of view may 
allow a more dramatic view of, for example, a large animal like a giraffe or elephant.</font> </address>
</li>
<li><address><font size=3>The knack of photographic composition is to some extent unteachable, but before you leave on safari you might want to study some books of 
wildlife photography to see what makes for good pictures. One thing the great photographers have in common is a feel for the context in which 
animals occur. They often include in the frame something of the landscape and background.</font> </address>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Useful Devices</h2>
<p>If you are serious about your photography or would be heartbroken if you were to miss out on any photo opportunities, you might want to consider bringing a 
second camera, preferably of the same model as your first one, or at least accepting the same lenses. It is most unlikely that you would be able to have any major 
camera repair done quickly while you are on safari. </p>
<p>Another advantage of a second camera is being able to keep a second type of film and another lens ready for use at all times. A jeweler&#146;s screwdriver is very 
handy for performing minor repairs along the way!</p>
<h2><a name="lens">Lenses</a></h2>
<h3>A telephoto lens is a necessity for wildlife photography. </h3>
<p>The newer telephoto zoom lenses are virtually as good in quality as fixed focal length lenses, and we recommend them highly for their flexibility. It is possible to get 
so close to animals such as lions that a fixed lens of 200mm is actually too long: with the zoom you simply adjust the lens. The appropriate focal length for a 
telephoto zoom is in the range of approximately 80-200mm. </p>
<p>A super-long telephoto lens of 400mm or more is not necessary, unless you are a very experienced photographer with a keen interest in photographing birds. </p>
<p>Long lenses are unwieldy, hard to focus, and call for a steady and experienced hand. </p>
<p>Protect your lenses by putting a filter over each one. A 1A Skylight or UV filter does not cut down the light and is useful in screening out haze. And if anything 
should hit the lens, you would certainly prefer to damage a $10 filter than an expensive lens. </p>
<p>Simply leave a filter permanently attached to each of you lenses. You will probably not need any other filters except, if you are so inclined, for a polarizing filter to 
make clouds stand out vividly. </p>
<p>It is essential to put shades on your lenses, since glare can all too easily ruin your pictures and you are so close the the Equator. This is particularly true for telephoto 
lenses; some of the longer ones come with built-in hoods. </p>
<p><strong>KEEP YOUR CAMERA AND LENSES CLEAN!</strong> </p>
<p>Fingerprints or dust on your lens can effectively spoil your shots. Bring a blower brush, lens cleaning fluid and lens tissue. </p>
<p>Sprays such as &quot;Dust Off&quot; are very handy and take up very little space (but be sure not to use them on the mirror of your camera). </p>
<p>&quot;Q-tips&quot; are useful in cleaning in the nooks and crannies. </p>
<p>Check your equipment frequently to be sure it is clean. It is painful to see someone who has spent a small fortune on equipment taking pictures through smudged 
lenses </p>
<h3>Flash</h3>
<p>A compact electronic flash is a necessity for taking pictures at your lodge or camp at night, or indoors. </p>
<p>Although Treetops, The Ark and Mountain Lodge frown on the use of flash, it is sometimes permissible if the animals in question have been at the water hole for a 
while and every one has had a good look. </p>
<p>The newer electronic flashes operate automatically, but you should in any case fully understand how to use your flash before you leave. </p>
<h3>X-Rays</h3>
<p>Much has been written about whether airport X-ray machines damage film. The latest evidence is that some do; at any rate the effect is cumulative, and if your films 
pass through several machines you may find them fogged. </p>
<p>Invest in a lead-lined &quot;Film Shield&quot; bag, and always ask customs inspectors to check your camera equipment by hand. Many will cooperate in doing so.</p>
<p>It is absolutely essential that your cameras be protected from vibration and dust. We strongly recommend a foam-lined camera bag on the floor of a moving vehicle; 
the vibration may loosen screws or otherwise cause damage. </p>
<p>Leave your cameras on a vacant seat or carry them on your lap. And bring a supply of plastic bags and rubber bands to keep dust off. </p>
<h2>Useful suggestions </h2>
<ol>
<li>Always check that you reset your ASA setting to the specifications of the film you are using</li>
<li>Rest your camera in a position that provides a firm base when taking a picture (a bean-bag is very useful here)</li>
<li>Pictures taken from the roof-hatch, even if beautiful, may not make as much of an imposing portrait as the picture taken at eye level from a window</li>
<li>Be sure you know how to operate your camera and are familiar with all aspects of it</li>
<li>Compose your picture taking into consideration the background </li>
<li>Please take time <strong>BEFORE YOU DEPART,</strong> to learn about shutter speed and depth of focus in order to take the best possible shots under any 
circumstances</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="eti">Photography Etiquette</a></h3>
<p>Always ask permission before taking photos of other people and always be considerate of anyone's wish not to be photographed. </p>
<p>Under no circumstances take pictures of airports, government buildings and installations or of military compounds and personnel. Taking photos where permission 
is not granted can result, at best, in confiscation of your film. </p>
<p>Please be also conscious that you will be with other people, as eager as you are to take the greatest photo of their life. Share the best views with other fellow 
passengers and do not disturb their pleasure by making unnecessary noises, creating a commotion, or impeding their view and picture taking. </p>
<p>Do not stand up suddenly in the vehicle as this may cause a subject to take flight before anyone has the time to photograph it</p>

<hr>
<p>The Archeological capital of the Americas sublimely combines the Inca legacy with Spanish colonial architecture. History puts Manco Capac founding the city of 
Cusco around 1,100 AD Legend says that in the beginning the land was in darkness and the great Lord Sun took pity on these wretched creatures and sent to 
earth his own son, Manco-Capac' to spread civilization and! enlightenment&quot;. The goddess Moon sent her daughter Mama OcIlo to be his bride. They appeared on 
earth emerging from the waters of Lake Titicaca. Manco Capac and Mama OcIlo began a long odyssey searching for the place where to found their kingdom. At 
length they came to a fertile valley where Manco Capac repeating the test assigned by the Sun plunged his golden staff into the ground, this time it sank deep into 
the soil and disappeared, where they found their capital and called it Cusco &quot;navel of earth&quot;.</p>
<hr>
<h3>ALTITUDE</h3>
<p>The city of Cusco is at 11,150 feet above sea level. In order to speed acclimatization rest for a couple of hours after your arrival by plane from Lima. Avoid 
alcoholic beverages and eat lightly the first day.</p>
<h3>CLIMATE</h3>
<p>April to September (winter) is usually sunny and dry with temperatures varying from freezing at night to comfortable during the day as long as you do not stay on 
the shade. January to March is the rainy season, January and February are the wettest, with comfortable temperatures (during the day and slightly cool at night.) </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="cusco">WHAT TO SEE</a></h3>
<p>The best place to start exploring Cusco is perhaps the Plaza de Armas (Main Square), the center of solemn parades and great assemblies since Inca times. </p>
<p><strong>The Cathedral</strong>, built on the place where once stood the palace of Inca Viracocha, mixes Spanish Renaissance architecture with beautiful stone-work. Its 
construction began in 1,580 and took approximately one century to complete. Among its many treasures are nearly 400 colonial paintings, including those of the 
&quot;School of Cusco&quot; a very particular style developed by the blending of Inca and Spanish cultures. The single piece of the main altar is completely covered with 
silver plates. Of the many side altars, a very popular among cusquenos is that of the Lord of Earthquakes, blackened by the innumerable votive candles lit over the 
centuries. Two other churches are attached to the Cathedral, Jesus Maria, to the left, and El Triunfo, the oldest in Cusco dating back to 1536. </p>
<p><strong>La Compania Church</strong>, also in the Plaza de Armas, built in 1571 by the Jesuits at the time of the foundation of Inca Wayna Capac's palace (the last ruler of the 
unconquered empire). The church was destroyed by the 1650 earthquake, beginning immediately a magnificent reconstruction, resulting in the most ornate and 
splendid church in Cusco.</p>
<p><strong>Museum of Religious Art</strong>, displays a fine collection of colonial artifacts and paintings of the 'School! of Cusco&quot; . The building was constructed on the site of Inca 
Roca's palace. Just outside is the Twelve Angled Stone, an example of Inca architecture advancement that continues to amaze the world, the twelve corner angles 
fit perfectly all surrounding blocks. The stones were positioned without the use of mortar and have withstood centuries and earthquakes.</p>
<p><strong>Santo Domingo Church and Convent</strong>, the most remarkable characteristic of this building is that it was built using some of the Inca walls of the fabulous 
Koricancha &quot;temple of the supreme God Sun&quot; that colonial chronicles described as having the inner walls covered with gold plates to reflect the sun's rays entering 
through windows specially positioned for that purpose.</p>
<p><strong>San Blas Church</strong>, a small adobe building that holds a carving masterpiece, the renowned pulpit of San Blas, work of Indian craftsmen on a massive single piece of 
wood which is said to be the finest woodcarving piece in the world. Around the church are the houses of the most popular families of handicrafters of Cusco. Visit 
the Mendivil and the Olave family</p>
<p><strong>La Merced Church and Convent</strong>, dating back to the 17th Century. It has a small museum with the best colonial paintings in Cusco, a variety of lavish religious 
objects including the four feet high gold monstrance, covered with precious stones and two large pearls in the shape of a mermaid. Also within the city the colonial 
churches of San Francisco, Santa Catalina, Santa Clara, San Pedro, Santa Teresa, and San Antonio Abad and the beautiful colonial houses of &quot;La Casa de los 
Cuatro Bustos&quot;, ''The Admiral's Palace&quot;, &quot;House of Marquis of Valleumbroso&quot;, among others. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="around">PLACES TO SEE OUTSIDE THE CITY</a></h3>
<p>The entire area of Cusco bears an exceptional wealth of Inca constructions being the most interesting and accessible those lying north of city. Here stands the 
massive-fortress of <strong>Sacsayhuaman</strong>, only 4 Km from downtown Cuzco. Made of large boulders including one weighing 125 tons ranged in a zig-zag shape in three 
platforms which presently serves as the great scenario for the legendary Inti Raymi Festival. (Festival of the Sun) held every year on June 24. Following the road 
leading to the northeast you arrive to <strong>Quenco</strong> (zig-zag) another great example of skillful Inca masonry work consisting of a large limestone covered with carvings, 
thought to have been used for ritual sacrifices. A mysterious cave with large niches, and an amphitheater facing north with 19 niches are part of the complex. 
<strong>Tambo Machay</strong> consisting of a beautiful ceremonial bath, popularly called &quot;bath of the Inka&quot;, formed by four leveled walls linked by stairs and adorned with 
crystalline waterfalls. <strong>Puca Pucara</strong> meaning red fort - in some lights the rocks look red - this tambo post-house served to lodge travelers and store goods.</p>

<h3><a name="valley">THE SACRED VALLEY</a></h3>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=30%><p align=center><img src="images/per_sava.jpeg" align=bottom width=295 height=185></p>
</td><td width=50%>The Vilcanota / Urubamba river valley is a beautiful place to visit, start at Pisac, just 30 Km. from 
Cusco. A unique typical Andean town which on Sundays is filled with locals in their colorful traditional 
costumes, trading goods after a traditional mass and procession. This market is also open on 
Thursdays. On the hilltop is located the archeological complex, a strategic Inka stronghold with fine 
stone work and superb views of agricultural terraces and the valley.<p><strong>Yucay</strong>, 48 Km. from Cusco, a very picturesque village with some fine Inca masonry in one of the 
squares. Behind the village to the north you will find the finest surviving Inca agricultural system in the 
Cusco region which is still in use.</p>
<p><strong>Urubamba</strong>, 78 Km. from Cusco, is an attractive town that lies in the center of the valley and can be 
used as a base to explore the Sacred Valley.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p><strong>Chinchero</strong>, 28 Km. from Cusco, the town's unusual architecture is the result of Spanish-Inca fusion. The small church built in the late 16th century, houses several 
colonial paintings; and the colorful Sunday market is said to be the most authentic in the region. The Inca ruins consist of terracing and a massive Inca wall at the 
main square with ten large trapezoids niches.</p>
<p><strong>Ollantaylambo</strong>, 97 Km. from Cusco, located at one end of the Sacred Valley. The town has preserved the actual Inca layout, the fortress was constructed as 
another strategic outpost for defensive purpose as well as a religious center. The enormous steps terraces protecting the fortress are spectacular, the bastion's walls 
were built with huge blocks of granite skillfully carved and were the site of a major battle during Manco Capac's Inca rebellion against the conquistadors.</p>
<p>The Cusco area has many other archeological and colonial sites besides those mentioned before: <strong>Andahuaylillas, Maras, Moray, Oropesa, San Jeronimo, 
Piquillacta, Limatambo, Calca</strong>, are some that are worth a visit</p>

<hr>
<p>The Legendary <strong>&quot;Lost City of Machu Picchu&quot; </strong>is without a doubt the most important tourist attraction in Peru and one of the world's most impressive 
archaeological sites. Built by the Incas on the summit of &quot;Machu Picchu&quot; (Old Peak), overlooking the deep canyon of the Urubamba river in a semi-tropical area 
120 Km. (75 miles) from the city of Cusco at 7,000 feet above sea level. </p>
<p>The whole archaeological complex covers approximately 5 square kms. As it is situated in the high jungle, its climate is semi-tropical, warm and humid. It is open 
every day from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm. There are two routes leading to Machu Picchu: by rail, the most rapid and comfortable, following the course of the Urubamba 
River and on foot, following the traditional and true route of entry, best known as the Inka Trail. A minimum of one whole day is needed to visit these ruins and 
upon arrival there, one should have approximately 2 hours to go over the main part and have lunch at the hotel on your return, before taking the mini-bus anew 
down to the Puente Ruinas Station (2.30 pm). The traveler who has more time to spare may stay overnight at the Machu Picchu Ruinas Hotel </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="citadel">The Citadel</a></h3>
<p>Machu Picchu is also one of the Inca's best kept secrets, since they did not left written records and Spanish chronicles make no mention of the citadel, it remains a 
mystery. Discovered only in 1911 by the American Yale professor Hiram Bingham. The building style is &quot;late imperial Inca&quot; thought to have been a sanctuary or 
temple inhabited by high priests and the &quot;Virgins of the Sun&quot; (chosen women). Excavations revealed that of the 135 skeletons found,109 were women. No signs of 
post Conquest occupation were unearthed.</p>
<p>The original entrance to the complex is on the southwestern side of the citadel at the end of the Inca Trail, a short walk away from &quot;Intipunko &quot; (Sun Gate), the 
ancient final check point to Machu Picchu. The present entrance on the southeastern side leads to the agricultural section. The complex can be divided in three 
distinct sections: Agricultural, Urban, and Religious. The agricultural area consists of a series of terraces and irrigation channels that serve dual purpose, as 
cultivation platforms making it self sustained, and as retention walls to avoid erosion. Some smaller buildings next to large terraces are part of this section and 
thought to have served as lookout posts. </p>
<p>The urban section starts at the wall that separates it from the agricultural area, this group of buildings were constructed on the ridge that descends abruptly to the 
Urubamba valley. In the southern part of this section are found a series of niches carved on rock known as &quot;the jail&quot; with elements that include man size niches, 
stone rings would have served to hold the prisoner's arms, and underground dungeons.</p>
<p>The group of refined structures next to &quot;the jail&quot; is known as the &quot;intellectuals' quarters&quot;, with tall walls, nooks, and windows built with reddish stone are considered 
to have been accommodations for the Amautas (high ranked teachers). One of the buildings has several circular holes carved on the rock floor named the &quot;mortar 
room&quot; believed to have been used for preparation of dyes. The largest urban section in Machu Picchu located on the north western part, is reached by a 67 steps 
staircase and involves a group of buildings not as finely constructed as other parts of the complex. </p>
<p>The central plaza that separates the religious from the urban section, has a great rock in the center. The religious section contains splendid architecture an masonry 
work, one of the most important and enigmatic is probably the Intihuatana shrine, this block of granite was presumably used to make astronomical observations. 
Descending the hill next to this site is the Great Central Temple, a three walled building with fine stonework and an attached smaller temple called the &quot;Sacristy&quot;. 
Next to this structure is another three walled building, known as the Temple of the Three Windows, so called because of the trapezoidal openings on the east wall. 
Directly across is the Royal sector, with ample buildings typical of Inca royalty. A very important structure in this section is the &quot;Temple of the Sun&quot;, a: circular 
tower with the best stonework of Machu Picchu. Its base forms a cavern known as the Royal Tomb. Recent studies show that the actual purpose was for 
astronomical observance. </p>
<p>Huayna Picchu, young peak, is as much a part of the site as the buildings of the citadel, the towering granite peak overlooks Machu Picchu to the North with a 
steep well preserved original Inca path, well worth the one hour climb for an astounding view of the citadel and the entire valley. The Temple of the Moon, located 
halfway down in an underground chamber on the north side of the Huayna Picchu, is a fairly recent discovery. The access to this site is rather difficult and diverges 
left from the main trail. It contains finely carved structures on large boulders. The climb to the top takes about three hours.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="people">The city and its people</a></h3>
<p>Only from the nearby hilltop observatory of Intipunku can the visitor realize the full extent of Machu Picchu's colossal conception. The citadel is a stupendous 
achievement- in urban planning, civil engineering, architecture and stonemasonry. Who built this symphony in stone, this vast complex of buildings so well 
constructed that even five centuries in the inexorable grip of the Peruvian jungle has deprived them only of their thatch and reed roofs? The architectural forms are 
unmistakably characteristic of the Incas but beyond that its origins are veiled in a mystery as thick as the early morning mist swirling around its craggy fastness. At 
any moment, it seems, a gold-encrusted and befeathered Inca warrior will materialize between the curiously sloping door jambs.The enigmatic Incas knew neither 
the wheel nor any written language, but forged an empire stretching 3,680km (2,300mi) along the mighty Andean heights. What is this city of theirs perched in the 
clouds? Machu Picchu was a complex of temples, palaces and observatories and was the home of the Inca ruling classes. From here, high priests made 
observations and calculations enabling them to chart the heavens - a knowledge which gave them both religious authority and temporal power.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="fall">The Fall of Machu Picchu</a></h3>
<p>Hiram Gingham found many objects of stone, bronze, ceramic and obsidian, but no gold or silver. There should have been fabulous riches of these metals 
comparable to those found at the Temple of the Sun in Cuzco where even the garden contained lifesize gold replicas of maize and other plants. It is unlikely the 
Spaniards stole the gold and silver, for it seems they never found Machu Picchu. They always took great pains to visit every inhabited settlement in Peru and record 
it in detail before relieving it of everything worth taking. But there is not a single reference to Machu Picchu in the Spaniards' chronicles. The Peruvian scholar Dr 
Victor Angles Vargas thinks the city became depopulated toward the end of the 15th century before the Spaniards arrived. What brought this about is one of the 
deepest enigmas surrounding this sacred site.</p>
<p>Wars between rival Inca tribes were common and blood, often resulting in the annihilation of whole communities. When the Inca ruler, Wayna Capac, defeated the 
tribe of the Caranques, for example, he ordered the execution of all the remaining members. The citizens of Machu Picchu may well have suffered such a fate. 
Another possibility is that a novice priest defiled one of the sacred Virgins of the Sun. Garcilaso de Vega, the son of a Spaniard and an Inca princess, wrote 
exhaustive commentaries on Inca customs. According to him, anyone found guilty of sexually violating an ajilla was not only put to death himself, but servants, 
relatives and neighbours, inhabitants of the same town and their cattle were all killed. No one was left . . . The place was damned and excommunicated so that no 
one could find it, not even the animals! Was this, then, the fate of the inhabitants of Machu Picchu?</p>
<p>Also epidemics are common enough even in modern times - in the 1940s malaria decimated the population of an area near Machu Picchu. And the skeleton of a 
rich woman found by Hiram Gingham showed she had suffered from syphilis and was unlikely to have been alone in this. Perhaps the city was ravaged by a plague 
so terrible it was permanently quarantined by the authorities.</p>
<hr>
<h4><a name="reach">Reaching </a>Machu Picchu by Train:</h4>
<p>The spectacular journey on the tourist train takes about three hours departing Cusco at 6.00 am. Breakfast is included. A ride on small buses from the train station 
to the site takes approx. 20 min. Departure time from Machu Picchu is at 3.15 pm. In the high season June to August this train makes a shuttle between 
Ollyantaytambo and Machu Picchu. Lunch is available at the self service of the Hotel Machu Picchu Ruinas (ex Turistas).</p>
<h4>Reaching Machu Picchu by Helicopter:</h4>
<p>Helicusco daily flights Dep.09:30am. Arr. 09:55 am. - Return Dep.3:30 pm. Arr. 15.55 pm. Max.Cap.24 pax. </p>

</td><td width=50%>To follow the Inca&#146;s footsteps on the Inca Trail the royal highway to Machu Picchu- is an 
unforgettable experience, few other hikes in the world can offer the variety of breathtaking scenery, 
from high sierra to tropical jungle, undoubtedly no other will take you through so many well preserved 
archeological sites.<p>The 27 mile Inca Trail begins at a point known as Kilometer 88. Here the local train from Cusco stops 
briefly. After crossing the river the 3 to 5 day walk into the past begins... To the right lies the 
archeological site of Quente (hummingbird). The main trail to the left, gently ascends through a 
eucalyptus grove on easy terrain.</p>
<p>The first camp-site is at Cusichaca valley (bridge of joy). From then on the trail gets steeper and 
unrelenting, take creep breaths and pause to observe the beauty around it. The next campsite is at 
Llulluchupampa (plains of Llullucha, a type of herb) where most hiker elect to end their first day.</p>
</td></tr>

<p>Start up early the next morning to reach the Warmimanusca pass (dead woman), the highest point of the trail at about 4,200 mt. (13.800 ft.) Traces of Inca history 
are evident, ancient steps and a wealth of archeological treasures lie ahead. The trail descends to the Pacamavo (sunrise) river, where there are good camping sites. 
Runrurukay (egg hut) is the first reward, the oval shaped complex has a magnificent view of the Pacamayo valley, believed to have served as a lookout post and 
tampu (travelers lodge built along highways). The trail ascends once more passing between two lakes before reaching the second pass, Runrurukay at 3,998 
mt.(l3.300 ft.) with a superb view. From then on most of the trait is downhill</p>
<p>Following the trail to the left another impressive Inca constructions is found ahead: Sayamarca (dominant town) built at the end of a abrupt ridge with a sweeping 
view of the Acobamba valley (wavy plain) and the Inca trail. From this point the path contours the mountain ridge passing a 20 meter tunnel. After the third pass at 
3600 mts. one encounters the spectacular view of the Urubamba valley and soon after the beautiful site of Phuyupatamarca (town above the clouds), a restored 
Inca construction holding several ceremonial baths. Just ahead there is a camp site with the most impressive view on the entire trail.</p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=50%>The next major site along the trail is Winay Wayna (forever young) reached via an incredible 2 mt. wide granite 
staircase, cut into solid bedrock straight down into the high jungle. The archeological area along with this section of 
the trail are recent discoveries. Winay Wayna is about 5 minutes walk south of the trail, built on a steep slope 
surrounded by agricultural terraces. A large circular building overlooks a set of ten ceremonial baths, a small square 
marked by two buildings, and an amazing platform that ends in a 200 mt. cliff. From Winay Wayna the trail crosses 
open mountainside and then enters dense cliff-hanging cloud forest to finally pass through &quot;Intipunku (Sun Gate), the 
royal entrance to the culmination of the journey: Machu Picchu. From this point you get an spectacular view of the 
Huayna Picchu and of the &quot;Lost City of the Incas'.</td><td width=20%><p align=center><img src="images/pe_inkt.jpeg" align=bottom width=211 height=135></p>

<h3>THE LINES</h3>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=25%><img src="images/pe_naz.jpeg" align=bottom width=270 height=320></td><td width=50%>The narrow desert fringe, that stretches for more than 1,400 miles along Peru&#146;s Pacific coast, has been called 
the driest desert on earth. Little oases have formed where small rivers, descending from the slopes of the 
Andes, cross the desert. Here, people have lived for thousands of years. These populated river valleys are 
separated by vast stretches of uninhabited, dry, barren plateau, not far from the foothills of the Andes. One 
such region is situated between &#145;the oasis towns of Nazca and Palpa on the south coast, above the valley of 
the Rio Nazca. Arid? ... Yes. Barren?... No! For here, the ancients of the Nazca culture breathed life into the 
parched wasteland with incredible, indelible artworks created across hundreds of square miles of the desert 
surface! <p>Their desert canvas - called the Pampa Colorada (meaning Red Plain, for the reddish-brown stones that 
characterize its surface) - is a plateau 37 miles long and 15 miles wide. On it, they etched works of 
monumental proportion: a montage of geometric formations called &quot;geoglyphs,&quot; and whimsical portrayals of 
animals, birds, and human forms. Neither carved nor painted, these images represent artistry of another 
medium: By clearing away the dark, rust colored surface stones (accomplished by sweeping, brushing, or 
removing by hand or foot), and exposing the light-colored sub-soil beneath - marvelous patterns were 
created in the contrasting soil.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>We see lines everywhere! &#145;Thousands of crisscrossing, zigzagging, radiating, oscillating, and parallel lines. Lines ranging in widths from six inches to over six feet. 
Some extending as far as six miles. Some continuing, ever-straight and unbroken, over valleys and hills! And like the pages of a mathematician&#146;s notebook 
-trapezoids, triangles, rectangles and quadrangles of all dimension unfold before us: from a yard or two in width, to several hundred yards wide; and in lengths 
stretching from 10 or 15 yards, to over half a mile! Figures of fanciful birds -18 different kinds - create a veritable aviary in the mixed menagerie that prowls the 
pampa. To gain a sense of the enormity of scale -picture a football field: The giant curly-tailed monkey would fill it! </p>
<p>The long, creeping lizard is twice the monkey&#146;s length. And the spider, small by comparison, crawls about, in 150 feet of desert pavement. One of the largest 
creatures, a curious bird with a zig-zag neck, points a &quot;y beak across 600 feet of desertscape! Other figures include a dog, plants, fish... and two piles of rocks in 
the shape of llamas! And on steep hillsides, depiction of human figures keep their eternal vigil over the masterwork on the plain below. How awesome was the task 
of the ancient landscapist! </p>
<p>One can only ponder the formidable effort of removing the numberless tons of stones that delineate the patterns seen through the ages... and the care and skill to 
shape each line and curve with strict precision. So arduous a process would have had to continue through hundreds of years, and would have taken one person, 
working steadily for an entire lifetime, to create the figures alone. The virtues of patience and fortitude must surely have characterized the Nazca people!</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="naz_cul">THE NAZCA CULTURE </a></h3>
<p>Science has linked the work of the Nazca lines to that span in the pre-history of Peru called the &quot;Early Intermediate Period&quot;: the era between 200 B.C. and 600 
A.D., when the Nazca civilization flourished. The culture embraced the river valleys of Chincha, Pisco, Ica, Nazca and Acari on the south coast. The &quot;sand 
painters&quot; of the Nazca plain would have come from these oasis towns to artfully remove the rocks and stones that would create perfect pictures on nature&#146;s 
blackboard. Other artists of the time were the weavers and potters, who - in that era -perfected their crafts to fine arts! Nazca pottery is famous for its vivid colors, 
symbolic motifs, and exotic animal and people-shapes. Mineral-based pigments endowed their colors with a lasting quality. </p>
<p>Superb textiles also exemplify Nazca creativity. Brilliant multicolored designs were woven in tapestry or brocade. Patterns or motifs, borrowed from their pottery, 
were painted on plain cloth. And birds in flight, or anthropomorphic figures resembling those of the ground markings, reappear in vibrant textiles of wool or cotton. 
&quot;Trophy heads&quot; (not for the squeamish!) were frequent art themes, and relate to South American head-hunting practices of the time. </p>
<p>These rituals are presumed to have been associated with warfare, and to have had religious symbolism relating to fertility and reproduction. Music played an 
important role in Nazca civilization, and may have been a component of religious ritual. Their highly decorative instruments consisted of pottery drums, rattles, 
trumpet-shaped horns, and panpipes made of pottery or cane.</p>
<p>Agriculture was at the center of Nazca life, and everything else seemed to flow from it. The Nazca lines themselves may have been built for that purpose, if their use 
was intended for rituals to insure crop fertility... or to align with the stars to predict weather. Even the theory that animals in the geoglyphs were symbols of 
mythological god-protectors, or were linked to water, had an agricultural basis. Life on the desert-oasis meant knowing how to adapt to an unyielding environment, 
and hard work in extracting springs of life from it. </p>
<p>These ancient Peruvians mastered the challenge. Successful at irrigation, they improved their crops, extended cultivated areas, and built terraced pyramids. And 
during this era, they developed and perfected a new art form: Ground art... using the surface of the earth itself to create wonderful works, which, in this special 
environment, would be frozen in time. The markings written on that vast plateau, above the valley of the Rio Nazca, are enduring monuments to the creative 
ingenuity of the ancients who lived in this place at that time.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="naz_mys">THE MYTHS &amp; MYSTERIES OF THE NAZCA LINES</a></h3>
<p>They look like the markings of a prehistoric Einstein, on the biggest &quot;natural blackboard&quot; in the world! What are these doodles on the desert? Is there meaning in 
the maze? Was there a plan... a purpose to that enormous sweep of swirls and spirals and geometric shapes? And what of those Goliath creatures on the Pampa, 
seen only from the air: Why are they there? Is this some ancient puzzle on the Nazca plain? Or but a riddle, written in the sands of time - to be forever studied and 
decoded, deciphered and unraveled? Will it ever be unriddled? </p>
<p>The enigma of the Nazca lines has been called one of the most baffling in all archaeology. Its story is shrouded in myth and mystery. And the questions are endless. 
But clearly, the facts and fantasies surrounding the Nazca phenomenon are almost as fascinating to ponder as the spectacular desert drawings themselves. Who 
created them? When? And for what purpose? Their origins have been probed by historians, geographers, archaeologists, astronomers, mathematicians, 
anthropologists, ethnographers and photographers ever since the markings first came to light over fifty years ago. Thanks to their studies, two of the secrets the 
ones relating to &quot;who&quot; and &quot;when&quot; have been unlocked. </p>
<p>So similar to the animal drawings were the stylized pottery figures found at nearby burial sites, it was clear the two were linked in time to the major period o Nazca 
civilization: 200 B.C. to 600 A.D. Some of the more primitive figures on mountain slopes are attributed to the earlier Paracas culture, dating as far back as 900 
B.C. Mystery: How could markings etched upon the desert some 1500 -2000 years ago remain virtually intact -undisturbed by time and weather? </p>
<p>The geology of the area solves the riddle. Stones (not sand) comprise the desert surface. Rusted by humidity, their darkened color increases heat absorption. The 
resulting cushion of warm surface air acts as a buffer against the wind; while minerals in the soil help to solidify the stones. On the &quot;desert pavement&quot; thus created in 
this dry, rainless environment, erosion is practically nil - making for remarkable preservation of the markings. News of the enigmatic Nazca lines became public 
knowledge in the late 1930s, at about the same time that air travel had begun opening new horizons to people everywhere. </p>
<p>The awesome aerial view that beckoned beyond this particular horizon captured the imagination of writers, scholars and tourists alike. Early passengers called then 
prehistoric landing fields, or compared them to Martian canals. In the 1960s, author Erich von Daniken hypothesized that, in remote times, ancient astronauts visited 
the earth; and that the giant figures on the Nazca plain were meant as signals for the space travelers, as they touched down on the 37-mile-long airfield! </p>
<p>The idea that the incredible drawings were the work of beings from outer space - and could not have been made without aerial instruction - appealed to those who 
couldn&#146;t imagine such creations as products of an ancient civilization. Besides, the extraterrestrials must have made the lines: They were the only ones who could 
view them from their space-ships, on high. Why, indeed, would the Peruvians have drawn shapes of such enormous dimension - when they themselves could never 
see them from the ground? But observers of world cultures had another opinion. </p>
<p>They remind us that the importance of art is in the act of doing, itself, not in the viewing. And that the social act of creating of being brought together for the purpose 
of building wonderful works of art on the landscape was important to the people of the Nazca valley. Not surprisingly, the astronaut theory was never 
substantiated. But a ceramic oddity discovered from the Vicus culture closely resembling a space-suited figure exhibits a striking feature: The face of the figure is 
seen behind a &quot;windowed&quot; helmet... strangely like the astronaut gear we know today. (Myth... or mystery?) </p>
<p>Some of the lesser-known, but nonetheless colorful theories conceived the lines as ancient race tracks... as a map of the Titicaca region... or as places where textile 
weavers could carefully lay out their threads. One experiment attempted to support the belief that the hot air balloon was actually invented by Peruvians, to provide 
the aerial perspective required for construction of the drawings. </p>
<p>The gigantic scale of the drawings was yet another mystery: How did the desert draftsmen have the technology to transfer forms from one scale to another 
sometimes drawing giant shapes or figures, sometimes smaller ones and always perfectly proportioned? Research reveals that just as the early textile weavers 
created their fabulous designs within a grid, so too could the desert artists do the same. Just by increasing the number of counts in the grid, they had the basics with 
which to enlarge their designs proportionately. And as to their precision straight trapezoids and triangles, this could be accomplished with the use of simple devices 
with which very straight lines can be laid out on a surface. </p>
<p>When first discovered , the tracings were thought to be shallow irrigation ditches. Serious study of the phenomenon began in 1939, when anthropologist Paul 
Kosok speculated that the lines could be ancient astronomical sight lines. Mathematician-astronomer Maria Reiche embraced this notion in the early 1940s, and 
may still be seen gathering data on the Pampa documenting the theory that the lines are linked to an ancient calendar and correlate the movements of stars with 
seasonal and weather changes. Such information would have served as a type of weather forecaster for desert farmers, predicting the times to plant and harvest (a 
practice still in use by Andean farmers today). </p>
<p>That the animal and bird-like Pampa creatures represent constellations is another hypothesis of this school of thought. Another piece of the puzzle may be answered 
in the findings of astronomer Anthony Aveni, who sees the lines as pathways made to be walked upon, in a type of ritual, by the farming people who came from 
nearby villages to induce water from its mountain source. Lines radiating in all directions to natural rock outcrops and always leading to water sources may thus 
have been the &quot;sacred&quot; pathways leading to the mountain gods whom they worshipped, and perceived as providers of water. (For ancient fanning folk of one of 
Earth&#146;s driest deserts, the importance of such rituals can be understood.)</p>
<p>The ruins of nearby Cahuachi, a once important city overlooking the Pampa, provide a clue to the nature of the people who came here for these ritual practices. 
Described as a sort of &quot;pre-Columbian Vatican&quot; by archaeologist Helaine Silverman who has studied the former religious capital, Cahuachi was a place of worship, 
celebration and burial. Findings at ancient grave-sites suggest that people also came there to begin their journey to an afterlife, and to be buried with their finest 
treasures. Journeying to the Nazca lines for ceremonial purposes would have been a part of their culture. </p>
<p>One can only imagine what a grand ceremonial event it might have been. Perhaps one of splendid pageantry, with costumes and music, as they trekked across the 
geometric potpourri of lines and angles... and miles and miles of mystical creature-shapes. Is there a single answer to the puzzle of the Nazca lines? Or did they 
serve many functions? What do you think? Do you favor the scholarly interpretations? Or do you fancy the ET theory that other beings must have supervised 
construction? To archaeologist William Isbell, one thing is clear. As the monuments left throughout time prove the marvels achieved by all cultures ... so, too, do the 
Nazca lines reflect the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the native Indians of Peru&#146;s southern coast.</p>
<p>The construction of the lines, he submits, involved no technology more complex than that which was available to diem. And that rather than attribute this 
extraordinary legacy to other creators these inventive, industrious people had the skills to do it by themselves. Perhaps, after all, the message intended for posterity 
was simply: Look at what marvelous works are within us ... no matter how ancient the culture! One well may wonder: When you take away the high-tech of the 
space age and all the advances of the centuries between what powers lie yet within ourselves? We have only to contemplate the face of the Nazca plain for 
inspiration.</p>

<p>The construction of the lines, he submits, involved no technology more complex than that which was available to them. And rather than attribute this extraordinary 
legacy to other creators these inventive, industrious people had the skills to do it by themselves. Perhaps, after all, the message intended for posterity was simple: 
Look at what marvelous works are within us... no matter how ancient the culture!</p>
<p>The Paracas peninsula located 235 Km. south of Lima, is the most important coastal formation in Peru. An unspoiled natural paradise where the desert sands 
reveal treasures of ancient civilizations. The Paracas National Reserve is the first marine conservation center of the country and one of the most important in the 
world. Established in 1975, it covers a total area of 335,000 ha. from which Il7,406 are on lane! and 217,594 are in the ocean. With beautiful beaches, ideal 
weather and impressive scenery it is a place that can be visited all year round.</p>
<p>The abundance of marine fauna -birds, fish and sea mammals- found in the Reserve attracts visitors and ecologist who are amazed by the profusion of sea life. 
Peculiar rocky formations and geological stratus have made the area the object of many studies of origin of the Planet. In the ocean floor, on a straight line from the 
Paracas peninsula another wonder has been found, the Peruvian marine fault, formed millions of years ago when the coastal mountain range fell into the ocean.</p>
<p>This fault is now the merging point for two currents, &quot;el Nino&quot; warm waters coming from the north and &quot;Humbolt&quot; cold waters coming from the south - which 
originates a unique climactic condition for proliferation of plankton and fito-plankton, main food source of innumerable fish species, resulting in the extraordinary 
chain of richness of marine life.</p>
<p>The sea of Paracas is considered the lungs of the Pacific ocean because of the pureness and oxygenation originated in its waters. Another peculiarity of the area are 
the strong winds called &quot;Paracas&quot; reaching speeds of up to 36 km. (21 miles per hour). Added to its natural beauty, Paracas is a very important archaeological and 
historical site, home to one of the advanced cultures that flourished in Peru 1,000 BC, known worldwide by the exquisite textiles with combination of many colors 
and stylized designs, and by the practice of brain surgery and cranial trepanation. The Paracas coast was also the place where libertador San Martin disembarked 
to initiate the liberation from Spain.</p>

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=16%><img src="images/ho_tg1.jpeg" align=bottom width=230 height=140></td><td width=50%>As the capital of Honduras since 1880, along with neighboring Comayaguela, Tegucigalpa forms an important, complex 
urban center in the middle of a mountainous land 3,085 feet above sea level. This capital city is known as Cerro de Plata, or 
Hill of Silver, since its name comes from two indigenous words Tegus, meaning hill, and Galpa meaning silver. Although it is 
an urban center, it has a peculiar air of a small town with an incredibly well-conserved colonial flavor Moreover, easily 
accessible to the Honduran capital are smaller colonial towns like Santa Luciaa, Valle de Angeles, Cedros, San Antonio de 
Oriente and Yuscaran.They are cradled in the skirts of the mountains and maintain the tranquil atmosphere that has long 
defined mountain towns. Travelers will find they are well-worth visiting. Tegucigalpa's origins date to the 16th century.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Shortly after the silver beds were discovered, it was founded as a small Spanish mining camp. It grew to become a city, eventually earning the title &quot;Real de las 
Minas de Tegucigalpa.&quot; Finally, in 1762, it became one of the most important mining districts in Central America. Then, in 1880, decades after Honduras had 
gained its independence from Spain, Tegucigalpa became the nation's capital. The seat of government was transferred from Comayagua. From that point on, the 
old mining town has maintained a distinctive nuance. Today, with its first class hotels, restaurants, commercial centers, banks, and administrative buildings, 
Tegucigalpa is characterized by an enchanting colonial atmosphere. Streets named Calle de las Damas, El Arbolito, la Calle de la Fuente suggest a lost era that 
seems to have been frozen in the surrounding buildings' facades and walls.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="city">The City</a></h3>
<p>In Tegucigalpa, there are many sights designated as tourist attractions. Among them is Plaza Morazan, the city's central park, home to a statue of a national hero: 
Francisco Morazan. A great intellectual, Morazan led the movement to unify Central America. Tegucigalpa's cathedral is named after its patron saint, San Miguel 
Arcangel, or Saint Michael the Archangel. The cathedral was built in 1765, and is a proud example of Creole Baroque, with its beautiful facade of elaborate 
columns and pillars. But for the most part, it is a cross between a very Latin style covered by barrel vaulted ceilings. Moving to the interior of the church, the pulpit 
is beautifully decorated with gold leaf and silver. The cathedral has a fantastic collection of religious paintings that include works by Jose Miguel Gomez, an 
important 1 8th century Honduran painter. Take time to visit the cathedral's southern patio; it has a stone altar with a crucifix on it Many weddings and births have 
transpired under the shade of the legendary Maternity Tree, a sacred place for the townspeople. How it came to be perceived as such is unclear. But even today 
newlyweds come there to shake the tree. According to popular legend, the number of flowers falling from its branches is an indication of how many children the 
couple will have. In the city's southern district is a small plaza called Parque de la Merced, or Mercy Park, named after the church which flanks its eastern side. The 
church shelters an elaborate retablo and beautiful old paintings. The church and surrounding buildings date back to the 1 7th century. In the same district visitors will 
find the Mercedarios Convent, which in 1847 was converted into the National University. A bust of the university's founder, Jose Trinidad Reyes, is in a plaza 
across the street. Another of the buildings on the plaza is currently undergoing renovations to house El Museo del Hombre Hondureno.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other churches that are worth stopping to see; for one, the Church of San Francisco, which is the capital's oldest. Its Baroque style dates to 
the 1 6th century. Another is the Church of los Dolores built in 1732. The stained-glass work of the facade reflects both indigenous and African influences. Calvary 
Church has Moorish influences. It, too, dates back to colonial times and was built with only one nave and a wooden roof. Another interesting place from a more 
recent period is the Presidential Palace, the former seat of government. Built in the early years of this century, it resembles a pale pink painted fortress. The building 
has a Neo-Gothic cupola, a tower, and reflects elements of French 19th century architectural styles. The Legislative Palace, seat of the National Congress, is a 
modern building. It houses four statues by the national sculptor Mario Zamora&#151;these unique works of art are always on exhibit and symbolize industry, education, 
agriculture, and work. Throughout the city, travelers will find Neo-Classical buildings dating back to the last century, as in the case of the Ministries Building, 
completed in 1882. There are others: the Central District Palace, its facade reflecting a romantic style; the National School of Fine Arts, with its Doric columns and 
half point windows. Again, these are just a few of the sights that should not be missed. Parque la Concordia, or Concordia Park, is where one may see wonderful 
small scale replicas of Mayan temples and stelae. They imitate those that have been found in Copan, and many other places throughout the territory once inhabited 
by this great pre-Columbian civilization. The National Museum, also known as Tegucigalpa Museum, is especially for those interested in the cultures of the nation's 
various indigenous groups. It contains several collections of indigenous garments and artisanry from different periods. The section devoted to Mayan archaeology is 
particularly noteworthy for its small scale model of the ancient site at Copan, along with the splendid artifacts found there and in other archaeological sites.</p>
<p>For a spectacular panoramic view of Tegucigalpa and the entire valley, do not miss Parque Naciones Unidas, or United Nations Park, at the top of Mount Picacho. 
There, at 4,224 feet above sea level, one finds lookouts, a floral garden with Mayan replicas, footpaths through pine forests, and the Central American Zoo, with 
many animals indigenous to the area. Crossing the Choluteca River to the opposite bank is Comayaguela, Tegucigalpa's sister city. It is connected to the capital by 
many bridges. In fact, if you like shopping in local markets and are staying in the center of the capital, it is only five minutes from the San Isidro Market, the largest 
in Comayaguela. Shopping is great there. But when becoming acquainted with a country, it is not enough to walk its plazas and sidewalks or even visit museums. 
Admiring traditions, purchasing artisanry, and conversing with people does not bring you close enough. One must eat its bread and drink its wine at popular 
restaurants. Enjoy the ample offerings at restaurants specializing in both local and international fare. Of course, no matter where your taste buds take you, local 
flavors always complement the meals, especially with the large variety of fruits and vegetables available in Honduras, and the fresh fish and shellfish. In addition, the 
local corn tortillas with their generous fillings challenge the imagination, creating infinite delights in culinary combinations. Naturally, traditional Honduran cooking is 
recommended, especially an entree like nacatamal, a delicious combination of pork, rice, raisins, olives, potatoes and garbanzos with corn meal wrapped and 
cooked in banana leaves. One might also try mondongo, a popular stew made of tripe, vegetables and spices. Among the many other dishes worth mentioning are 
those made with fried plantains and beans, corn tortillas and roasted meats, basic ingredients in traditional Honduran cooking. </p>

<h3><a name="surr">THE SURROUNDING AREAS</a></h3>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=16%><img src="images/ho_co4.jpeg" align=bottom width=220 height=152></td><td width=50%>A Gothic-style church situated less than four miles from the capital city is well worth a visit. This shrine, dedicated to the 
Virgin of Suyapa, patron saint of Honduras, draws throngs of religious pilgrims, not only from this country but from 
neighboring nations, who attribute miraculous powers to her. Hidden in the mountains, only nine miles further on, is the 
charming colonial town of Santa Lucia. Preserving the atmosphere of a 16th century mountain town (which it was), Santa 
Lucia&#146;s cobblestone streets are bordered by flowers and its white houses are nestled in the steep mountainside. Its church, 
built on a hillside, is enchanting. It contains antique sacred paintings, like the one depicting the Cristo Negro de las 
Mercedes, or the Black Christ of the Mercedes. The painting was given to the town by King Philip of Spain in 1572; so was 
a Santa Lucia reliquary. This appealing, tranquil town is a traveler's delight, offering pure mountain air and a land where 
farms alternate with unexplored areas, abundant in animal and plant life. The temperature is quite pleasant.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Just 4.8 miles from Santa Lucia is another small and picturesque place called El Valle de Los Angeles, or the Valley of Los Angeles. It is more formally a tourist 
designation and an important center for artisanry. The buildings, houses and plazas have been faithfully restored to the colonial conditions of the 16th century. 
Situated at the foot of La Tigra Mountain, this former mining town is now home to schools for artisans and the teaching of fine arts&#151;where youngsters come to 
learn the art of working with clay, leather, rattan, stone, and precious metals, to name a few of the crafts taught there. As a result, a visit to Valle de los Angeles can 
be like finding gold at the end of a rainbow. Not only can travelers find beautiful and original objects unique to this place, but at prices for less than they would sell 
them for in the city. </p>
<p>About seven miles from the capital is Parque Turistico Nacional La Tigra, or La Tigra National Tourism Park, a natural reserve with about 18,500 acres of land 
The park is situated at about 7,491 feet above sea level. With its enormous tracts of virgin forest, it constitutes the most important reserve in the nation. The 
mountain park shelters a great variety of animals, like ocelots, pumas, monkeys, quetzales, and thousands of birds. Furthermore, the flora is marvelous, with 
thousands of species of trees, and a great variety of other plants, including mosses and ferns. A little beyond Tegucigalpa, about 19 miles from the town of 
Zamorano, is Parque Aurora, or Aurora Park, which is quite popular with capital city dwellers. They are drawn by its pleasant wooded atmosphere and green 
footpaths covered by tree branches. There is a lovely lake and camp grounds Meanwhile, there is still another 16th century mining town worth seeing. With only a 
population of a thousand, Ojojona is also about 19 miles from the capital. It has three small churches. The largest contains a fabulous painting whose subject is the 
Crucifixion; it is said to have been painted by Murillo. National hero Francisco Morazan once made his home in Ojojona, It is also the birthplace of contemporary 
painter Pablo Zelaya Sierra. In fact, there is a museum in town showing a retrospective of his works. Ojojona is famous for ceramics, especially the water pitchers 
shaped like roosters that have become recognized around the world as being characteristically Honduran. Many small, picturesque villages and towns lie in the 
areas around Tegucigalpa.One of the most famous is San Antonio de Oriente, with its narrow, cobbled streets and white adobe houses. The colonial church,</p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=50%>with its twin towers and a red shingled roof, has been frozen in time in the paintings of Jose Antonio Velazquez. 
Comayagua, the nation's first capital, can be found just 49 miles northwest of Tegucigalpa, by taking the highway heading 
toward San Pedro Sula. Its colonial past, including the famous cathedral, many old churches and plazas, has been 
carefully conserved. The museums there are also worth spending time in. Founded in 1537 by Captain Alonso de 
Caceres, with the purpose of constructing a city &quot;between two oceans,&quot; the town was first named Villa de Santa Maria 
de Comayagua. Seven years later, its name was changed to Nueva Valladolid de Comayagua. It remained the nation's 
capital for three centuries, until the government seat was transferred to Tegucigalpa in 1880. The cathedral is a great</td><td width=18%><img src="images/ho_val.jpeg" align=bottom width=255 height=147></td></tr>

<p>example of colonial architecture. Built between 1685 and 1715 by indigenous workers, it is in the center of the city and houses interesting samples of colonial 
artwork. The altar here is similar to the one in the capital city's cathedral; both were fashioned by Vicente Galvez. The cathedral tower's clock is one of the oldest in 
the world and it works perfectly well' It is 800 years old and was made by the Moors in the Alhambra Palace in Seville, Spain. The architecture in the colonial 
center of the city is fascinating. This is the area where travelers will find the museums of Archaeology and History. The Colonial and Religious Art Museum, in Casa 
Cural, completely remodeled in 1990, contains pre-Columbian and colonial objects, some of which are more than 400 years old. Nearby, on the way to 
Siguatepoque, are the caves of Tarule and Taulabe. In the limestone rocks of these subterranean caverns, fantastic forms have been carved by waters and the 
passage of time.</p>

CORFAC* members have a common business objective: to create long-term relationships built on trust and service.  Member firms must demonstrate their ability to provide corporate real estate services in a reliable, professional and trustworthy manner.<P>

These goals mirror those of King & Co International and as a result the King & Co CORFAC* International association was created in 1994.<P>

With 43 associate offices covering 41 major markets in the USA and Canada, linked to 24 King & Co International offices established in seven European countries, the combined marketing force put at the disposal of clients of King & Co CORFAC* International is considerable.<P>
King & Co CORFAC* International clients are able to rely on their existing local firm to provide the same high level of service on both a national and international basis.  Because all King & Co CORFAC* International members are driven by long term relationships, their association allows them to work internationally with other firms who share the same dedication to service and performance accountability.<P>

<B>Steven Podolsky, CORFAC* chairman, comments: </B><I>"The interface between our two groups over the past two years has been both exciting and rewarding.  Clients, who have made use of the service which our combined strengths provide, agree unanimously with us - this is our primary aim."</I>

David Lee created his real estate consultancy in 1993 following an outstanding early career with one of Hong Kong's major developers.<P>

As well as having project managed Central Plaza, the tallest concrete structure in Asia, David is an expert on development particularly that relating to mass transit rail systems.<P>

With over 30 staff in Hong Kong dealing with all real estate matters, the symbiosis between David C Lee and King & Co International was evident and the association was agreed in 1995.<P>

With plans well-advanced for opening shortly in China, this important link in the King & Co International group will benefit those clients who regard this part of the world as the future power house.<P>

<B>David Lee comments: </B><I>"We are looking forward positively to 1997 and have already paved the way to expansion in China.  Our aim is to provide a complete and 1 00% trustworthy port of call to all our clients and, with our local expertise and King & Co's network, we cannot fail."

King Sturge & Co Research has four principle responsibilities. It is:<P>

<UL>
<LI>An information centre, providing and presenting market research in support of individual clients and transactions. <P>

<LI>A consultancy, undertaking and commissioning property-related market research for clients, both internal and external.<P>

<LI>A publisher of market information. In particular the Industrial Floorspace Survey, a nationally recognised indicator of activity in the industrial property market.<P>

<LI>A monitor of information quality throughout the firm.

</UL>

We have a wide range of facilities and sources to assist us in the fulfillment of these responsibilities. 

<UL>
<LI>A conventional library of property and economic data which is fully indexed and available to members of staff.<P>

<LI>On-line access to numerous external information sources including PROPERTY FOCUS, MAID, FT PROFILES and ICC financial data.<P>
<td align=right valign=top><IMG  SRC="/images/dali.jpg"></td>
</td>

</table>

<CENTER><table border=0 width=95%>
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<LI>In-house geodemographic and econometric modelling facilities. We are active members of the ITEM Club and have our own version of the Treasury economic model which we use to drive our UK level forecasting of property variables. In conjunction with Cambridge Econometrics we have developed our own local property market forecasting system - LAMDA,which provides district level economic and rental forecasts by sector.<P>

</UL>
<P>
Access to  King Sturge & Co's internal databases of supply, demand and comparables for all types of property.

<UL>
<LI>We are subscribers to, and sponsors of, the IPD service which records and reports upon around 70% of property investments in the UK.
</UL>
<P>
We are committed to a continuing programme of  improvement in terms of the information available. Constantly, we are striving for greater accuracy in market data, and are improving dramatically the availability and quantification of demand data across the country. We have also established a long-term project to identify and record the national stock of industrial  land and property.<P>



Our best known publication is the Industrial Floorspace Survey, produced three times a year since 1975, showing the level of vacant warehousing and industrial floorspace at regional level.  Series reports produced specifically for clients include the quarterly Property & the Economy, showing the results of our property market projections overlaid onto the latest economic data. <P>

Event-driven research bulletins are produced covering specific issues that have an impact on property markets. Examples include comparative evaluations of the impact of the differing policies of the main political parties prior to the last general election, assessment of budgetary announcements delivered to clients the following morning or evaluation of the changes to assisted areas.<P>

We also produce regular surveys into specific sub-regions for example the Edinburgh Office Survey, an empirical study of the requirements of office occupiers in the City, and the East Thames Corridor report, pre-dating fashionable interest in this area. New series publications will continue to be introduced,  in particular a series of regional reports are under preparation which will provide detailed data on market activity in provincial centres. <P>

Reports addressing specific sectors are also produced at regular intervals for example the Hi-tech Survey and Property, Transport & Distribution. We also publish restricted circulation reports for client use only, eg The Property Economy. A quarterly run of the economic model with forecasts of property variables .<P>
