<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>Lay Renewal Miseries began in 1954 when founder Bob Fenn and a group of laymen in Dallas, Texas, organized a conference to study the role of the laity. The success of this conference spawned requests for similar events in surrounding communities and churches. The work grew over the next twenty-five years until Bob sensed God's call to sell his clothing business and devote his entire life to local church renewal. In 1984 the work was organized as Lay Renewal Ministries, Inc. in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1985 LRM acquired the Institute of Church Renewal started by Dr. Ben Johnson, thus expanding its program resources and network of lay coordinators and team members throughout the country. In 1988, LRM opened its Christian Resource Center where it provides resources and services to individuals, pastors, and churches. SCOPE: Motivational events, equipping workshops, consulting and resources are provided to several hundred churches in over 30 denominations and nondenominational yearly. These churches are located in every state and several foreign countries. With over 100 lay coordinators, consultants and retreat leaders and over 6,000 lay team members and resource representatives, Lay Renewal Ministries is able to serve churches of every size, denominational affiliation and location at an extremely low cost.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.leaderu.com/">Leadership University</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:keith@clm.org">keith@clm.org</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>God's Love In Action (Sammy Tippit Ministries) is emerging at the close of the 20th century as one of the world's leading international revival and evangelistic ministries. God's Love In Action is committed to bringing the message of revival to the church and the gospel to the world utilizing four strategies: God's Love In Action conducts mass evangelistic meetings around the world. Sammy Tippit has preached on every continent and has seen thousands respond publicly to repent and follow Christ. Sammy has mobilized the Christian community in Prayer and Spiritual Awakening conferences around the world. He then mobilizes the Christian community in the ministry of mass evangelism. This has been so effective in Brazil that the Brazilian Baptist Convention has asked God's Love In Action to go to every state capital in Brazil with spiritual awakening conferences and evangelistic crusades by the year 2000. God's Love In Action is committed to the follow-up of new believers. Counselors are trained and classes scheduled for those who come to Christ. In many cities where Sammy has completed crusades, new churches have sprung up as a result of the meetings. Bible college students have stayed for one year following Siberian crusades where previously there was only a handful of believers. Sammy has pioneered evangelistic crusades in Romania, Mongolia, and several un-reached cities in Siberia. He conducted the first ever organized evangelistic outdoor crusades in Romania and Mongolia. He has preached the first ever stadium crusades in over 20 cities in Eastern Europe and Asia.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.gracenvessels.org">Grace ' N Vessels Of Christ Ministries</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:GNV5@aol.com">GNV5@aol.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>Lay Renewal Miseries began in 1954 when founder Bob Fenn and a group of laymen in Dallas, Texas, organized a conference to study the role of the laity. The success of this conference spawned requests for similar events in surrounding communities and churches. The work grew over the next twenty-five years until Bob sensed God's call to sell his clothing business and devote his entire life to local church renewal. In 1984 the work was organized as Lay Renewal Ministries, Inc. in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1985 LRM acquired the Institute of Church Renewal started by Dr. Ben Johnson, thus expanding its program resources and network of lay coordinators and team members throughout the country. In 1988, LRM opened its Christian Resource Center where it provides resources and services to individuals, pastors, and churches. SCOPE: Motivational events, equipping workshops, consulting and resources are provided to several hundred churches in over 30 denominations and nondenominational yearly. These churches are located in every state and several foreign countries. With over 100 lay coordinators, consultants and retreat leaders and over 6,000 lay team members and resource representatives, Lay Renewal Ministries is able to serve churches of every size, denominational affiliation and location at an extremely low cost.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.libertyministries.org">Liberty International Ministries/Para- Church Ministries</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:hermant@voicenet.com">hermant@voicenet.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

In addition, tens of thousands more people from scores of nations are involved on a short-term basis each year. Coming from many different backgrounds and working in a wide range of situations, YWAMers are united in their desire to be part of changing people\'s lives for the better. They have responded to "The Great Commission" --Jesus\' command to His disciples to go into all the world and tell the "good news." They believe the gospel of Jesus is not just about words, but also actions. So they share their faith through many different kinds of practical help--from agricultural training to running medical clinics--as well as telling about the Christian beliefs that inspire their actions.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.ywam.no/eintroa/welcome.html/">Youth with a Mission Norway,Eintroa</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:eintroa@ywam.no">eintroa@ywam.no</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>Lay Renewal Miseries began in 1954 when founder Bob Fenn and a group of laymen in Dallas, Texas, organized a conference to study the role of the laity. The success of this conference spawned requests for similar events in surrounding communities and churches. The work grew over the next twenty-five years until Bob sensed God's call to sell his clothing business and devote his entire life to local church renewal. In 1984 the work was organized as Lay Renewal Ministries, Inc. in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1985 LRM acquired the Institute of Church Renewal started by Dr. Ben Johnson, thus expanding its program resources and network of lay coordinators and team members throughout the country. In 1988, LRM opened its Christian Resource Center where it provides resources and services to individuals, pastors, and churches. SCOPE: Motivational events, equipping workshops, consulting and resources are provided to several hundred churches in over 30 denominations and nondenominational yearly. These churches are located in every state and several foreign countries. With over 100 lay coordinators, consultants and retreat leaders and over 6,000 lay team members and resource representatives, Lay Renewal Ministries is able to serve churches of every size, denominational affiliation and location at an extremely low cost.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://members.gnn.com/rafois/living.htm">Living Parables</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:rafois@aol.com">rafois@aol.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

So, then the important question a youth minister asks himself is: "what do they go home with?" ENTERTAINMENT.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>Christ In The City Column... "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come." (Matthew 24:14. NIV) For a long time, a major stumbling block that hindered my salvation was that I felt the gospel did not pertain to me. I am a young African-American female from inner-city Detroit, and most of what I learned from history and saw in the present from the church turned me off. It was only by the grace of God that I came into salvation... and began to understand that "in Christ there is no east or west". Now, with a heart for evangelism, apologetics, and prayer, I, a student at Florida A&amp;M University, offer this service to the world-wide web. Each month, we will explore a different topic (the Nation of Islam, hip-hop music and culture, New Age) and find out why Christianity is a far better choice.

In the exploration of each theme, short, crisp features present a wide variety of engrossing material, illuminating the theme from different perspectives. There are apt quotations from the Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament, theologians, biblical scholars, saints and mystics, politicians, poets, writers, artists, scientists, doctors, psychologists, and historians. For background references, books, old and new, are summarized. Relevant passages are excerpted for your use. Everything in The Living Pulpit is written in clear, accessible language. We know how valuable your time is, so all our articles are short and to the point. Yet each issue is full of useful, interesting, stimulating material.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>CHRISTIANS FOR ISRAEL is an international and non-political movement of Christians from all churches and denominations who see in the return of the Jewish people to Israel the fulfillment of biblical prophecy and who consider this return as one of the major signs of the times, pointing towards the imminent return of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Messiah of Israel, for the Church, for Israel and for the nations. Our message for the Church is to prepare for the coming of the Lord and to love their Jewish older brother in His Name, to stand in solidarity with the Jewish people and the State of Israel and to oppose anti-Semitism wherever it manifests itself, inside or outside the Christian churches, Islam, or in other religious and non-religious thinking. We pray for the peace of Jerusalem and try to help the Jewish people in a practical way, financially, morally and spiritually. The love for Israel and the Jewish people should visibly unite all Christians, who firmly believe in the Word of God, love the Church, are one in the Holy Spirit and prepare for the coming of the Lord.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.tgx.com/cob/">Church of the Brethren</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:rongordon@juno.com">rongordon@juno.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>Monthly newsletter and on-line resources which help to expose deception in Christian denominations. As we "contend for the faith," we should ever strive to do so without being meanspirited or unkind. We must "speak the truth in love." However, if we are "earnestly contending" it would be unrealistic not to expect at times to be misunderstood or even ridiculed. Love, indeed, means loving people enough to tell them the truth and to warn them of those who in the name of love pervert the truth. Accordingly, our compassion is mainly directed to the uninformed multitudes and young Christians who need to be protected from deceivers and dangerous leaders. Jesus had compassion on the multitudes, but publicly rebuked erroneous leaders.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://members.aol.com/stealth1x">Christian Occult Research &amp; Education</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:orphan3@ix.netcom.com">orphan3@ix.netcom.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>Monthly newsletter and on-line resources which help to expose deception in Christian denominations. As we "contend for the faith," we should ever strive to do so without being meanspirited or unkind. We must "speak the truth in love." However, if we are "earnestly contending" it would be unrealistic not to expect at times to be misunderstood or even ridiculed. Love, indeed, means loving people enough to tell them the truth and to warn them of those who in the name of love pervert the truth. Accordingly, our compassion is mainly directed to the uninformed multitudes and young Christians who need to be protected from deceivers and dangerous leaders. Jesus had compassion on the multitudes, but publicly rebuked erroneous leaders.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.xs4all.nl/~ahein">Christian Press &amp; Online Report</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:ahein@xs4all.nl">ahein@xs4all.nl</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

Our message for the Church is to prepare for the coming of the Lord and to love their Jewish older brother in His Name, to stand in solidarity with the Jewish people and the State of Israel and to oppose anti-Semitism wherever it manifests itself, inside or outside the Christian churches, Islam, or in other religious and non-religious thinking. We pray for the peace of Jerusalem and try to help the Jewish people in a practical way, financially, morally and spiritually. The love for Israel and the Jewish people should visibly unite all Christians, who firmly believe in the Word of God, love the Church, are one in the Holy Spirit and prepare for the coming of the Lord.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.terrigal.net.au/~grahamp/coastlander">Coastlander - a Christian magazine</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:grahamp@terrigal.net.au">grahamp@terrigal.net.au</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

This includes specially translated 'easy to read' deaf Bibles. Materials are obtained from a selection of various denominational sources to best meet the needs and doctrinal background of the person(s) requesting. The ministry assists in the establishment of deaf ministries and the providing of sign language classes. Awareness of deaf ministries is established by performances of the Simon Family in concerts using Southern Gospel Music and sign language along with visual effects. The group has recorded an album, with all monies from sales and donations aiding in the purchase of materials mentioned above and travel expenses. The group has been ministering for 5 years, touring the East Coast for the last two years.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://internet.oit.edu/~thomasc">Mission Field: Internet - Christopher Thomas</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:ExhaltHim@poboxes.com">ExhaltHim@poboxes.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>Pam Clark Prophetic Ministries is a servant ministry to the Church, with a particular mission to those with the prophetic gift and calling. The Prophet's Pen newsletter is published bi-monthly and online and The Prophetic Alliance is a support ministry that meets on the third Friday of the month in Houston, Texas to encourage, edify, heal, support, train, raise up, speak forth, share, minister and bring forth the Kingdom of God and His righteousness. We desire to bring forth dignity and distinction to this five fold gift ministry of Jesus--dignity, in bringing forth a righteous walk, and distinction, as a Biblically defined calling. We believe that the prophetic ministry is called to fulfill the job description found in Ephesians 4:11-16, equipping the saints for the work of the ministry, edifying (building up) the Body of Christ in love and in the Spirit of unity in right living for the glory of God. The Scriptures say, "Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge." We believe that prophets should judge prophets and hold one another to Godly accountability. We do not believe in divining or prophesying for the reward of money. God is networking this ministry all over the nation and the world and we are praying for the Church and the mulititudes in the valley of decision.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.kpardue.com">Pardue &amp; Associates/Don Harris</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:kpardue@inetport.com">kpardue@inetport.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

Suma Ching Hai, leader of Ching Hai, the group that follows her teachings, learned of Clinton's troubles during a prayer meeting with Charles Yah Lin Trie, an Arkansas businessman. Trie is one of Summa Ching Hai's followers and an initiate into the sect, she told the <I>Riverside Press Enterprise</I>.  <BR><B>...After the meeting with Trie, Hai gave lectures in the United States</B> during which she urged her followers to contribute generously to Clinton's defense fund. Clinton is &quot;the president of the United States, the biggest country in the world, and yet he is dragged into the material world by something so trivial,&quot; she told the <I>Times</I>. <BR> <B>...Many of the contributions appeared to be bogus</B>, reports said. Some donors appeared unable to afford their $1,000 gifts, some check signatures had identical handwriting, and sequentially numbered money orders arrived from people in different cities, reports said.  <BR><B>...The Ching Hai sect claims about 100,000 followers around the world. </B>Its practices resemble those of Buddhism, and followers compare Suma Ching Hai, 46, to Buddha and Jesus Christ. A temple is located in Lake Elsinore, Calif.  <P> <B>Detroit will ring in a new tradition as more than 100 church bells peel at midnight</B>. Individuals also are being encouraged to ring hand-held bells at midnight. <BR><B>...The bells are meant to drown out the sound of gunfire</B>. Each New Year's Eve, thousands of bullets are fired randomly into the sky. Bullets fired into the air can fall at 600 feet per second, piercing cars and buildings. Last year, one bullet killed a woman. Church groups also will be holding prayer meetings tonight for peace. <P> <B>A group that opposes abortion has sued after being denied permission to demonstrate</B> on the sidewalk along the route of President Clinton's inaugural parade. The Christian Defense Coalition claims its free-speech rights are being violated. It has asked the National Park Service for permission to assemble with signs along a one-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue. The coalition did receive permission to demonstrate at two other sites away from the parade route. <P> <B>Ambassador University will close in May</B>. The school's board of regents voted to shut down the 50-year-old school because of declining enrollment and funding cuts from the Worldwide Church of God, UPI reported. Officials hope to sell the campus in Big Sandy, Texas, which has 650 students. The Worldwide Church of God and Ambassador University were established by Herbert W. Armstrong, father of evangelist Garner Ted Armstrong. In recent years, the Church has undergone major changes, becoming more evangelical in its theology. The changes caused a split in the denomination, resulting in  losses of membership and revenue. <P> <B>An expedition to the Antarctic</B> will bring together young people from several countries that are in conflict in a bid to foster mutual trust. The 35-member team from 26 countries includes a Palestinian and an Israeli, a Catholic and Protestant from Northern Ireland, and a black and white South African, Reuter news service reported. Others on the trip, which is sponsored by the United Nations cultural organization, have overcome problems with drugs or alcohol. <P> <B>The Albanian Bible Institute was dedicated in Durres, Albania, recently</B>. ABI is supported by Greater Europe Mission, European Christian Mission, and Ancient World Outreach. Fifteen students are enrolled. <P> <B>A retired Russian Army colonel is appealing to American Christians</B> to send Russian-language editions of the New Testament to Russian soldiers. Yevgeny Ivanovich Khatyushin, who was baptized in 1993, has made 17 fund-raising tours of the United States, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reported. He tells audiences that the political climate in Russia is precarious and that, in a crisis, soldiers who are Christians would more likely promote democracy than Communism. Khatyushin's trips to the United States are sponsored by Revival Fire Ministries of Branson, Mo., which said he has raised $500,000 and provided 900,000 paperback copies of the Bible to Russian soldiers.    </font></p>

Most of those arrested were youths, unemployed persons, and repeat offenders, police said. Indonesian Moslem leaders accused unnamed groups with possible communist links of causing the riots. The riots started Thursday after reports that several policemen beat three Muslims; four policemen reportedly may be court martialed for conduct that triggered the violence. <P> <B>Jewish graves were vandalized in a Rome cemetery Saturday</B>. Vandals broke tombstones and ripped off names and Stars of David, and surrounded one tomb with barbed wire and swastikas, news reports said. After the desecration was discovered, 300 Jews attended a ceremony to resanctify the site. <P> <B>Larry Flynt is not a hero, his daughter says</B>. Flynt's oldest daughter Tonya Flynt-Vegta, now a Christian, said the recent release of the film<I> The People vs. Larry Flynt</I> is a nightmare for her, <I>Charisma Magazine</I> reported. The film depicts Flynt as a heroic defender of the First Amendment because of his legal battles to publish <I>Hustler</I>, a pornographic magazine. Flynt-Vega, 31, said she endured sexual abuse from her father and was forced to pose for the magazine at age 19. &quot;I've been sexually abused, beat up, and tortured all my life. I am still suffering from it,&quot; she said. <P> <B>An evangelist in the Chinese house church movement</B> has been arrested in a central province of China, according to Voice of the Martyrs. The U.S.-based group described the missionary as a 35-year-old man. The evangelist was carrying a sizable amount of money that was passed on to him through VOM to help his ministry. The money was confiscated. <BR><B>...This has been the most repressive year for Christians in China</B> since the Cultural Revolution, another VOM missionary in China said. Many Christians fear greater difficulties to come after Beijing takes control of Hong Kong in six months, he said. <P> <B>China launched a manhunt across Tibet</B> <B>and offered a reward of $120,000</B> for the arrest of those responsible for planting a bomb outside government offices in Lhasa last week. Officials blamed the explosion on followers of the region's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, who has waged a non-violent campaign to win autonomy for the deeply religious Buddhist region. Officials have vowed to retaliate for the bombing. <P> <B>Acrobat Philippe Petit will walk across a wire 90 feet high without a net</B> in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City on New Year's Eve. The performance is part of an evening of tribute to James Parks Morton, who is retiring after 25 years as dean of St. John's. The tribute also will include dance, mime, music, and special lighting. <BR><B>...Morton welcomed worshipers of any faith</B> and those with different social and artistic messages to the cathedral, the world's largest. There is a poet's corner above one altar, a fish tank in another, menorahs, Japanese vases, a sports tapestry, and an AIDs memorial, the Associated Press said. Concerts and Halloween parties are a regular part of the cathedral's schedule.    </font></p>

Hundreds of troops patrolled the town, which was quiet today as Muslims said prayers in the mosques.  <BR><B>...Events leading to the riots started when a student in an Islamic boarding school</B> was punished by his teacher for theft, according to <I>The Straits Times</I>. The student complained to his father, a policeman, who summoned the teacher and other teachers. Several police then allegedly assaulted the three teachers. In response, angry students marched to the police station and burned it down, then stoned stores before turning on the churches, the Indonesian newspaper reported.  <BR><B>...Christian churches as well as car showrooms, banks, and stores owned by ethnic Chinese</B> were the main targets. Thirteen churches and seven schools were burned and at least two people died, including an ethnic Chinese woman carried from a burned-out shop. Rioters scrawled obscenities against the ethnic Chinese, who are seen as dominating the economic life of the town. About 160 people were arrested. <BR><B>...&quot;Religious people should be mature and practice self-restraint</B>, avoiding activities that can create resentment among other people,&quot; Suharto said. While more than 80% of Indonesia's nearly 200 million people are Muslims, the country recognizes all the world's major religions. <BR><B>...The riots, coming one day after Christmas, sent ripples of fear through the Christian community, </B>still shaken after the October burning of 23 churches in East Java. That riot started when a mob formed during the court hearing of a Muslim heretic being tried for blasphemy. Five people were killed and 50 are facing trial for involvement in the rioting.  <P> <B>A new law in Singapore requires grown children to take care of their elderly parents.</B> It provides a legal means for parents over 60 to demand support, and a system of mediation and hearings to resolve claims. <BR><B>...Asian societies have always expected grown children to care for their elderly parents,</B> but in recent years, many parents have been neglected. Since the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents opened in June, it has heard 200 cases, some involving parents who arrived on crutches or in wheelchairs. <BR><B>...This new family problem is a result of social changes</B> in  rapidly modernizing Singapore, where numerous people have moved from poverty to affluence in one generation, <I>The New York Times</I> reported. Singapore also is aging faster than any other Asian nation, and in the next 25 years, a quarter of the population will be over 60.  <P> <B>Two thieves robbed two priests at New York City's St. Patrick's Cathedral</B> on Christmas and stole $175, police said. The robbers followed the priests inside the foyer of the cathedral's rectory, located behind the church on Fifth Avenue, a few minutes before midnight on Wednesday. They wished their victims a &quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; then fled. <P> <B>Jews in Detroit donated $15,000 to help rebuild a Baptist church in Arkansas</B> that was destroyed by arson. A representative of the Jewish Community Council Arson Relief Fund presented a check to James Frierson of the Fredonia Missionary Baptist Church in West Helena, Ark. The church, built in 1867, and is in one of the poorest counties in the country. <P> <B>An image of the Virgin Mary on the windows of the Seminole Finance Corp. office building in Clearwater, Fla.,</B> has drawn a half million people in the past two weeks. The crowds necessitated around-the-clock traffic control, news reports said. Officials had hoped the crowds would thin after Christmas, but several hundred people gathered Thursday to pray and sing. The base of the building is littered with flowers, candles, pictures, and notes. People have left cash, credit cards, food stamps, diamond rings, and passes to Walt Disney World. A spokesman said the Catholic Archdiocese does not plan to inspect the image and urged people to &quot;exercise a great deal of healthy skepticism.&quot; <P> <B>The leader of the world's 300 million Orthodox Christians </B>will make his first pastoral visit to the United States Oct. 20 to Nov. 9, 1997. Ecumenical Patriarch Batholomew I of Constantinople will stop in New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.   <P> <B>The composer of the classic <I>Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas</I> has changed the song's lyrics</B> to reflect his Christian faith. Hugh Martin, 82, was not a Christian when he wrote the tune for <I>Meet Me In St. Louis</I>, a 1943 movie starring Judy Garland. Now, Martin's Seventh-day Adventist faith means everything to him, he said.    </font></p>

The youths apparently were angered by a report that police beat religious teachers and students, news reports said. <BR><B>...Christians have become targets for recent mob violence, </B>primarily because they are affluent, observers said. More than 80% of Indonesia's nearly 200 million people are Muslims, but the government recognizes all the world's major religions. <BR><B>...In October, 25 churches and a temple burned and five people died</B> after a mob rampaged in Situbondo, East Java. That riot was begun by Muslims angered by what they considered a court's lenient sentence in a blasphemy case. <P> <B>The first patent for a euthanasia drug combination with potential human use</B> has been granted by the European Patent Office, <I>Newsday</I> reported. It was developed by Michigan State University with research funds from the German chemical company Hoechst AG. The drug originally was intended for animals, but also could be used for humans, the newspaper reported. <BR><B>...Euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide have been practiced for several years</B> in The Netherlands, and recently were made legal in Australia. Oregon voters approved a measure in 1994 allowing doctor-assisted death, but that has been blocked by a court challenge. In January, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in New York and Seattle lawsuits that challenge state bans on doctor-assisted death. <P> <B>Clergyman Rob Schenck said the Secret Service detained him</B> after he admonished President Clinton during a Christmas Eve service at the Washington National Cathedral. Schenck said agents blocked him from leaving the cathedral for 15 minutes while they reached inside his pockets and looked through his wallet.   <BR><B>...Schenck confronted Clinton about his veto of  the partial-birth abortion ban.</B> While Schenck was waiting to receive communion, he leaned over the altar rail toward the front row where the president, his wife, and daughter were seated and quietly told Clinton: &quot;God will hold you to account, Mr. President.&quot; <BR><B>...Schenck returned to his seat after taking communion, but was pulled aside</B> by an agent as he tried to leave the cathedral, he said. An agent told Schenck the president complained to the Secret Service that Schenck had &quot;said words&quot; to him. <BR><B>...The &quot;spectacle&quot; of agents rifling through Schenck's pockets</B> as the choir sang <I>What Child Is This </I>left eyewitness &quot;wondering whether they had been suddenly transported not to Bethlehem but to Beijing,&quot; said Steve Meyers, who watched the incident. Schenck is head of The National Clergy Council, which reportedly includes 5,000 Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant members. <P> <B>A suicide bomber who killed herself and two other people</B> in a Frankfurt, Germany, Protestant church on Christmas Eve was a 49-year-old who had been separated from her husband and was undergoing psychiatric treatment, police said. The woman, whom police did not name, detonated two hand grenades strapped to her abdomen. The blast sent shrapnel and bits of smashed pews flying, injuring 13 others, police said. <P>   <P> <B>A $60 million, 43,000-square-foot cathedral will be built in downtown Los Angeles</B> to replace the one damaged by a 1994 earthquake. The 2,000-seat Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels will replace 120-year-old St. Vibiana's as headquarters for the Los Angeles Archdiocese. St. Vibiana's was condemned after being damaged by the Northridge earthquake. An area next to the new cathedral will include living areas for the archbishop and priests, a meeting center, and a three-acre plaza. <P> <B>The nation's 25 most generous philanthropists</B> are mostly self-made, attribute their generosity in part to their religions, and have been giving to others for years, even before they had much themselves, <I>Fortune</I> magazine reported. In its Jan. 13 issue, the magazine said the top 25 philanthropists gave $1.5 billion this year. At the top of the list are George Soros, president of Soros Fund Management ($350 million); retired grocery and drug store magnate L.S. Skaggs ($155 million); Microsoft chairman Bill Gates ($135 million); Walter Annenberg, former chairman of Triangle Publications ($128 million); and William Hewlett, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard ($100 million). The magazine noted that many billionaires are &quot;stingy&quot; in relation to their wealth. <P>   <P> <B>Utah's law banning abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy is unconstitutional,</B> a federal appeals court ruled. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Monday that the law infringes upon a woman's right to choose, news reports said. <P> <B>Fifty years after the end of World War II</B>, the General Synod of the Nippon Sei Ko Kai (the Anglican Church in Japan) described as sinful its support for Japan's &quot;war of aggression.&quot; Primate James Takashi Yashiro said the apology &quot;has finally come to the surface after much prayer, reflection, discussion, and heart-felt concern.&quot; Nippon Sei Ko Kai said it will start a program in each diocese and parish to &quot;review the historical facts and to deepen our understanding of the Gospel.&quot; <BR><B>...Last year, Presiding Bishop Edmond Browning</B> was among a group calling itself the Fellowship of Reconciliation that expressed &quot;profound sorrow to the Japanese people&quot; for the &quot;unimaginable pain&quot; caused by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Episcopal News Service reported. <BR><B>...&quot;The two statements represent an incredible witness towards healing</B> and reconciliation,&quot; said Brian Grieves, the Episcopal Church's peace and justice ministries officer.    </font></p>

CB International, the Conservative Baptist Foreign Mission Society, identified the missionaries as Rev. Taguchi and his wife. Mrs. Taguchi was subsequently released, but it was unclear whether Rev. Taguchi still was being held. The Taguchis were sent out by the Japan CB Church Association. <BR><B>...Peruvian rebels have been holding a dozen ambassadors</B> and hundreds of other dignitaries. They released 225 of their hostages Sunday night, but not their most strategically important captives, including ambassadors of several Latin American countries, five Peruvian generals, two Peruvian Cabinet members, and Japanese and Peruvian business executives. <BR><B>...Tens of thousands of Peruvians marched through the streets</B> demanding freedom for the hostages and calling for peaceful dialogue. In Lima, a group of evangelists carried a life-size crucifix with a message urging the terrorists to rethink what they are doing, news reports said. <P> <B>A relief group from the National Council of the Churches</B> on Sunday delivered blankets, medical supplies, and powdered milk to several hospitals in Baghdad, Iraq. Church World Service said it had given Iraq relief supplies worth more than $7 million since it started operating in the country six years ago. The group coordinated its activities with Iraq's Red Crescent Society. <P> <B>A Texas appeals court upheld a $1 million jury award against pro-life groups</B> that staged protests at an abortion clinic during the 1992 Republican National Convention. The 14th Court of Appeals in Houston rejected an appeal by Operation Rescue, Rescue America, and two individuals who demonstrated at Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas. Demonstrators carried signs, chanted, prayed, and yelled at people walking into the clinic, violating a court order to keep at least 100 feet away, news reports said. <P> <B>A Taiwanese cult leader contributed to President Clinton's legal defense fund</B>. According to <I>The Washington Post</I>, contributor Ching Hai, the self-styled Supreme Master of Zen, claims she is the living reincarnation of Buddha and Jesus Christ. <I>The Post</I> reported that in Hai's biography, the words &quot;she&quot; and &quot;her&quot; are capitalized because followers consider her to be deity. <I>The Post</I> said Hai also has received congratulatory messages from Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Reagan. <P> <B>A March for Jesus took place earlier this month in Lahore, capital of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan</B>. According to Graham Kendrick, 400 people walked through the city for four hours. A large, brightly decorated truck with a choir, band, and loudspeaker system were at the center of the march. There was singing, public prayer for the nation, preaching, and distribution of thousands of tracts. The march enjoyed cooperation from the police and a general welcome from the public, and was covered by national television. <P> <B>An estimated 1,500 people become Christians every day in China</B> through the ministries of evangelists in the underground churches, according to the <A HREF= http://www.xc.org/brigada/advance/advindex.html ><I>Advance </I>newsletter</A>. With as many as 70 million Christians, Mainland China may rank fifth in Christian population after Russia, Mexico, Brazil, and the United States.    </font></p>

District Judge Joe Fisher denied a request by three Beaumont parents who wanted to stop the Clergy in Schools program. None of the students whose parents filed the lawsuit have attended the program, which is voluntary for students, news reports said. <BR><B>...Clergy began visiting Beaumont schools in September to meet with groups of students</B>. School Superintendent Carrol Thomas said the program is meant to allow ministers and rabbis to teach communication and listening skills. Other professional people also are welcome to volunteer, she said. <P> <B>Smuggling Bibles into China reportedly is on the increase</B>. More than 300,000 Bibles were smuggled into the country by 100 Bible couriers this year, according to Dennis Balcombe, pastor or Revival Christian Church in Hong Kong. Many of the smugglers are tourists who want to evangelize China, he said. <P> <B>A senior Iranian cleric called for restricting Internet access</B> because it feeds &quot;poison&quot; to the masses. Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said in a sermon at Tehran University that the global computer network should be restricted to scientific research. Iran's telecommunications department says it has 10,000 Internet subscribers. They must sign a statement pledging not to read or look at any information deemed &quot;un-Islamic,&quot; such as pornography. <P> <B>Astronomer Carl Sagan, who popularized discussion of the universe</B> in lectures, books, and television, died of pneumonia after a battle with bone marrow disease; he was 62. Sagan won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature in 1978 for <I>The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence</I>. In 1980, his Public Broadcasting Service series <I>Cosmos</I> became the most-watched limited series in American public television. <BR><B>...Sagan believed in the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence</B>, since organic molecules necessary for life appear to exist almost everywhere in the solar system. He said that proving whether mankind is alone or not is one of the world's most important puzzles. <P> <B>An Egyptian professor will not be forced to divorce his wife</B>, a Cairo court ruled. The ruling clears the way for Nasr Abu Zeid, an Arabic literature professor, and his wife, Ibtihal Younis, to return to Egypt. They fled to the Netherlands after a ruling that his writings insulted Islam, and both are teaching at Leiden University. The charge against Abu Zeid was that his writings made him an apostate, so he could not remain married to a Muslim woman. <BR><B>...The case has come to exemplify the struggle between fundamentalists,</B> who want to install Islamic law in Egypt, and secularists, who fear such a move would infringe on intellectual and religions freedom. Abu Zeid says his writings are a scholarly analysis of the language of the Koran. <P> <B>Several top Hollywood film stars have been placed on a blacklist</B> of 50 people barred from visiting Tibet. The blacklist comes a few weeks after Beijing clashed with the Walt Disney Co. over its film on the life of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled god-king. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet to India in 1959 after an unsuccessful uprising against Chinese rule. He has since waged a non-violent campaign for the autonomy of his homeland. Names on the blacklist include Harrison Ford and his wife Melissa Mathison Ford, Brad Pitt, and directors Martin Scorsese and Jean-Jaques Annaud. <BR><B>...Pitt stars in S<I>even Years in Tibet, </I>a film directed by Annaud about the young Dalai Lama</B>. China has reportedly tried to halt production by Disney of <I>Kundun, </I>a film about the Dalai Lama that is directed by Scorsese. Mathison Ford is a scriptwriter for the movie. <P> <B>Former film star Brigitte Bardot, an animal rights activist,</B> is on trial in France on charges of racial bias for an opinion piece she wrote in a conservative newspaper criticizing the Muslim ritual of slaughtering animals. She faces up to a year in prison and a $60,000 fine. <BR><B>...Many of France's 3 million Muslims sacrifice a lamb on Eid al-Adha,</B> the springtime celebration after the fast of  Ramadan. Bardot compared the practice to torture. She also has referred to &quot;foreign overpopulation&quot; in France. Bardot, who is married to a member of the far-right National Front, says she is not &quot;a flag-carrier for any party but for the defense of animals.&quot;    </font></p>

The Dec. 5 issue of Fayette County's newsletter for the drivers advised them that the school board's attorney said &quot;any greeting directed toward students which includes a particular religious significance should be avoided.&quot; That includes the word Christmas, since it is associated with the Christian religion, the newsletter said. <BR><B>...School officials backed down after a public outcry</B> and a telephone call from an attorney from the Rutherford Institute, a religious liberty group. A subsequent memo to Fayette County school district employees said no bus driver would be punished for wishing a passenger a Merry Christmas. <P> <B>A school concert in Birmingham, England, broke up in chaos </B>when a Muslim teacher started berating Muslim pupils for taking part. The choir was singing <I>Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas</I> when Israr Khan, a mathematics teacher at Washwood Heath School, stood up and shouted &quot;Who is your God?&quot; at the singers and the audience of pupils, <I>The London Times</I> reported. &quot;Excuse me, there are Muslim boys and girls in this choir who are saying that Jesus is their God by taking part. This is totally wrong,&quot; Khan was quoted as saying. <BR><B>...Some of the audience, about a third of whom were Asian students, </B>started clapping and shouting &quot;Allah.&quot; Many students walked out. The school said it would investigate the incident, and many parents have called for a public apology from the teacher. <P>    <P> <B>A Christian convert from Islam was released from an Egyptian prison</B> Dec. 10, Compass Direct news service reported. Mohammed Wajdi Mohammed Dura<B>, </B>22, was arrested Oct. 3 by Egyptian state security police and charged with &quot;promoting ideas that disturb the security of Egyptian society.&quot; He had been held in Tanta Prison, 25 miles north of Cairo. His whereabouts and the official status of his case now are not known. <BR><B>...Dura also was arrested in May 1995 and April 1996,</B> when he was accused of  &quot;leading activities against Islam.&quot; A newspaper article blamed Christian radio and a Bible correspondence course for Dura's conversion. The article, published in May by <I>Islamist El-Shaab,</I> was headlined &quot;Mohammed Becomes Michael.&quot; It said State Security police tortured Dura because, by leaving Islam, he had slandered the Koran and its traditions. <P> <B>Episcopal and Lutheran congregations in Missouri share a priest</B>. On Sunday morning, Mary Lou Kator drives 21 miles and crosses two Christian denominations. She is pastor of Peace Evangelical Lutheran Church in Salisbury, where she leads prayers from the Lutheran Book of Worship during a Eucharist service. Her second service is at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Moberly, where she is vicar. She carries a chalice to the altar and reads the Book of Common Prayer. <BR><B>...The arrangement is thought to be unique among Episcopalians and Lutherans,</B> Episcopal News Service reported. Rural congregations of the same denomination often share a pastor. But sharing clergy could become more common in &quot;clergy-starved rural America,&quot; said Bishop Charles H. Maahs of the Evangelical Lutheran in America central state synod. Many churches face closing or reduced services because they can't find or can't afford full-time clergy, he said. <BR><B>...Evangelical Lutherans and Episcopalians have been sharing the Eucharist since 1982. </B>Next summer in Philadelphia, delegates to the two denominational conventions  will vote on an agreement recognizing each other's ordained ministers. <P> <B>A memorial service for an Indianapolis minister and his wife </B>murdered in their home last weekend was held this morning in Louisville. The service for C. Frederick Mathias and his wife, Cleta, was held at Northminister Presbyterian Church, where Mathias was the senior pastor for the past 11 years. <BR><B>...Firefighters found the bodies Dec. 15 after responding to a neighbor's report</B> of a fire at the home. According to the Associated Press, the couple's bodies were bound with ropes. They had been beaten with a blunt instrument and an ax was lodged in Mathias' head. An accelerant was used to start a fire in an upstairs hall. <BR><B>...Security has been tightened around the church</B> since the investigation into the murders began, Presbyterian News Service reported. The church's staff has been urged to be cautious since police are not sure whether the murders were random. <P> <B>Homosexual and lesbian couples must be treated the same as heterosexuals</B> under family law, the Court of Appeal in Ontario, Canada, has ruled. In what <I>The Globe</I> newspaper described as a monumental decision, the court upheld a lower-court ruling that said Ontario's Family Law Act violates Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms since it permits only heterosexual couples to sue for support payments. <P> <B>Gospel for Asia has begun an effort to plant churches among 100 South Asian groups of people </B>who have never heard the gospel. The strategy involves sending missionaries to distribute Christian literature, show films on the life of Jesus, and preach. Additional missionaries will continue the long-term effort, according to the Carrollton, Texas-based ministry. <A HREF= http://www.gfa.org/> Gospel for Asia </A> hopes to complete the effort by 2000.    </font></p>

It is believed to be the first such ordinance in the nation. &quot;Civil penalties have not been enough to stem the tide of discrimination,&quot; said the ordinance's sponsor, Councilman Bill Patmon. <P> <B>Turkey's deputy prime minister has ordered casinos shut down</B>. The order was in line with efforts by the Islamic-led government to curtail gambling, which Islam regards as a sin. Casinos, located in major hotels, provide tourist income. <P> <B>The nation's largest private social services network</B> responded to almost as many requests for emergency help in 1995 as it did in 1994, even though the economy improved during that period. Catholic Charities USA reported it assisted 10.7 million people in 1995, including 7.1 million who needed emergency food, shelter, and clothing. In 1994, the charity aided 11.1 million people, including 7.2 million who needed emergency help. More than half of those seeking emergency help were not on welfare. <P> <B>Billy Graham will use the Internet to communicate with new believers.</B> In addition to calling a telephone number shown on the TV screen, viewers can report their decisions to follow Christ, receive spiritual counseling, or request follow-up materials after a crusade telecast by visiting <A HREF= http://www.billygraham.org >Graham's site.</A> Visitors can pick from nine interactive blocks addressing different needs.    </font></p>

The dispute centers on San Diego businessman Joseph Pike, whose NeoGen Investors is responsible for raising $28 million in capital for the RU-486 venture. In part, the money would be used to distribute the drug and pay for U.S. clinical trials. So far, Pike has raised $14 million, news reports said. <BR><B>...Pike has been accused by the New York-based Population Council,</B> which has the U.S. marketing rights to  RU-486, of hiding his criminal past; Pike is a disbarred lawyer convicted of forgery. The Population Council sued Pike for fraud to force him to relinquish control of NeoGen. The council fears Pike's background could scare off investors and provide ammunition to abortion foes, news reports said. <P> <B>A Baptist pastor has been arrested for letting homeless people camp on his church property</B>. On Dec. 9, the city of Buena Park, Calif., filed criminal charges against Wiley Drake, pastor of First Southern Baptist Church, for refusing to dismantle what one official calls a &quot;shanty town&quot; of more than 70 people. The church's secretary and its treasurer also were charged, Associated Baptist Press reported. <BR><B>...The dispute began last fall, when the church let a few people camp</B> on its two-acre property. The city charges that the people are camping in violation of a city code. Police also blame the camp for increased crime in the city. <BR><B>...Drake says the city's main concern is image, not safety</B>. &quot;To admit you have homeless is bad for business,&quot; Drake said. The church distributes food each month to about 500 families. <P>   <P> <B>The way to create peace after a war is to grant amnesty and forgiveness</B> to those who have &quot;admitted crimes committed during a period of turmoil,&quot; Pope John Paul said. Speaking during a message today to mark the Roman Catholic Church's World Peace Day, the Pope urged forgiveness to heal the wounds of ethnic, religious, and cultural conflict and end what he called &quot;the deadly cycle of revenge,&quot; Reuter news service reported. The Pope said steps should be taken to stop the growth of the arms industry and arms trafficking and called on churches and governments to do more to promote peace. <P> <B>China will send a statue of a folk-religion goddess to Taiwan</B> to improve religious and cultural relations. The Yuanshi Chinshen Matsu, a 1,000-year-old Chinese national treasure, will be displayed in Taiwanese temples for three months beginning in January, the <I>United Evening News</I> reported. Matsu, the patron saint of fishermen, is worshipped in Taiwan and along the southeast coast of China. Beijing claims Taiwan as a runaway province, but retains economic and cultural ties with the island. <P> <B>Thieves stole a bronze statue of a lion, the symbol of Venice</B>, from St. Mark's Basilica in the city, Reuter news service reported. The small statue, which dates from 1615, had been removed from a marble pedestal in a side chapel, possibly with a crowbar, police said. <P> <B>One in four American children under 6 are poor</B>, according to a study released last week by the National Center for Children in Poverty at the Columbia University School of Public Health. From 1979 to 1994, the number of children under 6 living in poverty in the United States grew from 3.5 million to 6.1 million, the study showed. The poverty level for a family of four in 1994 was defined as $15,141 a year. <P> <B>The trial of five Indonesians accused of taking part in a riot</B> in which 25 churches and a temple were destroyed and five people died has begun in Jakarta. Antara news agency reported that the five are accused of  lighting fires and damaging buildings; they could receive 12 years in jail. They are the first of 53 people to go on trial for taking part in the riot, which occurred in October when a crowd became angered with the progress of a court case involving a man tried for blasphemy. <P> <B>A naturalized American citizen was forced to confess</B> to distributing religious materials in Vietnam and entering the country under false pretenses. Man Thi Jones, a 54-year-old resident of Folsom, Calif., told reporters that Vietnamese officials told her she could distribute the materials, but later arrested her. She was questioned for six days and forced to pay a $1,000 fine before officials returned her visa and passport, she said. Jones was released earlier this month and returned to California last week. <BR><B>...Jones said the U.S. State Department sympathized with her, but failed to protest</B> the religious persecution and allowed the case to drag on through Vietnamese legal channels.     </font></p>

Some 91% of the doctors reported they have had patients who sought the aid of a rabbi, priest, or minister to help with their medical problem. <P> <B>Not only children, but 9% of adults believe in Santa Claus</B>, a <I>U.S. News and World Report</I> survey found. Forty-eight percent said the Santa Claus tradition detracts from the religious celebration of Christmas, while 20% said it enhances the holiday. Ninety percent said celebrating Christmas is important to them, but 69% said it has lost meaning. Some 70% said Christmas is the most significant Christian holiday to them, while 19% named Easter. Thirty-eight percent said they hear too little religious Christmas music, while 31% say they hear too much non-religious music. Sixty-three percent attend a religious service over Christmas and 68% give food, money, or clothing to the poor. <P> <B>Abortion protesters hope to spoil President Clinton's inaugural celebrations. </B>The Jan. 18-20 inaugural events overlap with protests against the Jan. 22 anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. <BR><B>...Inaugural day pro-life protests will include a Cemetery of Innocents display</B> of small white crosses -- meant to represent aborted babies -- near the Washington Monument. There also is expected to be a speaker's rally in Lafayette Park, just 100 yards from the reviewing stand where the president and first lady will watch the inaugural parade. Anti-abortion groups said they hope to line the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route with large full-color pictures of aborted fetuses. <P> <B>A pagan worshipper has become a magistrate, or minor judicial official, in England</B>. Aileen Grist, 42, said her Wiccan faith &quot;teaches me to see the god and goddesses in all people. So I will make court decisions on the act done by a person, rather than on their appearance,&quot; <I>The London Times</I> reported. Grist's living room in her home is a temple dedicated to Hermes, Aphrodite, and the Unconquered Sun. <P> <B>Some 300 Burundian refugees returning from Zaire were slaughtered</B> on the premises of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Muramba, about 25 miles north of  Bujumbura, the Burundi's capital, Adventist News Network said. According to reports from the area, the massacre took place Oct. 22 when the refugees were returning to their homes and had taken refuge at the church. <P> <B>Groups of thugs attacked a newly opened church in Bulgaria</B>, news reports said. The attacks appeared to be an effort to drive non-Orthodox Christians from Assenovgrad, a town near Plovdiv. The attacks followed a newspaper report that said a student who committed suicide had been under the influence of  an unnamed &quot;religious sect.&quot;  <P> <B>A Christian political movement has begun in Moscow</B>. The aim of the new All-Russian Christian Union is to become Russia's first major Christian Democratic movement. Similar attempts in the past have formed only marginal political groups, according to Mikhail Men, organizer of the new Christian Union. Men is a member of the Russian Duma, or parliament, and is the son of Alexander Men, a Russian Orthodox preacher and ecumenical theologian. The new movement will be largely Orthodox but open to other denominations so that &quot;people of democratic convictions for whom Christian principles are the cornerstone of their lives can influence the public life of the country,&quot; Men told Ecumenical News International. <P> <B>A missionary in Japan preached on national television</B> about the meaning of Christmas. The Fuji Film Company visited the Tokyo Baptist Church and recorded Southern Baptist pastor Norman Wood last week, Mission News Network reported. Wood's message then was broadcast to the Japanese people.    </font></p>

Priests from Mexico, the United States, Canada, and as far away as Argentina took part in the celebration inside the modern basilica.

The court cited the dangerous effect witchcraft could have on individuals and society. The beheading, in the capital Riyadh, raised to 63 the number of  people executed this year. Convicted murderers, drug smugglers, rapists, and other criminals also are beheaded in the conservative Islamic kingdom. <P> <B>The miracles reported in the Bible may have had foundation in scientific fact,</B> according to a story in the December issue of <I>Popular Mechanics </I>magazine. Hi-tech methods and archaeological research have helped convince some scientists that Bible stories may be true, the article said. <BR><B>...Scientists now are looking for explanations</B> for the parting of the Red Sea, the star of Bethlehem, Noah's ark, Lot's wife, Lazarus' rising, the plague of locusts, and the burning bush, <I>Popular Mechanics</I> reported. <P> <B>Jordan passed a law requiring all schools to offer a course in Christianity for Christian students</B>. Previously, Christian students were required to take a class in Islam if a course in Christianity was not included in the school curriculum, Nazarene Communications Network News reported. <P> <B>Instead of donating money because they love God,</B> many church-goers are demanding tangible results for what they put in the collection plate, according to a new study. Sylvia and John Ronsvalle, who spent three years speaking to congregants in 500 churches from 19 Christian denominations, described their findings in the book <I>Behind the Stained Glass Windows: Money Dynamics in the Church</I>. The Ronsvalles are founders of  empty tomb inc., a nonprofit research group in Champaign, Ill. <BR><B>...&quot;It's a consumer mentality,&quot;</B> Mrs. Ronsvalle said. The trend started in the 1980s, when churches that faced dwindling congregations used market researchers to learn what would attract people. This started a trend in which people shop for a congregation as if they were looking for a department store bargain. <P> <B>A former Moroccan prime minister was picked </B>to lead a group representing the world's Muslim nations. Azeddine Laraki said he would promote Islam as a peaceful faith opposed to terrorism. Members of the 54-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference represent 1.5 billion people in Africa, Europe and Asia. <BR><B>...Delegates at the group's meeting said they are frustrated</B> that non-Muslims associate Islam with political extremism and terrorism. Laraki plans to sponsor seminars to &quot;give proof that Islam is a religion of peace, of progress, of cooperation.&quot; <P> <B>Pamphlets with graphic depictions of late-term abortions have appeared inside packages of cereal</B>, pretzels, cake mix, and toilet paper purchased at stores in northern New Jersey, The Associated Press reported. Police in Ramsey, N.J., received reports of  anti-abortion pamphlets found in packages at ShopRite supermarket. Identical pamphlets have been found in products purchased at grocery stores in Allendale, Hackensack, Paramus, and Hillsdale. <P> <B>Menorahs sprouted up in a Pennsylvania town after an act of vandalism</B>. Vandals early Sunday morning smashed the living room window of  Judith and Martin Markovitz in Newtown Township to destroy an electric menorah lighted in celebration of Hanukkah, <I>The New York Times</I> reported.  <BR><B>...Word about the incident spread quickly</B> through the quiet neighborhood, located northeast of Philadelphia. By nightfall, 18 homes nearby were lighted with electric menorahs. More families said they would have put them in their windows if local stores had not run out of them. Non-Jewish neighbors said they wanted to make sure the Markovitz family knew they had their support.    </font></p>

Libraries threw out the old books, assuming they would soon get newer ones from the West, news reports said. Even science and engineering texts that carried references to socialism were discarded. Weskott took books from heaps by the side of the road and stored them in monastery barns. <BR><B>...One of the books proved invaluable to scientists at Max Planck Institute</B> in Katlenburg-Lindau. When researchers needed certain information for the Cassini Probe on its planned seven-year voyage to Saturn, they turned to Weskott and his barns. There they found the information they needed. <P> <B>A land-mine victim now leads a Christian ministry to other amputees in Cambodia</B>. Iv Vanna Rith of the Khmer Baptist Convention helps the disabled, who often think they are useless, to regain hope. He tells them about the new hope he gained through Jesus Christ, Baptist Press reported. During three months, 29 handicapped people made professions of faith in Christ through Rith's ministry.  <BR><B>...Rith began holding worship services for the new converts</B> in November, 1995. Since then, 100 people have accepted Christ as their savior. The church Rith started meets in six groups throughout the city, and he visits each of them twice a week. <P> <B>An Alabama judge refuses to stop praying in his courtroom.</B> Etowah County Circuit Judge Roy S. Moore said he will defy a ruling prohibiting prayer in his courtroom, Baptist Press reported. Moore opens jury selection with a prayer from visitors or clergy members. Circuit Judge Charles Price banned prayers in any Alabama courtroom, saying it violates the First Amendment. <BR><B>...Price's ruling came a few days after Moore was unseated from a divorce case</B> in which the woman is alleged to have had a lesbian affair. The woman and her attorney filed suit, claiming Moore's Christian beliefs prevented him from being impartial in the proceedings.  <P> <B>As Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961 was about to crash in the Indian Ocean</B> last month, the stewardesses held hands in the tail of the plane and prayed, then asked passengers to become Christians, according to Joe Harding of SIM, who talked to survivors of the crash. Passenger Andy Meekins shared his faith and tried to keep people calm during the crisis, Mission Network News reported. Meekins and two friends from World Vision, Ato Beyene Gutema and Ato Zelalem Ayenew, were on their way to Nairobi for an urban ministry conference; all three died in the crash, Harding said. <P> <B>Co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh of Cambodia had his head and eyebrows shaved</B> in a ceremony marking his entry into the monkhood for one week, Reuter news service reported. Ranariddh was following a royal family tradition by briefly serving as a monk. <P> <B>A homosexual Mardi Gras in Sydney, Australia, is gaining corporate support.</B> Qantas Airways began sponsoring the event in 1995 and telecommunications company Telstra began last year. Family department store Grace Bros. became the latest backer, agreeing to sponsor the post-parade party called the Sleaze Ball. Grace Bros. also will sell Mardi Gras merchandise. The Mardi Gras is a month-long festival, culminating in a parade that attracted 600,000 spectators last year. <P> <B>A court in Kentucky denied a zoning request for a creation museum</B>. Ken Ham, executive director of Answers in Genesis, wanted to build Genesis Park on the site of a farm in Union, but the Boone County Fiscal Court denied his request to rezone the land. Ham blamed &quot;Cincinnati skeptics&quot; and the humanist organization Free Inquiry Group for opposing the project. Ham said he will fight the decision and search for a new location in Kentucky or Ohio. <P> <B>Financially struggling denominations, including the Episcopal Church, </B>increasingly are hoping to tap into donations from members' wills, Ecumenical News International reported. Financial analysts estimate that the older generation of Americans will give away, in their wills, more than $10 trillion in the next few decades. <P> <B>As the result of the overhaul in the federal welfare system, </B>state officials are calling on the religious community to provide more than soup kitchens for the homeless. In Maryland, social service officials asked congregations to help provide child care and transportation for poor families, administer cash benefits, and broker adoptions<I>, The Washington Post</I> reported. <BR><B>...But Maryland religious leaders say they will not cooperate.</B> A coalition of clerics said their congregations cannot afford to assume services to the poor that once were provided by the government. They insist the government is trying to dump its responsibilities on churches when churches already are doing all they can. <P> <B>After high-level opposition, the Vatican suspended its Internet service</B>. According to the Italian newspaper <I>La Stampa</I>, Vatican hierarchy questioned the value and purpose of the web site. Subscribers paid $400 a year for access to information about the Pope's activities, a selection of papal speeches and homilies in Spanish, English, or French, and email to the Vatican.    </font></p>

They covered 15-45 miles a day for a month and a half, retracing the path of Gen. William T. Sherman's Union Army during the Civil War. Sherman's troops pillaged, burned, and raped as they rampaged through the region in 1864-1865. The interdenominational prayer group said its purpose was to ask God to break the legacy of hate, bitterness, and racism left by the war, and thus help &quot;remove an obstacle&quot; to national revival. <P> <B>Pentecostal and Charismatic movements worldwide have seen &quot;astonishing growth&quot;</B> over the past 26 years, according to researcher Justin Long of the Global Evangelization Movement. From .6% of the Christian world in 1900, Long projects the movements will include one-third of global Christianity by 2025. <P> <B>Pope John Paul met today in the Vatican with the leader of the world's six million Armenian Christians</B>, His Holiness Karekin I. The apostles Jude and Bartholomew introduced Armenia to Christianity, and in 301 A.D. Armenia became the first nation to adopt Christianity as a state religion. The Armenian Church is independent, having split from Byzantine Christianity before the Great Schism of 1054, which divided the Eastern and Western Churches. Pope John Paul said he hopes the two Churches eventually can reach full unity. <P> <B>A preacher who illegally bought food stamps on the street and exchanged them for food</B> for the poor faces two years in jail and a $5,000 fine. Slim Lake, founder of God's Church of the Streets in Toledo, Ohio, said he is not afraid of going to jail, but is worried about the poor who depend on him. Lake, 40, pleaded guilty Monday to trafficking in food stamps. He said that, if put on probation, he will stop buying food stamps and find other ways to feed his congregation. <P> <B>Yale University will spend $30 million to rebuild portions of its dilapidated Divinity School</B>. The move will reduce the size of the school, constructed in the 1930s, by about half. A year ago, the university said it would maintain the school's mission of training students for ordination but reduce the number of students and faculty. <P> <B>The <I>Jesus</I> film is being shown extensively in South America.</B> The Nazarene Church in South America is raising funds to buy buses that will be staffed by those traveling throughout the continent showing the evangelistic film about the life of Christ. They also will plant churches, Mission Network News reported. In Paraguay, 100,000 students saw the film in the first year after the country began allowing it to be shown in schools. <P> <B>Stealing of antique statues from cemeteries is becoming more common in the United States</B>. Thieves armed with crowbars drive their trucks into cemeteries when few people are around and steal angels, sundials, or lambs, <I>USA Today</I> reported. The looted items are resold to unscrupulous traders for up to $10,000.  <P> <B>Franklin Graham held a week-long evangelistic campaign in Honduras</B> last month. The effort included emergency relief aid for victims of the flooding that recently swept through the northern parts of the country.  <P> <B>The heads of the three branches of El Salvador's government </B>listened to evangelist Luis Palau preach last month. Palau conducted crusades in three cities Nov. 23-29, coinciding with the country's centennial celebration of the introduction of evangelical missions. Missionaries with Central American Mission, now CAM International, planted the first evangelical church in El Salvador one hundred years ago. Some 300 leaders attended the nation's first prayer breakfast Nov. 27, which included a talk by Campus Crusade for Christ founder Bill Bright.    </font></p>

</td><td width="470">&nbsp;<BR><table width="450"  align="center" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"><tr><td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for December 10, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Australia's House of Representatives voted 88-35 to nullify the world's first voluntary euthanasia law,</B> which took effect in July in the Northern Territory. If the Senate also backs the anti-euthanasia bill, the Northern Territory law would be rescinded. <BR><B>...The law allows terminally ill people who meet certain guidelines</B> to kill themselves with a lethal injection or pills; doctors can assist their suicide. In September, Australian cancer patient and former Christian missionary Bob Dent, 66, committed suicide, becoming the first and only person to use the law. <BR><B>...Opinion polls show 75% of Australians support voluntary euthanasia</B>, Reuter news service said. Linda Cracknell, president of the Voluntary Euthanasia Network, a pro-euthanasia group, condemned Australian politicians for &quot;failing to represent the beliefs of the people.&quot;  <P> <B>U.S. Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) proposed a law that would allow taxpayers to give $500 of their annual tax</B> debt to a charity in their community that fights poverty, drugs, or crime. The money would finance agencies such as the Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, Habitat for Humanity, and &quot;countless others, who are rescuing lives from addiction, dependence and despair,&quot; Coats said. Funding such agencies is more effective than giving money to the government and &quot;hoping that some of it filters down to the poor,&quot; he said. <P> <B>At least $625,000 disappeared last year about the time Madalyn Murray O'Hair</B>, her son Jon, and adopted daughter Robin mysteriously vanished, the<I> San Antonio Express-News</I> reported. The admission of huge losses by two groups that O'Hair controlled contradict claims by atheist officials last summer that corporate assets were intact after the three disappeared in August 1995, the newspaper said. O'Hair, America's  most famous atheist, won a 1963 federal lawsuit removing prayer and Bible reading from American public schools. <P> <B>A zoning appeals board on Monday approved a plan to build a $30 million, 94,000-square-foot Mormon temple</B> in a residential neighborhood in Belmont, Mass. The panel voted 4-1 to approve plans for the Boston Temple, which would include a lighted 139-foot steeple and five other spires. Some residents oppose the temple, saying it would dominate the skyline and flood the neighborhood with traffic. <P> <B>Former Ku Klux Klansmen Hubert Rowell and Arthur A. Haley pleaded guilty</B> Monday in Charleston, S.C., to federal charges of conspiring to burn down rural black Macedonia Baptist Church and a migrant labor camp last year. Prosecutors said the men provided the flammable liquids that two other men used to burn the church, and conspired in the arson that destroyed the camp. The two other men pleaded guilty in August to setting the church fire. Rowell and Haley face up to 60 years in prison and a $1 million fine. <P> <B>A 51-year-old British grandmother has carried her daughter's embryo to term</B>, news reports said. The baby girl was born Thursday in northern England. The woman acted as a surrogate for an embryo created from the eggs of her daughter, who was born without a womb, and the sperm of her daughter's husband.  <P> <B>Homosexual couples in the Netherlands may soon be able to register their relationship</B> as a legally binding union. A proposal to that effect has broad backing in parliament and is expected to become law in January 1998, news reports said. It would give registered same-sex couples the same rights as married heterosexuals except that homosexual couples could not adopt children. <P> <B>The Christian Coalition reported today that it raised nearly $27 million</B> in 1996, a 36% increase over 1995. The group estimated that 1.3 million members contributed. Much of  the money was spent on distributing 46 million guides for voters in last month's election. The guides were given out at 126,000 churches.    </font></p>

Trustees at Mercer University in Macon, Ga., unanimously adopted a resolution Dec. 5 supporting Godsey, who has been criticized by Georgia Baptists over his book <I>When We Talk About God...Let's Be Honest</I>. In September, the Georgia Baptist Convention's executive committee asked the school's trustees to respond to concerns about the book. Messengers at the state convention's annual meeting in November endorsed the executive committee's request.  <BR><B>...Among controversial issues are Godsey's view that the Bible should not be taken literally,</B> and his questions about traditional church teachings such as original sin and the Virgin Birth. Mercer trustees said Godsey's book has had &quot;no adverse effect&quot; on the university's educational mission, Associated Baptist Press reported. Mercer officials said they do not want to sever ties with Georgia Baptists but intend to protect the school's academic freedom.  <BR><B>...Godsey said he has no intention of recanting,</B> although he might state some views differently, ABP said. The book is &quot;about my own journey of belief. It is a very candid, open statement not meant to be imposed on anyone else.&quot;  <P> <B>An evangelical revival is reportedly occurring at a private school outside Windsor, England.</B> Led by an alumnus, students at Eton school are organizing &quot;alternative services&quot; during which students are lining up to become Christians, according to Discipling a Whole Nation. Upper-class churches near the school also are becoming evangelical. <P> <B>Seventh-day Adventist evangelist Merrill Enright wore seven layers of clothing</B> as he conducted a series of  meetings in frozen Beltzi, Moldova. There was no heat or running water, and no indoor restrooms; electricity was unreliable, and much of the crusade was conducted in the dark, he told Adventist News Network. An average of 700 people attended the meetings, which included a slide show in Russian, health talks, and storytelling for children; 180 people were baptized. <BR><B>...&quot;The sense of hopelessness is everywhere. It is very gray</B>. <B>It is a dangerous time there,&quot;</B> Enright said.  Foreign businessmen are &quot;fair game for kidnapping by criminal Russian groups&quot; because they can be held for ransom. After Enright learned of a kidnapping plot against him, church elders and ministers guarded him.   <P> <B>Christians United for Reformation is moving to Philadelphia</B> from Anaheim, Calif. CURE publishes <I>Modern Reformation</I> magazine and broadcasts the syndicated radio program <I>The White Horse Inn</I>. CURE claims that the doctrine of justification &quot;lies rotting in a corner in the basement, ignored amidst the excitements of church growth strategies, user-friendly sermons, and the self-help gospels of pop-psychology.&quot; The new address for Christians United For Reformation is P.O. Box 2000, Philadelphia, PA 19103-8440, 215/546-3696, Fax: 215/735-5133. <P> <B>An album by two contemporary Christian musicians is receiving criticism.</B> When Michael Card, an evangelical, and John Michael Talbot, a Roman Catholic, made an album together, they thought they were simply celebrating their shared faith, Religion News Service said. While the album has been applauded by some, others have opposed what they consider its ecumenical statement. A Protestant church in Arizona  canceled their September concert, and the evangelical publication <I>Moody Magazine</I>, which has long covered Card's music, declined to advertise the joint album, <I>Brother to Brother</I> (Myrrh Records). In October, a Protestant church in Toronto canceled a solo concert scheduled by Talbot.  <BR><B>...Talbot was surprised at the &quot;furor of the anti-Catholicism</B> <B>which we encountered,&quot;</B> he said. In a written statement, Card said, &quot;there are some beliefs within orthodox Catholicism that I cannot agree to,&quot; but Protestants can learn from the Catholic emphasis on &quot;mystery and prayer.&quot;  <P> <B>Prostitutes in southeast Asia are receiving Christian compassion</B>. Singapore's World Outreach has started Rahab Ministries, a hairdressing salon that also offers Christian counseling. As a result, nearly 50 women have left prostitution, according to Mission Network News. <P> <B>An influential Israeli rabbi issued an edict this week ordering mailmen to burn &quot;satanic&quot; promotional literature</B> sent by Christian missionary groups, the Israeli newspaper <I>Haaretz</I> reported. Jewish mailmen must destroy the Christian pamphlets, even at the risk of losing their jobs, said Rabbi Ovadia Yossef, spiritual leader of the Sephardic ultra-Orthodox party Shas. Yossef  issued the ruling after the missionary group Peace sent thousands of promotional pamphlets to Israelis, the <I>Houston Chronicle</I> reported. A spokesman for the postal authority said several mailmen had been assaulted for delivering the Christian pamphlets in ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods. <P> <B>Some 450,000 children of prisoners nationwide will receive Christmas gifts</B> this year through the Angel Tree Project, an annual ministry of Prison Fellowship. More than a million volunteers nationwide will deliver the gifts. Angel Tree also runs a summer camping program that aims to rebuild relationships between children and their absent parents and between families and their communities. A choir of children who have received Christmas gifts and support through the Angel Tree program recorded the album <I>An Angel Tree Christmas</I>, which is being sold in bookstores.     </font></p>

Vijay Chander, who plays the title role. Chander said the series offers a wholesome alternative to sex-filled shows such as <I>The Bold and The Beautiful.</I> Indian television has shown classic Hindu epics, with actors reliving the tumultuous adventures of deities, United Press International reported. <P> <B>The Christian church is &quot;growing enormously&quot; amid political instability, violence, and persecution in Sudan</B>, according to the Sudan Interior Mission. Christians pay higher rent than Muslims, are in danger of being imprisoned for their faith, and are often refused permission to travel, said Benjamin, a pastor in a Khartoum &quot;displacement camp&quot; for refugees. Benjamin's church, where services were held for 800 people, was recently destroyed by fundamentalist Moslems. &quot;But the Christians have great passion, especially for those who repress them,&quot; the SIM report said. <P> <B>Militant Islamics are reshaping their image with acts of charity among the poor</B> in Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, and Algeria<I>, The Christian Science Monitor</I> reported. Hizbullah, the anti-Western, anti-Israel group in southern Lebanon, still promotes violence. But among Lebanon's poor, Hizbullah's image is evolving from resistance fighters to charity campaigners as the militia's leaders use humanitarian and welfare projects to win support. <BR><B>...Hizbullah operates 45 medical dispensaries and a network of clinics</B> and hospitals in southern Lebanon. Financing comes from Iran, other Arab states, and individual contributors. Hizbullah work crews have helped rebuild houses destroyed by Israeli bombs in 1993. <BR><B>...In Turkey, the Islamic party gained power this year with popular support</B> earned by aiding residents during door-to-door campaigns. Moderate Egyptian Muslims have followed the same strategy, and in Algeria appealing to the poor won victory for an Islamic party in 1992 elections, until the army intervened. <P> <B>James Skillington, a Methodist minister and former newspaper writer</B>, edits a weekly Web-based magazine called <A HREF= http://www.villagelife.org ><I>Village Life</I></A>. It offers information on issues such as teen pregnancy and homelessness, and puts readers in contact with groups that address these problems. The ecumenical nonprofit group Kaleidoscope Ministries publishes<I> Village Life, </I>which has one full-time writer, three other staff members, and 33 freelance writers across the country. <P> <B>Christians are praying that a Lincoln, R.I., man suffering from incurable Lou Gehrig's disease</B> will cancel his planned suicide. Noel Earley, 47, who announced his intentions in September, receives about 35 telephone calls a day from people offering to send him Christian books and take him to revival meetings. A Georgia congregation taped Earley's photograph to the pulpit and spent Sunday praying for him. Early, who practices no particular religion and believes he will simply go to sleep when he dies, listens politely but often jokes about religion. His death, which he plans to bring about by injecting himself with a deadly combination of drugs, would be a protest against a state law banning assisted suicide, he has said. <P> <B>The Mormon Church plans to build a 94,000-square-foot, $30-million temple</B> in a residential area in Belmont, Mass., a Boston suburb. The church would have six spires and stand on a rock ledge 40 feet above a highway on one of the highest points in the area. Residents who are opposed to the plan have argued with church officials for a year at zoning board meetings and 50 informal gatherings. Town resident Julie Altshuler told the Associated Press that she feels the church has a right to build, but &quot;they can build an adequate temple that will not tower above my house, the equivalent of a 25-story building.&quot; <P> <B>Researchers in Finland found that women who have had abortions are more likely to commit suicide</B>. The National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health said its findings, published in the <I>British Medical Journal</I>, were important to those who want to prevent suicides. The suicide rate after an abortion was three times the general suicide rate, the researchers wrote. <P> <B>A Pennsylvania woman who drove a 13-year-old girl to New York for an abortion without telling the girl's mother</B> was sentenced Dec. 5 to a year of probation for interfering with the custody of a child. Rose Hartford, who lives in LaPorte, also must pay a $500 fine and perform 150 hours of community service.    </font></p>

The law means businesses with foreign names must substitute them with Farsi-language titles, and government organizations must not use foreign words in reports, speeches, and letters. A similar bill was rejected without explanation earlier this year by the Guardian Council, a panel of  religious leaders who examines all proposed laws. Hundreds of businesses in Iran have foreign names, and many foreign words have no Farsi equivalent. Iran's Muslim government last year banned satellite antennas that can receive foreign television programs. <P> <B>Approximately 10,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews staged a rally </B>in Tel Aviv, Israel, demanding nightclubs, stores, and movie theaters close on the Jewish Sabbath. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef said Sabbath-desecraters should be executed, and other speakers called for a boycott of companies that run television ads on the Sabbath. <BR><B>...Some Israelis feel threatened by the power of ultra-Orthodox Jews</B>, who gained political influence in elections last May. Since then, a government commission in Jerusalem recommended that a highway be closed during Sabbath prayer hours; the Supreme Court upheld a ban on the import of pork; and &quot;modesty squads&quot; have attacked women they considered to be scantily dressed. <P> <B>An anonymous donor dropped a gold coin into a Salvation Army kettle</B> in Chicago this week, continuing a Christmas tradition dating to 1982. The 1996 1-ounce U.S. gold coin is worth about $370. Last year, more than 25 gold items were found in kettles, and brought about $6,500 at an auction. Salvation Army officials think one donor made the early contribution and others have copied it. <P>   <P> <B>A day after he issued a ruling allowing homosexual marriages in Hawaii</B>, Circuit Court Judge Kevin Chang put the decision on hold while the state appeals to Hawaii's Supreme Court. Chang said there would be confusion if homosexual couples got married, then the court overturned his ruling.   <P>    <P> <B>China and the Vatican are trading words over the rights of religious believers.</B> Beijing today rejected  an appeal from Pope John Paul to legalize the Roman Catholic Church and allow its members to worship openly. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said China wants better relations with the Vatican, but won't allow interference in its internal affairs. China allows Catholics to worship openly only if they belong to the Communist-backed Catholic Patriotic Association, which does not recognize the Pope's authority. <P> <B>The world's major nations have increasingly overlooked human rights</B> in foreign policy in order to promote trade or reflect political calculations, Human Rights Watch said Wednesday. The group said major powers, especially the United States, have been willing to exert economic pressure in the name of human rights on poor states such as Burundi, Cuba, Libya, or Sudan, but acquiesce in abuses by economically attractive countries such as China, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia for fear of losing access to lucrative markets. <BR><B>...&quot;Although few governments overtly jettisoned human rights concerns</B>, the major powers argued that the immediate defense of human rights must take a back seat to the creation of conditions that would supposedly, some day in the future, guarantee respect for basic civil and political rights,&quot; the 383-page report said. <P> <B>Abortion foe John Salvi, convicted for killing two clinic workers</B> and wounding five others, was buried Wednesday in Ipswich, Mass. Salvi, 24, apparently committed suicide last Friday in his prison cell in Walpole, Mass. Among the 80 mourners at St. Stanislaus Church was one of Salvi's victims, security guard Richard Serone, who said he blames &quot;the mental illness,&quot; not Salvi or his family, for what happened. <BR><B>...Massachusetts Gov. William Weld ordered an investigation into Salvi's death.</B> Salvi's parents said they want to know why their son was sent to a maximum security prison rather than to another prison where he could have received more mental health treatment. <P> <B>A supermarket tabloid says John Wayne Bobbitt, who gained notoriety </B>when his wife severed his penis, has found religion. <I>The National Examiner</I> interviewed Bobbitt, who was quoted as saying he hopes to perform marriage ceremonies and become a Baptist minister. Bobbitt, who appeared in two pornographic movies after his penis was surgically reattached, says he wants to lead seminars describing &quot;what it was like to go through the tragedies, the turmoil, the drinking, the pornography, and finding God.&quot;     </font></p>

Evangelist Robert Tilton's first and second wives both are arguing that his Word of Faith church in Farmer's Branch, Texas, is Tilton's personal property since he controls it with no outside, formal advisors. Word of Faith has no elders, deacons, or finance committee. The women want the court to break up Word of Faith property and give them shares. State District Judge Bill Burdock refused to drop the church from the current divorce case, ruling that there is no separation between it and Tilton. <BR><B>...Burdock's ruling has &quot;potentially very dangerous implications</B> for the way churches conduct their business,&quot; Lonnie Kliever, chairman of the religion department at Southern Methodist University, told The Associated Press. The property ruling, which apparently is unprecedented, raises questions about the relationship between church leaders and church property, he said. <P> <B>Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey prayed at the tomb of St. Peter at the Vatican</B> on Wednesday. Carey, who heads the 70-million member Anglican Communion, also visited the crypt where modern popes are buried. <BR><B>...Pope John Paul II and Carey both emphasized unity</B>. &quot;We cannot undo overnight the doctrinal differences and bitterness that have resulted from the legacy of history, but we are able to confront them as fellow Christians,&quot; Carey said. The two churches split in 1534 when King Henry VIII broke with Rome over papal authority. They still are divided over the question, and also have hit a stumbling block over women priests. <P> <B>The Florida murder trial of five teen-agers is casting a spotlight on an underground vampire culture</B> that has evolved from the game <I>Vampire: The Masquerade</I>. In the game, which has sold 500,000 copies since its 1991 creation, participants dress up like vampires and act out vampire roles at night on city streets. <BR><B>...<I>Vampire: The Masquerade,</I> which is patterned after <I>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</I></B>, is now second in popularity only to D&amp;D, according to its publisher, White Wolf , Inc., of Atlanta. Serious players belong to clans, and women submit to sires; some less serious players say it is all harmless fun. <BR><B>...The teen-agers in the Florida trial are suspected in the bludgeoning deaths </B>of the parents of one of the teens, 15-year-old Heather Wendorf. Police say all the teens were heavily involved in the game, and eventually some players began drinking their own blood and that of mutilated animals. <P> <B>Paul Freed, 78, founder and president of Trans World Radio, died Dec. 1</B> after a long battle with heart problems. Freed founded the international broadcasting ministry in 1952 in Tangier before moving Trans World Radio to Monte Carlo seven years later. <P> <B>Western missionaries should stop their aggressive proselytizing techniques</B>, speakers said at a World Council of Churches conference this week in Salvador, Brazil. Indigenous groups complained that the missionaries destroyed their cultures, replacing them with Western ideas. Russian Orthodox leaders at the conference criticized evangelization methods used by foreign missionaries after the collapse of communism in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe.  <BR><B>...Western mission agencies should apologize for destroying indigenous cultures</B>, according to one missionary leader from the United States. David Hirano of the United Church of Christ Board for Global Ministries, whose father was converted by Congregational missionaries in Hawaii, praised the UCC for apologizing to native Hawaiians. Christian missionaries &quot;did some good things,&quot; but the native population of Hawaii &quot;was destroyed by Christian missionaries,&quot; he said.  <P> <B>Sixteen former Anglican priests recently returned to the Church of England</B>. The priests had left after the church began ordaining women, <I>The Times</I> of London reported. They have received permission to again conduct Anglican services. Eight of the 16 had joined the Roman Catholic Church. According to <I>The Times</I>, 391 Church of England clergy resigned over the ordination of women priests. Two hundred twenty-one have become Catholics, 22 Orthodox, nine have joined the Free churches, and the others have remained in the Anglican church, although they do not serve as clergy. <P> <B>A Christian radio station in Lebanon is throwing a Christmas party,</B> including food and gifts, for Lebanese and Israeli children. The children will remember that they had fun with others different from themselves, said George Otis, president of Voice of Hope radio. The station arranged for Israeli Defense Force personnel to pick up the children in buses, Otis told Mission News Network. This demonstrates &quot;the humanity of the Jewish people, that they're not all just firing guns all the time, that they're nice people.&quot;  <P> <B>Super Bowl Sunday will also be &quot;Souper Bowl&quot; day</B> at churches of numerous denominations around the country. On that day, volunteers will ask for a $1 donation from everyone present at their services. The money will be used to help feed hungry people in communities in any manner the local church decides is appropriate, such as contributing to a shelter or buying groceries for a food pantry. Souper Bowl, which was begun in 1990 by youth groups in Columbia, S.C., has raised $2 million in six years. Organizers ask that participants report totals by calling a toll free number. A brochure explaining Souper Bowl is available from at (800) 358-SOUP.     </font></p>

Discussions between Carey, spiritual leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, and the Pope are expected to include differences over women priests and papal authority. <BR><B>...In 1995, the Pope said in an encyclical that, for the sake of unity,</B> he was willing to seek accommodation with other denominations on the role of the papacy. The Pope said, however, that Rome would have to hold the primary place among Christians. He reiterated the position in remarks in a speech Monday. <P> <B>Two imprisoned church leaders have been released in Uzbekistan</B>. Twelve days after the arrest of 64 Christians in Tashkent, authorities released a Pentecostal pastor and his assistant, who had been given jail sentences for holding worship services without government permission, Compass Direct reported. Pastor Dennis Podorozhny of the Word of Faith Church and Lev Folkovitch were released in late November. The other 62 Christians were released a few hours after their arrest. <BR><B>...In the past few months, secret police in Tashkent have interrogated other Christian workers</B>, threatening them with fines, imprisonment, and death for doing missionary work among the Uzbek people, who are Muslims, Compass Direct reported. <P> <B>An Egyptian convert from Islam has been imprisoned for two months.</B> Mohammed Wajdi Mohammed Dura, 22, was arrested Oct. 3 for &quot;promoting ideas that disturb the security of Egyptian society,&quot; according to Compass Direct news service. He is incarcerated in the Tanta Prison 25 miles north of Cairo, his attorney, Morris Sadek, said. A court hearing is scheduled for Dec. 9.  <BR><B>...Dura had been arrested twice previously by security police</B>, who accused him of &quot;instigating dissension between Muslims and Christians.&quot; On both occasions, Dura was kicked, slapped, burned, and hung by his hands, he said. Dura reportedly refused to agree to spy for the security police against other Egyptian citizens who have left Islam and become Christians. <BR><B>...Dura, a former law student, was studying in an informal Bible school program</B> at the time of his third arrest. His family also has been harassed, prompting his father and brothers to apply for jobs abroad, one source told Compass. <P> <B>Prison Fellowship International is sending volunteer workers on short-term projects at prisons worldwide</B>. Volunteers from the First Presbyterian Church of  Houston, Texas, recently helped rebuild roofs on a nursery and infirmary at Santa Monica Women's Prison in Lima, Peru<B>,</B> a facility where children live with their mothers. <BR><B>...More than 80 Santa Monica inmates packed the chapel for a worship service</B> during which volunteers and inmates shared music and personal testimonies. Volunteers donated money and each of the inmates received a Bible with their name on it. Two more Prison Fellowship teams left in November for a medical project in Zambia and a construction project in Namibia. <P> <B>Eighty members of China's underground Roman Catholic Church were arrested, beaten, and jailed</B> Nov. 14, according to the Cardinal Kung Foundation. The arrests, which occurred in the eastern Chinese city of Linchuan, are meant to discourage church members from holding an outdoor Mass at Christmas, the Stamford, Conn.-based group said. Some 20,000 underground Catholics gather on Yujia Mountain for important church holidays; authorities often break up the worship services, arresting many. <BR><B>...Five thousand troops destroyed a shrine to Mary in Hubei,</B> in central China, earlier this year and sealed the village to keep out pilgrims, the foundation said. <P> <B>The manager of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn's pension office</B>, who admitted stealing more than $1 million, has accepted a deal that will require her to pay all the money back, prosecutors said. Vincenza Bologna, 53, a church employee for more than 30 years, will avoid prison time under the arrangement. <P> <B>A religious service was held at a dock in Brazil where, for 300 years, millions of Africans arrived for slavery</B>. The Nov. 30 service, held in the city of Salvador during a World Council of Churches conference, included African American spirituals, African and Brazilian music, and rhythmic drumming. Salvador was Brazil's main slave port, the point of arrival starting in 1550 for 6-12 million Africans forced to work on sugar cane plantations. <BR><B>...Ten times more slaves were shipped to Brazil than to the United States.</B> The slave trade to Brazil was abolished in 1854, but the use of slave labor continued until 1888. Descendants of slaves now make up 60% of the population of Salvador. <BR><B>...The death rate for Brazil-bound slaves was so high</B> (about 40% died in the ships' hulls) that in 1860 Brazil's black population was half the size of that in the United States. The slaves were collectively baptized by priests, thus increasing their value, Ecuemnical News International said. <BR><B>...&quot;Words cannot express what this moment means to us,&quot;</B>said Janice Nessibou, a  Presbyterian from Ghana. &quot;The water of this ocean carried the slaves from Africa to Brazil; this sea gathered their tears,&quot; said Kwame Labi, an Orthodox priest from Ghana.    </font></p>

The exodus of refugees from Zaire left many children lost. Workers are taking unidentified street children in Kigali and Butati to orphanages, where tracing work is done, Phyllis Sorter of the Free Methodist Church said. Some 130 of the children, highly traumatized and despairing, have been returned to their parents.  <P> <B>The Salvation Army in Akron, Ohio, is accepting credit-card donations</B>. The $3,000 computer credit-card ready kettle was put into action last week at Chapel Hill Mall, the <I>Akron Beacon Journal</I> reported. The kettle prints out a receipt that can be saved for the IRS. The national Salvation Army said it may use the collection method in other parts of the nation. <P> <B>The Church of England may abolish the 800-year-old tradition of reading Banns.</B> The Banns -- an announcement of intent to marry -- is read in church on three consecutive Sundays before a wedding. The practice was introduced in the 12th century to prevent clandestine or improper marriages. Critics describe it as &quot;a medieval anachronism&quot; that has outlived its usefulness, especially since very few couples married in churches are known to the congregation. Marriage services will retain the question of  whether anyone knows an impediment to the marriage. About 200,000 couples are married by the Church of England each year. <P> <B>Evangelical Christians make up about 35% of the population of Kenya</B>, according to Operation Mobilization missionary Katherine Parker. According to DAWN, Kenya has the third-highest proportion of evangelical Christians in the world, following El Salvador (54%) and Guatemala (43%). <P> <B>Romania has begun a new era that is neither communist nor godless</B>. Newly elected President Emil Constantinescu marked a milestone for post-Communist Eastern Europe last Friday by supplementing his civil inauguration with a religious ritual held in an Orthodox cathedral. Constantinescu, 57, indicated that the decades of official atheism under Communism were also being set aside. He listened as the head of the Romanian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Teoctist called on him to preserve the country's spiritual and national dignity. <P> <B>Involvement of churches in New Age spirituality is a blind alley rather than a path to God</B>. That's the conclusion of Mission Theological Advisory Group, which reported its findings to the Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland and to the Church of England's general synod. The report, <I>The Search for Faith and the Witness of the Church,</I> said New Age practices such as aromatherapy, divination though stars, crystals, or the Tarot, and meditating on pyramids are not true paths to God, but are directed only at making the individual feel good. Involvement in the New Age produces a &quot;Religion of Me&quot; in which where the self becomes an idol, the report said. <P> <B>Roman Catholics who want more democracy in the Church</B> have grown into an international movement. Reform-minded Catholics from Europe and North America who make up the We Are the Church movement met in Rome. They called for a meeting to take place in Rome on Oct. 11., 1997, coinciding with the 35th anniversary of the Second Vatican Council. At that time, petitions signed by Catholics in Europe and North and South America will be presented to the Vatican, addressed to Pope John Paul II, the group said. <BR><B>...The movement began in Austria, where a half million signatures</B> have been gathered supporting the petition. We are the Church also has spread to Germany, where 1.8 million people signed a similar appeal, and to other European countries, the United States, and Canada, where petitions are still being collected, Ecumenical News International said. The petitions call for regular dialogue at all levels of the Roman Catholic Church, equality between men and women in all ministries, optional celibacy for clergy, freedom of conscience for married couples in matters of birth control, respect for homosexuals and divorcees who have remarried, and a greater commitment to justice and peace. <BR><B>...Most bishops have ignored the initiative or opposed it, but a few have shown cautious openness. </B>During a visit to Germany this summer, Pope John Paul said Catholic beliefs and the authority of the bishops &quot;cannot be suspended, either in public debate or in pastoral discussions.&quot; <P> <B>In France, 450 new evangelical churches have been planted in five years</B>, according to AUBE 2000, a national evangelistic strategy group. David Stephens of the research organization Action Recherche Croissance, which prepared a report on the French church, said the new congregations are &quot;a clear sign that God is at work in this evangelistically neglected country,&quot; DAWN FridayFax reported. There are 2,465 Protestant congregations in France, about one per 23,000 people. <P> <B>Roman Catholic feminists were victims of a hoax</B>. The Catholic Women's Network published an article in its journal <I>Network</I> that purports to have been written by &quot;Carmel Lenehan&quot; from Western Australia. <I>The Daily Telegraph</I> described the article as a parody that is full of heresy and feminist rhetoric. It was written by traditionalist Catholic author Joanna Bogle, a <I>Catholic Times </I>columnist. Bogle, 44, wrote the article as a parody of the summer issue of the <I>Network</I>.  <BR><B>...Bogle's parody described a fictitious &quot;Circle Weekend&quot; of CWN women</B> in Western Australia and included passages such as: &quot;We began with a foot massage and then, in a circle, we each in turn spoke, saying I matter. I affirm self. What I am, I have a right to be, and then some affirming/growth statement, such as the loving and caring in me reaches out to you, and you, and you. It was really moving. Over avocado and salads, we shared music. And there was talk about the Church and the way it/he oppresses us and how we can change it.&quot;  <BR><B>...&quot;I put in everything - even a woman living in sin with a priest.</B> I thought they would never fall for this. But they did -- hook, line, and sinker,&quot; Bogle said. &quot;I don't know why they call themselves Catholics. They are not Catholics at all.&quot;    </font></p>

Since the 1970s, families have become smaller, more have only one parent, and more have mothers who work outside the home. Those trends are entrenched in society, but have slowed. From 1970 to 1990, the number of married couples with children under 18 shrank from 40% of all households to 25%, the Census Bureau said. The number of single-person households climbed from 17% of all households to 25%. Those rates now have stabilized, and were the same in 1995. The divorce rate also has stabilized since 1990 at about 4.6 divorces per 1,000 people, after doubling from 1960 to 1990.  <BR><B>...A little-noticed fact in the study is that more than half of all households are headed by a married couple,</B> some of whom have yet to have children while others have already raised children, according to William Mattox of the Family Research Council. Much of the growth of one-person households is due to the increase in elderly people living alone after the death of their spouse, he noted. The rise in single-parent households and unmarried households continues to be a cause for concern, he said. <P> <B>The Episcopal Church announced it has recovered all but about $100,000</B> from the $2.2 million embezzled by former treasurer Ellen Cooke. After deducting $320,000 in costs associated with the case, the net loss to the church is $422,094, the church treasurer's office reported. It's report did not include interest that would have been earned on the lost funds. Cooke is serving five years in a West Virginia prison after pleading guilty to income tax evasion and transporting stolen money across state lines.  <P> <B>Biblical scholars who belong to the iconoclastic Jesus Seminar</B> plan to consider whether the New Testament should be revised to include other ancient Christian texts, <I>The New York Times </I>reported. The scholars also say they will review the church's early creeds, develop books of biblical criticism for lay people, and have members draw up their own profiles of Jesus. Seminar founder Robert W. Funk called for &quot;a new reformation&quot; of Christianity, even drawing up a list of theses to challenge current doctrines. <BR><B>...Seminar theologians claim that a minority of Jesus' sayings were His actual words</B>. They describe the rest of Christ's words in the New Testament as probably composed by early Christians after the crucifixion. Next year, the seminar will publish an analysis of  Jesus' deeds that presents Him as a charismatic, but not necessarily divine, religious figure. <P> <B>Some 1,000 Christian leaders from across Canada spent three days listening, learning, and networking</B> at World Shapers '96 Oct. 28-21 in Toronto. Speakers included Charles Colson of Prison Fellowship, who decried North America's lapse into moral relativism, the newspaper <I>Christian Week</I> said. Connie denBok, a church planter with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, warned of complacency in the church. Christians should not become the establishment -- &quot;more couth, more polished, and look better&quot; -- but be &quot;practitioners of frontier Christianity,&quot; she said.  <P>    <P> <B>Hitler adopted anti-Semitism only as a stepping stone to power</B>, according to an Austrian historian. The young Hitler respected and later protected the Jewish family doctor who treated his mother's cancer. He had Jewish friends and even admired Jewish actors and composers, according to Brigitte Hamann, a Viennese academic. Hitler later developed his anti-Semitic attitude because it reflected the mood of the times and allowed him to build a movement, her study of Austrian and German archives shows. The findings have set off a new controversy about Hitler's personal responsibility for the Holocaust,<I> The London Times</I> reported. <P> <B>An Oct. 20 <I>Parade Magazine</I> article on Billy Graham needs clarification</B>, according to A. Larry Ross, director of media and public relations for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. In a letter to <I>Parade</I>'s editor, Ross said Graham's message &quot;hasn't changed.&quot; Graham &quot;believes there is only one path to God -- through repentance and faith in the atoning death of Jesus Christ, who provides redemption from sin and the promise of eternal life.&quot; The <I>Parade</I> writer, Colin Greer, quoted Graham as stating: &quot;I fully adhere to the fundamental tenets of Christian faith for myself and my ministry. But, as an American, I respect other paths to God -- and, as a Christian, I am called on to love them.&quot; Graham's statement recognizes that there are many religions in society, and that Christians are to love every individual, regardless of their beliefs, Ross said. <P> <B>The body of Ron Farris, a Nazarene medical missionary to West Africa</B>, has been positively identified by State Department officials. Farris is officially listed as a casualty of Saturday's hijacking and subsequent crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961, according to Jack Stone, general secretary for the Church of the Nazarene. Survivors include his wife, four children, and his parents. <P> <B>The release of Carl Hunziker in North Korea could improve relations between Pyongyang and Washington, </B>analysts said. North Korea on Wednesday freed Hunziker, who had been detained on spy charges for three months. He arrived in Tokyo with U.S. Congressman Bill Richardson, who negotiated his release. The U.S. paid a $5,000 hotel bill but no fine, Richardson said. Hunziker, whose family says he is a missionary, was detained by North Korea near the border with China when he crossed the Yalu River separating the two countries. <BR><B>...Hunziker, 26, looked weary and seemed embarrassed by the ranks of journalists and camera crews</B> when he stepped from a U.S. Air Force plane onto Yokota U.S. airbase, near Tokyo. He raised his hands with Richardson as U.S. military personnel applauded. Hunziker is expected to be home in Parkland, Wash., for Thanksgiving. <P> <B>The Walt Disney Co. said it won't be intimidated by China. </B>The filmmaker announced it will stick with plans to distribute <I>Kundun</I>, a new film about the Dalai Lama, despite objections from the Chinese government. Beijing regards the Dalai Lama, the exiled religious leader of Tibet, as a threat to its rule over the Himalayan region. <BR><B>...China's objections raised concerns that Disney will be prevented</B> from doing business in the Asian nation, one of  the filmmaker's largest untapped markets. The movie will be distributed only in the United States. <P> <B>President Clinton urged clergy to remind young people in their congregations about the dangers of AIDS and drugs</B>. In a written appeal to 300 individuals and clergy organizations, Clinton said World AIDS Day on Sunday is a chance to &quot;reflect on the tremendous impact that HIV and AIDS have had on our nation's families, our communities, our country and our planet.&quot;    </font></p>

</td><td width="470">&nbsp;<BR><table width="450"  align="center" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"><tr><td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 26, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Some 200 Catholics in Chiapas, Mexico, attacked evangelical Protestants</B> with firearms, rocks, machetes, picks, hoes, and sticks. One person was killed and 19 injured, the newspaper <I>Cuarto Poder</I> reported. The clashes began last Sunday when the Catholics marched onto the evangelicals' land to measure the property, which they consider their own even though it was given to the evangelicals by the government. <BR><B>...Long-running clashes among the groups, both of whom are Tzeltal Maya Indians, have worsened recently</B>. In the last 25 years, more than 25,000 Indian converts to evangelical Christianity have been expelled from Chiapas communities. Evangelicals, who are members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, are resented by members of the leftist opposition Democratic Revolution Party, who practice a Mayan religion mixed with Catholicism. <P> <B>Christian missionaries in Israel are concerned about their safety after a direct-mail evangelism campaign last week</B>. The electronic publication <I>Speed the Need</I> said influential ultra-Orthodox Jews are threatening Christian missionaries after a million books about Jesus the Messiah were mailed to Israelis who had requested information about Christianity. Names of the missionaries are linked to the distribution.  <P> <B>The United States announced it will evacuate 5,000 relief workers from northern Iraq,</B> news reports said. The State Department said the workers, who had helped feed anti-Saddam Hussein rebels, will be flown to Guam along with their families. The group consists of employees of 24 relief organizations funded or based in the United States. It would be the third such airlift from the area. <P> <B>The U.S. Navy discharged an enlisted man</B> who said he could no longer work for an &quot;immoral and corrupt&quot; government that supports abortion. Petty Officer 3rd Class William J. Downes was being separated from the Navy at his own request, a Navy spokesman said. Downes was given a &quot;general discharge,&quot; which is less than an honorable separation but avoids a dishonorable discharge. <BR><B>...Downes said he requested a court martial trial in order to defend his actions</B>, but the request was denied. He also was denied an administrative discharge since the issue did not fall within the parameters of &quot;conscientious objection&quot; as defined by military law, a Navy spokesman said.  <BR><B>...Downes said he grappled with his conscience over the decision</B>. On Oct. 15, he began going to work out of uniform and refusing to perform any duties, <I>The Washington Times</I> said. &quot;I can't support any government that sanctions the killing of unborn children and which performs abortion at its military medical facilities,&quot; Downes said in a statement. Downes, 31, who is Catholic, is married and the father of two small boys. He had been assigned to the chaplain's office at the U.S. naval Academy in Annapolis. <BR><B>...&quot;In my oath of enlistment, I promised under God to support and defend the Constitution</B>. I firmly believe that the 14th Amendment, which states that 'no person may be deprived of life...without due process,' should properly apply to pre-born persons,&quot; he wrote in a letter explaining his actions to his commanding officer. &quot;All three branches of government are aligned against the right to life,&quot; Downes said, citing the Senate's failure to override President Clinton's veto of the ban on partial-birth abortions. Downes said that after leaving the Navy, he wants to get involved in pro-life advocacy on full time. <P> <B>The gospel is being broadcast from Armenia, deep in the heart of Islamic territory, </B>Trans World Radio said. The million-watt AM transmitter was built and used by the Soviet Union for propaganda purposes. The new broadcasts, which began this month, bring the gospel to millions of people who have never heard it, including 60 of the world's least-evangelized people groups, TWR said. Countries covered by the signal include Turkey, Georgia, Iran, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. <P> <B>Saudi Arabia beheaded two women and three men Tuesday for drug smuggling</B>, Saudi television reported. That increases to 58 the number of people executed this year in the Moslem kingdom, which enforces sharia law by publicly beheading by the sword convicted murderers, drug smugglers, rapists, and other criminals. <P>     <P> <B>Cuba's Catholic church has gained government approval to create a Catholic press association.</B> The rare, non-official media group reflects improved ties between the church and communist authorities. Most members of the new Cuban Catholic Press Union are not journalists, but people who have worked on church publications. The journalism profession has been barred for a long time to people practicing religion, Reuter news service reported. <P> <B>Uzbekistan police reportedly have arrested 64 Christians in Tashkent</B>. A Pentecostal pastor, his assistant, and 62 members of the Word of Faith congregation were arrested Nov. 18 when they gathered at the Dinamo Tennis Club to discuss the congregation's future, according to a report from Compass Direct. The wife of pastor Dennis Podorozhny confirmed the arrests and imprisonment of her husband and his assistant, Lev Folkovich. The two men were sentenced to 12 days imprisonment, and were being held in a cell in which they had room only to stand or sit. Congregation members were &quot;rudely interrogated&quot; and released. <BR><B>...During the meeting, security police in uniforms entered the club and ended the meeting</B>, Podorozhny's wife said. Word of Faith started five years ago, but the Ministry of Justice revoked its official registration in 1994. Legal efforts to renew the church's status have been denied, forcing the congregation to meet in homes with a monthly gathering in a rented hall. Podorozhny, 25, also was arrested Sept. 22 after security police disrupted a worship service in a rented hall. He was fined three months' wages and released after being handcuffed and interrogated. <P> <B>A French court acquitted all eight national leaders of the Scientology church</B> in a criminal trial stemming from a follower's suicide. At the trial, prosecutors depicted Scientology as a business concealed as a religion. Scientology force money from gullible people through abusive, high-pressure techniques, prosecutors said. Defense lawyers said the group was a legitimate religion and argued that their clients were victims of a government campaign to crack down on cults.    </font></p>

The South Korean religious leader received the backing of George Bush, who praised Moon's respect for editorial independence. The former U.S. president, speaking at a banquet launching the publication in Buenos Aires Nov. 23, praised Moon's U.S. publication, <I>The Washington Times</I>, and referred to Moon as &quot;the man with the vision.&quot; <I>The Washington Post</I> reported Bush was paid $100,000 for his speech. Moon said his new paper would &quot;provide the most edifying reports in every aspect...promoting harmony and reverting the tendency towards disbelief.&quot; <BR><B>...Bush traveled to Uruguay Nov. 24 to help Moon inaugurate a Unification Church seminary</B> in Montevideo, news reports said. Moon owns a newspaper, bank, and hotel in Uruguay and is buying land in the Argentine province of Corrientes, where he plans to construct what his followers call &quot;ideal cities.&quot; <BR><B>...Moon portrays himself as an incarnation of God, fulfilling the mission of Christ.</B> Critics say he brainwashes the vulnerable. Some countries, such as Germany, consider Moon a threat and refuse him an entry visa. <P> <B>A reporting flaw inflated Episcopal Church membership figures for the last five years.</B> Denominational staff who took over from the office of former treasurer Ellen Cooke discovered the inaccuracy, news reports said. <BR><B>...Up to 37% of parishes did not accurately report increases and decreases, </B>starting with a count every year that was different from the one they ended with in the previous year, said Raymond Duncan of the General Convention office. The treasurer's office used the higher figure and adjusted it with the reported increases or decreases of the current year. The practice of  &quot;rolling over&quot; year-end numbers artificially inflated the statistics, Duncan told Ecumenical News International. <BR><B>...Baptized membership between 1991 and 1994 dropped 25,569</B> -- from 2,428,085 to 2,402,516 -- rather than increasing 90,267 over that time, the General Convention office said. <P> <B>The Christian Economic Coalition, a group of business and professional people,</B> helps start businesses in inner-city Boston. Located in impoverished Roxbury, Mass., the coalition has helped found 14 small businesses by offering training, advice, and start-up funding. The coalition has a partnership with one of the largest banks in Boston. It may buy a site to build a $3.5 million roller skating rink, <I>Reconcilers</I> magazine reported. <P> <B>Christian leaders are frequently subject to violent attacks in Colombia</B>, according to the Latin American and Caribbean Communication Agency. On Nov. 18, Presbyterian Church lay pastor and community-development leader Pedro Alzate Varela was murdered. <BR><B>...Alzate was riding a bus in Uraba Province when armed men boarded</B> and demanded that passengers present their identity documents. He was separated from the group and shot in front of other passengers, news reports said. <P> <B>Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, one of the world's most powerful Roman Catholics, condemned rock music</B> as an &quot;instrument of the devil&quot; and urged young people not to listen to it, <I>The London Times</I> reported. Ratzinger, who is Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, is considered the highest moral authority in the Vatican after the Pope. <BR><B>...There are &quot;diabolical and satanic messages&quot; in much of today's rock music</B>, the cardinal said. He warned against subliminal satanic influence in songs by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Queen, Led Zeppelin and the Eagles. Ratzinger said there are many positive aspects of popular music but a great deal that &quot;endangers the human soul.&quot; <P> <B>Adam and Eve may have been &quot;some other form&quot; than human</B>, Cardinal John O'Connor told worshipers at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York Sunday. It is possible that the first living creature was a &quot;lower animal,&quot; the head of the New York archdiocese said. His comments came a month after Pope John Paul II said the theory of evolution was &quot;more than just a hypothesis.&quot; <P> <B>Cuba will allow 40 foreign Roman Catholic priests and nuns to work on the island</B>, church sources said. It is the largest number of foreign priests and nuns permitted to come to the island in thirty years. The authorizations follow a meeting between President Fidel Castro and Pope John Paul II in the Vatican last week. The action indicates a willingness by Cuba to make concessions in return for improved relations with local churches and the Vatican, observers said. <P> <B>The fire and brimstone was realistic at a South African church service Sunday</B>. Theologian Dominee Ferdi Gouws accidentally set off a canister of tear gas while preaching about the seriousness of sin, Reuter news service reported. Gouws, speaking during the children's service at Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk near Port Elizabeth, was using aerosol sprays as props when he released the tear gas. It spread quickly as the congregation rushed out of the pews coughing and sneezing. The minister apologized, and congregants coughed through the rest of the service. <P> <B>Mother Teresa suffered heart failure for the second time</B> in three days Sunday in Calcutta, India. News reports said she would not be released from the hospital soon.    </font></p>

Entertainment Fellowship, founded in 1993 by actor Robert Hanley, helps actors and actresses &quot;recognize and apply Judeo-Christian principles into their careers,&quot; <I>The Washington Times</I> said. Other groups promoting spiritual values are Actor's Co-Op, Arts and Entertainment Ministry, Open Call, Inter-Mission, Master Media International, and Associates in Media. <P> <B>A little money and a lot of caring is going a long way in Madagascar, </B>where some of the world's poorest people live. Thousands of residents of the island, located off the east coast of Africa, were left homeless and destitute in 1993 by Cyclone Geraldo. Many in the country, where the average monthly income is less than $20, were driven to begging or prostitution, Baptist Press said. <BR><B>...After the cyclone, 180 homeless families created the village of Amboanjobe</B>. Southern Baptist missionaries, hoping to help the residents become self-supporting, used relief funds to give each family a $10 credit toward the purchase of animals such as chickens, ducks, or turkeys. Some families pooled their credits to buy a sheep or pig. Now a herd of dairy cows provides milk to improve the diets of children and a new biogas plant uses cow manure to produce gas to cook meals.  <BR><B>...Some of the families have become Christians and formed a congregation.</B> Members of the new church began going door-to-door sharing the gospel with every family in the village, resulting in 40 decisions for Christ in one week. Now the congregation is turning its attention to other villages, some of which are controlled by witch doctors.  <P> <B>Evangelist Sammy Tippit, preaching in Cuba this week,</B> found a hunger there for spiritual things. Tippit, who received a visa to preach, spoke in several churches where numerous people made public commitments to Christ and &quot;many Christians prayed to God to do a deep work in their lives,&quot; he said. At one church, &quot;the people didn't want to leave. Finally, at 11 p.m., the pastor could tell we were exhausted and he dismissed the people.&quot; <BR><B>...Tippit also held a conference for pastors and their wives.</B> &quot;Pastors wept and shared how God had shown them sin in their lives and wrong relationships with their wives,&quot; Tippit said.  <P> <B>Mother Teresa was recovering Friday after suffering partial heart failure</B>. The Roman Catholic nun was rushed to a hospital in Calcutta, India, where her cardiologist said she suffered left ventricular failure. <P> <B>Shortly before his death last week, Cardinal Joseph Bernardin</B> completed a book about rediscovering the importance of prayer. <I>The Gift of Peace</I> will be published in January by Loyola Press. In it, Bernardin says that after lapsing in his prayer life for several years, he &quot;decided to give God the first hour of my day, no matter what, to be with Him in prayer and meditation where I would try to open the door even wider to His entrance.&quot; <P> <B>Gaylord Entertainment Co. will buy Word Records and Music</B> for $110 million from Thomas Nelson Inc., news reports said. Word's artists include Amy Grant, Shirley Caesar, Sandi Patty, Point of Grace, Petra, Jaci Velasquez, Anointed, and Crystal Lewis. Gaylords' other properties are cable networks The Nashville Network (TNN) and Country Music Television (CMT); the Grand Ole Opry; Opryland theme park; two television stations; and three radio stations. <P> <B>The Supreme Court of Canada rejected a demand by Jewish and Protestant </B>parents in Ontario to receive the same public funding for their schools as is given to Roman Catholic schools. The parents said the policy is an unconstitutional violation of their religious freedom and right to equality. But the court ruled that the constitution under which Canada was formed in 1867 guaranteed funding for Ontario's Catholic schools but not for any other religious groups in Ontario, according to Reuter news service. <P>   <P> <B>An American held on spy charges in North Korea might be coming home soon</B>. Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., will travel to North Korea next week in an attempt to bring home Evan Hunziker of Tacoma, Wash., who was arrested in August after crossing into North Korea from China. Hunziker's family said he went to China as a missionary and they are not sure how he ended up in North Korea. In 1994, Richardson negotiated the release of two U.S. helicopter pilots shot down over North Korea. <P> <B>Dutch theologian Jan Veenhof has been fired</B> by Calvin Seminary, where he had arrived this fall as a distinguished visiting professor of theology. The seminary's board of trustees dismissed Veenhof  for his pro-homosexual views, United Reformed News Service reported. Veenhof had been a parish pastor at a Swiss Reformed Church at Basel and a professor of theology at the Free University of Amsterdam, one of the most prestigious positions in the Christian Reformed denomination's &quot;mother church&quot; in the Netherlands.    </font></p>

An evangelist and musician from the former Soviet Union were featured at the nondenominational event. The crusade was held in a sports arena and conducted in the Russian language. Sacramento has a large population of evangelical Christians from the former Soviet Union. <P> <B>A new Christian is leading a peace campaign among gangs in Cape Town, South Africa. </B>Rashied Staggie -- who once led a 3,000-member gang that included murderers, thieves, and drug dealers -- is promoting peace and seeking government protection from anti-gang vigilante violence. <BR><B>...Vigilantes killed Staggie's twin brother, Rashaad</B>, on Aug. 4, news reports said. But after his brother's death,<B> </B>Rashied became a Christian and vowed not to take revenge. Staggie, who has been shot nine times and carries a concealed revolver, says God has called him to end gang violence. The newest tattoo on his back reads &quot;The Chosen.&quot; <P> <B>Some 30,000 people attended Franklin Graham's crusade in Farmington, N.M., Nov. 10-13</B>. Thousands of Native Americans came to the event, which was held on the border of the Navajo nation. Programs were translated into Navajo and Spanish. The crusade also featured performances by contemporary and country Christian bands. <P> <B>Poland's president signed an abortion law</B> giving women who are financially or emotionally unable to give birth the right to end their pregnancies until the 12th week. The law replaces Poland's strict anti-abortion statute. &quot;Conscience and not the fear of punishment meted out by the state should influence the people's decisions in the matter,&quot; said President Aleksander Kwasniewski. <P> <B>The British are accepting more sex in the media,</B> a poll showed. A majority of people said they would not object to sex scenes between a man and a woman in a movie if children are prevented from watching, Reuter news service said.  <BR><B>...Marijuana also is being viewed with greater approval</B>. In 14 years, public disapproval of smoking the drug has dropped to 58% from 82%, while those under 25 voted two-to-one in favor. Attitudes toward heroin remain hostile, with 86% saying it should remain illegal. <P> <B>Spain is the &quot;most sinful&quot; among 19 industrialized countries</B>, according to <I>Svensk Export Strategi</I>, a Swedish business journal. Prevalence of the seven &quot;modern deadly sins&quot; of smoking, drinking, drugs, gambling, over-eating, night life, and prostitution were considered in the rankings. <BR><B>...Spain is active in night life and gambling</B>, Reuter news service said. France ranked the second most sinful nation because of alcohol consumption, and the United States third because of drugs. Next were Great Britain and the Netherlands. The Nordic countries, Portugal, and Japan were judged least sinful. <P> <B>The World Council of Churches is considering major structural changes.</B> Among changes included in a WCC proposal is discontinuation of the WCC's assembly, which takes place every seven years and is the group's highest policy-making body. The assembly could be replaced by more frequent meetings of churches and ecumenical organizations, the group said. <BR><B>...The WCC said it wants the Roman Catholic Church and evangelical and Pentecostal bodies</B> to be more involved in the ecumenical movement. The WCC should &quot;repent of the ways we have sinned&quot; against evangelicals and Pentecostals &quot;through caricature or indifference,&quot; the WCC document said. <BR><B>...Earlier this year, the WCC suggested a gathering in Germany</B> among the main Christian traditions to start resolving issues -- including the primacy of the Pope -- dividing Christians. The WCC, which includes 330 member denominations such as the Anglican, Lutheran, Orthodox and other non-Roman Catholic churches, wants to eventually convene a universal Christian council. <BR><B>...To meet its financial crisis, the WCC is expected to discontinue some of its current programs</B> in favor of a smaller and more flexible central staff at its headquarters in Geneva. The group has more than 200 staff. <P> <B>The World Council of Churches is holding a conference with Moslem scholars in Tehran Friday</B>. The WCC said it hopes dialogue can create tolerance, understanding, and cooperation among people of different faiths &quot;in Iran and beyond.&quot; <P> <B>A conservative group is thinking about suspending or expelling the Christian Reformed denomination</B> because of its decision to ordain women. Meeting Nov. 19 and 20, the North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council voted to consider action against the Christian Reformed Church, which helped start NAPRC 21 years ago and is the organization's largest member. Any such action would require a two-thirds vote and approval within three years by two-thirds of the national synods or general assemblies of the seven member denominations, Christian Reformed News Service said.    </font></p>

Despite three decades of a  communist regime, Cuba still is deeply Catholic, with 40% of the island's residents practicing the faith. Even when the government shuts off electricity during the evening to conserve energy, Masses continue by candlelight. <BR><B>...Castro faces the risk that the Pope could become a rallying point</B> for opponents in and outside Cuba. Yet he wants the Pope's help in fighting a 34-year-old U.S. trade embargo. The Pope wants new Catholic schools, permission to send in priests from around the world, and the right to expand Catholic charity work on the island. When Castro first took power, he confiscated Church property, closed Church schools, and expelled hundreds of priests. <P> <B>The Ku Klux Klan sued a sheriff</B>, charging that his deputies tried to run Klansmen out of the country. The Christian Knights of the KKK and two leaders sued Hoyt Collins of Clarendon County, S.C., for $200,000 saying deputies threatened them, sent spies to meetings, and disrupted rallies. Former members of the group have been charged with burning black churches, the Associated Press said. <BR><B>...&quot;The people who have the worst things to say still have a right to say them,&quot;</B> said Gary White, attorney for the Klan group. Tom Turnipseed, lawyer for a church that was burned last year, said it was ridiculous for &quot;a terrorist organization that has done what they have done to people&quot; to complain about law enforcement. <P> <B>U.N. agencies and the Red Cross in Central Africa are giving &quot;morning after&quot; pills</B> and condoms to refugees as part of a family-planning campaign that includes care for women in childbirth or who have had miscarriages or self-induced abortions. The campaign was begun by organizations and charities, but a new $500,000 U.N.-funded program is being organized to coordinate efforts to assist Rwandan refugees returning home, as well as those still trapped in Zaire. <P> <B>The National Association of Evangelicals -- founded in 1942 in opposition</B> to the liberalism of the mainline denominations -- is improving relations with more liberal and moderate churches. Last week's address by NAE head Don Argue to the National Council of Churches was met by a standing ovation. Argue said he has developed a good relationship with NCC leader Joan Brown Campbell, working with her on causes such as religious liberty. <BR><B>...The NAE leader said he had no difficulty recognizing NCC leaders as fellow Christians,</B> he told Ecumenical Press International. The NAE, which includes 48 denominations, individual congregations from 10 other denominations, and more than 250 parachurch ministries and schools, does not include such prominent conservatives as Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson, ENI said. <BR><B>...&quot;I think it is very unfortunate that in the Christian Coalition, Pat Robertson has politicized</B> the words 'Christian' and 'evangelical,' &quot; Argue said. The NAE leader said he wanted to depoliticize the words and &quot;develop a position that is neither Republican nor Democratic.&quot; <P> <B>Some Russian broadcast frequencies, formerly used for government propaganda</B>, have been given free of charge to a British Christian broadcasting group. According to journalist Dan Wooding, United Christian Broadcasters of Europe, based in Hanchurch, Stoke on Trent, England, will use the frequencies to present Christian programming throughout Europe. The UCB signal is transmitted 24 hours a day on Astra Satellite with SKY Sports (channel 20) on audio sound frequency 7.56MHZ. <P> <B>The Church of England is considering buying shares in breweries</B> so it can exert more influence against under-age drinking, <I>The London Times</I> reported.    </font></p>

The Pope accepted Castro's invitation to visit Cuba next year.

Castro, 70, one of the world's last-remaining Marxist leaders, welcomes papal criticism of the U.S. embargo against Cuba.

Media were not allowed to be present during the meeting. <BR><B>...Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev met with the Pope on Monday,</B> his fourth visit to the Vatican since 1989.

Observers said the timing of the Pope's meetings with Castro and Gorbachev appeared to be deliberate, and that the Pope wanted to remind Castro that the Cuban system is bankrupt. <P> <B>More than 200 million people can hear Chuck Swindoll's <I>Insight for Living</I></B> Bible teaching in the Hindi language over Trans World Radio in India. Roger Kemp of <I>Insight for Living</I> said the lessons, broadcast five days a week, are helping Indians realize that Scripture can be understood and applied to their personal lives. The program is part of TWR-India's strategy that includes personal follow-up to those who write letters in response to the program. <P> <B>A Cincinnati church group that has been feeding expired parking meters</B> as part of a random-acts-of-kindness campaign now has a champion. Sylvia Stayton, a 62-year-old grandmother, has become a folk hero in the Ohio city after she was arrested Oct. 24 for putting 15 cents into two expired meters in order to spare drivers she didn't know from getting tickets. <BR><B>...Stayton was charged with violating an ordinance</B> intended to keep office workers from hogging storefront parking spaces. She also was charged with disorderly conduct, saying she screamed when the arresting officer put handcuffs on her and &quot;kept pulling my arm up.&quot; She faces up to four months in jail and $1,000 in fines. Stayton was on her way to court to file for bankruptcy when she put the three nickels in the meters. <BR><B>...The church group has printed T-shirts that read &quot;Sylvia Stayton...guilty of kindness.&quot;</B> <I>The Cincinnati Enquirer</I> published a cartoon of &quot;Cincinnati's 10 Most Wanted&quot; depicting Stayton along with people who yell &quot;Bingo&quot; prematurely. <P> <B>Focus on the Family is publishing a monthly newsletter to help parents and youth leaders</B> &quot;guide teens through the world of popular youth culture.&quot; The October issue of <I>Plugged In</I> contains articles and advice about popular music, video games, the Internet, movies, and drugs.      <P> <B>Four out of eight legally blind patients regained some sight</B> after undergoing a transplant of fetal eye cells, news reports said. A University of Rochester School of  Medicine and Dentistry researcher said the experimental treatment is the first to successfully improve the vision of patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa, a common cause of blindness in adults. <P> <B>Chinese officials in the city of Erzhou shut down 1,600 temples because of illegal religious activities</B> including fortune telling and ancestor worship, the Chinese newspaper <I>Guangming Daily</I> reported. Such activities weaken faith in science, squander farmland, and have wasted more than $732,000 in contributions, the publication said. <P> <B>A lawsuit is challenging the U.S. military's policy </B>of barring its chaplains from encouraging their constituents to lobby Congress on legislation, Baptist Press said. The Becket Fund, a nondenominational public-interest law firm in Washington, says directives issued by all three armed services interfere with the chaplains' rights to preach. <BR><B>...The controversy arose when Roman Catholic officials urged their chaplains</B> to join a campaign to speak out against partial-birth abortions and President Clinton's veto of a bill banning the procedure. The chaplains received memos from their superior officers prohibiting them from participating in the campaign or encouraging others to do so. <P> <B>An American nurse from Sacramento, Calif., is being held in Vietnam</B> for distributing pens with the Christian cross on them. Man Thi Jones, who was born in Vietnam but became naturalized 21 years ago, was arrested a month ago, according to Freedom House, a human rights group. <P>      </font></p>

</td><td width="470">&nbsp;<BR><table width="450"  align="center" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"><tr><td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 18, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Tens of thousands of Romanians knelt and recited the Lord's Prayer in Bucharest</B> today at the request of the country's new, non-communist president. Challenger Emil Constantinescu defeated President Ion Iliescu Sunday in a runoff that gave the eastern European nation its first non-communist government. &quot;I'm here to tell you I will never betray you,&quot; Constantinescu told the crowd from a balcony, then appealed to them to pray with him. The vote completed a democratic and peaceful revolution in the country. <P> <B>The Salvation Army holds Sunday school classes for children in a supermarket</B> in Maidstone, England. Classes, which started Sept. 29 in a Tesco store, were packed, according to DAWN FridayFax. Meetings are held in a training room with space for 30 children. They feature an hour of songs, drawings, videos, and biblical stories. The Salvation Army advertises the class with the slogan, &quot;If you won't come to church, we'll bring the church to you!&quot; <P> <B>Four hundred teen-agers attended a sexual abstinence conference in Alzey, Germany</B>, Oct. 20. The True Love Waits meeting included testimonies and discussions, DAWN FridayFax said. Michael Muller, German coordinator for the movement, said people are amazed that teen-agers would avoid sex before marriage and make vows of abstinence. Muller has been flooded with interviews on radio and television. True Love Waits began several years ago in the Southern Baptist Convention and has spread to many countries. <P> <B>President Clinton spoke about his faith </B>in the December issue of <I>George</I>, a new magazine published by John Kennedy, Jr. Interviewed aboard Air Force One during the campaign, Clinton said he prays for guidance and considers biblical teachings. <BR><B>...&quot;First, if I have a really difficult decision and am not sure</B> what the right thing to do is, I pray for guidance, wisdom, some sense of insight that goes beyond my ability to think it through,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;Secondly, I've learned over time that one of the consequences of trying to live by a religious faith is that you have a conscience, and I try not to do anything that I don't believe in -- even if it seemed like the thing to do at the time.&quot; <BR><B>...Clear biblical teaching often is available on specific issues</B>, Clinton said. &quot;If you take the welfare reform example, there are hundreds of references in the Bible about our obligations to minister to the poor, to treat the poor with dignity and respect, not to hurt the poor.&quot; <BR><B>...Clinton said he believes abortion is &quot;unacceptable except in cases where the mother's life or health</B> is in danger or there's some severe problem that would prevent the child from even being a functioning person or there's an incest problem or something like that.&quot;   <BR><B>...&quot;The Bible does condemn homosexual conduct</B>, particularly in the Old Testament,&quot; he said. &quot;But in the New Testament, Christ always made a big distinction between the sin and the sinner. Christ condemned divorce far more harshly. There are explicit condemnations of divorce, and [references to] remarriage as adultery, that are unambiguous -- far more unambiguous than the reference made about abortion or homosexuality. But we don't deny divorced people the right to have jobs or enter into public service.&quot; Clinton said that &quot;just because people have committed sins, if they're good citizens, if they obey the law, if they show up every day and behave themselves, they should not be subject to unfair discrimination.&quot; <P> <B>The owner of a nude nightclub in conservative San Diego County has won a $200,000 court award</B> after charging police and bureaucrats with trying to run his business out of town. Elbert Poppell, 62, had been criticized by ministers and homeowners who said he tried to corrupt their community. In his lawsuit, Poppell charged that officials ran a campaign to harass and intimidate him and his customers. <BR><B>...Police repeatedly parked in front of Poppell's business with their car lights flashing</B> in an attempt to discourage potential customers, news reports said. Poppell said police wrote a large number of parking tickets around the nightclub and questioned customers. Police prevented Poppell from opening a nude church and closed down his other nude clubs because of prostitution, news reports said. <P>     <P> <B>A church service to commemorate 20 years of the Lesbian and Gay Christian movement in England </B>drew 2,000 people in Southwark Cathedral in London<B> </B>Saturday. It was the first Anglican cathedral service in Britain specifically for homosexuals. <BR><B>...The service provoked protests from conservative churchgoers</B> across Britain. Protesters outside the cathedral waved banners saying &quot;Sodomy and lesbianism -- a perversion to be repented, not an orientation to be celebrated&quot; and &quot;The wages of sin is death,&quot; news reports said. <P> <B>A Christian man who was scheduled to be flogged for marrying a Muslim woman</B> has converted to Islam, Reuter news service said. Elie Dib Ghalib, 30, who is Lebanese, had been sentenced to 39 lashes and a year in prison by the United Arab Emirates. An Islamic court there ruled his marriage was invalid and the relationship immoral. Amnesty International said it was concerned by reports of the impending lashing, that Ghalib was being held because of his Christianity, and that he allegedly has been tortured. Whether Ghalib now will escape punishment is uncertain, news reports said. <P> <B>A Springfield, Mo., woman won a $1 million lawsuit against a church and a Christian counselor. </B>Beth Rutherford, 23, of Tulsa, Okla., sued Donna Strand, the counselor at Park Crest Village Assembly of God church, and her husband, pastor Robert Strand. <BR><B>...During counseling sessions, Strand reportedly taught Rutherford how to enter a trance-like state</B> through self-hypnosis. Under the counselor's guidance, Rutherford recalled that her minister father supposedly raped her, got her pregnant, then performed a painful coat-hanger abortion, the Associated Press said. But Beth was still a virgin, according to medical tests, and her father had a vasectomy many years before. <BR><B>...Rutherford's parents had no knowledge of their daughter's allegations </B>until after the Strands informed the General Council of the Assemblies of God, where Tom Rutherford worked, news reports said. Tom Rutherford said he was confronted with the allegations, forced to resign, and lost many friends before doctors proved the allegations were false. <BR><B>...Beth Rutherford said she does not know where the thoughts came from</B>, but, &quot;I can tell you one thing for sure, they did not come from my mind. There are times in my therapy sessions that I have no memory of what happened.&quot; The Rutherfords said they will use the award to travel around the country warning people of the dangers of  &quot;recovered memory therapy.&quot;    </font></p>

Lusi instructed his remaining staff to tell the patients' family members to bring water. For firewood, he ordered people to burn doors from the operating room. For seven days, the hospital was the only one in Goma remaining in operation.  <BR><B>...Lusi has served Hutu refugees in the Goma camps since 1994</B>, after the Rwandan genocide sent tens of thousands of people fleeing to the Rwanda-Zaire border.  <P> <B>Scripture is unclear about salvation apart from Christ</B>, according to the controversial pastor of the fourth-largest church of the Reformed Church in America.<B> </B>Richard Rhem of Christ Community Church in Spring Lake, Mich., said he questions &quot;salvation is through Jesus Christ alone,&quot; according to United Reformed News Service. <BR><B>...If salvation is only through Jesus Christ, &quot;I don't know what to do with the Jewish believers</B> <B>I </B>have become so fond of,&quot; Rhem said, delivering the keynote speech at the RCA's Nov. 9 Regional Synod of the Mid-Atlantics. <BR><B>...The Bible includes some clear teaching on salvation through Christ</B>, but that would have been expected given its context as a book of proclamation, Rhem said. &quot;I don't think we should try to whitewash this book and say there is no possibility of constructing an exclusivist view of the church; the only thing I would argue is [that] this is not the only voice.&quot; There was a &quot;strong strain of universalism&quot; in the early church, he noted. <BR><B>...Rhem said he does not believe in blending religions</B> into &quot;some new kind of mush,&quot; but that people should select a religion and follow it without believing that it is the only means to salvation. <BR><B>...A group of 219 conservative Christian Reformed ministers</B>, elders, and deacons asked the denomination to allow conservative opponents of women's ordination to form a group within the CRC. The conservatives said they want to avoid more secession in the denomination, which has lost nearly 8% of its members since 1993. <P> <B>The Anglican Synod of the Diocese of Sydney today voted against ordaining women as priests.</B> The synod also registered its opposition to pending legislation that could allow same-sex couples to adopt children. <P> <B>A Pennsylvania woman apparently bleeds as she speaks about Christ</B>. Mary Ellen Lukas, a devout Catholic from Hazleton, is said to be a stigmatic, with sores in her hands, feet, and side that mimic Christ's wounds on the cross. During an interview, bright red beads appeared on Lukas' forehead and ran down her face as she spoke of Christ, according to <I>The Wilkes BarreTimes-Leader</I>. The stigmata have drawn thousands of people to Lukas' healing services in Ireland and the Philippines. The Vatican appointed a priest to investigate Lukas' case, the Associated Press said. <P> <B>The United Methodist Church is undertaking an extensive, long-range evangelistic effort in Russia</B>. Since the end of communism, 34 UMC congregations have been established in Russia and other parts of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Ecumenical News International reported. The congregations are organized into the Eurasia Annual Conference led by a bishop in Moscow. UMC evangelistic and humanitarian programs have begun in 38 other places in Russia and other CIS states. <BR><B>...Also under way is a &quot;partner churches&quot; program</B>, in which 31 congregations in the United States are providing help to Russian communities without establishing a UMC presence there. The Methodist Church of Korea also is establishing churches in former Soviet states. <BR><B>...Potential friction between the UMC and the Russian Orthodox Church in Russia is lessened</B> because the UMC has been working with the Russian Orthodox Church in the World Council of Churches and other settings. <P> <B>What is thought to be the first international school in China sponsored by a church body</B> is being planned by the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod. The denomination plans to open the school in Beijing or Shanghai next fall, LCMS News reported. It would be modeled after the synod's Hong Kong International School. <BR><B>...The school would cater to the children of expatriates working in China</B>, including Asians from Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, Korea, Thailand, and India as well as North Americans and Europeans. Initially, the school would offer English-language classes in Grades K-6, with an American, Christian curriculum. Additional grades, up to 12, will be added later. <P> <B>A religious court in the United Arab Emirates sentenced Elie Dib Ghalib, a Lebanese Christian</B>, to a year in jail and 39 lashes for marrying a Muslim woman, Amnesty International said. The court ruled the marriage between Ghalib and UAE citizen Mona Junaidi was void. Amnesty said Ghalib has been beaten and flogged many times since his arrest. Under Islamic law in force in the UAE, a Muslim woman is not allowed to marry a non-Muslim unless the man converts to Islam.    </font></p>

Bernardin, leader of the Chicago archdiocese, died 11 weeks after announcing that the pancreatic cancer he had been diagnosed with a year earlier had returned. On Wednesday, he had spoken on the phone to the pope and the president while family and friends sat at his bedside. <BR><B>...Bernardin led the nation's second-largest Catholic diocese during difficult changes</B> after the Second Vatican Council. Taking over the diocese from authoritarian Cardinal John Cody, Bernardin earned a reputation as a strong voice for social justice and a conciliator, <I>The Chicago Tribune</I> said. <BR><B>...He was involved in controversy, forcing the closure of some Catholic schools</B> and disagreeing with conservative priests over women's rights within the church. In 1993, Bernardin was accused of sexually abusing a pre-seminary student 16 years earlier. His accuser later recanted, and Bernardin publicly reconciled with him. <BR><B>...When it became clear that surgery could not stop Bernardin's cancer,</B> he followed Pope John Paul's advice to &quot;offer your suffering for the world.&quot; Bernardin described his impending death as a friend that should be greeted, not an enemy. This week Bernardin sent a letter to the U.S. Supreme Court asking the justices not to find that terminally ill people have a constitutional right to doctor-assisted suicide. <P> <B>Christian marriage-and-family seminars are becoming popular in Cuba</B>. Churches have received good responses when inviting people, who are eager for solutions to the communist nation's domestic problems, World Team's Paul Shattock told Mission Network News. Things people have trusted in such as education, the Communist Party, and the economy &quot;have fallen flat on their face,&quot; he said. &quot;You only have two options now in Cuba, despair or Christ.&quot; <BR><B>...The evangelical church is getting encouragement </B>from the government, which wants pastors to deal with increasingly prevalent family problems, MNN said.  <P> <B>England lifted some restrictions on gambling</B>, allowing casinos to open in 20 new cities and resort towns. Casinos can operate slot machines with unlimited stakes and payouts, <I>The London Times</I> said. Up to 100 machines would be allowed in the largest casino in London. Casino operators also will be allowed for the first time to advertise in non-national publications. <P> <B>Some supporters of same-sex marriage in the state of Hawaii were voted out of office</B> in last week's election, Intercessors For America said.  This improves the possibility of the Hawaii House and Senate passing an amendment protecting traditional marriage. The new legislative session begins in January. <P> <B>The Episcopal Diocese of Long Island began an independent investigation</B> into allegations of sexual misconduct, Episcopal News Service said. Two Brazilian men have alleged that William Lloyd Andries, rector of St. Gabriel's Church in Brooklyn, brought them to the United States to be sexual partners for a group of  homosexual and bisexual clergy. According to <I>Penthouse</I> magazine, the Brazilian men say the priests used drugs and held orgies in St. Gabriel's. Andries, who has denied many of the allegations, has resigned from St. Gabriel's and is under discipline, ENS said. <BR><B>...Thirty-five bishops signed a statement blaming the events in Long Island on lax standards</B> in the Episcopal Church.  <P> <B>Kathy and Tom Lindquist, an American couple with the Berean Mission, were unable to leave Bukavu</B>, Zaire, when the fighting began, according to Marge Crumbley, Kathy's mother. The couple has been in Bukavu while soldiers were taking the city, she told Mission Network News. Three of the Lindquist children are safe in the bush area, said Crumley, who has been receiving email from people in Kigali. <P> <B>Christians in the United States, Australia, Canada, England and Holland</B> are participating in the fourth annual Operation Christmas Child sponsored by Samaritan's Purse. The volunteers hope to assemble half a million shoe boxes filled with school supplies for distribution to children in 28 countries. A copy of the Christmas story from Luke 2 is included in each shoebox. <P> <B>The newly formed National Institute on Media and the Family</B> is developing an evaluation system for television shows, movies, video games, and computer games. The institute, located in Minneapolis, is independent of major broadcasters. It evaluates products for appropriateness for age groups by observing violent and sexual content, whether vulgar or sexually explicit language is used, and whether characters are respectful, responsible, and caring. Find it on the Internet at: <A HREF=http://www.mediaandthefamily.org>www.mediaandthefamily.org</A>. <P> <B>Broadcaster Bill Moyers, a Baptist minister, criticized the conservative faction of the Southern Baptist Convention</B> for clinging to a literal interpretation of the Bible. Speaking in Fort Worth to 1,700 people at the Baptist General Convention of  Texas, Moyers described their belief system as &quot;less a set of ideas than it is a pathological distemper, a militant anger over the fact that the universe is not closed and life is not static.&quot;    </font></p>

Speaking in Rome at the World Food Summit, the pope blamed food shortages on political instability, war, money spent on weapons, and an international debt that impedes developing countries. The Pope called on world leaders to take radical measures to tackle hunger, including canceling the debts of developing countries. He urged leaders to bridge the &quot;intolerable contrast&quot; between rich and poor. <BR><B>...Food production must increase 75% in the next 30 years</B> to cover additional needs from the planet's growing population, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, which is hosting the summit. The meeting is being held amid the sufferings of a million refugees caught in warfare in eastern Zaire.  <P> <B>Socialism must take precedence over religion, Chinese authorities said</B>, promising to restrain Buddhism in Tibet. In the Himalayan region, monks outnumber students and more money is spent on monasteries than on Communist Party buildings, according to the official <I>Tibet Daily</I>. &quot;Further development of  temples, monks, and nuns cannot be without restrictions,&quot; the publication said. <BR><B>...In recent years, China has shut temples in Tibet</B> to stop the influence of the region's spiritual god-king, the Dalai Lama. He fled to India in 1959 after an unsuccessful uprising against communist rule. <P> <B>Carl Hunziker, an American being held in North Korea on spy charges, is in good physical health but in very low spirits</B>, the State Department said Tuesday. The report came from Swedish diplomat Ake Lafquist, who visited Hunziker last week, Reuters news service said. Hunziker, described by his family as a missionary, was arrested in North Korea Aug. 24 after entering from China. United Press International said U.S. officials suspect Hunziker may be suffering from a psychological disorder. <P> <B>An Assemblies of God congregation in Illinois experienced a summer of revival</B>. Special services that began May 26 at Urbana Assembly of God lasted until September. A total of 873 people made salvation decisions and 667 were &quot;filled with the Holy Spirit,&quot; the denomination said. More than 125 pastors from churches of various denominations across the Midwest visited the revival meetings. The speaker was Mobile, Ala., evangelist Joey Hipp. <BR><B>...Many people reportedly were healed of physical ailments during the services</B>. Several people who were scheduled to have tumors surgically removed found the tumors had disappeared; one man with chronic back pain was completely healed; a boy with asthma no longer needed his inhaler; and a girl with 90% hearing loss in one ear recovered her hearing, the church said. <BR><B>...Pastor Gary Grogan said his university town was in great need of revival</B>. Citing state statistics, Grogan said Champaign County had the lowest church attendance per capita of any county in the state, with only 7.4% attending a church or synagogue on any given weekend. Satanists are active in the area and there is a small witches' coven, he said. <P> <B>The Clinton administration has urged the Supreme Court to rule that states may ban doctor-assisted suicide</B>. The Justice Department filed two friend-of-the-court briefs Tuesday asking the justices to reinstate laws in New York and Washington that banned doctors from prescribing fatal drugs for terminally ill but mentally competent people who want to die. <P> <I><B>Touched By An Angel</B></I><B>, a CBS-TV program praised by religious groups</B>, is the eighth most-watched show on television, according to prime-time ratings compiled by Nielsen Media Research for Nov. 4-10. Last week's show reached 14.7 million homes.    </font></p>

Film studios are recutting movies, removing scenes, and changing video boxes -- often without the director's consent -- so Blockbuster will put the videos on its shelves, <I>The Times</I> said.  <P> <B>Prayer and hard work were heavyweight boxer Evander Holyfield's formula</B> for defeating heavily favored WBA champion Mike Tyson. Holyfield said he battled discouragement while training to fight the powerful Tyson. &quot;I prayed during training. I prayed when I got into the ring. I prayed when I was fighting him. I realized what I'd be facing. I knew I'd have to pray to be in there with the man,&quot; Holyfield said. <BR><B>...Holyfield, who has proclaimed his Christian faith on a number of occasions</B>, sang a gospel tune in the dressing room before the fight, leading his staff in &quot;joyous, revival-style celebration,&quot; <I>USA Today</I> said. Stitched on Holyfield's robe and trunks was Philippians 4:13, &quot;I can do all things in Him who strengthens me.&quot; Holyfield remained calm and steady in the ring -- almost as if he had won the fight in the dressing room, one observer said. <P>   <P> <B>Jerry Falwell's Liberty University came up with $1.1 million to pay bondholders,</B> averting a threat to foreclose on the school's Lynchburg, Va., campus. It was the second time in four years bondholders had threatened to sell the school's assets to satisfy its semi-annual payment. Bondholders are feeling &quot;a very high level of frustration and mistrust,&quot; representative Claude Ferebee told The Associated Press.  <BR><B>...The bonds were issued in the 1980s by Falwell's <I>Old-Time Gospel Hour</I> television program</B> to finance Liberty's expansion. But the school struggled to pay its debts when viewer donations dropped after scandals involving other television evangelists. Bondholders say they are owed $20 million and have refused Liberty's offer of $7.5 million to pay off the bonds. <P> <B>Aid workers were in rebel-held Goma, Zaire, today, but distribution of a small amount of food</B> and medicine was delayed by long talks between aid agency officials and rebel leaders. The aid remained in seven trucks under rebel guard at a football stadium. The aid workers entered from Rwanda despite Zaire's assertion that they were violating its sovereignty. <BR><B>...The United Nations refugee agency said it would start flying relief supplies</B> within days. Canada offered to lead a multinational force to help end the crisis and bring relief to the more than one million Hutu refugees. South African President Nelson Mandela also said he was ready to send troops to Central Africa. The United States said it had still not seen a coherent plan for assembling an international force. <P> <B>Ultra-Orthodox Jewish men shouted in anger and threw a folding chair at a group of Reform Judaism women praying at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. </B>The women were challenging traditional ultra-Orthodox control of prayers at the Wall, and the men were angry that they wore skullcaps and brought Torahs. The women want the right to pray anywhere along the wall, a remnant of the temple destroyed in A.D. 70. Presently, the Wall is divided into separate sections for men and women, who are forbidden to pray together. Women are not allowed to read directly from the Torah at the Wall or wear prayer shawls there. <P> <B>A Church of the Brethren congregation barred a lesbian from attending services </B>after she married a male transsexual, The Associated Press said. Debi Easterday, who had attended Medina, Ohio, Church of the Brethren, for four years, was escorted off the property Sunday by a police officer. <BR><B>...&quot;No one has the right to tell me where I can go to hear God's word,&quot;</B> Easterday said. The denomination, which welcomes anyone who believes in Jesus but doesn't condone relationships between homosexuals, said it was &quot;deeply saddened that despite our initial acceptance, love, generosity and prayers, Debi remains unrepentant and seeks to mock God.&quot; <P>   <P> <B>U.S. Catholic bishops, meeting in Washington, D.C., defended the requirement of celibacy for priests.</B> &quot;There is no greater sign of hope in the Lord than to believe that serving Him is worth sacrificing the most truly human of all joys -- marriage and family,&quot; Cleveland Bishop Anthony Pilla said. Scandals involving priests in the last few years have called the idea of celibacy into questions, but most Catholics do not judge the priesthood by the behavior of a few individuals, Pilla said. The Church weathered a far more severe shortage of priests in the 14th century when a plague devastated Europe, the bishops said. <BR><B>...A group of about 50 Catholics conducted a prayer vigil</B> outside the hotel where the bishops met. The We Are Church Coalition, based in Fairfax, Va., called for optional celibacy for clergy, ordination of women, and lay participation in selection of pastors and bishops.    </font></p>

Neighboring Rwanda agreed on Sunday to let food and medicine be brought into Goma, but permission still was being sought from rebels that control the Zairean town. <BR><B>...Even if relief convoys enter Goma, it remained doubtful</B> whether they could reach many of the 1 million refugees, who are scattered across eastern Zaire. The refugees are widely feared to be dying by the thousands.  <BR><B>...The U.N.'s Security Council decided on Saturday to deploy a multinational force</B> to ensure the safety of humanitarian relief deliveries. But the U.N.'s failure to state when or how it should go in was greeted with anger by relief agencies. <P> <B>Some people are using their Christmas holidays to do volunteer work.</B> Various organizations offer opportunities over the holidays for human-service, construction, and environmentally oriented work. Churches also place people in service projects. For example, the Heifer Project International, which donates livestock and expertise in 110 countries, welcomes volunteers at its International Learning and Livestock Center in Perryville, Ark., to care for animals or help construct buildings. <BR><B>...Motivations for taking a &quot;volunteer vacation&quot; vary</B>. Some people are trying to avoid the commercialism of Christmas. Others escape holiday loneliness. Many find the work makes their Christmas more significant and meaningful, reports said. <P> <B>British society may be on the verge of disintegration, church leaders warned</B>. The decline in church attendance is linked to the breakdown of family life and traditional moral values, they said. Even practicing Christians hold New Age beliefs, evidence that society is in danger of losing its Judeo-Christian roots, according to a report by the mainstream churches. In Britain, 70% of people say they believe in God, but only 14% go to church. <BR><B>...&quot;Civilizations have broken up in the past and we cannot be complacent</B> that ours will not,&quot; Michael Nazir-Ali, chairman of the group that produced the report, told <I>The London Times</I>. He said the report was a challenge to churches to lower barriers separating them from the community. The report cited the need for a renewed Christian orthodoxy as a &quot;common language about ultimate values and beliefs.&quot; <P> <B>A proposed tax cut in Germany could mean financial disaster for the country's churches</B>. Church tax, which is collected by the state authorities, is a percentage of church members' income tax, so cuts in income tax lead automatically to reductions in church tax. According to Ecumenical News International, the Protestant and Catholic denominations each receive $5 billion a year in church tax; an 11% tax cut is being proposed. A number of politicians are questioning whether church tax should be maintained in its present form. <P> <B>The Southern Baptist Convention has distributed nearly $700,000 to help churches victimized by arsonists,</B> Baptist Press reported. In addition, Southern Baptist construction crews are volunteering to rebuild the burned churches. Donations to the SBC Arson Fund may be sent directly to state Baptist convention offices or the SBC Executive Committee, 901 Commerce St., Nashville, TN 37203.  <P> <B>Charity tax breaks have enabled the Russian Orthodox Church to import millions of dollars worth of duty-free cigarettes</B> and buy a share in an oil exporting business that is expected to make $2 billion this year, <I>The Moscow Times</I> newspaper reported.  <P> <B>Dueling Christmas parades are planned in Key West, Fla.</B> The city will sponsor one parade, but a rival parade will be held on a different day by the Lower Keys Ministerial Association, a coalition of 15 conservative pastors. The ministerial group excluded the largely homosexual Metropolitan Community Church from its parade. The city has a large, politically organized homosexual population.  <P> <B>Military veterans having trouble finding their place in society are becoming homeless</B>, a Christian charitable group said. The International Union of Gospel Missions said one in every three homeless men at its shelters is a veteran. Men discharged recently from a shrinking military are joining troubled Vietnam veterans among the homeless, the group said.    </font></p>

Thirteen football players at Boston College, a Roman Catholic school, were suspended from competition recently for gambling on college and professional sports. Two face charges of betting against their own team. Even before the revelations at B.C., other colleges already had begun to curb sports betting, <I>The Monitor</I> said. <P> <B>The Anglican Church is preparing to replace its 900-year-old open-court system for clergy discipline</B> with secret tribunals. A report said clergy are upset at the &quot;washing of the church's dirty linen in public,&quot; <I>The London Times</I> said. The courts, which date back to William the Conqueror, would be replaced with tribunals that publish their decisions but withhold detailed evidence. <P> <B>Christians who once stayed away from a festival they considered to be pagan, now are working to transform it.</B> For the second year, Christians in Campbelltown, southwest of  Sydney, Australia, marched in the annual Fisher's Ghost parade. The Festival of  Fisher's Ghost began with a local story about a murder, an execution, and a returning ghost. The 300 Christians from 20 churches marched under the banner of the Christian Churches of Campbelltown, carrying balloons as a symbol of hope and life. At the end of the parade, they held a Family Fun Festival for everyone in the community. <P> <B>The Anglican Church will replace Rwandan bishops who remain in exile, afraid to return</B> to their homeland because they fear reprisals. Some clergy have been accused of complicity in massacres that occurred in Rwanda. Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey said he has been unable to persuade the bishops to return. Anglicans say they wonder how a church without leaders can minister effectively. <P> <B>Billy Graham will present a television special about peace this Christmas</B>. <I>A Season For Peace</I> will be aired in North America Dec. 3 and in 150 countries and territories in 33 languages during the rest of December. &quot;All over our world, people are beginning to realize that in their quest for peace, what they are really searching for is God,&quot; Graham said. <P> <B>Episcopal parishes in the United States are helping resettle 417 Iraqi Kurdish refugees</B> who are fleeing from Saddam Hussein. The refugees are part of a group of 2,200 Kurds airlifted out of Iraq by the U.S. military after missile strikes in Iraq. The 20 million Kurds living in Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria are considered the world's largest minority group without a country of their own. <P>   <P> <B>Two Baylor University administrators have been demoted</B> for derogatory remarks about the school's president, Robert Sloan. Michael Bishop, chairman of the Journalism Department, and Henry Walbesser, graduate school dean, were removed from their administrative posts Oct. 30 by Sloan, Associated Baptist Press reported. Both remain on the faculty of the Baptist school in Waco, Texas. Sloan also recently fired Baylor's chaplain, Bill Austin, after a dispute with administrators. <BR><B>...Several newspapers have dealt with controversy over Sloan's actions</B>. Since becoming Baylor president 18 months ago, Sloan, a Baptist minister, has made church participation a top priority in hiring faculty, leading critics to predict he will turn the nation's largest Baptist university into a Bible college. Sloan was criticized by conservatives early in his administration for allowing dancing on campus. <P> <B>Christian Path, an evangelical political party in Nicaragua, will play a role</B> as power-broker after winning six seats in the national assembly during elections Oct. 20. One of the two major parties -- the Liberal Alliance and the Sandinista Front -- will need the support of the Christian Path to form a government. Christian Path, or Camino Cristiano, is led by Guillermo Osorno, a former Assemblies of God pastor and former director of Nicaragua's most popular evangelical radio station. <P> <B>Some evangelical pastors in Malawi, Africa, are accepting bribes</B> from the Muslim-led government to stop evangelizing, Mission Network News said. Because poverty is so severe, they are selling out the Gospel for financial gain. <P> <B>Ultra-Orthodox Jews have asked airlines to provide flights to and from Israel that would not compromise &quot;modesty and holiness,&quot;</B> Evangelical Press said. The flights would not have movies, and male flight attendants would serve male passengers. El Al airline already provides kosher meals and bans flights on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. <P> <B>Churches and synagogues in Massachusetts are experiencing a large increase in religious school enrollment,</B> the Associated Press said. Religious leaders attribute the jump in attendance to an increase in the birth rate in the 1990s and the desire of parents to give children a moral foundation.    </font></p>

As a result, the U.S. House and Senate next year will have more Republican lawmakers who are members of conservative Protestant churches in the South's Bible Belt. <BR><B>...The Republican Party has two new U.S. senators in the South,</B> Alabama Attorney General John Sessions and Arkansas Republican Tim Hutchinson. They defeated Democrats after appealing to Christian conservative voters on social issues such as abortion. Republicans lost 16 House seats in the North, but gained new conservative members in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas. <BR><B>...The Christian Coalition said it helped keep Republicans in control of Congress</B>. The group, which distributed 45 million voter guides, said it was instrumental in producing a turnout of conservative Christians that was a record for a presidential election. More than one in four voters nationwide was a self-described born-again Christian, the group said. <BR><B>...Conservative evangelicals were the &quot;firewall that prevented a Bob Dole defeat from mushrooming</B> into a meltdown all the way down the ballot,&quot; coalition leader Ralph Reed said. Despite Dole's loss to President Clinton, the Republican Party increased its 53-47 Senate majority by at least one. The party's 235-197 majority in the House of Representatives was expected to shrink by at least nine seats. <P> <B>For the first time, Ukraine's president will meet with evangelical Christian leaders</B> from other countries. Mission Network News reported that President Leonid Kutchma has invited the leaders next week to the Parliament building. Evangelicals are a minority that have &quot;a very hard time&quot; in Ukraine, and that makes the upcoming meeting an &quot;exciting, unbelievable situation,&quot; said Mikhail Morgulis of Christian Bridge. Morgulis said evangelicals want to cooperate with the government in education, medicine, and humanitarian aid. He said he hopes to introduce Ukraine's leader to the gospel. <P> <B>The Chicago Archdiocese is adamant that a nightclub change its logo</B>, which it calls insulting, <I>The Chicago Sun Times</I> said. The logo -- which features a glowing, bleeding heart wrapped in thorns -- is similar to the Catholic Sacred Heart of God symbol representing the love of Christ for the church. Cardinal Joseph Bernardin called the nightclub logo &quot;an affront to religious expression and belief.&quot; <P> <B>The government of Singapore has set guidelines to regulate political and religious content on the Internet and keep it free of pornography</B>. But members of Parliament question whether a portion of the guidelines aims to stifle political discussion. The government will not allow discussion on the Internet that &quot;tends to bring the government into hatred or contempt, or which excites disaffection against the government,&quot; the guidelines state. Failure to observe the guidelines can result in a fine or cancellation of the license allowing individuals to use the Internet. <P> <B>Malaysia seized watches, toys, key chains, coin boxes</B> and stationery inspired by the Power Rangers children's television show. Authorities from the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry said the show's catch-phrase, &quot;it's morphin time,&quot; could encourage children to use drugs. The items were confiscated from 34 shops in a two-day nationwide operation. Malaysia has drug laws that require the death penalty for those caught with certain quantities of heroin or marijuana. <P> <B>North Korea said it is willing to release Evan Hunziker</B> of Tacoma, Wash., for &quot;humanitarian considerations,&quot; Reuters news service reported. Hunziker was arrested Aug. 24 after crossing China's Yalu River into North Korea, and has been charged as a spy for South Korea. The U.S. and South Korean governments deny that Hunziker, who has been transferred from a hotel to a jail, is a spy. Hunziker's family said he went to China as a missionary and they don't know how he ended up in North Korea. <P> <B>The founder of La Salle University correspondence school in Monroe, La., pleaded guilty</B> on Wednesday to fraud and tax evasion, news reports said. Thomas J. Kirk II of Madisonville, La., faces five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. Sentencing is scheduled for January. <BR><B>...In September, Kirk and the school, which is called World Christian Church,</B> were indicted on charges of tax evasion and conspiracy to commit mail fraud and credit card fraud. According to the indictment, Kirk established the school under the name World Christian Church to avoid government regulation, then set up the Washington, D.C.-based Council on Post-Secondary Christian Education to give the school the appearance of legitimacy. The accreditation agency was a shell corporation controlled by the school, the indictment said. <BR><B>...Under the settlement, the school agreed to bar Kirk</B> from acting as an officer and stop making claims that it is accredited. The school also agreed to forfeit Kirk's $1.5 million mansion and $10.75 million in cash that the government seized.    </font></p>

</td><td width="470">&nbsp;<BR><table width="450"  align="center" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"><tr><td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 6, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>A British medical charity issued a stark warning that refugee camps</B> in eastern Zaire could become scenes of genocidal massacres in the next few days. John Howarth of the charity Merlin said hundreds of thousands of people are crammed into the camps. <BR><B>...Food also is in short supply.</B> &quot;A severe human catastrophe&quot; is unfolding<B>,</B> said a spokesperson for Action by Churches Together, a worldwide network of churches that coordinate emergency response. &quot;I'm afraid a lot of people are going to die&quot; and there is &quot;very little, if anything, we can do about it,&quot; said Richard Oaten of the Lutheran World Federation. Humanitarian agencies can only observe the situation and try to raise emergency resources, ACT said. <BR><B>...Since mid-September, a minor conflict in Eastern Zaire has escalated into open warfare</B> between the Zaire military and the ethnic Tutsi people known as Banyamulenge. <P> <B>People lined the streets to applaud as a group of 60 Christian &quot;peace walkers&quot;</B> wearing T-shirts proclaiming <I>We Apologize</I> in Turkish marched through Istanbul, <I>YWAM News</I> said. The procession ended the first leg of a 1,500-mile, four-year effort to build bridges between Christians, Muslims, and Jews. The journey, which began in Cologne, Germany, last Easter, retraces the steps of the Medieval Crusades, often considered the root of centuries of conflict between the religions. <BR><B>...The walkers had passed through Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, and Bulgaria</B> on their way to the Turkish capital. Another team of walkers, following one of the other main routes of the Crusades, arrived in Istanbul in late August. The Walk is due to end in Jerusalem in 1999 with an event marking the 900th anniversary of the fall of the city to the Crusaders. Up to two million Muslims and Jews are expected to hear the reconciliation statement in the next two years. <P> <B>A dispute between groups working to bring the French abortion pill to American women</B> may delay the drug's availability, <I>The New York Times</I> said. On Monday, the nonprofit Population Council, which holds the U.S. rights to mifepristone, and the nonprofit Advances in Health Technology, established to educate doctors about the drug, filed a lawsuit. They went to court against Joseph D. Pike, who was chosen by the council to raise money to manufacture and distribute mifepristone. <BR><B>...The suit charges Pike with fraud</B>. It says he has not accounted for all the money invested and has put some money into a &quot;previously unknown entity&quot; whose name has been changed four times in the last 18 months. The suit seeks to have Pike's interest in the drug transferred to a receiver, who would then sell it. Pike was disbarred for forgery in a 1985 North Carolina real estate deal and had been given a suspended two-year sentence, news reports said. <BR><B>...Roussel Uclaf, the French manufacturer of mifepristone, refused to bring the drug to market</B> in the United States because of concerns over anti-abortion boycotts and product-liability lawsuits. In 1994, Roussel Uclaf gave its American rights to the Population Council, which last year chose Pike to handle it.  <P> <B>A week of prayer, fasting, and special services Oct. 27-Nov. 3 has stirred renewal</B> among Southern Baptist churches nationwide, Baptist Press reported. The special week was inspired last June by Arkansas pastor Ronnie Floyd during his sermon at the Southern Baptist Convention's annual meeting in New Orleans. Pastors said they anticipate the week's impact will continue as people take on prayer and fasting as a way of life. Many people reportedly experienced &quot;a touch from God&quot; during the week, BP said. <P> <B>The proposed Episcopal-Lutheran merger -- under consideration for 30 years -- is moving into its final stages</B>. A committee responsible for drafting the final version of the Concordat of Agreement between the denominations met Nov. 1-3, Episcopal News Service said. <BR><B>...The revised Concordat describes the doctrinal consensus that underlies proposals</B> for full communion: Scripture and the historic creeds, the sacraments of baptism and Eucharist, and &quot;a ministry of pastoral oversight&quot; to safeguard the church from doctrinal error. The revised Concordat calls for continued study of how the diaconate relates to other ministries. Both churches have gifts they bring to the &quot;spiritual marriage,&quot; the committee said. A vote on full communion will take place next summer. <P> <B>The gospels are based on Jewish stories, not literal truth, according to Episcopal Bishop John Spong. </B>The controversial leader of the Diocese of Newark, N.J., has written a book arguing that many events described in the life of  Jesus -- such as the circumstances of his birth to his physical resurrection -- are not literally true. Spong argues in <I>Liberating the Gospels: Reading the Bible with Jewish Eyes </I>that the New Testament uses sacred Jewish stories to describe the holiness that Jesus' contemporaries saw in Him, <I>The Los Angeles Times</I> said. Many people have rejected the church over its insistence that the Bible's account of Jesus' life is factual instead of digging deeper into the meaning of Jesus' life, Spong said. <BR><B>...&quot;The Gospels were not written to be history,&quot;</B> Spong wrote. Consequently, he said, there might have been no actual person called Joseph as the husband of Mary, no temptation of Jesus during 40 days in the wilderness, no Sermon on the Mount, no miraculous feeding of the 5,000 and no ascension into heaven following Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.    </font></p>

That means student-led prayer at graduations is permissible in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi -- the states covered by the Fifth Circuit -- while other prayer is not permitted. <BR><B>...School boards across the country say they had been looking for guidance </B>on the subject of student-led prayer in public schools, especially at graduation time. <P> <B>Canadian police made arrests in a major international child-pornography ring on the Internet</B>. Authorities confiscated 30,000 pornographic computer files and arrested Trevor Davis, 22, of Ontario. Davis is believed to be connected with a group of American men known as the Orchid Club who were charged last summer with running an Internet pornography ring, news reports said. The files seized included photos and video clips of young children as well as text of child-abuse incidents. <P> <B>Destitute street children in Mexico City are going to a Christian camp</B> run by Bothell, Wash.-based Action International Ministries. The children -- who are not in school and have no parents or guardians -- often respond readily when invited to attend the camp. Once there, they are safe from harm and receive three meals a day and loving care, Mission News Network said. About the third day, the children start relaxing and listening, and eventually many of them make commitments to Christ. <P> <B>Churches are growing fast in Madagascar</B>, an island off the southeastern coast of Africa. An evangelistic conference motivated 25 volunteers to show the <I>Jesus</I> film to 30,000 people throughout the country. Nearly 9,000 people made professions of faith in Christ and 600 were trained in evangelism.  <P> <B>Missionary students hundreds of miles apart are studying together</B> in Youth With A Mission's &quot;electronic classroom.&quot; The 12-week Leadership Training School is run by YWAM's University of the Nations. The first such class begins this month with a live broadcast connecting students in Lausanne, Switzerland, to others in Budapest, Hungary. Students follow the same course and share teachers, who are able to interact with students at each location through a two-way video link. <P>        <P> <B>Promise Keepers drew 1.1 million men</B> at 22 conferences in stadiums around the country this year, according to Randy Phillips, president of the men's ministry. <P> <B>Afghanistan's Taleban rulers want to ban opium poppy production</B> on religious grounds, according to United Nations officials who spoke to the strict Islamic leaders. That could cut Asia's heroin output by half, U.N. drug experts said. But the Taleban, which controls two-thirds of Afghanistan, said it first must find replacement crops for poppy farmers, Reuters news service said. <P> <B>An Anglican was ordained as the first woman priest in Rome</B>, creating a stir in the capital of Roman Catholicism. Cecilia Monge Teran de Erazo is a 43-year-old grandmother who converted from Catholicism in the 1980s. She was ordained Nov. 3 at the American Episcopal Church of Saint Paul's Within-the-Walls. Her husband, Juan, is also a priest. <P> <B>Arson attacks on black churches have declined somewhat</B> and arrests have quadrupled since a task force began to concentrate efforts on the problem, the U.S. assistant attorney general for civil rights told Ecumenical News International. <P> <B>A Chaldean family gave $400,000 to President Clinton's re-election campaign</B> at a fund-raiser last month, <I>The Detroit Free Press</I> reported. Chaldeans are Christian Iraqis; the Detroit area is home to the largest Chaldean community outside of Iraq. At the Oct. 21 fund-raiser in Detroit, many members of the Chaldean community urged the president to be lenient toward their Iraqi homeland, the newspaper said. People paid as much as $10,000 per couple to the Democratic National Committee for the chance to speak with the president privately. <P> <B>Mississippi has dropped its attempt to toughen its abortion laws</B>, already among the nation's strictest. The state said it stands little chance of reversing a Sept. 27 federal court ruling against the restrictions, which were enacted by the Legislature in March. The restrictions included a ban on clinics near churches and schools. Also included were rules requiring at least five rest rooms in clinics, alarm and emergency power systems, separate locker rooms for nurses and doctors, and a formal agreement with a hospital to receive emergency patients. <P>      </font></p>

</td><td width="470">&nbsp;<BR><table width="450"  align="center" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"><tr><td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 4, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Churches in China are overflowing</B>, according to Marj Carpenter, moderator of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). This fall, Carpenter preached to 2,000 people at Mo Chou Church in Nanjing. An increasing number of young people, university students, and inquirers are attending church, she said. In a rural area in northern Jiangsu Province, Carpenter met with 350 Christians who worshipped and sang outdoors in their village. <BR><B>...Expelled from China nearly 50 years ago, the Roman Catholic Church </B>is pushing for full diplomatic relations with Beijing. Talks between the Vatican and Beijing continue, but are stalemated over the issue of government control. Presently, officially recognized religions must report to a government agency whose mission is to promote atheism. <P> <B>China has promised not to make Hong Kong communist, </B>but Christians there are skeptical. Under the Basic Law -- the constitution China prepared for Hong Kong -- the territory will keep the freedoms it enjoyed under British rule, including religious autonomy. But Hong Kong's 500,000 Christians -- about 8% of the population -- are divided about whether to believe those promises. <BR><B>...A crackdown on dissent in Beijing has worried inhabitants of Hong Kong.</B> An estimated 3,000 people protested in the streets there Sunday, demanding that China release democracy activist Wang Dan and other dissidents. Protesters chanted slogans while others walked with hands chained and mouths taped shut to symbolize the silencing of dissent in China. Others rode in flatbed trucks decorated to resemble Chinese prison cells. Wang was sentenced to 11 years in prison on charges of conspiring to subvert the government. <BR><B>...An evangelical pastor in Hong Kong says no matter what happens,</B> house churches will continue. The core of the church will be in such house groups, said Dennis Balcombe, head of the Revival Christian Church.  <P> <B>Hindus cut off the electric supply when Indian evangelist Sadhu Chellappa held a crusade</B> in the town of Kandarvakkottai in Tamil Nadu, according to DAWN FridayFax. But the Christians had brought a diesel generator to power the lights and 32 loudspeakers. Hundreds of people accepted the gospel that evening, resulting in a newly-planted church attended by 150, Chellappa said. <P> <B>Stressed-out nuns from across Britain are taking courses to learn how to relax</B>. The nuns, who work with drug addicts and the homeless, go to a retreat in Berkshire for training in exercise, nutrition, and massage. People think nuns are always serene, but they are like everyone else, an instructor said. Nuns take difficult jobs where they are needed most, acting as counselors and therapists for people dealing with drugs, alcohol abuse, crime, and violence. <P> <B>Habitat for Humanity International took a team of 500 people </B>for a five-and-a-half day &quot;blitz&quot; build in Hungary. The workers, from 23 countries, constructed houses and talked to residents about God, Mission News Network said. Since volunteerism is unusual in Hungary, local residents and the media noticed the effort.  <P> <B>Representatives of three evangelical groups</B> are looking for ways to cooperate. Representatives of AD 2000 and Beyond, Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, and World Evangelical Fellowship met Oct. 15-16 in Carol Stream, Ill., to explore closer ties for promoting world evangelism. <BR><B>...The aim is to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts</B>, the leaders said, adding that they want to increase cooperation and trust among the groups without losing the distinctive ministry of any of them. <BR><B>...The leaders are planning another meeting that will include representatives of additional key ministries</B>. An interim group will meet during the National Assembly of Evangelicals in Bournemouth, England, Nov. 10-13. <P> <B>International Bible Society began publishing a bimonthly magazine</B> called <I>Native Wind</I>. The premier issue contains profiles of  Native American Christians who &quot;do not relinquish their cultural heritage&quot; for the sake of religion, the IBS said. <P> <B>Some 69% of Roman Catholics in England and Wales want priests to have the right to marry</B>, according to a poll taken by a weekly newspaper the <I>Catholic Herald</I>. <P> <B>The Anglican Church in Japan made a formal statement of apology for its complicity in World War II</B>, Anglican News Service said. &quot;While it may seem to have taken a long time for this statement of apology to appear, it has finally come to the surface after much prayer, reflection, discussion, and heartfelt concern,&quot; wrote Primate James Takiro Yashiro in a letter to the head of the New Zealand Anglican Church. The three-page statement said the Nippon Sei Ko Kai church did not oppose militarism or support oppressed groups, but became too inward-looking. <P> <B>Pope John Paul II will make a historic first visit to Cuba,</B> a Vatican official confirmed. Arrangements for the visit are being made, news reports said. A trip by a Vatican foreign minister to the island recently signaled improved relations between the Communist government and the Roman Catholic Church.    </font></p>

The missionaries find children gathered in parks and under bridges or stadiums, said Marvin Graves of Action International Ministries. There are 70,000 homeless children in Manila alone, Graves said. The ministry also is sponsoring vocational training in automotive repair, leathercraft, and welding. <P> <B>A hundred foreigners are trapped in a Roman Catholic cathedral in Bukavu, Zaire</B>, as fighting rages, news reports said. Nationalities of the foreigners was unknown, but reporters in Kamanyola, Zaire, this week said Belgian and Italian missionaries were still in Bukavu. <P>    <P> <B>The Sacred Heart League of Walls Miss., the Catholic charity that produced the Hollywood movie</B> <I>Spitfire Grill</I>, says it will follow up on its success by making another movie. <I>Spitfire Grill</I>, a feature-length film, depicts a woman's struggle for a new start after her release from prison. It has earned the Sacred Heart League $3 million, which it will spend on a new school. The League is part of  a mission that supports grammar schools and social service programs in an impoverished area. It also is building a low-income housing development. <P> <B>The Church of Scientology has complained to the United Nations about discrimination in Germany</B>. The Los Angeles-based church said the German state of Bavaria is prohibiting Scientologists from holding public-sector jobs, breaking Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights. Bavaria requires state employees to reveal ties to the church. It also requires private companies with state contracts in sensitive fields to promise not to use the methods of Scientology, news reports said. <BR><B>...Leaders of Germany's 16 regional states are considering putting the Church of  Scientology under surveillance</B> by the government. German leaders deny that the Church of Scientology is a church.  <P> <B>President Clinton wants public school teachers</B> to have the right to travel to parochial schools to teach federally financed remedial classes. Clinton joined New York City officials in asking the court to reverse a 1985 ruling barring the practice. In New York City, students from religious schools are transported to public schools for the special instruction or are given the remedial help in mobile vans parked near parochial schools. <P> <B>The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A) has appealed to religious and political leaders in Iran</B> to investigate the death of a 35-year-old Assemblies of God pastor in September, the PCUSA News Service reported. The body of Mohammed Bagher Yousefi was found hanging from a tree near Ghaem-Shahr. He is the seventh Christian pastor to be killed since the Islamic revolution in 1979. <BR><B>...Iranian Christians in the United States say they are frustrated </B>over their inability to pinpoint blame for the deaths. Some believe paramilitary groups with ties to high government officials are to blame, while others say vigilantes organized by local Islamic hardliners caused the killings, the news service said. Another theory is that the deaths are the work of groups attempting to embarrass the Rafsanjani government. <P> <B>The Episcopal Church has been implicated in an alleged sex scandal</B> involving Long Island priests. An article in December's <I>Penthouse</I> magazine contains allegations of sexual misconduct against Long Island priest William Lloyd Andries and other unnamed priests. The article claims they are involved in &quot;bizarre&quot; homosexual rituals, Episcopal News Service said. Howard Williams, the Episcopal Church's coordinator for children's ministries, who was mentioned in the article, has already agreed to resign. <P> <B>Another meteorite from Mars contains evidence for possible life on that planet</B>, British scientists said. American geologists who found possibly life-related compounds in a Mars rock in August said the British research confirms their findings. <BR><B>...The latest discovery will encourage more testing of meteorites</B> from Mars and increase interest in spacecraft missions to the planet, news reports said. The first such mission is scheduled for launching next Wednesday.    </font></p>

As Reed began to talk, half the audience held up signs denouncing the coalition's criticism of homosexuality. Same-sex couples among the protesters embraced and kissed until police removed them from the hall. &quot;Get used to us, because we're going to be here a long, long time,&quot; Reed told the protesters before they were removed. During a question-and-answer session after Reed's talk, a black woman who identified herself as a lesbian told Reed he is &quot;a geeky, post-modern Christian racist in an expensive suit.&quot; <P> <B>Zaire and Rwanda moved closer to war with a third day of artillery and machine gun exchanges</B> across the border, news reports said. Tutsi fighters attacked near the eastern Zairean city of Goma today, sending refugees fleeing. Earlier this week, fighting in eastern Zaire claimed the life of Roman Catholic Archbishop Christophe Munzihirwa Mwene Ngabo. The Vatican said he was killed during an attack on the eastern town of Bukavu. <BR><B>...Volunteers in Bukavu were burying bodies,</B> the Red Cross said. The last foreign aid workers fled from Bukavu on Tuesday, reports said. Missionaries there had stayed in their homes fearing being shot, a Burundian priest told Reuters news service. <P> <B>Ten thousand Ugandan Christians have joined an AIDS campaign</B>. The Good Samaritan Volunteers, who are members of the Anglican diocese of  Namirembe, will provide food, clothing, and medical care for the sick and promote awareness of AIDS prevention and care. The three-year project will cost $300,000. <P> <B>..More than 100,000 Ugandans have died from AIDS-related diseases s</B>ince the virus first was identified there in 1982. An estimated 1.5 million Ugandans out of the total population of 20 million are HIV-positive, news reports said. Uganda is among the worst-affected countries in Africa. <BR><B>...Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Orthodox Church leaders in Uganda have been criticized</B> for opposing condom use to stop the spread of the disease. The churches have said use of condoms encourages promiscuity. <P> <B>The Orthodox Patriarch in Serbia has blessed the Reconciliation Walk.</B> &quot;In view of the previously icy relationship between the Orthodox church and evangelicals,&quot; the Patriarch's action was very surprising, according to DAWN FridayFax. Walkers are following the path of the Crusades, from Cologne to Jerusalem, as they apologize to Muslims and Jews.  <BR><B>...The walkers said the Patriarch emphasized &quot;brotherhood and unity</B> between Orthodox believers and Western Christians.&quot; Another Orthodox bishop apologized for &quot;the bitterness&quot; he had felt toward Western Christians, a walk organizer said. <P> <B>A Messianic Christian fellowship has begun in Stuttgart, Germany</B>, according to the German magazine <I>idea</I>. Attendance at the fellowship ranges from 70-150; most are Russian-speaking Jews who believe that Jesus Christ is the Messiah promised by the Old Testament. Other visitors are Christian friends of Judaism.  <P> <B>In Brazil, more than 1,000 people made decisions to become Christians during a crusade this month led by American evangelist Sammy Tippit</B>. A total of 39,000 people attended four days of crusade meetings in Sao Luiz. Tippit also spoke at a True Love Waits conference, where 600 teen-agers committed themselves to sexual abstinence before marriage.   <P> <B>The Methodist church in Brazil has been growing 33% annually since 1992</B>, according to DAWN FridayFax. Most new churches are planted by laypeople and are &quot;charismatically oriented,&quot; according to Paulo Lockmann, Rio de Janeiro's Methodist bishop. <P> <B>A South African judge sentenced the former head of a police assassination squad</B> to two life sentences and 200 years in jail. Eugene de Kock's actions were cruel, calculated, and without sympathy for his victims, <I>The New York Times</I> said. De Kock is the highest-ranking official to be convicted of apartheid-era crimes. His conviction could encourage others to cooperate with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is uncovering details of thousands of apartheid-era murders, disappearances, and tortures. The commission is considering amnesty for those who testify. <P> <B>A church has begun among a Vietnamese tribe where witch doctors once ruled.</B> Because of a Vietnamese Christian named May, the church was established among the very poor Churu Indian Tribe, according to Mission Network News. God miraculously destroyed that power, many Churu became Christians, and now 300 attend church in the village, May said. The new believers are difficult to disciple because there is no Churu Bible. <P> <B>Jerry Falwell denied Wednesday that he has become a Southern Baptist,</B> saying news reports had misinterpreted his position. The Lynchburg, Va., pastor described himself as &quot;a Baptist in the South,&quot; but still independent of the Southern Baptist Convention. Falwell contributed funds to a conservative group of Virginia Baptists, indirectly affiliating his congregation, Thomas Road Baptist Church, with the SBC. A Falwell spokesman characterized the contribution as friendly cooperation rather than a sign of membership. <P> <B>Five of Britain's best preachers held a preach-off in front of a full congregation and a panel of judges</B> at Southwark Cathedral in London Wednesday. William Anderson, a 65-year-old Roman Catholic from Aberdeen, Scotland, won the Preacher of the Year Award. Finalists for the award, organized by the College of Preachers, were chosen through unannounced visits to churches.    </font></p>

</td><td width="470">&nbsp;<BR><table width="450"  align="center" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"><tr><td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 30, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>To the alarm of those who favor tough drug policies, the legal use of marijuana is gaining support</B>. In California, three recent polls show 56%-58% of voters favor Proposition 215, the initiative that would legalize medical use of marijuana for those suffering from AIDS, cancer, glaucoma &quot;or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.&quot; Users would not need a written prescription, but only a &quot;doctor's recommendation,&quot; <I>The New York Times</I> reported. <BR><B>...Public sympathy has been generated by people such as Judith Cushner, a former cancer sufferer</B>, who described on television how marijuana helped her through the pain of chemotherapy. &quot;Some day, you may need it,&quot; she warned. <BR><B>...Advocates of tough drug policies say they fear a massive loosening of control over marijuana use</B> in the nation's most populous state. The real motive of Proposition 215 is eventual legalization of marijuana, they say. Other states are watching California, which sometimes sets the pace on legislative issues. <BR><B>...Illegal drug use among teens has been increasing sharply</B>, several recent studies found. The National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education found that the number of children in grades six through 12 using illicit drugs every day increased 147% in the past decade, <I>Family Issues Alert</I> said.  <P> <B>An Idaho county is arresting pregnant teen-agers and charging them with fornication</B>. The Gem County prosecuting attorney has used the state's 1921 law prohibiting sex between unmarried people to arrest 10 girls and their boyfriends, <I>The New York Times</I> reported.  <BR><B>...Teens usually plead guilty and are placed on probation for three years</B>. During that time, they are required to attend parenting classes, finish high school, stay employed, and not use drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes. <BR><B>...Gem County officials say they are trying to restore the social stigma</B> to teen-age pregnancy. Attempts elsewhere around the nation include more sex education, easier access to contraceptives, and tougher enforcement of statutory rape laws. In Orange county, Calif., some fathers face the choice of marriage or jail. <P> <B>A mother of  six was convicted Tuesday in Williamsport, Pa., of helping her stepson's 13-year-old girlfriend get an abortion</B>. Rose Marie Hartford was charged with driving the girl to New York -- without her parents' knowledge -- for an abortion in 1995. Pennsylvania has a strict parental-notification law. Hartford faces up to seven years in prison. The stepson, Michael Kilmer, 19, is serving a one-year to 30-month prison sentence for statutory rape. <P> <B>A South African Catholic priest who was an anti-apartheid activist said he was tortured</B>. Smangaliso Mkhatshwa told a committee in Johannesburg that military intelligence officers handcuffed, blindfolded, interrogated, and tortured him, Ecumenical News International reported. Mkhatshwa said he was stripped naked and forced to stand with a bag over his head for long periods without sleep. <P> <B>Interest in religion among Russians has grown in the five years since the collapse of the Soviet Union</B>, a poll confirmed. The All-Russian Public Opinion Research Centre found that 37% of respondents are not religious, as compared to 53% in 1991. Eight percent declined to comment as compared to 15.3% in 1991, Ecumenical News International reported. <BR><B>...Most of the growth is in the Orthodox Church.</B> Fifty percent of the country's adult population say they are Orthodox, compared to 30% in 1991. However, only an estimated 5% to 10% of them attend church. Four percent are Islamic, compared to 1% in 1991. The number of Roman Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and Buddhists are in the tenths of a percent, the poll found. <P> <B>Christian ministries have started in about half the areas of Calcutta, India</B>, according to the missions publication <I>Advance</I>. Twelve of  Calcutta's 65 people-groups have new churches, prayer groups number 650, and in five years 50 film and literature teams will be at work. <BR><B>...In Madras, India, the number of churches has grown from 700 in 1989 to 2,000 today</B>, <I>Advance</I> said. At least 400 new fellowships have been started in the last two years. <P> <B>Jerry Falwell has become a Southern Baptist</B>. Falwell and his Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Va., have been unaligned, although friendly with the Southern Baptist Convention. Falwell's move is a sign of support for the SBC's conservative policies, achieved after years of theological conflict in the 16 million-member denomination. <BR><B>...Falwell's affiliation follows the formation last month of the Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia</B>, a state group that mirrors the theological views of the SBC. The SBCV broke away from the 173-year-old Baptist General Association of Virginia, charging its leaders with liberalism. <P> <B>Half a million gospels of John will be sent to Mexico as part of a saturation evangelism</B> effort by the evangelical churches of Guadalajara, according to Bibles for Mexico. Thousands of New Testaments and Bible study courses also will be sent, according to Mission Network News. Members of evangelical churches in Guadalajara plan a door-to-door witnessing campaign.    </font></p>

Aid workers say 400,000 refugees packed Mugunga camp, near Goma, and an additional 200,000 are arriving.  <BR><B>...Mugunga has become the largest refugee camp in the world</B>, U.N. spokesperson Sylvana Foa said. The camp is built on a volcanic rock, so adding more latrines and water &quot;is a nightmare,&quot; she said. There also is a shortage of food and water. <BR><B>...The conflict between Zaire, Rwanda, and Burundi</B> threatens to engulf the entire Great Lakes region of central Africa. Zaire is trying to evict the Banyamulenge Tutsis, and accuses Tutsi regimes in neighboring Rwanda and Burundi of helping the Banyamulenge. <P> <B>A group of Kenyan Christians made a four-week visit to Richmond, Va.,</B> on behalf of their forefathers, who sold their relatives to slavetraders, YWAM International News Digest said. Members of the group prayed at the site of slave auctions and visited the urban poor. The group said it was motivated by the story of Joseph, whose brothers sold him into slavery. They prayed that God would exchange the bad for good, as He did with Joseph. <P>   <P> <B>Cuban President Fidel Castro met with visiting Vatican Foreign Minister Jean Louis Tauran</B> on Monday. Tauran's five-day visit reflects improved relations between Cuba and the Roman Catholic Church and could be a prelude to a meeting between Castro and Pope John Paul, news reports said. <P> <B>Approximately 5,000 people are working long hours in a Lancaster, Pa., warehouse</B> Oct. 21-Nov. 2 to assemble thousands of packages containing school supplies. The items will be delivered to Russian children in orphanages, schools, and hospitals. Each package also contains a 90-day supply of vitamins, a Bible storybook, and a copy of evangelist Josh McDowell's book <I>More Than A Carpenter</I>. The effort, called Operation Carelift '97, is sponsored by Dallas-based Josh McDowell Ministry.   <P> <B>Jews in Dresden, Germany, plan to build a $13 million synagogue</B> near the site of one destroyed by the Nazis on &quot;Kristallnacht,&quot; the infamous night of broken glass. On Nov. 9, 1938, the Nazis looted 7,000 Jewish shops and burned hundreds of synagogues across Germany. About 130 Jews live in Dresden, compared with 6,000 at the start of the 1930s. <P> <B>Russia is giving the Holocaust Museum in Washington copies of documents</B> containing details of  Nazi atrocities. The 15,000 pages of documents detail Soviet investigations and trials of German defendants and their collaborators from 1946 to 1949. Also, there are excerpts from Soviet field reports of  atrocities behind German lines. <P> <B>Christians are giving Jews in Ukraine free bus rides</B> from their hometowns to airports where they can fly to Israel. In five years, the Exobus Project has helped 19,000 Jews leave Ukraine for Israel. Twenty full-time volunteers from 11 nations are active in the ministry.  <P> <B>  </B> <P> <B>Church leaders in Australia are trying to calm an increasingly heated national argument over race</B> and immigration. Asian-Australians are being spat on as they walk down the street, and one town mayor called children of inter-racial marriages &quot;mongrels,&quot; news reports said. Sydney's Anglican Archbishop Harry Goodhew urged political leaders to defuse and resolve the situation. Asians make up 4.5% of the 18 million population and constitute a quarter of the 100,000 migrants each year.    </font></p>

</td><td width="470">&nbsp;<BR><table width="450"  align="center" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"><tr><td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 25, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Thirty-eight percent of American adults and 43% of registered voters say they are &quot;born-again&quot; Christians</B>, according to a Barna Research Group poll. Evangelicals make up 8% of the population and 7% of  registered voters, the poll found. Barna defined &quot;born-again&quot; Christians as those who say they have made a personal commitment to Christ and believe they will go to heaven. Evangelicals were described as those who say they are born again and believe the Bible is totally accurate. Those who described themselves as theological liberals make up 39% of the population, Barna said. <P> <B>In Romania, 438 people made professions of faith in Christ this summer</B> during evangelistic efforts by eight American Protestants. Organized by evangelist Mark Puckett of Houston, the Americans led several crusades and visited homes in the Filipesti region. Puckett, who has visited the Eastern European nation several times, said Protestants there are becoming more assertive in evangelism, but are concerned about a Parliamentiary proposal to make the Orthodox Church the state denomination. That would nullify the rights of some three million evangelicals, he said. <P> <B>The Roman Catholic Church is beginning a special effort to reach out to Generation X.</B> The National Conference of Catholic Bishops in the United States suggested that parishes telephone, write, or e-mail young adults to invite them to church. Parishes should start small groups for young adults, preach on issues of importance to them, and encourage older adults to mentor younger members, the bishops said. <P> <B>Poland has liberalized its abortion law.  </B>The lower house of  Parliament passed a bill Thursday overthrowing a Senate veto, and ex-communist President Aleksander Kwasniewski said he will sign it into law. The new law will allow women to have an abortion before the 12th week if they face financial or personal problems. Women considering abortion must receive counseling and take three days for reflection. Under Poland's old law, abortion was legal only if a pregnancy threatened a woman's life or health, resulted from rape or incest, or resulted in a hopelessly damaged fetus. <P> <B>The Barbie doll has competition in Iran</B>. The Islamic republic's new &quot;Sarah&quot; doll doesn't flaunt her figure in a Western-style bathing suit, but wears modest, flowing robes. Iran's version of  &quot;Ken&quot; is &quot;Dara,&quot; her brother, who wears the garb of an Islamic cleric. Although importing Barbie dolls is prohibited, dozens of Tehran shops sell Barbies -- some in swimsuits -- news reports said. <P> <B>Jets flown by the radical Islamic Taleban pounded mud homes in a village</B> north of  Kabul Thursday, killing at least 20 people, including children. The Taleban also demonstrated their loathing of alcohol by using a battle tank to crush hundreds of cans of beer, sending streams of  foam over bystanders, news reports said. <P> <B>An AIDS-awareness program that focuses on Jesus Christ as the only answer</B> to the deadly disease is opening doors for the gospel in South Africa. Vern Tisdalle, an Assemblies of  God missionary, said Soweto officials asked him to present the program to students and government workers, the denomination said. Many listened intently and wanted to learn more about the gospel. &quot;Non-Christian leadership is begging for answers to a human tragedy for which they have no answers,&quot; Tisdalle said.  <P> <B>Harold Hughes, who left the U.S. Senate to devote himself to religious work</B> and help alcoholics, died at age 74. Hughes was a former truck driver who overcame alcoholism to become a three-term Democratic governor and U.S. senator. <P> <B>North Korea said Carl Hunziker, an American jailed on spying charges</B>, is not a Christian missionary as he claims because he does not know hymns, the Ten Commandments, or how to pray. North Korea said Hunziker's situation would worsen if the United States does not apologize. The State Department says Hunziker, 26, is not a spy, but inadvertently strayed into North Korea while on a visit to China. <BR><B>...Hunziker has signed a confession</B>, Reuters news service said. If convicted, he faces a possible death sentence. <P> <B>A judge upheld a New York City zoning law barring sex shops from certain areas</B>. Restricting peep shows, nude bars, and other adult businesses to some sections of the city does not hinder free speech, said Justice Marylin Diamond of the state Supreme Court. The restrictions could close down 85% of the city's X-rated businesses, lawyers said. The limitations bar sex shops from within 500 feet of schools, day care centers, houses of worship, and new residential areas.    </font></p>

Some 98% of the households in Copenhagen received copies, with only a few people refusing the gift, according to the Danish Bible Society. <BR><B>...Local Danish churches cooperated to distribute the Bibles. </B>The effort was preceeded<B> </B>by an advertising campaign on television, billboards, and in newspapers. Copenhagen's 38,000 foreign-language households were offered a free copy of the New Testament in their own language. Each household also received a list of 600 follow-up events such as Christian concerts and Bible-study groups.   <BR><B>...The Swedish Bible Society plans a similar New Testament distribution</B> in Stockholm in 1998. <P> <B>Christian relief groups are aiding refugees fleeing to Rwanda from eastern Zaire</B>, an area that is close to war. Workers from groups such as World Relief and the Free Methodist Church are in Rwandan refugee camps providing food, soap, medicine, and blankets for the Banyamulenge refugees, most of whom are widows and orphans. The Banyamulenge are ethnic Tutsis who arrived in eastern Zaire up to 200 years ago from what is now Rwanda and Burundi. They have been the target of ethnic persecution and denied Zairian citizenship. On Oct. 8, Zaire ordered all the Banyamulenge to leave Zaire or face a war.   <BR><B>...The refugees are completely without resources</B>, said Eraste Iyamuremye of the Free Methodist Church in Rwanda. Children are showing signs of malnutrition, said Jean Gakwandi, World Relief's program manager in Rwanda. Some refugees &quot;are of Free Methodist background and are godly people,&quot; Gakwandi added. &quot;Most of their time is spent in prayer and worship.&quot; <P> <B>A Vatican emissary visited Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) denominational headquarters</B> in Louisville seeking ecumenical ties, Presbyterian News Service said. Monsignor John Radano, an American from New Jersey who serves on the Vatican's Council for Promoting Christian Unity, signaled the Roman Catholic Church's &quot;irrevocable commitment&quot; to the ecumenical movement. He told PNS that the Vatican's relationship with international ecumenical bodies such as the World Council of Churches is &quot;a good partnership.&quot; <BR><B>...The Vatican has been having constructive dialogue on matters of liturgy and doctrine</B>, such as justification by faith, Radano said. Social issues have been more problematic, since various churches are far apart on issues such as birth control, abortion, and the role of women in the church, he said. <P> <B>A prayerwalk took place this month in Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Oman</B>, Mission Network News said. In addition to praying, participants worshipped and held seminars with evangelical Christians. About 10,000 evangelicals reportedly live in the region.  <P> <B>Feminists for Life, a nonsectarian Washington, D.C.-based group,</B> is targeting college campuses. The group's campaign includes counseling, campus-reform proposals, and advertisements challenging students to &quot;Question Abortion.&quot; <A HREF= http://www.serve.com/fem4life > Feminists for Life </A> is located at 733 15th St., NW, Suite 1100, Washington, DC  20005. The phone number is (202) 737-3352. <P> <B>The U.S. government allowed Catholic Relief Services to send one planeload of food, clothing, and medicine to Cuba</B> for victims of  Hurricane Lili. The hurricane hit central and western Cuba last week, destroying 5,000 homes and damaging 78,000. Winds also damaged crops, power lines, and communications. <BR><B>...Supporters of the State Department's ban on direct flights</B> from the United States to Cuba say they fear humanitarian supplies will be stolen by the government of Fidel Castro. But a U.S. Catholic group said it would monitor the shipment to ensure the supplies get to the needy. <P> <B>Five hundred women marched in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif,</B> chanting slogans against the country's Taliban rulers and waving a giant banner reading &quot;Men and Women Need Each Other,&quot; Reuter news service said. The radical Islamic Taliban control two-thirds of Afghanistan, but do not control Mazar-e-Sharif, where the rally was held at Balkh University. Men and women study together at the school, a practice opposed by the Taliban.    </font></p>

In conformity with strict Muslim law, barriers must be present between men and women at weddings, parties, and picnics. The law bans men and women from sitting facing each other, buses must display a verse from the Koran asking Muslims to not look at members of the opposite sex, and streets must be well-lighted so couples can't go into the darkness. Similar laws were enacted in Iran after the 1979 revolution. <BR><B>...Khartoum's new law does not require women to wear a veil</B>, but women working in restaurants cannot wear jewelry or perfume. Women cannot sit near the driver on buses, and must be accompanied by a male relative while shopping at night. Female athletes and women performing folk dances cannot wear tight-fitting clothes. Men also must cover their bodies, and males must be separated from females in private schools, as they are in public schools. <BR><B>...Christians in the southern part of the country are exempt</B> from the new laws. The government is considering extending the exemption to Christians in the Muslim-majority north. <P> <B>A play about the 1956 deaths of Jim Elliot and four other missionaries</B> -- and the subsequent opening of the gospel to the tribe responsible for their murders -- is being performed in 20 U.S. cities. <I>Dayuma</I>, which opened Sept. 19-21 in Tulsa, Okla., is being staged through cooperation among Wycliffe Bible Translators, Youth With a Mission, and Impact Productions. <P> <B>Some 10,000 North American youngsters in 39 states and Canada collected a ton of school supplies</B> for children in Ukraine. The supplies were gathered at Vacation Bible School programs this summer through a project organized by Slavic Gospel Association. Local pastors in Ukraine will distribute the supplies to public school children. SGA also is giving away 12 tons of shoes and clothing in Ukraine, the Loves Park-Ill.-based group said.  <P> <B>For the first time, Britain's Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Jewish leaders joined to speak out</B> for a more caring and moral society. Anglican leader George Carey called for parenting classes and more emphasis on the teaching of right and wrong in schools. Jonathan Sacks, Britain's chief rabbi, called for establishment of a royal commission on the question of teaching citizenship. <BR><B>...At least a million children are abused in Britain each year</B>, a commission said in a report published today. The National Commission of Inquiry into the Prevention of Child Abuse said abuse was preventable but a &quot;culture change&quot; was needed. <P> <B>An interracial and interdenominational mixture of 2,000 Australian Christians</B> prayed and worshipped in shifts for 72 hours Oct. 10-13 in the Great Hall of  the Parliament House Canberra. Every denomination and many tribal groups were represented at the Praise Corroboree, according to Worldwide Photos. At the event, aboriginal elders and pastors stood with arms outstretched as they laid hands on and blessed Prime Minister John Howard. <P> <B>A Baptist church in a poor section of  Los Angeles has planted or helped support 62 churches</B>, Baptist Press said. El Camino Truth and Life Baptist Church, a congregation of fewer than 200 people, has a modest budget, staff, and facilities. But its pastor, Aquiles Acosta, has a &quot;deep calling of God&quot; to spread the gospel as widely as possible, he says. Many leaders of churches planted by El Camino are congregants Acosta trained in a three-year Bible course he developed. The Bible Institute covers two years of theology and one year of homiletics and hermeneutics. Hour-long tests are given weekly. <BR><B>...In addition to churches planted in Los Angeles,</B> El Camino assists congregations in Mexico, Argentina and Greece. The church holds worship on Friday nights in lieu of Sunday evening services so members can preach and lead worship at fledgling churches. <P> <B>The United Methodist Church is planning a weekly 30-minute cable television show</B> offering a religious perspective on the news. <I>News Odyssey</I> is scheduled to begin on the Odyssey Channel, formerly Faith and Values Network, next year. <P> <B>Churches could jeopardize their tax-exempt status by handing out Christian Coalition voter guides,</B> according to Americans United for Separation of Church and State. The group said the guides imply support for Republican candidates and distort the positions of  Democrats. Some 45 million guides are scheduled to be distributed to 120,000 churches in the next two weeks. <BR><B>...&quot;If a church distributes a partisan voter guide, it will constitute improper political activity by the church</B>,&quot; according to a memo prepared for Americans United by tax lawyers Milton Cerny and Albert Lauber, Jr. The tax-exempt Christian Coalition is being sued by the Federal Election Commission for allegedly making illegal contributions to former President George Bush and other Republicans through the voter guides and for conducting voter drives for certain candidates. <BR><B>...Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed dismissed charges</B> that distribution of the guide is political activity not permitted of tax-exempt organizations. Reed also told the National Press Club that the coalition has asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser held at a Buddhist temple in Los Angeles last April that was attended by Vice President Al Gore. The event raised $140,000.    </font></p>

The corpses are being used without the knowledge or consent of relatives, the study said. <BR><B>...Some 46% of hospitals in Australia and New Zealand accredited to train doctors in emergency medicine</B> had used the bodies of newly deceased  patients in teaching resuscitation skills, and none had obtained consent from relatives, the study said. About three-quarters of respondents said the practice was ethical. There are no laws to stop the practice on patients whose deaths did not have to be reported to the coroner, <I>The Sydney Morning Herald</I> reported. <BR><B>...Previous studies had found up to 40% of  hospitals in the United States engaged in the practice,</B>  although objections had been raised on religious, ethical, and legal grounds, according to the researchers, Corinne Ginifer and Anne-Maree Kelly of the Western Hospital in Melbourne. <P> <B>More than 100 lepers who converted to Christianity during their treatment</B> at a Christian clinic in Niger have become full-time missionaries, the missions group SIM said. Many former patients of the Danja Health Center in southern Niger are preaching while working in the mission hospital, Mission Network News said. <P> <B>The U.S. Postal Service is issuing a stamp to commemorate Hanukah</B>, the Jewish festival of lights. It is the first in a series of  &quot;holiday celebration&quot; stamps that will include secular and religious holidays. For 34 years, Christmas was the only religious holiday recognized by a stamp. Jewish groups have lobbied for a Hanukah stamp for many years, <I>The Washington Post</I> reported. <BR><B>...Critics say that, since it is impossible to issue a stamp for every religious group in America</B>, issuing any stamps with religious themes implies preferential treatment for certain faiths and violates the principle of the separation of church and state. <P> <B>Orthodox Jews in Israel will surf on a kosher Internet</B>. Observant Jews have produced a kosher version of the Internet that shelters them from anything offensive, <I>The Jerusalem Post</I> said. Five young religious men examine the content of web pages and decide whether to include them in Toranet, administered by an Israeli company of the same name. Subscribers will see no photographs of women; they will be able to correspond by e-mail with Orthodox rabbis. <P> <B>American Indian creationism, which rejects the theory of evolution</B> in favor of the Native American explanations of  human origins, is gaining political clout, <I>The New York Times</I> reported. <BR><B>...Indian tribes have blocked archeological research</B> on hundreds of prehistoric skeletons. Under the federal repatriation act of 1990, negotiation between tribes and federal agencies -- rather than the law -- determine who gets ancestral bones. Most Indians say they do not need science to study their origins because their creation accounts tell them where they came from, <I>The Times</I> said.  <P> <B>The Mobile Bible Institute is bringing a seminary to Christians in rural Honduras</B>, according to Mission Network News. The institute has two locations and 105 students. A third program is beginning in El Salvador. The Institute is run by Birmingham, Ala.-based World Reach. <P> <B>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats pledged to put the Church of Scientology under surveillance</B> and bar its members from public service, Reuters news service said. A resolution passed by the political party called for a national information network to track the group's activities and to warn Germans against joining it. Germany has refused to register The Church of Scientology as a religion, instead considering it a tyrannical, manipulative money-maker. The U.S.-based Church of Scientology compared the Christian Democrats' resolution to the Nazis' strictures against the Jews. <P> <B>Bob Dole failed to mobilize evangelical Christians in his final debate with President Clinton Oct. 16</B>, religious conservatives said. The GOP candidate did not answer adequately when asked how he would return the country to godly principles, and did not explain why he described homosexual rights as &quot;special rights,&quot; Baptist Press quoted several prominent conservatives as saying. Dole also failed to mention partial-birth abortion, even though he said he would do so.<BR>  <P> <B>Some Christians are fair-weather friends and hypocrites</B>, Tammy Fae Messner says. In her new book, <I>Tammy: Telling It My Way </I>(Villard), the former wife of Jim Bakker says many friends did not stand by the couple during their troubles after the collapse of the PTL ministry. She told <I>USA Today</I> that &quot;Christians don't walk their talk.&quot; Pastors, in particular, &quot;can be the most judgmental people in the world.&quot; Messner said she has &quot;grown up a lot&quot; and no longer is &quot;looking at the world through rose-colored glasses.&quot; <P> <B>Many Orthodox Christians in Romania are too poor to die</B>. Traditional Orthodox burials -- including lavish feats -- average $900 in the nation, where the average monthly salary is $100, according to the daily <I>Cronica Romana</I> of Bucharest. <P> <B>Sweden's national social insurance has allowed a lesbian policewoman to take paternity leave</B>, Reuters news service said. The woman's partner gave birth last winter to a daughter, conceived by artificial insemination. <P> <B>A drunken driver was given 16 years in prison for causing the death of  a baby</B> delivered prematurely after a June 15 crash. Frank Flores Cuellar was found guilty of manslaughter in Corpus Christi, Texas. Krystal Zuniga was delivered shortly after the accident, then died a few hours later. <BR><B>...The case tested whether a Texas citizen can be held criminally liable for harming an unborn child.</B> Several states have laws allowing the relatives of unborn children to sue in criminal cases, The Associated Press said. Similar legislation has been proposed in Texas.    </font></p>

In September, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said RU-486 is safe and effective when used under a doctor's supervision. But the FDA withheld final approval of the drug until it receives more information about how it would be manufactured and labeled. If approved, RU-486 could become available at hospital clinics and doctors' offices across America next summer. <BR><B>...About 2,000 women around the United States are being enrolled in the trials, reports said. </B>RU-486 has been used by 200,000 European women since 1988. Potential side effects include uterine bleeding, nausea, vomiting, and weakness. <P> <B>The U.S. Justice Department is continuing to review possible violations of law by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan</B>, <I>The Washington Times</I> reported. Farrakhan has made two trips to Libya, which is under U.S. embargoes for supporting  terrorism. Farrakhan was given a $1 billion gift for the Nation of Islam and a $250,000 human rights award, but has not yet accepted them because of a U.S. Treasury Department ban, which he said he would challenge in U.S. courts. Farrakhan also has visited Cuba, Iran, Iraq, and Sudan, which are alleged to be sponsors of international terrorism. <BR><B>...Reno declined to comment on Farrakhan's recent public remark</B> calling the United States the &quot;great Satan&quot; and predicting the fall of the country. <P> <B>A group of  Muslims and Christians are trying to mend relations after last week's rioting in East Java,</B> news reports said. The religious leaders pledged to clean up and rebuild churches burned and damaged during rioting in Situbondo. Abdurrahman Wahid, chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, said he would lead the effort. Situbondo authorities said Protestants and Catholics could use a government building for their services. <P> <B>A ministry to youths who write graffiti may have to end</B>. Noel Buchanan has spent eight years on Melbourne, Australia, trains as a Christian missionary among hardcore graffiti writers, reports said. His ministry, called Godspeek Ulturnativart, addresses social and spiritual problems of youth who damage other people's property. Many graffiti writers come from suburbs and attend private schools, said Buchanan, who has spoken to numerous school and community groups. The Christian church has expressed concern for youth, but has not given practical support to his ministry, Buchanan said. <P> <B>Sweet Haven Holy Church of God  in Carrollton, Va., gives money back to parishioners, </B>the Associated Press said. After services, Bishop Nathaniel Johnson passes out play money. Those who find Johnson's initials on the back win $10-$100. To be eligible, winners must be present for the two-hour service. Johnson said some people come for the money, but notes that attendance has doubled to about 100 people since the giveaway started three years ago. <P> <B>A Satanic cult is being blamed for the burning of a church in Belarus on Sunday</B>. Orthodox Church Patriarch Filaret said writing on the walls of the Zaslavl church proclaimed &quot;Death to Christians,&quot; the Associated Press said. Last summer, slogans praising Satan were painted on walls of the Orthodox cathedral in Minsk. <P> <B>Dolores Street Baptist Church in San Francisco said it will distribute marijuana to ease the pain </B>of people suffering from AIDS, cancer, and other illnesses, Associated Baptist Press said. The former Southern Baptist congregation is one of two San Francisco churches offering the drug. Pastor Doug Donley said the church believes that &quot;God's law of healing is more important than state laws banning the use of marijuana as medicine.&quot; A church statement said restricting marijuana's medicinal use &quot;is to deny Christ's call to offer healing to all of God's people in need.&quot; The church left the Southern Baptist Convention in 1993 to protest the denomination's expulsion of two churches over homosexuality.  <P> <B>A new limestone cross and steeple were lifted into place Sunday at an Oklahoma City, Okla., cathedral</B> damaged by the 1995 bombing at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral is located two blocks away from the blast. The bomb tore away a third of the church's cross, broke stained glass windows, and pushed brick walls several inches. The congregation worships next door, but  hopes to be back in the sanctuary by Easter and have the cathedral fully restored by Christmas 1998. <P> <B>A veneer of acrylic paint will no longer be considered clothing for revelers at this year's raunchy Fantasy Fest</B> in Key West, Fla. Police, who expect 50,000 people to attend the annual event, also say they will confine public drinking to a 10-block &quot;fantasy zone.&quot;  <BR><B>...This year's bizarre festival began Oct. 18 with nine days of costumes and parties, </B>and ends in a parade on the Saturday before Halloween. Conservative Christians oppose the festival, which began in 1979, in part because it has been known as a homosexual event featuring public nudity. <BR><B>...The Monroe County Christian Coalition also is opposing </B>Fantasy Fest, calling it a week of &quot;depravity and debauchery,&quot; news reports said. Key West officials are trying to calm the revelry without alienating tourists, reports said.    </font></p>

The president of the local civic association told <I>The Post</I> that a lot of residents &quot;feel the church is just too enormous.&quot; <P> <B>A 16-year-old Walpole, N.H., boy cycled 1,000 miles to raise money for churches burned by arsonists</B> and to help his youth group. Steffan Legasse, a member of St. John's Episcopal Church, pedaled to Georgia, where he met people whose churches had burned. &quot;I wanted to do something to help,&quot; he said. <BR><B>...Legasse, whose father runs a public relations firm in nearby Keene, N.H., created a press kit</B> detailing his motivations for making the bike trek. It included copies of press reports and photos taken during his journey. The high school junior also constructed a <A HREF= http://www.legasse.com/bikehikes/update.html>site on the Internet</A> offering updates on his trip, a letter outlining his goals, and a pledge form. A list of personal and corporate sponsors, information about news reports on his bike trip, and a Quicktime movie of  his trek also are planned. His goal is to raise $10,000 and split it between his youth group and the churches. <P> <B>A mission for the poor in Biloxi, Miss., run by the United Church of Christ,  lost a two-year property battle with a gambling casino</B>. After 74 years of ministry, Back Bay Mission must close, making way for a $120-million casino on what used to be the mission's property, the denomination said. <BR><B>...Back Bay's fight to keep its property involved the purpose and definition of &quot;church.&quot;</B> The mission argued that a church is defined by the actions people of faith take, but a court ruled that a church is a building where people worship each Sunday, the UCC said. In December 1995, Biloxi seized some of Back Bay's land under eminent domain, demolishing four buildings and part of a church building to make way for wider roads to accommodate casino traffic. Back Bay dropped its appeal this August, agreeing to sell the land. The mission sold its land to a Nevada company for $2.2 million and will move about 10 blocks from its current site.  <P> <B>Campus Crusade for Christ will dedicate its new, 285-acre, $48 million home</B> Saturday in Orlando, Fla. The property will be headquarters for the World Center for Discipleship and Evangelism of Campus Crusade, the nation's largest ministry. Ground is to be broken soon and the center could be open by 1998, the ministry said.  <P> <B>The United Church of Christ plans to build a 7-story, 93-room hotel in downtown Cleveland, Ohio</B>. The UCC, whose church offices are in Cleveland, said it considers the hotel a means of reducing costs for church-related meetings. The hotel also will produce income for the denomination. The UCC will use funds currently invested elsewhere to build the hotel. <P> <B>The Christian Coalition began distributing $750,000 to rebuild churches burned by arsonists</B>. The money has come from hundreds of predominantly white evangelical congregations. Coalition leader Ralph Reed said the Virginia Beach, Va.-based group will hold a gathering of pastors and community activists to discuss rebuilding black communities by strengthening their churches. Participants at the Congress on Racial Recovery, planned for April, will issue a document that will contain &quot;a new civil rights agenda,&quot; Reed said. <BR><B>...The National Council of Churches, which is working with the U.S. Catholic Conference</B>, several Jewish groups, and others, has raised $9.5 million in cash, pledges, and donations of materials. It also has begun distributing the money. <P> <B>An estimated 12,000 people from across the United States came to a farm in Conyers, Ga., Oct. 13</B> to hear what they believe is a message from the Virgin Mary. Nancy Fowler delivers the messages annually on Oct. 13, when Mary appears before her in a room, she says. This year, Mary said people must amend their ways because they offend God, Fowler said. <P> <B>A drunken driver was convicted of manslaughter for killing a baby born prematurely</B> after the man crashed into the baby's mother's car. Frank Flores Cuellar was convicted Oct. 17 in Corpus Christi, Texas, in the death of Krystal Zuniga. The girl was born with brain damage a month and a half premature and died two days later. It is one of the first cases in Texas to test whether someone can be held criminally liable for harming an unborn child. <P> <B>Evidence pointing to the fact that prayer has a positive effect on healing is impressing an increasing number of physicians</B>, according to Dr. Larry Dossey, an author and former chief of staff at a Dallas hospital. Dossey's new book,<I> Prayer Is Good Medicine </I>(HarperSanFrancisco), explores common questions about prayer's healing benefits. <BR><B>...Recent studies underscore prayer's benefits in healing and illustrate faith's positive impact on life</B>, Dossey told <I>USA Today</I>. A study reported by the National Institute for Health Care Research showed that faith is important for a happy life among senior citizens. <P> <B>The Clinton-Gore campaign revised an advertisement airing on Christian stations</B> in response to pressure from homosexual-rights groups, Religion News Service said. The 60-second spot, airing on 70 stations, praised Clinton for signing the Defense of Marriage Act. The President &quot;has fought for our values,&quot; the original ad said. RNS said the ad offended the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the Human Rights Campaign, and ACT-UP, who asked for it to be removed.    </font></p>

</td><td width="470">&nbsp;<BR><table width="450"  align="center" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"><tr><td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 17, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...The central figure at the rally was again Louis Farrakhan</B>, leader of the Nation of Islam. He spoke for nearly three hours, discussing the need for nations to atone for violence and human rights violations. Farrakhan criticized the world's powerful nations for fueling the arms race, and chided the &quot;weak  nations&quot; that buy arms. Farrakhan denounced the United States as the world's leading weapons exporter and Saudi Arabia as the biggest buyer. &quot;I have to tell it, whether the kings like it or not,&quot; he said. Farrakhan also warned of an impending &quot;great cataclysmic war.&quot; <BR><B>...&quot;The U.S. government entered into a conspiracy to kill the (black) male</B> and spare the female,&quot; Farrakhan said. &quot;We are dying worse than they are in Northern Ireland, worse than they are in the Palestinian revolt, worse than they are in Bosnia. Black people are dying in the streets of America and no congressman speaks out against it. No president speaks out against it. No governor speaks out against it. They don't give a damn about what happens to the black man because they want you dead.&quot; <BR><B>...Speaking from a bulletproof glass case,</B> with thousands of New York City police officers nearby, Farrakhan called for lifting sanctions against Iraq and Cuba, and demanded recognition of the Palestinians' right to sovereignty. <P> <B>A white South African church leader formally apologized to Desmond Tutu for his silence concerning racial injustice</B>. &quot;We must confess that we backed away at crucial moments from letting a clear testimony against injustices being heard in the land,&quot; a Dutch Reformed Church leader said. He was representing the Stellenbosch group of congregations, which are part of the Dutch Reformed Church and have been derided as &quot;the apartheid regime at prayer,&quot; Ecumenical News International said.  <BR><B>...Tutu, the retired Anglican archbishop, has traveled throughout South Africa</B> since May hearing accounts from victims and their families of atrocities committed by former security police during the apartheid era. The confession was the first made formally to the panel, which Tutu calls the Truth Commission. After the Dutch Reformed leader spoke, Tutu walked up to him and other theologians in the delegation and embraced them, news reports said. <BR><B>...Many atrocities have come to light during the public hearings</B>, ENS said. In Paarl, an anti-apartheid activist said police stripped him and placed a snake around his neck, then left him in the room with a dog that repeatedly bit him. Another witness said her husband was found decapitated in a field; security police showed her the severed head. <P> <B>About 425 supporters of  a &quot;fidelity and chastity&quot; amendment to the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) constitution</B> met to plan their strategy last month in Chicago. If the amendment is approved, church officers would have to repent of any &quot;self-acknowledged practice&quot; that the denomination calls sin. The PCUSA's constitution, or Book of Order, describes acceptable sexual behavior as &quot;fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman, or chastity in singleness.&quot;  <BR><B>...A number of speakers called for less recrimination against others and more self-examination.</B> &quot;If we come to these debates with a hardness of heart that does not communicate the caring of Christ, we will lose,&quot; said speaker Roberta Hestenes, who chaired the General Assembly's Committee on Ordination and Human Sexuality, which drafted the amendment. Finger-pointing has characterized the denomination's debate about sexuality for the past 20 years, Presbyterian News Service said. <BR><B>...Voting on the amendment will be completed by next year's General Assembly</B> in Syracuse, N.Y. A majority of the presbyteries must ratify the amendment for it to become part of the church's constitution. Observers say the vote is too close to call. <P> <B>China has warned Hong Kong residents it will place limits on their freedom of expression</B> after the territory reverts to Beijing's rule on July 1, 1997, Reuters news service said. Liberties will remain, but within the law, the Chinese government said. China has promised to give Hong Kong, a British territory, political freedom for 50 years after the transfer of power, and has said it will not to change its capitalist system. <BR><B>...Foreign Minister Qian Qichen</B>, interviewed by the <I>Asian Wall Street Journal</I>, hinted that Hong Kong would no longer be able to mark the anniversary of Beijing's June 4, 1989, crackdown on student-led protests. That stirred an outcry in Hong Kong. <BR><B>...Christians in Argentina are organizing to pledge a million hours of prayer</B> on behalf of  Hong Kong Christians, Mission Network News said.  <P> <B>When four Christian workers in Shanxi Province, China, were arrested</B> for their faith, they led 26 fellow prisoners to Christ, according to Christian Aid Mission. <P> <B>The former New England treasurer of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, pleaded innocent</B> to charges he embezzled $800,000. Prosecutors say George A. Patrick, 55, used the denomination's money to send his children to college and pay for vacation homes, news reports said. <P> <B>South Africa's Roman Catholic Church denied an accusation that it paid for a woman to have an abortion</B> after she had<B> </B>sex with a priest, Reuters news reports said. The woman, who was not identified, told a parliamentary hearing on abortion that a bishop paid her hospital bills when she needed the abortion. The bishop denied he paid for the abortion, but &quot;spoke to her only after she had told him that she had the abortion,&quot; a church spokesman said. The National Assembly will vote Oct. 29 on whether to relax South Africa's abortion law, one of the world's strictest. <P> <B>A man who killed two elderly nuns and attacked two others</B> with a statue of the Virgin Mary in a Waterville, Maine, convent<B> </B>has been declared legally insane. Mark Bechard, 38, was declared not criminally responsible and will be sent to a mental institution rather than prison, news reports said. Bechard has been in and out of mental institutions 25 times, The Associated Press said. <P> <B>Indonesian authorities arrested 40 people for last week's arson attacks</B> by thousands of Muslims on churches around Situbondo in East Java, <I>the Jakarta Post</I> said. Authorities suspect the attacks were premeditated, Reuters said.    </font></p>

They argue that the injunction prevents interference with access to health care and disruptions to public safety. The injunction stops a campaign of  &quot;illegal harassment, intimidation, obstruction and trespass&quot; at abortion clinics, Lucinda Finley, representing the Pro-Choice Network of Western New York, told the court. <BR><B>...In practical terms, the injunction amounts to a ban on free speech anywhere near the clinics</B>, said Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice, who is representing abortion protesters Paul Schenck and Dwight Saunders. If someone orders a protester to back away, free speech stops -- even before a word is said, Sekulow told the court. A ruling in the case is expected next year. <P> <B>An ad campaign airing on some Christian radio stations claims President Clinton </B>opposes some late-term abortions. The ad, sponsored by Clinton's campaign, also notes that the President signed legislation to prevent homosexual marriages, <I>The Washington Post</I> said. <P> <B>Hundreds of people stood and prayed to become a Christian in south central Siberia</B> when the drama Heaven's Gates and Hell's Flames was performed, missionary Scott Holmes told Mission Network News. Churches in the area now are seeking to follow up on the new believers and incorporate them into congregations, he said. <P> <B>An increasing number of Muslim families in the United States are educating their children in private Islamic schools</B>. In the Washington, D.C., area, the demand for Islamic schooling far outstrips the supply, and consequently some Muslim families are educating their children at home,<I> The Washington Post</I> said. Many Muslim parents say values their children are exposed to in public schools conflict with the strict morality of Islam. The parents say their children have encountered prejudice and anti-Muslim stereotypes. <P> <B>A Scottish man who killed his suffering brother won't be sent to prison</B>. Paul Brady, 37, killed his brother James, 40, at his request last year. Brady gave his brother -- who suffered from Huntington's chorea, a debilitating, degenerative disease -- an overdose of medicine and put a pillow over his head, news reports said. The judge at Brady's trial, Lord Macfadyen, said he feared that the lenient sentence would send an unintended message, but was sure Brady's action, though unlawful, was done in compassion. <P> <B>A fight between two children in Egypt led to an all-out machine-gun battle</B> between their Coptic Christian and Muslim families, according to <I>The Strait Times</I> of Singapore. Twenty people were wounded in the incident, which took place in a village south of Cario, police said. <P> <B>The interests of children should come first when considering reproductive and genetic technologies</B>, evangelicals in Canada say. &quot;Children are not commodities,&quot; said Janet Epp Buckingham, spokesman for the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, commenting on proposed legislation. She applauded the legislation's ban on several controversial practices, including retrieval of sperm or eggs from cadavers or fetuses, and commercial surrogate arrangements. Buckingham also said research should be prohibited on embryos. <P> <B>A former headhunter who was the chief of a group of vicious warriors has become a Christian</B>. According to the DAWN FridayFax newsletter, the chief is a member of the Was tribe of the southeast Asian nation of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. The tribe asked for 100 Bibles and wanted to meet Christian missionaries. The missionaries reported that when the chief became a Christian, he was baptized by immersion, then ducked under the water one hundred times -- once for every head he had hunted. Afterward, he began promoting the <I>Jesus</I> film. <BR><B>...The<I> Jesus</I> film also has had an impact on Romania</B>. Campus Crusade for Christ, which produces and distributes the film about the life of Christ, said 185 new churches have been planted in Romania since 1991 as a result of showings of the film. More than a million people have seen the film in 16,076 showings, Campus Crusade said. <P> <B>Violence on network television declined somewhat last year from the previous TV season</B>, the UCLA Television Violence Report found. The study said a few series, some made-for-TV movies, and some of the theatrical features on television were more violent than was appropriate. Several popular children's shows feature &quot;sinister combat violence,&quot; the group said. The study analyzes whether the violence is appropriate and whether consequences are addressed, UPI reported. <P> <B>Carl Hunziker, an American citizen being held in North Korea on espionage charges</B>, met with a Swedish diplomat and denied having confessed to spying, the U.S. State Department said. Hunziker is reported to be in good health and has not been mistreated, Reuters news service said. North Korea's news agency, however, said Hunziker has been proven to be a spy and will have to pay the consequences. Hunziker was in the Far East to act as a Christian missionary, reports said.     </font></p>

There has been a vast spiritual vacuum here which the church has not effectively touched.&quot; <P> <B>Attacks  such as those on churches in East Java last week could happen again</B>, the leader of Indonesia's largest Islamic organization said. Abdurrahman Wahid, head of the 30-million person Nahdlatul Ulama, told Reuters that intolerance was the cause of  attacks on the 25 churches. Church groups in Surabaya say six people were killed, including a pastor, his wife and two children, who were trapped in a burning church. The mob was angered by a court hearing in a blasphemy case. Photos of the aftermath of the attacks can be found <A HREF= http://fica.visi.com/GerejaSBY/persecution.html>here.</A> <BR><B>...Some Islamic leaders promote a type of nationalism that derides other religions, Wahid said</B>. Instead, religious leaders should promote mutual understanding and &quot;be at home with pluralism in religion.&quot; <P> <B>Crowds packed an 8,000-seat hockey arena in Central Ontario, Canada</B>, Oct. 5-9 for a crusade led by Franklin Graham. Others watched from a 2,000-seat overflow arena equipped with a closed-circuit giant screen television. Some 1,200 people made decisions for Christ during the crusade, held in the city of Kitchener. Christian musicians Ricky Skaggs, Paul Overstreet, Dennis Agajanian, Crystal Lewis, and the Maranatha! Praise Band opened each evening's events. Special meetings were held for children and teenagers. Graham, the son of Billy Graham, also addressed 250 students and faculty at the University of Waterloo. <P> <B>Wycliffe Bible Translators is working on a new Scripture version in Persian</B>. It will present the gospel in the language of 100 million people, the group said. <P> <B>Homeless people in Moscow are being sent away against their will. </B> So far, the city has deported 6,000 homeless people, who have been detained for up to 30 days and loaded onto trains bound for villages where they grew up or were residents,<I> The New York Times</I> said. Police estimate 20,000 people live on the streets in Moscow, a city of  8 million. <P> <B>Pygmies and the Water People in Zaire reportedly are responding in large numbers to the gospel</B>. Churches are being formed in the equatorial forests through evangelistic efforts of families living near the rivers, AD2000 Unreached Peoples News said. Two missionaries in the Bosuka region have seen 7,000 formerly unreached people become Christians.  Near Kivu, 44 new churches have evangelists, deacons, and choirs.  <P> <B>Ecumenical organizations risk becoming service agencies</B> indistinguishable from other non-governmental organizations, an American ecumenist said. &quot;If they are not careful, the National Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches will be trapped into becoming secular service agencies, seeking funding from government and secular agencies,&quot; said Paul A. Crow, Jr., president of the Council for Christian Unity, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Crow, a member of the WCC Central Committee, said the WCC must resist the idea that the church must be &quot;servants of human causes.&quot; <P> <B>Republican vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp said he thinks Louis Farrakhan's message</B> of self-help last year at the Million Man March was &quot;wonderful.&quot; In a <I>Boston Globe</I> interview Sept. 8, Kemp said he does not endorse all of Farrakhan's teachings, but described the march as a &quot;celebration of responsible fatherhood, individual initiative...and getting an opportunity to be the man that God meant you to be.&quot;    <P> <B>A federal judge refused to throw out a defamation lawsuit filed by four professors</B> at Louisiana College, a Baptist school.  Judge Tom Yeager of Louisiana's 9th District Court in Alexandria ruled Sept. 24 that the defendants had a right to sue Leon Hyatt of Pineville and the theologically conservative group Hyatt led. The group wrote and mailed 21 letters criticizing the professors. <BR><B>...Judge Yeager said the criticisms were not protected by the First Amendment</B> since the dispute did not involve internal church matters, Associated Baptist Press said. Hyatt and the other defendants were acting on their own, without authority from an ecclesiastical body, the judge said.    </font></p>

Children and young people are suffering the most, according to their study of government statistics on 16 social problems<I>, The 1996 Index of Social Health</I>. Child abuse, teen-age suicide, drug abuse and the high school dropout rate all worsened in 1994, the report found.  <BR><B>...The report is &quot;a warning,&quot;</B> Marc Miringoff, director of the Institute for Innovation in Social Policy at the Fordham Graduate Center in Tarrytown, N.Y., told<I> The New York Times</I>. Miringoff noted pessimism among youth, isolation, less sense of community, and a teen suicide rate 95% higher than in 1970. <P> <B>A reported 500,000 people have seen the <I>Jesus </I>film in churches and homes in China</B> <B>in the last 12 months, </B>Mission Network News said. One fellowship of 30 Christians grew to 500 in a few years through weekly showings of the video drama, which depicts the life of  Christ. The film, distributed by Campus Crusade for Christ, is available in nine of China's primary languages. <P> <B>Vatican officials are debating if and when to disclose</B> what is causing Pope John Paul's left hand to tremble violently, Reuters news service said. The Vatican has not denied media reports that the Pope, 76, who underwent a successful appendectomy last week, may be suffering from Parkinson's disease or a related neurological disorder. The Pope also sometimes suffers from rigidity of the facial muscles and a slow, stooped gait, reports said; these also can be symptoms of Parkinson's or a related disorder. <P> <B>A cult leader in Taiwan admitted he swindled up to $3 billion</B> from thousands of followers, news reports said. &quot;Please don't believe in me any more,&quot; said Sung Chi-li, who had claimed he was the reincarnation of a &quot;cosmic body&quot; and had supernatural healing powers. During nine hours of  questioning by police, Sung was unable to display special powers. He tearfully confessed to defrauding his followers -- who had worshipped him like a god -- of land, cars, and cash, police said. <BR><B>...Sung attracted followings in Taiwan and China by using photographs that appeared to show him with a  halo</B> or levitating above the Great Wall, Reuters news service said.  A cult photographer arrested in the scam admitted that he faked the pictures. <P> <B>More than a million men have attended 20 Promise Keepers men's conferences so far this summer, </B>the organization said.<B> </B>Two conferences remain: at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium Oct. 18-19 and Texas Stadium in Irving Oct. 25-26. <BR><B>...Some 52,436 men attended the PK convention at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis</B>, Tenn., last weekend. Speakers included Christian author John Trent, psychologist Gary Oliver, and Prison Fellowship chairman Charles Colson. Teen-ager Shon Stewart, who has cerebral palsy, sang <I>These Things to Be True</I> from his wheelchair. The song focuses on the relationship between a father and son. <P> <B>The tragedy of  burned churches has resulted in an unprecedented spirit of cooperation</B> among blacks and whites of various religions, according to a leader of the rebuilding effort. Arsonists meant the fires  to harm, but God means them for good, according to Sullivan Robinson, deputy director of the Washington-based Congress of National Black Churches. She spoke to the National Rebuilding Initiative, a public and private effort to reconstruct dozens of burned churches. <P> <B>Abdurrahman Wahid, leader of Indonesia's largest Moslem group, apologized</B> and asked for forgiveness for an attack by a mob of  10,000 Muslims on churches in East Java last week, Reuters news service said. Reports said five people died in the rioting, and 21 Christian churches, five Catholic elementary schools, and one Christian orphanage were burned. The riot broke out after a court hearing in a case of alleged  blasphemy against Islam. Wahid said members of the group he leads, the 30-million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, probably were responsible for the destruction.  <P> <B>The government of Egypt placed 608 private mosques under state control</B> as part of a campaign to prevent Muslim extremists from using them to promote their ideas, UPI reported. The decree, which involved 21 mosques, is part of a plan to bring all mosques under control of  the Ministry of Religious Endowments. A proposed law would restrict the building of mosques by individuals and bar preachers not licensed by the government from serving at mosques. <P> <B>Armstrong Williams, an African-American conservative radio commentator</B>, will leave his call-in show with Salem Radio Network, a Christian network, to join the secular division of USA Radio Network, <I>The Washington Post</I> said.     </font></p>

Human rights groups say a third of East Timor's population, or about 200,000 people, died during the invasion, subsequent fighting, or famine. <BR><B>...Indonesian troops killed dozens of pro-independence East Timorese protesters in 1991</B>. Bishop Belo prompted the government to investigate the killings, which led to the dismissal of two generals and the imprisonment of several army officers.  <BR><B>...The Noble Peace Prize committee said it hoped to focus world attention</B> on East Timor's struggle for independence, which it said is in danger of being forgotten by the rest of the world. The island is located midway between the Indonesian island of Java and the northwestern tip of Australia. Indonesia expressed &quot;regret&quot; at the awards. <P> <B>JAKARTA, Indonesia</B> - Five people died inside a church when a mob burned nine churches, four Christian schools, and a convent in the Indonesian town of Situbondo, on Java island, Reuters news service said. Some 2,000-3,000 people rioted during the incident. The crowd also destroyed a court building and cars, police said. Several arrests reportedly have been made. <BR><B>...The riot apparently broke out after a court hearing in a case of alleged blasphemy against Islam</B>, a journalist in Situbondo said. Several thousand people outside the court demanded that the accused be sentenced immediately or handed over to the crowd. Indonesia is overwhelmingly Moslem, but the state preaches religious tolerance and recognizes five main religions. Situbondo is 100 miles east of  Surabaya, where attacks on churches were reported in June. <P> <B>SLOVAKIA</B> -  For the first time, family issues will be aired from an evangelical perspective on national radio. Beginning this weekend, short, weekly programs will use material from Focus On the Family, Mission Network News said. Listeners who respond to the programs will receive printed information.  <P> <B>WASHINGTON, D.C</B>. - A commission being created to study gambling's impact on society is in danger of  stacking the deck in favor of appointees tied to the industry, two lawmakers said. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), who sponsored the bill that created the commission, and Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), said they were concerned by reports that two pro-gambling appointments to the commission were being considered. One member of the 9-person committee already has been appointed: James Dobson, president of Focus on the Family. <P> <B>KABUL, Afghanistan</B> - The two-week old administration of the radical Islamic Taleban is looking precarious, reports said. Its militia has faced guerrilla assaults near the Afghan capital by commanders and units loyal to former military chief Ahmad Rashid Masood. Also, foes to the north have formed a military alliance. <BR><B>...Moderate elements in the Taleban may welcome talks</B> with rivals, Reuter news service said. But more hard-line Taleban leaders may want to push through their Jihad (Holy War) to its conclusion. <P> <B>NORTH KOREA</B> - Evan Carl Hunziker, an American being detained in North Korea on espionage charges, will get a visit today from a Swedish envoy acting in the interest of the U.S. government, the State Department said. Hunziker, who went to the Far East as an unaffiliated Christian missionary, was arrested on Aug. 24 after crossing from China. <P> <B>JERUSALEM, Israel</B>  - Jerusalem police were on alert Friday against possible renewed Israeli-Palestinian violence. They feared that Jewish extremists would try to attack the Temple Mount before a small, new mosque opens there next week near the controversial archeological tunnel operated by Israel. Violence erupted two weeks ago when Israel opened an exit to the tunnel; 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis were killed. <P> <B>NEW DELHI, India</B> - McDonald's is opening its first restaurant in India next week. In keeping with Hindu religious practices, the restaurant's Maharaja Mac sandwich will contain no beef, company officials said. Hindus, who make up 80% of  India's 940 million people, do not eat beef, and many are vegetarians. The Maharaja Mac will contain mutton, eaten by Hindus and Muslims. <P> <B>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla</B>. -- Astronaut Shannon Lucid, who returned Sept. 26 after an 188-day space flight, is the daughter of Baptist missionaries. Asked if her spiritual life has been changed by the flight -- the longest by an American -- she said, &quot;I like to think that it was the same as it was basically my whole life. The location of  where you are, to me, doesn't necessarily affect your spiritual life.&quot;    </font></p>

As a result, all Lutheran bishops eventually would be incorporated into the &quot;historic succession,&quot; or continuity in the ordination of bishops from the early church to the present. Sixteenth century Lutheran reformers stressed the functions of ordained ministry over tradition. <BR><B>...At the meeting, Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey drew parallels</B> between the Concordat and a new agreement between the Anglicans and Lutherans in northern Europe. &quot;Will the mission of the church be stronger for unity?  My unhesitating answer is yes, it will be,&quot; Carey said. <P> <B>A small mosque is opening in the Israeli Parliament building in Jerusalem</B>. It will serve as a prayer room for the Arab members of the Knesset, the <I>Jerusalem Post</I> said. The prayer room is furnished with prayer mats, a closet for prayer books, and a picture of the Aksa Mosque on Temple Mount. <P> <B>New Jersey is using finger scanning to identify welfare applicants &quot;double dipping&quot; by applying in more than one location</B> under false names and counterfeit ID cards, Intercessors for America said. New York will cooperate with New Jersey, using computerization of the fingerprint patterns of welfare recipients, IFA said. <BR><B>...Other states are expected to use finger scanning</B>, building a nationwide network, IFA said. Credit cards and check-out counters soon will use fingerprint scanning.    <P> <B>Oct. 11 is National Coming Out of Homosexuality Day</B> -- organized to help people who want to leave the homosexual lifestyle -- as well as National Coming Out Day, organized to affirm the homosexual lifestyle. Conservatives also have formed the group Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays. <P> <B>Christian pen pals in North America are being sought to disciple new believers in Russia</B>. Dan Wooding of ASSIST Ministries said he has received 76,000 letters from new believers in the former Soviet Union -- many of  them young people -- who are looking for pen pals in the West. For a packet of information, contact ASSIST at P. O. Box 2126, Garden Grove, CA 92842-2126. Call (800) 222-6441 to be enrolled over the phone. <P> <B>Several hundred Christians from a variety of denominations</B> marched through downtown Sydney, Australia, Oct. 7 carry placards in support of marriages between a male and female. The marchers denounced what they described as subtle actions taking place in society to undermine marriage. Moves are being made in the Uniting Church and the government to downgrade marriage as society has always known it, the marchers said. The march closed with speeches, prayer, and hymn-singing. <P> <B>More than 2,000 Muslim texts now are available on CD-ROM</B> as part of a project to make 5,000 of the most significant Islamic works available on computer, <I>The Christian Science Monitor</I> said. Eventually, they will put these volumes on the Internet for worldwide use. <BR><B>...Muslim scholars in Qom, Iran, are entering the information onto computers.</B> Each volume takes 500 hours to input and edit. Most are interpretations of the Koran and its laws that have been analyzed and passed down by Muslim scholars since Islam began in the 7th century. Recently, scholars from the Vatican visited Qom to examine references to Christianity in Islamic texts. <P> <B>The picture emerging from arrests in the arson attacks on African-American churches in the South is complex</B>, <I>The Washington Post</I> said. More than a third of the suspects charged in recent months in the attacks are black, according to federal law enforcement officials. In the past 21 months, two-thirds of those arrested for burning black churches have been white and 34% African American. The figures suggest that while race is factor in some cases, other motivations are involved, <I>The Post </I>said. <BR><B>...The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights said Wednesday,</B> after issuing its report on black church fires in the South, that it would formulate a grass-roots plan to bridge the divide. It plans to meet with Southern governors and political leaders before implementing community-based programs promoting racial tolerance. <P>   <P> <B>Lutheran theologian Walter Wangerin, Jr., has developed a liturgy to be used after a divorce</B>. The church uses rituals for other situations involving grief, but &quot;at the death of a marriage, the church remains distant and mute -- baffled perhaps since it presumes sin in divorce.&quot; But &quot;forgiveness is our stock in trade,&quot; he said. <P> <B>A 10-minute break is church time for Sunday workers at a tire-manufacturing plant</B> in Roanoke, Va.  About 60 of the 200 employees at Yokohama Tire Corp. gather in the lobby to recite the Lord's Prayer and listen to a lay preacher speak. Then employees join hands and pray for fellow workers who have been laid off or become ill. After a quick exchange of handshakes and some hugs, they return to the production floor. It's better than a cup of coffee, and it makes it feel like the Lord's day even though its a work day, employees say.    </font></p>

The action was taken at a conference in Minsk, Belarus, by delegates from 21 churches and Christian organizations, including Orthodox, Roman Catholics, Baptists, Old Believers (Old Ritualists), Lutherans, and Seventh-day Adventists, Ecumenical News International said. <BR><B>...The Russian Orthodox Church has condemned proselytizing</B> by foreign Protestant missionaries who arrived in the former Soviet Union after the political changes of the late 1980s. A final document at the Minsk conference condemned conversions from one church to another through ways &quot;contradicting the spirit of Christian love and violating the freedom of a human person.&quot; <P> <B>A United Methodist clergyman who has been ordained as a Catholic priest wants to remain part of both churches</B>. W. Paul Jones describes himself as having a &quot;Protestant mind and a Catholic heart,&quot; and says he feels called to bring both churches &quot;the neglected wealth preserved by the other,&quot; United Methodist News Service said. &quot;May my intent to live faithfully in both of these traditions be a small ecumenical step toward the day when we shall affirm that we truly are one in Christ,&quot; Jones said . A decision on his status as a UMC elder is expected to be made late this month. <BR><B>...&quot;Something deep happened within me, a coming home&quot; during a visit to a Trappist monastery</B> in 1972, Jones said. He described the experience as Wesleyan spirituality that the UMC has lost. For three years, Jones spent six months each year teaching theology at UMC-related Saint Paul School of Theology in Kansas City and six months living in a Trappist monastery. <P> <B>Hot-dog evangelism is working in Utica, N.Y.</B>  Foursquare Church member Mark Bolo opened a mobile  stand on a busy street and began giving away hot dogs, drinks, and Christian tracks to passers-by, Discipling A Whole Nation said. <BR><B>...He saw results quickly</B>. One man said he didn't know what he could feed his two daughters. Although he did not often pray, he sat in his car and quietly said, &quot;God, what can I do?&quot; At the next light, the man came across Bolo. In another instance, a bar owner asked Bolo to set up his stand in front of his business, then opened his games room and dance floor for Christian concerts.  <BR><B>...About 40 people have shown an interest in becoming Christians as a result of the stand</B>, Bolo said. Because someone &quot;gave the people something instead of talking, hearts were opened,&quot; he said. <P> <B>Christian conservatives are irked that the presidential candidates are downplaying issues such as abortion,</B> homosexual rights, and attacks on religious liberty. Conservatives are likely to feel disenfranchised by both parties if such issues are avoided, as they were in the Oct. 6 presidential debate, said Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council. If the issues are not raised in the next debate, &quot;Bill Clinton is going to be re-elected,&quot; he said.  <BR><B>...Pat Robertson said he is anticipating &quot;a blowout this November&quot;</B> for Clinton, news reports said. Robertson made the comment Monday during the <I>700 Club</I> program. <P> <B>Lawyers for John G. Bennett, Jr., will argue in court that Bennett was insane while he ran the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy</B>, Religion News Service reported. Bennett was indicted Sept. 27 on 82 counts of defrauding charities, including a number of  evangelical Christian groups. Prosecutors say New Era ran a ponzi scheme that was the biggest charity fraud in U.S. history.  Bennett has pleaded not guilty to charges of wire, mail, and bank fraud. <P> <B>Americans who gave money to charities last year contributed an average of 10% more than in 1993</B>, a Gallup Organization study found. But more households gave nothing, according to the study. <BR><B>...The average contribution per household was $1,017. </B> Some 69% said their households gave to charity last year, down from 73% who gave in 1993 and the lowest rate in eight years. <BR><B>...An increasing number of  Americans distrust the way charities use their money.</B> The percentage who disagreed with the statement &quot;most charitable organizations are honest and ethical in their use of funds&quot; has increased from 20% in 1990 to 31% this year. <P> <B>Evan Carl Hunziker, the American arrested in North Korea and accused  of spying</B>, was &quot;only trying to preach the Gospel&quot; after converting to Christianity last year, his father said. Hunziker, 26, got into alcohol, drugs and trouble with the law, but sobered up and converted to Christianity during a 90-day jail term for drunken driving in Alaska, said Edwin Hunziker of Parkland, Wash. He said his son went to Korea in August intending to get a job and preach Christianity. <BR><B>...Evan &quot;doesn't know the first thing about spying, unless somebody in South Korea educated him</B> right quick in a month,&quot; Hunziker said. Evan's mother said her son was divorced from a South Korean woman three years ago, speaks Korean well, and intended to become a missionary, <I>The Seattle Times</I> said. <BR><B>...North Korean diplomats said Hunziker is being charged with illegal entry and espionage</B>, which could result in a death sentence. An American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hunziker had not worked for the U.S. government as a spy or in any other capacity. <P> <B>Some 250 middle- and high school students marched out of classes</B> in Elizabethtown, N.J., Tuesday. They were protesting their school's resolution that says &quot;pro-homosexual concepts on sex and family will never be tolerated or accepted in this school.&quot; The students also objected to the resolution's description of the two-parent family as &quot;the norm,&quot; news reports said. Some of the students carried signs, and more than a dozen parents attended the demonstration in support. <P> <B>Large parts of Britain probably won't have enough full-time Church of  England parish priests by the end of the century.</B>  According to a report, a recruitment crisis in the church forecasts that by 2001 the number of  full-time male clergy will have fallen by 1,175 to 8,007, <I>The London Times</I> said. There will be about 9,000 full-time men and women priests in the Church by the turn of the century, leaving at least 4,000 parishes without a minister.     </font></p>

The conference, organized by the Serbian Evangelical Alliance, received positive coverage in television and print media, according to Lazar Stojsic, president of the Evangelical Alliance in Belgrade. <P> <B>Swiss Christians are praying for revival in their country,</B> where many people have fallen away from the church and are indifferent to it. Some 450 leaders of various denominations met in Zurich Sept. 21 to confess their failings and exhort one another to use creative means for evangelism. The gathering was the largest such meeting of its kind, its organizers, FocuSuisse, told Discipling A Whole Nation. <BR><B>...About 120 Christians from various churches held a prayer march along the German border</B> near Schaffhausen on Sept. 15. The aim was to repent for Switzerland's return of fleeing Jews to Nazi Germany and for Swiss arrogance towards Germany, said Ramu Bhalla, leader of a Schaffhausen church. <P> <B>Pope John Paul had his appendix removed Tuesday in an operation that found no sign of a tumor</B> or other serious illness, chief surgeon Francesco Crucitti said. The Pope, 76, showed no ill effects from the  50-minute operation, which did not reveal a recurrence of the tumor Crucitti removed from the Pope's colon in 1992. <P> <B>The AIDS epidemic is more diverse in the United States than previously thought</B>, scientists say. In 1994, doctors in France found a hard-to-diagnose strain of AIDS, named Group O.<B> </B>The strain previously was found only in West Africa. Last July, doctors found the first Group O case in the United States. Then last month, scientists found a second U.S. resident infected with this rare type of HIV. Researchers also are investigating several New York City residents who have signs of still another AIDS strain never before seen in the United States. <BR><B>...Researchers are looking for AIDS strains worldwide to ensure that tests for HIV are able to detect</B> every type of the disease. HIV tests are designed to detect a region's most common strains, but doctors are increasingly concerned whether they will catch rare, foreign strains. <P> <B>The Catholic Diocese of St. Petersburg, Fla., is reeling from a series of revelations</B> involving marriage, homosexuality, and sexual abuse, United Press International said. The incidents involve three priests: <BR><B>...On Oct. 1, Patrick Clarke, 62, pastor of Espiritu Santu parish</B> in Safety Harbor, had married a woman in a civil ceremony in 1981. Clarke is on paid leave, UPI said. <BR><B>...The next day, it was revealed that Rev. Simeon Gardner, 69, had diverted $220,000</B> in church funds for  three years to a man with whom he had &quot;improper and impermissible sexual conduct,&quot; the diocese said. <BR><B>...Two days later, the diocese confirmed that Rev. William Lau of St. Petersburg</B> is on leave of absence and undergoing counseling after a complaint by a man alleging sexual misconduct had occurred &quot;many years prior.&quot; <P> <B>Roderick Wright, the Catholic Bishop of Argyll, said he will marry Kathleen Macphee</B>, the divorced mother of three with whom he ran away. Wright's resignation and disappearance three weeks ago shocked the Church in Scotland. He also said he would have to accept the fact that after 32 years as a priest he would never say Mass again. <P> <B>The United States warned Taleban Islamic rulers in Kabul that they risk forfeiting war-reconstruction aid</B> for Afghanistan if they continue to restrict women's rights. Since the Taleban movement captured Kabul two weeks ago, it has prohibited women from working. <BR><B>...United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali also warned Taleban rulers</B> that the U.N. objects to the extreme discrimination they practice against women. He warned of  &quot;serious repercussions&quot; for the foreign aid programs there, the <I>New York Times</I> said. The U.N., working with a large number of  relief organizations, is the most important source of aid to Afghanistan. <P> <B>The United States will send a senior official to South Korea as tensions rise</B> over the intrusion of a North Korean submarine and North Korea's arrest of a Christian missionary on spy charges, news reports said. Washington has demanded that North Korea free Evan Carl Hunzike, 26, a Christian missionary and U.S. citizen arrested Oct. 6 on charges of spying for South Korea . <BR><B>...The purpose of the American diplomat's trip is to reassure South Korea</B>, an official said. South Korean newspapers have accused President Clinton of  appeasing North Korea to keep peace on the Korean peninsula at any cost before November's presidential elections. <P> <B>American cities and suburbs have reported dramatic increases in heroin usage and deaths</B> in the past 1 1/2 years, news report say. Some studies estimate the number of heroin addicts in the United States at 1 million. Heroin is increasingly popular among young people since it is being glamorized by rock musicians, it is more available, and cheaper than in the past, experts say. <P> <B>British clergy are being taught to cope with drunks, drug addicts, and thieves</B> who increasingly come to their doorsteps demanding money, <I>The London Times</I> said. A number of conferences throughout the country address the problem. Clergy and their wives face growing threats of violence from beggars, many of whom are mentally ill or want money for drugs.  <BR><B>...Clergy also are under threat from the public</B>. As respect for the church has declined, clerics sometimes are bullied and intimidated by the public, <I>The Times</I> said. The Christian command to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; means many are unwilling or do not know how to fight, <I>The Times</I> said.    </font></p>

About 100 delegates, including those who have seceded from the Christian Reformed denomination in recent years, met to organize the new denomination. <BR><B>...The URC synod issued a letter encouraging a hundred conservative Christian Reformed churches</B>, called the Interclassical Conference, that have remained in the United Reformed Church. The conference has warned the Christian Reformed Church of a possible secession unless the denomination reverses its decision to allow the ordination of women ministers and elders. The URC is the largest of  several secessionist movements in the Christian Reformed Denomination. <BR><B>...The Christian Reformed Church has lost about 25,000 members in the last four years</B>, dropping to 291,796 this year. About 18,000 of those members have joined secession churches opposed to the ordination of women. <P>   <P> <B>The U.S. Supreme Court today rejected a challenge to the Freedom of Access to Clinics Entrances Act</B>, the law that protects access to abortion clinics. The appellants were five Wisconsin pro-life protesters arrested for blockading the Wisconsin Women's Health Care Center in Milwaukee in 1994. Protesters blocked the front and rear doors to the clinic with cars and welded and handcuffed themselves to the cars, news reports said. <BR><B>...The justices let stand a ruling that said Congress acted within its authority</B> to regulate interstate commerce when it passed FACE in 1994. Three federal appeals courts previously have upheld the law. In each of those cases, the Supreme Court let stand the decisions upholding the law. <P>     <P> <B>Public schools can continue to make charitable work a graduation requirement</B>, the Supreme Court decided today. The justices rejected, without comment, the appeal of Daniel Immediato, a former student at Rye Neck High School in Mamaroneck, N.Y., who was denied a diploma because he refused to participate in a mandatory community-service program. The school required all students to perform 40 hours of community service before graduation. Work for a variety of not-for-profit corporations, charities, political organizations or public agencies would qualify. <BR><B>...Immediato and his parents argued that decisions to serve others</B> should be determined by the family and conscience, not government edict. An estimated 8% of the nation's public school districts have such mandatory service programs. <P> <B>A proposed parental-rights amendment to Colorado's Constitution</B> has led to sharp debate. Proponents of Amendment 17 want protection for the &quot;inalienable right&quot; of parents to &quot;direct and control the upbringing, education, values and discipline of their children.&quot; Supporters say they are tired of battling schools, health-service organizations, and other agencies for control of their children. They say Amendment 17 would protect families against government meddling. <BR><B>...Opponents say parents already have the right to raise children the way they see fit</B>. They worry that the amendment would harm those most in need of help by keeping children in abusive homes and making it harder to prosecute child-abuse cases. Opponents include teachers' unions, the national Parent Teachers Association, and the American Civil Liberties Union,  <BR><B>...Signatures of more than 80,000 registered voters were gathered</B> to put the measure on the ballot.  A poll taken Sept. 3-5 by the <I>Rocky Mountain News</I> found 76% in favor of the amendment, 11% said they opposed the proposal, and 13% were undecided. <P> <B>Worship of Satan has penetrated institutions in Keyna</B>, a government commission found. The commission, appointed by President Daniel arap Moi in 1994, was led by Roman Catholic Archbishop Nicodemus Kirima and included representatives of  Kenyan society, Ecumenical News Service said. Information was gathered from self-confessed devil worshippers and corroborated from independent sources. <BR><B>...Evidence of  devil worship is plentiful,</B> the commission said in a two-page summary of its report. It includes kidnapping of children, rape, child abuse, murders, and the severing of tongues, eyes and limbs. Also occurring is human sacrifice, drinking human blood, black masses, nudity at rituals, use of drugs and snakes, and homosexuality and lesbianism, the report said. The president said the government is taking action to &quot;curb the evil practices,&quot; and advised the public to stop getting involved in devil worship. <P> <B>Kabul's middle class -- doctors, lawyers, engineers and their families -- have begun an exodus from the Afghan capital </B>after last week's victory of the Taleban militia. The radical Taleban seeks to establish a strict Islamic state. Taleban fighters seized the capital from the relatively moderate Islamic government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani. <BR><B>...Before dawn, families creep from their homes and head to the Kabul River</B>, hauling trunks and burlap sacks full of clothing and household goods, the<I> New York Times</I> reported. There, they wait for minibuses that go east to Jalalabad. Then, many switch to camel routes into Pakistan. <BR><B>...Kabul's schools and colleges have not reopened</B> since women have been forbidden to hold jobs outside the home and 70% of teachers are women. Some women doctors and nurses are working at hospitals, where they may care for female patients, but others have not returned for fear of harassment. <BR><B>...Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei criticized Afghanistan's Taleban movement</B> as &quot;un-Islamic&quot; and said it was backed by the United States, Reuters news service said. <P> <B>Pope John Paul's announced appendix surgery, scheduled for Tuesday, has begun a flurry of  speculation</B> from the media  that he may be more seriously ill and suffering from a tumor, news reports said. The Vatican has dismissed such speculation. <BR><B>...The Pope's left hand trembled violently Sunday at a service in St. Peter's Square</B>, Reuters news service said. This occurrence, along with facial rigidity and a stooped gait, could indicate Parkinson's Disease. The Vatican has not denied such reports. The pope underwent surgery twice in 1981 after suffering gunshot injuries in an assassination attempt, and again in 1992, when doctors removed a benign tumor from his colon.  <P> <B>Mothers should forgo full-time jobs in favor of raising their children at home</B>, Mormon Church president Gordon Hinckley said. It is nearly impossible to be a full-time homemaker and a full-time employee, he said in a sermon directed to the women of his 9.6-million member church. Women who work outside the home should do so to meet basic needs and &quot;not simply to indulge a taste for an elaborate home, fancy cars, and other luxuries,&quot; he said. <P> <B>Some 300 men on death row in Russian prisons </B>received New Testaments distributed by the Bible Society of Russia. <B> </B>&quot;I will pray the Lord Jesus Christ to set me in the right way,&quot;  one prisoner said in response to the gift. <P> <B>An Assemblies of God pastor has entered Nicaragua's presidential race</B>. Guillermo Osorno would get 3.8% of the vote, according to a survey taken in Managua last month. But Osomo told Ecumenical News International that polls conducted by his party, the Christian Path, put him at between 14%-22% of the vote. <BR><B>...The main two rivals for president</B> -- Arnoldo Aleman and former Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega of the Sandinista National Liberation Front -- share about 75% of the vote, with none of the other 21 presidential candidates previously registering more than 2%. A strong showing by Osomo would prevent either Aleman or Ortega from getting at least 45%, necessitating a runoff. Evangelicals make up about a quarter of Nicaragua's population. Balloting is Oct. 20.    </font></p>

In court, the man said he could not get work in Togo, that drugs to treat him were scarce, and that HIV-positive people are ostracized. The case may be the first U.S. court ruling stemming from the White House's policy this year that gives preferential treatment to immigrants who have AIDS or are HIV-positive, <I>The Washington Times</I> reported. <P> <B>The controversial Halloween Hell House will be back this year in Arvada, Colo</B>. The display is sponsored by Abundant Life Christian Center, a Pentecostal church. It is modeled after a traditional haunted house, but contains scenes depicting a woman who has just undergone an abortion, a funeral for an AIDS sufferer, a drunken driver who kills his family in a car accident, and a teen-age suicide victim. The gruesome scenes depict what happens when people reject the Bible, the pastor told the Associated Press. There also will be a Heaven House exhibit for children. Abundant Life is selling how-to kits to other churches that want to set up their own Hell Houses. <P> <B>Lutherans and Catholics opened an elementary school together in Youngstown, Ohio, this fall</B>. New Hope Academy -- known since 1914 as St. Patrick School -- is sponsored by the Northeastern Ohio Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Catholic Dioceses of Youngstown, and run by Ursaline Sisters. There are two Lutheran teachers on staff, and students who are interested can learn about Lutheranism, the ELCA news service reported. <P> <I><B>Money</B></I><B> magazine named five schools that are members of the Coalition for Christian Colleges</B> and Universities in its rankings of best college buys. Last year, <I>Money</I> had a policy that excluded most religious schools. The magazine reversed its stance after appeals from a number of groups, the CCCU said. The CCCU schools listed in the magazine are: Gordon College, Wenham, Mass; Goshen College, Goshen, Ind.; Tabor College, Hillsboro, Kan.; Trinity Christian College, Palos Heights, Ill.; and Wheaton College, Wheaton, Ill. <BR><B>...Although not included in the ranking because it does not charge tuition</B>, College of the Ozarks, in Missouri, was cited by <I>Money </I>as a &quot;great deal.&quot;  Students pay for their tuition by working on campus 15 hours a week, plus two 40-hour weeks each semester, CCCU said. <P> <B>Pope John Paul II is being hospitalized to remove his appendix. The Vatican denied a report</B> by the Italian news agency <I>ASCA</I> that the pope, 76, may be suffering from a new tumor. The pope had a colon tumor removed in 1992. <P> <B>Ethnic killings among the Tutsi and Hutu in the central African country of Burundi threaten to escalate into genocide</B> like that experienced by its neighbor to the north, Rwanda, in 1994, Christian relief workers say. Since a coup in July, Burundi has been ruled outside of its multi-party, democratic constitution. A comprehensive, international peace plan is necessary to prevent genocide, relief workers told Ecumenical News Service. The peace plan should include a cease-fire, material aid, an embargo on arms shipments to the region, monitoring of human rights, and security assistance from neighboring states, relief workers said. <P> <B>Poland's upper chamber of parliament voted Thursday to reject liberalization of the country's strict, church-sponsored anti-abortion law</B>. However, Poland's lower chamber, which voted Aug. 30 to liberalize the law, still may overrule the upper chamber. President Aleksander Kwasniewski said he would sign the bill, which allows abortions up until the 12th week of pregnancy. Thousands of  protesters pushed baby carriages and prayed outside the Warsaw parliament building during the vote, news reports said. <P> <B>Canada's Supreme court agreed to hear an appeal by a homosexual</B> who was fired by The King's University College in Edmonton, Alberta, which has strong religious views against homosexuality, Reuter news service reported. The court's ruling could set policy for how far Canadian courts can force an end to discrimination. <BR><B>...The appellant, Delwin Vriend, was dismissed in 1991 as a laboratory coordinator</B>. At issue is whether Alberta's human rights act violates the federal constitution's Charter of Rights since it does not ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Vriend was successful in a trial court, but that ruling was overturned before he appealed to the Supreme Court. <P> <B>Pat Robertson's daily hour-long talk show, the <I>700 Club</I>, is broadcasting on New York superstation</B> WWOR. This gives the Virginia Beach, Va., evangelist a potential audience of 92% of U.S. television households, since WWOR is picked up by  cable systems and other stations across the country. <P> <B>A woman in China walked 200 miles to mail a letter</B> to Trans World Radio's Chinese Ministry International. The letter told about the woman's conversion to faith in Christ. &quot;Such is the impact that the gospel is having on this nation, still gripped by atheism and other religious beliefs,&quot; TWR said. <P>      </font></p>

About half a million Rwandans died in the ethnic bloodbath; some clergy have been accused of participating in the massacres. <BR><B>...There are 806 Adventist congregations in Rwanda, with 285,440 members</B>, Adventist News Service said. The Adventist relief agency ADRA provides relief supplies to Rwandan refugees in Zaire and Burundi. <P> <B>The issue of  women in the ministry continues to stir controversy in the Christian Reformed Church</B>. On Sept. 29, Eastern Avenue Christian Reformed Church in Grand Rapids, Mich, ordained  Mary Antonides, 26, as its pastor and the denomination's second femal minister, Reformed News Service said. But the denomination's Northern Michigan classis, meeting Sept. 24, voted 18-13 not to ordain Mary-Lee Bouma. Last year, the CRC Synod voted to give each classis autonomy in deciding the issue of women's ordination.  <BR><B>...Two CRC churches seceded from the denomination because of the denomination's decision to allow women ministers</B>. They are Bethany CRC in South Holland, Ill., and  Franklin Lakes CRC in New Jersey. Rev. Daniel Bratt of the Franklin Lakes CRC told the news service that allowing women to become ministers indicates &quot;the authority of Scripture is being eroded in the practices of the church.&quot; <P> <B>The United Methodist Church is confused about its identity and mission</B>, according to an evangelical group within the denomination. The group Good News, meeting  Sept. 25-27 in Wilmore, Ky., issued <I>A Resolution to a Church in Crisis, </I>United Methodist News Service said. The document calls on the UMC's Council of Bishops to preach and practice &quot;the doctrinal standards and moral principals of the church&quot; or to resign. <BR><B>...The beliefs of  some UMC leaders on homosexuality are &quot;contrary to Wesleyan theology,&quot;</B> Good News said. The group said it opposes the Reconciling Congregation program, a movement that welcomes full inclusion of homosexuals into the church. That  movement &quot;promotes a counterfeit gospel of grace without repentance, and salvation without transformation,&quot; Good News said. Instead, Good News supports the ministry of Transforming Congregations, a movement which it says &quot;offers a warm and welcoming place for those struggling with homosexuality&quot; and &quot;proclaims the biblical understanding that homosexual behavior is sin, and that hope and healing are available.&quot; <BR><B>...Good News board members said they would help organize people in the UMC who want to withhold their giving</B> from programs they consider &quot;inconsistent with the Gospel.&quot; <P> <B>The case of a British woman who tried giving birth to octuplets has raised questions</B> about who should receive fertility treatment. Mandy Allwood, 31, took a fertility drug, then ignored medical advice to avoid sex for a while. The babies all died. The six boys and two girls were laid in a cot beside Allwood's bed, Reuter news service said. <BR><B>...Critics said doctors should not have given Allwood the treatment</B> since she already had a child and took the drugs in an attempt to save a troubled relationship. She is a divorced single mother. Nicholas Coote of  the Catholic Bishops' Conference told Reuters news service that only married couples should  be eligible to receive fertility treatment. <BR><B>...In a separate case in England, a 30-year-old widow is fighting for the right to be impregnated</B> with her dead husband's sperm. The Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority refused permission, saying she did not have his written consent. In July, the authority ordered the destruction of thousands of  fetuses created by in-vitro fertilization because they had passed a legal deadline. <BR><B>...British doctors also were criticized this summer for agreeing to a selective abortion </B>of one of a pair of  fetuses after the mother said she could afford only one child. <P> <B>Gypsies in Central and East Europe will soon be able to hear the gospel on radio in their native tongue.</B> The Bulgarian Baptist Union plans to begin the broadcasts on AM radio in the Romani language beginning Oct. 28, according to Trans World Radio. Romani is spoken by 1.5 million Gypsies in Bulgaria, the former Yugoslavia, and neighboring countries. The dialect also is understood by most other Gypsies in those areas. Listeners who respond to the 15-minute programs will be invited to join fellowship groups. Gypsies have often been ostracized and targets of hatred, TWR said. TWR also plans next year to begin programs in the Kalderash Romani dialect, spoken by 1 million Gypsies. <P> <B>A man who wants to become a notary public is challenging</B>  the South Carolina constitution's requirement that public officers acknowledge the existence of God. Herb Silverman, an atheist who is a 54-year-old math professor at the College of Charleston, is taking his case to the state's Supreme Court today. A lower court threw out the constitution's so-called &quot;God clause,&quot; which has been part of the document since 1886. The state appealed the ruling. Becoming a notary public is not the main issue; changing the state constitution is, Silverman told the Associated Press. <P> <B>In France, ex-followers of  the Church of Scientology are accusing the religion</B> of  pressuring them psychologically and extracting large amounts of money from them, news reports said. Their testimony came during the trial of 23 French Scientologists. The church members are accused of charges ranging from manslaughter and embezzlement to fraud in the 1988 suicide of a church follower. The trial, held in Lyon, is expected to provide a glimpse into the church's inner workings. <BR><B>...One former Scientologist said church officers shouted questions at her</B> as she was made to stand against a wall with arms apart. She also said she gave the church $200,000 over four years, Reuters reported. A Catholic priest said he gave the church $100,000, which  he had received from an elderly woman, for &quot;purification sessions,&quot; the news service said. <BR><B>...Prosecutors say the church exploited gullible victims for money</B> through &quot;pseudo-scientific and paramedical means&quot; and also caused them &quot;medical and psychological risk.&quot; If found guilty, the defendants could go to jail for five years and be fined $1 million. A Church of Scientology spokesman denounced the trial as &quot;the return of the Inquisition.&quot; <P> <B>Los Angeles is considering naming a Hollywood street after Scientology founder L. Ron  Hubbard.</B> The City Council voted  Tuesday to change Berendo Street to L. Ron Hubbard Way, the Associated Press said. A second vote next week would make the change official. <P> <B>William Murray, a Protestant minister and the son of  atheist leader Madalyn Murray O'Hair</B>, filed a missing person report on his mother, news reports said. O'Hair, who filed the lawsuit that led to the 1963 Supreme Court decision that banned compulsory prayers in public schools,  has not been seen for 13 months, police said. O'Hair, 77, her son, Jon, and daughter, Robin, vanished after years of crusading against organized religion. Police assigned an investigator to the case.    </font></p>

Instead, the WCC must institute &quot;basic changes&quot; before its 1988 assembly in Harare, Zimbabwe, he said. <P> <B>The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) must make radical changes &quot;or the church will die,&quot;</B> new General Assembly Council chairman Youngil Cho told council members meeting in Louisville, Ky.  He spoke frankly about declines in membership, financial support, and trust, Presbyterian News Service said. The GAC must streamline its operations and make decisions more democratically, &quot;from the boardroom to the assembly line.&quot; The council has been creating programs &quot;without assessing the needs of congregations -- we need to do something for nurturing families and local congregations.&quot; <BR><B>...Cho proposed a radical restructuring of the General Assembly mission efforts:</B>  a reduction of the national staff by two-thirds; elimination of synods; a reduction in the number of General Assembly-level entities; and the transfer of most functions of the GAC to the presbyteries. Nevertheless, Cho insisted the denomination has hope because it is &quot;in the hands of God.&quot; <P> <B>A bomb was thrown into the courtyard of the Ecumenical Patriarch --</B> spiritual leader of  the world's Orthodox Christians -- Sept. 30 in Istanbul, Turkey. It hit the roof of St. George's Cathedral and caused considerable damage to the church and clergy living quarters, but no one was injured  <BR><B>...The attack raised concern about the Patriarch's safety in the predominantly Muslim country</B>. The Patriarchate traces its history to Istanbul's days as the Byzantine capital. Members and clergy are Greek Orthodox and are natives of Turkey. The attack may be linked to tension between Turkey and Greece over the future of Cyprus, Ecumenical News International said. <P> <B>Sunday, Oct. 6, is National Life Chain Sunday</B>. Pro-life advocates in cities across the U.S. will  peacefully assemble and form &quot;human life chains.&quot; For information, call (916) 671-5500. <P> <B>The Confessing Movement within the United Methodist Church,</B> a group that emphasizes doctrinal fidelity and renewal, plans to hire a full-time executive director, United Methodist News Service said. The movement began in 1994 when 102 United Methodists met to discuss what they consider the UMC's &quot;abandonment of the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed in Scripture and asserted in the classic Christian tradition and historic ecumenical creeds.&quot; More than 500 people attended the group's Sept. 27-28 conference in Cincinnati. <P> <B>The radical Taleban militia that has conquered Afghanistan continues to enforce a purist brand of Islam</B> on the people, Reuters news service said. On Tuesday, a broadcast by the Taleban-controlled Kabul Radio quoted a religious official as ordering people to offer Islamic prayers five times a day. Local prayer leaders were asked to bring violators to Taleban offices. &quot;Those who do not perform the prayer in fact are committing a grave sin and those who reject it are infidels,&quot; the announcement said. <BR><B>...The Taleban, which began as a movement of  theology students</B> and now controls three quarters of the country, has many people in fear. Women have been barred from leaving their homes without the Islamic veil and from working in offices. But after an outcry abroad about the denial of women's rights, the Taleban issued a decree promising women laid off from their jobs would be paid their salaries without working. The salaries will be sent to their homes, a Kabul Radio broadcast said<B>.</B> <BR><B>...A Taleban official said 85 &quot;thieves and plunderers&quot; had been caught in three days</B> and were &quot;undergoing legal and Sharia investigation.&quot; Also, 90 cars and 500 weapons have been confiscated, Reuters said. The Taleban has decreed death by stoning for adultery and amputation of hands for theft. <P> <B>In Jerusalem, tourists who came to visit the holy sites have found themselves</B> in the middle of an armed struggle, their tour blocked by Israeli checkpoints, the Associated Press said. Israeli soldiers have stopped many tour buses from entering the city. Last week, Israel opened a new exit to a Jerusalem tunnel that runs near sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims. <BR><B>...Hotels across Israel and the West Bank have had numerous cancellations</B>, news reports said. The Israel Ministry of Tourism is attempting to deal with an estimated $200 million loss in tourist renevue since the tunnel opening, a newspaper said. <BR><B>...Jews observing a religious holiday Tuesday made heavy use of the tunnel</B> to reach their destinations, CNN said. While polls show most Israelis believe their prime minister was wrong to open the tunnel, there was no sign of that opinion among its visitors, the network said. <P> <B>Congress has cracked down on child pornographers</B>.  A new law that took effect Tuesday makes it illegal to use computer technology to depict children in sexual situations -- whether in films, computer images or photographs. Such depictions, which use computer simulations rather than real children, had been outside the scope of federal law. Lawmakers said computer-generated pornography poses many of the same dangers to children as does pornography made from unretouched photographs. <BR><B>...The new law sets mandatory prison sentences of 15 years for production of child pornography</B>, five years for possession of the materials, and life in prison for repeat offenders convicted of sexual abuse of a minor. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the law as unconstitutional, saying  it was so broad that adults portraying children in films could risk prosecution. <P> <B>B'nai B'rith began a campaign against the Southern Baptist Convention's resolution</B> on Jewish evangelism. The Jewish organization, which has members in 56 countries, mailed a fundraising letter to about 100,000 people describing the SBC<B> </B>resolution, which advocates an active program of converting Jews to Christianity, as &quot;condescending and contemptuous. This profoundly disrespectful action  demonstrates a basic lack of respect for Judaism as a sister religion.&quot; <P> <B>Lesbian and gay activists  are protesting a proposal by California Gov. Pete Wilson to restrict adoption</B> to legally married couples, CNN said. Gay-rights supporters say the proposed change to the state's adoption regulations are an attack on the concept of homosexual marriage<B>. </B>Eighteen<B> s</B>tates allow both members of a homosexual couple to adopt a child. Florida and New Hampshire specifically outlaw homosexual adoptions.    </font></p>

</td><td width="470">&nbsp;<BR><table width="450"  align="center" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"><tr><td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 2, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>A 155-foot, $3-million, stainless steel statue of Jesus Christ</B> will be built next spring near Louisville, Ky., <I>USA Today</I> said. The statue, which will reveal no gender or race, will be part of  a $13 million spiritual complex that its owners, the Waverly Hope Foundation, hope will draw 1 million visitors a year. The idea was inspired by the 120-foot statue of Christ in Rio de Janiero, Brazil. <P>   <P> <B>Switzerland is trying to find out if it still holds money that belongs to Jews killed by the Nazis</B>. The Swiss lower house of parliament created a panel of experts to account for Switzerland's financial dealings with the Nazis and determine whether the Swiss have done enough to identify the lost assets of those killed in the Holocaust, Reuters said. Newly declassified U.S. wartime archives increased speculation that Switzerland could still be holding Nazi gold or millions of dollars in assets from people who perished during Hitler's reign of terror. <BR><B>...Some historians say the Swiss were spared a Nazi invasion</B> in part because they provided monetary services to the Nazis. Swiss gold purchases were a crucial source of funds to finance the Nazi war effort. Others see the move as  part of an attempt by London and New York financiers to dull Switzerland's competitive edge as an international financial center. <P> <B>In Britain, Holocaust disbelievers could face prison</B>. The Labour party wants to make denial of the Holocaust a criminal offense punishable by two years in prison, the <I>London Times</I> reported. The party wants to muffle right-wing intellectuals and political campaigners who claim the Holocaust never happened or that Hitler was unaware of its extent. Opponents of  the legislation say such restrictions on freedom of speech would increase racial tensions in Britain and play into the hands of extremists by attracting sympathy for their cause. <P> <B>Burma's military government arrested 500 pro-democracy supporters and warned Buddhist clergy</B> to stay away from others in the movement. The government is worried that the monks, who have supported pro-democracy movements in the past, may do so again. The military kept roads to democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's home in Rangoon closed and prevented the Nobel Peace laureate from convening a pro-democracy meeting, the Associated Press reported. <BR><B>...Many monks were killed in 1988 when the military regime took power</B>. In 1990, monks protested the junta's activities by declining to perform religious rites for members of  the military regime. Dissidents released from a Burmese prison have reported that 200 monks are being held. Troops reportedly have arrested pro-democracy activists staying at monastery guest houses. <P> <B>Amnesty International says rights abuses abound in Turkey</B>. The London-based human rights group issued a report exposing what it called Turkey's failure to prevent torture, extrajudicial killings, and the phenomenon of  suspects &quot;disappearing&quot; in detention. Turkish leaders, judges, and physicians have ignored abuses by Turkey's security forces, Amnesty said.  <BR><B>...Amnesty accused the West of not pushing NATO-member Turkey hard enough on human rights</B>. The West is afraid of upsetting an ally in a troubled region, the report said. <P> <B>British parents are resorting to fraud, blackmail, and financial threats</B> to get their children into church schools, a London television news show said. According to Channel 4's <I>Witness</I>, parents are joining churches, then threatening to withdraw their financial support unless the minister allows their children into the church's school. Some schools have set up a points system, requiring parents to attend services regularly with their children in order to get their child into the school. Parents blame poor education for a decline in moral and spiritual values, and the demand for church schools has increased rapidly, the <I>London Times</I> said. <P> <B>Poland may liberalize its abortion law, ignoring the Roman Catholic Church</B>, the <I>Chicago Tribune</I> reported. The lower house of  Poland's parliament voted  208-61 to legalize abortion for women who live in &quot;difficult living conditions&quot; or where they have other important personal reasons. The upper house of the Sejm will consider the bill this week.  <BR><B>...Under communism, abortion was freely available,</B> but when the church-backed Solidarity movement overthrew the country, Poland's bishops succeeded in getting one of Europe's most restrictive pro-life laws passed. Now reformed communists have returned to power. Pope John Paul II said this development in his native land has caused him great personal anguish, the newspaper reported. Surveys show a majority of Poles favor liberalization of abortion laws. <P> <B>The Norman Vincent Peale Center for Christian Living is a veritable &quot;prayer factory,&quot;</B> the <I>New York Times</I> said. The center, which was founded in New York in 1940 and moved  to Pawling, N.Y., in 1952, has a prayer administrator and 240 Prayer Partners, located on and off the site. They handle 3,000 prayer requests a week. Peale wrote the author of the 1952 inspirational classic <I>The Power of Positive Thinking.</I> <P> <B>D. James Kennedy has started an organization to mobilize conservative Christians.</B> The Center for Reclaiming America will not support specific candidates or political parties, the group said. Founded by the television pastor's Coral Ridge Ministries, the group will track policies, draft legislation, and encourage volunteers to lobby lawmakers. Its constituency will overlap somewhat with the Christian Coalition, but the groups will complement rather than compete with each other, the center said.    </font></p>

</td><td width="470">&nbsp;<BR><table width="450"  align="center" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"><tr><td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 1, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...The 82-count indictment accuses Bennett of bank and mail fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion</B>. It said Bennett persuaded nonprofit groups to give New Era money that would double in six months with matching funds from anonymous donors, news reports said. The donors did not exist, and instead New Era was running a ponzi scheme, using money from new participants to pay off earlier investors, the indictment said. <BR><B>...Much of the money is owed to evangelical Christian groups</B>, colleges, and churches. About 600 investors never received grants and lost about $150 million, including $3.5 million Bennett used to maintain a lavish lifestyle, prosecutors said. Some nonprofit groups received grants from New Era, and most of them have agreed to return the money to help pay creditors who failed to receive the money.  <P> <B>A record number of Canadian women obtained abortions in 1994</B>.  A total of 106,255 abortions were performed in hospitals and  private clinics, a rate of 27.6 abortions for ever 100 live births and an increase of 1.8% from the previous year, according to the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada. Private abortion clinics, legalized in 1988, perform an increasing number of abortions each year as abortions in hospitals remain steady, the EFC said.  <BR><B>...Even though the Supreme Court of Canada has acknowledged</B> that the federal government has an interest in the life of the unborn child,  there is no legal means to exercise this interest, the EFC said. Having no law to protect the unborn &quot;suggests indifference to the value of human life at its most vulnerable stage,&quot; the EFC said. <P> <B>Legalization of physician-assisted suicide in the United States would quickly slide into involuntary euthanasia</B> -- as it has in the Netherlands -- two prominent Christian leaders said. Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and David Stevens, executive director of the Christian Medical &amp; Dental Society, said  physician-assisted suicide would endanger the elderly, poor, depressed, handicapped, and other vulnerable members of society. &quot;Physicians know it is dangerous for them to have the power to help kill patients. That is why it has been prohibited in the medical profession for over 2,000 years,&quot; Stevens said at a press conference hosted by  Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.). Canady presented findings from a new congressional report, <I>Physician-Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in the Netherlands</I>.  <BR><B>...In Holland, strict regulations have failed to keep deaths voluntary</B>, Stevens said. Government reports show that in 1990, 2,300 people were killed by Netherlands doctors in its euthanasia program, including more than 1,000 people without their consent. &quot;Who will know what really went on between the doctor and the patient when the patient is dead?&quot; Stevens said.  <P> <B>A church in Michigan conducts a question-and-answer session</B> during its informal Saturday evening worship service. Rob Bell, pastor at Calvary Church, an independent evangelical congregation in Grand Rapids, takes questions after his sermon. Hand-written questions are collected, and each is anonymous.  Some questions focus on the meaning of passages from the Bible, but most focus on personal matters, such as sexual issues, abuse, and suicide. Bell avoids pat responses, often directs questioners to the Bible for further contemplation of the issue, and sometimes admits he does not know the answer. The session is risky but spiritual seekers consider it authentic, Bell said.  <P> <B>There's nothing very monastic about the monastic life in the United States any more</B>. Economic pressures are forcing modern monks to become workaholics, laboring long hours in secular jobs outside the monastery. This creates stress and consumes too much of the monks' lives, leaving little time for prayer, contemplation, and monastic community activities.           <P> <B>Neighbors Who Care, a national Christian ministry formed to help victims of  crime</B>, has grown since its founding in 1993 to nine chapters across the United States. A subsidiary of  Prison Fellowship, the ministry started by Chuck Colson, Neighbors Who Care provides practical, emotional, and spiritual support. The latest chapter began as a support group for homicide survivors in Memphis, Tenn., formed by Kitty Lawson, associate pastor at Abundant Grace Fellowship. Lawson formed the group after a couple from the church was murdered in their apartment. For information: Neighbors Who Care, P.O. Box 16079, Washington, D.C., 20041; phone: (703) 904-7311.  <P> <B>A translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls for non-scholars</B> is scheduled to be published in November. <I>The Dead Sea Scrolls: A New Translation</I>, contains no momentous revelations about early Christianity, researcher Edward Cook said. <P> <B>Cook and two colleagues pieced fragments together for the translation</B>, transliterated the Aramaic text into modern Hebrew, and translated the Hebrew into English. <P> <B>The scrolls, written by the Essenes, an ascetic Jewish sect</B>, were discovered in 1946 in a cave near the Dead Sea. They are thought to date to the second century before Jesus and to the first century after his death. No scroll directly connects the Essenes with early Christianity, he said. <P> <B>Australia's parliament is facing pressure from religious, political, and community groups</B> to overturn the world's first law legalizing mercy killing.  Australia's outback Northern Territory introduced the world's first voluntary euthanasia law earlier this year. The first person to die under the law was 66 year old Bob Dent, a former carpenter and one-time Christian missionary. Dent was terminally ill with prostate cancer. <BR><B>...However, opinion in the territory is running stronly in favor of the law</B>. Nationwide, opinion polls show strong support, with up to eight in 10 Australians in favor of the law. <P> <B>Nearly half of all pregnancies  in the United States are unintended and nearly a quarter end in abortion,</B> researchers for the Alan Guttmacher Institute said. Speaking at an American Medical Association conference in San Francisco Sept. 30, said that although 98% of American women use contraception during their reproductive years, two-thirds have had an unplanned pregnancy.  <P> <B>Plans are under way to provide World Wide Web home pages to all 19,500 Catholic parishes</B> in the United States. Catholic Online and the Catholic Catalog Company of Bakersfield, Calif., announced a joint venture to set up the pages free of charge, calling it a large but important task. The sites will allow parishes to communicate with their local parishioners as well as with the whole Catholic community, the companies said. A database of all parishes, including a Mass timetable, will allow travelers to type in their destination and receive information about the closest Catholic churches. <P> <B>Busloads of foreign tourists come each Sunday to attend some of the 400 churches in Harlem</B>, N.Y., one of the world's most famous African-American neighborhoods. Tours are given in English, Italian, French, Spanish, German, and Portuguese. They are part of the rejuvenation of Harlem neighborhoods,  some of which are being revived as centers of  business and entertainment for tourists and residents of all races.    </font></p>

Employees are forbidden to discriminate against homosexuals
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The U.S. Postal Service's law enforcement division has issued a code of conduct</B> that forbids its 4,600 inspectors and police officers from discriminating against homosexuals, even during off-duty hours. The new code requires the signature of each employee. <BR> <B>...The code has resulted in private protests from some employees,</B> <I>The Washington Times</I> reported. One employee said he believes homosexuality is a sin and would not sign the code. Another worker said the code could prevent him from opposing a homosexual pastor at his church or speaking out against same-sex unions. <BR> <B>...The anti-discrimination clause states:</B> &quot;Employees acting in an official capacity will not directly or indirectly authorize, permit or participate in discrimination based on age, gender, ethnic origin, physical or mental disability or sexual orientation against anyone, whether or not they are employees. Because we are a law enforcement agency, off-duty conduct that demonstrates an inability to be fair, objective and unbiased in dealings with others will not be tolerated.&quot; The statement does not include the word religion, which is commonly protected in federal non-discrimination policies. Employees in the division investigate crime committed through the mail. <BR> <B>...A postal service spokesman said the policy will only affect actions that break the law</B>, such as refusing to rent to a homosexual in violation of a local law. &quot;Public objections to a homosexual teaching one's child -- that's free speech. We're not violating anybody's free speech.&quot; <BR> <B>...All Cabinet-level departments except the Pentagon</B> now have rules barring  discrimination based on sexual orientation, said Leonard Hirsch, president of Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Employees of the Federal Government. But only the Postal Service policy extends to an employee's off-duty hours, he said. <BR> <B>...The new code will send a message </B>that &quot;people who have deeply held moral beliefs...need not apply for the federal jobs,&quot; Robert Maginnis, an analyst at the Family Research Council, told the <I>Times</I>. &quot;This is reverse discrimination of the worst kind.&quot;    </font></p>

An increasing number of banks are being run by Islamic principles
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A global network of banks and investment houses is taking shape</B> based on financial principles laid down in Islamic teaching. <BR> <B>...Islamic banks charge no interest on loans</B> because the Koran regards that as exploitation: making money without doing work. Instead, commercial borrowers pay the bank a share of their future profits; the bank does not know in advance how much the profit will be, if anything. Mortgage borrowers are charged a flat fee payable in monthly installments; mortgage loans have no compound interest or late-payment charges. <BR> <B>...Islamic banks pay no interest on deposits</B>. Depositors can choose an account that guarantees their money but pays no dividends, or a fund in which they share in the banks' profits and its risks from investments. <BR> <B>...Islamic banks pool their deposits to invest in businesses</B> that do not profit from interest payments and are not linked to liquor, gambling, or other enterprises regarded as sinful. Islamic bankers will not lend money to businesses connected to activities that are considered immoral. Almost every Islamic bank has a committee of religious advisers who audit the bank's accounts. <BR> <B>...Banking by Islamic principles has grown into a competitive multi-billion dollar industry</B>. Islamic bankers are believed to operate 100 banks in 40 countries, with total deposits of $70 billion, according to <A HREF=http://www.speednet.com.au/~nida>Nida'ul magazine. </A> Islamic banks, common in the Middle East, have sprung up in London and the Philippines. Citibank and other major international banks have opened Islamic subsidiaries. Some banks in Malaysia have opened separate teller windows to handle Islamic transactions. <BR> <B>...Islamic banking is &quot;a new phenomenon that has taken many observers by surprise,&quot;</B> according to Mohamed Ariff of the University of Malaya. The whole banking system has been islamized in Iran and Pakistan, and 30 Islamic banks are operating in other parts of the globe, he said.    </font></p>

Convention: Western missionaries have a big task ahead</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The task of Western missionaries is far from complete, </B>according to missions leader George Verwer. The founder of Operation Mobilization will plead the cause of world missions in a speech at the Urbana 96 Student Mission Convention, which starts tonight on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne. <BR> <B>...More than 20,000 students, missionaries, and pastors from 90 countries</B> are attending the five-day convention, held every three years. It is sponsored by InterVarsity Christian Fellowship of the U.S.A. and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship-Canada.  <BR> <B>...Although non-Western missionaries are increasing in number and influence</B>, foreign nationals alone are not a &quot;shortcut toward getting the job done quickly,&quot; Verwer said. The task of evangelizing the world is too massive, and the areas without Christian witness are too numerous to do without either Western or national missionaries, he said. <BR> <B>...Verwer plans to challenge Urbana 96 delegates to work at least one or two years </B>in a different part of the world -- not only for the sake of others, but for their own spiritual development. The responsibility of all Christians to participate in Christ's Great Commission is the convention's major theme.  <BR> <B>...Approximately 300 convention seminars are designed to focus students on specific aspects of mission service</B> or cross-cultural witness. Some 240 exhibiting missionary-sending agencies, as well as 50 seminaries and Christian colleges, will offer information about specific opportunities for service. <BR> <B>...Delegates will hear about the needs of major ethnic people-groups </B>that have little or no opportunity to hear about Christ. They also will learn about needs in urban areas, among children and youth, and in the Islamic world. Other presentations<B> </B>will highlight<B> </B>the challenges of relativism and postmodernism on campuses and discuss competing faiths such as Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Specific tracks are designed for more than 900 church leaders and mission pastors attending. Keynote speakers, in addition to Verwer, include missions leaders from North America, South America, and Africa. <BR> <B>...&quot;The youth at Urbana are typically highly motivated and energetic Christians,&quot;</B> said convention director Dan Harrison. &quot;Xers today are doing some of the finest mission work I've ever seen,&quot; according to Harrison, a missionary for 30 years. A survey of 1993 Urbana delegates showed 90% feel they had something to offer as a missionary in another culture. Many of the delegates said they typically discuss their faith with nonbelievers, and one in four had already been on a missions conference lasting longer than a month. <BR> <B>...Urbana 96 marks the 50th anniversary of InterVarsity's first missions convention</B>, held in Toronto. Christy Wilson, who directed InterVarsity's convention in 1946, will address Urbana 96 delegates, and missionaries from each of Urbana's five decades will give testimonies. <BR> <B>...The <A HREF=http://www.gospelcom.net/iv/urbana>Urbana 96 Internet site</A> will allow people who can't attend</B> Urbana 96 to interact with the conference. The site will include regular updates from the convention on audio and video, and summaries of sessions. Keynote addresses will be aired on the Moody Broadcasting and Skylight Radio Networks.    </font></p>

Priest ministers to his fellow hostages in Peru</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A Catholic priest is celebrating Mass, administering sacraments, and holding prayer meetings </B>inside the besieged Japanese ambassador's home in Lima, Peru. Juan Julio Wicht is respected by Marxist rebels who are holding 104 hostages at the residence, released hostages say. He is allowed to move freely around the two floors of the building. <BR> <B>...Wicht turned down his chance for freedom</B>, choosing not to join the 225 hostages released Sunday night. &quot;I prefer to stay to help the hostages spiritually. I don't have any family,&quot; said Wicht, according to a hostage freed that night. Wicht reportedly insists he will leave only when the last hostages are out. <BR> <B>...Wicht has led prayer sessions every morning.</B> The Jesuit priest, who teaches at Peru's University of the Pacific, also celebrated Sunday Mass on the stairs that join the two floors of the residence, calling for calm in the crisis. Many of the 330-plus hostages at the Mass took Communion.  <BR> <B>...Yoshimoto Taguchi, a Protestant missionary from Japan who was taken hostage</B>, also participated in the liturgy on Sunday by reading a Bible passage in Japanese and speaking about his hope in God. Taguchi, who is supported by Conservative Baptist congregations in Japan, has lived in Peru for 15 years and leads an interdenominational congregation. He was released Monday, Marty Shaw of CBInternational in Japan told <I>Religion News Today</I>. Taguchi's wife, also taken hostage, was released earlier. <BR> <B>...Catholic Bishop Jose Luis Cipriani of Lima was allowed to enter the residence</B> to celebrate Mass, pray with the hostages, and hear confessions. Cipriani, a conservative known for his support of the governmental policies of President Alberto Fujimori, spent six hours inside the ambassador's home. <BR> <B>...The rebels claim to be acting on behalf of Peru's impoverished masses</B>. At least half of Lima's six million inhabitants live in shantytowns that surround the city. Water is scarce, street children and beggars are common, and garbage dumps are raked over for scraps of food. The rebels, members of The Cuban-inspired Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, have issued a statement criticizing free-market reforms instituted by Fujimori. Reforms have pulled the economy out of chaos, but have not significantly improved poverty levels in Peru, where wages are low and unemployment is high, the rebels say.    </font></p>

Christians, Muslims maintain an uneasy peace in Bethlehem
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>In Bethlehem, the town synonymous with Christmas, most residents follow Islam</B>. Israeli troops pulled out of the town's center a year ago to make way for Palestinian self-rule. <BR> <B>...About a third of the 40,000 Arabs who live in the center of the city are Christians, </B>but more leave every year, <I>The London Times</I> reported. Some Muslims also leave, but those who remain have a higher birth rate than the Christians. Churches have dwindled to 20 in number, but there are 70 mosques. <BR> <B>...A mosque in Manger Square directly faces the Church of the Nativity</B>, the traditional birthplace of Jesus. Each Friday, Muslims prostrate themselves there, pledging allegiance to Allah. Traffic halts as clerics deliver their message over loudspeakers. <BR> <B>...A few of the speeches are aimed directly at Christians</B>. Last month, a Muslim cleric, angered by the visit of Christian fundamentalists from the United States, spoke out in a rare diatribe against Christians. The Palestinian Authority silenced him immediately, and no violence occurred. <BR> <B>...Peace and harmony are necessary for Bethlehem's tourist trade. </B>But the possibility of  terrorist attacks have scared away some tourists this year from visiting the town's extensive Christmas celebrations. Jalal Qumsiya, who owns the Paradise Hotel, told UPI that his business is down 30% compared with 1995. Few merchants say they expect the boom in tourism first imaged when Arabs and Israelis signed their 1993 peace accord. But Qumsiya, a Christian, still hopes for peace. &quot;I believe in miracles. It's the Holy Land and God won't forget us.&quot; <BR> ------- <BR> <B>Editor's Note</B>: Merry Christmas to all our readers from the staff at <I>Religion News Today</I>.    </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <H3>Hollywood's new TV rating system criticized</H3>  <BR> <B>Television's new age-based rating system gets a thumbs-down, critics say</B>. Parents want to know each show's level of sex, violence, and foul language -- not be given a general, age-based rating by the entertainment industry. The new system was unveiled Thursday by Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America.  <BR> <B>...The new system offers &quot;no help&quot; to parents who want to know &quot;exactly how bad a program is,&quot;</B> according to the Traditional Values Coalition, a Christian group. The Anaheim, Calif., coalition and other organizations have said they want a content-based rating system. <BR> <B>...Under the new system, at least a dozen television shows will be rated unsuitable for children</B> 14 and under. Shows rated TV-14, or unsuitable for those 14, include: <I>Married...with Children, The X-Files, NYPD Blue, Saturday Night Live, Melrose Place, Profiler</I>, some episodes of <I>Homicide</I> and <I>Walker, Texas Ranger, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Conan O'Brien</I>, some <I>David Letterman</I> shows, and many episodes of daytime soap operas such as <I>General Hospital</I> and <I>All My Children</I>. News shows are exempt from the ratings. <BR> <B>...Here is a listing of the new program ratings, </B>which will begin popping up on the top left corner of television screens in January: <BR> <B>TV-Y</B> -- Appropriate for all children. Themes designed for a very young audience. <Br> <B>TV-Y7</B> -- May be more appropriate for children 7 and older who can distinguish between make-believe and reality. <BR> <B>TV-G</B> -- General audience. Little or no violence. <BR> <B>TV-PG</B> -- Parental guidance suggested. May contain material unsuitable for  younger children <BR> <B>TV-14</B> -- May be unsuitable for children under 14.  <BR> <B>TV-M</B> -- For mature audience only. <BR> <B>...Each show's rating is decided by producers, networks, cable channels, and syndicators</B>. The ratings will work with the V-chip, a device installed in televisions to lock out violent shows. V-chips will appear in new television sets in mid-1998, as required by federal law. Parents then will be able to block shows by rating. <BR> <B>...&quot;Where are the parents in all this decision-making?&quot;</B> asked Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union. Instead of the new system, the ACLU advocates creation of &quot;independent private ratings systems&quot; developed by organizations such as &quot;the PTA, the Christian Coalition, the Boy Scouts, or even <I>TV Guide</I>.&quot; Steinhardt described Hollywood's rating system as &quot;government-coerced&quot; censorship since the Federal Communications Commission has veto power over any proposed plan. &quot;Does America really want Big Brother sitting on the family couch hogging the remote control?&quot; <BR> <B>...Hollywood should &quot;quit hiding behind this phony ratings ploy</B> and pledge to clean up&quot; its act, said Gary Bauer, president of Family Research Council, a Christian policy group. &quot;Be the good citizens that you want parents to believe you are -- stop the trash, don't just rate it,&quot; he said. <BR> <B>...Critics say their protests have been ignored, but they aren't beaten yet</B>. Several of the groups will ask the Federal Communications Commission to reject the code.    </font></p>

Winter solstice celebrations growing more popular</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Celebration of the ancient festival of winter solstice is overshadowing Christmas </B>for a growing number of people. The celebration is based on pagan traditions that pre-date the Christmas holiday. <BR> <B>...The solstice is the shortest daylight time of the year.</B> It occurs each Dec. 21 or Dec. 22 when the northern hemisphere is tilted farthest from the sun. This year, the solstice occurs at 9:05 a.m. Eastern Time on Dec. 21. After the winter solstice, the amount of sunlight increases about one minute a day until the spring equinox. <BR> <B>...In the United States, the fastest growing public solstice observance has been Revels, </B>a celebration of traditional dance, carols, processionals, and plays. Revels started in Cambridge, Mass., 25 years ago and has spread to nine other cities. <BR> <B>...A Winter Solstice Celebration has been held for 17 years </B>at St. John the Divine Cathedral in New York City. Every year, musician Paul Winter hosts the celebration for  an audience of 11,000 people. The show has been carried live on National Public Radio for the last seven years. This year's show, on Dec. 12-14, featured 10 Russian folk singers and dancers, 18 African-American percussionists, and the Forces of Nature Dance Theatre Company. The return of the sun was represented by a seven-foot gong played by a musician as it ascended toward the cathedral's 100-foot-high ceiling. Tickets for the event were $28 to $60. <BR> <B>...Other people celebrate quietly at home or at small parties, </B>seeking a contrast to the commercialism and consumerism of the season. Last year, a Miami couple issued an invitation over the Internet to a winter solstice party at their house. &quot;We'll provide the drinks. Bring food, candles, poetry, love, and hope,&quot; it said. In Madison, Wisc., the fire department issued a Winter Solstice Bonfires announcement, reminding residents that no open fires, except cooking fires, are allowed without a permit. A few residents ask for bonfire permits each month to celebrate the full moon, fire chief Ed Ruckreagle told <I>Religion News Today</I>. <BR> <B>...Highlands Camp and Conference Center in North Carolina</B> advertises its winter solstice get-away weekend as &quot;not for pagans only.&quot; If the &quot;hustle and commercialization of the holiday season have gotten you down, try something different,&quot; the center says. The weekend includes workshops led by members of the Covenant of Unitarian-Universalist Pagans. Topics are earth-centered worship, the feminine divine, the spirituality of drumming, Wiccan circles, and designing spells and charms. An &quot;elaborate ritual&quot; is held around a fire-pit. <BR> <B>...Others create their own contemporary ceremonies</B>. In St. Paul, Minn., Women in Wilderness, an outdoor adventure company, holds winter solstice dog sled trips during the day. At night, the women set up a campfire and talk about the changes of the seasons. &quot;We do a traditional Christmas, with the tree and presents and everything,&quot; Julia Hagedorn of Denver told <I>USA Today</I>. &quot;But solstice has become my favorite night of the whole season. It seems to transcend the 20th century, and I feel very tied to the ancient traditions.&quot; <BR>        </font></p>

New book documents missionary heroes</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Twelve American Protestant missionaries risked their lives to rescue thousands of innocent Chinese</B> citizens during the winter of 1937, when the invading Japanese army overran the Nationalist Chinese capital of Nanjing, recently discovered and publicized documents show. <BR> <B>...The missionaries, along with four German citizens and several Russians,</B> established a safety zone for 200,000 Chinese while Japanese soldiers carried out a two-month rampage of looting, rape, and killing that left tens of thousands dead. The Japanese army killed 300,000 Chinese and raped 80,000 women in the city, according to the forthcoming book <I>American Missionary Witness to the Nanjing Massacre</I>. It contains eyewitness accounts from diaries left by nine of the missionaries, providing &quot;massive, irrevocable testimonies&quot; of the events. The facts also have been corroborated by numerous Chinese victims, the book says. <BR> <B>...Yet Japan has consistently denied that the massacre occurred. </B>As recently as last week, a Japanese government official was quoted in a <I>New York Times</I> advertisement disputing the atrocities. Some former Japanese Imperial Army soldiers, Japanese Embassy personnel, and scores of Japanese journalists living today saw the massacre but have refused to talk about it, <I>American Missionary Witness </I>says<I>.</I> <BR> <B>...The massacre is &quot;one of the greatest horrors in the annals of mankind&quot;</B> and has come to be known as the Rape of Nanjing, the book says. The manner in which the victims died was extremely cruel, including beheading, bayoneting, burying alive, burning, and gang-raping, according to the book.<B> </B>The missionaries whose accounts are reprinted in the book include: Miner Searle Bates, John G. Magee, George A. Fitch, Lewis S.C. Smythe, W. Plumer Mills, Robert O. Wilson, Ernest H. Forster, James H. McCallum, and Minnie Vautrin. Their diaries are housed in the Yale Divinity School Library. <BR> <B>...When Nanjing fell, 27 Westerners remained in the city, </B>according to the accounts. Fifteen of them were Americans, including the missionaries, who were from Episcopal, Disciples of Christ, Presbyterian, and Methodist denominations. The Americans chose to stay against the advice of the U.S. Embassy. <BR> <B>...Shortly before the city's capture, the Westerners set up an area of sanctuary</B> they called the International Committee for the Nanjing Safety Zone. It became the only place in Nanjing offering any refuge from the slaughter. Some 200,000 people crowded into the zone, an area about one-eighth the size of the city. During the massacre, which lasted from December 1937 to February 1938, &quot;these few foreigners were the true protectors of the desperate Chinese,&quot; the book says. <BR> <B>...The recently discovered 1,200-page diary of John Rabe, </B>one of the<B> </B>German citizens and a Nazi loyalist, provides his account of the atrocities. Rabe describes digging foxholes in his backyard to shelter 650 Chinese, and repelling Japanese troops who tried to climb over the wall. He also tells of running through the city delivering food and stopping Japanese soldiers from raping Chinese women. His humanitarian actions have been compared to those of Oskar Schindler, the German industrialist who protected Jews. <BR> <B>...Although press attention has focused on Rabe and his diary, </B>the missionaries were just as involved in the heroism, according to Martha Smalley, curator of the Day Missions Collection at the Yale Divinity School Library, which holds the missionary diaries. The missionaries were in &quot;tremendous danger&quot; as they tried to prevent people from getting killed or raped and provided food for the refugees, Smalley told <I>Religion News Today</I>.  <BR> <B>...The Westerners stayed in the sanctuary zone</B> <B>with the refugees, </B>sometimes shouting down Japanese soldiers about to rape women and reporting various incidents to the Japanese Embassy. &quot;It is almost impossible to write what has happened, but I never dreamed that such human beasts existed as we have had to deal with,&quot; Episcopal missionary Forster wrote in a letter to his wife. The soldiers took Chinese men away in droves, executed them, then &quot;looted and raped to their heart's content,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I usually spend the day taking women and wounded civilians to the hospital&quot; and guarding the two residences where &quot;most of our Christians and many others, particularly girls, are taking refuge. Our presence there helps to keep soldiers out.&quot;  <BR> <B>...&quot;I came as near to being shot as I ever hope to be,&quot;</B> wrote Robert Wilson, a Methodist medical doctor at the University of Nanjing Hospital. When he learned a Japanese solder was inside the girls' dormitory at the hospital, &quot;I barged in and ordered him out in no uncertain terms.&quot; The soldier menacingly loaded several cartridges into his rifle, but did not fire.    </font></p>

Many use the Bible to learn how to read</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Teaching illiterate people to read by using the Bible</B> has transformed the lives of tens of thousands of individuals. In 20 years, 50,000 tutors have been trained to use a method developed by American linguist William Kofmehl. Those tutors are spread out in 25 countries throughout North America, Africa, Asia, and Latin America; half are in Haiti, and 10,000 in the southeast African nation of Malawi. <BR> <B>...Kofmehl, a 53-year-old Lutheran layman, </B>has studied at schools in the United States, England, and Denmark as well as with Wycliffe Bible Translators. He runs Christian Literacy Associates, working from office space donated by St. John's Lutheran Church in West View, Pa., near Pittsburgh. Kofmehl has worked in relative anonymity at the facility since 1975, when he and his wife, Linda, used a $250 grant from the local Lutheran Synod to start the Allegheny County Literacy Council, which evolved into Christian Literacy Associates.  <BR> <B>...Adults and children can learn to read from Kofmehl's method. </B>It has been particularly effective with first and second graders who are &quot;about to fail&quot; because of their inability to read, he said. Because of the program's religious content, it can't be used by public schools, although it can be used to train parents or church members as tutors.  <BR> <B>...Tutors working with children &quot;can make a tremendous difference</B> in a relatively short time,&quot; Kofmehl told <I>Religion News Today</I>. Some children suffer from learning disabilities, but most who fail to read merely lack individual attention in the classroom and at home, he said. <BR> <B>...About half the world is illiterate.</B> That statistic includes 35 million Americans who read at less than a fifth-grade level, meaning they can't understand a newspaper, directions, or fill out a job application. &quot;The Bible is locked away from their use,&quot; Kofmehl said. Such people are scattered over cities, rural areas, and even suburbs. &quot;Any church that has kids is bound to have several who are going to fail if they don't get individual help in reading,&quot; he said.  <BR> <B>...Many adults who are illiterate live in fear that someone will find out</B>. Some are entrepreneurs who work with their hands but can't manage other parts of their business. A substantial number of  prisoners are illiterate; when they are released they will have two strikes against them -- illiteracy and a prison record -- unless someone teaches them to read. <BR> <B>...Literacy tutoring using the Bible serves a dual purpose: </B>helping people improve their social situations while evangelizing them. &quot;It's nice to take care of two things at the same time,&quot; Kofmehl said. Tutoring opportunities are available to Christians who may never have been involved in an outreach, he said. They can teach someone in their family, a person who is mentally handicapped, or a prisoner. <BR> <B>...Christian Literacy materials are used as resources </B>by a variety of ministries in numerous denominations. They are available in a textbook and on compact disc. There is also an advanced teacher's handbook, a game book for young children, and Bible stories using 40 of the most commonly used words. A four-hour workshop on videotape  trains viewers in the basic tutoring method. For information, contact <A HREF= http://lightp.bevd.blacksburg.va.us >Project Light</A> on the Internet or by Email at light@infi.net. The Virginia Beach-based Project Light develops software to help Christians teach people to read the Bible in their own language and to teach English as a Second Language. Kofmehl can be contacted by Email at drliteracy@aol.com.    </font></p>

School Bible clubs can require some officers to be Christians
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>High school Bible clubs can require their policy-making officers be Christians, </B>the U.S. Supreme Court ruled today. But the court also held that some club officers do not have to be Christians. <BR> <B>...The case started in 1993, when Emily Hsu and her brother Timothy</B>, students at Roslyn High School on Long Island, N.Y., tried to start an after-school Bible study on school grounds. The Roslyn Free School District approved the club, but rejected its proposed constitution, which required all club officers to be Christians. School officials told the Hsus that would violate the district's requirement that clubs be open to all students regardless of their religious beliefs. <BR> <B>...The Hsus sued, claiming their religious freedom was being violated</B>. A federal judge ruled for the school district. But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, ordering the school district to exempt the Bible club from its policy. The appeals court said the requirement of Christian officers is a form of free expression intended &quot;to guarantee that meetings include the desired worship and observance.&quot; The court noted that the officers had to be Christians because part of their duties was leading the club in prayer. <BR> <B>...The case sends a signal to schools that government should stay out</B> of the business of  religious organizations, according to the American Center for Law and Justice, which filed the 1994 suit on behalf of the Hsus.   <BR> <B>...But the ruling may be a mixture of good and bad news, </B>according to Steven McFarland of the Annandale, Va.-based Center for Law and Religious Freedom. McFarland noted that the court ruled only that the club's president, vice-president, and music coordinator must be Christians, but made no similar requirement for its activity coordinator and secretary. <BR> <B>...Thus, the court substituted its judgment for the judgment of the students</B> in deciding which positions needed to be filled by Christians, McFarland said. &quot;Students should decide what positions are essential to the furtherance of their mission or message,&quot; McFarland told <I>Religion News Today</I>. Allowing school administrators or judges to draw those distinctions is &quot;a big mistake,&quot; he said.   <BR> <B>...The case is a &quot;silly compromise&quot; between free speech </B>and &quot;some alleged school interest in diversity,&quot; McFarland said. &quot;Now there's a little hole in the dam. I'm hoping it doesn't get any bigger.&quot;    </font></p>

Chaplains are ministering in the workplace </H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>An increasing number of businesses are employing chaplains</B> to help workers with their personal problems. Nearly all of the chaplains, who work in an estimated 4,000 companies in the United States, are ordained Christian ministers. <BR> <B>...Workplace chaplains get to know employees as they chat during coffee breaks. </B>Employees then may want to meet with the chaplain privately in the chaplain's office outside company property. There the employee can more freely discuss anxieties about family matters, drugs, workplace tensions, and fears. The chaplains also make hospital visits and sympathy calls on dying retirees, and sometimes get involved in mediation of workplace disputes.  <BR> <B>...&quot;There's a great need for soul-care in the workplace,&quot; </B>Gil Stricklin, who founded the Marketplace Ministries in 1984, told <I>Religion News Today</I>. The nonprofit ministry, based in Dallas, sends out 325 chaplains, all of whom are Protestant evangelicals from 28 denominations. <BR> <B>...The workplace is one of the most deadly places in the country</B>, Stricklin said. Last year, 700 people were murdered on the job, many when a former employee returned to kill a supervisor.  <BR> <B>...Half of the workers in the United States don't have a pastor, </B>and many of those who do, don't want to confide in him, Stricklin said. For church-goers involved in moral problems, &quot;usually<B> </B>the last person they want to know about it is the pastor.&quot; Chaplains employed by Marketplace Ministries introduce about 170 people a month to Christ, Stricklin said. <BR> <B>...Chaplaincy is most common in offices such as banks and car dealerships,</B> where stress is high, Stricklin said. Manufacturers also employ chaplains. The United Auto Workers has five full-time ministers and 300 volunteers at GM, Ford, and Chrysler plants.  <BR> <B>...Last fall, Dallas Theological Seminary, </B>which trains ministers for Protestant denominations, began the nation's first major accredited Master's degree program for workplace chaplains. Still, the need far outstrips the number of available chaplains, said Stricklin, whose organization has doubled in size in the last three years. &quot;There's a lot of pain, hurt, and sadness out there.&quot;    </font></p>

Home schooling movement still growing, but faces opposition
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Home schooling has made several legal strides over the past decade.</B> It has become lawful in all 50 states to teach children at home rather than in a formal school. And last summer, Michigan became the last state to concede that parents have a right to teach their children without state certification. <BR> <B>...But the movement continues to face strong opposition</B> from some school officials and the National Education Association. In a number of states, the 2.2 million-member teachers' union has supported legislation that increases regulations on home schooling. The NEA has stuck by its 1988 resolution, which says home schooling &quot;cannot provide the student with a comprehensive education experience.&quot; The 900,000-member American Federation of Teachers has not commented on the subject.  <BR> <B>...Clashes between home-schooling parents and government school agents are increasing in some areas</B>, according to the Home School Legal Defense Association, a Virginia-based advocacy group. Since home schooling is legal, the battle now is for the right to be free from certain regulations<B>,</B> according to HSLDA attorney Christopher Klicka. HSLDA spends much of its time &quot;keeping social workers out&quot; of the residences of home schoolers, he told <I>The Washington Times</I>. <BR> <B>...Other public school systems are more tolerant of home schooling</B>, and are giving home-schooled children access to public school facilities and activities. Some Christian schools also offer home schoolers access. In addition, home schooling families often network with each other or get together for special classes and organized sports. <BR> <B>...The number of children being taught at home continues to increase.</B> The HSLDA estimates that home schooling has grown 25% annually for the last several years and now includes between 900,000 and 1.2 million children. The U.S. Department of Education cites the number at 600,000, but acknowledges that is probably a low estimate. Observers say it is impossible to know the exact number since few records are kept and many home-schooling families don't report to local school districts. <BR> <B>...Many more families have begun home schooling for non-religious reasons in recent years</B>. In a Florida State Department of Education survey of home schoolers last year, 61% cited dissatisfaction with the public schools' environment and instruction as their reason for home schooling. About 21% cited religious reasons.  <BR> <B>...Most colleges accept home-schooled students without a transcript, </B>a change from a decade ago. U.S. Department of Education researcher Patricia Lines said she found no college last year that rejected a student because of lack of a transcript, <I>The Washington Times</I> reported.     </font></p>

Charities wish they had been warned by ECFA about New Era
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Evangelical groups are asking questions about their financial watchdog, </B>the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability. The ECFA scrutinizes the policies of more than 800 member charities. Its purpose has been questioned since the 1995 collapse of the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy, which resulted in hundreds of charities losing millions of dollars. <BR> <B>...Some charities say they are disappointed that the ECFA didn't warn its members</B> to steer clear of New Era. They also wonder whether the council is equipped to protect its members from similar scams in the future.  <BR> <B>...&quot;We are all disappointed that the ECFA didn't take the big-picture look </B>with New Era and ask the questions earlier,&quot; said Hanz Finzel, executive director of CBInternational, an organization based in Wheaton, Ill., that supports Baptist missionaries around the world. Because of the large size of the New Era operation and the many ECFA members involved, &quot;they should have looked into it,&quot; he told <I>The Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>. <BR> <B>...The ECFA decided it was beyond its mission to warn members about New Era</B>, according to Rollin A. Van Broekhoven, a federal judge who chairs the ECFA's board of directors. &quot;We had no jurisdiction with New Era to go in and see if what they were saying was real,&quot; he told <I>The Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>. ECFA president Paul D. Nelson said his organization cannot advise its members how to invest their money, a decision that belongs to the board of directors of each group. <BR> <B>...If the ECFA had been &quot;perceptive enough to know&quot;</B> that a scandal was brewing, it certainly would have warned its members,  Nelson told <I>Religion News Today</I>. Nelson said the ECFA made some telephone calls about New Era and &quot;ran into the same thing everybody else did&quot; -- comments that the group was &quot;the most wonderful thing that ever happened.&quot; Nelson said he did &quot;caution a few organizations who asked about it,&quot; advising them to make their own decisions about possible involvement with New Era. Investigators say New Era was a pyramid scheme in which earlier donors were paid by the deposits of later donors. <BR> <B>...The structure of ECFA could limit its effectiveness, some say. </B>The ECFA lacks legal authority to enforce its rules governing financial disclosure, the makeup of a charity's board, and fund-raising appeals. But the group says it does not hesitate to crack down on members who break the rules.<I> The Chronicle of Philanthropy</I> reported that 23 groups have been expelled or dropped out of the council in each of the last five years because they have not kept up with the council's standards. <BR> <B>...Robert C. Andringa, President of the Coalition for Christian Colleges and Universities</B>, said he'd like to see the ECFA's oversight function not be &quot;paid for by member dues.&quot; Membership in the Herndon, Va.-based ECFA, which costs up to $6,400 a year, depending on the organization's size, allows groups to display the ECFA logo on their fund-raising appeals. Finzel said CBInternational joined the ECFA last year because he believed that doing so would help attract donations. <BR> <B>...The ECFA has been praised for its role in the settlement of lawsuits related to New Era. </B>The group organized United Response, an association of religious groups that were involved with New Era. United Response has facilitated an agreement between charities that made money in the fund-raising plan and those that lost out in the deal. The agreement, which could be finalized next year, will allow New Era creditors to get as much as 85% of their money back, Nelson said. <BR> <B>...&quot;The question is whether the ECFA should change its mission statement&quot;</B> to become involved in things that &quot;don't directly relate to our standards,&quot; Van Broekhoven said. The board of directors will discuss the issue next year, Nelson said.    </font></p>

Promise Keepers will hold a conference in Hawaii</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The 1997 Promise Keepers conferences will begin Jan. 10-11 at the Blaisdell Center in Honolulu, Hawaii,</B> the men's ministry announced. PK plans 22 conferences at most in 1997; dates and locations are to be announced early next year.  <BR> <B>...Promise Keepers drew 1.1 million men to 22 stadium conferences this year.</B> Themes of the rallies have included personal piety, family responsibility, racial reconciliation, and Christian unity. <BR> <B>...Promise Keepers plans to invite hundreds of thousands of men to Washington, D.C., next fall </B>for a massive prayer meeting on the Mall. The date of the event is still being finalized. The gathering, called &quot;Stand in the Gap,&quot; will simply be a meeting of  &quot;men coming to pray for their country, to intercede as prayer warriors,&quot; according to PK spokesperson Laura Swickard. PK organizers said they hope the image of a million men on their knees on the Mall would foster a spiritual awakening across the country. <BR> <B>...&quot;It's not a Million Man March,&quot; </B>Swickard said, referring to the gathering of hundreds of thousands of blacks on the Mall Oct. 16, 1995, in an event led by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. A <I>Washington Post</I> survey of  more than a thousand of those marchers found that 57% said they were Christian. <BR> <B>...Promise Keepers has grown at a tremendous pace </B>in the six years since it was founded by Bill McCartney, then the head football coach at the University of Colorado. It has a full-time staff of 430 at its headquarters in Boulder, Colo., and an annual budget of $97 million, <I>The Washington Post</I> reported. Sixty percent of the budget comes from the men who pay $60 apiece to attend the stadium events, and the rest comes from donations and sales of PK-related materials. <BR> <B>...The group produces videos, a radio show</B>, and a <A HREF=http://www.promisekeepers.org/>Web site,</A> and publishes books and newsletters. PK also has 38 state offices and a handful of international affiliates. A conference for clergy, held in Atlanta this February, may be duplicated, but will probably not become an annual event, Swickard said.    </font></p>

Some Christmas shoppers reject materialism, give gifts to the poor</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>People concerned about the excessive materialism of the Christmas season are changing the way they shop. </B>Rather than giving the usual holiday gifts, some are donating money to medical relief for Rwandan orphans, dental exams for Cambodian children, goats for families in Mozambique, a night's shelter for a homeless person in the United States, or a host of other special causes. The gifts are purchased in the name of family or friends, who receive a card, ornament, or photograph and a description of the project being funded in their honor.  <BR> <B>...Alternative Gifts International, an interfaith, ecumenical agency, offers shares</B> in 24 programs and products that benefit the needy or help the environment. The program started in 1980 when Harriet Prichard, president and founder, held a small gift market at Pasadena Presbyterian Church, where she worked. Last year, churches, schools, and community groups held 239 such alternative gift markets in 36 states, helping support 18 nonprofit agencies. The phone number is 800-842-2243.  <BR> <B>...&quot;We help people give authentic, life-giving gifts rather than commercial gifts,&quot; </B>Prichard told <I>Religion News Today</I>. &quot;In this day and age when Americans are the most privileged people on earth, it is time for them to see the value of giving themselves away to the world,&quot; she said. <BR> <B>...World Concern, a nonprofit Christian relief organization</B>, has produced a <A HREF="http://www.worldconcern.org/giftcat.html-ssi">Global Gift Guide</a> for the past three years. The catalogue includes prenatal checkups for women in Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Myanmar ($15), midwife kits for women in Cambodia and Uganda ($160), hot lunches for 50 preschool children in Ethiopia ($28.50), or two weeks of Bible camp for a Ukrainian orphan ($70). <BR> <B>...Christians say they want to spread peace on earth and goodwill toward men</B>, but &quot;those kinds of gifts aren't found in a shopping mall,&quot; said Christy Gardner, World Concern's communications director. Gifts to non-Christians lead to questions about the giver's values, creating opportunities for witnessing, Gardner told <I>Religion News Today</I>. World Concern's phone number is 800-755-5022. <BR> <B>...<A HREF="http://www.mlab.com/ads/habit01.stm">Habitat for Humanity</A> has an Extraordinary Gifts program</B> that increased 40% between 1993 and 1995, the group said. The program allows individuals to contribute to construction of homes for low-income individuals. It produced 9,084 gifts totaling $652,000 last year. Their phone number is 800-HABITAT, ext. 251. Heifer Project International, a nondenominational group, also offers a program of alternative gifts. They are at P.O. Box 808 in Little Rock, Ark., 72203. The phone number is (501) 376-6836.    </font></p>

Christian college student wins lawsuit, refuses to subsidize
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A Christian college student who objected to his activity fee being used for liberal student clubs</B> has won a lawsuit against the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Scott Southworth and two other students at the University of Wisconsin Law School sued in federal court last spring. They object to the $6.50 per semester fee, which every student must pay, being used to subsidize groups whose political and ideological activities they do not like. On Nov. 29, District Court Judge John Shabaz ruled in favor of the students, saying the school's mandatory fee system is unconstitutional.  <BR> <B>...The decision potentially affects colleges across the country,</B> many of which have similar fee systems. Shabaz ruled that UW-Madison violated the students' First Amendment rights. In effect, he said, the fee forced the students to become involved in certain speech and association. The university's Board of Regents is expected to appeal the ruling. If the decision is finally upheld, fees already collected by the clubs may have to be refunded. <BR> <B>...Southworth said he particularly objects to four campus groups.</B> He cited the politically oriented Wisconsin Public Interest Group, which received $50,954 in student funding during the 1996-1997 school year, according to the<I> Badger Herald</I>, a campus newspaper. Also cited were the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Campus Center, which received $27,300; the Campus Women's Center (an abortion-rights group), which received $35,281; and the environmental policy group UW Greens, which received $7,100. <BR> <B>...&quot;It's a victory for the First Amendment and it's a victory for students</B> regardless of their political or ideological views,&quot; Southworth said. &quot;No students should have to pay for the political or ideological activities of any group on campus, no matter what they believe.&quot; His attorney, Jordan Lorence of Fairfax, Va., told the<I> Badger Herald</I> that the fee system has flagrantly violated First Amendment rights. &quot;I'm not surprised the judge's decision was so strong.&quot;   <BR> <B>...Many University of Wisconsin students and faculty strongly objected to the decision</B>. UW political scientist Donald Downs acknowledged that violations of a university no-politics rule have occurred, but said that doesn't mean the whole system should be discarded. Student groups that merely promulgate controversial ideas are not unconstitutional, he said. If that were the case, students who object to a professor's classroom comments could demand to be reimbursed for a portion of the professor's salary, he said. Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-Madison) likened the student fee to income taxes. &quot;There are often places where those tax dollars go that we object to. And yet, opting out is not available for taxpayers. It urges people to participate in the democracy that allocates it,&quot; she said. <BR> <B>...The mandatory fee system nationwide puts &quot;millions of dollars into the hands of radicals,&quot;</B> according to Alan Sears, president of Alliance Defense Fund. The Christian legal group, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., helped fund Southworth's case. &quot;If we prevail, they will have to get their hands out of the wallets of students of faith and their families and either raise their money voluntarily like the rest of us or go out of business,&quot; Sears said. <BR> <B>...&quot;This issue is going to come up again because we are going to make it come up,&quot;</B> ADF attorney Scott Phillips told <I>Religion News Today</I>. A student at the University of Minnesota intends to file a lawsuit similar to Southworth's, Phillips said. The point these lawsuits is not to &quot;make these groups suffer, but to make them stand on their own,&quot; Phillips said. A definitive ruling for Southworth, particularly if it comes in the U.S. Supreme Court, would &quot;de-fund the forced speech of the left&quot; on college campuses, Phillips said.    </font></p>

Judge allows homosexual marriages in Hawaii</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Homosexual and lesbian marriages are legal, a state judge in Hawaii ruled on Tuesday</B>. Circuit Court judge Kevin S.C. Chang ordered the state to end a ban against giving marriage licenses to same-sex couples, marking the first time a U.S. court has ruled that such couples have the same right to marry as heterosexual couples. <BR> <B>...Courtroom maneuvering makes it unclear when the first same-sex marriage would take place in Hawaii,</B> and homosexual advocacy groups advised would-be spouses against hopping on planes and heading for Waikiki. Hawaii Deputy Attorney General Rick Eichor said he would file for a stay of  Chang's order. The court is expected to let the ban remain in effect during the state's appeal to the Hawaii Supreme Court. In 1993, the court ruled that the ban on same-sex marriages violates the state constitution's prohibition against gender discrimination. The Hawaii Supreme Court sent the case back to a lower court to give the state a chance to justify the ban against same-sex marriages. If the court rules as it did in 1993, the legal battle in Hawaii would be over and the marriage licenses would be granted. <BR> <B>...The legal struggle on the mainland is only beginning</B>. The prospect of would-be gay spouses flocking to Hawaii to wed prompted so much opposition this fall that Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal recognition of homosexual marriages and permits states not to recognize such marriages licensed in other states. President Clinton signed the election-season bill, though his spokesman denounced it as &quot;gay-baiting.&quot; Sixteen states have passed their own version of the ban on same-sex marriages, and 20 states have defeated such bills.  <BR> <B>...There are likely to be major disputes in federal courts</B> over whether the states are bound by the U.S. Constitution's &quot;full faith and credit&quot; clause to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. A court-by-court-battle on that issue could take years.  <BR> <B>...The ruling &quot;basically redefines marriage,&quot; </B>said Deputy Attorney General Eichor, who argued the case for the state of Hawaii. Eichor said legalizing same-sex marriages would open the door to demands that bigamy, polygamy, and consensual incestuous relationships be licensed as well. Judge Chang's ruling cited expert testimony that homosexual and lesbian couples can be good parents and rejected the state's argument that children thrive best when raised by heterosexual parents. <BR> <B>...Opponents of same-sex marriages promised a fight.</B> With society in &quot;a moral crisis...this is hardly the time to be tinkering with the definition of marriage,&quot; said Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition. The American Center for Law and Justice, which represented eight state legislators who unsuccessfully sought to intervene in the case, called the ruling an &quot;outrage.&quot; ACLJ attorney Jay Sekulow said marriage as a legal union between man and woman &quot;has served all cultures well. There is no legal or moral reason to change it.&quot; <BR> <B>...Chang's ruling has &quot;ushered in a new era of lawlessness,&quot;</B> said Robert Knight of the Washington-based Family Research Council. He denounced the ruling as a denial of  &quot;not only the wisdom of generations but the law of nature and nature's God. No law that contradicts the fundamental moral law is legitimate. This means that the court has now acted lawlessly, and the people of Hawaii, who have spoken repeatedly and clearly about this issue, would be well justified in seeking Judge Chang's removal from the bench.&quot; According to recent surveys, 70%-75% of Hawaiians oppose same-sex marriages. <BR> <B>...&quot;It's time for Americans to examine and to exercise ways to nullify the actions of judges</B> who flout the law. This is no small legal matter, but an assault on morality and the rule of law itself,&quot; Knight said. He also said that the Hawaii attorney general's office &quot;deliberately under-argued the case&quot; by concentrating on the harm to children and ignoring evidence that homosexuality is &quot;destructive to individuals, families, and society and that homosexuality is a changeable condition.&quot; <BR> <B>...Chang's ruling was &quot;judicial tyranny,&quot; said Lou Sheldon</B>, chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition in Anaheim, Calif. &quot;We are now entering an age of moral anarchy,&quot; said Pierre Bynum, editor <I>of Capitol Hill Prayer Alert</I>, a Washington, D.C.- based Christian ministry. <BR> <B>...The ruling could be a blessing in disguise since it will stir up &quot;even more anger, frustration</B>, and bitterness in the community toward the courts and elected officials,&quot; said Mike Gabbard, chairman of the Alliance for Traditional Marriage-PAC in Hawaii. The Hawaii Legislature will consider a constitutional amendment next year banning same-sex marriage, but prospects for passage are uncertain, Gabbard said. This year, the lawmakers failed to agree on either a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages or on domestic partnership legislation giving homosexual and lesbian couples the legal and financial benefits of married couples. If all legislative efforts fail, voters can propose a constitutional amendment at an upcoming constitutional convention, which would take place in 1998 or 2000, Gabbard said.    </font></p>

Bankrupt Cult Awareness Network sold to Scientologist</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A prominent anti-cult network has been forced into bankruptcy and its assets sold, </B>crippling a nationwide anti-cult movement that kept unorthodox religions on the defensive. The Cult Awareness Network, based in Chicago, was influential for 20 years in shaping the public's image of controversial religious groups. CAN staff members took 350 telephone inquiries a week from distraught parents whose children had joined unconventional religious groups, and also gave interviews to media around the world. <BR> <B>...The Cult Awareness Network not only supplied information, but gave parents references to &quot;deprogrammers.&quot; </B>Although CAN said it advocated only legal means to remove devotees from cults, some of the deprogrammers were convicted of using force. Now, many of the groups CAN described as cults have become increasingly accepted by society at large, including Scientology, the Unification Church, the Hare Krishnas, Boston Church of Christ, and Transcendental Mediation. <BR> <B>...A barrage of lawsuits filed for years by members of the Church of Scientology</B> drained CAN of $300,000 annually in legal fees. Many of the suits were dismissed, but one finally drove CAN into bankruptcy. It was brought by 18-year-old Jason Scott, who alleged that a local CAN volunteer referred his mother to a deprogrammer who then kidnapped and handcuffed him, gagged him with tape, and forced him to watch videos about cults. Scott won a $1.8 million judgment against CAN and now is the group's main creditor. <BR> <B>...A bankruptcy trustee recently sold CAN's name, logo, telephone number, and post office box</B> to the highest bidder: Los Angeles lawyer Steven L. Hayes, a Scientologist. Hayes said he is working with a group of people &quot;united in their distaste for CAN&quot; who plan to restart the group so it &quot;disseminates the truth about all religions,&quot; <I>The Washington Post</I> reported. Also up for auction are 270 boxes of files that reportedly contain confidential information about current and former cult members and efforts to free them. <BR> <B>...The hostile takeover of a nonprofit organization could set a dangerous precedent</B> for other nonprofit groups, said Paul Lawrence, an attorney for CAN and president of the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington state. It is highly unusual for a nonprofit organization to be forced to pay punitive damages based on the actions of a volunteer member, Lawrence said. Most nonprofits have volunteers &quot;out there acting in a way that the nonprofits can't hope to monitor,&quot; he told <I>The Washington Post</I>.    <BR> <B>...In the absence of CAN, the anti-cult movement has now turned to the Internet</B> to share information. Prominent anti-cult sites include <A HREF=http://rampages.onramp.net/~watchman/>Watchman Fellowship.</A>    </font></p>

Almost 4,000 people respond to Christian drama</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A drama about heaven and hell drew 30,000 people to a church in Lake Charles, La., </B>over nine weekends. <I>The Judgment</I> was meant to be an &quot;illustrated sermon&quot; performed only four times in late August. But attendance and response to the play, which had been advertised mainly by word of mouth, grew so rapidly that it was presented 21 times. <BR> <B>...More than 3,900 people became Christians or recommitted their lives to Christ</B> during performances of <I>The Judgment</I>, written by staff members at Glad Tidings Assemblies of God church in Lake Charles. In the hour-and-a-half drama, characters rise to heaven or are condemned to hell based on their decision whether to follow Christ. The theme is similar to<I> Heaven's Gates &amp; Hell's Flames</I>, a Canadian play that has dramatically affected some congregations in North America. <BR> <B>...A large number of those who came forward during altar calls at the end of the presentations were not regular church attenders</B>, according to Jayce Bosman, a church staff member and son of pastor John Bosman. One man who had not been to church in 22 years committed his life to Christ, Bosman said. Some church groups traveled three to four hours in vans and buses to get to the church, and many people stood in lines for hours waiting to get in. <BR> <B>...Some of those dedicating their lives to Christ were young people, and most were under 50 years old</B>. The new believers ranged from &quot;very low income to leading members of the community,&quot; Jayce Bosman told <I>Religion News Today</I>. One man said 22 members of his family were saved. Those attending came from numerous denominations, with Catholic and Baptist being the most common. The decisions were obviously sincere, Bosman said; some people were crying and others had &quot;great excitement and joy on their faces.&quot; <BR> <B>...The drama has brought renewal to other churches</B> <B>in Lake Charles and beyond</B>. In an unprecedented meeting after the presentations ended, 100 area ministers of various denominations gathered for a luncheon to discuss the revival. Many reported an impact on members of their congregations, including those whose marriages were saved when spouses gave their lives to Christ. One pastor from a small church baptized seven people who had seen the play, Bosman said. The presentation ended Oct. 27 so that an extensive follow-up program could begin, and is expected to be repeated in the spring.    </font></p>

Freedom restricted in Russia</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Religious freedom in Russia is deteriorating</B>. Even while ominous changes in the 1990 national law on freedom of conscience are being considered in the Duma, opponents of religious freedom in Russia's republics are becoming more aggressive and successful -- apparently without challenge from the central government. <BR> <B>...In the last two years, one-fourth of Russia's 88 republics have adopted laws </B>harshly restricting religious freedom, Keston News Service reported. The texts of the new laws, obtained from 10 provinces, contain the same ideas and words, showing that opponents of religious freedom in various regions are sharing strategies. All the laws flagrantly violate Russia's 1993 constitution, which ensures all religions equality under the law, KNS said. So far, Russia's constitutional court has refused to review the provincial laws.   <BR> <B>...Pending national legislation could restrict the freedom of foreign missionaries.</B> If enacted, it would  allow religious organizations to operate publicly only by consent of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Orthodox Church &quot;would like to protect our country from the influence of the evangelical churches from abroad,&quot; Alexander Sorokin, editor of <I>Kristianstvo Segodnya,</I> a Russian Christian magazine, said in an interview with <I>Compass Direct</I>. The full Duma is expected to vote on the legislation in December. <BR> <B>...Evangelical Christians have little influence in Russia</B>, where they are not very politically active and have little access to the media, Sorokin said.    </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Nazarene missionary Ron Farris is presumed dead as a result of the Nov. 23 hijacking and crash</B> of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961, State Department sources said. Positive identification of Farris' remains is still pending, according to the Church of the Nazarene. <BR> <B>...The flight was commandeered by three hijackers, thought to be Ethiopians, </B>who were armed with an ax, a fire extinguisher, and a device they claimed was a bomb. At least one of them was drunk, and waved a whiskey bottle, survivors said. The hijackers demanded to go to Australia, but would not let the captain stop to refuel. For three hours, the pilot tried to reason with them, but the plane began to run out of fuel. It crashed near the beach on the Comoros Islands, off the coast of east Africa, killing 123 people. The plane shattered and spewed bodies into the sea, then quickly filled with water. Fifty-two people survived. <BR> <B>...Farris, 46, was &quot;an outstanding surgeon, a committed missionary</B>, and a man who carried a burden for Africa's suffering people,&quot; church official Richard F. Zanner said. Farris, his wife, Anita, and their four children have been Nazarene missionaries since 1987. One of Farris' responsibilities was managing  medical clinics that treat 40,000 people a year. He also helped perform the Kansas City area's first liver transplant in 1980.    </font></p>

Prison Fellowship will operate the nation's first Christian
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Texas' Board of Criminal Justice voted unanimously Nov. 15 to allow Prison Fellowship</B>, an evangelical organization founded by Charles Colson, to operate a Bible-based program for 200 soon-to-be-released inmates. It will be located at the Jester II unit, a minimum-security lockup in Sugar Land, near Houston. <BR> <B>...The program will be operated at no cost to the prison system. </B>Prison Fellowship will provide hundreds of trained volunteers to administer the program, the group said. The first-year cost to PF is estimated at $1.5 million. PF said it would seek payment for the program if it is extended beyond the two-year pilot project, but acknowledged that it is not assured of any payment at all. Criminal justice board member Allan Polunsky said he would never support payments to groups offering religious programs, because that would amount to state support for religion, he told <I>The Houston Chronicle</I>.  <BR> <B>...Christian beliefs will be the basis for the Jester II program.</B> It aims to change attitudes of selected prisoners who are within 18 months of release and to get them to accept responsibility for past conduct. The program includes counseling for prisoners and their families and restitution for victims. A number of Prison Fellowship programs could be used, including seminars, Bible studies, and one-on-one mentoring. <BR> <B>...&quot;Restorative justice&quot; for the inmate, the family, and the community</B> is the basis of the program, said C. Ronald Kariker, the Houston-area Prison Fellowship director. The program encourages repentance and &quot;a new birth spiritually,&quot; he said. The program is open to members of all religious groups. About half of Texas prison inmates say they are Christian and about a third are Muslim. It will not affect existing drug-counseling or educational programs. Inmates not enrolled in the program would be moved to other units. <BR> <B>...A similar, 20-year Prison Fellowship effort in Brazil reduced repeat offenses to 5%,</B> Reston, Va.-based Prison Fellowship said. Texas has been struggling to find ways to keep ex-convicts from returning to prison. Prisoners in the Brazil program &quot;had become a close-knit family,&quot; said Carol Vance, a member of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice board and former Harris County district attorney. He visited the Brazil program last December. Prisoners there cared about each other's welfare, had a positive outlook, and had confidence they would make it on the outside, Vance told<I> The Houston Chronicle</I>. <BR> <B>...The Jester II program is scheduled to go into effect in January</B>. After volunteers are trained, the first 40 inmates could be enrolled by April, with 100 by the end of 1997 and 200 by the end of 1998. Ultimately, the entire 378-bed Jester II prison could be dedicated to the program, PF said.    </font></p>

Episcopalians embarrassed by church scandals</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The Episcopal Church is getting an earful from its members</B>. Over the past two years, the 2.5 million member denomination sent representatives to almost every diocese, where they listened to 3,000 people talk about what was on their minds. <BR> <B>...&quot;Our people are embarrassed,&quot;</B> said Bishop Chris Epting of Iowa. &quot;Scandal after scandal&quot; has shaken the church in the last three years, he said. &quot;Faithful, dedicated Episcopalians...are literally begging the Episcopal Church to lead and to project a worthy life.&quot; Epting reported accumulated results of the diocesan interviews to the church's Executive Council Nov. 7-11 in Toronto. <BR> <B>...The denomination's most recent scandal involves allegations of sexual decadence in the Diocese of Long Island</B>. An article in the December edition of <I>Penthouse</I> magazine includes descriptions of orgies in the sanctuary of St. Gabriel's Episcopal Church in Brooklyn, cross-dressing priests who model themselves after Marilyn Monroe and Madonna, a sex trade involving young Brazilian men, and a wedding of two men, one of them an Episcopal priest. The rector of the parish resigned after the denomination began investigating published reports of the allegations, news reports said. <BR> <B>...&quot;What is appalling is that this scandal apparently prompted so little investigation</B> or corrective measures by the Diocese of Long Island before a pornographic magazine decided to pursue some news leads,&quot; said <I>United Voice</I>, a conservative Episcopal publication. <BR> <B>...Others who were interviewed said the denomination is spiritually adrift</B> and needs strong leadership. There was a call for &quot;positive direction and a clear identity for the church,&quot; the report said. Some Episcopalians complained they do not share the social and political agenda of the national office. Others said they did not like the size and scope of the General Convention, and criticized the dual roles of the presiding bishop as spiritual leader and chief executive officer. Across the board, dioceses demanded more support for local ministries, fewer top-down directives, and better communication. <BR> <B>...The national church should have a role in some areas,</B> the report said. These include ecumenical relations, Anglican global relations, and world relief efforts. The Presiding Bishop's Fund for World Relief, the United Thank Offering, and national stewardship efforts were praised. <BR> <B>...Executive Council members listened to the complaints and issued new guidelines</B>. They include more support for local congregations; creating a pamphlet explaining church programs and finances; realigning of the denominational structure and the General Convention; and better communications between headquarters and the dioceses. <BR>      </font></p>

&quot;Where are the righteous?&quot; leader asks at prayer-and-fasting
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>About 4,000 Christians gathered to fast and pray Nov. 14-16 in St. Louis </B>while thousands more participated at 141 satellite sites in churches, military bases, college campuses, and homes nationwide. Fasting &amp; Prayer '96 also was broadcast in two, one-hour specials on 133 television stations in the United States; the potential audience was 32 million households. <BR> <B>...&quot;There is a growing desperation in this nation today. Sin is rampant,&quot; </B>said Paul Cedar, chief executive officer of Mission America, the sponsor of the event. &quot;Where are the righteous? We have come to cry out to God. It is only by His mercy that this nation has not been consumed. America is in desperate need today of what only God can give.&quot; <BR> <B>...Other speakers included Tom Elliff, president of the Southern Baptist Convention</B>; Shirley Dobson, chairperson the National Day of Prayer; Bill McCartney, founder of Promise Keepers; Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network; and Adrian Rogers, pastor of Bellevue Baptist Church in Memphis, Tenn.  <BR> <B>...The United States is &quot;experiencing what other nations have experienced</B> when they turned their backs on God,&quot; said Campus Crusade for Christ founder Bill Bright, who co-chaired the event with his wife, Vonette. &quot;The goal here is to say, Lord, we have sinned against you, and we ask you to forgive us and heal our land.&quot; <BR> <B>...The prayer-and-fasting gathering focused on confession and forgiveness</B> and on praying for government leaders, the church, the family, the Great Commission, the media, athletes, and personal spiritual growth, Baptist Press said.  <BR> <B>...&quot;Weep for the church as Christ wept over Jerusalem,&quot;</B> Elliff said. &quot;Christ loved the church and gave Himself for the church so that we might present a glorious, holy church to God without blemish. But we are not without blemish.&quot; Christians have victimized themselves by preaching a &quot;synthetic gospel&quot; that looks like the real thing, but lacks &quot;Holy Spirit conviction, true repentance, genuine faith, lordship, and a changed life.&quot;  <BR> <B>...Planners hope to make the gathering an annual occurrence. </B>It originated two years ago when 600 Christian leaders fasted and prayed in Orlando, Fla.      </font></p>

Birth of &quot;miracle baby&quot; leads to powerful witness
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The healing of a guard's baby helped lead 21 inmates to salvation at Rhode Island's Juvenile Detention Center</B>. According to <I>Currents</I>, a newsletter published by The Evangelistic Association of New England, doctors told the guard that, according to their tests, the baby he and his wife were expecting would be born with deformities or Down syndrome. They recommended a third-trimester abortion. <BR> <B>...The guard shared his anguish with Mike Kropman,</B> an EANE ministry prison-coordinator who was visiting the center to hold a Bible study. Kropman talked about God's faithfulness when there appears to be no hope, and invited the guard to bring his wife to their church for prayer. The guard, who is Catholic, was hesitant, but agreed. At the end of the service, the guard and his wife came forward for prayer. Kropman and the elders prayed for the baby's healing and anointed the couple with oil. <BR> <B>...With their faith renewed, the couple made the decision to have the baby rather than undergo an abortion</B>. &quot;We are going to trust God,&quot; she said. Six weeks later, the baby was born with no sign of deformity or Dow syndrome. Doctors were stunned, <I>Currents</I> said.  <BR> <B>...A week later, the guard gave his testimony during another Bible study led by Kropman,</B> relating<B> </B> how God miraculously healed his baby. When the session concluded, 21 boys made a personal commitment to Christ. Since then, the boys have been reading the Bible faithfully.    </font></p>

Christian radio: Tuning out the world?</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Christian radio is mostly preaching to the choir.</B> Almost all its programming is meant to teach and motivate the 80% of  its 40 million listeners a week who are Christians. This is a valid ministry, but observers ask what can Christian radio do for the 20% of its listeners who aren't believers. <BR> <B>...&quot;Face it: our impact on the non-Christian world is minimal,&quot;</B> said Wayne Pederson, executive director of SkyLight Satellite Network, based in St. Paul, Minn. Non-Christian listeners tune into Christian radio for a variety of reasons. Some are 'secondary listeners' whose spouses tune in -- or are in an office car pool with the radio on. Others are attracted by discussions about parenting, marriage, and politics, just appreciate the music, or are seeking to understand Christianity. But they do not often hear the &quot;plan of salvation,&quot; Pederson said. <BR> <B>...Christian radio is not evangelistic because its Christian listeners want it that way. </B>Unlike Christian radio overseas, Christian Radio in the United States &quot;is 'me' radio. It has to interest me and relate to me,&quot; Pederson told <I>Religion News Today</I>. Out of concern for ratings, stations must give listeners what they want, Pederson said. Also, Christian broadcasters spend so much time &quot;criticizing the unbelievers in the culture, or attacking other Christians&quot; that they lose opportunities to change lives, Pederson wrote in <I>Religious Broadcasting</I>, a magazine published by National Religious Broadcasters. <BR> <B>...Recognizing that the United States is the fifth-largest mission field in the world, </B>a few Christian broadcasters are taking steps to shape a less introspective and more evangelistic medium. A group of 12 Christian stations owned by K-LOVE radio of Sacramento, Calif., airs evangelistic programs on Wednesdays once a month. Listeners are invited to call in for information about salvation.   <BR> <B>...Recently, 18 Christian stations in various parts of the country began an evangelistic project</B> with non-Christian listeners in mind. They are airing 60-second spots by Billy Graham, evangelist Ron Hutchcraft, and Peterson that give the &quot;plan of salvation&quot; and offer a toll-free number to call for information or counseling. Stations air the spots six times daily.  <BR> <B>...Response has been encouraging, organizers say</B>. Among 146 calls received during the first two weeks, 16 people prayed to become Christians and 13 others received assurance of their salvation or recommitted their lives to Christ, counselors said. After the test period, the spots will be made available to all 1,200 Christian stations in the country. <BR> <B>...&quot;If we were to <I>really</I> reach out to non-Christians, programming would have to be very different,&quot;</B> Pederson said. <BR>      </font></p>

Sermon draws picketers, media to tiny church</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Members of Plymouth Congregational Church in Watervliet, Mich., had to walk through picket lines</B> and the media to get to church Sunday. The 60-member congregation has been besieged by protesters and reporters after pastor Don Campbell tried to bar two homosexual men from a service Nov. 10. When the men came to the church and sat in the front row, Campbell launched into an impromptu sermon about the evils of homosexuality. The situation degenerated into a shouting match with about 30 protesters.  <BR> <B>...&quot;How would you like to be me today?&quot;</B> Campbell asked from the pulpit yesterday as he began his sermon, titled &quot;Gay Liberation.&quot; As Kip Thumm, who has attended the church off and on since childhood, his partner Roberto Torres, and the rest of the congregation listened, Campbell said he wanted to &quot;talk to Kip and Roberto and any others here. Are the camera's rolling? I want this on tape.&quot; <BR> <B>...&quot;We welcome you to this church as two sinners</B>. Do you buy that? We're all sinners,&quot; Campbell said. &quot;Kip and Roberto, everyone else, homosexuals, adulterers, bank robbers, swindlers, you and everyone else is welcome here to seek salvation. If you are not sinners, we're not fit to be with you folks because we're all sinners here. All sinners are welcome in this church. If you're not sinners. I don't know where you go.&quot; Thumm, appeared to be caught off guard, and nodded. With that, Campbell told a story, concluded the service, and retreated to his office, <I>The News</I> said. Both sides left the church claiming victory. <BR><B>...Campbell received more than 100 phone calls and letters last week</B>, and Thumm received hundreds of calls of support and was visited by several ministers who said he was welcome to visit their churches, <I>The Detroit News</I> reported.     </font></p>

Nicky Cruz preaches around the world, returns to the ghetto
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>More than 35 years after leaving a violent and angry New York City ghetto life, Nicky Cruz</B> still is delivering his message of God's love to gang members. <BR> <B>...Cruz has held evangelistic crusades in more than 40 countries</B> and led more than 10 million people to make professions of faith in Jesus Christ, his ministry said. He travels 400,000 miles a year, speaking at churches, banquets, and prisons 45 weekends a year. His autobiography, <I>The Cross and the Switchblade</I>, has been translated into 45 languages and is read by public school students in Scandinavian countries and the United Kingdom. Many foreigners are &quot;intrigued by American violence&quot; but their countries don't suffer from the same problems, according to Patrick Dow, who runs Cruz' ministry. <BR> <B>...Cruz once again is aiming his message at inner-city America. </B>&quot;In my heart, I have never left the ghetto,&quot; said Cruz, 57, who still commands respect on the streets. Since 1992, he has held crusades for gang members in Houston, San Antonio, Phoenix, Denver, and Colorado Springs. <BR> <B>...For three weeks before each gang crusade begins</B>, hundreds of former gangsters who now are Christians fan out through inner-city streets preaching, talking to gang members, and inviting them to Cruz' crusade. The volunteers -- many of whom are in various stages of rehabilitation -- come from churches started by Sonny Arguinzoni, a former heroin addict who 35 years ago successfully came through the first Teen Challenge drug center started by Cruz and pastor David Wilkerson of Times Square Church. <BR> <B>...Arguinzoni's group, Victory Outreach, has started more than 200 inner-city churches</B>. Membership is predominantly Hispanic, with many former hard-core drug addicts and convicts. The congregations are affiliated with the Assemblies of God and have their headquarters in LaPuente, Calif. <BR> <B>...For Cruz, it still is painful to share the story of his upbringing, </B>which he describes as &quot;foul and dysfunctional.&quot; Cruz' mother was a witch and his father a &quot;satanic spiritualist healer,&quot; he said. Both of Cruz' parents and his grandmother were sentenced to life in prison for murder, and his two brothers are awaiting trial for murder, he says. Yet, God has &quot;broken the generational curse&quot; on his life, he tells his audiences. <BR> <B>...In Denver this summer, 29,000 people attended Cruz' rallies</B>, and 2,500 filled out cards indicating their decision to become Christians, Dow told<I> Religion News Today</I>. Cruz is considering a similar crusade in New York City next summer. &quot;There is no quick or easy solution,&quot; he says. &quot;What has taken our country a generation to become may take a generation to repair.&quot;    </font></p>

Evangelical leader addresses National Council of Churches
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR>  Good morning, and greetings to each one present. Thank you for the privilege of being your guest this morning and for the opportunity to share with you my passion in ministry with the National Association of Evangelicals.   <BR> MISSION STATEMENT <BR>  The mission of the National Association of Evangelicals is to extend the kingdom of God through a fellowship of member denominations, churches, organizations, and individuals, demonstrating the unity of  the body of Christ by standing for biblical truth, speaking with a representative voice, and serving the evangelical community through united action, cooperative ministry, and strategic planning. <BR>  The question is often asked, &quot;Please define what it means to be an Evangelical.&quot; The National Association of Evangelicals would answer that question by responding with our seven-point Statement of  Faith. <BR>        <BR> NAE  STATEMENT OF FAITH <BR>  1. We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God.  <BR>  2. We believe that there is one God, eternally existent, in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. <BR>  3. We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory. <BR>  4. We believe that for the salvation of lost and sinful people, regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential. <BR>  5. We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life. <BR>  6. We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved unto the resurrection of life and they that are lost unto the resurrection of damnation. <BR>  7. We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ. <BR>  The National Association of Evangelicals was founded in 1942 in St. Louis, Missouri. The historic roots of the association actually go back to 1846 and the founding the Evangelical Alliance in Great Britain. Today, the National Association of Evangelicals is comprised of approximately 42,500 congregations nationwide from 48 member denominations and individual congregations from an additional 30 denominations and fellowships, as well as several hundred independent churches. The membership of the association includes over 250 parachurch ministries and educational institutions. <BR>  Through the cooperative ministry of these members, the National Association of Evangelicals directly and indirectly benefits over 27 million people. <BR>  Through NAE's headquarters in Carol Stream, Illinois, and its Office for Governmental Affairs in Washington, D.C., through its subsidiary, World Relief Corporation, and five affiliates: Evangelical Fellowship of Mission Agencies, representing over 20,000 overseas career missionaries; National Religious Broadcasters, representing over 900 evangelical radio and television stations; Christian Stewardship Association; Evangelical Child and Family Agency; National Association of Christian Child and Family Agencies. NAE has a long history of service to its members, the broad church of Jesus Christ, and to those in need around the world. <BR>  Dr. Timothy George of Beason Seminary, writing in his recent paper, The Church in the Gospel: An Evangelical Assessment, has made some interesting observations regarding evangelicalism. Dr. George writes the following: &quot;As an international, transdenominational fellowship of  some one-half  billion believers around the world, evangelicalism is, in its very existence, an amazing ecumenical fact. <BR>  &quot;The evangelical witness emerged not only, and not primarily, as a protest against abuses in the church, but rather as a protest for the truth of the Gospel. <BR>  &quot;Wolfhart Pannenberg has said that evangelicals, along with Roman Catholics and Orthodox believers, constitute one of the three ascendent, most resilient forces within world Christianity as it prepares to enter the third millennium. But who are these evangelicals? <BR>  &quot;Evangelicals are a worldwide fellowship of Bible believing Christians whose faith and life are marked by four major emphases: 1) the authority and sufficiency of Holy Scripture, the only normative rule of faith and practice for all true believers; 2) the uniqueness of redemption through the death of Christ upon the cross, the benefits of which are imputed to believers who are justified by faith alone; 3) the necessity of personal conversion wrought by the Holy Spirit through personal repentance, faith, and issuing in a life of obedience and growth in Christ, and 4) the priority and urgency of evangelism and missions in fulfillment of the Great Commission of Christ Himself. <BR>  &quot;As a distinctive stream within the wider Christian tradition, evangelicalism has been fed by many diverse rivulets and tributaries including Puritanism, Pietism, and most vigorously in the last 100 years, Pentecostalism.&quot; <BR>  Dr. George identifies &quot;three historical complexes which have had a decisively defining importance for contemporary evangelicals, especially in North America. These are the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, the Great Awakening of the 18th century, and the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy in the 20th century. The Protestant Reformation was a tremendous movement of ecclesial and spiritual renewal which has served historically as a benchmark for evangelical theology, devotion and, in some cases, even church governance. The Great Awakening, epitomized in the life and work of John and Charles Wesley, George Whitfield, and Jonathan Edwards, is an important paradigm not only because it combined an emphasis on the new birth with  reform of society, but also because it spawned three vital movements which continue to shape evangelical priorities to this day: the modern missionary crusade, the holiness movement and revivalism. The Fundamentalist-Modernist conflicts forced evangelicals to define themselves theologically and to forge an interdenominational coalition on this basis.&quot; Thus we now have the National Association of Evangelicals, founded in 1942 with the motto, &quot;cooperation without compromise.&quot; <BR>  Today we find a new and positive identity in the statement, &quot;In essentials, unity; in distinctives, liberty; in all things, charity.&quot;  <BR>  Today, eight core values are the foundation for the various ministries of the National Association of Evangelicals.  These core values are as follows: <BR>  1. Growing Biblical Faith. We believe in a biblical faith demonstrated by loyalty to the Word of God and commitment to proclaiming its message worldwide. <BR>  2. Fostering Cooperation. NAE promotes fellowship, cooperation, networking and dialogue as a means of evangelical witness representing and supporting autonomy of each local church, denomination, organization and institution. <BR>  3. Witness to Society. Confronting society with the relevance of the Gospel by being salt and by reflecting Christ's light is one of our missions. <BR>  4. Ministry to the Poor. We minister to the poor and hungry through physical aid and spiritual witness. <BR>  5. Attending to Human Concerns. We stand committed to biblically defined human values, the sanctity of human life, and human rights. <BR>  6. Cross Cultural Involvement. NAE celebrates the ethnic diversity in the world and will work to bring healing and involvement of the races in our ministry. <BR>  7. Maximizing Resources. NAE seeks the maximization and stewardship of all resources God has given to us. <BR>  8. Nurturing Communications. We will use media to engage our culture at every level with the absolute truth claims of the Gospel. <BR>  Our strategic plan for the dawn of the twenty-first century entitled An Evangelical Manifesto has been released and is available for you today. This document is directed toward revival and renewal in this nation and is based on the Great Commandment of John 13 &amp; 17 as an integral part of the Great Commission of Mark 16 and Matthew 28. Our manifesto provides the guide for operation of NAE's varied ministries and specifically calls for action in five areas: <BR>  1.  A call for prayer which is a prelude to effective ministry. <BR>  2.  A call for repentance and reform. <BR>  3.  A call for unity and cooperation. <BR>  4.  A call for evangelism. <BR>  5.  A call for cultural impact. <BR>  Currently, two major projects dealing with racial reconciliation and concern for persecuted Christians around the world are the focus of much attention. <BR>  In cooperation with the National Black Evangelical Association and with the assistance of Zondervan Publishing, a national effort has been launched and materials supplied to assist local churches in dealing with racial reconciliation. Copies of the materials that have been prepared can be supplied by contacting my office. <BR>  According to some of the nation's leading journalists, the persecution of Christians around the world may be the greatest human rights violation of this decade. In cooperation with the North American office of the World Evangelical Fellowship, 70,000 packets dealing with the problem of religious persecution were distributed to churches across the country. A twenty-minute video presentation was prepared that calls America's church leaders to petition the government to do something about these atrocities involving violations of conscience and also presented actual cases of severe religious persecution. Ten thousand copies of the video were distributed to churches and agencies across the nation. <BR>  Perhaps the world's best known evangelical, Billy Graham, stated in the epilogue of our evangelical manifesto the following, &quot;The world in our time is said to have made discipleship harder. But it has also made evangelism easier. Today's world is said to be multiplying crisis all around us. But we must never forget that, for the Gospel, each crisis is an opportunity. So it is important that we speak and act in  hope. The night has not yet fallen. The culture is far from closed. In our modern world, more people are more open at more moments in their lives than perhaps at any time in history. <BR>  &quot;Evangelicalism has a future to the extent that we evangelicals ourselves are drawn by the Gospel, are defined by the Gospel, and are declaring and demonstrating the Gospel of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, in word and deed.&quot; <BR>  Please feel free to visit us at our headquarters in Carol Stream or at our website: <A HREF=http://www.nae.net>http://www.nae.net.</A> We'll look forward to hearing from you. <BR> <I>Note: The National Association of Evangelicals is located at 450 Gundersen Drive, Carol Stream, Ill., 60188.

Medical rationing: Who lives and who dies?</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Rationing of organ transplants is becoming a reality in the United States</B>. A group that controls the allocation of liver transplants decided this week that dying patients with the best chance for survival will get top priority. Those who are just as ill but have less of a chance for survival will have lower priority. In the past, the sickest people were at the top of the list to receive new livers, regardless of their chance for survival.  <BR> <B>...People who have a sudden liver failure will be moved to the top of the list </B>because they usually do better after a transplant than those who have been ill for a long time. Others given top priority because of a higher success rate are those who just had a liver transplant that failed within seven days and children who would suffer damage to their nervous systems if they did not immediately get a transplant. <BR> <B>...The liver decision is a test case for medical rationing in general</B>, bioethicist Dr. Arthur Caplan of the University of Pennsylvania told <I>The New York Times</I>. &quot;All of us will have to confront the decision of what is fair in the allocation of scarce resources,&quot; he said. Last year, 7,279 people put their names on waiting lists for a liver, but only 3,922 liver transplants were performed. The decision to change priorities was made this week by the United Network for Organ Sharing, a private group of transplant experts overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.     </font></p>

Sermon turns into shouting match over homosexuality</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The pastor of a Michigan church who criticized two homosexual congregants from the pulpit</B> last Sunday plans to renew his attack at services this weekend, he told <I>The Detroit News</I>. Don Campbell, pastor of Watervliet's Congregational Church, criticized Kip Thumm, 28, who openly acknowledges his homosexuality. Thumm said he will be at services again this Sunday and expects to be accompanied by hundreds of supporters carrying picket signs and holding a candlelight vigil. <BR> <B>...Thumm said Campbell called him several days before last Sunday's service</B> and told him he was not  welcome at the church. Thumm, a lifelong church member, said his parents were married in the church, he went to Sunday school and Boy Scout meetings there, and that Campbell buried his father. &quot;I'm not going to let him keep me away,&quot; he said. <BR> <B>...During the service, when Campbell saw Thumm in a front pew accompanied by 30 supporters</B>, he changed the sermon topic from the importance of Veterans Day to homosexuality. The pastor said homosexuals should be cast out of God's house.  <BR> <B>...Then things got out of hand,</B> <I>The News</I> reported. A few of Thumm's supporters shouted, stood up, and pointed at Campbell. He responded by saying, &quot;This isn't an open forum&quot; and &quot;Read the Bible, young man!&quot; <BR> <B>...Then an elderly man grabbed the arm of one of Thumm's supporters, telling him to let the pastor finish talking</B>. When Campbell jumped down from the pulpit and tried to calm the elderly man, one of Thumm's supporters stood up and addressed the congregation, saying &quot;God loves us! Homosexuality is more than sex. It's about pride and identity!&quot; The man then burst into tears as he was escorted out. Another congregant rose and pointed his finger at Thumm's supporters, yelling that he hadn't come to &quot;listen to you people,&quot; but to worship God. Campbell managed to regain order, telling the congregants to &quot;go in peace.&quot;    </font></p>

Prisoners in Argentina spread revival</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Argentina's prison system is experiencing a spiritual revival,</B> according to Richard Riss, an American who was part of a group of 70 Christians visiting there recently. The center of the revival is Olmos prison, a maximum security facility. Approximately 1,400 of the 3,000 inmates -- including many former murderers, rapists, and thieves -- have become Christians, Riss said. <BR> <B>...The Olmos prisoners spend much of their time praying for worldwide revival</B>. While his group was visiting, several hundred prisoners held joint services with them. &quot;The prisoners prayed for us, and the Lord touched us all mightily,&quot; Riss said. <BR> <B>...People fax prayer requests to the prisoners</B>. Revivals in other prisons reportedly have begun<B> </B>after<B> </B>prisoners from Olmos are transferred there. <BR> <B>...Argentina has experienced revival since the 1980s</B>. In 1990, a change occurred when unusual spiritual manifestations described as &quot;drunkenness in the Spirit&quot; and &quot;holy laughter&quot; began. In 1993, those manifestations spread from Argentina to Canada after John and Carol Arnott of Toronto visited revival meetings in Argentina. Since then, the so-called &quot;Toronto Blessing&quot; has spread to other parts of the world. <BR> <B>...Children have played a role in Argentina's revival.</B> Riss attended a church service in Buenos Aires during which children led worship, gave testimonies of healings and conversions, and prayed for the sick. A visiting Swiss pastor who was suffering a 90% hearing loss received complete healing when an Argentine child, who had been unaware of the pastor's condition, prayed, &quot;Lord, open his ears,&quot; Riss said. The children also prayed for their classmates, hospital patients, and political leaders.    </font></p>

Evangelical leader addresses convention of National Council

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>For the first time, a president of the National Association of Evangelicals has formally addressed the general assembly of the National Council of Churches</B>. NAE President Don Argue spoke to the group this morning in Chicago, explaining the NAE's values and mission. The NAE represents many of the nation's theologically and politically conservative groups, while the NCC's 33 Protestant and Orthodox member organizations are more ecumenical and comparatively more liberal. <BR> <B>...The speech was &quot;an open invitation from them to get to know us,&quot;</B> the NAE's David Melvin told <I>Religion News Today</I>. The two organizations have no plans to form any &quot;structural unity,&quot; he said, but the NAE will cooperate with any group on significant issues &quot;as long as we can maintain our evangelical integrity.&quot; The NAE is &quot;moving cautiously&quot; so it will not endanger relationships it already has built among evangelicals, he said. <BR> <B>...NAE leaders considered the &quot;political land mines&quot; inherent in Argue's appearance</B> before the NCC, Melvin said. The speech gave Argue the opportunity to explain evangelicalism and &quot;bring the gospel to bear on broader communities.&quot; <BR> <B>...On Friday, Imam Wallace Deen Mohammed, leader of Al-Islam</B>, the largest orthodox African American Muslim movement, was to address an interfaith prayer breakfast at the NCC's general assembly.     </font></p>

Religious leaders will monitor violations of  freedom abroad
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The State Department named 20 religious leaders to a new committee advising the Clinton administration</B> on abuses of  religious liberty overseas. The leaders will look for ways religious groups can mediate conflicts, according to John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state and chair of the committee. Shattuck said his experience working with Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim leaders in Bosnia has shown him &quot;how important it is to stand up for religious freedom and tolerance.&quot; <BR> <B>...The committee includes Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Muslim, Jewish, and Baha'i clergy</B>. Also included are scholars who are experts in international conflict resolution, religious diversity, and the Holocaust. Two evangelicals joined the committee: Don Argue, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, and James Henry, pastor of First Baptist in Orlando and former head of the Southern Baptist Convention. <BR> <B>...Evangelicals had been pressing the administration to appoint a special advisor to focus specifically on persecution of Christians</B>. Instead, the State Department formed a committee with a broader mandate: to address human rights abuses against people of all religions. In the past several years, human-rights organizations have documented torture and killing of Christians, Buddhists, Bahai's, and Muslims. <BR> <B>...Critics said they were concerned the committee would gridlock</B> because its members have fundamental differences over the basic facts. &quot;If it turns out to be a sham, then we'll take appropriate action,&quot; Richard Cizik of the National Association of Evangelicals told <I>The Washington Post</I>. But until then, &quot;let's assume it's being done in good faith.&quot; Announcement of the committee was delayed until after the election because the White House wanted to avoid the perception it was trying to win favor in the religious community, <I>The Post</I> said. <BR> <B>...President Clinton should take the lead against religious persecution, </B>Cizik told <I>Religion News Today</I>. Clinton should &quot;use his bully pulpit&quot; to speak out personally, something he hasn't yet done, Cizik said. The NAE also will push for &quot;more straightforward&quot; discussion of religious rights violations in the State Department's annual human rights report and promote legislation ensuring better treatment for those seeking asylum in the United States, he said. <BR> <B>...Shattuck is expected to accompany Secretary of State Warren Christopher on a four-day visit to China</B> this weekend. He said Beijing's repression of Tibetan culture and religion is an example of an abusive international situation the advisory panel plans to investigate. Christopher plans to raise human rights concerns with Chinese leaders during his trip, U.S. officials said. <BR> <B>...In addition to Argue and Henry, the advisory committee on religious freedom abroad</B> includes: Joan Brown Campbell, National Council of Churches of Christ; Diana L. Eck, Harvard University; Wilma M. Ellis, Baha'is of the Americas; Irving Greenberg, National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership; Frederick Calhoun James, African Methodist Episcopal Church; Leonid Kishkovsky, Orthodox Church of America; Samuel Billy Kyles, Memorial Baptist Church, Memphis, Tenn.; Deborah E. Lipstadt, Emory University; David Little, U.S. Institute of Peace; Laila Al-Marayati, Muslim Women's League; Theodore E. McCarrick, Archbishop of Newark; Wallace Deen Mohammed, Society of Muslim Americans; Russel Marion Nelson, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Ricardo Ramirez, Bishop of Las Cruces, N.M.; Barnett Richard Rubin, Council on Foreign Relations; Nina Shea, Puebla Project of Freedom House; Elliot Sperling, Indiana University; and Archbishop Spyridon of America, Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.    </font></p>

Violent, troubled young people find a new kind of gang in
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A group of former gang members in Boston says their new faith in Christ has helped them avoid drugs and violence</B>. The group, which calls itself God's Posse, is made up of about 25 young black men who once were among the city's most dangerous gangsters. &quot;These are extreme individuals,&quot; Posse co-founder Richard Williamson, a public school math teacher and church deacon, told <I>The Boston Globe</I>. <BR> <B>...Posse members don't drink, smoke, do drugs, or carry weapons</B>. Instead, they pray and worship together in a house they call the Holy House, and take their message to others at a YMCA. Members also try to abstain from sex until marriage, although they say the temptations are numerous. <BR> <B>...Half the Posse members recently left prison, and some encountered God while behind bars</B>. Williamson and co-founder Chris Womack, who used to sell drugs and weapons, started the ministry by talking to prisoners. Many did not listen to their message about God, but some did. Former gangsters say they were just tired of running away from the police. Their lives were violent and lonely, and the Posse has been as close to a stable family as they have ever had. <BR> <B>...Trusting God in the inner-city often takes courage.</B> Posse members say God protects them from harm, describing how bullets have narrowly missed them and guns pointed at their heads have jammed. Three Posse members once intentionally walked into a crowd of boys who were archenemies of their old gang. The boys reached for their guns, but the incident ended with everyone praying and holding hands, <I>The Globe</I> said. Another young man tells how he was baptized by a former gang member he once tried to kill. <BR> <B>...Friends tell the Posse members they'll be back to their old ways in six months.</B> But the young men say that, although their path is littered with temptations, they refuse to let it happen.    </font></p>

Congress will consider altering tax exemptions for nonprofit

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Tax exemptions granted to nonprofit groups could change dramatically in the upcoming Congress</B> if  U.S. Rep. Nancy Johnson gets her way. The Connecticut Republican, who was narrowly re-elected last week to a seventh term, heads a House Ways and Means subcommittee that monitors the Internal Revenue Service. She plans to hold &quot;very in-depth&quot; hearings to determine if the exemptions are warranted and make any necessary changes in the tax code, she told <I>The Chronicle of Philanthropy.</I>  <BR> <B>...Tax laws have not kept up with the way some nonprofits operate</B>, and some nonprofits receiving tax benefits act more like advocacy groups and lobbyists, she said. Although the law bars nonprofits from devoting a large part of their efforts to lobbying and prohibits participation in partisan campaigns, they are allowed to inform the public about specific issues. Johnson said, however, that some nonprofits cross the line from education to politics.   <BR> <B>...Since it is hard to draw the line between education and advocacy, </B>Johnson wants Congress to create subcategories of charities and provide different taxes to each<B>. </B>Johnson said nonprofits that give direct services, such as soup kitchens or museums, should be placed in a separate category with different tax laws from those whose main activity is education on various issues.    </font></p>

Slave-trading in Sudan</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Children are being made into slaves on a massive scale in Sudan</B>, Christian Solidarity International alleges. The Swiss-based organization said tens of thousands of children have been abducted in raids permitted by the African nation's Islamic government. The government, based in Khartoum, has battled the Southern-based Sudan People's Liberation Army, composed of Christian and animist rebels, for 13 years. The rebels are demanding more autonomy from the Islamic-oriented government. More than 1 million people have died in the conflict. <BR> <B>...Tens of thousands of African children have been abducted from their families</B> in raids approved by Khartoum and are enslaved in the North, said CSI's Hans Stuckelberger. A Protestant pastor, Stuckelberger made his charges last week in a letter to the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights.  <BR> <B>...Christian Solidarity official John Eibner made a clandestine visit to Sudan last month</B>, Reuters news service said. Eibner was able to purchase and free 58 slaves, who told him they had been forced to assume a Muslim identity and were often beaten, the report said. <BR> <B>...According to United Nations human rights official Gaspar Biro</B>, who visited Sudan in August, the Sudanese army has been ordered to collect women and the elderly -- as well as children -- and take them to government-controlled areas. <BR> <B>...Khartoum has said it is concerned about the charges</B>. The government reportedly has appointed an investigative committee and has opened a center for traumatized children.    </font></p>

Tragedy of immense proportions worsens in Central Africa</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The huge scale of the tragedy in central Africa became increasingly clear Friday</B> as the international community desperately tried to find a way to get 1 million stranded Rwandan Hutu refugees back home from Zaire. Thousands of the refugees -- who are cut off from the outside world by a complex war in eastern Zaire -- were dying of hunger, thirst, and poisonous gases on lava fields. Western aid organizations warned that hundreds of thousands of people would die before help arrived.   <BR> <B>...The situation is a stalemate</B>. Tutsi-led Rwanda wants the innocent, civilian Hutus to come home; they comprise 95% of the refugees. But 5% of the refugees are Rwandan Hutu militiamen who fled their homeland in 1994 after killing 800,000 Tutsis. They refuse to go home, where they would face the wrath of the Tutsis who survived. The militiamen, who are still armed, are rampaging through eastern Zaire looting camps and villages. They also are guarding what is left of the refugee camps and have denied access to outsiders. Meanwhile, Zaire, tired of its destabilizing refugee burden, wants the Hutus out and will not allow aid workers to feed them. <BR> <B>...&quot;Soldiers and wrong ones are the ones most likely to survive</B>. The innocent women, children and the old are first to die,&quot; Fernando Rodriguez of Doctors of the World told Reuters. Many refugees are hiding in the jungle,<B> </B>according to an aid worker for Action for Churches Together. He flew a plane over the crowds, who were robbing each other. Food riots were occurring in the rebel-held eastern Zaire city of Goma on Friday. Rebels fired into the air to beat back 1,000 hungry people fighting for the last food in a U.N. warehouse.   <BR> <B>...In addition to the Rwandan Hutu refugees, many others are roaming over eastern Zaire. </B>They include demoralized soldiers from Zaire's ragged army, stranded in a growing rebellion against President Mobutu Ssese Seko. Zairian soldiers fired into the air and stole equipment from Mission Aviation Fellowship on Thursday, according to Herman van Heuvelen, MAF's operation manager in Uganda. Also, three Spanish priests were killed Thursday in the eastern Zairean city of Bukavu, Reuters reported. A number of Spanish priests, nuns, missionaries, and air workers remained in Zaire, unable or unwilling to leave the country. A worker from the British group Christian Aid who flew over the area said he saw semi-deserted villages and normally busy roads that now are empty. <BR> <B>...Aid agencies say they have all the supplies needed to save the refugees -- but no way to get to them.</B> No huge aid airlift is needed as it was in 1994, when Rwanda's genocide caused a mass exodus. After wars in Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Burundi, East Africa has a massive aid structure, with much of the food stockpiled in neighboring countries such as Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. <BR> <B>...The latest proposal was to create an international military force to protect the corridors</B> through which the refugees could be safely repatriated. Rwanda told the United Nations that it opposed any army contingent from France, the main advocate for military intervention. Any such force must be neutral, said Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimunga.      </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>More than 2,000 Christian leaders and laypeople will gather in St. Louis Nov. 14-16 to pray for revival</B> in the United States and the world. Hundreds more will meet at 102 satellite locations -- most of them in churches -- where they will follow along with the event, broadcast live from the America's Center. <BR> <B>...&quot;The United States is one of the most sinful nations in the world,&quot; </B>said <A HREF=http://www.ccci.org/>Campus Crusade for Christ</A> founder Bill Bright, who is leading the event for the third consecutive year. Fasting &amp; Prayer '96 is being organized by Mission America, an interdenominational coalition of organizations, individuals, and churches. Previous Fasting &amp; Prayer events have taken place in Orlando, Fla., and Los Angeles. <BR> <B>...After winning the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion in March,</B> Bright said he would use the $1.1 million award to promote fasting and prayer worldwide. This is the first time the event has been broadcast live to remote satellite locations. <BR> <B>...&quot;As Christians we have been unfaithful to God and our responsibilities,&quot;</B> Bright said. But he says the situation is not hopeless. &quot;We are confident that God wants to spare our nation. We believe He is going to send a great spiritual awakening to North America and the world before the end of the year 2000.&quot; <BR> <B>...Sessions during the three-day event </B>will consist of various speakers followed by prayer focused on topics such as churches, families, government leaders, evangelism, and youth. <BR> <B>...Organizers of the St. Louis event include:</B> Don Argue, president of the <A HREF=http://www.nae.net/>National Association of Evangelicals</A>; author Kay Arthur; Charles Blake of  the West Angeles Church of God in Christ; Bright's wife, Vonette; David Bryant of <A HREF=http://www.pfi.org./>Concerts of Prayer</A> International; Paul Cedar of Mission America; Franklin Graham of Samaritan's Purse; Larry Lewis of  the Home Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention; <A HREF=http://www.promisekeepers.org/>Promise Keepers</A> founder Bill McCartney; <A HREF=http://www.apu.edu/>Azusa Pacific University</A> dean Jesse Miranda; broadcaster Pat Robertson; Baptist pastor Adrian Rogers; <A HREF=http://www.apu.edu/>Moody Bible Institute</A> President Joseph Stowell; and Assemblies of God leader Thomas Trask. <BR> <B>...More than 140 Christian leaders have lent their support and encouragement to the event. </B>They include Ted Baehr of the Christian Film and Television Commission; pollster George Barna; Henry Blackaby, author of the <I>Experiencing God</I> Bible study; pastor Wellington Boone; Charles Colson of <A HREF=http://www.pfi.org./>Prison Fellowship</A>; Paul Crouch of <A HREF=http://www.tbn.org/>Trinity Broadcasting Network</A>; Youth With A Mission founder Loren Cunningham; James and Shirley Dobson of Focus on the Family; Ted Engstrom of World Vision; Eddie Fox of the World Methodist Council; Brandt Gustafson of the National Religious Broadcasters; Jack Hayford of the Church on the Way; educator and author Howard Hendricks; pastor E.V.

</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Religious leaders agree with each other on the state of the church and the nation</B>, pollster George Gallup found. Gallup's Princeton Religion Research Center conducted confidential interviews with 25 well known church leaders, seminary presidents, writers, and commentators. <BR> <B>...American culture is steadily deteriorating</B>, the leaders said. Society is fragmenting as people pursue self-interest, which often involves materialism and consumerism. Computers continue to drive Americans into isolation and loneliness, the leaders said. Evidences of societal decay are numerous. They include the flight of the father, deterioration of families, an increasing number of children born out of wedlock, trouble in public schools, and poverty. Some 39 million people -- including 22% of all children -- live in poverty. <BR> <B>...Increasingly, community life is shunned</B>. Thus, society is in danger of splintering into many special interest groups, each pursuing its own cause and distrusting others, the leaders said.  <BR> <B>...An intellectual mood called post-modernism also is growing</B>. This includes a loss of respect for truth. The objective moral order is considered to be merely a product of one's opinions or personal preferences.  <BR> <B>...The spiritual bankruptcy of the era has caused a spiritual hunger, </B>and leaders wonder in what ways it will be satisfied. Post-modern thought says all forms of spirituality -- including Christianity -- are equally valid. This outlook is resulting in a fragmentation of the Western religious heritage, the leaders said.  <BR> <B>...At this time of societal crisis, traditional religion has a great opportunity</B> to influence spiritual seekers. But the church may not be up to the task, the leaders observed. Deepening of faith requires intellectual discipline and moral self-sacrifice, and most churches today encourage neither, they said. Success will depend on orthodox preaching and teaching, small-group development, and powerful worship experiences, the leaders said.    <BR>           </font></p>

If the amendment had passed, it would have stripped most real estate tax exemptions from churches and nonprofit organizations, while keeping the tax-exempt status of nonprofit schools and property being used to &quot;house low-income elderly, disabled, homeless, or abused persons.&quot; <BR> <B>...Parental rights amendment was defeated. </B>Fifty-eight percent of Colorado voters turned down an amendment to the state's Bill of Rights that would have enshrined the right of  parents to &quot;direct and control the upbringing, education, values and discipline of their children.&quot; Debate had been whether the amendment would have helped or hurt children. Colorado was a test state for the controversial amendment, backed primarily by Of The People, an Arlington, Va., organization. Opponents such as teachers, social workers, and the American Civil Liberties Union said the amendment would make it harder to prosecute child abuse cases and lead to fights over what is taught in schools. Proponents said parents are losing control over their children to schools and the government. <BR> <B>...Gambling results are mixed. </B>Nine states voted on gambling. Here are the results: <br>   <B>Arizona: </B>Approved a measure to permit more Indian casinos. <br> <B> Arkansas:</B> Turned down a state lottery, legalization of charitable bingo, and authorization of up to three casinos in Hot Springs. <br> <B> Colorado: </B>Rejected gambling in the city of Trinidad. <br> <B> Louisiana: </B>Six parishes with the state's 14 riverboat gambling kept it, and 23 others voted to allow it for the first time. Thirty of the state's 64 parishes kept video poker, while 34 rejected it.  <br> <B> Michigan:</B> Passed a statewide proposal to permit up to three casinos in Detroit. Michigan also rejected a ban on bingo for political fund-raisers. <br>  <B>Nebraska:</B> Rejected a constitutional amendment to allow off-track betting. <br>  <B>Ohio:</B> For the second time in six years, voters rejected a plan to put eight riverboat casinos in four counties. Gov. George Voinovich commented that voters saw through the &quot;slick ads, false claims, and deceptive messages&quot; of the gambling industry. <br>  <B>Washington:</B> Rejected a measure to allow up to 500 slot machines at Indian casinos. <br>  <B>West Virginia: </B>Jefferson County allowed video gambling at Charles Town racetrack. <BR> <B>...Marijuana was approved as a prescription drug. </B>In California, mercy for the sick outweighed worries over drug abuse. Voters approved by a 56-44 margin a proposition legalizing marijuana, allowing doctors to prescribe it to fight pain in serious illness. Proposition 215 legalizes the cultivation, possession, and use of cannabis with a doctor's authorization. If the proposition survives court challenges, it would legalize marijuana for the first time since the early part of the century. Police opposed the proposal, warning that unscrupulous physicians would take advantage of it. Opponents plan to fight for tight scrutiny of prescriptions and tough penalties for abusers. <BR> <B>...Liberal won the Washington governorship. </B>In the governor's race in Washington, avowedly liberal Democrat Gary Locke beat Republican Ellen Craswell, who opposes abortion, calls homosexuality sinful, and vowed to fill government with &quot;godly&quot; people. The margin was 59% to 41%. Craswell's campaign had been backed by 2,000 conservative religious volunteers. <BR> <B>...Woman won a Louisiana Senate seat. </B>In a close race, Democrat Mary Landrieu edged Republican Rep. Woody Jenkins to become Louisiana's first female senator. Landrieu, who is pro-choice on the abortion issue, overcame a warning from Catholic Archbishop Philip Hannan that voting for her would be a sin. Jenkins is a 49-year-old Christian conservative. <BR> <B>...Across the country, 16% of voters identified themselves as members of the religious right</B>, while 80% said they were not. Some 38% of voters said they were Protestant, 29% Catholics, and 17% part of another Christian denomination. Three percent said they were Jewish and 8% said they had no religion. In a separate question, about 5% of voters identified themselves as homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual. These figures were complied from television networks and newspaper wire services.    </font></p>

Conflicts arise between prayer groups, neighbors</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>At a time when churches are encouraging home-based prayer groups, conflicts with neighbors </B>are arising around the nation. <BR> <B>...After one angry neighbor complained about cars and late-night noise, </B>the city of Pleasant Hill, Calif., told Charlie and Betty Peissner to get a permit or stop holding meetings in their living room. The Peissners, charismatic Catholic grandparents who have been hosting prayer meetings for 26 years, have an average of 30 visitors each Wednesday, though the number may go as high as 50. The meetings include singing, praying, speaking in tongues, and healing. They end about 10 p.m., but some people have stayed until 1 a.m. One night this summer, a young child from the meeting cried late at night and a car blocked a driveway, Betty Peissner acknowledged. <BR> <B>...The Peissners have apologized to their neighbors</B> for that incident, and now ask guests to leave by 11 p.m. But the couple refuses to comply with the city and ask for a permit. &quot;We could lose everything if that's what it takes,&quot; Betty Peissner told <I>Religion News Today</I>. &quot;We are prepared to stand our ground.&quot;<B> </B>The September deadline set by the city to apply for the permit has come and gone. <BR> <B>...The city's code enforcement officer says the Peissners are running a religious institution. </B>Keith Hunt noted that the meetings involve a regular congregation gathering on a particular day of the week and  performing a traditional ceremony. He sent letters Sept. 6 and 19 advising the Peissners that they need a permit like those issued to large child-care facilities. <BR> <B>...The Peissners disagree,</B> saying they do not have a regular membership and do not take up a collection. They say they are just welcoming guests into their home to sing and praise God.  <BR> <B>...Similar prayer group-neighbor conflicts have appeared elsewhere in the country</B>. According to attorney David Melton of the Rutherford Institute, a religious rights group, there have been several cases in which Hassidic Jews in New York were ordered to stop holding Sabbath worship. Also, a North Carolina man was told to stop meeting for prayer with two or three other people in his home on Sundays and a small group of Florida ministers were told they could not meet in a home. <BR> <B>...Underlying the tensions is &quot;a vendetta against religion,&quot;</B> Melton told <I>RNT</I>. Many people consider religion as &quot;the pornography of the '90s&quot; -- something that should stay behind closed doors and not be spoken about or enter civic life, he said. Inappropriately noisy prayer groups should be treated like noisy beer parties -- call the police, Melton said. But requiring a permit for a prayer meeting is prior restraint that limits the free exercise of religion. <BR>         </font></p>

Religion, morality important issues in races</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Issues related to religion and morality play key roles in Tuesday's balloting</B>. Americans will vote in races for president, U.S. Senate, U.S. House of Representatives, and governors. Voters also are taking action on 90 initiatives in 20 states and the District of Columbia. <BR> <B>...During the campaign, President Clinton openly expressed his religious faith.</B> A Southern Baptist who attends Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C., Clinton speaks about religion often, using biblical phrases and allusions. The President confers regularly with several pastors, and reads books on spiritual topics. He takes a Bible to services, follows along with the readings, and takes notes in the margins, said James Dunn of the Baptist Joint Committee. Clinton, who loves music, has been seen with tears rolling down his face during hymns. <BR> <B>...The President has cast himself as a unifier</B>, saying that Republicans in the White House would be a source of social division. In Tampa, Fla., last weekend, from the pulpit of  St. Paul's African Episcopal Methodist Church, Clinton said some people seek to divide society by &quot;driving wedges between us and exploiting our fears and convincing us that our brothers and sisters of different races, different faiths, different walks of life, are our inherent enemies.&quot; <BR> <B>...But some of Clinton's actions evoked anger from evangelicals</B>, who say they can't believe he is a Christian because of his support for homosexual rights and legal abortion. The President's veto of a bill banning partial-birth abortions prompted a condemnation from his own denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention. The SBC expressed disapproval of Clinton's suggestion that God &quot;could have revealed to him in prayer&quot; that abortion is acceptable.   <BR> <B>...Republican challenger Bob Dole, a United Methodist, rarely speaks about his faith</B>. Dole started attending Sunday school at age three and taught it as a young man, <I>USA Today</I> said. In an interview with <I>World</I> magazine, Dole said he reads the Bible &quot;sometimes.&quot; His wife, Elizabeth, is known for speaking freely about her faith. Dole supports a constitutional amendment to ban abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the woman is at risk. He has said Clinton cannot provide the moral leadership the nation needs.  <BR> <B>...Control of Congress also is up for grabs this year. </B>Two years ago, Republican conservatives became the majority in Congress for the first time in 40 years, resulting in passage of a number of key conservative pieces of legislation. That could change after Tuesday. <BR> <B>...Also, measures to legalize gambling are on the ballots in seven states</B>. Initiatives would make gambling legal in Detroit and permit riverboat casinos on Ohio waterways. Other gambling initiatives are being decided in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, and Washington. <BR> <B>...Colorado voters will decide on a measure that would eliminate the real estate property tax exemption for churches</B>. Radio talk-show host John Patrick Michael Murphy, a critic of organized religion, is on a crusade to tax churches and nonprofit organizations. If the measure passes, some churches say they would go out of business. Numerous evangelical groups are based in Colorado Springs. <BR> <B>...Parental rights also is a hot issue in Colorado. </B>Voters will decide on a measure that would give parents the right to &quot;direct and control the upbringing, education, values, and discipline of their children.&quot; Proponents, who include Dole, say the measure would strengthen the rights of parents in controlling child rearing and the curriculum in public schools. Opponents say the measure would open the door to parental abuse and make it hard to prosecute child-abuse cases. Opponents also say the measure would delay the decisions of school boards, allow parents to demand the teaching of creationism, and stop confidential drug, alcohol, and birth-control counseling. Similar amendments are pending in 28 states, and a bill is awaiting action in Congress. <BR> <B>...On the ballot in California is a measure to allow doctors to prescribe marijuana</B> to some patients to relieve pain. That would open the door to legalization of the drug, critics say. The measure is being closely watched in other states. <BR> <B>...The governor's race in Washington presents a distinct choice to voters</B>. King County executive Gary Locke, 46, a Yale-educated Democrat who is the son of Chinese immigrants, faces former state Senate president Ellen Craswell, 64, a conservative Christian Republican grandmother. Craswell says she will use &quot;God's plan&quot; to run the state and dismantle portions of government not justified by Scripture. She says government should phase out welfare programs and that churches and nonprofit groups should take over. Craswell, who has 12 home-schooled grandchildren, criticizes public schools for not giving parents enough control. Locke, a Baptist, says he wants a distinct line between church and state. <BR> <B>...The Christian Coalition said it distributed 45 million voter guides in 125,000 churches nationwide</B> and contacted three million to five million voters in person or by telephone during the campaign. The guides compare the stands of Democratic and Republican candidates on issues such as abortion, prayer in public schools, and homosexuals in the military. Critics say they overwhelmingly favor Republicans.    </font></p>

Presbyterian Church allows minister who had sex change</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A woman who was ordained as a man in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) before undergoing a sex change</B> has been allowed to retain her ordination. The Presbytery of Greater Atlanta voted in favor of Erin Swenson, a 48-year old father of two adult daughters, formerly known as Eric Swenson. <BR> <B>...Swenson, who was ordained in 1973, has been a private marriage therapist for 12 years</B>. Previous jobs held by Swenson include a position as instructor at the Candler School of Theology, a United Methodist seminary at Emory University in Atlanta, Ecumenical News International reported. <BR> <B>...It is believed to be the world's first case of a mainstream church body giving official recognition</B> to a transsexual, Reuters news service said. Anne Sayre, the presbytery associate for justice and women, told ENI that the presbytery decided it had no theological or moral ground to revoke the ordination. <BR> <B>...Swenson's former wife and father-in-law support the request for continued ordination status</B>. &quot;A wounded healer can be the best kind of minister,&quot; O.H. Lyon said.  <BR> <B>...&quot;This individual is a male,&quot; </B>said Wade, a minister who voted against Swenson's request. Wade insisted that Swenson's &quot;gender identify confusion&quot; can be &quot;healed by the power of the Spirit of God,&quot; ENI said. <BR> <B>..&quot;There was no serious discussion of theological issues,&quot; </B>said Wade, acknowledging that the denomination's Book of Order does not address the subject. A lot of people in the presbytery are upset about the outcome, he said.    </font></p>

Abortion law approved by South African Parliament</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>South Africa's Parliament has narrowly approved the Termination of Pregnancy Bill, </B>which allows any woman<B> -- </B>including a teenager without parental consent <B>--</B> to have an abortion<B> </B>up to the 12th week of pregnancy. Abortions can also be performed up to the 20th week in pregnancies that result from rape, abuse, or where there is physical or emotional risk. <BR> <B>...Most South Africans oppose the legislation, numerous polls show</B>. Liberalization of the abortion law has faced fierce opposition from Christian, Islamic, and pro-life groups, who have promised to continue holding public demonstrations. <BR> <B>...Pro-choice advocates say the current law is racist. </B>Many white women go overseas to obtain abortions because they are financially able to do so, while impoverished black women have unsafe &quot;back-street&quot; abortions. <BR> <B>...A total of 99 parliamentarians in the 400-member National Assembly boycotted the vote</B>, many citing religious objections, Ecumenical News International said. The Catholic Church has threatened to excommunicate members who aid abortion, although one nun who is a member of Parliament voted for the law. <BR> <B>...The abortion legislation was promoted by President Nelson Mandela's ruling African National Congress, </B>which instructed its members to follow the party line in the vote, ENI said. The bill now goes to the Senate, where it is all but certain to be adopted, and then to Mandela for signing into law.    </font></p>

Sluggish year for Bible sales</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Bible sales in the United States appear to have reached a saturation point.</B> At a time when Christians in some impoverished countries lack enough copies of Scripture to go around, Americans increasingly are letting Bibles collect dust on bookstore shelves.  <BR> <B>...Sales in the $200-million market for Bibles are peculiarly sluggish this year, publishers say</B>. This summer, the Family Bookstore chain shipped back $200,000 worth of King James Bibles that were gathering dust on shelves, <I>The New York Times</I> reported. In June, Bible sales fell to $3.7 million, a 48% decease compared to the same period last year, according to the Association of American Publishers, which tracks general trade publishers. Thomas Nelson reported its Bible revenues down 6%. <BR> <B>...There are just too many Bibles for too few Christians</B>, observers say. Several hundred Bible versions have been published, targeting every conceivable special-interest group. Some say the many different versions confuse buyers, who don't know how to choose among the numerous options. <BR> <B>...Some new Bible versions have their detractors</B>. Critics call easy-to-read Bibles -- which accommodate people who find other versions too difficult -- the &quot;dumbed-down&quot; versions, Ecumenical News International said. Other Bible versions contain paraphrases or liner notes that slant the meaning to meet theological or social-political criteria, critics say.    </font></p>

Participants in solemn assembly call for repentance</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>About 500 people gathered in Washington, D.C., for three days last week to fast and pray for revival.</B> Organizers of the National Solemn Assembly say the<B> </B>Oct. 24-26 gathering was based on the Old Testament Book of Joel. There, the prophet called for the people to &quot;cry out to the Lord&quot; for God's mercy rather than judgment. The event took place on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol, in Lafayette Square across from the White House, and at nearby Calvary Baptist Church. <BR> <B>...The featured speakers were 18 fiery national leaders. </B>They included Gary Bergel of Intercessors for America; author George Grant; Jay Grimstead of the Coalition on Revival; former Republican presidential candidate Alan Keyes; author Peter Marshall; radio host Janet Parshall; evangelist Richard Owen Roberts; and anti-abortion activist Randall Terry. <BR> <B>...&quot;We are in the midst of the greatest crisis our nation and the world have ever known,&quot;</B> Keyes told the crowd. &quot;Stand up for God's will and what is right in His sight,&quot; he said. <BR> <B>...Christians must reject worldly standards, </B>speakers said.<B> </B>&quot;When you have a low view of God, a high view of self, and your own view of sin, there is spiritual and moral decline,&quot; Roberts said. Early Americans knew that God punished sin, so they sought &quot;quick and thorough repentance.&quot; <BR> <B>...Parents need to wage a &quot;battle for godliness&quot; in their homes,</B> said Doug Phillips of the Home School Legal Defense Association. Phillips said he has seen wonderful results when fathers &quot;love their children so much that they are willing to give up everything in the world to see those children rise up in righteousness.&quot; <BR> <B>...Political leaders must repent</B>, said Pat Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition. He prayed for the overturn of  &quot;legislative and executive actions which export abortion, infanticide, homosexuality, and atheistic education.&quot; <BR> <B>...Christians must elect godly officials</B> and &quot;denounce, withstand, and defeat officials who despoil our godly heritage or defy God's eternal law by their public actions or private behavior,&quot; the group said in a proclamation. <BR> <B>...Some of the strongest words were directed toward the evangelical church, </B>described as being awash in apathy and neglect. Churches are &quot;impotent&quot; and pastors &quot;mute&quot; in the face of evil, the group's proclamation said. The evangelical movement is &quot;characterized by an arrogance that is almost beyond belief,&quot; Roberts said. He cited the &quot;neglect of prayer, the involvement of Philistine methodology, the moral evils, and the doctrinal corruption.&quot; Church services have lost their &quot;godly glory,&quot; said Regent University Professor Michael Brown. <BR> <B>...&quot;If we continue in this path, we will be utterly destroyed</B>. No man can save us. But if we will meet God's conditions, there is still hope,&quot; the proclamation said.    </font></p>

Slave-labor camps still exist in China</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>China operates a brutal system of slave-labor factories largely unknown to the West</B>, according to a prominent Chinese-born dissident. Harry Wu survived 19 years in the <I>laogoi</I> -- or reform-through-labor-camps -- where he was tortured and nearly died. Now as an American citizen, Wu, 59, is on a crusade to speak for those still imprisoned who are &quot;faceless, nameless, and voiceless.&quot;   <BR> <B>...&quot;Why don't you know about the <I>laogoi</I>?&quot; </B>Wu challenged his audience during a speech in Roanoke, Va., on Monday. &quot;Everything you saw in (the Nazi concentration camp movie) <I>Schindler's List</I> is happening in China today,&quot; he said. In the<I> laogoi</I>, prisoners become like animals, he said. &quot;If you treat yourself as a beast, you can survive. A beast only looks for food -- it doesn't care about ethics.&quot;  <BR> <B>...Wu made headlines internationally last year when he was arrested for espionage </B>in China while attempting to film the dealings of international merchants who sell slave-labor products. The arrest of Wu -- who was already known from a <I>60 Minutes</I> program that documented his 1991 covert trip to China -- drew an outcry in the United States. After a joint resolutions from Congress on his behalf, Wu was released.  <BR> <B>...In Wu's passionate speeches to legislative bodies and civic groups around the world, </B>he shows film footage of mass executions of Chinese prisoners. Such events, also documented by groups such as Amnesty International, take place regularly before crowds of thousands of people, Wu says. Their purpose is to instill fear of the communist leaders, whose grasp on power is slipping, Wu says. <BR> <B>...Body organs of executed prisoners are the source of  90% of the transplants in China,</B> Wu said. Some foreigners also travel to China to receive organs they cannot get elsewhere. Body parts sometimes are eaten, according to Wu, who said he has seen a man shot and watched the executioners eat the brain.   <BR> <B>...In addition to eliminating political and religious dissenters, the <I>laogoi</I> serves an economic purpose</B>, Wu said. The communist government uses income from goods produced in the prisons to fuel the economy and increase its military strength. Some missiles are sold to other dictatorships. Wu harshly criticizes Western businesses for their economic relations with the Chinese regime.      <BR> <B>...Religious freedom and other human rights in China are largely illusory, </B>a facade to attract investment money from the West, Wu said. China's official churches are controlled by the state and operate under strict guidelines. An illegal house-church movement is flourishing, but those involved are subject to harassment, arrest, and torture. Estimates of the number of Christians in China range from 15 million to 80 million. Between 50% and 80% of them belong to unregistered churches. <BR> <B>...Some prisoners are Christians arrested for their faith</B>, Wu said. In the 1950s, Chinese communists decimated church buildings, expelled foreign missionaries, and imprisoned Catholic and Protestant leaders. While in prison, Wu, who is Catholic, spoke to a priest who had been imprisoned 35 years. The priest had been forced to live in a four-foot-square room -- with a foot of water on the floor -- after he was betrayed by other prisoners who saw him praying.  <BR> <B>...Change is inevitable in China</B>, Wu says. &quot;We once believed that communism was our heaven,&quot; and that is why very few people complained. But the socialist production system has failed to deliver on its promises. Now, &quot;those at the top no longer are able to rule the old way, and those at the bottom do not accept being ruled the old way.&quot; <BR> <B>...Until change comes, Wu says he will continue his crusade. </B>He has 100 hours of film footage and 1,000 photographs, taken inside China, that he plans to make into a film. Wu also says he will return again covertly with a camera to his homeland. &quot;They troubled me too much. This is my chance to trouble them,&quot; he said.     </font></p>

&quot;Experiencing God&quot; Bible study making an imact around
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A personal and small-group Bible study called <I>Experiencing God</I> is having an extraordinary impact around the world.</B> The 12-week, workbook-style study is published by Broadman &amp; Holman, an arm of the Southern Baptist Convention.  <BR> <B>...A total of 1.8 million copies of <I>Experiencing God</I> have been sold </B>since publication began in 1990; it currently is selling at a rate of 40,000-45,000 a month. Versions also have been developed for teen-agers and younger children. The study has been translated into 31 languages. <BR> <B>...In addition, the study has been condensed into 60 fifteen-minute segments and is being aired on Trans World Radio</B> in Russia, China, and several Arabic countries. Plans are under way to broadcast <I>Experiencing God</I> in all of South America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.  <BR> <B>...An ongoing study of <I>Experiencing God</I> is occurring on the Internet. </B>Those interested can join the study by sending email to hub@xc.org with the message &quot;subscribe expgod.&quot; The next 12-week session begins in January.  <B> </B> <BR> <B>...The study has become &quot;a common denominator, bringing a lot of believers back to the basics of faith,&quot; </B>according to Sam House, coordinator of the <I>Experiencing God</I> project for the Southern Baptist Convention. The study, written by Southern Baptist leader Henry Blackaby and author Claude King, is being used by pastors and laypersons from many denominations, including Pentecostal and charismatic groups, House said.  <BR> <B>&#133;<I>Experiencing God</I> emphasizes praying for God's direction,</B> waiting to hear Him speak, and expecting Him to do extraordinary things. Participants are taught that God is always at work around them, leading believers to make major adjustments in their lives. <BR> <B>...&quot;Our world is not attracted to the Christ we serve, because they cannot see Him at work,&quot;</B> the study says. &quot;When the world sees things happening through God's people that cannot be explained except that God Himself has done them, then the world will be drawn to the God they see.&quot; <BR> <B>...Much of the course is a change of perspective from the typical &quot;American Christian mindset,&quot;</B> House said. Many Christians simply look for something else they can do for God than to follow God's leading, House said. <BR> <B>...Author Blackaby and his wife Marilynn lead couples' conferences</B> centered around <I>Experiencing God</I> several times a year. A conference this month at the Ridgecrest conference center in Asheville, N.C., drew 1,900 couples. Conferences next year are planned in Baton Rouge, La., Ontario, Calif., Dallas, and Ridgecrest. Blackaby also leads Fresh Encounter conferences, which explain how congregations can prepare themselves for spiritual renewal.  <BR>   <BR>       </font></p>

He is president of Good News, an evangelical reform movement within the United Methodist Church. Diane Knippers, president of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, is vice-chair of the association. Todd Wetzel, executive director of Episcopalians United, is in charge of membership and development. <BR> <B>...Organizers of the association represent groups in the American Baptist Churches</B>/U.S.A., Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Episcopal Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), United Church of Canada, United Church of Christ and United Methodist Church. <BR> <B>...The association's first meeting included discussions on same-sex marriage,</B> the plight of persecuted Christians, and feminist theology. The group, which will issue occasional position papers and public statements, plans to help renewal groups within denominations share strategies and resources.    </font></p>

Pope says evolution is &quot;more than just a theory&quot;
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Evolution is a valid explanation of the origin of mankind and is compatible with the Christian faith, Pope John Paul II proclaimed. </B>The Pope, in a letter to his chief  panel of scientific experts, declared his belief that the human body is not the immediate creation of God, but rather the product of a gradual process of evolution. John Paul II made it clear, however, that he regards the human soul as the product of God's immediate, divine creation. The soul is not subject to evolution, which is &quot;incapable of establishing the dignity of man,&quot; he said.  <BR> <B>...The evolution of man and other species through natural selection is &quot;more than just a theory,&quot; </B>the Pope told the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. The results of various studies, done independently from each other, are &quot;a significant argument&quot; in favor of the accuracy of evolution, the Pope wrote. Church observers emphasized that the Pope was not presenting his statement as a formal teaching of the Catholic Church, but discussing scientific evidence. Nevertheless, the Pope's statement put the weight of his authority firmly behind the idea that evolution is a fact. <BR> <B>...The Pope's statement did not address the apparent conflict with biblical versions of the creation</B> of the universe and Adam and Eve. It also did not mention Charles Darwin by name. Darwin proposed his views that human beings are evolved from apes in the 1859 work,<I> On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</I>, and the 1871 treatises, <I>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</I>. <BR> <B>...The Italian press reacted with banner headlines.</B> &quot;The Pope says we may descend from monkeys,&quot; the conservative newspaper <I>Il Giornale</I> said on its front page. The Pope has &quot;made peace with Darwin,&quot; said <I>La Repubblica</I>. <BR> <B>...The Pope's statement is certain to provoke disapproval from Christians who take a literal approach</B> to Genesis, called &quot;creationists.&quot; Their viewpoint, highlighted in the 1925 trial of Tennessee teacher John Scopes, has recently been reopened. A bill that would have banned teaching evolution as fact was narrowly defeated in the Tennessee legislature this year.  <BR> <B>...The problem of reconciling the biblical account of creation and the findings of evolutionary science</B> has been less rancorous in the Catholic church. For several decades, Catholic theology has held that the depiction of creation in Genesis is a symbolic presentation that leaves room for scientific theories of the origins of the universe and mankind. Many theologians, both Catholic and Protestant, do not believe the theory of evolution conflicts with the doctrine that God created the world and made man in His own image. <BR> <B>...The Pope's statement was seen as the latest illustration that the Catholic Church is willing to amend</B> what it finds are erroneous teachings. The Church also recently apologized for an infamous wrong, its persecution of Galileo for teaching that the Earth moves around the Sun.    </font></p>

Religious leaders urge American shoppers to shun products
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>As the holiday shopping season approaches, Americans should be aware that some products in stores are manufactured in sweatshops</B> in the United States and abroad, a U.S. labor official and religious leaders said. At a news conference, Labor Secretary Robert Reich praised the leaders -- representing Baptist, Episcopal, United Methodist, Catholic, and Jewish organizations -- for raising the ethical issue of sweatshops, where wages are extremely low and working conditions unsafe. Reich said his 800 inspectors cannot protect the rights of 110 million American workers in 6.5 million workplaces. <BR> <B>...Americans have a responsibility to make sure workers are treated fairly and with dignity</B>, the leaders said. Christians who ignore sweatshop conditions are not fulfilling their calling to be their neighbors' keepers, a representative of the United Methodist Board of Global Ministries said. The religious leaders said they planned to speak out from the pulpit, mobilize communities, and contact retailers. <BR> <B>...&quot;Selective buying&quot; is one way to increase pressure on manufacturers</B>, said Archie LeMone of the Progressive National Baptist Convention. Every three months, the Labor Department releases names of firms that deal with sweatshops. On Nov. 27, the federal government plans to release its annual list of companies that have taken extra steps to ensure their goods are not made in sweatshops. The religious leaders have not urged a boycott of any specific brands.     </font></p>

Halloween: It's not just for kids anymore</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Halloween, once an event just for kids, has grown in cultural significance</B> to become a month-long celebration for young and old -- a fact that concerns some Christians. <BR> <B>...Halloween is a multi-million dollar business.</B> For American merchants, it now is the biggest revenue-generator outside of  Christmas -- surpassing Mother's Day and Easter -- according to the National Retail Federation. Eighty percent of all Halloween costume rentals and 65% of sales are for adults, one trade group says. In addition to the costumes, Halloween now includes a host of items such as greeting cards, streamers, twinkling lights, and Oreo cookies with orange cream in the middle<B>. </B>A series of  48 children's horror books called <I>Goosebumps </I>(Parachute Press) sells five million copies each month, and more than 130 million have been sold since the series began in 1992. Scholastic Inc. produces a <I>Goosebumps</I> TV series, and other companies put the name <I>Goosebumps</I> on clothes, toys and other items.  <BR> <B>...The holiday is being celebrated in various ways around the country. </B>A<B> </B>San Francisco group, which has its roots in the lesbian and homosexual community, will hold the world's largest Macarena at a party in the Civic Center. Chicago will hold readings from Edgar Allan Poe's works and run a Haunts of Chicago walking and bus tour. New Orleans has vampire and ghost tours and a secret Halloween ritual starting at the Voodoo Museum. New York will hold its annual Greenwich Village Halloween Parade up Sixth Avenue. In Salem, Mass., site of the witch trials of 1692, there will be festivals playing up the city's history along with tours of the Salem Witch Museum and Witch Dungeon Museum.  <BR> <B>...Americans tend to have very divergent emotions about Halloween. </B>Some consider the day a positive way for people to deal with fear and crime, or praise it as a kind of national festival. But several school districts have placed restrictions on costumes and parties,<B> </B>saying they tend to be violent, offensive, or scary for children. Others promote alternative activities for the family that are clever, but not scary or threatening. <BR> <B>...Whether to celebrate Halloween has become highly controversial among Christians. </B>Psychologist James Dobson says he has mixed feelings about Halloween. The founder of Focus on the Family said the holiday's focus on the occult, witches, devils, and evil sends messages to children that &quot;Christian parents must regard as undesirable and dangerous.&quot; But some aspects of  the observance -- such as dressing up in costumes that are not occultic in theme and requesting treats while being supervised -- are harmless and fun, he said. Dobson advised parents to &quot;stay faithful to your own convictions and do what you think best,&quot; the ministry said. <BR> <B>...Some churches have called for a boycott of the day.</B> A few churches, taking an idea from a minister in Arvada, Colo., have put a new twist on traditional Halloween haunted houses. At Green Ridge Assembly of God Church's Judgment House in Scranton, Pa., visitors see depiction's of the aftermath of  an abortion, a funeral for an AIDS victim, teen suicide, and a fatal drug overdose. The climax is a trip to hell, hosted by a church member portraying Lucifer. The 30-minute presentation concludes with a visit to heaven.    </font></p>

</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The frail and elderly are least likely to support legalization of doctor-assisted suicide</B>, Duke University Medical Center researchers say. In their study, Duke researchers found that 39.9% of the frail and elderly favor such a law compared to 59.3% of their younger relatives. There was no evidence that those who care for the dying are more likely to favor assisted suicide, Duke researcher Harold Koenig said. <BR> <B>...Polls have shown that two-thirds of adults approve of physician-assisted suicide, </B>UPI said.  But the respondents were primarily healthy individuals under 60 --  the group least likely to be affected by such a law -- said Diane Wildman-Hanlon, co-author of the Duke study. <BR> <B>...Most candidates for assisted suicide will be female</B>, according to M. Cathleen Kaveny, who teaches law at the University of Notre Dame. Sixty-five percent of the people Jack Kevorkian has helped commit suicide have been women, who are more likely than men to live longer, end up poor, and suffer depression, Kaveny said in <I>USA Today</I>.     </font></p>

Small loans provide &quot;seed money&quot; in Third World
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A small loan goes a long way in the Third World,</B> a growing number of Christian humanitarian groups are finding. <BR> <B>...So-called micro-enterprize loans made to the poor</B> are often more effective than gifts, the groups say. The loans -- typically a few hundred dollars or less -- act as &quot;seed money&quot; that allows an impoverished  person to begin or expand a business, such as a small shop. Income from that business not only can lift a family from poverty, but make it self-sufficient. Such loans can help even the most destitute, including unskilled women in Latin America, poor farmers in Africa, and low caste people in India who had sold themselves and their children into slavery so they would not starve. <BR> <B>...In developing nations, as many as 10 people may be depending on one small business</B>, according to Food for the Hungry, a U.S.-based ministry that makes micro-enterprize loans in 14 countries. Other evangelical groups that make such loans include World Relief, which is part of the National Association of  Evangelicals, and World Concern, based in Seattle.  <BR> <B>...The most extensive and oldest such loan program is run by Opportunity International</B>, a Chicago-based Christian group that organizes loans in 27 developing nations. OI works through 50 local groups, which manage the loans, develop Christian leaders, and help the new businesses in various ways. Some $14.8 million in loans were made through OI in 1995, the group said. <BR> <B>...Emphasis is placed on commitment and honoring one's word.</B> The rate of repayment is 94%, according to OI, which also works through Prison Fellowship to give former prisoners in developing nations a second chance. One such loan helped a notorious ex-criminal in Zimbabwe, who now has become a Christian, started a business, and regained his community's trust, Prison Fellowship said.    </font></p>

Church can show Jesus film at federally funded senior center
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The U.S. Supreme Court today allowed an Albuquerque church</B> to use a city-owned, federally funded senior center to show the<I> Jesus</I> film and distribute Bibles. <BR> <B>...The case began in 1994, when Albuquerque rejected a request from Don Kimbro, pastor of the Church on the Rock,</B> to show the film and hand out large-print New Testaments. In denying the request, the city cited the Older Americans Act, a federal law that provides money for senior centers but requires that they not be used for religious instruction or worship. The city said the<I> Jesus</I> film, created and distributed by Campus Crusade for Christ, proselytizes by urging viewers to recite a prayer and become a Christian. <BR> <B>...A federal court ruled for the City of Albuquerque. But the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with pastor Kimbro</B>, saying the policy constituted unlawful discrimination based on a particular viewpoint. The circuit court said senior centers are public forums and that allowing the film to be shown there would not imply endorsement of religion. <BR> <B>...Also today, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the U.S.  military's &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy</B> regarding homosexuals. The challenge was brought  by former Lt. Paul Thomasson, who was forced to leave the Navy last year after writing a letter to his commander saying, &quot;I am gay.&quot;     </font></p>

Missionaries see hatred, hope in Rwanda</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>...The missionaries divided into nine groups and visited Rwanda's eight Episcopal dioceses</B>. At one sanctuary, Rwandans described how Anglicans, Roman Catholics, Baptists, and Pentecostals from both tribes had tried to take refuge from the killing. When militias ordered the crowd to separate by tribes, the people refused, declaring themselves all &quot;one in Christ,&quot; ENS said. All 13,500 were murdered and buried together in five mass graves, the missionaries were told. <BR> <B>...In another town, the missionaries visited a school where rooms were filled with 40,000 skeletons</B>, many with hair or clothing attached, ENS said. Those reluctant to participate in the killings were given the choice of  joining the executioners or  the victims. The skeletons were exhumed and displayed to show  what had happened. <BR> <B>...Many women described losing their entire families, </B>telling how their children were betrayed by their teachers or killed by neighbors they had known for a lifetime.  <BR> <B>...Some of those responsible for the deaths begged for forgiveness.</B>  The missionaries arranged for clergy and lay people from different tribes to share a meal and the Eucharist together for the first time since the killings. The services included spontaneous outpourings of grief and pain as enemies embraced and wept.  <BR> <B>...Whether the Rwandan church can renew itself  remains uncertain</B>, the missionaries said. Many church leaders were forced from the country and have not returned or have been charged with indifference or complicity in the slaughter. Divisions among church factions are deep, sometimes to the point of estrangement or, in one cathedral, open disruption during worship.    </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>...The gag order was prompted by the Roman Catholic Church's pro-life postcard campaign, </B>which aimed to persuade Congress to override President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion act. In an attempt to head off the campaign within the military, officers issued memoranda setting limits for speech and political activities. Their memos cited the pro-life campaign as an example of forbidden activity, the<I> Christian Science Monitor</I> said. At the same time, Catholic priests were being told by their bishops to preach about the campaign. <BR> <B>...Caught between two masters, Catholic chaplain Vincent Rigdon sued the government</B>. Rigdon, an Air Force Reserve lieutenant colonel, said the military's order infringes on his constitutional right to free exercise of religion. &quot;The supreme master is God,&quot; Rigdon told the <I>National Catholic Reporter, </I>noting that he would resign if he ever encountered a conflict that he could not resolve legally.  <BR> <B>...An Air Force rabbi, the Muslim Military Association, and a Catholic officer</B> from the U.S. Naval Academy have joined Rigdon in the suit, which is scheduled to be heard in Washington federal district court in November. <BR> <B>...The Pentagon insists its chaplains are not being denied free speech.</B> Chaplains may discuss the morality of current issues, but not influence pending legislation, Pentagon officials said. They also may get involved in politics when out of uniform.  <BR> <B>...The right of service members to have chaplains has been upheld in court</B>. In 1985, the Second Court of Appeals in New York ruled that without them, it would be impossible for service members to have religious mentoring, thus violating their constitutional right to free exercise of religion. But some observers say a government-funded chaplaincy creates inherent conflicts of interest, and should be re-examined.    </font></p>

With Alpha course, seekers feel at home, have time to think
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A Bible course for people who don't attend church</B> has provided hundreds of thousands of people an easy way to check out the Christian faith. The course, called Alpha, is deliberately unchurchy. It includes midweek evening meetings for a meal, a teaching on the Christian faith, and discussion. Subjects include Who Is Jesus?, Why Read the Bible?, Healing, and others. The final meeting is a weekend retreat.  <BR> <B>...There is no pressure, and no rush</B>. A new subject is addressed each week for 10 weeks, providing time for a comprehensive presentation of the gospel and consideration of  its merits. People who don't come back are not contacted. <BR> <B>...The atmosphere at the meetings is relaxed</B>. Organizers make the setting as natural as possible so people will feel at home. One organizer said he is careful about every detail: the lighting, food, parking, and the way people are welcomed. <BR> <B>...The Alpha course originated in England 20 years ago</B> when the curate of Holy Trinity Brompton Anglican church gathered a few people in his living room for a light meal, a talk, and discussion.   <BR> <B>...It is popular with many denominations</B>. People have attended Alpha conferences in England, Canada, the United States, Ireland, Germany, Norway, Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. An estimated 250,000 people will complete the course this year. For information, contact Terri Hibbard at David C. Cook Publishing Company (847) 741-2400.    </font></p>

U.S. has the most child poverty in industrialized world</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Child poverty is more prevalent in the United States than anywhere else in the industrialized nations</B>, a study by a Christian group found. <BR> <B>...Some 21.5% of American children are poor</B>, the highest rate among industrialized nations, according to the study done by Bread for the World Institute. The group, a companion agency to nondenominational, Silver Spring, Md.-based Bread for the World, said 13.6 million children in the United States are hungry or at risk of hunger. It did not define the poverty level. <BR> <B>...Out-of-wedlock births are not the main cause of poverty, </B>the report said.<B> </B>&quot;Economic and social forces beyond the control of  poor people -- such as declining real wages for low-skilled workers<B> -- </B>are more significant causes,&quot; it said.<B> </B>The report mentioned estimates that an additional 1.1 million children will be pushed into poverty by the welfare bill passed by the 104th Congress. <BR> <B>...Government has a crucial role to play in reducing hunger and poverty </B>because many people cannot escape poverty on their own, the report said. There will be broad support in Congress next year to attack poverty, the charity predicted. It said 500 congressional candidates out of 1,229 who were contacted signed a pledge to support federal programs to help end childhood hunger. <BR> <B>...An increasing number of people are hungry in former communist countries, </B>Bread for the World said. The largest number of hungry people live in South Asia, but hunger has declined throughout Asia and the Pacific, mainly because of  effective anti-hunger polices, the group said.    </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Two World Relief staff members were robbed, shot, and killed today</B> in Kompong Cham, Cambodia, as they left a neighborhood in which World Relief works. The two women, Khoun Sokan and Toun Chanthom, had been meeting with a group of neighborhood women who receive small loans to start businesses to earn income so they can feed and clothe their impoverished families, Wheaton, Ill.-based World Relief said. One of  the women died immediately and the other several hours later. <BR> <B>...Sokan and Chanthom were single parents and had worked for World Relief since the Gateway Program</B> began in Kompong Cham in 1944. Both women were Christians and active in their churches, the group said. World Relief is the international assistance arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, USA. <BR> <B>...The Gateway Program began in 1992 in Phnom Penh</B>. It combines basic lessons on money management with good health practices in weekly neighborhood meetings. More than 8,300 women have received loans through the program. World Relief estimated that its staff members in Cambodia have made more than 12,000 trips to and from the neighborhood meetings without serious incident. <BR> <B>...&quot;Sokan and Chanthom paid the ultimate price as they faithfully served</B> the needs of poor women and their children,&quot; said Joel Copple, World Relief's Cambodia director.    </font></p>

Doctor puts euthanasia instructions on the Internet</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Euthanasia software soon will be available on the Internet</B>, according to the Australian doctor who developed it. Dr. Philip Nitschke, who performed the world's first legal mercy killing, said Internet users could copy the software and instructions from a home page that is being developed, Reuters news service said. An estimated 50 million people worldwide use the Internet. <BR> <B>...&quot;We see no reason in restricting it in any way,&quot;</B> Nitschke said. Last month, he assisted in the killing of  one-time Christian missionary Bob Dent, hooking him to the machine with an intravenous tube. Australia's Northern Territory has the world's only voluntary euthanasia law. It enables people to give themselves lethal injections with the touch of computer keys. Nitschke said he also sent how-to-do-it kits overseas and around Australia using electronic mail. <BR> <B>...The software and the equipment needed to build the machine are simple and cost $160,</B> though the lethal drugs are difficult to obtain, Nitschke said. A doctor cannot lawfully hook a patient up to the machine anywhere outside the Northern Territory. <BR> <B>...Nitschke said he was developing another death machine that uses carbon monoxide</B> and an oxygen mask. This enabled people to end their lives without needing someone to insert intravenous tubes, he said. Nitschke said his machine is a &quot;slicker&quot; version of the suicide device designed by American euthanasia advocate Jack Kevorkian, who has attended more than 40 deaths.    </font></p>

Supreme Court to rule in important religious freedom case
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>...The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, passed into law in 1993 by Congress, set an important new standard.</B> It requires that any law which imposes a &quot;substantial burden&quot; on someone's religious beliefs must serve a &quot;compelling&quot; government interest. If such a law is imposed, it must be carried out in the &quot;least intrusive&quot; way possible.  <BR> <B>...The case involves space problems at a church. </B>The city of Boerne, Texas, told St. Peter Catholic Church that it could not expand its 70-year-old building because it was located within the city's historic district. The church sued, saying it could not accomplish its mission unless it expanded. St. Peter church has more than 2,000 members, but its sanctuary can accommodate fewer than 250 at one time, news reports said. The city lost its case, and has appealed. <BR> <B>...Boerne officials contend that Congress overstepped its authority by passing RFRA.</B> They argue that RFRA violates the First Amendment by giving religion privileges that other expressions of conscience do not enjoy. Boerne officials also say RFRA violates the 10th Amendment rights of states and local governments by forcing them to allow more protection for religious beliefs than the Constitution requires. <BR> <B>...Sixteen states have joined in a friend-of-the-court brief against RFRA, </B>contending that it has allowed &quot;gangs and like-minded groups to shroud illicit activity under the cover of  religious belief.&quot; Many prison wardens also oppose RFRA, since it has resulted in lawsuits by inmates challenging various prison regulations as violations of their religious beliefs. The Justice Department has defended the law, as has a broad coalition of religious and civil rights groups. <BR> <B>...RFRA was enacted to overcome a 1990 Supreme Court decision</B> in an Oregon case involving Native Americans. The Supreme Court ruled that there is no constitutional right to take the drug peyote as a religious practice. It said laws that are otherwise neutral toward religion are not unconstitutional just because they may infringe on the religious beliefs of some people.    </font></p>

It won't be another Million Man March, organizers say</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A planned rally marking the one-year anniversary of the Million Man March has attracted little attention</B>. Organizers of  the World Day of Atonement, to be held at the United Nations in New York on Oct. 16, expect fewer than 50,000 participants. <BR> <B>...Organizers say they aren't attempting to repeat the Million Man March. </B>&quot;We are celebrating a holy day. What happened last year was a spiritual event,&quot; Benjamin Chavis, former executive director of the NAACP, told the Associated Press. In addition to Chavis, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan again is helping organize the rally and will be its main speaker, issuing a worldwide appeal to end &quot;injustice, exploitation, violence, and war.&quot; <BR> <B>...Many black leaders aren't participating this year.  </B>Those not coming include Jesse Jackson, who spoke at the Million Man March; NAACP President Kweisi Mfume; National Urban League President Hugh Price; and Southern Christian Leadership Conference President Joseph Lowery, news reports said. Some leaders cite disillusionment with the organizers. <BR> <B>...The Million Man March raised expectations of a lofty crusade to tackle social problems</B>. Little of that has happened. Also, a promised political force has not emerged from the rally, said Ron Daniels, director of the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York.   <BR> <B>...But the legacy of the march also is spiritual, and is still unfolding</B>, others say. One purpose was to increase the sense of personal responsibility among African Americans, encouraging them to revitalize their neighborhoods and improve their families.  <BR> <B>...Many of the marchers have translated its lessons into personal terms.</B> Some say the march has kept their families intact and brought them into churches. Local men's groups have formed; some of the groups have fizzled, but others have organized campaigns and made progress in solving neighborhood ills. Many community leaders agree that today, social progress will come about more by individual efforts than large-scale actions, <I>The Chicago Tribune</I> said.    </font></p>

Spiritual renewal catching fire in Philadelphia</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A spiritual renewal is taking place in Philadelphia</B>. It began in July 1994, when pastors and other leaders from several inner-city and suburban congregations, calling themselves A Circle of Friends, began holding monthly services. In December 1995, Randy Clark, pastor of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship of  St. Louis, and his worship team led five nights of services at Deliverance Evangelistic Church, a predominantly African-American congregation. Clark, who travels internationally, is associated with the Toronto Blessing movement that began in 1994 at the Toronto Airport Vineyard in Canada. <BR> <B>...At the Philadelphia services, Christians of  many denominational and racial backgrounds worshipped together</B>. Repentance between races, healing of the sick in body and spirit, and an infusion of  joy and &quot;holy laughter&quot; characterized the meetings, which lasted into the early hours of the morning, participants said. <BR> <B>...Since then, Philadelphia's monthly renewal services have grown in size and scope.</B> More than 2,000 people from throughout the Delaware Valley attend. In addition, an interdenominational group of pastors from the inner-city and suburbs meet regularly to pray and fast for further renewal.  <BR> <B>...Clark and his music team returned to Deliverance Evangelistic Church Oct. 7-- this time for 30 days</B> of meetings. Leaders intend the services to be filled with worship, teaching, healing of the sick, and salvation of the lost, they said. Opportunities to serve the inner-city through witnessing and feeding the hungry also are planned. The meetings were preceded by a two-day seminar hosted by pastors and other leaders from suburban and inner-city churches. Seminar leaders included pastors Pablo Boltari, Carlos Mraida, and Pablo Deires of Argentina, who are involved in a spiritual awakening in that country. <BR> <B>...Clark said in a letter to the church prior to the meetings that there have been only three occasions</B> where he has had a sense that &quot;God was going to move in a certain geographical area.&quot; The first was in Toronto, Canada, in January 1994; the second was when going to Melbourne, Fla., in January 1995; &quot;and the third is my upcoming meetings in Philadelphia,&quot; he wrote. Deliverance Evangelistic Church is located at 2001 W. Lehigh Ave. in Philadelphia.    </font></p>

Hospital patients, priests slaughtered in Zaire</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Marauding Tutsis massacred 38 people in a Swedish missionary hospital in Zaire, Africa, Oct. 6, </B>news reports said. Most victims were shot or bayoneted while in their beds. The murders took place in Lemera, eastern Zaire, near the borders of  Rwanda and Burundi. <BR> <B>...Tutsis also slaughtered 12 people, including two priests, at a nearby Catholic mission,</B> said Dag Bohlin, a spokesman for the Swedish Free Pentecostal Church, which runs the hospital. As they were leaving, the marauders took hostages, including a staff member of  the British group The Leprosy Mission International. They also stole medicine, burned trucks, and destroyed part of the hospital, TLMI said. <BR> <B>...Those involved in the raids are part of a Tutsi subgroup known as the Banyamulenge</B>. Although they have lived in Zaire for up to 200 years -- arriving from what are now Rwanda and Burundi -- the Banyamulenga are a people without a country since their citizenship was revoked in 1981. Zairian authorities want to concentrate the Banyamulenge in government-controlled camps to make them easier to monitor. <BR> <B>...Tensions have been building in the region for months</B>. The situation grew even more explosive recently when Zaire gave 200,000 Banyamulenge an ultimatum: leave the area by Oct. 15 or be hunted down as rebels by Zairian soldiers. <BR> <B>...Zairian troops and large crowds set up roadblocks in Bukavu</B> Oct. 11 and looked for Banyamulenga. &quot;A general witch-hunt&quot; was taking place as suspected Banyamulenge were being dragged off by police, Reuters said. United Nations agencies tried to evacuate foreign staff from Bukavu and Uvira to the south. The TLMI said one staff member at Lemera, who is of Tutsi origin, &quot;fled into the mountains.&quot; Other TLMI missionaries also were evacuated.    </font></p>

Disease didn't disable evangelist's spirit</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>&quot;I have cerebral palsy -- what's your problem?&quot; David Ring says</B>. The evangelist likes to challenge his listeners -- some of whom may be depressed and feeling self-pity -- to compare their lives to his, and encourage them by what God can do. Ring, 42, was born with CP. His parents died when he was young, and David was moved from family to family. He recalls school classmates making fun of him and remembers thinking that everyone had given up on him because, &quot;I'm a no-good cripple.&quot; <BR> <B>...Until the day of his spiritual rebirth as a Christian, Ring had virtually no friends.</B> He isolated himself whenever he could, answering questions coldly in a monotone, and averting his eyes, according to <I>Just As I Am, The Life of David Ring</I> (Moody). &quot;If God loved me, why is God so angry with me? Why is God breaking my heart?&quot; Ring thought.  <BR> <B>...Ring has stopped considering himself a victim</B>, he says. He has not been healed of the disease and still &quot;walks and talks funny,&quot; he says. &quot;But oh! The joy that floods my soul because Jesus made me whole.&quot; Speaking haltingly but clearly, Ring causes audiences to realize that all things are possible through Christ. &quot;I can't even say Jesus plain. What's your problem, healthy man, women, teen-ager?&quot; he asks. <BR> <B>...Ring tells his story to about 100,000 people a year at churches, conventions, schools</B> and corporate events and has been featured on several nationally televised programs. He and his wife, Karen, have four children and live in Orlando, Fla.    </font></p>

Property-tax exemptions for nonprofit groups threatened</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on whether governments can remove a property-tax exemption</B> <B>from a nonprofit group</B> if most of the people it serves are not state residents. The case is a tax dispute between a Christian Science summer camp and the town of Harrison, Maine. Camp Newfound/Owatonna is appealing its $22,000-a-year property tax bill from the town and challenging a 39-year-old law as an unconstitutional discrimination against interstate commerce. About 95% of its campers are from outside Maine. Under current law, the camp would pay no property tax if most of its campers were from Maine. <BR> <B>...In the past, the Supreme Court has interpreted the U.S. Constitution's commerce clause as barring state economic protectionism</B>. This would seem to support the camp's challenge, <I>The New York Times</I> said. But Maine's Supreme Judicial Court upheld the law last year. That ruling alarmed nonprofit organizations around the country. <BR> <B>...Nonprofit groups have warned</B> that if other states took the same approach, many organizations that served an out-of-state population, such as colleges, could be liable for taxes on valuable real estate.  <BR> <B>...Meanwhile in Colorado, a voter referendum on the ballot </B>next month would, for the first time, require most charitable, religious, and nonprofit social-service organizations in the state to pay property taxes. The referendum is sponsored by talk-show host John Murphy, who says &quot;God is not broke&quot; but that Colorado cities are. If Amendment 11 passes, some ministries in Colorado say they will be forced to close. Orphanages, public schools, homeless shelters, housing for the elderly and disabled, and hospices would remain exempt.    </font></p>

&quot;Depressing&quot; level of racism exists, study finds
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Racial animosity and segregation still are prevalent in the South, </B>according to a government study conducted after recent church arsons. The finding is the result of  public forums conducted by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, a bipartisan and multiracial group. Nearly 90 black churches and 72 white churches in the South have burned since January 1995. <BR> <B>...Banks, schools, and swimming pools in Greene County, Ala., still are racially segregated, </B> the commission found. In Mississippi, animosity between the races is still so prevalent that blacks refuse to attend forums at a predominantly white college, <I>USA Today</I> reported. <BR> <B>...The fires &quot;are a message that we need to discuss race honestly,&quot; </B>Melvin Adams, director of the commission's central region, told<I> </I>the newspaper<I>.</I> The facts are &quot;depressing,&quot; he said. <BR> <B>...Racial hatred is a motivation for more than half the fires,</B> according to National Council of Churches spokesperson Carol Fouke. This includes animosity directed mainly at blacks, but also toward Latinos, Vietnamese, and whites who spoke out against racism, Fouke said. So  far, the NCC's Burned Churches Fund has distributed $2 million to rebuild or restore 24 churches, she said. The fund has received $4.6 million and has an additional $1.2 million in pledges. The federal government also has made $10 million in loan guarantees available to the churches, Fouke said.    <BR> <B>...Meanwhile, a 13-year-old girl who burned down a black church sanctuary in Charlotte, N.C</B>., embraced the church's pastor in court and apologized to him Tuesday. The teen-ager, whose name was not disclosed because she is a juvenile, admitted setting fire to Matthews Murkland Presbyterian Church's former sanctuary, <I>The Charlotte Observer</I> said. She has been sentenced to 12 months' probation, ordered to perform 200 hours of community service, and will continue mental-health treatment. The fire appeared to be an attempt to make a statement against Christianity, not African-Americans, police said. Pastor Larry Hill said the girl seemed truly sorry for her crime <BR> <B>...After the hearing, the girl's mother</B>, a member of Matthews United Methodist Church, talked about the ordeal. &quot;A lot of good has come out of this,&quot; she said. &quot;We have come to realize what is truly important in life: God, family and friends. We would like to thank Rev. Hill of Matthews Murkland and his congregation for their compassion, prayers, and especially for their forgiveness.&quot;    </font></p>

Farrakhan is a false prophet, black pastor says</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Louis Farrakhan is a false prophet, says a black pastor</B> who has studied the Nation of Islam movement for 25 years<B>.</B>  Jerry Buckner, pastor at Tiburon Christian Fellowship in Tiburon, Calif., said Farrakhan &quot;has redefined the Jesus of the Bible&quot; and succeeded in splitting the black church, Baptist Press said. <BR> <B>...Farrakhan says Jesus of Nazareth was only a type of the real messiah</B>, said Buckner, a leading authority on the Nation of Islam. He referred to a videotape of Farrakhan's 1994 Easter service titled <I>The Crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the Imprisonment of Minister Louis Farrakhan. </I>In that speech, Farrakhan says that 75% of  what the Bible says about Jesus refers to a future man. Farrakhan also says that Jesus of Nazareth and Elijah are the same person and that Farrakhan is Elijah, meaning Jesus, Buckner said. <BR> <B>...On the tape, Farrakhan relates the crucifixion to himself</B>, saying, &quot;I  am hanging on a cross right now. I'm on Calvary right now and the more I suffer, the more our people are raised to consciousness.  You don't have to look for Jesus. I represent him!&quot; Farrakhan says in the speech. &quot;That is blasphemy,&quot; or claiming for oneself the attributes of God, Buckner said. <BR> <B>...The Nation of Islam's day of atonement, called the Million Man March, tried to redefine the biblical meaning</B> of  the word atonement, Buckner said. Farrakhan's concept of atonement is deliverance or salvation from the &quot;white man's hell on earth,&quot; Buckner said. Farrakhan says that once white domination is thwarted, blacks will be delivered from ignorance, illiteracy, poor education, bad health, and other evils, Buckner said. <BR> <B>...The Nation of Islam is fighting white racism with black racism, and many blacks don't realize it, </B>Buckner said. &quot;The black community is so hungry for a black hero, for a black leader after the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that they are willing to follow anyone,&quot; Buckner said. As a result, conflict is occurring among black churches that support Farrakhan and those that don't. &quot;This little cancer in the church is going to spread,&quot; Buckner said.    </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Clergy increasingly are lining up with a newly revived union movement to promote improved wages</B>, benefits, and conditions for low-wage workers. <BR> <B>...They have supported workers through sermons, pastoral letters, protest marches,</B> sit-ins, petitions, meetings with management, and congressional testimony, <I>The New York Times </I>said. Support comes from black ministers, priests, rabbis, liberal Protestants, and some evangelicals. The grass-roots movement is potentially the strongest since the days of  farm worker leader Cesar Chavez, observers say.  <BR> <B>...In recent months, 57 ministers, priests, and rabbis</B> held a news conference and ran a full-page newspaper ad urging a New Jersey dairy to settle a strike. They also criticized its wage offer as too low to support a family. In another instance, 300 clergy sent a letter to the Case Farms poultry plant in Morganton, N.C., urging management to improve working conditions. Those clergy plan to spread their campaign to help all of the nation's 240,000 poultry-processing employees. <BR> <B>...Labor-clergy coalitions have formed in New York City, Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, Boston</B>, Detroit, and Chicago, <I>The New York Times </I>reported. This spring, 40 clerics formed the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice, an umbrella group based in Chicago.  <BR> <B>...Religious leaders say they are trying to address a key ethical issue:</B> the growing gap between America's haves and have-nots. Clergy also are concerned that corporate downsizing and stagnant wages are weakening families. In practical terms, churches, synagogues, and mosques &quot;are on the front lines in dealing with crises&quot; such as hunger and poverty when families need help, said Kim Bobo of the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice. Many people don't understand the ramifications of worker-justice issues, she told the <I>Christian Science Monitor</I>.  <BR> <B>...Business leaders are unhappy with the labor-clergy alliance</B>, <I>The Times</I> said. The leaders contend that clergy do not really belong in the disputes, don't understand the complexities of  the issues, and often fail to listen to management's side of the argument. <BR> <B>...Clergy involvement in labor issues has a long tradition</B>. In the 19th century, clergy joined in struggles against 12-hour work days, child labor, and the right to strike. In recent decades, many clergy were preoccupied with the civil right movement and stayed away from unions because of a perceived corruption there and the belief that workers were thriving. <BR>      </font></p>

U.S. citizen arrested as spy in North Korea</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A U.S. citizen who apparently was working as a Christian missionary in China has been arrested in North Korea and charged with spying</B>. U.S. officials in Seoul, South Korea, are trying to arrange the release of Evan Carl Hunzike, 26, who was arrested  Aug. 24. South Korea and the United States deny that Hunzike is a spy. The charge carries a possible death penalty. <BR> <B>...Hunzike was arrested on an island in the Amnok river, called the Yalu in Chinese</B>, bordering China and North Korea. His cousin -- identified only by his family name of Yun -- told reporters that Hunzike is not capable of acting as a spy. <BR> <B>...White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States is seeking more information</B> through the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, North Korea. Washington and Pyongyang have not had diplomatic ties since the Korean War, but the two sides have had liaison offices in each other's capitals since 1994. Hunzike, whose mother is South Korean, is a native of Alaska and attended college in Yakima, Wash.,  his cousin said. <BR> <B>...Tensions between the two Koreas have come close to the breaking point recently</B>. Observers said North Korea's aim in raising the spy charges may be to engage Washington in talks and divert attention from a recent ill-fated submarine incursion. <BR> <B>...South Korea accused North Korea of  sending spies aboard the submarine on  Sept. 18.</B> Twenty-two North Koreans who got off  the submarine have been killed or found dead and one has been captured. North Korea said the submarine was on a training mission when engine trouble caused it to drift south.    </font></p>
