&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 01, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Christian missionaries in the Philippines are staying up all night to reach homeless children</B> living on the streets, Mission Network News reported. The missionaries find children gathered in parks and under bridges or stadiums, said Marvin Graves of Action International Ministries. There are 70,000 homeless children in Manila alone, Graves said. The ministry also is sponsoring vocational training in automotive repair, leathercraft, and welding. <P> <B>A hundred foreigners are trapped in a Roman Catholic cathedral in Bukavu, Zaire</B>, as fighting rages, news reports said. Nationalities of the foreigners was unknown, but reporters in Kamanyola, Zaire, this week said Belgian and Italian missionaries were still in Bukavu. <P>    <P> <B>The Sacred Heart League of Walls Miss., the Catholic charity that produced the Hollywood movie</B> <I>Spitfire Grill</I>, says it will follow up on its success by making another movie. <I>Spitfire Grill</I>, a feature-length film, depicts a woman's struggle for a new start after her release from prison. It has earned the Sacred Heart League $3 million, which it will spend on a new school. The League is part of  a mission that supports grammar schools and social service programs in an impoverished area. It also is building a low-income housing development. <P> <B>The Church of Scientology has complained to the United Nations about discrimination in Germany</B>. The Los Angeles-based church said the German state of Bavaria is prohibiting Scientologists from holding public-sector jobs, breaking Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights. Bavaria requires state employees to reveal ties to the church. It also requires private companies with state contracts in sensitive fields to promise not to use the methods of Scientology, news reports said. <BR><B>...Leaders of Germany's 16 regional states are considering putting the Church of  Scientology under surveillance</B> by the government. German leaders deny that the Church of Scientology is a church.  <P> <B>President Clinton wants public school teachers</B> to have the right to travel to parochial schools to teach federally financed remedial classes. Clinton joined New York City officials in asking the court to reverse a 1985 ruling barring the practice. In New York City, students from religious schools are transported to public schools for the special instruction or are given the remedial help in mobile vans parked near parochial schools. <P> <B>The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A) has appealed to religious and political leaders in Iran</B> to investigate the death of a 35-year-old Assemblies of God pastor in September, the PCUSA News Service reported. The body of Mohammed Bagher Yousefi was found hanging from a tree near Ghaem-Shahr. He is the seventh Christian pastor to be killed since the Islamic revolution in 1979. <BR><B>...Iranian Christians in the United States say they are frustrated </B>over their inability to pinpoint blame for the deaths. Some believe paramilitary groups with ties to high government officials are to blame, while others say vigilantes organized by local Islamic hardliners caused the killings, the news service said. Another theory is that the deaths are the work of groups attempting to embarrass the Rafsanjani government. <P> <B>The Episcopal Church has been implicated in an alleged sex scandal</B> involving Long Island priests. An article in December's <I>Penthouse</I> magazine contains allegations of sexual misconduct against Long Island priest William Lloyd Andries and other unnamed priests. The article claims they are involved in &quot;bizarre&quot; homosexual rituals, Episcopal News Service said. Howard Williams, the Episcopal Church's coordinator for children's ministries, who was mentioned in the article, has already agreed to resign. <P> <B>Another meteorite from Mars contains evidence for possible life on that planet</B>, British scientists said. American geologists who found possibly life-related compounds in a Mars rock in August said the British research confirms their findings. <BR><B>...The latest discovery will encourage more testing of meteorites</B> from Mars and increase interest in spacecraft missions to the planet, news reports said. The first such mission is scheduled for launching next Wednesday.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 31, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Homosexual and lesbian students interrupted a speech by Christian Coalition head Ralph Reed Wednesday at Harvard University</B>, UPI reported. As Reed began to talk, half the audience held up signs denouncing the coalition's criticism of homosexuality. Same-sex couples among the protesters embraced and kissed until police removed them from the hall. &quot;Get used to us, because we're going to be here a long, long time,&quot; Reed told the protesters before they were removed. During a question-and-answer session after Reed's talk, a black woman who identified herself as a lesbian told Reed he is &quot;a geeky, post-modern Christian racist in an expensive suit.&quot; <P> <B>Zaire and Rwanda moved closer to war with a third day of artillery and machine gun exchanges</B> across the border, news reports said. Tutsi fighters attacked near the eastern Zairean city of Goma today, sending refugees fleeing. Earlier this week, fighting in eastern Zaire claimed the life of Roman Catholic Archbishop Christophe Munzihirwa Mwene Ngabo. The Vatican said he was killed during an attack on the eastern town of Bukavu. <BR><B>...Volunteers in Bukavu were burying bodies,</B> the Red Cross said. The last foreign aid workers fled from Bukavu on Tuesday, reports said. Missionaries there had stayed in their homes fearing being shot, a Burundian priest told Reuters news service. <P> <B>Ten thousand Ugandan Christians have joined an AIDS campaign</B>. The Good Samaritan Volunteers, who are members of the Anglican diocese of  Namirembe, will provide food, clothing, and medical care for the sick and promote awareness of AIDS prevention and care. The three-year project will cost $300,000. <P> <B>..More than 100,000 Ugandans have died from AIDS-related diseases s</B>ince the virus first was identified there in 1982. An estimated 1.5 million Ugandans out of the total population of 20 million are HIV-positive, news reports said. Uganda is among the worst-affected countries in Africa. <BR><B>...Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Orthodox Church leaders in Uganda have been criticized</B> for opposing condom use to stop the spread of the disease. The churches have said use of condoms encourages promiscuity. <P> <B>The Orthodox Patriarch in Serbia has blessed the Reconciliation Walk.</B> &quot;In view of the previously icy relationship between the Orthodox church and evangelicals,&quot; the Patriarch's action was very surprising, according to DAWN FridayFax. Walkers are following the path of the Crusades, from Cologne to Jerusalem, as they apologize to Muslims and Jews.  <BR><B>...The walkers said the Patriarch emphasized &quot;brotherhood and unity</B> between Orthodox believers and Western Christians.&quot; Another Orthodox bishop apologized for &quot;the bitterness&quot; he had felt toward Western Christians, a walk organizer said. <P> <B>A Messianic Christian fellowship has begun in Stuttgart, Germany</B>, according to the German magazine <I>idea</I>. Attendance at the fellowship ranges from 70-150; most are Russian-speaking Jews who believe that Jesus Christ is the Messiah promised by the Old Testament. Other visitors are Christian friends of Judaism.  <P> <B>In Brazil, more than 1,000 people made decisions to become Christians during a crusade this month led by American evangelist Sammy Tippit</B>. A total of 39,000 people attended four days of crusade meetings in Sao Luiz. Tippit also spoke at a True Love Waits conference, where 600 teen-agers committed themselves to sexual abstinence before marriage.   <P> <B>The Methodist church in Brazil has been growing 33% annually since 1992</B>, according to DAWN FridayFax. Most new churches are planted by laypeople and are &quot;charismatically oriented,&quot; according to Paulo Lockmann, Rio de Janeiro's Methodist bishop. <P> <B>A South African judge sentenced the former head of a police assassination squad</B> to two life sentences and 200 years in jail. Eugene de Kock's actions were cruel, calculated, and without sympathy for his victims, <I>The New York Times</I> said. De Kock is the highest-ranking official to be convicted of apartheid-era crimes. His conviction could encourage others to cooperate with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is uncovering details of thousands of apartheid-era murders, disappearances, and tortures. The commission is considering amnesty for those who testify. <P> <B>A church has begun among a Vietnamese tribe where witch doctors once ruled.</B> Because of a Vietnamese Christian named May, the church was established among the very poor Churu Indian Tribe, according to Mission Network News. God miraculously destroyed that power, many Churu became Christians, and now 300 attend church in the village, May said. The new believers are difficult to disciple because there is no Churu Bible. <P> <B>Jerry Falwell denied Wednesday that he has become a Southern Baptist,</B> saying news reports had misinterpreted his position. The Lynchburg, Va., pastor described himself as &quot;a Baptist in the South,&quot; but still independent of the Southern Baptist Convention. Falwell contributed funds to a conservative group of Virginia Baptists, indirectly affiliating his congregation, Thomas Road Baptist Church, with the SBC. A Falwell spokesman characterized the contribution as friendly cooperation rather than a sign of membership. <P> <B>Five of Britain's best preachers held a preach-off in front of a full congregation and a panel of judges</B> at Southwark Cathedral in London Wednesday. William Anderson, a 65-year-old Roman Catholic from Aberdeen, Scotland, won the Preacher of the Year Award. Finalists for the award, organized by the College of Preachers, were chosen through unannounced visits to churches.    </font></p>

In California, three recent polls show 56%-58% of voters favor Proposition 215, the initiative that would legalize medical use of marijuana for those suffering from AIDS, cancer, glaucoma &quot;or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.&quot; Users would not need a written prescription, but only a &quot;doctor's recommendation,&quot; <I>The New York Times</I> reported. <BR><B>...Public sympathy has been generated by people such as Judith Cushner, a former cancer sufferer</B>, who described on television how marijuana helped her through the pain of chemotherapy. &quot;Some day, you may need it,&quot; she warned. <BR><B>...Advocates of tough drug policies say they fear a massive loosening of control over marijuana use</B> in the nation's most populous state. The real motive of Proposition 215 is eventual legalization of marijuana, they say. Other states are watching California, which sometimes sets the pace on legislative issues. <BR><B>...Illegal drug use among teens has been increasing sharply</B>, several recent studies found. The National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education found that the number of children in grades six through 12 using illicit drugs every day increased 147% in the past decade, <I>Family Issues Alert</I> said.  <P> <B>An Idaho county is arresting pregnant teen-agers and charging them with fornication</B>. The Gem County prosecuting attorney has used the state's 1921 law prohibiting sex between unmarried people to arrest 10 girls and their boyfriends, <I>The New York Times</I> reported.  <BR><B>...Teens usually plead guilty and are placed on probation for three years</B>. During that time, they are required to attend parenting classes, finish high school, stay employed, and not use drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes. <BR><B>...Gem County officials say they are trying to restore the social stigma</B> to teen-age pregnancy. Attempts elsewhere around the nation include more sex education, easier access to contraceptives, and tougher enforcement of statutory rape laws. In Orange county, Calif., some fathers face the choice of marriage or jail. <P> <B>A mother of  six was convicted Tuesday in Williamsport, Pa., of helping her stepson's 13-year-old girlfriend get an abortion</B>. Rose Marie Hartford was charged with driving the girl to New York -- without her parents' knowledge -- for an abortion in 1995. Pennsylvania has a strict parental-notification law. Hartford faces up to seven years in prison. The stepson, Michael Kilmer, 19, is serving a one-year to 30-month prison sentence for statutory rape. <P> <B>A South African Catholic priest who was an anti-apartheid activist said he was tortured</B>. Smangaliso Mkhatshwa told a committee in Johannesburg that military intelligence officers handcuffed, blindfolded, interrogated, and tortured him, Ecumenical News International reported. Mkhatshwa said he was stripped naked and forced to stand with a bag over his head for long periods without sleep. <P> <B>Interest in religion among Russians has grown in the five years since the collapse of the Soviet Union</B>, a poll confirmed. The All-Russian Public Opinion Research Centre found that 37% of respondents are not religious, as compared to 53% in 1991. Eight percent declined to comment as compared to 15.3% in 1991, Ecumenical News International reported. <BR><B>...Most of the growth is in the Orthodox Church.</B> Fifty percent of the country's adult population say they are Orthodox, compared to 30% in 1991. However, only an estimated 5% to 10% of them attend church. Four percent are Islamic, compared to 1% in 1991. The number of Roman Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and Buddhists are in the tenths of a percent, the poll found. <P> <B>Christian ministries have started in about half the areas of Calcutta, India</B>, according to the missions publication <I>Advance</I>. Twelve of  Calcutta's 65 people-groups have new churches, prayer groups number 650, and in five years 50 film and literature teams will be at work. <BR><B>...In Madras, India, the number of churches has grown from 700 in 1989 to 2,000 today</B>, <I>Advance</I> said. At least 400 new fellowships have been started in the last two years. <P> <B>Jerry Falwell has become a Southern Baptist</B>. Falwell and his Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Va., have been unaligned, although friendly with the Southern Baptist Convention. Falwell's move is a sign of support for the SBC's conservative policies, achieved after years of theological conflict in the 16 million-member denomination. <BR><B>...Falwell's affiliation follows the formation last month of the Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia</B>, a state group that mirrors the theological views of the SBC. The SBCV broke away from the 173-year-old Baptist General Association of Virginia, charging its leaders with liberalism. <P> <B>Half a million gospels of John will be sent to Mexico as part of a saturation evangelism</B> effort by the evangelical churches of Guadalajara, according to Bibles for Mexico. Thousands of New Testaments and Bible study courses also will be sent, according to Mission Network News. Members of evangelical churches in Guadalajara plan a door-to-door witnessing campaign.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 29, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Africa's worst humanitarian disaster looms in Zaire</B> as more than half a million people roam the bush in search of food, water, and safety. Aid workers say 400,000 refugees packed Mugunga camp, near Goma, and an additional 200,000 are arriving.  <BR><B>...Mugunga has become the largest refugee camp in the world</B>, U.N. spokesperson Sylvana Foa said. The camp is built on a volcanic rock, so adding more latrines and water &quot;is a nightmare,&quot; she said. There also is a shortage of food and water. <BR><B>...The conflict between Zaire, Rwanda, and Burundi</B> threatens to engulf the entire Great Lakes region of central Africa. Zaire is trying to evict the Banyamulenge Tutsis, and accuses Tutsi regimes in neighboring Rwanda and Burundi of helping the Banyamulenge. <P> <B>A group of Kenyan Christians made a four-week visit to Richmond, Va.,</B> on behalf of their forefathers, who sold their relatives to slavetraders, YWAM International News Digest said. Members of the group prayed at the site of slave auctions and visited the urban poor. The group said it was motivated by the story of Joseph, whose brothers sold him into slavery. They prayed that God would exchange the bad for good, as He did with Joseph. <P>   <P> <B>Cuban President Fidel Castro met with visiting Vatican Foreign Minister Jean Louis Tauran</B> on Monday. Tauran's five-day visit reflects improved relations between Cuba and the Roman Catholic Church and could be a prelude to a meeting between Castro and Pope John Paul, news reports said. <P> <B>Approximately 5,000 people are working long hours in a Lancaster, Pa., warehouse</B> Oct. 21-Nov. 2 to assemble thousands of packages containing school supplies. The items will be delivered to Russian children in orphanages, schools, and hospitals. Each package also contains a 90-day supply of vitamins, a Bible storybook, and a copy of evangelist Josh McDowell's book <I>More Than A Carpenter</I>. The effort, called Operation Carelift '97, is sponsored by Dallas-based Josh McDowell Ministry.   <P> <B>Jews in Dresden, Germany, plan to build a $13 million synagogue</B> near the site of one destroyed by the Nazis on &quot;Kristallnacht,&quot; the infamous night of broken glass. On Nov. 9, 1938, the Nazis looted 7,000 Jewish shops and burned hundreds of synagogues across Germany. About 130 Jews live in Dresden, compared with 6,000 at the start of the 1930s. <P> <B>Russia is giving the Holocaust Museum in Washington copies of documents</B> containing details of  Nazi atrocities. The 15,000 pages of documents detail Soviet investigations and trials of German defendants and their collaborators from 1946 to 1949. Also, there are excerpts from Soviet field reports of  atrocities behind German lines. <P> <B>Christians are giving Jews in Ukraine free bus rides</B> from their hometowns to airports where they can fly to Israel. In five years, the Exobus Project has helped 19,000 Jews leave Ukraine for Israel. Twenty full-time volunteers from 11 nations are active in the ministry.  <P> <B>  </B> <P> <B>Church leaders in Australia are trying to calm an increasingly heated national argument over race</B> and immigration. Asian-Australians are being spat on as they walk down the street, and one town mayor called children of inter-racial marriages &quot;mongrels,&quot; news reports said. Sydney's Anglican Archbishop Harry Goodhew urged political leaders to defuse and resolve the situation. Asians make up 4.5% of the 18 million population and constitute a quarter of the 100,000 migrants each year.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 25, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Thirty-eight percent of American adults and 43% of registered voters say they are &quot;born-again&quot; Christians</B>, according to a Barna Research Group poll. Evangelicals make up 8% of the population and 7% of  registered voters, the poll found. Barna defined &quot;born-again&quot; Christians as those who say they have made a personal commitment to Christ and believe they will go to heaven. Evangelicals were described as those who say they are born again and believe the Bible is totally accurate. Those who described themselves as theological liberals make up 39% of the population, Barna said. <P> <B>In Romania, 438 people made professions of faith in Christ this summer</B> during evangelistic efforts by eight American Protestants. Organized by evangelist Mark Puckett of Houston, the Americans led several crusades and visited homes in the Filipesti region. Puckett, who has visited the Eastern European nation several times, said Protestants there are becoming more assertive in evangelism, but are concerned about a Parliamentiary proposal to make the Orthodox Church the state denomination. That would nullify the rights of some three million evangelicals, he said. <P> <B>The Roman Catholic Church is beginning a special effort to reach out to Generation X.</B> The National Conference of Catholic Bishops in the United States suggested that parishes telephone, write, or e-mail young adults to invite them to church. Parishes should start small groups for young adults, preach on issues of importance to them, and encourage older adults to mentor younger members, the bishops said. <P> <B>Poland has liberalized its abortion law.  </B>The lower house of  Parliament passed a bill Thursday overthrowing a Senate veto, and ex-communist President Aleksander Kwasniewski said he will sign it into law. The new law will allow women to have an abortion before the 12th week if they face financial or personal problems. Women considering abortion must receive counseling and take three days for reflection. Under Poland's old law, abortion was legal only if a pregnancy threatened a woman's life or health, resulted from rape or incest, or resulted in a hopelessly damaged fetus. <P> <B>The Barbie doll has competition in Iran</B>. The Islamic republic's new &quot;Sarah&quot; doll doesn't flaunt her figure in a Western-style bathing suit, but wears modest, flowing robes. Iran's version of  &quot;Ken&quot; is &quot;Dara,&quot; her brother, who wears the garb of an Islamic cleric. Although importing Barbie dolls is prohibited, dozens of Tehran shops sell Barbies -- some in swimsuits -- news reports said. <P> <B>Jets flown by the radical Islamic Taleban pounded mud homes in a village</B> north of  Kabul Thursday, killing at least 20 people, including children. The Taleban also demonstrated their loathing of alcohol by using a battle tank to crush hundreds of cans of beer, sending streams of  foam over bystanders, news reports said. <P> <B>An AIDS-awareness program that focuses on Jesus Christ as the only answer</B> to the deadly disease is opening doors for the gospel in South Africa. Vern Tisdalle, an Assemblies of  God missionary, said Soweto officials asked him to present the program to students and government workers, the denomination said. Many listened intently and wanted to learn more about the gospel. &quot;Non-Christian leadership is begging for answers to a human tragedy for which they have no answers,&quot; Tisdalle said.  <P> <B>Harold Hughes, who left the U.S. Senate to devote himself to religious work</B> and help alcoholics, died at age 74. Hughes was a former truck driver who overcame alcoholism to become a three-term Democratic governor and U.S. senator. <P> <B>North Korea said Carl Hunziker, an American jailed on spying charges</B>, is not a Christian missionary as he claims because he does not know hymns, the Ten Commandments, or how to pray. North Korea said Hunziker's situation would worsen if the United States does not apologize. The State Department says Hunziker, 26, is not a spy, but inadvertently strayed into North Korea while on a visit to China. <BR><B>...Hunziker has signed a confession</B>, Reuters news service said. If convicted, he faces a possible death sentence. <P> <B>A judge upheld a New York City zoning law barring sex shops from certain areas</B>. Restricting peep shows, nude bars, and other adult businesses to some sections of the city does not hinder free speech, said Justice Marylin Diamond of the state Supreme Court. The restrictions could close down 85% of the city's X-rated businesses, lawyers said. The limitations bar sex shops from within 500 feet of schools, day care centers, houses of worship, and new residential areas.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 24, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>In a massive ecumenical project, half a million copies of the Danish-language New Testament were given away</B> in Denmark. Some 98% of the households in Copenhagen received copies, with only a few people refusing the gift, according to the Danish Bible Society. <BR><B>...Local Danish churches cooperated to distribute the Bibles. </B>The effort was preceeded<B> </B>by an advertising campaign on television, billboards, and in newspapers. Copenhagen's 38,000 foreign-language households were offered a free copy of the New Testament in their own language. Each household also received a list of 600 follow-up events such as Christian concerts and Bible-study groups.   <BR><B>...The Swedish Bible Society plans a similar New Testament distribution</B> in Stockholm in 1998. <P> <B>Christian relief groups are aiding refugees fleeing to Rwanda from eastern Zaire</B>, an area that is close to war. Workers from groups such as World Relief and the Free Methodist Church are in Rwandan refugee camps providing food, soap, medicine, and blankets for the Banyamulenge refugees, most of whom are widows and orphans. The Banyamulenge are ethnic Tutsis who arrived in eastern Zaire up to 200 years ago from what is now Rwanda and Burundi. They have been the target of ethnic persecution and denied Zairian citizenship. On Oct. 8, Zaire ordered all the Banyamulenge to leave Zaire or face a war.   <BR><B>...The refugees are completely without resources</B>, said Eraste Iyamuremye of the Free Methodist Church in Rwanda. Children are showing signs of malnutrition, said Jean Gakwandi, World Relief's program manager in Rwanda. Some refugees &quot;are of Free Methodist background and are godly people,&quot; Gakwandi added. &quot;Most of their time is spent in prayer and worship.&quot; <P> <B>A Vatican emissary visited Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) denominational headquarters</B> in Louisville seeking ecumenical ties, Presbyterian News Service said. Monsignor John Radano, an American from New Jersey who serves on the Vatican's Council for Promoting Christian Unity, signaled the Roman Catholic Church's &quot;irrevocable commitment&quot; to the ecumenical movement. He told PNS that the Vatican's relationship with international ecumenical bodies such as the World Council of Churches is &quot;a good partnership.&quot; <BR><B>...The Vatican has been having constructive dialogue on matters of liturgy and doctrine</B>, such as justification by faith, Radano said. Social issues have been more problematic, since various churches are far apart on issues such as birth control, abortion, and the role of women in the church, he said. <P> <B>A prayerwalk took place this month in Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Oman</B>, Mission Network News said. In addition to praying, participants worshipped and held seminars with evangelical Christians. About 10,000 evangelicals reportedly live in the region.  <P> <B>Feminists for Life, a nonsectarian Washington, D.C.-based group,</B> is targeting college campuses. The group's campaign includes counseling, campus-reform proposals, and advertisements challenging students to &quot;Question Abortion.&quot; <A HREF= http://www.serve.com/fem4life > Feminists for Life </A> is located at 733 15th St., NW, Suite 1100, Washington, DC  20005. The phone number is (202) 737-3352. <P> <B>The U.S. government allowed Catholic Relief Services to send one planeload of food, clothing, and medicine to Cuba</B> for victims of  Hurricane Lili. The hurricane hit central and western Cuba last week, destroying 5,000 homes and damaging 78,000. Winds also damaged crops, power lines, and communications. <BR><B>...Supporters of the State Department's ban on direct flights</B> from the United States to Cuba say they fear humanitarian supplies will be stolen by the government of Fidel Castro. But a U.S. Catholic group said it would monitor the shipment to ensure the supplies get to the needy. <P> <B>Five hundred women marched in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif,</B> chanting slogans against the country's Taliban rulers and waving a giant banner reading &quot;Men and Women Need Each Other,&quot; Reuter news service said. The radical Islamic Taliban control two-thirds of Afghanistan, but do not control Mazar-e-Sharif, where the rally was held at Balkh University. Men and women study together at the school, a practice opposed by the Taliban.    </font></p>

In conformity with strict Muslim law, barriers must be present between men and women at weddings, parties, and picnics. The law bans men and women from sitting facing each other, buses must display a verse from the Koran asking Muslims to not look at members of the opposite sex, and streets must be well-lighted so couples can't go into the darkness. Similar laws were enacted in Iran after the 1979 revolution. <BR><B>...Khartoum's new law does not require women to wear a veil</B>, but women working in restaurants cannot wear jewelry or perfume. Women cannot sit near the driver on buses, and must be accompanied by a male relative while shopping at night. Female athletes and women performing folk dances cannot wear tight-fitting clothes. Men also must cover their bodies, and males must be separated from females in private schools, as they are in public schools. <BR><B>...Christians in the southern part of the country are exempt</B> from the new laws. The government is considering extending the exemption to Christians in the Muslim-majority north. <P> <B>A play about the 1956 deaths of Jim Elliot and four other missionaries</B> -- and the subsequent opening of the gospel to the tribe responsible for their murders -- is being performed in 20 U.S. cities. <I>Dayuma</I>, which opened Sept. 19-21 in Tulsa, Okla., is being staged through cooperation among Wycliffe Bible Translators, Youth With a Mission, and Impact Productions. <P> <B>Some 10,000 North American youngsters in 39 states and Canada collected a ton of school supplies</B> for children in Ukraine. The supplies were gathered at Vacation Bible School programs this summer through a project organized by Slavic Gospel Association. Local pastors in Ukraine will distribute the supplies to public school children. SGA also is giving away 12 tons of shoes and clothing in Ukraine, the Loves Park-Ill.-based group said.  <P> <B>For the first time, Britain's Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Jewish leaders joined to speak out</B> for a more caring and moral society. Anglican leader George Carey called for parenting classes and more emphasis on the teaching of right and wrong in schools. Jonathan Sacks, Britain's chief rabbi, called for establishment of a royal commission on the question of teaching citizenship. <BR><B>...At least a million children are abused in Britain each year</B>, a commission said in a report published today. The National Commission of Inquiry into the Prevention of Child Abuse said abuse was preventable but a &quot;culture change&quot; was needed. <P> <B>An interracial and interdenominational mixture of 2,000 Australian Christians</B> prayed and worshipped in shifts for 72 hours Oct. 10-13 in the Great Hall of  the Parliament House Canberra. Every denomination and many tribal groups were represented at the Praise Corroboree, according to Worldwide Photos. At the event, aboriginal elders and pastors stood with arms outstretched as they laid hands on and blessed Prime Minister John Howard. <P> <B>A Baptist church in a poor section of  Los Angeles has planted or helped support 62 churches</B>, Baptist Press said. El Camino Truth and Life Baptist Church, a congregation of fewer than 200 people, has a modest budget, staff, and facilities. But its pastor, Aquiles Acosta, has a &quot;deep calling of God&quot; to spread the gospel as widely as possible, he says. Many leaders of churches planted by El Camino are congregants Acosta trained in a three-year Bible course he developed. The Bible Institute covers two years of theology and one year of homiletics and hermeneutics. Hour-long tests are given weekly. <BR><B>...In addition to churches planted in Los Angeles,</B> El Camino assists congregations in Mexico, Argentina and Greece. The church holds worship on Friday nights in lieu of Sunday evening services so members can preach and lead worship at fledgling churches. <P> <B>The United Methodist Church is planning a weekly 30-minute cable television show</B> offering a religious perspective on the news. <I>News Odyssey</I> is scheduled to begin on the Odyssey Channel, formerly Faith and Values Network, next year. <P> <B>Churches could jeopardize their tax-exempt status by handing out Christian Coalition voter guides,</B> according to Americans United for Separation of Church and State. The group said the guides imply support for Republican candidates and distort the positions of  Democrats. Some 45 million guides are scheduled to be distributed to 120,000 churches in the next two weeks. <BR><B>...&quot;If a church distributes a partisan voter guide, it will constitute improper political activity by the church</B>,&quot; according to a memo prepared for Americans United by tax lawyers Milton Cerny and Albert Lauber, Jr. The tax-exempt Christian Coalition is being sued by the Federal Election Commission for allegedly making illegal contributions to former President George Bush and other Republicans through the voter guides and for conducting voter drives for certain candidates. <BR><B>...Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed dismissed charges</B> that distribution of the guide is political activity not permitted of tax-exempt organizations. Reed also told the National Press Club that the coalition has asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser held at a Buddhist temple in Los Angeles last April that was attended by Vice President Al Gore. The event raised $140,000.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 22, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Doctors in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand have been using dead patients to practice </B>emergency procedures, according to a study reported in the Medical Journal of Australia. The corpses are being used without the knowledge or consent of relatives, the study said. <BR><B>...Some 46% of hospitals in Australia and New Zealand accredited to train doctors in emergency medicine</B> had used the bodies of newly deceased  patients in teaching resuscitation skills, and none had obtained consent from relatives, the study said. About three-quarters of respondents said the practice was ethical. There are no laws to stop the practice on patients whose deaths did not have to be reported to the coroner, <I>The Sydney Morning Herald</I> reported. <BR><B>...Previous studies had found up to 40% of  hospitals in the United States engaged in the practice,</B>  although objections had been raised on religious, ethical, and legal grounds, according to the researchers, Corinne Ginifer and Anne-Maree Kelly of the Western Hospital in Melbourne. <P> <B>More than 100 lepers who converted to Christianity during their treatment</B> at a Christian clinic in Niger have become full-time missionaries, the missions group SIM said. Many former patients of the Danja Health Center in southern Niger are preaching while working in the mission hospital, Mission Network News said. <P> <B>The U.S. Postal Service is issuing a stamp to commemorate Hanukah</B>, the Jewish festival of lights. It is the first in a series of  &quot;holiday celebration&quot; stamps that will include secular and religious holidays. For 34 years, Christmas was the only religious holiday recognized by a stamp. Jewish groups have lobbied for a Hanukah stamp for many years, <I>The Washington Post</I> reported. <BR><B>...Critics say that, since it is impossible to issue a stamp for every religious group in America</B>, issuing any stamps with religious themes implies preferential treatment for certain faiths and violates the principle of the separation of church and state. <P> <B>Orthodox Jews in Israel will surf on a kosher Internet</B>. Observant Jews have produced a kosher version of the Internet that shelters them from anything offensive, <I>The Jerusalem Post</I> said. Five young religious men examine the content of web pages and decide whether to include them in Toranet, administered by an Israeli company of the same name. Subscribers will see no photographs of women; they will be able to correspond by e-mail with Orthodox rabbis. <P> <B>American Indian creationism, which rejects the theory of evolution</B> in favor of the Native American explanations of  human origins, is gaining political clout, <I>The New York Times</I> reported. <BR><B>...Indian tribes have blocked archeological research</B> on hundreds of prehistoric skeletons. Under the federal repatriation act of 1990, negotiation between tribes and federal agencies -- rather than the law -- determine who gets ancestral bones. Most Indians say they do not need science to study their origins because their creation accounts tell them where they came from, <I>The Times</I> said.  <P> <B>The Mobile Bible Institute is bringing a seminary to Christians in rural Honduras</B>, according to Mission Network News. The institute has two locations and 105 students. A third program is beginning in El Salvador. The Institute is run by Birmingham, Ala.-based World Reach. <P> <B>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats pledged to put the Church of Scientology under surveillance</B> and bar its members from public service, Reuters news service said. A resolution passed by the political party called for a national information network to track the group's activities and to warn Germans against joining it. Germany has refused to register The Church of Scientology as a religion, instead considering it a tyrannical, manipulative money-maker. The U.S.-based Church of Scientology compared the Christian Democrats' resolution to the Nazis' strictures against the Jews. <P> <B>Bob Dole failed to mobilize evangelical Christians in his final debate with President Clinton Oct. 16</B>, religious conservatives said. The GOP candidate did not answer adequately when asked how he would return the country to godly principles, and did not explain why he described homosexual rights as &quot;special rights,&quot; Baptist Press quoted several prominent conservatives as saying. Dole also failed to mention partial-birth abortion, even though he said he would do so.<BR>  <P> <B>Some Christians are fair-weather friends and hypocrites</B>, Tammy Fae Messner says. In her new book, <I>Tammy: Telling It My Way </I>(Villard), the former wife of Jim Bakker says many friends did not stand by the couple during their troubles after the collapse of the PTL ministry. She told <I>USA Today</I> that &quot;Christians don't walk their talk.&quot; Pastors, in particular, &quot;can be the most judgmental people in the world.&quot; Messner said she has &quot;grown up a lot&quot; and no longer is &quot;looking at the world through rose-colored glasses.&quot; <P> <B>Many Orthodox Christians in Romania are too poor to die</B>. Traditional Orthodox burials -- including lavish feats -- average $900 in the nation, where the average monthly salary is $100, according to the daily <I>Cronica Romana</I> of Bucharest. <P> <B>Sweden's national social insurance has allowed a lesbian policewoman to take paternity leave</B>, Reuters news service said. The woman's partner gave birth last winter to a daughter, conceived by artificial insemination. <P> <B>A drunken driver was given 16 years in prison for causing the death of  a baby</B> delivered prematurely after a June 15 crash. Frank Flores Cuellar was found guilty of manslaughter in Corpus Christi, Texas. Krystal Zuniga was delivered shortly after the accident, then died a few hours later. <BR><B>...The case tested whether a Texas citizen can be held criminally liable for harming an unborn child.</B> Several states have laws allowing the relatives of unborn children to sue in criminal cases, The Associated Press said. Similar legislation has been proposed in Texas.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 21, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>About 150 women have induced abortions with RU-486 during trials at six clinics and medical centers</B> around the United States, the Associated Press said. In September, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said RU-486 is safe and effective when used under a doctor's supervision. But the FDA withheld final approval of the drug until it receives more information about how it would be manufactured and labeled. If approved, RU-486 could become available at hospital clinics and doctors' offices across America next summer. <BR><B>...About 2,000 women around the United States are being enrolled in the trials, reports said. </B>RU-486 has been used by 200,000 European women since 1988. Potential side effects include uterine bleeding, nausea, vomiting, and weakness. <P> <B>The U.S. Justice Department is continuing to review possible violations of law by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan</B>, <I>The Washington Times</I> reported. Farrakhan has made two trips to Libya, which is under U.S. embargoes for supporting  terrorism. Farrakhan was given a $1 billion gift for the Nation of Islam and a $250,000 human rights award, but has not yet accepted them because of a U.S. Treasury Department ban, which he said he would challenge in U.S. courts. Farrakhan also has visited Cuba, Iran, Iraq, and Sudan, which are alleged to be sponsors of international terrorism. <BR><B>...Reno declined to comment on Farrakhan's recent public remark</B> calling the United States the &quot;great Satan&quot; and predicting the fall of the country. <P> <B>A group of  Muslims and Christians are trying to mend relations after last week's rioting in East Java,</B> news reports said. The religious leaders pledged to clean up and rebuild churches burned and damaged during rioting in Situbondo. Abdurrahman Wahid, chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, said he would lead the effort. Situbondo authorities said Protestants and Catholics could use a government building for their services. <P> <B>A ministry to youths who write graffiti may have to end</B>. Noel Buchanan has spent eight years on Melbourne, Australia, trains as a Christian missionary among hardcore graffiti writers, reports said. His ministry, called Godspeek Ulturnativart, addresses social and spiritual problems of youth who damage other people's property. Many graffiti writers come from suburbs and attend private schools, said Buchanan, who has spoken to numerous school and community groups. The Christian church has expressed concern for youth, but has not given practical support to his ministry, Buchanan said. <P> <B>Sweet Haven Holy Church of God  in Carrollton, Va., gives money back to parishioners, </B>the Associated Press said. After services, Bishop Nathaniel Johnson passes out play money. Those who find Johnson's initials on the back win $10-$100. To be eligible, winners must be present for the two-hour service. Johnson said some people come for the money, but notes that attendance has doubled to about 100 people since the giveaway started three years ago. <P> <B>A Satanic cult is being blamed for the burning of a church in Belarus on Sunday</B>. Orthodox Church Patriarch Filaret said writing on the walls of the Zaslavl church proclaimed &quot;Death to Christians,&quot; the Associated Press said. Last summer, slogans praising Satan were painted on walls of the Orthodox cathedral in Minsk. <P> <B>Dolores Street Baptist Church in San Francisco said it will distribute marijuana to ease the pain </B>of people suffering from AIDS, cancer, and other illnesses, Associated Baptist Press said. The former Southern Baptist congregation is one of two San Francisco churches offering the drug. Pastor Doug Donley said the church believes that &quot;God's law of healing is more important than state laws banning the use of marijuana as medicine.&quot; A church statement said restricting marijuana's medicinal use &quot;is to deny Christ's call to offer healing to all of God's people in need.&quot; The church left the Southern Baptist Convention in 1993 to protest the denomination's expulsion of two churches over homosexuality.  <P> <B>A new limestone cross and steeple were lifted into place Sunday at an Oklahoma City, Okla., cathedral</B> damaged by the 1995 bombing at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral is located two blocks away from the blast. The bomb tore away a third of the church's cross, broke stained glass windows, and pushed brick walls several inches. The congregation worships next door, but  hopes to be back in the sanctuary by Easter and have the cathedral fully restored by Christmas 1998. <P> <B>A veneer of acrylic paint will no longer be considered clothing for revelers at this year's raunchy Fantasy Fest</B> in Key West, Fla. Police, who expect 50,000 people to attend the annual event, also say they will confine public drinking to a 10-block &quot;fantasy zone.&quot;  <BR><B>...This year's bizarre festival began Oct. 18 with nine days of costumes and parties, </B>and ends in a parade on the Saturday before Halloween. Conservative Christians oppose the festival, which began in 1979, in part because it has been known as a homosexual event featuring public nudity. <BR><B>...The Monroe County Christian Coalition also is opposing </B>Fantasy Fest, calling it a week of &quot;depravity and debauchery,&quot; news reports said. Key West officials are trying to calm the revelry without alienating tourists, reports said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 18, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...Some residents of Anne Arundel County, Md., near Washington, D.C</B>., recently urged county officials to stop Riverdale Baptist Church from constructing a 1,500-seat church with parking for 700 cars on a 2.5 acre site. The president of the local civic association told <I>The Post</I> that a lot of residents &quot;feel the church is just too enormous.&quot; <P> <B>A 16-year-old Walpole, N.H., boy cycled 1,000 miles to raise money for churches burned by arsonists</B> and to help his youth group. Steffan Legasse, a member of St. John's Episcopal Church, pedaled to Georgia, where he met people whose churches had burned. &quot;I wanted to do something to help,&quot; he said. <BR><B>...Legasse, whose father runs a public relations firm in nearby Keene, N.H., created a press kit</B> detailing his motivations for making the bike trek. It included copies of press reports and photos taken during his journey. The high school junior also constructed a <A HREF= http://www.legasse.com/bikehikes/update.html>site on the Internet</A> offering updates on his trip, a letter outlining his goals, and a pledge form. A list of personal and corporate sponsors, information about news reports on his bike trip, and a Quicktime movie of  his trek also are planned. His goal is to raise $10,000 and split it between his youth group and the churches. <P> <B>A mission for the poor in Biloxi, Miss., run by the United Church of Christ,  lost a two-year property battle with a gambling casino</B>. After 74 years of ministry, Back Bay Mission must close, making way for a $120-million casino on what used to be the mission's property, the denomination said. <BR><B>...Back Bay's fight to keep its property involved the purpose and definition of &quot;church.&quot;</B> The mission argued that a church is defined by the actions people of faith take, but a court ruled that a church is a building where people worship each Sunday, the UCC said. In December 1995, Biloxi seized some of Back Bay's land under eminent domain, demolishing four buildings and part of a church building to make way for wider roads to accommodate casino traffic. Back Bay dropped its appeal this August, agreeing to sell the land. The mission sold its land to a Nevada company for $2.2 million and will move about 10 blocks from its current site.  <P> <B>Campus Crusade for Christ will dedicate its new, 285-acre, $48 million home</B> Saturday in Orlando, Fla. The property will be headquarters for the World Center for Discipleship and Evangelism of Campus Crusade, the nation's largest ministry. Ground is to be broken soon and the center could be open by 1998, the ministry said.  <P> <B>The United Church of Christ plans to build a 7-story, 93-room hotel in downtown Cleveland, Ohio</B>. The UCC, whose church offices are in Cleveland, said it considers the hotel a means of reducing costs for church-related meetings. The hotel also will produce income for the denomination. The UCC will use funds currently invested elsewhere to build the hotel. <P> <B>The Christian Coalition began distributing $750,000 to rebuild churches burned by arsonists</B>. The money has come from hundreds of predominantly white evangelical congregations. Coalition leader Ralph Reed said the Virginia Beach, Va.-based group will hold a gathering of pastors and community activists to discuss rebuilding black communities by strengthening their churches. Participants at the Congress on Racial Recovery, planned for April, will issue a document that will contain &quot;a new civil rights agenda,&quot; Reed said. <BR><B>...The National Council of Churches, which is working with the U.S. Catholic Conference</B>, several Jewish groups, and others, has raised $9.5 million in cash, pledges, and donations of materials. It also has begun distributing the money. <P> <B>An estimated 12,000 people from across the United States came to a farm in Conyers, Ga., Oct. 13</B> to hear what they believe is a message from the Virgin Mary. Nancy Fowler delivers the messages annually on Oct. 13, when Mary appears before her in a room, she says. This year, Mary said people must amend their ways because they offend God, Fowler said. <P> <B>A drunken driver was convicted of manslaughter for killing a baby born prematurely</B> after the man crashed into the baby's mother's car. Frank Flores Cuellar was convicted Oct. 17 in Corpus Christi, Texas, in the death of Krystal Zuniga. The girl was born with brain damage a month and a half premature and died two days later. It is one of the first cases in Texas to test whether someone can be held criminally liable for harming an unborn child. <P> <B>Evidence pointing to the fact that prayer has a positive effect on healing is impressing an increasing number of physicians</B>, according to Dr. Larry Dossey, an author and former chief of staff at a Dallas hospital. Dossey's new book,<I> Prayer Is Good Medicine </I>(HarperSanFrancisco), explores common questions about prayer's healing benefits. <BR><B>...Recent studies underscore prayer's benefits in healing and illustrate faith's positive impact on life</B>, Dossey told <I>USA Today</I>. A study reported by the National Institute for Health Care Research showed that faith is important for a happy life among senior citizens. <P> <B>The Clinton-Gore campaign revised an advertisement airing on Christian stations</B> in response to pressure from homosexual-rights groups, Religion News Service said. The 60-second spot, airing on 70 stations, praised Clinton for signing the Defense of Marriage Act. The President &quot;has fought for our values,&quot; the original ad said. RNS said the ad offended the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the Human Rights Campaign, and ACT-UP, who asked for it to be removed.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 17, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...The central figure at the rally was again Louis Farrakhan</B>, leader of the Nation of Islam. He spoke for nearly three hours, discussing the need for nations to atone for violence and human rights violations. Farrakhan criticized the world's powerful nations for fueling the arms race, and chided the &quot;weak  nations&quot; that buy arms. Farrakhan denounced the United States as the world's leading weapons exporter and Saudi Arabia as the biggest buyer. &quot;I have to tell it, whether the kings like it or not,&quot; he said. Farrakhan also warned of an impending &quot;great cataclysmic war.&quot; <BR><B>...&quot;The U.S. government entered into a conspiracy to kill the (black) male</B> and spare the female,&quot; Farrakhan said. &quot;We are dying worse than they are in Northern Ireland, worse than they are in the Palestinian revolt, worse than they are in Bosnia. Black people are dying in the streets of America and no congressman speaks out against it. No president speaks out against it. No governor speaks out against it. They don't give a damn about what happens to the black man because they want you dead.&quot; <BR><B>...Speaking from a bulletproof glass case,</B> with thousands of New York City police officers nearby, Farrakhan called for lifting sanctions against Iraq and Cuba, and demanded recognition of the Palestinians' right to sovereignty. <P> <B>A white South African church leader formally apologized to Desmond Tutu for his silence concerning racial injustice</B>. &quot;We must confess that we backed away at crucial moments from letting a clear testimony against injustices being heard in the land,&quot; a Dutch Reformed Church leader said. He was representing the Stellenbosch group of congregations, which are part of the Dutch Reformed Church and have been derided as &quot;the apartheid regime at prayer,&quot; Ecumenical News International said.  <BR><B>...Tutu, the retired Anglican archbishop, has traveled throughout South Africa</B> since May hearing accounts from victims and their families of atrocities committed by former security police during the apartheid era. The confession was the first made formally to the panel, which Tutu calls the Truth Commission. After the Dutch Reformed leader spoke, Tutu walked up to him and other theologians in the delegation and embraced them, news reports said. <BR><B>...Many atrocities have come to light during the public hearings</B>, ENS said. In Paarl, an anti-apartheid activist said police stripped him and placed a snake around his neck, then left him in the room with a dog that repeatedly bit him. Another witness said her husband was found decapitated in a field; security police showed her the severed head. <P> <B>About 425 supporters of  a &quot;fidelity and chastity&quot; amendment to the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) constitution</B> met to plan their strategy last month in Chicago. If the amendment is approved, church officers would have to repent of any &quot;self-acknowledged practice&quot; that the denomination calls sin. The PCUSA's constitution, or Book of Order, describes acceptable sexual behavior as &quot;fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman, or chastity in singleness.&quot;  <BR><B>...A number of speakers called for less recrimination against others and more self-examination.</B> &quot;If we come to these debates with a hardness of heart that does not communicate the caring of Christ, we will lose,&quot; said speaker Roberta Hestenes, who chaired the General Assembly's Committee on Ordination and Human Sexuality, which drafted the amendment. Finger-pointing has characterized the denomination's debate about sexuality for the past 20 years, Presbyterian News Service said. <BR><B>...Voting on the amendment will be completed by next year's General Assembly</B> in Syracuse, N.Y. A majority of the presbyteries must ratify the amendment for it to become part of the church's constitution. Observers say the vote is too close to call. <P> <B>China has warned Hong Kong residents it will place limits on their freedom of expression</B> after the territory reverts to Beijing's rule on July 1, 1997, Reuters news service said. Liberties will remain, but within the law, the Chinese government said. China has promised to give Hong Kong, a British territory, political freedom for 50 years after the transfer of power, and has said it will not to change its capitalist system. <BR><B>...Foreign Minister Qian Qichen</B>, interviewed by the <I>Asian Wall Street Journal</I>, hinted that Hong Kong would no longer be able to mark the anniversary of Beijing's June 4, 1989, crackdown on student-led protests. That stirred an outcry in Hong Kong. <BR><B>...Christians in Argentina are organizing to pledge a million hours of prayer</B> on behalf of  Hong Kong Christians, Mission Network News said.  <P> <B>When four Christian workers in Shanxi Province, China, were arrested</B> for their faith, they led 26 fellow prisoners to Christ, according to Christian Aid Mission. <P> <B>The former New England treasurer of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, pleaded innocent</B> to charges he embezzled $800,000. Prosecutors say George A. Patrick, 55, used the denomination's money to send his children to college and pay for vacation homes, news reports said. <P> <B>South Africa's Roman Catholic Church denied an accusation that it paid for a woman to have an abortion</B> after she had<B> </B>sex with a priest, Reuters news reports said. The woman, who was not identified, told a parliamentary hearing on abortion that a bishop paid her hospital bills when she needed the abortion. The bishop denied he paid for the abortion, but &quot;spoke to her only after she had told him that she had the abortion,&quot; a church spokesman said. The National Assembly will vote Oct. 29 on whether to relax South Africa's abortion law, one of the world's strictest. <P> <B>A man who killed two elderly nuns and attacked two others</B> with a statue of the Virgin Mary in a Waterville, Maine, convent<B> </B>has been declared legally insane. Mark Bechard, 38, was declared not criminally responsible and will be sent to a mental institution rather than prison, news reports said. Bechard has been in and out of mental institutions 25 times, The Associated Press said. <P> <B>Indonesian authorities arrested 40 people for last week's arson attacks</B> by thousands of Muslims on churches around Situbondo in East Java, <I>the Jakarta Post</I> said. Authorities suspect the attacks were premeditated, Reuters said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 16, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...Women have a right to be left alone at abortion clinics,</B> defenders of  the injunction say. They argue that the injunction prevents interference with access to health care and disruptions to public safety. The injunction stops a campaign of  &quot;illegal harassment, intimidation, obstruction and trespass&quot; at abortion clinics, Lucinda Finley, representing the Pro-Choice Network of Western New York, told the court. <BR><B>...In practical terms, the injunction amounts to a ban on free speech anywhere near the clinics</B>, said Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice, who is representing abortion protesters Paul Schenck and Dwight Saunders. If someone orders a protester to back away, free speech stops -- even before a word is said, Sekulow told the court. A ruling in the case is expected next year. <P> <B>An ad campaign airing on some Christian radio stations claims President Clinton </B>opposes some late-term abortions. The ad, sponsored by Clinton's campaign, also notes that the President signed legislation to prevent homosexual marriages, <I>The Washington Post</I> said. <P> <B>Hundreds of people stood and prayed to become a Christian in south central Siberia</B> when the drama Heaven's Gates and Hell's Flames was performed, missionary Scott Holmes told Mission Network News. Churches in the area now are seeking to follow up on the new believers and incorporate them into congregations, he said. <P> <B>An increasing number of Muslim families in the United States are educating their children in private Islamic schools</B>. In the Washington, D.C., area, the demand for Islamic schooling far outstrips the supply, and consequently some Muslim families are educating their children at home,<I> The Washington Post</I> said. Many Muslim parents say values their children are exposed to in public schools conflict with the strict morality of Islam. The parents say their children have encountered prejudice and anti-Muslim stereotypes. <P> <B>A Scottish man who killed his suffering brother won't be sent to prison</B>. Paul Brady, 37, killed his brother James, 40, at his request last year. Brady gave his brother -- who suffered from Huntington's chorea, a debilitating, degenerative disease -- an overdose of medicine and put a pillow over his head, news reports said. The judge at Brady's trial, Lord Macfadyen, said he feared that the lenient sentence would send an unintended message, but was sure Brady's action, though unlawful, was done in compassion. <P> <B>A fight between two children in Egypt led to an all-out machine-gun battle</B> between their Coptic Christian and Muslim families, according to <I>The Strait Times</I> of Singapore. Twenty people were wounded in the incident, which took place in a village south of Cario, police said. <P> <B>The interests of children should come first when considering reproductive and genetic technologies</B>, evangelicals in Canada say. &quot;Children are not commodities,&quot; said Janet Epp Buckingham, spokesman for the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, commenting on proposed legislation. She applauded the legislation's ban on several controversial practices, including retrieval of sperm or eggs from cadavers or fetuses, and commercial surrogate arrangements. Buckingham also said research should be prohibited on embryos. <P> <B>A former headhunter who was the chief of a group of vicious warriors has become a Christian</B>. According to the DAWN FridayFax newsletter, the chief is a member of the Was tribe of the southeast Asian nation of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. The tribe asked for 100 Bibles and wanted to meet Christian missionaries. The missionaries reported that when the chief became a Christian, he was baptized by immersion, then ducked under the water one hundred times -- once for every head he had hunted. Afterward, he began promoting the <I>Jesus</I> film. <BR><B>...The<I> Jesus</I> film also has had an impact on Romania</B>. Campus Crusade for Christ, which produces and distributes the film about the life of Christ, said 185 new churches have been planted in Romania since 1991 as a result of showings of the film. More than a million people have seen the film in 16,076 showings, Campus Crusade said. <P> <B>Violence on network television declined somewhat last year from the previous TV season</B>, the UCLA Television Violence Report found. The study said a few series, some made-for-TV movies, and some of the theatrical features on television were more violent than was appropriate. Several popular children's shows feature &quot;sinister combat violence,&quot; the group said. The study analyzes whether the violence is appropriate and whether consequences are addressed, UPI reported. <P> <B>Carl Hunziker, an American citizen being held in North Korea on espionage charges</B>, met with a Swedish diplomat and denied having confessed to spying, the U.S. State Department said. Hunziker is reported to be in good health and has not been mistreated, Reuters news service said. North Korea's news agency, however, said Hunziker has been proven to be a spy and will have to pay the consequences. Hunziker was in the Far East to act as a Christian missionary, reports said.     </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 15, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>... &quot;If anyone thinks New Age is a passing fad, the evidence shows this is not so,&quot;</B> said Philip Johnson, founder of the New Age Mission, a Christian ministry. &quot;The swing towards postmodern, New Age, neo-pagan and Buddhist style spiritualities in Australia is much stronger than overseas. There has been a vast spiritual vacuum here which the church has not effectively touched.&quot; <P> <B>Attacks  such as those on churches in East Java last week could happen again</B>, the leader of Indonesia's largest Islamic organization said. Abdurrahman Wahid, head of the 30-million person Nahdlatul Ulama, told Reuters that intolerance was the cause of  attacks on the 25 churches. Church groups in Surabaya say six people were killed, including a pastor, his wife and two children, who were trapped in a burning church. The mob was angered by a court hearing in a blasphemy case. Photos of the aftermath of the attacks can be found <A HREF= http://fica.visi.com/GerejaSBY/persecution.html>here.</A> <BR><B>...Some Islamic leaders promote a type of nationalism that derides other religions, Wahid said</B>. Instead, religious leaders should promote mutual understanding and &quot;be at home with pluralism in religion.&quot; <P> <B>Crowds packed an 8,000-seat hockey arena in Central Ontario, Canada</B>, Oct. 5-9 for a crusade led by Franklin Graham. Others watched from a 2,000-seat overflow arena equipped with a closed-circuit giant screen television. Some 1,200 people made decisions for Christ during the crusade, held in the city of Kitchener. Christian musicians Ricky Skaggs, Paul Overstreet, Dennis Agajanian, Crystal Lewis, and the Maranatha! Praise Band opened each evening's events. Special meetings were held for children and teenagers. Graham, the son of Billy Graham, also addressed 250 students and faculty at the University of Waterloo. <P> <B>Wycliffe Bible Translators is working on a new Scripture version in Persian</B>. It will present the gospel in the language of 100 million people, the group said. <P> <B>Homeless people in Moscow are being sent away against their will. </B> So far, the city has deported 6,000 homeless people, who have been detained for up to 30 days and loaded onto trains bound for villages where they grew up or were residents,<I> The New York Times</I> said. Police estimate 20,000 people live on the streets in Moscow, a city of  8 million. <P> <B>Pygmies and the Water People in Zaire reportedly are responding in large numbers to the gospel</B>. Churches are being formed in the equatorial forests through evangelistic efforts of families living near the rivers, AD2000 Unreached Peoples News said. Two missionaries in the Bosuka region have seen 7,000 formerly unreached people become Christians.  Near Kivu, 44 new churches have evangelists, deacons, and choirs.  <P> <B>Ecumenical organizations risk becoming service agencies</B> indistinguishable from other non-governmental organizations, an American ecumenist said. &quot;If they are not careful, the National Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches will be trapped into becoming secular service agencies, seeking funding from government and secular agencies,&quot; said Paul A. Crow, Jr., president of the Council for Christian Unity, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Crow, a member of the WCC Central Committee, said the WCC must resist the idea that the church must be &quot;servants of human causes.&quot; <P> <B>Republican vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp said he thinks Louis Farrakhan's message</B> of self-help last year at the Million Man March was &quot;wonderful.&quot; In a <I>Boston Globe</I> interview Sept. 8, Kemp said he does not endorse all of Farrakhan's teachings, but described the march as a &quot;celebration of responsible fatherhood, individual initiative...and getting an opportunity to be the man that God meant you to be.&quot;    <P> <B>A federal judge refused to throw out a defamation lawsuit filed by four professors</B> at Louisiana College, a Baptist school.  Judge Tom Yeager of Louisiana's 9th District Court in Alexandria ruled Sept. 24 that the defendants had a right to sue Leon Hyatt of Pineville and the theologically conservative group Hyatt led. The group wrote and mailed 21 letters criticizing the professors. <BR><B>...Judge Yeager said the criticisms were not protected by the First Amendment</B> since the dispute did not involve internal church matters, Associated Baptist Press said. Hyatt and the other defendants were acting on their own, without authority from an ecclesiastical body, the judge said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 14, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...&quot;Large numbers of Americans are biblical illiterates</B> and lack awareness and understanding of their own religious traditions and the central doctrines of their faith,&quot; the researchers said. &quot;We want the fruits of faith, but less of the obligations.&quot;  <P> <B>Social well-being in the United States has fallen to its lowest point in 25 years</B>, researchers at Fordham University say. Children and young people are suffering the most, according to their study of government statistics on 16 social problems<I>, The 1996 Index of Social Health</I>. Child abuse, teen-age suicide, drug abuse and the high school dropout rate all worsened in 1994, the report found.  <BR><B>...The report is &quot;a warning,&quot;</B> Marc Miringoff, director of the Institute for Innovation in Social Policy at the Fordham Graduate Center in Tarrytown, N.Y., told<I> The New York Times</I>. Miringoff noted pessimism among youth, isolation, less sense of community, and a teen suicide rate 95% higher than in 1970. <P> <B>A reported 500,000 people have seen the <I>Jesus </I>film in churches and homes in China</B> <B>in the last 12 months, </B>Mission Network News said. One fellowship of 30 Christians grew to 500 in a few years through weekly showings of the video drama, which depicts the life of  Christ. The film, distributed by Campus Crusade for Christ, is available in nine of China's primary languages. <P> <B>Vatican officials are debating if and when to disclose</B> what is causing Pope John Paul's left hand to tremble violently, Reuters news service said. The Vatican has not denied media reports that the Pope, 76, who underwent a successful appendectomy last week, may be suffering from Parkinson's disease or a related neurological disorder. The Pope also sometimes suffers from rigidity of the facial muscles and a slow, stooped gait, reports said; these also can be symptoms of Parkinson's or a related disorder. <P> <B>A cult leader in Taiwan admitted he swindled up to $3 billion</B> from thousands of followers, news reports said. &quot;Please don't believe in me any more,&quot; said Sung Chi-li, who had claimed he was the reincarnation of a &quot;cosmic body&quot; and had supernatural healing powers. During nine hours of  questioning by police, Sung was unable to display special powers. He tearfully confessed to defrauding his followers -- who had worshipped him like a god -- of land, cars, and cash, police said. <BR><B>...Sung attracted followings in Taiwan and China by using photographs that appeared to show him with a  halo</B> or levitating above the Great Wall, Reuters news service said.  A cult photographer arrested in the scam admitted that he faked the pictures. <P> <B>More than a million men have attended 20 Promise Keepers men's conferences so far this summer, </B>the organization said.<B> </B>Two conferences remain: at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium Oct. 18-19 and Texas Stadium in Irving Oct. 25-26. <BR><B>...Some 52,436 men attended the PK convention at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis</B>, Tenn., last weekend. Speakers included Christian author John Trent, psychologist Gary Oliver, and Prison Fellowship chairman Charles Colson. Teen-ager Shon Stewart, who has cerebral palsy, sang <I>These Things to Be True</I> from his wheelchair. The song focuses on the relationship between a father and son. <P> <B>The tragedy of  burned churches has resulted in an unprecedented spirit of cooperation</B> among blacks and whites of various religions, according to a leader of the rebuilding effort. Arsonists meant the fires  to harm, but God means them for good, according to Sullivan Robinson, deputy director of the Washington-based Congress of National Black Churches. She spoke to the National Rebuilding Initiative, a public and private effort to reconstruct dozens of burned churches. <P> <B>Abdurrahman Wahid, leader of Indonesia's largest Moslem group, apologized</B> and asked for forgiveness for an attack by a mob of  10,000 Muslims on churches in East Java last week, Reuters news service said. Reports said five people died in the rioting, and 21 Christian churches, five Catholic elementary schools, and one Christian orphanage were burned. The riot broke out after a court hearing in a case of alleged  blasphemy against Islam. Wahid said members of the group he leads, the 30-million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, probably were responsible for the destruction.  <P> <B>The government of Egypt placed 608 private mosques under state control</B> as part of a campaign to prevent Muslim extremists from using them to promote their ideas, UPI reported. The decree, which involved 21 mosques, is part of a plan to bring all mosques under control of  the Ministry of Religious Endowments. A proposed law would restrict the building of mosques by individuals and bar preachers not licensed by the government from serving at mosques. <P> <B>Armstrong Williams, an African-American conservative radio commentator</B>, will leave his call-in show with Salem Radio Network, a Christian network, to join the secular division of USA Radio Network, <I>The Washington Post</I> said.     </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 11, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...Indonesia, which is 85% Muslim, invaded and annexed</B> the predominantly Roman Catholic island of East Timor in 1975 after the withdrawal of Portuguese authorities four months earlier. Human rights groups say a third of East Timor's population, or about 200,000 people, died during the invasion, subsequent fighting, or famine. <BR><B>...Indonesian troops killed dozens of pro-independence East Timorese protesters in 1991</B>. Bishop Belo prompted the government to investigate the killings, which led to the dismissal of two generals and the imprisonment of several army officers.  <BR><B>...The Noble Peace Prize committee said it hoped to focus world attention</B> on East Timor's struggle for independence, which it said is in danger of being forgotten by the rest of the world. The island is located midway between the Indonesian island of Java and the northwestern tip of Australia. Indonesia expressed &quot;regret&quot; at the awards. <P> <B>JAKARTA, Indonesia</B> - Five people died inside a church when a mob burned nine churches, four Christian schools, and a convent in the Indonesian town of Situbondo, on Java island, Reuters news service said. Some 2,000-3,000 people rioted during the incident. The crowd also destroyed a court building and cars, police said. Several arrests reportedly have been made. <BR><B>...The riot apparently broke out after a court hearing in a case of alleged blasphemy against Islam</B>, a journalist in Situbondo said. Several thousand people outside the court demanded that the accused be sentenced immediately or handed over to the crowd. Indonesia is overwhelmingly Moslem, but the state preaches religious tolerance and recognizes five main religions. Situbondo is 100 miles east of  Surabaya, where attacks on churches were reported in June. <P> <B>SLOVAKIA</B> -  For the first time, family issues will be aired from an evangelical perspective on national radio. Beginning this weekend, short, weekly programs will use material from Focus On the Family, Mission Network News said. Listeners who respond to the programs will receive printed information.  <P> <B>WASHINGTON, D.C</B>. - A commission being created to study gambling's impact on society is in danger of  stacking the deck in favor of appointees tied to the industry, two lawmakers said. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), who sponsored the bill that created the commission, and Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), said they were concerned by reports that two pro-gambling appointments to the commission were being considered. One member of the 9-person committee already has been appointed: James Dobson, president of Focus on the Family. <P> <B>KABUL, Afghanistan</B> - The two-week old administration of the radical Islamic Taleban is looking precarious, reports said. Its militia has faced guerrilla assaults near the Afghan capital by commanders and units loyal to former military chief Ahmad Rashid Masood. Also, foes to the north have formed a military alliance. <BR><B>...Moderate elements in the Taleban may welcome talks</B> with rivals, Reuter news service said. But more hard-line Taleban leaders may want to push through their Jihad (Holy War) to its conclusion. <P> <B>NORTH KOREA</B> - Evan Carl Hunziker, an American being detained in North Korea on espionage charges, will get a visit today from a Swedish envoy acting in the interest of the U.S. government, the State Department said. Hunziker, who went to the Far East as an unaffiliated Christian missionary, was arrested on Aug. 24 after crossing from China. <P> <B>JERUSALEM, Israel</B>  - Jerusalem police were on alert Friday against possible renewed Israeli-Palestinian violence. They feared that Jewish extremists would try to attack the Temple Mount before a small, new mosque opens there next week near the controversial archeological tunnel operated by Israel. Violence erupted two weeks ago when Israel opened an exit to the tunnel; 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis were killed. <P> <B>NEW DELHI, India</B> - McDonald's is opening its first restaurant in India next week. In keeping with Hindu religious practices, the restaurant's Maharaja Mac sandwich will contain no beef, company officials said. Hindus, who make up 80% of  India's 940 million people, do not eat beef, and many are vegetarians. The Maharaja Mac will contain mutton, eaten by Hindus and Muslims. <P> <B>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla</B>. -- Astronaut Shannon Lucid, who returned Sept. 26 after an 188-day space flight, is the daughter of Baptist missionaries. Asked if her spiritual life has been changed by the flight -- the longest by an American -- she said, &quot;I like to think that it was the same as it was basically my whole life. The location of  where you are, to me, doesn't necessarily affect your spiritual life.&quot;    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 10, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...The proposed Concordat of Agreement </B>provides that the future ordinations of bishops will involve ordaining bishops from both churches. As a result, all Lutheran bishops eventually would be incorporated into the &quot;historic succession,&quot; or continuity in the ordination of bishops from the early church to the present. Sixteenth century Lutheran reformers stressed the functions of ordained ministry over tradition. <BR><B>...At the meeting, Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey drew parallels</B> between the Concordat and a new agreement between the Anglicans and Lutherans in northern Europe. &quot;Will the mission of the church be stronger for unity?  My unhesitating answer is yes, it will be,&quot; Carey said. <P> <B>A small mosque is opening in the Israeli Parliament building in Jerusalem</B>. It will serve as a prayer room for the Arab members of the Knesset, the <I>Jerusalem Post</I> said. The prayer room is furnished with prayer mats, a closet for prayer books, and a picture of the Aksa Mosque on Temple Mount. <P> <B>New Jersey is using finger scanning to identify welfare applicants &quot;double dipping&quot; by applying in more than one location</B> under false names and counterfeit ID cards, Intercessors for America said. New York will cooperate with New Jersey, using computerization of the fingerprint patterns of welfare recipients, IFA said. <BR><B>...Other states are expected to use finger scanning</B>, building a nationwide network, IFA said. Credit cards and check-out counters soon will use fingerprint scanning.    <P> <B>Oct. 11 is National Coming Out of Homosexuality Day</B> -- organized to help people who want to leave the homosexual lifestyle -- as well as National Coming Out Day, organized to affirm the homosexual lifestyle. Conservatives also have formed the group Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays. <P> <B>Christian pen pals in North America are being sought to disciple new believers in Russia</B>. Dan Wooding of ASSIST Ministries said he has received 76,000 letters from new believers in the former Soviet Union -- many of  them young people -- who are looking for pen pals in the West. For a packet of information, contact ASSIST at P. O. Box 2126, Garden Grove, CA 92842-2126. Call (800) 222-6441 to be enrolled over the phone. <P> <B>Several hundred Christians from a variety of denominations</B> marched through downtown Sydney, Australia, Oct. 7 carry placards in support of marriages between a male and female. The marchers denounced what they described as subtle actions taking place in society to undermine marriage. Moves are being made in the Uniting Church and the government to downgrade marriage as society has always known it, the marchers said. The march closed with speeches, prayer, and hymn-singing. <P> <B>More than 2,000 Muslim texts now are available on CD-ROM</B> as part of a project to make 5,000 of the most significant Islamic works available on computer, <I>The Christian Science Monitor</I> said. Eventually, they will put these volumes on the Internet for worldwide use. <BR><B>...Muslim scholars in Qom, Iran, are entering the information onto computers.</B> Each volume takes 500 hours to input and edit. Most are interpretations of the Koran and its laws that have been analyzed and passed down by Muslim scholars since Islam began in the 7th century. Recently, scholars from the Vatican visited Qom to examine references to Christianity in Islamic texts. <P> <B>The picture emerging from arrests in the arson attacks on African-American churches in the South is complex</B>, <I>The Washington Post</I> said. More than a third of the suspects charged in recent months in the attacks are black, according to federal law enforcement officials. In the past 21 months, two-thirds of those arrested for burning black churches have been white and 34% African American. The figures suggest that while race is factor in some cases, other motivations are involved, <I>The Post </I>said. <BR><B>...The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights said Wednesday,</B> after issuing its report on black church fires in the South, that it would formulate a grass-roots plan to bridge the divide. It plans to meet with Southern governors and political leaders before implementing community-based programs promoting racial tolerance. <P>   <P> <B>Lutheran theologian Walter Wangerin, Jr., has developed a liturgy to be used after a divorce</B>. The church uses rituals for other situations involving grief, but &quot;at the death of a marriage, the church remains distant and mute -- baffled perhaps since it presumes sin in divorce.&quot; But &quot;forgiveness is our stock in trade,&quot; he said. <P> <B>A 10-minute break is church time for Sunday workers at a tire-manufacturing plant</B> in Roanoke, Va.  About 60 of the 200 employees at Yokohama Tire Corp. gather in the lobby to recite the Lord's Prayer and listen to a lay preacher speak. Then employees join hands and pray for fellow workers who have been laid off or become ill. After a quick exchange of handshakes and some hugs, they return to the production floor. It's better than a cup of coffee, and it makes it feel like the Lord's day even though its a work day, employees say.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 09, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>In a step toward overcoming years of  hostility, Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Protestant churches in the former Soviet Union agreed</B> to establish a committee that will promote cooperation and understanding among themselves. The action was taken at a conference in Minsk, Belarus, by delegates from 21 churches and Christian organizations, including Orthodox, Roman Catholics, Baptists, Old Believers (Old Ritualists), Lutherans, and Seventh-day Adventists, Ecumenical News International said. <BR><B>...The Russian Orthodox Church has condemned proselytizing</B> by foreign Protestant missionaries who arrived in the former Soviet Union after the political changes of the late 1980s. A final document at the Minsk conference condemned conversions from one church to another through ways &quot;contradicting the spirit of Christian love and violating the freedom of a human person.&quot; <P> <B>A United Methodist clergyman who has been ordained as a Catholic priest wants to remain part of both churches</B>. W. Paul Jones describes himself as having a &quot;Protestant mind and a Catholic heart,&quot; and says he feels called to bring both churches &quot;the neglected wealth preserved by the other,&quot; United Methodist News Service said. &quot;May my intent to live faithfully in both of these traditions be a small ecumenical step toward the day when we shall affirm that we truly are one in Christ,&quot; Jones said . A decision on his status as a UMC elder is expected to be made late this month. <BR><B>...&quot;Something deep happened within me, a coming home&quot; during a visit to a Trappist monastery</B> in 1972, Jones said. He described the experience as Wesleyan spirituality that the UMC has lost. For three years, Jones spent six months each year teaching theology at UMC-related Saint Paul School of Theology in Kansas City and six months living in a Trappist monastery. <P> <B>Hot-dog evangelism is working in Utica, N.Y.</B>  Foursquare Church member Mark Bolo opened a mobile  stand on a busy street and began giving away hot dogs, drinks, and Christian tracks to passers-by, Discipling A Whole Nation said. <BR><B>...He saw results quickly</B>. One man said he didn't know what he could feed his two daughters. Although he did not often pray, he sat in his car and quietly said, &quot;God, what can I do?&quot; At the next light, the man came across Bolo. In another instance, a bar owner asked Bolo to set up his stand in front of his business, then opened his games room and dance floor for Christian concerts.  <BR><B>...About 40 people have shown an interest in becoming Christians as a result of the stand</B>, Bolo said. Because someone &quot;gave the people something instead of talking, hearts were opened,&quot; he said. <P> <B>Christian conservatives are irked that the presidential candidates are downplaying issues such as abortion,</B> homosexual rights, and attacks on religious liberty. Conservatives are likely to feel disenfranchised by both parties if such issues are avoided, as they were in the Oct. 6 presidential debate, said Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council. If the issues are not raised in the next debate, &quot;Bill Clinton is going to be re-elected,&quot; he said.  <BR><B>...Pat Robertson said he is anticipating &quot;a blowout this November&quot;</B> for Clinton, news reports said. Robertson made the comment Monday during the <I>700 Club</I> program. <P> <B>Lawyers for John G. Bennett, Jr., will argue in court that Bennett was insane while he ran the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy</B>, Religion News Service reported. Bennett was indicted Sept. 27 on 82 counts of defrauding charities, including a number of  evangelical Christian groups. Prosecutors say New Era ran a ponzi scheme that was the biggest charity fraud in U.S. history.  Bennett has pleaded not guilty to charges of wire, mail, and bank fraud. <P> <B>Americans who gave money to charities last year contributed an average of 10% more than in 1993</B>, a Gallup Organization study found. But more households gave nothing, according to the study. <BR><B>...The average contribution per household was $1,017. </B> Some 69% said their households gave to charity last year, down from 73% who gave in 1993 and the lowest rate in eight years. <BR><B>...An increasing number of  Americans distrust the way charities use their money.</B> The percentage who disagreed with the statement &quot;most charitable organizations are honest and ethical in their use of funds&quot; has increased from 20% in 1990 to 31% this year. <P> <B>Evan Carl Hunziker, the American arrested in North Korea and accused  of spying</B>, was &quot;only trying to preach the Gospel&quot; after converting to Christianity last year, his father said. Hunziker, 26, got into alcohol, drugs and trouble with the law, but sobered up and converted to Christianity during a 90-day jail term for drunken driving in Alaska, said Edwin Hunziker of Parkland, Wash. He said his son went to Korea in August intending to get a job and preach Christianity. <BR><B>...Evan &quot;doesn't know the first thing about spying, unless somebody in South Korea educated him</B> right quick in a month,&quot; Hunziker said. Evan's mother said her son was divorced from a South Korean woman three years ago, speaks Korean well, and intended to become a missionary, <I>The Seattle Times</I> said. <BR><B>...North Korean diplomats said Hunziker is being charged with illegal entry and espionage</B>, which could result in a death sentence. An American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hunziker had not worked for the U.S. government as a spy or in any other capacity. <P> <B>Some 250 middle- and high school students marched out of classes</B> in Elizabethtown, N.J., Tuesday. They were protesting their school's resolution that says &quot;pro-homosexual concepts on sex and family will never be tolerated or accepted in this school.&quot; The students also objected to the resolution's description of the two-parent family as &quot;the norm,&quot; news reports said. Some of the students carried signs, and more than a dozen parents attended the demonstration in support. <P> <B>Large parts of Britain probably won't have enough full-time Church of  England parish priests by the end of the century.</B>  According to a report, a recruitment crisis in the church forecasts that by 2001 the number of  full-time male clergy will have fallen by 1,175 to 8,007, <I>The London Times</I> said. There will be about 9,000 full-time men and women priests in the Church by the turn of the century, leaving at least 4,000 parishes without a minister.     </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 08, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...Conference leaders urged Christian organizations to work together</B> in evangelism and church-planting. The conference, organized by the Serbian Evangelical Alliance, received positive coverage in television and print media, according to Lazar Stojsic, president of the Evangelical Alliance in Belgrade. <P> <B>Swiss Christians are praying for revival in their country,</B> where many people have fallen away from the church and are indifferent to it. Some 450 leaders of various denominations met in Zurich Sept. 21 to confess their failings and exhort one another to use creative means for evangelism. The gathering was the largest such meeting of its kind, its organizers, FocuSuisse, told Discipling A Whole Nation. <BR><B>...About 120 Christians from various churches held a prayer march along the German border</B> near Schaffhausen on Sept. 15. The aim was to repent for Switzerland's return of fleeing Jews to Nazi Germany and for Swiss arrogance towards Germany, said Ramu Bhalla, leader of a Schaffhausen church. <P> <B>Pope John Paul had his appendix removed Tuesday in an operation that found no sign of a tumor</B> or other serious illness, chief surgeon Francesco Crucitti said. The Pope, 76, showed no ill effects from the  50-minute operation, which did not reveal a recurrence of the tumor Crucitti removed from the Pope's colon in 1992. <P> <B>The AIDS epidemic is more diverse in the United States than previously thought</B>, scientists say. In 1994, doctors in France found a hard-to-diagnose strain of AIDS, named Group O.<B> </B>The strain previously was found only in West Africa. Last July, doctors found the first Group O case in the United States. Then last month, scientists found a second U.S. resident infected with this rare type of HIV. Researchers also are investigating several New York City residents who have signs of still another AIDS strain never before seen in the United States. <BR><B>...Researchers are looking for AIDS strains worldwide to ensure that tests for HIV are able to detect</B> every type of the disease. HIV tests are designed to detect a region's most common strains, but doctors are increasingly concerned whether they will catch rare, foreign strains. <P> <B>The Catholic Diocese of St. Petersburg, Fla., is reeling from a series of revelations</B> involving marriage, homosexuality, and sexual abuse, United Press International said. The incidents involve three priests: <BR><B>...On Oct. 1, Patrick Clarke, 62, pastor of Espiritu Santu parish</B> in Safety Harbor, had married a woman in a civil ceremony in 1981. Clarke is on paid leave, UPI said. <BR><B>...The next day, it was revealed that Rev. Simeon Gardner, 69, had diverted $220,000</B> in church funds for  three years to a man with whom he had &quot;improper and impermissible sexual conduct,&quot; the diocese said. <BR><B>...Two days later, the diocese confirmed that Rev. William Lau of St. Petersburg</B> is on leave of absence and undergoing counseling after a complaint by a man alleging sexual misconduct had occurred &quot;many years prior.&quot; <P> <B>Roderick Wright, the Catholic Bishop of Argyll, said he will marry Kathleen Macphee</B>, the divorced mother of three with whom he ran away. Wright's resignation and disappearance three weeks ago shocked the Church in Scotland. He also said he would have to accept the fact that after 32 years as a priest he would never say Mass again. <P> <B>The United States warned Taleban Islamic rulers in Kabul that they risk forfeiting war-reconstruction aid</B> for Afghanistan if they continue to restrict women's rights. Since the Taleban movement captured Kabul two weeks ago, it has prohibited women from working. <BR><B>...United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali also warned Taleban rulers</B> that the U.N. objects to the extreme discrimination they practice against women. He warned of  &quot;serious repercussions&quot; for the foreign aid programs there, the <I>New York Times</I> said. The U.N., working with a large number of  relief organizations, is the most important source of aid to Afghanistan. <P> <B>The United States will send a senior official to South Korea as tensions rise</B> over the intrusion of a North Korean submarine and North Korea's arrest of a Christian missionary on spy charges, news reports said. Washington has demanded that North Korea free Evan Carl Hunzike, 26, a Christian missionary and U.S. citizen arrested Oct. 6 on charges of spying for South Korea . <BR><B>...The purpose of the American diplomat's trip is to reassure South Korea</B>, an official said. South Korean newspapers have accused President Clinton of  appeasing North Korea to keep peace on the Korean peninsula at any cost before November's presidential elections. <P> <B>American cities and suburbs have reported dramatic increases in heroin usage and deaths</B> in the past 1 1/2 years, news report say. Some studies estimate the number of heroin addicts in the United States at 1 million. Heroin is increasingly popular among young people since it is being glamorized by rock musicians, it is more available, and cheaper than in the past, experts say. <P> <B>British clergy are being taught to cope with drunks, drug addicts, and thieves</B> who increasingly come to their doorsteps demanding money, <I>The London Times</I> said. A number of conferences throughout the country address the problem. Clergy and their wives face growing threats of violence from beggars, many of whom are mentally ill or want money for drugs.  <BR><B>...Clergy also are under threat from the public</B>. As respect for the church has declined, clerics sometimes are bullied and intimidated by the public, <I>The Times</I> said. The Christian command to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; means many are unwilling or do not know how to fight, <I>The Times</I> said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 07, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...&quot;We don't want to build a federation on the foundation of the ashes of another. </B>We have to move ahead,&quot; the URC's stated clerk said at the group's first synod Oct. 1 and 2 in Lynwood, Ill. About 100 delegates, including those who have seceded from the Christian Reformed denomination in recent years, met to organize the new denomination. <BR><B>...The URC synod issued a letter encouraging a hundred conservative Christian Reformed churches</B>, called the Interclassical Conference, that have remained in the United Reformed Church. The conference has warned the Christian Reformed Church of a possible secession unless the denomination reverses its decision to allow the ordination of women ministers and elders. The URC is the largest of  several secessionist movements in the Christian Reformed Denomination. <BR><B>...The Christian Reformed Church has lost about 25,000 members in the last four years</B>, dropping to 291,796 this year. About 18,000 of those members have joined secession churches opposed to the ordination of women. <P>   <P> <B>The U.S. Supreme Court today rejected a challenge to the Freedom of Access to Clinics Entrances Act</B>, the law that protects access to abortion clinics. The appellants were five Wisconsin pro-life protesters arrested for blockading the Wisconsin Women's Health Care Center in Milwaukee in 1994. Protesters blocked the front and rear doors to the clinic with cars and welded and handcuffed themselves to the cars, news reports said. <BR><B>...The justices let stand a ruling that said Congress acted within its authority</B> to regulate interstate commerce when it passed FACE in 1994. Three federal appeals courts previously have upheld the law. In each of those cases, the Supreme Court let stand the decisions upholding the law. <P>     <P> <B>Public schools can continue to make charitable work a graduation requirement</B>, the Supreme Court decided today. The justices rejected, without comment, the appeal of Daniel Immediato, a former student at Rye Neck High School in Mamaroneck, N.Y., who was denied a diploma because he refused to participate in a mandatory community-service program. The school required all students to perform 40 hours of community service before graduation. Work for a variety of not-for-profit corporations, charities, political organizations or public agencies would qualify. <BR><B>...Immediato and his parents argued that decisions to serve others</B> should be determined by the family and conscience, not government edict. An estimated 8% of the nation's public school districts have such mandatory service programs. <P> <B>A proposed parental-rights amendment to Colorado's Constitution</B> has led to sharp debate. Proponents of Amendment 17 want protection for the &quot;inalienable right&quot; of parents to &quot;direct and control the upbringing, education, values and discipline of their children.&quot; Supporters say they are tired of battling schools, health-service organizations, and other agencies for control of their children. They say Amendment 17 would protect families against government meddling. <BR><B>...Opponents say parents already have the right to raise children the way they see fit</B>. They worry that the amendment would harm those most in need of help by keeping children in abusive homes and making it harder to prosecute child-abuse cases. Opponents include teachers' unions, the national Parent Teachers Association, and the American Civil Liberties Union,  <BR><B>...Signatures of more than 80,000 registered voters were gathered</B> to put the measure on the ballot.  A poll taken Sept. 3-5 by the <I>Rocky Mountain News</I> found 76% in favor of the amendment, 11% said they opposed the proposal, and 13% were undecided. <P> <B>Worship of Satan has penetrated institutions in Keyna</B>, a government commission found. The commission, appointed by President Daniel arap Moi in 1994, was led by Roman Catholic Archbishop Nicodemus Kirima and included representatives of  Kenyan society, Ecumenical News Service said. Information was gathered from self-confessed devil worshippers and corroborated from independent sources. <BR><B>...Evidence of  devil worship is plentiful,</B> the commission said in a two-page summary of its report. It includes kidnapping of children, rape, child abuse, murders, and the severing of tongues, eyes and limbs. Also occurring is human sacrifice, drinking human blood, black masses, nudity at rituals, use of drugs and snakes, and homosexuality and lesbianism, the report said. The president said the government is taking action to &quot;curb the evil practices,&quot; and advised the public to stop getting involved in devil worship. <P> <B>Kabul's middle class -- doctors, lawyers, engineers and their families -- have begun an exodus from the Afghan capital </B>after last week's victory of the Taleban militia. The radical Taleban seeks to establish a strict Islamic state. Taleban fighters seized the capital from the relatively moderate Islamic government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani. <BR><B>...Before dawn, families creep from their homes and head to the Kabul River</B>, hauling trunks and burlap sacks full of clothing and household goods, the<I> New York Times</I> reported. There, they wait for minibuses that go east to Jalalabad. Then, many switch to camel routes into Pakistan. <BR><B>...Kabul's schools and colleges have not reopened</B> since women have been forbidden to hold jobs outside the home and 70% of teachers are women. Some women doctors and nurses are working at hospitals, where they may care for female patients, but others have not returned for fear of harassment. <BR><B>...Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei criticized Afghanistan's Taleban movement</B> as &quot;un-Islamic&quot; and said it was backed by the United States, Reuters news service said. <P> <B>Pope John Paul's announced appendix surgery, scheduled for Tuesday, has begun a flurry of  speculation</B> from the media  that he may be more seriously ill and suffering from a tumor, news reports said. The Vatican has dismissed such speculation. <BR><B>...The Pope's left hand trembled violently Sunday at a service in St. Peter's Square</B>, Reuters news service said. This occurrence, along with facial rigidity and a stooped gait, could indicate Parkinson's Disease. The Vatican has not denied such reports. The pope underwent surgery twice in 1981 after suffering gunshot injuries in an assassination attempt, and again in 1992, when doctors removed a benign tumor from his colon.  <P> <B>Mothers should forgo full-time jobs in favor of raising their children at home</B>, Mormon Church president Gordon Hinckley said. It is nearly impossible to be a full-time homemaker and a full-time employee, he said in a sermon directed to the women of his 9.6-million member church. Women who work outside the home should do so to meet basic needs and &quot;not simply to indulge a taste for an elaborate home, fancy cars, and other luxuries,&quot; he said. <P> <B>Some 300 men on death row in Russian prisons </B>received New Testaments distributed by the Bible Society of Russia. <B> </B>&quot;I will pray the Lord Jesus Christ to set me in the right way,&quot;  one prisoner said in response to the gift. <P> <B>An Assemblies of God pastor has entered Nicaragua's presidential race</B>. Guillermo Osorno would get 3.8% of the vote, according to a survey taken in Managua last month. But Osomo told Ecumenical News International that polls conducted by his party, the Christian Path, put him at between 14%-22% of the vote. <BR><B>...The main two rivals for president</B> -- Arnoldo Aleman and former Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega of the Sandinista National Liberation Front -- share about 75% of the vote, with none of the other 21 presidential candidates previously registering more than 2%. A strong showing by Osomo would prevent either Aleman or Ortega from getting at least 45%, necessitating a runoff. Evangelicals make up about a quarter of Nicaragua's population. Balloting is Oct. 20.    </font></p>

In court, the man said he could not get work in Togo, that drugs to treat him were scarce, and that HIV-positive people are ostracized. The case may be the first U.S. court ruling stemming from the White House's policy this year that gives preferential treatment to immigrants who have AIDS or are HIV-positive, <I>The Washington Times</I> reported. <P> <B>The controversial Halloween Hell House will be back this year in Arvada, Colo</B>. The display is sponsored by Abundant Life Christian Center, a Pentecostal church. It is modeled after a traditional haunted house, but contains scenes depicting a woman who has just undergone an abortion, a funeral for an AIDS sufferer, a drunken driver who kills his family in a car accident, and a teen-age suicide victim. The gruesome scenes depict what happens when people reject the Bible, the pastor told the Associated Press. There also will be a Heaven House exhibit for children. Abundant Life is selling how-to kits to other churches that want to set up their own Hell Houses. <P> <B>Lutherans and Catholics opened an elementary school together in Youngstown, Ohio, this fall</B>. New Hope Academy -- known since 1914 as St. Patrick School -- is sponsored by the Northeastern Ohio Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Catholic Dioceses of Youngstown, and run by Ursaline Sisters. There are two Lutheran teachers on staff, and students who are interested can learn about Lutheranism, the ELCA news service reported. <P> <I><B>Money</B></I><B> magazine named five schools that are members of the Coalition for Christian Colleges</B> and Universities in its rankings of best college buys. Last year, <I>Money</I> had a policy that excluded most religious schools. The magazine reversed its stance after appeals from a number of groups, the CCCU said. The CCCU schools listed in the magazine are: Gordon College, Wenham, Mass; Goshen College, Goshen, Ind.; Tabor College, Hillsboro, Kan.; Trinity Christian College, Palos Heights, Ill.; and Wheaton College, Wheaton, Ill. <BR><B>...Although not included in the ranking because it does not charge tuition</B>, College of the Ozarks, in Missouri, was cited by <I>Money </I>as a &quot;great deal.&quot;  Students pay for their tuition by working on campus 15 hours a week, plus two 40-hour weeks each semester, CCCU said. <P> <B>Pope John Paul II is being hospitalized to remove his appendix. The Vatican denied a report</B> by the Italian news agency <I>ASCA</I> that the pope, 76, may be suffering from a new tumor. The pope had a colon tumor removed in 1992. <P> <B>Ethnic killings among the Tutsi and Hutu in the central African country of Burundi threaten to escalate into genocide</B> like that experienced by its neighbor to the north, Rwanda, in 1994, Christian relief workers say. Since a coup in July, Burundi has been ruled outside of its multi-party, democratic constitution. A comprehensive, international peace plan is necessary to prevent genocide, relief workers told Ecumenical News Service. The peace plan should include a cease-fire, material aid, an embargo on arms shipments to the region, monitoring of human rights, and security assistance from neighboring states, relief workers said. <P> <B>Poland's upper chamber of parliament voted Thursday to reject liberalization of the country's strict, church-sponsored anti-abortion law</B>. However, Poland's lower chamber, which voted Aug. 30 to liberalize the law, still may overrule the upper chamber. President Aleksander Kwasniewski said he would sign the bill, which allows abortions up until the 12th week of pregnancy. Thousands of  protesters pushed baby carriages and prayed outside the Warsaw parliament building during the vote, news reports said. <P> <B>Canada's Supreme court agreed to hear an appeal by a homosexual</B> who was fired by The King's University College in Edmonton, Alberta, which has strong religious views against homosexuality, Reuter news service reported. The court's ruling could set policy for how far Canadian courts can force an end to discrimination. <BR><B>...The appellant, Delwin Vriend, was dismissed in 1991 as a laboratory coordinator</B>. At issue is whether Alberta's human rights act violates the federal constitution's Charter of Rights since it does not ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Vriend was successful in a trial court, but that ruling was overturned before he appealed to the Supreme Court. <P> <B>Pat Robertson's daily hour-long talk show, the <I>700 Club</I>, is broadcasting on New York superstation</B> WWOR. This gives the Virginia Beach, Va., evangelist a potential audience of 92% of U.S. television households, since WWOR is picked up by  cable systems and other stations across the country. <P> <B>A woman in China walked 200 miles to mail a letter</B> to Trans World Radio's Chinese Ministry International. The letter told about the woman's conversion to faith in Christ. &quot;Such is the impact that the gospel is having on this nation, still gripped by atheism and other religious beliefs,&quot; TWR said. <P>      </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 04, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...Because Ntakirutimana is charged with participating in killings in western Rwanda</B>, the U.S. plans to extradite him to Tanzania to face the charges before a United Nations' tribunal, Ecumenical News Service said. About half a million Rwandans died in the ethnic bloodbath; some clergy have been accused of participating in the massacres. <BR><B>...There are 806 Adventist congregations in Rwanda, with 285,440 members</B>, Adventist News Service said. The Adventist relief agency ADRA provides relief supplies to Rwandan refugees in Zaire and Burundi. <P> <B>The issue of  women in the ministry continues to stir controversy in the Christian Reformed Church</B>. On Sept. 29, Eastern Avenue Christian Reformed Church in Grand Rapids, Mich, ordained  Mary Antonides, 26, as its pastor and the denomination's second femal minister, Reformed News Service said. But the denomination's Northern Michigan classis, meeting Sept. 24, voted 18-13 not to ordain Mary-Lee Bouma. Last year, the CRC Synod voted to give each classis autonomy in deciding the issue of women's ordination.  <BR><B>...Two CRC churches seceded from the denomination because of the denomination's decision to allow women ministers</B>. They are Bethany CRC in South Holland, Ill., and  Franklin Lakes CRC in New Jersey. Rev. Daniel Bratt of the Franklin Lakes CRC told the news service that allowing women to become ministers indicates &quot;the authority of Scripture is being eroded in the practices of the church.&quot; <P> <B>The United Methodist Church is confused about its identity and mission</B>, according to an evangelical group within the denomination. The group Good News, meeting  Sept. 25-27 in Wilmore, Ky., issued <I>A Resolution to a Church in Crisis, </I>United Methodist News Service said. The document calls on the UMC's Council of Bishops to preach and practice &quot;the doctrinal standards and moral principals of the church&quot; or to resign. <BR><B>...The beliefs of  some UMC leaders on homosexuality are &quot;contrary to Wesleyan theology,&quot;</B> Good News said. The group said it opposes the Reconciling Congregation program, a movement that welcomes full inclusion of homosexuals into the church. That  movement &quot;promotes a counterfeit gospel of grace without repentance, and salvation without transformation,&quot; Good News said. Instead, Good News supports the ministry of Transforming Congregations, a movement which it says &quot;offers a warm and welcoming place for those struggling with homosexuality&quot; and &quot;proclaims the biblical understanding that homosexual behavior is sin, and that hope and healing are available.&quot; <BR><B>...Good News board members said they would help organize people in the UMC who want to withhold their giving</B> from programs they consider &quot;inconsistent with the Gospel.&quot; <P> <B>The case of a British woman who tried giving birth to octuplets has raised questions</B> about who should receive fertility treatment. Mandy Allwood, 31, took a fertility drug, then ignored medical advice to avoid sex for a while. The babies all died. The six boys and two girls were laid in a cot beside Allwood's bed, Reuter news service said. <BR><B>...Critics said doctors should not have given Allwood the treatment</B> since she already had a child and took the drugs in an attempt to save a troubled relationship. She is a divorced single mother. Nicholas Coote of  the Catholic Bishops' Conference told Reuters news service that only married couples should  be eligible to receive fertility treatment. <BR><B>...In a separate case in England, a 30-year-old widow is fighting for the right to be impregnated</B> with her dead husband's sperm. The Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority refused permission, saying she did not have his written consent. In July, the authority ordered the destruction of thousands of  fetuses created by in-vitro fertilization because they had passed a legal deadline. <BR><B>...British doctors also were criticized this summer for agreeing to a selective abortion </B>of one of a pair of  fetuses after the mother said she could afford only one child. <P> <B>Gypsies in Central and East Europe will soon be able to hear the gospel on radio in their native tongue.</B> The Bulgarian Baptist Union plans to begin the broadcasts on AM radio in the Romani language beginning Oct. 28, according to Trans World Radio. Romani is spoken by 1.5 million Gypsies in Bulgaria, the former Yugoslavia, and neighboring countries. The dialect also is understood by most other Gypsies in those areas. Listeners who respond to the 15-minute programs will be invited to join fellowship groups. Gypsies have often been ostracized and targets of hatred, TWR said. TWR also plans next year to begin programs in the Kalderash Romani dialect, spoken by 1 million Gypsies. <P> <B>A man who wants to become a notary public is challenging</B>  the South Carolina constitution's requirement that public officers acknowledge the existence of God. Herb Silverman, an atheist who is a 54-year-old math professor at the College of Charleston, is taking his case to the state's Supreme Court today. A lower court threw out the constitution's so-called &quot;God clause,&quot; which has been part of the document since 1886. The state appealed the ruling. Becoming a notary public is not the main issue; changing the state constitution is, Silverman told the Associated Press. <P> <B>In France, ex-followers of  the Church of Scientology are accusing the religion</B> of  pressuring them psychologically and extracting large amounts of money from them, news reports said. Their testimony came during the trial of 23 French Scientologists. The church members are accused of charges ranging from manslaughter and embezzlement to fraud in the 1988 suicide of a church follower. The trial, held in Lyon, is expected to provide a glimpse into the church's inner workings. <BR><B>...One former Scientologist said church officers shouted questions at her</B> as she was made to stand against a wall with arms apart. She also said she gave the church $200,000 over four years, Reuters reported. A Catholic priest said he gave the church $100,000, which  he had received from an elderly woman, for &quot;purification sessions,&quot; the news service said. <BR><B>...Prosecutors say the church exploited gullible victims for money</B> through &quot;pseudo-scientific and paramedical means&quot; and also caused them &quot;medical and psychological risk.&quot; If found guilty, the defendants could go to jail for five years and be fined $1 million. A Church of Scientology spokesman denounced the trial as &quot;the return of the Inquisition.&quot; <P> <B>Los Angeles is considering naming a Hollywood street after Scientology founder L. Ron  Hubbard.</B> The City Council voted  Tuesday to change Berendo Street to L. Ron Hubbard Way, the Associated Press said. A second vote next week would make the change official. <P> <B>William Murray, a Protestant minister and the son of  atheist leader Madalyn Murray O'Hair</B>, filed a missing person report on his mother, news reports said. O'Hair, who filed the lawsuit that led to the 1963 Supreme Court decision that banned compulsory prayers in public schools,  has not been seen for 13 months, police said. O'Hair, 77, her son, Jon, and daughter, Robin, vanished after years of crusading against organized religion. Police assigned an investigator to the case.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 03, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...Possibilities for saving money through further staff reductions are &quot;virtually exhausted,''</B> Raiser said. Instead, the WCC must institute &quot;basic changes&quot; before its 1988 assembly in Harare, Zimbabwe, he said. <P> <B>The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) must make radical changes &quot;or the church will die,&quot;</B> new General Assembly Council chairman Youngil Cho told council members meeting in Louisville, Ky.  He spoke frankly about declines in membership, financial support, and trust, Presbyterian News Service said. The GAC must streamline its operations and make decisions more democratically, &quot;from the boardroom to the assembly line.&quot; The council has been creating programs &quot;without assessing the needs of congregations -- we need to do something for nurturing families and local congregations.&quot; <BR><B>...Cho proposed a radical restructuring of the General Assembly mission efforts:</B>  a reduction of the national staff by two-thirds; elimination of synods; a reduction in the number of General Assembly-level entities; and the transfer of most functions of the GAC to the presbyteries. Nevertheless, Cho insisted the denomination has hope because it is &quot;in the hands of God.&quot; <P> <B>A bomb was thrown into the courtyard of the Ecumenical Patriarch --</B> spiritual leader of  the world's Orthodox Christians -- Sept. 30 in Istanbul, Turkey. It hit the roof of St. George's Cathedral and caused considerable damage to the church and clergy living quarters, but no one was injured  <BR><B>...The attack raised concern about the Patriarch's safety in the predominantly Muslim country</B>. The Patriarchate traces its history to Istanbul's days as the Byzantine capital. Members and clergy are Greek Orthodox and are natives of Turkey. The attack may be linked to tension between Turkey and Greece over the future of Cyprus, Ecumenical News International said. <P> <B>Sunday, Oct. 6, is National Life Chain Sunday</B>. Pro-life advocates in cities across the U.S. will  peacefully assemble and form &quot;human life chains.&quot; For information, call (916) 671-5500. <P> <B>The Confessing Movement within the United Methodist Church,</B> a group that emphasizes doctrinal fidelity and renewal, plans to hire a full-time executive director, United Methodist News Service said. The movement began in 1994 when 102 United Methodists met to discuss what they consider the UMC's &quot;abandonment of the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed in Scripture and asserted in the classic Christian tradition and historic ecumenical creeds.&quot; More than 500 people attended the group's Sept. 27-28 conference in Cincinnati. <P> <B>The radical Taleban militia that has conquered Afghanistan continues to enforce a purist brand of Islam</B> on the people, Reuters news service said. On Tuesday, a broadcast by the Taleban-controlled Kabul Radio quoted a religious official as ordering people to offer Islamic prayers five times a day. Local prayer leaders were asked to bring violators to Taleban offices. &quot;Those who do not perform the prayer in fact are committing a grave sin and those who reject it are infidels,&quot; the announcement said. <BR><B>...The Taleban, which began as a movement of  theology students</B> and now controls three quarters of the country, has many people in fear. Women have been barred from leaving their homes without the Islamic veil and from working in offices. But after an outcry abroad about the denial of women's rights, the Taleban issued a decree promising women laid off from their jobs would be paid their salaries without working. The salaries will be sent to their homes, a Kabul Radio broadcast said<B>.</B> <BR><B>...A Taleban official said 85 &quot;thieves and plunderers&quot; had been caught in three days</B> and were &quot;undergoing legal and Sharia investigation.&quot; Also, 90 cars and 500 weapons have been confiscated, Reuters said. The Taleban has decreed death by stoning for adultery and amputation of hands for theft. <P> <B>In Jerusalem, tourists who came to visit the holy sites have found themselves</B> in the middle of an armed struggle, their tour blocked by Israeli checkpoints, the Associated Press said. Israeli soldiers have stopped many tour buses from entering the city. Last week, Israel opened a new exit to a Jerusalem tunnel that runs near sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims. <BR><B>...Hotels across Israel and the West Bank have had numerous cancellations</B>, news reports said. The Israel Ministry of Tourism is attempting to deal with an estimated $200 million loss in tourist renevue since the tunnel opening, a newspaper said. <BR><B>...Jews observing a religious holiday Tuesday made heavy use of the tunnel</B> to reach their destinations, CNN said. While polls show most Israelis believe their prime minister was wrong to open the tunnel, there was no sign of that opinion among its visitors, the network said. <P> <B>Congress has cracked down on child pornographers</B>.  A new law that took effect Tuesday makes it illegal to use computer technology to depict children in sexual situations -- whether in films, computer images or photographs. Such depictions, which use computer simulations rather than real children, had been outside the scope of federal law. Lawmakers said computer-generated pornography poses many of the same dangers to children as does pornography made from unretouched photographs. <BR><B>...The new law sets mandatory prison sentences of 15 years for production of child pornography</B>, five years for possession of the materials, and life in prison for repeat offenders convicted of sexual abuse of a minor. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the law as unconstitutional, saying  it was so broad that adults portraying children in films could risk prosecution. <P> <B>B'nai B'rith began a campaign against the Southern Baptist Convention's resolution</B> on Jewish evangelism. The Jewish organization, which has members in 56 countries, mailed a fundraising letter to about 100,000 people describing the SBC<B> </B>resolution, which advocates an active program of converting Jews to Christianity, as &quot;condescending and contemptuous.

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 02, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>A 155-foot, $3-million, stainless steel statue of Jesus Christ</B> will be built next spring near Louisville, Ky., <I>USA Today</I> said. The statue, which will reveal no gender or race, will be part of  a $13 million spiritual complex that its owners, the Waverly Hope Foundation, hope will draw 1 million visitors a year. The idea was inspired by the 120-foot statue of Christ in Rio de Janiero, Brazil. <P>   <P> <B>Switzerland is trying to find out if it still holds money that belongs to Jews killed by the Nazis</B>. The Swiss lower house of parliament created a panel of experts to account for Switzerland's financial dealings with the Nazis and determine whether the Swiss have done enough to identify the lost assets of those killed in the Holocaust, Reuters said. Newly declassified U.S. wartime archives increased speculation that Switzerland could still be holding Nazi gold or millions of dollars in assets from people who perished during Hitler's reign of terror. <BR><B>...Some historians say the Swiss were spared a Nazi invasion</B> in part because they provided monetary services to the Nazis. Swiss gold purchases were a crucial source of funds to finance the Nazi war effort. Others see the move as  part of an attempt by London and New York financiers to dull Switzerland's competitive edge as an international financial center. <P> <B>In Britain, Holocaust disbelievers could face prison</B>. The Labour party wants to make denial of the Holocaust a criminal offense punishable by two years in prison, the <I>London Times</I> reported. The party wants to muffle right-wing intellectuals and political campaigners who claim the Holocaust never happened or that Hitler was unaware of its extent. Opponents of  the legislation say such restrictions on freedom of speech would increase racial tensions in Britain and play into the hands of extremists by attracting sympathy for their cause. <P> <B>Burma's military government arrested 500 pro-democracy supporters and warned Buddhist clergy</B> to stay away from others in the movement. The government is worried that the monks, who have supported pro-democracy movements in the past, may do so again. The military kept roads to democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's home in Rangoon closed and prevented the Nobel Peace laureate from convening a pro-democracy meeting, the Associated Press reported. <BR><B>...Many monks were killed in 1988 when the military regime took power</B>. In 1990, monks protested the junta's activities by declining to perform religious rites for members of  the military regime. Dissidents released from a Burmese prison have reported that 200 monks are being held. Troops reportedly have arrested pro-democracy activists staying at monastery guest houses. <P> <B>Amnesty International says rights abuses abound in Turkey</B>. The London-based human rights group issued a report exposing what it called Turkey's failure to prevent torture, extrajudicial killings, and the phenomenon of  suspects &quot;disappearing&quot; in detention. Turkish leaders, judges, and physicians have ignored abuses by Turkey's security forces, Amnesty said.  <BR><B>...Amnesty accused the West of not pushing NATO-member Turkey hard enough on human rights</B>. The West is afraid of upsetting an ally in a troubled region, the report said. <P> <B>British parents are resorting to fraud, blackmail, and financial threats</B> to get their children into church schools, a London television news show said. According to Channel 4's <I>Witness</I>, parents are joining churches, then threatening to withdraw their financial support unless the minister allows their children into the church's school. Some schools have set up a points system, requiring parents to attend services regularly with their children in order to get their child into the school. Parents blame poor education for a decline in moral and spiritual values, and the demand for church schools has increased rapidly, the <I>London Times</I> said. <P> <B>Poland may liberalize its abortion law, ignoring the Roman Catholic Church</B>, the <I>Chicago Tribune</I> reported. The lower house of  Poland's parliament voted  208-61 to legalize abortion for women who live in &quot;difficult living conditions&quot; or where they have other important personal reasons. The upper house of the Sejm will consider the bill this week.  <BR><B>...Under communism, abortion was freely available,</B> but when the church-backed Solidarity movement overthrew the country, Poland's bishops succeeded in getting one of Europe's most restrictive pro-life laws passed. Now reformed communists have returned to power. Pope John Paul II said this development in his native land has caused him great personal anguish, the newspaper reported. Surveys show a majority of Poles favor liberalization of abortion laws. <P> <B>The Norman Vincent Peale Center for Christian Living is a veritable &quot;prayer factory,&quot;</B> the <I>New York Times</I> said. The center, which was founded in New York in 1940 and moved  to Pawling, N.Y., in 1952, has a prayer administrator and 240 Prayer Partners, located on and off the site. They handle 3,000 prayer requests a week. Peale wrote the author of the 1952 inspirational classic <I>The Power of Positive Thinking.</I> <P> <B>D. James Kennedy has started an organization to mobilize conservative Christians.</B> The Center for Reclaiming America will not support specific candidates or political parties, the group said. Founded by the television pastor's Coral Ridge Ministries, the group will track policies, draft legislation, and encourage volunteers to lobby lawmakers. Its constituency will overlap somewhat with the Christian Coalition, but the groups will complement rather than compete with each other, the center said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 01, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...The 82-count indictment accuses Bennett of bank and mail fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion</B>. It said Bennett persuaded nonprofit groups to give New Era money that would double in six months with matching funds from anonymous donors, news reports said. The donors did not exist, and instead New Era was running a ponzi scheme, using money from new participants to pay off earlier investors, the indictment said. <BR><B>...Much of the money is owed to evangelical Christian groups</B>, colleges, and churches. About 600 investors never received grants and lost about $150 million, including $3.5 million Bennett used to maintain a lavish lifestyle, prosecutors said. Some nonprofit groups received grants from New Era, and most of them have agreed to return the money to help pay creditors who failed to receive the money.  <P> <B>A record number of Canadian women obtained abortions in 1994</B>.  A total of 106,255 abortions were performed in hospitals and  private clinics, a rate of 27.6 abortions for ever 100 live births and an increase of 1.8% from the previous year, according to the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada. Private abortion clinics, legalized in 1988, perform an increasing number of abortions each year as abortions in hospitals remain steady, the EFC said.  <BR><B>...Even though the Supreme Court of Canada has acknowledged</B> that the federal government has an interest in the life of the unborn child,  there is no legal means to exercise this interest, the EFC said. Having no law to protect the unborn &quot;suggests indifference to the value of human life at its most vulnerable stage,&quot; the EFC said. <P> <B>Legalization of physician-assisted suicide in the United States would quickly slide into involuntary euthanasia</B> -- as it has in the Netherlands -- two prominent Christian leaders said. Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and David Stevens, executive director of the Christian Medical &amp; Dental Society, said  physician-assisted suicide would endanger the elderly, poor, depressed, handicapped, and other vulnerable members of society. &quot;Physicians know it is dangerous for them to have the power to help kill patients. That is why it has been prohibited in the medical profession for over 2,000 years,&quot; Stevens said at a press conference hosted by  Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.). Canady presented findings from a new congressional report, <I>Physician-Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in the Netherlands</I>.  <BR><B>...In Holland, strict regulations have failed to keep deaths voluntary</B>, Stevens said. Government reports show that in 1990, 2,300 people were killed by Netherlands doctors in its euthanasia program, including more than 1,000 people without their consent. &quot;Who will know what really went on between the doctor and the patient when the patient is dead?&quot; Stevens said.  <P> <B>A church in Michigan conducts a question-and-answer session</B> during its informal Saturday evening worship service. Rob Bell, pastor at Calvary Church, an independent evangelical congregation in Grand Rapids, takes questions after his sermon. Hand-written questions are collected, and each is anonymous.  Some questions focus on the meaning of passages from the Bible, but most focus on personal matters, such as sexual issues, abuse, and suicide. Bell avoids pat responses, often directs questioners to the Bible for further contemplation of the issue, and sometimes admits he does not know the answer. The session is risky but spiritual seekers consider it authentic, Bell said.  <P> <B>There's nothing very monastic about the monastic life in the United States any more</B>. Economic pressures are forcing modern monks to become workaholics, laboring long hours in secular jobs outside the monastery. This creates stress and consumes too much of the monks' lives, leaving little time for prayer, contemplation, and monastic community activities.           <P> <B>Neighbors Who Care, a national Christian ministry formed to help victims of  crime</B>, has grown since its founding in 1993 to nine chapters across the United States. A subsidiary of  Prison Fellowship, the ministry started by Chuck Colson, Neighbors Who Care provides practical, emotional, and spiritual support. The latest chapter began as a support group for homicide survivors in Memphis, Tenn., formed by Kitty Lawson, associate pastor at Abundant Grace Fellowship. Lawson formed the group after a couple from the church was murdered in their apartment. For information: Neighbors Who Care, P.O. Box 16079, Washington, D.C., 20041; phone: (703) 904-7311.  <P> <B>A translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls for non-scholars</B> is scheduled to be published in November. <I>The Dead Sea Scrolls: A New Translation</I>, contains no momentous revelations about early Christianity, researcher Edward Cook said. <P> <B>Cook and two colleagues pieced fragments together for the translation</B>, transliterated the Aramaic text into modern Hebrew, and translated the Hebrew into English. <P> <B>The scrolls, written by the Essenes, an ascetic Jewish sect</B>, were discovered in 1946 in a cave near the Dead Sea. They are thought to date to the second century before Jesus and to the first century after his death. No scroll directly connects the Essenes with early Christianity, he said. <P> <B>Australia's parliament is facing pressure from religious, political, and community groups</B> to overturn the world's first law legalizing mercy killing.  Australia's outback Northern Territory introduced the world's first voluntary euthanasia law earlier this year. The first person to die under the law was 66 year old Bob Dent, a former carpenter and one-time Christian missionary. Dent was terminally ill with prostate cancer. <BR><B>...However, opinion in the territory is running stronly in favor of the law</B>. Nationwide, opinion polls show strong support, with up to eight in 10 Australians in favor of the law. <P> <B>Nearly half of all pregnancies  in the United States are unintended and nearly a quarter end in abortion,</B> researchers for the Alan Guttmacher Institute said. Speaking at an American Medical Association conference in San Francisco Sept. 30, said that although 98% of American women use contraception during their reproductive years, two-thirds have had an unplanned pregnancy.  <P> <B>Plans are under way to provide World Wide Web home pages to all 19,500 Catholic parishes</B> in the United States. Catholic Online and the Catholic Catalog Company of Bakersfield, Calif., announced a joint venture to set up the pages free of charge, calling it a large but important task. The sites will allow parishes to communicate with their local parishioners as well as with the whole Catholic community, the companies said. A database of all parishes, including a Mass timetable, will allow travelers to type in their destination and receive information about the closest Catholic churches. <P> <B>Busloads of foreign tourists come each Sunday to attend some of the 400 churches in Harlem</B>, N.Y., one of the world's most famous African-American neighborhoods. Tours are given in English, Italian, French, Spanish, German, and Portuguese. They are part of the rejuvenation of Harlem neighborhoods,  some of which are being revived as centers of  business and entertainment for tourists and residents of all races.    </font></p>

Freedom restricted in Russia</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Religious freedom in Russia is deteriorating</B>. Even while ominous changes in the 1990 national law on freedom of conscience are being considered in the Duma, opponents of religious freedom in Russia's republics are becoming more aggressive and successful -- apparently without challenge from the central government. <BR> <B>...In the last two years, one-fourth of Russia's 88 republics have adopted laws </B>harshly restricting religious freedom, Keston News Service reported. The texts of the new laws, obtained from 10 provinces, contain the same ideas and words, showing that opponents of religious freedom in various regions are sharing strategies. All the laws flagrantly violate Russia's 1993 constitution, which ensures all religions equality under the law, KNS said. So far, Russia's constitutional court has refused to review the provincial laws.   <BR> <B>...Pending national legislation could restrict the freedom of foreign missionaries.</B> If enacted, it would  allow religious organizations to operate publicly only by consent of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Orthodox Church &quot;would like to protect our country from the influence of the evangelical churches from abroad,&quot; Alexander Sorokin, editor of <I>Kristianstvo Segodnya,</I> a Russian Christian magazine, said in an interview with <I>Compass Direct</I>. The full Duma is expected to vote on the legislation in December. <BR> <B>...Evangelical Christians have little influence in Russia</B>, where they are not very politically active and have little access to the media, Sorokin said.    </font></p>

Missionary is killed in plane crash</H3>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Nazarene missionary Ron Farris is presumed dead as a result of the Nov. 23 hijacking and crash</B> of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961, State Department sources said. Positive identification of Farris' remains is still pending, according to the Church of the Nazarene. <BR> <B>...The flight was commandeered by three hijackers, thought to be Ethiopians, </B>who were armed with an ax, a fire extinguisher, and a device they claimed was a bomb. At least one of them was drunk, and waved a whiskey bottle, survivors said. The hijackers demanded to go to Australia, but would not let the captain stop to refuel. For three hours, the pilot tried to reason with them, but the plane began to run out of fuel. It crashed near the beach on the Comoros Islands, off the coast of east Africa, killing 123 people. The plane shattered and spewed bodies into the sea, then quickly filled with water. Fifty-two people survived. <BR> <B>...Farris, 46, was &quot;an outstanding surgeon, a committed missionary</B>, and a man who carried a burden for Africa's suffering people,&quot; church official Richard F. Zanner said. Farris, his wife, Anita, and their four children have been Nazarene missionaries since 1987. One of Farris' responsibilities was managing  medical clinics that treat 40,000 people a year. He also helped perform the Kansas City area's first liver transplant in 1980.    </font></p>

Prison Fellowship will operate the nation's first Christian
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Texas' Board of Criminal Justice voted unanimously Nov. 15 to allow Prison Fellowship</B>, an evangelical organization founded by Charles Colson, to operate a Bible-based program for 200 soon-to-be-released inmates. It will be located at the Jester II unit, a minimum-security lockup in Sugar Land, near Houston. <BR> <B>...The program will be operated at no cost to the prison system. </B>Prison Fellowship will provide hundreds of trained volunteers to administer the program, the group said. The first-year cost to PF is estimated at $1.5 million. PF said it would seek payment for the program if it is extended beyond the two-year pilot project, but acknowledged that it is not assured of any payment at all. Criminal justice board member Allan Polunsky said he would never support payments to groups offering religious programs, because that would amount to state support for religion, he told <I>The Houston Chronicle</I>.  <BR> <B>...Christian beliefs will be the basis for the Jester II program.</B> It aims to change attitudes of selected prisoners who are within 18 months of release and to get them to accept responsibility for past conduct. The program includes counseling for prisoners and their families and restitution for victims. A number of Prison Fellowship programs could be used, including seminars, Bible studies, and one-on-one mentoring. <BR> <B>...&quot;Restorative justice&quot; for the inmate, the family, and the community</B> is the basis of the program, said C. Ronald Kariker, the Houston-area Prison Fellowship director. The program encourages repentance and &quot;a new birth spiritually,&quot; he said. The program is open to members of all religious groups. About half of Texas prison inmates say they are Christian and about a third are Muslim. It will not affect existing drug-counseling or educational programs. Inmates not enrolled in the program would be moved to other units. <BR> <B>...A similar, 20-year Prison Fellowship effort in Brazil reduced repeat offenses to 5%,</B> Reston, Va.-based Prison Fellowship said. Texas has been struggling to find ways to keep ex-convicts from returning to prison. Prisoners in the Brazil program &quot;had become a close-knit family,&quot; said Carol Vance, a member of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice board and former Harris County district attorney. He visited the Brazil program last December. Prisoners there cared about each other's welfare, had a positive outlook, and had confidence they would make it on the outside, Vance told<I> The Houston Chronicle</I>. <BR> <B>...The Jester II program is scheduled to go into effect in January</B>. After volunteers are trained, the first 40 inmates could be enrolled by April, with 100 by the end of 1997 and 200 by the end of 1998. Ultimately, the entire 378-bed Jester II prison could be dedicated to the program, PF said.    </font></p>

Episcopalians embarrassed by church scandals</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The Episcopal Church is getting an earful from its members</B>. Over the past two years, the 2.5 million member denomination sent representatives to almost every diocese, where they listened to 3,000 people talk about what was on their minds. <BR> <B>...&quot;Our people are embarrassed,&quot;</B> said Bishop Chris Epting of Iowa. &quot;Scandal after scandal&quot; has shaken the church in the last three years, he said. &quot;Faithful, dedicated Episcopalians...are literally begging the Episcopal Church to lead and to project a worthy life.&quot; Epting reported accumulated results of the diocesan interviews to the church's Executive Council Nov. 7-11 in Toronto. <BR> <B>...The denomination's most recent scandal involves allegations of sexual decadence in the Diocese of Long Island</B>. An article in the December edition of <I>Penthouse</I> magazine includes descriptions of orgies in the sanctuary of St. Gabriel's Episcopal Church in Brooklyn, cross-dressing priests who model themselves after Marilyn Monroe and Madonna, a sex trade involving young Brazilian men, and a wedding of two men, one of them an Episcopal priest. The rector of the parish resigned after the denomination began investigating published reports of the allegations, news reports said. <BR> <B>...&quot;What is appalling is that this scandal apparently prompted so little investigation</B> or corrective measures by the Diocese of Long Island before a pornographic magazine decided to pursue some news leads,&quot; said <I>United Voice</I>, a conservative Episcopal publication. <BR> <B>...Others who were interviewed said the denomination is spiritually adrift</B> and needs strong leadership. There was a call for &quot;positive direction and a clear identity for the church,&quot; the report said. Some Episcopalians complained they do not share the social and political agenda of the national office. Others said they did not like the size and scope of the General Convention, and criticized the dual roles of the presiding bishop as spiritual leader and chief executive officer. Across the board, dioceses demanded more support for local ministries, fewer top-down directives, and better communication. <BR> <B>...The national church should have a role in some areas,</B> the report said. These include ecumenical relations, Anglican global relations, and world relief efforts. The Presiding Bishop's Fund for World Relief, the United Thank Offering, and national stewardship efforts were praised. <BR> <B>...Executive Council members listened to the complaints and issued new guidelines</B>. They include more support for local congregations; creating a pamphlet explaining church programs and finances; realigning of the denominational structure and the General Convention; and better communications between headquarters and the dioceses. <BR>      </font></p>

&quot;Where are the righteous?&quot; leader asks at prayer-and-fasting
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>About 4,000 Christians gathered to fast and pray Nov. 14-16 in St. Louis </B>while thousands more participated at 141 satellite sites in churches, military bases, college campuses, and homes nationwide. Fasting &amp; Prayer '96 also was broadcast in two, one-hour specials on 133 television stations in the United States; the potential audience was 32 million households. <BR> <B>...&quot;There is a growing desperation in this nation today. Sin is rampant,&quot; </B>said Paul Cedar, chief executive officer of Mission America, the sponsor of the event. &quot;Where are the righteous? We have come to cry out to God. It is only by His mercy that this nation has not been consumed. America is in desperate need today of what only God can give.&quot; <BR> <B>...Other speakers included Tom Elliff, president of the Southern Baptist Convention</B>; Shirley Dobson, chairperson the National Day of Prayer; Bill McCartney, founder of Promise Keepers; Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network; and Adrian Rogers, pastor of Bellevue Baptist Church in Memphis, Tenn.  <BR> <B>...The United States is &quot;experiencing what other nations have experienced</B> when they turned their backs on God,&quot; said Campus Crusade for Christ founder Bill Bright, who co-chaired the event with his wife, Vonette. &quot;The goal here is to say, Lord, we have sinned against you, and we ask you to forgive us and heal our land.&quot; <BR> <B>...The prayer-and-fasting gathering focused on confession and forgiveness</B> and on praying for government leaders, the church, the family, the Great Commission, the media, athletes, and personal spiritual growth, Baptist Press said.  <BR> <B>...&quot;Weep for the church as Christ wept over Jerusalem,&quot;</B> Elliff said. &quot;Christ loved the church and gave Himself for the church so that we might present a glorious, holy church to God without blemish. But we are not without blemish.&quot; Christians have victimized themselves by preaching a &quot;synthetic gospel&quot; that looks like the real thing, but lacks &quot;Holy Spirit conviction, true repentance, genuine faith, lordship, and a changed life.&quot;  <BR> <B>...Planners hope to make the gathering an annual occurrence. </B>It originated two years ago when 600 Christian leaders fasted and prayed in Orlando, Fla.      </font></p>

Laurie spoke of problems that plague young people, and promised that Christ would be the parent, friend, and confidant they need. &quot;Jesus walked in our shoes. He knows our pain,&quot; Laurie told the youth. &quot;God is saddened when we push Him out of our lives. He waits anxiously for our return.&quot; <BR> <B>...Young people come to Laurie's crusades for the music and stay for the message,</B> ABC's <I>World News Tonight</I> has said. The Riverside, Calif., pastor's messages are straightforward and contain traditional Christian themes, but &quot;are sprinkled with sound bites from celebrities and prime-time television.&quot; <BR> <B>...One hundred twenty-five area churches and 800 volunteers worked to bring the crusade </B>to the Universal Amphitheater. Pastors Jack Hayford of the Church on the Way and John MacArthur of Grace Community church helped in preparations and on the platform.     </font></p>

Birth of &quot;miracle baby&quot; leads to powerful witness
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The healing of a guard's baby helped lead 21 inmates to salvation at Rhode Island's Juvenile Detention Center</B>. According to <I>Currents</I>, a newsletter published by The Evangelistic Association of New England, doctors told the guard that, according to their tests, the baby he and his wife were expecting would be born with deformities or Down syndrome. They recommended a third-trimester abortion. <BR> <B>...The guard shared his anguish with Mike Kropman,</B> an EANE ministry prison-coordinator who was visiting the center to hold a Bible study. Kropman talked about God's faithfulness when there appears to be no hope, and invited the guard to bring his wife to their church for prayer. The guard, who is Catholic, was hesitant, but agreed. At the end of the service, the guard and his wife came forward for prayer. Kropman and the elders prayed for the baby's healing and anointed the couple with oil. <BR> <B>...With their faith renewed, the couple made the decision to have the baby rather than undergo an abortion</B>. &quot;We are going to trust God,&quot; she said. Six weeks later, the baby was born with no sign of deformity or Dow syndrome. Doctors were stunned, <I>Currents</I> said.  <BR> <B>...A week later, the guard gave his testimony during another Bible study led by Kropman,</B> relating<B> </B> how God miraculously healed his baby. When the session concluded, 21 boys made a personal commitment to Christ. Since then, the boys have been reading the Bible faithfully.    </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Christian radio is mostly preaching to the choir.</B> Almost all its programming is meant to teach and motivate the 80% of  its 40 million listeners a week who are Christians. This is a valid ministry, but observers ask what can Christian radio do for the 20% of its listeners who aren't believers. <BR> <B>...&quot;Face it: our impact on the non-Christian world is minimal,&quot;</B> said Wayne Pederson, executive director of SkyLight Satellite Network, based in St. Paul, Minn. Non-Christian listeners tune into Christian radio for a variety of reasons. Some are 'secondary listeners' whose spouses tune in -- or are in an office car pool with the radio on. Others are attracted by discussions about parenting, marriage, and politics, just appreciate the music, or are seeking to understand Christianity. But they do not often hear the &quot;plan of salvation,&quot; Pederson said. <BR> <B>...Christian radio is not evangelistic because its Christian listeners want it that way. </B>Unlike Christian radio overseas, Christian Radio in the United States &quot;is 'me' radio. It has to interest me and relate to me,&quot; Pederson told <I>Religion News Today</I>. Out of concern for ratings, stations must give listeners what they want, Pederson said. Also, Christian broadcasters spend so much time &quot;criticizing the unbelievers in the culture, or attacking other Christians&quot; that they lose opportunities to change lives, Pederson wrote in <I>Religious Broadcasting</I>, a magazine published by National Religious Broadcasters. <BR> <B>...Recognizing that the United States is the fifth-largest mission field in the world, </B>a few Christian broadcasters are taking steps to shape a less introspective and more evangelistic medium. A group of 12 Christian stations owned by K-LOVE radio of Sacramento, Calif., airs evangelistic programs on Wednesdays once a month. Listeners are invited to call in for information about salvation.   <BR> <B>...Recently, 18 Christian stations in various parts of the country began an evangelistic project</B> with non-Christian listeners in mind. They are airing 60-second spots by Billy Graham, evangelist Ron Hutchcraft, and Peterson that give the &quot;plan of salvation&quot; and offer a toll-free number to call for information or counseling. Stations air the spots six times daily.  <BR> <B>...Response has been encouraging, organizers say</B>. Among 146 calls received during the first two weeks, 16 people prayed to become Christians and 13 others received assurance of their salvation or recommitted their lives to Christ, counselors said. After the test period, the spots will be made available to all 1,200 Christian stations in the country. <BR> <B>...&quot;If we were to <I>really</I> reach out to non-Christians, programming would have to be very different,&quot;</B> Pederson said. <BR>      </font></p>

Sermon draws picketers, media to tiny church</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Members of Plymouth Congregational Church in Watervliet, Mich., had to walk through picket lines</B> and the media to get to church Sunday. The 60-member congregation has been besieged by protesters and reporters after pastor Don Campbell tried to bar two homosexual men from a service Nov. 10. When the men came to the church and sat in the front row, Campbell launched into an impromptu sermon about the evils of homosexuality. The situation degenerated into a shouting match with about 30 protesters.  <BR> <B>...&quot;How would you like to be me today?&quot;</B> Campbell asked from the pulpit yesterday as he began his sermon, titled &quot;Gay Liberation.&quot; As Kip Thumm, who has attended the church off and on since childhood, his partner Roberto Torres, and the rest of the congregation listened, Campbell said he wanted to &quot;talk to Kip and Roberto and any others here. Are the camera's rolling? I want this on tape.&quot; <BR> <B>...&quot;We welcome you to this church as two sinners</B>. Do you buy that? We're all sinners,&quot; Campbell said. &quot;Kip and Roberto, everyone else, homosexuals, adulterers, bank robbers, swindlers, you and everyone else is welcome here to seek salvation. If you are not sinners, we're not fit to be with you folks because we're all sinners here. All sinners are welcome in this church. If you're not sinners. I don't know where you go.&quot; Thumm, appeared to be caught off guard, and nodded. With that, Campbell told a story, concluded the service, and retreated to his office, <I>The News</I> said. Both sides left the church claiming victory. <BR><B>...Campbell received more than 100 phone calls and letters last week</B>, and Thumm received hundreds of calls of support and was visited by several ministers who said he was welcome to visit their churches, <I>The Detroit News</I> reported.     </font></p>

Nicky Cruz preaches around the world, returns to the ghetto
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>More than 35 years after leaving a violent and angry New York City ghetto life, Nicky Cruz</B> still is delivering his message of God's love to gang members. <BR> <B>...Cruz has held evangelistic crusades in more than 40 countries</B> and led more than 10 million people to make professions of faith in Jesus Christ, his ministry said. He travels 400,000 miles a year, speaking at churches, banquets, and prisons 45 weekends a year. His autobiography, <I>The Cross and the Switchblade</I>, has been translated into 45 languages and is read by public school students in Scandinavian countries and the United Kingdom. Many foreigners are &quot;intrigued by American violence&quot; but their countries don't suffer from the same problems, according to Patrick Dow, who runs Cruz' ministry. <BR> <B>...Cruz once again is aiming his message at inner-city America. </B>&quot;In my heart, I have never left the ghetto,&quot; said Cruz, 57, who still commands respect on the streets. Since 1992, he has held crusades for gang members in Houston, San Antonio, Phoenix, Denver, and Colorado Springs. <BR> <B>...For three weeks before each gang crusade begins</B>, hundreds of former gangsters who now are Christians fan out through inner-city streets preaching, talking to gang members, and inviting them to Cruz' crusade. The volunteers -- many of whom are in various stages of rehabilitation -- come from churches started by Sonny Arguinzoni, a former heroin addict who 35 years ago successfully came through the first Teen Challenge drug center started by Cruz and pastor David Wilkerson of Times Square Church. <BR> <B>...Arguinzoni's group, Victory Outreach, has started more than 200 inner-city churches</B>. Membership is predominantly Hispanic, with many former hard-core drug addicts and convicts. The congregations are affiliated with the Assemblies of God and have their headquarters in LaPuente, Calif. <BR> <B>...For Cruz, it still is painful to share the story of his upbringing, </B>which he describes as &quot;foul and dysfunctional.&quot; Cruz' mother was a witch and his father a &quot;satanic spiritualist healer,&quot; he said. Both of Cruz' parents and his grandmother were sentenced to life in prison for murder, and his two brothers are awaiting trial for murder, he says. Yet, God has &quot;broken the generational curse&quot; on his life, he tells his audiences. <BR> <B>...In Denver this summer, 29,000 people attended Cruz' rallies</B>, and 2,500 filled out cards indicating their decision to become Christians, Dow told<I> Religion News Today</I>. Cruz is considering a similar crusade in New York City next summer. &quot;There is no quick or easy solution,&quot; he says. &quot;What has taken our country a generation to become may take a generation to repair.&quot;    </font></p>

We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory. <BR>  4. We believe that for the salvation of lost and sinful people, regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential. <BR>  5. We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life. <BR>  6. We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved unto the resurrection of life and they that are lost unto the resurrection of damnation. <BR>  7. We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ. <BR>  The National Association of Evangelicals was founded in 1942 in St. Louis, Missouri. The historic roots of the association actually go back to 1846 and the founding the Evangelical Alliance in Great Britain. Today, the National Association of Evangelicals is comprised of approximately 42,500 congregations nationwide from 48 member denominations and individual congregations from an additional 30 denominations and fellowships, as well as several hundred independent churches. The membership of the association includes over 250 parachurch ministries and educational institutions. <BR>  Through the cooperative ministry of these members, the National Association of Evangelicals directly and indirectly benefits over 27 million people. <BR>  Through NAE's headquarters in Carol Stream, Illinois, and its Office for Governmental Affairs in Washington, D.C., through its subsidiary, World Relief Corporation, and five affiliates: Evangelical Fellowship of Mission Agencies, representing over 20,000 overseas career missionaries; National Religious Broadcasters, representing over 900 evangelical radio and television stations; Christian Stewardship Association; Evangelical Child and Family Agency; National Association of Christian Child and Family Agencies. NAE has a long history of service to its members, the broad church of Jesus Christ, and to those in need around the world. <BR>  Dr. Timothy George of Beason Seminary, writing in his recent paper, The Church in the Gospel: An Evangelical Assessment, has made some interesting observations regarding evangelicalism. Dr. George writes the following: &quot;As an international, transdenominational fellowship of  some one-half  billion believers around the world, evangelicalism is, in its very existence, an amazing ecumenical fact. <BR>  &quot;The evangelical witness emerged not only, and not primarily, as a protest against abuses in the church, but rather as a protest for the truth of the Gospel. <BR>  &quot;Wolfhart Pannenberg has said that evangelicals, along with Roman Catholics and Orthodox believers, constitute one of the three ascendent, most resilient forces within world Christianity as it prepares to enter the third millennium. But who are these evangelicals? <BR>  &quot;Evangelicals are a worldwide fellowship of Bible believing Christians whose faith and life are marked by four major emphases: 1) the authority and sufficiency of Holy Scripture, the only normative rule of faith and practice for all true believers; 2) the uniqueness of redemption through the death of Christ upon the cross, the benefits of which are imputed to believers who are justified by faith alone; 3) the necessity of personal conversion wrought by the Holy Spirit through personal repentance, faith, and issuing in a life of obedience and growth in Christ, and 4) the priority and urgency of evangelism and missions in fulfillment of the Great Commission of Christ Himself. <BR>  &quot;As a distinctive stream within the wider Christian tradition, evangelicalism has been fed by many diverse rivulets and tributaries including Puritanism, Pietism, and most vigorously in the last 100 years, Pentecostalism.&quot; <BR>  Dr. George identifies &quot;three historical complexes which have had a decisively defining importance for contemporary evangelicals, especially in North America. These are the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, the Great Awakening of the 18th century, and the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy in the 20th century. The Protestant Reformation was a tremendous movement of ecclesial and spiritual renewal which has served historically as a benchmark for evangelical theology, devotion and, in some cases, even church governance. The Great Awakening, epitomized in the life and work of John and Charles Wesley, George Whitfield, and Jonathan Edwards, is an important paradigm not only because it combined an emphasis on the new birth with  reform of society, but also because it spawned three vital movements which continue to shape evangelical priorities to this day: the modern missionary crusade, the holiness movement and revivalism. The Fundamentalist-Modernist conflicts forced evangelicals to define themselves theologically and to forge an interdenominational coalition on this basis.&quot; Thus we now have the National Association of Evangelicals, founded in 1942 with the motto, &quot;cooperation without compromise.&quot; <BR>  Today we find a new and positive identity in the statement, &quot;In essentials, unity; in distinctives, liberty; in all things, charity.&quot;  <BR>  Today, eight core values are the foundation for the various ministries of the National Association of Evangelicals.  These core values are as follows: <BR>  1. Growing Biblical Faith. We believe in a biblical faith demonstrated by loyalty to the Word of God and commitment to proclaiming its message worldwide. <BR>  2. Fostering Cooperation. NAE promotes fellowship, cooperation, networking and dialogue as a means of evangelical witness representing and supporting autonomy of each local church, denomination, organization and institution. <BR>  3. Witness to Society. Confronting society with the relevance of the Gospel by being salt and by reflecting Christ's light is one of our missions. <BR>  4. Ministry to the Poor. We minister to the poor and hungry through physical aid and spiritual witness. <BR>  5. Attending to Human Concerns. We stand committed to biblically defined human values, the sanctity of human life, and human rights. <BR>  6. Cross Cultural Involvement. NAE celebrates the ethnic diversity in the world and will work to bring healing and involvement of the races in our ministry. <BR>  7. Maximizing Resources. NAE seeks the maximization and stewardship of all resources God has given to us. <BR>  8. Nurturing Communications. We will use media to engage our culture at every level with the absolute truth claims of the Gospel. <BR>  Our strategic plan for the dawn of the twenty-first century entitled An Evangelical Manifesto has been released and is available for you today. This document is directed toward revival and renewal in this nation and is based on the Great Commandment of John 13 &amp; 17 as an integral part of the Great Commission of Mark 16 and Matthew 28. Our manifesto provides the guide for operation of NAE's varied ministries and specifically calls for action in five areas: <BR>  1.  A call for prayer which is a prelude to effective ministry. <BR>  2.  A call for repentance and reform. <BR>  3.  A call for unity and cooperation. <BR>  4.  A call for evangelism. <BR>  5.  A call for cultural impact. <BR>  Currently, two major projects dealing with racial reconciliation and concern for persecuted Christians around the world are the focus of much attention. <BR>  In cooperation with the National Black Evangelical Association and with the assistance of Zondervan Publishing, a national effort has been launched and materials supplied to assist local churches in dealing with racial reconciliation. Copies of the materials that have been prepared can be supplied by contacting my office. <BR>  According to some of the nation's leading journalists, the persecution of Christians around the world may be the greatest human rights violation of this decade. In cooperation with the North American office of the World Evangelical Fellowship, 70,000 packets dealing with the problem of religious persecution were distributed to churches across the country. A twenty-minute video presentation was prepared that calls America's church leaders to petition the government to do something about these atrocities involving violations of conscience and also presented actual cases of severe religious persecution. Ten thousand copies of the video were distributed to churches and agencies across the nation. <BR>  Perhaps the world's best known evangelical, Billy Graham, stated in the epilogue of our evangelical manifesto the following, &quot;The world in our time is said to have made discipleship harder. But it has also made evangelism easier. Today's world is said to be multiplying crisis all around us. But we must never forget that, for the Gospel, each crisis is an opportunity. So it is important that we speak and act in  hope. The night has not yet fallen. The culture is far from closed. In our modern world, more people are more open at more moments in their lives than perhaps at any time in history. <BR>  &quot;Evangelicalism has a future to the extent that we evangelicals ourselves are drawn by the Gospel, are defined by the Gospel, and are declaring and demonstrating the Gospel of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, in word and deed.&quot; <BR>  Please feel free to visit us at our headquarters in Carol Stream or at our website: <A HREF=http://www.nae.net>http://www.nae.net.</A> We'll look forward to hearing from you. <BR> <I>Note: The National Association of Evangelicals is located at 450 Gundersen Drive, Carol Stream, Ill., 60188.

Medical rationing: Who lives and who dies?</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Rationing of organ transplants is becoming a reality in the United States</B>. A group that controls the allocation of liver transplants decided this week that dying patients with the best chance for survival will get top priority. Those who are just as ill but have less of a chance for survival will have lower priority. In the past, the sickest people were at the top of the list to receive new livers, regardless of their chance for survival.  <BR> <B>...People who have a sudden liver failure will be moved to the top of the list </B>because they usually do better after a transplant than those who have been ill for a long time. Others given top priority because of a higher success rate are those who just had a liver transplant that failed within seven days and children who would suffer damage to their nervous systems if they did not immediately get a transplant. <BR> <B>...The liver decision is a test case for medical rationing in general</B>, bioethicist Dr. Arthur Caplan of the University of Pennsylvania told <I>The New York Times</I>. &quot;All of us will have to confront the decision of what is fair in the allocation of scarce resources,&quot; he said. Last year, 7,279 people put their names on waiting lists for a liver, but only 3,922 liver transplants were performed. The decision to change priorities was made this week by the United Network for Organ Sharing, a private group of transplant experts overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.     </font></p>

Sermon turns into shouting match over homosexuality</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The pastor of a Michigan church who criticized two homosexual congregants from the pulpit</B> last Sunday plans to renew his attack at services this weekend, he told <I>The Detroit News</I>. Don Campbell, pastor of Watervliet's Congregational Church, criticized Kip Thumm, 28, who openly acknowledges his homosexuality. Thumm said he will be at services again this Sunday and expects to be accompanied by hundreds of supporters carrying picket signs and holding a candlelight vigil. <BR> <B>...Thumm said Campbell called him several days before last Sunday's service</B> and told him he was not  welcome at the church. Thumm, a lifelong church member, said his parents were married in the church, he went to Sunday school and Boy Scout meetings there, and that Campbell buried his father. &quot;I'm not going to let him keep me away,&quot; he said. <BR> <B>...During the service, when Campbell saw Thumm in a front pew accompanied by 30 supporters</B>, he changed the sermon topic from the importance of Veterans Day to homosexuality. The pastor said homosexuals should be cast out of God's house.  <BR> <B>...Then things got out of hand,</B> <I>The News</I> reported. A few of Thumm's supporters shouted, stood up, and pointed at Campbell. He responded by saying, &quot;This isn't an open forum&quot; and &quot;Read the Bible, young man!&quot; <BR> <B>...Then an elderly man grabbed the arm of one of Thumm's supporters, telling him to let the pastor finish talking</B>. When Campbell jumped down from the pulpit and tried to calm the elderly man, one of Thumm's supporters stood up and addressed the congregation, saying &quot;God loves us! Homosexuality is more than sex. It's about pride and identity!&quot; The man then burst into tears as he was escorted out. Another congregant rose and pointed his finger at Thumm's supporters, yelling that he hadn't come to &quot;listen to you people,&quot; but to worship God. Campbell managed to regain order, telling the congregants to &quot;go in peace.&quot;    </font></p>

Prisoners in Argentina spread revival</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Argentina's prison system is experiencing a spiritual revival,</B> according to Richard Riss, an American who was part of a group of 70 Christians visiting there recently. The center of the revival is Olmos prison, a maximum security facility. Approximately 1,400 of the 3,000 inmates -- including many former murderers, rapists, and thieves -- have become Christians, Riss said. <BR> <B>...The Olmos prisoners spend much of their time praying for worldwide revival</B>. While his group was visiting, several hundred prisoners held joint services with them. &quot;The prisoners prayed for us, and the Lord touched us all mightily,&quot; Riss said. <BR> <B>...People fax prayer requests to the prisoners</B>. Revivals in other prisons reportedly have begun<B> </B>after<B> </B>prisoners from Olmos are transferred there. <BR> <B>...Argentina has experienced revival since the 1980s</B>. In 1990, a change occurred when unusual spiritual manifestations described as &quot;drunkenness in the Spirit&quot; and &quot;holy laughter&quot; began. In 1993, those manifestations spread from Argentina to Canada after John and Carol Arnott of Toronto visited revival meetings in Argentina. Since then, the so-called &quot;Toronto Blessing&quot; has spread to other parts of the world. <BR> <B>...Children have played a role in Argentina's revival.</B> Riss attended a church service in Buenos Aires during which children led worship, gave testimonies of healings and conversions, and prayed for the sick. A visiting Swiss pastor who was suffering a 90% hearing loss received complete healing when an Argentine child, who had been unaware of the pastor's condition, prayed, &quot;Lord, open his ears,&quot; Riss said. The children also prayed for their classmates, hospital patients, and political leaders.    </font></p>

Evangelical leader addresses convention of National Council

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>For the first time, a president of the National Association of Evangelicals has formally addressed the general assembly of the National Council of Churches</B>. NAE President Don Argue spoke to the group this morning in Chicago, explaining the NAE's values and mission. The NAE represents many of the nation's theologically and politically conservative groups, while the NCC's 33 Protestant and Orthodox member organizations are more ecumenical and comparatively more liberal. <BR> <B>...The speech was &quot;an open invitation from them to get to know us,&quot;</B> the NAE's David Melvin told <I>Religion News Today</I>. The two organizations have no plans to form any &quot;structural unity,&quot; he said, but the NAE will cooperate with any group on significant issues &quot;as long as we can maintain our evangelical integrity.&quot; The NAE is &quot;moving cautiously&quot; so it will not endanger relationships it already has built among evangelicals, he said. <BR> <B>...NAE leaders considered the &quot;political land mines&quot; inherent in Argue's appearance</B> before the NCC, Melvin said. The speech gave Argue the opportunity to explain evangelicalism and &quot;bring the gospel to bear on broader communities.&quot; <BR> <B>...On Friday, Imam Wallace Deen Mohammed, leader of Al-Islam</B>, the largest orthodox African American Muslim movement, was to address an interfaith prayer breakfast at the NCC's general assembly.     </font></p>

Religious leaders will monitor violations of  freedom abroad
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The State Department named 20 religious leaders to a new committee advising the Clinton administration</B> on abuses of  religious liberty overseas. The leaders will look for ways religious groups can mediate conflicts, according to John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state and chair of the committee. Shattuck said his experience working with Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim leaders in Bosnia has shown him &quot;how important it is to stand up for religious freedom and tolerance.&quot; <BR> <B>...The committee includes Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Muslim, Jewish, and Baha'i clergy</B>. Also included are scholars who are experts in international conflict resolution, religious diversity, and the Holocaust. Two evangelicals joined the committee: Don Argue, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, and James Henry, pastor of First Baptist in Orlando and former head of the Southern Baptist Convention. <BR> <B>...Evangelicals had been pressing the administration to appoint a special advisor to focus specifically on persecution of Christians</B>. Instead, the State Department formed a committee with a broader mandate: to address human rights abuses against people of all religions. In the past several years, human-rights organizations have documented torture and killing of Christians, Buddhists, Bahai's, and Muslims. <BR> <B>...Critics said they were concerned the committee would gridlock</B> because its members have fundamental differences over the basic facts. &quot;If it turns out to be a sham, then we'll take appropriate action,&quot; Richard Cizik of the National Association of Evangelicals told <I>The Washington Post</I>. But until then, &quot;let's assume it's being done in good faith.&quot; Announcement of the committee was delayed until after the election because the White House wanted to avoid the perception it was trying to win favor in the religious community, <I>The Post</I> said. <BR> <B>...President Clinton should take the lead against religious persecution, </B>Cizik told <I>Religion News Today</I>. Clinton should &quot;use his bully pulpit&quot; to speak out personally, something he hasn't yet done, Cizik said. The NAE also will push for &quot;more straightforward&quot; discussion of religious rights violations in the State Department's annual human rights report and promote legislation ensuring better treatment for those seeking asylum in the United States, he said. <BR> <B>...Shattuck is expected to accompany Secretary of State Warren Christopher on a four-day visit to China</B> this weekend. He said Beijing's repression of Tibetan culture and religion is an example of an abusive international situation the advisory panel plans to investigate. Christopher plans to raise human rights concerns with Chinese leaders during his trip, U.S. officials said. <BR> <B>...In addition to Argue and Henry, the advisory committee on religious freedom abroad</B> includes: Joan Brown Campbell, National Council of Churches of Christ; Diana L. Eck, Harvard University; Wilma M. Ellis, Baha'is of the Americas; Irving Greenberg, National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership; Frederick Calhoun James, African Methodist Episcopal Church; Leonid Kishkovsky, Orthodox Church of America; Samuel Billy Kyles, Memorial Baptist Church, Memphis, Tenn.; Deborah E. Lipstadt, Emory University; David Little, U.S. Institute of Peace; Laila Al-Marayati, Muslim Women's League; Theodore E. McCarrick, Archbishop of Newark; Wallace Deen Mohammed, Society of Muslim Americans; Russel Marion Nelson, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Ricardo Ramirez, Bishop of Las Cruces, N.M.; Barnett Richard Rubin, Council on Foreign Relations; Nina Shea, Puebla Project of Freedom House; Elliot Sperling, Indiana University; and Archbishop Spyridon of America, Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.    </font></p>

Violent, troubled young people find a new kind of gang in
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A group of former gang members in Boston says their new faith in Christ has helped them avoid drugs and violence</B>. The group, which calls itself God's Posse, is made up of about 25 young black men who once were among the city's most dangerous gangsters. &quot;These are extreme individuals,&quot; Posse co-founder Richard Williamson, a public school math teacher and church deacon, told <I>The Boston Globe</I>. <BR> <B>...Posse members don't drink, smoke, do drugs, or carry weapons</B>. Instead, they pray and worship together in a house they call the Holy House, and take their message to others at a YMCA. Members also try to abstain from sex until marriage, although they say the temptations are numerous. <BR> <B>...Half the Posse members recently left prison, and some encountered God while behind bars</B>. Williamson and co-founder Chris Womack, who used to sell drugs and weapons, started the ministry by talking to prisoners. Many did not listen to their message about God, but some did. Former gangsters say they were just tired of running away from the police. Their lives were violent and lonely, and the Posse has been as close to a stable family as they have ever had. <BR> <B>...Trusting God in the inner-city often takes courage.</B> Posse members say God protects them from harm, describing how bullets have narrowly missed them and guns pointed at their heads have jammed. Three Posse members once intentionally walked into a crowd of boys who were archenemies of their old gang. The boys reached for their guns, but the incident ended with everyone praying and holding hands, <I>The Globe</I> said. Another young man tells how he was baptized by a former gang member he once tried to kill. <BR> <B>...Friends tell the Posse members they'll be back to their old ways in six months.</B> But the young men say that, although their path is littered with temptations, they refuse to let it happen.    </font></p>

Congress will consider altering tax exemptions for nonprofit

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Tax exemptions granted to nonprofit groups could change dramatically in the upcoming Congress</B> if  U.S. Rep. Nancy Johnson gets her way. The Connecticut Republican, who was narrowly re-elected last week to a seventh term, heads a House Ways and Means subcommittee that monitors the Internal Revenue Service. She plans to hold &quot;very in-depth&quot; hearings to determine if the exemptions are warranted and make any necessary changes in the tax code, she told <I>The Chronicle of Philanthropy.</I>  <BR> <B>...Tax laws have not kept up with the way some nonprofits operate</B>, and some nonprofits receiving tax benefits act more like advocacy groups and lobbyists, she said. Although the law bars nonprofits from devoting a large part of their efforts to lobbying and prohibits participation in partisan campaigns, they are allowed to inform the public about specific issues. Johnson said, however, that some nonprofits cross the line from education to politics.   <BR> <B>...Since it is hard to draw the line between education and advocacy, </B>Johnson wants Congress to create subcategories of charities and provide different taxes to each<B>. </B>Johnson said nonprofits that give direct services, such as soup kitchens or museums, should be placed in a separate category with different tax laws from those whose main activity is education on various issues.    </font></p>

Slave-trading in Sudan</H3>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Children are being made into slaves on a massive scale in Sudan</B>, Christian Solidarity International alleges. The Swiss-based organization said tens of thousands of children have been abducted in raids permitted by the African nation's Islamic government. The government, based in Khartoum, has battled the Southern-based Sudan People's Liberation Army, composed of Christian and animist rebels, for 13 years. The rebels are demanding more autonomy from the Islamic-oriented government. More than 1 million people have died in the conflict. <BR> <B>...Tens of thousands of African children have been abducted from their families</B> in raids approved by Khartoum and are enslaved in the North, said CSI's Hans Stuckelberger. A Protestant pastor, Stuckelberger made his charges last week in a letter to the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights.  <BR> <B>...Christian Solidarity official John Eibner made a clandestine visit to Sudan last month</B>, Reuters news service said. Eibner was able to purchase and free 58 slaves, who told him they had been forced to assume a Muslim identity and were often beaten, the report said. <BR> <B>...According to United Nations human rights official Gaspar Biro</B>, who visited Sudan in August, the Sudanese army has been ordered to collect women and the elderly -- as well as children -- and take them to government-controlled areas. <BR> <B>...Khartoum has said it is concerned about the charges</B>. The government reportedly has appointed an investigative committee and has opened a center for traumatized children.    </font></p>

Tragedy of immense proportions worsens in Central Africa</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The huge scale of the tragedy in central Africa became increasingly clear Friday</B> as the international community desperately tried to find a way to get 1 million stranded Rwandan Hutu refugees back home from Zaire. Thousands of the refugees -- who are cut off from the outside world by a complex war in eastern Zaire -- were dying of hunger, thirst, and poisonous gases on lava fields. Western aid organizations warned that hundreds of thousands of people would die before help arrived.   <BR> <B>...The situation is a stalemate</B>. Tutsi-led Rwanda wants the innocent, civilian Hutus to come home; they comprise 95% of the refugees. But 5% of the refugees are Rwandan Hutu militiamen who fled their homeland in 1994 after killing 800,000 Tutsis. They refuse to go home, where they would face the wrath of the Tutsis who survived. The militiamen, who are still armed, are rampaging through eastern Zaire looting camps and villages. They also are guarding what is left of the refugee camps and have denied access to outsiders. Meanwhile, Zaire, tired of its destabilizing refugee burden, wants the Hutus out and will not allow aid workers to feed them. <BR> <B>...&quot;Soldiers and wrong ones are the ones most likely to survive</B>. The innocent women, children and the old are first to die,&quot; Fernando Rodriguez of Doctors of the World told Reuters. Many refugees are hiding in the jungle,<B> </B>according to an aid worker for Action for Churches Together. He flew a plane over the crowds, who were robbing each other. Food riots were occurring in the rebel-held eastern Zaire city of Goma on Friday. Rebels fired into the air to beat back 1,000 hungry people fighting for the last food in a U.N. warehouse.   <BR> <B>...In addition to the Rwandan Hutu refugees, many others are roaming over eastern Zaire. </B>They include demoralized soldiers from Zaire's ragged army, stranded in a growing rebellion against President Mobutu Ssese Seko. Zairian soldiers fired into the air and stole equipment from Mission Aviation Fellowship on Thursday, according to Herman van Heuvelen, MAF's operation manager in Uganda. Also, three Spanish priests were killed Thursday in the eastern Zairean city of Bukavu, Reuters reported. A number of Spanish priests, nuns, missionaries, and air workers remained in Zaire, unable or unwilling to leave the country. A worker from the British group Christian Aid who flew over the area said he saw semi-deserted villages and normally busy roads that now are empty. <BR> <B>...Aid agencies say they have all the supplies needed to save the refugees -- but no way to get to them.</B> No huge aid airlift is needed as it was in 1994, when Rwanda's genocide caused a mass exodus. After wars in Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Burundi, East Africa has a massive aid structure, with much of the food stockpiled in neighboring countries such as Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. <BR> <B>...The latest proposal was to create an international military force to protect the corridors</B> through which the refugees could be safely repatriated. Rwanda told the United Nations that it opposed any army contingent from France, the main advocate for military intervention. Any such force must be neutral, said Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimunga.      </font></p>

Christian leaders to fast and pray for revival</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>More than 2,000 Christian leaders and laypeople will gather in St. Louis Nov. 14-16 to pray for revival</B> in the United States and the world. Hundreds more will meet at 102 satellite locations -- most of them in churches -- where they will follow along with the event, broadcast live from the America's Center. <BR> <B>...&quot;The United States is one of the most sinful nations in the world,&quot; </B>said <A HREF=http://www.ccci.org/>Campus Crusade for Christ</A> founder Bill Bright, who is leading the event for the third consecutive year. Fasting &amp; Prayer '96 is being organized by Mission America, an interdenominational coalition of organizations, individuals, and churches. Previous Fasting &amp; Prayer events have taken place in Orlando, Fla., and Los Angeles. <BR> <B>...After winning the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion in March,</B> Bright said he would use the $1.1 million award to promote fasting and prayer worldwide. This is the first time the event has been broadcast live to remote satellite locations. <BR> <B>...&quot;As Christians we have been unfaithful to God and our responsibilities,&quot;</B> Bright said. But he says the situation is not hopeless. &quot;We are confident that God wants to spare our nation. We believe He is going to send a great spiritual awakening to North America and the world before the end of the year 2000.&quot; <BR> <B>...Sessions during the three-day event </B>will consist of various speakers followed by prayer focused on topics such as churches, families, government leaders, evangelism, and youth. <BR> <B>...Organizers of the St. Louis event include:</B> Don Argue, president of the <A HREF=http://www.nae.net/>National Association of Evangelicals</A>; author Kay Arthur; Charles Blake of  the West Angeles Church of God in Christ; Bright's wife, Vonette; David Bryant of <A HREF=http://www.pfi.org./>Concerts of Prayer</A> International; Paul Cedar of Mission America; Franklin Graham of Samaritan's Purse; Larry Lewis of  the Home Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention; <A HREF=http://www.promisekeepers.org/>Promise Keepers</A> founder Bill McCartney; <A HREF=http://www.apu.edu/>Azusa Pacific University</A> dean Jesse Miranda; broadcaster Pat Robertson; Baptist pastor Adrian Rogers; <A HREF=http://www.apu.edu/>Moody Bible Institute</A> President Joseph Stowell; and Assemblies of God leader Thomas Trask. <BR> <B>...More than 140 Christian leaders have lent their support and encouragement to the event. </B>They include Ted Baehr of the Christian Film and Television Commission; pollster George Barna; Henry Blackaby, author of the <I>Experiencing God</I> Bible study; pastor Wellington Boone; Charles Colson of <A HREF=http://www.pfi.org./>Prison Fellowship</A>; Paul Crouch of <A HREF=http://www.tbn.org/>Trinity Broadcasting Network</A>; Youth With A Mission founder Loren Cunningham; James and Shirley Dobson of Focus on the Family; Ted Engstrom of World Vision; Eddie Fox of the World Methodist Council; Brandt Gustafson of the National Religious Broadcasters; Jack Hayford of the Church on the Way; educator and author Howard Hendricks; pastor E.V.

</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Religious leaders agree with each other on the state of the church and the nation</B>, pollster George Gallup found. Gallup's Princeton Religion Research Center conducted confidential interviews with 25 well known church leaders, seminary presidents, writers, and commentators. <BR> <B>...American culture is steadily deteriorating</B>, the leaders said. Society is fragmenting as people pursue self-interest, which often involves materialism and consumerism. Computers continue to drive Americans into isolation and loneliness, the leaders said. Evidences of societal decay are numerous. They include the flight of the father, deterioration of families, an increasing number of children born out of wedlock, trouble in public schools, and poverty. Some 39 million people -- including 22% of all children -- live in poverty. <BR> <B>...Increasingly, community life is shunned</B>. Thus, society is in danger of splintering into many special interest groups, each pursuing its own cause and distrusting others, the leaders said.  <BR> <B>...An intellectual mood called post-modernism also is growing</B>. This includes a loss of respect for truth. The objective moral order is considered to be merely a product of one's opinions or personal preferences.  <BR> <B>...The spiritual bankruptcy of the era has caused a spiritual hunger, </B>and leaders wonder in what ways it will be satisfied. Post-modern thought says all forms of spirituality -- including Christianity -- are equally valid. This outlook is resulting in a fragmentation of the Western religious heritage, the leaders said.  <BR> <B>...At this time of societal crisis, traditional religion has a great opportunity</B> to influence spiritual seekers. But the church may not be up to the task, the leaders observed. Deepening of faith requires intellectual discipline and moral self-sacrifice, and most churches today encourage neither, they said. Success will depend on orthodox preaching and teaching, small-group development, and powerful worship experiences, the leaders said.    <BR>           </font></p>

Colorado rejects real estate taxes for churches</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>In addition to choosing a President, American voters on Tuesday decided a record 91 statewide measures</B>, the most since the initiative process began in 1904. Here is a roundup of results in measures closely watched by religious voters: <BR> <B>...Real estate taxation of churches was defeated. </B>Colorado voters defeated by an 83-17 margin a measure that had sent shivers through the state's religious and tax-exempt communities.<B> </B>The proposed change to the state constitution, Amendment 11, would have required churches and other nonprofit groups to pay property taxes. Voters rejected it 83%-17%. If the amendment had passed, it would have stripped most real estate tax exemptions from churches and nonprofit organizations, while keeping the tax-exempt status of nonprofit schools and property being used to &quot;house low-income elderly, disabled, homeless, or abused persons.&quot; <BR> <B>...Parental rights amendment was defeated. </B>Fifty-eight percent of Colorado voters turned down an amendment to the state's Bill of Rights that would have enshrined the right of  parents to &quot;direct and control the upbringing, education, values and discipline of their children.&quot; Debate had been whether the amendment would have helped or hurt children. Colorado was a test state for the controversial amendment, backed primarily by Of The People, an Arlington, Va., organization. Opponents such as teachers, social workers, and the American Civil Liberties Union said the amendment would make it harder to prosecute child abuse cases and lead to fights over what is taught in schools. Proponents said parents are losing control over their children to schools and the government. <BR> <B>...Gambling results are mixed. </B>Nine states voted on gambling. Here are the results: <br>   <B>Arizona: </B>Approved a measure to permit more Indian casinos. <br> <B> Arkansas:</B> Turned down a state lottery, legalization of charitable bingo, and authorization of up to three casinos in Hot Springs. <br> <B> Colorado: </B>Rejected gambling in the city of Trinidad. <br> <B> Louisiana: </B>Six parishes with the state's 14 riverboat gambling kept it, and 23 others voted to allow it for the first time. Thirty of the state's 64 parishes kept video poker, while 34 rejected it.  <br> <B> Michigan:</B> Passed a statewide proposal to permit up to three casinos in Detroit. Michigan also rejected a ban on bingo for political fund-raisers. <br>  <B>Nebraska:</B> Rejected a constitutional amendment to allow off-track betting. <br>  <B>Ohio:</B> For the second time in six years, voters rejected a plan to put eight riverboat casinos in four counties. Gov. George Voinovich commented that voters saw through the &quot;slick ads, false claims, and deceptive messages&quot; of the gambling industry. <br>  <B>Washington:</B> Rejected a measure to allow up to 500 slot machines at Indian casinos. <br>  <B>West Virginia: </B>Jefferson County allowed video gambling at Charles Town racetrack. <BR> <B>...Marijuana was approved as a prescription drug. </B>In California, mercy for the sick outweighed worries over drug abuse. Voters approved by a 56-44 margin a proposition legalizing marijuana, allowing doctors to prescribe it to fight pain in serious illness. Proposition 215 legalizes the cultivation, possession, and use of cannabis with a doctor's authorization. If the proposition survives court challenges, it would legalize marijuana for the first time since the early part of the century. Police opposed the proposal, warning that unscrupulous physicians would take advantage of it. Opponents plan to fight for tight scrutiny of prescriptions and tough penalties for abusers. <BR> <B>...Liberal won the Washington governorship. </B>In the governor's race in Washington, avowedly liberal Democrat Gary Locke beat Republican Ellen Craswell, who opposes abortion, calls homosexuality sinful, and vowed to fill government with &quot;godly&quot; people. The margin was 59% to 41%. Craswell's campaign had been backed by 2,000 conservative religious volunteers. <BR> <B>...Woman won a Louisiana Senate seat. </B>In a close race, Democrat Mary Landrieu edged Republican Rep. Woody Jenkins to become Louisiana's first female senator. Landrieu, who is pro-choice on the abortion issue, overcame a warning from Catholic Archbishop Philip Hannan that voting for her would be a sin. Jenkins is a 49-year-old Christian conservative. <BR> <B>...Across the country, 16% of voters identified themselves as members of the religious right</B>, while 80% said they were not. Some 38% of voters said they were Protestant, 29% Catholics, and 17% part of another Christian denomination. Three percent said they were Jewish and 8% said they had no religion. In a separate question, about 5% of voters identified themselves as homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual. These figures were complied from television networks and newspaper wire services.    </font></p>

Conflicts arise between prayer groups, neighbors</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>At a time when churches are encouraging home-based prayer groups, conflicts with neighbors </B>are arising around the nation. <BR> <B>...After one angry neighbor complained about cars and late-night noise, </B>the city of Pleasant Hill, Calif., told Charlie and Betty Peissner to get a permit or stop holding meetings in their living room. The Peissners, charismatic Catholic grandparents who have been hosting prayer meetings for 26 years, have an average of 30 visitors each Wednesday, though the number may go as high as 50. The meetings include singing, praying, speaking in tongues, and healing. They end about 10 p.m., but some people have stayed until 1 a.m. One night this summer, a young child from the meeting cried late at night and a car blocked a driveway, Betty Peissner acknowledged. <BR> <B>...The Peissners have apologized to their neighbors</B> for that incident, and now ask guests to leave by 11 p.m. But the couple refuses to comply with the city and ask for a permit. &quot;We could lose everything if that's what it takes,&quot; Betty Peissner told <I>Religion News Today</I>. &quot;We are prepared to stand our ground.&quot;<B> </B>The September deadline set by the city to apply for the permit has come and gone. <BR> <B>...The city's code enforcement officer says the Peissners are running a religious institution. </B>Keith Hunt noted that the meetings involve a regular congregation gathering on a particular day of the week and  performing a traditional ceremony. He sent letters Sept. 6 and 19 advising the Peissners that they need a permit like those issued to large child-care facilities. <BR> <B>...The Peissners disagree,</B> saying they do not have a regular membership and do not take up a collection. They say they are just welcoming guests into their home to sing and praise God.  <BR> <B>...Similar prayer group-neighbor conflicts have appeared elsewhere in the country</B>. According to attorney David Melton of the Rutherford Institute, a religious rights group, there have been several cases in which Hassidic Jews in New York were ordered to stop holding Sabbath worship. Also, a North Carolina man was told to stop meeting for prayer with two or three other people in his home on Sundays and a small group of Florida ministers were told they could not meet in a home. <BR> <B>...Underlying the tensions is &quot;a vendetta against religion,&quot;</B> Melton told <I>RNT</I>. Many people consider religion as &quot;the pornography of the '90s&quot; -- something that should stay behind closed doors and not be spoken about or enter civic life, he said. Inappropriately noisy prayer groups should be treated like noisy beer parties -- call the police, Melton said. But requiring a permit for a prayer meeting is prior restraint that limits the free exercise of religion. <BR>         </font></p>

Religion, morality important issues in races</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Issues related to religion and morality play key roles in Tuesday's balloting</B>. Americans will vote in races for president, U.S. Senate, U.S. House of Representatives, and governors. Voters also are taking action on 90 initiatives in 20 states and the District of Columbia. <BR> <B>...During the campaign, President Clinton openly expressed his religious faith.</B> A Southern Baptist who attends Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C., Clinton speaks about religion often, using biblical phrases and allusions. The President confers regularly with several pastors, and reads books on spiritual topics. He takes a Bible to services, follows along with the readings, and takes notes in the margins, said James Dunn of the Baptist Joint Committee. Clinton, who loves music, has been seen with tears rolling down his face during hymns. <BR> <B>...The President has cast himself as a unifier</B>, saying that Republicans in the White House would be a source of social division. In Tampa, Fla., last weekend, from the pulpit of  St. Paul's African Episcopal Methodist Church, Clinton said some people seek to divide society by &quot;driving wedges between us and exploiting our fears and convincing us that our brothers and sisters of different races, different faiths, different walks of life, are our inherent enemies.&quot; <BR> <B>...But some of Clinton's actions evoked anger from evangelicals</B>, who say they can't believe he is a Christian because of his support for homosexual rights and legal abortion. The President's veto of a bill banning partial-birth abortions prompted a condemnation from his own denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention. The SBC expressed disapproval of Clinton's suggestion that God &quot;could have revealed to him in prayer&quot; that abortion is acceptable.   <BR> <B>...Republican challenger Bob Dole, a United Methodist, rarely speaks about his faith</B>. Dole started attending Sunday school at age three and taught it as a young man, <I>USA Today</I> said. In an interview with <I>World</I> magazine, Dole said he reads the Bible &quot;sometimes.&quot; His wife, Elizabeth, is known for speaking freely about her faith. Dole supports a constitutional amendment to ban abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the woman is at risk. He has said Clinton cannot provide the moral leadership the nation needs.  <BR> <B>...Control of Congress also is up for grabs this year. </B>Two years ago, Republican conservatives became the majority in Congress for the first time in 40 years, resulting in passage of a number of key conservative pieces of legislation. That could change after Tuesday. <BR> <B>...Also, measures to legalize gambling are on the ballots in seven states</B>. Initiatives would make gambling legal in Detroit and permit riverboat casinos on Ohio waterways. Other gambling initiatives are being decided in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, and Washington. <BR> <B>...Colorado voters will decide on a measure that would eliminate the real estate property tax exemption for churches</B>. Radio talk-show host John Patrick Michael Murphy, a critic of organized religion, is on a crusade to tax churches and nonprofit organizations. If the measure passes, some churches say they would go out of business. Numerous evangelical groups are based in Colorado Springs. <BR> <B>...Parental rights also is a hot issue in Colorado. </B>Voters will decide on a measure that would give parents the right to &quot;direct and control the upbringing, education, values, and discipline of their children.&quot; Proponents, who include Dole, say the measure would strengthen the rights of parents in controlling child rearing and the curriculum in public schools. Opponents say the measure would open the door to parental abuse and make it hard to prosecute child-abuse cases. Opponents also say the measure would delay the decisions of school boards, allow parents to demand the teaching of creationism, and stop confidential drug, alcohol, and birth-control counseling. Similar amendments are pending in 28 states, and a bill is awaiting action in Congress. <BR> <B>...On the ballot in California is a measure to allow doctors to prescribe marijuana</B> to some patients to relieve pain. That would open the door to legalization of the drug, critics say. The measure is being closely watched in other states. <BR> <B>...The governor's race in Washington presents a distinct choice to voters</B>. King County executive Gary Locke, 46, a Yale-educated Democrat who is the son of Chinese immigrants, faces former state Senate president Ellen Craswell, 64, a conservative Christian Republican grandmother. Craswell says she will use &quot;God's plan&quot; to run the state and dismantle portions of government not justified by Scripture. She says government should phase out welfare programs and that churches and nonprofit groups should take over. Craswell, who has 12 home-schooled grandchildren, criticizes public schools for not giving parents enough control. Locke, a Baptist, says he wants a distinct line between church and state. <BR> <B>...The Christian Coalition said it distributed 45 million voter guides in 125,000 churches nationwide</B> and contacted three million to five million voters in person or by telephone during the campaign. The guides compare the stands of Democratic and Republican candidates on issues such as abortion, prayer in public schools, and homosexuals in the military. Critics say they overwhelmingly favor Republicans.    </font></p>

Presbyterian Church allows minister who had sex change</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A woman who was ordained as a man in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) before undergoing a sex change</B> has been allowed to retain her ordination. The Presbytery of Greater Atlanta voted in favor of Erin Swenson, a 48-year old father of two adult daughters, formerly known as Eric Swenson. <BR> <B>...Swenson, who was ordained in 1973, has been a private marriage therapist for 12 years</B>. Previous jobs held by Swenson include a position as instructor at the Candler School of Theology, a United Methodist seminary at Emory University in Atlanta, Ecumenical News International reported. <BR> <B>...It is believed to be the world's first case of a mainstream church body giving official recognition</B> to a transsexual, Reuters news service said. Anne Sayre, the presbytery associate for justice and women, told ENI that the presbytery decided it had no theological or moral ground to revoke the ordination. <BR> <B>...Swenson's former wife and father-in-law support the request for continued ordination status</B>. &quot;A wounded healer can be the best kind of minister,&quot; O.H. Lyon said.  <BR> <B>...&quot;This individual is a male,&quot; </B>said Wade, a minister who voted against Swenson's request. Wade insisted that Swenson's &quot;gender identify confusion&quot; can be &quot;healed by the power of the Spirit of God,&quot; ENI said. <BR> <B>..&quot;There was no serious discussion of theological issues,&quot; </B>said Wade, acknowledging that the denomination's Book of Order does not address the subject. A lot of people in the presbytery are upset about the outcome, he said.    </font></p>

<B>Political and spiritual challenges face the church in Hong Kong as China's takeover approaches</B>. Christians see
opportunities for church renewal as well as openness to the gospel among their friends, co-workers, and society's
leaders, said David Wang of Hong Kong-based Asian Outreach (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/041596.html">NIRR 4/15</A>). 
<BR><B>...Hong Kong residents are less fearful of the July 1997 takeover than Westerners are, said Sam Ling of the Institute
for Chinese Studies at the Billy Graham Center for World Evangelism in Wheaton, Ill</B>. Many of the younger
generation feel a connection to China and have adopted a pragmatic outlook, preparing to be regulated as well as
to minister to the mainland, he said.
<BR><B>...Christian leaders are grappling with political implications of the takeover</B>. China has asked church leaders to show
their support for reunification by participating in the selection of Hong Kong's new governor and involving their
congregations in China's National Day Celebration, Oct. 1. If the churches participate, the Chinese government will
gain a lot of recognition and respect, Wang told NIRR. But the Hong Kong church never has been political and
Christians are not sure how to proceed. Some see an opportunity to have a voice in the new government, but others
fear the church will be compromised. 
<BR><B>...China has promised not to interfere in internal affairs of the church</B>. But Communist officials will observe affairs
in Hong Kong, where more than half of the schools, hospitals, and social services are run by churches. Chinese
policy states that Hong Kong and mainland churches may not interfere in each other's business, which could put
limits on Hong Kong-based evangelism efforts, said Feliciano Carion of the Christian Conference of Asia. But
ministries that are sensitive, service-oriented, and adaptive to the changing social, political, and economic scene will
succeed, Wang said. 
<BR><B>...Hong Kong is thriving spiritually</B>. An unanticipated effect of the takeover is that many older leaders have left and
most of Hong Kong's 1,300 churches are led by pastors under 30. Most of their predecessors came from China after
the Communist takeover in 1949, while the younger pastors were born in Hong Kong and have more of a
commitment to it. They also are less denominational and more open to evangelistic cooperation, Wang said.
<BR><B>...More than 300 churches have formed in the past three years and cell groups have exploded, Wang said</B>. Churches
hold prayer rallies and minicrusades in each of Hong Kong's 19 districts. Capture Today is an ongoing city-wide
crusade sponsored by local churches that features speakers in Hong Kong's largest stadium. More than 800 churches
participated in the March for Jesus last year and churches are cooperating in an effort to mail gospel booklets to 1.5
million households, followed by visits from Christians. 
<BR><B>..."There are 1.2 billion people in China who share our culture and in less than 360 days that barrier to spread the
gospel will be removed," said Cecil Chan of the Hong Kong Baptist Convention</B>. Evangelism of mainland China
could be the beginning of a new wave of world outreach. Church-growth expert C. Peter Wagner predicted that
China will be the largest missionary-sending country in the world by 2025. "Few people are as open and aggressive
in their faith as the Chinese Christians," said Atlanta-based apologist Ravi Zacharias, who recently addressed 400
Hong Kong businessmen. "The way China goes will shape the world definitively for the next century." NIRR

<B>Seven hundred thousand people have attended services at Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Fla., since
a spiritual outpouring began there on Father's Day in 1995 (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/031896.html">NIRR 3/18</A>)</B>. Some 25,000 people have made professions
of faith in Christ at the services, conducted Wednesday through Sunday each week, with a corporate intercessory
prayer meeting on Tuesdays. Dozens of people who become Christians at the services are baptized on Friday nights
at Brownsville AG and many neighboring churches. Those professing faith in Christ include the well-to-do, as well
as drug addicts, witches, prostitutes, and Satanists, who have attempted to curse the preacher and the congregation.
<BR><B>...Visitors continue to come from across the country and foreign nations</B>. Linda Fussel, a local travel agent, books
about 1,000 flights a week for people attending the Pensacola services.
<BR><B>...Each night, the crowd arrives several hours early, sitting or kneeling quietly until the 7 p.m</B>. service. After an hour
of praise-and-worship music, testimonies, and preaching, evangelist Steve Hill gives an invitation to profess Christ.
Others are invited to come forward for prayer and the laying on of hands. Unusual physical manifestations -- such
as falling down, head shaking, and jerking -- continue, but are neither downplayed nor encouraged, one observer said.
Some services end at midnight while others last until sunrise. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Many who have been "drenched in renewal rains" in Melbourne, Fla., are evangelizing others and helping the poor
(<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12/95</A>)</B>. "The long-term fruit is definitely the finest I've tasted in 20 years of ministry," said Michael
Thompson, senior pastor at Tabernacle Church, an interdenominational, charismatic congregation. Special services
that began Jan. 1, 1995, continue on Friday nights.
<BR><B>....Nine churches run a sidewalk Sunday school and give away groceries and clothing at housing projects</B>. Nearly
$60,000 was given through the Melbourne Renewal organization to Habitat for Humanity and ministries that aid the
homeless, AIDS patients, and addicts. For the second year, pastors, musicians, and prayer teams will lead a
conference in Honduras.
<BR><B>...Unity across denominations continues to grow as a result of the services</B>. Last year, nearly 3,000 people attended
a prayer service led by pastors from 20 churches. Pastors meet monthly to pray for one another's ministries, and 40
pastors recently attended the fourth pastors' prayer summit. On Friday evenings, area pastors or a person involved
in renewal in another area of the world address the Melbourne Renewal group. NIRR 08/05/96
<P>
<B>Nearly 862,000 men have attended the 17 Promise Keepers conferences so far this year; five more stadium events
are planned</B>. The largest 1996 conference drew 70,490 to the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich. (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/062496.html">NIRR 6/24</A>). Nine of
the conferences include separate gatherings for the sons of PK conference participants. In addition to its stadium
conferences, PK also is holding 450 local and regional seminars, training sessions, and smaller "wake-up call"
conferences in all 50 states and seven Canadian provinces. The group has offices in 38 states and affiliations in
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.  
<BR><B>...The men's group confirmed it will hold a prayer meeting of a million men on the Mall in Washington, D.C., in
the fall of 1997</B>. No date has been set for the event, which has been under consideration for several years. Local
events, seminars, and stadium conferences also are planned for next year. 
<BR><B>...PK stopped marketing and distributing the controversial book The Masculine Journey: Understanding the Six Stages
of Manhood (NavPress) by Robert Hicks</B>. PK said Hicks' "core theology is consistent with orthodox evangelical
Christianity" but several passages "could be understood in more than one way." The book, which was given to every
man who attended the 1993 conference in Boulder, Colo., describes theories of spiritual growth and change.
Controversy surrounding it has been a distraction, PK said. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Greg Laurie's three-day Harvest Crusade drew 50,000 people to Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, Calif., last
month</B>. A total of 4,700 people -- including 13 stadium employees -- came forward to profess faith in Christ. Among
the speakers was former San Diego Padre Dave Dravecky. After he lost his pitching arm to cancer five years ago,
Dravecky founded a ministry to encourage cancer victims and amputees (NIRR 5/31/93). NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Thousands of people prayed for spiritual and moral revival in Costa Rica during A Cry to God, held at La Sabana
Park in San Jose</B>. Local church leaders, Christians, and U.S.-based evangelist Alberto Mottesi prayed for six hours.
<BR><B>...Mottesi later preached in nearby Turrialba</B>. Each night, 200-400 people became Christians in the town, which has
15 congregations and fewer than 2,000 believers, the Alberto Mottesi Evangelistic Association said. Homosexuals
and alcoholics prayed to receive Christ and lead new lives, and about 200 children became Christians during youth
services, the evangelist said. City streets were empty as 5,000 people, including the mayor and the town witch,
attended one evening service, according to local pastors. A local news reporter transmitted the crusade meetings live
and free of charge to surrounding areas. NIRR 08/05/96
<P>
<B>American evangelists used mime, dance, and music to tell the gospel story at Fiesta del Fuego, a Caribbean music
festival in Cuba last month</B>. Singers performed a Spanish version of Steve Green's He Holds the Key, while actors
portrayed Christ's victory over death. Since religious themes -- mostly voodoo and the occult -- were included in
the festival, the troupe felt justified in presenting the Christian faith, one team leader told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...An 18-member performing troupe associated with the Mansfield, Ohio-based Alliance for Renewal Churches spent
17 days performing in Cuba</B>. Because the evangelical church is under persecution (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/072296.html">NIRR 7/22</A>), concerts could not
be arranged in advance, "but we were amazed how day by day we received invitations" to perform, the team leader
said. Since an aggressive evangelism team recently had been expelled from the country, the troupe toned down its
performances and "worked to make contacts so we could be invited back," the leader said. After performances, the
team handed out Bibles and talked individually with audience members about Christ. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Some 150,000 Christians are helping people in crisis through Stephen Ministries</B>. Developed in 1975 by Lutheran
pastor Kenneth Haugk, the St. Louis-based ministry is named after Saint Stephen, one of seven people commissioned
by the Apostles to care for the early Christians.
<BR><B>...Churches send a few members to a seven-day seminar to learn how to set up, administer, and maintain a local
ministry, news reports said</B>. Then they select others from their churches to become Stephen Ministers, giving them
50 hours of training in areas such as listening skills and hospital visitation. Stephen Ministers meet every week, or
as required with people in need. Everything said to a Stephen Minister is confidential.
<BR><B>...Stephen Ministers are not counselors and do not fix problems or manipulate people toward certain decisions, Haugk
said</B>. They mostly just listen and help the person reach a solution to their problem on their own.  NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Volunteers have prayed with 80,000 telephone callers since the Assemblies of God 1-800-4 PRAYER line began
taking calls in 1994 (NIRR 12/26/94)</B>. Two hundred people have become Christians, marriages have been restored,
jobs have been provided, physical healings have occurred, financial needs have been met, and people have been
delivered from drugs in answer to prayers, said Sandra Clopine, coordinator of the National Prayer Center. 
<BR><B>...Volunteers don't counsel callers, but simply pray with them</B>. They record only their first names and the state from
which they are calling. The most frequent topics for prayer are relationship problems and physical needs. Many
callers are involved with New Age beliefs, and some say they are Christians but live grossly immoral lifestyles,
Clopine said. Some have called the center from cellular phones while driving behind a car with a NPC bumper
sticker. Local Assemblies of God churches around the country are beginning to receive overflow calls from the
Prayer Center, located in Springfield, Mo. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Several Salvation Army groups have cut affiliations with the United Way in the last few years after having their
funding severely reduced</B>. Groups that have left the United Way include affiliates in Washington, D.C., West Palm
Beach and Key West, Fla., New Bern, N.C., and Harrisonburg, Va., Salvation Army spokesman Tom Jones said.
<BR><B>...In Washington, the UW increased the number of agencies it funds from 260 to 850, giving a smaller slice of the
pie to The Salvation Army, the American Red Cross, and the Boy Scouts</B>. Some of the new agencies help the poor,
while others deal with the environment and art. "The donors wanted a choice," said Brian Ferguson of the
Metropolitan Washington United Way. "There are other people out there doing God's work, and The Salvation Army
has to recognize that," he told NIRR. The Washington Salvation Army will try to make up the money by directly
asking businesses and the public for contributions. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Assemblies of God volunteers are giving away groceries and preaching to impoverished people in several Western
and Central states</B>. The outreaches, called Convoys of Hope, are scheduled in 50 cities in the next 12-18 months.
<BR><B>...Meeting people's material and spiritual needs is a powerful expression of the gospel, organizers say</B>. "We've been
at crusades where the altar call is given and people respond, but you wonder whether or not their salvation
experience is long-lasting or sincere," said Hal Donaldson, president of the ChurchCare America ministry. "As I
wandered through the people who flocked to the altars, the number with tears flowing was remarkable." The convoys
also include praise-and-worship music and gospel messages. In Fontana, Calif., 19 churches worked together to make
the outreach a success. Volunteers cheered when they learned that 2,000 decision cards were turned in. NIRR

<B>The number of new Catholic priests is growing on every continent except North America and Europe, according to
figures released by the Vatican</B>. From 1970-1994 the number of men studying to be priests rose from 72,991 to
105,075. Africa showed the greatest increase in that time, from 3,470 seminarians to more than 17,000. In Southeast
Asia, seminary enrollment nearly doubled to 23,943; the number of South American seminarians tripled to 17,808;
and in Central America the number doubled to 8,435. The numbers in Europe declined from 33,971 to 29,511, and
in North America from 14,365 to 5,692.
<BR><B>...The same regions also are gaining influence in the Church hierarchy, according to news reports</B>. A record 62
countries are represented in the College of Cardinals, the group that selects the pope. Although Italians and
Americans form the two largest blocs, the number of cardinals from Asia, Latin America, and Africa has increased
significantly during the papacy of John Paul II. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Three of the 10 fastest-growing congregations in the United States belong to The International Churches of
Christ-Boston movement (NIRR 5/17/93)</B>. ICCB congregations in Los Angeles and New York City were the
country's fastest growing from 1993-1994, the latest year for which statistics are available, according to researcher
John Vaughn. The Los Angeles ICCB church grew by 2,520 members to 7,711, and the New York church by 1,609
to 6,010 in that period, Vaughn reported in his newsletter Church Growth Today. Chicago Church of Christ grew
by 933 members, to 3,982, during that same period. 
<BR><B>...The ICCB, formerly known as the Boston Church of Christ, is an offshoot of the traditional Churches of Christ</B>.
The network moved its international center from Boston to a facility in inner-city Los Angeles that also serves as
the office center for the city's congregation.
<BR><B>...Among the 107 fastest-growing congregations are Southern Baptist (19%), Assemblies of God (15%), ICCB and
independent charismatic (9%), International Church of the Foursquare Gospel (6%), United Methodist (5%),
independent non-charismatic (5%), Evangelical Free Church (4%), and the Presbyterian Church in America (4%),
according to Vaughn's study</B>.
<BR><B>...Nearly all communities surrounding the fastest-growing churches are declining in Anglo population and increasing
in African-American, Asian, and Hispanic population</B>. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>God was invoked by female as well as male imagery during the United Church of Christ's national women's meeting
June 26-30 in Boston</B>. Some 1,600 women attended the convention. Workshops dealt with earth religions, goddess
worship, and animism as well as more traditional themes.
<BR><B>...Sharp criticism of the event came from the Biblical Witness Fellowship, a theologically conservative group within
the UCC (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/040196.html">NIRR 4/1</A>)</B>. Liz Claver, a BWF member who attended the convention, said that in a forum on Gaia Rising,
leader Sea Raven tried to communicate with the Greek earth goddess Gaia. In the forum on RE-Imagining, traditional
Christianity was termed "religious McCarthyism," Claver said. "A harvest of souls, requested in the opening liturgy,
happened here, but not by the Triune God of biblical Christianity." 
<BR><B>..."I don't believe we are calling up spirits," said Mary Susan Gast, a UCC official</B>. "This was not gnostic and
pagan." She defended the integrity of the convention, saying it reflected diversity within the denomination. The UCC
is not "monolithic," but encompasses "basic tensions because it is a church that accommodates a lot of viewpoints,"
Gast told NIRR. "I am a monotheist. We are talking about one God and Jesus Christ, Who loves us beyond merit." 
<BR><B>...Gast, an ordained UCC minister, officiated at a communion service while wearing an apron attached to her stole,
symbolizing "taking the ordinary and lifting it to God, tying our experience with the sacramental realm</B>." A pot of
dirt added to the traditional elements at the communion table symbolized connection to the earth. "Things look
different when women plan worship for women," Gast said. "But it doesn't mean it's corrupt or pagan." NIRR

<B>Two cases before the Supreme Court could determine the future of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act</B>. RFRA
requires government to show a compelling reason to restrict religious practice, then use the least-restrictive approach.
The court will announce whether it will hear the cases in early October.
<BR><B>...In Smith vs</B>. Fair Employment and Housing Commission (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/042996.html">NIRR 4/29</A>), a California court ruled that landlords
cannot use their religious beliefs to refuse to rent to an unmarried couple. The court said the state's ban on housing
discrimination based on marital status did not create a "substantial burden" on the property owner's freedom of
religion. Evelyn Smith could have avoided the conflict by getting out of the real estate business, the court said.
Telling religious people that it is not a substantial burden to give up a right, such as the right to be a landlord, is a
"very dangerous concept," Smith's attorney, Jordan Lorence, told NIRR.
<BR><B>...The second case, City of Boerne vs</B>. Flores (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/020596.html">NIRR 2/5</A>), challenges RFRA's constitutionality. An appeals court let
a Catholic church renovate its sanctuary despite the Texas city's historical preservation ordinance. A lower court
ruled for the city, saying RFRA is unconstitutional. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>The freedom of religion amendment is back before the House of Representatives after languishing for seven months</B>.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey's proposed amendment forbids the federal government and state governments
to "deny equal access to a benefit, or otherwise discriminate against any person on account of religious belief,
expression, or exercise." It would allow religious charitable groups, daycare centers, and schools to be eligible for
public funds or vouchers, the National Association of Evangelicals' Forest Montgomery told NIRR. The proposal
also specifies that the amendment does not authorize the government to "coerce or inhibit religious belief, expression,
or exercise."
<BR><B>...Supporters will push for a vote before the end of the session this summer, Montgomery said</B>. Armey proposed the
amendment after legislators failed to reach a compromise between competing proposals submitted by Reps. Henry
Hyde (R-Ill.) and Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) last year (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/030496.html">NIRR 3/4</A>). 
<BR><B>...Some religious groups contend that the amendment is unnecessary and violates separation of church and state</B>. "I'm
a born-again, Bible-bred, Texas-born Baptist preacher. And that's why I oppose any government meddling in my
religion," James M. Dunn of the Baptist Joint Committee said. Dunn and representatives of the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.), the United Methodist Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the United Church of Christ,
and Unitarian Universalist, Buddhist, and Jewish groups voiced their opposition at a news conference. They said the
proposal is part of a Republican effort to make religion an issue in the November elections. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>The abortion pill could be legal in the United States within six months as the result of a Food and Drug
Administration advisory panel recommendation approving it</B>. Tests of RU-486, also known as mifepristone, in France
and the United States show the drug induces abortion more than 95% of the time when taken within the first seven
weeks of pregnancy, the FDA was told.
<BR><B>...Abortion opponents said they would try to stop the drug's approval by stressing its side effects, which can include
severe contractions, headaches, dizziness, and heart palpitations</B>. Operation Rescue said it will find out which doctors
prescribe mifepristone because "women will call us and let us know," Rhonda Mackey, the group's spokeswoman,
told the Christian Science Monitor. 
<BR><B>...Surveys show that some doctors who shun surgical abortions might offer mifepristone, but how many would
administer the drug is uncertain</B>. Two days after taking mifepristone, women must take a second drug to cause uterine
contractions that expel the fetus. They then need another doctor's exam to catch failed abortions so they can be
finished surgically. FDA advisers said they were concerned that some women, especially the poor, might skip that
exam because they can't afford it, can't miss work, or can't find childcare. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>The outcome of a lawsuit against the Christian Coalition, filed by the U.S</B>. Federal Election Commission, could have
implications for other nonprofit groups that deal with politics, observers say. The FEC charged July 30 that the
coalition has broken the law by promoting Republican candidates for president and Congress. It says the coalition
should be fined and begin disclosing how it raises and spends its money. The Washington Post reported that two
Republican members of the FEC joined two Democrats to support filing the suit. The other Democrat was absent
and the third GOP post is vacant. 
<BR><B>...The suit alleged that the coalition used its millions of voter guides as well as its conferences and direct mail to
encourage conservative voters to cast ballots for the GOP in the 1990, 1992, and 1994 elections</B>. It said the coalition
coordinated activities with the campaigns of former President George Bush, former U.S. Senate candidate Oliver
North of Virginia, U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia. To retain
its tax-free status, the coalition must refrain from promoting candidates. 
<BR><B>...The suit is an attempt to "intimidate citizens," said Christian Coalition attorney Jim Bopp</B>. Executive Director Ralph
Reed said the group has abided by the letter and the spirit of the law. NIRR 08/05/96

The commission would have two years to report its findings to the president, Congress, the nation's governors, and
Indian tribal governments. It gives the commission authority to hold hearings and limited power to subpoena
documents and written answers to questions, but bars it from public disclosure of confidential information in order

<B>Radiocarbon tests on artifacts from Jericho may lend credence to stories in the Book of Exodus</B>. Grains from the
ancient city were dated to the early 16th century B.C., possibly near the time of events in Exodus, including the
plagues in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the Israelites' 40-year wanderings in the desert. That's according
to archaeologists Hendrik Bruins, a professor at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, and Johannes van
der Plicht of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. Geologists have suggested Egypt's plagues and the
Hebrew escape from Pharaoh's army could be attributed to the eruption of a volcano in the Mediterranean Sea in
1628 B.C, news reports said. 
<BR><B>...The dating shows that the fall of Jericho could have taken place about 45 years after the eruption</B>. "This time
difference is rather striking, as it could fit the desert period of 40 years separating the Exodus from the destruction
of Jericho mentioned in ancient Hebrew texts," the archaeologists wrote in the journal Nature. Other scholars said
the conclusions lack evidence. "The science was all fine," but Bruins and van der Plicht are "archaeologically naive
by trying to fit it all together," said Stuart Manning of the University of Rading in England. NIRR 08/05/96

<BR><B>...The synod also endorsed a report describing hell as a state of annihilation rather than a place of eternal torment
(<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/012296.html">NIRR 1/22</A>) and approved a joint declaration of mutual beliefs and theological differences with the Moravian
Church</B>. 
<P>
<B>Finland: More than 200 Christian motorcycle riders will gather near Keuruu Aug</B>. 16-18 for a weekend of prayer,
camping, and celebration as the Gospel Riders host European Motorcyclists for Christ. The European Hell's Angels
have their own party in France the same weekend. "It is a blessing that they will be out of the country," Gospel
Riders spokesman Juhani Partanen said.
<P>
<B>France: Members of the Reconciliation Walk (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/051396.html">NIRR 5/13</A>) delivered a message to Turkish delegates of the European
Parliament expressing sorrow for atrocities committed during the Crusades</B>. The military expeditions were undertaken
by European Christians during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries to recover the Holy Land from the Muslims. The
walkers, who passed through Croatia last month, are distributing a statement of repentance. Sins committed against
Muslims during that time still embitter them against Christians.  
<P>
<B>Germany: Scientologists are being fired from jobs, barred from joining political parties and labor unions, and treated
as outcasts in the business community, their church leader Helmuth Blueth said</B>. "There is no other comparison but
to the Nazi era," said Blueth, who blames government officials for the situation. In January the minister for family
affairs said the church seeks "world domination and the destruction of our society." Another government official said
Scientologists should be barred from government and teaching jobs, and the postal service has objected to delivering
mail to church offices. The country's 16 states are considering placing the group under observation as an extremist
organization. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives have sent letters encouraging the U.S. Department of
State to address the problem.    
<P>
<B>Hungary: The head of Russia's Orthodox Church turned down an invitation to meet Pope John Paul II when the
pontiff visits Hungary this fall</B>. During his trip, the pope will celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of a Benedictine
monastery and meet bishops of the Hungarian church. Church officials also invited ROC Patriarch Aleksy II to the
meeting, hoping to dispel tensions over what the Orthodox Church sees as overzealous missionary work by Catholics
in Russia -- and possibly to plan a historic papal trip to Moscow. Aleksy II turned down the invitation because
conservative Orthodox leaders feared the pope was trying to extend Catholic influence over their church, news reports
said.

<P>
We <B>encourage</B> you to submit <B>all</B> the resources at your site that belong in categories on GOSHEN.

Abortion law approved by South African Parliament</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>South Africa's Parliament has narrowly approved the Termination of Pregnancy Bill, </B>which allows any woman<B> -- </B>including a teenager without parental consent <B>--</B> to have an abortion<B> </B>up to the 12th week of pregnancy. Abortions can also be performed up to the 20th week in pregnancies that result from rape, abuse, or where there is physical or emotional risk. <BR> <B>...Most South Africans oppose the legislation, numerous polls show</B>. Liberalization of the abortion law has faced fierce opposition from Christian, Islamic, and pro-life groups, who have promised to continue holding public demonstrations. <BR> <B>...Pro-choice advocates say the current law is racist. </B>Many white women go overseas to obtain abortions because they are financially able to do so, while impoverished black women have unsafe &quot;back-street&quot; abortions. <BR> <B>...A total of 99 parliamentarians in the 400-member National Assembly boycotted the vote</B>, many citing religious objections, Ecumenical News International said. The Catholic Church has threatened to excommunicate members who aid abortion, although one nun who is a member of Parliament voted for the law. <BR> <B>...The abortion legislation was promoted by President Nelson Mandela's ruling African National Congress, </B>which instructed its members to follow the party line in the vote, ENI said. The bill now goes to the Senate, where it is all but certain to be adopted, and then to Mandela for signing into law.    </font></p>

Sluggish year for Bible sales</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Bible sales in the United States appear to have reached a saturation point.</B> At a time when Christians in some impoverished countries lack enough copies of Scripture to go around, Americans increasingly are letting Bibles collect dust on bookstore shelves.  <BR> <B>...Sales in the $200-million market for Bibles are peculiarly sluggish this year, publishers say</B>. This summer, the Family Bookstore chain shipped back $200,000 worth of King James Bibles that were gathering dust on shelves, <I>The New York Times</I> reported. In June, Bible sales fell to $3.7 million, a 48% decease compared to the same period last year, according to the Association of American Publishers, which tracks general trade publishers. Thomas Nelson reported its Bible revenues down 6%. <BR> <B>...There are just too many Bibles for too few Christians</B>, observers say. Several hundred Bible versions have been published, targeting every conceivable special-interest group. Some say the many different versions confuse buyers, who don't know how to choose among the numerous options. <BR> <B>...Some new Bible versions have their detractors</B>. Critics call easy-to-read Bibles -- which accommodate people who find other versions too difficult -- the &quot;dumbed-down&quot; versions, Ecumenical News International said. Other Bible versions contain paraphrases or liner notes that slant the meaning to meet theological or social-political criteria, critics say.    </font></p>

Participants in solemn assembly call for repentance</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>About 500 people gathered in Washington, D.C., for three days last week to fast and pray for revival.</B> Organizers of the National Solemn Assembly say the<B> </B>Oct. 24-26 gathering was based on the Old Testament Book of Joel. There, the prophet called for the people to &quot;cry out to the Lord&quot; for God's mercy rather than judgment. The event took place on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol, in Lafayette Square across from the White House, and at nearby Calvary Baptist Church. <BR> <B>...The featured speakers were 18 fiery national leaders. </B>They included Gary Bergel of Intercessors for America; author George Grant; Jay Grimstead of the Coalition on Revival; former Republican presidential candidate Alan Keyes; author Peter Marshall; radio host Janet Parshall; evangelist Richard Owen Roberts; and anti-abortion activist Randall Terry. <BR> <B>...&quot;We are in the midst of the greatest crisis our nation and the world have ever known,&quot;</B> Keyes told the crowd. &quot;Stand up for God's will and what is right in His sight,&quot; he said. <BR> <B>...Christians must reject worldly standards, </B>speakers said.<B> </B>&quot;When you have a low view of God, a high view of self, and your own view of sin, there is spiritual and moral decline,&quot; Roberts said. Early Americans knew that God punished sin, so they sought &quot;quick and thorough repentance.&quot; <BR> <B>...Parents need to wage a &quot;battle for godliness&quot; in their homes,</B> said Doug Phillips of the Home School Legal Defense Association. Phillips said he has seen wonderful results when fathers &quot;love their children so much that they are willing to give up everything in the world to see those children rise up in righteousness.&quot; <BR> <B>...Political leaders must repent</B>, said Pat Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition. He prayed for the overturn of  &quot;legislative and executive actions which export abortion, infanticide, homosexuality, and atheistic education.&quot; <BR> <B>...Christians must elect godly officials</B> and &quot;denounce, withstand, and defeat officials who despoil our godly heritage or defy God's eternal law by their public actions or private behavior,&quot; the group said in a proclamation. <BR> <B>...Some of the strongest words were directed toward the evangelical church, </B>described as being awash in apathy and neglect. Churches are &quot;impotent&quot; and pastors &quot;mute&quot; in the face of evil, the group's proclamation said. The evangelical movement is &quot;characterized by an arrogance that is almost beyond belief,&quot; Roberts said. He cited the &quot;neglect of prayer, the involvement of Philistine methodology, the moral evils, and the doctrinal corruption.&quot; Church services have lost their &quot;godly glory,&quot; said Regent University Professor Michael Brown. <BR> <B>...&quot;If we continue in this path, we will be utterly destroyed</B>. No man can save us. But if we will meet God's conditions, there is still hope,&quot; the proclamation said.    </font></p>

Slave-labor camps still exist in China</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>China operates a brutal system of slave-labor factories largely unknown to the West</B>, according to a prominent Chinese-born dissident. Harry Wu survived 19 years in the <I>laogoi</I> -- or reform-through-labor-camps -- where he was tortured and nearly died. Now as an American citizen, Wu, 59, is on a crusade to speak for those still imprisoned who are &quot;faceless, nameless, and voiceless.&quot;   <BR> <B>...&quot;Why don't you know about the <I>laogoi</I>?&quot; </B>Wu challenged his audience during a speech in Roanoke, Va., on Monday. &quot;Everything you saw in (the Nazi concentration camp movie) <I>Schindler's List</I> is happening in China today,&quot; he said. In the<I> laogoi</I>, prisoners become like animals, he said. &quot;If you treat yourself as a beast, you can survive. A beast only looks for food -- it doesn't care about ethics.&quot;  <BR> <B>...Wu made headlines internationally last year when he was arrested for espionage </B>in China while attempting to film the dealings of international merchants who sell slave-labor products. The arrest of Wu -- who was already known from a <I>60 Minutes</I> program that documented his 1991 covert trip to China -- drew an outcry in the United States. After a joint resolutions from Congress on his behalf, Wu was released.  <BR> <B>...In Wu's passionate speeches to legislative bodies and civic groups around the world, </B>he shows film footage of mass executions of Chinese prisoners. Such events, also documented by groups such as Amnesty International, take place regularly before crowds of thousands of people, Wu says. Their purpose is to instill fear of the communist leaders, whose grasp on power is slipping, Wu says. <BR> <B>...Body organs of executed prisoners are the source of  90% of the transplants in China,</B> Wu said. Some foreigners also travel to China to receive organs they cannot get elsewhere. Body parts sometimes are eaten, according to Wu, who said he has seen a man shot and watched the executioners eat the brain.   <BR> <B>...In addition to eliminating political and religious dissenters, the <I>laogoi</I> serves an economic purpose</B>, Wu said. The communist government uses income from goods produced in the prisons to fuel the economy and increase its military strength. Some missiles are sold to other dictatorships. Wu harshly criticizes Western businesses for their economic relations with the Chinese regime.      <BR> <B>...Religious freedom and other human rights in China are largely illusory, </B>a facade to attract investment money from the West, Wu said. China's official churches are controlled by the state and operate under strict guidelines. An illegal house-church movement is flourishing, but those involved are subject to harassment, arrest, and torture. Estimates of the number of Christians in China range from 15 million to 80 million. Between 50% and 80% of them belong to unregistered churches. <BR> <B>...Some prisoners are Christians arrested for their faith</B>, Wu said. In the 1950s, Chinese communists decimated church buildings, expelled foreign missionaries, and imprisoned Catholic and Protestant leaders. While in prison, Wu, who is Catholic, spoke to a priest who had been imprisoned 35 years. The priest had been forced to live in a four-foot-square room -- with a foot of water on the floor -- after he was betrayed by other prisoners who saw him praying.  <BR> <B>...Change is inevitable in China</B>, Wu says. &quot;We once believed that communism was our heaven,&quot; and that is why very few people complained. But the socialist production system has failed to deliver on its promises. Now, &quot;those at the top no longer are able to rule the old way, and those at the bottom do not accept being ruled the old way.&quot; <BR> <B>...Until change comes, Wu says he will continue his crusade. </B>He has 100 hours of film footage and 1,000 photographs, taken inside China, that he plans to make into a film. Wu also says he will return again covertly with a camera to his homeland. &quot;They troubled me too much. This is my chance to trouble them,&quot; he said.     </font></p>

&quot;Experiencing God&quot; Bible study making an imact around

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A personal and small-group Bible study called <I>Experiencing God</I> is having an extraordinary impact around the world.</B> The 12-week, workbook-style study is published by Broadman &amp; Holman, an arm of the Southern Baptist Convention.  <BR> <B>...A total of 1.8 million copies of <I>Experiencing God</I> have been sold </B>since publication began in 1990; it currently is selling at a rate of 40,000-45,000 a month. Versions also have been developed for teen-agers and younger children. The study has been translated into 31 languages. <BR> <B>...In addition, the study has been condensed into 60 fifteen-minute segments and is being aired on Trans World Radio</B> in Russia, China, and several Arabic countries. Plans are under way to broadcast <I>Experiencing God</I> in all of South America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.  <BR> <B>...An ongoing study of <I>Experiencing God</I> is occurring on the Internet. </B>Those interested can join the study by sending email to hub@xc.org with the message &quot;subscribe expgod.&quot; The next 12-week session begins in January.  <B> </B> <BR> <B>...The study has become &quot;a common denominator, bringing a lot of believers back to the basics of faith,&quot; </B>according to Sam House, coordinator of the <I>Experiencing God</I> project for the Southern Baptist Convention. The study, written by Southern Baptist leader Henry Blackaby and author Claude King, is being used by pastors and laypersons from many denominations, including Pentecostal and charismatic groups, House said.  <BR> <B>&#133;<I>Experiencing God</I> emphasizes praying for God's direction,</B> waiting to hear Him speak, and expecting Him to do extraordinary things. Participants are taught that God is always at work around them, leading believers to make major adjustments in their lives. <BR> <B>...&quot;Our world is not attracted to the Christ we serve, because they cannot see Him at work,&quot;</B> the study says. &quot;When the world sees things happening through God's people that cannot be explained except that God Himself has done them, then the world will be drawn to the God they see.&quot; <BR> <B>...Much of the course is a change of perspective from the typical &quot;American Christian mindset,&quot;</B> House said. Many Christians simply look for something else they can do for God than to follow God's leading, House said. <BR> <B>...Author Blackaby and his wife Marilynn lead couples' conferences</B> centered around <I>Experiencing God</I> several times a year. A conference this month at the Ridgecrest conference center in Asheville, N.C., drew 1,900 couples. Conferences next year are planned in Baton Rouge, La., Ontario, Calif., Dallas, and Ridgecrest. Blackaby also leads Fresh Encounter conferences, which explain how congregations can prepare themselves for spiritual renewal.  <BR>   <BR>       </font></p>

Mainline Protestants form evangelical association</H3>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Evangelical leaders within mainline Protestant denominations are joining forces</B>. The Association for Church Renewal, created Oct. 23, aims to unify and strengthen orthodox Christianity, its leaders said. <BR> <B>...&quot;Given the devastating moral crisis in our society</B>, and the abandonment by many official church leaders of public witness to biblical faith and practice, we have a new urgency for working together and speaking out together,&quot; said James Heidinger, II, chairman of the new association. He is president of Good News, an evangelical reform movement within the United Methodist Church. Diane Knippers, president of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, is vice-chair of the association. Todd Wetzel, executive director of Episcopalians United, is in charge of membership and development. <BR> <B>...Organizers of the association represent groups in the American Baptist Churches</B>/U.S.A., Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Episcopal Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), United Church of Canada, United Church of Christ and United Methodist Church. <BR> <B>...The association's first meeting included discussions on same-sex marriage,</B> the plight of persecuted Christians, and feminist theology. The group, which will issue occasional position papers and public statements, plans to help renewal groups within denominations share strategies and resources.    </font></p>

Pope says evolution is &quot;more than just a theory&quot;
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Evolution is a valid explanation of the origin of mankind and is compatible with the Christian faith, Pope John Paul II proclaimed. </B>The Pope, in a letter to his chief  panel of scientific experts, declared his belief that the human body is not the immediate creation of God, but rather the product of a gradual process of evolution. John Paul II made it clear, however, that he regards the human soul as the product of God's immediate, divine creation. The soul is not subject to evolution, which is &quot;incapable of establishing the dignity of man,&quot; he said.  <BR> <B>...The evolution of man and other species through natural selection is &quot;more than just a theory,&quot; </B>the Pope told the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. The results of various studies, done independently from each other, are &quot;a significant argument&quot; in favor of the accuracy of evolution, the Pope wrote. Church observers emphasized that the Pope was not presenting his statement as a formal teaching of the Catholic Church, but discussing scientific evidence. Nevertheless, the Pope's statement put the weight of his authority firmly behind the idea that evolution is a fact. <BR> <B>...The Pope's statement did not address the apparent conflict with biblical versions of the creation</B> of the universe and Adam and Eve. It also did not mention Charles Darwin by name. Darwin proposed his views that human beings are evolved from apes in the 1859 work,<I> On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</I>, and the 1871 treatises, <I>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</I>. <BR> <B>...The Italian press reacted with banner headlines.</B> &quot;The Pope says we may descend from monkeys,&quot; the conservative newspaper <I>Il Giornale</I> said on its front page. The Pope has &quot;made peace with Darwin,&quot; said <I>La Repubblica</I>. <BR> <B>...The Pope's statement is certain to provoke disapproval from Christians who take a literal approach</B> to Genesis, called &quot;creationists.&quot; Their viewpoint, highlighted in the 1925 trial of Tennessee teacher John Scopes, has recently been reopened. A bill that would have banned teaching evolution as fact was narrowly defeated in the Tennessee legislature this year.  <BR> <B>...The problem of reconciling the biblical account of creation and the findings of evolutionary science</B> has been less rancorous in the Catholic church. For several decades, Catholic theology has held that the depiction of creation in Genesis is a symbolic presentation that leaves room for scientific theories of the origins of the universe and mankind. Many theologians, both Catholic and Protestant, do not believe the theory of evolution conflicts with the doctrine that God created the world and made man in His own image. <BR> <B>...The Pope's statement was seen as the latest illustration that the Catholic Church is willing to amend</B> what it finds are erroneous teachings. The Church also recently apologized for an infamous wrong, its persecution of Galileo for teaching that the Earth moves around the Sun.    </font></p>

Religious leaders urge American shoppers to shun products
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>As the holiday shopping season approaches, Americans should be aware that some products in stores are manufactured in sweatshops</B> in the United States and abroad, a U.S. labor official and religious leaders said. At a news conference, Labor Secretary Robert Reich praised the leaders -- representing Baptist, Episcopal, United Methodist, Catholic, and Jewish organizations -- for raising the ethical issue of sweatshops, where wages are extremely low and working conditions unsafe. Reich said his 800 inspectors cannot protect the rights of 110 million American workers in 6.5 million workplaces. <BR> <B>...Americans have a responsibility to make sure workers are treated fairly and with dignity</B>, the leaders said. Christians who ignore sweatshop conditions are not fulfilling their calling to be their neighbors' keepers, a representative of the United Methodist Board of Global Ministries said. The religious leaders said they planned to speak out from the pulpit, mobilize communities, and contact retailers. <BR> <B>...&quot;Selective buying&quot; is one way to increase pressure on manufacturers</B>, said Archie LeMone of the Progressive National Baptist Convention. Every three months, the Labor Department releases names of firms that deal with sweatshops. On Nov. 27, the federal government plans to release its annual list of companies that have taken extra steps to ensure their goods are not made in sweatshops. The religious leaders have not urged a boycott of any specific brands.     </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Halloween, once an event just for kids, has grown in cultural significance</B> to become a month-long celebration for young and old -- a fact that concerns some Christians. <BR> <B>...Halloween is a multi-million dollar business.</B> For American merchants, it now is the biggest revenue-generator outside of  Christmas -- surpassing Mother's Day and Easter -- according to the National Retail Federation. Eighty percent of all Halloween costume rentals and 65% of sales are for adults, one trade group says. In addition to the costumes, Halloween now includes a host of items such as greeting cards, streamers, twinkling lights, and Oreo cookies with orange cream in the middle<B>. </B>A series of  48 children's horror books called <I>Goosebumps </I>(Parachute Press) sells five million copies each month, and more than 130 million have been sold since the series began in 1992. Scholastic Inc. produces a <I>Goosebumps</I> TV series, and other companies put the name <I>Goosebumps</I> on clothes, toys and other items.  <BR> <B>...The holiday is being celebrated in various ways around the country. </B>A<B> </B>San Francisco group, which has its roots in the lesbian and homosexual community, will hold the world's largest Macarena at a party in the Civic Center. Chicago will hold readings from Edgar Allan Poe's works and run a Haunts of Chicago walking and bus tour. New Orleans has vampire and ghost tours and a secret Halloween ritual starting at the Voodoo Museum. New York will hold its annual Greenwich Village Halloween Parade up Sixth Avenue. In Salem, Mass., site of the witch trials of 1692, there will be festivals playing up the city's history along with tours of the Salem Witch Museum and Witch Dungeon Museum.  <BR> <B>...Americans tend to have very divergent emotions about Halloween. </B>Some consider the day a positive way for people to deal with fear and crime, or praise it as a kind of national festival. But several school districts have placed restrictions on costumes and parties,<B> </B>saying they tend to be violent, offensive, or scary for children. Others promote alternative activities for the family that are clever, but not scary or threatening. <BR> <B>...Whether to celebrate Halloween has become highly controversial among Christians. </B>Psychologist James Dobson says he has mixed feelings about Halloween. The founder of Focus on the Family said the holiday's focus on the occult, witches, devils, and evil sends messages to children that &quot;Christian parents must regard as undesirable and dangerous.&quot; But some aspects of  the observance -- such as dressing up in costumes that are not occultic in theme and requesting treats while being supervised -- are harmless and fun, he said. Dobson advised parents to &quot;stay faithful to your own convictions and do what you think best,&quot; the ministry said. <BR> <B>...Some churches have called for a boycott of the day.</B> A few churches, taking an idea from a minister in Arvada, Colo., have put a new twist on traditional Halloween haunted houses. At Green Ridge Assembly of God Church's Judgment House in Scranton, Pa., visitors see depiction's of the aftermath of  an abortion, a funeral for an AIDS victim, teen suicide, and a fatal drug overdose. The climax is a trip to hell, hosted by a church member portraying Lucifer. The 30-minute presentation concludes with a visit to heaven.    </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The frail and elderly are least likely to support legalization of doctor-assisted suicide</B>, Duke University Medical Center researchers say. In their study, Duke researchers found that 39.9% of the frail and elderly favor such a law compared to 59.3% of their younger relatives. There was no evidence that those who care for the dying are more likely to favor assisted suicide, Duke researcher Harold Koenig said. <BR> <B>...Polls have shown that two-thirds of adults approve of physician-assisted suicide, </B>UPI said.  But the respondents were primarily healthy individuals under 60 --  the group least likely to be affected by such a law -- said Diane Wildman-Hanlon, co-author of the Duke study. <BR> <B>...Most candidates for assisted suicide will be female</B>, according to M. Cathleen Kaveny, who teaches law at the University of Notre Dame. Sixty-five percent of the people Jack Kevorkian has helped commit suicide have been women, who are more likely than men to live longer, end up poor, and suffer depression, Kaveny said in <I>USA Today</I>.     </font></p>

Small loans provide &quot;seed money&quot; in Third World
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A small loan goes a long way in the Third World,</B> a growing number of Christian humanitarian groups are finding. <BR> <B>...So-called micro-enterprize loans made to the poor</B> are often more effective than gifts, the groups say. The loans -- typically a few hundred dollars or less -- act as &quot;seed money&quot; that allows an impoverished  person to begin or expand a business, such as a small shop. Income from that business not only can lift a family from poverty, but make it self-sufficient. Such loans can help even the most destitute, including unskilled women in Latin America, poor farmers in Africa, and low caste people in India who had sold themselves and their children into slavery so they would not starve. <BR> <B>...In developing nations, as many as 10 people may be depending on one small business</B>, according to Food for the Hungry, a U.S.-based ministry that makes micro-enterprize loans in 14 countries. Other evangelical groups that make such loans include World Relief, which is part of the National Association of  Evangelicals, and World Concern, based in Seattle.  <BR> <B>...The most extensive and oldest such loan program is run by Opportunity International</B>, a Chicago-based Christian group that organizes loans in 27 developing nations. OI works through 50 local groups, which manage the loans, develop Christian leaders, and help the new businesses in various ways. Some $14.8 million in loans were made through OI in 1995, the group said. <BR> <B>...Emphasis is placed on commitment and honoring one's word.</B> The rate of repayment is 94%, according to OI, which also works through Prison Fellowship to give former prisoners in developing nations a second chance. One such loan helped a notorious ex-criminal in Zimbabwe, who now has become a Christian, started a business, and regained his community's trust, Prison Fellowship said.    </font></p>

Church can show Jesus film at federally funded senior center
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The U.S. Supreme Court today allowed an Albuquerque church</B> to use a city-owned, federally funded senior center to show the<I> Jesus</I> film and distribute Bibles. <BR> <B>...The case began in 1994, when Albuquerque rejected a request from Don Kimbro, pastor of the Church on the Rock,</B> to show the film and hand out large-print New Testaments. In denying the request, the city cited the Older Americans Act, a federal law that provides money for senior centers but requires that they not be used for religious instruction or worship. The city said the<I> Jesus</I> film, created and distributed by Campus Crusade for Christ, proselytizes by urging viewers to recite a prayer and become a Christian. <BR> <B>...A federal court ruled for the City of Albuquerque. But the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with pastor Kimbro</B>, saying the policy constituted unlawful discrimination based on a particular viewpoint. The circuit court said senior centers are public forums and that allowing the film to be shown there would not imply endorsement of religion. <BR> <B>...Also today, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the U.S.  military's &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy</B> regarding homosexuals. The challenge was brought  by former Lt. Paul Thomasson, who was forced to leave the Navy last year after writing a letter to his commander saying, &quot;I am gay.&quot;     </font></p>

Missionaries see hatred, hope in Rwanda</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>...The missionaries divided into nine groups and visited Rwanda's eight Episcopal dioceses</B>. At one sanctuary, Rwandans described how Anglicans, Roman Catholics, Baptists, and Pentecostals from both tribes had tried to take refuge from the killing. When militias ordered the crowd to separate by tribes, the people refused, declaring themselves all &quot;one in Christ,&quot; ENS said. All 13,500 were murdered and buried together in five mass graves, the missionaries were told. <BR> <B>...In another town, the missionaries visited a school where rooms were filled with 40,000 skeletons</B>, many with hair or clothing attached, ENS said. Those reluctant to participate in the killings were given the choice of  joining the executioners or  the victims. The skeletons were exhumed and displayed to show  what had happened. <BR> <B>...Many women described losing their entire families, </B>telling how their children were betrayed by their teachers or killed by neighbors they had known for a lifetime.  <BR> <B>...Some of those responsible for the deaths begged for forgiveness.</B>  The missionaries arranged for clergy and lay people from different tribes to share a meal and the Eucharist together for the first time since the killings. The services included spontaneous outpourings of grief and pain as enemies embraced and wept.  <BR> <B>...Whether the Rwandan church can renew itself  remains uncertain</B>, the missionaries said. Many church leaders were forced from the country and have not returned or have been charged with indifference or complicity in the slaughter. Divisions among church factions are deep, sometimes to the point of estrangement or, in one cathedral, open disruption during worship.    </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>...The gag order was prompted by the Roman Catholic Church's pro-life postcard campaign, </B>which aimed to persuade Congress to override President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion act. In an attempt to head off the campaign within the military, officers issued memoranda setting limits for speech and political activities. Their memos cited the pro-life campaign as an example of forbidden activity, the<I> Christian Science Monitor</I> said. At the same time, Catholic priests were being told by their bishops to preach about the campaign. <BR> <B>...Caught between two masters, Catholic chaplain Vincent Rigdon sued the government</B>. Rigdon, an Air Force Reserve lieutenant colonel, said the military's order infringes on his constitutional right to free exercise of religion. &quot;The supreme master is God,&quot; Rigdon told the <I>National Catholic Reporter, </I>noting that he would resign if he ever encountered a conflict that he could not resolve legally.  <BR> <B>...An Air Force rabbi, the Muslim Military Association, and a Catholic officer</B> from the U.S. Naval Academy have joined Rigdon in the suit, which is scheduled to be heard in Washington federal district court in November. <BR> <B>...The Pentagon insists its chaplains are not being denied free speech.</B> Chaplains may discuss the morality of current issues, but not influence pending legislation, Pentagon officials said. They also may get involved in politics when out of uniform.  <BR> <B>...The right of service members to have chaplains has been upheld in court</B>. In 1985, the Second Court of Appeals in New York ruled that without them, it would be impossible for service members to have religious mentoring, thus violating their constitutional right to free exercise of religion. But some observers say a government-funded chaplaincy creates inherent conflicts of interest, and should be re-examined.    </font></p>

With Alpha course, seekers feel at home, have time to think
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A Bible course for people who don't attend church</B> has provided hundreds of thousands of people an easy way to check out the Christian faith. The course, called Alpha, is deliberately unchurchy. It includes midweek evening meetings for a meal, a teaching on the Christian faith, and discussion. Subjects include Who Is Jesus?, Why Read the Bible?, Healing, and others. The final meeting is a weekend retreat.  <BR> <B>...There is no pressure, and no rush</B>. A new subject is addressed each week for 10 weeks, providing time for a comprehensive presentation of the gospel and consideration of  its merits. People who don't come back are not contacted. <BR> <B>...The atmosphere at the meetings is relaxed</B>. Organizers make the setting as natural as possible so people will feel at home. One organizer said he is careful about every detail: the lighting, food, parking, and the way people are welcomed. <BR> <B>...The Alpha course originated in England 20 years ago</B> when the curate of Holy Trinity Brompton Anglican church gathered a few people in his living room for a light meal, a talk, and discussion.   <BR> <B>...It is popular with many denominations</B>. People have attended Alpha conferences in England, Canada, the United States, Ireland, Germany, Norway, Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. An estimated 250,000 people will complete the course this year. For information, contact Terri Hibbard at David C. Cook Publishing Company (847) 741-2400.    </font></p>

U.S. has the most child poverty in industrialized world</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Child poverty is more prevalent in the United States than anywhere else in the industrialized nations</B>, a study by a Christian group found. <BR> <B>...Some 21.5% of American children are poor</B>, the highest rate among industrialized nations, according to the study done by Bread for the World Institute. The group, a companion agency to nondenominational, Silver Spring, Md.-based Bread for the World, said 13.6 million children in the United States are hungry or at risk of hunger. It did not define the poverty level. <BR> <B>...Out-of-wedlock births are not the main cause of poverty, </B>the report said.<B> </B>&quot;Economic and social forces beyond the control of  poor people -- such as declining real wages for low-skilled workers<B> -- </B>are more significant causes,&quot; it said.<B> </B>The report mentioned estimates that an additional 1.1 million children will be pushed into poverty by the welfare bill passed by the 104th Congress. <BR> <B>...Government has a crucial role to play in reducing hunger and poverty </B>because many people cannot escape poverty on their own, the report said. There will be broad support in Congress next year to attack poverty, the charity predicted. It said 500 congressional candidates out of 1,229 who were contacted signed a pledge to support federal programs to help end childhood hunger. <BR> <B>...An increasing number of people are hungry in former communist countries, </B>Bread for the World said. The largest number of hungry people live in South Asia, but hunger has declined throughout Asia and the Pacific, mainly because of  effective anti-hunger polices, the group said.    </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Two World Relief staff members were robbed, shot, and killed today</B> in Kompong Cham, Cambodia, as they left a neighborhood in which World Relief works. The two women, Khoun Sokan and Toun Chanthom, had been meeting with a group of neighborhood women who receive small loans to start businesses to earn income so they can feed and clothe their impoverished families, Wheaton, Ill.-based World Relief said. One of  the women died immediately and the other several hours later. <BR> <B>...Sokan and Chanthom were single parents and had worked for World Relief since the Gateway Program</B> began in Kompong Cham in 1944. Both women were Christians and active in their churches, the group said. World Relief is the international assistance arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, USA. <BR> <B>...The Gateway Program began in 1992 in Phnom Penh</B>. It combines basic lessons on money management with good health practices in weekly neighborhood meetings. More than 8,300 women have received loans through the program. World Relief estimated that its staff members in Cambodia have made more than 12,000 trips to and from the neighborhood meetings without serious incident. <BR> <B>...&quot;Sokan and Chanthom paid the ultimate price as they faithfully served</B> the needs of poor women and their children,&quot; said Joel Copple, World Relief's Cambodia director.    </font></p>

Doctor puts euthanasia instructions on the Internet</H3>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Euthanasia software soon will be available on the Internet</B>, according to the Australian doctor who developed it. Dr. Philip Nitschke, who performed the world's first legal mercy killing, said Internet users could copy the software and instructions from a home page that is being developed, Reuters news service said. An estimated 50 million people worldwide use the Internet. <BR> <B>...&quot;We see no reason in restricting it in any way,&quot;</B> Nitschke said. Last month, he assisted in the killing of  one-time Christian missionary Bob Dent, hooking him to the machine with an intravenous tube. Australia's Northern Territory has the world's only voluntary euthanasia law. It enables people to give themselves lethal injections with the touch of computer keys. Nitschke said he also sent how-to-do-it kits overseas and around Australia using electronic mail. <BR> <B>...The software and the equipment needed to build the machine are simple and cost $160,</B> though the lethal drugs are difficult to obtain, Nitschke said. A doctor cannot lawfully hook a patient up to the machine anywhere outside the Northern Territory. <BR> <B>...Nitschke said he was developing another death machine that uses carbon monoxide</B> and an oxygen mask. This enabled people to end their lives without needing someone to insert intravenous tubes, he said. Nitschke said his machine is a &quot;slicker&quot; version of the suicide device designed by American euthanasia advocate Jack Kevorkian, who has attended more than 40 deaths.    </font></p>

Supreme Court to rule in important religious freedom case
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>...The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, passed into law in 1993 by Congress, set an important new standard.</B> It requires that any law which imposes a &quot;substantial burden&quot; on someone's religious beliefs must serve a &quot;compelling&quot; government interest. If such a law is imposed, it must be carried out in the &quot;least intrusive&quot; way possible.  <BR> <B>...The case involves space problems at a church. </B>The city of Boerne, Texas, told St. Peter Catholic Church that it could not expand its 70-year-old building because it was located within the city's historic district. The church sued, saying it could not accomplish its mission unless it expanded. St. Peter church has more than 2,000 members, but its sanctuary can accommodate fewer than 250 at one time, news reports said. The city lost its case, and has appealed. <BR> <B>...Boerne officials contend that Congress overstepped its authority by passing RFRA.</B> They argue that RFRA violates the First Amendment by giving religion privileges that other expressions of conscience do not enjoy. Boerne officials also say RFRA violates the 10th Amendment rights of states and local governments by forcing them to allow more protection for religious beliefs than the Constitution requires. <BR> <B>...Sixteen states have joined in a friend-of-the-court brief against RFRA, </B>contending that it has allowed &quot;gangs and like-minded groups to shroud illicit activity under the cover of  religious belief.&quot; Many prison wardens also oppose RFRA, since it has resulted in lawsuits by inmates challenging various prison regulations as violations of their religious beliefs. The Justice Department has defended the law, as has a broad coalition of religious and civil rights groups. <BR> <B>...RFRA was enacted to overcome a 1990 Supreme Court decision</B> in an Oregon case involving Native Americans. The Supreme Court ruled that there is no constitutional right to take the drug peyote as a religious practice. It said laws that are otherwise neutral toward religion are not unconstitutional just because they may infringe on the religious beliefs of some people.    </font></p>

It won't be another Million Man March, organizers say</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A planned rally marking the one-year anniversary of the Million Man March has attracted little attention</B>. Organizers of  the World Day of Atonement, to be held at the United Nations in New York on Oct. 16, expect fewer than 50,000 participants. <BR> <B>...Organizers say they aren't attempting to repeat the Million Man March. </B>&quot;We are celebrating a holy day. What happened last year was a spiritual event,&quot; Benjamin Chavis, former executive director of the NAACP, told the Associated Press. In addition to Chavis, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan again is helping organize the rally and will be its main speaker, issuing a worldwide appeal to end &quot;injustice, exploitation, violence, and war.&quot; <BR> <B>...Many black leaders aren't participating this year.  </B>Those not coming include Jesse Jackson, who spoke at the Million Man March; NAACP President Kweisi Mfume; National Urban League President Hugh Price; and Southern Christian Leadership Conference President Joseph Lowery, news reports said. Some leaders cite disillusionment with the organizers. <BR> <B>...The Million Man March raised expectations of a lofty crusade to tackle social problems</B>. Little of that has happened. Also, a promised political force has not emerged from the rally, said Ron Daniels, director of the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York.   <BR> <B>...But the legacy of the march also is spiritual, and is still unfolding</B>, others say. One purpose was to increase the sense of personal responsibility among African Americans, encouraging them to revitalize their neighborhoods and improve their families.  <BR> <B>...Many of the marchers have translated its lessons into personal terms.</B> Some say the march has kept their families intact and brought them into churches. Local men's groups have formed; some of the groups have fizzled, but others have organized campaigns and made progress in solving neighborhood ills. Many community leaders agree that today, social progress will come about more by individual efforts than large-scale actions, <I>The Chicago Tribune</I> said.    </font></p>

Spiritual renewal catching fire in Philadelphia</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A spiritual renewal is taking place in Philadelphia</B>. It began in July 1994, when pastors and other leaders from several inner-city and suburban congregations, calling themselves A Circle of Friends, began holding monthly services. In December 1995, Randy Clark, pastor of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship of  St. Louis, and his worship team led five nights of services at Deliverance Evangelistic Church, a predominantly African-American congregation. Clark, who travels internationally, is associated with the Toronto Blessing movement that began in 1994 at the Toronto Airport Vineyard in Canada. <BR> <B>...At the Philadelphia services, Christians of  many denominational and racial backgrounds worshipped together</B>. Repentance between races, healing of the sick in body and spirit, and an infusion of  joy and &quot;holy laughter&quot; characterized the meetings, which lasted into the early hours of the morning, participants said. <BR> <B>...Since then, Philadelphia's monthly renewal services have grown in size and scope.</B> More than 2,000 people from throughout the Delaware Valley attend. In addition, an interdenominational group of pastors from the inner-city and suburbs meet regularly to pray and fast for further renewal.  <BR> <B>...Clark and his music team returned to Deliverance Evangelistic Church Oct. 7-- this time for 30 days</B> of meetings. Leaders intend the services to be filled with worship, teaching, healing of the sick, and salvation of the lost, they said. Opportunities to serve the inner-city through witnessing and feeding the hungry also are planned. The meetings were preceded by a two-day seminar hosted by pastors and other leaders from suburban and inner-city churches. Seminar leaders included pastors Pablo Boltari, Carlos Mraida, and Pablo Deires of Argentina, who are involved in a spiritual awakening in that country. <BR> <B>...Clark said in a letter to the church prior to the meetings that there have been only three occasions</B> where he has had a sense that &quot;God was going to move in a certain geographical area.&quot; The first was in Toronto, Canada, in January 1994; the second was when going to Melbourne, Fla., in January 1995; &quot;and the third is my upcoming meetings in Philadelphia,&quot; he wrote. Deliverance Evangelistic Church is located at 2001 W. Lehigh Ave. in Philadelphia.    </font></p>

Hospital patients, priests slaughtered in Zaire</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Marauding Tutsis massacred 38 people in a Swedish missionary hospital in Zaire, Africa, Oct. 6, </B>news reports said. Most victims were shot or bayoneted while in their beds. The murders took place in Lemera, eastern Zaire, near the borders of  Rwanda and Burundi. <BR> <B>...Tutsis also slaughtered 12 people, including two priests, at a nearby Catholic mission,</B> said Dag Bohlin, a spokesman for the Swedish Free Pentecostal Church, which runs the hospital. As they were leaving, the marauders took hostages, including a staff member of  the British group The Leprosy Mission International. They also stole medicine, burned trucks, and destroyed part of the hospital, TLMI said. <BR> <B>...Those involved in the raids are part of a Tutsi subgroup known as the Banyamulenge</B>. Although they have lived in Zaire for up to 200 years -- arriving from what are now Rwanda and Burundi -- the Banyamulenga are a people without a country since their citizenship was revoked in 1981. Zairian authorities want to concentrate the Banyamulenge in government-controlled camps to make them easier to monitor. <BR> <B>...Tensions have been building in the region for months</B>. The situation grew even more explosive recently when Zaire gave 200,000 Banyamulenge an ultimatum: leave the area by Oct. 15 or be hunted down as rebels by Zairian soldiers. <BR> <B>...Zairian troops and large crowds set up roadblocks in Bukavu</B> Oct. 11 and looked for Banyamulenga. &quot;A general witch-hunt&quot; was taking place as suspected Banyamulenge were being dragged off by police, Reuters said. United Nations agencies tried to evacuate foreign staff from Bukavu and Uvira to the south. The TLMI said one staff member at Lemera, who is of Tutsi origin, &quot;fled into the mountains.&quot; Other TLMI missionaries also were evacuated.    </font></p>

Disease didn't disable evangelist's spirit</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>&quot;I have cerebral palsy -- what's your problem?&quot; David Ring says</B>. The evangelist likes to challenge his listeners -- some of whom may be depressed and feeling self-pity -- to compare their lives to his, and encourage them by what God can do. Ring, 42, was born with CP. His parents died when he was young, and David was moved from family to family. He recalls school classmates making fun of him and remembers thinking that everyone had given up on him because, &quot;I'm a no-good cripple.&quot; <BR> <B>...Until the day of his spiritual rebirth as a Christian, Ring had virtually no friends.</B> He isolated himself whenever he could, answering questions coldly in a monotone, and averting his eyes, according to <I>Just As I Am, The Life of David Ring</I> (Moody). &quot;If God loved me, why is God so angry with me? Why is God breaking my heart?&quot; Ring thought.  <BR> <B>...Ring has stopped considering himself a victim</B>, he says. He has not been healed of the disease and still &quot;walks and talks funny,&quot; he says. &quot;But oh! The joy that floods my soul because Jesus made me whole.&quot; Speaking haltingly but clearly, Ring causes audiences to realize that all things are possible through Christ. &quot;I can't even say Jesus plain. What's your problem, healthy man, women, teen-ager?&quot; he asks. <BR> <B>...Ring tells his story to about 100,000 people a year at churches, conventions, schools</B> and corporate events and has been featured on several nationally televised programs. He and his wife, Karen, have four children and live in Orlando, Fla.    </font></p>

Property-tax exemptions for nonprofit groups threatened</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on whether governments can remove a property-tax exemption</B> <B>from a nonprofit group</B> if most of the people it serves are not state residents. The case is a tax dispute between a Christian Science summer camp and the town of Harrison, Maine. Camp Newfound/Owatonna is appealing its $22,000-a-year property tax bill from the town and challenging a 39-year-old law as an unconstitutional discrimination against interstate commerce. About 95% of its campers are from outside Maine. Under current law, the camp would pay no property tax if most of its campers were from Maine. <BR> <B>...In the past, the Supreme Court has interpreted the U.S. Constitution's commerce clause as barring state economic protectionism</B>. This would seem to support the camp's challenge, <I>The New York Times</I> said. But Maine's Supreme Judicial Court upheld the law last year. That ruling alarmed nonprofit organizations around the country. <BR> <B>...Nonprofit groups have warned</B> that if other states took the same approach, many organizations that served an out-of-state population, such as colleges, could be liable for taxes on valuable real estate.  <BR> <B>...Meanwhile in Colorado, a voter referendum on the ballot </B>next month would, for the first time, require most charitable, religious, and nonprofit social-service organizations in the state to pay property taxes. The referendum is sponsored by talk-show host John Murphy, who says &quot;God is not broke&quot; but that Colorado cities are. If Amendment 11 passes, some ministries in Colorado say they will be forced to close. Orphanages, public schools, homeless shelters, housing for the elderly and disabled, and hospices would remain exempt.    </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Allegations of a conspiracy between then-president Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II</B> to overthrow communism in Poland are &quot;laughable,&quot; a Catholic church spokesman in Poland said. The Poles &quot;liberated themselves by their own efforts,&quot; Marian Subocz, a spokesman for Poland's Catholic Bishops Conference, told Ecumenical News International.  <BR> <B>...The book <I>His Holiness: John Paul II and the Hidden History of Our Time</I></B> (Doubleday) by American journalist Carl Bernstein and Italian writer Marco Politi claims the Pope was given secret data during briefings by the CIA. The book also says the Vatican gave the United States information from Eastern Europe and helped funnel $50 million covertly to Poland's Solidarity trade union movement. <I>His Holiness </I>is scheduled to be published Oct. 10. <BR> <B>...Former Solidarity spokesman Jan Litynski acknowledged that U.S. policy and the Pope's influence</B> contributed to the collapse of communism, but described the book's allegations as &quot;total rubbish.&quot; <BR> <B>...Reagan visited the Vatican in June 1982,</B> and the administration had been in contact with the Vatican on other occasions, observers said. But the existence of such covert funds is &quot;certainly untrue&quot; and &quot;preposterous,&quot; Polish church historian Andrzej Micewski said.     </font></p>

&quot;Depressing&quot; level of racism exists, study finds
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Racial animosity and segregation still are prevalent in the South, </B>according to a government study conducted after recent church arsons. The finding is the result of  public forums conducted by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, a bipartisan and multiracial group. Nearly 90 black churches and 72 white churches in the South have burned since January 1995. <BR> <B>...Banks, schools, and swimming pools in Greene County, Ala., still are racially segregated, </B> the commission found. In Mississippi, animosity between the races is still so prevalent that blacks refuse to attend forums at a predominantly white college, <I>USA Today</I> reported. <BR> <B>...The fires &quot;are a message that we need to discuss race honestly,&quot; </B>Melvin Adams, director of the commission's central region, told<I> </I>the newspaper<I>.</I> The facts are &quot;depressing,&quot; he said. <BR> <B>...Racial hatred is a motivation for more than half the fires,</B> according to National Council of Churches spokesperson Carol Fouke. This includes animosity directed mainly at blacks, but also toward Latinos, Vietnamese, and whites who spoke out against racism, Fouke said. So  far, the NCC's Burned Churches Fund has distributed $2 million to rebuild or restore 24 churches, she said. The fund has received $4.6 million and has an additional $1.2 million in pledges. The federal government also has made $10 million in loan guarantees available to the churches, Fouke said.    <BR> <B>...Meanwhile, a 13-year-old girl who burned down a black church sanctuary in Charlotte, N.C</B>., embraced the church's pastor in court and apologized to him Tuesday. The teen-ager, whose name was not disclosed because she is a juvenile, admitted setting fire to Matthews Murkland Presbyterian Church's former sanctuary, <I>The Charlotte Observer</I> said. She has been sentenced to 12 months' probation, ordered to perform 200 hours of community service, and will continue mental-health treatment. The fire appeared to be an attempt to make a statement against Christianity, not African-Americans, police said. Pastor Larry Hill said the girl seemed truly sorry for her crime <BR> <B>...After the hearing, the girl's mother</B>, a member of Matthews United Methodist Church, talked about the ordeal. &quot;A lot of good has come out of this,&quot; she said. &quot;We have come to realize what is truly important in life: God, family and friends. We would like to thank Rev. Hill of Matthews Murkland and his congregation for their compassion, prayers, and especially for their forgiveness.&quot;    </font></p>

Farrakhan is a false prophet, black pastor says</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Louis Farrakhan is a false prophet, says a black pastor</B> who has studied the Nation of Islam movement for 25 years<B>.</B>  Jerry Buckner, pastor at Tiburon Christian Fellowship in Tiburon, Calif., said Farrakhan &quot;has redefined the Jesus of the Bible&quot; and succeeded in splitting the black church, Baptist Press said. <BR> <B>...Farrakhan says Jesus of Nazareth was only a type of the real messiah</B>, said Buckner, a leading authority on the Nation of Islam. He referred to a videotape of Farrakhan's 1994 Easter service titled <I>The Crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the Imprisonment of Minister Louis Farrakhan. </I>In that speech, Farrakhan says that 75% of  what the Bible says about Jesus refers to a future man. Farrakhan also says that Jesus of Nazareth and Elijah are the same person and that Farrakhan is Elijah, meaning Jesus, Buckner said. <BR> <B>...On the tape, Farrakhan relates the crucifixion to himself</B>, saying, &quot;I  am hanging on a cross right now. I'm on Calvary right now and the more I suffer, the more our people are raised to consciousness.  You don't have to look for Jesus. I represent him!&quot; Farrakhan says in the speech. &quot;That is blasphemy,&quot; or claiming for oneself the attributes of God, Buckner said. <BR> <B>...The Nation of Islam's day of atonement, called the Million Man March, tried to redefine the biblical meaning</B> of  the word atonement, Buckner said. Farrakhan's concept of atonement is deliverance or salvation from the &quot;white man's hell on earth,&quot; Buckner said. Farrakhan says that once white domination is thwarted, blacks will be delivered from ignorance, illiteracy, poor education, bad health, and other evils, Buckner said. <BR> <B>...The Nation of Islam is fighting white racism with black racism, and many blacks don't realize it, </B>Buckner said. &quot;The black community is so hungry for a black hero, for a black leader after the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that they are willing to follow anyone,&quot; Buckner said. As a result, conflict is occurring among black churches that support Farrakhan and those that don't. &quot;This little cancer in the church is going to spread,&quot; Buckner said.    </font></p>

The grass-roots movement is potentially the strongest since the days of  farm worker leader Cesar Chavez, observers say.  <BR> <B>...In recent months, 57 ministers, priests, and rabbis</B> held a news conference and ran a full-page newspaper ad urging a New Jersey dairy to settle a strike. They also criticized its wage offer as too low to support a family. In another instance, 300 clergy sent a letter to the Case Farms poultry plant in Morganton, N.C., urging management to improve working conditions. Those clergy plan to spread their campaign to help all of the nation's 240,000 poultry-processing employees. <BR> <B>...Labor-clergy coalitions have formed in New York City, Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, Boston</B>, Detroit, and Chicago, <I>The New York Times </I>reported. This spring, 40 clerics formed the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice, an umbrella group based in Chicago.  <BR> <B>...Religious leaders say they are trying to address a key ethical issue:</B> the growing gap between America's haves and have-nots. Clergy also are concerned that corporate downsizing and stagnant wages are weakening families. In practical terms, churches, synagogues, and mosques &quot;are on the front lines in dealing with crises&quot; such as hunger and poverty when families need help, said Kim Bobo of the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice. Many people don't understand the ramifications of worker-justice issues, she told the <I>Christian Science Monitor</I>.  <BR> <B>...Business leaders are unhappy with the labor-clergy alliance</B>, <I>The Times</I> said. The leaders contend that clergy do not really belong in the disputes, don't understand the complexities of  the issues, and often fail to listen to management's side of the argument. <BR> <B>...Clergy involvement in labor issues has a long tradition</B>. In the 19th century, clergy joined in struggles against 12-hour work days, child labor, and the right to strike. In recent decades, many clergy were preoccupied with the civil right movement and stayed away from unions because of a perceived corruption there and the belief that workers were thriving. <BR>      </font></p>

U.S. citizen arrested as spy in North Korea</H3>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A U.S. citizen who apparently was working as a Christian missionary in China has been arrested in North Korea and charged with spying</B>. U.S. officials in Seoul, South Korea, are trying to arrange the release of Evan Carl Hunzike, 26, who was arrested  Aug. 24. South Korea and the United States deny that Hunzike is a spy. The charge carries a possible death penalty. <BR> <B>...Hunzike was arrested on an island in the Amnok river, called the Yalu in Chinese</B>, bordering China and North Korea. His cousin -- identified only by his family name of Yun -- told reporters that Hunzike is not capable of acting as a spy. <BR> <B>...White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States is seeking more information</B> through the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, North Korea. Washington and Pyongyang have not had diplomatic ties since the Korean War, but the two sides have had liaison offices in each other's capitals since 1994. Hunzike, whose mother is South Korean, is a native of Alaska and attended college in Yakima, Wash.,  his cousin said. <BR> <B>...Tensions between the two Koreas have come close to the breaking point recently</B>. Observers said North Korea's aim in raising the spy charges may be to engage Washington in talks and divert attention from a recent ill-fated submarine incursion. <BR> <B>...South Korea accused North Korea of  sending spies aboard the submarine on  Sept. 18.</B> Twenty-two North Koreans who got off  the submarine have been killed or found dead and one has been captured. North Korea said the submarine was on a training mission when engine trouble caused it to drift south.    </font></p>

Anglicans, Lutherans in Europe reach unity agreement </H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Anglicans and Lutherans in Europe have agreed to a sweeping form of  ecumenical unity</B>. Anglican churches in Britain and Ireland and Lutheran churches in the Nordic and Baltic countries formalized their agreement in Trondheim, Norway, last month. <BR> <B>...The denominations will treat baptized members of each others' churches as they do their own members.</B> They also will welcome ordained bishops, pastors, and deacons into any of the 10 churches to minister in accordance with the receiving church's regulations. In addition, the churches plan to consult on various matters of faith.  <BR> <B>...The agreement, known as the Porvoo Declaration, bridges &quot;a Reformation gap,&quot;</B> according to Trondheim's host bishop, Finn Wagle. George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said the document is the most important ecumenical agreement in this century. Ishael Noko, general secretary of  the Lutheran World Federation, called it a &quot;theological breakthrough&quot; that will have a positive effect on Anglican-Lutheran relations worldwide. <BR> <B>... Bishops must acknowledge that &quot;some of us have treated [the episcopy] as an idol </B>that justified us,&quot; said Bishop Richard Holloway of the Scottish Episcopal Church. That is why &quot;so many churches have rejected episcopy,&quot; he said at a service celebrating the agreement. About 1,000 guests, including 24 bishops and five archbishops, took part in the service. Similar services were to take place in Tallin, Estonia and London. <BR> <B>...In the United States, bishops in the Episcopal Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</B> were holding a joint meeting Oct. 3-8 to consider bringing the denominations into full communion with each other. If approved, such an agreement would allow Episcopal priests and Lutheran pastors to officiate in each others' churches and allow the denominations' members to take communion together. <BR>       </font></p>

Mending broken hearts</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Brian Marcoux leads one to five people to Christ every day</B>. &quot;I have a ripping desire, an unquenchable desire, to reach the lost,&quot; said the 33-year-old Salvation Army counselor. The walls in his Waterbury, Conn., office are full of photos of people he has led to Christ. Marcoux also evangelizes on street corners -- and just about everywhere else. He once redirected an AT&amp;T telephone sales pitch to spiritual matters and led the sales representative to a profession of faith. When Marcoux leaves his family waiting at a gas pump while he is inside paying, his patient wife knows he's witnessing to the clerk or customers. <BR> <B>...Marcoux knows what having a broken heart is like -- and he can sense when others have one</B>, he told <I>Religion News Today</I>. At 5 feet 8 inches, the 225-pound, full-bearded, barrel-chested Marcoux has a past filled with motorcycle gang violence, drugs, orgies, and crime. &quot;It's a sad testimony,&quot; said Marcoux, who said his sinful lifestyle followed a troubled youth and the killing of his beloved brother Brett.  <BR> <B>...&quot;I said kiss off to God. My heart was so badly broken&quot;</B> after Brett's death, Marcoux said. Spiritually, Marcoux began to &quot;get sicker and sicker, searching for the cure. What in the world is going to heal this pain?&quot; he asked. He considered suicide. Then, 10 years ago, someone led Marcoux to Christ and he knew he &quot;found the cure,&quot; he said. <BR> <B>...&quot;Now every day I deal with broken hearts and lives,&quot; said Marcoux</B>, who believes God has given him the ability -- he calls it a gift -- to see inside people's hearts by looking into their eyes. &quot;I lean over my desk and say, `Stop. Do you know what is wrong? You have a broken heart, don't you?'&quot; Marcoux said. Invariably, the tears flow. &quot;When those words go forward, It's just like, Bam! I don't say it to everybody, but when God says now is the time to drop the bomb, I drop it.&quot; <BR> <B>...The tone of voice Marcoux uses varies by individual</B>, said Marcoux, who speaks at youth group events as well as in prisons. &quot;I won't do anything ungodly, but if I need to get loud and in somebody's face, I'll do it.&quot; Marcoux evangelizes in biker bars, and has had &quot;big men get in my face screaming and spitting.&quot; Marcoux does not get physically violent, &quot;but when it comes to my King, I get violent, and I am taking it by force.&quot; The lost are &quot;just going to wander off and fall off the cliff,&quot; he said. &quot;Their blood will be on our heads.&quot;    </font></p>

Bakker says his message and lifestyle were wrong, but he didn't
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Jim Bakker says he did not cheat his followers out of millions of dollars in the 1980s. </B> But the former evangelist blames himself for preaching and living an extravagant lifestyle that contradicted Jesus' message to love God, not money. <BR> <B>...Bakker makes the statements in his new book,  <I>I Was Wrong</I> (Thomas Nelson Publishers), and in an interview</B> with Barbara Walters aired Friday on ABC-TV's <I>20/20</I>  (10 p.m. Eastern). The interview was the first televised since Bakker's release from prison in 1994. <BR> <B>...&quot;It was wrong as a minister of the gospel, I believe, to live that way,&quot;</B> Bakker tells Walters. &quot;Back then, I felt it was fine and justifiable.&quot; <BR> <B>....In the interview and book, Bakker focuses on his relationship with Tammy Faye Messner,</B> his former wife of 30 years and former co-host of the PTL television show. He also discusses his five years in federal custody. Bakker originally was sentenced to 45 years. <BR> <B>...In 1989, a federal jury in Charlotte, N.C., convicted Bakker of conspiracy and wire and mail fraud</B>. Jurors agreed with charges that Bakker fraudulently sold 150,000 lifetime partnerships to the ministry's elaborate Heritage USA theme park in Fort Mill, S.C. Prosecutors said PTL partners were told they could stay at the park's Heritage Grand Hotel free for three nights each year for life; the partnerships were a form of time-share transactions that were illegally oversold, prosecutors said. <BR> <B>...Bakker insists he did nothing wrong in his dealings with PTL's lifetime partners</B>. He writes that he never guaranteed partners they could have a particular room or time of the year. &quot;I never 'sold' lifetime partnerships at PTL,&quot; Bakker writes in<I> I Was Wrong. </I>&quot;The fraud charges brought against me by the government and propagated by the press implied that I had been selling 'time-shares.'...I emphatically told our viewers that lifetime partnerships were not time-shares.&quot; <BR> <B>...In the book, Bakker writes about being sexually molested by a man when he was 11 years old</B>, questioning his sexuality in prison, and being assured by a prison therapist that he was not homosexual. He says the sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn, which led to his 1987 downfall, was a 15- to 20-minute tryst. &quot;My conscience screamed at me every step of the way,&quot; Bakker wrote. <BR> <B>...Bakker's lowest point in prison came when he found out Tammy was divorcing him</B> to marry his best friend, Roe Messner. &quot;I wept...and wept...and wept,&quot; he writes. <BR> <B>... Bakker, who lives on a small, rented farm in Hendersonville, N.C., told Walters that he is lonely</B> and would like to remarry but is not dating anyone. &quot;I miss Tammy Faye,&quot; he said. ``I don't have the need to be on television. I don't have the need to succeed at something big. I would like to help people. I hope I could go back to prison some time to minister to prisoners. I really care about them.&quot;  <BR> <B>...Thomas Nelson Publishers will print at least 200,000 copies of Bakker's book.</B> Rolf Zettersten, a Nelson spokesman, told <I>The Charlotte Observer</I> that Bakker doesn't expect to make any money on the book. All proceeds from the sales will go to the IRS for Bakker's back taxes and to lawyers, Zettersten said. <BR> <B> ...Tammy Faye Messner has written her own book</B>, <I>Tammy: Telling It My  Way</I> (Villard, $22.95). ABC-TV will air an interview with her <I>PrimeTime Live</I> Tuesday (10 p.m. Eastern).    </font></p>

In each city, the group will bring at least 100 signs to its two-hour demonstrations. Demonstrators will hold up the posters -- which are 4 x 5 feet and 4 x 6 feet -- where traffic is slow and &quot;people have to take a good look,&quot; said Jeff White, director of Operation Rescue California, organizer of  the demonstrations. <BR> <B>...The posters contain a photo of a baby's head held in a pair of forceps</B>. It's face is missing from the upper lip down, but it has hair and is identifiable as human, White said. A second photo depicts pieces of a  baby's body in reassembled form. <BR> <B>...&quot;The tortured faces of these babies&quot; show the tragedy of abortion</B> that Americans are trying to ignore, White told <I>Religion News Today</I>. &quot;If they won't look at it, we will take it right to them.&quot; <BR> <B>...Reactions have been immediate -- and sometimes violent -- when the posters were displayed</B> this May and June in 24 Western U.S. cities, and outside the Republican and Democratic conventions, White said.  At least two women on their way to getting an abortion have changed their minds, White said. Also, angry passersby have ripped up or thrown paint on the signs in several cities, and often complain that children should not be forced to see the posters, he said. &quot;It's been hot on the street. We have to be constantly on guard.&quot; <BR> <B>...White said the group hopes to stir up even more indignation</B>, so that &quot;people will try to create laws to stop us.&quot; That would start a national debate &quot;to see if we can show the signs.&quot;  <BR> <B>...The demonstrations are planned</B> in Las Vegas, Ariz.; Denver, Colo.; Omaha, Neb.; Kansas City and  St. Louis, Mo.; Louisville, Ky.; Indianapolis and  Fort Wayne, Ind.; Toledo, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus, Ohio; Detroit, Mich.; Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, Pa.; Buffalo, N.Y.; Newark, N.J.; Washington, D.C.; Richmond, Va.; Durham and Charlotte, N.C.; Columbia, S.C.; Atlanta, Ga.; Birmingham, Ala.; Memphis, Tenn.; Little Rock, Ark.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and El Paso, Texas; and San Bernardino, Calif.    </font></p>

Prayer summits</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A pastors' prayer-retreat movement is growing around the world</B>. Participants describe the four-day retreats -- called Pastor's Prayer Summits -- as life-changing experiences that lead to long-term changes in their personal lives and ministries. The retreats have grown in numbers from the first one in Portland, Ore., in 1989 to 120 this year. A total of 301 summits have been held in 85 cities in six countries. <BR> <B>...&quot;The growth of the movement has been phenomenal,&quot;</B> said Terry Dirks of International Renewal Ministries. &quot;There is a sense of desperation for the intervention of God, a hunger for revival, a passion to seek the face of the Lord, and a desire for unity in the body of Christ,&quot; he said. IRM, a ministry of Multnomah Bible College in Portland, organizes and facilitates the summits. <BR> <B>...Most summits are held in the United States, but they have taken place in Japan, Poland, Russia</B>, <B>Israel, Australia, Canada, and Mexico</B>. All of those countries have been equally receptive to the summits, Dirks said. In Australia, 15 summits were scheduled after IRM leaders held a series of retreats and meetings across the continent this summer. One pastor said Australia had &quot;never seen anything like this.&quot; <BR> <B>...So far, a majority of summit participants are white evangelicals</B>. But 18% of the pastors now come from mainline denominations and a growing number are African-American, Hispanic, or Asian, IRM said. The summits often result in &quot;incredible incidents&quot; of reconciliation across denominations and racial lines.  <BR> <B>...The summits have no scheduled speakers or set agenda</B>. In addition to praying, pastors usually talk, sing, worship, and even engage in impromptu confession of their sins. Often, a participant is able to be frank with at least one other man about his personal or professional struggles. The new spiritual and personal bonds often last well after the retreat ends. Friendships have resulted in the formation of ongoing prayer groups, cooperative evangelistic efforts, and a citywide atmosphere in which pastors pray for rather than criticize each other, leaders say.  <BR> <B>...Other types of prayer summits have begun as an offshoot of the Pastor's Prayer Summits</B>. These include retreats for pastors' wives, church board members, women in leadership positions, lay leaders, and college students. IRM is working cooperatively with other evangelistic groups including the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, Luis Palau Evangelistic Association, Promise Keepers, Discipling A Whole Nation, Concerts of Prayer International, and the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement. IRM and DAWN plan a joint consultation on prayer and city-wide evangelism Nov. 4-6 in Asheville, N.C. For information on the consultation, call (704) 938-9111. IRM's phone number is (503) 251-6455.    </font></p>

Christian pastor killed in Iran</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>An Iranian Christian pastor reportedly was killed in Iran</B> on or about Sept. 25, Iranian Christians International reported. Pastor Mohammed Ravanbakhsh's body was found hanging on a tree in a forest near Ghaem-Shahr, ICI said. He reportedly had been detained before his death. <BR> <B>...Ravanbakhsh, 35, was a Muslim convert to Christianity</B>, considered an apostate by Muslims. He converted at age 24 and studied theology at the Garden of Sharon Bible School in Karaj, Iran. He had been a clergyman for about six years, appointed by the late Bishop Haik Hovsepian-Mehr, director of the  Assemblies of God in Iran. Ravanbakhsh served as a pastor in Sari, Gorgan, and Ghaem-Shahr, Iran. He leaves a wife and two small children.  <BR> <B>...Recent reports reveal that persecution of Iranian Muslim converts to Christianity in Iran</B>, as well as other evangelical Christians, is more severe and widespread than previous reports indicated, the Colorado Springs-based ICI said. Christians continue to be arrested, imprisoned, and tortured because of their faith. Some are kept under surveillance with their phones tapped and letters opened, and others have received death threats, ICI said. Some have lost or been denied jobs, housing, or education. <BR> <B>...&quot;When will these atrocities against Christians end,&quot;</B> a spokesman for ICI asked. &quot;Some pastors and Christian leaders in the West have led a conspiracy of silence. Pastors and church leaders in Iran have been pressured into denying the severe persecution to the world. Therefore, some Western countries have ironically found Iran to be a safe country where Iranian Muslim convert refugees can return,&quot; the group said.    </font></p>

Sins of the past</H3>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A group of Christians has begun an 800-mile prayer expedition through Georgia and the Carolinas</B> to break &quot;spiritual strongholds&quot; there. The walkers, who set out Oct. 1, will &quot;retrace the path of  destruction inflicted by Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's army during the Civil War.&quot; Union soldiers burned towns and farms, killed livestock, and committed atrocities as they cut a 60-90 mile swath through the region in 1865. <BR> <B>...Sherman left a bitter spiritual legacy that remains to this day</B>, contributing to the existence of  racism, lingering regional animosities, and occult sites, said walk organizer Gene Brooks of Global Harvest Ministries. Prayer &quot;intercessors&quot; will ask forgiveness for the Union soldiers' deeds and petition God to &quot;clear this obstacle to nationwide revival and spiritual awakening in the United States.&quot; Brooks, who has done an extensive study of the region's history, scouted the march's path last year in preparation for the Oct. 1-Nov. 15 walk. <BR> <B>...The march is one of several around the world</B> by Christians who are &quot;walking, praying, repenting, and forgiving in a global air assault on the Kingdom of Darkness,&quot; Brooks said. In Europe, Christians began a 2,000-mile, three year walk in April to retrace the steps of the 11th-century Crusaders in order to apologize to Muslims and Jews for atrocities committed. The Reconciliation Walk proceeds along several paths through the Balkans and Turkey. Walkers plan to converge in Jerusalem in July 1999.  <BR> <B>...A formal declaration of apology to Muslims</B> already has resulted in several instances of reconciliation among Muslims and Christians. In Cologne, Germany, 125 Christians presented a written apology to 200 Muslim clerics. A senior imam, or Muslim teacher, accepted it and sent copies of  the statement to 600 mosques throughout the continent. Marchers also read the statement in Ravensbruck, Germany, site of a Nazi concentration camp. Two days later, a delegation from the Ravensbruck synagogue told the marchers that since the apology was read, &quot;they didn't know what had happened, but they had been crying continually,&quot; marcher Cathy Nobles said. At a Turkish church on Sept. 1, Muslim converts to Christianity asked forgiveness for their hatred of Christians. They had been taught stories of the Crusaders and always had feared and distrusted Westerners -- even fellow Christians -- they said.  <BR> <B>...The response to the walks has been positive</B>, although some Christians question the theological basis for Christians to confess sins of  their predecessors. But when forgiveness and reconciliation occur, theological debates become secondary, one scholar said. <BR>      </font></p>

Movie theaters have been closed, the television station shut down, and the playing of all music banned, the <I>Times </I>reported. All men in government jobs have been ordered to grow untrimmed beards, and Western-style suits have been banned. Girls' schools have been closed, women with jobs have been ordered to stay home, and, when venturing out, to wear a full gown. <BR> <B>...Kabul's capture has brought some peace to the city,</B> weary from a 22-month siege in the country's civil war. Residents now are able to move around without fear of long-range artillery, which had killed 30,000 people and left much of the city in rubble. Kabul residents also are talking about an end to the long civil war across Afghanistan. Some have long said they would sacrifice almost anything to achieve peace, the <I>Times</I> reported.    </font></p>

Missionaries in Russia have a new sense of urgency</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The harvest of souls continues in the former Soviet Union. </B> Approximately 4,000 new evangelical fellowships have started in the past five years in the Commonwealth of Independent States, according to Peter Deyneka Russian Ministries. <BR> <B>...Russian Christians say church-planting is the most effective way to evangelize the CIS</B>. Several church-planting initiatives have begun. One initiative is Project 250, a cooperative effort among Russian Ministries, TEAM, CBInternational, Harvester Ministries, InterAct, individual Southern Baptist missionaries, and Russian Christian leaders. Project 250 has trained 1,000 Christians in methods of church-planting. The trained nationals are starting churches that reach all segments of society,  including alcoholics, former adherents of pagan and Eastern religions, drug addicts, prisoners, the physically handicapped, and people in isolated Arctic and Siberian regions. <BR> <B>...Other church planters are working in Moslem areas</B>, the isolated islands of Kamchatka, and the war-torn areas of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. Others are planting churches in cities. Some missionary-evangelists have left their homes to start churches in less familiar, more remote areas, such as the Arctic and the borders of China, where there are few evangelical churches, Deyneka said. The long-term goal of national Christians is to establish an evangelical church in every CIS community. <BR> <B>...Other evangelists are planting churches among the estimated 610,000 people</B> who made professions of faith in Christ during a series of evangelistic television programs aired by the Christian Broadcasting Network during the last five years. Many of  those believers still have no church. The church-planting effort is a cooperative venture among CBN, Wheaton, Ill.-based Russian Ministries, and Garden Grove, Calif.-based Assist Ministries.<B> </B>Almost all of the new believers were teenagers when they watched the program.<B> </B> The show,<B> </B><I>What Are you Living For?</I> was cohosted by Barry Taylor, a former equipment manager for the heavy metal band AC/DC. Taylor now is a Los Angeles pastor. <BR> <B>...Increasing political instability in Russia</B>, in part caused by Boris Yeltsin's fragile health, has created a new sense of urgency to train Russian nationals to take over for Westerners, missionaries say. The country's social fabric also is fraying. About two million Russians  take illegal drugs and 15% of the country's 150 million people have had contact with narcotics, government officials say. Police are short of funds to prevent the spread of drugs, which leads to more crime and AIDS, Reuters news service said. &quot;To say the least, we just don't know what's going to happen,&quot; Assist's Dan Wooding  told Religion News Today. &quot;The quicker we can equip them the better.&quot; <BR> <B>...Among those emphasizing the equipping of nationals is the CoMission. </B>The group -- a partnership of  dozens of Western Christian schools, foundations, relief agencies, parachurch groups, missions agencies, churches, and denominations -- has taught biblical principles in CIS schools. But after 1997, the CoMission will emphasize preparation of  nationals to lead churches and cell groups. CoMission II will begin Jan. 1, 1998, after the expiration of the group's self-imposed four-year term has expired. Many CoMission I agencies will continue to work together under the new partnership, according to King Crow, CoMission executive director. <BR> <B>...Many more nationals must be trained as theological teachers, </B>according to nearly 100 national and Western church leaders who met in Kiev Sept. 9-13 to plan evangelistic strategies. The leaders said they will develop a plan to train the leaders and form the Eurasian Theological Accrediting Association to assure quality at theological schools.    </font></p>

Persecution: Christians becoming world's scapegoats?</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A campaign to help persecuted Christians is beginning to show results</B>.  The Clinton Administration is forming a committee of  20 prominent religious leaders and scholars to advise the U.S. secretary of state on problems of religious oppression and intolerance. The panel, which will be housed in the State Department, will make recommendations in areas such as diplomacy, refugees, and using religious leaders to resolve disputes. Last month, the Senate and House passed similar non-binding resolution condemning abuses of Christians around the world and calling on responsible governments to stop the persecution. <BR> <B>...Persecution of Christians around the world is continuing at an alarming rate</B>.<B> </B>It is among the most severe human rights problems in the world, various observers say. More people have been martyred for their Christian faith in the 20th century than in the previous 19 centuries combined, according to <I>World Missions Digest</I>. In <I>By Their Blood</I>, authors James and Marti Hefley say 100 million Christians have been persecuted since 1900, resulting in more deaths from persecution than in all the wars of this century combined. Statistics are only estimates since much of the persecution is done covertly, Dwight Gibson of the World Evangelical Fellowship told <I>Religion News Today</I>.  <BR> <B>...Christians may soon replace Jews as the number one scapegoat in most of the world, </B> according to Michael Horowitz , a senior fellow at the Washington-based Hudson Institute. &quot;The persecution of Jews in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s is almost a perfect mirror image of what's happening to Christians as we enter the 21st century,&quot; he said.  <A HREF= http://www.Freedomhouse.org >Freedom House's Puebla Program on Religious Freedom </A>has complied a catalogue of victimized Christians.  <BR> <B>...Christians are jailed and tortured.</B> The oppressors are largely Communist regimes such as Cuba and North Korea and from militant Muslim movements in the Middle East. In North Korea, the government has tried to stamp out Christianity and established an official state religion -- <I>Juche</I>, or self-reliance -- that requires worship of the nation's leaders, the World Evangelical Fellowship said. Christians also are severely persecuted because of their faith in countries such as Sudan, Vietnam, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, and Iran, various groups say. <BR> .<B>...China has more Christians in prison for their faith than any other country</B>. This year has been the most repressive for Catholics and Protestants since the late 1970, according to American Christians working there.  Chinese police are circulating warrants for the arrest of 3,000 evangelical preachers, while thousands of others &quot;languish in China's religious gulag&quot; for defying Communist government orders that ban free worship, Freedom House said. <BR> <B>...Converting from Christianity to Islam is punishable by death in several Islamic countries</B>. In many countries Christians are imprisoned, enslaved, tortured and killed because of their faith. In Pakistan, a 13-year-old boy fled the country after he was convicted under Pakistan's blasphemy law. His uncle, who also converted, was shot dead by some in a mob outside the courthouse. Three Christians were kidnapped and murdered in Iran in 1994 as part of a crackdown on the Iranian Christian community. Several monks were beheaded May 20 in Algeria. Catholic bishops and priests and Protestant pastors are routinely imprisoned, Bibles are confiscated, and churches raided in Vietnam and other countries. <BR> <B>...An Islamic court in Kuwait declared Robert Hussein,  a convert from Islam to Christianity,</B>  guilty of apostasy this May. The presiding judge, Jaafar al-Mazidi, affirmed the Islamic teaching that says, &quot;If one who is born from two Muslim parents should commit apostasy, the Imam should kill him without a chance to repent.&quot; Hussein went into hiding and, after an outpouring of protests from the international community, came to the United States. <BR> <B>...American Christians remain largely silent about the persecution.  </B>Church leaders say the problem is not new, and they have feared speaking out would jeopardize missionaries abroad, but now say something must be done. &quot;It would be an absolute travesty if we were to turn a deaf ear to the cries of the persecuted,&quot; said Steven Snyder, head of Washington, D.C.-based International Christian Concern. He has monitored the persecution of Christians for 10 years. &quot;We have a biblical mandate to remember those in prison and those ill-treated as if you were their fellow prisoners,&quot; he said. Christians in the West can help by staying alert to the plight of  persecuted  believers and launching letter-writing campaigns to political leaders, observers say.  <BR> <B>...The first International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church</B> Sept. 29 was intended to draw attention to the problem. The event was initiated by the <A HREF= http://www.xc.org/wef/ > World Evangelical Fellowship </A>, a group representing 150 million evangelical Christians in 110 countries. Evangelical alliances and supporting organizations from 106 countries on all seven continents joined 40 denominational and parachurch groups in the United States to support the Day of Prayer.     </font></p>

The crusade, two years in the planning, was held at the new Ericsson Stadium and reportedly cost $2.8 million. It featured guests such as former NFL football coach Joe Gibbs, Johnny Cash, the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir, the Charlie Daniels Band, Joni Erickson Tada, the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra, and a 7,000-voice choir. It was the fifteenth crusade Graham has conducted in the Carolinas. <BR> <B>...Graham, seeking to leave his mark on the next generation, also emphasized youth.</B> Saturday night's high-volume rock concert featured Christian contemporary music groups dc Talk and Michael W. Smith as well as a short sermon by Graham. The evening drew 88,000 rain-soaked teens to the stadium, including 13,000 who watched from a large screen outside. As Graham gave his familiar invitation to follow Christ, thousands of teens left their places and covered the infield. A Saturday-morning crusade event also drew 30,000 children for a service that included cartoon characters and Bible lessons. <BR> <B>...On the last night of  the crusade, Graham warned his audience.</B>  He compared modern society's lust for pleasure to the biblical city of Sodom, saying people have perverted the &quot;marvelous gift&quot; of sex. &quot;Armageddon is going to come. There's going to be a great disturbance in the whole world,&quot; he told the stadium crowd, a mixture of young and old, evangelical and Roman Catholic. Graham said the greatest surprise of his life has been life's brevity. He told the audience they will have to take a stand, one way or the other, regarding Jesus Christ. <BR> <B>...Graham is not quitting crusades yet</B>, even though some thought the Charlotte homecoming would have made a fitting career finale. Graham, who is increasingly frail and suffers from Parkinson's Disease, has booked crusades next year in Texas and California, and may go to South Africa and Brazil. His son Franklin, also an evangelist, will fill in if his father is too sick to preach. <BR> <B>...&quot;I pray for strength every day,&quot;</B> Graham told reporters at his home in Montreat, N.C., recently. God eventually will &quot;retire me by illness or some other reason. But I have no plans because God called me to preach and I intend to preach as long as I have strength to do so.&quot; <BR> <B>...Graham has written an autobiography.</B> <I>Just As I Am, </I>which will detail the evangelist's life in and out of the public eye, will be out next year, said HarperCollins Publishers/Zondervan Publishing House.    </font></p>

<B>As many as 2.5 billion people saw the Billy Graham World Television Series this month, the
Billy Graham Evangelistic Association said</B>. The gospel message was aired in more than 200
countries, most on prime-time television. 
<BR><B>...The April 14 Starting Over program took the gospel to more people on a single day than
possibly any other day in history, the BGEA's Bob Williams said</B>. National networks in about
120 countries, including 250 markets in the United States, aired it in prime time, and satellites
beamed it to 45 nations in Asia and Europe. Other countries saw the show on various days
this month. 
<BR><B>...Congregants from more than 1 million churches worldwide were to host house parties so
friends and relatives could view the event</B>. A training program called Operation Matthew
encouraged Christians to invite others to watch the program and discuss the message. An
average of 19 homes per church were to have had parties with three to 30 guests.  
<BR><B>...In South Africa, 50,000 home cell groups were planning parties, David Molapo, the
BGEA's committee chairman there, told NIRR</B>. The event brought the country's ministers
together, he said. Some 467 religious groups of all races, political parties, and denominations
were cooperating. "It is a blessing that men and women of God are forgetting our differences
and coming together to promote the gospel," he said. Youth for Christ and Every Home for
Christ planned to videotape the program and travel to rural villages with a TV, VCR, and
generator, Molapo said. Others intended to make audio tapes of the show and ask bus and
taxi services to have them played on regular routes.
<BR><B>...Other countries also made effective use of the program</B>. A Nicaraguan pastor's wife
convinced a school to have its 2,000 students prepare a report on the program, said Edwin
Martinez, a missionary to Latin America cooperating with the BGEA. In Cochabamba,
Bolivia, Christian radio and TV stations aired daily shows promoting personal evangelism. In
Costa Rica, 5,000 homes enlisted in Operation Matthew; in Mexico, 10,000 churches
participated; and in Argentina 17 church councils coordinated efforts. In Angola, a Christian
broadcasting company aired discipleship-training programs prior to the event. In Moldova,
100 churches cooperated to reach their communities.
<BR><B>...Foreign television network executives jumped at the opportunity to air Starting Over
because of its appeal to young people and extensive translation, Williams said</B>. Most
international programs are translated into eight or 10 languages, but the Graham broadcast
was translated into 48, allowing more people to watch. Excited at the prospect of the wider
prime-time audience, some executives planned to show it more than once.
<BR><B>...The program was different from anything the BGEA has done</B>. Unlike a typical crusade
broadcast, the one-hour program used strong visual images, drama, and music to emphasize
Graham's message. "MTV-style" visual techniques, such as switching between color and
black-and-white images and rapidly shifting scenes, were meant to reflect people's desperate
search for happiness. "It is designed to hit you right between your eyes," Williams said. The
program was intended for the cynical who would never attend a Billy Graham crusade. One
video editor became a Christian after viewing hours of the tape because he identified with a
character who was successful but felt something missing in his life. "I realized that I am
existing, not really living," he told Williams. 
<BR><B>...The World Television Series also included the BGEA WorldWide Pictures films Cry from
the Mountain and Power Play, which were aired in most of the countries prior to April 14</B>.
The series was scheduled for Eastertime because some countries will air Christian material
only during a holiday season, according to Williams.
<BR><B>...Graham is "willing to take risks for the gospel and won't rest on his laurels," Williams said</B>.
The satellite ministry allowed the 77-year-old evangelist to keep having an impact without the
physical drain of a crusade, he said. NIRR 4/15/96

<B>A Bhutanese evangelist said a warning from God led to his release from prison and the start
of a new church</B>. "Brother Phillip" was falsely accused of murder after a young child fell into
a river and drowned while watching him baptize new Christians, Asian Outreach's David
Wang told NIRR. The 23-year-old was kept in a small cell and shackled to an iron ball for 14
months as he awaited trial. One day, while staring at a dry river bed from his cell, Phillip
said, God told him to leave the prison. He requested and was given a transfer to a nearby
hospital, and that night a dam broke, flooding the jail and killing 100 prisoners. When he told
his story to prison authorities, they immediately released him, said Wang, who recently
returned from Bhutan. Phillip then began a church that has grown to 800 members in five
months. There are about 1,500 Christians in house churches across the country, Wang said. 
<BR><B>...The traditionally Buddhist country is easing restrictions on Christian worship and
evangelism, Wang said</B>. Bhutan, in the eastern Himalayas, has strictly forbidden evangelism,
proselytism, and worship for a thousand years. But the country's new king was educated by
Anglican and Catholic missionaries in India and believes that a stronger Christian influence
will help society. Bhutan's first Catholic priest, the king's cousin, was ordained in January.

<B>The Kwasizabantu Mission of South Africa "is as close to heaven you can find on Earth</B>."
About 1,200 tribal people live at the complex, where they receive Christian teaching and learn
farming techniques, Bill Bathman of Arizona-based In Touch Mission International said. The
mission, located outside Durban, includes a school, radio station, and conference center that
attracts ministers and other Christian workers. Last month, the Kwasizabantu pastors'
conference brought together 1,000 clergy from 14 African nations and 50 denominations. The
eighth annual conference, titled Revival and Reformation, produced a document calling
individuals, churches, and governments to repentance.
<BR><B>..."Evangelism is when you go out to people, but revival is when they come to you," Bathman
said</B>. Since 1976, the 800-acre farm has been in revival and ministered to hundreds of
thousands of tribal people, the mission's Kjell Olsen told NIRR. People from surrounding
areas come to its evening services and every year thousands become Christians. The ministry
teaches them to break with spiritism and ancestor worship, Bathman said. Before people are
baptized, they are required to burn all witchcraft and other religious paraphernalia during a
public service. Afterward, they are trained in farming techniques to make them
self-supporting. Many of the mission's former residents minister among the 10 tribal nations
in South Africa and others have made missions trips to Russia, Romania, Canada, and South
American countries, he said. NIRR 4/15/96
<P>
<B>Christians in Southern Sudan welcomed short-term missionaries with singing, dancing, and a
lavish feast last month</B>. The team from Capetown, South Africa-based Frontline Fellowship
was the first group of outsiders to visit the Mundri district in years, Frontline's Peter
Hammond said. They came to address an Episcopal Church conference, conduct pastors'
training courses, and hold services for Sudan People's Liberation Army forces. Because other
church gatherings have been bombed by Khartoum's Islamic government forces, the
conference was held at a compound constructed in the jungle. Hundreds of Christians
converged on the compound from all directions, Hammond said. 
<BR><B>...The area, known as Moruland, has had a strong Christian influence</B>. More than 80% of
Morus say they are Christian, and the area has a high literacy rate and low incidence of
leprosy and other diseases, Hammond said. The 300,000-member Episcopal Diocese in
Moruland is large and vigorous, having 24 parishes, 130 preaching centers, 45 pastors, and 65
lay preachers. The missionaries were "literally mobbed" by eager Morus when they began
passing out Bibles and other devotional literature, Hammond said. SPLA forces in Maridi
sang Christian hymns and cheered as Hammond preached, he said. NIRR 4/15/96
<P>
<B>An independent Pentecostal church movement is growing in Naples, Italy</B>. Since 1981, Tonio
and Michele Romeo have planted 25 churches in the harbor city, some in areas frequented by
drug dealers and prostitutes. Their method of "friendship evangelism" has worked well in the
heavily Catholic country, news reports said. The ministry first sends teams of about a dozen
people to hold open-air worship services or simply perform music. They are there to be

The pastors and laity, organized by 400 workers from the South Tampa (Fla.) Christian
Center, began five weeks of outreach late last month. About 200 residents of the Stanton
Dwellings project in the Anacostia area came forward to receive Christ during an altar call.
Prayer teams are filtering through the neighborhoods, and thousands of other Christians
around the country are fasting and praying for Washington residents.
<BR><B>...The outreach leads up to Washington for Jesus '96, a massive, two-day rally on the Capitol
steps</B>. On April 30, Pentecostal, charismatic, evangelical, and other Christians from around the
country will pray against persecution of believers, homosexuality, abortion, racism, addictions,
occultism, and AIDS, organizers said. That will be preceded by a youth rally in front of the
Capitol from noon to 11 p.m. April 29. Previous WFJ rallies drew half a million people in
1980 and one million in 1988, the group said. The organizer is John Gimenez, co-pastor with

<B>Membership in a number of mainline Protestant denominations continues to decline,
according to the National Council of Churches' 1996 Yearbook of American and Canadian
Churches</B>. The biggest mainline decline since last year's edition was suffered by the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). It lost 98,630 members, a 2.6% drop. The United Church of
Christ lost 28,868 members (1.89%), and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), lost
20,373 members (2.13%). 
<BR><B>...Churches that grew include: the Catholic Church, up 332,563 members (.56%); Southern
Baptist Convention, up 215,418 (1.4%); Mormon Church, up 93,000 (2.1%); Assemblies of
God, up 52,897 (2.3%); Jehovah's Witnesses, up 19,376 (2.1%); and Seventh-day Adventist
Church, up 13,646 (1.8%)</B>.    
<BR><B>...Contributions rose, even in churches that are losing members</B>. Nearly all of those providing
contribution figures for the 1996 yearbook showed increases. The Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.) had a 4.8% increase, to a total of $2.1 billion. The United Church of Christ reported
a .3% increase for a total of $623.8 million. The Disciples of Christ registered a 3.3% rise, to
$385.5 million. The 47 U.S. church bodies that gave financial data reported $18.5 trillion in
total contributions, an average of $413.66 per member.
<BR><B>...The Roman Catholic Church remained the nation's largest religious body, with 60,190,605
members</B>. It is followed by the Southern Baptist Convention, 15,614,060; the United
Methodist Church, 8,584,125; the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc., 8,200,000;

<B>A decade after the Jesus Seminar began its search for the historical Jesus, it is struggling to
find a new direction</B>. The seminar's 75 self-appointed scholars asked two questions: What did
Jesus really say? What did Jesus really do? They concluded that Jesus was a teacher who did
not walk on water, resist Satan in the desert, or raise Lazarus from the dead (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21/95</A>).
The scholars said they doubt whether Jesus said many quotes attributed to him and believe
the resurrection could have been an act of mass hysteria by Jesus' followers unable to come
to terms with his death. Their findings first were published in 1993 as The Five Gospels: The
Search for the Authentic Words of Jesus (Macmillan). A follow-up, The Acts of Jesus: The
Search for the Authentic Deeds of Jesus (Little, Brown and Co.), is to be published next year.
<BR><B>...Since many of their claims deal with what Jesus didn't say or do, the scholars are
wondering what positive things they can say about Jesus</B>. Last month in Santa Rosa, Calif.,
the scholars agreed to pursue a book project containing brief portraits of Jesus compiled from
conclusions the seminar reached. Other plans include producing a new history of the gospel
tradition and continuing a new translation of the letters of Paul.
<BR><B>...Media coverage of the Jesus Seminar has been extensive</B>. Over Easter, all three major
secular news magazines had cover stories raising questions about what can be believed in the
gospels. "Some scholars are debunking the Gospels. Now traditionalists are fighting back.
What are Christians to believe?" asked Time Magazine. Newsweek said people are
"Rethinking the Resurrection," and U.S. News & World Report asked about Jesus, "Who Was
He?" NIRR 4/15/96

The city of St. Louis subpoenaed one church's records and said it may do the same to other
congregations to verify the residency of municipal employees, who are required to live in
town. City counselor Tyrone Taborn said city employees agree when they are hired to allow
such investigations.
<BR><B>..."I was just appalled and couldn't believe it," said pastor Rudy Pulido of Southwest Baptist
Church, who organized a protest against the policy</B>. A coalition of pastors, the American Civil
Liberties Union, and Americans United for Separation of Church and State told the city in a
letter that its action was "a serious breach" of First Amendment rights. St. Louis did not show
a "compelling interest" in getting the records from churches since it had other ways to get the
information, including using data from public utilities, banks, voter registrations, and public
schools, Pulido told NIRR. In a letter responding to Pulido, Taborn agreed to subpoena
church records "only as a last resort" to seek residence information and "not to inquire about
their religious beliefs and activities." He promised to consult with Pulido's attorney before
any such subpoena. NIRR 4/15/96

accounted for 2.5% of all music sales. By 1994, that increased to 3.3%, amounting to $390
million -- about the same as classical and jazz, according to news reports. A Gospel Music
Association study showed that from 1991-1995, Christian music sales averaged 22% growth

<BR><B>...Recognizing the sales potential, major music companies have purchased the largest gospel
music labels, including Sparrow, StarSong, and Reunion</B>. The added distribution power has

compensation higher than market value for services rendered can be fined up to 25% of the
amount found to be excessive. Failure to comply can result in fines of 200% the amount,
according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy.

requests. Currently, charities are required only to show the forms, not provide copies, to those

<B>Another federal court has ruled in favor of the right-to-die movement</B>. The 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled that New York state's ban on assisted suicide violates the Constitution
by failing to treat individuals equally. Judges said it made no sense to allow doctors to
disconnect life-support systems from some patients while forcing them to preserve the lives of
others. The ruling by the 2nd Circuit gave more credibility to a decision by the 9th Circuit in
San Francisco, which voted to strike down Washington state's assisted-suicide ban (NIRR
4/1). Observers said the issue is likely to reach the Supreme Court by the end of the year.
<BR><B>...The rulings have left legal and medical ethicists stunned</B>. The courts have "short-circuited
the societal debate and created the right almost overnight," Arthur Caplan, director of the
Center for Bio-Ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, told the press. The centuries-old
prohibitions on assisted suicide are meant to hold the line against self-destructive acts due to
depression, despair, exhaustion, or misguided compassion, Americans United for Life said.
<BR><B>...The ruling jeopardizes "over 2,000 years of medical, legal, and moral protections," the
Christian Medical and Dental Society and the Christian Legal Society said in a joint

<B>Anti-government militia groups such as the Montana Freemen teach a racist 19th-century

displaced the Jews as the "true Israelites," that the United States is the new Promised Land,
and that it should belong solely to white Christians, according to Kenneth Stern's new book,
A Force Upon the Plain: The American Militia Movement and the Politics of Hate (Simon &

be taken back by struggle. Jews are considered the offspring of Satan, and blacks are
considered their lackeys, a sub-human species created before Adam and Eve.
<BR><B>...Christian Identity claims 35,000 members in the United States</B>. It also taps into a broader

<B>Abortion providers say they anticipate that the U.S</B>. government soon will approve

A two-drug combination, designed for ending pregnancies before the ninth week, induces
abortion over several days (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/090895.html">NIRR 9/8/95</A>). The method can be performed in a doctor's office
without special equipment. It involves an injection of methotrexate, which interferes with cell
division, killing the fetus. Several days after the injection, a second drug, misoprostol, brings
on uterine contractions, causing the fetus to be expelled, usually within a day. A third visit to
the doctor is required to confirm that the abortion was complete. The Food and Drug
Administration has not yet approved such abortions.
<BR><B>...Meanwhile, a nonprofit research group finished testing the French abortion pill RU-486 on
2,100 American women and asked the FDA to allow it for sale in the United States</B>. The

<B>A former X-rated movie theater will become a Christian coffeehouse</B>. New Life Christian
Church of Fort Wayne, Ind., plans to renovate the crumbling, two-story Cinema Blue building
and use it to reach inner-city youth. Cinema Blue, one of 42 properties the city took over
because of unpaid taxes and then donated to nonprofit groups, will be called The Promise
Cafe. It will serve beverages and snacks, host Bible studies, and feature Christian bands,
pastor Larry Merino said. "We're committed to the inner city and wherever we feel a need to
help." 
<P>
<B>When two young men in ski caps, each brandishing a gun, walked into the sanctuary March 9
at Primera Iglesia Bautista La Hermosa in Leisure City, Fla., the congregation and pastor
Guillermo Pichs thought it was part of a skit</B>. It wasn't. The young men began using
profanity, robbed women of $1,400 in jewelry, and fled. The church reportedly has been
burglarized 12 times, including once when the organ was stolen.
<P>
<B>Religion stories represent about 1% of network news coverage, according to a study by the
Alexandria, Va.-based Media Research Center</B>. Of 18,000 evening news stories, 249 dealt
with religion. Entertainment shows had 287 religious portrayals in 1,800 hours of original
programming, according to Faith in a Box (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/041795.html">NIRR 4/17/95</A>). But "the more seriously a person
takes his faith, the more negative the depiction is likely to be," MRC chairman Brent Bozell
said. 
<P>
<B>The Los Angeles Times, which chose not to publish a B.C</B>. comic strip with a Christian
theme March 31, published the strip April 6 after protests by readers. The strip, which
focused on the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, was drawn by cartoonist Johnny Hart, a
professing Christian. Readers were alerted to the Times' decision by Pat Robertson on the 700
Club. A Times spokesman said editors sometimes decide to omit comics, and are mindful that
the paper is "a secular publication serving a large and quite diverse and pluralistic
community." The Times recently was criticized for publishing a political cartoon across from
the editorial page that portrayed Sen. Bob Dole being crucified on a cross with a crown of
thorns labeled "Christian Coalition" on his head.
<P>
<B>A group of liberal rabbis endorsed legalizing same-sex marriages</B>. However, the rabbis are
under no obligation to perform such ceremonies, according to the Central Conference of
American Rabbis, the umbrella group of the most liberal rabbis of the three major branches of
Judaism. "We mustn't put our heads in the sand," Reform Rabbi Uri Regev said, according to
news reports. Reform rabbis have performed such religious unions for some time, but more
Orthodox Jewish rabbinical groups believe that same-sex unions violate Jewish law. 
<P>
<B>Three Catholic bishops are members of Call to Action, a group named in an excommunication
threat by Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/040196.html">NIRR 4/1</A>)</B>. Bruskewitz said he would expel members of
his Nebraska diocese who belong to 12 groups, including Call to Action, which advocates
women's ordination and clergy marriage. Other groups include Planned Parenthood, the
Hemlock Society, Catholics for a Free Choice, Masons, and those that support exclusive use
of Latin in the Mass. Call to Action members include bishops Raymond Lucker of New Ulm,
Minn., Thomas Gumbleton of Detroit, and Charles Buswell of Pueblo, Colo., news reports
said.
<P>
<B>Catholics at Regent University set up the Stations of the Cross on the campus lawn on Good
Friday</B>. "It's been wonderful to witness [other] Christian students come out here and watch us.
They realize that we love the Lord as much as they do," said Keith Fournier, executive
director of the American Center for Law and Justice, which is located on the Virginia Beach
school's grounds.
<P>
<B>A courtroom prayer caused a mistrial in Durant, Okla</B>. At the opening of a doctor's murder
trial, minister Wyndell Glenn prayed for the guilty to "step up to the plate of justice" and
asked that they be made to pay for their sins. He then spent several more minutes in the
courtroom praying with the victim's family and blessing individual jurors, who are members
of his church, in front of the defendant's relatives. Defense attorney Garvin Isaacs considered
the prayer a condemnation of his client. The case has been moved about 30 miles away and
court officials are examining the practice of having clergy pray.
<P>
<B>Seventy-nine percent of Americans think faith can help people recover from illness, injury, or
disease and 63% say doctors should discuss faith with their patients, according to a survey
taken by ICR Survey Research Group</B>. Nine in 10 people never have had a doctor talk to
them about their faith, the survey found. David Stevens of the Christian Medical & Dental
Society encouraged doctors to "open the door for the patient to discuss faith if he or she
chooses." 
<P>
<B>The Tennessee Senate killed a bill that would have allowed, but not required, school boards
to fire teachers who present evolution as fact (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/031896.html">NIRR 3/18</A>)</B>. Sen. Tommy Burks described his
bill, defeated 20-13, as an attempt to clear up confusion over what can be taught in
classrooms, news reports said. But other senators said the bill was an intrusion by the
Legislature into school curriculum. Some lawmakers worried how constituents would interpret
their vote. "I can't vote for this bill, but I don't want anybody to think I don't know God,"
said Lt. Gov. John Wilder, who presided over the debate.
<P>
<B>The California Supreme Court upheld a 1987 law requiring unmarried minors to obtain
parental consent or a judge's approval to have an abortion</B>. An alternative is a judge's ruling
that the minor is mature enough to make the decision or that an abortion is in her best
interest. Lower courts ruled that the law violates privacy rights under the state constitution.

<B>Algeria: Islamic fundamentalists abducted seven Trappist monks from their monastery in

kidnappings, news reports said.

<B>Mozambique: The Universal Church of the Kingdom of God (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/010896.html">NIRR 1/8</A>) is being criticized
by the government and media</B>. Officials say members are forced to give the church all their
money, but members say the government is persecuting the church. Mozambique is one of the
poorest countries in the world. The UCKG, based in Brazil, is under investigation in that
nation for alleged financial misdeeds.   Nigeria: About 60 Christians will be tried en masse
for allegedly inciting a religious war. The charges stem from violence in July 1995, when 31
Christian villages and seven Muslim villages were destroyed and hundreds of people killed.
While it is believed more Christians than Muslims were killed, few Muslims are being tried,
the International Institute for the Study of Islam and Christianity said. 
<P>
<B>Somalia: Islamic groups dedicated to creating a Muslim state receive financial aid from
wealthy backers in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations</B>. Various parts of the country have
adopted Sharia law and the trend is accelerating, according to the International Institute for
the Study of Islam and Christianity. Christians in the country number less than 2,000 and the
Somali press has been printing negative articles about them, the group said.

<B>China: The committee overseeing next year's takeover of Hong Kong will allow Christmas,
Good Friday, and Easter to remain official holidays</B>. It also decided to abolish the

schedule, according to news reports.
<P>
<B>Cyprus: The Greek Orthodox Church in Cyprus dropped its charges against Archimandrite
Pangratios Meraclis (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/040196.html">NIRR 4/1</A>)</B>. Meraclis was accused of homosexuality by Archbishop
Chrysostomos. He has been reinstated to the priesthood, but is not allowed to immediately
seek the bishopric of Morphou, where he is intensely popular. The church gave no reason for
its action, news reports said.
<P>
<B>Israel: Eleven Christian church leaders called on the government to lift its blockade of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip</B>. Lutheran, Anglican, Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox,
Armenian Catholic, Ethiopian, Coptic, Greek Catholic, Latin Rite Catholic, Syrian Orthodox,
and Syrian Catholic leaders signed a letter on behalf of Palestinians denied the right to work
by the blockade. The government took the action after 58 people were killed in terrorist
attacks. While expressing sympathy for the victims' families, "we feel the pain of every home
and family deprived of jobs," the clerics wrote.

<B>Brazil: About 50 Brazilian Lutherans participated in a foot-washing service at a meeting in
Nuevo Hamburgo last month, according to Religion-Political Digest</B>. Hosted by the Lutheran
Grassroots Pastoral Association, the meeting brought Lutheran lay leaders together with
ministers of the Evangelical Church in the Lutheran Confession. The service stimulated
discussion on the need for Christians to be humble and to serve others.
<P>
<B>Costa Rica: A survey shows that 85% of the population believes in a loving God who
supports and comforts people and answers prayer, news reports said</B>. About 88% believe in
heaven, 66% believe in hell, and 54% and 33%, respectively, believe in purgatory and
reincarnation. The survey showed a discrepancy between belief and action: only 42% attend
Mass regularly in the officially Catholic country. The results also showed that many Costa
Ricans mix religious belief with tradition and superstition. 
<P>
<B>El Salvador: In a homily last month, the archbishop of San Salvador forgave the murderers of
Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero</B>. Romero, a harsh critic of the military and right-wing
death squads, was known as the "voice for those with no voice." He was shot to death as he
celebrated Mass in a hospital in 1980.

<B>Bulgaria: The Patriarch of the Orthodox Church was threatened with arrest after he and four
bodyguards took over a Sofia candle factory</B>. Patriarch Maxim said that the factory is illegal
because it is run by priests who are in rebellion against him. The clerics accused Maxim of
being a puppet of the old Communist regime. Led by Metropolitan Pimen, the priests split
from the Eastern Orthodox Church after the government collapsed in 1989. 
<P>
<B>England: Hindus are praying for the protection of cattle that may be slaughtered because of
mad cow disease</B>. The Eastern religion considers cows sacred.  As officials debated whether
to kill the herds, Swami Ramesh Mashru urged their protection. "The cows should be allowed
to reach a natural death," he said. About 140,000 Hindus live in England, news reports said.
<P>
<B>Germany: The Evangelical Church in Germany may begin ordaining practicing homosexuals</B>.
"If such a step is necessary for the sake of truth and love, then we must dare take it," reads
Living With Tensions, ECG's 55-page report on the subject. The ECG comprises 24 church
bodies and represents most Protestants in Germany, news reports said.
<P>
<B>Moldova: A leading finance company is paying a group of Eastern Orthodox monks to pray
for its prosperity</B>. Exiton Finance Group signed a contract with the monks at Noul Neamt
monastery, promising to support its operation and help recover lost icons in return for the
prayers. After signing the contract, company executives and monks prayed together.

<B>Portugal: The first Portuguese edition of the Full Life Bible Study, an Assemblies of God
publication, "is a significant milestone," said missionary Linda Stamps, whose husband wrote
many of the study's notes</B>. More than 100,000 copies of the book have been sold in three
months, the AG reported. Copies of the study also have been released in Brazil.  
<P>
<B>Russia: The Communist Party has removed its official doctrine of atheism from its charter</B>.
But the act is merely a ploy to gain the support of the Russian Orthodox Church, observers
said. Both democratic and communist politicians are trying to ingratiate themselves with the
church "in a cheap attempt to get its blessing and more votes from believers," said former
priest Gleb Yakunin (NIRR 4/18/94), once a member of the Duma. The country is in the
midst of a presidential election campaign, which will culminate in June. 
<P>
<B>Russia: The Russian Orthodox Church expressed a desire to mend its break with the Eastern
Orthodox Church</B>. Two priests were appointed negotiators at a meeting of the ROC's Holy
Synod last month. The Constantinople-based Eastern Church said it would cooperate in
discussions, news reports said. The rift developed when Orthodox churches in Estonia were
removed from the Russian church's jurisdiction (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/031896.html">NIRR 3/18</A>).

<B>Many of the 39,024 ministers at the Promise Keepers Clergy Conference for Men in Atlanta
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/022096.html">NIRR 2/20</A>) last month are describing it as a spiritual high-water mark for themselves and
possibly a turning point for the church</B>. Diverse in color, ethnicity, and denominational
background, they seemed at the end united in commitment to personal repentance and
renewal, and to reconciliation and revival in the church. Their vows are summarized in the
Atlanta Covenant, a document being distributed by the Promise Keepers ministry.
<BR><B>..."I've seen nothing like it in 35 years of ministry," said Robert Short, 53, pastor of First
Alliance Church, Fort Myers, Fla</B>. A veteran religion reporter said the three-day conference
was one of the most significant events he's witnessed in 30 years of covering the church
scene. To pastor Charles Dixon, 49, of Western Heights Baptist Church in Waco, Texas, who
teaches a seminary extension course on church growth, the conference was "a defining
development in the life of the church." But pastors must work to spread the fire to their
congregations at home, or the convention "will have been just another waste of time and
resources," Short cautioned.
<BR><B>..."We are on the verge of the greatest spiritual revolution in the history of the church, and
you are called to be a part of it," Wellington Boone told the gathering</B>. Boone is an
African-American pastor who heads an urban ministry that emphasizes prayer and unity. "God
couldn't find a pastor to bring this group together; He had to use a football coach," he said,
referring to Promise Keepers founder Bill McCartney, former University of Colorado coach.
"Well, I have no intention of letting a college football coach be more serious about the things
of God than I am," Boone declared. The audience cheered and applauded.
<BR><B>...The pastors carry lingering images from the Georgia Dome indoor stadium: Men embracing
as they prayed for each other at the conclusion of John Maxwell's talk on accountability</B>. "We
don't need one more guy to fall off the edge," Maxwell said. Preachers on their knees after
Chuck Swindoll's sermon on brokenness and repentance, a few face-down on the floor,
weeping and praying. Steve Green singing Let the Walls Come Down, with everyone
standing, their hands held aloft and locked with their neighbors' hands. Sustained cheers and
applause for Max Lucado's wall-razing treatise on biblical unity. "Unity matters to God. It is
a priority item for Him and should be for us," he said. Maxwell, a former Wesleyan pastor in
suburban San Diego, heads Injoy, a ministry to ministers. Swindoll, a former Evangelical Free
Church pastor in Fullerton, Calif., is president of Dallas Seminary. Lucado is a San Antonio,
Texas, author and pastor in the traditionally separatist non-instrumental Church of Christ.  
<BR><B>...In a pivotal session on race, Raleigh Washington and Glen Kehrein, black and white
Chicago ministers, respectively, and co-authors of a book on reconciliation, discussed their
experiences at length</B>. After they finished, Tony Evans, the black pastor of interracial Oak
Cliff Bible Fellowship in Dallas, stepped to the podium and warned of making theology
subservient to sociology: "If you can't [identify] the cause of racism, you can't get at the
solution." The pulpits of America have failed to deal with the problem, he said. Racism, he
declared, "is a sin," and unrepentant racists in the church -- whether black or white -- need to
be disciplined just like any other unrepentant sinners. He received a standing ovation.  
<BR><B>...Next came California Foursquare pastor Jack Hayford, who has been working for racial
reconciliation in Los Angeles</B>. He said it had taken him three decades to discover
"unperceived racism." Addressing blacks, he requested forgiveness for a host of shortcomings,
from insensitivity to their pain to wrong attitudes. He added, "I don't know well how to be
different, but I ask for your help and understanding as I grow." Everyone stood and applauded
for a long time. Suddenly it was quiet. Then from the rear middle deck a voice cried out, "I
forgive you, my brother." Another from the left lower deck shouted, "Me, too." Others all
over the stadium echoed the words.
<BR><B>...Blacks and whites hugged each other and prayed together throughout the Georgia Dome
after worship leader Joseph Garlington, pastor of 1,700-member Covenant Church, a
multiracial Pittsburgh congregation, extended forgiveness on behalf of the assembled blacks</B>.
He called on his brethren to repent for bitterness, strife, separatism, and the like, and to
commit themselves to unity with other believers. Garlington asked all the black ministers to
stand as he prayed for them. As he did, whites sitting nearby quietly went to the black
ministers' sides and laid hands on their shoulders or heads. 
<BR><B>...There were more confessions, hugs, and tears as Hispanic, Asian, and Native American
representatives joined the others</B>. Finally McCartney took over. He urged the ministers to root
out racism and stand for justice. Amid a long standing ovation, he summoned all blacks to
come to the front. "We want to honor you," he said. From all over the stadium they streamed,
perhaps 1,800 altogether. On the main floor, whites left their seats and formed aisles through
which the blacks passed. All along the route, there were embraces, handshakes, and words of
appreciation and encouragement. Whites throughout the stadium continued their applause and
chanted, "We love you, we love you." The demonstration ended in prayer. "Let us be the
generation of love and reconciliation," McCartney urged.
<BR><B>...The coach had hoped that far more black pastors would attend</B>. Many were offered
scholarships. But in preparatory meetings across the country, he found many blacks to be
reluctant to join movements organized and controlled by whites. Although blacks hold
prominent offices and roles in PK, it still is a predominantly white group trying to recruit
black churches and churchmen, said Henry Lyons, president of the 8.5-million-member
National Baptist Convention U.S.A. "I see it as an attempt to put us back on the plantation,"
he was quoted as saying in USA Today on the opening day of the conference. Lyons has
launched a men's movement in black churches called Trusted Partners; some of its goals are
similar to those of Promise Keepers. PK officials did not comment on Lyons' quote, but held
out hope that the seeds planted in Atlanta eventually will result in racial harmony and
cooperation throughout the church.                                              
<BR><B>...Of equal concern to McCartney are denominational differences that impede unity</B>. "I am not
saying that we should dismantle our denominations and ignore our distinctives, but that we
should concentrate on the 95% where we agree," he told reporters. "If we do that, we'll see
positive change." At the final session, he invited everyone who could partake in communion
without violating his conscience to do so as a sign of unity in Christ. He noted the presence
of Catholic priests and others in the assembly with views that might bar them from taking
part. Hardly anyone left the building.
<BR><B>...Within the first two weeks back home, pastors were reporting they already had begun to
meet regularly with new prayer partners</B>. For example, John Hauck, 36, pastor of a United
Methodist church in Bradley, Ill., said he is meeting with a nearby Episcopal priest who
became his prayer partner while they were in Atlanta. In Waco, Texas, a post-Atlanta
"after-glow" report to 350 people, a number of them ministers, resulted in an Atlanta-like
session of racial reconciliation. At least one black pastor said he will join a weekly prayer
gathering of several of his white brethren. Others spoke of beginning cooperative,
community-wide outreaches in the days ahead. "We need repentance, revival, and
reconciliation," said Waco pastor Charles Dixon. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>A "Third Wave" church movement has begun in China</B>. Some 4,200 independent churches
with 1.2 million believers are opening across the country with the approval of local
government officials, according to Asian Outreach, a Hong Kong-based ministry. The
churches are registered as People's Organizations and are not part of the government-run
Three Self Patriotic Movement or the persecuted house-church movement. "We don't fight the
Three Self...we only preach Jesus and serve the local community," one pastor told Asian
Outreach's David Wang. City officials were among the thousands gathered to dedicate the
pastor's new church in central China last month. 
<BR><B>...Third Wave churches are not political and don't receive money or materials from outside
the country, Wang said</B>. The recently opened church was financed by Chinese Christians. By
avoiding conflicts between the Three Self and house churches, the ministers can develop
relationships with local Communist Party officials. The officials used to believe "one more
Christian, one less Chinese," but Third Wave pastors are trying to change that impression.
"Their message is `one more Christian, one better Chinese,'" Wang said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>A missionary's prayer for rain in Thailand saved a village's harvest and convinced its people

province, 134 families became Christians when native missionary Lun Poobuanak and his
church prayed for rain. Poobuanak was holding services with his small congregation when the
village leaders interrupted. "If you ask your God to give us rain this month, all households in
our clan will worship your God and become Christians," said the leader. Skeptical at first,
Poobuanak told them they could not "play games with the living God." But the leader
repeated his vow and said, "If we do not, your God can send judgment on us." The Christians
immediately began to fast and pray.
<BR><B>...On the fourth day a storm came that filled the rice fields and saved their crops</B>. The rain
was so intense that "the villagers admitted that Jesus is the true and living God," Poobuanak
said. All the households in the village were converted and word has spread to many of the
surrounding districts. "This is a living testimony that helps us win souls easily in this area,"
Poobuanak said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>"Structures of sin" account for trillions of dollars of the world's money consumption, the
Global Evangelization Movement, a Richmond, Va.-based research group, reported</B>. Financial

gambling ($700 billion), organized crime ($600 billion), drug trafficking ($150 billion),
shoplifting ($90 billion), and pornography ($20 billion) account for the rest. A little more than
10% of the money consumed by such endeavors could provide food, shelter, and education
for the world's poor, according to GEM.
<BR><B>...The global church has the money to evangelize the world many times over, GEM said</B>.
Personal income of church members worldwide amounted to $11.1 trillion, of which $193

other groups received $194 billion last year. About 9.6 billion was lost to ecclesiastical crime,

<BR><B>...Blacks who are not enthusiastic about reconciliation with whites generally have four
reasons, Skinner said in The Reconciler magazine</B>. First, despite much talk, whites don't
understand blacks very well, she said. Second, reconciliation reminds blacks of the failed
integration movement of the 1960s, when blacks were asked to give up their heritage while
whites "didn't give up anything," she said. Third, blacks fear losing control of their churches.
Fourth, they detect racist attitudes among whites in the church. Yet blacks should not turn
these sentiments into "an obstacle course for whites," Skinner said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>Activists are refining the language of a religious freedom amendment</B>. Reps. Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.), a Catholic, and Ernest Istook (R-Okla.), a Mormon, both proposed amendments
seeking to clarify the First Amendment. Hyde's resolution prohibits laws that discriminate "on
account of religious expression, belief, or identity." It says the First Amendment's prohibition
of an establishment of religion should not be construed to require such discrimination (NIRR
10/30/95). Istook's bill would prohibit laws that disallow "acknowledgments of the religious
heritage, beliefs, or traditions of the people, or prohibit student-sponsored prayer in schools." 
<BR><B>...But a debate over which proposal is better has kept both amendments bottled up</B>. Advocates
of Hyde's version say Istook's allows too much government involvement in religion, while
Istook criticizes Hyde's version for not directly addressing prayer in public schools. A
number of religious groups, including the Southern Baptist Christian Life Commission, the
Christian Legal Society's Center for Law and Religious Freedom, and the National
Association of Evangelicals, helped draft the original Hyde proposal and are refining its

heresy in May. He ordained a practicing homosexual in 1990 (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/122595.html">NIRR 12/25/95</A>).
<P>
<B>Newark, N.J., Episcopal Bishop John Spong, 64, said he will retire as soon as a successor is
elected (NIRR 2/5/96)</B>. But Spong, a longtime thorn in the side of conservatives, promised to
stay in office until age 72 if "heresy hunters" continue to "harass me or this diocese." 
<P>
<B>Paul Cedar will not seek another term as president of the Evangelical Free Church of
America, a position he has held for six years</B>. Cedar has split his time between administrating
the EFCA and Mission America, an interdenominational evangelistic movement (NIRR
12/25/95). In October, he will begin full-time as Mission America's chairman and chief
executive.
<P>
<B>Hillary Rodham Clinton hosted Muslim families at a reception in the Old Executive Office
Building to celebrate the end of their holy month of Ramadan</B>. The Feb. 20 reception was the

said.
<P>
<B>Charlton Heston's appearance in a Bud Light beer commercial led a Florence, Ala., Christian
school to cancel his March 22 speech for the institution's fund-raiser</B>. "Part of our purpose for
being is to teach against the evils of drinking," said David Vester, president of Mars Hill
Bible School. "We had some complaints." Heston's screen roles include Moses.

<B>Last Days Ministries is closing (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29/95</A>)</B>. The Lindale, Texas, nonprofit, published Last
Days Magazine, which called Christians to radical commitment. LDM also had trained
missionaries and was involved in the pro-life movement. The late Christian singer Keith
Green and his wife, Melody, founded LDM in 1977. She and her second husband, Andrew
Sievright, continued LDM. A ministry should "only continue to exist for the season God
appointed for it," Melody said of LDM, which began as an outgrowth of the Jesus Movement.
<P>
<B>Evangelism Explosion International has set up its ministry in all 211 of the world's nations,
the group said</B>. Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based EE trains pastors, evangelists, missionaries, church
leaders, and lay people for evangelism.
<P>
<B>Most of the 9.4 million Mormons in the world now live outside of the United States, the
church said</B>. The most growth has occurred in Latin America, where there are more than 3
million Mormons. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has 50,000 missionaries, it
said.
<P>
<B>A Million Woman March is planned for Los Angeles June 14-16</B>. The rally is to focus on
strengthening the bonds of families. Workshops and seminars are planned on crime, teen
pregnancy, and other issues that families face. The highlight will be a June 15 march down
Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to Exposition Park in South Los Angeles. The Congress of
Racial Equality and the Freedom Journal, a black publication in Los Angeles, are co-sponsors.
<P>
<B>The Tennessee Senate voted overwhelmingly to urge its citizens to observe the Ten
Commandments and post them in homes, schools, businesses, and places of worship from
May 5-17</B>. "It is time we get back to the basics of morality," said the resolution's co-sponsor,
Ben Atchley (R-Knoxville). The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that displaying the
Commandments in a school, except as part of a course, violates the Constitution.
<P>
<B>Colorado can keep a monument engraved with the Ten Commandments in a public park near
the Capitol in Denver, the U.S</B>. Supreme Court ruled. The court turned away arguments by
the Freedom From Religion Foundation that such a display is unconstitutional. The
3-foot-by-4-foot granite monument was placed in Lincoln Park in the 1950s.
<P>
<B>The newly published reference book Practical Encyclopedia of Evangelism and Church
Growth (Regal Books) standardizes definitions of terms, ideas, and principles</B>. Elmer Towns,
dean of the School of Religion at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., is general editor and
author of most articles. 
<P>
<B>The Archdiocese of Milwaukee is not liable for the alleged sexual abuse of a girl by one of
its priests 30 years ago, the U.S</B>. Supreme Court said. The ruling upheld a Wisconsin
Supreme Court decision involving the issue of repressed memory. The Wisconsin Supreme
Court ruled that the three year statute of limitations barred Judith Pritzlaff's claim. Pritzlaff
contends she remembered the abuse shortly before the 1992 lawsuit.
<P>
<B>A Long Island, N.Y., landlord can not evict an abortion clinic from his building only because
of protests by those opposed to abortion, the New York Appellate Division court ruled</B>. The
decision overturned a ruling allowing Ronald Morey to end the lease of Long Island
Gynecological Services at his Garden City building (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/111395.html">NIRR 11/13/95</A>). 
<P>
<B>Forty-five million abortions, about one for every three live births, are performed around the
world every year, the United Nations reported</B>. About 38% of the world's population lives in
countries where abortion is available on demand. 
<P>
<B>Reported acts of anti-Semitism in the United States declined 11% in 1995, the biggest drop in
a decade, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith said</B>. 
<P>
<B>The Amish have been easy prey in 10-15 robberies in Nappanee, Ind., since January</B>. Pacifist,
black-clad Amish men on bicycles have been robbed and beaten with metal pipes and tire
irons on their way home from work in the town, which is 45 miles southeast of South Bend.
Most attacks occurred on Thursdays or Fridays, paydays at the plants where many Amish
work, news reports said. Amish men carry cash and don't use credit cards or checkbooks.
<P>
<B>Colorado won't pay for chaplains in its prisons</B>. The House State Affairs Committee said that
the $300,000 cost was too high (NIRR 5/17/93). Rep. Phil Pankey (R-Littleton) asked why
churches couldn't pay for the chaplains. Lucia Guzman, head of the Colorado Council of
Churches, backed a bill to fund the chaplains and said the state and church "should be in
greater partnership."
<P>
<B>A man admitted stealing 18 Torahs, holy scrolls of scripture, from New York City
synagogues</B>. Richard Stevens was caught trying to break into a room at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel, police said. He confessed to a string of burglaries since 1992 at synagogues and other
locations and to the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Torahs, art, and silver
objects, news reports said. There is a market in the United States and abroad for second-hand
scrolls, which are valued at as much as $15,000 each. None of the Torahs has been recovered.
<P>
<B>Some 250 evangelism leaders across the country formed an informal group called The
Network</B>. They use a monthly newsletter to share ideas. About 75% of the members are
Southern Baptists, but others also have joined. For information, call the group's director, Bob
Bailey of the Southeastern Indiana Baptist Association, at (812) 282-8777.
<P>
<B>The Catholic Church must pay $600,000 in punitive damages to a man molested by a priest in
1981</B>. It is reportedly only the third time the Church has been ordered to pay such damages,
imposed to punish offenders and deter others from similar conduct. A Hennepin County,
Minn., jury on Feb. 13 found the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis guilty of "willful
indifference to the rights and safety" of Dale Scheffler, 28. He had been abused by Robert
Kapoun, who had been kept in the ministry after acknowledging previous wrongdoing. The
jury also awarded $550,000 in compensatory damages to Scheffler.

<B>Zimbabwe: Catholic bishops condemned persecution of homosexuals</B>. They said
homosexuality is a disorder, but the government should not harass or torture homosexuals.
"We want to eliminate the disease...we do not want to eliminate those who suffer from it,"
they said. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, a Catholic, has called homosexuals perverts
and beasts and said they have no rights in the country (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/091395.html">NIRR 9/13/95</A>).

Estonian Church's request. In response, the Russian Orthodox Church announced it was
suspending relations with the Istanbul-based Eastern Church, which is the head of all
Orthodox churches.

<P>
Nearly 4,000 of the world's evangelical leaders have pledged to aggressively take on new
challenges and opportunities to evangelize mankind. The leaders, meeting May 17-25 in
Seoul, South Korea, at the Global Consultation On World Evangelism '95, affirmed the
ambitious goal of establishing a church-planting movement among every people group in the
world by the turn of the century (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29</A>).  
<BR>...The massive scope of the task energized and unified delegates. "We came together around a
vision created in us by the command of Christ to make disciples of all nations," said Robert
Coleman of Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, reading from the conference declaration.
"This is the time for which we were born." As he read the declaration, Coleman began to
tremble with emotion, and the entire gathering "went wild" in a spontaneous response to the
contents, AD 2000 & Beyond Movement International Director Luis Bush told NIRR. 
<BR>...Brokenness, repentance, and reconciliation characterized the conference, Bush said. In the
plenary and working sessions, and in the prayer rooms, delegates from the 186 countries and
numerous denominations repented of sins and reconciled profound differences. Arab and
Jewish Christians repented of the hatred between their peoples, and embraced each other.
Delegates from Turkey and Armenia did the same. Japanese evangelist Paul Ariga knelt on
stage and asked forgiveness for World War II crimes against other Southeast Asians. Russian
Orthodox Bishop Christopher Tcamalaidze of Tbilisi, Georgia, asked forgiveness for his
church's persecution of evangelicals. "It was a miracle," said Thomas Wang, AD 2000's
international chairman of the board. "When things like that happen, you know it is a work of
the Holy Spirit." 
<BR>...Denominational leaders confessed their failure to work together and pledged more
cooperation in reaching GCOWE '95's goal. Leaders from the Southern Baptist Convention's
Foreign Missions Board pledged to share its research on 10,500 unreached people groups.
"We realized we can not do it by ourselves," Avery Willis of the board told NIRR. Other
leaders confessed to acting unilaterally, and promised to work together. 
<BR>...During the conference's 17 track sessions, leaders shared ideas for evangelizing people
groups, nations, regions, and continents. The priority is to plant at least one church for each
of the 2,300 unreached people groups in the 10/40 Window, Bush said. Leaders formed a
five-year evangelization schedule for churches and ministries, Wang said. Track sessions
became times for exchanging information and "rejoicing in what others were doing," said
Robert Bakke of the Evangelical Free Church of America. So much networking took place
that "it made the stock market look tame," Baptist Press said. NIRR 6/12/95

Six million Christians marched, sang, praised God, and prayed in the streets of 2,190 cities in
75 nations during the annual March for Jesus (NIRR 6/27/94). In Sao Paulo, Brazil, an
estimated 1.5 million people marched in April. In Guatemala, the number was 80,000, double
that of last year, organizers said. Thirty thousand marched in Papau New Guinea. In Burundi,
members of the opposing Hutu and Tutsi tribes marched side-by-side carrying banners
reading, "No Divisions in Jesus." In Canada, 90 marches drew 115,000 people. In Japan,
where people are "in the midst of darkness and insecurity" because of cultic terrorist attacks,
the march revealed "the differences between Christians, who live by the love of Christ," and
cultists, the coordinator said. 
<BR>...About 1 million believers marched in the streets of 600 U.S. cities. Most U.S. celebrations
took place May 27, but some were held on other days due to Memorial Day weekend. In
Atlanta, 87 people received Christ as more than 20,000 people marched. In Nashville, 40,000
marchers were led by a drum corps, community choir, 100 dancers, and hundreds of flags and
banners. Columbus, Ohio, had 20,000 marchers; Toledo, Ohio, 17,000; and Spokane, Wash.,
15,000. In Hilo, Hawaii, people came out of bars and wept as marchers passed, organizers
said. About 9,000 people marched in Oklahoma City, and a pastor whose church was across
the street from the site of the bombing spoke of "how the tragedy was being turned to glory
by the Lord." In Sioux Falls, S.D., a Satanist who came to Christ during the march two years
ago held a banner and led this year's march. In Ceres, Calif., young children led the march;
they wore white robes and waved palm branches. "Jesus was the glue that bound us together,"
said pastor David Nanod, march organizer in Kaukanakai, Hawaii. Marches are planned for
each year through the year 2000. NIRR 6/12/95

A May 26-27 Promise Keepers rally at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., drew 50,440 men
for 13  hours of spirited preaching, singing, and praying. Some 4,000 responded to evangelist
Luis Palau's altar call. Speakers challenged and inspired the crowd, and a men's band led the
mix of gospel, traditional, and salsa music. Men prayed together in clusters, and many wiped
tears from their eyes. At one point, thousands of pastors assembled in front of the stage and
up the aisles. Some wept as the crowd pronounced a blessing over them and let loose with a
thunderous, sustained ovation to encourage them. 
<BR>...Bill McCartney confessed to the crowd that for many years he had selfishly neglected the
needs of his wife, Lyndi, while obsessed with coaching football at the University of Colorado
and then with founding and running Promise Keepers. McCartney said he has repented,
received his wife's forgiveness, and dedicated himself to serving others. 
<BR>...Promise Keepers continues to pack stadiums (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/051595.html">NIRR 5/15</A>). The seven-point message at each
conference this summer is that "men of integrity" honor Jesus Christ; have close male friends;
practice spiritual, moral, and sexual purity; are faithful to wife and children; support the
church; defy racial and denominational barriers; and encourage the world to do the same.  
<BR>...PK attendance has grown from 4,200 men in 1991 to an expected 700,000 at 13 gatherings
this year. The staff and budget have doubled every six months for the last four years to $22
million yearly with 175 national staffers, seven state offices, and 11,000 local volunteers or
"point men," organizers said.  PK plans a rally of 1 million men on the Mall in Washington,

Contemporary outreach events attracted 5,000 parents, youth, business and community
leaders, and singles during an April weekend in Hagerstown, Md. The interdenominational
effort among local churches, radio station WCRH, and New Jersey author, speaker, and radio
host Ron Hutchcraft resulted in 589 people coming to Christ. Events included contemporary
Christian music concerts, a workshop on practical parenting, and a seminar on how business
and community leaders can live peacefully in a stressful world. Hutchcraft spoke and gave
invitations at all the events. 
<BR>...Young people who accepted Christ during the weekend later watched a video containing
practical information about the Christian life. Adults who made commitments to Christ were

Revival services in Melbourne, Fla., still are going strong (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/040395.html">NIRR 4/3</A>). Services started Jan. 1.
Since early April, 15,000 people have attended meetings held six days a week at the
1,000-seat Tabernacle Church, founded by the late Jamie Buckingham. Since then, about 200
people have become Christians as a result of the services, according to local church leader
Fred Grewe. Various pastors and worship leaders take turns leading the services, which
include physical healings and spontaneous "holy laughter." 
<BR>..."Everybody is exhausted, but God is manifesting His presence every night -- so we are
reluctant to stop," Grewe told NIRR. Participants are taking their renewed spiritual energy
back to their churches, observers said.  
<BR>..."A deep fraternity has grown in our community," Grewe said. Pastors from diverse
denominations join in worship, share testimonies, and pray for renewal at one another's
churches. Some 40-80 pastors attend a weekly prayer meeting. Congregants enjoy "seeing all
the pastors come together more than they enjoy the manifestations of the Holy Spirit," Grewe
said. NIRR 6/12/95

"A major step in bringing unity" to Northern Ireland is how an evangelical leader described
the May 16-21 Luis Palau crusade in Londonderry (NIRR 11/4/94). Howard Lewis of the
Evangelical Alliance in Northern Ireland said the crusade brought together churches "we
never dreamt would work together" and delivered an element of healing to a community
fraught with religious and political discord. Catholics and Protestants worshiped together in a
3,000-seat tent-pavilion on the bank of the Foyle River, which divides Protestant and Catholic
communities. Some 18,000 people attended the five-day crusade, which included a youth rally
and a service for senior citizens, Palau's evangelistic association said. About 450 people
prayed to become Christians during the crusade. NIRR 6/12/95

Christians in Russia, long prevented under communism from using the media, are learning to
use radio as a ministry. Some 75 ministers and church planters studied radio production
methods and other skills in three seminars conducted by Trans World Radio, Russia
Ministries Executive Director Peter Deyneka told NIRR. Deyneka's ministry recruits students
and coordinates the sessions. Under communism, "some did not even know how to operate a
tape recorder," Deyneka said. Yet they recognized its usefulness for spreading the gospel.
"Pastors came to us and said, `How can we use radio?'" 
<BR>...About a dozen new programs, mostly containing preaching, are on the air as a result,
Deyneka said. This summer the two ministries are opening a media center in Moscow,
complete with recording facilities and a library of radio broadcasts. Another goal is to form
an association of religious broadcasters to exchange ideas, socialize, and be represented as a
unified group. NIRR 6/12/95

House Speaker Newt Gingrich's plan to use churches and other charities to compensate for
budget cuts to social services will put too large a strain on their resources, ministry
representatives say. To make up for the $60 billion in cuts proposed in the House-approved
Personal Responsibility Act alone, each of America's 350,000 churches would have to raise
an additional $190,000 over the next five years, Bread for the World said. But the typical
congregation has fewer than 100 members and the $60 billion figure represents nearly the
total giving for all religious groups and causes in a single year, according to various studies.
Gingrich has suggested that every church and synagogue in the country can adopt a homeless
person for six months. 
<BR>...Charities can meet only a fraction of the needs, their leaders say. Dismantling America's
welfare system and relying solely on charities and volunteers would cause "a disaster of a
large magnitude," Stephen Burger, executive director of the International Union of Gospel
Missions, told NIRR. For example, the budget at Seattle's Union Gospel Mission already is
stretched to its limits, Herb Pfiffner, executive director of the mission, told The New York
Times. Union receives no public funds, and Pfiffner is reluctant to do so because the mission
might be forced to abandon its religious message, he said. But cuts in government services
will lead to more competition for private money and great needs among the poor, he said.     
<BR>...Christian groups helping the poor have more long-term success than the government
because the gospel "changes lives," Pfiffner said. The nation's 250 rescue missions served
75,000 meals a day, provided 24,800 beds per night, and gave 13,700,000 articles of clothing
last year. NIRR 6/12/95

Fifty churches are helping rebuild the poorest neighborhood in New York City's Harlem
section. They formed a development corporation called Harlem Congregation for Community
Improvement, an organizer told NIRR. Since 1989, the group has overseen construction of
more than 1,500 housing units in the area's Bradhurst section. The group has spent close to
$200 million on the construction. Most of the money comes from foundation grants and the
city. 
<BR>...The average yearly income per family in Bradhurst is $6,019, according to an analysis of
census data by the Program for Applied Research at Queens College. One in four households
consists of married couples, one in three adults is employed or seeking work, and three of
four people live below the poverty level, the study showed. By comparison, the average
yearly family income in the richest community in New York, bounded by 5th and Park
Avenues and East 86th and 91st Streets on Manhattan's Upper East Side, is $301,209 -- or 50
times that in Bradhurst. NIRR 6/12/95

Ministry leaders, accountants, and lawyers are making headway in charting an honorable way
out of the mess created by The Foundation for New Era Philanthropy bankruptcy, according
to Paul Nelson, president of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability. Hundreds
of evangelical organizations, colleges, and churches stand to lose tens of millions of dollars in
the New Era pyramid scheme (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29</A>). About $200 million is owed to creditors against
about $30 million in assets, according to court records. 
<BR>...More than 100 groups, including some nonreligious charities, have joined the ECFA-created
United Response to New Era plan, Nelson said. The plan's intent is for affected groups to
conform voluntarily to bankruptcy provisions governing fraud cases, and avert the costs and
spectacle of litigation, he said. Nelson and other United Response leaders have met with the
bankruptcy trustee to fine-tune the unprecedented plan. The trustee reportedly is pushing all
creditors to become part of United Response. Creditors will meet formally for the first time
June 26 in Philadelphia. 
<BR>...A proposed agreement has been discussed with the bankruptcy trustee and other groups.
Charities that got more money from New Era "matching grants" than they lost in last month's
collapse would return the balance voluntarily, Nelson said. Charities that received less than
they had on deposit will be asked to give up their right to sue in exchange for the prospect of
receiving some of the money returned by other charities. A number of ministries have said
they will return funds, but it is not known how much money will be added to the assets,
Nelson said. The trustee would not initiate any litigation under the plan.  
<BR>..."It is likely that those in a negative cash position will remain so" once the proposal has
been accepted and the assets distributed, Nelson warned in a letter to United Response
members. The group will coordinate an effort for the evangelical community to help all
groups that may be harmed financially, he said. Some small ministries have been left in dire
straits by New Era's collapse, he told NIRR. 
<BR>...Almost 98% of major donors have less respect for the managerial skills of senior nonprofit
managers as a result of the New Era debacle, according to a survey by The Chronicle of
Philanthropy. And 74% said they planned to take a closer look at the groups they already
support. To avoid alienation, organizations must explain to their constituents what happened
and how, Nelson said. Charities that are candid with their donors will be more likely to
receive forgiveness and continued support, he added. NIRR 6/12/95

Croats, Serbs, and former Muslims worship together at the Church of the Good News in
Mostar, Bosnia, according to Agape, a relief organization based in Osijek, Croatia (NIRR
1/24/94). Some 200 people attend regular worship at the church, which was founded in 1985
and destroyed by artillery several years ago. "The building was gone and only a few people
left," Agape founder Peter Kuzmic told NIRR. But a couple from Agape took over the church
last year and have seen it grow as it assists those in need. Members are committed to doing
relief work and evangelism across Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kuzmic said.  
<BR>...Founded in 1991 to assist displaced Croats, Agape's ministry has spread throughout the
former Yugoslavia as the war creates more refugees. The ministry is "two-handed," Kuzmic
said: "With one hand we give them daily bread, and with the other hand we give them eternal
bread." In the last two years, Agape has fed 700,000 people, including 3,500 refugee families.
An additional 2,000 families receive clothing twice a month. The ministry also distributed
700,000 Scripture portions, but is careful to practice low-key evangelism. "We are dealing
with horrible pain. We have to be sensitive so as not to manipulate the Muslims who are
victims here," Kuzmic said. NIRR 6/12/95

Pope John Paul II said he is willing to seek agreement with other denominations on the future
role of the papacy. In his 115-page encyclical appealing for Christian unity last month (NIRR
5/15), he said that in the early church the papacy acted as a "moderator" to resolve
disagreements and preserve unity. The 75-year-old pontiff said he feels a "particular" personal
responsibility to make unity happen. He appealed to leaders and theologians of other
denominations to enter into "patient" dialogue with him. However, the pope made it clear he
would not accept a symbolic papacy lacking authority to issue infallible declarations regarding
the faith. And he insisted that the papacy must be based in Rome because Peter died there.
Catholics consider Peter the first pope. 
<BR>...Prominent Catholic theologian Hans Kung denounced the encyclical and said the pope
himself is the greatest obstacle to unity. The Swiss-born Kung, who teaches at the German
University of Tubingen, berated the pontiff for not relinquishing power. Instead, John Paul
wants unity totally on Roman terms, Kung said. The encyclical should have taken initiatives
such as rescinding the excommunication of Martin Luther and other Reformation leaders, and
recognizing the validity of Protestant clergy and religious services, he said. NIRR 6/12/95

Members of Assemblies of God and Southern Baptist churches give the most per capita,
according to a survey commissioned by the Lilly Endowment. The survey, described as the
most far-reaching of its kind, studied 625 congregations, 125 in each of five major church
bodies, across the nine census regions of the country. The other three churches surveyed: the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (USA), and the Catholic
Church. 
<BR>...Church size is not a big factor in giving, the study found. Also, feelings of alienation from
denominational leadership or from denominational moral teachings are statistically
insignificant. The study found that people in conservative Protestant churches give more:
People who tithe and those who plan their giving with pledges or other commitments give
more than others. Giving varies by age and marital status. Those between 45 and 65 and
those who are married and whose spouses attend the same church give the most.

American Muslim Council, and the Church of Scientology.

unconstitutional (NIRR 4/3/95), the coalition argued in a brief filed with the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Bunton said RFRA intruded on the power of the
courts. The coalition said Congress passed the act to enforce a constitutional right, not to
usurp judicial power. 
<BR>...The case involves a Catholic church in Boerne, Texas, that wanted to demolish part of its

accommodate religious practices in the workplace unless doing so imposes "undue hardship."

Cuba abruptly changed its policy toward house churches. The government closed at least 81
house churches in the last month and jailed a pastor, sources reported. Authorities sentenced
Orson Vila, an Assemblies of God pastor and presbyter of the AG churches in the Camaguey
area, to 18 months in prison after he refused to close his house church. Vila told local
authorities that they could close the church, but that he could not "turn his back on the flock
and tell the people not to come back," Barbara Cusack, a Cuban-American who spoke with
Vila's wife, told NIRR. More than 1,000 Christians sang and praised God outside the
courthouse during Vila's trial May 24, she said.  
<BR>...Vila "is like a Billy Graham," Cusack said. He attracts many people and "God uses him
mightily," she said. He was arrested in 1981 for holding a revival that attracted thousands, an
AG official who knows Vila told NIRR. The pastor reportedly is in good condition. Local
leaders are appealing on his behalf. 
<BR>...House churches in other denominations are being closed as well, Cusack said. They are seen
as a threat because they are growing fast and refusing to join the government-controlled
Ecumenical Council, according to the AG official who requested anonymity. The AG has
formed more than 800 house churches since they were legalized in 1992, he said. As more
people become Christians, they spend Sundays worshiping rather than meeting with their local
militia groups or attending Communist Party meetings, Cusack said. "In a system that thrives
on control, this is out of control."

Elementary school children in Lubbock, Texas, can earn a pair of expensive athletic shoes for
being an outstanding student, athlete, or citizen. Messiah Presbyterian Church spearheads the
program "P.S. -- Go For It." The goal is to induce impoverished students to shun the activities
some resort to in order to afford the coveted shoes: selling drugs, stealing, or assaulting
others. Students win a certificate redeemable at local sporting goods stores for any pair of
shoes they want. The school's principal and staff assist the church in conducting the program.

Public school history textbooks have expanded and improved their treatment of religion in the
last decade, a report of the independent American Textbook Council said. But many social
studies and health-class texts show an indifference to traditional Judeo-Christian standards of
virtue. The materials substitute "new and shapeless moral credos" for those values, it said.

Augsburg Fortress, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America's publishing house, lost $3.8

Volunteers help poor families in Minneapolis complete high school, find jobs, or improve
parenting skills. Each family in Project Break-Through, run by The Salvation Army, meets
with a social worker and attends a monthly support group to develop new skills and learn
about resources. A family therapist, financial planner, and attorney also volunteer services.
When families graduate from the program, they can attend support groups and meet
periodically with social workers.

Kenya: Bandits opened fire on two Southern Baptist missionaries as they were driving home.
Gunmen sprayed the vehicle with automatic weapons fire, hitting Jo Scales in both legs and
her right hand. After the car stopped, the men robbed Louie Scales and fled. Mrs. Scales

Liberia: Rebels killed the in-laws of a World Relief worker. Brian Johnson (NIRR 12/12/94),
WR's associate in Liberia, was helping plan a reconciliation conference for church leaders
when a warring faction attacked a village. His wife's father, sister, and two cousins died.
Johnson and his wife, a native Liberian, prayed for reconciliation. "We don't have time to be

Morocco: A U.S. missionary couple from Oregon and their six children were arrested in
Casablanca. Newspaper accounts said Michael Lesbiejean and his family, clad in long white
robes, marched down the main boulevard with a large cross, handing out evangelistic tracts.
Angry crowds chased them, nearly creating a riot. After a day in police custody, the family
left for Spain, a U.S. embassy official told reporters. No charges were filed. Christian
preaching is forbidden by law.

Zimbabwe: About 500 Anglicans, including several clergy, held a public meeting in Harare to
protest the appointment of a white vicar-general as acting bishop. Protesters support black
Bishop Peter Hatendi, 68, who refused to leave office at the statutory retirement age of 65.
Speakers at the rally denounced Timothy Neill and black Archbishop Walter Makhulu of
Botswana, who appointed him. They vowed never again to allow whites to lead the Anglican
Church in black-ruled Zimbabwe.

Hong Kong: The Catholic Church will remain loyal to the pope and defend human rights after
the British colony reverts to China in 1997, Vicar-General Dominic Chan told reporters. Hong
Kong's Catholic Church operates independently from the Church in China, where Beijing
controls its policies through the state-sponsored China Patriotic Catholic Association and the
China Catholic Bishops College. Neither is under Vatican control. Hong Kong has nearly
260,000 Catholics, 5% of the population.

India: Radical Hindus are destroying Bibles and disrupting services, EP News Service said.
Members of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a militant Hindu organization, break up Christian
meetings and threaten to kill those in attendance.
<P>
India: Rights groups are investigating the crucifixion-like killing of an unidentified Christian
in the eastern state of Bihar. News accounts said 10 men seized the 22-year-old victim,
tattooed his face, broke his back and ribs, nailed his hands and feet to a cross, then forced
him to drink motor oil. It was the latest in a series of violent acts against Christians in
northern and eastern India over the past year. Two Catholic priests and a religious-order
brother were murdered last September not far from the site.

Japan: Evangelical churches are growing slowly but consistently. Overseas Missionary
Fellowship planted 21 churches in 15 years, many of which are pastored by nationals.
Average membership in larger churches grew from 60 to 100.

England: Two retired Church of England bishops, both married, can be ordained as Catholic
priests, the Vatican ruled. They can celebrate mass in their local parishes but they will not be
appointed as parish priests, officials said. Conrad Meyer, the former bishop of Dorchester, and
Richard Rutt, the former bishop of Leicester, were received into the Catholic Church last fall.

England: More than 11,000 people filled Wembley Arena in May to hear Korean pastor and
church planter David Yonggi Cho. He called the people to revival and led them in an
extended time of prayer for the country, Alpha magazine reported. They will become "a
catalyst to change Great Britain and the world," Cho said.

France: Eighty percent of the population has never opened a Bible, according to the Christian

Germany: The Evangelical Church in Germany appointed a pastor to counsel victims of
policies of the Stasi, the former East German secret police. The pastor, Curt Strauss, 46, said
the Stasi targeted many church members as enemies, sometimes with the cooperation of highranking church leaders. Stasi efforts included destroying family relationships and discrediting
reputations, he said.
<P>
Germany: Reinhard Bonnke is pursuing an ambitious plan to send gospel literature to every
household throughout German-speaking Europe. Millions of full-color, gold-embossed
magazines titled Plus to Minus will be mailed to every home in Germany, Austria, and parts
of Switzerland this September, a spokesman said. The magazine explains the gospel message
and provides a card to be filled out and returned to Bonnke's headquarters so respondents can
be matched with the nearest local church. Twenty-five million mailers were sent to England
last year and some 60,000 people have responded. About 1,400 churches in Germany will
serve in a follow-up capacity after the mailings.   
<P>
Norway: Police and churchgoers guarded churches against arsonists this month as Norwegians
celebrated the arrival of Christianity 1,000 years ago in the Viking land. More than 30
churches and meeting halls have been set on fire in the past three years. Police said the fires
appeared to be connected to the Christian anniversary. Satanic symbols were left behind at
most of the scenes.

Russia: Pravda, published by the Communist Party, was the only one of 18 national
newspapers to refuse to run an evangelistic advertisement concerning an Eastern Orthodox
festival, idea reported. Pravda, which means "truth," wouldn't run the ad because it mentioned
eternal life, a concept that is inconsistent with Communist ideology.

Switzerland: Popular Catholic Bishop Hansjoerg Vogel, 44, of Basel, resigned after disclosing
he got a woman pregnant. "I know that my failings will disappoint many believers," he said
in a statement. "They had expectations of me which I couldn't fulfill." New mistrust will arise
over whether priests can carry out their commitment to celibacy, he acknowledged. He said
he is convinced that a "fulfilled life" is possible in celibacy. A poll of Swiss Catholics found
that more than two-thirds think Vogel should be allowed to remain in his post. Also, 84%
favor ending celibacy, the survey showed.

<B>At least 400 of the 10,000 athletes competing in the Olympic Games are committed Christians eager to share their
faith, according to Edward Waxer of the International Sports Coalition, who initiates and monitors sports ministries
worldwide</B>. Three billion people will watch the Games on television, giving some of these Christian athletes the
spotlight to describe their motivations, including their faith, he said. "We're more than athletes; we're Christians,"
Leroy Burrell, gold medalist who set 10 world records in track, has told reporters. 
<BR><B>...An extensive Christian witness will be taking place in Atlanta, site of the Olympic Games July 19-Aug</B>. 4. Many
Christians plan to model the gospel through practical service to fans from 198 countries attending the games. They
also will look for opportunities to befriend nonbelievers.
<BR><B>...Fifteen hundred Atlanta churches from 28 denominations are cooperating on a variety of evangelistic initiatives</B>.
Olympic visitors will receive flyers inviting them to attend concerts at 23 churches, where 250 Christian music
groups from 40 countries will perform. Forty sports-evangelism clinics, led by Athletes in Action, Youth With A
Mission, and Lay Witnesses for Christ, will take place during the Olympics. 
<BR><B>...In what has been described as the world's biggest bed-and-breakfast, the athletes' family members are being offered
free housing and one meal a day during the Games</B>. Some 3,000 families are opening their homes to the visitors. The
effort, begun by Atlanta churches, is "an enormous gift" in a city where residents are getting top dollar to provide
food and lodging, Waxer said.
<BR><B>...The Salvation Army and area churches will distribute 6 million cups of free, cold water at Olympic parking sites,
and other Christians will erect tents along highways to hand out refreshments</B>. Christians also will staff free day
camps at hotels where parents can leave their children while attending Olympic events, and are building 33 homes
through Habitat for Humanity. Churches will hold joint, interracial worship services and initiate community
development projects, and many Christians will be praying for a peaceful and safe Olympics. 
<BR><B>...Youth With A Mission is sending 5,000 volunteers from 80 nations</B>. Some 4,000 will participate in drama,
evangelism, sports clinics, and community projects, while 1,000 act as security for the Olympic Village and sports
venues.
<BR><B>...Thirty-seven volunteer chaplains from six faith groups will oversee religious services for the athletes</B>. "Because
of their being in a place where they know they need strength, guidance, and wisdom, many athletes...seem to have
a reverence for the things of God," said chaplain Keith Johnson, a United Methodist pastor from Minneapolis who
has been a Minnesota Vikings chaplain.
<BR><B>...Nine Christian organizations have prepared resources for evangelism in homes and communities around the country</B>.
Videos, magazines, cassettes, and a pocket guide to the events are meant to help believers plan sports clinics or break
the conversational ice with nonbelievers as they watch the Games together. An estimated 10,000 U.S. churches are
using the resources, available through Grand Rapids, Mich.-based Discovery House Publishers. Churches in a dozen
other countries also are using the materials in outreaches. In India, 15,000 Christian churches are using vacation Bible
school material centered on the Olympics, and in Bangladesh, Christians are holding athletic events to raise money
for the poor. For a catalog, call (800) 653-8333. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>Some 418,000 men attended Promise Keepers' first seven rallies this year, the men's ministry said</B>. The largest of
those rallies have been in Detroit (70,000), Kansas City (67,000), and in the seventh city, Atlanta (65,000).
Thousands of men have made professions of faith in Christ or rededicated their lives to God during the conferences.
Last year, 720,000 men attended 13 events, the group said. Promise Keepers' 22 events this year will conclude with
an Oct. 25-26 rally in Dallas. 
<BR><B>...Speakers this year are lashing out against racism</B>. PK founder Bill McCartney told a crowd in Kansas City that the
"insidious sin" of racism is "so engraved in society that it is not going to go away until we wake up and realize the
tremendous pain we have caused men of color." The reconciling power of the gospel is "the only thing that can bring
healing," he said. But efforts cannot be "reconciliation hype," PK Vice President Raleigh Washington said at the
Detroit conference. "Just a surface effort would be counterproductive in the end." 
<BR><B>...Interdenominational Christian unity is another of this year's themes</B>. The Saturday evening session at the Kingdome
in Seattle ended with a time of fellowship as clergy in attendance distributed 13,000 loaves of bread to the rest of
the men in celebration of Christian unity. Men taking loving responsibility as fathers and husbands has been another
conference topic. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>A total of 10,110 people made public commitments to Christ during Say Yes Chicago, Luis Palau's two-month
crusade (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/052796.html">NIRR 5/27</A>)</B>. About 44% of those made first-time professions of faith, the Luis Palau Evangelistic
Association said. Cumulative attendance at the events, which included several rallies in stadiums as well as 55
smaller events, was 129,000. 
<BR><B>...The LPEA had hoped for a much larger attendance, a spokesman said</B>. The campaign failed to draw large crowds
to the stadiums. For example, during 16 nights of meetings, the large University of Chicago Pavilion usually was
less than half full. A Memorial Day finale drew a disappointing 6,000 at an outdoor amphitheater in Grant Park as
several hundred people stood on a wet, windy, and cold day. Smaller events, which focused on specific topics such
as family life, were better attended, the LPEA said. 
<BR><B>...Although crowds at some events were small, "the gospel was very powerful in Chicago," said John Warton, Jr.,
LPEA chief operating officer</B>. Response to the messages of the various evangelists was good during all events,
Warton said. For example, a homeless man named Sammy came forward early in the crusade and made a profession
of faith. Within a week, three of his sisters attended a crusade event and became Christians. They said they had seen
such an incredible, unexpected change in Sammy that they, too, had to find out what he had heard. The "truly
multiracial" nature of the crusade also was heartening, Warton said. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>A tribe of Ethiopian nomads was not surprised when a missionary arrived in their village</B>. "They had a vision that
a man would come with a book and that they should listen to him," Ves Sheely of the Worldwide Leadership Council
said. When the missionary, known as Bekele, first met with the tribe's chief, he was given permission to stay and
later given a plot of land to build a church. 
<BR><B>...Bekele said a dream led him to the tribe</B>. In the dream, he saw Jesus' blood flowing over Ethiopia to the Omo river
and heard a voice telling him to walk for 10 days until he could go no farther, he said. Bidding farewell to his
family, he began walking south. Ten days later, Bekele reached the confluence of two rivers and could not cross.
Looking up, he saw the huts of the Tarra people and asked their permission to stay.   
<BR><B>...But Bekele faced opposition from the tribe's witch doctors, who threatened his life and tried to drive him away,
said Sheely, who visited him at the Tarra village this month</B>. The witch doctors would not let Bekele have the land
to build his church, and instead began construction of a "high place" on the site for their own worship. But on the
day the temple was completed, wind and lightning destroyed it and the witch doctors left, he said. The church then
was built, but the burned-over plot remains "as a reminder of the powers of God," Sheely said. About 70 tribe
members became Christians in the past year.
<BR><B>...In Ethiopia, Sheely participated in a leadership-training seminar conducted by the Addis Ababa-based Evangelical
Theological College and the Fellowship of Evangelical Churches in Ethiopia</B>. The three-day seminar attracted 570
pastors and church leaders, he said. Representatives from the Catholic Church and Orthodox Church attended, as well
as members of FECE, whose denominations represent some 5 million believers in Ethiopia. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>More than 18,000 people attended a four-night crusade in Nilopolis, a neighborhood of Rio de Janiero, Brazil,
Sammy Tippit Ministries said</B>. Organizers were concerned about using the Beja Flor convention center because it
is in a high-crime area, but overflow crowds filled the center the last two nights as people stood for two and a half
hours to hear the evangelist share the gospel message. More than 1,000 people accepted Christ or rededicated their
lives to God during the crusade. 
<BR><B>...The crusade was part of a larger plan to reach Rio de Janiero</B>. The Home Mission Board of the Brazilian Baptist
Commission, the Carioca State Baptist Convention, the Fluminese Baptist Convention, and Sammy Tippit Ministries
are planning a series of evangelistic crusades to cover the entire city by the year 2000. Tippit, who has preached
semiannual crusades in Brazil since the 1980s, was asked by Brazilian church leaders to focus his efforts exclusively
on the city of 11.7 million people between now and the turn of the century. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>A church with a 22-year-old pastor is running a hospital for the soul in inner-city Los Angeles</B>. Matthew Barnett
leads the Los Angeles International Church in the former Queen of Angels Hospital off the Hollywood Freeway.
Some 120 ministries, embracing the homeless, unwed mothers, gang members, drug addicts, alcoholics, immigrants,
homosexuals, and a host of others, have fanned out through the building, a 400,000 square-foot structure with 1,600
rooms. In addition, trucks carry aid from the ministry to housing projects throughout the city. Hundreds of needy

<BR><B>...A church drama, which included a professional wrestling match, scored a body slam with neighborhood onlookers
and was typical of the church's innovative ministry</B>. The Empty Ring was performed in the church parking lot and
included music, 50 motorcycle riders in full regalia, numerous actors dressed as demons, and a powerful testimony
by former professional wrestling champion turned-evangelist Jake "The Snake" Roberts (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/103095.html">NIRR 10/30/95</A>). Roberts'
testimony of childhood abuse was "the most gut-wrenching thing I have ever heard," Barnett said. Ironically, all of
this occurred while police helicopters buzzed the neighborhood during a real-life drug bust. Some 1,000 people,
including many gang members, made professions of faith in Christ during the drama.  The drama is "pretty radical.
But the church needs to be radical sometimes." The play also has been produced at Phoenix First Assembly of God,
pastored by Barnett's father, Tommy. The Empty Ring actors hope to perform it around the country. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>The Southern Baptist Convention again picked a conservative president</B>. Tom Elliff, 52, pastor of the First Baptist
Church of Del City, Okla., was elected to a one-year term on a show of hands from more than 13,000 delegates in
the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. He succeeds Jim Henry, an Orlando, Fla., pastor who completed his
second term June 13. Although largely an honorary position, the president has influential appointive powers.
<BR><B>...It was the first uncontested SBC presidential election in decades</B>. Theological conservatives control the SBC, having
won the past several elections for the presidency, whose appointments have extended the conservative orthodoxy deep
into the convention's agencies, seminaries, and publishing organs. Moderates now have little impact on the
denomination, and largely stay away from the annual meetings, news reports said. In 1991, they formed the
Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, which is theologically distinct from the Southern Baptists in their view of the Bible,
but is not a separate denomination. 
<BR><B>...Delivering his final message as president, Henry warned the conservative movement that carried him to power not
to supplant its original goal of restoring biblical fidelity with a desire to consolidate power</B>. The delegates also: Urged
members to boycott Walt Disney Co.'s parks, movies, and products to protest the company's departure from
its "family values" image (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/121195.html">NIRR 12/11/95</A>); voted to proceed with the streamlining of the denomination, which
will reduce agencies from 19 to 12, saving $34 million to $41 million in five years; condemned same-sex
marriages, saying "whatever the stakes" Baptists will never obey any law legalizing such partnerships, "so help us
God;" passed a resolution deploring the church arsons in the South. The SBC also has raised $281,000 to help the
churches and has set up a fund to collect more contributions; call (615) 244-2355. SBC volunteer construction crews
are working to rebuild some of the African-American churches. They also urged more evangelization of Jews, a
move that Jewish leaders called offensive, and criticized President Clinton, a Southern Baptist, for vetoing the
partial-birth abortion bill and for saying he prayed about the veto. After Henry and 10 former SBC presidents
complained, Clinton wrote June 7 strongly defending his veto. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>The Florida Baptist Convention expelled two churches considered to have charismatic tendencies</B>. The convention's
board of missions ruled that the churches advocated speaking in tongues and being "slain in the Spirit," in which a
worshiper faints and falls on the floor. A decision about a third church was delayed pending further investigation.
The ousted churches are Trumpets of Truth International Church in Homosassa Springs,formerly the First Baptist
Church of Homosassa Springs, and Riverside Christian Church in Hernando, formerly the Riverside Baptist Church.
<BR><B>...The churches were ousted for holding views contrary to those cited in The Baptist Faith and Message, a 1963
doctrinal statement, said John Sullivan, executive director of the Florida Baptist Convention</B>. It is thought to be the
first time a state convention has used the doctrinal statement to exercise discipline against a church. The statement's
preamble specifies it was not intended to be used as a creed but for "general instruction and guidance" of Baptists
and others. Charles Brannon, pastor of Riverside Christian Church in Hernando, said his congregation will try to
affiliate with like-minded Baptist churches. "There are a lot of Southern Baptist churches going the way we are

<B>The 10 Episcopal Church bishops who accused Bishop Walter Righter of heresy for ordaining a non-celibate
homosexual man (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/052796.html">NIRR 5/27</A>) said they would not appeal a church court's decision in his favor, but would create
"a fellowship of Episcopal parishes and dioceses" to resist gay ordinations</B>. The court found that there is "no Core
Doctrine prohibiting the ordination of a non-celibate, homosexual person living in a faithful and committed sexual
relationship with a person of the same sex." But bishops who knowingly ordain non-celibate gays or permit the
blessing of homosexual unions "do so without the authority of Scripture," the 10 bishops said at a news conference.
The group also said it will take its case to the denomination's General Convention next year. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>Twenty liberal Catholic groups began a drive to gather 1 million signatures in support of a more democratic church</B>.
The petition backs the right of priests to marry, of women to be ordained, and of lay people to participate in the
selection of pastors and bishops. The groups want more freedom for those who dissent from Church teaching and
the right of married couples to use artificial birth control, which the Vatican opposes. A Gallup Organization survey
of Catholics released May 30 found that most want the next pope to let women be ordained, priests marry, and the
laity elect their bishops, all barred under present Church rules. The petition drive is being considered a test of the
liberal groups' ability to mobilize the laity.
<BR><B>...National Conference of Catholic Bishops leader Anthony Pilla warned the petitioners, saying he supports dialogue,
but opposes "continued challenges to the teachings and the authority of the Church</B>." The National Committee of
Catholic Laymen, a Washington-based group that supports Catholic orthodoxy, accused the petition organizers of
not being Catholic because they "have probably not seen the inside of a Catholic church in years -- if ever." But
Linda Pieczynski, president of Chicago-based Call to Action, one of the organizing groups, said, "If you exclude
people like us from being Catholic, you'd see 80% of the people in the pews disappear." NIRR 6/24/96

the plank. Pat Buchanan promised to oppose the move at the party's convention in August and Dobson said he
foresees "a confrontation." The Christian Coalition's Ralph Reed added that "there will be opposition from members

against the activities. Lisa Herdahl said her five children, who were baptized as Lutherans and attend a Pentecostal
Sunday school, were taunted for not participating in the activities at rural North Pontotoc Attendance Center in Ecru.
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution allows objective study of the Bible or religion as part of a
secular program of education, but North Pontotoc's classes were not objective, Biggers ruled. The school's religious

mob attacked during Sunday services June 9 and stoned and violently tore apart most of the churches, Baptist Press

from the platform, then began burning motorcycles and other vehicles outside. When police arrested several members
of the mob, they found a list of some 50 churches targeted for destruction in Surabaya. The government-controlled
media did not report the incidents, possibly to prevent further violence, BP said. Officials in the Christian division
of Indonesia's Religion Department said churches that don't have police protection should suspend meetings, but it
is unclear whether police protection has been offered at the local level. Government and Muslim leaders have been

<B>Whatever the outcome of the June 30 Russian election runoff, missions organizations are expecting more restrictions
on foreign religious groups working in the country</B>. A resurgence of nationalism and the antipathy of the Russian
Orthodox Church is creating an atmosphere of intolerance, they say.
<BR><B>...At least 19 regional and city governments have laws that restrict missionary work, violating the Russian
Constitution's religious freedom provisions, the International Law Group's Lauren Homer told NIRR</B>. Some laws
are so restrictive that even Russian nationals not born in particular regions are considered foreigners and denied
permission to do religious work. Most ministries cannot afford to appeal their case to higher levels, so the laws
remain. 
<BR><B>...The Russian Orthodox Church increasingly is wielding its political clout to influence more such laws</B>. The 1,000
year-old church, a powerful force in Russian history, is a symbol of nationalist sentiments, and most political leaders
try to ingratiate themselves with its leaders, Homer said. "There has been a tremendous propaganda campaign from
the highest levels against foreign missionaries and for the Orthodox Church." 
<BR><B>...This month, Moscow Patriarch Aleksy II asked Parliament to ban the work of all foreign religious groups not
specifically invited by the ROC</B>. Earlier, he asked officials in the Komi Republic and Perm to strictly regulate foreign
religious organizations "that have nothing in common with Russia's Orthodox traditions," news reports said. In
Moscow, customs officials seized a shipment of Bibles bound for Pentecostal congregations, but released them after
discovering that they had been produced in cooperation with the Orthodox Church. 
<BR><B>..."We have always kept in mind that we are only there temporarily," said Russian Ministries Director Peter Deyneka</B>.
"We are there to prepare nationals to expand their ministries, train new leaders, and build an infrastructure so they
can survive and grow." The ministry has helped train more than 1,000 indigenous church planters in five years. Other
groups agree. "As long as people have been trained to witness, then the only ones who can muzzle the gospel are

<B>Messianic Jews and evangelicals in Israel are concerned about recent political gains by Orthodox Jewish religious

of Jews who profess faith in Christ, said Chosen People Ministries President Sam Nadler. The groups may pose "a
tremendous threat to Jewish believers in Israel," because their gains in recent elections made them an influential part
of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government, he said. 
<BR><B>...Messianic Jews fear Netanyahu will appoint an Orthodox party member as Minister of the Interior, the position
governing religious affairs, visas, and determining who is considered to be Jewish</B>. Orthodox parties have supported
laws stripping Messianic Jews of their Jewish identity, preventing them from returning to Israel, according to CPM.
"The Orthodox hate the Messianics here with a passion," said one Messianic Jew ministering in Israel. Orthodox in
the Interior Ministry tried to expel a number of Messianic families from the country several years ago (NIRR

building," Baldwin said. 
<BR><B>...Mixed with calls for forgiveness were emotions of outrage and fear, and calls for justice</B>. "If we don't work
together, there is a very good chance we'll all be destroyed," said Myrlie Evers-Williams, national NAACP
chairwoman. Thirty-eight ministers of burned and vandalized black churches, together with the National Council of
Churches, went to Washington and accused investigators of focusing on church members and being reluctant to
consider race as a motivating factor. Federal agents said they weren't discounting any theories about the fires,
including ideas that they are a conspiracy against blacks or copycat crimes.
<BR><B>...President Clinton opened a toll-free hot line for tips (1-888-ATF-FIRE), supported legislation to make it easier to

have included thousands of church leaders and laity (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/112795.html">NIRR 11/27/95</A>). For information, call (888) FASTING.
<P>
<B>A girl who testified she was molested by the so-called Wenatchee (Wash.) church sex ring (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/122595.html">NIRR 12/25/95</A>) now
says she lied</B>. The development potentially affects convictions and pending lawsuits. The 13-year-old, one of several
children who testified in the case, said Wenatchee police detective Bob Perez pressured her to lie. During the trial,
prosecutors alleged a child-sex ring operated from a central Washington Pentecostal church. Fourteen people pleaded
guilty to child rape and molestation charges, five others were found guilty by juries, and charges were dropped or
reduced against five others. Three defendants were acquitted, including pastor Robert Roberson and his wife, Connie.
<P>
<B>North Carolina's Lutheran bishop resigned, admitting sexual misconduct</B>. Mark Menees of the North Carolina
Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America acknowledged a lengthy involvement, before he became a
bishop, with a woman for whom he had "a pastoral responsibility." In a statement, Menees, 46, said he "violated my
accountability to the Triune God, to the whole church, and to my wife and family."
<P>
<B>Church groups decided not to protest Gay Day at Paramount King's Island amusement park in King's Mill, Ohio
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/051396.html">NIRR 5/13</A>)</B>. The groups had wanted the churches to send 4,000 "missionaries" wearing white shirts to the park on
June 2 to counter an equal number of homosexuals wearing red shirts, but decided instead to "warn people to stay
away" from the park. The event unintentionally could have become confrontational, a spokesman for the churches
said. However, the group planned to have people in the park monitoring activities and taping inappropriate behavior
and reporting it to park officials. 
<P>
<B>A proposed Million Woman March, scheduled for this month in Los Angeles, has been canceled (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/030496.html">NIRR 3/4</A>)</B>.
Organizers of the event, inspired by the Million Man March in Washington last year, did not plan adequately, Los
Angeles Police Department Chief Willie Williams said.
<P>
<B>MAD DADS, a group of black men who patrol neighborhoods to keep inner-city youth from joining gangs (NIRR
1/22), received a three-year, $163,000 grant from the Kellogg Foundation</B>. The group, whose name stands for Men
Against Destruction Defending Against Drugs and Social Disorder, has 46 chapters in 14 states and hopes to continue
expanding. Most of the men are Christians. Some converts to Catholicism are being baptized in a pool of water as
a priest pours water over them, a news report said. Though the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) approved such
baptisms and later Church documents referred to them as the preferred way to baptize young people and adults, the
idea has been slow to take hold in some parishes. Priests in Los Angeles find that people like it once they see what
happens, the report said.
<P>
<B>Court decisions that have "thrown the door wide-open to physician-assisted suicide in America" prompted the
Christian Medical and Dental Society to produce The Battle for Life, a resource kit to help churches teach members
about the sanctity of life, caring for the suffering, and influencing policy</B>. "I find even Christians are confused on
this issue," CMDS Associate Director Gene Rudd told NIRR. "We have to try and understand God's view of life
and how we treat the weak. We want folks to minister to the suffering...to meet their pain and emotional needs with
compassion so people won't have to be in the awful, miserable state of wanting to die." The $25 packet includes
a video by the Anti-Euthanasia Taskforce, a cassette tape of radio public service announcements, a leader's guide,
overheads, and handouts. The CMDS has distributed more than 700 of the guides in the past month. To contact the
CMDS, call (423) 844-1000.

<B>South Africa: In his final sermon before retiring this month, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu warned church
members not to become "docile lapdogs</B>." Tutu, 64, was instrumental in the fight to end apartheid, and said that
greed, crime, and corruption could destroy the new democracy (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/091895.html">NIRR 9/18/95</A>). He will continue to chair the
two-year Truth and Reconciliation Commission that is investigating human rights abuses under apartheid. The
Anglican Elective Assembly voted this month to install Winston Ndungane, Bishop of Kimberly and Kuruman, to
the position of Archbishop of Capetown.

<B>Mongolia: Hundreds of Christians are meeting weekly to pray for the June 30 national elections</B>. Because many
communists remain in high government positions, churches have been blocked from constructing buildings or
evangelizing. "I cannot express the gravity of this situation," missionary Rick Leatherwood said.  North Korea: The
country is facing a "potentially devastating famine," said Nelson Graham of Seattle-based East Gates Ministries.
Per-person food allotments have dwindled so that people cannot maintain their body weight, he said. Graham visited
the country this month to oversee distribution of 800,000 pounds of rice donated by his ministry; the food can feed
40,000 people for one month.

<B>South Korea: Church leaders last month committed to "adopting" more than 1,000 of the remaining 1,700 groups

unevangelized groups by the year 2000. The churches pledge to visit and spiritually "map," or evaluate, the groups,
pray for them, and send missions teams.

<B>Colombia: Fearing the coming of the Antichrist, Colombians baptized 20,000 children during the weekend prior to
June 6, almost 10 times more than usual, and churches were flooded on the date, officials said</B>. Because Scripture
says the Antichrist will bear the number 666, many were afraid that the date -- the sixth day of the sixth month in
a year ending in six -- would herald his coming. Many "have not learned the core of the gospel and are easily misled
by superstitions," according to Catholic Monsignor Octavio Ruiz of Bogota.

<B>Cuba: Pastor Orson Vila started a new church in the prison where he was held for nine months last year (NIRR

love for them because he had been sent to tell them about Jesus. "God is good to me. He knew what He was doing.
I needed the rest in prison," Vila said after his release last month.

<B>Guatemala: An American missionary has been arrested and is under investigation for allegedly taking part in a
child-snatching ring</B>. Frank Wagoner, 78, a 20-year missionary to the country, runs an adoption agency as a sideline
to his Guatemalan Evangelical Ministries. Authorities raided his home and seized seven babies after a woman
charged one of his workers stole her child. Wagoner's lawyer produced a document which he said proves the woman
willingly gave the baby up for adoption. Parents of other children at the home have testified they also gave them
up for adoption.

<B>Bulgaria: The Sofia city council voted to allow a Baptist organization to resume construction of an orphanage and
Bible school, news reports said</B>. Building has been delayed for a year because the council, under pressure from
Orthodox groups, ordered an investigation into the construction (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/040196.html">NIRR 4/1</A>). Baptists had been in the country for
many years, but under communism the denomination dwindled to fewer than 1,000 believers.

<B>England: A group of Methodist ministers seeks to renew evangelization and church-planting</B>. A woman prophesied
at a 1995 conference that many Methodist minsters would be "touched by God," Discipling A Whole Nation reported.
At a conference this year, Methodist minister Graham Horsley called on 2,000 pastors to become equipped for
evangelization. A group has formed to plant 600 churches by the year 2020, DAWN said.

<B>Ireland: The Supreme Court upheld a national vote amending the constitution to allow divorce in the 90% Catholic
country</B>. The court ruled against opponents, who contended that an illegal government advertising campaign
influenced the vote's outcome. The measure passed last November by .5%, just 9,118 votes out of 1.6 million cast,
news reports said.
<P>
<B>Romania: Evangelical radio stations can continue to broadcast temporarily in Bucharest and Cluj-Napoca</B>. The
permission is surprising because strict broadcast regulations recently were enacted in favor of the Orthodox Church,
said the Vienna, Va.-based Law and Liberty Trust (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/021996.html">NIRR 2/19</A>). The "nationalist-Orthodox lobby" may be "cooking
something else," said Romanian evangelical Paul Negrut. In a letter, an Orthodox archbishop urged government
leaders to restrict or stop broadcasts by evangelical "profaners" and "blasphemers."

<B>The Communist defeat in Mongolia's national elections will increase religious
freedom and opportunities for Christian evangelization -- a milestone for the
country</B>. "It has taken many miracles to do this," said Craig Lawrence of Sioux
Falls, S.D.-based AMONG, a ministry to Mongolia. Communists lost almost 50
legislative seats, and two democratic parties now control 48 of the 76 seats.
Lawrence formed AMONG to take the gospel to Mongolia at the urging of
Campus Crusade for Christ founder Bill Bright.
<BR><B>...A television station AMONG started in Ulan Bator played a key role in the
elections</B>. The station, purchased last year at the request of democratic leaders,
airs news and religious programming. As the election approached and it became
clear a Communist victory would result in more restrictions on Christians,
AMONG let democrats run campaign ads on the station. To increase viewership,
AMONG bought the rights to broadcast the highly popular National Basketball
Association playoffs. "I hate mixing politics and Christ, but in this case we were
specifically directed by the Lord," Lawrence said. 
<BR><B>...The leader of the democratic coalition is a follower of Christ and is likely to
be named speaker of the Parliament</B>. Gonchigdorj, who uses only one name,
prayed to receive Christ after watching the Jesus film in 1992, Lawrence told
NIRR. Gonchigdorj annually attends the National Prayer Breakfast in
Washington, D.C., and has publicly declared faith in Christ, news reports said.
Several other members of the new Parliament have attended the prayer breakfast.
<BR><B>...AMONG also helped draft portions of Mongolia's constitution</B>. In 1992,
Lawrence led 24 American businessmen, politicians, and ministers to the
fledgling democracy as it struggled to institute reforms and draft a constitution.
They arranged the showing of the Jesus film and held seminars on democracy,
free enterprise, and religious freedom. 
<BR><B>..."Can your Jesus help us write our constitution?" a member of the constitutional
committee asked Lawrence</B>. For three days, AMONG member Randy Austad, a
former South Dakota state legislator, helped the Mongolians draft the religious
freedom portion their Constitution, obtaining advice from the office of South
Dakota Sen. Larry Pressler. On the day the team left Mongolia, the
Constitutional Congress approved the religious freedom language. 
<BR><B>...Other Christians have prayed with Mongolia's president, Punsalmaagiyn
Orchibat, a Buddhist</B>. Lawrence, accompanied by Mary Irwin, the widow of
Apollo 15 astronaut Michael Irwin, gave the president a Mongolian flag that had
been to the moon. The president embraced Irwin's adopted 22-year-old
Vietnamese son Joe and kissed him on both cheeks, an indication that he
accepted Joe as a son, Lawrence said. Joe then prayed for the president and the
country. "It would not have been appropriate for any of us to ask except Joe,
because he identified with the people," Irwin said. 
<BR><B>...The Mongolian church is growing</B>. Battle Brown, a U.S. businessman who
visits the country regularly, estimates there are 6,000-10,000 believers, up from
a few hundred in 1992. A dozen U.S. evangelistic agencies, as well as Korean,
German, Danish, Japanese, and Swedish groups, have sent missionaries.
Mongolian believers are beginning to assume church leadership, and one church
of 450 members in Erdenet is led by an indigenous pastor and has planted five
daughter churches. "Mongolians are natural evangelists," a missionary said. NIRR

<B>Five thousand youth from 60 countries are doing missions work in Brazil,
Canada, Mexico, and the United States as part of Target World '96, a Youth
With A Mission initiative July 8 to Aug</B>. 4. The youth, 10-18 years old, gathered
in Atlanta for a weeklong conference and celebration, then left to share their
faith through performing arts, sports programs, and work projects. House Speaker
Newt Gingrich praised the effort for "challenging, motivating, and
equipping...leaders of tomorrow," YWAM said. Target World is the second of
three youth missions gatherings organized by King's Kids, a YWAM discipleship
and evangelism ministry. The first took place in Barcelona, Spain, during the
1992 Olympics and another is planned for 2000. Sixteen American and Canadian
teens biked across the United States to attend the event. NIRR 7/22/96

<B>"Either all Christians are bananas or it's the coolest thing you can imagine," a
member of the Jesus Freaks of Hamburg told a crowd of youth in Dresden,
Germany</B>. "Cool," he said as hands rose in response to his call to become
Christians. The scene took place during Christival '96, a five-day gathering in
May for young Christians to celebrate Christ, renew their spiritual lives, and
evangelize. The first Christival attracted 10,000 to Essen in 1976, and about
20,000 to Nuremburg in 1988, organizers said. This year, more than 40,000
young people from 35 countries attended the festival, held in former East
Germany, where only one in four people claims to be a Christian. 
<BR><B>...Each morning at Dresden's fairgrounds, the crowd separated into 1,500 groups
of 10 to 15 people for Bible study and discipleship</B>. Then participants packed into
vans, cars, and streetcars to attend one of 46 worship services throughout the
city. Some 10,000 people visited 210,000 homes, distributed Christian literature,
and invited people to attend services. The Christival Mile, leading to the main
railway station, included 10 stages with Christian performances and numerous
booths with information about the Christian life and the work of the church
around the world. The youth also contributed money to help inner-city families
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and food for 500 Bosnian families.
<BR><B>...In the evenings, the crowd came together in the nearby soccer stadium for
worship, preaching, and celebration</B>. The final meeting was broadcast live on TV.
Thousands of youth rededicated their lives to God and hundreds more made
first-time decisions to become Christians, event organizer Roland Werner said.

<B>American evangelist Marilyn Hickey preached in Ruse, Bulgaria, last month</B>.
Some 1,200 people heard the charismatic preacher, who also conducted three
days of evangelism training for 300 church and ministry leaders. Bulgaria was
the last stop on a weeklong evangelistic trip that also included Romania, Ukraine,
and Turkey. A ministry team of 200 people accompanied Hickey.
<BR><B>...In Izmail, Ukraine, a crowded bar became the scene of a revival meeting when
team workers began witnessing to customers</B>. In Bulgaria, the group ministered
to Gypsies in street meetings in Braila and delivered 100 suitcases full of
bedding materials, shoes, clothing, toys, and snacks for the City of Hope
Orphanage in Bucharest. NIRR 7/22/96

<B>Billy Graham's June 19-23 crusade broke attendance records at the Metrodome
in Minneapolis, crusade organizers said</B>. At the final meeting, 95,000 people,
including 25,000 who watched a Jumbotron screen outside, heard Graham's
sermon and music by Amy Grant. Some 82,000 attended a youth program June
22 featuring contemporary Christian artists dc Talk and Michael W. Smith as
well as Graham's preaching. Graham had advertised the event on MTV, the FOX
network, rock radio stations, and at movie theaters. A total of 348,000 people
attended during the week, and 33,194 came forward at Graham's invitation to
confess their sins and profess faith in Christ.  
<BR><B>..."Racism, loneliness, boredom, unemployment, AIDS, murder, divorce, suicide
are everywhere," said Graham, 77</B>. The basic problem is "that the human heart
is not right with God. We're alienated from God and we need to come back to
Him, through His Son, Jesus Christ." The race problem "will never be solved
until we have the love of God in our hearts," Graham said. Families are in crisis
because "we are not following God's laws." NIRR 7/22/96

<B>Korean-American students and young professionals prayed for revival in the
United States June 29-July 4 at Colorado State University in Fort Collins</B>. The
2,300 delegates at the conference, called Jesus Awakening Movement for
America '96, came from across the country, with a few from Korea and several
other nations. They expressed deep gratitude for the influence of American
missionaries in Korea and the desire to be used by God to bring revival in the

lives to full-time service for Christ, and more than 100 made first-time
professions of faith in Christ.

<B>Some 14,800 people professed faith in Christ during Greg Laurie's Harvest
Crusade at Anaheim Stadium July 4-7</B>. They included a drug dealer released
from prison two days prior to the crusade, three teens on their way to Mexico
"looking for girls and parties," and a Baptist deacon who said he had been
"running from God for three years," the ministry said.
<BR><B>...About 160,000 people attended the crusade meetings</B>. In addition to Laurie,
speakers included Franklin Graham and Elizabeth Dole, wife of GOP presidential
candidate Bob Dole, who said she once let success crowd out "life's most
important priorities." High-volume Christian contemporary music preceded each
night's message, and a fireworks show capped the first night of the crusade.
<BR><B>...Laurie also preached at Disneyland May 9, and 400 people responded by
professing faith in Christ</B>. "Frontierland became holy ground," Laurie's ministry

book, The Sixty-Minute Father (Broadman & Holman), which encourages fathers
to work less and spend more time with their children, has received media
attention and a receptive audience among leaders in business, Parliament, and the
church. The book "is full of Christian faith, but is written so people who aren't
Christians can understand it," Parsons told NIRR. Parsons is executive director
of Care for the Family. The "sister organization" to Focus on the Family formed
after James Dobson suggested the idea to British church leaders. Like its
American counterpart, Care for the Family holds seminars on marriage,
parenting, and the family from a Christian perspective. Parsons teaches about 100
seminars a year.
<BR><B>...Parsons holds business-management seminars advising clients to avoid

<B>The volatile issue of homosexual ordination dominated the 208th General
Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) this month in Albuquerque, N.M</B>.
Commissioners voted 313-236 to change the church's constitution, called the
Book of Order, by banning homosexuals and lesbians from serving as ministers,
deacons, or elders. The standards for ordination would be "fidelity within the
covenant of marriage of a man and a woman, or chastity in singleness." The
proposed policy also prohibits ordained, unmarried heterosexuals from having
sex. After the vote, about 1,000 of the 3,500 people marched through the
assembly hall at the Albuquerque Convention Center to signal their support for
the ordination of gay and lesbian Presbyterians. The policy is being sent to the
171 presbyteries, or local clusters of churches, for ratification. 
<BR><B>...About 20 pastors have told their congregations they are gay or lesbian, and 73
Presbyterian congregations have declared themselves More Light (NIRR 3/7/94)
churches, willing to ordain gay and lesbian members to church office, news
reports said</B>. Those ordained gays potentially could be charged and expelled from
the 2.7-million-member denomination if the chastity requirement is adopted into
the Book of Order, PCUSA Communications Director Gary Luhr told NIRR.
<BR><B>...Delegates elected John Buchanan, considered a peacemaker in the faction-torn
denomination, to a one-year term as moderator</B>. The Chicago pastor said he
believes homosexuals should be allowed to be ordained, but will let individual
churches decide whether they want to allow homosexual clergy to serve in their
congregations. 
<BR><B>...In a surprise vote, delegates fired -- or refused to confirm for a second
four-year term -- James D</B>. Brown as head of the church's ministry programs.
Jerry Van Marter of the Presbyterian News Service called Brown's rejection as
executive director of the PCUSA General Assembly Council "the most stunning
vote in many years" and a reflection of discontent with denominational
leadership. Van Marter noted a perceived lack of firm leadership at the council,
dissatisfaction with the denomination's debate over ordaining homosexuals, and
fallout from the controversial RE-Imagining conference in 1993 (NIRR 1/10/94).
Brown's term ends in September. The PCUSA also: voted to proceed with
participation in the Consultation on Church Union, or COCU (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/042996.html">NIRR 4/29</A>); gave
more responsibility to commissioned lay pastors; and elected Clifton Kirkpatrick,
director of international ministries, as stated clerk, or top ecclesiastical officer.

refuse Holy Communion from bishops and priests who accept homosexual priests

America adopted a formal resolution last month in Belleville, Ill., stating that
those "who knowingly ordain practicing homosexuals, authorize the blessing of
same-sex unions, or teach the same, have broken communion with orthodox
Christians until they publicly recant."
<BR><B>...Bishops and priests "sow false doctrine" when they support same-sex unions
or homosexual priests, said the ESA, which is composed of bishops, clergy and
laity</B>. Traditionalists should not participate in any functions led or sponsored by
such people, and should redirect contributions to groups that "hold to the
scriptural standards and the orthodox and catholic faith," ESA said. NIRR

<B>Blacks must become more politically active, delegates to the African Methodist

modifications are necessary to make programs more effective. The predominantly
African-American denomination also urged its members to vote, saying that in
light of the "discrimination and injustices our foreparents had to endure" to make
black suffrage possible, "non-participation in the election process is
unconscionable."
<BR><B>...The AME also said premarital sex is wrong and homosexual practices "violate
both biological design and God's intent</B>." In addition, the denomination elected
three new bishops to serve the AME Church in Africa. The AME has 3.5 million

<B>United Methodist disagreement over homosexuality continues at the local level</B>.
Despite the reaffirmation by the General Conference of the UMC that
homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/042996.html">NIRR 4/29</A>), the
Wisconsin and the Oregon-Idaho conferences adopted resolutions declaring
themselves "reconciling" conferences. As such, they accept people of all sexual
orientations into membership and try to fully include gays and lesbians in church
life. Four UMC conferences are members of the Reconciling Congregation
Program, a network of churches, conferences, and agencies that officially express
their acceptance of gays and lesbians (NIRR 9/7/92).
<BR><B>...Meanwhile, 43 UMC pastors in the Wisconsin Annual Conference issued a
declaration saying they will not be bound by the decision of the Wisconsin
conference to welcome gays and lesbians into their churches</B>. And delegates to
the annual meeting of the West Ohio Conference voiced support for the
denomination's action in April, thus contradicting West Ohio Bishop Judith

unsuccessfully urging the church to drop its current doctrinal stance. NIRR

<B>The United Methodist Church's method of appointing ministers may change after
New England Bishop Herbert Skeete compromised with an Andover, Mass.,
congregation, giving it veto power over his choice for pastor, the Boston Globe
said</B>. Skeete had faced an exodus from the 200-member North Boston Korean
Methodist Church, whose members insisted on appointment of a Korean-speaking
pastor. In Korea, Methodist churches operate under a system involving
negotiation and compromise in choosing a new minister. But in the UMC's
central appointment system, the bishop makes the decision. 
<BR><B>...Skeete lost one Korean flock, the former Korean United Methodist Church of
Boston, which dropped "united" from its name and adopted a charter from the
Methodist church in Korea</B>. Concerns are rising in the 13 other Korean New
England United Methodist congregations, a church spokesman said. 
<BR><B>...The UMC regularly debates the central-appointment system, and how long it
will continue churchwide is "hard to say," Skeete said</B>. District Superintendent
James Todd said, "I shudder to think how other churches, Anglo or Korean, will
react when they learn what we did in Andover." NIRR 7/22/96

<B>The Christian Reformed Church in North America refused to back down from

decision-making body, decided last month in Grand Rapids, Mich., to reject 24
petitions that challenged the right of regional church groups to ordain women.
After the vote, CRC leaders encouraged unity, but some delegates said they
planned to leave the church. Also, CRC delegates restricted ties with the
denomination's mother church, The Reformed Church of the Netherlands, over
its policy of allowing homosexuals to be pastors, which the CRC does not allow.

President Clinton and members of the U.S</B>. Congress. Lebed's failure to list
Judaism as a traditional religion is a signal of "a changing Russia," American
Jewish Committee executive director David Harris said. Many Russians equate
Jews with Western influences, and during the presidential campaign several
parties exploited anti-Semitic feeling, said Adrian Karatnycky of Freedom House,
a human rights group. Last month the government closed several regional offices
of the Jewish Agency, which has organized the emigration of more than 430,000
Russian Jews to Israel since 1989. NIRR 7/22/96

<B>Robert Hussein will remain in Kuwait to appeal his conviction for apostasy and
death sentence issued by an Islamic court, according to the Jubilee Campaign,

since December and would be granted asylum in the United States if he
requested it, Rutherford Institute International Director Pedro Moreno told NIRR.
"He's obviously a well-qualified case for political asylum," he said. Rutherford,
which defends religious liberty, drafted a seven-page appeal memorandum that
Hussein filed with the court June 29. A hearing is scheduled for Sept. 15. 
<BR><B>...The government of Kuwait said Hussein is not in danger since the country's
constitution guarantees religious freedom</B>. The government tolerates Christian
churches and there is no official sanction against converts. But Kuwait has two
legislative systems, the civil law and Muslim Sharia law, and confusion exists
as to which has precedence, according to Jubilee. "The Kuwaiti government must
state that the judgment of the Sharia court was unconstitutional and illegal to the
extent that it encourages people to commit murder," the group said. 
<BR><B>...International pressure in support for Hussein is growing</B>. Human rights groups,
religious organizations, and political leaders have petitioned the U.S. State
Department and the Kuwaiti government to protect him. The Southern Baptist
Foreign Mission Board, more than a dozen national evangelical alliances in

<B>Cuba is increasing its pressure on evangelical house churches</B>. "The oven has

nine house churches in Holguin province were closed in the last four weeks,
according to Tom White, U.S. director of the Bartlesville, Okla.-based Voice of
the Martyrs. Several churches were destroyed. In Cuatro Caminos, a police
brigade tore down a newly built church, and in Buenaventura police leveled a
house where church members had gathered for services. No reasons were given
for the actions. "No pretext is even needed anymore," a U.S. church official with
ties to the island told NIRR.
<BR><B>...The crackdown has been under way for months, the official said</B>. Seven
churches were closed in Havana this year and all evangelical churches are
endangered, he said. The total number of closures is difficult to determine.
Visitors to the country cannot preach unless they obtain a religious visa, and
house churches in some areas can no longer meet in groups larger than 10.

a Cuban pastor who presides over 34 house churches</B>. In Mao, where a house
church was closed, 200 to 400 Christians protested outside a station house until
police threatened to shoot them. Pastors are not complying with closure orders,

President Clinton said</B>. The fires have occurred mostly at black churches, but
statistics also show an increase of fires at white churches, synagogues, and
mosques across the country, he said. Racism is to blame for many, but not all,
of the black-church arsons, U.S. Justice Department official Deval Patrick told
delegates to the annual convention of the NAACP.
<BR><B>...Clinton designated $6 million for police to use in combatting the wave of
burnings, and signed a law doubling jail sentences for adults convicted of the

and told the NAACP the burnings attacked "the whole idea of America."

some lugging in hundreds of gallons at a time. When inquisitive nonbelievers
came for relief of pain, they heard the gospel, and "hundreds and hundreds have
been added to the kingdom of God," Jackson said. "It may sound foolish, but the
result glorifies God."

32,000-member denomination has 300 congregations.
<P>
<B>The nation's largest seminary, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, is off
probation</B>. The Association of Theological Schools had imposed probation on the
Forth Worth, Texas, school in January 1995 after its theologically conservative
trustees fired former president Russell Dilday (NIRR 3/21/94). In its
investigation, the ATS determined that the seminary's trustee board failed to
provide regular evaluation of the president, deal sensitively with various seminary
constituencies, or maintain the seminary's "integrity and freedom." The seminary,
whose accreditation the ATS reaffirmed, must report by April 1997 about
policies that deal with the commission's concerns.
<P>
<B>The Unitarian Universalist Church has endorsed legalization of same-sex
marriages, the first major denomination to do so</B>. The vote at the church's annual
assembly, held in Indianapolis, sets official policy for 1,040 Unitarian
congregations, but individual churches may decide whether to have such
weddings. The church has 205,000 members.
<P>
<B>The U.S</B>. House of Representatives passed the Defense of Marriage Act 342-67
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/062496.html">NIRR 6/24</A>). The bill says no state is required to recognize a homosexual
marriage from another state. It also changes federal law to define marriage as a
legal union only "between one man and one woman as husband and wife." The
bill now is on the fast track in the Senate.
<P>
<B>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America said its membership was nearly
unchanged during 1995</B>. There were 5,190,489 baptized members, a drop of less
than two-tenths of 1%, in 11,023 congregations. Average attendance at weekend
worship remained at 1.6 million, or 30.2% of all baptized members. 
<P>
<B>BellAtlantic has offered to replace an Ipswich, Mass., Methodist church's
lightning-damaged steeple -- if the church will allow the new structure to house
a transmitter for cellular phones</B>. Zoning laws require cellular phone service
providers to hide their transmitters, generally 60-400 feet high. Churches can
collect revenue by "renting" their steeples, according to news reports.

<B>Algeria: The bodies of seven Trappist monks abducted from their monastery in
March (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/041596.html">NIRR 4/15</A>) were recovered, government officials said</B>. Members of the
Armed Islamic Group, which has fought a civil war since 1992, slit the monks'
throats after the French government refused to negotiate the release from prison
of several AIG members, Religion News Service said. Muslim and Christian
leaders around the world decried the act. Muslims, Catholics, Protestants, and
Jews joined in a demonstration in Paris to protest the murders.
<P>
<B>Rwanda: Political leaders pledged to pray together for revival in the country</B>.
Members of Parliament and the Cabinet had been holding prayer meetings
separately, unaware of each other, said San Antonio-based evangelist Sammy
Tippit, who visited the country last month. More than 17,000 people attended
Tippit's evangelistic meetings and about 3,500 prayed to become Christians, he
said. 
<P>
<B>South Africa: The Cabinet approved legislation allowing abortion on demand in
the first trimester of pregnancy, angering many religious leaders, some of whom
supported the African National Congress's rise to power</B>. The ANC dismissed
objections of Christian and Muslim groups and ordered its party members to vote
for the legislation, news reports said. Emil Blaser of the country's Catholic
Bishops Conference said it was incomprehensible that a group that struggled for
the recognition of human dignity would approve the taking of human life.

<B>Azerbaijan: Missionary groups are beginning to suffer a "slow increase in
government suppression," the Commission on Security and Cooperation in
Europe said</B>. The government's refusal to grant registration to Word of Life
Center in Baku, the country's largest Protestant church, may be a "precursor to
a more intensified state-sponsored effort against people of faith."

<B>Israel: Tension between Orthodox Jews and more liberal branches of Judaism are
increasing since the Orthodox won 23 seats in Israel's Knesset (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/062496.html">NIRR 6/24</A>)</B>. The
Orthodox parties seek laws requiring stricter religious observance. They also
want reversal of a recent Supreme Court decision that forces the government to
recognize conversions to Reform and Conservative Judaism. Reform Jews have asked for an investigation into a
statement that was broadcast on the radio by an Orthodox rabbi, that they say "sanctions shedding
the blood of Reform Jews."
<P>
<B>Philippines: Companies linked to the leader of El Shaddai, a charismatic Catholic
movement, are under investigation by the country's Securities and Exchange
Commission, news reports say</B>. Authorities allege that the two companies, Delta
Broadcasting Corp. and El Shaddai Golden Rule Corp., offered shares to El
Shaddai members without notifying the SEC, which is illegal. Mike Velarde, a
wealthy entrepreneur before founding El Shaddai (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/031896.html">NIRR 3/18</A>), denied
wrongdoing and invited Catholic authorities to investigate his organization. 
<P>
<B>Philippines: Christians in the southern Mindanao region pelted President Fidel
Ramos' car with tomatoes and placards during a recent visit</B>. Ramos is trying to
gain support for a peace agreement his government mediated with the Moro
National Liberation Front, a rebel Muslim group. The MNLF and other more
radical Muslim groups have been in armed rebellion for 20 years, seeking to
make the largely Christian region into an independent Islamic state (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/041596.html">NIRR 4/15</A>). Under 
the new peace plan, MNLF leader Nur Misuari will head a regional economic development 
council to enforce the peace and begin an autonomous regional government. More than 10,000 
Christians have pledged to take up arms to oppose the plan if put into effect.

<B>Australia: Christian political leaders are opposing a euthanasia law that took

in shame," said Christian Call to Australia director Fred Nile. Australia is one of
the first nations "since Hitler's Germany to legalize murder," he said. Adopted
by the territory's parliament in May, the law allows terminally ill patients to
receive lethal injections with the consent of three doctors. The law is being
challenged in the Northern Territory Supreme Court and is expected to be
considered by the Australian Supreme Court. Christian lawmakers in Australia's
parliament are readying legislation to overturn the law.

month, Maria Francisca Ventura received a death threat after a memorial service
for her martyred husband, Manuel Saquic (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/031896.html">NIRR 3/18</A>). In May, church
moderator Samuel Merida Ajanel was kidnapped and held for five days, and his
captors said they would kill him if he did not resign from his church positions.
Paramilitary groups have targeted the denomination because it speaks out against
human-rights abuses, the church said. The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)
condemned the violence and sent members to Guatemala to protect ministers as
they travel.

<B>Bulgaria: The schism in the Orthodox Church broke open when rebel priests
elected a new patriarch in defiance of church authorities</B>. Patriarch Pimen was
installed 25 years to the day after Patriarch Maxim, the official head of the
Orthodox Church, assumed the post. The election of Pimen is historic because
"Maxim was appointed...but not elected," a priest said.
<BR><B>...A lawyer for the Holy Synod said Bulgarian courts will decide who is the true
patriarch</B>. Pimen and his followers split from the Orthodox Church in 1989,
accusing Maxim of being a puppet of the former Communist regime (NIRR
4/15).  
<P>
<B>England: Church of England and British Methodist Church officials are
suggesting that the two groups begin reunification talks in 1997</B>. A report
suggests that the two denominations begin by recognizing each other as valid
Christian churches with hopes of eventually integrating their ministries and
performing joint ordinations. British Methodists broke from the Anglicans after
reformer John Wesley's death in 1791. Reconciliation talks in 1972 and 1982
failed. 
<P>
<B>England: The British Methodist Church condemned police who forcibly removed
an ethnic Chinese immigrant who was seeking refuge in a church sanctuary</B>.
Albert Tong, who has a British-born wife and child, had been ordered deported
to China after losing a drawn-out legal battle. The Church's Commission for
Racial Justice expressed its outrage at the police invasion of the sanctuary.
<P>
<B>Russia: Since 1991, an evangelical church in Kirovo-Chepetsk has grown to 400
members, planted eight churches, and is planting six more, said Slavic Gospel
Association President Robert Provost</B>. "The spiritual hunger that exists knows no
bounds. Just five years ago there were no evangelical believers" in the region,
he said. The SGA and the Russian Union of Evangelical Christians-Baptists are
teaming with church pastor Anatoly Oleink to broadcast a 30-minute Sunday
morning TV show to the region.

Crusade for Christ International.

<B>Renewal is occurring in mainline Protestant churches, but its outcome remains in question</B>.
Can renewalists rouse enough people in the pews to make a difference? Is the liberal
establishment too entrenched for reform efforts to succeed? Are denominations headed for the
graveyard of irrelevance anyway? Should renewal focus instead on creating new alliances that
will in effect replace the denominations and better reflect biblical concepts of Christian unity?
Those were some of the questions raised at last month's annual meeting of leaders of renewal
groups in the historic Protestant denominations. Churches represented included the Episcopal
Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the
United Church of Christ, the United Methodist Church, and the United Church of Canada.
<BR><B>...Denominations are in crisis because they have ignored their theological and spiritual roots,
the two dozen participants at the two-day meeting in Washington, D.C., agreed</B>. Renewal
endeavors, whether confrontations with ecclesiastical bureaucrats over issues or efforts to
awaken people in the pews, must be based on theology and spirituality, they said.
<BR><B>...The renewal leaders noted several trends in mainline denominations that are fostering
renewal or show the need for it</B>.
<BR><B>...There is a proliferation of new renewal groups and evangelical fellowships in some
denominations, they said</B>. For example, evangelical fellowships have sprouted in more than
half (40) of the regional conferences in the 8.6-million-member United Methodist Church,
according to James Heidinger of Good News, an evangelical movement in the UMC.   
<BR><B>...Broad-based groups of moderates and conservatives known as "confessing church"
movements are forming</B>. These movements are rallying around core statements of doctrine.
Some are calling their denominations to scriptural accountability for what is promoted by
their agencies and taught in their seminaries. They address such issues as neo-pagan worship,
sexuality and the family, and ecumenism, said UMC theologian Tom Oden of Drew
University (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/101695.html">NIRR 10/16/95</A>). A former liberal himself, he is a leader in the new, fast-growing
confessing church movement within the UMC.    
<BR><B>...Partnerships of like-minded churches from different denominations in networks or "strategic
alliances" are developing</B>. Such alliances are the wave of the future, and are beginning to
replace denominationalism in New England, said David Runnion-Bareford of Biblical Witness
Fellowship, a group in the United Church of Christ. At the local level, the alliances are
uniting networks of pastors, youth ministries, women's groups, and mission cooperatives
across denominational lines, he said. For many churches, he added, the annual Congress of
the Boston-based Evangelistic Association of New England has replaced the annual
conference or synod of their own denominations (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/020596.html">NIRR 2/5</A>). Some 1,100 congregations
belong to the EANE. A number of churches reportedly are forwarding less money to
denominational headquarters and directing the rest to projects closer to their theological
liking, often closer to home.   
<BR><B>...There is a drift of some denominations toward de facto Unitarianism</B>. Several leaders
warned that arch-feminists, gay rights advocates, and other "radicals" in positions of power
are shaping agendas and influencing church pronouncements. Church agencies are focusing
more on political correctness than on the mission of the church, they complained. NIRR

<B>Chicago's largest crusade in 25 years is taking place during April and May</B>. Say Yes Chicago
with Luis Palau, a regionwide outreach, includes some 125 rallies, banquets, seminars, and
other events in Chicago and nearby Libertyville, Waukegan, Elgin, Oak Brook, Aurora,
Lincolnshire, Winnetka, Naperville, Arlington Heights, and Palatine. Larger rallies will be
held in the Rosemont Horizon, University of Illinois at Chicago Pavilion, and World Music
Theater. Evangelists Palau, E.V. Hill, and Tony Evans, and Chinese, Hispanic, and Korean
speakers will target various ethnic groups. The crusade's finale, on Memorial Day in
downtown Chicago's Grant Park, is expected to draw up to 300,000 people. The crusade is
the largest in the city since Billy Graham came there 25 years ago, organizers said.
<BR><B>...Members of nearly 2,000 churches, including Asians, blacks, Hispanics, and whites, are
cooperating, as are dispensationalist and charismatic groups</B>. Every major African-American
denomination is participating in the crusade, according to Mark Anderson, chairman of the
executive committee that has worked for three years planning Say Yes Chicago. While
acknowledging that "differences are significant and important to us," crusade organizers
"learned that those things that bind us together are more important than what divides us," said
Irwin Lutzer. He is senior pastor of The Moody Church and chairman of the crusade's
pastoral committee. The crusade will be preached in several languages, and Palau's messages
will be translated into Spanish, Korean, and Chinese.
<BR><B>...Organizers hope the crusade will ease ethnic tensions in the city</B>. "Chicago is more divided
than most cities," Anderson said. Many Chicago neighborhoods are "ethnically pure" and
residents know which streets divide their group from others. "The hate that has built up is a
lose-lose situation," he told NIRR. Anderson said he was stunned by the depth of anger that
surfaced among Christians during the crusade preparations. After working with Anderson and
becoming his friend, one black man told him that "six months ago I would have walked away
from you because I hated every white man." NIRR 4/1/96

<B>Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship announced formation of the International Renewal
Network</B>. Some 30 renewal leaders, including the TACF's John Arnott, Colorado Springs
pastor Ted Haggard, and Gerald Coats of Britain's Pioneer Churches network, are
spearheading the loose affiliation of church renewal movements around the world, TACF
pastor Fred Wright told NIRR. Most have been affected by the Toronto Blessing or similar
manifestations of the "renewing work of the Holy Spirit," he said. IRN's purpose is to
provide a point of contact for other renewal movements worldwide and encourage those
wanting to be involved. IRN is establishing a Home Page on the World Wide Web where
churches can post stories about renewal, find out about conferences, and explore new
directions with other churches. "It's a means of ongoing communication and can give new
churches a first level of contact," Wright said. NIRR 4/1/96

<B>Evangelicals who worry that their movement is more concerned with unity than truth are
convening a summit April 17-20 in Cambridge, Mass</B>. The Alliance of Confessing
Evangelicals will host some 100 pastors, scholars, parachurch leaders, and writers. The
summit will include presentations of academic papers examining evangelicalism and issuance
of a declaration. 
<BR><B>...Many conservative Protestant churches have "lost their faithfulness to the Bible in both faith
and practice," the Alliance said</B>. The ACE cited "accommodation" with secular culture, such
as the "pragmatism and consumerism of the church-growth movement"; the "therapeutic

<B>A series of conferences for women is drawing overflow crowds</B>. About 50,000 women are

<B>The Worldwide Church of God continues to emerge from theological isolationism toward
mainstream Christianity (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29/95</A>)</B>. "More and more of the Christian community is

WCG has had "very positive contacts with the greater Christian community."
<BR><B>...Skepticism about the WCG's transformation was understandable, Tkach said</B>. WCG founder
Herbert W. Armstrong insisted his was the true church while teaching doctrines that
contradicted historic Christianity. "We called other churches children of the devil," Tkach

<BR><B>...WCG doctrine began changing after Armstrong's death when church leaders re-examined
his ideas</B>. The WCG now teaches the doctrines of the Trinity and salvation by grace through
faith. But certain distinctives are maintained. Members still worship on Saturdays and observe
seven Holy Days based on the Old Testament, but the observances are no longer required.

former members</B>. But friendly contacts with the larger Christian community have encouraged

Challenge center in the prison and gave permission for inmates to serve time there. Hart plans

facing termination would become an associate pastor or other staff member at a "refuge
church." The "offended church," or congregation asking the minister to resign, would agree to

Southwestern classes on conflict management, personal communication skills, and
husband/wife relationship issues. Housing for the minister and his family would be provided
at the seminary. Several other denominations have expressed interest in the program, Baptist
Press reported.

agencies have left the area and refugees fear no one cares, DeSalvo told NIRR. Yet their faith
"is overwhelming. They trust God for everything."

<B>Volunteer prison chaplains from two Minneapolis congregations are suing in federal court
after being forbidden to discuss gospel passages concerning sexual morality</B>. The volunteers
often visit prisoners to listen, counsel, worship, and study. But Hennepin County official
Marilyn Schoonover told them in a letter that they would not be invited back to the Adult
Corrections Facility in Plymouth, near Minneapolis, if they continued to point out Bible
verses against homosexuality. Schoonover cited an incident in which the volunteers "told
residents that homosexuality is a sin."
<BR><B>...A lesbian prisoner reportedly was offended when a volunteer from a Church of God in
Christ congregation quoted passages from the Bible about homosexuality</B>. The jail must be
"free of comments or actions which may be offensive" to inmates, and volunteer chaplains
must speak to them "without judgment," Schoonover said in the letter, in which she
interpreted a Hennepin County diversity policy. 
<BR><B>...The volunteers say that teaching prisoners to adopt a godly lifestyle must include addressing
issues of sexual purity</B>. Attorney Jordan Lorence, who represents the volunteers, told NIRR

<B>The U.S</B>. Supreme Court agreed to review whether "bubble" zones at abortion clinics violate
the constitutional free-speech rights of demonstrators (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/111395.html">NIRR 11/13/95</A>). Proponents of the
zones say that they help shield clinic patients and staff members from protesters. Thus, the
zones diffuse the potential for violence that could result from the aggressive speech and
tactics of some protesters, clinic operators say.
<BR><B>...Pro-life groups applauded the decision</B>. Bubble zones are the creation of people who can't
stand the idea of Christians "offering alternatives to death," said Flip Benham of Operation
Rescue National. "We are getting arrested on public sidewalks," Benham said. Vicki Saporta
of the National Abortion Federation said the bubble zones are necessary to prevent "violence
like John Salvi's." 
<BR><B>...The ruling under review involves a "floating" 15-foot zone imposed to protect Buffalo and
Rochester, N.Y., clinics</B>. Under a court order, protesters must stay at least 15 feet away from

Second Baptist distributed materials that directed members to vote for specific slates of

<B>Canada: A Salvation Army preacher was charged with one count of arson and one count of
public mischief after he allegedly set fire to himself at his Newfoundland church</B>. Lee
Goulding said a stranger threw gasoline on him and set him on fire, but the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police said Goulding did it himself. No motive was given, news reports said.
Salvation Army Col. Howard Moore said Goulding has been suspended but will receive
counseling if he requests it. 
<P>
<B>Barrington, R</B>. I., won't collect trash at churches any more, news reports said. The town
ended the weekly pickups after the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit on
behalf of several residents who claimed that providing such taxpayer-funded services violates
the Constitution. Discontinuing snow plowing at the churches also is being debated.

<B>A Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 66% of Americans, including 67% of
Catholics and 62% of evangelicals, favor giving clean needles to IV drug abusers</B>. Also, 71%
of Americans, including 76% of Catholics and 62% of evangelicals, want network TV to
carry condom ads. Ninety-five percent of Americans, including 95% of Catholics and 92% of
evangelicals, believe that high schools should teach students about AIDS, the survey of 1,511

<P>
<B>Atheists got a permit to hold an Easter sunrise gathering around the 40-foot Mount Soledad
cross (NIRR 4/5/93) on city park land in San Diego, Calif., news reports said</B>. The
Department of Parks and Recreation issues the permits on a first-come, first-served basis, and
"Christians didn't know they were in a race" to get one, said Edward Starkey, president of the
Ecumenical Council of San Diego County. Christians have held a service there every Easter,
but will stay away this year to avoid a confrontation. Churches are regarding the atheists'
ceremony as "a sad little event," Starkey said. Peter Irons, a University of California professor
who applied for the permit, said the point is to "open up [the service] to everybody, not just
Christians." 
<P>
<B>Oregon Gov</B>. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat, declared April to be Christian Heritage Month in
the state. Various activities are planned, including a rally on the Capitol steps in Salem April
1 and appearances by historian and lecturer Peter Marshall. Event organizers said they hope to
"share our rich Christian history with people who may not be aware of the impact Christianity
has had" on the formation of the nation. For information, call (503) 295-8073.

<B>NavPress Publishing Group eliminated 12 staff jobs, including four sales positions, which it
will fill with contract workers</B>. The Colorado Springs-based book publisher also will publish
fewer books, concentrating on those that stimulate spiritual formation among readers,
according to spokesperson Joanne Heim. The growth of bookstore chains and decline of
independent stores is changing the market drastically, Heim said. 
<P>
<B>Muslims are active in publishing in the United States</B>. Kazi Publications, the largest American
Muslim publisher and book distributor, began in 1972 by producing books for Muslim
immigrant children, Publishers Weekly Religion Bookline said. Chicago-based Kazi
distributes 2,000 Islamic titles, all in English. People are "trying to understand their Muslim
neighbor," said Kazi's Laleh Bakhtiar.

<B>Creationism will be taught in Hall County, Ga., schools as early as this fall, the county school
board voted</B>. Members said the course will avoid references to the Bible, God, and angels. It
will offer an explanation as to how materials such as carbon, oxygen, and water came to
exist, board member Doug Calvert said. ACLU officials in Georgia said the proposal is
unconstitutional and will be challenged.
<P>
<B>Florida's Supreme Court refused to change its view that a fetus cannot be considered a person
under the state's wrongful-death law, news reports said</B>. The March 14 ruling barred
Gwendolyn Golden Young from suing St. Vincent's Medical Center of Jacksonville over the
death of her fetus in 1989. Young was eight months pregnant with twins when she underwent
amniocentesis. She alleged that one fetus died when a doctor accidentally punctured it with a
needle. Florida is among seven states that prohibit wrongful-death lawsuits for the loss of a
fetus through negligence.

<B>Four San Francisco Bay churches have been expelled from a regional American Baptist
Church association because they welcome practicing homosexuals into their congregations
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/021996.html">NIRR 2/19</A>)</B>. The churches belong to the Welcoming and Affirming Baptist Churches, an
association of congregations that adopt similar policies regarding homosexuals. The
congregations plan to appeal their expulsion to the national denomination.

the village of Pabbo, north of Kampala, and 130 died when the group ambushed a convoy
earlier in the month. Since 1987, the LRA has waged war to overthrow the government and
establish a theocracy based on the Ten Commandments.

unemployment rate reached record highs last year. Menem, a Catholic who converted from
Islam, called the bishops hypocrites and fools. The Church has been criticized for not
speaking against the human-rights abuses of past regimes (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/041795.html">NIRR 4/17/95</A>).

drugs, Baptist Press said.

more than a year because officials refused building permits and threatened to confiscate the
land (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/080795.html">NIRR 8/7/95</A>)</B>. A Sofia paper quoted a government agency accusing "non-traditional

<B>A group of church leaders in China is trying to preach the gospel
all the way back to Jerusalem</B>. "It is a common goal, a loud and
clear proclamation," David Wang of Asian Outreach told NIRR.
He met with 42 leaders of a charismatic house-church
movement, representing 21 million believers in 11 provinces.
<BR><B>...No one is sure where the idea originated</B>. Short-term
missionary Neil Johnson said Chinese believers see it as their
mission to "complete the circle" of the gospel's westward spread
around the globe. "They feel it's their job to take the gospel
back to where it started." 
<BR><B>...China has a special place in last-days theology, according to
Sid Roth of Messianic Vision, a ministry to Chinese Jews (NIRR
12/11/95)</B>. A prophetic passage in Isaiah 49:12 refers to Jews
returning to Israel from the land of Sinim, which is China, Roth
contends. The country once had a thriving Jewish community
centered in the ancient city of Kaifeng, which had a population
of 20,000 Jews and was known as the Jerusalem of China, Roth
said.
<BR><B>...Chinese church planters are setting up "stepping-stone"
churches in countries along the ancient Silk Road trade route,
Wang said</B>. Two missionary teams have been sent to Tajikistan
and Uzbekistan. "They are the pioneers, the vanguard" in
planting churches along the path back to Jerusalem, he said. The
missionaries probably are ministering to the large numbers of
Chinese expatriates in those countries, said Ronald Yu of the
U.S. Center for World Mission.
<BR><B>...A Korean missionary is planning a prayer walk along the Silk
Road from Beijing to Jerusalem that will have 24 marchers, two
for each tribe of Israel</B>. Asian missionaries to China will make
the journey, but no Chinese will go because they would not be
issued passports, Johnson said. The walk's goal is to "open
spiritual doors" for Jews to return to Jerusalem.
<BR><B>...The walkers also will pray against "spiritual strongholds" in
cities they travel through and make contacts with underground
Christian leaders for future church-planting missions</B>. They will
travel by bus, boat, and foot from Beijing, to Xian, Lanzhou,
Urumqi, and the Asian republics. They will go from Kazakhstan,
to Uzbekistan, back through Kazakhstan, then across the Caspian
Sea to Azerbaijan, into Armenia, through Ankara, and to the
Turkish port of Mersin, where they will sail to Israel. The whole
prayer-walk journey should take three to four weeks, Johnson
said.
<BR><B>...Chinese Christians had tried to make the trip earlier this
century but failed, Johnson said</B>. In the 1930s, indigenous
missionaries trained by Hudson Taylor's China Inland Mission
planted churches from southeastern China to the far western
reaches of the country. They intended to press through into the
neighboring countries, but many died from the harshness of the
trip. Some who remember the mission trip still live in Urumqi.
"When they heard of what we have planned, they wept," Johnson
said. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>Christians in Japan have "a real hunger and thirst for the Holy
Spirit," Toronto pastor John Arnott said after his visit there this
month</B>. Harvest Fellowship, a Pentecostal/charismatic group,
invited Arnott to hold a series of meetings on the Toronto
Blessing, which began at his Toronto Airport Christian
Fellowship church in 1994 and has since spread around the
world (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/122595.html">NIRR 12/25/95</A>). Arnott said he did not expect such
powerful meetings in the largely Shinto-Buddhist country.
Instead, "I was amazed at how receptive the Japanese are" to the
Holy Spirit, he said. "They are so easy to minister to and God is
powerfully touching them." About 3,400 attended the five
meetings, and about twice that many were turned away because
the meeting hall would not hold them, Japanese Christian

<B>A Guatemalan church supports itself by running a coffee
plantation</B>. The pastor oversees the operation in Lampocoy a rich
coffee-growing region. The effort employs eight people and
brought in $300 last year. The church, located nearby, was
begun in 1989 by York, Pa.-based People for Missions, which
also raised money to buy the plantation. "It dawned on me that
this would be a great way to make the church self-supporting,
rather than dependent on income from the United States," People
for Missions' Colin Fullilove said. The ministry has planted 13
churches among hard-to-reach groups in the country's
mountainous regions since 1989. 
<BR><B>...Mission Coffee is sold in the United States, last year bringing
in $7,000, Fullilove told NIRR</B>. The gourmet coffee is sold in
specialty stores and Christian bookstores and by Christian school
students for fund-raisers. All proceeds from U.S. sales go to The
House of Hope, an orphanage the ministry is constructing in
Tapaca. It will be the largest orphanage in Guatemala, housing
up to 144 children in 12 houses on the 22-acre property. NIRR

<B>Grassroots peacemaking efforts may be the way to stop the civil
war in Sudan, Christians in the southern part of the country say</B>.
The 10-year war has created a volatile atmosphere among
villages, which often leads to violence. Church members are
trying to stop the trend by acting as "peace scouts" to mediate
conflicts between villages. The Christians hear complaints,
confront wrongdoers, and act as bridges between warring
villages, according to the Mennonite Brethren Herald.               
<BR><B>..."Later we will go to the [rebel] faction leaders" who have
fought among themselves, causing civilian casualties, said Peter
Lual of the Akobo Presbyterian Church</B>. Ultimately, the
Christians hope to play a role in seeking peace between the
north's Islamic forces and the south's Christian army, the
publication said. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>One thousand eighty-four people made first-time professions of
faith in Christ during Easter services at Saddleback Church in
Lake Forest, Calif</B>. Pastor Rick Warren preached at seven
services -- three on Saturday and four on Sunday -- and a youth
pastor preached a sunrise service. Some 104 out-of-town
relatives invited by their families made decisions to become
Christians, Warren told NIRR. Hundreds of others rededicated
their lives to Christ or decided to join the church or be baptized.
Attendance totaled 21,988.
<BR><B>...Warren's sermons described Jesus' trial, crucifixion, and
resurrection</B>. "Jesus is still on trial in the minds of many of you,"
he told the audience, saying he was turning the auditorium into a
courtroom, impaneling them as jurors and calling witnesses.
"And then you must come to a verdict."
<BR><B>...Saddleback members invited an estimated 8,500 non-Christians
to the services</B>. Warren had told congregation members not to
attend on Easter unless they brought at least one unchurched
person. It was Saddleback's first Easter in its own building,
which was recently constructed on a 74-acre campus. The church
was founded on Easter in 1980 and had used 89 different
facilities in five cities, including schools, country clubs,
warehouses, tents, and mental hospitals (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/101695.html">NIRR 10/16/95</A>). 
<BR><B>...Saddleback is a Southern Baptist church, although it dropped
the denominational label from its name several years ago</B>. Those
making decisions to become a Christian during the services do
not leave their seats and come to the altar, but instead turn in
cards indicating their decision. Baptism is considered the public
acknowledgment of a new believer's faith. Warren baptized
1,365 people in 1995, when the SBC named Saddleback its
church of the year. The congregation has grown in 16 years from
one family of seven members to nearly 12,000 attendees, making
it the fastest-growing SBC church in American history.
<BR><B>...The church is growing primarily by adding new Christians, not
by luring members from other congregations, Warren said</B>. Some
81% of the people who joined Saddleback in 1995 did so by
being baptized. Most people in the congregation are relatively
new believers: Warren baptized more than 75% of the current
members himself. They often are active in witnessing because
"they aren't afraid of nonbelievers." Generally, the longer a
believer has been a Christian, the fewer non-Christian friends he
or she has and "the less they think like an unbeliever," Warren
said. 
<BR><B>...Saddleback focuses on five basics -- what it describes as
getting warmer through fellowship, deeper through discipleship,
stronger through worship, broader through ministry, and larger
through evangelism</B>. Its statement of purpose balances those
areas so that no one thrust outweighs the others. The statement
calls for results that can be measured and evaluated, and Warren
leads a two-hour meeting each month to do so. Sunday-morning
services and a Wednesday-night class for new believers are
meant to be sensitive to the concerns of those who are seeking
God, and only contemporary music is played. "When God wants
[to nurture] baby Christians, he looks for the warmest incubator
He can find," said Warren, describing the seeker-sensitive model
the church follows. Warren leads new believers along a clearly
defined track of maturing through discipleship and training, and
commissioning for evangelism, he said. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>More than 750 New Englanders, many of them unchurched,
became Christians during a Christian film festival</B>. The annual
Merrimack Valley festival (NIRR 5/3/93), now in its fourth year,
was held free of charge March 31-April 7 at a Salem, N.H.,
cinema. Ten movies, rotated continuously, were shown from 11
a.m. to 9 p.m. They included features for adults, films for youth
and teenagers, and the Jesus film, which also was shown four
times in Spanish.
<BR><B>..."I have never seen so many people weeping" as during the
invitations given at the front of the stage after each show, said
organizer Thomas Saab</B>. He started the festival in 1993 and takes
off about three months from his Methuen, Mass., real estate
agency to plan each year's events. Attendance has dropped
somewhat over the years, but the number of professions of faith
has increased, he told NIRR. Saab gives some of the invitations,
during which he doesn't "pull any punches." He tells those who
come forward that they must "stop living the way of the world."
Saab tries to make sure that those who come forward understand
the seriousness of their decision, and urges people to return to
their seats if they are not ready to make a commitment to Christ.
<BR><B>...A group of Massachusetts junior-high public school students
came to the festival, and 45 came forward for salvation, Saab
said</B>. In another instance, a man became a Christian when his car
broke down near the cinema and he wandered in to watch a film;
the next day, he brought his wife, who became a Christian. The
leader of a Laotian youth gang also came forward.
<BR><B>...The new believers were referred to one of 80 churches where
"the gospel is preached," Saab said</B>. Nearly 2,000 people have
become Christians during the festival's four years, and many
others have come forward to rededicate their lives to Christ, as
some 300 did this year, Saab said. A total of 8,600 people
watched the movies this year. The 300 volunteers who help plan
the festival say the sacrifice of time, money, and effort is well
worth the effort, Saab said. "Nobody has been able to tell me
that there is anything more important than reaching the lost for
Christ." NIRR 4/29/96

<B>A year after a bomb shattered the Alfred P</B>. Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City, Christian relief groups are among
those still at work (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/050195.html">NIRR 5/1/95</A>). The Salvation Army, Feed the
Children, Catholic Charities, and a coalition of area churches
called Interfaith Disaster Recovery continue to collaborate with
the American Red Cross to minister to people's physical,
emotional, and spiritual needs. The April 19 tragedy killed 168
people and injured more than 600.
<BR><B>...The Salvation Army, which sprang into action minutes after
the blast, has five full-time staff members and many volunteers
who are helping some 800 families affected by the tragedy</B>. One
victim, Nancy Fulmer, is receiving material aid as well as
counseling for "my continuing nightmares of the horrors I saw."
Fulmer, a nurse, was hit by falling debris as she worked at the
site. She is confined to a wheelchair and unable to work.
<BR><B>...The anniversary was traumatic for many of the survivors, their
families, and rescue workers</B>. It is "almost like going through it
again" for some people, Salvation Army Maj. Marshall Gesner
told NIRR. Reliving the experience may help in the long run, but
"in the short run it is very difficult," said Gesner, who helps
coordinate the efforts of relief agencies. Memorial anniversary
services were held at the site and the Myriad Convention Center.
The Army provided a free retreat at a recreational camp for
survivors and their families March 26-28. Various forms of
assistance for people will be needed for at least another year,
Gesner said. The Army has committed $3.5 million for
long-term projects such as helping downtown businesses rebuild
after major structural damage. 
<BR><B>...Meanwhile, militia proponents, conspiracy theorists, and
anti-government groups held a three-day convention in Waco,
Texas, to remember the deaths of David Koresh and his
followers</B>. The Branch Davidians, including 21 children, died in
a fire April 19, 1993 (NIRR 5/3/93). Voice of Liberty, a
Kentucky-based group that said it has a radio program that deals
with political issues and Christianity, organized the event.
<BR><B>...Koresh is considered to be a "latter-day Messiah," said Clive
Doyle, one of nine survivors of the fire and the unofficial leader
of three dozen Branch Davidians still in the Waco area</B>.
Authorities say the fire is one of the events that enraged and
motivated Oklahoma City bombing suspect Timothy McVeigh,

<B>United Methodists have decided that people should become full
members when they are baptized rather than waiting until they
are old enough to publicly profess their faith, usually about age
12</B>. The nearly 1,000 delegates to the denomination's General
Conference unanimously agreed to the policy change during their
meeting in Denver this month. The conference is the governing
body of the 8.6 million-member UMC, the nation's
second-largest Protestant denomination, and sets the church's
direction for the next four years (NIRR 6/1/92). 
<BR><B>...The new policy moves the UMC closer to its theological roots</B>.
John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, taught that in infant
baptism, a child is cleansed of original sin, initiated into a
covenant with God, and admitted into the church. The policy
also moves the UMC closer to Lutheran, Episcopal, and Catholic
churches and away from evangelical churches that require
individuals to make their own decisions to join the church.
<BR><B>...Delegates also voted to adopt a "covenanting proposal" of the
Consultation On Church Union (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/112795.html">NIRR 11/27/95</A>)</B>. With the
661-288 vote, the UMC becomes the sixth denomination to
approve COCU. The ecumenical document promotes closer ties
among mainline Protestant members including Methodists,
Presbyterians, and United Church of Christ members.
<BR><B>...Fifteen UMC bishops called on the denomination to allow
ordination of homosexuals to the ministry</B>. But they also pledged
not to ordain homosexuals unless the church law that declares
active homosexuality "incompatible with Christian teaching" is
changed. The current law bars self-avowed, practicing
homosexuals from the ranks of the clergy. The UMC's council
of bishops reaffirmed the church's traditional principles, but did
not denounce the bishops' protest, news reports said. 
<BR><B>...The UMC also voted 767-45 to explore unifying with
predominantly black Methodist denominations</B>. The Commission
of Pan-Methodist Union will formulate a plan with the
3.5-million member African Methodist Episcopal Church, the
1.2-million member African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church,
and the 720,000-member Christian Methodist Episcopal Church.
The plans will be submitted at the general conferences of three
of the churches in 2000 and at the CME conference in 2002.
"The time is right for us to openly confess sins of our past and
to realize these brothers and sisters belong in one church," UMC
Bishop Melvin Talbert said. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>Methodist leaders in England are seeking solutions to the
church's membership decline</B>. From 1992-1995 membership
dropped from 408,107 to 380,195, or 6.8%, and attendance at
services decreased 9.6%, Ecumenical News Service said.
Attendance by those under age 26 dropped by 19%. Out of 6,678
churches, 272 closed in the three-year span. The church is
surveying former members to determine their reasons for
leaving. The Methodist Church, the third-largest in England, is
discussing unifying with the largest, the Church of England.
<BR><B>...Even though overall membership is down, about 25% of
churches showed an increase</B>. The growing churches, which are
located in all areas of the country and have a variety of worship
styles, reportedly emphasize worship and have an ability to adapt
to meet members' needs, news reports said. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>St</B>. Matthew may have seen Jesus in person rather than
constructed an account of His actions much later, according to
German scholar Carsten Peter Thiede. He believes that three
fragments of papyruses containing snippets from Matthew 26 in
Greek, housed for more than 90 years at Oxford University, date
from 66 A.D. or earlier.
<BR><B>...His theory startled biblical scholars who have assumed that the
ragged-edged papyruses, known as the Magdalen Papyrus, were
written in the mid to late-2nd century</B>. Handwriting on the
fragments is in a style known as uncial, which began to die out
in the middle of the 1st century, Thiede said. The fragments are
from a codex, in which writing is found on both sides of the
papyrus. Contrary to the views of most biblical scholars, Thiede
says, codices were widely used by 1st-century Christians. Thiede
has published his arguments in the recent book Eyewitness to
Jesus (Doubleday). NIRR 4/29/96

<B>Landlords can't use their religious beliefs as a reason not to rent
to unmarried couples, the California Supreme Court ruled</B>. The
case involved Chico landlady Evelyn Smith, a Presbyterian, who
refused to rent to unmarried couples out of fear that God would
judge her (NIRR 9/25/89). In 1987, she refused to rent to Gail
Randall and Kenneth Phillips. The couple filed a complaint with
the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing. It ruled
that Smith violated California's open-housing law prohibiting
landlords from asking prospective tenants their marital status. A
state appeals court overturned the ruling, finding that the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act supersedes state
open-housing laws.
<BR><B>...But in its ruling, the California Supreme Court said the state's
ban on housing discrimination based on marital status did not
create a "substantial burden" on the property owner's freedom of
religion, news reports said</B>. The court also found that Smith
could get out of the rental business if her morals did not enable
her to comply with state law. Smith said the ruling will not deter
her from refusing to rent to unmarried couples. "I'm going to do
it my way because it's the Lord's way," she said. Her attorney,
Jordan Lorence, said he would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to
review the issue, which has divided state courts around the
country. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>Dramatizing the entire Bible on videotape is the goal of Cape

Matthew and Acts are the first in the series, The Visual Bible.
By 2010, the company hopes to create word-for-word dramatic
reproductions of all 66 books, news reports said. The series is
designed for a video generation that would rather watch a story
than read it, executive David Seibert said. "It's kind of like
Gutenberg when he came out with the Bible in print. This is a
new generation where we have it on video." Actors such as
Richard Kiley, Dean Jones, Jennifer O'Neill, and James Brolin
appear in the four-hour films Matthew and Acts. Producers
started with those books because the stories are easy to tell on

<B>Macedonian evangelicals are fighting for religious freedom</B>. The
country is a democracy, but laws restricting religious freedom
still exist from its communist era. Protestant and Orthodox
churches can't register with the government, which prevents
them from legally renting buildings or employing ministers or
priests. Since the clergy are not officially employed, they cannot
receive government-supplied health and retirement benefits,
Macedonian believers told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...Sometimes laws are enforced selectively against evangelicals
by officials sympathetic to the Orthodox Church</B>. The
evangelicals are denied outside humanitarian aid, can't import
Bibles, and have had their evangelistic meetings closed (NIRR

guaranteeing religious freedom, but it hasn't been enacted. They

<B>"I do not hate people because their skin is white," Nation of
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan told followers April 15</B>. "What I
hate is evil and injustice and exploitation, whether a black does
it, whether a white does it, whether a Jew, a Muslim, or a
Christian does it." During a two-hour speech to followers at his
Chicago mosque, he said he is willing to speak in a synagogue
"because I do not want Jewish children to believe that they have
somebody who, if he comes into great power, will put them in
ovens," referring to the Holocaust.
<BR><B>...Farrakhan has made similar overtures before</B>. Several Jewish
leaders said Farrakhan has refused their requests to soften his
rhetoric and retract past offensive statements, including
comments that Jews are "bloodsuckers." When national attention
focuses on Farrakhan, he tries to put on some facade of good
will, but "that is so transparently false that it cannot be
accepted," said Phil Baum, executive director of the American
Jewish Congress.
<BR><B>...Farrakhan told followers that he went to Iraq, Iran, and Libya
"so America could not isolate us," news reports said</B>. He told
CBS' 60 Minutes that the U.S. government is trying to "muzzle"
him, and rejected the idea of registering as a foreign agent. U.S.
officials repeatedly have criticized Farrakhan's travels to the
nations and are looking into possible violations of federal law
during the tour (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/021996.html">NIRR 2/19</A>). 
<BR><B>...Farrakhan also claims he may be part Jewish</B>. In an interview
in the New Yorker, he said he thinks his father's ancestors were
Portuguese Jews. He was born Louis Eugene Walcott, the son of
immigrants from Barbados and Jamaica, and his father was
light-skinned and had straight hair. Farrakhan's mother told him
that his father's father was a white Portuguese. Harvard

persons of Iberian origin in Barbados and Jamaica are of
Sephardic Jewish ancestry. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>The evangelical church is slipping into heresy, a group of 80
Baptist, Congregational, Lutheran, and Reformed theologians,
pastors, and parachurch leaders warned</B>. Many Protestants, once
anchored by Reformation principles, now are adrift in error,
according to their statement, The Cambridge Declaration.
Delegates signed the document April 20 in Cambridge, Mass.,
during a four-day meeting hosted by The Alliance of Confessing
Evangelicals (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/040196.html">NIRR 4/1</A>). "As evangelicals, we call ourselves to
repent of this sin," the statement reads. 
<BR><B>...Evangelicals must "recover the historic Christian faith," the
declaration says</B>. Its signers asserted that Scripture is the
sufficient authority for church life, that faith alone in Christ
saves people, and that God's grace is freely given, not earned.
Many evangelicals assent to Reformation principles but have not
practiced them, substituting techniques that excite people but
blur the gospel message, the signers said. It's not hard to gather
a crowd if you're running a circus, "but we've run a circus and
still lost the crowd," said W. Robert Godfrey, president of
Westminster Theological Seminary in Escondido, Calif.
<BR><B>...One repercussion is that the church is weakening, the signers
said</B>. "Earlier in this century, evangelical churches sustained a
remarkable missionary endeavor and built many religious
institutions to serve the cause of biblical truth and Christ's
kingdom," their statement says. But today, the evangelical world
is losing its "missionary zeal," it adds.
<BR><B>...Evangelicalism has turned into a "fearful and cowardly
church," said Robert Norris, senior pastor of Fourth Presbyterian
Church in Bethesda, Md</B>. "At the very moment when the culture
is so vulnerable, the evangelical church is losing its nerve," said
David Wells, a professor at Gordon-Conwell Theological
Seminary in South Hamilton, Mass. 
<BR><B>...Another consequence is that evangelical unity is vanishing, the
leaders said</B>. Beliefs that once formed "a bond of unity between
Christians from a wide diversity of church traditions" are no
longer commonly held, the declaration stated. "We face the peril
of losing the unity it has taken centuries to achieve," it added.
But the signers said they could not join with those who accede
to what they consider aberrant doctrine. The word evangelical
has "died the death of a thousand qualifications," author R. C.
Sproul told NIRR. "It has become so inclusive as to be in danger
of being totally empty."
<BR><B>...Rather than confronting the hard truths of Scripture, some
churches apply "therapeutic technique," signers said</B>. Yet
Scripture "must take us beyond our perceived needs to our real
needs." Often, Christians do not reason thoroughly, instead
allowing their hearts to guide their conduct, speakers said. Yet
"my heart is the problem. My heart has committed sins that my
hands haven't gotten around to yet," according to Michael
Horton, president of Christians United for Reformation.
<BR><B>...Trends in the church amount to "the dumbing-down of
Christianity," said David Scaer, professor at Concordia
Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Ind</B>. Christian apologist
Ravi Zacharias, who often speaks on secular college campuses,
said that many students he meets don't know how to think
clearly, making them gullible to lies.
<BR><B>...Although "angry and inconclusive discourse is today's style,"
Christians must speak with civility and act with love, said Ervin
Duggan, a Christian layman who is president and chief executive
officer of the Public Broadcasting Service</B>. Christians must not
be "coercive or arrogant," he said. "Could it be that our attitude
provides a barrier that makes outreach very unlikely?" asked
former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. Evangelicals should
develop a "new collegial rapport with academia," an approach
that is "winsome," not confrontational. 
<BR><B>...The future of evangelicalism and Western culture remain
unclear, participants said</B>. "Civilizations do die, and they are
overcome," Wells said. It is possible that "our fabric has so
rotted" that society will disintegrate, he said. Relativism "must
give way to nihilism," said R. Albert Mohler, Jr., president of
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky. Yet,
Koop said, Christians should not despair. "God is sovereign."

<P>
<B>For the first time, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter Day Saints ordained a president not descended from
Mormon leader Joseph Smith</B>. W. Grant McMurray, 48, was
ordained April 15 as the 245,000-member church's
president-prophet. Wallace B. Smith designated McMurray as his
successor to broaden the base of potential church leaders. The
RLDS, a 136-year-old church based in Independence, Mo., is the
second-largest of dozens of Mormon groups that trace their
identity to Joseph Smith, Jr. McMurray's selection was seen as
an attempt by RLDS leaders to move toward mainstream
Protestantism. 
<P>
<B>Dallas televangelist W.V</B>. Grant, Jr., admitted filing a false
income tax return for 1990, news reports said (NIRR 12/16/91).
U.S. Attorney Paul Coggins said Grant, pastor of The Church of
Compassion, formerly known as Eagle's Nest Family Church,
pleaded guilty to one count of willfully filing a false tax return.
His wife, Brenda, pleaded guilty to knowing about the crime and
not reporting it. Sentencing is set for June 24.
<BR><B>...The charges stem from Grant's use of $75,000 from church
operations to pay for his personal residence and another
investment property, and his failure to report it as income on his
1990 tax return, Coggins said</B>. "We're not saying he was
embezzling from the church. He's being prosecuted for not
paying his taxes," said Assistant U.S. Attorney Phillip Umphres.
In addition, the Grants agreed to pay $353,000 in back taxes,
interest, and penalties that were not part of the criminal case
against them. Grant has said he "ceded" the church's 28-acre site
and broadcast and print facilities to West Virginia evangelist
Bishop T.D. Jakes, news reports said. 
<P>
<B>Timothy Leary, 75, may be planning a public suicide on the
Internet, news reports said</B>. The former Harvard professor who
advised 1960s students to take LSD, is dying of prostate cancer.
Leary, who lives in Beverly Hills, Calif., has been "actively
exploring" the idea. "I told him, `Tim, this is your best act so
far,'" said Ken Kesey, the '60s author and friend of Leary. "He
said, `Yeah, but what do I do for an encore?'"
<BR><B>...Leary has been promoting "hi-tech designer dying" on his
Home Page on the World Wide Web</B>. Even though 10 million
Americans use the Internet, many are getting on the World Wide
Web through on-line services that do not have the tools to watch
Leary's video.
<P>
<B>Gloria Feldt, a 53-year-old mother of six and grandmother of
eight, was named president of the Planned Parenthood Federation
of America</B>. The group has 152 affiliates with 1,000 clinics that
perform 130,000 abortions a year, about 10% of the national
total. Feldt was married at 15 and had three children by the age
of 20. She called on the group to renew its fight for abortion
rights and social programs so women will have more choices
than she had as a teen-ager.
<P>
<B>Diana Garland, former dean of the Carver School of Church
Social Work at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in
Louisville, Ky., resigned from the seminary's faculty, saying the
school can no longer offer quality instruction in social work</B>.
SBTS President R. Albert Mohler, Jr., removed Garland, 45,
from her post as dean in March 1995 after she disagreed with
him about the hiring of a prospective faculty member, David
Sherwood of Gordon College, who supported women's
ordination. Garland had criticized Mohler, who opposes women
serving as senior ministers, for evaluating faculty using
"absolutely restrictive" criteria. Trustees have voted to close the
Carver School in May 1997 and transfer it to Campbellsville
College, a Kentucky Baptist Convention-supported school. 
<P>
<B>The board of directors of Seattle Pacific University recently
named Philip Eaton as president, replacing Arthur Self</B>. Eaton
had served as the school's vice president of academic affairs and
also as its provost. The school is affiliated with the Free
Methodist Church of North America, headquartered in
Indianapolis.
<P>
<B>Christians always will be regarded as "fools for Christ" in
modern society, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said in a
rare glimpse of his private views</B>. "We must pray for courage to
endure the scorn of the sophisticated world," the conservative
jurist told students at the Mississippi College School of Law, a
Baptist school. In his rulings, Scalia, a Catholic, generally favors
greater accommodation of religion in public life. 
<P>
<B>Jack Wyrtzen, who founded Word of Life and directed if for 50
years, died April 16 at age 82</B>. Wyrtzen started preaching on a
weekly radio show in the late 1930s and created Word of Life in
1942. The group, based at Schroon Lake in upstate New York,
broadcasts Christian programs on television and radio, has a
Bible college, and runs camps for various ages throughout the
United States. Word of Life is active in 32 countries.

<B>Canada: A sports ministry takes the gospel to teens who might
never set foot in a church, Youth With A Mission said</B>. Sports
Trax runs camps and clinics that "present biblical truths in a
relevant way," director Keith Gerber said. The ministry has held
assemblies at 11 high schools and will run summer camps for
more than 200 teens this year, YWAM said.
<P>
<B>Canada: Legislators are pressuring Prime Minister Jean Chretien
to keep his promise to end discrimination against homosexuals</B>.
Bills in Parliament advocate extending equal rights to gays and
lesbians. Evangelical Fellowship of Canada director Bruce
Clemenger warned a Senate committee that the bill could blur
the traditional definition of a family.
<P>
<B>A church that handed out $17,580 in $10 bills to members
received a big return on its investment</B>. Calvary Church in
Charlotte, N.C., called on its congregants to follow Christ's
admonition in Luke 19 to multiply resources. Members spent
several weeks creatively investing the money and returned
$69,043, a net gain of $51,463, news reports said. A 14-year-old
boy turned his $10 into $80 by selling candy bars at school, a
woman used her family's four $10 bills to make aprons, selling
them for $250, and a 38-member Sunday school class pooled its
money to make tapes featuring the church's soloists, selling them
for almost $2,000. The money will reduce the church's $14.6
million debt (NIRR 1/1/90).
<P>
<B>Baylor students danced on campus after a 151-year ban (NIRR
2/19)</B>. University President Robert Sloan, Jr., and his wife, Sue,
took one of the first dances, swaying to Beethoven's Minuet in
G. The Haskett-Burleson Big Band, co-led by Ed Burleson, great
grandson of Rufus Burleson, Baylor president during the 1800s,
then broke into Glenn Miller's In the Mood. Other bands
performed country, rock 'n' roll, and rhythm and blues.
Thousands of people turned out for the event. A poll last fall
showed that 94% of Baylor students approved lifting the campus
dancing ban. 
<P>
<B>The first sermon in outer space will be preached by tape to
American astronaut Shannon Lucid and the Russian crew of the
space station Mir</B>. Lucid's father asked Fort Worth, Texas,
Baptist pastor Raymond Barber to preach the message, which
will arrive in six weeks via space craft. Barber's church has
distributed 100,000 Bibles in Russia. 
<P>
<B>About 60 Episcopalians marched past the National Cathedral in
Washington, D.C., April 6</B>. They were protesting visits by Jane
Holmes Dixon to churches in Bladensburg, Md., and Washington
this winter. Washington Episcopal Bishop Ronald Haines sent
Dixon, one of six female assistant Episcopal bishops in the
United States, to preside at services over the objections of
rectors and parishioners who opposed her consecration. News
reports said Haines is pushing the issue of women's ordination
in an attempt to unite the diocese around the Episcopal Church's
acceptance of women priests.
<P>
<B>President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion ban (NIRR
3/18) moves the United States "one step closer to infanticide,"
the country's eight Catholic cardinals and the leader of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops said</B>. Richard Land of
the Southern Baptist's Christian Life Commission questioned the
president's assertion that he vetoed the bill because it failed to
protect women's health. He quoted testimony by Pamela Smith,
director of medical education for the Department of Obstetrics
and Gynecology at Chicago's Mount Sinai Hospital, that
"absolutely no obstetrical situations" in this country require a
partially delivered fetus to be killed to preserve the health of the
mother.  
<P>
<B>Hands for Christ donates Christian libraries to churches around
the world</B>. Each month, the ministry ships thousands of books,
audiotapes, videotapes, and tracts on Christian teaching. Some
8,500 churches and prisons in 93 countries have received the
materials in 28 years. The Roanoke, Va.-based ministry has sent
2,000 libraries to churches in the Commonwealth of Independent
States since 1994. For each library, Hands for Christ paid for the
printing of about 100 Russian-translated books by Christian
leaders such as Billy Graham, Josh McDowell, and Bill Bright.
U.S. churches, individuals, Christian publishers, and ministries
donate many of the materials. Topics range from Christian
classics to contemporary issues in Christian life, HFC founder
Bob Bowers said. 
<P>
<B>More than 100 prisoners a month are becoming Christians at
Jackson County Detention Center in Kansas City, Mo., news
reports said</B>. Chaplain James Collier, who became a Christian
while incarcerated, has formed Ex-Offenders Fellowship to help
establish former prisoners in churches, jobs, and community life.
The group gathers during monthly fellowship meetings.
<P>
<B>Global evangelization plans fail because of poor planning and
leadership, and "empire building," according to the Global
Evangelization Movement</B>. GEM President David Barrett and
James Reapsome of World Pulse newsletter researched and
evaluated such plans implemented since AD 30 for their book,
700 Global Plans to Evangelize the World, GEM's Justin Long
told NIRR. A critical failing has been lack of cooperation and
communication among leaders. Some 14 denominations and
church movements declared global evangelism goals in 1990, yet
most did not network with others, Long said. But the AD 2000
and Beyond Movement, Campus Crusade's Jesus Film Project,
and Every Home for Christ have set examples of how to work
together, he said.

according to Discipling A Whole Nation.

<B>South Africa: Hundreds of Muslims attended the conference
"Creating a New Civilization of Islam," news reports said</B>.
Discussion centered on starting a political body to lobby for

<B>South Africa: A segregated church was united in April</B>. The
Apostolic Faith Mission was founded by American missionaries
in 1908 but soon split along racial lines. The white congregation

<P>
<B>Indonesia: The Far East Broadcasting Company began gospel
transmissions this month to the islands of Sulawesi and
Kalimantan, formerly known as Borneo</B>. The Gorontalo and
Banjar people on the islands have no known churches, Bibles, or
Christian literature, and the country has the world's highest
concentration of Muslims, the ministry said. FEBC broadcasts to
Indonesia in 10 languages. 
<P>
<B>Saudi Arabia: Muslims from Nigeria, Mali, Niger, and Burkina
Faso will not be allowed to make the hajj, the annual pilgrimage
to Mecca, for health reasons, officials said</B>. More than 95% of
meningitis cases in Africa this year occurred in those countries,
according to the World Health Organization. Saudi health
officials took the precaution to protect the more than 2 million
Muslims converging on Mecca this month.

allows outcast children to attend classes and play with others.
Since the house opened in 1993, nine children have died
"peacefully in the arms of family or staff," according to Youth
With A Mission, which runs the house. A growing number of
the country's 6 million children are HIV-positive, YWAM said.
<P>
<B>Mexico: Monterrey city officials blocked construction of the
country's second Mormon temple</B>. They denied being influenced
by Catholic petitions and newspaper ads protesting the
construction, saying the temple would have violated development
laws. There are 735,000 Mormons in Mexico, including 200,000
in Monterrey, news reports said.

Latin American ministry (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/021996.html">NIRR 2/19</A>)</B>. Dozens of Christians,
including many pastors, are running for national and local
offices. Three political parties have a Christian orientation.
International ministries are offering guidance to help the
politicians avoid church divisions, the group said.

<P>
<B>Germany: More than half the residents of the former East
Germany say they are completely non-religious, according to

church membership declined steadily in the subsequent decades.
All religions "appear suspect and esoteric" to them, a German
sociology professor said.

miracles ascribed to candidates for sainthood. The Vatican "has
become a saint factory," Oddi said. John Paul II has canonized
or beatified almost 1,000 people, more than all 20th-century
popes combined. Beatification is the last step before
canonization.

<B>Christians in a Houston neighborhood have mobilized aggressively to bring the gospel to all
100,000 of their neighbors</B>. Members of 47 churches in Houston Heights, a largely Hispanic
and African-American area, are providing a model of cooperation for other areas of the
country. 
<BR><B>..."It's miraculous what has been going on," said Duncan Ragsdale, who runs the Heights
Outreach coalition, which began in 1993</B>. Ministry opportunities have opened in parks,
schools, shopping centers, churches, the business and leadership community, neighborhoods,
and individual homes, he said. 
<BR><B>...Christians "have taken the responsibility to see that everybody in the Heights is exposed to

weekly in Love Park, Stude Park, Cottage Grove Park, and Monte Beach Park. For youth
there are after-school clubs, mentoring, tutoring, and sports in 17 schools. Other outreaches
include preaching, drama, and worship in malls and outside grocery stores; pastors' prayer
luncheons at churches; and gospel presentations at meetings of the Houston Heights
Association, the Citizens Patrol, the Rotary Club, and the Optimists Club. 
<BR><B>...Thirty-one "houses of prayer" -- families who pray regularly for 100 homes in their
neighborhood -- dot the area</B>. "Prayer is what cuts through" to make things happen, Ragsdale
said. A three-day national prayer-evangelism conference, co-sponsored by Ed Silvoso of
Harvest Evangelism (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/111795.html">NIRR 11/17/95</A>), is planned for May. The conference will feature
teaching sessions by international speakers. The musical Heal Our Land, composed by Jimmy
and Carol Owens, also will be presented.  
<BR><B>...Ministering to young people is a primary focus, Ragsdale said</B>. When a student drowned
during a school trip, prayer teams went to Hogg Middle School to help classmates deal with
the trauma. When crisis psychologists arrived, they realized they weren't needed and left, he
said. Heights Outreach holds school assemblies to persuade students to stay in school, and
those who do drop out may receive a home visit from a Christian, acting under the authority
of the Houston Independent School District. Christians are teaching job skills to gang
members, including 30 members of one gang who came to Christ last summer at a Heights
Outreach camp in Marble Falls, Texas.  
<BR><B>...Taking the gospel to people in their homes is another goal</B>. Heights Outreach is working
with the International Bible Society and Campus Crusade for Christ to get a Bible and a Jesus
video into every home in the area. The group also added a volunteer urban planner and an
architect to its staff, and is scheduling a series of town meetings to plot a strategy for
neighborhood growth. Plans also include planting 100 churches. NIRR 2/5/96

<B>A record crowd of more than 8,000 people from 27 states and three Canadian provinces
attended New England's annual Congress Jan</B>. 19-20 in Boston. The event, an
interdenominational gathering for worship, instruction, and networking, is unique in the
country and provides a yearly snapshot of New England's church life (NIRR 2/22/93). 
<BR><B>...This year's Congress was "by far the most significant" in its 36 years, said Steven Macchia,
president of the Evangelistic Association of New England, which organizes the event</B>. EANE
is a network of Christians from 79 denominations and many independent churches throughout
Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.  
<BR><B>...Speakers included pastor Bill Hybels of Willow Creek Community Church in South
Barrington, Ill., who led a preconference seminar for 1,000 pastors; songwriter Gloria Gaither;
pastor Tony Evans of Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship in Dallas; Joni Eareckson Tada, president of
JAF Ministries, an outreach to the disabled; author and radio host Elisabeth Elliot; Macintosh
computer designer Guy Kawasaki, who urged more creativity in evangelism; pastor Tommy
Barnett of Phoenix's First Assembly of God; and author-speaker Jill Briscoe</B>. 
<BR><B>...Ministries to men and youth and increased interest in prayer have caused "deep and
significant" spiritual change in the region, Macchia said</B>. New England "is not exploding with
growth in every corner," but incremental growth is "transforming people's lives from the
inside out," he said. There is "a genuine changing of the landscape." NIRR 2/5/96

<B>More than 300 Episcopalians dedicated their lives to Christ at their church in Paoli, Pa.,
during a service Jan</B>. 14. "I was stunned," said David Thomas, interim rector at Church of the
Good Samaritan. With 1,800 members, the church is one of only a few conservative parishes
in the predominantly liberal Diocese of Philadelphia, he said. At the conclusion of his
sermon, Thomas spontaneously asked if anyone wanted to start the new year with Christ as
"Lord and Savior of their lives." He expected only a handful of the 600 present to come
forward, but "it was a stampede. Many confessed sin, wept about their need for God, and
asked for renewal through the power of the Holy Spirit." Thomas, who has been rector at
other large parishes, said this was the biggest public response to the gospel he could recall in
his 30-year ministry. NIRR 2/5/96

<B>American troops in Bosnia are receiving Bibles and devotional materials sent from U.S.-based
ministries</B>. Campus Crusade for Christ's Military Ministry in Virginia Beach provided about
1,000 Rapid Redeployment Kits to chaplains and units that are part of the NATO
peacekeeping force. The kits include a 90-day devotional, a presentation of the gospel, a tract
explaining salvation, and a pocket-sized New Testament, including Psalms and Proverbs. The
Bibles, which have a camouflage cover, and other materials are designed to help the troops
maintain their relationship with God and "make Him known to others," Military Ministry's
Steve Taylor told NIRR.  
<BR><B>...Other ministries also are supporting the troops and their families</B>. Englewood, Colo.-based
Officer's Christian Fellowship provides members with a ministry kit consisting of Bible
studies, Scripture cards, and materials designed to keep family relationships strong. "We try to
deal with subjects like combat, stress, and separation," said Deputy Executive Director Dick
Kail. 
<BR><B>...Some 25-30 military chaplains are with the troops and are "doing what they do all over the
world -- ministering," according to James Edgren, director of the Chaplain's Commission for
the National Association of Evangelicals</B>. The chaplains conducted pre-deployment ministry to
help soldiers and their families prepare for separation and are now deployed with their units
conducting services and doing counseling, Senior Command Chaplain Col. Herman Kaiser
said. Shipboard Navy chaplains "circuit ride" by helicopter from ship to ship and train
volunteers to help sustain the troops between visits, Taylor said.

<B>Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox believers formed a partnership to broadcast Christian
television to the Middle East and North Africa</B>. SAT-7 is a satellite channel that aims to
strengthen the faith of Christians and help others in the mostly Muslim region understand the
Christian faith. Although less than 5% of the 340 million people in the region are Christians,
90% own televisions. 
<BR><B>...The broadcasts will make a "unique contribution to the life and witness of local Christians,"
said Abu Rashaad, SAT-7's U.S.-based project officer</B>. In addition to strengthening the faith
and witness of the 20 million Christians in the Middle East, the broadcasts will help them
form a common identity and give them a voice in society, Rashaad said. The presence of
many indigenous Christians on the board of directors will ensure that the programming is
culturally sensitive. Rather than Western-style televangelism, programming will reflect the
"true life of the Middle Eastern church and address the everyday lives of Christians there,"
Rashaad told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...Twenty-five Christian agencies from Europe, North America, and the Middle East are
participating in the project</B>. Beginning this spring, SAT-7 will broadcast two hours of
programming a week to the 23 countries and increase that to two hours a day by the end of
the year, Rashaad said. NIRR 2/5/96

<B>The Anglican Church's Decade of Evangelism has halted a 30-year slide in church
attendance, a church report said</B>. At the midway point of its campaign, the church said it is
planting new churches faster than old ones are closing. Signs of Life, the report prepared by
the church's national adviser for evangelism, said 102 churches where planted in the first
three years of its project, 86 of which were "surplus," news reports said. Donations have risen
20% over the last three years, the report said. 
<BR><B>...Evangelicalism is the "largest, richest, and most influential Christian movement in England,"
according to The Daily Telegraph of London</B>. There are some 450,000 evangelicals in the
Anglican Church and 60% of graduates from its theological colleges are evangelical, up from
10% in the 1950s. While evangelicals used to be associated with "impertinent, Bible-swinging
North Americans," they now are accepted in society, the report said. Most evangelicals are
educated, middle-class suburbanites, it concluded. NIRR 2/5/96

<B>A $1.5 million judgment against four Christian Scientists, found liable for denying medical

(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/041795.html">NIRR 4/17/95</A>). Kathy McKown, the mother of 11-year-old Ian Lundman of Independence,
Minn., treated him with prayer in accordance with her belief in spiritual healing. Douglass
Lundman, Ian's father, sued his ex-wife, her husband, a Christian Science nurse, and another
practitioner, news reports said. At the trial, experts said the boy had a 99% chance of survival
if he had been treated medically. There was no history of diabetes in the family and the
condition was not detected until an autopsy was performed. 
<BR><B>...It was the first time Christian Scientists were held financially liable for withholding medical
treatment</B>. Minnesota and 40 other states have laws that permit parents to rely exclusively on
"spiritual treatment" instead of medical care when children become sick, reports said. But
since Ian's death, Minnesota has passed legislation requiring parents to report a child's
serious illness to the proper authorities, despite the family's religious beliefs.

<B>Fifth-grader Joshua Burton can bring his Bible to school as long as it doesn't interfere with

Burton denied the allegation. His attorneys at Liberty Counsel, an Orlando rights group, said
he was reading the Bible before class. 
<BR><B>...The boy sued the Orange County Public School Board and his teacher, claiming they had
violated his constitutional rights</B>. Under the settlement, school administrators will distribute
copies of President Clinton's guidelines on religion to the area's schools, instruct principals to

<B>The Republican Party is wavering over its pro-life platform</B>. The GOP is divided between

<B>Homosexual characters are appearing in more movies and TV shows, according to the Tupelo,
Miss.-based American Family Association and the Media Research Center in New York</B>. The
two conservative groups evaluate the content of television shows. Over the last two years, the
greatest increase has been in prime-time programming, MRC's Sandy Crawford told NIRR.  
<BR><B>..."Almost every week there is a new gay or lesbian movie," said Ted Baehr of the Christian
Film & Television Commission</B>. In the last year, about 40 films were released that either
advanced homosexual themes or featured a homosexual character, he said. Contrary to
"typical propaganda" from homosexual organizations, the movies do not fare well at the box
office, Baehr said. According to the CFTC's 1996 Annual Report to the Film Industry (NIRR
1/8), the average homosexual-theme film grossed $912,000; films with some element of
homosexuality grossed $11.46 million. In contrast, the average film considered "moral" by
CFTC standards grossed $44 million. Baehr presents the statistics to film industry executives
every year. 
<BR><B>...Homosexual characters introduce the lifestyle to viewers in order to make them feel
comfortable about it, the media watchdogs said</B>. The theme is not portrayed as "an issue to be
debated, but treated as a normal lifestyle," AFA's Randall Murphree said. NBC's Friends and
ABC's Roseanne portrayed homosexual weddings on their shows this season. But while the
shows promote homosexual rights and portray homosexual relationships and marriage as
positive, they ignore promiscuity and AIDS, Crawford said. 
<BR><B>...In response, the MRC has founded the Parent's TV Council, a pro-family lobby in
Hollywood</B>. The group will press for family-oriented entertainment. "A lot of it is just having
a presence and being able to talk with executives about our values," Crawford said. The group
will give Christians and pro-family people in the industry support to express their views.
More than a dozen Christian fellowships in Hollywood pray for the industry, Baehr said.

dominant country in world and when the U.S. speaks on these issues the results can be very

the NAE's statement, which include appointing a special adviser to the president for religious
liberty and rescinding foreign aid to countries that do not act to stop religious persecution.
Clinton did not respond with any specific policy proposals, but Argue said the president
listened intently and at one point told an aide, "We need to go to work on this." At the end of
the meeting Argue invited Clinton to address the issue at the NAE's convention March 3-5 in
Minneapolis.  
<BR><B>...Other NAE initiatives include participating in legislative hearings on religious persecution
and encouraging political parties to adopt the principles of the NAE statement in their
platforms, NAE's Richard Cizik said</B>. A primary goal is to work with Congress on legislation
linking persecution to foreign aid. The NAE also will formulate a strategy to involve member
churches in its effort to end the foreign persecution. "We want to educate them on the facts

above a sick person's body helps smooth out kinks in the person's energy field, speeds
healing, and eases pain. Critics say the same effect can be attained when a nurse sits on the
side of the bed, talks to a patient, and holds his hand.  
<BR><B>...TT practitioners reportedly number in the tens of thousands in the United States and many
foreign countries</B>. Therapeutic touch is taught in nursing schools, practiced in hospitals, and is
described in Techniques in Clinical Nursing, a widely distributed textbook, reports said.  
<BR><B>...TT is a modern interpretation of ancient Eastern mystical traditions and healing techniques
akin to witchcraft, critics say</B>. Last month, a group of TT skeptics criticized a $355,225
Defense Department research grant given to the School of Nursing at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham to study the effects of TT on patients with battlefield-related burns.

<B>Rabbi Evan Radler started a company that offers the freelance services of four rabbis, a
cantor, and a psychiatric social worker in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut</B>. He said
he wants to "bring at least a certain amount of Jewish spirituality" to those who are "turned
off to the coldness and sterility often found in institutional Judaism." The cleric ran an ad in
The Wall Street Journal offering "a friendly and sensitive rabbi" for weddings, conversions,
baby namings, bar or bat mitzvahs, funerals, and tombstone unveilings by calling (800)
RABBI-98. Fees vary depending on requirements, with a wedding costing $450-$1,500.
Radler, who also leads a Long Island congregation, plans to advertise in Modern Bride
magazine and to offer brochures to funeral homes. 
<BR><B>...Some find Radler's combination of religion and enterprise dismaying</B>. Rabbi Jerome
Epstein, chief executive of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, an association of
800 congregations, said Radler's freelancing was not a positive approach. "If people say, `I'm
only going to pay for firemen when they put out my fire,' the fire companies would never
exist," Epstein said. NIRR 2/5/96

<B>John Bennett, Jr., (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/121195.html">NIRR 12/11/95</A>) agreed to turn over his $600,000 home, car, stocks,
retirement savings, daughter's house, and other assets to help resolve claims in the Foundation
for New Era Philanthropy bankruptcy case, news reports said</B>. The deal will allow Bennett to
avoid a lawsuit by Arlin Adams, the trustee representing the creditors. It does not prevent
possible criminal charges or pending lawsuits by federal regulators, who allege that Bennett
operated an illegal Ponzi scheme in which money from new investors was used to pay earlier
investors.

<B>The U.S</B>. House of Representatives commissioned a Congressional Gold Medal to be awarded
to Billy Graham and his wife, Ruth Graham, for their contributions to American society. The

Nobles diverted $3 million from the Baptist school through complex banking maneuvers and
used the money for personal investments and a lavish lifestyle that included frequent
dalliances with prostitutes. Court documents said he spent $389,000 on the women in 4

<B>Canada: Judge Edmond Cronin overturned as too restrictive a British Columbia law banning
protests outside abortion clinics</B>. The law, passed after an abortion doctor was shot in his
home by a sniper, banned peaceful protests, prayer, sign-carrying, and counseling within 150
feet of abortion clinics, 30 feet of the office of abortionists, and 480 feet of workers' homes.
The government is entitled to stop intimidation of staff and patients, but prohibiting protests
violates the right to freedom of expression, he said. British Columbia has not indicated
whether it will appeal the decision.
<P>
<B>The U.S</B>. Supreme Court refused to review Nebraska's request to restrict Medicaid abortion
funding to cases in which the woman's life is in danger. The justices refused to hear a similar
request from Colorado in December, and have yet to act on challenges by Pennsylvania and
Arkansas. The refusals do not set precedent, but are a sign that the high court is content to let
lower courts reject challenges to federal regulations on Medicaid abortions, observers said.
<P>
<B>Federal agents suspect arson in the burning of three black churches in impoverished rural
western Alabama, news reports said</B>. All the churches are within a six-mile radius of Boligee.
Two of them -- Little Zion and Mount Zoar -- burned the night of Jan. 11, the day that the
Sumter County Journal published a story about the sentencing of two vandals for smashing
pews, windows, and kitchen equipment at three other black churches last year in Coatopa, 20
miles away. Authorities investigating the fires are exploring a possible connection with arsons
at black churches in Tennessee (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/012296.html">NIRR 1/22</A>).

<B>The city of San Francisco distributed a $65,000 grant to the local Salvation Army chapter
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/012296.html">NIRR 1/22</A>) after the charity assured the Board of Supervisors that it offers services to

homosexuality as "a serious threat to...society as a whole." 
<P>
<B>Interest in angels is developing into interest in the devil, Newsday said</B>. Books about Satan,
the dark sides of angels, and the origins of evil are the "hot button" in book publishing, said
Phyllis Tickle of Publishers Weekly. She traced much of the new interest to the success of
Anne Rice's novel Memnock the Devil last year. Still, the most popular religious subject for
readers last year was prayer, a survey found.

<P>
<B>Mormonism is growing fast in the 1990s, but more slowly than in previous periods, according
to Sunstone, an independent Mormon magazine</B>. If the growth rate for the 1990s continues,
the Mormon Church's overall gain this decade would be 46%, compared with 67% in the
1960s and 73% in the 1980s. The slowdown may be a pause between growth spurts or an
indicator of organizational problems, according to the newsletter Religion Watch. Even the
slower rate of growth is in line with sociologist Rodney Stark's projections that the Mormon
church will grow between 30% and 50% per decade, resulting in a membership of 265
million by 2080.
<P>
<B>Some 5,300 evangelistic parties took place around the country during the Super Bowl,
according to Tom Felton, editor of Sports Spectrum magazine</B>. The parties included a

Park Police and Supreme Court officers estimated the crowd at 60,000, up from 35,000 last
year. Organizers estimated the crowd at 125,000. "If you believe it's wrong, you can't give
up," Dolores Miller of Seaside Park, N.J., said. The March for Life Fund has organized the
event since the court's 1973 decision. A White House spokesman said President Clinton
hopes Americans will "minimize hostility and violence and maximize understanding and
common ground" on the issue.

<B>Many of the 39,024 ministers at the Promise Keepers Clergy Conference for Men in Atlanta
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/022096.html">NIRR 2/20</A>) last month are describing it as a spiritual high-water mark for themselves and
possibly a turning point for the church</B>. Diverse in color, ethnicity, and denominational
background, they seemed at the end united in commitment to personal repentance and
renewal, and to reconciliation and revival in the church. Their vows are summarized in the
Atlanta Covenant, a document being distributed by the Promise Keepers ministry.
<BR><B>..."I've seen nothing like it in 35 years of ministry," said Robert Short, 53, pastor of First
Alliance Church, Fort Myers, Fla</B>. A veteran religion reporter said the three-day conference
was one of the most significant events he's witnessed in 30 years of covering the church
scene. To pastor Charles Dixon, 49, of Western Heights Baptist Church in Waco, Texas, who
teaches a seminary extension course on church growth, the conference was "a defining
development in the life of the church." But pastors must work to spread the fire to their
congregations at home, or the convention "will have been just another waste of time and
resources," Short cautioned.
<BR><B>..."We are on the verge of the greatest spiritual revolution in the history of the church, and
you are called to be a part of it," Wellington Boone told the gathering</B>. Boone is an
African-American pastor who heads an urban ministry that emphasizes prayer and unity. "God
couldn't find a pastor to bring this group together; He had to use a football coach," he said,
referring to Promise Keepers founder Bill McCartney, former University of Colorado coach.
"Well, I have no intention of letting a college football coach be more serious about the things
of God than I am," Boone declared. The audience cheered and applauded.
<BR><B>...The pastors carry lingering images from the Georgia Dome indoor stadium: Men embracing
as they prayed for each other at the conclusion of John Maxwell's talk on accountability</B>. "We
don't need one more guy to fall off the edge," Maxwell said. Preachers on their knees after
Chuck Swindoll's sermon on brokenness and repentance, a few face-down on the floor,
weeping and praying. Steve Green singing Let the Walls Come Down, with everyone
standing, their hands held aloft and locked with their neighbors' hands. Sustained cheers and
applause for Max Lucado's wall-razing treatise on biblical unity. "Unity matters to God. It is
a priority item for Him and should be for us," he said. Maxwell, a former Wesleyan pastor in
suburban San Diego, heads Injoy, a ministry to ministers. Swindoll, a former Evangelical Free
Church pastor in Fullerton, Calif., is president of Dallas Seminary. Lucado is a San Antonio,
Texas, author and pastor in the traditionally separatist non-instrumental Church of Christ.  
<BR><B>...In a pivotal session on race, Raleigh Washington and Glen Kehrein, black and white
Chicago ministers, respectively, and co-authors of a book on reconciliation, discussed their
experiences at length</B>. After they finished, Tony Evans, the black pastor of interracial Oak
Cliff Bible Fellowship in Dallas, stepped to the podium and warned of making theology
subservient to sociology: "If you can't [identify] the cause of racism, you can't get at the
solution." The pulpits of America have failed to deal with the problem, he said. Racism, he
declared, "is a sin," and unrepentant racists in the church -- whether black or white -- need to
be disciplined just like any other unrepentant sinners. He received a standing ovation.  
<BR><B>...Next came California Foursquare pastor Jack Hayford, who has been working for racial
reconciliation in Los Angeles</B>. He said it had taken him three decades to discover
"unperceived racism." Addressing blacks, he requested forgiveness for a host of shortcomings,
from insensitivity to their pain to wrong attitudes. He added, "I don't know well how to be
different, but I ask for your help and understanding as I grow." Everyone stood and applauded
for a long time. Suddenly it was quiet. Then from the rear middle deck a voice cried out, "I
forgive you, my brother." Another from the left lower deck shouted, "Me, too." Others all
over the stadium echoed the words.
<BR><B>...Blacks and whites hugged each other and prayed together throughout the Georgia Dome
after worship leader Joseph Garlington, pastor of 1,700-member Covenant Church, a
multiracial Pittsburgh congregation, extended forgiveness on behalf of the assembled blacks</B>.
He called on his brethren to repent for bitterness, strife, separatism, and the like, and to
commit themselves to unity with other believers. Garlington asked all the black ministers to
stand as he prayed for them. As he did, whites sitting nearby quietly went to the black
ministers' sides and laid hands on their shoulders or heads. 
<BR><B>...There were more confessions, hugs, and tears as Hispanic, Asian, and Native American
representatives joined the others</B>. Finally McCartney took over. He urged the ministers to root
out racism and stand for justice. Amid a long standing ovation, he summoned all blacks to
come to the front. "We want to honor you," he said. From all over the stadium they streamed,
perhaps 1,800 altogether. On the main floor, whites left their seats and formed aisles through
which the blacks passed. All along the route, there were embraces, handshakes, and words of
appreciation and encouragement. Whites throughout the stadium continued their applause and
chanted, "We love you, we love you." The demonstration ended in prayer. "Let us be the
generation of love and reconciliation," McCartney urged.
<BR><B>...The coach had hoped that far more black pastors would attend</B>. Many were offered
scholarships. But in preparatory meetings across the country, he found many blacks to be
reluctant to join movements organized and controlled by whites. Although blacks hold
prominent offices and roles in PK, it still is a predominantly white group trying to recruit
black churches and churchmen, said Henry Lyons, president of the 8.5-million-member
National Baptist Convention U.S.A. "I see it as an attempt to put us back on the plantation,"
he was quoted as saying in USA Today on the opening day of the conference. Lyons has
launched a men's movement in black churches called Trusted Partners; some of its goals are
similar to those of Promise Keepers. PK officials did not comment on Lyons' quote, but held
out hope that the seeds planted in Atlanta eventually will result in racial harmony and
cooperation throughout the church.                                              
<BR><B>...Of equal concern to McCartney are denominational differences that impede unity</B>. "I am not
saying that we should dismantle our denominations and ignore our distinctives, but that we
should concentrate on the 95% where we agree," he told reporters. "If we do that, we'll see
positive change." At the final session, he invited everyone who could partake in communion
without violating his conscience to do so as a sign of unity in Christ. He noted the presence
of Catholic priests and others in the assembly with views that might bar them from taking
part. Hardly anyone left the building.
<BR><B>...Within the first two weeks back home, pastors were reporting they already had begun to
meet regularly with new prayer partners</B>. For example, John Hauck, 36, pastor of a United
Methodist church in Bradley, Ill., said he is meeting with a nearby Episcopal priest who
became his prayer partner while they were in Atlanta. In Waco, Texas, a post-Atlanta
"after-glow" report to 350 people, a number of them ministers, resulted in an Atlanta-like
session of racial reconciliation. At least one black pastor said he will join a weekly prayer
gathering of several of his white brethren. Others spoke of beginning cooperative,
community-wide outreaches in the days ahead. "We need repentance, revival, and
reconciliation," said Waco pastor Charles Dixon. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>A "Third Wave" church movement has begun in China</B>. Some 4,200 independent churches
with 1.2 million believers are opening across the country with the approval of local
government officials, according to Asian Outreach, a Hong Kong-based ministry. The
churches are registered as People's Organizations and are not part of the government-run
Three Self Patriotic Movement or the persecuted house-church movement. "We don't fight the
Three Self...we only preach Jesus and serve the local community," one pastor told Asian
Outreach's David Wang. City officials were among the thousands gathered to dedicate the
pastor's new church in central China last month. 
<BR><B>...Third Wave churches are not political and don't receive money or materials from outside
the country, Wang said</B>. The recently opened church was financed by Chinese Christians. By
avoiding conflicts between the Three Self and house churches, the ministers can develop
relationships with local Communist Party officials. The officials used to believe "one more
Christian, one less Chinese," but Third Wave pastors are trying to change that impression.
"Their message is `one more Christian, one better Chinese,'" Wang said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>A missionary's prayer for rain in Thailand saved a village's harvest and convinced its people
to become Christians, according to the Hong Kong-based Sower's Ministry</B>. In Kalasin
province, 134 families became Christians when native missionary Lun Poobuanak and his
church prayed for rain. Poobuanak was holding services with his small congregation when the
village leaders interrupted. "If you ask your God to give us rain this month, all households in
our clan will worship your God and become Christians," said the leader. Skeptical at first,
Poobuanak told them they could not "play games with the living God." But the leader
repeated his vow and said, "If we do not, your God can send judgment on us." The Christians
immediately began to fast and pray.
<BR><B>...On the fourth day a storm came that filled the rice fields and saved their crops</B>. The rain
was so intense that "the villagers admitted that Jesus is the true and living God," Poobuanak
said. All the households in the village were converted and word has spread to many of the
surrounding districts. "This is a living testimony that helps us win souls easily in this area,"
Poobuanak said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>About 100 pastors from 10 European countries went to Ljubljana, Slovenia, last month for the
International Congress on Revival, a weeklong conference on preaching, prayer, and ministry</B>.
"They share their burdens, needs, and victories so we can pray and rejoice with them,"
conference organizer Bill Stafford said. 
<BR><B>...Pastors who "have a heart for Jesus and their country" are invited to attend the congress,
Stafford, a Southern Baptist evangelist for 40 years, told NIRR</B>. ICR pays expenses for travel,
food, and lodging. "They go back refreshed and it is evident in their preaching. We get
reports of churches having revival after they return," Stafford said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>"Structures of sin" account for trillions of dollars of the world's money consumption, the
Global Evangelization Movement, a Richmond, Va.-based research group, reported</B>. Financial
crimes, including fraud, tax evasion, and computer theft, add up to almost $2 trillion, while
gambling ($700 billion), organized crime ($600 billion), drug trafficking ($150 billion),
shoplifting ($90 billion), and pornography ($20 billion) account for the rest. A little more than
10% of the money consumed by such endeavors could provide food, shelter, and education
for the world's poor, according to GEM.
<BR><B>...The global church has the money to evangelize the world many times over, GEM said</B>.
Personal income of church members worldwide amounted to $11.1 trillion, of which $193
billion, about 2%, is given to Christian causes yearly. Parachurch groups, local churches, and
other groups received $194 billion last year. About 9.6 billion was lost to ecclesiastical crime,
GEM said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>A 30-minute video has helped bring 10,000 teen-agers to Christ</B>. Some 400,000 teen-agers
have watched The Crossing since it premiered at Youth For Christ's DC-LA '94 convention
(NIRR 8/8/94), where it received three standing ovations. Since then, The Crossing has been
rented and shown at youth rallies, at youth group meetings, and in homes. YFC now is selling
the tape, which gives a clear presentation of the salvation message. The group also is
encouraging Christians to show it to their non-Christian friends. The video comes with a
booklet containing 30 suggested situations in which to show it.
<BR><B>..."Ten thousand kids is just a small indication" of what could happen when the video is
shown to large numbers of nonbelievers, said Bill Muir of YFC, who wrote the screenplay for
The Crossing and co-produced it</B>. The video has been dubbed into Spanish and will be shown
to groups and aired widely on TV in Latin America, Muir told NIRR.  
<BR><B>...Teen-agers identify with the video's youthful protagonist, Muir said</B>. In a dream, the young
man is presented with a computer printout of his sins and is found guilty in a courtroom. He
then is brought to watch Christ die for him and subsequently walks across a chasm with the
cross as his bridge. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>A San Bernardino, Calif., church has been burglarized more times than pastor Robin Hyde
can remember, including nine times since last May</B>. Thieves have broken into the sanctuary,
office, nursery, fellowship hall, and restrooms at Cornerstone Church of the Nazarene, making
off with light fixtures, soap dispensers, coffee urns, vacuum cleaners, and musical
instruments. The congregation has done everything but put barbed wire around the sanctuary,
he said. Hyde spends a lot of time filing insurance claims.
<BR><B>...Nevertheless, the church continues to reach out to the community</B>. It feeds 300 poor people
each month and sends teams into surrounding neighborhoods to pray with people. "We are
not controlled by these things -- we can't be. We are a church," Hyde said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>Some African-Americans have a "been there, done that" opinion about racial reconciliation,
according to Barbara Williams Skinner, president of the Skinner Farm Leadership Institute</B>.
Skinner, who is black, is the wife of the late evangelist Tom Skinner (NIRR 1/24/94).
<BR><B>...Blacks who are not enthusiastic about reconciliation with whites generally have four
reasons, Skinner said in The Reconciler magazine</B>. First, despite much talk, whites don't
understand blacks very well, she said. Second, reconciliation reminds blacks of the failed
integration movement of the 1960s, when blacks were asked to give up their heritage while
whites "didn't give up anything," she said. Third, blacks fear losing control of their churches.
Fourth, they detect racist attitudes among whites in the church. Yet blacks should not turn
these sentiments into "an obstacle course for whites," Skinner said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>Churchgoers from some three dozen denominations raised $1 million Jan</B>. 28 to feed the poor
and hungry. Congregants were asked to drop $1 each into large soup bowls as they left their
services. The money collected is being donated directly to local ministries to the poor.
<BR><B>...More than 3,500 churches, synagogues, businesses, and schools participated in the program,
called Souper Bowl</B>. The idea began in 1990 with Brad Smith, pastor of Spring Valley
Presbyterian Church in Columbia, S.C. He prayed on Super Bowl Sunday, "As we go home
to enjoy the Super Bowl, let us remember those who are without even a bowl of soup." Now,
100 volunteers work during the year compiling and distributing an informational brochure,
newsletter, and video, and maintaining a database. On Souper Bowl Sunday, 60 volunteers
answer telephones and tabulate donations. Smith spends 20% of his time on the project, he
told NIRR. For information, call (800) 358-SOUP. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>Activists are refining the language of a religious freedom amendment</B>. Reps. Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.), a Catholic, and Ernest Istook (R-Okla.), a Mormon, both proposed amendments
seeking to clarify the First Amendment. Hyde's resolution prohibits laws that discriminate "on
account of religious expression, belief, or identity." It says the First Amendment's prohibition
of an establishment of religion should not be construed to require such discrimination (NIRR
10/30/95). Istook's bill would prohibit laws that disallow "acknowledgments of the religious
heritage, beliefs, or traditions of the people, or prohibit student-sponsored prayer in schools." 
<BR><B>...But a debate over which proposal is better has kept both amendments bottled up</B>. Advocates
of Hyde's version say Istook's allows too much government involvement in religion, while
Istook criticizes Hyde's version for not directly addressing prayer in public schools. A
number of religious groups, including the Southern Baptist Christian Life Commission, the
Christian Legal Society's Center for Law and Religious Freedom, and the National
Association of Evangelicals, helped draft the original Hyde proposal and are refining its
language. A new proposal should be ready early this month. It is very close to the original

American churches to help, Open Doors Communications Director Jeff Taylor said. Later, the
news service changed its name and established an independent board of directors, with Open
Doors remaining its largest contributor.
<BR><B>...Last year, the ministry ended its support for NNI partly because it had gone "a little outside

home of Sumter County Circuit Judge Eddie Hardaway, who sent two white men to jail for
vandalizing black churches. No one was injured, but police have moved Hardaway and his
family to a secret location. Hardaway presides over cases in a region where six black
churches have been burned. 
<BR><B>...Church arsonists are not only full of hate, but "absolutely convinced" that they are doing
right, an arson expert said</B>. Dian Williams, head of the Center For Arson Research, told NIRR
that the spate of fires at black churches in the South in the last three years is the work of
people who believe they are saving their communities from "dangerous and noxious
elements." Williams' 12-year-old national center, based in Philadelphia, provides
psychological evaluations and profiles of arsonists and their motivations, and recommends
treatments for them.
<BR><B>...Churches are a "symbol of authority and goodness," and when an arsonist acts, he sets
himself up as "the ultimate, supreme authority," Williams said</B>. Destruction of property and
lives does not sear arsonists' consciences, she said.
<BR><B>...Of the 23 churches in the South that have burned since April 1993, including 19 since
January 1995, eight cases have been solved</B>. Seven involve white men and are clearly racially
motivated, news reports said. One fire was set by a 10-year-old upset by the divorce of his
biracial parents. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>The mother of Gary Dockery, the severely brain-damaged Tennessee policeman who talked
for the first time in 7  years, said she never considered ending her son's life-support because
God promised her Gary would wake up</B>. Corena Thompson, interviewed on the Christian
Broadcasting Network with her husband, Richard, said she told God that when Gary woke up,
"I would use this to show people just what a miracle God could do." Richard Thompson said
that even though "I didn't have the faith that I should have had," he believed that some day
Gary would "testify to the world to the glory of God and what God can do." Gary Dockery
also spoke to his sons Shane and Colt, who said their faith kept them praying for their father
to wake up. Dockery, 42, was shot in the head in 1988 by a drunken man in Walden, Tenn.,
near Chattanooga.
<BR><B>...Neurologists said they were searching for a medical explanation in Dockery's case</B>.
Although he has severe impairments in his neurological, motor, and verbal abilities, Dockery
never was in a coma or a vegetative state, they said. Neurologist Ronald Cranford of
Minneapolis, co-chairman of a national task force that examines cases in which people
emerge from comas or vegetative states, cautioned that waking up from such situations is
rare. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>More than a million people are expected to attend concerts during a six month, 90-city tour
by Christian singer Carman</B>. Included are stops at stadiums in Detroit, New Orleans, Houston,
Anaheim, and New York City. In October 1994, 71,000 people filled Texas Stadium in Irving
to hear Carman at the largest contemporary Christian music concert ever (NIRR 10/31/94). 
<BR><B>...In connection with the concerts, Feed the Children is distributing food to the poor in several
of the tour's cities</B>. In St. Louis, where the humanitarian agency brought 90,000 pounds of
food, 39% of children under 12 live below the poverty line, Larry Jones, president of Feed
the Children, told NIRR. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>Louis Farrakhan confirmed that he accepted a $1 billion pledge from Libyan dictator
Muammar Kadhafi for Nation of Islam activities in the United States, news reports said
(NIRR 2/19/96)</B>. Kadhafi is "my friend, he's my brother," Farrakhan told thousands of
followers at the University of Illinois Chicago after his 18-nation visit to the Middle East and
Africa. The Justice Department reportedly told Farrakhan that accepting the money might
define him as a foreign agent and require him to disclose expenditures to influence U.S.
policies or opinions. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) called for hearings into Farrakhan's actions.
"It's time for a showdown," Farrakhan said.   
<P>
<B>The Episcopal Church held hearings last month to clarify its doctrine regarding
the ordination of practicing homosexuals</B>. If the church court finds that such ordination
violates its rules, retired Newark, N.J., Bishop Walter Righter, 72, will probably be tried for
heresy in May. He ordained a practicing homosexual in 1990 (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/122595.html">NIRR 12/25/95</A>).
<P>
<B>Newark, N.J., Episcopal Bishop John Spong, 64, said he will retire as soon as a successor is
elected (NIRR 2/5/96)</B>. But Spong, a longtime thorn in the side of conservatives, promised to
stay in office until age 72 if "heresy hunters" continue to "harass me or this diocese." 
<P>
<B>Paul Cedar will not seek another term as president of the Evangelical Free Church of
America, a position he has held for six years</B>. Cedar has split his time between administrating
the EFCA and Mission America, an interdenominational evangelistic movement (NIRR
12/25/95). In October, he will begin full-time as Mission America's chairman and chief
executive.

<B>Hillary Rodham Clinton hosted Muslim families at a reception in the Old Executive Office

<B>Charlton Heston's appearance in a Bud Light beer commercial led a Florence, Ala., Christian
school to cancel his March 22 speech for the institution's fund-raiser</B>. "Part of our purpose for

Bible School. "We had some complaints." Heston's screen roles include Moses.

<B>Last Days Ministries is closing (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29/95</A>)</B>. The Lindale, Texas, nonprofit, published Last
Days Magazine, which called Christians to radical commitment. LDM also had trained
missionaries and was involved in the pro-life movement. The late Christian singer Keith
Green and his wife, Melody, founded LDM in 1977. She and her second husband, Andrew
Sievright, continued LDM. A ministry should "only continue to exist for the season God
appointed for it," Melody said of LDM, which began as an outgrowth of the Jesus Movement.
<P>
<B>Evangelism Explosion International has set up its ministry in all 211 of the world's nations,
the group said</B>. Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based EE trains pastors, evangelists, missionaries, church
leaders, and lay people for evangelism.
<P>
<B>Most of the 9.4 million Mormons in the world now live outside of the United States, the
church said</B>. The most growth has occurred in Latin America, where there are more than 3
million Mormons. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has 50,000 missionaries, it
said.
<P>
<B>A Million Woman March is planned for Los Angeles June 14-16</B>. The rally is to focus on
strengthening the bonds of families. Workshops and seminars are planned on crime, teen
pregnancy, and other issues that families face. The highlight will be a June 15 march down
Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to Exposition Park in South Los Angeles. The Congress of
Racial Equality and the Freedom Journal, a black publication in Los Angeles, are co-sponsors.
<P>
<B>The Tennessee Senate voted overwhelmingly to urge its citizens to observe the Ten
Commandments and post them in homes, schools, businesses, and places of worship from
May 5-17</B>. "It is time we get back to the basics of morality," said the resolution's co-sponsor,
Ben Atchley (R-Knoxville). The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that displaying the
Commandments in a school, except as part of a course, violates the Constitution.
<P>
<B>Colorado can keep a monument engraved with the Ten Commandments in a public park near
the Capitol in Denver, the U.S</B>. Supreme Court ruled. The court turned away arguments by
the Freedom From Religion Foundation that such a display is unconstitutional. The
3-foot-by-4-foot granite monument was placed in Lincoln Park in the 1950s.
<P>
<B>The newly published reference book Practical Encyclopedia of Evangelism and Church
Growth (Regal Books) standardizes definitions of terms, ideas, and principles</B>. Elmer Towns,
dean of the School of Religion at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., is general editor and
author of most articles. 
<P>
<B>The Archdiocese of Milwaukee is not liable for the alleged sexual abuse of a girl by one of
its priests 30 years ago, the U.S</B>. Supreme Court said. The ruling upheld a Wisconsin
Supreme Court decision involving the issue of repressed memory. The Wisconsin Supreme
Court ruled that the three year statute of limitations barred Judith Pritzlaff's claim. Pritzlaff
contends she remembered the abuse shortly before the 1992 lawsuit.
<P>
<B>A Long Island, N.Y., landlord can not evict an abortion clinic from his building only because
of protests by those opposed to abortion, the New York Appellate Division court ruled</B>. The
decision overturned a ruling allowing Ronald Morey to end the lease of Long Island
Gynecological Services at his Garden City building (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/111395.html">NIRR 11/13/95</A>).

<B>Forty-five million abortions, about one for every three live births, are performed around the
world every year, the United Nations reported</B>. About 38% of the world's population lives in
countries where abortion is available on demand. 
<P>
<B>Reported acts of anti-Semitism in the United States declined 11% in 1995, the biggest drop in
a decade, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith said</B>. 
<P>
<B>The Amish have been easy prey in 10-15 robberies in Nappanee, Ind., since January</B>. Pacifist,
black-clad Amish men on bicycles have been robbed and beaten with metal pipes and tire
irons on their way home from work in the town, which is 45 miles southeast of South Bend.
Most attacks occurred on Thursdays or Fridays, paydays at the plants where many Amish
work, news reports said. Amish men carry cash and don't use credit cards or checkbooks.
<P>
<B>Colorado won't pay for chaplains in its prisons</B>. The House State Affairs Committee said that
the $300,000 cost was too high (NIRR 5/17/93). Rep. Phil Pankey (R-Littleton) asked why
churches couldn't pay for the chaplains. Lucia Guzman, head of the Colorado Council of
Churches, backed a bill to fund the chaplains and said the state and church "should be in
greater partnership."
<P>
<B>A man admitted stealing 18 Torahs, holy scrolls of scripture, from New York City
synagogues</B>. Richard Stevens was caught trying to break into a room at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel, police said. He confessed to a string of burglaries since 1992 at synagogues and other
locations and to the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Torahs, art, and silver
objects, news reports said. There is a market in the United States and abroad for second-hand
scrolls, which are valued at as much as $15,000 each. None of the Torahs has been recovered.
<P>
<B>Some 250 evangelism leaders across the country formed an informal group called The
Network</B>. They use a monthly newsletter to share ideas. About 75% of the members are
Southern Baptists, but others also have joined. For information, call the group's director, Bob
Bailey of the Southeastern Indiana Baptist Association, at (812) 282-8777.
<P>
<B>The Catholic Church must pay $600,000 in punitive damages to a man molested by a priest in
1981</B>. It is reportedly only the third time the Church has been ordered to pay such damages,
imposed to punish offenders and deter others from similar conduct. A Hennepin County,
Minn., jury on Feb. 13 found the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis guilty of "willful
indifference to the rights and safety" of Dale Scheffler, 28. He had been abused by Robert
Kapoun, who had been kept in the ministry after acknowledging previous wrongdoing. The
jury also awarded $550,000 in compensatory damages to Scheffler.

<P>
<B>Zimbabwe: Catholic bishops condemned persecution of homosexuals</B>. They said
homosexuality is a disorder, but the government should not harass or torture homosexuals.
"We want to eliminate the disease...we do not want to eliminate those who suffer from it,"
they said. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, a Catholic, has called homosexuals perverts
and beasts and said they have no rights in the country (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/091395.html">NIRR 9/13/95</A>).

Estonian Church's request. In response, the Russian Orthodox Church announced it was
suspending relations with the Istanbul-based Eastern Church, which is the head of all
Orthodox churches.

Former Mississippi College president
Lewis Nobles, facing trial for embezzlement of millions of dollars of college donations (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/020695.html">NIRR 2/6</A>), suffered a stroke,
according to his lawyer. It occurred while
he was recovering from two operations

Writer and minister Mel White (NIRR
7/25/94) was arrested on trespassing
charges at Pat Robertson's Christian
Broadcasting Network complex in Virginia
Beach. White, who publicly acknowledged his homosexuality in 1991, was a
ghostwriter for a 1986 Robertson book.
He showed up on Valentine's Day carrying flowers and candy, saying he wanted to discuss "inflammatory" anti-homosexual comments Robertson made on his

Carol Willis, 45, now a senior advisor on
minority voters at the Democratic National Committee, no longer is welcome in
some black circles. He showed up uninvited last month at a black ministers'
political strategy session sponsored by
Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. But
Willis was escorted out as soon as he
was spotted, participants told The Washington Post. Jackson said it was "inappropriate" for Willis to attend since his
campaign funding activities are under
federal investigation. Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr reportedly is probing the large amounts of cash
President Clinton's state and national
campaigns distributed in the black community. The funds include money given
by Willis to black ministers, ostensibly as
part of get-out-the-vote efforts.

A recent Time story on Pat Robertson
and his Operation Blessing ministry was
"badly distorted" and a "cheap shot," said
Robert Fanning, OB's chief operating

Seko, dictator of Zaire for 30 years. A
Robertson organization working in Zaire,
the African Development Company,
formed to look into mining, lumber, agriculture, and transportation investments,
could not engage in these activities without help from Mobutu, William Harrop, a
former ambassador to Zaire, told Time.
Robertson was quoted as saying that his
organizations "do not engage in domestic
politics with governments." His
enterprises in Zaire are private and designed to generate revenue for the humanitarian purposes of Operation Blessing, said spokesman Gene Kapp.

<P>
More than 25,000 people became Christians in six weeks as the result of a
play staged in Modesto, Calif. The evangelistic Heaven's Gates and Hell's
Flames was performed 28 times at Calvary Temple Worship Center, filling the
3,000-capacity Assemblies of God church each night, several pastors told NIRR.
In addition to the 25,000, an estimated 8,000 people who did not submit decision
cards because of the crush of the crowd also became believers, ushers said.
<BR>...The play is produced by Toronto-based Reality Outreach Ministries,
Inc., which trains local church members to perform the vignettes. Depending on
their characters' decisions about Christ, actors either climb stairs to heaven or are
dragged away to hell. "It's not scare tactics, but reality tactics. Hell is a scary
place," Calvary Temple pastor Glen Berteau told NIRR. "But it's still God. God
has chosen to rest on this city." Among those stirred to become believers as a
result of the play were several generations of families, including 23 members of
one extended family. Productions in the United States and Canada by Reality's
16 teams reportedly resulted in tens of thousands of conversions in 1994.
<BR>...Revival continued when the play was not being staged. While Berteau
read announcements before a Sunday service, a man approached the podium,
stood with his arms folded, and asked to be saved. As the man waved for the
congregation to join him, 45 people came forward. When people become believers during the announcements, "there's got to be an anointing," Berteau said.
<BR>...Prayer and fasting by pastors in the area preceeded what some are calling
the Miracle in Modesto. Pastors from various denominations meet at noon on
Wednesdays for the past year "to draw closer to God and each other," said David
Seifert, chairman of the Modesto Ministerium Association and pastor of Big
Valley Grace Community Church. The meetings are an outgrowth of two
Pastor's Prayer Summits conducted by International Renewal Ministries of
Portland, Ore. (NIRR 5/30/94). More than 60 pastors gathered for four-day
prayer summits. As a result, other churches in the area are "rejoicing in
Calvary's successes" without envy or rivalry, said Phil Arendt, missions pastor at
Modesto's First Baptist Church.
<BR>...Berteau reluctantly agreed to halt performances late in February in
order to allow time for churches in the area to assimilate the new believers. Most
have been referred for discipleship and fellowship to churches of various denominations around the area.

Hundreds of Siberian teens turned to Christ during a January crusade to the
Yakutia Region of Russia, San Antonio-based evangelist Sammy Tippit said. The
greatest response occurred in the town of Chulman (pop. 30,000), where about
500 people, including 350 young people, were converted during two days of
preaching in the schools and a local theater. Similar crusades in the neighboring
cities of Yakutsk and Neriungi saw 500 people accept Christ. Intense follow-up
activities are built into the crusades, and the new converts are matched with local
churches, provided with Bibles, and invited to attend Bible study and discipleship
courses, Tippit told NIRR. Siberia always has been a fruitful region for his
ministry "because of the religious vacuum -- something has to rise up there,"
Tippit said. 
<BR>...Tippit was asked to preach at the prison where Georgy Vins, the imprisoned Russian pastor who became the subject of international attention in the
1970s, was held for a year and a half before his release. "It was a sobering
experience," Tippit said, "because I realized that much of the peoples' openness
is due to our martyrs" and the prayers of the persecuted for their persecutors.

More than 65,000 people in Costa Rica turned out Feb. 8-11 for a crusade

There is a deep spiritual hunger among people in Haiti, who are suffering
from an "identity crisis" in the wake of voodoo's failure to defeat the U.S.
invasion last fall, Youth With A Mission's Haiti Director Terry Snow told NIRR.
Before U.S. forces entered the country, voodoo priests, called hogans, conducted
animal sacrifices in military barracks and performed ceremonies to thwart the
invasion. The successful campaign discredited the religion, Snow said. "When
they lost voodoo, they lost their identity. But we are showing them they can have
a new identity in Christ." 
<BR>...After last month's annual Haiti for Jesus conference (NIRR 1/23/95),
more than 350 Haitians have made decisions for Christ, including 80 after one
drama presentation. "We've never seen anything like that," Snow said. During

A program that has a 70% success rate at helping rescue troubled marriages among Catholics has been adapted for a wider audience. Retrouvaille
(French for recovery), which began in Quebec in 1977, is used by Catholics in
36 states and seven countries (NIRR Special Supplement 11/1/93). Unlike
programs designed to improve basically sound marriages, Retrouvaille is for
couples "in misery" who are barely tolerating each other, said Angela Dunbar.
She and her husband, Loren, "translated" Retrouvaille materials, with the Catholic Church's permission, to a version suitable for Protestants. The Dunbars, who
are Protestant, learned about Retrouvaille after facing problems in their marriage.
<BR>...Retrouvaille starts with a group-weekend at a hotel or retreat center. But
participants are not expected to talk about their problems to the group. Instead,
they are asked 13 questions about communication, sex, money, in-laws, and the
like. For each question, the couple retires to their room to write answers individually. Then, if possible, they discuss the answers with each other before returning to the group.
<BR>...Six structured follow-up sessions over the next three months build on
communications skills and insights learned about each other during the initial
weekend. Retrouvaille doesn't ask couples to forgive each other until about the
fifth session, because doing so earlier is too hard for many people, Angela said.
For information, call the Dunbars at (505) 281-9576.

Accountants from a private firm are combing through records at the church's

The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to decide whether a state can prevent
local governments from enacting measures aimed at protecting the civil rights of
homosexuals. At issue is a Colorado constitutional amendment that would forbid
the state or local jurisdictions from assigning protected status to homosexuals.
Voters in the state approved Amendment 2 in 1992, but the state Supreme Court
struck it down the following year. The ruling came after homosexuals and the
cities of Denver, Boulder, and Aspen challenged the measure. The court suggested last year that if the state wanted to protect the religious freedom of landlords
and employers opposed to homosexuality, it could permit religious exemptions to
anti-discrimination laws. The court also said that although parents have a constitutional right to teach their own values to their children, there is no requirement
that the government endorse those values.

One of the most important free-speech cases in several years is coming
up before the Supreme Court, religious rights groups say. The high court is set to
review a ruling that forced Ohio officials to let the Ku Klux Klan exhibit a 10foot cross in a public park in Columbus for Christmas in 1993 (NIRR 12/13/93).
The state argued that a cross so close to the Statehouse would lead people to
think Ohio was endorsing Christianity. Lower courts in the case, Capitol Square
Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette, ruled for the KKK. They stressed the
government's duty to be impartial in allowing the use of any public forum. But
in similar cases, federal appeals courts have disagreed, stressing government
separation from religion. 
<BR>...The case "will finally deal with the issue of private displays of religious
symbols on public properties," said Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law
and Justice. Mathew Staver of Liberty Counsel said losing the case would "open
the floodgates to censor religious speech."

Police arrested an Albuquerque, N.M., mother for slapping her teen-age
son after he defied her. Valerie Chino, who works at the private Christian school
her two boys attend, was charged with battery because she slapped Earl Chino,
13. The boy was fighting with his 12-year-old brother when she attempted to
break up the altercation. Earl then yelled that he did not have to obey her. After
she slapped him, he called Albuquerque police, who took his mother away in
handcuffs, according to her attorney, David Reynolds.
<BR>...Valerie Chino has a right to administer reasonable physical discipline
under common law and because of her religious belief in corporal punishment,
said Reynolds of the Rutherford Institute. A trial is set for late this month.

Throngs of angry Muslims protested in the streets of Lahore, Pakistan,
after an appeals court dismissed charges against two Christians. Salamat Masih
and Rehmat Masih had been sentenced to hang for allegedly insulting Islam in
graffiti (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/022095.html">NIRR 2/20</A>). The two-judge Lahore High Court said there was insufficient evidence to hold them. The justices also warned against the spread of
Muslim extremism and called on the government to take actions to control it. In
the streets outside the court, militants vowed to kill the defendants, judges, and
lawyers in the case. Denmark offered the two Christians asylum, and a day later
they were whisked aboard a plane for Europe.

The activities of former TV evangelist Robert Tilton and his Dallas-based
Word of Faith ministry are protected by freedom of religion, an appeals court in
Oklahoma City ruled. It upheld a 1993 decision in a lawsuit by three Tulsa
women. Two of them claimed they suffered distress because Tilton kept sending
solicitations to their husbands after his ministry was notified that they had died.
The third claimed she lost her house because she sent Tilton money. James
Garrett, chief judge of the appeals court, said solicitation of funds "is the rule
and not the exception" in most denominations. The fact that letters kept coming
does not diminish Tilton's rights, he said.

A red cloth that once covered a painting of Jesus was left hanging on a
high school wall to protest a court order that brought the painting down. School
officials in Bloomingdale, Mich., removed the picture during a midnight prayer
ceremony last month. They have appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme
Court. A federal district court ordered the copy of Warner Sallman's Head of
Christ removed after an agnostic student, Eric Pensinger, successfully sued the
school district. He claimed the picture violated his rights. The court allowed the
picture to remain covered during two years of appeals (NIRR 9/19/94).

Several members of the 100-voice Swarthmore College chorus are
refusing to sing Johann Sebastian Bach's St. John Passion. They say it smacks of
anti-Semitism with its story of Jewish demands for the death of Jesus. The
chorus is scheduled to sing at a gathering next month. A Jewish religion major
first raised the objection after reading the English translation of the piece, news
reports said. Since then, debate about the issue has swept across the Quakerfounded liberal arts college outside Philadelphia.

The KGB is trying to thwart International Russian Radio/TV, according to
John Haukka, director of North American affairs for the group. The ministry
broadcasts the gospel on state radio and television networks to 300 million
people in the former Soviet Union. On Feb. 8, its Moscow office and equipment
were taken over illegally by its office manager, a Christian pastor, Haukka told
NIRR. Although the pastor later confessed betrayal and returned the equipment,
the building already had been sold.
<BR>...Judging from past experiences "the footsteps lead suspiciously to the
KGB," Haukka said. In 1990, a KGB agent posing as a Christian obtained
employment at the studio in Finland and began collecting information on the
ministry. The plan was exposed after he defected to Sweden, became a Christian,
and revealed everything to Haukka's brother, Hannu, founder and president of
the ministry. "Forgive me," the agent told him, "I was sent to destroy you, but
couldn't go through with it."  
<BR>...IRR/TV "has been a ministry of miracles since day one," Haukka said.
Originally producing underground videos, the ministry was offered a contract to
air its programming on Channel 1, the state supported network, after a brief clip
generated thousands of requests for similar shows. "We aired a whole year of
Christian programming with the Communists still in power -- that's the biggest
miracle of all," Haukka said. When communist leaders, vexed by the queries of
their watching grandchildren, tried to have the shows blocked, the entire programming department of Channel 1 threatened to quit, according to Haukka.

Victims of clergy abuse urged a panel of Catholic bishops to turn over
suspected pedophiles to police and stop trying to handle matters themselves.
"Bishops shouldn't be doing the investigation of criminals," said Barbara Blaine
of SNAP, the Chicago-based Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.
SNAP also asked that every U.S. bishop give them names of abusive priests who
pleaded guilty or were permanently removed from ministry, according to Religion News Service. The group reportedly maintains a database of more than 550
abusive priests, culled from court records, media reports, and its 2,100 members.
<BR>...It was the first time representatives of SNAP met with the seven-member
sexual abuse panel, which reviews policy on clergy misconduct for the nation's
185 Catholic dioceses. The panel took no action on the SNAP requests.

Contemporary Christian music has become the fastest-growing form of
popular music in the United States, according to The Gospel Music Association.
Record sales and concert receipts total $1 billion a year. Recordings by Petra,
DC Talk, Sandi Patty, Michael W. Smith, and Steven Curtis Chapman all have
sold at or above a million copies. Outselling them all is Amy Grant, 34, who has
sold 15 million secular and religious records in her 17-year career. Ten years
ago, fewer than 200 stations played contemporary Christian music. Now there are
more than 500, Forbes magazine reported.
<BR>...Corporate executives have taken notice. Three years ago, all of the record
companies producing contemporary Christian music were independently owned,
The New York Times reported. They have since been bought out by large music
companies. Also, many prominent secular record labels and music-publishing
firms are creating contemporary Christian music divisions.

CBS-TV ordered a new batch of episodes of Christy, a series based on the
life of the mother of the late Christian writer Catherine Marshall (NIRR
11/28/94). The show's Hollywood producer, Ken Wales, an evangelical, said
high ratings accounted for the CBS move. The initial eight-segment series and a
Thanksgiving special garnered "Super Bowl numbers" in parts of the Midwest,
he told Religion News Service. New episodes may start airing this month.
<BR>...Religion, spirituality, and family issues increasingly will be common
themes on prime-time TV, NBC President Warren Littlefield predicted. NBC was
ready when actress Patty Duke last year proposed a show starring her as a

A national poll of children 10 to 16 found that large numbers of kids are
concerned about the influence of the mass media on values. Among the findings:
66% of respondents said they think people their age are influenced by what they
see on TV; 65% said some TV shows encourage children to disrespect their
parents; 62% said that sex in TV shows and movies influences kids to have sex.
Yet 82% believed TV should help teach children right from wrong, according to
Children Now, the advocacy group that commissioned the survey.

An independent Christian movie producer is trying to demonstrate to
Hollywood that people want to see more wholesome movies. Sybil Robson left
Universal Studios and formed her own production company, Robson Entertainment, to make films that reflect positive values. Originally from Oklahoma,
Robson said parents are dissatisfied with movies. "When I go home and they
find out I'm a producer, they come out with their rolling pins," she told NIRR.
Her company's first production, Gordy, is for parents and children, Robson said.
The movie is about a pig who keeps his vow to save his family from the sausage
factory. "He is a promise-keeping pig," Robson said. The movie is scheduled to
open in 1,000 theaters May 5, but free previews will be shown in 100 cities
March 25. Robson encouraged people who wish to show Hollywood they want
more family entertainment to come to the free screenings. To find the nearest

Pat Robertson sold his two Washington, D.C.-based radio news services,
StandardNews and ZapNews, to Major Networks, Inc., of Chicago. The two
services were owned by Broadcast Equities, Inc., a subsidiary of U.S. Media
Corp., part of Robertson's Virginia Beach-based Christian Broadcasting Network.
StandardNews, started in January 1993, has a staff of about 50 and provides
hourly newscasts to some 600 stations across the country. ZapNews, acquired in
September 1993, has about 10 employees and serves 300 broadcast-outlet
subscribers, according to CBN spokesman Gene Kapp. Under the agreement, BEI
laid off about 20 members from the staffs, said Roy Simpson, vice president of
radio for Major Networks.

Marijuana use among American youth is increasing. Twice as many juveniles tried pot last year than in 1992, according to a University of Michigan study.
"It's time to sound the alarm," said Lee Brown, director of the White House
Office on Drug Control Policy. The potency of today's marijuana is five to 10
times that of the marijuana of the 1950s, Brown said. A popular new way to
smoke marijuana is with "blunts," gutted cigars stuffed with pot.

are leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention and a number of pro-life and
other groups, including Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council.
They cite a past that included more abortions than he initially reported as well as
controversial medical procedures.

The Bible Roadmap Series is a correspondence course for Bible study
over the Internet. The course, written by Monroe Hawley of Michigan Christian
College, is a 30-lesson study that takes readers through the Bible. Jim Hill, a
systems engineer at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, decided to
introduce the course after more than 60,000 people signed up for another study
program on the Internet. Participants will receive the materials free through their
electronic mail boxes. They also will be paired with an "instructor," a volunteer
layperson who will offer assistance and grade the material. Thirty people volunteered to be instructors. Hill anticipates the program will be ready early this
month. For more information contact Hill at (205) 731-9570 or through the
Internet at jim@jsf.uab.edu.

A Connecticut pastor performed the wedding ceremony for his son's
killer. Walter Everett, pastor of The United Methodist Church of Hartford,
Conn., officiated at the nuptials of Michael Carlucci last November. Carlucci
pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the second degree for shooting Scott Everett to
death in 1987. He received a 10-year sentence, which was suspended after five.
While Carlucci was in prison, Everett corresponded with, and eventually visited
him. Carlucci told him that, after receiving Everett's first letter, he knelt in his
prison cell and asked God for forgiveness. In the prison, after an hour-long
discussion, the two men stood, shook hands, embraced, and cried, Everett said.
Christians "won't be able to understand why Jesus came and what Jesus is all
about unless we forgive," he said. Carlucci runs a trucking business and spends
his spare time speaking to inmates about what God has done in his life.

<B>Nearly 1,000 volunteers spent a weekend behind bars with 15,000 criminals in
a dozen prisons in the Huntsville, Texas, area last month</B>. The volunteers came
from 34 states and various walks of life, donating their time and paying all trip
expenses. They were organized by Bill Glass Ministries of Cedar Hill, Texas.
BGM also organized a large outreach this month in 18 prison yards in the
Fresno, Calif., area. Some 468 counselors ministered to 16,000 inmates during
the weekend there.
<BR><B>...The outreach weekends involve group and individual ministry</B>. Professional
athletes and entertainers talk about their faith, then the volunteer counselors visit
the inmates one-on-one in prison cafeterias, recreation areas, and some living
areas. In Huntsville, 3,727 inmates made decisions to become a Christian or to
recommit their lives to Christ, and in Fresno the number was 2,096, Christian
Henderson of Bill Glass Ministries told NIRR. Those who make commitments
to Christ are referred to the prison chaplain for an eight-week Bible study. Last
year, BGM went into 201 correctional institutions and held 21 similar but smaller
events, the ministry said.
<BR><B>...Glass, a former defensive end for the Cleveland Browns and a graduate of Fort
Worth's Southwestern Theological Seminary, has ministered in more than 1,000
prisons in 25 years</B>. The ministry operates on a $2.1 million budget, $1.8 million
of which goes to the prison efforts, the rest to youth events. The ministry's

<B>Most Americans take grocery stores for granted -- but a supermarket opened
largely by Christians in one of the country's poorest inner-city neighborhoods has
been like manna from heaven, residents say</B>. Residents of the Central Ward area
in Newark, N.J., worked through a community development corporation to bring
a Pathmark supermarket to their neighborhood, an area deserted by major chains
after the 1967 riots. New Community Corporation, established and chaired by
William Linder, pastor of Newark's St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church, worked
for 10 years to cut red tape so the land could be cleared and dilapidated
buildings on the site torn down.
<BR><B>...New Community owns two-thirds of the store</B>. It funnels its share of the profits
from the 53,000-square-foot store, which grosses yearly sales of $21 million, into
community projects. New Community owns 18 housing developments in four
cities and runs an employment services center, credit union, nursing home,
job-training program, and child-care center. Upcoming ventures include a factory
for manufacturing low-income rental housing and a program to train young auto
mechanics.
<BR><B>...The supermarket reduced grocery bills by 38% as compared with high-priced
convenience stories, a study showed</B>. The Pathmark created 240 union jobs with
health benefits and potential for upward mobility in the chain.
<BR><B>...The Pathmark has become a community center for the 98,000 Central Ward
residents who live within its one-mile radius, Linder said</B>. "There was no place
where people could gather that was their own," he told NIRR. Some 50,000
people a week shop at the store or go there just to chat with friends, and "there
is a tremendous sense of community," said the priest, who almost daily strolls
through the store talking with people. 
<BR><B>...The Central Ward has had a "renaissance" of church construction in the last
three years, Linder said</B>. Churches are growing, almost every congregation in the
neighborhood has a capital improvement project, and several Baptist and African
Methodist Episcopal churches are considering starting schools. "There is a lot
more hope here, and a sense that there is a future," he said. NIRR 5/27/96

<B>Some 5,000 drug addicts are getting help through One Church-One Addict
(NIRR 3/21/94)</B>. The 2-year-old interfaith program, founded by Catholic priest
George Clements, mobilizes churches -- as well as some synagogues and
mosques -- to "adopt" one drug addict. "Drugs are no respecter of
denominations," Clements told NIRR. "I have yet to meet the first pusher who
wanted to know your religious identity before he sells you drugs."
<BR><B>...Each team of five or six volunteers functions as a support group for one addict</B>.
OCOA trains the volunteers, who then get involved with a recovering addict and
"stay involved over the long haul for as long as it takes," Clements said. The
volunteers help the addict find job training, psychological or spiritual counseling,
and referrals to professional treatment. Team members meet regularly with the
addict and make themselves available at all times for emergencies, particularly
if there are signs of relapse, Clements said. 
<BR><B>...One Church-One Addict has sponsored 30 "recovery revivals" during which
groups of churches hold a service for addicts and their families</B>. The services use
a crusade format -- including a choir, preacher, and altar call -- and emphasize
recovery from addiction, Clements said. More than 3,000 people attended one
such service in New Orleans in January 1995. Six of those attending "refused to
go home" and signed up on the spot to commit themselves to treatment centers,
he said. Other revivals have been held in Miami, Milwaukee, Chicago, and
Baltimore. One Church-One Addict is active or developing programs among
congregations in 31 states. NIRR 5/27/96

<B>Public schools need help from their communities, and Christians are beginning
to respond</B>. Church members are giving their prayers, friendship, and time to
public school children, teachers, and administrators through two programs
sponsored by the Christian Educators Association International. Volunteers in
Adopt A Teacher and Adopt A School pray for the schools. They also provide
assistance to teachers, coaches, principals, nurses, librarians, school board
members, and guidance counselors by doing anything from correcting spelling
tests to organizing the schools' tutoring programs. This provides assistance that
overworked teachers and staff are hard-pressed to give. 
<BR><B>...Involved Christians "earn the right to be heard and be an influence" in the
schools, where more than 90% of the country's students attend, CEAI Executive
Director Forrest Turpen told NIRR</B>. The 6,000-member group offers liability
insurance and various resources as alternatives to the more liberal National
Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. CEAI is
planning a convention July 31-Aug. 4 in Memphis and a national consultation
next spring. For more information, contact the CEAI at (818) 798-1124. NIRR

<B>Christians in 170 nations participated in the annual March for Jesus May 25</B>. The
worldwide festival began in New Zealand and spread westward as nation after
nation began marches "following the sun around the globe," MFJ Americas
coordinator Tom Pelton told NIRR. As many as 100,000 marchers from 100
cities and towns in New Zealand were expected to participate, organizers said.
In America, more than 600 cities planned to hold marches with a total of 1
million participants, Pelton said. 
<BR><B>...Marches also were scheduled in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe</B>. Tiny
island nations such as Malta, Sri Lanka, and Reunion, off the coast of
Madagascar, were holding marches, according to MFJ. In England, where the
first March for Jesus was held nine years ago, marchers in 45 cities released
balloons symbolizing the spread of the gospel. Each site released 233 balloons,
one for every nation in the world, Pelton said. In China and other countries
where marches could not be held, Christians were planning silent prayer walks.

<B>Some 125,000 people attended rallies, luncheons, and various other events
through the third week of May during Luis Palau's two-month Say Yes Chicago
evangelistic campaign (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/040196.html">NIRR 4/1</A>)</B>. Events included a gathering of 18,000 young

attended parenting seminars conducted by youth evangelist Ron Hutchcraft, and
79 indicated they had prayed to commit their lives to Christ.
<BR><B>...Palau has been leading callers to profess faith in Christ during a nightly radio
call-in show he is hosting during the crusade</B>. One caller confessed she had an
abortion and made a profession of faith. Two days later, she came to a crusade
event along with six of her family members, who all made professions of faith
in Christ, campaign spokesman Jerry Vreeman said.
<BR><B>...There has been "phenomenal participation and mutual respect, love, and
support" among the city's ethnic church leaders during the crusade, Vreeman told
NIRR</B>. But it will take time before that unity "filters down" and Chicago's laity
begin working together in large numbers across racial lines, said Vreeman, noting
that attendance at some Say Yes Chicago events fell below expectations.
"Chicago is an apartheid town," he said. "We are struggling with all those

<B>Twenty-six teen-age gang members in Costa Rica made professions of faith after
a minister preached to them</B>. Ronald Villalobos, a Christ For the Cities
missionary, confronted gang members after learning they had killed a man.
Although he could not locate the abandoned house where they lived, "God told
him where to find it," CFC's Paul Landry told NIRR. Villalobos and a colleague
befriended the boys, all under 14 years old, and eventually led them to Christ.
Of the 26 boys, 14 are "walking with the Lord," according to Landry.   
<BR><B>...Villalobos operates the Zoe Youth Project and Children's Home in San Jose
for homeless boys and girls</B>. More than 45,000 young people, mostly aged 8-13,
are involved in drugs and prostitution in San Jose. Villalobos builds relationships
with them by providing food and medical care. The street kids are encouraged
to visit a "drop-in center" for daily devotions, meals, and activities. Those who
respond move into the ministry's group home, where they receive Christian

Among the responses: 
Starting Over, broadcast April 14, reportedly was the most-watched program in South Africa's history after
the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela.  
Five people at a television station in Mexico became Christians after the broad- cast. The program generated
more calls than any other in the past, officials said. 
At a maximum-security prison in Ukraine, 16 convicts became Christians through the show. "Eight times
I have been imprisoned for crimes, but now I have gained real freedom," a prisoner
said.  
In a city in Moldova, a local coordinator asked the mayor to arrange for several city districts to receive
uninterrupted electrical power during the broadcast; due to rationing, the power usually is cut off part of each day.

<B>An Episcopal Church ruling opens the door for homosexual ordinations and
threatens to split the denomination further</B>. In a decision May 15, a church court
ruled 7-1 that Episcopal doctrine does not bar ordination of practicing
homosexuals. Until now, only married heterosexuals, celibate single
heterosexuals, and celibate homosexuals could be ordained.
<BR><B>...The ruling spares Bishop Walter Righter a heresy trial</B>. Righter ordained Barry
Stopfel as a deacon in 1990 even though he knew Stopfel was involved in a
long-term homosexual relationship. The court said Righter, 72, now retired, can
continue to perform priestly duties. Had he been tried and found guilty of heresy,
he would not have been allowed to perform priestly duties. The bishops, meeting
in the sanctuary of the Cathedral Church of St. John in Wilmington, Del., said
a heresy trial would be a poor way to resolve the issue of homosexual ordination.
They suggested the issue should be dealt with by the full membership, possibly
at its next general convention, scheduled for July 1997 in Philadelphia. Those
delegates might enact a canon, or law of the church, making it clear whether
noncelibate homosexuals could be ordained. 
<BR><B>...The bishops made no judgment about whether homosexual relationships are
moral or whether the church should ordain people in open homosexual
relationships, they said</B>. Instead, they decided the narrower issue of whether a
bishop "is restrained from ordaining persons living in a committed same-gender
sexual relationship," Delaware Bishop Cabell Tennis announced in the nearly full
church. 
<BR><B>...Righter said he hoped the decision meant there are "no outcasts" in the
Episcopal Church</B>. "We're making too much out of bedrooms. The question isn't
gay. It's what kind of relationship do they have. Is it monogamous?" Bishop
John Spong of Newark said the church should realize that gays "are not evil."
<BR><B>...Only Bishop Andrew Fairfield of North Dakota dissented in his vote, arguing
that the Bible forbids homosexual activity</B>. He read aloud from his opinion as
Stopfel and companion Will Stecke, who were sitting in the third row, shook
their heads in disapproval. "Currently it is popular to speculate that Jesus would
treat homosexual people in the same way he treated tax collectors and other
outcasts -- that he would go to their homes, identify with them," Fairfield said.
"This is probably so. But he would not bless their activity, just as he would not
bless the activity of [dishonest] tax collectors and others such as the woman
caught in adultery."
<BR><B>...Observers said the decision could lead additional members to leave the
denomination, which has dropped to 2.5 million from a high of 3.6 million in the
1960s</B>. The decision will result in "still more anarchy and conflict" in the
denomination, said Todd Wetzel, executive director of Episcopalians United,
which says it represents 25,000 conservative church members. Now that the
church "denies the sanctity of marriage, on what basis will it ask priests to honor
the sanctity of marriage?" Wetzel asked. The only major Christian church that
allows ordination of noncelibate homosexuals is the United Church of Christ.

receiving the sacraments, which will be left up to the person's conscience. An

<B>The Supreme Court's decision to strike down a Colorado state constitutional
amendment banning gay-rights laws (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6/95</A>) does not necessarily pave the
way for other homosexual victories, news reports said</B>. Government still will be
able to make a case that some restrictions on homosexuals -- barring sodomy,
same-sex marriages, and homosexuals in the military -- serve a legitimate
governmental interest. The ruling also does not declare that homosexuals are a
separate, protected class, as are blacks.
<BR><B>...But the decision was the first Supreme Court ruling sympathetic to homosexual
rights</B>. It upholds laws in many communities that prohibit discrimination against
homosexuals. And it could slow a movement by groups to repeal those laws,
though opponents said they remain undaunted. "We'll redouble our efforts," said
Jim Woodall of Concerned Women for America.
<BR><B>...The Colorado measure, called Amendment 2, placed homosexuals "in a solitary
class" in violation of the U.S</B>. Constitution's equal protection guarantee, said
Justice Anthony Kennedy. He was joined in the 6-3 majority by Justices Stevens,
O'Connor, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer. Suzanne Goldberg of the Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund said the court had rejected "gay-bashing by
referendum."
<BR><B>...Petitions to place a referendum like Colorado's on the November ballot are
circulating in Idaho, Ore., and Washington</B>. Voters in Maine defeated a similar
proposal last year. City governments in Florida, Oregon, and Ohio have taken a
similar approach through local ordinances. Last year, a federal appeals court
upheld a Cincinnati ordinance that stripped homosexuals of civil rights
protections in a case that is on appeal to the Supreme Court.                       
<BR><B>...Justice Antonin Scalia scolded the court for "taking sides in the culture wars."
The ruling has "no foundation in American constitutional law, and barely
pretends to," he said, taking the unusual step of reading his dissent aloud in
court</B>. Justices Rehnquist and Thomas joined the dissent, saying the Colorado
amendment was a reasonable means of preventing "piecemeal deterioration of the
sexual morality." Voters approved Amendment 2 by 53% in 1992, but it never
was enforced because of court challenges. NIRR 5/27/96

awaiting trial on related burglary and theft charges. Prison officials have not said
what is on the tape. Prosecutor Doug Harcleroad, who arranged the taping, said
his office is thinking about using the tape in court but also is considering the
archdiocese's request that it be destroyed. Harcleroad said it is the first time his
office tried to listen to such a conversation.
<BR><B>...At issue is whether the conversation is privileged</B>. Church law "forbids any
confessor to betray a penitent by any means for any reason whatsoever," Bishop
Kenneth Steiner said, denouncing the taping. Oregon law says conversations
between clergy and their followers are confidential, but another state law allows
taping of jail conversations except those between lawyer and client. NIRR

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. They represented more than 75% of all
missions work originating from the United States, said Richard Cizik of the
National Association of Evangelicals, who arranged the meeting. The
organizations object to CIA Director John Deutch's policy that, under special
circumstances, the agency can waive a prohibition against using religious
workers. 
<BR><B>...The statement "puts a target on our chests," Wycliffe's David Farah told NIRR</B>.
In some developing countries "many people believe there are CIA infiltrators
among the missionaries. When the director says that, it strengthens their case and
weakens us." The groups made it clear to the staff that the CIA should not be
allowed to initiate contacts with religious workers and that missions groups could
not associate with the agency, even to receive help for the recovery of hostages,
Cizik said. They also signed a statement with other missions agencies calling for
Congress and President Clinton to bar the waiver. In a letter to Deutch, Sen.
Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) said using religious workers for intelligence work
"prostitutes the church." NIRR 5/27/96
<P>
<B>The government should be doing more to solve a rash of arson fires at black
churches, lawmakers and church leaders said during a House Judiciary
Committee hearing May 21 (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/020596.html">NIRR 2/5</A>)</B>. Rep. Donald Payne (D-N.J.) and Rep.
Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-Texas) criticized the government for taking so long to
schedule a hearing into 25 arsons since January. They also questioned whether
the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have committed
enough resources to investigating the fires. The FBI has about 100 agents
checking church fires, as does the ATF. 
<BR><B>...No evidence has been found of an interstate or national conspiracy to burn the
churches, Deval Patrick, assistant attorney general for civil rights, told the
committee</B>. But leaders of the National Council of Churches said they found
"striking similarities" in burned churches they visited, including use of molotov
cocktails, racist graffiti, targeting of churches that advocated African-American
rights, and racist letters left in pastors' mailboxes. White hate groups are growing
fast, yet "most of the country remains in a state of denial," the NCC said. NIRR

<B>Eugene Habecker, president and chief executive officer of the American Bible
Society, was elected last month as chair man of the executive committee of the
United Bible Societies, a world fellowship of 120 national groups</B>. The executive
committee implements policies set by the World Assembly, the UBS' highest
governing body. Habecker will continue in his role as head of the New
York-based ABS. Bible societies are helping translate Scripture into 681
languages in 200 countries and territories. In recent years they have been
involved in Bible distribution in China and central and eastern Europe. Members
include Protestants, Catholics, and Orthodox.
<P>
<B>Jews for Jesus named David Brickner, 37, as executive director to replace
Moishe Rosen, 64, who stepped down from the position (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/051396.html">NIRR 5/13</A>)</B>. Brickner
headed the evangelistic group's New York branch. He is a minister ordained by
the Baptist General Conference and a member of a Messianic congregation.
Brickner was raised in a Jewish Christian home, and his mother is a
fourth-generation Jewish believer, JFJ said. He said he will use new means of
communicating the gospel, including multimedia, video, and the Internet.
<P>
<B>The Salvation Army gave Franklin Graham its William Booth Award for his
work as president of Samaritan's Purse</B>. Graham was praised for "dynamic
leadership and service," especially to children in war-torn areas. Samaritan's
Purse operates a village for orphans in Rwanda and last year it collected,
shipped, and distributed more than 800,000 gift-filled shoe boxes to children in
Bosnia and Rwanda. The Salvation Army has cooperated with the Boone,
N.C.-based agency in several relief efforts. 
<P>
<B>John Wesley White's condition remained stable and he may be allowed to go
home soon, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association said (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/051396.html">NIRR 5/13</A>)</B>. White,
a 67-year-old associate evangelist with the BGEA, suffered a stroke after
preaching April 27. Franklin Graham will preach White's June crusade in
Portsmouth, Va. 
<P>
<B>Prince Philip presented Bill Bright with the $1.05 million Templeton Prize during
a ceremony at Buckingham Palace in London May 8 (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/031896.html">NIRR 3/18</A>)</B>. Bright, 74,
the founder of Campus Crusade for Christ, also was honored May 9 during a
ceremony at Santa Maria Catholic Church in Rome.
<P>
<B>The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel re-elected John Holland to
a third four-year term as president</B>.  The unanimous election came in Pasadena,
Calif., last month during the denomination's 73rd international convention, which
included ministers and delegates from 24 countries. The 2-million-member
denomination, based in Los Angeles, has 19,060 congregations in 72 countries,
including 1,742 in the United States. It was founded by Aimee Semple
McPherson in 1927.
<P>
<B>University of Florida quarterback and Heisman Trophy nominee Danny Wuerffel
turned down Playboy magazine's Scholar-Athlete Award</B>. "It's not something I
want to be associated with," he told Baptist Press. Wuerffel attends a Baptist
church in High Springs, Fla., and has spoken at churches, True Love Waits
rallies, and youth conferences.
<P>
<B>Evangelist James Robison, 52, has adopted a talk-show format on his television
program</B>. Robison, who has been preaching in stadiums and on television for 30
years, said his Life Today show is reaching people who would not otherwise
watch a TV evangelist. The show is seen on the Inspirational Network, Family
Channel, Trinity Broadcasting Network, and Vision TV in Canada.       
<P>
<B>Mayor Marion Barry of Washington, D.C., (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/010995.html">NIRR 1/9/95</A>) took a sudden leave
of absence to deal with what he described as physical exhaustion and to seek
spiritual renewal</B>. When he returned, Barry told city employees that spiritual
renewal means "a more active, stronger, and reciprocal relationship with the God
of my understanding -- who, for me, is Jesus Christ." 
<P>
<B>Episcopal Bishop Edward Chalfant resigned as head of the Diocese of Maine</B>. He
took a leave of absence last month after revelations that he had been involved
in an extramarital relationship. In his statement, Chalfant said he had caused
"great pain and heartbreak to my wife, placed the church in embarrassment and
risk, and involved another human being in a painful situation."
<P>
<B>Supreme Court justices "don't decide cases by referring to the Bible," Justice
Clarence Thomas said</B>. But Thomas said his faith is important to him and he will
keep speaking about it publicly. He addressed about 9,000 people May 11 during
graduation ceremonies at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., which is led by
Chancellor Jerry Falwell.
<P>
<B>Dr</B>. Jack Kevorkian described his attitude about religion on CBS' 60 Minutes.
Religious believers base their laws and "whole outlook...on mythology. Religion
is an internal, spiritual world. And I have my own with my god, Johann
Sebastian Bach. Why not? You invent gods...At least he's not invented."

<B>Canada: About 1,000 people became Christians during a five-day Franklin
Graham crusade in Niagara Falls, Ontario</B>. The 140 participating churches
"witnessed one of the greatest evangelistic efforts many of us have ever seen,"
according to Reed Cooke, chairman of the local crusade committee. The crusade
included contemporary Christian music for youth and a luncheon for seniors. 
<P>
<B>The Walking on Water Club, a high school Bible club in Roslyn, N.Y., can
require its leaders to be Christians, the 2nd U.S</B>. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled.
Roslyn High School officials, backed by a judge's ruling, refused to recognize
the group. They argued that the club's constitution -- which disallows members
of other religions or atheists to lead the group -- discriminated against
non-Christians and violated the school district's anti-bias rules. 
<P>
<B>The National Council of Churches will hold rallies to raise money and awareness
about black churches firebombed and vandalized (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/030496.html">NIRR 3/4</A>)</B>. Some 45 churches
in Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Florida, and Virginia
have been bombed, burned, or defaced since 1990. Most are poor, with little or
no insurance. The NCC established the Burned Churches Fund to aid the
churches; contributions may be to sent to NCC headquarters, 475 Riverside
Drive, Room 880, New York, NY 10115. In hopes of stopping the crimes, the
Christian Coalition offered a $25,000 reward to anyone who proves that racism
motivated the arsons.
<P>
<B>Texas Gov</B>. George W. Bush wants to remove unnecessary regulations that affect
community-service programs run by denominations and parachurch groups. He
has created a 17-member task force that will "identify ways Texas can create an
environment where faith-based organizations will flourish." Lt. Col. Jack Waters
of Dallas, state commander of The Salvation Army, said that church-based
programs can provide resources "without crossing over the chalk lines" of
church-state separation. 
<P>
<B>Former President George Bush joined Operation Blessing International founder
Pat Robertson in commissioning the relief ministry's $25-million, 177-foot
Flying Hospital this month (NIRR 10/31/94)</B>. The L-1011 plane will be used in
impoverished nations and disaster-stricken areas. It contains a surgical facility
with three operating and two dental stations to be used by a medical staff of 17.
The plane has a sleeping section for 67 and a large storage area. It will make its
first relief trip in June to El Salvador, followed by trips to Ukraine and India. 
<P>
<B>A former church secretary has been sentenced to two years in prison for stealing
$411,000 in $20 bills from collection plates</B>. Linda Siefer, 39, was ordered to
repay St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church in Kalida, Ohio, where she had
worked for 19 years. Her husband, Daniel, has been charged with one count of
receiving stolen property. Siefer had been counting the money from collection
plates and depositing it in the bank. A bank employee discovered the scam after
realizing that no $20 bills ever were deposited. The Siefers owned a Corvette and
two sport vehicles, took yearly vacations to Disney World, and bought an
expensive house with a swimming pool.
<P>
<B>Thirty-one groups that lost money when the Foundation for New Era
Philanthropy went bankrupt sued the charity's broker for $90 million</B>. The
evangelical ministries, colleges, seminaries, and other nonprofit groups filed a
civil racketeering suit May 7 against Prudential Securities, Inc., and Stuart
Bianchi, a Kenosha, Wis., Prudential broker. Bianchi opened fictitious escrow
accounts and established a toll-free phone number to answer questions from New
Era investors, news reports said. The 31 groups say they lost $39.6 million when
New Era declared bankruptcy last May; under federal law, if racketeering is
proven, they can claim triple damages. The suit does not affect a proposal among
New Era investors in which those who benefited from New Era dealings would
voluntarily return money to those that lost funds (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/031896.html">NIRR 3/18</A>).

<B>The nation's largest independent Christian TV station, WCFC-TV38, this month
is celebrating 20 years of broadcasting in Chicago, the nation's third-largest TV

projects for the needy. The interdenominational station is expanding and has
acquired new technology. President Jerry Rose and some other employees have
been with TV38 since its beginning.

expand opportunities for the poor. The groups will provide services that support
children and families. The five participating organizations are the Greater
Minneapolis Council of Churches, Jewish Community Relations Council of
Minnesota and the Dakotas, Masjid An-Nur/Islamic Centers, St. Paul Area
Council of Churches, and TURN Leadership Foundation, which works with
evangelical churches to promote social justice.

<B>Cyprus: The attorney general in Nicosia charged two massage-parlor owners with
defaming an Orthodox priest (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/041596.html">NIRR 4/15</A>)</B>. George Koukoumas and Andreas
Tryfonos told the archbishop that the priest, Pangratios Meraclis, was gay,
leading to a church trial that eventually sparked riots by Meraclis' followers. The
charges against him were dropped. 
<P>
<B>Vietnam: A former prisoner of war returned to Hanoi "as a forgiving friend" of
the Vietnamese people</B>. Paul Kari was imprisoned for eight years in the infamous
Hanoi Hilton prison. "He stood in the doorway of the prison -- the worst of his

Children's Cup International, a ministry to Vietnam and veterans (NIRR

been unemployed for a long time, EAUK said.
<P>
<B>England: Robert Runcie, formerly the Archbishop of Canterbury and head of the
Anglican Church, said he ordained practicing homosexuals during his 10-year
tenure, news reports said</B>. Runcie later qualified his statement, saying he never
ordained anyone who had acknowledged being involved in a homosexual
relationship, but that there were times when he took a "don't ask" approach. "I
never liked the prospect of inquiring into what happened in a man's bedroom,"
he said (NIRR 1/1/90). 
<P>
<B>France: French Muslims demanded the release of seven Trappist monks abducted
by a militant Islamic group in Algiers (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/051396.html">NIRR 5/13</A>)</B>. The National Council of
Imams released a fatwa, or religious edict, declaring that kidnapping is against
Islamic law, according to news reports. "We the Muslims of France say no to
blackmail and no to kidnapping," said Abderrahmane Fahmane. 
<P>
<B>Germany: A 25-member Methodist church in Wismar helped gather and
distribute $1 million worth of relief goods, medicine, agricultural supplies, and
religious materials for needy villages in Albania</B>. The church's pastor said he
wanted to begin helping the country in the early 1980s, but could not begin until
East Germany fell in 1989. The church hopes to send a permanent missionary. 
<P>
<B>Italy: Mobsters in Sicily tried to kill an outspoken parish priest by putting
tincture of iodine in the communion wine</B>. As he celebrated Mass, Don Vittorio
Casella, who has spoken out against criminal activity and Satan worship, became
suspicious of the wine's odor. He ordered it replaced and later sent it to the
police lab. In recent months, Casella's church and car have been damaged in
attacks and he has received many threatening phone calls, according to news
reports. 
<P>
<B>Russia: The Russian and Eastern Orthodox Churches have reconciled</B>. The
question of jurisdiction over Orthodox congregations in Estonia divided the
groups (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/041596.html">NIRR 4/15</A>). This month, they agreed to share jurisdiction and let
Orthodox believers decide which branch to join. Of the country's 45,000
Orthodox, 25,000 speak Russian and probably will remain in the ROC; the
Estonian speakers probably will join the Eastern branch, news reports said.
<P>
<B>Russia: Edwin Louis Cole held a series of meetings for men last month</B>. More
than 2,000 from across the Commonwealth of Independent States came to St.
Petersburg to learn biblical principles regarding their responsibilities to God, their
families, and their countries. A televised program, directed to mafia members,
said that "manhood and Christlikeness are synonymous," Cole's Christian Men's
Network reported. CMN ministers to men in 93 nations.

<B>Christians in racially polarized Fayetteville, N.C., shine candles in their windows all year to
"symbolize the fires of revival in their souls</B>." When they see other candles around town, they
pray for blessings on each others' homes. And at 8 p.m. each night, they pray for their city.
Larry Jackson, the local pastor who started the movement, said believers from 20
congregations are participating. They say they'll keep the lights burning until they illuminate
every part of Fayetteville, Jackson told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...A recent double murder deepened the resolve of local Christians to see revival and
reconciliation in their city</B>. Police said three white soldiers from the U.S. Army's 82nd
Airborne Division at nearby Fort Bragg drove into the predominantly black Campbell Terrace
section of Fayetteville last month to harass blacks. Specialist Randy Meadows waited in the
car as Privates Malcolm Wright and James Burmeister picked victims at random and shot
them, police said. Killed were Jackie Burden, 27, and her friend Michael James, 36. The
soldiers were arrested quickly, and in Burmeister's rented room police found white
supremacist literature and a pistol they believe was used in the killings. 
<BR><B>...Fayetteville could have exploded after the "appalling tragedy," said Lee Downing, pastor of
Friendship Baptist Church, located two blocks from the site of the killings</B>. But it didn't. The
quick arrests helped quell tempers, said Downing, who is African-American. And the unity
among black and white pastors in the city allowed them to work together to help keep
Fayetteville calm. Also, the NAACP organized a forum for community leaders and citizens.  
<BR><B>...Downing and a white pastor organized a reconciliation service the following Sunday</B>. Under
the glare of the network television lights, more than 800 residents from every denomination,
political party, and race in Fayetteville overflowed the church to air their emotions. "Three
came into the neighborhood for hate, but 800 came out for healing," said Michael Fletcher of
Manna Church, Downing's white colleague and friend who helped organize the service.
Georgia Burden, Jackie Burden's aunt, spoke of forgiving the young soldiers and not hating
them. "When those who were the most injured talked about forgiveness, that was the impetus
for reconciliation," Downing said. 
<BR><B>...One of the most important steps is renewal among Fayetteville pastors, a process that is
continuing</B>. The city's business community is paying travel and admission expenses for 95
pastors to attend the Promise Keepers' clergy conference in Atlanta Feb. 13-15. This month,
Promise Keepers videotaped Jackson's and Fletcher's story of the candles and their city's
revival, which will be shown to encourage the pastors who will gather in the Georgia Dome.
This spring, North Carolina pastors will meet in Charlotte to plan for a statewide revival.       
<BR><B>..."We are going to see revival come to Fayetteville or die trying," Fletcher said</B>. A year ago,
he began working with other churches to hold racial reconciliation rallies in Campbell
Terrace. They also built playgrounds and installed peepholes in doors. In July, Fletcher and
others began prayer walks through the complex. "God, either save the drug dealers or take
them out of our town," they prayed. Within a month, God acted, Fletcher said. "The cops
began rounding [the drug dealers] up and putting them in jail." Fletcher and Downing have
organized more evangelistic outreaches in the neighborhood, including an interracial block
party held a few days before the killings. NIRR 1/22/96

<B>MAD DADS has grown to 25,000 members at 45 chapters in 13 states</B>. The men patrol urban
neighborhoods late at night to minister to runaways, drug users, and gang members. MAD
DADS stands for Men Against Destruction, Defending Against Drugs and Social Disorder. 
<BR><B>...Most of the men patrol in pairs on Friday and Saturday nights</B>. In Omaha, Neb., where the
group originated in 1989 with 18 dads, they venture out in green and black T-shirts from 10
p.m. to 4 a.m., said John Gatus, who supervises the patrols. The men report crime and drug
sales to authorities and offer to talk with parents or school counselors about the young people.
In cold or rainy weather, the men drive rather than walk around the neighborhoods. 
<BR><B>..."We tell them we love them," Gatus told NIRR</B>. "A lot of kids are out there because they
need love." The men approach each situation with a smile and a "hello" rather than an
attempt to intimidate the young people, said Gatus, 56, who has been patrolling for six years.
Yet they are respected, and sometimes challenge the behavior of drug dealers and gang
members. "Boys respect men," Gatus said. 
<BR><B>...Most of the men are Christians</B>. "We know we can't do the work without Christ," Gatus
said. Each night before going out on the streets, the men hold hands in a circle and pray; they
pray again before returning home. No one has been killed during a patrol, said Gatus, who
once had his glasses knocked to the ground and trampled when he broke up a fight. 
<BR><B>...The men started the group after seeing neighborhood children dying from violence in the
streets</B>. One of the group's founding dads, John Foster, helped organize other fathers after he
nearly used his .357 magnum on gang members who beat up his teen-age son. 
<BR><B>...The group blames uninvolved fathers for the troubles of their neighborhoods</B>. Gatus has
harsh words for fathers who are "on the couch scratching and belching," and prods them to
patrol their neighborhoods. 
<BR><B>...The men sponsor community youth activities such as block parties, rallies, car shows, and
graffiti clean-ups</B>. They also chaperon community events and visit jails and prisons to counsel
inmates. In Omaha, the dads organized gun buybacks, paying up to $50 per weapon to get
them off the streets, and helped gangs negotiate a truce. For more information, call MAD
DADS headquarters in Omaha at (402) 451-3500. NIRR 1/22/96

<B>A Nigerian couple have become missionaries to Chicago, representing the fruit of missionary
work begun 68 years ago</B>. Sunday Bwanhot, who moved to Chicago with his wife, Grace, and
their three sons last summer, is the great-grandson of Aluwong Benyan, chief of a Kagoro
village when SIM missionaries first visited there in 1927. Bwanhot worked at the
headquarters of the Evangelical Church of West Africa, the denomination that grew out of
SIM work in Nigeria, before coming to Chicago.  
<BR><B>...Bwanhot resisted coming to the West</B>. "I had heard a bit about Chicago and I didn't like the
idea at all," he told SIM NOW. "Like Jonah, I found that the more I struggled to say no, the
more I did not have the peace of God." One problem was raising money. The average
Nigerian earns about $20 a month while airfare alone for the family was $4,000. They
continue to raise support. 
<BR><B>...African-Americans attempting to understand their roots "have been deceived" into believing
that Islam is the original religion of Africa, Bwanhot said</B>. "That's really something which
only we Africans can set straight." NIRR 1/22/96

<B>Some 5 million Christians worldwide are expected to participate in Youth With A Mission's
30 Days Muslim Prayer Focus during the Islamic holiday of Ramadan</B>. From Jan. 21-Feb. 19,
Muslims will fast and pray between sunrise and sunset, and for the fifth year in a row,
Christians will be praying for them during this time (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/020795.html">NIRR 2/7/95</A>). 
<BR><B>...About 500,000 daily prayer guides in more than 20 languages have been distributed
throughout the world through 24 regional YWAM offices</B>. Twenty-five thousand prayer
guides were printed for use in the United States, compared to 3,000 three years ago. The
guide focuses on leaders, children, refugees, and unreached people in countries such as
Algeria, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, and other predominantly Muslim countries. It provides
details about the Islamic faith and Ramadan -- the high point of the Muslim calendar -- in
order to help Christians understand what Muslims believe and help dispel simplistic and
prejudicial views about them. This year's prayer guide focuses on children and families,
especially appropriate in light of a United Nations report showing that most of the world's
refugees and child victims of war are Muslims, international Muslim Prayer Focus coordinator
Kim Greig said. NIRR 1/22/96

<B>An influx of evangelical missionaries into Albania in this decade has resulted in many new
believers who are having a significant impact on society</B>. "Evangelical services have no
trouble drawing a large crowd," said Art Moore of International Teams, an umbrella agency
for 26 evangelical groups. In five years, 100 evangelical fellowships have formed with 8,000
regular attenders, a quarter of whom are committed believers, he said. The growth is the work
of 500 missionaries from 72 missionary societies, most from Western countries. They serve
through the Albanian Encouragement Project (NIRR 5/4/92), which provides resources for
missions work around the country. 
<BR><B>...The new believers have exercised influence in healthcare, education, law, and business,
Moore told NIRR</B>. For example, two evangelical lawyers helped form the country's new
judicial system.  
<BR><B>...Youth dominate the evangelical movement because "most parents say they are too old to
change," Moore said</B>. Groups such as Youth With A Mission, the Assemblies of God, and the
Albanian Bible Institute are developing young leaders for churches. Last year, churches and
schools across the country used the Alliance Youth Network's program for encouraging
young people to resist sexual immorality, he said.  
<BR><B>...Yet no evangelical church has been erected in the capital, Tirana, Moore said</B>. Presbyterian
missionary John Quanrud tried for months to gain permission to construct a church building,
but objections from a Muslim neighbor delayed the plan. While conceding the congregation's
legal right to build a church, a government official objected "from a moral point of view."
Some officials are calling for laws to restrain evangelicals while giving autonomy to Muslims,
the Orthodox, and Catholics. NIRR 1/22/96

<B>A minister is freeing slave girls from voodoo priests in Ghana</B>. Walter Pimpong, a native
Ghanian and graduate of Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Ill., travels on the
Volta River preaching and freeing girls who are shrine slaves of fetish priests. When a person
becomes sick or a village is troubled, the priest concludes there is a curse on them and
announces that the only way to appease the gods is to give him a vestal virgin as young as
age 12. There are hundreds of such girls and some bear as many as eight children by the
priests, a Ghanian newspaper said. 
<BR><B>...Pimpong risks physical harm and persecution as he brings the young women, many of
whom have been slaves for 15 years, to his school in Adidome</B>. There they are taught trades
such as dressmaking, mat-weaving, and baking, and learn the Bible. The goal is to liberate
them economically and spiritually from the priests. Last year, 23 women graduated from the
school. Family pressure forces some to return to the priests, but most remain free. Pimpong
hopes to build schools in areas where the priests are most active. One priest asked to hear
about Christ, but another offers sacrifices daily for Pimpong's destruction. NIRR 1/22/96

<B>Christians in China step up their evangelistic efforts from January to Chinese New Year, Feb</B>.
18, Jim Swanson of the Hong Kong-based Asian Outreach told NIRR. Swanson visited Henan
and Hunan provinces, key areas of Christian activity in the country, and met with 50
ministers and church leaders.  
<BR><B>...Some Chinese house churches compel members to evangelize during the Month of the
Gospel, Swanson said</B>. "Every church member is required during this month to win one
family to the Lord and bring them to church," he said. One church pastor said he will not
give communion to members who fail to convert a new family. The churches also
commission evangelists to plant new congregations during this time. People in their late teens
and early 20s are trained to be missionaries, sent out with a one-way ticket to wherever they
feel called, and expected to start at least one church in six months, Swanson said. Last year,
the young evangelists planted some 56 churches in Manchuria. 
<BR><B>...A pastor thought he should plant a church in the province, which is closed to the gospel</B>.
Later an opportunity arose for 15 evangelists to travel to a northern Manchurian city. Six
months later the city had 18 churches, with 38 more in the surrounding villages and cities.
The smallest church has 200 people and five Manchurians are being taught to train leaders for
the new churches. Most Chinese Swanson met have been Christians for only a few years and
have received little or no formal training, he said. When he asked them how they learned
principles of church planting and church growth, they told him, "The Holy Spirit reveals these
methods to us in prayer." NIRR 1/22/96

<B>Thousands of Brazilians took to the streets to protest a government investigation into their
church</B>. According to news reports, 100,000 to 200,000 supporters of the Universal Church of
the Kingdom of God in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Brasilia, the capital, marched, sang
hymns, and spoke out against the government and Globo TV, a Catholic-run television
station. Globo aired a videotape of UCKG leaders gleefully counting donations and instructing
others to intimidate followers into giving more, news reports said (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/010896.html">NIRR 1/8</A>). The videotape
was made by former UCKG minister Carlos Magno, who has been cooperating with tax
officials since 1991 in an investigation of the church. 
<BR><B>...The 3.5 million-member church has 1,800 temples in Brazil and 300 more in 30 other
countries, including the United States</B>. The church also owns a Brazilian TV network, a bank,
35 radio stations, and four newspapers. With the cooperation of Interpol, the international
police agency, Brazilian authorities also are looking into church business deals in Portugal,
Colombia, Japan, Mozambique, France, South Africa, the Cayman Islands, and the United
States. One of Magno's most serious allegations is that the church once solicited $1 million
from the Colombian Cali drug cartel to finance the purchase of its TV network.  
<BR><B>...Church officials have withdrawn their support from President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
because of the investigation</B>. The church supported the right-wing president's election in 1994,
but began seeking alliances with left-wing political parties earlier this month. Two parties
rejected the church's proposal, but another is considering it. The proposal was "a mixture of
opportunism and undue interference by religious organizations into affairs of state," a leader
of the Popular Socialist Party said. In Honduras, the government is seeking to expel 29
UKCG ministers because they are living illegally in the country and are "carrying out work
different from the tourism activities they declared when they arrived," a government official
said. The Brazilians are operating as pastors and participating in radio programs, they said.

<B>Older members of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) read the Bible more frequently than
younger members, a denominational poll found</B>. Fifty-two percent of church members 70 and
older said they read the Bible at least weekly in the past year, compared to 29% of members
under 40. As for the youngest generation, 6% said they regularly read the Bible to children
during the past year other than as part of a church class. Nearly all of those surveyed said
they read the Bible on their own during the past year, and about two-thirds of pastors said
they read Scripture daily or almost daily, according to poll findings reported by the
Associated Press. Twenty-one percent of church members said they occasionally read the
Bible or a Bible story book to a child during the past year, and 11% of households that have
other family members said they read Scripture together. 
<BR><B>..."The general paucity of family Bible reading is one of the more striking findings of this
study," said the church's Office of Research Services</B>. While that fact is "not all that
surprising," nevertheless it "tells us that the church cannot rely on family-based Bible study in
any significant way to reinforce the lessons it is trying to teach," the group said. NIRR

<B>A majority of Protestants in Poland voted against Lech Walesa in recent presidential
elections</B>. Walesa, a Catholic, lost to Aleksandr Kwasniewski, an excommunist. Heavily
Protestant areas in the south "gave a lopsided vote for Kwasniewski," Doug Larson of Youth
With A Mission-Poland told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...Under communism, Protestants were regarded as collaborators with the government because
they often were given land to build churches and allowed to receive Western aid, Larson said</B>.
When Walesa was elected president in 1991, Protestants say he threatened to rid the country
of all sects and Protestant denominations. One Pentecostal pastor told Larson that he would
get a fair deal from Kwasniewski, who promised Protestants equal protection under the law. 
<BR><B>...Most Poles say the Catholic church has gained too much influence over government, and
80% think it should stay out of politics, a survey showed</B>. Church influence helped pass laws
requiring religion in public schools to be taught by priests and nuns, making divorce more
difficult, requiring Christian standards in the media, and criminalizing abortion. The Catholic
Church's popularity now is at an all-time low, news reports said. NIRR 1/22/96

<B>The United States may be "in an Abraham moment," Republican presidential candidate Alan
Keyes is telling audiences</B>. The moral state of the country is so precarious that the only thing
restraining God's judgment is the plea of the righteous, similar to Abraham's prayers for
Sodom, Keyes said. Violence in cities and schools, social engineering, and abuses of science,
such as medical research with human fetuses, reveal the moral corruption in America, he said.
<BR><B>...The arrogance of people who hold God's laws in contempt while asserting their own desires
has caused the situation, Keyes said</B>. "Satan's sin was to [try to] be better than God, to take
His place," he told NIRR. "That hubris is clearly evidenced in our time." 
<BR><B>...America's moral crisis can be corrected only by returning to principles found in the
Declaration of Independence, which states that human rights are granted by God, Keyes said</B>.
By denying God's authority "we deny the source of that which guarantees our freedom in the
eyes of men." The Declaration is a "political expression of Christianity" because it bases
justice and human rights on inalienable, God-given rights, he said. 
<BR><B>...Keyes' opposition to abortion initially motivated him to consider a bid for the presidency to
protect the pro-life plank in the Republican Party platform from being weakened or removed,
he said</B>. Keyes' message that abortion is a moral crisis that has "destroyed family life and
unleashed a curse of violence in the streets" has struck a chord with many conservative
Christians. After a speech on James Dobson's Focus on the Family radio program, thousands
of phone calls and letters flooded the Focus office and Keyes' home. He and his wife read the
letters together. "It was a spiritual experience to hear from people grieving for the country.
We felt God was moving," Keyes said. It confirmed his decision to run for president. 
<BR><B>...Keyes, who is Catholic, credits his mother for teaching him the faith</B>. "Her relationship with
Christ was important to her and she passed that along," he said. Resolving a crisis of faith in
graduate school solidified his relationship with God. Keyes, who earned a doctorate in
government affairs from Harvard University, said academic life is designed to challenge faith
and can lead to apostasy. His mother reminded him that "no matter how much knowledge you
have, you must not lose the simple wisdom of a relationship with God," he said. NIRR

<B>The Church of England has redefined hell</B>. Rather than a place of eternal suffering, hell is a
state of nothingness, the church said. The church said it was concerned that people were
terrified into becoming believers and consequently suffered "searing psychological scars."
Bishop John Taylor, one of the report's authors, said, "The horrible demons are the
imaginations of inventors and medievalists." Nevertheless, everyone still faces a day of
judgment, according to the Anglican document, The Mystery of Salvation. Those who fail the
test are annihilated. Hell is described as the final "choosing of that which is opposed to God
so completely and so absolutely that the only end is non-being." NIRR 1/22/96

<B>An outspoken California minister has been charged with assaulting a police officer by fax in
order to help a child</B>. Austin Miles (NIRR 3/21/94) was arraigned last month in Delta
Municipal Court in Pittsburg, Calif., on charges that he published a policeman's home
address, a form of assault in violation of a 1970 state law, news reports said. He pleaded
innocent and declined to comment on the charge as about 30 supporters gathered at the
courthouse to pray for him. A hearing is set for Feb. 1. 
<BR><B>...Miles sent a 26-page fax to several thousand people nationwide</B>. It describes the plight of
6-year-old leukemia patient Adrian Chavez. The boy was taken from his home in August by
Child Protective Service officials and Sheriff's Deputy Charles Mould. He was placed in
protective custody when county officials believed his mother, Elena Duarte, was refusing to
bring him for more chemotherapy at Oakland Children's Hospital. Duarte wanted to keep him
home and treat him with herbs and vitamins, reports said. Chavez was returned to his home
after Duarte agreed to take him for chemotherapy. He reportedly has been receiving
treatments when his immune system is strong enough. 
<BR><B>...The minister contends he was trying to save Chavez' life</B>. He is a prostate cancer survivor
who resisted doctors' pressure several years ago to undergo chemotherapy and radiation -- a
decision that he believes saved his life. He said he has performed two funerals for people he
believes were killed by chemotherapy. Miles, 62, a burly, white-bearded man who plays Santa
Claus at County East Mall every year, helped organize rallies for Chavez and published
information about the child in his nationally distributed newsletter, The Connecting Link. He
is former pastor of the now-defunct Oasis of Faith Church.   
<BR><B>...Miles is charged with publishing deputy Mould's home address</B>. News reports said the fax
also listed the names, home addresses, phone numbers, and political affiliations of a child
welfare worker and two juvenile court referees involved in the Chavez case. Mould has
received threatening messages and mail, police said. 
<BR><B>...Miles' attorney Neal Hogan said other people embellished the fax, which was not malicious,
and sent out doctored versions</B>. Hogan said his client's words constituted political speech and
that constitutional protections override the law banning publishing a police officer's address.
Some of the faxes charged that social workers steal children in order to obtain state funding,
then abuse them for their own sexual gratification, news reports said. NIRR 1/22/96

<B>Authorities are not sure whether racial hatred was the motive for the Jan</B>. 8 firebombing of a
church where Green Bay Packer lineman Reggie White is associate pastor. Inner City Church
in East Knoxville, Tenn., and an adjoining wing that had a nursery and radio station were
severely damaged. News reports said there were at least 18 bombs made from quart-size beer
bottles, kerosene, and dish towels. Racist epithets were spray-painted on the back door, a
church member told The Knoxville News-Sentinel. The epithets could be related to the crime
or may be a diversion, federal officials said. The church has a multiracial congregation of
400. Offers of help have come from around the country, and the church plans to rebuild.
White, who is African-American, is an ordained minister who lives in the area during the
off-season. 
<BR><B>...The firebombing was not related to the unsolved burnings of four predominantly black
churches last year, authorities said</B>. Those fires were started by different methods and no
racial graffiti was reported. NIRR 1/22/96

<B>A poll showed a considerable decrease in anti-Catholicism in the South, Auburn University

have for religious figures on a scale of 1 to 10. Mother Teresa averaged 8.3, Billy Graham
7.9, and Pope John Paul II 7.3, the survey showed. Evangelists Oral Roberts, Pat Robertson,

multimillion-dollar real estate and business empire in Miami's impoverished Liberty City

Association of Vineyard Churches (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/122595.html">NIRR 12/25/95</A>), The Toronto Airport Vineyard became
The Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship. The church is beginning a 15-minute daily radio

announcements of upcoming events, and recordings of renewal services. The program will be
heard on WHLD 1270-AM in Grand Isle, N.Y., and on CJMR 1320-AM in Oakville, Ont.,

<B>It took a preacher to calm shoppers fighting over scarce supplies in a New Jersey supermarket
as a massive snowstorm hit the East Coast</B>. As the Bloomfield A&P ran out of milk and bread
Jan. 7, customers shouted and "started to get wild," store manager Louis Carlos said. The
incident could have been worse if not for a man who said he was a preacher and volunteered
to speak on the intercom, news reports said. "In his calm voice he soothed the angry crowd,"
the manager said. "We would have liked to thank him, but he disappeared."

<B>Some 22.8% of pastors have been fired or forced to leave their churches at least once in their
career, and one in four of those has had the experience more than once, a study by

pastors said the church that let them go was a "repeat offender" and had fired at least one
previous pastor.

<B>A prayer liturgy for Christians and Jews to use in joint, informal services in homes, churches,

<B>The 23rd annual March for Life was set for Jan</B>. 22 in Washington, D.C. Marchers planned to
rally on the ellipse in front of the White House, then proceed along Constitution Avenue to
the Capitol and Supreme Court. Sponsors estimated last year's attendance at 100,000. The
first March for Life was held in 1974 to protest the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing
abortion.  Eight historically black denominations called for a day of prayer and reflection to
mark the April 4 anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. This year, the
day falls on the Thursday before Easter. Leaders of the coalition, called the Congress of
National Black Churches, hope to make the observance an annual event.

<B>Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Ga., a Presbyterian school, is beneficiary of a
$55 million trust</B>. Atlanta businessman J. Bulow Campbell established the trust 60 years ago
to provide for his wife and daughter when he died. It was bequeathed to the seminary this fall
after the death of his daughter, his sole heir. The income will add to the school's endowment,
staff a Center for New Church Development, and increase student scholarships and financial
aid.

<B>Pediatricians want a court order to block an abortion clinic from opening an office in their
suburban Chicago building</B>. Doctors from Pediatric Health Care Associates in Arlington
Heights, Ill., said opening the clinic would be "an exercise in bad taste" that would "greatly
disturb" their patients and families, news reports said. The doctors said they also are afraid
that protesters would pose a security risk to their patients.  
<P>
<B>The San Francisco Board of Supervisors held up $65,000 in federal funds earmarked for The
Salvation Army</B>. The cause was a letter written by local Army administrator Capt. Samuel
Southard to a local homosexual newspaper, the Bay Area Reporter. In it, Southard quoted a
Salvationist position statement calling homosexuality "deviant" and contrary to the Bible,
news reports said. "The Salvation Army does not discriminate, period," said Maj. Jerry
Gaines. He said Southard's letter confused the Army's social mission with its "internal
religious beliefs," reports said.

<B>The Illinois Riverboat Gaming Council, a trade group that represents the interests of riverboat

<BR><B>...Critics called the initiative a trick to win favor with politicians and the public</B>. Doug
Dobmeyer, legislative chair of the Religious Task Force to Oppose Increased Legalized
Gambling, said the funding is "insufficient and meaningless for the growing needs of
compulsive gamblers in the state."

<B>Christianity is gaining popularity in Indonesia</B>. The church has
grown at least 10% in five years, to almost 25% of the nearly
200 million population, said an Assemblies of God mission
executive, who did not want to be identified in print. The AG
has about 1,000 pastors in some 800 churches there, he said. 
<BR><B>...All Christian groups are growing, but Pentecostals and
charismatics are having particular success, a 10-year AG
missionary to the country told NIRR</B>. The Pentecostal Church of
Indonesia "has churches everywhere," he said. In five years, the
Pentecostal Holiness Church grew from one pastor and 10
members to more than 3,000 members in 31 churches. In
Surabaya, a charismatic denomina- tion is erecting a 25,000-seat
building. And in a Jakarta AG church, membership increased
from eight to 500 since 1989, the congregation gave $1 million
to missions work, and members started 30 churches.
<BR><B>...Pentecostals and charismatics are especially effective among
followers of "folk Islam," a mixture of Islamic beliefs, animism,
and spiritism, the AG executive said</B>. Their belief in spirits
"makes it easier for Pentecostals to reach them." Pentecostal and
charismatic churches are attracting mainline Protestants who find
a "spiritual reality" they had not known before, the missionary
said. 
<BR><B>...Evangelization has resulted in a backlash against Christian
ministries</B>. The government has reacted to Christian growth by
limiting visas for foreign religious workers and denying church
building permits. Since most Indonesians are Muslim, "President
Suharto is trying to make peace with the leaders to win
re-election," the AG official said. Churches in outlying areas
have been targets of mob violence and many have been burned
by Muslim radicals, he said. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>Unprecedented responses are resulting from Trans World Radio's
broadcasts into Africa, Asia, and Latin America, Senior
International Director William Mial told NIRR</B>. A 38-year
veteran with TWR, Mial has been involved in almost every
aspect of the ministry's development. 
<BR><B>...Broadcasts to India generate 75,000 information requests a
month, Mial said</B>. Six hours of programming are broadcast in 40
languages every day from a transmitter in Sri Lanka. About 500
workers, cooperating with churches, visit those who respond.
Usually the ministry steers converts into existing churches, but in
remote or underevangelized areas, TWR helps them start new
ones. About 300 such congregations have begun in 20 years,
Mial said.
<BR><B>...More than 300 churches have been started through TWR
broadcasts among the Macua people in Northern Mozambique,
who were formerly unreached and do not have the Bible in their
language</B>. Through broadcasts produced by Grand Rapids,
Mich.-based Word of Hope, "an incredible move of the Spirit"
had led thousands to Christ, Mial said.
<BR><B>...Several hundred young people in eight Latin American
countries became Christians through a new broadcast to the
region</B>. Via satellite, stations in 40 cities are receiving TWR
broadcasts that are linked directly to follow-up centers. "When
you combine radio with a foot soldier, it is the most effective
way to do ministry," Mial said. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>More than 100 prayer-walkers started out from Germany's
Cologne Cathedral last month on a three-year journey to the
Holy Land</B>. The Reconciliation Walk aims to express sorrow to
Muslims and Jews for Christians' crimes during the Crusades.
Muslims consider that era as "the great betrayal" and it is a
primary reason they are "alienated and suspicious of
Christianity," Youth With A Mission Europe Director and walk
organizer Lynn Green said.
<BR><B>...On the first leg of the trip, the walkers stopped at a Turkish
mosque and read an apology to the imam and 200 men and
boys</B>. "Whoever had this idea must have had a visit from God
Himself," the imam said. Some Muslims are beginning to
examine their sins against Christians and Jews, he told Green.
The imam promised to distribute the apology to 250 mosques in
Europe. More than a thousand Christians are to participate in
various legs of the march, which should reach Antioch, Turkey,
in June 1998 and Jerusalem in July 1999. The journey ends on
the 900th anniversary of the Crusaders' victory over Jerusalem.

<B>Hope For Europe is fostering partnerships to evangelize the
continent</B>. The networking organization is active in 30 countries
and involves scores of evangelical ministries. Much like the AD
2000 and Beyond movement, HFE coordinates national and
global evangelism. Cosponsored by the European Evangelical
Alliance and the Lausanne Europe Committee, HFE also
strategizes with AD 2000 and other networking groups, HFE's
Ron Kernahan told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...The group has no timetable for the complete evangelization of
Europe</B>. "We felt it best to work toward the emergence of
national strategies" rather than establish an overall goal, an HFE
report to AD 2000 said. HFE cosponsored church-planting
consultations in several European nations under the leadership of
Discipling A Whole Nation. It also helped promote and
coordinate the European Evangelical Association's week of
prayer, which involved hundreds of churches in at least 25
countries. HFE sponsors prayer conferences by the European
Prayer Link, and last year cosponsored a European Youth Forum
in Prague. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>The conversion and persecution of a Kuwaiti man has made
church leaders aware of other converted Muslims who kept their
faith private, according to the Compass Direct news service</B>.
After Hussein Qambar Ali (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/010896.html">NIRR 1/8</A>) publicized his conversion,
four Kuwaiti men, using false names, told a newspaper about
their conversion experiences. One journalist said he knows
several Kuwaitis from prominent families and others in
influential government positions who are Christians. A
businessman reported that he knows a number of men who have
converted in the last few years. "They have not announced

<BR><B>...Kuwait is more tolerant of Christianity than other Persian Gulf
nations</B>. Public evangelism is forbidden, but Christians can meet
in public and are granted permits to build churches and import
literature. But Christian converts face social ostracism and
Islamic law has no penalty for killing an apostate. Ali is accused
of offending Islam by several lawyers, who want to have his
civil rights stripped. His case is scheduled to be heard May 29.

<B>"We are a society perched on the brink of self-destruction," Billy
Graham told 700 congressional, diplomatic, and religious leaders
in the U.S</B>. Capitol Rotunda May 2 as he and his wife, Ruth,
received the Congressional Gold Medal. Graham, 77, said earlier
recipients of the award, including George Washington, would not
recognize the society they sacrificed to establish. "We have
confused liberty with license -- and we are paying the awful
price." Mrs. Graham, 75, who is recovering from spinal
meningitis, was brought into the Rotunda in a wheelchair and
briefly stood beside her husband for the presentation ceremony.
Later, President Clinton was among those speaking at a
$500-a-plate dinner for the Grahams. The event was a
fund-raiser for the Ruth and Billy Graham Children's Health
Center at Memorial Mission Hospital in Asheville, N.C.
<BR><B>...Graham spoke as Americans gathered in churches, synagogues,
and other public assemblies for the National Day of Prayer
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/041596.html">NIRR 4/15</A>)</B>. There were more than 12,000 such assemblies in
all 50 states, according to the NDP's organizing committee. "The
problems we face are too overwhelming. They are problems of
the heart, and only God can change the heart," said NDP
Chairman Shirley Dobson, wife of Focus on the Family founder
James Dobson.
<BR><B>...While society deteriorates, the Christian church is "strangely
silent" and people are looking to "secular prophets," said Thomas
Wang, head of the AD 2000 & Beyond Movement</B>. Wang spoke
during the National Concert of Prayer, an annual three-hour,
interdenominational prayer meeting. The event was broadcast by
television and radio from suburban Washington, D.C., across
North America, Central America, and parts of South America;
the broadcast was translated simultaneously into Spanish. As the
Christian leaders prayed, hundreds of thousands of viewers in
churches and homes did the same. 
<BR><B>...God created America to be a "light to the nations," but, in
God's view, the United States has "prostituted" itself by
consuming the wealth that God intended to bless the world,
Avery Willis of the Southern Baptist Convention's Foreign
Mission Board said during the broadcast</B>. "I want My church
back. I want My people back. I want My country back," God is
saying, Willis said. "Repent or I will leave you desolate."
<BR><B>..."We've marginalized Christianity in this country," said Charles
Colson, founder of Prison Fellowship International</B>. He was
among evangelical, Catholic, and Jewish leaders who spoke and
prayed in the Cannon Office Building on Capitol Hill. Others
included Cardinal William Keeler of Baltimore, Rabbi Daniel
Lapin of Seattle, David Stevens of the Christian Medical &
Dental Society, and Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council.
<BR><B>...Many prayed for President Clinton, including pastor E.V</B>. Hill
at a May 1 prayer rally in Lafayette Park, across from the White
House. The president "is a human being. He is like one of us.
He has his own fears, strengths, and weaknesses," Hill said.
Clinton "is not capable of performing all that is expected of his
office" without God, he said. 
<BR><B>...There was a near-tragedy at Focus on the Family May 2 when
a gunman entered the ministry's administration building in
Colorado Springs and threatened to blow it up</B>. Kerry Dore, 43,
who reportedly has an extensive psychiatric history, entered the
lobby brandishing a handgun, took two men and two women as
hostages, ordered remaining employees to leave the building, and
threatened to detonate a bomb he said was strapped to his chest.
Dore released the hostages after 90 minutes, then surrendered
two-and-a-half hours later to a Colorado Springs SWAT team.
No one was injured and no bomb was found. Dore, a Denver
construction worker and father of four, had been angry with his
employer's worker's compensation settlement but blamed Focus
on the Family, police said. He was injured by a metal rod in
1992 while helping build the Focus headquarters, FOF
spokesperson Caia Mockaitis told NIRR.
<BR><B>..."I don't think there is any business, any ministry, any church
that is not under threat," James Dobson told Religion News
Service</B>. Focus on the Family, which has 200,000 visitors a year,
will continue to open its headquarters to public tours despite the
incident, he said. Dobson said he believed the gunman's peaceful
surrender was a direct answer to prayer. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>In a decision that affects churches and charities nationwide, the
8th District Court of Appeals in St</B>. Louis ruled May 6 that
donations to a church may not be confiscated by creditors of the
donor if he later goes bankrupt. Bankruptcy trustee Julia
Christians had demanded that Crystal Evangelical Free Church of
New Hope, Minn. (NIRR 10/3/94), return $13,450 in donations
by Bruce and Nancy Young during the year before they filed for
bankruptcy. The Youngs had operated an electrical contracting
business for a number of years until they faced the 1990
recession and health problems. Two lower courts had ruled
against the church and the Youngs, holding that the tithes were a
"fraudulent transfer," meaning nothing of value was received in
exchange for the money.
<BR><B>...At stake in the case was the autonomy of church funds, said
Steven McFarland, director of the Christian Legal Society's
Center for Law and Religious Freedom</B>. The court ruled that the
bankruptcy trustee's demand violated the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act because confiscating the church's offerings
would substantially burden the free exercise of religion. The
court also held that the trustee's interests in collecting all
available money for the Youngs' creditors was not sufficiently
important to outweigh their religious liberty. "RFRA is not a
toothless tiger after all," McFarland said. 
<BR><B>...If the church had lost, congregations and charities would have
to hold donations for a year or until they were sure that each
donor was solvent and not likely to go bankrupt within a year,
McFarland said</B>. Being forced to return large donations could
"shut down many charities, and running credit checks on your
major donors is not conducive to warm donor relations," he said.
The ruling "keeps the government's hand out of what rightfully
belongs to the church," Crystal Evangelical Free Church pastor
Stephen Goold said.                                         
<BR><B>...The ruling will "have an impact" on about two dozen similar
cases in the lower courts, said attorney Kenneth Corey-Edstrom,
who argued the case for the church</B>. Attorney Dick Thompson,
representing the creditors, is considering appealing the decision
to the U.S. Supreme Court, news reports said. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>A stream of former drug addicts and alcoholics, women who
have had abortions, homosexuals, and people who had dabbled
in the occult testified to their spiritual reformation through Jesus
Christ during the Washington for Jesus rally on the U.S</B>. Capitol
steps and Mall lawn April 29-30. The U.S. Park Service
estimated that 75,000 people attended the rally, a marathon of 20
Christian musical groups and some two dozen speakers, who
urged people to maintain sexual purity, to forge strong family
ties, and to serve the church and country. Most speakers came
from charismatic or Pentecostal traditions, but fundamentalist
pastor Jerry Falwell also spoke. He began a mock trial, declaring
that America is guilty of a variety of sins. During a "miracle
healing" service by television evangelist Benny Hinn, dozens of
believers ascended the stage and told how Jesus Christ had cured
them of various ailments. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>Promise Keepers is planning a series of regional rallies for
pastors as follow-ups to its Atlanta clergy conference (NIRR
2/19)</B>. About six such rallies are planned for the fall of 1997,
although dates and locations are not finalized.
<BR><B>...Many pastors who experienced renewal during the conference
have been meeting regularly and formulating strategies for
revival in their cities, said PK's Dale Schlafer, who organized
the Atlanta event</B>. The regional rallies will build on the
enthusiasm and recommitment to the ministry generated in
Atlanta and allow pastors who did not attend to experience those
things. After PK's initial sponsorship of the regional rallies,
future meetings will be organized by pastors without direct PK
sponsorship, the group said. The goal is for pastors of various
denominations and races to befriend each other, hold concerts of
prayer together, and cooperate in ministry efforts. The
conferences will resemble a "sacred assembly" of the church,
involving "glorious worship," brokenness and repentance for
sins, and prayer for "the awakening of the lost," Schlafer said. A
12-minute video with highlights from the Atlanta conference is
being produced and will be sent to those who attended, PK said.

<B>Seminaries often fail to teach leadership skills, said George
Barna of the Barna Research Group</B>. Schools prepare seminarians
to teach and preach, but "set people up for failure by causing
them to believe that being a good teacher is the same as being a
good leader," he said. According to Barna's research, most
seminary graduates give their alma maters poor grades in areas
such as creating a ministry vision, managing people, and
fund-raising. He delivered his comments at a conference that
included Alban Institute founder and President Loren Mead. The
two prominent church consultants spoke April 29 at Eastern
Baptist Theological Seminary in Philadelphia.
<BR><B>...Most seminaries operate on an outdated paradigm of ministry
developed during an era when society was largely christianized
and the laity left the work of the ministry to professional clergy,
Mead said</B>. But today, ministry increasingly is understood as the
responsibility of the laity, he said. It is vital for seminaries to
reflect this trend, Mead and Barna said. Barna predicted that
other training institutions could be founded to compete with
seminaries by offering alternative services. Seminaries should
admit students in light of God's calling and the spiritual gift of
leadership, as well as good grades, Barna said. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>Some 175 representatives of Christian denominations and
parachurch groups met May 1 in Alexandria, Va., at a
conference on evangelism strategies sponsored by Mission
America (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/122595.html">NIRR 12/25/95</A>)</B>. The movement's goal is that, by the
year 2001, Christians will have prayed for everyone in the
country and shared the gospel with them in a way they were able
to understand. 
<BR><B>...Conference participants heard about Celebrate Jesus 2000, an
ambitious Southern Baptist strategy available to other ministries
and denominations</B>. The initiative includes praying, sharing the
gospel individually and in group settings, and helping new
Christians become disciples and evangelists. Sterling Huston,
North American director for the Billy Graham evangelistic
crusades, detailed the plan. He noted it would not succeed unless
local churches undertake it, because it is "not top-driven except
for materials and concepts." The SBC Home Mission Board is
planning to develop a manual to help churches and communities
participate in the program. The strategy can be adapted for
different cultural groups and can include various approaches to
witnessing. For information, call Mission America at (612)
853-1762. 
<BR><B>...Mission America also is planning for church leaders in 1,000
U.S</B>. communities to meet next March to develop cooperative
evangelism strategies. Such meetings would continue to grow
each year so that within four years leaders in 4,000 communities
would be participating, MA's John Quam said. 
<BR><B>...The church has wrongfully tolerated disunity, said Joseph
Stowell, president of Moody Bible Institute</B>. Christians often act
like "kids in the back seat on a long trip, bickering and picking."
Unity must not be simply "oneness for oneness' sake," but based
in Christ and centered on truth, Stowell said. "A few things are
more important than unity, and truth is one of them." NIRR

<B>Cincinnati-area conservative Christians are mobilizing to talk

Association and Citizens for Community Values, are seeking

members, who also plan to hold a prayer service at the park, will
wear white shirts in contrast to the red shirts of homosexuals.
The purpose is to "show them in a very nonconfrontational way
that Christians don't hate them," Jackson told NIRR. "If they're
not open to what we're saying, we don't want to be in their face
any more than we want them to be in our face." NIRR 5/13/96

<B>The Christian Coalition's Ralph Reed reiterated the group's
opposition to any substantial changes to the Republican Party's
pro-life platform</B>. Questions arose about the group's commitment
to the platform after the New York Times reported that Reed
reluctantly would agree to exceptions for rape and incest in a
constitutional amendment banning abortion. The Human Life
Amendment in the current platform makes an exception only if
the mother's life is at risk. The story "completely
misrepresented" the organization's position, the Christian
Coalition said. The Times later clarified the story, explaining
that Reed was referring to laws banning abortions, not the party
platform.
<BR><B>...Questions were raised anew after an excerpt from Reed's
forthcoming book appeared in Newsweek</B>. Saying that pro-lifers
don't have enough votes in Congress to pass a pro-life
amendment, Reed suggested new language for the platform.
While promising to use "all legal and constitutional" means to
protect the unborn, the proposed language makes no call for a
Human Life Amendment, news reports said. Reed said he was
expressing his personal views and not Christian Coalition policy.
He said the group will oppose "with every fiber in our being"
any effort to include a rape or incest exception or drop a call for
constitutional and legal remedies such as an amendment to the
Constitution. NIRR 5/13/96

Jewish editor Michael Lerner, and Catholic, Muslim, and Jewish
leaders. To contrast the Christian Coalition's Contract With the
American Family, the group offered the Progressive, Ethical
Covenant With American Families. The document calls for
protection of abortion rights, recognition of gay and lesbian
unions, a higher minimum wage, a reduced work week, and one
year of paid leave in special family circumstances. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>Students around the country were involved in a simultaneous
effort to share the gospel during two days last month</B>. Students
from 40 denominations and parachurch groups participated in 48
Hours, which spanned April 12-14. Its purpose was to seek out
nonbelievers rather than expect them to come to Christians, said
Dan Finley, who coordinates youth evangelism for the Southern
Baptist Convention. The emphasis of 48 Hours was to "go out
on the highways and byways and seek people out."
<BR><B>...Young people used creative ways to meet people</B>. In Roanoke,
Va., 11 youth took religious surveys downtown, did chalk
drawings, and handed out tracts. Youth in Liburn, Ga., ran a
three-day sports and religion camp with basketball and softball,
contacting 230 children. In Nashville, youth invited
non-Christian friends to sleepovers, then took them to church the
next day. A number of youth added their conversion stories to a
videotape containing testimonies by several contemporary
Christian musicians. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>North Korea's underground church has survived because it has
Bibles, a missionary to the country said</B>. By preserving and
copying Korean Bibles, the church ensured its existence after the
communist crackdown began in the 1950s, he said. The
communists make a diligent effort to round up and destroy
Bibles.
<BR><B>...A woman told the missionary how her third-grade class was
told to look secretly for Bibles at home and bring them to class</B>.
She brought in her mother's Bible and was praised before the
whole class, but never saw her mother again, she told the
missionary. One group of Christians showed him their
handwritten Bible. "It had been written in the dark and was
scribbled. It was horrible, but they had one," he said at a
conference sponsored by Bartlesville, Okla.-based Voice of the
Martyrs. The trip convinced him to begin smuggling Bibles into
the country and funding church leaders, the missionary said. Last
year, his organization brought 50,000 Bibles to the country and
supported 257 church leaders. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>The U.S</B>. Supreme Court refused to review a ruling that struck
down a South Dakota law requiring parental notification for girls
under 18 seeking abortions. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals voided the law because it included no opportunity for
"judicial bypass" in special cases, such as if the minor is able to
persuade a judge that an abortion is in her best interest.
<BR><B>...A federal judge temporarily blocked a Wisconsin law requiring
a waiting period</B>. It requires women to consult with a doctor in
person at least 24 hours before an abortion, except in certain
cases of rape and incest. Judge Barbara Crabb said the law
exposes doctors to great risk of penalty, without clearly
specifying what they can or cannot do. A hearing is scheduled
May 20 to consider a Planned Parenthood request for a
temporary injunction. Under the new law, doctors must discuss
abortion with their patients, giving women a booklet with
pictures of fetuses and providing oral and written information
about the procedure, risks, alternatives, and social service
programs. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>An abortion doctor is suing a Roman Catholic priest for $50
million, charging he endangered his life by saying it is justifiable
homicide to kill abortionists</B>. Bruce Lucero of Birmingham, Ala.,
said in a civil trial April 23 that statements by David Trosch
(NIRR 8/22/94) on two television programs, Geraldo and The
Shelly Stewart Show, are forcing him to spend $50 million on
security for his clinic and staff over the next 20 years. During
the Oct. 5, 1994, Geraldo show, Trosch described Lucero as a
"mass murderer" who "should be dead." Lucero also showed the
judge photos of his clinic and home that Trosch had published in
his organization's literature. Trosch has been removed from
church duties and heads Life Enterprises Unlimited, based in
Mobile, with a mailing list of about 1,000 people, the priest said.
<BR><B>...Lucero said he fears Trosch as well as those who have heard
the priest's positions</B>. Lucero's civil suit claims Trosch violated
the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances law. Under
questioning, Trosch repeated that it is acceptable to kill abortion
doctors. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>It is "time for a gut check" in the black church in response to
Louis Farrakhan, says Ronald Potter, a theologian and professor
at Bellhaven College in Jackson, Miss</B>. Many black church
leaders have never faced such a serious challenge to their faith
and are demonstrating "timidity and cowardice" when it comes
to the Nation of Islam leader, he said in Urban Family magazine.
Too many black Christians are suffering from "theological and
biblical illiteracy" because their churches emphasize emotion
more than doctrine, leaving them vulnerable to the ideas of
Farrakhan, who often quotes Scripture. Some black ministers
practice a "new radicalism," placing racial loyalty above
"seeking and telling the truth," he said. Potter also said black
Christians are not doing enough to demonstrate the gospel
through good works.

<B>Prayer evangelism is proving to be effective in California</B>. Last
year, Christians from 400 families in Yuba and Sutter counties
made commitments to introduce themselves to their neighbors,
ask if they needed prayer, and pray for them (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/072495.html">NIRR 7/24/95</A>).
They also flooded the area with neighborly help, giving food to
medical and police workers, doing landscaping, painting over
graffiti, donating clothing, and washing cars. As a result, church
attendance grew 26% since February 1995 at the congregations
reporting results of the efforts, said Greg Burnett of Harvest
Evangelism. The San Jose, Calif.-based group is testing prayer
evangelism in California after it was effective in Argentina.

expedient, compassionate choice," said Paschall, who has
described himself as a nondenominational Christian. Morning
prayers ordinarily are given by ministers, but occasionally a
House member delivers the prayer, the newspaper said.

<B>Russia: The former Soviet Union has more than 100 Bible
schools and seminaries, but no Christian universities, according
to American educator John Bernbaum</B>. He founded
Russian-American University in Moscow (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/051595.html">NIRR 5/15/95</A>) so
students can learn business, medicine, and politics with a
Christian grounding, he said. With the assistance of a Russian
board of directors and 10 U.S. colleges, Bernbaum developed a
curriculum and obtained resources for training students in
computer literacy, free-market and democratic values, English,
and biblical ethics, he told NIRR. "Our thrust is evangelical, but
we try very hard to be interdenominational." So far, the
university has offered only night and summer courses in
management training principles, English, and Christian
apologetics. The first full class will begin in the fall with 50
full-time students. The four-year school will offer the equivalent
of a bachelor's degree.

<LI><B>Is this a free service?</B> Yes. Basic entries into the Help Wanted/Classifieds system are completely free of charge. The only charges would be for extended runs, graphic (display) ads, or banner ads.
<P>
<LI><B>How long does my ad run for?</B> Ads are run for a 30-day period from initial entry into the system. Extended runs can be setup for a nominal fee.
<P>
<LI><B>Can I post my ad in multiple sections?</B>  Yes, but you'll have to do it manually (use your BACK function and change the category). We ask that you only place your ads in relevant areas. Since we screen all ads for content, we will detect abuses of the system and remove all ads from a repeated abuser.
<P>
<LI><B>Do you screen ads before they are posted?</B> Yes. In order to preserve standards, quality, and usefulness the staff at GOSHEN screens each ad before it is accepted into the system. Any problem ads are removed.
<P>
<LI><B>Can I use HTML tags in my ads?</B> Yes, however, we have tried to limit the use of tags to font color changes plus bold/italic markup changes. Ads that use other tags will not be added to the system.
<P>
<LI><B>Can I use graphic elements/JAVA in my ad?</B> No. If you want more attractive/noticable ads, please contact <A HREF="mailto:swike@goshen.net">Steve Wike</A> for more information.
<P>
<LI><B>My ad does not fit into any existing category, can I add a new one?</B> You cannot add a new category directly. You can, however, e-mail a suggestion for a new category to <A HREF="mailto:chip@goshen.net">Sue Chubik</A>.

<PRE>
They were ordinary people living quiet, anonymous lives -- until...

...In Portland, Oregon, the pastor of a large church attends a Prayer Summit with 45 other
pastors from the area. As he sits in the evening communion service, he is privately skeptical
about what could really happen among a group of pastors from different denominations. As a
Pentecostal, he is aware of the lingering animosity between his denomination and some of the
area's Conservative Baptists. 
      After communion, a fellow pastor he does not know addresses the group. "I want to
confess, tonight, that I stand here as a part of the Conservative Baptists, and I ask forgiveness
of my Pentecostal brothers who are here. I feel we've done more than any other group in the
city to quench the Spirit of God. If there is a Pentecostal brother willing to stand here at the
communion table with me, I'd count it a privilege."
      Moments later, the Baptist pastor is joined at the communion table by a Pentecostal
pastor. This man, whom he had never met, says with humility, "Not only do I accept that
apology, I want to offer an apology on behalf of the Pentecostal church for the arrogance and
pride that somehow projects an attitude of superiority." Through the event, the two men
become close friends and agree to pray together every Wednesday morning. 

...In Philadelphia, 120 pastors come together for a similar weekend of spontaneous worship
and prayer. During the first two days, a number of African-American ministers approach the
event's facilitators with the same request: "You've got to bring up the racial issue." One of
the organizers replies, "We don't bring up anything because we're not directing anything. The
Holy Spirit brings up whatever we're led to pray about."
      That evening during a worship service, the pastors are invited to approach the
communion table on their own as they feel ready. An Asian pastor gets up from his chair,
slumps onto the floor, and begins to cry: "God, forgive me of my sin of racism toward my
black brothers." Immediately a dozen African-American pastors come forward and surround
the man. They hug him and begin to pray for him. While this continues, one of the pastors
slips off to the side of the altar where he kneels. His head bowed, he begins to whisper, "God
forgive me for my sin of racism toward my Asian brothers." The communion service
continues for hours. The next morning the pastors tell the facilitator, "This was the greatest
breakthrough in the city of Philadelphia in a hundred years."

The book from which these reports are taken, Revival Signs (Vision House, 1995), was
written so you would be drawn to the Lord, not marvel at a movement. As you step closer to
catch a glimpse of this new spiritual awakening, the reality dawns: God is using a relatively
small handful of broken, humbled people to draw individuals, communi- ties, and an entire
nation to Himself. As you read, I believe your curiosity will give way to a genuine awe and
attraction to the God who is as real and present as your own breath. The question Is this
spiritual awakening for real? will be replaced by a new question: How can I know this God
and be a part of what He's doing in my world?
      When this happens, you will be nearing the heart of the movement: God's greatest
desire, as the Supreme Evangelist, has always been for individuals to know Him personally.
Today, the disparity between His perfect will and His imperfect people has set the stage for
unavoidable and historic consequences. 
      The pipeline God has chosen to reach the rest of the world, you and me, has been
gathering rust, clogged for too many years. We have been content, aware that things are not
quite right, yet too lazy to do much about it. If we believed God was serious about wanting to
flow through His church, we shouldn't have been surprised that He first needed to clean out
the rust. It was there all along: "Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a
vessel for honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work" (2
Timothy 2:21). 
      In other words, purging must occur before the Holy Spirit can flow into our nation, our
churches, our lives. 
      Today, the first trickles of rust have begun to break loose and flow from the vessels of
our lives. The people you just met know the pain and promise that awaits others. Their
conviction, confession, and turning to Christ are the initial fruit of the Holy Spirit that could
carry us toward the first major spiritual awakening in the United States in more than 130
years.   

                 What is happening to our world?

What we're seeing now -- prayer, confession, and spiritual hunger -- is more than a mere
pinprick of light in the darkness. Much like Creation, "when the earth was formless and
empty and darkness was over the surface of the deep..." (Genesis 1:2), God is at work again,
not dispelling darkness, but piercing it.
      In our communities, Christians are demonstrating a new commitment to pray and trust
God for what He wants to reveal to them and their churches. In fellowships, confession of
personal and corporate sin triggers the expressed desire for God's forgiveness, leading to
reconciliation among fellow Christians and a sweet unity in worship. In gatherings, the
outward expression of personal brokenness and a renewed will to obey and serve God
precedes an extraordinary movement of God's Spirit that knows no human explanation. Such
movements are occurring today in pockets all across our nation.
      Whether you believe a major spiritual awakening is imminent or merely a remote
possibility, it's hard to deny that God is drawing His people to Himself, and that His people
are poised to reach others with Christ. Our country has experienced three Great Awakenings
in its history. Each time, what began as humble confession became a movement of national
repentance, obedience, and social change. When a nation's darkness becomes overwhelmingly
destructive, only God can supply what people need to be brought back to life. These things
include the assurance of being forgiven, accepted and loved; the joy of worshipping God
alone; and a return to holy living. When God brings revival to a nation, He blesses His
people with a call to return to five specific commitments:  
      
      1. Belief in the authority of the Scriptures.
      2. Belief in the centrality of the cross.
      3. Increased devotional life and return to personal holiness.
      4. Explosive witnessing and discipleship.
      5. Corporate social change that results from individual, spiritual transformation.

      Does seeing the embryonic development of one or more of these things mean our nation
is one step closer to revival? In my view, this is the wrong question. Trying to predict any
movement of God's Spirit is impossible, even harmful. We could be so caught up in wanting
to know "When will it happen?" that we lose appreciation for how consistent God's
expression of love is in revival. The great thing about seeing how God has revived our nation
three times, and how He revived His people in Scripture, is that we see God's consistent
character and blessing at work.

              Finney's seven indicators of revival

Charles Finney couldn't know at the time that he was living in the last period of spiritual
awakening our country has seen until now. Finney was not interested in forecasting history.
However, 130 years after they were written, Finney's indicators may cause us to think again
about extraordinary expressions of the Holy Spirit in our nation that have already caused
many to say, "I had no idea these things were happening." How many Americans today would
agree with Finney that... 

      1. When the sovereignty of God indicates that revival is near. 
      2. When wickedness grieves and humbles Christians.
      3. When there is a spirit of prayer for revival.
      4. When the attention of ministers is directed toward revival and spiritual awakening. 
      5. When Christians confess their sins one to another.
      6. When Christians are willing to make sacrifices to carry out the new movement of      

         God's Spirit.
      7. When ministers and laity are willing for God to promote spiritual awakening by        

         whatever instrument He pleases...then revival comes. 

      How many of these seven indicators are present where you live and worship? 

                    Three potential obstacles

Although God is sovereign, the emerging spiritual awakening could be stilled prematurely.
This movement of the Holy Spirit could be hindered by men and women who stiffen at any
unusual occurrence that doesn't fit their ordinary religious tradition. This movement of the
Spirit could be hindered by believers afraid to learn the truth about their own rusted, sinful
cores that can be cleaned out and cleaned up only by the most vulnerable act of all: admitting
that our corrosion, our sin, is choking off the flow of the Spirit. And it may not be "the other
guy" who is hindering revival. Well-meaning Christians -- you and I -- could resist being
vulnerable to God to the point that we could hinder the Holy Spirit's movement, and thus
hinder revival. The questions we need to be asking are these: 

      
       - Do I want to be part of an extraordinary movement of the Holy Spirit in this nation? 
       - Do I long for God's forgiveness and healing in this country, a movement that can
         come only from Him? 

      If your answer to both is yes, if deeper spiritual life is what you seek, then be ready to
experience two distinct and opposing forces. The first is God's infinite desire to bring our
nation to Himself. The second is your own imperfect nature that causes you to look out for
self. It's in this flawed, human interior where the three potential obstacles to revival dwell. To
know these obstacles that could keep you from personal revival -- and our nation from a
genuine spiritual awakening -- you need only look at your own heart. 

The first potential obstacle to personal and national revival is as basic as our desire to know
God. It is the need to understand. Simply put, our flawed, rationalistic minds cannot fully
comprehend revival. Revival is not a mystery to be "thought through"; it is a movement of
the Spirit to be experienced with reverence, checked against the clear guidelines of Scripture,
and then given to the God who alone deserves our praise.

The second potential obstacle is the very real fear of not being accepted (and being rejected)
by others. In an age of conformity, the thought of speaking out and standing up for God can
be a truly ominous barrier.

The third potential obstacle is apathy. Apathy can take one of two forms: a gradual familiarity
with the extraordi- nary movement of the Holy Spirit; or an overt disinterest in the undeniable
and extraordinary works of God. The first kind takes the form of a subtle comfort that breeds
spiritual boredom and fatigue. The second is a disregard in caring about the obvious. 

                 Preparing for personal revival

Neither you nor I can create revival, but we can prepare for personal revival by asking the
basic questions that follow, as noted in Spirit of Revival magazine, March 1995, pp. 37-39.
Treat them as a kind of "personal inventory of the heart," your heart. Before you look at these
questions, take to heart these simple suggestions:

      Pray the prayer of the psalmist: "Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me and
know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way
everlasting" (Psalm 139:23-24). Be totally honest as you answer each question.
      Then, agree with God about each need He reveals in your life. Confess each sin with the
willingness to make it right and forsake it. Praise God for His cleansing and forgiveness.
Renew your mind and rebuild your life through meditation and practical application of the
Word of God. Review the following questions periodically to remain sensitive to your need
for ongoing revival.

      Genuine salvation (2 Corinthians 5:17). Was there ever a time in my life that I genuinely
repented of my sin? Was there ever a time in my life that I placed my trust in Jesus Christ
alone to save me? Was there ever a time in my life that I completely surrendered to Jesus
Christ as Master and Lord?
      
      God's Word (Psalm 119:97,140). Do I love to read and meditate on the Word of God?
Are my personal devotions consistent and meaningful? Do I practically apply God's Word to
my everyday life?
      
      Humility (Isaiah 57:15). Am I quick to recognize and agree with God in confession when
I have sinned? Am I quick to admit to others when I am wrong? Do I rejoice when others are
praised and recognized and my accom- plishments go unnoticed? Do I esteem all others as
better than myself?
      
      Obedience (Hebrews 13:11). Do I consistently obey what I know God wants me to do?
Do I consistently obey the human authorities God has placed over my life (those who do not
contradict God's moral law)?
      
      Pure heart (1 John 1:9). Do I confess my sins specifically? Do I keep "short sin
accounts" with God (confess and forsake as He convicts)? Am I willing to give up all sin for
God?
      
      Clear conscience (Acts 24:16). Do I consistently seek forgiveness from those I wrong or
offend? Is my conscience clear with every person? Can I honestly say there is no one I have
ever wronged or offended in any way and not gone back to them and sought their forgiveness
and made it right?
      
      Priorities (Matthew 6:33). Does my schedule reveal that God is first in my life? Does my
checkbook reveal that God is first in my life? Next to my relationship with God, is my
relationship with my family my highest priority?
      
      Values (Colossians 3:12). Do I love what God loves and hate what God hates? Do I
value highly the things that please God (e.g., giving, witnessing to those without Christ,
studying His Word, prayer, helping and serving others)? Are my affections and goals fixed on
others and eternal values?
      
      Sacrifice (Philippians 3:7). Am I willing to sacrifice whatever is necessary to see God
move in my life and church (time, convenience, comfort, reputation, pleasure, etc.)? Is my life
characterized by genuine sacrifice for the cause of Christ for righteousness and justice?
      
      Spirit control (Galatians 5:22-26). Am I allowing Jesus to be Lord of every area of my
life? Am I allowing the Holy Spirit to "fill" my life each day? Is there consistent evidence of
the fruit of the Spirit produced in my life?
      
      First love (Philippians 1:21,23). Am I as much in love with Jesus as I have ever been?
Am I thrilled with Jesus, filled with His joy and peace, and making Him the continual object
of my love?
      
      Motives (Acts 5:29). Am I more concerned about what God thinks about my life than
about what others think? Would I pray, read my Bible, give and serve as much if nobody but
God ever noticed? Am I more concerned about pleasing God than I am about being accepted
and appreciated by others?
      
      Moral purity (Ephesians 5:3-4). Do I keep my mind free from books, magazines, or
entertainment that could stimulate ungodly fantasizing or thoughts that are not morally pure?
Are my conversation and behavior pure?
      
      Forgiveness (Colossians 3:12-13). Do I seek to resolve conflicts in relationships as soon
as possible? Am I quick to forgive those who wrong me or hurt me?
      
      Sensitivity (Matthew 5:23-24). Am I sensitive to the conviction and promptings of God's
Spirit? Am I quick to respond in humility and obedience to the conviction and promptings of
God's Spirit?
      
      Evangelism (Luke 24:46-48). Do I have a burden for those who don't know Christ? Do I
witness?
      
      Prayer (1 Timothy 2:1). Am I faithful in praying for the needs of others? Do I pray
specifically, fervently, and faithfully for revival in my life, my church and our nation?

<B>Political and spiritual challenges face the church in Hong Kong as China's takeover approaches</B>. Christians see
opportunities for church renewal as well as openness to the gospel among their friends, co-workers, and society's
leaders, said David Wang of Hong Kong-based Asian Outreach (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/041596.html">NIRR 4/15</A>). 
<BR><B>...Hong Kong residents are less fearful of the July 1997 takeover than Westerners are, said Sam Ling of the Institute
for Chinese Studies at the Billy Graham Center for World Evangelism in Wheaton, Ill</B>. Many of the younger
generation feel a connection to China and have adopted a pragmatic outlook, preparing to be regulated as well as
to minister to the mainland, he said.
<BR><B>...Christian leaders are grappling with political implications of the takeover</B>. China has asked church leaders to show
their support for reunification by participating in the selection of Hong Kong's new governor and involving their
congregations in China's National Day Celebration, Oct. 1. If the churches participate, the Chinese government will
gain a lot of recognition and respect, Wang told NIRR. But the Hong Kong church never has been political and
Christians are not sure how to proceed. Some see an opportunity to have a voice in the new government, but others
fear the church will be compromised. 
<BR><B>...China has promised not to interfere in internal affairs of the church</B>. But Communist officials will observe affairs
in Hong Kong, where more than half of the schools, hospitals, and social services are run by churches. Chinese
policy states that Hong Kong and mainland churches may not interfere in each other's business, which could put
limits on Hong Kong-based evangelism efforts, said Feliciano Carion of the Christian Conference of Asia. But
ministries that are sensitive, service-oriented, and adaptive to the changing social, political, and economic scene will
succeed, Wang said. 
<BR><B>...Hong Kong is thriving spiritually</B>. An unanticipated effect of the takeover is that many older leaders have left and
most of Hong Kong's 1,300 churches are led by pastors under 30. Most of their predecessors came from China after
the Communist takeover in 1949, while the younger pastors were born in Hong Kong and have more of a
commitment to it. They also are less denominational and more open to evangelistic cooperation, Wang said.
<BR><B>...More than 300 churches have formed in the past three years and cell groups have exploded, Wang said</B>. Churches
hold prayer rallies and minicrusades in each of Hong Kong's 19 districts. Capture Today is an ongoing city-wide
crusade sponsored by local churches that features speakers in Hong Kong's largest stadium. More than 800 churches
participated in the March for Jesus last year and churches are cooperating in an effort to mail gospel booklets to 1.5
million households, followed by visits from Christians. 
<BR><B>..."There are 1.2 billion people in China who share our culture and in less than 360 days that barrier to spread the
gospel will be removed," said Cecil Chan of the Hong Kong Baptist Convention</B>. Evangelism of mainland China
could be the beginning of a new wave of world outreach. Church-growth expert C. Peter Wagner predicted that
China will be the largest missionary-sending country in the world by 2025. "Few people are as open and aggressive
in their faith as the Chinese Christians," said Atlanta-based apologist Ravi Zacharias, who recently addressed 400
Hong Kong businessmen. "The way China goes will shape the world definitively for the next century." NIRR

<B>Seven hundred thousand people have attended services at Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Fla., since
a spiritual outpouring began there on Father's Day in 1995 (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/031896.html">NIRR 3/18</A>)</B>. Some 25,000 people have made professions
of faith in Christ at the services, conducted Wednesday through Sunday each week, with a corporate intercessory
prayer meeting on Tuesdays. Dozens of people who become Christians at the services are baptized on Friday nights
at Brownsville AG and many neighboring churches. Those professing faith in Christ include the well-to-do, as well
as drug addicts, witches, prostitutes, and Satanists, who have attempted to curse the preacher and the congregation.
<BR><B>...Visitors continue to come from across the country and foreign nations</B>. Linda Fussel, a local travel agent, books
about 1,000 flights a week for people attending the Pensacola services.
<BR><B>...Each night, the crowd arrives several hours early, sitting or kneeling quietly until the 7 p.m</B>. service. After an hour
of praise-and-worship music, testimonies, and preaching, evangelist Steve Hill gives an invitation to profess Christ.
Others are invited to come forward for prayer and the laying on of hands. Unusual physical manifestations -- such
as falling down, head shaking, and jerking -- continue, but are neither downplayed nor encouraged, one observer said.
Some services end at midnight while others last until sunrise. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Many who have been "drenched in renewal rains" in Melbourne, Fla., are evangelizing others and helping the poor
(<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12/95</A>)</B>. "The long-term fruit is definitely the finest I've tasted in 20 years of ministry," said Michael
Thompson, senior pastor at Tabernacle Church, an interdenominational, charismatic congregation. Special services
that began Jan. 1, 1995, continue on Friday nights.
<BR><B>....Nine churches run a sidewalk Sunday school and give away groceries and clothing at housing projects</B>. Nearly
$60,000 was given through the Melbourne Renewal organization to Habitat for Humanity and ministries that aid the
homeless, AIDS patients, and addicts. For the second year, pastors, musicians, and prayer teams will lead a
conference in Honduras.
<BR><B>...Unity across denominations continues to grow as a result of the services</B>. Last year, nearly 3,000 people attended
a prayer service led by pastors from 20 churches. Pastors meet monthly to pray for one another's ministries, and 40
pastors recently attended the fourth pastors' prayer summit. On Friday evenings, area pastors or a person involved
in renewal in another area of the world address the Melbourne Renewal group. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Nearly 862,000 men have attended the 17 Promise Keepers conferences so far this year; five more stadium events
are planned</B>. The largest 1996 conference drew 70,490 to the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich. (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/062496.html">NIRR 6/24</A>). Nine of
the conferences include separate gatherings for the sons of PK conference participants. In addition to its stadium
conferences, PK also is holding 450 local and regional seminars, training sessions, and smaller "wake-up call"
conferences in all 50 states and seven Canadian provinces. The group has offices in 38 states and affiliations in
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.  
<BR><B>...The men's group confirmed it will hold a prayer meeting of a million men on the Mall in Washington, D.C., in
the fall of 1997</B>. No date has been set for the event, which has been under consideration for several years. Local
events, seminars, and stadium conferences also are planned for next year. 
<BR><B>...PK stopped marketing and distributing the controversial book The Masculine Journey: Understanding the Six Stages
of Manhood (NavPress) by Robert Hicks</B>. PK said Hicks' "core theology is consistent with orthodox evangelical
Christianity" but several passages "could be understood in more than one way." The book, which was given to every
man who attended the 1993 conference in Boulder, Colo., describes theories of spiritual growth and change.
Controversy surrounding it has been a distraction, PK said. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Greg Laurie's three-day Harvest Crusade drew 50,000 people to Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, Calif., last
month</B>. A total of 4,700 people -- including 13 stadium employees -- came forward to profess faith in Christ. Among
the speakers was former San Diego Padre Dave Dravecky. After he lost his pitching arm to cancer five years ago,
Dravecky founded a ministry to encourage cancer victims and amputees (NIRR 5/31/93). NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Thousands of people prayed for spiritual and moral revival in Costa Rica during A Cry to God, held at La Sabana
Park in San Jose</B>. Local church leaders, Christians, and U.S.-based evangelist Alberto Mottesi prayed for six hours.
<BR><B>...Mottesi later preached in nearby Turrialba</B>. Each night, 200-400 people became Christians in the town, which has
15 congregations and fewer than 2,000 believers, the Alberto Mottesi Evangelistic Association said. Homosexuals
and alcoholics prayed to receive Christ and lead new lives, and about 200 children became Christians during youth
services, the evangelist said. City streets were empty as 5,000 people, including the mayor and the town witch,
attended one evening service, according to local pastors. A local news reporter transmitted the crusade meetings live
and free of charge to surrounding areas. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>American evangelists used mime, dance, and music to tell the gospel story at Fiesta del Fuego, a Caribbean music
festival in Cuba last month</B>. Singers performed a Spanish version of Steve Green's He Holds the Key, while actors
portrayed Christ's victory over death. Since religious themes -- mostly voodoo and the occult -- were included in
the festival, the troupe felt justified in presenting the Christian faith, one team leader told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...An 18-member performing troupe associated with the Mansfield, Ohio-based Alliance for Renewal Churches spent
17 days performing in Cuba</B>. Because the evangelical church is under persecution (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/072296.html">NIRR 7/22</A>), concerts could not
be arranged in advance, "but we were amazed how day by day we received invitations" to perform, the team leader
said. Since an aggressive evangelism team recently had been expelled from the country, the troupe toned down its
performances and "worked to make contacts so we could be invited back," the leader said. After performances, the
team handed out Bibles and talked individually with audience members about Christ. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Some 150,000 Christians are helping people in crisis through Stephen Ministries</B>. Developed in 1975 by Lutheran
pastor Kenneth Haugk, the St. Louis-based ministry is named after Saint Stephen, one of seven people commissioned
by the Apostles to care for the early Christians.
<BR><B>...Churches send a few members to a seven-day seminar to learn how to set up, administer, and maintain a local
ministry, news reports said</B>. Then they select others from their churches to become Stephen Ministers, giving them
50 hours of training in areas such as listening skills and hospital visitation. Stephen Ministers meet every week, or
as required with people in need. Everything said to a Stephen Minister is confidential.
<BR><B>...Stephen Ministers are not counselors and do not fix problems or manipulate people toward certain decisions, Haugk
said</B>. They mostly just listen and help the person reach a solution to their problem on their own.  NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Volunteers have prayed with 80,000 telephone callers since the Assemblies of God 1-800-4 PRAYER line began
taking calls in 1994 (NIRR 12/26/94)</B>. Two hundred people have become Christians, marriages have been restored,
jobs have been provided, physical healings have occurred, financial needs have been met, and people have been
delivered from drugs in answer to prayers, said Sandra Clopine, coordinator of the National Prayer Center. 
<BR><B>...Volunteers don't counsel callers, but simply pray with them</B>. They record only their first names and the state from
which they are calling. The most frequent topics for prayer are relationship problems and physical needs. Many
callers are involved with New Age beliefs, and some say they are Christians but live grossly immoral lifestyles,
Clopine said. Some have called the center from cellular phones while driving behind a car with a NPC bumper
sticker. Local Assemblies of God churches around the country are beginning to receive overflow calls from the
Prayer Center, located in Springfield, Mo. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Several Salvation Army groups have cut affiliations with the United Way in the last few years after having their
funding severely reduced</B>. Groups that have left the United Way include affiliates in Washington, D.C., West Palm
Beach and Key West, Fla., New Bern, N.C., and Harrisonburg, Va., Salvation Army spokesman Tom Jones said.
<BR><B>...In Washington, the UW increased the number of agencies it funds from 260 to 850, giving a smaller slice of the
pie to The Salvation Army, the American Red Cross, and the Boy Scouts</B>. Some of the new agencies help the poor,
while others deal with the environment and art. "The donors wanted a choice," said Brian Ferguson of the
Metropolitan Washington United Way. "There are other people out there doing God's work, and The Salvation Army
has to recognize that," he told NIRR. The Washington Salvation Army will try to make up the money by directly
asking businesses and the public for contributions. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Assemblies of God volunteers are giving away groceries and preaching to impoverished people in several Western
and Central states</B>. The outreaches, called Convoys of Hope, are scheduled in 50 cities in the next 12-18 months.
<BR><B>...Meeting people's material and spiritual needs is a powerful expression of the gospel, organizers say</B>. "We've been
at crusades where the altar call is given and people respond, but you wonder whether or not their salvation
experience is long-lasting or sincere," said Hal Donaldson, president of the ChurchCare America ministry. "As I
wandered through the people who flocked to the altars, the number with tears flowing was remarkable." The convoys
also include praise-and-worship music and gospel messages. In Fontana, Calif., 19 churches worked together to make
the outreach a success. Volunteers cheered when they learned that 2,000 decision cards were turned in. NIRR

<B>The number of new Catholic priests is growing on every continent except North America and Europe, according to
figures released by the Vatican</B>. From 1970-1994 the number of men studying to be priests rose from 72,991 to
105,075. Africa showed the greatest increase in that time, from 3,470 seminarians to more than 17,000. In Southeast
Asia, seminary enrollment nearly doubled to 23,943; the number of South American seminarians tripled to 17,808;
and in Central America the number doubled to 8,435. The numbers in Europe declined from 33,971 to 29,511, and
in North America from 14,365 to 5,692.
<BR><B>...The same regions also are gaining influence in the Church hierarchy, according to news reports</B>. A record 62
countries are represented in the College of Cardinals, the group that selects the pope. Although Italians and
Americans form the two largest blocs, the number of cardinals from Asia, Latin America, and Africa has increased
significantly during the papacy of John Paul II. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Three of the 10 fastest-growing congregations in the United States belong to The International Churches of
Christ-Boston movement (NIRR 5/17/93)</B>. ICCB congregations in Los Angeles and New York City were the
country's fastest growing from 1993-1994, the latest year for which statistics are available, according to researcher
John Vaughn. The Los Angeles ICCB church grew by 2,520 members to 7,711, and the New York church by 1,609
to 6,010 in that period, Vaughn reported in his newsletter Church Growth Today. Chicago Church of Christ grew
by 933 members, to 3,982, during that same period. 
<BR><B>...The ICCB, formerly known as the Boston Church of Christ, is an offshoot of the traditional Churches of Christ</B>.
The network moved its international center from Boston to a facility in inner-city Los Angeles that also serves as
the office center for the city's congregation.
<BR><B>...Among the 107 fastest-growing congregations are Southern Baptist (19%), Assemblies of God (15%), ICCB and
independent charismatic (9%), International Church of the Foursquare Gospel (6%), United Methodist (5%),
independent non-charismatic (5%), Evangelical Free Church (4%), and the Presbyterian Church in America (4%),

<B>God was invoked by female as well as male imagery during the United Church of Christ's national women's meeting
June 26-30 in Boston</B>. Some 1,600 women attended the convention. Workshops dealt with earth religions, goddess
worship, and animism as well as more traditional themes.
<BR><B>...Sharp criticism of the event came from the Biblical Witness Fellowship, a theologically conservative group within
the UCC (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/040196.html">NIRR 4/1</A>)</B>. Liz Claver, a BWF member who attended the convention, said that in a forum on Gaia Rising,
leader Sea Raven tried to communicate with the Greek earth goddess Gaia. In the forum on RE-Imagining, traditional
Christianity was termed "religious McCarthyism," Claver said. "A harvest of souls, requested in the opening liturgy,
happened here, but not by the Triune God of biblical Christianity." 
<BR><B>..."I don't believe we are calling up spirits," said Mary Susan Gast, a UCC official</B>. "This was not gnostic and
pagan." She defended the integrity of the convention, saying it reflected diversity within the denomination. The UCC
is not "monolithic," but encompasses "basic tensions because it is a church that accommodates a lot of viewpoints,"
Gast told NIRR. "I am a monotheist. We are talking about one God and Jesus Christ, Who loves us beyond merit." 
<BR><B>...Gast, an ordained UCC minister, officiated at a communion service while wearing an apron attached to her stole,
symbolizing "taking the ordinary and lifting it to God, tying our experience with the sacramental realm</B>." A pot of
dirt added to the traditional elements at the communion table symbolized connection to the earth. "Things look
different when women plan worship for women," Gast said. "But it doesn't mean it's corrupt or pagan." NIRR

<B>Two cases before the Supreme Court could determine the future of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act</B>. RFRA
requires government to show a compelling reason to restrict religious practice, then use the least-restrictive approach.
The court will announce whether it will hear the cases in early October.
<BR><B>...In Smith vs</B>. Fair Employment and Housing Commission (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/042996.html">NIRR 4/29</A>), a California court ruled that landlords
cannot use their religious beliefs to refuse to rent to an unmarried couple. The court said the state's ban on housing
discrimination based on marital status did not create a "substantial burden" on the property owner's freedom of

<B>The freedom of religion amendment is back before the House of Representatives after languishing for seven months</B>.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey's proposed amendment forbids the federal government and state governments
to "deny equal access to a benefit, or otherwise discriminate against any person on account of religious belief,
expression, or exercise." It would allow religious charitable groups, daycare centers, and schools to be eligible for
public funds or vouchers, the National Association of Evangelicals' Forest Montgomery told NIRR. The proposal
also specifies that the amendment does not authorize the government to "coerce or inhibit religious belief, expression,
or exercise."
<BR><B>...Supporters will push for a vote before the end of the session this summer, Montgomery said</B>. Armey proposed the
amendment after legislators failed to reach a compromise between competing proposals submitted by Reps. Henry
Hyde (R-Ill.) and Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) last year (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/030496.html">NIRR 3/4</A>). 
<BR><B>...Some religious groups contend that the amendment is unnecessary and violates separation of church and state</B>. "I'm
a born-again, Bible-bred, Texas-born Baptist preacher. And that's why I oppose any government meddling in my
religion," James M. Dunn of the Baptist Joint Committee said. Dunn and representatives of the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.), the United Methodist Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the United Church of Christ,
and Unitarian Universalist, Buddhist, and Jewish groups voiced their opposition at a news conference. They said the
proposal is part of a Republican effort to make religion an issue in the November elections. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>The abortion pill could be legal in the United States within six months as the result of a Food and Drug
Administration advisory panel recommendation approving it</B>. Tests of RU-486, also known as mifepristone, in France
and the United States show the drug induces abortion more than 95% of the time when taken within the first seven
weeks of pregnancy, the FDA was told.
<BR><B>...Abortion opponents said they would try to stop the drug's approval by stressing its side effects, which can include
severe contractions, headaches, dizziness, and heart palpitations</B>. Operation Rescue said it will find out which doctors
prescribe mifepristone because "women will call us and let us know," Rhonda Mackey, the group's spokeswoman,
told the Christian Science Monitor. 
<BR><B>...Surveys show that some doctors who shun surgical abortions might offer mifepristone, but how many would
administer the drug is uncertain</B>. Two days after taking mifepristone, women must take a second drug to cause uterine
contractions that expel the fetus. They then need another doctor's exam to catch failed abortions so they can be
finished surgically. FDA advisers said they were concerned that some women, especially the poor, might skip that
exam because they can't afford it, can't miss work, or can't find childcare. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>The outcome of a lawsuit against the Christian Coalition, filed by the U.S</B>. Federal Election Commission, could have

should be fined and begin disclosing how it raises and spends its money. The Washington Post reported that two
Republican members of the FEC joined two Democrats to support filing the suit. The other Democrat was absent
and the third GOP post is vacant. 
<BR><B>...The suit alleged that the coalition used its millions of voter guides as well as its conferences and direct mail to
encourage conservative voters to cast ballots for the GOP in the 1990, 1992, and 1994 elections</B>. It said the coalition
coordinated activities with the campaigns of former President George Bush, former U.S. Senate candidate Oliver
North of Virginia, U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia. To retain
its tax-free status, the coalition must refrain from promoting candidates.

<B>Radiocarbon tests on artifacts from Jericho may lend credence to stories in the Book of Exodus</B>. Grains from the
ancient city were dated to the early 16th century B.C., possibly near the time of events in Exodus, including the
plagues in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the Israelites' 40-year wanderings in the desert. That's according
to archaeologists Hendrik Bruins, a professor at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, and Johannes van
der Plicht of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. Geologists have suggested Egypt's plagues and the
Hebrew escape from Pharaoh's army could be attributed to the eruption of a volcano in the Mediterranean Sea in
1628 B.C, news reports said. 
<BR><B>...The dating shows that the fall of Jericho could have taken place about 45 years after the eruption</B>. "This time
difference is rather striking, as it could fit the desert period of 40 years separating the Exodus from the destruction
of Jericho mentioned in ancient Hebrew texts," the archaeologists wrote in the journal Nature. Other scholars said
the conclusions lack evidence. "The science was all fine," but Bruins and van der Plicht are "archaeologically naive
by trying to fit it all together," said Stuart Manning of the University of Rading in England. NIRR 08/05/96

walkers, who passed through Croatia last month, are distributing a statement of repentance. Sins committed against
Muslims during that time still embitter them against Christians.  
<P>
<B>Germany: Scientologists are being fired from jobs, barred from joining political parties and labor unions, and treated
as outcasts in the business community, their church leader Helmuth Blueth said</B>. "There is no other comparison but
to the Nazi era," said Blueth, who blames government officials for the situation. In January the minister for family
affairs said the church seeks "world domination and the destruction of our society." Another government official said
Scientologists should be barred from government and teaching jobs, and the postal service has objected to delivering
mail to church offices. The country's 16 states are considering placing the group under observation as an extremist
organization. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives have sent letters encouraging the U.S. Department of
State to address the problem.    
<P>
<B>Hungary: The head of Russia's Orthodox Church turned down an invitation to meet Pope John Paul II when the
pontiff visits Hungary this fall</B>. During his trip, the pope will celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of a Benedictine
monastery and meet bishops of the Hungarian church. Church officials also invited ROC Patriarch Aleksy II to the
meeting, hoping to dispel tensions over what the Orthodox Church sees as overzealous missionary work by Catholics
in Russia -- and possibly to plan a historic papal trip to Moscow. Aleksy II turned down the invitation because
conservative Orthodox leaders feared the pope was trying to extend Catholic influence over their church, news reports
said.
