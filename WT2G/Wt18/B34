<ADDRESS>
By Sharon Kimmelman
</ADDRESS>

<P>
For almost a decade, I have interviewed and gotten to know people
who have avoided, refused and stopped allowing the vaccination
of themselves and their children. Many, many hundreds. Could these
be the poor, dim-witted, negligent people the newspapers tell
us about? No, most didn't fit the first category, and none fitted
the last two. But they all participated in a clearly suspect and
subversive activity... namely: critical thinking.
<P>
If I get nothing else across, this is what I want you to know:
That you have the intellectual capacity and common sense to identify
and understand the facts about &quot;vaccine as cure&quot; and
that keeping your right to choose is essential to your continued
good health and freedom. Keep an open mind and heart. In the words
of Aldous Huxley, &quot;facts do not cease to exist because they
are ignored.&quot;
<P>
It is the common belief that vaccines are safe, effective, and
prevent disease. Five hundred years ago, the common belief about
Earth was that it was flat. When the belief changed, the Earth
was no more round than it had been. Our beliefs mold or color
our perception. When beliefs blind us completely, that's the time
to be concerned. Those of us raised in government schools have
been taught very rigorously that what we are told should take
precedence over our actual experience. That would explain why
so many mothers continue to return with their sickened children
to the pediatricians' offices for more vaccinations even as they
watch them grow sicker with every successive &quot;well baby&quot;
visit.
<P>
Injecting toxic substances into healthy people in the hopes of
averting disease was practiced by ancient Egyptians and abandoned.
In the early 1700's Turkish people believed the gods of disease
were appeased in this way. This was observed and brought back
to England. Vaccination has been adopted into common medical practice.
It is based on assumption, speculation. high tech superstition
and a flawed medical model which brags about sweeping claims of
safety and efficacy. Although there's lots of conjecture and supposition,
there is no pure or true science to back up the claims. To date,
there are no controlled studies (which include unvaccinated people)
for efficacy. Acute and chronic vaccine damage has been documented
from its earliest days.
<P>
In the USA, where multiple healing modalities abound, why is it
that vaccines are promoted as a cure? Part of it has to do with
the use of the language, a domineering corporate power and the
allegiance of the media. The familiar language of health has been
coopted by ConMed (the Conventional Medical Establishment). We
have a medical/military model of health which uses terms like
invade, attack, defend, enemy, army, soldiers, fight and destroy.
Our bodies seek harmony and balance of mind/body/spirit, not war.
This language encourages &quot;divide and conquer&quot;, forcing
a separation between mind and body so that what you believe is
at odds with what you feel.
<P>
Firstly, dis-ease is a condition, not a thing. Good health is
maintained through healthy practices, which center around nutrition,
dietary and otherwise. The fewer obstacles put in the path of
the healing process, the quicker one heals. The degree to which
this is not done is the approximate degree to which one is not
well. Chronic &quot;indiscretion&quot; can lead to serious disease
conditions. Symptoms are indications of healing and not of dying.
<P>
Eliminating symptoms through drugging, disabling one's body function
or removing the organ(s) involved does not produce better health.
<P>
Secondly, you can not make a healthy body sick unless you actually
poison it (vaccines contain poisons). Vaccines don't prevent dis-ease;
they cause dis-ease.
<P>
Thirdly, the assumption that every person is at risk for every
disease is erroneous. This comes from the flawed ConMed model
of health which teaches us that we are all at risk regardless
of what we eat, how we live and work and what we think. And that
our biology is faulty and frail and without drugs and medical
doctors the human race would surely perish. It's a powerful myth
when it is believed. Fortunately for us, it is anything but true.
<P>
To get a handle on health, it is essential to first identify the
word and the factors which influence it. For only then can you
use your powers of discrimination to actively maintain or regain
the good health with which the great majority of us were born.
Health is a continuum; it fits between birth and death and runs
the gamut from excellent to ill. It reflects the conditions present
in your life at the present time as well as those which have persisted
over time. In this process it is probable that our long asleep
intuition will awaken to assist to know what logic lacks.
<P>
Vacca is the Latin word for &quot;cow&quot;. Two hundred years
ago the smallpox vaccine was the pus from suppurating wounds inflicted
on cows. The industry has expanded its range of diseases and use
of biological fluids and tissues (monkeys, pigs, ducks, chickens,
etc. as well as human fetuses). Vaccines contain mercury, formaldehyde,
carbolic acid, aluminum, and a host of antibiotics and other drugs.
All are poisons.
<P>
Vaccines are injected in the hope of giving the person a mild
case of a disease to prevent a severe case. But if you disable
the system through vaccination, it stands to reason that the body's
response will not be seen in that particular way but as some other
manifestation. Then, of course, you can name a new dis-ease and
win a prize.
<P>
The word vaccine has become synonymous with the word cure. What
is not known or understood is the meaning of &quot;cure&quot;.
The dictionary states that cure specifically suggests &quot;the
elimination of disease, distress, evil, etc&quot; while heal means
&quot;making whole&quot;. Have you ever seen meat that doesn't
rot: salami, pastrami and Virginia ham? Well, they are cured.
Through chemical means the biological process is stopped, suspended,
halted. Often medical treatments and practices work to eliminate
disease by curing. And what of the rest of your body? The rest
of your life? The ConMed approach is to treat dis-ease as a thing
to cut out, burn off or poison. And what of you, the host? You
get injured, or worse.
<P>
One way to eliminate the risk is to remove the opportunity for
occurrence. The modern medical answer is prophylaxis, to prevent
or protect, by removing healthy tissue or disabling healthy (and
grossly misunderstood) function, to produce a state of symptomlessness.
(ln my book, that's synonymous with death.) Because of the enormous
funding of medical schools by the pharmaceutical companies, doctors
learn that for every symptom there is a medical drug, device or
treatment. The best they can do is to offer you what they know.
Their answers and explanations are expressed out of the same system.
If you expect differently, you run the risk of being disappointed,
at the very least. A macabre example of this is killing a person,
thereby eliminating all possibility of disease. Most of you have
probably heard the one-liner, &quot;The operation was a success
but the patient died.&quot; Unfortunately, this joke is a frequent
reality.
<P>
Where is the media in all this? We'd all like to believe that
they serve the individual with unbiased reporting. But one only
need look at the corporate sponsors to know for whom the media
speaks and to whom they are indebted. Not long ago, measles outbreaks
were reported in children and on college compuses. At the time,
there was pressure to step up vaccination programs. Well, according
to the Centers for Disease Control, ninety per cent of the reported
cases of measles were in people who had been appropriately vaccinated
for measles. Do you think the media bothered to report that? Do
you think that a statement like that might have shaken people's
confidence in vaccination? I do.
<P>
Scientific truths are rarely discussed openly in the media. Truths
can't be bought or sold but they can be suppressed
<P>
One of nature's immutable laws is that germs (bacteria, fungi,
algae and protozoa) are essential to the continuance of life and
cover every square millimeter of our biosphere. This includes
the space between your internal organs, on your eyes, under your
fingernails and in your intestines. Billions upon billions of
them. Everywhere! Germs are life, they support and further life.
Germs are extremely adaptable to changes in the environment. They
proliferate, die back or change based on conditions present.
<P>
A simple example: If you neglect your biological needs in a big
way, more cells in your body will die, creating an overload of
metabolic and other wastes. This is picked up by the lymph system
and ushered to your tonsils (very essential organs of elimination)
which swell. Bacteria are signaled to reproduce to meet the needs
for sanitation. They come to the area to break down the waste
so its components can either be reused or eliminated. The ConMed
view is that the bacteria caused the waste and therefore must
be killed, hence the use of antibiotics. As the old saying goes,
&quot;Bacteria cause dis-ease like flies cause garbage.&quot;
So you see, killing off bacteria with drugs: (1) adds foreign
toxic agents to your own waste, (2) disables your body's healing
process and (3) imbalances your internal flora and fauna, upsetting
your biochemistry.
<P>
I am surprised by the amount of credit given to medical doctors
as a group. Do you think, that in a body's profusion of germs,
ConMed is talented enough to find the seven or eight deadly ones?
Long after it was found that scurvy is caused by the lack of fresh
fruits and vegetables in the diet, the medical doctors continued
to search for a microbe as the culprit. And why would ConMed suggest
using AZT, a drug which was booted out of cancer drug trials because
of its carcinogenicity, on people who are supposed to be sick,
sometimes symptomless, sometimes not?
<P>
The complex set of specific dis-ease conditions of immune malfunction,
commonly lumped together under the name &quot;AIDS&quot;, will
no more be alleviated by a vaccine than have any of the other
dis-eases which vaccines have complicated and forced to be renamed.
Since vaccination is in itself an immuno-suppressive treatment,
it's not the way to go.
<P>
I agree with Dr. Dean Black when he says &quot;The false premise
cannot sustain itself.&quot; Like bloodletting and leeching, vaccination
will go the way of other formerly accepted medical practices.
<P>
It must.

<H1>The Focal Point Hypothesis of AIDS</H1>

<ADDRESS>
by 
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Goya captioned one of his most powerful etchings &quot;The Sleep
of Reason Produces Monsters&quot;. He might have added, &quot;So
does Political Expediency&quot;!
<P>
In the heady days when Robert Gallo was still being venerated
as the discoverer of 'The probable cause of AIDS', before the
scientific sleaze and international filching of viral isolates
came to light, he was asked by a deferential reporter what made
him first think that a retrovirus might be the cause of AIDS.
Gallo's reply, departing from the kind of quip we would later
come to recognise as typical 'Gallo's humour'*, was ambiguous
- &quot;We needed a focal point.&quot; Did the Saviour of Mankind
let the cat out of the bag almost from the outset? With the benefit
of hindsight, more then a decade later, it is worth examining
that sentence more thoroughly in order to understand how this
focal pointillism came to dominate AIDS research.
<P>
The Latin legal phrase <I>cui bono?</I> gives us the key to understanding
the way that AIDS research developed. It translates roughly as
'who benefits?', meaning who stood to profit, and is usually associated
with trying to find the motive behind a crime. So far the only
people who have consistently failed to profit from the 'focal
point' AIDS hypothesis in terms of survival are people with AIDS.
<P>
So who did stand to profit from proving that a retrovirus was
the single cause of AIDS? Obviously, 'experts' in retrovirology,
of whom Gallo was one. Indeed, he was by 1981 the golden boy of
cancer research, smothered with fame and awards for appearing
to show that a human retrovirus could, after all, cause a form
of cancer, namely Adult T-Cell leukaemia. It is worth noting here
that this form of cancer was unknown to the medical profession
until 1975, some five years after Howard Temin et al. discovered
the phenomenon of reverse transcription, and the intensive study
of the newly dubbed 'retroviruses', and their relevance to disease,
clinical or otherwise, began. We are meant to believe that a disease
should conveniently appear five years after the discovery of its
potential cause, which smacks of precognitive serendipity allied
to wishful thinking rather than true science. In 1987 the world's
leading retrovirologist Peter Duesberg elegantly demolished the
retroviral causation of this rare cancer in a paper in the journal
Cancer Research, and at the same time declared HIV to be a harmless
passenger virus, and not sufficient or necessary to cause AIDS,
another previously unknown illness. Robert Gallo, by then elevated
to the Papacy of AIDS research, never forgave the Martin Luther
of retrovirology. Duesberg was not the first Prophet without honour
to be elbowed aside by lesser men in their frantic pursuit of
dishonourable profit.
<P>
Despite clear early epidemiological evidence that AIDS was restricted
to certain groups of people who all had a specific prior reason
to be immunocompromised, in order to link them together and classify
AIDS as an infectious disease, a unifying factor had to be sought
- a 'focal point' in fact. Such Cartesian reductionism would allow
many people to acquire profitable relevance to the threatened
epidemic, soon to be conflated into a global pandemic. If AIDS
could be marketed as an infectious disease caused by a transmissible
agent, then the Centers For Disease Control, who had been twiddling
their thumbs since the polio epidemic fizzled out in the 50's,
could expand and start to track the spread of the illness; the
Republican administration could affect to be concerned about AIDS
without appearing to pander to the dangerously vociferous gay
community and thereby risk the wrath of their traditional redneck
homophobic voters; a 'focal point' pathogen would give the pharmaceutical
industry, ever agog with altruism, unlimited scope for marketing
preventive vaccines and medicines; even the Press would make a
few extra bucks, as nothing sells newspapers so well as dire news
and moral indignation, and sodomy sells copy even more profitably
than straight canaille canoodling.
<P>
A puzzling factor was the readiness of the gay community to embrace
the 'focal point' hypothesis. Our gullibility was originally hard
to fathom until it could be seen for what it was -a pragmatic
acquiecence for reasons of gay politics and the survival of our
hard-won but precarious liberation.
<P>
AIDS was originally called Gay Related Immune Deficiency or GRID,
much to the alarm and anger of the gay community, who quite understandably,
after millennia of persecution, felt discriminated against and
threatened by a seemingly judgmental acronym. GRID labelled the
disease as a specifically gay problem, unlikely to receive much
sympathy from the straight population, or attract much in the
way of government spending to remedy the illness, it being seen
as self-inflicted. Indeed, there were early signs of hostility
from a predominantly homophobic society never very anxious to
spend tax dollars on health care. This led the militant members
of the gay community to go along with an infectious agent hypothesis
of the origin of AIDS, and the logical consequent assumption that
it would eventually be everyone's problem, thereby deflecting
the heat from themselves. As Dr. Joe Sonnabend observed to me,
&quot;The virus theory absolved gays from responsibility for AIDS.&quot;
The scientific community went along with this, and a lot of the
soon-to-be demobbed army of retrovirologists fired up their electron
microscopes and prepared for battle on behalf of their unlikely
gay allies. The difference between an illness restricted to a
grudgingly tolerated group of men, and a catastrophic disease
threatening the entire population lay in hugely increased grant
funding and very rich pickings for the researchers concerned.
Several of the failed cancer researchers of the 70's are millionaires
in the 90's, due to their status as 'AIDS experts'.
<P>
The US administration went along with the strategic charade. Nothing
unites a people behind the government of the day more than war
fever whether it be a foreign war or the war against AIDS, and
Reagan's rednecks could assume a virtue though they had it not.
The cause of political correctness would be served and everyone
could feel worthy - but first it had to be shown that not only
gay men had contracted the illness. The epidemiologists got busy
with a will, eagerly misinterpreting the appearance of 'clusters'
of AIDS cases to conform to the infectious, transmissible disease
model. The first group to add in were the 'needle sharing' drug
addicts. They were a godsend to the 'everyone is at risk' ploy,
especially as nobody thought to point out that drug addicts were
already very sick people at high risk of less than average life
expectancy, with or without HIV, or that the overwhelming majority
of gay cases of AIDS were amongst men heavily addicted to recreational
drugs and poppers. All the studies carried out since the 1960's,
when the growing threat of drug addiction was first observed,
detailing the life-threatening illnesses and premature death of
people addicted to illegal drugs, were conveniently swept aside,
and everyone ignored the fact that the drugs were primarily responsible
for their generally wretched state of health. The Virus from Hell
was well on its way. It had merely struck the gays and the drug
addicts first, but would rapidly pose a threat to everyone - or
so they predicted.
<P>
Soon Haitians and haemophiliacs were added to the growing number
of 'high risk' groups, the latter being very important in justifying
the infectious agent origin of AIDS. Still no-one thought to point
out that they were all sick anyway for group specific reasons,
and with group-specific diseases. Attempts to co-opt prostitute
women into the 'high risk' groups failed, as AIDS seemed to discriminate
against them unless they were also drug addicts. It did not seem
to matter much that a genuine epidemic is not restricted to 'risk'
groups, but spreads exponentially through the whole susceptible
population. It seems astonishing today that no-one asked a very
simple question - &quot;Would all these people have been healthy
without the 'focal point' infection?&quot; The honest answer would
have been an embarrassing &quot;No!&quot; so the question was
never asked. Correlation was seized on as proof of causation,
and designer science and virtual virology prevailed in overcoming
logic, common sense and scientific method to produce a predetermined
result.
<P>
Thus the scientific community was thought to have identified the
disease and found the cause; the medical profession would do their
blindfolded best to deal with those who fell sick; the pharmaceutical
companies were eager to provide remedies and nostrums at luxury
prices; the US government gave the impression that they were on
top of the problem; and the general public was reassured that
the terror would soon be under control. It would cost billions,
but it was considered money well spent, especially by the devisors
of the focal point theory who pocketed a lion's share of the cash
and the kudos. The only people who did not seem to benefit were
the people with AIDS, but they were considered as irrelevant as
they were expendable, and trampled under foot by the accelerating
stampede towards the AIDS-research gold fields. Patient doctors,
nurses and voluntary gay care organisations could only comfort
the dying.
<P>
This focal point, this ambiguous smudge on a micrograph, this
lethal dot over the 'i' of AIDS became the black spot presaging
death in Treasure Island, the invariably fatal maguffin. Simultaneously
it became the microscopic foundation stone of a gigantic belief
system with all its hugely profitable ancillary growth industries,
from 'AIDS counselling' to red ribbon manufacture, body bag makers
to snake oil salesmen. Even the ingenious fraudsters who wrought
the Holy Shroud never enjoyed such success. Just as that ingenious
clout was constructed as a stage prop 'focal point' to bolster
faith in a belief system, wring money from the gullible and manipulate
the credulous, so HIV was intended to have the same effect. Compared
to the multibillion dollar HIV hoax run by the NIH Mafia, the
Turin Windingsheet Mob were merely running a back alley crapshoot.
Whereas the Holy Shroud symbolised eternal life - New Testament
newspeak for death - HIV symbolises inevitable death, and highly
toxic AZT would be the inexorable extreme unction, the officially
sanctioned euthanasia.
<P>
The gullible bought the whole sick belief system, and apocalypse
chic was marketed in good time to cash in on the traditional fin
de siecle malaise.
<P>
By purveying terror and despair, from which only HIV's inventors
could deliver us, the scientific cynics struck a vein of gold
usually reserved for the makers and purveyors of horror films.
By concentrating on the minutia of gay sex techniques, they could
even work in the prurience so beloved of the Church, the impotent
and the tabloid press. The obsession with anal sex became the
new fundamentalism, and the anally retentive in pursuit of the
rectally receptive was just one of the diversions afforded by
the new 'Virus from Hell' belief system.
<P>
By &quot;We needed a focal point&quot; Gallo was stating a political
fact. The truth is that the cause of AIDS was already correctly
surmised by 1982, but a political hot potato. There was no way
the governments of the USA and Europe could say to the gay community
that they should modify their sexual behaviour without risking
a direct confrontation with a militant minority group, and in
so doing appearing to be bigoted and repressive. After giving
the matter some thought, it was realised that blaming the Virus
from Hell would have beneficial side effects - the wrong explanation
would have the right results. Terror of the 'focal point' would
promote the use of condoms, thereby helping to cut down on the
number of sexually transmitted diseases, which had reached epidemic
proportions and were beginning to show signs of resistance to
known antibiotics. Sexual terror would also promote condom use
in poor heterosexuals in the developed as well as the Third World,
who had a tiresome habit of breeding too many children. If the
numbers of AIDS cases appeared to decline due to 'safer sex',
then they merely added new diseases to the syndrome to keep the
numbers up. No-one really wanted to kill the virus that lays the
golden eggs, even if they could. When women wanted a slice of
the action, because HIV benefits were more generous than those
given for conventional illnesses, they were catered for by adding
cervical cancer to the list of 29 AIDS-defining diseases; Africa
was brought into the system by adding pulmonary tuberculosis,
endemic in poor countries. The HIV Mafia had covered all the bases.
<P>
Although paying lip service to the dangers inherent in drug addiction,
these were played down. As long as injecting drug users used clean
equipment, it was considered safe to drink their cyanide out of
a clean glass. Coincidentally, it would also help to cut down
on the spread of viruses like Hepatitis B and the septic&#190;mia
endemic amongst needle users. In an unholy alliance between the
authorities and the drug barons, the dangers from the drugs themselves
were played down for everyone's benefit except current and future
addicts.
<P>
Promoting the use of the DNA chain terminator drugs AZT, ddI and
ddC was a master stroke in dispelling wavering belief in the ability
of the 'focal point' to cause AIDS. By using drugs which could
be guaranteed to kill, producing side effects indistinguishable
from symptoms of AIDS, the belief that HIV was the cause of death
was maintained, and AIDS accelerated. What the virus had never
been proved to achieve could be accomplished by the very drugs
used to 'treat' it. Again, the belief system remained intact and
all the interested groups benefited - except the people with AIDS.
<P>
The original 'focal point' or HIV=AIDS hypothesis has been tried
and found lacking. After billions have been spent, public health
programmes mounted, medicines tried and tested, there is still
no hope of a cure or a vaccine, and not one life has been saved.
Most importantly, not one prediction based on the original hypothesis
has ever been fulfilled, even by juggling the figures, changing
the criteria for diagnosis, and adding new diseases into the syndrome
to boost the flagging numbers. The general epidemic so confidently
promised never materialised as heterosexuals stayed away from
AIDS in droves, although STDs and unwanted pregnancies continued
to rise. Luc Montagnier, the true discoverer of the 'focal point'
on which so much AIDS careerism was founded, recently admitted
that AIDS in the West was no longer a problem, and that attention
should now be focused on a hapless Third World. When the show
begins to get the bird in Europe, they can take it on a world
tour, but it's doubtful it will play to packed houses in Africa
and the Far East now word is out the show is jinxed, and it only
ever had a limited audience.
<P>
Necessity being the mother of invention, she duly spawned a 'focal
point', HIV, sired on her by expediency still moist from his previous
rape of scientific principle. The unscrupulous scientists and
medical community eagerly stood godparents to this bastard offspring,
and set about making sure that more legitimate claimants to the
causation of AIDS went unheard. They were shrewd enough to know
that the whole advertising industry is predicated on the belief
that invention is the mother of necessity. Thus more logical and
plausible hypotheses about the true cause of AIDS were denied
a hearing or research funding, and the tenuous, scientifically
risible legends surrounding a dormant retrovirus became the official
dogma of AIDS causation. Well might E.H.Waddington have said,
&quot;The most formidable barrier to the advancement of science
is the conventional wisdom of the dominant group.&quot; Make that
'expedient wisdom' or 'con-ventional expediency' and you have
the situation in a nutshell.
<P>
Any attempt to question the 'focal point' hypothesis is either
contemptuously ignored or shrilly denounced as irresponsible,
and likely to confuse the public; just the reasons traditionally
used by the Church to dispel attempts at reformation. This is
as good as admitting that the theory of HIV is merely an expedient
myth, designed originally to reassure worried people whilst simultaneously
terrorising them into changing their lifestyle. To seek explanations
for the myriad scientific paradoxa which soon came to light after
the adopting of the HIV=AIDS=DEATH dogma was seen by the authorities
as subversive, and stamped out where possible. However, as Thomas
Kuhn points out, anomalies are invariably ignored by holders of
the current paradigm, but are the means of its overthrow. A corrupt
oligarchy knows how to protect itself - for a time.
<P>
The final, sickening phase of the charade is even now being played
out. Forty volunteers with no high risk behaviour are being co-opted
to test a vaccine against HIV. Kate Copstick, a compassionate,
sincerely concerned young woman unconnected with any high risk
behaviour and at zero risk of AIDS, has agreed to receive this
trial vaccine. The hope is that this will protect her from future
infection with HIV. No-one will care that her own naturally generated
antibodies would have protected her in that unlikely event. How
will the vaccine be challenged? Will she be told to go out and
have a lot of unprotected sex or share dirty syringes, just to
see if the vaccine works? Once she is producing antibodies induced
by the vaccine, how will she know if she has been subsequently
infected by HIV? Will she be encouraged to donate blood, or will
she be warned not to? If no-one can tell the difference between
vaccine antibodies and those caused by a 'natural' infection,
where will this leave the blood supply? Is this merely the thin
end of a particularly nasty wedge whereby gay men will be told
not to donate blood if they have received the vaccine for fear
of confusing the issue? If the virus mutates as rapidly as is
claimed, how will a vaccine against a current strain protect against
future strains? What of the AIDS researchers and vaccine experts
who warned that it may be the antibodies themselves causing AIDS
via some unexplained autoimmune mechanism? Can we be sure the
vaccine will not generate lethal lymphocytotoxic antibodies?
<P>
All this has obviously been given due thought, and the cynical
reasoning goes like this. Since Montagnier has spilled the beans
that AIDS is no longer a threat in Europe, the gravy train is
slowing down. One final moneymaking scam is possible and worth
a try, one final screw of the twist. As AIDS figures decline,
due to gay men cleaning up their act and lessening their risk
behaviour, the purifying of haemophiliac clotting factor, and
free needle exchange combined with less Draconian laws for drug
addicts, the credit will be given to the wonder vaccine, and its
manufacturers will make a fortune out of ridding us of the epidemic
that never was. Remember the joke about the man in Oxford Street
using an aerosol spray? When asked why by a policeman, he explained
he was getting rid of the elephants. When the policeman pointed
out there were no elephants in Oxford Street, the man smiled triumphantly
and said, &quot;There you are you see! It's working, isn't it!&quot;
Only a cretin could believe that an aerosol would rid Oxford Street
of an imagined infestation with pachyderms. The really sick probability
is that inevitable future cases of AIDS will be reclassified,
in order to protect the reputation and sales of the useless vaccine.
They have already done this with the 4,500 or so recorded cases
of clinically diagnosed AIDS who don't have HIV infection. They
are classified as Idiopathic T4 Cell Lymphocytopoenia cases -
medical jargonese for AIDS without HIV. How can a vaccine protect
against irresponsible high risk behaviour, STDs and contaminated
street drugs or poppers? Remember that the black spot brought
to Cap'n Billy Bones at the beginning of 'Treasure Island' frightened
him to death. The black spot was delivered by someone who instinctively
understood the psychological power of terror, even though he could
never see it. He was blind. Blind Pugh personifies all the doctors
of the world who give an HIV positive diagnosis to patients, sentencing
them to psychological death, then hurrying them trustingly to
their graves by giving them nucleoside analogue drugs like AZT,
and all in the name of a 'focal point' which has never been proved
to do anything or cause anything biologically except stimulate
an antibody response. It is time to stop asking 'how' HIV causes
AIDS. The new focal point must be how to help people with AIDS
to recover their health, and prevent future generations damaging
theirs. We must warn them that whether the trip to the crematorium
begins with the first curious sniff of poppers, the first snort
of cocaine or the first desperate gulp of AZT 'the smoke goes
up the chimney just the same'.<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B><p>There are three things that all people need to survive on this earth: air,
water, and green plants. Neither the level of
development of their country, nor their race, religion, gender, sexual
orientation, or HIV status plays a role here.</p>

<p>Unfortunately as individuals, we can’t do much to control the quality of the
air we breathe. Getting that control will take more advanced social organization
than we have right now. Water quality is a little easier for each of us to improve.
If  tap water is not pure, we can boil, filter or distill it or buy clean water
from reputable companies to protect ourselves.</p>

<p>Green plants are the foundation of everything we eat. Even meat eaters prefer
the meat from animals that eat green plants to the meat from animals that eat
other animals. The exception to this rule is the fish we like to eat. They
usually feed on each other.</p>

<p>The green plants that we eat are popularly divided into fruits, vegetables,
beans and grains. Until recently we categorized the components of these foods as
vitamins, minerals, fiber, fat, protein or carbohydrates. Some components were
further classified as antioxidants.</p>

<p>Now because of the discovery of chemical compounds that do not fit neatly into
any of the older categories, scientists have created a new category called
phytochemical. Most people have heard of beta carotene, one of the best known of
the thousands of phytochemicals. Now we know that there are at least 600 other
carotenes. Beta carotene in plants is the precursor of vitamin A in animals. But we do not yet know
the relationship between beta and the 600 other carotenes. Some other
phytochemicals are indoles, over 1700 varieties of bioflavonoids, isothiocyanates
and allium compounds. This list of phytochemicals is far from complete and will
continue to grow as more research is done.</p>

<p>The next logical question is, of what importance to our health is this
information about phytochemicals? Some scientists believe that eating more
vegetables containing these phytochemicals will help protect us against certain
diseases. For example there is a phytochemical in soybeans and soybean products
like tofu and tempeh  that is believed to inhibit the growth of new blood vessels
that cancer cells need to develop. Without this new blood supply, the young
cancer cells will not get the nutrients they need to grow and will not get any
larger than the head of a pin. It is also believed that lycopene, another
carotene found in tomatoes and strawberries, is probably a protective agent
against prostate cancer. We now believe that eating green and yellow vegetables
can protect us against bladder, breast, cervical, lung, mouth, throat, ovarian
and stomach cancers. According to the National Cancer Institute, approximately
thirty-five percent of all cancer cases may be caused by a poor diet one that is
low in fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>Does this new discovery of phytochemicals mean that we can expect to see
bottles of phytochemical pills on the shelves of health food stores? Probably.
But not because it is good nutrition. Two points must be kept in mind. The first
is that we can only put into a pill what we know we have taken out of a natural
product. Very little is known about how these chemicals work. Perhaps there is a
relationship between some or all of the carotenes that allow the lycopene to
work. Maybe it is the lycopene, fiber, vitamin C connection. Maybe it is the distribution of the phytochemicals in the
plant’s watery medium. These are all unknowns. Therefore we don’t know what to
put into the pill to make it work properly in our bodies.</p>

<p>The second point is, why bother processing these phytochemicals?. Vegetables
are readily available. They are delicious to eat and we don’t have to know what
they are composed of for them to work well in our bodies. Broccoli will not turn
into pistachio ice cream and loose all its nutrients if we cannot list all of its
disease-fighting properties.</p>

<p>My advice therefore is to eat at least five servings of <font

color="#00ff00">green</font> and <font color="#ffff00">yellow</font> vegetables
every day, Snack on citrus fruits, berries and grapes. Add some tofu or other
soybean product to your protein allowance, and take a multivitamin/mineral
supplement for insurance. This way you will cover all your bases. Remember the
darker-colored parts of fruits and vegetables usually have higher concentrations
of phytochemical and some other valuable nutrients. For example, in a single head
of lettuce the dark green leaves are richer than the white or light-tinted
leaves.</p>

<title>NATAP: combination protease inhibitor studies needed</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<a href="../index.html"><h4>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3>We Need Studies of Combining 2 Protease Inhibitors!!</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>One thing is clear from the phase III clinical studies of Abbott, Merck and Roche: when initiating therapy, for the first time, with a protease inhibitor, the optimal way to benefit from this therapy( to delay resistance and possibly to maximize the initial viral load reduction and CD4 rise) is to use a 3-drug combination (including a protease inhibitor) and these 3 drugs ought to be drugs never before taken. That is the optimal way to use a protease inhibitor. Of course, for many individuals, with years of prior antiretroviral (AZT, d4T, ddI, etc) drug use, that is not so easy. If you cannot start therapy with drugs you have never before taken, the best approach is to try to pick accompanying drugs (with the protease inhibitor) that you are the least likely to have resistance to; pick drugs that will give you the most antiviral effect.</p>

<p>This is still a barrier for many individuals who have used up treatment options because they've extensively used all available nucleosides or cannot tolerate some of them. What is this person supposed to do? A possible option is: maybe there is a nucleoside that you haven't taken for a period of time, such as a year or two. Another option that has not been yet adequately researched is combining two protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>It is just for this reason that I have been pressuring the protease manufacturers to do this research. I have been lobbying the protease manufactuers for 2 years to initiate this type of research (i.e. combining 2 protease inhibitors). Abbott was the first to initiate this type of research with the beginning of their saquinavir/ritonavir clinical studies in this past December. However, they were lobbying Roche to initiate this research as early as the Summer of 1995, but, it is my understanding, Roche was unwilling to cooperate. After saquinavir was approved, Abbott didn't need Roche to cooperate, because Abbott could just buy the drug to conduct the studies. Then, Roche seemed to want to collaborate.</p>

<p>I have been discussing with Merck the need to study Crixivan in combination with saquinavir for a long time. They have been saying, they were waiting for the new more potent formulation of saquinavir to be available for this study. Now that it is finally available, Merck has announced they are starting this research effort in about a month's time.</p>

<p>It is very important that Agouron and Glaxo Wellcome initiate the same type of research with their inhibitors. We must know if we can safely combine 2 inhibitors and achieve additive or synergistic benefits from so doing. The Glaxo protease, now called VX-478, seems to have a unique potential for combination with other protease inhibitors. The resistance or mutation profile identified by Glaxo for VX-478 is a unique one. There appears to be minimal overlap with the resistance or mutation profiles of other inhibitors. Written reports of Glaxo in vitro research have indicated a possible special relationship from combining saquinavir with VX-478. Resistance to 1 of the 2 drugs may be reversible after initiating therapy with the other.</p>

<p>The first primary concern of most drug companies is to conduct the studies necessary to attain approval for marketing from the FDA. This means the usual phase I, II, and III studies that will hopefully demonstrate the drug's safety and efficacy adequate enough for accelerated approval. In the current environment, the situation is now unique. When Glaxo conducts its phase II and phase III studies of VX-478, 3 other protease inhibitors will be accessible to anyone because they are approved and on the market.</p>

<p>How are they going to factor this into the design of their trials? They could allow study participants to take any approved drugs and then randomize these study participants to add VX-478 or a VX-478 placebo. This would necessitate a large and expensive study. In order to prepare for this type of study, they would have to conduct studies establishing the safety of combining approved inhibitors with VX-478. However, the results of this type of clinical research would begin to give us some clues to understanding combining 2 protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>One approach that I would suggest is to conduct small trials examining the combination of 2 protease inhibitors, and to do this parallel to the phase II and III studies. The actual design of these studies would need to be worked out, but I think a feasible study design is attainable.</p>

<p>Regardless of how it is accomplished, a primary question that needs to be addressed is: the safety and efficacy of combining 2 protease inhibitors. I urge Glaxo Wellcome to pursue this train of research for people with AIDS who need these answers soon.</p>

<title>NATAP: open letter to FDA commissioner re viral load tests</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<a href="../index.html"><h4>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3>An open letter to the FDA Commissioner 5/8/96</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Dr. David Kessler<br>
FDA Commissioner<br>
5600 Fishers Lane<br>
Bethesda, MD</p>

<p align=center><b>THIS LETTER IS BEING OPENLY DISTRIBUTED TO OUR COMMUNITY</b></p>

<p>Dear Dr. Kessler,</p>

<p>I'd like to take this opportunity to again thank you, Dr. David Feigal and your staff at the FDA, for the quick processing of the Abbott, Merck and Roche applications, which led to the speedy approvals for these drugs and their subsequent availability for people with HIV or AIDS. Although the Antiviral Committee empaneled for the Norvir hearing was very difficult, due to the deft handling of the situation by you and Dr. Feigal, we were able to leave the hearings with an approval in hand. You are to be congratulated for this work.</p>

<p>I am concerned about the continuation of this type of effort by you and the FDA. As you well know, it is crucial that the efforts applied by the FDA to effect such speedy approvals be equally applied to future AIDS-related applications.</p>

<p>Currently in development are some HIV antivirals which are equally important, to people with HIV or AIDS, as Crixivan, Invirase and Norvir; it is crucial that these drugs are also brought along as quickly as feasible. These drugs include: Agouron's Viracept, Upjohn's protease inhibitor, Glaxo Wellcome's 1592U89 and 141W94 (Glaxo's protease inhibitor). I hope that the FDA is working as closely with these companies on planning, as you were with Merck, Roche and Abbott, so that the same speedy track to approval can be realized. As well, Agouron and Glaxo Wellcome have been advised by community advocates, that an expanded access program for each of their drugs, as soon as possible, is vital to our needs. I hope the FDA will factor in expanded access programs, in your discussions with the drug companies.</p>

<p>Of particular concern to me, many other treatment advocates and people with HIV or AIDS is an issue of more immediate significance. I attended the recent FDA hearing of Roche Diagnostic's application for its viral load test - the PCR kit. The opinions expressed by some of the joint Committee members were very disconcerting to me. Many of them seemed more interested in focusing on and repeatedly enumerating the pitfalls of making the viral load test widely available; rather than supporting the need to use the test and trying to figure a way to resolve the concerns. Unquestionably, there is some uncertainty about the full scope of how to use this technology; we don't yet have a full understanding of how to interpret the test results of monitoring therapy; we don't yet have "threshold" scores which we can use to apply to making treatment changes. But future studies will be exploring these concerns and other questions that need addressing.</p>

<p>However, even considering these shortcomings, the need for approval of these tests is overwhelming. The FDA has approved 3 protease inhibitors based on CD4 and viral load benefits; I maintain, if an individual starts a protease inhibitor therapy, they need to take a viral load test to measure the effect of the drug. If there is no change in viral load, the individual may want to discontinue this therapy and change to another; there is an inherent right to access of this information. Without FDA approval of the viral load tests (both Roche's and Chiron's tests), access to these tests will be limited; reimbursement for the cost of the test will not be uniformly forthcoming without FDA approval, so certain populations will be inequitably deprived of access to the test. It is vital to the interests of our community, that the FDA design an adequate indication for use of this test. This indication will need to incorporate language which accommodates the need for individuals to take the test multiple times during a year; an indication merely for prognosis is inadequate as it may discourage reimbursers from paying for testing 4 or 5 times (or as needed) during the course of a year; this would defeat the purpose for approval. The joint Committee did seem to agree that the test measures what it claims to measure - antiviral activity of a drug. The indication should at least support that statement.</p>

<p>It is my belief that you agree with me regarding my above statements and that you support the FDA approval of these tests. At the recent FDA Roche hearing, I suggested in the open discussion, that the manufacturers - Roche Diagnostics and Chiron - in conjunction with the NIH, should develop a comprehensive educational program, to teach doctors and patients how to best use the test (based upon our state of knowledge at this point). An approval conditioned upon this qualification would be appropriate for all parties concerned; at the hearing, the objection to approval raised by some panelists was based on their claim that many doctors and patients may misuse the test results. It would be improper and unfair of the FDA to withhold access to this test for those who will use it properly just because some others may not use it properly. </p>

<p>I am writing to you because it has been 6 weeks since the hearing, and myself and others are growing concerned that the FDA is taking too long on this issue, and that they may not approve the test. Please keep me apprised of the status of the review process for this new important technology. </p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Jules Levin</p>

<title>NATAP: Abbott meeting 2/20/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<a href="../index.html"><h4>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3>PROTEASE INHIBITOR REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES 3/20/96</h3>

<blockquote><p>March 20, 1996. Washington, D.C. On Monday, March 18, I attended an all-day meeting to discuss reimbursement issues related to protease inhibitors. I'm remaining in Washington, because on Thursday March 21, the FDA is holding a hearing to consider approval of the viral load tests; presentations will be made by Roche Molecular Systems about their PCR test and by Chiron Diagnostics about their bDNA test. I hope to report to you about the proceedings of this hearing and important subject. Many of us in the community (both doctors and people with HIV) are anxious for the FDA to approve these tests so we can better access them.</p>

<p>As all may know, just as we are bringing to market for widespread availability 3 protease inhibitors, our mechanisms for funding HIV treatments are beginning to narrow. Although protease inhibitors, as a class of drugs, appear to be vastly more potent anti-HIV treatment than all other available drugs, they are also vastly more expensive. The wholesale prices for a year's supply are: ritonavir (Norvir)--$6300, indinavir (Crixivan)--$4380, saquinavir (Invirase)--$5800. For comparison's sake AZT, ddI, ddC, D4T and 3TC all cost between $2000 and $3000 per year.</p>

<p>There are many reimbursement concerns surrounding protease inhibitors. It is uncertain how many insurers were prepared immediately after the Merck and Abbott approvals to decide about reimbursement. There is concern that some insurers will be mired in prolonged discussions about whether or not they will pay for these drugs. Many of the reimbursers may set policies that will severely limit overall access to these drugs. Some private or public insurers may not cover these drugs at all. Further, we are concerned about their willingness to reimburse for the use of a protease inhibitor in its most effective way--- as part of a multi-drug combination; obviously, an even more expensive proposition; but, the only real effective utility of a protease inhibitor is in a multi-drug combination.</p>

<p><b>RESISTANCE and MULTI-DRUG THERAPY</b><br>
 A brief explanation is in order about the rationale for multi-drug combination therapy, before continuing with the discussion of reimbursement issues. Resistance is a problem with monotherapy use of a protease inhibitor; it is highly recommended to use a protease inhibitor in combination to delay resistance.</p>

<p>Protease inhibitor studies conducted over the course of this last year, indicate that the best responses, as measured by CD4 and RNA, are acheived with an effective multi-drug combination, which includes a protease inhibitor. This has been shown by: the Abbott French Study #208, which examines AZT/ddC/ritonavir; the Merck #035 study, which examines AZT/3TC/indinavir; and Merck's study of AZT/ddI/indinavir. Roche studies conducted to-date indicate saquinavir is more effective in a 3-drug regimen; early Agouron study results indicate multi-drug treatment with Viracept is more effective tham monotherapy, although so far Agouron has studied only a 2-drug combination of Viracept & d4T. The data from these studies are fully explained in numerous articles on the NATAP Website <a href="../index.html">homepage</a>.</p>

<p>Although explained in other protease inhibitor articles on NATAP's homepage, it is important to re-emphasize the meaning of an "effective multi-drug combination." The optimal therapy is one where an individual has had no prior exposure to any of the drugs used in the combination. Prolonged prior use may reduce its efficacy in this newly initiated therapy.</p>

<p>The Abbott #247 study for individuals with under 100 CD4 is the only trial so far demonstrating clinical endpoint benefits (prolonged survival and delayed progression to AIDS).</p>

<p>The multi-drug combinations appear to be the most efficacious use of a protease inhibitor.</p>

<p>Another promising treatment strategy currently being explored in study is the combination of saquinavir and ritonavir. I expect future studies will explore combining 2 protease inhibitors; for example, Agouron's Viracept may have potential in combination with saquinavir, and Glaxo's VX-478. VX-478 may have efficacy in combination with saquinavir and other protease inhibitors. All of these multi-drug combinations will be much more expensive then therapies we've utilized to date. AZT/3TC/indinavir therapy would cost about $10-11,000/year. AZT/3TC/ritonavir might cost about $13,000 per year. By comparison, AZT/3TC therapy costs about $5500 per year.</p>

<p>As you can readily see, the cost of optimal treatment for HIV is expensive. Reimbursers are not very prepared to easily pick up these costs in addition to the other drug-related costs for PWAs (Bactrim, CMV treatment, etc.)</p>

<p><b>TREATMENT ACCESS CONFERENCE</b><br>
Monday March 18, at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, a room of about 50 individuals gathered to consider and discuss these issues, at the National HIV Treatment & Drug Access Conference. It was sponsored by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation of Los Angeles, AIDS Action Council and GMHC. There were representatives present from government, industry, and patient advocacy groups. Mike Isbell of GMHC stated that 30% of people with HIV are not insured, and 40% of HIV-infected individuals are covered under Medicaid. Concern was expressed about an ever-widening gap between those able to access the most progressive treatments and those who are unable to because of limitations of funding. Recent AIDS advocacy efforts have resulted in a proposal for an increase of $52 million, from the Clinton Administration to be inserted in the Omnibus Appropriation Bill currently before Congress; it still remains for this Bill to be passed into law.</p>

<p>Protease inhibitors are just becoming available. It takes a period of time before they may become more widely used for treatment. As the incidence of their use grows, obviously the overall costs will expand. It is estimated that an additional $200 million may be necessary for FY 1997 to fund the demand for protease inhibitors just for individuals who use ADAP. It is estimated that 20% of HIV-infected individuals utilize ADAP. Since 40% of people with HIV use Medicaid, this program's financial needs will be even more heightened. These figures do not include individuals who for the first time may seek treatment because of protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>The entire day was divided into subject-related panel discussions followed in each case by Q & A and discussion. Drs. Charles Farthing of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and Victoria Sharp of the Spellman Center at St. Clare's Hospital in NYC presented treatment information and data for the audience. Dr. Farthing presented graphic slides demonstrating CD4 and RNA benefits of saquinavir, ritonavir and indinavir; he discussed the clinical benefits of ritonavir use from Abbott's #247 trial. He also discussed the importance of RNA testing in understanding and measuring treatment effects. Dr. Sharpe said, based on current pricing of AZT/3TC/saquinavir, it would cost $1 million to treat 88 patients for 1 year.</p> 

<p><b>COMPLIANCE WITH PROTEASE INHIBITOR ADMINISTRATION GUIDELINES</b><br>
Concern was expressed at the meeting, that we don't yet know enough 
about how long the benefits from protease inhibitors will last, or how long they will extend survival. Compliance with all the instructions for taking protease inhibitors may be a problem for many individuals. For example, in early disease an individual may not want to stick to the strict guidelines of taking a protease inhibitor because they don't feel sick. If individuals aren't compliant, the benefits may quickly wane and then you may have some measure of cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>Many resources will have to be devoted to educating doctors and patients about how to be properly compliant. Additionally, many resources will have to be devoted to the costs of these drugs. Therefore, it was suggested that perhaps we should be circumspect about spending so much on protease inhibitors when we could devote more resources to PCP prophylaxis, which might be more cost-efficient in keeping people alive. Dr. Farthing insisted that many of his patients were willing and in fact want to take these drugs. I emphasized that access to these treatments must be guaranteed to all individuals; to do otherwise is unacceptable. The decision whether or not to use them ought to be between the patient and his doctor.</p> 

<p>We must commence to do our best and most comprehensive job of educating people. This responsibility belongs to the HHS, the NIH, the drug companies, knowledgable medical professionals, and our community advocacy organizations.</p>

<p>The point about the importance of compliance, and education about it, is very well taken. Patient compliance to the guidelines for taking each individual protease inhibitor is crucial to delaying resistance and to the ability to maximize benefit from this class of drugs. Effective education, for both doctors and patients is crucial and will not be easily accomplished. Community advocacy groups will be disseminating information about guidelines in the near future. NATAP is preparing guidelines now, that will soon be disseminated on our homepage and by other means.</p>

<p><b>ECONOMICS, PRICING & CLINICAL ENDPOINT STUDIES</b><br>
The panel entitled the "Cost of New Treatments," empaneled Peter Arno, a healthcare economist from Albert Einstein Hospital in NYC, Jim Driscoll, the Treatment Advocate for Log Cabin Republicans, and Moises Agosto, of the National Minority AIDS Council. Arno promoted the notion of setting up price controls or constraints by the government on AIDS drug company pricing. He said, if we start spending more on Ryan White and other AIDS funding, objections would be raised as to why other diseases don't get as much funding. He said, drug companies are crying wolf when we ask for controls and reasonable pricing by responding with the need to make adequate profits to fund AIDS-related R&D and other AIDS drug development spending.</p>

<p>Jim Driscoll said, $15,000 a year is not too much for a life-sustaining therapy when you compare the costs of treatment for cancer and other similarly life-threatening illnesses. Further, he cautioned about driving drug companies out of AIDS research if they can't make enough profits.</p>

<p>Bert Kiddner, of Glaxo Wellcome, said the company has an obligation to its stockholders to show profits. A treatment advocate present at the meeting took this opportunity to criticize Glaxo for not conducting, by his measure, adequate clinical endpoint studies on the combination of AZT/3TC, in individuals with over 250 CD4.</p>

<p>Charles Farthing responded that he believes viral load to be predictive of clinical endpoints and to continue conducting long-term clinical endpoint studies is not productive; by conducting such studies, we randomize individuals to control arms where they receive placebo, and we wait for them to get sick or die in order to prove that individuals in the other arm, who are receiving the treatment, are living longer and healthier. </p>

<p>In fact, we are in a transitional period. The validity of the correlation between viral load changes that result from treatment effect and prolonged survival is being currently studied by researchers and the FDA. It will be addressed at the FDA hearing on viral load. Many eminent researchers already believe that correlation is established; others want more evidence. Some studies that may prove this validity are ongoing, and others are planned. Farthing said, there is no need for this anymore, (see the <a href="../drug/rna.html">viral load</a> article). Already analyzed data from the John Mellors MACS study indicates that viral load levels immediately subsequent to infection with HIV, correlate with disease progression and survival. There are other studies indicating viral load predicts disease progression and survival.</p>

<p>There is some division in our community about the future of conducting clinical endpoint studies. Later in the day, when this subject came up again for discussion, I supported the Farthing position by explaining that, in fact, a new paradigm was being created. At both the <a href="../drug/advise.html">Abbott and Merck Advisory Committee hearings</a>, the Committee, the FDA and the drug companies agreed to conduct long-term open-label studies examining durability of benefits and safety for their respective drugs in populations with less than advanced disease.</p>

<p>Abbott has agreed to continue following trial subjects in the #245 study of AZT-naive individuals for the purpose of gathering information. Merck has announced the establishment of a transition program for 800-850 of their study participants; subjects in about 10 phase I, II and III studies will receive free drug for participating in a 3-5 year follow-up study. Abbott's study #247 did in fact study clinical endpoints for individuals under 100 CD4 - survival was prolonged and progression to AIDS delayed. But the study results only extended to 6 months. Therefore, the durability of benefits studies for the Merck and Abbott drugs were requested, both for individuals with low CD4s and higher CD4s. These studies will be open-label, therefore no individuals will be randomized to a placebo arm where they would be consigned to die or progress to prove the efficacy of the treatment.</p>

<p>At the <a href="../drug/fda.html">AZT/3TC FDA Committee hearing</a> in November, Dr. David Feigal, Director of the Antiviral Drug Product Division of the FDA, said that conducting clinical endpoint studies as we previously had were no longer feasible. Patients in the mid- to upper CD4 ranges won't allow themselves to be randomized to placebo arms when protease inhibitors are available; and it is of questionable ethics to ask them to submit themselves to such long-term studies. The Abbott #247 study demonstrated within 6 months survival and progression benefits in a population with under 100 CD4. Individuals in the control arm died and progressed to prove the point.</p>

<p><b>MEDICAID, ADAP and PRIVATE INSURANCE PROBLEMS</b><br>
The next panel discussed "Impact on ADAP/Medicaid/Private Insurers." The panelists were: Lanny Cross, the Director of NY State ADAP, Richard Jefferys, a reimbursement advocate with <a href="../../network/index.html">AIDS Treatment Data Network</a> of NYC, Mark Scherzer, a private insurance advocate, and Robert Staley of the Public Health Services' Office of Drug Pricing. Lanny Cross said, NYS is considering sacrificing other vital ADAP services (such as homecare), in order to fund protease inhibitors. Before the NYS legislature is a Bill, which he believes allows funding to be cut from Medicaid and moved over to ADAP.</p> 

<p>There is much concern about the variability between different states on their willingness to pay for protease inhibitors. Some states may have a cap on prescription funding which may limit access to all drugs an individual needs, possibly forcing individuals to choose which drugs may be more important to buy. Some states may require a co-payment of $5.00 per prescription; if an individual is taking 5 or 6 different drugs, that $30 a month may be unaffordable for someone on public assistance. Mark Scherzer said, private insurers will be looking closely at FDA indications for a particular drug. That is why it was important, as myself and a few other community advocates insisted at the recent FDA hearings, that indications for ritonavir and indinavir were not limited by CD4 count or some other limiting language, such as for advanced disease only. </p>

<p>There are many other limitations imposed by private and government insurers that will be challenged by the demand for protease inhibitors. For example, if your private insurer has a yearly prescription cap of $3,000, where will you get the additional funds for a 3-drug combination costing $12,000/yearly?</p>

<p>Robert Staley, of the PHS Office of Drug Pricing, talked about a federal program through which qualifying organizations can access HIV drugs at a price below market. The organization must be a qualified recipient of federal funds, such as Ryan White funding. Many people in the audience were very interested in this program. I am considering the possibility of starting a non-profit drug purchasing organization to buy and sell, without profit, protease inhibitors. If anyone is interested in collaborating, please call me at (718) 624-8541 or send <a href="mailto:julev@aol.com">e-mail</a>.</p>

<p>The final panel consisted of Michael Weinstein of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation; Tim Westmoreland, a former congressional aide; Bill Arnold, the co-chair of the ADAP Working Group; Stephanie Evans, Director of Client Advocacy at GMHC; and Christine Lubinski of AIDS Action Council. Stephanie Evans explained how she organized to approach NY insurers about paying for viral load testing. She managed to convince them to cover this expense. This type of advocacy needs to be expanded. Michael Weinstein presented a list of items for a proposed consensus statement for individuals and organizations to sign onto. Objections were raised about some elements in the statement and to the request to sign on with such short notice. Some of us proposed a continuing dialogue and the prospect of holding a follow-up meeting in the near future. It is usually difficult for our community to form a consensus on issues that are so far-ranging and complicated. But many groups have been working on these issues and will continue. It was a community group that convinced the Clinton Administration to recommend the additional $52 million in ADAP funding, now being considered before Congress.</p>

<p>The full scope of problems associated with reimbursement for AIDS drugs is more extensive and complicated, than I've been able to discuss here. But, I've tried to report a general overview of the hurdles we may be facing.</p>

<p>For myself, I have devoted the last 2 years to protease inhibitor advocacy--access, development, approval related issues, and to dissemination of treatment information. I decided to get involved in the reimbursement issues because I am now horrified that, after all this work, many of us may not have adequate access to optimal treatment for HIV and AIDS. </p>

<p>Our government officials must rise to the demands of this situation. You can help by contacting your local <a href="http://www.lawlinks.com/gov/spkout.html">congessional representatives</a> and our federal agencies to advocate for our needs. You can call the White House, or Donna Shalala, who is the head of Health and Human Services. Also, you can call Patsy Fleming, the Presidentially appointed AIDS-czar at the Office of National AIDS Policy, at 750 17th Street in Washington.</blockquote>

<h3>Position paper on accelerated approval for Crixivan and Norvir</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The surrogate marker data compiled by both Merck and Abbott is to date the best presented to the FDA for accelerated approval for any HIV therapy. Of course, there are some concerns about resistance, cross-resistance, how best to use these drugs, future studies, etc. These concerns will be addressed in this paper. For both drugs, the information from surrogate marker data, clinical endpoint studies, and safety profile clearly support accelerated approval.</p>

<p><b>Surrogate marker data overview</b><br>
The Merck and Abbott studies' results demonstrate virological and immunological benefits (viral load and CD4), from treatment with indinavir or ritonavir, superior to any other HIV treatments reviewed by the FDA, to date. The total number of individuals in whom indinavir has been studied at the current recommended dose, including the studies discussed below, is 2,400. Ritonavir has been studied in over 1,500 HIV infected individuals. In the 2nd part of this paper, a few select important Abbott and Merck studies, are reviewed in some detail.</p>

<p>The Merck and Abbott studies, indicate that resistance develops relatively quickly when using either protease inhibitor as monotherapy. But, the use of effective multi-drug combinations can delay resistance. Merck's AZT/ddI/Crixivan and AZT/3TC/Crixivan studies demonstrate impressive surrogate marker benefits, although the number of subjects upon which the 6-month data is based is small. As well, the AZT/ddC/ritonavir study conducted in France demonstrates impressive surrogate marker data, although the study is open-label and also small.</p>

<p>For both phase III Abbott studies, the ritonavir administered to study participants was the distasteful liquid formulation, which may have caused compliance problems. In an earlier phase I/II study conducted by Sven Danner, a capsule was used and viral load reductions were more profound.</p>

<p>You can read the NATAP 43-page report on protease inhibitors, for a comprehensive compilation and review of data available to date; it reviews 5 protease inhibitors: ritonavir, indinavir, Agouron's Viracept, Roche's saquinavir and Glaxo's VX-478. <i>(available by sending your <a href="mailto:julev@aol.com">request</a>)</i></p>

<p><b>Clinical endpoint data</b><br>
Abbott's clinical endpoint study demonstrates clear and marked benefits for those receiving ritonavir. The length of the study is only 6 months and I have concerns about the durability of the clinical benefits, but the reductions in death and the incidence of opportunistic infections were dramatic.</p>

<p>Merck is planning a clinical endpoint study, <a href="../../network/trials/hiv.html#320">ACTG 320</a>, which is recruiting, for individuals who are AZT-experienced but 3TC -naive, with less than 200 CD4. They have an ongoing clinical endpoint study in Brazil, for which data is not yet available.</p>

<p><b>Safety profiles</b><br>
For the Merck drug, hyperbilirubinemia occurs at a rate of 15% for those taking Crixivan; usually, the rise subsides within weeks of initiating treatment. The short-term effects of this development seem safe, but what are the long-term effects? Nephrolithiasis occurs at an incidence of 2-3%. The long-term effect of the potential for developing kidney stones is a concern. Rises in liver enzymes occur after initiating treatment, but mostly subside within several weeks. Some individuals developing side effects have had to discontinue treatment, but most are able to successfully re-challenge with Crixivan. Others were able to continue taking Crixivan despite the side effects, which resolved anyway. Studies are recommended to examine these side effects over the longer-term.</p>

<p>For the Abbott drug, levels of liver enzymes, cholesterol, and triglycerides increase significantly after initiating ritonavir treatment. In an early phase I/II study, there were increases from baseline of 30 to 40% for cholesterol and 200 to 300% for triglycerides, and elevations in cholesterol and triglycerides persisted through 32 weeks of the study. Longer-term studies are warranted to examine these side effects.</p> 

<p>Abbott is hoping that the potential for combining saquinavir with ritonavir will be realized. The successful combination of these 2 drugs will allow a reduction in the dose regimen for ritonavir. Rather than the full dose of 600 mg. twice daily, possibly 300 or 400 mg. twice daily will be all that's required. This could lower the incidence of their side effect profile to a manageable level.</p>

<p>Both drugs have drug interaction concerns with some of the same drugs. But, the magnitude of Abbott's drug interactions are greater and the number of drugs with which it interacts is greater. With a lowering of dosing that would result from combination with saquinavir, drug interaction concerns may diminish. It is incumbent upon the drug companies to adequately inform and educate physicians, other medical service providers and consumers about drug interactions. Of particular concern, is the potential for interaction with drugs that are not yet fully recognized to cause such interactions.</p>

<p><b>Production and expanded access</b><br>
Needless to say, we in the community were greatly disappointed by the production limitations of both Merck and Abbott, which prevented adequate and more timely expanded access programs for individuals with advanced disease. Our concerns about production and supply, with regards to protease inhibitors, are not yet over. In the fall of 1994, I approached the National AIDS Task Force about these production concerns, as well as other important issues. Although there were promises of assistance from Philip Lee's offices and the Task Force, no assistance was forthcoming. I also requested the establishment of a Protease Inhibitor Task Force to address all the issues we are now facing and they refused to be responsive, at that time.</p>

<p><b>Indications</b><br>
I support accelerated approval for both drugs for the treatment of HIV disease, when treatment is warranted. This indication should not be limited by a CD4 count or by any other characterization. Approval should be for any HIV infected individual regardless of the stage of his disease. Current thinking is that viral load monitoring may be superior to CD4 in characterizing an individual's state of disease. The decision making process of when to institute therapy with a protease inhibitor should be a matter between the patient and his doctor. Arbitrary and false guidelines based on CD4 counts are unwarranted and unacceptable. Further, the FDA Rules and Regulations governing accelerated approval (21 CFR Parts 314 and 601), only require "that applicant....conduct clinical studies...to verify and describe the drug's clinical benefit". There is no requirement that this study(s) must be extended to the entire range of CD4 counts. In other words, if the clinical endpoint study is limited to examining the CD4 population of under 200, there is no regulatory justification for withholding accelerated approval. </p>

<p>Many individuals with AIDS have by now used up much of their treatment options. The demand for protease inhibitors is pent-up and warranted. It would be cruel and inhuman to approve of any indication that might limit access, in any way, to these drugs. </p>

<p>I have collected written testimonials from individuals with HIV or AIDS, from all over the country and from Australia, petitioning the FDA to approve both drugs without any CD4 limitations; they support the request for an indication---approval for HIV disease with no limits on CD4 count; they support that treatment is a decision between doctor and patient. They do not want the FDA to set any limits by CD4. Our choice of indication affects individuals with AIDS all over the world. The regulatory agencies in other countries frequently rely upon the U.S. indication, when choosing their own. A limitation by CD4 count may not only cause another country to follow suit, but in Australia for example, it may cause CD4-based limits upon reimbursement. </p>

<p><b>Labeling and patient information inserts</b><br>
The labeling for both ritonavir and indinavir needs to adequately address the important issues of resistance, cross-resistance, side effects and drug interactions. 

<p><b>Resistance</b><br>
The adequate dissemination of proper information about resistance, delaying resistance with multi-drug combinations and cross-resistance, are paramount concerns, that need to be addressed. It is clear that monotherapy with a protease inhibitor is sub-optimal treatment compared to a multi-drug combination. It is our responsibility to insure that the concerned public is properly informed and educated about this issue. I support approval for monotherapy, for HIV disease, only on the condition that such an effort is undertaken. I suggest strict language in the label, saying that resistance generally sets in fairly quickly with monotherapy, that our best information so far is that multi-drug combination therapy is the most effective way to delay resistance, and that only under circumstances of failure to tolerate other drugs is monotherapy advisable. Also, other drugs used in addition to the protease inhibitor must have remaining effectiveness, as best as is detectable. Adding a protease inhibitor to a drug(s), to which an individual may be already resistant, is not optimal.</p>

<p><b>Cross-resistance</b><br>
A similar educational effort needs to be undertaken with regards to our knowledge about cross-resistance. Although our conclusions may be preliminary, the concerned public ought to be informed of the issues and concerns. I suggest the label needs to inform readers of the issues surrounding cross-resistance, for saquinavir, ritonavir and indinavir. It should be explained that the resistance study examining saquinavir pre-treated individuals after they're switched to Crixivan is about to start.</p>

<p><b>Future considerations</b><br>
Glaxo, Abbott, Roche, Merck and Agouron have all made the public aware of the potential for therapy with the combination of two protease inhibitors. By next month, 3 protease inhibitors will be approved and available. Soon afterwards, Agouron's Viracept and Glaxo's VX-478 will be accessible through clinical trials. On their own, individuals will be experimenting by combining these drugs. We need information about the safety concerns of combining these inhibitors on their own; and of course, we are very interested in the potential efficacy of combining 2 inhibitors. I believe these companies, the NIH and the FDA owe the consumer public an obligation to immediately conduct safety and efficacy studies exploring these combinations.</p>

<p>The NIH, the industry and the FDA must collaborate on additional post marketing studies examining early intervention, sero-conversion (pilot studies are ongoing), maternal transmission, pediatrics, neo-nates, resistance studies, further efficacy trials, sequential use of protease inhibitors--better understanding cross-resistance concerns, optimizing combination choices, and we must explore further combining immune-based therapies with antiviral regimens (e.g. IL-2/protease regimens). </p>

<p>Because of the new situation we find ourselves in, we must consider new approaches to studying treatment switching triggered by CD4 and/or viral load considerations. Some studies examining a few of these concerns are already in planning stages. But we need a comprehensive and collaborative approach to adequately address all of the issues.</p>

<p>With the recent findings available to us about protease inhibitors and viral load measuring, we are at a crucial juncture in the history of AIDS research and treatment. Let us not squander these important leads. The United States government and our pharmaceutical industry have a unique opportunity to seize international leadership in making vital inroads for optimizing the utilization of available treatments for HIV and possibly making HIV a chronic and manageable disease. Better collaboration between the manufacturers developing inhibitors, the NIH and the FDA is necessary. In October of 1994 , when I appeared before the National AIDS Task Force, where David Kessler, Philip Lee, Eric Goosby, Patsy Fleming and William Paul heard my request, I pleaded for an organized effort to begin to address all these concerns. At the time, I called it a Protease Working Group. I asked Patsy Fleming to take these concerns to the White House and she refused. Now, 1 1/2 years later, it seems as though our governmental leaders are discussing this type of an effort. My concerns are whether this effort will actually get started and implemented, how soon we will begin, how quickly we can implement ideas and how comprehensive the effort will be; or, is the Clinton Administration merely headline seeking with false promises, that may never be actualized. Let us not squander the opportunities we now have.</p>

<p>Without the speedy implementation of plans, we in the community will be in the same position, as always, of struggling with and negotiating directly with the drug companies on the above mentioned issues, and the same unanswered questions about previous treatment concerns may remain unanswered about protease inhibitors. 

<p>What about the concerns regarding adequate implementation of future expanded access programs for drugs not yet to that point in development? The Task Force and the above mentioned individuals promised to adequately address this issue, but they never have.</p>

<p><b>Re-imbursement</b><br>
These issues are also very worrisome. Our ADAP program is failing. Will private insurance cover the entire class of these new drugs, allowing people choices? Will Medicaid do the same? Will Roche, Merck and Abbott provide adequate Patient Assistance Programs (P.A.P.), that will be user friendly and that will last over time? Government assistance on this front is absent. Will people be permitted to die because they've had to discontinue Bactrim, other OI treatments, or couldn't access protease inhibitors? Are we going to sentence people to death because of an unwillingness to spend this money? We need fair pricing, from the drug companies, in addition to adequate P.A.P. I emphatically say, it is totally unacceptable for people with AIDS not to have adequate access to treatments for lack of proper funding. Finally we have some effective treatments, and people might be denied access and die as a result. The American people must not and will not stand for this. Where is the leadership from our government officials on this issue?</p>

<p><b>Pediatrics</b><br>
All drug manufacturers have been slower to develop pediatric formulas than for adult formulas. Usually, that's because the adult market is more lucrative. Pediatric formulas should be developed on a parallel track. In a letter sent recently, to Dr. David Kessler, Dr. Arthur Amman, of the Pediatric AIDS Foundation says, "the delay in approving AZT for use in pediatric populations delayed the eventual ground breaking research showing that the administration of the drug to pregnant women and their infants could prevent infection in these infants. We estimate that this delay resulted in 3,000 unnecessary infections in children......This is over and above the number of infected children who died prematurely because the drug was not available for their use.........protease inhibitor's like Abbott's are even more potent than AZT........the failure to develop indications for pregnant women and infants will perpetuate and enlarge these tragedies.........the specific failure of Abbott to conduct its own trials or even to provide ritonavir for pregnant women, newborns, and infants, after repeated requests from pediatric investigators, is particularly difficult to understand."</p>

<p>Dr. Amman, in this letter to Kessler, requests a meeting to discuss ways that will prevent this problem from recurring. We need adequate implementation of improved mechanisms for speedier development of treatments, for pediatric indications and for prevention of maternal transmission.</p>

<p><b>Report of data from important studies conducted by Merck and Abbott</b></p>

<p><b>Merck</b><br>
An early study, #019, examined AZT-naive individuals for 24 weeks; randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled; 20-25 subjects per arm were enrolled; 3 arms--indinavir v. AZT/indinavir v. AZT. At 24 weeks, the median RNA decline was 2.5 logs and the median CD4 increase was 100, in the AZT/indinavir group. For the indinavir monotherapy group, they experienced a 2 log RNA reduction at 8 weeks, which was 1.5 log at 24 weeks; probably resistance started to become a factor. A few individuals experienced a 4 log reduction. The lowest level of viral load detection for the test Merck used was 200 RNA copies; at 24 weeks, the viral load remained undetectable, for about 50% of the AZT/indinavir group, and 40% in the monotherapy group. CD4 increases, at 24 weeks, were 40 for the monotherapy group and 100-120 for the AZT/indinavir group. We now have data for some participants out to 48 weeks, where 40% remain undetectable in the AZT/indinavir group.</p>

<p>Merck's important study #035, examined the 3-drug combination of AZT/3TC/indinavir. 97 AZT-experienced subjects (but 3TC-naive) were enrolled in a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded study, for which their mean baseline CD4 was 142, and their mean RNA baseline was 39,800. This study is important because of the magnitude of successful response by individuals who had prior AZT-experience and because the 3-drug combination was able to delay the onset of resistance , and thereby sustain RNA and CD4 benefits. The viral load reductions were: 1.8 log at week 4 and maintained at 2.3 log at 24 weeks. The 24 week data is currently based on only 6 of 7 subjects; but soon, Merck says they'll have expectedly similar results for 14 individuals. As time passes we'll get data on more subjects. The proportion of individuals with undetectable virus is: 40% at week 4, and 86% at week 24. The mean increases in CD4 were 60 at week 4 and 146 at week 24. For the monotherapy group, the mean RNA reduction was 1.7 log at week 8 and 1.3 at week 24--resistance may be setting in. The proportion of individuals with undetectable virus is 44% at 24 weeks. The mean increase in CD4 is 98 at week 24.</p>

<p>The last Merck trial that I'll review here is study #020, which examines the 3-drug combination of AZT/ddI/indinavir. Although, demonstrating good immunological and virological benefits for the subjects, Merck said compliance problems arose because of the difficulty of taking ddI. This is a 24 week, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study of treatment-naive individuals. There were 3 study arms, each with 26 participants at time of enrollment: Crixivan 600 mg. 4X/day, AZT/ddI-- ddI 200 mg. 2x/day Crixivan/AZT/ddI. The baseline viral load was 100,000 RNA copies and 150 CD4. At week 24 for the 3-drug combination group, the median viral load reduction was 2.9 log and the CD4 increase was 80-90 cells. Merck reported that 60% of study subjects in both the Crixivan monotherapy arm and the 3-drug combination arm had at least a 50 CD4 increase, at 24 weeks. There were a number of treatment discontinuations due to ddI, and after 6 months when the study was unblinded, Merck reports that some study subjects discontinued ddI therapy. </p>

<p><b>Abbott</b><br>
For this review of Abbott's surrogate marker data, we'll discuss 4 studies. The first is study M93-113. This European monotherapy study examined treatment experienced individuals. Very important-- a capsule formulation of ritonavir was administered rather than the distasteful liquid formulation. There was a 4-week double blind, randomized and placebo controlled phase followed by a maintenance phase, where all subjects received ritonavir. During the first 4 weeks, subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 different dosing regimens. 84 subjects were enrolled. There were 15 subjects enrolled in each of these 2-dose arms--500 mg. 2X/day and 600 mg. 3X/day. The median baseline CD4 ranged from 130-170. and the mean RNA baseline ranged from 5.14 to 4.97, for the 2 dosing regimens. The mean maximal RNA reduction for the combined 500 and 600 mg. groups, when using a sensitive assay, was 1.94 log at week 8. By 32 weeks the mean RNA reduction for this group approximated 1 log. After 20 weeks of ritonavir treatment, the mean reduction in RNA for the group receiving 500 mg. 2X/day, became smaller, whereas the size of the reduction was sustained in the subgroup receiving 600 mg. 2X/day. There was a statistically significant difference in RNA levels between these 2 groups at week 32. But, the mean 1 log reduction at week 32, mentioned just above, represented both groups together. Therefore, it can't be sorted out, but seemingly the current recommended dose regimen of 600 mg. 2X/day, demonstrated a mean RNA reduction of greater than 1 log at week 32. At 32 weeks the 600 mg. group demonstrated a median CD4 increase from baseline of 230 cells, although only measured in 7 subjects. This study also indicated that subjects with below 100 CD4 could respond with significant CD4 increases.</p>

<p>Abbott's M94-208 was conducted in France; it is an open-label 3-drug combination study of treatment-naive subjects: AZT/ddC/ritonavir. 29 subjects were administered therapy; the baseline RNA and CD4 was 84,453 and 160, respectively. At 5 months, approximately, 40% of subjects had undetectable viral load. The mean RNA reductions were: 1.8 log at week 4, 2.9 log at week 20 and 2.1 log at week 24. The mean CD4 increases from baseline were: 124 at week 4, and 154 at week 24. 6 subjects discontinued during the study, 2 for hepatic toxicity.</p>

<p>M94-247 is Abbott's clinical endpoint study for individuals with below 100 CD4. The results of this study have been met with excitement as they demonstrate dramatic effects, as compared with currently approved drugs. 1,090 participants were enrolled, but for the CD4 sub-study the n=215 and for the viral load sub-study, the n=159. The study population was an advanced one: at least 9 months previous drug treatment, subjects were taking on average 11 concomitant drugs; subjects were using a wide variety of other antivirals. Subjects were permitted concurrent treatment with, but no more than 2 approved antivirals in addition to ritonavir (3TC was excluded because it was not yet approved). One concern I have is that, since study subjects were permitted to merely add ritonavir to their current therapy, possibly they may have not been on optimal treatment, because the other drugs have not have had remaining efficacy. Despite that possible limitation, this study showed impressive results. There was a 42% reduction in death for those receiving ritonavir, and a 58% reduction in AIDS or death. There also was a reduction in the incidence of clinical endpoints (opportunistic infections) for those taking ritonavir. The mean RNA reductions were: 1.3 log at week 2, 1.0 log at week 8, and .8 log at week 24. The mean increase in CD4 was: 25 at week 2, and 45 at week 16. My main concern is that the death and progression data is limited to 6 months.</p>

<p>M94-245 is the phase III study of AZT-naive individuals. Randomized, placebo controlled, double blind, 3 arm study of --ritonavir v. ritonavir/AZT v. AZT. 120 participants were enrolled per arm, CD4 above 200, RNA above 15,000. The distasteful liquid formula was used. Baseline measures: RNA- 4.84, CD4 350-380, CD8 930-990.</p>

<p>RNA reductions (figures are approx.) for ritonavir monotherapy: 1.2 log, 1.5 and 1.4 at weeks 2, 8, and 16. ritonavir/AZT combination: 1.1 log, 1.4 and 1.2 at weeks 2, 8 and 16. AZT monotherapy: .6 log and .5 at weeks 2 and 16.</p>

<p>CD4 increases: for ritonavir mono-: 70 and 80 CD4 at weeks 8 and 16. for ritonavir/AZT: 40 and 30 CD4 at weeks 8 and 16.</p>

<p>Discontinuations in study: ritonavir- 25%, AZT- 19%, ritonavir/AZT- 39%</p>

<p>The high rate of discontinuation in the AZT/ritonavir arm took place mostly in the first two weeks.</p>

<p>Side effects reported for that group: nausea 20%, vomiting 14%, diarrhea 9% </p>

<p>A concern is, why the AZT/ritonavir group did more poorly than the ritonavir montherapy group? Abbott says, there was less compliance in that group, because the population was AZT-naive, the combination of AZT and the liquid ritonavir may have been too distasteful. Abbott tested blood levels of ritonavir in both arms, and found the AZT/ritonavir group to have a lower blood level than the monotherapy group.</p>

<p><b>Final comments</b><br>
There is no denying that the surrogate marker data is impressive. Accelerated approval should be granted for HIV disease, with no mention or limitation to CD4 count. To limit the approval by a CD4 number could be cruel to people with HIV and AIDS who are desperately in need of treatment. Additionally, some of our leading researchers and physicians are recommending intervention with treatment, as early as possible, in the stages of disease progression. This applies especially for individuals with advanced disease. Individuals and their physicians need the freedom to make treatment decisions. To create an impediment that may limit access for these individuals would be grossly unfair and inhuman.</p>

<h3>Late Breaker--Nevirapine Interaction Data with Indinavir<br> Released November 20, 1996</h3>

<blockquote>

<p> <b>below is a mixture of information from the manufacturer and the author's commentary</b> </p>

<p>Today, Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) released their findings of an interaction study of nevirapine and indinavir to community advocates. Doctors and patients have been experimenting with this combination without the benefit of this data. The data is preliminary and does not predict the longer-term clinical outcome of combining these two drugs. It may be advisable to delay using the combination until more data is available, unless you have no other alternatives.

<p> In January at the Human Retrovirus Conference, more data is expected to be presented that may be more helpful in deciding whether to combine nevirapine with indinavir. Previously released from BI, interaction data indicated a reduction of blood levels for saquinavir when used with nevirapine: a questionable combination. Data from the interaction study of nevirapine and ritonavir will not be available until the end of January 1997.

<p>"Nevirapine is an inducer of hepatic cytochrome p450 metabolic enzymes predominantly of the 3A4 family. Thus, it has the potential to decrease the plasma levels of concomitantly administered drugs which utilize a similar metabolic pathway, such as protease inhibitors."

<p> Currently,the FDA indication of approval for nevirapine is for its use with approved NRTIs, not with protease inhibitors. Eventually, BI expects to be able to apply to the FDA to ammend that indication, but presumably with more data than is currently available. Currently, use of this combination is not FDA approved, but is commonly referred to as "off-label" usage.

<p> <b> Study Protocol</b> <br> 24 HIV+ patients were enrolled; 19 are evaluable as 5 withdrew. Participants were permitted to continue other approved antiretroviral drugs they may have been taking, such as AZT,etc. Some were treatment-naive and some were not. The median baseline viral load was low--4,000 copies/ml (range undetectable to 286,000)-- and the lower limit of detection of viral load was 400 copies/ml.

<p> <b> Regimen--</b> <br> Participants received indinavir (IDV) for 7 days at the currently recommended dose--800 mg every 8 hrs for. For the next 14 days, nevirapine (NVP) 200 mg once per day was added; For the next following 14 days, nevirapine at 200 mg twice per day was administered. This dose escalation method is standard for nevirapine.

<p> <b> Results--</b> <br> "In the 19 evaluable patients, coadministration of IDV with NVP resulted in a reduction in IDV plasma (blood) levels. The preliminary results indicate that co-administration of the two drugs resulted in a 28% mean reduction.....in IDV area-under-the-curve (AUC) values, an 11% reduction in IDV peak concentrations (Cmax) and a 38% reduction in IDV trough concentrations (Cmin)."

<p> <b> Commentary:</b> <br> the overall blood levels of IDV were reduced by 28%; usually, soon after a drug is taken, the blood levels rise to a peak blood level (Cmax); that IDV peak is reduced by 11%, in this case. Near the end of the 8 hour period after taking indinavir, the blood levels lower to a trough before taking the next dose; it is expected after taking a drug that blood levels rise to a peak and then lower to a trough before taking the next dose; this trough blood level for IDV is reduced by 38%.

<p> BI continues, "the range of AUC's at day 7 (which is the last day before adding NVP) was 5.44-34.57 ug hr/mL, and at day 36 (IDV+NVP) the range of AUC's was 6.62-26.30 ug hr/ml. Compared to historical controls, a nonsignificant reduction (less than 10%) in NVP AUC plasma (blood levels) concentrations was observed during combination with IDV".

<p> <b> Commentary:</b> <br> BI characterizes the NVP blood level reduction of up to 10% as non-significant. Who knows what a 10% reduction really translates into as clinical effect. There can be variability between people in absorption of any drug. One individual can experience a 10% reduction in blood levels, while a 2nd individual may experience no change in blood levels. The range of AUC mentioned above indicates variability in blood levels experienced by study participants. But, BI said the inter-patient variability is less for this combination than that seen with NVP+saquinavir.

<p> <b> Viral Load Data--</b> <br> After 96 days, 14/16 evaluable study participants were below the lower limit of detection (400 copies/ml) of the assay; the median baseline viral load was about 4,000. The viral load of 2/16 rebounded; BI would not to speculate as to why until further evaluation.

<p> BI is continuing "to collect plasma samples to evaluate viral load since patients were invited to continue on the combination therapy in open-label follow-up......to monitor virologic activity and drug plasma (blood) levels in order to obtain anecdotal data on the relationship between pharmacokinetics and antiviral response".

<p> <b> Commentary:</b> <br> A viral load reduction from 4,000 to 400 is only a 1 log reduction; but, there was a wide range of baseline viral load values from 260,132 to under 400. Four individuals' baseline viral load were between 18-27,000; for them, to reach undetactable of 400, the reductions would range from 1.6-1.8 log. Generally, indinavir monotherapy can result in about a 2 log reduction. The two drugs should not be cross-resistant due to their different enzyme targets (reverse transcriptase and protease). It is difficult and premature to accurately assess the full potency of the combination and its durability.

<p> <b> Safety--</b> <br> "In general, the combination of IDV+NVP has thus far been well-tolerated. Two patients discontinued due to rash attributed to NVP; the rashes were mild to moderate and resolved after discontinuation of study medication. The other 3 withdrawals were due to: kidney stone after 1 day on IDV (no prior history of kidney stone), protocol non-compliance and self-withdrawal.

<p> The main safety concern for nevirapine is the potential for developing a rash. A composite percentage of rash development from the three studies presented at the FDA approval hearing: of those study patients on a nevirapine/nucleoside combination therapy, 37% developed a rash; of those in one of the nucleoside therapy treatment arms (without nevirapine), 20% developed a rash; grade 1 rash--20% in NVP arms vs 13% non-NVP arms; grade 2--10% in NVP arms vs 5% in non-NVP arms; grade 3--5.6% in NVP arms vs 0.8% in non-NVP arms; grade 4--2% in NVP arms vs 0.4% in non-NVP arms; patients permanently discontinued in the presence of a rash--6.7% in NVP arms vs 1.2% in non-NVP arms.

<p>"There is a relationship between dosing and antiviral activity with both IDV and NVP. Increased resistance to IDV has been observed in studies where IDV was administered as monotherapy in doses less than 2.4 grams per day. It is not known how NVP in combination with IDV may contribute to the suppression of resistance to IDV. Likewise, the effect on the development of resistance to NVP when IDV is coadministered has not been established.

<p> <b> Dose modification--</b> <br> "In this study, blood levels of IDV when coadministered with NVP were lower than levels of IDV when given alone. To adjust for this observed pharmacokinetic interaction, a dose increase of IDV to 1000 mg every 8 hours (3 times per day) should be considered when taking NVP 200 mg twice per day. This may result in an IDV plasma pharmacokinetic profile that closely resembles the 800 mg dose of IDV without NVP".

<p>"Currently, there are not enough data to establish that the short or long term antiviral activity of IDV 1000 mg (every 8 hrs) with NVP 200 mg (2x/day) will differ from that of IDV 800 mg (every 8 hrs) with NVP 200 mg (2x/day). Thus the potential benefit of a dose increase of IDV must be evaluated with other issues (e.g. potential adverse effects, diminished compliance, and increased drug costs)."

<p> <b> Commentary:</b> <br> The development of resistance to IDV, NVP or any other therapy is a possibility regardless of how compliant you may be. But, one could argue that if you are able to lower your viral load to a low enough level with a regimen (including this combination of NVP+IDV), then you may have adequately suppressed replication to prevent resistance to emerge for the drugs in the regimen. But, it is premature to presume too much. We have not studied this combination, of IDV+NVP, long enough to assess its durability. BI should test the study participants with the Ultra-sensitive Roche assay with the lower limit of detection of 20 copies. Incidentally, it is advisable to consider taking a nucleoside(s) along with this combination, if you decide to take it.

 <p> Prior to phase III studies. Merck was considering 1000 mg or 800 mg (every 8 hrs for 1000 or 800) as the dosing regimen with which they would proceed. They chose the 800 mg dose because they did not perceive a difference in efficacy but there appeared to be a higher potential incidence for a kidney stone at the higher dose. If you take a 1000 mg dose of IDV which is in turn lowered by 28% in its blood levels, can you assume the chance of a kidney stone is also lowered? we are not sure.

<p> Again, data collection is ongoing; BI said, additional information will be presented at the Retrovirus Conference in January 1997; 96 days is normally too short a period of time upon which to base treatment decisions. But, individuals without viable alternatives initiated therapy with ritonavir/saquinavir with little information. After only 12-20 weeks, so far 3 dosing regimens appear relatively equal in efficacy, but one of them (600RTN+600SQV bid) had more incidence of liver enzyme elevations. If you have alternatives, it may be advisable to wait for more data. </blockquote>

<h3>Consensus Statement on 1592 Expanded Access and Accelerated Approval</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>Overview</strong>

<p>Access to Glaxo Wellcome's 1592U89 now in development, potentially represents the only viable option for delaying disease progression for many people living with HIV and AIDS who have exhausted the benefit from currently approved antiviral therapies. In early clinical studies, 1592 has demonstrated a more potent level of antiviral activity than other RT inhibitors, with minimal side effects. It's most important property, however, is that people have not previously been exposed to it and it therefore offers the hope of renewed antiviral activity. This renders the drug critically important to two patient populations: (1) those who have already lost sensitivity to the other drugs of this type, and (2) those who need to use at least one fresh or new nucleoside analogue RT inhibitor to make reasonable use of combination therapy with protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside RT inhibitors. Existing evidence clearly suggests that combining such drugs with previously used therapies diminishes their effectiveness and leads to more rapid development of resistance.

<p>The benefit of this drug may be limited due to the development of resistance, a problem common to all currently approved antiviral compounds. While it may take years of additional study to determine its optimal use, this should not delay prompt access to this therapy by people in immediate need. Delaying the availability of this drug until Phase III trials are fully accrued is unacceptable and represents a significant change from past practices. For example, the ddI, d4T, and AZT expanded access programs all took place while trials were still recruiting. We are very concerned that the recent activities of several pharmaceutical companies represents a broad effort to minimize the number of patients served by expanded access programs. Any such effort around 1592 would be a moral affront to the rights and needs of people with HIV/AIDS and their healthcare providers.

<p> We hereby propose the following 1592 expanded access program, to be phased in in stages, with immediate access to those in urgent need.

<p> <strong> First Phase - Compassionate Use/Salvage Therapy. </strong> Glaxo Wellcome and the Food and Drug Administration must cooperate and take a more compassionate stance to make this promising compound immediately available in a salvage program once a recommended dosing schedule has been established. This compassionate access/salvage program should make drug available as soon as possible for those people who have failed existing therapies and risk near-term danger of death or life-threatening infections.

<p> The development of this drug must take into consideration its unique potential to provide benefit to the acutely compromised segment of the HIV-infected population. Availability of salvage strategies is of the highest priority for people living with HIV. There is no logical or moral reason to withhold this drug from people with advanced illness, people whose lives hang in the balance. Currently, this compound qualifies, by any humane standard, for compassionate use.

<p> This first phase of Compassionate Use/Salvage Therapy should provide 1592 without delay to patients who meet any one of the following two requirements: <br> 1. CD4+ Cell Count under 50 OR Viral Load over 40,000 copies/ml AND Treatment Failure to approved RT Inhibitors AND at least one Protease Inhibitor;<br> 2. Diagnosis of AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC), unresponsive to existing therapies.

<p> We believe evidence of the above conditions can be accomplished with a minimal amount of paperwork. A physician's letter accompanied by one lab report should be sufficient to establish any of the above criteria.

<p> <strong> Second Phase - Expanded Access. </strong> This second phase of Expanded Access should provide 1592 during recruitment and conduct of Phase II/III clinical trials, but no later than ninety (90) days from the start-up of the First Phase, to patients who meet any of the following criteria:<br> 1. Patients who do not qualify for or are denied entry in a 1592 clinical trial and have a medical need for 1592, or <br> 2. Patients who do not live within a radius of 15 miles of an active clinical trial site, or<br> 3. Patients whose lives would be immediately jeopardized by randomization to an ineffective treatment regimen, or<br> 4. Patients with a CD4+ Cell count below entry requirements of clinical trials, or<br> 5. Viral Load greater than 20,000 copies/ml., despite use of currently approved therapies, or<br> 6. Treatment Failure or demonstrated genotypic or phenotypic resistance to approved RT inhibitors.

<p> <strong> Accelerated Approval. </strong> This compound should be licensed for accelerated approval as soon as possible. FDA approval of this compound should be based on existing regulations governing accelerated approval of new drugs for life-threatening illnesses:<br> 1. Clear evidence of benefit on surrogate markers have been demonstrated; <br> 2. Principal toxicities and drug interactions have been defined; <br> 3. Longer-term development plans have been initiated designed to determine the drug's usefulness in promoting clinical and survival improvements and durability of response, as part of a medical strategy for coping with HIV infection.

<p> We urge the sponsor to file applications for accelerated approval no later than the 3rd quarter of 1997.

<p> <strong> Resistance, Pharmacokinetics and Drug Interactions. </strong> As with all antivirals, the development of drug-resistant strains of virus, drug interactions and pharmocokinetic variances while using this compound may warrant additional considerations. To address this concern, sponsors should also be required, prior to accelerated approval, to present meaningful data on: <br> 1. the speed and levels of resistance encountered; <br> 2. the degree of cross-resistance found with other nucleoside analogues; <br> 3. the interaction of the compound with other commonly used anti-HIV medications; <br> 4. bioavailability in men, women, and children and determination of the degree which blood levels vary depending on body weight.

<p> <strong> Summation </strong> Any effort to withhold access to promising compounds is contrary to the interests of HIV-infected people, inconsistent with the Accelerated Approval regulations, and scientifically unwarranted. The long history of the development of the earlier generation of antiviral drugs clearly demonstrates that it is possible to accrue patients and continue conducting clinical trials of compounds, long after their marketing approval. Because of the issues of drug resistance and drug failure over time, new therapies for HIV disease will continue to play a critical role no matter how many drugs become available on the market. New therapies, like 1592, must continue to be made available as rapidly as possible to patients with immediate needs for changed or improved treatment.

<p> AGREED and ACCEPTED this ____ day of _____________, 1996:

<p> <strong> Commentary from Jules Levin: </strong> There are many individuals who are not now benefitting from protease inhibitor therapy. They may have rebounded due to resistance or for some other reason are not responding well. These individuals need access to therapy that will help them. At this point in time, we know that if you are failing a regimen or have been on a regimen for a prolonged period of time, merely adding one new drug (no matter how potent it is) may not serve you well in the long run. Therefore, if you are able to access 1592, it would serve you well to consider adding a second new drug to therapy. You can consider adding a NNRTI like nevirapine or delavirdine; or, possibly nelfinavir if you access it through Agouron's expanded access.

<p> If you can wait until 1592 is available and there is more data, you might be better served to do that. One concern is that we don't yet know how effective 1592 will be for individuals who are resistant to RTIs like AZT, 3TC, d4T and ddI. A Glaxo study is now recruiting to explore that question. It is for protease-naive but RTI-experienced individuals. Data from that study should address the question of resistance.

<p> Glaxo should make this drug available to individuals truely in need. Those who are failing protease inhibitors and who are doing poorly, and want access should have the opportunity. But, remember if not used properly and resistance develops, you will lose the possibility of benefiting from it later in a potentially more effective combination.

<p> Ideally, Glaxo should provide an access program for these individuals that would provide 1592 in combination with their new protease inhibitor now in development (VX-478, 141W94). That would offer a better opportunity for individuals to properly benefit. This would offer two new drugs.

<h3>DELAVIRDINE FDA HEARING</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>TIE VOTE OF 4-4 PREVENTS APPROVAL RECOMMENDATION</strong>

<p>November 22<br> Gaithersburg, Md.</p>

<p>This is an initial brief report of yesterday's FDA Antiviral Drug Advisory Committee meeting entertaining the discussion of whether or not to recommend accelerated approval for this NNRTI. I will follow up this report with another detailing the data. Nevirapine was the first NNRTI to gain FDA approval this past summer. DMP-266 is also a NNRTI in earlier stage of development.

<p> There are 9 voting committee members. The chairman Scott Hammer MD, was unable to vote due to a technicality; but, the other 8 voters split evenly at 4-4. Therefore, the committee issued no recommendation. David Feigal MD, of the FDA, it appeared to me, tried to coax a recommendation out of the committee but they ended with the tie.

<p> The FDA is not required to adhere to committee recommendations. The committee of 9 agreed that they would wait for RNA data (viral load) from ACTG 261 and if the data is convincing, they would recommend approval. The data is not expected to be available until mid-January. Unconfirmed sources revealed that the FDA will have to make a decision by early December because of user fee regulations. That is, the FDA is required to decide on a drug's approval application within 6 months after drug user's fees have been submitted to the FDA. That 6-month deadline expires in early December for Upjohn, the manufacturer of delavirdine.

<p> Overall, the data was not impressive. Nor, was the presentation well coordinated by Upjohn. Three studies' results were presented but with mixed results. ACTG 261 supplied CD4 results but the viral load data will not be available until mid-January. Although there were CD4 benefits, the data was not convincing enough. As well, the overall results of two other studies protocols #0017 and #0021 were not convincing enough for the committee.

<p> Scott Hammer MD, the new committee chairman, agreed the data could be better, but he expressed support for the approval of this drug. He and Gary Blick MD, a committee guest serving for the first time, but without voting priveleges, supported the effort for approval. These two progressive voices were opposed by conservative opposition.

<p> Admittedly, the data wasn't that good, but I felt that the drug should've received approval; the design of the studies may have masked the efficacy of the data. It appeared to me and others that the data was adequate for approval. I testified to the committee in support of its approval.

<p> The data appears adequate enough that delavirdine is an antiviral that has some efficacy for which a certain group of people can benefit. Currently, there are many individuals who have exhausted all available NRTIs and need additional options. Delavirdine can offer an option to these individuals now. As well, preliminary results Upjohn's protease interaction studies (detailed on NATAP web site) indicate delavirdine can increase saquinavir blood levels 5-fold; it can be combined with indinavir: it increases indinavir blood levels; the study indicated it may not affect ritonavir blood levels. The drug has an important role for a certain group of individuals. At least for them, it should be available.

<p> A few other community advocacy organizations also spoke addressed the committee, all except one group supported approval. That one group remained neutral on the position.

<h3>Merck Announces Extension of Temporary Tracking Distribution System -- November 1, 1996</h3>

<p align=center>prepared and written by Jules Levin, National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project (NATAP)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When Crixivan was approved in March of 1996, Merck announced they were unable to manufacture adequate supplies to make it available through normal channels of distribution. As you know, in order to keep track of the demand (number of prescriptions) and supply of Crixivan, the special temporary system was arranged where Stadtlander's Pharmacy was the only source for most of the public.</p>

<p>Originally, Merck had said that by December 1996, normal channels of distribution would be in place. Unfortunately, Merck is now saying they are unable to do this. Merck has been meeting with community representatives this week to explain the new plan. This memo is a report to you of what Merck has told the community this week. They announced on Friday November 1st, that the current system will remain in effect until February or March of 1997, although they were unable to predict exactly when the new program will begin. </p>

<p>Once this new system is put into place, you will be able to buy Crixivan in many pharmacies who will participate in a more loosely designed tracking system. Crixivan will continue to be available from Stadtlanders. Merck says that, generally, once this new system is implemented the price for Crixivan should remain about the same as it is now whether you buy it from your local pharmacy or from Stadtlanders. </p>

<p>Merck said that increasingly large supplies are being manufactured every month, and by December 1996 they expect to be producing enough supply for 150,000 individuals to receive Crixivan monthly worldwide. They said that approximately 60,000 individuals within the USA and 25,000 outside the USA in 40 countries are currently receiving Crixivan. </p>

<p>Estimates from a few different sources are that about 10 to 20,000 individuals may be using ritonavir and about 25,000-35,000 using saquinavir in the USA. Merck estimated that about 100,000 individuals may be using a protease inhibitor. Although, I have heard lower estimates from other sources of how many individuals in the US are using a protease inhibitor. Some are using the combination of two inhibitors--ritonavir+saqinavir. </p>

<p>In this Expanded Tracking System, participants will include local pharmacies throughout the USA. Pharmacies will join an online system, as part of their current online system, where Merck will be able to continue tracking prescription demand for Crixivan, although more loosely than the current system. For those pharmacies without an online computer system, Merck says they will arrange to receive orders by phone or fax from such pharmacies. The responsibility for re-imbursement will be with the pharmacy. A third party will contract with Merck to create and monitor this new tracking system.</p>

<p>Merck will be attempting to include alternative providers in this system. For example, certain AIDS clinics around the USA who dispense AIDS medications need to be included in this system. Merck requested assistance from the community in being able to adequately notify alternative providers of the opportunity to participate. If you have suggestions, you can e-mail me at <A HREF="MAILTO:JuLev@aol.com">JuLev@aol.com</A>; or fax me at (718) 624-8399.</p>

<p>It seems as though a well-designed distribution system for state and federal prisons is lacking. Ideas are welcome from state and federal prison officials as well as community-based organizations. </p>

<p>When ready, a notification will be sent from Stadtlanders to every person receiving Crixivan</p>

<p>The distribution system for Crixivan outside the USA will remain the same. There are a variety of different tracking systems in place outside the USA for the same purpose of keeping track of supply and prescriptions.</p>

<title>NATAP: Upjohn letter re delavirdine-protease inhibitor interactions</title>

<a href="../index.html"><h4 align=center>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3>Preliminary results of ongoing delavirdine-protease inhibitor interaction studies---exact text of description from Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>PHARMACIA & UPJOHN, INC. September 5, 1996</p>

<p>Subject: Delavirdine - <b>Protease Inhibitor Drug Interactions</b></p>

<p>Due to the interest in use of protease inhibitors in combination with other antiretroviral agents, we are giving you notification of preliminary results of ongoing delavirdine - protease inhibitor studies in order to assist you and your patients in making treatment decisions and minimizing side effects. The following information is based on studies of small numbers of normal healthy volunteers and should be regarded as preliminary. In particular, the side effect profiles are incomplete and patients and physicians should be vigilant regarding new, unusual, more frequent or more severe adverse events.</p>

<p><b>Saquinavir</b>: In a study in which 13 healthy volunteers received saquinavir 600 mg tid with and without delavirdine 400 mg tid, coadministration of the two drugs resulted in an increase in mean steady-state trough plasma saquinavir concentrations from 15 +/- 6 ng/mL to 84 + 57 ng/mL. When seven healthy volunteers received delavirdine 400 mg tid with and without saquinavir 600 mg tid, coadministration of the two drugs resulted in a slight reduction in the mean steady-state trough plasma delavirdine concentrations from 17 +/- 5 EM to 13 + 3 EM. There was a 13% incidence of reversible elevation of hepatocellular enzymes in the first several weeks of the delavirdine and saquinavir combination (6% Grade Ill or IV). Physicians should consider following hepatic enzymes (ALT) more frequently than usual In the first weeks of administration of that combination.</p>

<p><b>Ritonavir</b>: In a study in which 14 healthy volunteers received ritonavir 300 mg bid with and without delavirdine 400 mg bid, coadministration of the two drugs had no effect on steady-state plasma ritonavir concentrations. When nine healthy volunteers received delavirdine 400 mg bid with and without ritonavir 300 mg bid, coadministration of the two drugs resulted In a slight reduction in mean steady-state trough plasma delavirdine concentrations. The pharmacokinetic interaction of delavirdine 400 mg tid and ritonavir 600 mg bid (consult manufacturer's complete prescribing information) has not been studied. Although a pharmacokinetic interaction between delavirdine and ritonavir at their recommended doses Is theoretically possible, no evidence of an interaction was observed at doses of delavirdine 400 mg bid and ritonavir 300 mg bid. Therefore, caution is advised when these agents are used in combination therapy at recommended doses.</p>

<p><b>Indinavir</b>: The pharmacokinetic interaction between delavirdine and indinavir was studied with 14 healthy volunteers. Administration of delavirdine 400 mg tid with a 400 mg single-dose of indinavir resulted in a mean value of the indinavir AUC which was slightly less than the value from an 800 mg single-dose of indinavir alone. The mean indinavir AUC from a 600 mg single dose of indinavir in combination with delavirdine 400 mg tid was approximately 50% greater than that observed for indinavir 800 mg alone. indinavir had no effect on plasma delavirdine concentrations. When given in combination with delavirdine, a dose reduction of indinavir to 400 mg or 600 mg tid should be considered (consult manufacturer's complete prescribing information).</p>

<p>As new information Is generated, we will communicate as necessary.</p>

<h3>NEVIRAPINE Update--safety and efficacy data, discussion of dangers of interaction with protease inhibitors, considerations of how to use the drug -- 9/14/96</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>Prior to Vancouver in July '96, nevirapine received accelerated approval for marketing from the FDA. A comprehensive <a href="nevir.html">report of the data</a> and other information presented at the FDA hearing is available on the NATAP web-site. I suggest you read that article for a fuller perspective of nevirapine, and its safety and efficacy data and how to use it.</p>

<p>In Vancouver, an update to the data was presented. Prior to Vancouver only 28 weeks of viral load data was available for the important BI study #1046. This article reports 52 weeks of viral load data, which was presented in Vancouver. The 1046 study examines treatment of drug-naive individuals with the triple therapy of AZT/ddI and nevirapine vs. nevirapine/AZT vs. AZT/ddI.</p>

<p>First, a warning---nevirapine is processed through the same drug processing system in your liver (cytochrome p450) as are protease inhibitors--saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir and nelfinavir. As a result, drug interactions can occur if you take nevirapine with any of these protease inhibitors or any other drug(s) that are also processed through the same system. Combining nevirapine (or delavirdine--both drugs are in the same class, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors--NNRTI) can cause alterations in the drug levels of the protease inhibitor and/or nevirapine. It is strongly recommended that is preferable to wait for the results of the drug interaction studies that are now being conducted by the manufacturer before combining nevirapine with a protease inhibitor.</p>

<p><b>Nevirapine + AZT/ddI</b></p>

<p>baseline characteristics<br>
mean CD4--387<br>
mean HIV RNA-- 17,498<br>
51 subjects were randomized to this treatment arm treatment-naive 98% were asymptomatic</p>

<p>previously available data (estimated)</p>
<ol>
<li>mean HIV RNA reduction from baseline at 28 weeks-- 1.65 log (n=27)
<li>mean CD4 increase from baseline at 28 weeks-- 120 cells (n=36)
<li>percent of subjects below limit of detection (undetectable--200 copies/ml)--73% 
</ol>

<p>(RNA reductions may have been more but for the facts that the Roche Amplicor viral load test has as its lowest limit of measure 200 copies/ml and the baseline mean RNA value was low)</p>

<p>New data (estimated)</p>
<ol>
<li>mean HIV RNA reduction from baseline at 52 weeks-- 1.40 log (n=34)
<li>mean CD4 increase from baseline at 52 weeks-- 140 cells (n=34)
<li>percent of subjects below limit of detection (200 copies/ml)-- 60%
</ol>

<p><b>Commentary</b>--As you can see, the percent of study subjects below the level of detection is reduced from 73% at 28 weeks to 60% at 52 weeks. As well, the HIV RNA reduction at 52 weeks is not quite as low as it was at 28 weeks.</p>

<p>Compliance with taking the assigned treatment regimen appears to have affected the data results. 24 individuals taking the nevirapine/AZT/ddI were defined as compliant and their mean RNA reduction from baseline was about 1.65 log at the week 40-52 average. 16 individuals were defined as not compliant and their mean RNA reduction was about 0.80 log. </p>

<p>There appears to be a correlation in this treatment arm between an individual's baseline HIV RNA value and whether or not their viral load is undetectable (below 200 copies/ml) after 40-52 weeks of therapy. About 82% with less than 10,000 RNA copies/ml at baseline, who received triple therapy, remained undetectable after 40-52 weeks of therapy; about 50% remained undetectable if their baseline RNA was between 10,000 to 28,184; about 20% remained undetectable if their baseline RNA was between 28,184 to 63,095; and, for those with greater than 63,095 about 20% remained undetectable. --(<i>end of commentary</i>)</p>

<p><b>AZT + ddI</b></p>

<p>baseline characteristics<br>
mean CD4-- 392 cells <br>

51 subjects randomized to this treatment arm treatment-naive 96% asymptomatic</p>

<p>previously available data (estimated)</p>
<ol>
<li>mean RNA reduction from baseline at 28 weeks-- 1.30 log (n=27)
<li>mean CD4 increase from baseline at 28 weeks-- 70 cells (n=38)

<li>mean CD4 increase from baseline at 52 weeks-- 30 cells
<li>percent below the limit of detection (200 copies/ml)-- 30%
</ol>

<p>Compliance appears to affect these data results: the 27 individuals defined as compliant with the assigned regimen of AZT/ddI had a mean reduction in viral load from baseline of about 1.20 log. The 8 individuals defined as not compliant had a mean reduction in viral load from baseline of about 0.30 log.</p>

<p><b>AZT + Nevirapine</b></p>

<p>baseline characteristics<br>

mean HIV RNA-- 35,156 copies/ml <br>
47 subjects randomized to this treatment arm treatment-naive 96% asymptomatic</p>

<p>previously available data (estimated)</p>
<ol>
<li>mean RNA reduction from baseline at 28 weeks-- 0.40 log (n=21)
<li>mean CD4 increase from baseline at 28 weeks-- 10 cells (n=30)

</ol>

<p>New data (estimated)</p>

<li>mean RNA reduction from baseline at 52 weeks-- 0.25 log (n=23)
<li>mean CD4 increase from baseline at 52 weeks-- 0 cells (n=24)
<li>percent below the limit of detection (200 copies/ml)-- 0%
</ol>

<p>Compliance also affected this group in the same way: the 22 individuals defined as compliant with taking nevirapine/AZT had a mean RNA reduction from baseline of about 0.30, while the 6 defined as not compliant had a mean increase in viral load. </p>

<p><b>Safety</b>-- The main safety concern with taking nevirapine is the development of a rash. Following is saftey data for the first 6 months of the 1046 study. (NVP=nevirapine)</p>

<p><b>Commentary</b>--Nevirapine has been in clinical research studies for a prolonged period of time. It was difficult to figure out an effective way in which to use the drug. In the previous NATAP web-site article reviewing nevirapine, data from study #'s 241 and 1037 are reported; those two studies explored nevirapine therapy in combination with 1 or 2 two other nucleosides in individuals with previous drug experience of either AZT alone or multiple nucleoside experience. The benefits to the study participants were limited, and much inferior to the benefits acheived by those treatment-naive individuals in study #1046 who received triple therapy of nevirapine/AZT/ddI. As well, even the treatment-naive individuals in 1046 who received treatment with AZT/nevirapine received limited benefit. Apparently, the development of resistance prevents sustaining of benefits. At the FDA hearing in June for nevirapine, it was well recognized by the Advisory Committee panel that the optimal success of nevirapine therapy would be in a potent regimen of drugs. Nevirapine along with 1 additional nucleoside is very limited in its amount of suppression upon viral replication, for both treatment-experienced and -naive individuals.</p>

<p>The question remaining is how can we best utilize nevirapine and other NNRTIs in development (e.g. delavirdine and DMP-266) in the context of protease inhibitor therapy?</p>

<p>For treatment-naive individuals, one option is to consider, for initial therapy, a three-drug regimen of 2 nucleosides with nevirapine (for example, nevirapine with AZT/ddI, AZT/3TC or d4T/ddI); and when efficacy may diminish, the individual could transition into a protease inhibitor regimen. </p>

<p>Two important elements in these considerations are the possibility of combining nevirapine (or another NNRTI) with a protease inhibitor and the development of cross-resistance between NNRTIs. The manufacturer of nevirapine, Boerhinger Ingleheim, and the manufacturer of delavirdine, Pharmacia & Upjohn, have only recently begun to conduct drug interaction studies between their drugs and protease inhibitors. Both companies and the FDA have been wrong in not having conducted these studies considerably sooner.</p>

<p>An option for both treatment-naive and experienced individuals is the combination of both a protease inhibitor and an NNRTI in the same regimen. Upon initiation of taking nevirapine, it is a potent drug that can attain a 1.75 log reduction in HIV RNA within the first few weeks of therapy. The problem with nevirapine is that, when used as monotherapy or in a sub-optimal regimen -- that is, one that does not acheive potent viral suppression -- resistance with nevirapine sets in very quickly and the viral load reduction can rebound quickly and significantly. In study #1046, those treatment-naive individuals randomized to triple therapy acheived significant viral load reductions and CD4 increases which were sustained, but individuals in the AZT/nevirapine treatment arm mostly did not sustain benefits; those receiving AZT/nevirapine experienced a mean initial peak viral load reduction of about 1.75 log and a mean initial peak CD4 increase of about 80 cells within the first few weeks, but the benefits relatively abruptly declined; by 16 weeks of treatment, the mean CD4 increase declined to about 25 cells and the mean viral load reduction was only 0.60 log from baseline; at 28 weeks, the mean CD4 increase from baseline was about 10 and the mean viral load reduction was about 0.40 log. </p>

<p>The implication is that the rendering of viral load, by the triple drug combination of nevirapine/AZT/ddI in treatment-naive individuals, to such low levels as acheived in this study, sufficiently halts HIV replication and thereby mutation (that is, resistance). That seems to be the reason that benefits are sustained. So, the addition of nevirapine to a protease inhibitor regimen might accomplish the same result. For those individuals who have exhausted other drugs and who have already initiated protease inhibitor therapy, adding a NNRTI may be an important part of the puzzle in sustaining viral load suppression or lowering it to undetectable levels. </p>

<p>At the FDA accelerated approval hearing for nevirapine, the manufacturer said that there is cross-resistance with delavirdine. There may be cross-resistance between all of the NNRTIs. This is an important element in considering which treatment options to use now or save. For example, the creation of resistance from the use of nevirapine could cause cross-resistance with DMP-266. </p>

<p>Very soon, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn will be making available preliminary results of their interaction studies of delavirdine with each of the 3 approved protease inhibitors. The information is not complete and needs to be interpreted for purposes of actual application. These initial interaction studies were done by Upjohn without the participation of Merck, Abbott or Roche. Merck will conduct their own interaction study to confirm the Upjohn data, and presumably Abbott and Roche will do the same. It is advisable to wait for the results of further research before adding a NNRTI to protease inhibitor therapy.</p>

<p>Taking inappropriate dosing combinations of delavirdine with a protease inhibitor can cause under- or overdosing. Use of a NNRTI with a protease inhibitor will alter the blood concentrations of each of the two drugs, because these drugs are all processed through the same CYT P450 system in the liver. Underdosing, which can occur from sub-optimal blood concentrations, can cause the development of resistance to the protease inhibitor or the NNRTI. Overdosing, which can occur from higher than desired blood concentrations, may cause toxicities. A potential toxicity from too high a blood concentration of nevirapine can be severe rash. Increasing the blood concentration of ritonavir or indinavir beyond recommended levels can cause difficult to manage side effects or toxicities.</p>

<title>Delavirdine Interaction Studies--Caution!!!</title>

<h3>Delavirdine Interaction Studies--Caution!!!  9/14/96</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>An announcement has been released by Upjohn &amp; Pharmacia's discussing recent results from the interaction study they have been conducting of their new non-nucleoside RT inhibitor called delavirdine with 3 approved protease inhibitors--saquinavir, ritonavir and indinavir.</p>

<p>These results are preliminary data and not complete. The research was conducted by Upjohn and the 3 protease inhibitor manufacturers did not participate in the studies. Merck will be conducting its own interaction studies to confirm the Upjohn data, and I presume so will Abbott and Roche. Without this confirmation, you may be taking a risk by making treatment decisions based on the preliminary Upjohn data. </p>

<p>Combining a <a href="../../network/simple/nnrtis.html">NNRTI</a> with a protease inhibitor may alter the blood concentrations of either or both drugs. The amount of alteration is unknown without adequate research to properly explore the question. If you alter the blood concentration of the NNRTI (delavirdine or <a href="../../network/simple/nevi.html">nevirapine</a>) or the protease inhibitor, you may acheive undesired blood concentrations. In effect, you could be over- or underdosing either or both of the drugs (the NNRTI and the protease inhibitor). Underdosing can be equivalent to taking to low a dose of for example indinavir, saquinavir, the NNRTI or ritonavir. As you know, that can cause resistance and subsequent cross-resistance. Overdosing could be the equivalent of taking more than prescribed of ritonavir, the NNRTI or indinavir. Dangerous side effects or toxicities could result from overdosing.</p>

<p>Another concern to be aware of is the potential for NNRTI cross-resistance. If resistance develops from underdosing of one NNRTI, you could develop cross-resistance to other NNRTIs. At the nevirapine FDA Advisory Committee hearing, Dr. Maureen Myers said nevirapine can be cross-resistant with delavirdine.</p>

<p>So, I would advise to be circumspect and patient. Stay tuned for further developments.</p>

<title>NATAP: PMPA Update</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<a href="../index.html"><h4 align=center>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3>PMPA Update (8/14/96)</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>As you may know, an experimental drug called PMPA has received a good deal of media attention based upon postive findings from studies of S.I.V. (simian immunodeficiency virus) in monkeys. PMPA is one of a class of antiviral drugs, known as nucleotide analogues. Like AZT and other nucleoside analogues, they inhibit reverse transcriptase. Gilead Sciences, the developer of PMPA, says that unlike nucleoside analogues, PMPA is already activated; it can enter uninfected cells and form a reservoir of drug that pre-arms them against the virus; in contrast, AZT and drugs in its class work only in cells that have the machinery to activate the drug. </p>

<p>The data and information so far made available has been based upon animal and in vitro data, so it is preliminary. Drugs have looked good before in early testing, only to be disappointing in later clinical trials in humans. It is possible that PMPA has unexpected toxicities not yet revealed. But, it is important to be properly informed about potential therapies.</p>

<p>Gilead is planning for phase I human trials to begin. Below is an update of the phase I plans being made for PMPA; which is followed by a brief review of some of the preliminary data previously made available for PMPA's use both as an antiviral for HIV and for its application in potentially preventing sexual transmission of HIV. </p>

<p><b>PHASE I HUMAN TRIAL OF IV AND ORAL DRUGS</b><br>
By the end of 1996 Gilead Sciences plans to begin a phase I test of concept study of their IV formulation of PMPA. HIV+ study subjects will receive a single dose followed by 1 week's observation; and then they will receive once daily dosing for 7 days; safety, antiretoviral effect and pharmacokinetics data will be collected.</p>

<p>Gilead reports they have found that PMPA has a long intracellular 1/2 life of 35 hours in monkeys and 30 hours in human cells in vitro. It is hoped that this long half-life will allow for relatively less frequent dosing than with the administration of currently used antiretrovirals. </p>

<p>A lead candidate for an oral pro-drug of PMPA has been selected and will be studied during the next several months. PMPA taken orally will not be adequately absorbed, but it is expected that the pro-drug will have better absorption; this lead candidate has displayed 40% bioavailability in dogs. A pro-drug is one that will turn into PMPA after it enters the human body. Soon, toxicology in rats and dogs will be studied. If all goes according to plan with the phase I IV formulation, it is expected that it will be followed closely with additional human studies of the IV formulation and/or a phase I study of the oral pro-drug of PMPA.</p>

<p><b>STUDY OF NEWLY INFECTED MONKEYS</b><br>
Data was published in Science November 1995, from a study of PMPA given (in two different doses) subcutaneously to 25 macaque monkeys either before or after exposing the monkeys to to S.I.V. <i>(<b>Ed. note</b>: you can search for the article from <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/science/home/search.html">this page</a>.)</i> The monkeys received once daily injections of PMPA for 4 weeks , beginning either 48 hours before, four hours after or 24 hours after inoculating the monkey with SIV. The monkeys were followed regularly for 56 weeks, but no evidence was found of SIV, SIV DNA, or SIV-specific antibodies in the plasma or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). From three weeks post-exposure onward, all 10 placebo-treated monkeys became infected with SIV. Each monkey also had a groin lymph node biposied 16 to 26 weeks after SIV exposure. None of the treated monkeys, but all that received placebo, showed evidence of SIV infection in the bipsied tissues. Gilead reported there were no adverse side effects caused by PMPA.</p>

<p>The results of this study imply application of PMPA to post-exposure HIV prevention (such as from an accidental needle stick), and may have implications for use in pediatric AIDS because it is thought that most neonatal HIV transmission occurs during the birthing process.</p>

<p>Again, it is important to remember that these results may not be applicable when PMPA is administered to humans. The Phase I trials in humans expected to start by the end of 1996 will begin to offer more reliable safety and efficacy data.</p>

<P><b>CHRONIC INFECTION AND PREVENTING SEXUAL TRANSMISSION</b><br>
At the Ninth International Conference on Antiviral Research in Fukushima, Japan during May of 1996, Gilead presented data on two additional applications of PMPA in monkeys previously infected with SIV.</p>

<p>In one study, ten monkeys that had been infected with SIV for at least 19 weeks were treated with once-daily injections of PMPA for four weeks. After 2 or fewer weeks of treatment, PMPA (30 or 75 mg/kg/day) reduced SIV levels by more than 99% or approximately 2 to 3 logs; some levels decreased below the limit of detection. In the two control monkeys who did not receive PMPA, SIV viral load did not decrease. After the 4 weeks of PMPA treatment ended the SIV viral load rebounded within two weeks back to their baseline levels. It was reported that PMPA was well tolerated in the 30 mg/kg/day dose group. In the 75 mg/kg/day dose group, no clinical toxicities or side effects were observed but chemical changes in blood markers were seen (red blood cell, phosphate and hemoglobin counts went down but were reversible).</p>

<p>In the other study, PMPA was administered in a topical gel intravaginally, and prevented the transmission of SIV to female monkeys exposed intravaginally to the virus. All of the PMPA-treated monkeys showed no signs of SIV transmission or infection throughout an eight-week follow-up period. The control monkeys who did not receive PMPA showed signs of SIV transmission and infection within two weeks of exposure to the virus.</p>

<p>Pending positive results from Phase I human trials, PMPA can be studied both in combination with other HIV antivirals and possibly as a monotherapy treatment, because from in vitro studies of monkeys PMPA resistance was not detected.</p>

<p>The study of the topical formulation of PMPA for prevention of transmission has some obstacles. It will be difficult to decide the type of formulation that may be best suited for widespread use; the PMPA concentration in the formulation must be decided; the timing of the application needs to be determined; there are concerns about vaginal mucosa irritation that need to be addressed. After initial animal studies, designing appropriate human trials may be complicated. It may be more effective to conduct initial trials in countries where sexual transmission rates are high in identified populations.</p>

<title>NATAP: Nelfinavir Resistance</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<a href="../index.html"><h4 align=center>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3>Report from ACTG Meeting--July 31, 1996: Nelfinavir Resistance Profile, studies of eradication and immediate vs. deferred use of protease inhibitor therapy</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>We are indeed living in an exciting new frontier of treatment and research of HIV, as new developments are unfolding very quickly. This report discusses new developments: the first is from Agouron regarding a their resistance profile for <a href="vct.html">nelfinavir</a>; followed by a discussion of eradication and immediate vs. deferred protease inhibitor therapy.</p>

<p><b>Nelfinavir resistance profile</b><br>
Agouron Pharmaceuticals' Amy Patick, PhD, reported first at the 5th International HIV Drug Resistance Workshop in Vancouver British Columbia (just prior to the Int'l. Conference), and again here at this meeting, of a finding that may indicate a unique mutation profile for their protease inhibitor, nelfinavir. Dr. Patick reported that nelfinavir-resistant HIV isolated from 5 patients was tested for susceptibility to indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir and 141W94; it was found that the nelfinavir resistant virus was susceptible to each of the other 4 drugs. It is premature to apply Agouron's findings too broadly, but it is important to be aware of and to follow this development.</p>

<p>Agouron reported results from both an in vitro study and the one described above. Resistance was created by taking a laboratory HIV-1 strain and subjecting it to increasing amounts of nelfinavir after starting with a sub-optimal dosing regimen. That is a standard way researchers create in vitro resistance to examine the mutation profile that results. Bear in mind these resistance patterns need confirmation, and further studies to this end are both ongoing and planned.</p>

<p>In the other study, virus from humans (clinical isolates) that had become resistant to nelfinavir from previously conducted dose ranging studies were examined.</p>

<p>The results of both studies were comparable. From the in vitro study, after the lab strain had been passaged 22 times (the virus was subjected 22 times to nelfinavir, at increasing doses), and the virus was 8 fold resistant to nelfinavir, this virus was not cross-resistant to ritonavir, indinavir or saquinavir; the mutations that occurred after 22 passages were at positions 30 and 71. After 28 passages, and 32 fold resistance to nelfinavir emerged, resistance to ritonavir was 11 fold, indinavir 9 fold, and saquinavir 5 fold. Generally, 4-5 fold is considered resistant.</p>

<p>From analysis of clinical isolates of 17 study subjects who particpated in the human dose ranging study, the predominant mutation change in those that were resistant to nelfinavir was at position 30. This muation was stably maintained during the time period of the study (28 weeks). Other changes were also observed but at a lower incidence at positions--35, 36, 46, 71, 77, and 88. Mutations described for other protease inhibitors were never observed--48 (saquinavir) and 84 (indinavir and ritonavir); rarely observed was a mutation at 90 (saquinavir). One subject had a mutation at 82, but also had a change at 48 at baseline and was using surreptitously using saquinavir. </p>

<p>The clinical isolates which exhibited a reduction in susceptibilty to nelfinavir contained the same mutation at 30, while all clinical isolates which were sensitive to nelfinavir did not. Viruses containing this 30 mutation and having a 5 to 100 fold reduction in susceptibility to nelfinavir were fully susceptible to saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir and 141W94 (Glaxo Wellcome protease inhibitor).</p>

<p>This is a unique resistance profile, as the 30 mutation has not been associated with resistance to the three approved protease inhibitors. This is suggestive that after treatment with nelfinavir, if resistance to nelfinavir develops, treatment with other protease inhibitors may be effective. However, the opposite would not necessarily apply; that is, if resistance develops from prior treatment with ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir or 141W94, it would not necessarily follow that then the resistant virus would be susceptible to nelfinavir. Agouron would have to study viruses resistant to other protease inhibitors from initial treatment and subsequently expose that virus to nelfinavir and, of course, that study needs to be conducted. </p>

<p>In Vancouver, this information created some controversy. Some observers said they were suspect of this data. Another prominent researcher said "the data are the data." Although it is too soon to place much stock into this information, it is important to closely follow this development, as it may be crucial.</p>

<p><b>Eradication of HIV in the Infected individual</b><br>
For background on this subject, please see the <a href="erad.html">article on eradication</a>. This has become a very controversial subject, that everyone is discussing and about which a good deal is being written. Because of the development and availability of new potent drugs--protease inhibitors, and <a href="nevir.html">nevirapine</a>--we can for the first time, begin to address this question. Please bear in mind, the possibility of eradication of HIV from the infected person may be remote. Please do not yet place too much stock in this possibility, as many questions remain to be addressed in trials. But, the good news is that plans for clinical trials exploring the possibility of eradication, or the possibility of turning HIV into a chronic manageable disease, are being currently discussed. </p>

<p>The results of small pilot studies of triple-drug therapy in <a href="6031.html">chronically infected treatment-naive individuals</a>, as well as in <a href="azt3rit.html">sero-converters</a> (recently infected individuals) reported in Vancouver have contributed to the discussion of the possibility of eradicating the virus. Viral RNA in plasma in these study subjects has been reduced below levels of 100 or possibly even 25 RNA copies/ml; as well, other studies have contributed to the thinking that it may be possible to eradicate HIV from the infected person, or turn HIV into a chronic manageable disease. But, viral reservoirs in other "compartments" (including lymph nodes, testes, central nervous system) may be difficult to drain; in fact, some researchers think these reservoirs may be sanctuaries that may be impossible to drain. If we can't drain the virus from these compartments, eradication may not be possible; but, the alternative may still remain, of turning HIV into a long-term manageable disease. These questions will have to be addressed in studies. Until we have results from these studies, the potential for eradication is a merely a hypothesis, but obviously it is vitally important to initiate this research.</p>

<p>Studying this hypothesis is a most pressing issue, and plans to study it are in fact on a fast track. Proposals for such studies are circulating within the ACTG. To explore and confirm whether or not eradication can be accomplished, the concept of induction therapy followed by maintenance therapy needs to be studied. Individuals would be administered a potent 3-drug combination (including a potent protease inhibitor) for a pre-determined period of time called the induction phase. The maintenance phase would follow, where some individuals would start peeling away drugs. At key points in time during the study, certain "compartments" should be assessed for virus--lymph nodes, CSF, testes, etc.-- to explore whether or not the reduction in virus in the plasma is paralled with reductions in virus in these other hard to reach "compartments". </p>

<p><b>Immediate vs. Deferred Potent Therapy</b><br>
Another cutting edge crucial issue, that everyone is talking about is when should an individual begin a potent therapy. This controversial subject is discussed in detail in NATAP's report--"Perspectives on Viral Load (HIV RNA) and When To Initiate Therapy", in the section entitled-- When To Initiate Therapy. More aggressive AIDS researchers are recommending an HIV infected individual should "hit early and hit hard". Other more conservative AIDS treating physicians are recommending initiating therapy with a 2-drug nucleoside combination (or ddI monotherapy) which would be followed by a potent 3-drug therapy after an individual progresses.</p>

<p>The plan is to address this issue in studies examining immediate vs. deferred therapy with a potent 3-drug treatment. Essentially, individuals would be randomized to either the immediate arm, where they would receive a potent 3-drug therapy, or to the deferred group which would initiate individuals on a nucleoside therapy (the regimen could be a nucleoside combination or ddI monotherapy). </p>

<p>Whether or not an individual should initiate therapy with a regimen of nucleoside(s), and hold the big guns for later (a potent 3-drug therapy), or initiate the potent therapy first, is a controversial subject addressed in the NATAP booklet on Perspectives on Viral Load. Many treating physicians and AIDS researchers are taking the approach that an individual should first initiate therapy with a nucleoside regimen, followed by a potent protease inhibitor therapy if and when disease progression occurs. The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published, in their issue of July 10, 1996, <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/special/hiv/library/jama96/st6007.htm">recommendations from a panel of AIDS doctors and researchers</a>. These recommendations were first determined in January 1996 and revisisions were incorporated by group consensus during the February-May period of time. Briefly, they recommend initiating therapy with a nucleoside regimen to be followed by a protease inhibitor regimen after disease progression.</p>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, other AIDS researchers have called for a "hit hard and early" approach, where they recommend initiating therapy with a potent 3-drug therapy. The rationales for both sides are discussed in the NATAP published booklet referred to above--"Perspectives on Viral Load and When to Initiate Therapy" (available by contacting NATAP).</p>

<p>Of course, individuals can stake out their own position on this controversial issue. But, the ACTG is planning to address this question with a study of immediate vs. deferred protease inhibitor therapy. Discussions are ongoing for the design of such a study.</p>

<title>NATAP: Triple Therapy with AZT/3TC and Ritonavir in newsly infected subjects</title>
</head>

<a href="index.html"><h4 align=center>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3>NEWLY INFECTED SUBJECTS: Triple Therapy with AZT/3TC and Ritonavir</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>Vancouver Abstract Th. B. 933, M Markowitz, Y Cao, A Hurley, R O'Donovan, M Heath-Chiozzi, J Leonard, L Smilet, A Keller, D Johnson, DD Ho</p>

<hr size=2 align=center width=50% noshade>

<p>This study was designed in December of 1994, when it became clear there is high viral replication at all stages of HIV infection.</p>

<p>Newly infected HIV-1 infected patients represent the ideal study population to determine whether HIV-1 infection can be eradicated with combination antiviral therapy. This is due to the homogenous nature of the viral population early in infection, the lower likelihood of multiply drug-resistant virus within the viral population, and, finally, the relatively intact status of the host immune function. To learn whether HIV-1 infection can be eradicated from a human host, 12 subjects newly infected with HIV-1 were recruited between August 1995 and February 1996".</p>

<p><b>Commentary-</b><br>
An important question not adequately addressed by a study in newly infected individuals (nor the AZT/3TC/nelfinavir study of treatment-naive individuals) is the treatment and disease management of individuals with moderate or advanced disease with treatment experience, or for those who may have exhausted available treatment options except for protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors.  Although the indinavir trial of AZT/3TC/indinavir (study #035) in AZT-experienced, 3TC-naive individuals addresses treatment of a drug-experienced group, we need to design and implement trials that will more broadly explore optimizing treatment strategies for this group of individuals. I hope the research establishment will not become preoccupied with  eradication" studies for newly infected or treatment-naive individuals, to the point of not paying adequate attention to those with more advanced disease. </p>

<p>In the past, individuals with advanced disease often-times appeared to be written off, by researchers, drug companies and even some activists. It is clear that with the advent of many new therapies including protease inhibitors, it becomes increasingly more likely that we can devise viable treatment strategies for individuals with more advanced  disease. </p>

<p>However, the apparent early success of treating newly infected and treatment-naive individuals lends a measure of credibility to the notion of treating  early and hard" for all others who may be treatment-experienced or more advanced; because, if its true that the success of treatment is a function of homogeniety of viral population, less resistant virus, and the status of one's immune function, then the earlier it is in the course of disease progression, for any individual, the more successful treatment may be, unless you are afraid of exhausting treatment options; but, many new drugs are currently in clinical development: 1592U89, 141W94, nelfinavir, delavirdine, nevirapine (approved recently), DMP 266 (a non-nucleoside RT inhibitor), and others.  In pre-clinical development are: the Upjohn protease inhibitor, ABT-378 (Abbott's new protease inhibitor) and others. Still, some are concerned about the utility of the subsequent use of a protease inhibitor after pre-treatment with a different protease inhibitor, if a measure of resistance develops to the first one used. <i>(end of commentary)</i></p>

<p>Twelve newly infected study subjects were treated with--</p>
<ul>
<li>AZT 200 mg tid,
<li>3TC 150 mg bid,
<li>ritonavir 600 mg bid.
</ul>
 
<p><b>Study subjects</b><br>                  
All 12 had circulating plasma virus as determined by bDNA (2nd generation whose lowest level of measure is 500 copies/ml), and one of the following to indicate recent infection:</p>

<ul>
<li>a negative HIV-1 ELISA (1/12),
<li>an evolving Western Blot with progression of at least two bands (7/12), or
<li>a negative HIV-1 antibody test within 120 days of screening and a clinical history consistent with acute HIV-1 infection (4/12).
</ul>

<p>All subjects had symptoms of acute infection, three mild, six moderate, three severe. Nine of 12 identified a precise time of infection that preceded the onset of symptoms by an average of 15 days (range 6-20). Therapy was initiated on average 65 days after the onset of symptoms (range 40-126).</p>

<p><b>Baseline HIV RNA in plasma</b></p>
<ul>
<li>median baseline viral load: 10,423 RNA copies/ml (4.01 log)
<li>mean baseline viral load: 91,389 RNA copies/ml (4.96 log)
<li>range baseline viral load: 1,400 to 953,200 RNA copies/ml (3.15 - 5.98 log)
</ul>

<p>As you can see, some patients were captured at peak and some past peak", Dr. Markowitz said.</p>

<p>Baseline CD4--</p>
<ul>
<li>mean CD4:  633 CD4 cells/mm3
<li>range:  312 to 906
</ul>

<p>CD4/CD8 ratios were inverted at baseline with a mean of 0.75, with a range from 0.41 to 1.03.</p>

One subject was treated with AZT/3TC alone until month 7, when indinavir was added when it became commercially available; he developed a ritonavir allergy and investigators were not allowed to re-challenge him with ritonavir. There are 8 subjects who have been on triple therapy for 4-10 months, and also included, in the set of data,  is the person who was on AZT/3TC with indinavir added.</p>

<p>After 12 months of continuous therapy, subjects with a minimum of 9 months  undetectable" virus (by bDNA under 500 equiv/ml) and PBMC co-culture (under 0.1 TCID/106 PBMC) will be asked to undergo lymph node biopsy to assess for persistent viral activity.</p>

<p>Decisions whether to continue therapy will be discussed and made by subject and principal investigator based on what is seen in blood, tissue, immune responses.</p>

<p>Dr. Markowitz emphasized that this is an ongoing experiment to test a hypothesis. It is premature to draw any conclusions yet. Many questions remain to be addressed.</p>

<p><b>Commentary</b><br>
There are a number of  compartments" where virus may be present, in addition to the lymph nodes.  In Vancouver, other compartments about which we should possibly be concerned were identifed and they include: testes, brain, CSF. David Ho discussed how difficult it is to adequately penetrate the brain. He said, even the therapies currently available to us that do penetrate the brain, are not adequately effective. Other researchers believe there are, in fact,  sanctuaries" for the virus in these other compartments, and expressed doubt of the potential for emptying or  eradicating" virus from these other compartments; while I believe Ho has stated there are no sancutaries.  As you can see, there are many remaining questions that need to be addressed.</p>

<h3>Combination use of Ritonavir and Saquinavir in HIV-infected patients--Preliminary Safety and Activity Data</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>Abstract # Th.B.934, authors- William Cameron, E Sun, M Markowitz, C Farthing, D McMahon, D Poretz, C Cohen, S Follansbee, D Ho, J Mellors, A Hsu, GF Granneman, R Maki, M Salgo, M Court, J Leonard </p>

<hr size=2 align=center width=50% noshade>

<p>For months, many have been waiting data on this combination, particularly AIDS treating doctors and people with AIDS, who have been anxiously anticipating some useful data. The negotiations between Roche and Abbott to conduct these studies began a year ago. The first trial in healthy HIV- volunteers began in December 1995, and the trial, under discussion here, in HIV+ individuals began in March 1996, and explores different dosing combinations of ritonavir and saquinavir.</p>

<p>The results discussed below are positive and promising, but it's important to note the results are preliminary, as these results consist of only 6 weeks of efficacy and safety data. We still are uncertain of what the optimal dosing regimen could be, the durability of these results and the longer-term safety of the combination.</p>

<p>Some of the concerns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the data so far available and presented here for combination of ritonavir and saquinavir is based on only 63 study subjects; about 3,000 individuals were studied in clinical trials using saquinavir; the clinical trials of indinavir studied over 2,000 subjects; the trials of ritonavir studied over 1,500 individuals, and the trials for these 3 drugs took place over a period of about 2 years. This ongoing study of the combination of saquinavir and ritonavir  began only several months ago. We do not yet know the longer-term safety profile for this combination. Ritonavir raises saquinavir's blood levels much higher than those resulting both from the currently recommended dosing regimen of saquinavir and from the blood levels of the new more potent formulation of saquinavir, which is now in clinical trials.
<p>
<li>although, as you will see the data below, after 6 weeks the CD4 and viral load improvements are impressive, we don't yet know how durable they will be; still,
<ul>
<li>Dr. Cameron, a study investigator, said--".......Animal and human pharmacokinetics studies have demonstrated that the co-administration of ritonavir and saquinavir achieves high and sustained plasma levels of both drugs, and thus should maintain prolonged vital suppression, reducing the opportunity for the emergence of viral resistance".
</ul>
<li>the data presented below is for 2 of the 4 dosing regimens being studied in this trial; there is not yet data available for the other two regimens. Which one of the 4 regimens will prove to be most effective remains a question. Of course, it is possible that all may be fairly equally effective.
However, for those individuals with few if any remaining treatment options, using the combination of ritonavir and saquinavir represents an important treatment option. These individuals can take two drugs that they've never taken before. This represents a particularly significant opportunity, which many have already chosen to seize. 
</ul>

<p>At the Vancouver AIDS Conference, the Dr. William Cameron, of Canada's Ottawa General Hospital, presented the study results. </p>

<p>--He said,</p>

<ul>
<li>"these are the only two protease inhibitors to show improvement in survival and disease progression".
<dt><b>Commentary</b>--I think that Crixivan will display the benefits to survival and disease progression at least as well as these two drugs.
<p>
<li>"ritonavir enhances and sustains saquinavir blood levels".
<dt><b>Commentary</b>--the important premise underlying the combination of these two drugs is that ritonavir suppresses a mechanism of liver metabolism which allows other drugs to have a higher blood level. High blood levels of saquinavir result from using ritonavir together with Saquinavir. 
<p>
<li>"these two drugs have divergent resistance patterns". 
<dt><b>Commentary</b>--Apparently, the mutation profile that causes saquinavir resistance does not significantly overlap with the mutation profile of ritonavir. The most relevant in vivo mutations for ritonavir occur at 36, 54, 71, 82, 20, 46, 84--respectively; for saquinavir 48 and 90 are the most relevant locations for mutation, and thereby resistance.
</ul>

<p>Cameron presented a slide displaying the:</p>

<ul>
<li>Effects of ritonavir on saquinavir blood levels (single dose)" 
</ul>

<p>It depicted the effect of different regimens and dosing on saquinavir AUC (ug. hr/ml):</p>

<ul>
<li>200 mg of saquinavir monotherapy did not cause a detectable AUC;
<li>400 mg caused a barely detectable AUC level of saquinavir;
<li>600 mg was not much of an improvement , all 3 with a measurement <li>under 1;
<li>200 mg saquinavir combined with 600 mg ritonavir had a measurement of about 12;
<li>400 mg saquinavircombined with 600 mg ritonavir had a measurement of about 25;
<li>600 mg saquinavircombined with 600 mg ritonavir had a measurement of about 40.
</ul>

<p>Cameron presented a slide entitled:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ritonavir enhances Saquinavir (blood) levels in human studies at two weeks"
</ul>

<p>It showed the median steady-state AUC (ug.hr/ml)--</p>

<ul>
<li>a saquinavir dose of 600 mg monotherapy every 4 hours, for a daily total <li>of 3,600 mg, the measure was about 2;
<li>a saquinavir dose of 1,200 mg monotherapy every 4 hours, for a total daily dose of 7,200 mg, the measure was about 10;
<li>saquinavir 400 mg every 12 hours combined with 400 mg ritonavir every 12 hours resulted in an AUC measure of about 30;
<li>saquinavir 600 mg every 12 hours combined with ritonavir 600 mg every 12 hours (daily dose of 1,200 mg saquinavir) resulted in an AUC measure of about 60.
</ul>

<p><b>Commentary</b>--As you can see, ritonavir greatly increases blood levels of saquinavir. Again, we do not yet know the longer-term effects of raising saquinavir blood levels to such high levels--durability and safety.</p>

<P><b>THE STUDY:</b><br>
The study objectives are to evaluate dose combinations, pharmacokinetics, virology and long-term safety, tolerance and activity. </p>

<p>120 HIV-infected individuals, with 100-500 CD4 cells/mm3, were randomized in a multi-center study with all subjects receiving open-label saquinavir and ritonavir. All participants discontinued use of RT inhibitors for the study. Drugs were initiated in escalating dose fashion through the first few days to optimize tolerability.</p>

<p>After a 2-week safety evaluation period, study subjects are randomized to four groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>ritonavir 400 mg bid + saquinavir 400 mg bid (n=30)
<li>ritonavir 600 mg bid + saquinavir 400 mg bid (n=30)
<li>ritonavir 400 mg tid + saquinavir 400 mg tid (n=30)
<li>ritonavir 600 mg bid + saquinavir 600 mg bid (n=30)
</ul>

<ul>
<li>at 2 weeks RNA reduction &amp; CD4 increase from baseline approx.-- 1.6 log - 25 cells

<li>6 weeks--viral load reduction &amp; CD4 increase from baseline approx.-- 2.6 log - 100 cells
</ul>

<p><b>Commentary:</b><br>
The number of study participants for which this data applies is small, and the resulting differences in data between the two groups is small, so at most you may be able to say there is a suggestion of a trend that the 600mg RTV+400mg SQV 400 mg is superior to the 400mg RTV bid/400mg SQV bid group; but, you could just as easily say the differences in data between the 2 groups is too small to draw any conclusion. It is also important to remember that the 2 other dosing regimens, for which we don't yet have efficacy data, are being studied (600mg bid RTV/600 mg SQV bid and 400mg RTV tid/400mg SQV tid), and they could prove to be superior (in terms of safety and/or efficacy) to both of the groups discussed here.  <i>end of commentary</i></p>

<p>Reduction of viral load below 200 copies/ml at 6 weeks--47% had undetectable RNA in the 400mg RTN bid/400mg SQV bid group, 65% were undetectable (below 200 copies/ml) in the group receiving 600 RTN bid/400 SQV bid.</p>

<p>at 6 weeks----70% in the 400/400 bid group had either a 2 log decrease in RNA from  baseline or were below 200 copies (undetectable).</p>

<p>--86% in the 600 RTV/400 SQV group had either a 2 log decrease in RNA from baseline or were below the level of detection for this test (200 copies/ml).</p>

<p><b>Commentary:</b><br>
Again, this is a small data set, but the graph line depicting the % of individuals who were RNA undetectable appeared to be ascending.<i>(end of commentary)</i></p>

<p><b>CD8 changes:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>at 6 weeks--the increase in CD8 from baseline is 175 in the 600 RTV/400 SQV group
<li>at 6 weeks--the increase in CD8 from baseline is 100 in the 400 RTV/400 SQV group

</font></pre>

<p><b>NOTE</b>-- The rate of discontinuation in this study, as well as in other studies, may be lower than the rate of discontinuation with ritonavir as it is used in private practice. This could be due to the management of side effects by the treating physician. The nurse and doctor running this study are very adept with properly informing individuals, who are taking ritonavir, on what side effects to expect, how to deal with them, how to properly use the dose escalation method recommended by Abbott, and generally guiding individuals through the process of acclimating to taking ritonavir. But, in private practice the treating physician may not be as well informed informed about the proper use of rironavir; and/or, they may not take the time to acclimate their patients in the details of properly using the drug.</p>

<p>Future directions for studies as outlined by Abbott--<br>
ritonavir+saquinavir in combination with:</p>
<ul>
<li>AZT+3TC
<li>d4T+ddI
<li>d4T+3TC
</ul>

<p>RTV+SQV+RT inhibitor(s):</p>
<ul>
<li>newly infected individuals
<li>advanced disease
<li>HIV transmission and prevention
<li>remission induction
</ul>

<h3>Stavudine (d4T) and Didanosine (ddI) Combination Therapy in HIV-Infected Subjects: Antiviral Effect and Safety in an On-going Pilot Randomized Double-Blinded Trial</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>Vancouver Abstract Th.B.293, authors-- R Pollard, D Peterson, D Hardy, L Pednault, V Rutkiewicz, I Pottage, R Murphy, J Gathe, G Beall, L Stovronsky, A Cross, L Dunkle</p>

<hr size=2 align=center width=50% noshade>

<p>In January 1996 at the Human Retrovirus Conference, Dr. Richard Pollard presented data from a pilot randomized double-blinded study of antiretroviral naive individuals, which evaluates combination therapy of d4T and ddI for safety and antiviral effect. </p>

<p>Data was presented in Vancouver for additional study participants. Following is a discussion of this study.</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>antiretoviral treatment-naive
<li>200-500 CD4 cells/mm3
<li>52-weeks in duration
<li>individuals randomized to one of 5 different combinations of dosing regimens
<li>to measure safety and changes in CD4 and viral load
</ul>

<p>Pollard said,</p>

<ul>
<li>in vitro, ddI and d4T in combination shows synergy for HIV inhibition and <li>antagonism for cytotoxicity
<li>pilot pharmacokinetic study revealed no significant influence on the profile of each drug when administered together
<li>ddI resistance develops slowly, d4T resistance has been difficult to demonstrate
<li>peripheral neuropathy is dose-related for each drug and is reported more frequently for those with lower CD4 cell counts and prior nucleoside neuropathy; we need to study this combination in additional patient  populations, because there is potential for patients who've had a lot of other nucleosides or HIV related neuropathy to have more symptoms.
</ul>

<p>Eighty-five individuals started therapy with one of the following treatment regimens; 65 of the 85 study subjects had baseline RNA copies/ml of 1,000 or more:</p>

<pre><font size=3>

			<b>ddI (mg/bid)*</b>			<b>d4T (mg/bid)*</b>
Study Arm	under 60 kg	above 60 kg	under 60 kg	above 60 kg (60 kg=132 lbs)

C		75		100		30		40
D		125		200		15		20
E		125		200		30		40

<b>Baseline Characteristics:</b>
		started therapy		1000 or more RNA copies/ml

mean			15,800 RNA copies/ml	25,100 RNA copies/ml
			(4.2 log10)		(4.4 log10)
</font></pre>

<p><b>Mean Change in Viral Load:</b><br>
subjects with at least 1000 RNA copies/ml at baseline; combined data from all 5 dosing regimen groups; it is important to bear in mind that the number of subjects is small for each of the different dosing regimens, upon which this collective data is based, therefore results can vary when larger numbers of subjects are factored in--</p>

<pre>
<font size=3>
baseline	(n=65)
4 weeks	(n=57)	1.20 log reduction from baseline
8 weeks 	(n=50)	1.20             
16 weeks	(n=46)	1.00          
28 weeks	(n=36)	1.30           
52 weeks	(n=18)	1.30
</font></pre>  

<p><b>Comments</b>--The sustained RNA reduction after 52 weeks may be at least partially due to the slow development of resistance to both drugs.</p>

<p><b>Mean Change in CD4:</b><br>
for all subjects including those with RNA levels above and below 1000 RNA copies/ml at baseline, combined data from all 5 dosing regimen groups--</p>

<pre>

52		18		10 (56)		6 (33)
</font></pre>

<P><b>Adverse Events</b></br>
Based on the set of data discussed above, Pollard reported the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>no dose related adverse events
<li>one case of grade 2 peripheral neuropathy, which was resolved by discontinuing medications, but therapy was tolerated at a reduced dose
<li>8 subjects had liver enzyme elevations, some were related to hepatitis A
</ul>
 
<p>Prior to Vancouver, a set of data was available based on a fewer number of study participants, but the data was broken down by dosing regimen; again, it is important to remember the number of subjects for each dosing regimen group is small, and results can be less consistent with a smaller number of subjects. Therefore, these results may vary when larger numbers of study subjects are considered.</p>

<b>Adverse Events</b>:
these events are based on the 2nd set of data for the smaller number of subjects (n=76), again, these results can also vary when larger numbers of subjects are factored in --

  -SGPT				3	2	-	2	1 
  -bilirubin			-	1	-	-	-

</font></pre>

<p>The data has not been fully analyzed yet, but it appears as though there have been 2 discontinuations due to lipase elevations.</p>

<p><b>CSF Penetration:</b><br>
Bristol-Myers says--<br>
 After a single d4T 40 mg dose in 12 healthy subjects, CSF and simultaneous plasma concentrations were determined. Mean CSF concentration was 40% of mean simultaneous plasma concentrations. Mean CSF concentration 4 to 5 hours post dose was 63.1 ng/ml (0.28 um). These results demonstrate that d4T does penetrate into the CSF and produces CSF concentration which exceed the ED50 of HIV clinical isolates."</p>

<p>Abstract Th.B.931 -- <b>POTENT AND SUSTAINED ANTIRETROVIRAL ACTIVITY OF INDINAVIR AZT AND 3TC</b>"<br>
Authors--R Gulick, J Mellors, D Havlir, J Eron, C Gonzalez, D McMahon, D Richman, F Valentine, J Rooney, L Jonas, A Meibohm, E Emini, J Chodakewtiz </p>
<hr size=2 width=50% align=center noshade>

<p>The first results presented for this study were by Dr. Roy Gulick, a study investigator at NYU, at the Human Retrovirus Conference in January 1996. The detailed report of the data presented in January is available on the NATAP web-site in the article entitled Daily Highlights--Days 3 & 4, which is listed with other reports under Human Retrovirus Conference, and should add to the perspective of interpreting the data here. Six months of data were presented in January. In Vancouver, and detailed in this article, Dr. Gulick reported 48 weeks of data.</p>

<p>The objectives of this trial are to evaluate safety, efficacy, magnitude of antiretroviral activity, duration of antiretroviral activity and the development of resistance.</p>

<p>Study design <br>
Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized--comparing:</p> 
<ul>
<li>indinavir (IDV) 800 mg every 8 hours + AZT 200 mg every 8 hours + 3TC <li>150 mg bid (every 12 hrs.) 
<li>IDV 800 mg every 8 hrs (monotherapy)
<li>AZT 200 mg every 8 hours + 3TC 150 mg every 12 hrs
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3TC naive
<li>CD4 50-400/mm3 
<li>HIV RNA 20,000 or above copies/ml (Roche PCR kit)
<li>6 months or more previous AZT therapy

</font></pre>

<p>Merck has reported--<br>
"Nephrolithiasis can cause flank pain, hematuria (blood in urine). Reported to date-- approximately 4% (79/2205) of patients receiving indinavir in clinical trials have developed Nephrolithiasis. In general, these events were not associated with renal dysfunction and resolved with adequate hydration and temporary interruption of therapy (e.g. 1-3 days). Following an acute episode (kidney stones can develop), 9.2% (7/76) of patients discontinued therapy.</p>

<p>Asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin above 2.4 mg/dl) reported predominantly as elevated indirect bilirubin, has occurred in approximately 10% of patients treated with indinavir in clinical trials. In less than 1% this was associated with elevations in ALT or AST.</p>

<p>Hyperbilirubinemia and nephrolithiasis occurred more frequently at doses exceeding the currently recommended daily dose of 800 mg/3X-day."</p>

<p><b>Commentary</b><br>
It has been reported that the elevated bilirubin usually subsides after a brief time on drug. Merck has said they do not believe there are longer-term consequences related to this side effect. Long-term safety data will address this issue as it becomes available. The long-term data for all protease inhibitors will be the truer measure of any long-term side effects or toxicities, as well as for the durability of efficacy.  Again, because of the potential for kidney stones, it is highly recommended that adequate hydration be strictly adhered to when taking indinavir.  Merck has recommended drinking at least 48 ounces of water per day; it is also recommended that you drink at least 8-10 ounces at the time of taking the indinavir pills.<br>

</font></pre>

<p><b>Commentary</b><br>
This study suggests, as well as other studies suggest, that for individuals with extensive prior treatment experience (the participants in this study had about 2 yrs & 5 months AZT experience) and relatively low CD4 counts (144 cells in this study) merely adding another nucleoside to a current regimen of 1 nucleoside  may not offer significantly lasting benefits. In Vancouver, there was some disagreement and controversy among researchers over when a treatment naive individual should begin therapy and with which therapy. However, for individuals who are treatment-experienced and with moderately or advanced disease progression, the considerations are different regarding when to initiate protease inhibitor therapy and with which other accompanying drug(s).</p>

<p>For a fuller discussion, see the NATAP booklet  Perspectives on Viral Load (HIV RNA and When To Initiate Therapy: a discussion of data, how to use viral load tests, how to interpret results"; or, you can read the article on the NATAP web-site <a href="hivrna.html">Viral Load: Important information</a>", which was written prior to updated revisions incorporated into the booklet.</p>

<h3>ANTIRETROVIRAL-NAIVE SUBJECTS CHRONICALLY INFECTED WITH HIV-1: Triple therapy with nelfinavir in combination with AZT and 3TC
-- Vancouver Abstract L.B.B. 6031, Martin Markowitz et al</h3>

<blockquote>


<P>&quot;This study is testing the hypothesis: triple therapy with two nucleoside RT inhibitors and a potent protease inhibitor may erect an antiviral barrier such that durable suppression of measurable viral replication occurs. This in turn, should result in long-term immunologic benefit&quot;.</p>

<P>The study objectives are to explore:</p>

<ul>
<li>safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics,
<li>to determine the significance of prolonged viremia,
<li>to understand the nature of CD4 and CD8 repopulation post-therapy, <li>to model the 2nd phase of decay of free virus and virus producing cells.
</ul>

<P>Twelve antiretrovirus-naive HIV-infected subjects, with screening
HIV RNA plasma viral load above 10,000 copies/ml, were started
on therapy of: </p>
<ul>
<li>AZT 200 mg tid (every 8 hrs or 3X/day)
<li>3TC 150 mg bid (every 12 hours or 2X/day)
<li>nelfinavir 750 mg tid (Agouron's protease inhibitor)
</ul>

<P>Baseline evaluations for the study group were:</p>
<ul>
<li>HIV plasma RNA: 
<dt>mean - 209,011 copies/ml (5.32 log) 
<dt>median - 81,270 copies/ml (4.91 log) 
<dt>range - 177,990 - 864,900  copies/ml (4.26 - 5.94 log)
<li>CD4 cell counts: 
<dt>mean - 258 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>
<dt>median - 253 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>
<dt>range - 37 - 557 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>
</ul>

<p>Previous opportunistic infection: 1 had PCP out of 12 subjects.</p>

<p>HIV related conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1/12 nephropathy and myopathy 
<li>1/12 eosinophilic pustular folliculitis 
<li>2/12 oral candidiasis 
<li>1/12 hairy leukoplakia
</ul>

<P>Safety:</p>
<ul>
<li>1/12 withdrew at week 6 grade 4 elevation of CPK and for grade 2 diarrhea and abdominal cramping
<li>investigators said &quot;triple therapy has been well tolerated with mild to moderate diarrhea, mild to moderate nausea and fatigue being the most common drug related adverse events&quot;
<li>no other serious side effects
</ul>

<P><b>Virology</b></p>

<p><b>Changes in plasma RNA</b>: 
<br>By week 8 the mean reduction in viral RNA in plasma was 2.6 log; by week 12, 11/11 were below the detection level of the RNA test being used (under 500 RNA copies/ml).</p>

<ul>
<li>the number of subjects below detectability: 
<dt>week 2 -- 2 
<dt>week 3 -- 2 
<dt>week 4 -- 7 
<dt>week 6 -- 8 
<dt>week 8 -- 10 
<dt>week 12 -- 11 
<dt>week 16 -- 11
</ul>

<p><b>RNA less than 25 copies</b>: <br>
The levels of plasma RNA were measured by a sensitive test down to a detectable level of 25 copies/ml. By week 8, the average RNA levels were below the detectability level of this test.</p>

<P>&quot;Negativity in PBMC co-cultures (under 0.1 TCID<sub>50</sub>/10<sup>6</sup> PBMC) have been achieved in all remaining 11 subjects by week 12 of therapy...... Following the predicted 2.0 log reduction in plasma RNA in the first 2-3 weeks, the second phase of viral decay was slower with a mean T<sub>1/2</sub> of approximately 17 days. Associated with this degree of suppression of viral replication, a mean and median increase of 109 and 98 (CD4) cells/mm<sup>3</sup> is observed at 12 weeks.&quot;</p>

<P><b>Commentary</b>: <br>
It is important to note that, depending on an individual's viral load level prior to treatment, it can take up to 12 weeks before their viral load becomes undetectable by a commercially available test. The higher the pre-treatment viral load the longer it may take to become undetectable.</p>

<P>David Ho discussed in Vancouver the data he has gathered on the kinetics of the virus and CD4 lymphocyte turnover in vivo. From experiments conducted by Ho and George Shaw, of the University of Alabama- Birmingham, the widely discussed new theories of HIV pathogenesis or kinetics have emerged. Prior thinking was that there was a prolonged period of relative virus latency; this has been replaced with the thinking that ongoing, high-level viral replication takes place from the time of initial infection. This research says, as many as 10 billion new HIV virions are produced per day, with a half-life in plasma of 6 hours. CD4 cells, a principle
target for the virus responsible for viral replication, are turning over in high number, and once productively infected, have a half-life of 1.6 days. The life-cycle of the virus, from infection of one cell to the production of new progeny, which infects the next cell, is 2.6 days.</p>

<P>Based upon this work, immediately following potent therapy (as in this case with AZT/3TC/nelfinavir), the &quot;first phase&quot; of viral decay, occurs where 99% of the free virus in plasma decreases exponentially in the first 2-3 weeks with a short half-life, consistent with the rapid turnover of virions and productively infected cells. A slower &quot;second phase&quot; of viral decay can take longer, and includes latently infected CD4 lymphocytes, and long lived cells, presumably which contribute less than 1% of virus in the plasma, but are clearly able to re-initiate the rapid cycles of
viral replication detailed above. (<b><i>End of commentary</i></b>)

<li>cells in cycle - Ki67 positive CD4 &amp; CD8
<li>HIV pathogenesis - mathematical modeling of 2nd phase of viral

</ul>

<P>&quot;We conclude that triple therapy with AZT/3TC and nelfinavir
mesylate results in uniform aviremia after three months of uninterrupted
therapy and holds promise in pharmacologically controlling HIV
replication in a human host.&quot;

<p><b>Commentary</b>. As you may know there has been some ontroversy surrounding the possibility of long term suppression of HIV below detectability, and the possibility for &quot;eradication&quot; of HIV in the
infected individual. Some observers at the Conference in Vancouver objected to the presentations and discussions related to this subject, saying they encouraged listeners to put too much stock into the potential for being able to achieve long-term suppression or eradication. Others felt the concepts are important to be openly discussed at a medical conference. A concern for everyone was whether or not the press would report about the discussion of this subject at the conference in a responsible way.</p>

<p>Although it is exciting that we are able, for the first time, to ask these questions, it is crucial to remember that it is premature to take these notions seriously; additional studies must be conducted to seriously begin to address these issues.</p>

<p>At the Human Retrovirus Conference in January of 1996, 6 months data from this study were publicly presented for the first time. Presented in Vancouver was an extension of the data out to 60 weeks.</p>

<p>The drug regimen used was AZT (200 mg, tid or 3X/day), ddC (0.75 mg, tid) and ritonavir (600 mg, bid). Initially in this study, the distaseful oral solution of ritonavir was being given to study subjects. At 52 weeks, the capsules were made available and apparently compliance was better. Open-label ritonavir (600 mg, bid) monotherapy was administered for 14 days followed immediately by the addition of AZT and ddC.</p>

<p>Thirty-two study subjects with no previous antiretroviral therapy were enrolled with CD4 between 50-250 cells/mm3, or a drop of 200 cells/mm3 to a level of less than 350 cells/mm3 over a recent 6 month period, or 250 to 350 cells/mm3 with symptoms. Monitoring for efficacy and safety included HIV RNA plasma viral load (quantitative RT-PCR test from Roche), CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes counts and standard laboratory tests.</p>

<p>The baseline measures: median CD4 cell count was 180</p>

<ul>
<li>median HIV RNA in plasma was 4.8 log--63,000 copies (range 3.05-5.39; 1,122 - 245,471) and median cellular viremia was 3.5 x 10 million (range 0.78-4.30 x 10 million)
<p>
<li>mean reduction in HIV RNA plasma viral load: <br>
week 8 : 2.0 log (n=27)<br>
week 24: 2.0 log (n=21)<br>
week 60: 1.9 log (n=17)
</ul>

<p>The percentage of subjects with undetectable (below 200 copies) HIV RNA in plasma were 47% at 28 weeks, 60% at 36 weeks, 50% at 54 weeks and 60% (n=15) at 60 weeks.</p>

<ul>
<li>mean reduction in cellular viremia (infectious cells):<br>
week 8 : 2.1 log (n=26) <br>
week 24: 2.4 log (n=21) <br>
week 60: 2.4 log (n=17)
</ul>

<p>The percentage of subjects who had cellular viremia below the level of detection (5 infectious cells per 107 PBMC) was 30% at 24 weeks and 60% at 60 weeks.</p>

<ul>
<li>mean CD4 count was 170 cells at baseline:<br>
week 8 : 280 (n=26) <br>
week 24: 304 (n=21) <br>
week 60: 338 (n=17)
</ul>

<p>Eleven subjects discontinued therapy during the first six months, and six of these were contributed to the ritonavir oral solution; 2 discontinuations were due to hepatic toxicity of ritonavir. Abbott said that, following the introduction of capsules in place of the oral solution, compliance with ritonavir appears to be improved.</p>

<title>NATAP: Can HIV be "eradicated" from the infected individual?</title>

<h3>CAN HIV BE "ERADICATED" FROM THE INFECTED INDIVIDUAL?<br>
June 28</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>On June 12 and 13, a well-known group of AIDS researchers were gathered in a two day closed session, sponsored by the peer-review journal Antiviral Therapy and the University of Amsterdam to discuss the questions--can we "Eradicate HIV from an infected individual? And, do we now have the tools to turn HIV into a chronic and manageable disease?</p>

<p>Immediately following the 2-day meeting a telephone press conference was held by a representative group of researchers who participated in the 2-day discussion (Doug Richman, MD, of the University of California-San Diego; Joep Lange, MD-PhD, of the University of Amsterdam; and Julio Montaner, MD, of the Univ. of British Columbia; Luc Perrin, MD, head of the Central Laboratory at Geneva University Hospital).</p>

<p>Following this introduction is a transcription of the press conference. The HIV community should be aware of the proceedings, but it is important to place the discussion in perspective. </p>

<p><b>Introduction</b><br>
It is important to note that these discussions are preliminary. We are addressing a theoretical question--can we "eradicate" HIV from the infected person?-- properly designed studies can begin to address the question.</p>

<p>It is pre-mature to as yet accept the notion that we can "eradicate" HIV or are about to turn HIV into a chronic manageable disease. These early suggestions of that are based on an incomplete and small body of research. Some of the studies referred to below upon which this notion is based are small uncontrolled pilot studies, about whose study designs I have some questions. The results are promising, but further studies need to be properly designed and implemented before we place too much stock in them. Confirmation of these theories can only come from a variety of comprehensive additional trials that need to explore a number of related issues, many of which are outlined below.</p>

<p>The researchers discuss below how individuals in the studies to which they are referring, who've achieved viral RNA suppression below levels of detection, are not developing resistance nor progressing. These researchers don't mention in these talks, that for all the individuals who can suppress viral RNA to below detection with a potent therapy, there will be some who may not be able to a suppress their viral RNA below detection; what are the treatment strategies for these individuals? What about those individuals who remain undetectable for a period of time and then their RNA rebounds? What about those individuals who cannot tolerate a 3-drug combination? What about individuals with liver impairment that may have difficulty tolerate drugs that are metabolized through the liver? None of the drug companies, the NIH nor the academic research establishment are even considering researching this latter concern about individuals with liver impairment. </p>

<p>Of course, even the researchers admit that unless an individual is completely compliant with the drug regimens, the chances for success are minimized. Successful protease inhibitor therapy requires compliance---not missing doses, no drug holidays, not taking reduced doses, following the eating and hydration guidelines for the particular inhibitor you may be taking, being mindful of potential drug interactions. Taking a combination therapy of a protease inhibitor (or 2) plus other drug(s) requires even more guidelines to follow. We know that for the collective HIV+ population, compliance is and will be a formidable challenge. Both doctors and people taking these medications are responsible for educating themselves on procedures for proper compliance, and, it is the responsibility of our community, the government, public health officials and the medical community to collaboratively devise a public health program for addressing non-compliance.</p>

<p>HIV may be present in many "compartments" in the body besides the blood. The virus can be present in lymph nodes and other organs. After rendering HIV "undetectable" in plasma, we still do not know the effect on the viral load in these "compartments." Will this hidden virus emerge and be killed by the drug therapy? Can the hidden virus be driven from these "compartments" by the therapy we now have available? Or, will viral replication continue in these hidden "compartments?" Further research is needed to answer these questions. </p>

<p>For individuals with extensive previous drug experience, it is vital to have a timely continuing supply of new drugs. Soon, many individuals will have been on Crixivan or Norvir for 1 or even 2 years; some of these individuals have begun to develop or already have resistance to these drugs, or for other reasons couldn't tolerate them; these individuals will have to transition into untried drugs. Three important drugs are in the pipeline---nelfinavir (Agouron's protease inhibitor), 1592U89 (a potent reverse transcriptase inhibitor showing early impressive data, which may be effective against AZT resistant virus) and 141W94 (VX-478), which is a protease inhibitor; both 1592 and 141W94 are being developed by Glaxo Wellcome. Nelfinavir is currently in phase III trials--and is expected to be reviewed by the FDA by January of 1997. 1592 and VX-478 are in an earlier stage--1592 in phase II, VX-478 in phase I/II. It is vital to our community that the FDA and the developers of these drugs collaborate closely to get these drugs out as quickly as possible. The FDA and Merck and Abbott were relatively punctual with Crixivan and Norvir, but our community placed much pressure on them. We can't afford any slower of a process for these 3 important drugs.</p>

<p>We must continue to devote adequate resources to researching the restoration of the immune system. The prospect of restoring the immune system holds forth much promise. For individuals whose immune system may be depleted, we may need a restorative capacity. The use of immune-based therapies may be less expensive, easier to use and therefore more accessible. The prospects of combining immune restorative therapy with antiviral therapy are promising. We must continue to develop and better support our basic science research initiatives at the NIH, with the goal of better understanding the immune system and its relationship to the virus.</p> 

<p>On a more positive note, we are in fact entering a new era for the treatment of HIV because of the development of new drugs and the availability of viral load testing to measure their activity. Never before have we been able to ask the questions--can we "eradicate HIV or make it a chronic manageable disease. But, it is important to be circumspect, to encourage continuing research to address the unanswered questions, and not to allow ourselves to be complacent. The federal government, the drug companies and the academic researchers should be held accountable for properly conducting this research. They must devote adequate resources to the research that we need, and we must keep the pressure on them to do this. To encourage this we do not need unrealistic rhetoric from the drug companies and the press.</p>

<p>Hopefully, I've adequately covered many of the reasons to be discerning when reading these proceedings (although, I may have missed a few), because it is easy to get excited about the promises of the discussions below while overlooking the obstacles. </p>

<hr size=2 width=50% align=center noshade>

<p><b>Proceedings</b><br>
Dr. Richman said at the outset there is "absolutely no evidence yet that in fact it is possible, but what prompted the meeting was the concordance of data generated in the last 6 months from a number of places to indicate that in various patient populations infected with HIV, antiviral chemotherapy can suppress levels of virus replication to below any levels that can be detected by various methodologies that we have including culture of the virus, measure of HIV RNA and so on. And, that this level suppression eliminates any evidence of resistance and has been maintained for as long as a year or two. These data have been generated in newborns, in adults with primary or new infection, and in a number of adult patient populations with established infection, with several potent combination regimens. It is this encouraging data that has led to this conference to discuss the implications of this in terms of the pathogenesis of infection, the prospects for treatment of patients, how to design future studies to assess the best ways to use these regimens, and what the implications are for the immune system."</p>

<p> Although, Dr. Richman stated that there is absolutely no evidence yet that HIV can be eradicated, the tone of the entire press conference was that a "new paradigm" for treatment of HIV has been established. Properly designed studies must first be conducted to confirm these early findings upon which these assertions are based. Good science should dictate.</p>

<p>Dr. Richman went on to say "the approach of the first decade to antiviral therapy was using available drugs which were only partially suppressive and providing palliation, i.e. just delaying disease. What we're talking about now is a brand "new paradigm" (model) of infection which is to completely suppress virus replication; the alternative outcomes of that complete suppression is either a long-term or indefinite management of the patient with chemotherapy, so that they are turned into a long-term non-progressor or optimistically and this needs to be tested--if patients are suppressed long enough will the last embers of virus be extinguished so that in fact the infection is cured?--we don't know if it can or not, but it's a testable hypothesis."</p>

<p> Individual responses to therapy can be variable. There is the prospect that some individual's viral RNA may not be reduced below detection and others' RNA levels may rise rebound sooner than for other individuals. After this development, how many additional treatment options will these individuals have remaining?</p>

<p>He said the experts at the conference thought that the best time to treat the infection was "early and hard."

<p>A reporter asked-- how easy is it to find individuals in the earliest stages of HIV disease, since most present themselves for testing to discover their HIV status later in their disease progression?</p>

<p>Dr. Montaner said-- ."...we encourage all people infected with HIV to come forward for treatment."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richman</i>--"the best data or the highest likelihood of success is in patients experiencing primary or new infection, whether they are adults or neonates. Once an infection is established, what is becoming increasingly appreciated is that a measurement of the plasma HIV RNA can predict those people who are most likely to progress and identify people at risk even when they have very high CD4--there was a paper published in the last couple of weeks in Science (see paper on <a href="hivrna.html">VIRAL LOAD</a>: Important information) and there's going to be one published shortly in JAMA (Jnl. of American Medical Assoc.). The real issue is how early, and I think most people based on the immunological data that were discussed are also concerned about the prospect of progressive loss or deletion of immune function over time, even in patients who are asymptomatic, which is another argument for early intervention."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Montaner</i>--."......we would prefer to treat people earlier when they have a relatively lower amount of virus band viral load is relatively low, because that's where we're getting the highest likelihood of success; the immune system is preserved, you don't have to restore anything, you're basically preventing things from happening. Even for individuals with low CD4 counts, in the 300 range or even lower, they can have a very good response--80% (reference to the Boehringer Ingelheim 1046 study of drug-naive of AZT/ddI/nevirapine--see <a href="nevir.html">Nevirapine article</a>) or more of them becoming viral load negative in plasma or undetectable, when treated with the more aggressive regimens. That is very encouraging and leaves it open for everybody to approach treatment in the same way with the aim to make viral load undetectable or as low as possible for as long as possible."</p>

<p>The nevirapine trial and those in sero-converters and drug-naive individuals all study individuals who are the most likely to benefit from treatment because they've never used treatment before; what about the large population who are very drug-experienced, how will they respond? Throughout the entire talks here, very little discussion if any at all is devoted to this group of individuals. People with advanced HIV cannot be written off; effective research strategies must be devised for them. </p>

<p><i>Dr. Perrin</i>--"Another issue is that of tolerance; the later one starts treatment the more problem one may have with tolerance.</p>

<P><i>Dr. Montaner</i>-- "Also potential drug interactions, some of the drugs that we're talking about may have substantial drug interactions that may compromise their use with some of the medications that are necessary in the advanced stages of the disease. The rational for treating early and aggressively is very solid."</p>

<p><i>Reporter</i>-- I recently spoke to a number of physicians, AIDS specialists from around the country and the majority are very conservative in their treatment and did not feel that they wanted to go heavy and hard at an early stage; they might use nucleoside analogues first and try and save the protease inhibitors until later; a lot of their thinking is you don't want to use all of the arrows in your quiver.</p>

<P><i>Dr. Montaner</i>--"They're using the wrong approach; unfortunately, this is nobody's fault; we didn't know any better. Let me give you an example of some of the data that we presented here. We looked at a combination therapy study looking at combinations of AZT+ddI or AZT+nevirapine or AZT+ddI+nevirapine, this data is now in the public domain, as it was part of the package presented to the FDA for approval of nevirapine; what we were able to show with nevirapine, which is a drug for which resistance develops very rapidly when used alone, sequentially or as an add-on to previously treated individuals--what we were able to show is that by introducing treatment with 3 drugs at once you are able to prevent the development of drug failure, presumably drug resistance, because almost all the patients who were able to tolerate the medication became non-detectable in plasma viral load. The message coming out of the studies discussed here, but in particular this study because of the uniqueness of nevirapine in terms of its ability to generate resistance, confirms the notion, in my view, that if you hit hard and early and if you suppress viral replication as we can measure it today, that you virtually can expect that the treatments will remain effective for a prolonged period of time. Don't ask me for how long, because the study is ongoing but we data now up to 18 months, but we see now people on this regimen who remain plasma viral load negative for very prolonged periods of time, as we haven't seen before.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richman</i>--"One of the reasons for the conservative approach that you described is that, that has been the practice and all of the data we've been talking about in this meeting are unpublished, in fact almost none of the studies are even submitted yet for publication. But, the confluence of the data plus everything we've learned over the decades about chemotherapy of tuberculosis and oncology is that using the drugs for such large complicated biologic populations has to be done early, hard and in combination, rather than in sequential steps. The thinking will be changing but this is sort of the beginning of that.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Montaner</i>--"At the Vancouver conference, I think you will see a convergence of a large number of studies, both natural history studies and clinical trials, which are basically going to clarify this issue in the minds of most treaters. The message coming out of this scientific program is very consistent throughout, that this basically is the approach which offers the best chance of maintaining the ability of these drugs to remain effective for prolonged periods of time. Very soon, over the summer, we will see the change in attitude of the treaters based on a large body of evidence."</p>

<p><i>Reporter</i>-- The only drug names I've heard so far are AZT, ddI and nevirapine. Are you talking about treating early on from the start with a combination that includes one or two protease inhibitors, could you be specific in how you would use protease inhibitors.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richman</i>--"The data include the use of nucleosides and protease inhibitors. The data that Dr. Montaner presented yesterday were the first to show a potent combination of nucleosides with the combination of a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Which combinations, how they'll be used, whether 4 drugs will be combined, whether there will be an induction with a very potent regimen followed by maintenance with a less complicated regimen---these are all issues that are now going to have to be addressed when we go back to work.....as we get more drugs, there are more combinations and permutations that can be generated and which are the most potent, the least toxic and the least expensive will be the ones that people will pursue. But, because of the issue of prior drug history in a number of patients, having alternatives provides alternative potent combinations for people in different situations.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Montaner</i>--"To summarize the approach I would like to take with my patients, if I had all the options available: --to offer individuals a regimen that is available, --relatively well-tolerated, --with a low likelihood of drug interactions or side effects, --that is anticipated to bring down viral load to a level of non-detection in that individual.</p>

<p>"We are learning for the first time that there are several approaches that can be taken. Data has been shown, for example, for AZT/3TC/indinavir--AZT/ddI/nevirapine and a number of other combinations that will present options for patients. </p>

<p>"We have put a face to the enemy--we can target our therapy, we can look for it, where it's at and where we want to drive it.</p>

<p>"The treatment of HIV is now entering a stage where it becomes a dynamic process. You have a number of options; you have an understanding of what the drugs can do. The availability of viral load measurement of drug activity affords treaters with the capacity to within a few weeks to detect the results of the initiation of therapy and with the ability to follow its path."</p>

<p><i>Reporter</i>--What was the longest period of follow-up with protease inhibitors, that was presented at this meeting?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richman</i>--"Complete suppression in patients has been observed for up to two years in patients on various regimens. The phenomenon of complete suppression occurs in --the proportion of people who experience complete suppression is a function (1) of the potency of the drug regimen, (2) starting level at which they are treated and (3) compliance of the patient to the regimen. The small number of patients in these studies who are most likely to fail are those who don't adhere to the regimen for whatever reason. The biologic principle is that drug resistance can't develop if virus can't replicate. So, once we've suppressed virus sufficiently resistance doesn't emerge and suppression is sustained as long as the patient takes the drug.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Montaner</i>--."......if you prevent viral replication, you won't get resistance. That truly changes how we approach to the disease and treatment."</p>

<p><i>Reporter</i>-- What exactly do you mean by reducing the level to undetectable, does that mean that level is low enough so the person is no longer infectious?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richman</i>--"The most sensitive readily available assay now is the Roche RT-PCR assay and that can be read down to 100 to 200 copies/ml of plasma. With some modifications we can assay by PCR down to 10 or so copies/ml of plasma; these patients we're talking about are below that threshold. In addition, patients have culture positive plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) almost invariably, and that has been cleared in all these patients; that is what we mean by undetectable. Early on, after they are rendered undetectable one can still detect remnants of virus in the lymph nodes, but the question is can we drive these levels below detection at some point, and that remains to be determined. What we do know is that there is not enough replication ongoing at low levels for resistance to emerge. The question is whether the infectious process will ultimately be extinguished.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Montaner</i>--."....we don't know if a patient who is undetectable and remains undetectable for a period of time becomes less infectious. Studies need to be conducted......some of the assumptions are that virus is located in mostly compartments or cells that are going to die off over a relatively short period of time, but you could similarly argue by assuming they are remnants of cell populations that have long half-lifes that remain infected and provide a reservoir of virus that will oblige us to maintain treatment for a long period of time. And, this all has to be tempered by one key issue-- ability of patients to take the treatments that we're proposing; this challenge should not be underestimated. Tuberculosis is a treatable disease with a relatively shorter term of therapy, but for the fact that compliance with taking the prescribed medications is not easy.</p>

<p>"The controlled and randomized trial of AZT/ddI/nevirapine studied 151 drug-naive individuals with CD4 between 200-600 CD4. For the patients randomized to this 3-drug therapy, nearly 80% of the patients, on an intent-to-treat analysis, were able to maintain an undetectable viral load. Upon further analysis, they found that all but one of the patients taking the 3-drug therapy who were able to comply with the regimen had complete suppression of plasma viremia as indicated (for more details, see <a href="nevir.html">Nevirapine article</a>)."</p>

<p><i>Reporter</i>--I'm not hearing anything new. It sounds like what I heard at the Retrovirus meeting in January with some minor updates, so what's the news?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richman</i>--" Nothing regarding complete suppression has been published or, to my knowledge, even accepted for publication. You're right, at the first presentation at the Retrovirus meeting caused a big splash. What we saw here at this meeting was significant extensions of the data with different patient populations including neonates, primary HIV infection, different regimens and discussions with mathematical biologists about modeling study designs and eradication. Dr. Perelson showed the first data regarding the second phase of decay of a different infected cell population. The practical issues of how to take this information and design studies and patient management strategies."....were discussed.... "you're right it's not an unprecedented observation but a lot of additional information was presented and discussed.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Perrin</i>--"Several groups have patients who have been with undetectable viremia for more than 1 year; people are asking themselves what should we do? Should we continue the same way with the same regimen, should we add other regimens, should we stop therapy.......this is a scientific question......everybody is interested and nobody knows what is the answer."</p>

<p><i>Reporter</i>--What do we have to do to get the level of deductibility in PCR down low enough so that we have some greater degree of confidence about the interpretation of the so-called no-detectable level? --and-- What are we going to do to make this "eradication therapy", if we want to use that word, affordable?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richman</i>--"There are laboratory methodologies to get down to 10 copies (RNA) or lower, but some of these lab investigations will require things like lymph node biopsies, which are being done on these patients, and preliminary results are just beginning to come along, and that's an important part of figuring out what's going on. In the long run, additional generation assays whose threshold is lower than the 100 copies will be desirable. In terms of cost, the hope is that the more drugs we have, there will be additional cuts. The fact that Merck undercut the other protease inhibitors for price was positive for all protease inhibitors and all subsequent drugs that come along. Hopefully, the more competition there is in the field, the lower the cost will be.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Perrin</i>--"If 'eradication' is possible, in the end it will be cheaper even if you have to use 4 drugs; if you use them for 4 years and you're cured its going to be much cheaper than what we're doing now."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richman</i>--"There are two reasons for potential optimism, the most optimistic situation would be 'eradication' which would eliminate all subsequent costs once it was instituted. The second is the prospect of the oncologic model where you have induction followed by consolidation or maintenance regimen, so that the complex combinations would be used for a shorter period and then long term management would be with maintenance suppression. Both of these prospects are theoretical, but we can now actually ask the questions and design the studies to investigate them."</p>

<p><i>Reporter</i>-- Given that you can bring down viral load to low levels or not having replication at all, the cells that are infected are still alive, how do you go after them?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Perrin</i>--"That's one of the crucial issues. The cells that are chronically infected and that you don't get to with your drugs, do they die at a certain stage and how long does it take? How long is the half-life. That will determine how long you will have to continue your therapy. There are optimistic and pessimistic predictions."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Montaner</i>--."..Dr. Ho and Dr. Shaw presented evidence that 99% of the virus are produced by actively or positively infected CD4 cells. The half-life of these cells is around two days. Other cells that are infected, for example macrophages--whose half-life we are not sure of; it is the half-life of these cells that will determine the amount of time we'll have to treat patients."</p>

<p><i>Reporter</i>-- Does this mean that you feel there's a possibility that the suppressive drugs alone are enough to achieve eradication, or do you need to couple that with immuno-therapy to go and get that last 1% of long-lived cells?"</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richman</i>--"If HIV is like Herpes, we'll never be able to 'eradicate' the infection. In other words, Herpes infects a type of cell that is life-long, so that we can only suppress Herpes we can't eradicate it. HIV may fall into that category but it may not; and, if it doesn't then its just a matter of potency and duration of therapy. Basically, we're designing experiments to address that."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Montaner</i>-- "For the first time we have the ability to reliably suppress viral replication and your question opens the door for speculation, but all we can say with confidence is that we will continue to watch and monitor these people closely to see what we learn, in terms of to what extent we are able to "eradicate" the virus. Are we bringing it down or is it disappearing, we cannot answer this today."</p>

<p><i>Reporter</i>-- Many studies that have come out over the past few years, for example on AZT which seemed to indicate that the drug had very little value and prompted many patients to not only get off the bandwagon but to denounce the drug as an evil, you're saying that was way pre-mature?"</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richman</i>--"It's analogous to cancer chemotherapy or TB, where any drugs which only had limited activity for a short period of time on their own, are very useful or critical components of combination regimens. It was a big mistake to write off the old drugs.....it was pre-mature and destructive; it was a study design that asked a question which was at that time even obsolete because ddI and ddC were available and the message that it delivered was very destructive to clinical management, public health and drug development."</p>

<p><i>Reporter</i>--"So you're saying all those studies were flawed, the Concord study and others that reached those conclusions?"</p>

<p><i>Dr. Perrin</i>--"At the time the Concord study started, we knew that monotherapy wasn't going to do the job."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Montaner</i>--.".....if you were hoping that one single drug was going to do it, that was wrong. Obviously, we have now proven that was not the right approach. What we're saying is that drugs that cannot do it alone, certainly can do it when you combine them appropriately; and AZT alone cannot do it but if you combine it with another drug or two.....you can arrive at complete viral replication and maintain that for a prolonged period of time."</p>

<p><i>Reporter</i>--"When the time stars to run out for a particular regimen for a person then would you switch them to another combination to keep it going for another 3 years?"</p>

<p><i>Dr. Montaner</i>--"We now have people that are responders to particular regimens of combination therapy, for whom we cannot detect active viral replication and we have no reason to believe that these people are going to fail on that particular combination in the foreseeable future. I cannot rule out the possibility that people can find their combination that works for them and they can remain on that combination for a very prolonged period of time."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richman</i>--"The small subset of patients who have been called long-term non-progressors have low but measurable levels of viral RNA and usually can have virus cultured from their PBMC (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells). We are driving the levels of virus lower than that, so the consequence of being able to suppress virus to these low levels turn patients into long-term non-progressors; so that, if this results in "eradication" and cure that's wonderful; if it doesn't, then we will be talking about managing patients on a chronic basis analogous to hypertension or diabetes... there are two differences between long-term non-progressors and this group; to maintain their viral suppression they have to take drugs......and secondly, when we are treating these patients, they've already sustained some immunological destruction which the long-term non-progressors haven't. How much can be restored when you intervene late is another question that is now able to be investigated properly."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Montaner</i>--"The data suggests that long-term non-progressors will show evidence of progression in the long run."</p>

<p><i>Reporter</i>--"I have not heard you mention the word mortality. It's nice that you can suppress viral load to low levels but the real question is are patients living longer?"</p>

<p><i>Dr. Perrin</i>--.".......there is enough data now that show that suppression of viral replication is buying them survival time."</p>

<p><i>Reporter</i>--"How much more time?"

<p><i>Dr. Richman</i>--"You can't do an experiment for a year and say what's going to happen in 20 years. We're at an early stage in this. If we can sustain it (viral replication) there is no reason to believe HIV will result in the immuno suppression that will kill patients."</p>

<p><i>Reporter</i>--"But as far mortality data, you don't have....."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Perrin</i>--"We have retrospective studies......he looks at the predictive value of viral load......Mellors has found that patients with less than 5,000 copies........they survive longer than patients with higher viremia. By analogy, we are saying if we can push down viremia in patients for a long time it prolongs their survival time."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richman</i>--" Dr. Katzenstein showed data from ACTG 175, which was just combinations of AZT, ddi and ddC, that the clinical benefit including mortality benefit of antiviral therapy could be almost completely explained on the basis of the amount of reduction of RNA that was achieved even with those what we now consider limited regimens. With complete suppression, we have seen no progression of patients who've been on these regimens, but there limited numbers and limited periods of time."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Montaner</i>--.".......in the context of anti-retroviral therapy, we feel confident that, with the use of drugs we are taking about--protease inhibitors, nucleosides, non-nucleosides--the value of dropping the viral load through therapeutic manipulation has now been validated. The data that Dr. Richman is referring to, which is coming not just from 1 study, but from several studies, indicates that the mechanism through which these drugs have an effect on viral replication can be measured by measuring viral load......what is the survival advantage of using three drugs at once and making your viral load negative? The answer can only be speculative at this time because we haven't followed these individuals long enough; but, what we can tell you is that we feel very confident on the basis of the data that we have that this represents a substantial improvement over what we had before; and, if we now have the data that shows that AZT/ddI improves survival over AZT and AZT over no treatment, there is an incremental gain in our opinion by going forward with aggressive strategies to suppress viral replication."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richman</i>--."......what has been observed anecdotally is that some of these patients who have had chronic opportunistic complications like KS or cryptosporidia diarrhea have anecdotally shown some remarkable improvements with the restoration of their CD4 cell counts; but, those are anecdotal and systematic studies to address these are now being designed......as well a research program at Duke University was described at this meeting to look at the ability of thymic transplantation to accelerate immune restoration in these patients, but their initial experience presented was for children with congenital immuno-deficiency and described what they plan to do with HIV patients; there is no data yet but its a study that's in progress."</p>

<p><i>Reporter</i>--"If you say the evidence indicates to "hit hard and early", how early is early? And, should HIV testing become a routine part of everyone's annual check-up?"</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richman</i>--"The most promising effects are seen in primary infection in adults and neo-nates, from everything we know about chemotherapy...........early is best.....everybody should be tested for HIV sero-status and all people who are positive should have their RNA levels ascertained to determine their risk of progression."</p>

<hr size=2 width=50% align=center noshade>

<p>Continuing research is necessary. We cannot become complacent. The theories discussed above must be confirmed with properly designed studies. Basic science research at the NIH must continue to receive proper support and development towards the possibility of discovering restorative therapies for the immune system. A public health menace of non-compliance must receive adequate attention. Good science should dictate. </p>

<h3>PRE-VANCOUVER--PROTEASE INHIBITOR UPDATE: combination &amp; sequential use of protease inhibitors<br>
June 25, 1996</h3>

<blockquote>


<p><i><b>Notice</b>: During Vancouver, daily highlights will be posted to the NATAP web-site to keep you abreast of the breaking events and news; after the Conference, in-depth reports will be available from NATAP on all the important antiretroviral data.</i></p>

<p>After trying to promote research of combination protease inhibitor therapy for a long time, some studies are finally ongoing or being planned. Below is a discussion of the ongoing ritonavir/saquinavir study, from which early data will be presented in Vancouver, and the planned indinavir/saquinavir study. As well, discussed below is ACTG 333, which is the first clinical trial designed to explore protease inhibitor cross-resistance from sequential use. In Vancouver, data will be presented from ongoing pilot trials using protease inhibitor 3-drug combination therapy in populations heretofore not studied with these drugs. Below, this work in progress is previewed.</p>

<p>In Vancouver, additional information will be presented about all of the protease inhibitors listed below.</p>

<p><b>Ritonavir/saquinavir study</b><br>
As you may know, a trial recently began examining the combination of <a href="../../network/simple/saquin.html">saquinavir</a> and <a href="../../network/simple/riton.html">ritonavir</a> in HIV+ individuals. It is the first trial studying the combination of two protease inhibitors. Early data will be presented at the Int'l. Vancouver AIDS Conference in July.</p>

<p>The mechanism by which ritonavir is metabolized via the cytochrome p450 3A4 pathway (in the liver), a pathway common to developed protease inhibitors, has led to the concept that it may effect the overall drug metabolism when administered concomitantly with other drugs. At the 1996 Human Antiretrovirus Conference in January, Abbott presented an abstract (#143) entitled "<a href="http://www.idsociety.org/abst/143.HTM">Coadministration with Ritonavir Enhances the Plasma Levels of HIV Protease Inhibitors by Inhibition of Cytochrome p450</a>," authored by D. Kempf et al. Dr. Kempf said that combination therapy of ritonavir and other peptide-based protease inhibitors is likely to produce a sustained antiviral effect in vivo. Abbott set out to confirm this with the initiation of a study in healthy volunteers, followed by the >ritonavir and saquinavir combination therapy study in HIV-infected individuals, which began in mid-April. </p>

<p>Abbott will be presenting early results (maybe 6 weeks of data) from this study at the Vancouver AIDS Conference in July. NATAP will be covering these and other developments and reporting back to readers again in two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>daily highlights will be posted to <a href="../conf/index.html">www.aidsnyc.org/natap/conf/</a> allowing you to read about news and events on a "real-time" basis; 
<li>following the Conference more detailed reports will be available on the home-page and in printed reports, as part of our ongoing protease inhibitor updates in our booklet entitled--"HIV-1 Protease Inhibitor Report."
</ol>

<p>Dr. Kempf went on to say, the pharmacokinetic enhancement is expected to be more pronounced with protease inhibitors having different resistance profiles. In the preliminary rat studies conducted by Abbott, co-administration of ritonavir produced an enhancement of saquinavir plasma levels by about 29,000% over 8 hours. The following enhancement of other protease inhibitors was also seen with ritonavir over 8 hours: indinavir (about 800%), nelfinavir (about 1,000%) and 141W94--Glaxo Wellcome's protease inhibitor (about 800%).</p>

<p><b>CAUTION</b>. It may be dangerous to experiment with combining protease inhibitors until results are available from trials actually studying the particular combination you may be considering. There are two concerns:</p>

<ol>
<li>the safety concern--incorrect dose combinations may result in dangerous drug levels in your body; 

<li>the efficacy concern--incorrect dose combinations could result in sub-optimal antiviral efficacy and decrease future response to protease inhibitor therapy, including potential future benefit from these combinations.
</ol>

<p>There is insufficient information currently available regarding safe and efficacious dosing combinations of ritonavir with saquinavir or other protease inhibitors; nor is there adequate information for safe and effective dosing regimens of combining <a href="../../network/simple/indi.html">indinavir</a> with saquinavir. For example, increasing the blood levels of indinavir, from combination with ritonavir, could dangerously magnify the potential for side effects and drug interactions associated with indinavir (kidney stones, elevated bilirubin).</p>

<p>In summary, the ritonavir and saquinavir combination study is examining multiple dosing regimens; hopefully, data presented at Vancouver will offer more reliable guidelines for selecting a dose regimen, to those who are anxious to use the combination.</p>

<p><b>Saquinavir and resistance, cross-resistance</b><br>
 The open-label trial of the <a href="../../network/trials/hiv.html#14182">new more potent formulation of saquinavir</a> (soft-gel capsule) was recently initiated. Early results may not be available until the beginning of 1997. However, other important studies involving saquinavir are expected. </p>

<p>As you may know, Roche and Merck have a running difference of opinion about whether or not prior prolonged treatment with saquinavir will cause any measure of significant cross-resistance to subsequent treatment with indinavir. After prolonged discourse, ACTG 333 will begin to explore this controversy in a clinical trial. There is in vitro evidence that cross-resistance occurs among protease inhibitors (Nature 1995:374:569-571, Condra et al); while such resistance is demonstrable in vitro, there have been no clinical trials examining anti-retroviral activity with the sequential use of protease inhibitors or whether saquinavir resistance can be overcome with higher concentrations of saquinavir or with indinavir (research moves too slowly!). </p>

<p>In ACTG 333, individuals with greater than 1 year experience with saquinavir (currently approved hard capsule formulation) will receive indinavir or the new more potent saquinavir formulation. The 24-week randomized and open-label trial, of 144 study subjects, will study virological, immunological (CD4 and CD8) and safety concerns; and, will use the RT-PCR viral load test to determine if individuals have decreases in HIV RNA plasma levels, after substitution of therapy with indinavir or the new formulation saquinavir soft-gel capsule. "Subjects will continue on their same non-protease anti-HIV drugs, if on any therapy, and need to be on an unchanged anti-HIV regimen for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry."</p>

<p>Virology studies will explore resistance, cross-resistance and the "disconnect" between CD4 and RNA observed in ACTG 229, where some subjects had either increases or decreases in both RNA and CD4, rather than the expected inverse relationship where one goes up and the other down. Baseline protease mutations and subsequent patterns will be analyzed and compared to changes in RNA, and CD4 and CD8; SI phenotype will be explored and analyzed in comparison with changes in RNA and CD4. </p>

<p>If individuals are unresponsive to the treatment to which they've been randomized, a mechanism for crossover has been established after 8 weeks from initiation of therapy at the start of the study. Subjects randomized to continue on the old formulation of saquinavir will remain on that therapy for 8 weeks before switching to indinavir.</p>

<p><b>Potpourri</b><br>
 Marty Markowitz and David Ho, of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, are conducting ongoing small pilot studies of treatment intervention with 3-drug combinations (including 1 protease) in groups of individuals never studied before with these regimens:</p>

<ol>
<li>two trials are studying individuals who sero-converted just prior to 
the initiation of therapy; one of these two trials is treating individuals with AZT/3TC and indinavir; the other is treating individuals with AZT/3TC and ritonavir; and
<li>another trial is studying the treatment of drug-naive individuals with AZT/3TC and nelfinavir (Agouron's protease). 

</ol>

<p>The early results are promising and are part of the reason some AIDS researchers are discussing "a new paradigm" in AIDS treatment, i.e. a new approach of when to initiate treatment and how to do it (see the NATAP report from "<a href="erad.html">The HIV Eradication Talks</a>"). Data from these studies will be presented in Vancouver, but it is preliminary and early data from pilot studies. Properly designed follow-up studies need to be implemented to explore and confirm the hypothesis coming out of this story.</p>

<p>Abbott has a new protease inhibitor called ABT-378. It is supposed to enter initial human trials this summer. This inhibitor holds forth the promise of having a unique mutation profile.</p>

<p><b>Indinavir/saquinavir</b><br>
 Merck will initiate the exploration of combination therapy with indinavir and the new formulation of saquinavir, by first evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs. Following the satisfactory results of that study, a trial will be initiated evaluating the safety and antiviral activity of the combination of the two drugs. Merck is estimating this trial to will begin late 1996.</p>

<p><b>Nelfinavir</b><br>
 Agouron's protease entered the pivotol phase III clinical phase several months ago, wherein 700 individuals will be recruited to their studies; up til now about 100 individuals has been treated and studied with nelfinavir. An <a href="vct.html">extensive 5-page report</a> on safety, efficacy, drug interactions, their planned women's study, pediatric plans, expanded access, and other related information about nelfinavir is available.</p>

<p><b>141W94 (aka VX-478)</b><br>
This protease inhibitor was discovered by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and is being developed by Glaxo Wellcome (GW). At the Ninth International Conference on Antiviral Research (ICAR) held in May in Japan, some early clinical data were presented for 141W94. The Phase I/II trial evaluated tolerability, pharmacokinetics and initial antiviral activity during 28 days of treatment for 4 doses 300 mg BID (2X/day), 300 mg TID (3X/day), 900 mg BID and 1200 mg BID. The presentation at ISAR is a preliminary report of the first group of 10 subjects treated at the 300 mg BID dose. GW reported encouraging pharmacokinetics at the 300 mg BID dose over the 28-day treatment period. The average steady state concentration of blood levels at trough (just prior to the next dose) was in excess of the plasma-corrected in vitro IC-90 (The IC-90 is the concentration of drug that eliminates 90% of HIV replication in vitro and is a standard parameter for measurement). Average steady state concentrations at peak were more than 30-times the plasma corrected IC-90. The average half-life was approximately 9 hours. Additionally, it was reported there was no statistically significant alteration of drug levels when administered with food.</p>

<p>Following assessment of all four dosing regimens, it is expected that GW will present the data on tolerability and anti-HIV efficacy. Additional Phase II studies of VX-478 in combination with other drugs are being planned now. </p>

<p><b>Upjohn and Pharmacia</b><br>
This company is developing its third generation protease inhibitor, which they say has a unique mutation profile, possibly making it a good candidate for sequential and/or combinatorial use with other protease inhibitors. They are currently conducting animal studies and expect to enter human trials by the end of 1996. More information will be presented at Vancouver.</p>

<p>With the development of nelfinavir and 141W94 moving along, both Agouron and GW need to address researching the potential for combining their protease inhibitors with others; as well, all the protease manufacturers need to address the issues of resistance and cross-resistance as they relate to sequential use of inhibitors(see "<a href="combo.html">Combination Protease Inhibitors Studies</a>").</p>

<title>NATAP: Viracept (nelfinavir, aka AG-1343): Agouron's protease inhibitor</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<a href="index.html"><h4 align=center>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3>Viracept (nelfinavir, aka AG-1343): Agouron's protease inhibitor <br>June 14, 1996</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>I'm now writing to you from the airplane, having just left San Diego and a community meeting with Agouron Pharmaceuticals, where a diverse group of community representatives gathered to address common concerns.</p>

<p>The day started with talks from Agouron's CEO and a few of their scientists involved in the protease inhibitor discovery project. Their CEO, Peter Johnson, talked about the company's development and his commitment to AIDS. Agouron is only about 11 years in existence. It is a small company compared to the large pharmaceutical companies with which it's competing in the protease inhibitor market. It was started to utilize new technology of drug design and development. The new technology utilized by Agouron is x-ray crystallography, which is used to identify the structure of a "target" for a drug, such as the HIV-1 protease enzyme, and then help design the structure of a drug, that may optimize its "fit" for that "target."</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson said their concept of "rational protein based structural design" was not initially well received when he visited large pharmaceutical company's looking for interest in the early days after the company's inception; but now, of their 360 total employees, Agouron has 150 employees (85 devoted just to HIV) devoted solely to this concept of structure based drug design, and Johnson said it is the largest group working together of any in the world; and, he said, they have the largest database of how drugs interact with targets; Agouron has a cancer drug designed by the same method that is also in late stages of development. But, Nelfinavir is expected to be Agouron's first product to be marketed. </p>

<p>Of importance to the AIDS community, Agouron announced at the meeting that they have recently completed their identification of the structure of <a href="../network/simple/cmv.html">CMV</a>, and now they will be trying to develop a CMV drug. They are also working on identifying the structure of the Hepatitis C virus, again for the purpose of developing a sorely needed treatment; currently, <a href="../network/access/drugs/alph.html">interferon</a> is the only approved treatment for Hepatitis C, but it isn't very effective.</p>

<p>We reviewed their data on safety, efficacy and resistance for Viracept; and discussed pediatrics, a women's study, expanded access and drug interactions; all of which are discussed below. They began recruiting for their phase III studies in January 1996. Prior to that, about 100 people had been treated with Viracept in phases I &amp; II. Until data is available from the phase III studies, which won't be til about November, the data currently available and discussed below is preliminary; as you will see, it is based on a small number of study participants who have been followed for only 3-4 months. Viracept(VCT) is a non-peptidic <a href="../network/simple/protease.html">protease inhibitor</a> which has displayed between 20-80% bio-availability, in a variety of animals. In the rat, there is CNF penetration at therapeutic levels. Agouron reports synergistic interactions in vitro were detected with nelfinavir and either <a href="../network/simple/zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="../network/simple/zalc.html">ddC</a>, <a href="../network/simple/three.html">3TC</a> or the <a href="../network/simple/combo.html">combination</a> of AZT/3TC. Additive interactions were detected with <a href="../network/simple/dida.html">ddI</a> or <a href="../network/simple/stav.html">d4T</a>.</p> 

<P><b>EFFICACY</b><br>
Protocol #503 studied nelfinavir monotherapy (without any other drugs) in 30 drug-naive and experienced (protease inhibitor naive) HIV positive individuals with CD4 greater than 200 and viral RNA greater than 20,000, in three dosing regimens: 500, 750 and 1000 mg. 3X/day (TID).</p>

<pre><font size=3>
Mean Baseline RNA and CD4--

	500 mg TID	750 mg TID	1000 mg TID
	--------------	--------------	----------------
RNA	57,021		106,094		67,495
CD4	363		381		331

Number of Patients at Each Dose Regimen

------		------	------	------	------

750 mg TID	10	10	9	10
1000 mg TID	10	9	9	7
total		<b>30	26	25	22</b>
</font></pre>

<p>At 4 months, the RNA reductions from baseline were:</p>
<ul>
<li>500 mg group :  0.7
<li>750 mg group : 1.5
<li>1000 mg group : 2.2
</ul>

<p>At 4 months the CD4 increases were:</p>

<ul>
<li>500 mg group : 165
<li>750 mg group : 140
<li>1000 mg group : 115
</ul>

<p>Although based on a small number of individuals for only 4 months, the RNA and CD4 improvements are promising. For phase III studies, the 500 &amp; 750 mg TID dosing regimens were chosen for study, but not the 1000 mg dose regimen. Following, you will see data examining these same 3 doses in a combination study of Viracept and d4T where the improvements, in CD4 and RNA from both the 750 &amp; 1000 mg dose regimens, were similar. Agouron has decided not to study the 1000 mg dose in their phase III trials, saying that the efficacy appears to be equal but, because of the higher incidence of side effects in the 1000 mg dose, they chose only to study the 500 &amp; 750 mg dose regimens in phase III. However, in the #503 monotherapy study the 1000 mg dose produced a more pronounced decline in RNA at 4 mos.(2.2 log vs. 1.5). </p>

<p>Choosing a dose regimen can be complicated. At 1000 mg, <a href="../network/simple/indi.html">indinavir</a> displayed a higher incidence of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), but efficacy may have appeared to be slightly better than the dose chosen and currently recommended, of 800 mg 3x/day; it was a difficult choice when Merck faced the decision between 800 TID or 1000 TID, but they also chose the safer dose. The side effects of <a href="../network/simple/riton.html">ritonavir</a> can be problematic at the recommended dose, 600 mg 3X/day, without raising it any higher. The combination trial currently ongoing, which is studying saquinavir+ritonavir is utilizing two different doses of ritonavir (600 mg 2X/day and 400 mg 2X/day) in combination with a variety of <a href="../network/simple/saquin.html">saquinavir</a> dosing regimens (all are 2X/day regimens).</p> 

<p>However, the currently recommended dose of saquinavir is 600 mg 3X/day, and its side effect profile is more benign than both ritonavir and indinavir. But its bio-availability is low (4%), which may limit its potency; therefore, some individuals are compensating by taking higher doses of saquinavir than the recommended dose regimen. A more potent and bio-available new formulation is currently in a trial, from which Roche hopes to obtain FDA approval for this new more potent formulation; however, it will not be until 1997, before the FDA reviews the trial results, as it just recently started. Incidentally, Abbott is expected to soon begin human trials for its new protease inhibitor, ABT-378, which may be superior to ritonavir.</p>

<p><b>Safety at 4 months</b><br>
Diarrhea incidence was 10% at 4 mos. for the 500 &amp; 750 mg group, but 20% for the 1000 mg group. Asthenia incidence was 10% at 4 mos, but only in the 1000 mg group. Headaches at 10% only in the 750 mg group. The company defines diarrhea as greater than or equal to grade 2 (moderate) in severity. They have characterized this side effect as consisting mostly of more frequent bowel movements per day, and looser bowel movements.</p>

<p><b>Protocol #510: Viracept and d4T</b><br>
40 (10 per study arm) treatment-experienced (d4T &amp; protease inhibitor naive) and -naive individuals, without prior protease inhibitor experience, were studied; baseline values: CD4 greater than 200; HIV RNA greater than 15,000.

<pre><font size=3>

500 mg		+75		+105
750 mg		+110		+135

</font></pre>

<p>As you can see, there is no discernable difference between 750 and 1000 mg in this study, as measured by RNA &amp; CD4; however, the community suggested that further out in study time a measurable difference might develop, that 2 months of data was too little by which to make such a decision. It is my understanding that the data at 3 months sustains these CD4 and RNA improvements, although it hasn't been publicly disclosed.</p>

<p><b>Safety</b></p>
<pre><font size=3>

Rash		-	-		10%		-
</font></pre>

<p>However, Agouron claims the incidence and severity of diarrhea declines by 3-4 months.</p>

<p><b>PHASE II/III STUDIES</b><br>
The following studies are enrolled except for protocol #525, which will be enrolling shortly. #525 is a unique trial comparing individuals who will be randomized to either nelfinavir added to their current therapy vs. nelfinavir added to newly started other therapy. All participants will be receiving nelfinavir open label; this trial will examine the notion that starting new drugs or therapy along with the initiation of a protease inhibitor is preferable to simply adding a protease to current therapy.</p>

<p><i>(<b>Ed. note</b>: <a href="../network/trials/hiv.html">currently enrolling anti-HIV trials</a>, including trials studying nelfinavir and other protease inhibitors)</i></p>

<p>Clinical endpoint studies are in design. Under consideration is ritonavir vs. nelfinavir, and/or indinavir vs. nelfinavir; individuals would be randomized to either protease inhibitor and be permitted to take other approved therapy of their choice, probably except for other protease inhibitors.</p>

<P><b>Cross-resistance</b><br>
Agouron officials said, they believe nelfinavir may have less potential to cause the magnitude of cross-resistance that other inhibitors may cause, but this will need confirmation. The in vitro mutation profile they have published (Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Feb 1996, p 292-297) appears to be less extensive. But this mutation profile is not based on clinical isolates (from blood taken from individuals administered nelfinavir). They are, however, working on clinical isolates now, and will soon have information to reveal.</p>

<p><b>Expanded access</b><br>
With the recent approval and availability of 3 protease inhibitors, the context of expanded access is changing. When we pressured Merck and Abbott to offer expanded access, there were very limited options to access protease inhibitors. How do we now approach expanded access for the 4th protease inhibitor? The creation of a new model for protease inhibitor expanded access programs was suggested, whereby unique criteria might be utilized to qualify individuals for the program. The original purpose of expanded access was to offer drug to individuals who did not qualify for trials and who had few, if any, remaining treatment options. Within this context a new model might emerge.</p>

<p><b>Pediatrics</b><br>
A pediatric suspension has been developed. An initial pharmacokinetics study is being planned to start soon.</p>

<p><b>Women's study</b><br>
Agouron is planning an open-label study for about 36 women to gather data on nelfinavir's effect on HIV related gynecological health concerns. </p>

<P><b>Drug interactions</b><br>
Interaction studies are ongoing. They are about to expand these studies to include more drugs including those representative of classes of drugs most used for HIV that may have potential interactions with protease inhibitors because of their metabolism through the same hepatic (<a href="../pwahg/info/liver.html">liver</a>) pathway. However, Agouron officials said, they believe nelfinavir will have less potential for drug interactions than some of the other protease inhibitors. This also needs confirmation. </p>

<p>Merck, Abbott and Roche recommend that terfenadine not be co- administered with their protease inhibitors; plasma from at least two subjects in a study of terfenadine (Seldane) contained measureable levels of terfenadine in the presence of nelfinavir; however, Agouron is recommending alternative therapy (nonsedating antihistamines) that have not been associated with cardiovascular complications (e.g. loratadine). </p>

<p><a href="../network/access/drugs/rifam.html">Rifampin</a>, a potent inducer of p450 metabolism, appeared to have substantially lowered nelfinavir trough levels in 12 subjects. Complete pharmacokinetic profiles for the study are not yet available; but, because of the pronounced changes in nelfinavir trough levels, Agouron is cautioning study investigators against concomitant use of rifampin with nelfinavir.</p>

<p>Agouron is planning to conduct a study of <a href="../network/access/drugs/rifa.html">rifabutin</a> which has similar, but generally less potent p450 inducing powers as rifampin. Alternative <a href="../network/simple/mac.html">MAI</a> prophylaxis regimens are suggested until results of the rifabutin study are known.</p>

<p>Preliminary trough level measurements suggest that only minor increases in nelfinavir concentrations may occur during treatment with <a href="../network/access/drugs/keto.html">ketoconazole</a>. Based on these preliminary results, dose modification should not be required.</p>

<p>Preliminary study in animals find that <a href="../network/simple/saquin.html">saquinavir</a> blood levels increase 2-3 fold when combined with nelfinavir.</p>

<p>At the <a href="../network/simple/nevi.html">nevirapine</a> FDA hearing last week, concerns were raised about nevirapine's interactions with protease inhibitors. Boehringer Ingelheim, the developer of nevirapine listed <a href="../network/simple/indi.html">indinavir</a>, <a href="../network/simple/riton.html">ritonavir</a>, <a href="../network/simple/saquin.html">saquinavir</a>-- but not nelfinavir-- as the drugs they will study for potential interaction.</p>

<p>Recently, all the protease inhibitor developers have been discussing studying further the combination of two protease inhibitors in one therapy. The by now famous <a href="../network/trials/hiv.html#ampro">ritonavir-saquinavir study</a> is the first to explore this concept. Soon, it is expected that Merck will start initial studies of indinavir in combination with the new more <a href="../network/trials/hiv.html#14182">potent formulation of saquinavir</a>. The combination of nelfinavir/saquinavir needs to be studied. Agouron said this issue is under consideration. As well, Glaxo Wellcome says they are discussing the initiation of studying their protease inhibitor in combination with other protease inhibitors; but these concerns need to be monitored, because it is important that these studies start as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Life or Death: ADAP 6/18/96</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>In this difficult time of budgetary constraints, the AIDS health epidemic unrelentingly continues in spite of fiscal concerns. Unfortunately, many of our fellow Americans are unable to fully appreciate the extent of the death and hardship resulting from this crisis, because of misunderstandings about the nature of the problem and personal prejudices about the types of people they think are affected. Make no mistake about it, AIDS is a problem for every American regardless of whether or not they think it affects them.</p>

<p>Increasingly, many people have friends, acquaintances, and family members who have been afflicted with AIDS. Many of these people understand and sympathize with the suffering of having AIDS. However, there are people, who whether or not they know someone with AIDS, refuse to recognize the problem and the dire need for help. Although frequently, when someone in their family or otherwise close to them contracts HIV or AIDS, they are better able to develop an appreciation for the disease.</p>

<p>If an individual doesn't have compassion and understanding for the suffering, maybe they are able to appreciate the economic aspects of this disease. Because many people with AIDS are already or may soon become debilitated, they are unable to work at jobs. Without financial resources they are increasingly over time (as the disease progresses) at the mercy of government programs and private insurers for access to necessary treatments and basic services for living. Because of financial constraints many people with HIV/AIDS are without housing or need assistance in obtaining housing. It is unique to AIDS, that a large portion of those suffering with this disease are homeless. We have government and private programs to help with this problem. Many individuals need basic services to survive--medical care, home care, assistance in obtaining food. Without government and private programs of compassion, God knows what might happen to these individuals.</p>

<p>An emergency situation has arisen. Finally, after 15 years of suffering with a lack of adequate treatment for HIV, we now have a major new development in therapy for HIV, that we expect will make a major contribution to people with HIV/AIDS being healthier, living longer and if we really get lucky this disease could become a chronic manageable problem. With the development of the new class of drugs called <a href="../../network/simple/protease.html">protease inhibitors</a> for the treatment of HIV, we now have the greatest case of hope we have had in 15 years. Along with previously developed drugs and those that hopefully will come along in the future, protease inhibitors as the cornerstone of therapy, offer promise for turning this killer disease into a chronic manageable disease.</p>

<p>Of course, nothing comes easy. These drugs are difficult and expensive to manufacture. They cost 2-3 times as much as previously developed drugs for HIV, but they are the most potent HIV treatments yet developed. Unfortunately, they are expensive to buy and they came along when federal and private budgets are being crunched. For those who are subsidized by government programs for healthcare and drugs, they depend on these programs to obtain their life-sustaining HIV treatments. Medicaid and private insurers are in the process of arranging for reimbursement for their clients for the FDA approved protease inhibitors. Although, we are not yet certain there won't be some hitches in trying to resolve that, there is a group of individuals that is falling through the cracks. People who do not qualify for Medicaid because they may work, or people who work but do not have private insurance, receive their life-sustaining and expensive drugs through a national program called the Ryan White Care Act-Title II ADAP (AIDS Drug Assistance Program). Each state independently runs their own program with major funding from the federal government. Very few of the 51 state ADAP programs in the entire USA are currently covering protease inhibitors for their clients, because they are experiencing their own fiscal crisis. In fact, a quick review of the drugs for which the states supply reimbursement, reveals that many of these states have grossly inadequate lists of drugs. Individuals in some states have very few important drugs that their ADAP program is willing to supply or cover; while, in a few states like NY and California, the ADAP programs provide more humane coverage.</p>

<i>(<b>Ed. note</b>: <a href="../../network/access/states/ny/ny.html">New York</a> and <a href="../../network/access/states/nj/nj.html">New Jersey</a> ADAP programs)</i>

<p>Without access to protease inhibitors, many people with AIDS will get sick sooner, become debilitated and unemployable sooner, and will die quicker; and, will be an expensive burden to all American taxpayers for their health and living costs and because their lack of contribution to our economy will create a bigger drain than already exists from AIDS. If these and all others have the opportunity to access these drugs, there is the promise that many individuals won't get sicker but will retain their health, that many who are sick now may recover, that some who haven't been working may return to work, that some who are working may continue to work, and possibly with a little bit of luck and elbow grease we may figure out how to turn AIDS into a manageable disease, in which case many more people could live longer healthier lives and be contributors to society.</p>

<p>The humane thing for our society to do is to make sure these people can access these potentially life-sustaining drugs; it is un-American not to guarantee this to them; and, it is cost-effective to assure access. Anecdotal reports are already emerging, that since the approval and availability of protease inhibitors, there has been a reduction in the incidence of other costly medical services. If people are getting healthier, there need for medical services is reduced.</p>

<p>The ADAP Future Funding Working Group is a coalition of AIDS community organizations, ADAP representatives and the pharmaceutical industry. They are committed to advocating for adequate funding for the ADAP section of the Ryan White Care Act, and to advocate for adequate resources for all Titles or sections of the Ryan White Care Act, as critical to supporting the services infrastructure which provides ADAP information and access, as well as other vital services to all individuals with HIV/AIDS.</p>

<p>The ADAP Working Group is directly responsible for the Clinton Administration and Congress approving of an emergency supply of funding to support better access to drugs for ADAP clients. They negotiated and lobbied to obtain a supplemental grant of $52 million from the federal government for state ADAP programs to assist in trying to provide more and better drugs, including protease inhibitors. This supplemental grant was only an emergency grant for fiscal year 1996. Its distribution has been delayed until now because Congressional approval of the budget was delayed. </p>

<p>Experts have been crunching numbers and have concluded that the fiscal needs for FY 1997, in order to meet the increasing demand for ADAP clients to access protease inhibitors, will be an additional $195 million. There were over 60,000 ADAP clients throughout the USA in 1995, but the number is sure to increase.</p>

<p>We need your support in this effort to provide life-sustaining drugs, including protease inhibitors, to people to prevent them from getting sick and from dying. The Clinton Administration and Congress need to know that voters and their constituents support and in fact insist that our politicians, who've been entrusted with the public's welfare, answer these vital needs, by supplying adequate funding for the state ADAP programs to be able to supply adequate access to their clients of life saving drugs for people suffering with HIV or AIDS.</p>

<p>Please call your Congressional representatives and your Senators, to support these efforts. In fact, in my visits to Senate offices, I have learned that these officials will be responsive to demands from their constituents, but they must hear from you in order to know what you want.</p>

<title>NATAP: VIRAL LOAD (HIV RNA): IMPORTANT INFORMATION</title>

<h3>VIRAL LOAD (HIV RNA): IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h3>
<ul>
<b><li>a comprehensive discussion of data, how to use tests and interpret results
<li>RNA correlation with progression 
<li>a discussion of when to initiate protease inhibitor therapy 
</b></ul>

<blockquote>

<p>We are entering a new era for treatment of HIV because of the development of the new class of drugs called protease inhibitors and secondly because of the development of the new technology called viral load testing. On June 5, the FDA granted approval to Roche Diagnostics for their viral load test, Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor test, more commonly known as RT-PCR, viral load or HIV RNA PCR.</p>

<p>It is the first test approved by the FDA. Within the last few days, two important articles were published about viral load; key information from these articles are addressed here.</p>

<p>One of the two article presents important data from the Pittsburgh portion of MACS (Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study)--"Prognosis in HIV-1 Infection Predicted by the Quantity of Virus in Plasma" (John Mellors et al); it discusses the correlation between baseline viral load after HIV seroconversion and clinical progression (prognosis)--results say clinical progression can be predicted. The second article--"HIV Viral Load markers in clinical practice" (Mike Saag et al), discusses the recommended guidelines for using viral load tests by the USA advisory panel to the International AIDS Society (IAS).</p>

<p>First is a reproduction (transcription) of a presentation by Dr. Robert Coombs on viral load: data related to using viral load measures and its correlation to clinical progression (prognosis); how to properly use the tests and interpret their results; his comments on the IAS recommended guidelines. Dr. Coombs' talk was presented at the National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project community treatment forum called: "Protease Inhibitors and Viral Load: Current and Future Use". It took place in Los Angeles on April 13, 1996. Videotapes are available of the entire 4-hour forum by contacting NATAP.</p>

<P>Also available, is NATAP's 46-page bound booklet--"HIV Protease Inhibitors Report-2nd edition", a comprehensive compilation of available data and information for 5 protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>The quantitation of plasma viral RNA (commonly referred to as viral load) has provided valuable insights into the pathogenesis of HIV disease and activity of antiviral drugs, including protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>We need to define more clearly the correlates between plasma viral RNA, antiretroviral activity and clinical outcome or efficacy of a therapy. There is some missing information, which will be reviewed today, that we need to better understand the use and interpretation of viral load measurements.</p>

<p>Plasma RNA measurements will have an important role in the clinical treatment decisions doctors and other health providers will be making with HIV infected individuals.</p>

<p>Today, I will give some background and recommendations that are designed to give you some guidelines and guidance to understanding the use and interpretation of viral load measurements.</p>

<p>The following considerations will be addressed today:</p>

<ul>
<li>what does an HIV-1 RNA level mean? 
<li>what constitutes a meaningful change in HIV-1 RNA level?
<li>do changes in HIV-1 RNA level have the same clinical meaning for persons with high compared to those with low HIV-1 RNA levels?
<li>what are the cost-to-benefit considerations in driving the virus load to "as low as possible?"
</ul>

<p>Without going into much detail about the technologies involved, there are two current approaches to measuring viral RNA: -branched DNA (bDNA) assay, which is based on a signal amplification technology; -the other technology is based on the reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR), the NASBA or QC-PCR assays (quantitative competitive PCR); the first two are commercially available and the QC-PCR is a research test; they share a common methodology of amplifying the viral target.</p>

<p><b>An important principle</b> in this disease is that individuals who become HIV-infected establish an equilibrium between their host immune system and their virus within the first 6 to 12 months of infection. Dr. Coombs described three different groups characterized by the course of the progression of their disease, into one of these three which individuals may fall. Each of the 3 groups was represented on a graph (displayed by Dr. Coombs) depicting the course of that group's progression to AIDS. In the first group, individuals contain the virus effectively, have very low viral load levels (the equilibrium setting their viral load level at well under 10,000 RNA copies within the first 6 to 12 months of infection), and the graphic depiction of the course of their viral load measurements may remain very flat over the course of many years, possibly extending 10 years, and defines a slow-progressing group of patients. The second group does not contain the virus very well and are characterized by having very high viral load levels (100,000 or higher) within the first 6 to 12 months of infection, and they progress very rapidly to an AIDS defining illness. The graph (used by Dr. Coombs) depicts this group as developing AIDS defining illnesses as early as three years after HIV-infection. The third group is in between, with between about 10,000 to 100,000 RNA copies, that has an intermediate progression rate. The graph line depicting this group slowly ascends from the 6-12 month post sero-conversion period to 7 or 8 years out and depicts this intermediate rate of progression of the disease. As you can see, not all patients start off with low levels and progress to high levels as the disease progresses.</p>

<p>If you take a patient's viral load measure at any point along the line of the course of their disease to assess their risk of progression, and if you lower their RNA measure with therapy--- the question that is not yet answered is---if you lower that RNA level to say 10,000 do you indeed alter the course of their disease progression? We don't yet know the answer to this question, but we surmise that will occur, i.e. that lowering of viral measure will alter the clinical course of the individual's disease--delay progression and prolong life. The FDA's very recent approval of the RT-PCR test is for prognosis. In order to approve the tests for "monitoring clinical therapy", they want a study(s) that examines individuals who make therapy changes vs. those who don't make therapy changes, based on viral load increases. The studies described below do not examine this question, but they study prognosis. However, many doctors and people with HIV/AIDS are using the tests for "monitoring clinical therapy', despite the FDA's limited approval. The FDA stated, in their approval language for the RT-PCR test, --"the test has also been used as an aid in assessing viral response to antiretroviral treatment as measured by changes in HIV-1 RNA levels."</p>

<p>A few published papers in the last year or so highlight Dr. Coombs' principle. Following is data from a Mellors paper published in the Annals of Internal Medicine 1995; 122: 573-579, that looks at individuals in the Pittsburgh portion of the MACS group.</p>

<p><b>Viral load measures just after seroconversion predict disease progression.</b> The bDNA assay was used for this study. When the analysis was done, only the 1st generation bDNA assay, which measures only as low as 10,000 copies was available. Therefore, the plasma negative group are those individuals that had below 10,000 copies and the plasma positive group is those that had above 10,000 RNA copies. Since this analysis was completed, the 2nd generation bDNA test has become available, which measures as low as 500 copies; and, by looking at additional data, using the more sensitive assay, similar conclusions have been reached (discussed later in this article), that define a lower limit, of 20-30,000 RNA copies, that may indicate a more rapid progression. Baseline RNA measures were those obtained shortly after seroconversion.</p>

<pre><font size=3>
<b>Proportion of Patients Developing AIDS</b>
		Plasma Neg.		Plasma Pos. 
CD4 Count 	for HIV-1 RNA		for HIV-1 RNA
at Seroconv.	year	year		year	year
Cells/mm-3	0-1	0-2		0-1	0-2
* &gt;500		11%	6%		33%	45%
* &lt;500		25%	0% 		56%	86%
</font></pre>

<p>Individuals who had below or above 500 CD4, and had either no virus detected in their plasma (plasma neg.) by the bDNA assay (meaning below 10,000) or who had consistently greater than 10,000 copies (plasma pos.), had very different progression rates to the development of AIDS. Individuals who consistently had less than 10,000 RNA copies had very low rates (6% and 0%) and individuals consistently above 10,000 had very high rates of progression and these differences were significant. In fact, this study showed, that using the bDNA assay, individuals with more than 100,000 had a 10 times greater risk of developing AIDS within the next 5 years, than those individuals with under 10,000 copies; and, importantly these conclusions are independent of the CD4 count; that is, whether your CD4 was below or above 500, the rates of progression between the two groups (plasma pos. & plasma neg.) were significantly different.</p>

<p><b>Variability of viral load measurements.</b> Dr. Coombs displayed a graph showing only one individual's variability in RNA measures over the course of one week. Although anecdotal, it is intended to illustrate a point. This person's RNA was measured three times (morning, noon, and night) on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and the following Monday. There was a good amount of variability in the scores, both within given days and between different days. (These measures are approx.) On the 1st Monday, the measures were 25,000, 28,000 and 37,000; on Wednesday: 35,000, 37,000 and 35,000; on Friday-- 40,000, 47,000 and 84,000; on the last Monday-- 50,000, 57,000, 65,000, 67,000 and 71,000. There are rises of 2 to 3 fold, all within 1 week. The first measure (25,000) on Monday is more than 3-fold less than the high measure on Friday (84,000).</p>

<p>There are two points, Dr. Coombs is trying to illustrate. (1) There is variability within individual measurements of the virus. It is generally believed that the biological variability is 3-fold (or 0.5 log). This needs to be taken into consideration when sequentially assessing a patient's RNA measures; (2) Various factors perturb virus level: we are learning that concurrent infection, immunizations, and unexplained events can cause the virus load to jump quite dramatically 2, 3 or more fold. For example, reactivation of genital herpes by itself, which can be clinically innocuous, can result in a significant short-term rise in viral load.</p>

<p>So, a doctor and the patient need to understand there is variability in measurement and generally it is considered that a 3-fold difference in measures falls with the window of variability we may expect to see.</p>

<p><b>Commentary</b>: If a 3-fold change is sustained repeatedly over time, that difference may not be merely a variability, but may reflect a real change in viral load.</p>

<p><b>Clinical progression correlates with viral load.</b> An important study you may have heard about is AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 175. Dr. Coombs uses some data from this study to illustrate some points about viral RNA that he thinks are important. This study was chosen, to make his points, simply because the plasma was collected specifically for RNA measurement. That is, the proper anti-coagulant was chosen, specimens were processed in a very fixed time period and stored appropriately.</p>

<p>In this study, the RNA was measured by the RT-PCR assay. Many of the natural history studies and other studies that have been published use different RNA detection technologies; and, the retrospective studies usually deal with plasma banks that were not initially designed to measure RNA in. Therefore, trying to define what the absolute RNA level is, can be very difficult in these retrospective studies. Furthermore, the different assays have been run without a common standard, and that makes comparison between one assay type and another problematic. For the management of patients, I think we want to get down to the issue of what is the absolute RNA level in the patient and how does that correlate with their overall immune status. It's much more difficult to manage patients based on relative levels of virus, but at the moment we are sort of in the position of having to do that. </p>

<p>[<b>Commentary:</b> There are many factors affecting the accuracy and reliability of RNA test results, and we have not yet been able to adequately understand how each of these factors may affect a measure or series of measures.]</p>

<p>ACTG 175 was randomized, double blinded, and involving 2,467 individuals, who were randomized to either AZT, ddI, AZT/ddI, or AZT/ddC. A cohort of 400 individuals from this study had a very detailed virological analysis done: antiretroviral naive 55%, asymptomatic 85%, symptomatic 15%. The mean CD4 count of 343 was relatively high. Plasma was collected and stored specifically for RT-PCR assessment.</p>

<p>Dr. Coombs showed a graph of unpublished data that's been presented at meetings by Dr. David Katzenstein, that shows the relationship between the percent of progression to clinical endpoints and baseline RNA levels {baseline means that the RNA measure was before receiving study drug(s)}. The endpoints are divided into three groups: the complete clinical endpoint, which is the combination of a 50% decline in CD4 count, the development of AIDS, or death; the 2nd group is AIDS or death; and the 3rd group is just AIDS alone. The progression to these endpoints for each of these 3 groups is compared between 4 different categories of baseline RNA ranges of measures. The first RNA group is those individuals with under 5,000 RNA copies; the second group is individuals between 5,000 and 19,000 copies; the third group is composed of individuals with between 19,000 RNA copies and 54,000; and the fourth group represents those with greater than 54,000 copies. </p>

<p>Those with over 54,000 RNA copies had, by far, the highest progression rates (prognosis), for each of the three clinical endpoint groups: the three markers; or progression to AIDS and death; or just death. Individuals with 19,000 to 54,000 RT-PCR copies had the next highest progression rate, in each of the 3 endpoint groups. Individuals with under 19,000 copies progressed the most slowly in each of the 3 endpoint groups; essentially, those from both groups, under 5,000 and 5,000 to 19,000, were quite similar in their rates of progression, as their was no significant difference. Clearly, in this study, disease is being driven by the people with the higher viral loads, more so with individuals with more than 54,000 copies, but also inclusive of those with more than 20,000 copies.</p>

<p><b>A 2 log drop is not the same for everyone.</b> The issue of relative changes is important. Dr. Coombs displayed a chart of 3 RNA measures: 1,000,000, 100,000 and 10,000. If each had a 2-log reduction in viral load, the 1 million would be reduced to 10,000---the 100,000 would be reduced to 1,000 and the 10,000 would be reduced to 100. The question to us--is the clinical benefit of driving the viral load down 2 logs, the same for those with each of these different measures? Biologically and intuitively, you can surmise that those with the highest measure at baseline of 1 million, would be the group that would benefit most from driving the viral load down as low as possible. This is a crucial question because it impacts how aggressively one pursues initiating or changing therapy, and at what cost do we drive the viral load down. Now that we have these very potent drugs--protease inhibitors--the practical use of these drugs is vital to individuals, in the hopes of optimizing and not wasting the potential benefits that may accrue to you from this class of drugs.</p>

<p>Following is a review of data that approaches this concern differently. This data was presented by Upjohn & Pharmacia at the 3rd Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in January 1996. It looks at the relationship in the change in viral load for the patients in their two studies (n=1740) of delavirdine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, as measured by their own in-house assay, . The study participants have been randomized to different treatment regimens, and have been taking study drug for an average of 10 months (range 2 to 18 months).</p>

<p>The patients were grouped into 3 different viral load ranges of measures: greater than 1,000,000 copies; under 100,000 copies; and the middle group of 100,000 to 1 million. We don't know how these numbers correlate with the RT-PCR assay or the bDNA assay because the in-house test used by Upjohn wasn't run with the same set of standards as the other tests. </p>

<p>[<b>Commentary</b>: However, Upjohn says their assay was validated and it has the same degree of efficiency and reproducability as the RT-PCR assay; and, the RNA measure is 5 times that of the RT-PCR measure, i.e. a 1 million RNA measure, by the Upjohn assay, is equal to 200,000 RT-PCR copies, 100,000 copies by Upjohn assay is approximately equal to 20,000 RT-PCR copies.]</p>

<p>Individuals were also grouped by changes in viral load, that resulted from the study therapy to which they were randomized; the 5 groups were: (1) individuals with an increase in RNA; (2) a RNA reduction of a 0.5 log to 0.3 log or 2-3 fold; (3) a reduction of 3 to 5 fold; (4) a decrease of 5 to 10 fold or 1 log; (5) a decrease of more than 1 log.</p>

<p><b>When should individuals initiate therapy?</b><br>
The graph shown, by Dr. Coombs, illustrated the point that individuals with the highest viral load (the group with more than 1 million copies), in this study, benefitted the most, as measured by clinical progression. In this group with viral load above 1 million (at baseline), individuals: in group (1) with an increase in viral load (subsequent to initiating therapy), showed the least benefit in clinical progression; there is a linear relationship in the amount of benefit each group had, as measured by clinical progression; that is, the more of a reduction in RNA that individuals had, then the greater their benefit, as measured by clinical progression. The linear relationship between these groups was clearly evident in the group of individuals with greater than 1 million copies. In the middle group, of individuals with RNA between 100,000 and 1 million, the relationships between the 5 groups weren't quite as linear but, viral load reductions, even modest ones, showed reductions in clinical progression; In the group with under 100,000 RNA copies, there seemed to be no difference in benefit to clinical progression, between the 5 groups. Dr. Coombs said, this suggests to him, that individuals with higher viral load may receive more benefit than individuals with lower viral loads, from therapy that results in similar reductions in viral load. Again, he suggested this may be a factor, in how aggressively we use therapy to drive the viral load down.</p>

<p>[<b>Commentary</b>: His earlier point was--what is the cost/benefit ratio of driving viral load down "as low as possible"? The results of this study indicate that at least among individuals with higher viral load (definitely for those with above 54,000 RNA, and mostly for those above 20,000), the amount of viral load reduction correlates with clinical progression, i.e. even incremental changes (a difference between 3-5 fold and 2-3 fold) in viral load produce differences in clinical progression (prognosis).</p>

<p>The Upjohn studies will not be completed until 1997, but data has been accumulated and analyzed for individuals with an average of 10 months in the trials (range 3-18 months). Although the analysis is preliminary, because the study is still ongoing, you can surmise some confirmation of viral load's correlation with clinical progression (prognosis). There are two studies. For protocol #17, the average CD4 was 135 at study entry, study participants averaged 1 to 1.5 years of AZT-experience. Subjects were randomized to either ddI alone or delavirdine + ddI. For the 2nd study, protocol # 21, subjects averaged 335 CD4, were AZT-naive or with under 6 months experience, and were randomized to either AZT, or AZT+delavirdine (Individuals were randomized to receive 3 different doses of delavirdine: 200, 300 or 400 3X/day). </p>

<pre><font size=3>
<b>Proportion of subjects progressing to AIDS or death</b>
				protocol #17		#21 
greater than 1 million RNA at baseline	30%		12%
between 100,000 to 1 million		11%		1%
less than 100,000			1%		0%
</font></pre>

<p>As you can see, individuals with higher CD4 (335) in #21, progressed more slowly, than those with lower CD4 (135) in #17. These are individuals whose viral load changed as a result of therapy, but therapeutic intervention did not occur because viral load was increasing, for any particular individual (that is the FDA's point). It is only 10 months of follow-up, and we do need longer-term data, but the implications are encouraging.</p>

<p><b>Commentary (cont.)</b>: This study, in summary, makes 4 points: (1) changes in viral load measures that occur from therapy correlate with clinical progression, at least at 10 months; but, as mentioned earlier, if an individual's viral load is rising and you then intervene with therapy and the viral load declines--will that person's course of disease progression be positively altered? As Dr. Coombs said, we are surmising that it will alter the course of disease progression, but he and the FDA say we need studies to confirm this; however, the concern is that some individuals in such a study would be randomized to the control group and thereby potentially suffer; (2) together, CD4 and viral load may be more predictive than either alone; (3) individuals with higher viral load may benefit more from an equal viral load reduction than those with low viral loads (under 20,000). Although this needs confirmation, it brings into the equation the consideration of the cost/benefit ratio; (4) each incremental reduction in viral load (for example, a difference between a 2-3 fold and a 3-5 fold reduction) may result in a difference in clinical progression, which again may be more pronounced at higher viral load levels.</p>

<p><b>When does one initiate protease inhibitor therapy?</b> Dr. Coombs is suggesting, that once your viral load is at a certain level or "threshold" (which we have not yet been able to establish, but it could be 20,000, 5,000 or 10,000, again depending also on the assay being used), then lowering your viral load even more should be weighed by the costs and potential benefits of doing that. The cost of lowering your viral load can include using up treatment options, financial, side effects. He is suggesting, it may be beneficial to save treatment options, rather than lowering viral load to "as low as possible"? But, let me make reference to a commentary from below, but relevant to this discussion: "....in patients with more advanced disease (median CD4 cell count, 89/ul), disease progression occurred in up to 30% of patients with fewer than 10,000 HIV RNA copies/ml." --Saag et al, Nature Medicine, vol 2, number 6, June 1996. This progression rate, of 30% appears to be greater than for individuals with under 10,000 RNA copies but higher CD4 counts.</p>

<p>However, with reference to the Upjohn study data, you could make a case that for the individuals in the lowest viral load group (under 100,000), there may not be this linear relationship (whereby, those with greatest RNA reduction received the most benefit to clinical progression), because this arm of the study had fewer participants, their CD4 counts were probably higher, there RNA levels were lower --therefore, they have less risk of progression, less endpoints have so far been accumulated and it should take more time to detect progression and the possibility of development of the linear relationship. Despite what Dr. Coombs says, this may leave open to question, his assertion that it may not be beneficial (cost/benefit ratio) for individuals with RNA below a certain level 5-10,000 to initiate protease inhibitor therapy. Research needs to address these type of questions, so we can try to better utilize viral load technology and protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>These opinions represent one school of thinking. There are other experts who suggest that the better approach may be to "hit hard and hit early". That is, treat with the most potent therapy and treat early in one's disease stage, unless perhaps if your viral load is already very low (under 5,000 or 10,000) and/or your CD4 may be relatively high. Although, a study is ongoing examining treatment intervention after seroconversion, regardless of one's CD4 and viral load. And, there are some differences of opinion about which viral load level is low enough, is it 200, below 5,000 or 10,000? We do not have confirmation that a particular viral load level is low enough. If your viral load is 5,000, should you initiate protease inhibitor therapy now or should you wait? The answer to this question is more clear if your viral load is over 20,000; and, becomes more clear the higher one's viral load climbs; the IAS interim guidelines (discussed below) recommend driving one's viral load as low as possible or to "undetectable levels"; while Dr. Coombs is not convinced that is necessary, that is 5,000 may be acceptable.</p>

<p>This relates directly to the question--when should an individual initiate therapy? or when should an individual initiate protease inhibitor therapy? If your viral load is 5,000, should you initiate protease inhibitor therapy now or should you wait? THe IAS guidelines recommend initiating therapy if your viral load is above 5-10,000 and your CD4 status suggests progression. If your viral load is 25,000 and your CD4 count is 200, should you initiate therapy now? The subject of cross-resistance between protease inhibitors is relevant to this discussion. Will treatment with a particular protease inhibitor cause any or significant cross-resistance to another protease inhibitor? We do not yet adequately understand the cross-resistance relationships between different protease inhibitors. If your viral load is 5,000, by waiting until we better understand cross-resistance between protease inhibitors, you may be better able to optimize your results from therapy. But, we may not have information for a good while (1 year maybe), that is adequate to understand cross-resistance sufficiently to answer these questions. Also, there are many individual and theoretical factors that can be considered in making these decisions. Does one want to use the best available therapy early in their disease stage, rather than save it for later? The answers to many of these questions are not yet clear.</p>

<p>Some studies recently started and others in planning stages will address some of these many issues. Pilot studies examining treatment intervention in acute infection are ongoing. Individuals who have recently sero-converted will be treated with a 3-drug combination including a protease inhibitor. Pilot studies are ongoing examining 3-drug combination therapy (with a protease inhibitor) in individuals who are treatment-naive and in a higher CD4 range. Studies are being planned for individuals with greater than 500 CD4. 4-drug combination studies are being planned for treatment-naive and possibly treatment experienced individuals. Other studies are being planned to examine treatment intervention with various "potent" combinations at various stages of disease. Dr. Coombs contends that these approaches, such as treating acute infection or early intervention (individuals with "higher" CD4), are promising theories, that need to be researched before we put too much stock into them.</p>

<p>One reason some experts recommend "hit hard and hit early" is, because the earlier it is in an individuals disease progression, their virus has not had as much opportunity to replicate and therefore mutate. The virus will tend to be more homogenous; the contention is that a homogenous (the virus hasn't had ample opportunity yet to mutate very much) virus is more receptive to treatment and less likely to develop resistance to the treatment as quickly as an individual's virus that is more heterogenous from replication and mutation. This thinking is based on the recent research developments from David Ho, George Shaw and others. Prior thinking was that there was a prolonged period of relative virus latency; this has been replaced with the thinking that ongoing, high-level viral replication takes place from the time of initial infection. This research says, as many as 10 billion new HIV virions are produced per day, with a half-life in plasma of 6 hours. CD4 cells, a principle target for the virus responsible for viral replication, are also produced in high number, and once productively infected, have a half-life of 1.6 days. The life-cycle of the virus, from infection of one cell to the production of new progeny, which infects the next cell, is 2.6 days.</p>

<p>There is postulation, that if treated early enough in the disease with potent therapy, an individual may, in a sense, put the virus in remission; that is, lower the viral load to an undetectable level (undetectable does not mean virus isn't present) and stop viral replication or keep it at an extremely low rate; or, possibly eradicate the virus from the blood. Pilot studies in progress or in the planning stages will explore this notion. At this point, it is just a theory, but very worthy of study and one that creates hope. </p>

<p>The ACTG 175, Upjohn and MACS research, discussed above, appear to indicate that reductions in viral load can alter the course of clinical progression. Although, reductions in RNA were mostly modest in the 175 and Upjohn studies, the drug therapies used in the study did not include any protease inhibitors. In the group with over 1 million viral load, a 1 log or greater reduction in RNA produced the most benefit to clinical progression, when compared to individuals, in the other groups with less viral load reductions. As you know, successful protease inhibitor therapy, which utilizes effective multi-drug combinations, has produced in some instances, significantly more than 1 log decreases in viral load. Importantly, still to be confirmed, is the durability of these reductions in viral load.] <b>end of commentary</b></p>

<P><b>Use both CD4 and viral load in assessments.</b> Dr. Coombs displayed a graph of data from Bill O'Brien's VA study (O'Brien et al, NEJM 1995) which indicated that individuals with both an increase in CD4 and a reduction in viral load clinically progressed more slowly than individuals who had neither and individuals who had only a CD4 increase or a viral load reduction. Dr. Coombs said, that looking at combinations of responses to drugs, both immunologic (CD4) and virologic (RNA) markers are more beneficial than looking at one or the other alone. The data from the Upjohn studies support CD4 and viral load together are more predictive. He went on to say, we still have a lot to learn about what exactly are the factors that define the treatment effect. At the moment, we are trying to understand how much of the treatment effect can be explained by changes in RNA and/or CD4, and its clear that even together they explain only part of it, but not all of it. Other studies have illustrated that other factors are relevant, such as properties of the virus and other additional properties of the host, that are extremely important in defining the types of response that individuals will experience from changes in viral load alone. So, it is much more complicated than we are currently appreciating, to better understand an individual's response to treatment. At the moment, we are left with more simple markers of the disease, for example CD4 and viral load, to help make clinical decisions about what does or doesn't constitutes effective therapy. In future clinical studies, it would be helpful if we are able to factor in other properties or disease markers.</p>

<p><b>Guidelines for using viral load testing and interpreting measurements.</b> The discussion, so far by Dr. Coombs, is helpful in placing into better context the following part of his discussion. The International AIDS Society (IAS) convened a USA advisory panel, who after careful deliberation, have assembled a list of interim recommendations related to viral load measurement and the use of test results. The panel consists of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Michael Saag, MD, University of Alabama-Birmingham<br>
Mark Holodney, MD, Stanford University William A. O'Brien, MD, UC-Los 
Angeles<br>
Robert W. Coombs, MD, PhD, University of Washington<br>
Margaret E. Poscher, MD, UC-San Francisco<br>
Donna M. Jacobson, BS, IAIDS Society-USA<br>
George M. Shaw Md, PhD, University of Alabama-Birmingham<br>
Douglas D. Richman, MD, UC-San Diego<br>
Paul A. Volberding, MD, UC-San Francisco<br>
Daniel R. Kuritzkes, MD, University of Colorado</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, these recommendations have just been published (Nature Medicine, volume 2, number 6, June 1996). The recommendations are characterized as interim, because more information is important to better understanding how to use the tests, the meaning and interpretation of test results, and how to better apply these results. Currently, individuals and their doctors are utilizing the test and its results in managing HIV, and in fact it is widely believed that proper use of the test and its results can be helpful in clinical practice. These recommendations are intended to provide helpful guidelines for patients and doctors.</p>

<p>The following questions are addressed by the recommendations:</p>

<ol>
<li>Where to initiate therapy? 
<li>What target level of HIV RNA should we look for after initiating therapy? 
<li>What is the minimum decrease in HIV RNA that is indicative of antiviral activity and we hope efficacy of the drug or therapy? 
<li>What is the change in RNA level that suggests drug treatment failure? 
<li>How frequently should we monitor RNA? 
<li>What are the optimum methods of specimen processing?
</ol>

<p>With each IAS recommendation, Dr. Coombs has added his own editorial, sometimes differing with the recommendation.</p>

<p>1. <b>Where to initiate therapy?</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Panel recommendation: More than between 5,000-10,000; Dr. Coombs editorialized that 5-10,000 applies when using the bDNA test, but if using RT-PCR, he recommends greater than 20,000, because from his experience the RT-PCR can run twice as high as bDNA.</p>

<p>The panel strongly encourages therapy at greater than 25,000; Dr. Coombs says 25,000 by bDNA and 50,000 by RT-PCR.</p>

<p>In clinical and natural history studies reported to date, some people with higher than 25,000(bDNA) or 50,000 (PCR) are in the group associated with higher disease progression rates.</p>

<p>Dr. Coombs: Although RT-PCR and bDNA correlate well in their results, there are no common RNA assay standards; therefore, values from the bDNA assay cannot be readily translated into values from the RT-PCR assay. One common recommendation is if you are being monitored by one assay type, you should continue using it, and not switch from one assay to another, until we have common assay standards.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>2. <b>Target level of RNA after initiating therapy</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The panel recommends--"undetectable levels of plasma HIV RNA should be sought... under 5,000 would be acceptable." (Dr. Coombs says--5,000 by bDNA or 10,000 by RT-PCR). Panel: "It has not been shown whether plasma HIV RNA reduced to a particular level by antiretroviral therapy carries the same risk of clinical progression as that same HIV RNA level without antiretroviral therapy" having been used. "Prospective clinical trials are urgently needed to address this question." Dr. Coombs: Under 10,000 (bDNA) or 20,000 (RT-PCR) RNA copies is probably a reasonable target, based on that individuals with these measures appear to have a very slow clinical progression rate. We don't yet know how much benefit accrues from driving the viral load much lower. Since this is a slow progressing group, establishing the clinical benefit to them from a log or more change, will take some time to sort out.</p>

<p>[<b>Commentary</b>: Dr. Coombs' approach is cautionary and one from a statistical scientist of some renown. Obviously, we do need more information to better understand if it is beneficial to lower one's viral load to 500 rather than 4,000. Or, more to the point of the discussion, is there a difference between 10,000 and 5,000? Dr. Coombs' earlier discussion of the cost/benefit ratio of therapy decisions is applicable to this situation.]</p>

<p>[<b>Commentary</b>: MACS--correlation of viral load measurement with clinical progression. At this time, the subject of viral load has taken center stage. As of the date of writing this article, we are waiting to hear from the FDA on their decision of whether or not to approve Roche's application for approval of their RNA test, and what indication the FDA will approve for the use of the test. Another article has just been published, "Prognosis in HIV-1 Infection Predicted by the Quantity of Virus in Plasma," (Mellors et al, Science, vol 272, 24 May 1996). It is fitting to mention here some results, because the study (the Pittsburgh portion of the MACS trial), which this article is about, offers data about clinical progression to AIDS and survival for group of individuals with viral load under 4,430, of between 4,531 and 13,020, and over 13, 021. Above, Dr. Coombs refers to the lack of data regarding the benefit of driving viral load much below 10,000--- is there a benefit to lowering viral load from 4,000 to 500? What is the cost/benefit ratio? Data from this retrospective study is related this discussion.</p>

<p>180 seropositive study participants enrolled in MACS in 1984 and 1985. Their blood specimens were taken at study entry and every 6 months and stored. RNA measures were taken and analyzed retrospectively, from the stored samples. Individuals were followed for progression to AIDS (1987 CDC definition) and death. Based on their retrospective baseline RNA value, individuals were divided into the following ranges of RNA: under 4,530; 4,531-13,020; 13,021-36,270; over 36,271. For this analysis, HIV-1 RNA was measured by the new 2nd generation bDNA assay; the 1st assay upon which the first MACS data analysis was based (discussed earlier in this article) is limited, in that it measures down to 10,000 RNA copies; this 2nd generation assay is more sensitive, as it measures as low as 500 copies. Since, we are discussing whether it may be beneficial to reduce one's viral load from 10,000 to 5,000 or lower, the data from this study has some relevance.</p>

<p>It is in context to quote from the Nature Medicine article--"Higher HIV RNA levels correlate with lower baseline CD4 counts, more rapid declines in CD4 counts, and more rapid disease progression....maintenance of plasma HIV RNA levels below 10,000 in early HIV disease appears to be associated with decreased risk of progression to AIDS. However, in patients with more advanced disease (median CD4 counts, 89/ul), disease progression occurred in up to 30% of patients with fewer than 10,000 HIV RNA copies/ml." -----The cost/benefit ratio concept is importantly relevant to this last sentence. If individuals with lower CD4 counts have more potential to progress in the under 10,000 copy range, than those with higher CD4 counts but also with under 10,000 RNA, then this may dictate a different and more aggressive approach (for individuals with lower CD4 and under 10,000 RNA) to the question---when should an individual initiate or change therapy?</p>

<p><b>***</b>"For the 4 groups, ranging from the lowest through the highest viral load, the proportion of subjects who progressed to AIDS by 5 years after study entry were 8, 26, 49 and 62%. The median times to development of AIDS for subjects in these 4 groups were greater than 10, 7.7, 5.3, and 3.5 years. (Remember, the data collection was only out to 10 years). For the 4 groups, ranging from the lowest through the highest viral load, the proportions of subjects who died within 5 years were 5, 10, 25 and 49%. The median estimated survival times in these 4 groups, ranging from the lowest viral load to the highest were, greater than 10, 9.5, 7.4 and 5.1". These results are mostly independent of CD4 values.<b>***</b></p>

<p>Although it is not clearly defined, you may be able to infer, from these study results, that lowering viral load from 13,021 to under 4,530 may have value. However, if you factor in the cost/benefit ratio considerations, the value of such a reduction in RNA is difficult and more complicated to determine.] <b>end of commentary</b>.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>3. <b>Minimal decrease in HIV RNA indicative of antiviral activity and hopefully efficacy</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Panel recommends: at least a 0.5 log reduction that is sustained (3-fold or greater), based on our understanding of factors affecting variability (biological and within-assay variability). "It is likely that the clinical benefits of antiretroviral therapy are related to the duration as well as to the magnitude of HIV suppression...., although the precise duration of HIV suppression necessary to result in measurable clinical benefits still needs to be clearly defined." </p>

<p>Dr. Coombs: Sustained decreases of as little as 2-fold, in clinical studies, have been associated. Just looking at the amount of RNA reduction (0.5) may not be adequate to judge the prospect of clinical benefit. As discussed earlier, a 1 log decrease for an individual with a viral load of 1 million copies may be more beneficial, to that individual, than a 1 log reduction for an individual with 20,000 RNA copies. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>4. <b>Change in HIV RNA that suggests drug treatment failure</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Panel: "The return of HIV RNA levels to pre-treatment (or to within 0.3-0.5 log of the pre-treatment value) values, confirmed by at least two measurements, is indicative of drug failure and should prompt considerations of alternative treatment regimens".</p>

<p>Dr. Coombs: A return to baseline is probably an indication that the viral load is no longer reflecting antiviral activity. Again, this change is very dependent on starting RNA level. For example, a return to baseline, if baseline is less than 10,000 (bDNA) or 20,000 (RT-PCR) may not be so bad, and addresses the issue of the cost/benefit ratio of driving viral load lower, without evidence of clinical benefit, which we urgently need to obtain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>5. <b>Suggested frequency of HIV RNA measurement</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Panel: At baseline: 2 measurements, 2 to 4 weeks apart to assess the inherent variability. Subsequently, measurements might be obtained along with the CD4 count every 3 to 4 months, since serial determination of both markers simultaneously provide useful information. Shorter intervals may be appropriate as critical decision points--such as the return of the viral load to baseline values--are approached. RNA levels should be measured 3-4 weeks after initiating or changing therapy to determine antiviral activity, before waiting to see if the CD4 count reflects a change.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>6. <b>Optimal methods of specimen processing</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Panel: Optimal procedures for storage, handling, and processing samples have yet to be fully defined. Each provider should adopt consistent procedures for handling specimens, including using the same collection tube and anticoagulant, processing techniques, transport and storage procedures. To minimize signal degradation, all plasma specimens should be separated and frozen within 6 hours of collection. If this approach is not possible, the plasma should be removed and refrigerated. Less desirably, the whole blood could be refrigerated, but not for more than 24 hours before separation and freezing are completed. Consistent use of the same assay in an individual patient is very important.</p>

<p>Dr. Coombs: Use the recommended anticoagulant, as it varies, depending on which assay you are using. Prompt processing and freezing of the specimen within 2-4 hours, or at least within 6 hours of phlebotomy.</p>

<p>Conclusion by Dr. Coombs at the forum: In the long term, only carefully controlled trials will prove to us the utility of HIV RNA measurement for routine clinical management of HIV-1 infected individuals.</p>

<h3>NEVIRAPINE: ACCELERATED APPROVAL RECOMMENDED for adults by the advisory committee June 9, 1996</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>On Friday June 7, the Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee was convened to consider the application by Boehringer Ingelheim for accelerated approval of their non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), nevirapine (brand name VIRAMUNE). Only half the day was needed for deliberation, as the Committee quickly decided (by a vote of 8-0) to recommend accelerated approval to the FDA, for the first NNRTI to apply for and receive approval. Indinavir's (Merck's protease inhibitor) committee recommendation wasn't as easy nor as quick. Accelerated approval for nevirapine was recommended for both drug-naive and experienced individuals in combination therapy. In this article, the following subjects will be addressed--- efficacy, safety, resistance, drug interactions, clinical endpoint studies, pediatric study, how to use nevirapine, the status of approval applications in foreign countries, contact information for the nevirapine expanded access program, and the company's report of gender/race results. Because nevirapine and protease inhibitors are hepatically metabolized, discussed below is the need for additional research in better learning how to manage individuals with liver impairment in the context of this new environment for HIV antiretroviral treatment. At the hearing, concerns were expressed by committee members and myself, because protease inhibitors and some other drugs used for HIV are metabolized by the same pathway in the liver; this is also addressed in the article.</p>

<p>NNRTIs have the same target of action (reverse transcriptase) as nucleosides, but have a different mechanism of action. 10 phase IIb/III trials were conducted and results from 3 were presented in support of their application: ACTG 241, BI 1037, BI 1046. As currently required for accelerated approval, clinical endpoint studies are ongoing and their status was discussed at the hearing. A total of 1,700 individuals have been treated with nevirapine (1,400 adults and 300 pediatrics), and more than 150 in pharmacokinetics trials. Maureen Myers, PhD, the Clinical Program Director for Virology Clinical Research at Boehringer Ingelheim, presented the clinical data to the panel. Some important characteristics of nevirapine are: absolute bioavailability--greater than 90%; good CSF penetration (Cerebrospinal fluid); protein binding--60%; plasma concentrations exceed the IC-50 after 1st dose; steady state reached in 4 weeks; hepatic metabolism (P450, 3A4-2B6); BID regimen (after 2 weeks at 200 mg once daily, then 200 mg twice daily); a limiting consideration in the selection of the recommended dosing regimen is the incidence of the development of a rash from nevirapine treatment. The recommended dosing regimen is 200 mg per day for two weeks (called the lead-in period) to be followed by 400 mg per day (200 mg twice per day). </p>

<h4>PHASE III TRIALS</h4>

<p><b>ACTG 241</b><br>
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week trial of triple therapy (nevirapine+AZT+ddI) vs. double therapy (AZT+ddI+placebo); there was no washout period as therapy was just added on to current therapy individuals were taking. The study examined the change from baseline of CD4 and viral load (HIV RNA); 398 participants; mean entry CD4--153 cells (range 1-433 cells); mean entry viral RNA--4.59 log copies/ml; RNA copies at baseline for triple therapy group--40,000; for the double therapy group--37,800; 6 months prior therapy required; median of 25 months prior therapy; 33% had greater than 36 months prior therapy; 66% had previous ddI or ddC experience with or without AZT.</p>

<p><b>CD4 changes</b>. For the triple therapy group, CD4 peaked at 8 weeks with a 35 increase from baseline (bsln= 156 cells, n=196); at 24 weeks, the CD4 increase was still 25 above baseline; at 40 weeks it was 20 above baseline and then sharply dropped back to baseline (0 cell increase) by 48 weeks. The double therapy group (AZT+ddI) peaked at 8 weeks with a 20 cell increase from baseline (bsln=151 cells, n=196); by 24 weeks the CD4 decreased by 5 below baseline; at 48 weeks, CD4 was 18 below baseline.</p>

<p><b>HIV RNA</b>. The baseline RNA was 40,000 (n=95) for triple therapy and 37,800 (n=93) for the double therapy group. The triple therapy group (NVP/AZT/ddI) peaked at 4 weeks with a 1.2 log decrease from baseline, which quickly started to trend back up; at 8 weeks, the reduction was 0.75 log; at 16 weeks, the reduction was 0.5 log; at 24 weeks, the reduction was 0.25 log; by 48 weeks, the reduction was only 0.12 from baseline. For the double therapy group (AZT/ddI), the RNA peaked with a 0.4 reduction from baseline at 4 weeks; by 24 weeks, the reduction was 0.10; and at 48 weeks, the RNA was 0.12 above baseline.</p>

<p>Performances were mitigated by drug experience: 25 months prior therapy, 33% with more than 3 yrs. prior therapy. Dr. Myers said, resistance developed more quickly, in the heavily pre-treated group, as opposed to the responses of those who are drug naive (BI 1046), which will be discussed below. The study population was divided by CD4 into 3 strata: less than 50 CD4, 51-200 and above 200. Apparently, the under 50 CD4 group benefitted less than individuals with greater than 50 CD4.</p>

<p><b>AZT-only experienced</b>. 31% of study subjects in ACTG 241, had prior experience only with AZT. These individuals added ddI or NVP+ddI to their current AZT therapy, as opposed to other study subjects who had prior experience with ddI, ddC, AZT/ddI or AZT/ddC. This separate analysis defines more clearly, the utility of both NVP and ddI, used either as separate therapies or when used together, in a group that wasn't experienced with the other drugs or combinations, and therefore allows us to better understand its utility.</p>

<p>CD4 change from baseline (triple group bsln=188 cells, n=61; double group bsln=185 cells, n=62) for the group with only AZT experience--</p>

</table></center> 

<p>Evidently, overall these individuals had greater CD4 increases that were
better sustained, presumably because they had less prior treatment-experience, as their baseline CD4 and RNA were similar to the other more drug experienced group. The overall RNA benefits were also better for this group than for the more drug experienced individuals. Assumedly, resistance developed more quickly. This more clearly shows the benefit of NVP's contribution because of less noise from the extensive previous therapy.</p>

<p><b>BI 1037</b>.<br>
This small study of AZT-experienced individuals was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled for 60 study participants; 28 weeks in duration; CD4 range 200-500, mean count was 373 cells; median prior AZT-experience of 8 months, range of 3-24 months; mean viral RNA was 17,378 at baseline. Study subjects either continued AZT therapy with placebo or added nevirapine to their current AZT therapy. This trial examined double therapy, while ACTG 241 examined triple therapy.</p>

<p><b>CD4 changes</b>. The CD4 increase in the NVP+AZT group peaked at 55 cells at 8 weeks; at 24 weeks the increase from baseline was 35 cells; but steeply declined by 28 weeks, to 10 cells below baseline. At 8 weeks, the AZT alone group was at baseline; at 16 weeks, the CD4 count declined by 35 below baseline; and by 28 weeks it was 40 cells below baseline.

<p>Although this was a healthier study population than those in ACTG 241 (significantly higher baseline, CD4--373 vs. 150, and lower RNA, 17,000 vs, 37-40,000), apparently, double therapy is not adequately potent to suppress viral replication and delay resistance.</p>

<p><b>BI 1046</b>.<br>
A small group of 151 treatment-naive subjects were studied for 12 months in a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial. The study compared triple therapy of NVP+AZT+ddI vs. AZT+ddI vs. NVP+AZT; CD4 200-600 cells; baseline measures--mean CD4 count 376 cells, range 145-755 cells; mean viral RNA--25,700 copies/ml, range 347 to 724,436. This study recently completed on May 15, </p>

<p><b>CD4 changes</b>. The CD4 data is now available out to 52 weeks, as it has only been recently compiled and analyzed; the FDA only had the 28-week data for review in April. For the triple therapy, the CD4 increase from baseline at 4 weeks was 70 cells; at 16 weeks, the CD4 increase was 110 cells; at 20 weeks, the CD4 increase was 135 cells from baseline; at 28 weeks, the increase was 120 cells; at 40 weeks, the CD4 increase was 135; and at 52 weeks, the CD4 increase was 140 CD4. For the AZT/ddI group, at 4 weeks the increase 40 cells; at 16 weeks, the CD4 increase was 90 cells; at 28 weeks, the CD4 increase was 70 cells; at 40 weeks, the increase was 85 cells; and at 52 weeks, the CD4 increase from baseline declined to 30 cells above baseline. For the double therapy of NVP+AZT, CD4 increase peaked at 80 cells at 4 weeks; at 16 weeks, the increase from baseline was 25 cells; at 28 weeks, the CD4 increase was 10 cells; at 40 weeks, the CD4 was 15 above baseline; and at 52 weeks, the CD4 was back to the baseline.</p>

<p><b>HIV RNA</b>. Currently, the viral load data is only available now out to 28 weeks; for the triple therapy of NVP/AZT/ddI, the RNA peak reduction is 1.75 log at 4 weeks; at 16 weeks, it is sustained at 1.70 log; and at 28 weeks, the reduction remains sustained at 1.65 log below baseline. For the double therapy of AZT/ddI, the RNA at 2 weeks is 1.50 log below baseline; at 16 weeks, it remains at 1.50 below baseline; and at 28 weeks, it is 1.30 below baseline. For the double therapy of NVP+AZT, the initial RNA reduction is 1.75 log at 2 weeks; at 16 weeks, the reduction is 0.65 below baseline; and at 28 weeks, it is 0.40 below baseline.</p>

<p>In an initial pre-planned analysis of the trial, the difference in RNA at 28 weeks between the triple and double therapy group of AZT/ddI was not found to be statistically significant; however, the triple therapy group had a lower baseline RNA; after an adjustment in the analysis for the difference in baseline RNA between the AZT/ddI and triple therapy groups, the difference in RNA at 28 weeks was statistically significant. The NVP+AZT group had a 40% undetectable rate at 4 weeks, but this regimen was unable to sustain this level of viral suppression beyond 4 weeks. Apparently, if you can adequately suppress the virus, resistance to NVP is delayed.</p>

<p><b>Resistance</b>.<br>
Reduced susceptibility was associated with mutations at residues: 103, 106,
108, 181, 188 and 190, both in vitro and in vivo. In previously treated subjects, reduced susceptibility appears within 8 weeks of treatment initiation. Codon change at position 181 does not appear in subjects treated concurrently with NVP+AZT. The only drug with which cross-resistance  would be expected is delavirdine which results in the same codon changes as NVP.  <a href="../../network/simple/dela.html">Delavirdine</a> is another NNRTI being developed by Upjohn and Pharmacia, and it is expected to be soon reviewed for approval by the FDA.  Boehringer reported an analysis of 6 months resistance data (from the BI 1046 trial) for 4 individuals on triple therapy (NVP+AZT+ddI) and 4 on double therapy (NVP+AZT). The 4 individuals taking NVP+AZT, whether or not they were compliant with taking study drug, were resistant to NVP at 6 months. Of the 4 taking NVP+AZT+ddI,  the 2 individuals who were resistant to NVP were non-compliant and were unable to keep their viral level below the limit of detection; the other 2 individuals who were not resistant to NVP were fully compliant and were below the limit of detection for the full 28 weeks of the study.  Boehringer defined non-compliance as a subject who failed to take at least one study drug for at least 28 days. This resistance data is based on a small number of individuals, so additional resistance research is needed for nevirapine, as well as for other drugs, because we need to better understand the resistance relationships of all HIV antiretroviral treatments.</p>

<p><b>Results by gender/race</b><br>
In pharmacokinetics studies, Boerhinger reported, there were no gender differences in NVP oral clearance or plasma concentrations; and, no marked difference in steady-state trough concentrations by race.</p>

<p>In ACTG 241, there were 20% female and 26% non-caucasian participants. Boerhinger reported, gender and race did not significantly affect CD4 or RNA changes on triple therapy; and, there was no evidence of interaction between gender/race and treatment group in CD4 or RNA changes, i.e, results weren't inconsistent due to gender or race. Lastly, there was no evidence of effect on safety profile.</p>

<p><b>Safety</b><br>
There was a 22% incidence rate for the occurrence of a rash; but the incidence rate for a severe rash (grade 3 or 4) was 6%. 6.7% of study subjects permanently discontinued in the presence of a rash. For those individuals using fluconazole there was a 6% greater chance of developing a rash (25% of study particpants were using fluconazole), than for those not using fluconazole (19%). If a rash emerged, 50% of the time it was dissipated by 2 weeks; by 1 month, 80% were dissipated. If an individual has to discontinue NVP treatment due to a rash, it is not recommended to attempt a re-challenge (try the drug again). It is the company's experience, that upon re-challenge a severe rash occurs. Mild or moderate rashes do not compel discontinuation; rashes occur predominately early in treatment. The risk for rash is greatest in the first 6 weeks of NVP treatment. If a rash occurs, you should inform your doctor; Boehringer recommends, if a rash occurs during the dose lead-in period, you should not dose escalate; and, if a rash is uncomfortable you should discontinue.</p>

<p>At Vancouver, the company will distribute an educational booklet, to the public, discussing the matter of a rash and nevirapine.</p>

<p>At the Int'l. AIDS Conference in Vancouver, additional data on protease inhibitors will be reported. I will be at Vancouver reporting daily highlights to you via the NATAP internet homepage at: <a href="../index.html">http://www.aidsnyc.org/natap</a></p>

<p>Of course, following the conference, NATAP will be reporting full details of important data, on the NATAP homepage; look for an update to our bound 46-page booklet--"HIV Protease Inhibitor Report--2nd edition."</p>

<p>As a result of NVP treatment in trials, 5.4% of study participants have experienced abnormally elevated liver function tests (LFTs--SGOT & SGPT). There has been a 2% rate of study discontinuation, as a result of abnormal LFT elevation. Some individuals have experienced similar responses to protease inhibitors. As well, in ACTG 241, BI 1037 and BI 1011, study participants experienced a 10% incidence in the elevation of GGT--a liver related laboratory test.</p>

<p><b>Liver research needed</b>. At the hearing, in the open session, I addressed this issue by suggesting that because we have so many new antivirals which are hepatically metabolized--protease inhibitors, NNRTIs--and because so many individuals have impaired liver function (due to extensive drug experience, Hepatitis B & C), therefore the industry and the FDA (and the NIH) should start designing studies to explore how to manage these individuals in the context of administering these new antiretrovirals. As use of these antiviral drugs become more widespread, and continue to be used simultaneously with other drugs (some of which are popular and effective prophylaxis treatments), liver-related side effects may become increasingly more evident; and, treatment strategies will become increasingly more limited for this population.</p>

<p>This may emerge as a problem as individuals with some liver impairment start combining two protease inhibitors, or start transitioning from one protease inhibitor to another or as an individuals length of exposure to protease inhibitors builds over time and their liver starts to wear from it. Of course, more effective research initiatives into Hep. B & C would also be helpful. The effectiveness of currently available treatments for these liver diseases are very limited, particularly for Hep. C. This is an issue that deserves more attention and needs follow-up. The protease inhibitor manufacturers, and the NNRTI manufacturers are some of the world's largest and wealthiest corporations, who have the resources to address this issue; but, they have been busy getting their drugs approved. Now, it may be time for them to address these concerns.</p>

<p><b>Drug Interactions</b>. "It was suggested, at the hearing, that doctors monitor their patients during the first few weeks of nevirapine therapy, if they are taking any drugs that may have potential interactions". Nevirapine is hepatically metabolized (P450, 3A4-2B6). Consequently, there are concerns about potential drug interactions. Protease inhibitors and other drugs are similarly metabolized. The company did not have much data on drug interactions to present at the hearing. An interaction study with saquinavir is ongoing; they had some data on 11 of 24 subjects being studies. It is preliminary, but the average response of the eleven subjects was that saquinavir blood levels were lowered by 16%. However, the graph of the 11 subjects indicated that some had 50% increases in saquinavir blood levels. The company said, it is not unusual to have such variable results, and it is too soon to assign a number to the change in saquinavir blood levels. Studies with indinavir and ritonavir are about to begin. Until these studies are completed, it is recommended that individuals do not combine nevirapine with protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>As well, other drugs have potential for interaction with nevirapine. Studies are being planned with drugs that are representative of the major classes of drugs which are used by people with HIV. At the hearing, the committee raised concerns about the following drugs: rifampin, dapsone, azole drugs, methadone, rifabutin and ketoconazole. The company said, in vitro, ketoconazole inhibited the metabloilism of NVP, but when a small amount of participants in BI 1046 were studied who were taking ketoconazole and NVP, NVP levels weren't changed; this merits further attention and investigation. Aside from ketoconazole, it seems that some of these aforementioned drugs or other drugs in the same class may cause a 15% reduction of nevirapine in steady state blood levels. The company predicted some of these drugs will suffer reduced blood levels from interaction with nevirapine. Again for emphasis, it was suggested that doctors monitor their patients during the first few weeks of nevirapine therapy, if they are on any drugs that may have potential interactions. Dr. Chris Mathews, a committee member, was concerned about a reduction in the therapeutic plasma levels for those drugs which are necessary for prevention of opportunistic infections (OI); and thereby, this may cause failure of that therapy and the development of an OI. In my public commentary to the committee, I expressed concern about this issue and reminded the panel that Abbott came prepared to their hearing with more extensive data on drug interactions. Dr. Myers, of Boerhinger said, nevirapine was a mild to moderate enzyme inducer; but, the FDA said they will be working with the company on drug interaction studies. This concern should be closely monitored.</p>

<p><b>How to use this drug</b>. With the availability of nevirapine, we have more drugs in our arsenal with which to design treatment strategies. As I discussed in my talk for the open commentary as this hearing, nevirapine provides additional options for everyone. For individuals who may be intolerable to other nucleosides, may have depleted treatment options, or may have failed other drugs, nevirapine offers an option with which to strategize. For both drug-naive and experienced, protease inhibitor therapy could be postponed or saved for future use, while a person could use nevirapine therapy prior to a protease inhibitor. Again, until we have more information from interaction studies, it is recommended that nevirapine is not to be combined with concurrent use of a protease inhibitor.</p>

<p>In the studies discussed above, Nevirapine clearly was more potent in 3-drug combinations then in 2-drug combinations; nevirapine was more effective for drug-naive individuals than for the drug-experienced population. Apparently, the more experience and the more diverse that experience, the less effective nevirapine.</p>

<p>A number of committee members expressed preference that the drug be used in triple therapy rather than double therapy, but were unwilling to restrict the labeling indication to its use only in a 3-drug combination. If you are able to start 2 drugs never before used, simultaneous to initiating nevirapine therapy, the studies indicate that the efficacy of nevirapine and the overall benefits to CD4 and viral load will be greatly enhanced; because, if you can adequately suppress viral replication, resistance is delayed and the drugs efficacy is sustained; the less exposure you may have had to a drug, the better the possibilities are for suppressing virus replication and delaying resistance.</p>

<p><b>Expanded Access Program</b>. If you, your doctor or any other interested party would like information about the availability of nevirapine through the company's expanded access program, you can call toll-free 1-800-595-5494; or, you can make contact by fax at 1-800-535-5652.</p>

<p><b>Clinical endpoint studies</b>. ACTG 193a has been ongoing for a while and compares--NVP+AZT+ddI vs. AZT+ddI vs. AZT+ddC vs. AZT alternating ddI; it was intended to examine survival and progression to clinical AIDS; but, because of the availability of protease inhibitors, the start of ACTG study 320 (which examines Crixivan in a clinical endpoint study), and because ACTG 193a study monitors have said they believe they have enough endpoints already--subjects are being rolled out of the trial.</p>

<p>BI 1090 is a clinical endpoint trial with a recruitment goal of 2,000; however, only 250 subjects have been recruited and the prospects for enrollment in the USA, where protease inhibitors are generally available, may be slower, until they can allow co-administration of NVP with protease inhibitors. International recruitment is more encouraging because protease inhibitors are less available. The committee expressed concern about the prospect of not obtaining adequate data on clinical endpoints. As you may know, FDA regulations require that for full or traditional approval adequate clinical endpoint data must be provided to the FDA.</p>

<p><b>Pediatric trial</b>. Enrollment continues in ACTG 245, which is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial for 432 HIV+ children with greater than 24 weeks of prior antiretroviral therapy and clinical progression. It is intended as a 48-week comparison of NVP+AZT+ddI vs. NVP+ddI vs. AZT+ddI. The trial is studying safety/tolerance, CD4 count, HIV RNA, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and clinical response (growth, ND/NP status, survival). The trial initiated in August of 1994 and is slated for completion in February 1997. Nevirapine has demonstrated significant CSF (Cerebrospinal Fluid) penetration in this pediatric population. 9% (11/123) of pediatric study subjects receiving nevirapine treatment had a rash that was equal to or greater than a grade 2 rash. 100% of rashes occurred in the first 28 days after NVP treatment initiated. 0.8% (1/123) experienced a serious (grade 3/4) rash.</p>

<p><b>Foreign countries</b>. Applications for approval were filed in May in Australia and New Zealand. an application will be filed this month in Canada; in July, an application will be filed in South Africa; company representatives will be meeting shortly with European officials to discuss the submission of surrogate marker data. In Europe, accelerated approval is not yet recognized; clinical endpoint data is still required for approval. It is expected that by early '97, surrogate marker data will be submitted to European officials.</p>

<p>We can be hopeful, that with the availability of more and better antiretroviral drugs and drugs for opportunistic infections, our prospects are improving for turning this disease into a chronic and manageable one. We need to pressure and encourage the federal government to provide an environment friendly to HIV research. This could include a specially designed package of incentives, including financial and tax incentives, to encourage adult and pediatric AIDS research. The federal research effort controlled by our NIH can and should be improved. As well, the FDA must be focused on reviewing and approving beneficial AIDS drugs as expediently as possible. If all Americans could fully appreciate the tragedy and consequences of the AIDS health epidemic, then congress and the administration would be more responsive to this crisis, that faces America and the World. </p>

<title>NATAP: FDA approves viral load test</title>
</head>

<h3>VIRAL LOAD --FDA approves test June 3, 1996</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Today, the FDA issued an approval of the Roche Diagnostic Amplicor test (also known as RT-PCR) which measures viral load. Myself and other community groups and individuals have been lobbying the FDA to approve this test. The FDA hearing to consider approval was held 2 months ago, and the HIV/AIDS community has been anxiously awaiting for approval with an adequate indication. Myself and other community advocates circulated to the community letters sent to the FDA, urging proper indications for approval of the assay.</p>

<p>The Intended Use section of the product package insert says, "The test is intended for use in conjunction with clinical presentation and other laboratory markers as an indicator of disease prognosis. The test has also been used as an aid in assessing viral response to antiretroviral treatment as measured by changes in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels."</p>

<P><b>FREE VIRAL LOAD TESTING</b>. Now that the FDA has approved the test, Roche Diagnostics is instituting a special access program. The Amplicor Access Program will offer two free HIV RNA baseline tests to all HIV-1 positive patients in the U.S. during the next 60 days, starting June 17. The toll-free hotline is 1-888- TEST PCR.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that the two tests available for measuring viral load - bDNA and RT-PCR - do not have common standards. Test results from one are not readily translated into the other. Consequently, it is generally recommended that once you start to use a particular RNA test - either PCR or bDNA - you should continue using the same test. Chiron Diagnostics has a viral load test called bDNA (branched DNA), which has been commercially available, and for which Chiron has applied for FDA approval. The currently available bDNA test measures as low as 10,000 copies, while the just approved RT-PCR test measures as low as 400 RNA copies. Chiron is developing a 2nd generation test that measures as low as 500 RNA copies, but it is not yet commercially available.</p>

<p>A comprehensive article about viral load will soon be available from the <a href="../index.html">NATAP home page</a>. It is a lengthy but wide-ranging discussion of important issues: how to use the test; how to interpret test results; data available-to-date supporting the correlation between viral load measures and clinical progression; an important talk about viral load by Dr. Robert Coombs; a discussion of two articles published just days ago which contain vital data and information about using viral load tests.</p>

<p>The two articles reviewed in the NATAP article are:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Prognosis in HIV-1 Infection Predicted by the Quantity of Virus in 
Plasma", (Mellors et al, Science, vol 272, 24 May 1996). The data from the study presented in this article correlates viral load measurements (of individuals who recently seroconverted) with clinical progression to AIDS and death, and compares the differences in progression rates between individuals with different viral load measures: under 4,500, from 4,500 to 13,000, 13,000 to 36,000 and over 36,000. Important summaries of this data are presented and discussed in the NATAP article.
<p>
<li>"HIV viral load markers in clinical practice", (Saag et al, Nature Medicine, vol 2, number 6, June 1996). This article presents guidelines from a panel of leading AIDS researchers and the International AIDS Society on how to use viral load tests and how to interpret results. As well, Dr. Coombs' discussion about these guidelines and his own editorials on these guidelines are reported.</p>

<title>NATAP: 1592U89--a new antiviral for HIV in development</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<a href="../index.html"><h4>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3>1592U89--a new antiviral for HIV in development 4/22/96</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>Glaxo Wellcome (GW) is developing a new promising antiviral AIDS drug. It is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor called 1592U89. Some of the pre-clinical claims by GW about this drug are: <ol>
<li>significant CNS penetration-- crosses blood-brain barrier in rat- 13%, in monkey-- 26% (by comparison, AZT crosses the BBB at the rate of 20-25%);
<li>in vitro synergy with AZT, 3TC, ddI, ddC-- and 2 protease inhibitors tested (GW's 141W94, Roche's saquinavir);
<li>no cross-resistance with AZT; and
<li>more than 70% bioavailability. 
</ol>

<p>GW is now planning a pediatric study and further adult studies; because of its CNS penetration, GW is planning a study of the drug's effects in AIDS dementia. Large-scale phase III trials are in the planning stages, and are expected to begin in 4th QTR. '96. </p>

<p>Mike Saag, MD, an AIDS researcher at the University of Alabama-Birmingham, is the lead investigator and has presented the results of an early study (protocol # 02) examining this drug. The trial studied adults with less than 12 weeks prior AZT experience--(only 1 subject had prior AZT-experience of 4 weeks); CD4 200-500; the subjects received 4 weeks 1592U89 monotherapy, to be followed by 8 weeks of 1592 combined with AZT or AZT-placebo, to which individuals are blinded and randomly assigned. Baseline-- CD4 cells 352 (range 219-466), median viral load 5.11 log (RT-PCR), (range 3.58-5.88). 4 different dose regimens are being examined: 200 3X/day--19 subjects, 400 3X/day--n=20, 300 2X/day--n=20, 600 3X/day--so far n=9. This trial was designed primarily to study safety and pharmacokinetics, but CD4 and viral load were also followed. </p>

<p>The 4th dose regimen group, 600 mg. 3X/day, is still recruiting, because all of the available slots have not yet been filled. If you are interested in participating, there is a consideration to bear in mind. There is not yet a provision for individuals to continue receiving 1592, after completing participation in the study; however, GW is in the process of trying to make this provision. For further information about participation, the following is a list of the 7 sites and the investigators at those sites to contact: Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Dr. Richard D'Aquila; ARCA in Atlanta, Dr. Melanie Thompson; University of Alabama--Birmingham, Dr. Mike Saag; University of Cincinnati, Dr. Judy Feinberg; University of Colorado in Denver, Dr. Chip Schooley; <a href="../../network/trials/hiv.html#svh-u89">St. Vincent's Medical Center in New York City</a>, Dr. Gabe Torres, VIRX in San Francisco, Dr. Bill Lang. </p>

<p>The data are still accumulating from this study, but below is some early information. Additional data will be presented at the Vancouver AIDS Conference in July, which will include data from the higher doses.</p>

<p>Median CD4 responses (n=19) for the dose regimen of 200 3X/day, at 4 weeks subjects randomized to AZT or AZT-placebo:</p>
<ul>
<dt>baseline - 352  CD4
<dt>4 weeks - 435  (increase of 83)
<dt>8 weeks - 474  (122 increase from baseline)
<dt>12 weeks - 450  (98 cell increase)
</ul>

<p>The range of CD4 increases at 4 weeks was from 30 to 160, and at 12 weeks was from 70-160.</p>

<p>As you can observe, this study population is a healthy, less-advanced group.</p>

<p>Median RNA PCR reductions from baseline (5.11 log, n=19):</p>
<ul>
<dt>1.3 log at 1 week, n=19
<dt>1.5 log at 2 weeks, n=15
<dt>1.75 log at 4 weeks, n=15
</ul>

<p>After 4 weeks, when subjects were randomized to AZT or AZT-placebo,  RNA reductions were:</p>

<ul>
<dt>1.8 log at 6 weeks, n=15
<dt>2.0 log at 8 weeks, n=14
<dt>2.0 log at 12 weeks, n=7
</ul>

<p>Study drug discontinuations:</p>
<ul>
<dt>1/19   for consent withdrawn
<dt>1/19  for adverse experience (fever, rash, paresthesia with reoccurrence upon re-challenge). 
</ul>

<p>Grade 3/4 lab toxicity:</p>
<ul>
<dt>1/19 for elevated liver enzymes--Alanine Aminotransferase elevation. 
</ul>

<p>Adverse event profile:</p>
<ul>
<dt>nausea, headache, asthenia, rash, dyspepsia, pruritus--most common
</ul>

<p>5 subjects agreed to have CSF samples collected: CSF concentration was 20% of plasma concentrations, which is about equal to AZT levels in CSF.</p>

<p><b>1592 and protease inhibitors</b><br>
1592 does not inhibit the CYP 450 liver enzyme system, so that makes it a more promising candidate for combination with protease inhibitors. GW may soon conduct an interaction study of 1592 and Crixivan. In preparation for the pre-accelerated approval phase III studies, appropriate studies may be conducted examining the safety of combining 1592 with available protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>As you may know, GW is developing 141W94, which is a protease inhibitor. Although it is in earlier stages of development, it is vital to the interests of people with AIDS or HIV, and particularly individuals with moderate or advanced HIV (who don't have the time to wait for the usual course of research, which is slow) that GW quickly initiate safety and efficacy studies examining the combination of 141W94 with all of the other available protease inhibitors--Invirase, Crixivan, Norvir and Viracept (Agouron). As well, the other protease inhibitor manufacturers also have a responsibility to initiate studies of their inhibitors with others. Abbott has initiated the study of ritonavir/saquinavir, but Merck and Roche have been slower to respond. It is important to our interests to discover, as soon as possible, the potential for these combinations, as well as to uncover any safety concerns. GW and the other drug companies are aware of these concerns and seem sympathetic to them, but the issue requires close follow-up. </p>

<p><b>Future trial plans</b><br>
GW is starting a new phase II trial of 1592, CNAB 2002, at 5 European sites (60 subjects) in France and Germany. The trial will be a 24 week monotherapy study after which subjects will be permitted to take any other approved medication open-label. It will study a variety of dosing regimens for the purpose of picking a dose for the phase III pivotal trials, which is expected to start in 4th QTR. '96. GW is now considering the study designs for phase III and whether they will allow for standard of care plus or minus 1592 (which means individuals would be permitted to take any approved antivirals of their choice with 1592 or 1592-placebo).</p>

<p>In July, a key phase II exploratory study will start, subject to FDA approval, which will examine combinations of 1592U89 with AZT, 3TC, ddI, and d4T in individuals, who have at least 6 months experience with these drugs (one year experience with AZT), and with CD4 greater than 100 and viral load greater than 30,000, as measured by RT-PCR; the dose regimen used will be 300 mg. 2X/daily. 40 individuals will be studied for safety and virology. GW wants to discover how individuals, with drug pre-treatment, and who may be resistant to AZT, ddI, 3TC or d4T, may respond to 1592 in combination with these other drugs. Virology studies will be conducted examining resistance profiles and viral load, for the purpose of examining antiviral activity. The trial will last 24 weeks at multiple sites, and probably after 4-weeks of 1592 treatment in combination with other therapy, individuals will be permitted to change their therapy taken along with 1592, but will continue to be followed.</p>

<p>Because of this drug's ability to penetrate the CSF, Glaxo is planning to initiate a trial hopefully this summer, to study clinically diagnosed mild to moderate AIDS dementia in about 90 subjects. After an initial period of 12 weeks, in which subjects will be randomized to 1592 or placebo, all will be offered open-label drug.</p>

<p>A single-dose pharmacokinetics study, with a liquid formulation, has been completed and it has established safety of 1592 for 2 different doses in children 3 months to 13 years. An ACTG protocol is being planned to study multiple doses in the same age group; about 36 children will be studied at multiple sites. Dr. Mark Klein, of the Texas Children's Hospital, will be the lead investigator. As well, a clinical endpoint study for children is planned for late '96 or early '97. Discussions are underway for a pharmacokinetics study in neonates.</p>

<p>Although the data accumulated to-date is promising, more research is necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of this drug. Since preliminary in vitro data shows that 1592 is not cross-resistant with AZT, and has very limited cross-resistance with ddI or ddC, a vital question remaining is--will individuals who are resistant to nucleosides and may have depleted its efficacy be able to transition into 1592 with full efficacy? It would be very important for individuals, who have few or no treatment options remaining, to be able to combine 1592 with a protease inhibitor. GW does not expect a production problem for future clinical trials or for post accelerated approval, which I estimate will not occur before June '97; however, our community is concerned about the timeliness of an expanded access program. Future discussions with GW will include this and other subjects, including the development plans for their protease inhibitor--141W94.</p>

<h3>Ritonavir: Important Information 4/5/96</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>On April 5, a group of community advocates, including myself, met with Abbott to discuss Norvir patient/doctor education, drug interactions, side effects and the upcoming trial of the combination of saquinavir and ritonavir.</p>

<p><b>Possible ways to reduce side effects</b><br>
Present were a couple of individuals taking ritonavir (Norvir) and Abbott's pharmacokinetics experts. Emerging from the discussion was that an individual's food intake can affect the magnitude of the side effects experienced. A high calorie, relatively fatty meal (for example, a meal including a steak) in the evening and at breakfast (eggs and bacon) may reduce the side effects experienced. Some individuals find that eating chocolate when taking Norvir may help. Also, eating a salty food, like potatoe chips may be helpful. </p>

<p>It is recommended by Abbott that dose escalation at the initial start-up of taking Norvir may also reduce the incidence of side effects, such as nausea. The dosing regimen they recommend is: 300 mg., twice daily, for 2 days; 400 mg., twice daily for 2 days; 500 mg. twice daily for 2 days; you can stay at the 500 mg. dose for a maximum of 6 days before moving to the 600 mg., twice daily dose; or, you may want to try the 600 mg., twice daily dose after only 2 days of the 500 mg., twice daily dose. It is recommended that you reach the full dose within 14 days. A slightly different dose escalation regimen is described in Abbott's package insert, based on their clinical trials, which is available at your pharmacy. Abbott said, this process will induce the liver to process the drug better; this dose escalation method provides adequate drug levels, at the initial stages of taking the Norvir, to suppress virus without the initially high drug levels associated with taking the 600 mg. dose. Therefore, Abbott is saying, although you are building up to the full recommended dose, you should not be concerned that you are sub-optimally dosing and creating resistance; the liver has to get used to the drug and the processing of it. </p>

<P>After taking the standard dose of Norvir (600 mg. 2 times per day), an individual's blood level of the drug rise up before starting to settle down. It is the high blood level, that may cause the side effects. It's been reported that some doctors may be experimenting with a different dose regimen that may reduce side effects--the common ones, such as nausea, dizziness, skin snsations, and circumoral paresthesia. The regimen they are using is 400 mg. of Norvir, 3 times per day. This reduces the higher blood levels acheived by the 600 mg. dose, and therefore might explain a possible reduction in side effects; a 400 mg. dose will not raise blood levels as high as a 600 mg. dose. </p>

<p><b>Drug interactions</b><br>
Abbott took the time and effort to take us through this difficult subject; and, to explain to us the extensive research they conducted in order to compile the drug interaction information, which they have submitted to the FDA and disseminated to the public. More extensive education for doctors and patients is required to adequately inform the public about drug interaction with Norvir, as well as with saquinavir and indinavir. Abbott agreed to increase their educational effort and to cooperate with NATAP and other community groups to disseminate the proper information.</p>

<p>A certain enzyme in the liver, named CYP450, is responsible for metabolizing or getting rid of foreign substances that may come into the body through drugs or food. Abbott conducted a systematic review of over 200 medications. </p>

<p>This review included 12 general classes of medications, and commonly used AIDS drugs. They reviewed metabolism and pharmacokinetic literature, review articles, test references, package inserts, in vitro data from ritonavir studies, and clinical interaction data from other drugs with similar metabolic pathways as ritonavir. Their conclusions are based on theoretical judgements and drug interaction studies. Abbott said they took a proactive position from the very beginning in their committment to research drug interactions, and they said it was unprecedented for a drug company to conduct such extensive research and put so much information on their package insert. </p>

<p>This review process is ongoing and they said there are limitations to their predictive abilities. When a foreign substance or drug is processed by the CYP 450 enzyme, there are 8 different important isoforms which may be involved in the process. Norvir effects just a few of these isoforms. Sometimes, it is uncertain which isoform processes a drug or foreign substance; if multiple isoforms are involved in the process, it may be uncertain the degree of effect by each one. Abbott explained that the inhibition of this liver enzyme, which is what makes Norvir effective, is reversible upon cessation of Norvir use.</p>

<p>Abbott has compiled a <a href="norvir.html">list of 23 drugs NOT to be coadministered</a> (not to be taken) with Norvir. Accompanying this list are potential alternatives, although some may not be therapeutically equivalent. Also, each Norvir gel-cap contains an amount of alcohol that is almost one ounce, so an individual should not take Norvir with antabuse. Antabuse is an alcohol antagonist, used by individuals as an aid in stopping alcohol abuse.</p>

<p>In some cases, it may be more important to stabilize an individual on their HIV-antiviral therapy as a priority to other medications, such as anti-depressants. </p>

<p>Coadministration of Norvir with some of these drugs may result in potentially serious and/or life threatening adverse events. Precautions should be taken when coadministering Norvir with other drugs metabolized by similar pathways. Large dose reductions and increased monitoring of drug blood levels and adverse events is recommended when these drugs are used concomitantly (taken together) with ritonavir (Norvir). </p>

<p>We are now entering the hay-fever season. Two popular cold and allergy medications, Hismanal and Seldane, are on this list; these two medications are NOT to be given or coadministered with ritonavir (Norvir).</p>

<p>The Norvir package insert includes a drug-drug interaction chart (Table 2) which summarizes the effects of coadministration of ritonavir with a variety of drugs. It shows the effects on AUC and C-max with 95% confidence intervals.</p>

<p>Table 3 in the package insert lists 28 classes of drugs and many individual drugs and the potential effects on these drugs when co-administered with Ritonavir.</p>

<p><b>Patient education</b><br>
The meeting was amicable as both Abbott representatives and our community advocates were agreeable on the appropriate concerns and potential solutions. Abbott is undertaking additional efforts to educate doctors and patients regarding the proper use of Norvir. Issues that need attention for educational purposes include effectively comunicating the importance of compliance for individuals taking a protease inhibitor; without proper compliance with recommended dosing guidelines, resistance is a sure bet. For example, missing a dose or taking less than the full dose can lead to resistance. </p>

<P>NATAP's "Protease Inhibitor Report, 2nd edition" is now available. It is a 43-page bound booklet compiling all the latest data available on 5 protease inhibitors. It includes charts, graphs and an extensive chart compiling what we know to-date about resistance mutations. Individuals can order it for themselves or organizations can order it to use use as an educational tool for case managers, treatment educators and clients; when ordering please give us your mailing address for delivery:</p>

</ul>

<p>In Los Angeles, on Saturday April 13, NATAP held a free 4-hour community treatment forum at Paramount Pictures Studio (5555 Melrose Ave--enter at Bronson Street gate). The forum was devoted to PROTEASE INHIBITORS and VIRAL LOAD. Scientists from each of the protease inhibitor manufacturers participated --Roche, Merck, Abbott, Glaxo Wellcome, and Agouron-- to present data and discuss their protease inhibitor. Also, Dr. Robert Coombs of the University of Washington, an expert on viral load, discussed what we know about the use and application of this test, including how an individual can interpret test results and apply it to their personal situation. Much of the discussion was devoted to compliance issues, side effects and drug interactions for each of the 3 approved protease inhibitors. If you didn't attend, we videotaped the entire event. To order the videotape, you can contact NATAP. The video can be used by individuals for their personal use or as an educational tool by doctors' offices, hospitals and AIDS community service organizations for their case managers, treatment educators and clients. </p>

<p><b>Ritonavir/saquinavir combination study</b><br>
Abbott has issued the following statement: "There is a great deal of interest in combination therapy with ritonavir and saquinavir based on pharmacokinetic interactions that result in substantial elevation in plasma saquinavir levels. Although this interaction holds therapeutic promise, the safe use of this combination has not been established. Because of the magnitude of this interaction, a reduction in dose of either or both drugs may be necessary.</p>

<P>The optimal doses of each drug in this combination are being determined in clinical trials underway, with early data expected to be available by mid-summer 1996. In the absence of adequate clinical data, ritonavir and saquinavir doses that are safe and effective in combination are unknown. Until these data are available, this combination should not be used.</p>

<p>"The potential disadvantages of premature ritonavir-saquinavir combination therapy are: (1) safety concern--incorrect dose combinations may result in dangerous drug levels not previously tested in man; (2) efficacy concern-- incorrect dose combinations may result in sub-optimal antiviral efficacy and decrease future response to protease inhibitor therapy."</p>

<p>These cautions make sense to me--especially, the efficacy concern; if you use a dose combination that is too low, you could create resistance to the combination.</p>

<p><b>THE STUDY</b><br>
Abbott and Roche are collaborating in a multicenter (7 sites), open-label, randomized study --120 HIV-Infected individuals -- both, drug experienced and naive are included -- CD4 100-500. The study is expected to start in mid-April.</p>

<p>As always, it is advisable to consult with your physician before making any treatment decisions, and to bring to your doctor the Norvir package insert and discuss all these concerns with him. Saquinavir and indinavir also inhibit the CYP 450 liver emzyme, although not as strongly. These two drugs also have drug interaction concerns. If you are taking or plan to take saquinavir or indinavir, you should have the same discussion with your doctor.</p>

<h3>Delavirdine Expanded Access, April 4, 1996</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Pharmacia & Upjohn announced on April 1, that it has begun supplying its anti-HIV investigational drug <a href="../../network/simple/dela.html">delavirdine (Rescriptor)</a> to patients in the United States through an <a href="../../network/trials/hiv.html#pu">expanded access program</a>. Delavirdine is a member of the new antiretroviral class called <a href="../../network/simple/nnrtis.html">non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors</a> (NNRTIs) for the treatment of HIV.</p>

<p>Criteria for qualification:</p>
<ul>
<li>300 CD4 or less

<li>not sick in the hospital, when applying for expanded access
</ul>

<p>For information about receiving drug through expanded access, Upjohn is requesting that your physician call: 1-800-779-0070.</p>

<p>Delavirdane is a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor. As well, Abbott's <a href="../../network/simple/riton.html">ritonavir</a> (protease inhibitor) is a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor. Therefore, there is concern about coadministration of delavirdine with certain other drugs. Upjohn has supplied us with a list of potential drug interactions. Interaction studies have been performed with certain drugs while with others they have not yet been performed. Following is information about drug interactions and delavirdine. This information was supplied by Upjohn and is directly quoted from their papers; you should consult with your physician about this following information.</p>

<p>For this first group, Upjohn has actually conducted drug interaction studies.</p>

<p>Upjohn says: "These medications have been shown to <b>decrease</b> the plasma concentrations of delavirdine through induction of metabolism:</p>

<title>NATAP: FDA Advisory Hearings 3/1/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<a href="../index.html"><h4 align=center>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3>Merck and Abbott FDA Advisory Panel Hearings, Feb. 28-March 1, 1996</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>My hope is that these hearings will be an historic moment in time that we can look back on and say, this was an important part of the sequence of events that marked a turning point in the fight against treating HIV. Both Abbott's Norvir (ritonavir) and Merck's Crixivan (indinavir) were granted approvals, although not without a tension-filled struggle over Norvir (described <a href="#abbott">below</a>). After almost 2 years of struggling with Roche, Merck, and Abbott over access and development issues, finally ritonavir, indinavir and saquinavir will be available (saquinavir was approved and available in December).</p>

<p>Abbott's ritonavir was approved by the FDA, as of March 1. The indication: full (traditional) approval for mono- and combination therapy for adults with advanced disease, and accelerated approval for adults when treatment for HIV is warranted. The label will say-- for advanced disease, the approval is based on study #247, which provides 6 months median follow-up, and indicates a reduction in both mortality and AIDS defining clinical events for individuals receiving Norvir. Use of ritonavir for less advanced individuals is based on surrogate marker data; for individuals receiving Norvir alone or in combination,; the clinical benefits are yet unknown.</p>

<p>The indication for Merck's indinavir will likely be: accelerated approval of mono- and combination therapy for the treatment of HIV infection in adults when therapy is warranted. This indication is based on surrogate marker data for individuals receiving indinavir alone or in combination.</p>

<p>Going into the hearings, our goal was not to have either of the indications restricted in any way, by CD4 or any other restrictive language, such as for advanced disease, etc. We succeeded, as both indications have no such restrictions. The decision of when to treat and how to treat remains between the doctor and patient, as it mostly should. I made this a crucial issue at the hearings, as I presented 40 supporting letters (including e-mails I received) from people with AIDS and AIDS organizations from around the US and the world; I expressed demands that it would be unacceptable to have "artificial" barriers created by FDA language such as: approved only for individuals with advanced disease or CD4 counts under 200. Most other advocates at the meeting wholly supported this notion. It wasn't easy to win this point because some Advisory panel members wanted to install such limitations, and the FDA appeared to waver on this issue, although at the November hearings for 3TC, saquinavir and d4T, the always equivocating FDA supported this notion.</p>

<p><b><a name="expanded">Expanded</a> access</b>. For 9 months we struggled with both Abbott and Merck to convince them to conduct expanded access programs for individuals with low CD4. Unfortunately, it wasn't as easy as we hoped to distribute the drug to individuals. As of today, Merck announced at their hearing that drug for 900 people has been shipped, and Abbott announced drug for 400 had been shipped through their expanded access/lottery programs. Both companies had each committed themselves to supplying drug for about 1,200 (for a total of 2,400) individuals with under 50 CD4. The enormous task of quickly distributing the drugs was vastly underestimated by both the companies and activists.</p> 

<p><b><a name="future">Future</a> considerations</b>. We now need to look ahead to different issues. The first priority is the need to educate doctors and consumers, to create a better and broader understanding of the optimal and safest way to use these drugs--taking into consideration resistance, cross-resistance, side effects and drug interactions. We need future studies to address many concerns still remaining:</p>

<ul>
<li>when is the best time to begin treatment (early intervention and sero-conversion studies--pilot sero-conversion studies are ongoing);
<li>we need to optimize our understanding of different multi-drug combinations;
<li>treatment switching studies triggered by changes in viral load and CD4 ought to be considered;
<li>combining of two protease inhibitors in one therapy needs full exploration;
<li>we need to better understand resistance and cross-resistance;
<li>maternal transmission, neonate and pediatric studies are needed utilizing protease inhibitors;
<li>further efficacy and safety studies examing long-term use of protease inhibitor therapies are needed;
<li>studies combining immune-based therapies (e.g., IL-2) with protease inhibitors and other antivirals are needed; and
<li>studies examing the sequential use of protease inhibitors are needed. 
</ul>

<p>At the FDA hearings, community representatives gathered to address these needs, as all present signed a consensus statement requesting an effort to address them.</p>

<p>Abbott's protease inhibitor, ritonavir or Norvir, has been sitting in their warehouse waiting for approval. I've been told by retail pharmaceutical sources that it may be available in some pharmacies as early as Monday March 4. The wholesale price for a month's supply of Norvir is about $530 or $6360/yearly. Saquinavir's wholesale price is about $5,800/yearly. The FDA said at the hearings that as soon as Merck is ready for their launch, FDA will approve indinavir. Merck is not yet ready for distribution; I expect within 2 to 4 weeks indinavir will be available. The sources for availability and distribution have yet to be determined. There are some concerns that Merck may not be able to meet demand.</p>

<p><b><a name="new">New</a> drug indications</b>. In light of the results recently reported from ACTG Study 175, Delta Trials, CPCRA 007 and ACTG Study 152, a full day hearing was devoted to consideration of changes in the indication for ddI as monotherapy, and new indications were considered for the use of the combinations of AZT/ddI and of AZT/ddC. These discussions will also have important repercussions for people with HIV and AIDS. The labeling changes are emblematic of the new era we are entering for HIV treatment. Below is a report of the discussions on each of the three separate hearing days for each of the three topics.</p>

<p><b><a name="cross">Cross</a>-resistance</b>. Before discussing the hearings, 2 events at the hearings reflected on cross-resistance related to saquinavir and indinavir. Noel Roberts, a virologist with Hoffman-La Roche, presented to a small community meeting data for 13 patients, 12 of whom exhibited no cross-resistance to indinavir (but they displayed the 48 and 90 mutations) after at least 6 months of saquinavir treatment. Roche concluded that saquinavir does not compromise future treatment with indinavir. Afterwards, Emilio Emini, a virologist at Merck Labs, said this issue can only be settled with a clinical study. During the Abbott hearing, Doug Mayers, an AIDS and resistance researcher at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, said---1 year saquinavir treatment, for 90% of the individuals' virus he studied, did not display cross-resistance to indinavir; they displayed more cross-resistance to ritonavir.</p>

<p>We need a formal study as an attempt to finally resolve this issue. In fact, the ACTG is planning a study that will address this concern. Individuals who were subjects in ACTG 229 (a saquinavir study), with at least 6 months prior saquinavir therapy, will be randomized to either Crixivan or the new more potent saquinavir formulation.</p>

<h4><a name="abbott">Abbott</a> hearing on Thursday February 29</h4>

<p>David Feigal started the day by delivering opening remarks and announcing it was the 8th birthday of the FDA department he runs which oversees the review and approval of AIDS antiretroviral drugs--the Division of Antiviral Drug Products. John Leonard of Abbott presented their data to the FDA Advisory Committee and an audience of about 300-400, primarily composed of representatives from various drug companies, advocates and activists, press, financial analysts, and other government officials.</p>

<p>A comprehensive review of the data from Abbott's and Merck's studies is available in NATAP's 43-page compilation of the data for 5 protease inhibitors, which includes a review of the protease inhibitor data presented at the 3rd Retrovirus Conference of Jan. 28 1996. Also available is a 4-hour videotape of the NATAP Protease Inhibitor Community Forum--"Protease Inhibitors: Current and Future Use". Other protease inhibitor reports (a review and commentary of protease inhibitor data and information from the 3rd Retrovirus Conference held Jan. 28, in Washington, D.C.) are listed on the <a href="index.html">home page</a>.</p>

<p>Leonard presented the data from phase I/II studies. Abbott study M93-112/M94-169 indicated peak 2 log reductions in viral load by 8 weeks. At 32 weeks, the combined doses of 500 and 600 mg/2x-day showed a sustained median viral load drop of 1 log, but the 500 mg. dose underperformed the 600 mg. dose, probably because of the onset of resistance. If you separate the viral load reductions at 32 weeks of 500 mg. from 600 mg., you can expect the 600 mg. dose to perform better than a 1 log reduction. The median CD4 improvements from baseline were about 150 at 16 weeks.</p>

<p><b>Abbott study #247</b>. This is the 1,090 person trial of individuals with under 100 CD4. The 4-month data from this study indicate a 42% reduction in death and a 58% reduction in death or progression to AIDS. This is the most dramatic and impressive survival (clinical) data we have seen to date. Unexpectedly and impressively, Abbott presented data on about 75 study participants indicating the RNA reduction at 16 weeks was sustained out to 32 weeks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the study design dictated individuals remain on the same antiretroviral therapy for 4 months, until the ritonavir placebo arm was crossed over to receive ritonavir. Leonard pointed out this is not the optimal way to use a protease inhibitor. Optimally, you want each drug in your combination to have as much efficacy as possible. That means, when initiating therapy with a protease inhibitor, the other drugs used in the combination should also be newly initiated. The peak RNA reduction was 1.4 log at 2 weeks, and by 16 weeks it had returned to .6 log. This could have been due to the study rule that a participant must remain on the same therapies (you could say, in effect, study subjects were taking ritonavir monotherapy), and also because the study population was a very advanced disease group: the average CD4 was 28, and 25% had CD4 10 or below.</p>

<p><b>Abbott study #245</b>. This trial examined AZT-naive individuals with CD4 above 200 and RNA above 15,000. Their baseline CD4 was about 360 and RNA 4.84 log. For the treatment group on ritonavir monotherapy, the RNA reduction was 1.2 at both 2 and 16 weeks, and the CD4 increase was 70 at 8 weeks and 80 at 16 weeks; the combination arm of ritonavir/AZT showed a RNA reduction of 1.1 at week 2 and 1.0 at 16 weeks, and a CD4 increase of 40 and 30 at weeks 8 and 16. There was what was called a "disconnect" between these 2 treatment arms; both the CD4 and RNA benefits were greater for the ritonavir monotherapy group than for the ritonavir/AZT group and there was a high rate of discontinuation (39%) in the ritonavir/AZT arm. Leonard blamed this "disconnect" on poor compliance by the study subjects. These were AZT naive individuals so, he said, the combination of taking AZT for the first time (for a relatively healthy group -- 350 CD4) and ritonavir's distasteful liquid formula caused the poor compliance. In fact, at some point during the study, Abbott tested for the ritonavir levels in study subjects; they discovered the levels in the ritonavir/AZT arm to be significantly lower than for those in the ritonavir monotherapy arm.</p>

<p><b>Abbott study #208</b>. This was a small 32 person, open-label, 3-drug, AZT-naive trial (50-250 CD4) in France. Individuals were treated with AZT/ddC/ritonavir. The median RNA declines were 2.5 to 2.9 log at 6 months; and the median CD4 increases were over 250 at 6 months. Although small in numbers, this study best displays the optimal way to use ritonavir.</p>

<p><b>Abbott study #313</b>. Although it just started and there isn't yet much data, it examines treatment of 12 individuals, with a 3-drug intervention of AZT/3TC/ritonavir at sero-conversion (within 120 days of infection). For 6 subjects at 60 days, 4/6 have undetectable virus; 2/6 have increasingly lower viral load with declines of 1.6 to 2.5 log. </p>

<p>The side effects and drug interactions from treatment with Norvir are a concern. Abbott has a list of <a href="../network/simple/riton.html">25 drugs</a> that are not to be co-administered with Norvir, Additionally, there are other drugs for which concomitant use with ritonavir, will probably dictate dose modifications of the other drug or ritonavir. For the drugs not to be co-administered with ritonavir, there are usually substitute drugs that can be administered. A comprehensive educational effort is necessary, directed to both doctors and people with HIV or AIDS, to properly inform the concerned public about how to use the drug properly. Abbott has agreed to work closely with community leaders in publishing information and disseminating it. This collaborative effort will start soon, because the drug will start to be available very soon. </p>

<p>From the phase I/II study, the side effect profile detected was: liver enzymes, cholesterol and triglycerides increased significantly during week 1. Elevations in cholesterol and triglycerides persisted through 32 weeks of the study. There were increases from baseline of 30 to 40% for cholesterol and of 200 to 300% for triglycerides. The presence of a positive antigen for Hepatitis B or C for an individual at baseline increases the likelihood of hepatic related lab abnormalities with ritonavir treatment. The incidence of liver enzymes lab abnormalities increases 13%, if one is positive for the Hepatitis B Ag and 18% for the presence of the Hepatitis C Ag.</p>

<p>Leonard then listed future studies they are planning, which include a 4-drug study. </p>

<p>Finally, Abbott's ongoing <a href="../network/trials/children.html#riton">pediatric study</a> was presented. It is a phase I/II multi-dose trial being conducted at the National Cancer Institute and in Florida. Two age groups are being examined: 6 months to 2 years old; 2 to 18 years; this group is further stratified -- 2 to 12 years and individuals 18 years. For safety purposes, ritonavir monotherapy is initiated for 12 weeks, after which AZT/ddI or 1 of 2 agents can be added. Both treatment-naive and experienced individuals are eligible. So far, 15 to 20 subjects have been enrolled. Only one subject has been removed from the study, due to elevated liver enzymes. Lymph node biopsies may be planned. </p>

<p><b>Advisory committee</b>. After the company presentation was the start of what I think were unprecedented proceedings. Some committee members admitted they didn't know, prior to the hearing, that Abbott's application was for full approval; many committee members displayed a lack of knowledge of the accelerated approval regulations; and, although the FDA and Abbott worked together in planning their studies, there seemed to be a communication disconnect between FDA, Abbott and the committee. The committee discussed the issues for hours and were unwilling to grant the approvals. Kessler, who was present for the entire proceedings on both days, and Feigal were constantly intervening to try and guide the committee. Obviously, Kessler and Feigal wanted the committee to grant the approvals, but the committee wouldn't cooperate. Finally, at 8 PM, the committee was coaxed by Feigal and Kessler into recommending full approval for advanced disease (based on #247) and a conditional accelerated approval for less advanced infection. The condition was based on Abbott presenting plans for long-term studies, to the FDA, examining safety and durability of benefits. </p>

<p>The committee set an early tone, in the hearing, by persistently focusing on concern about the side effects and drug interactions associated with ritonavir treatment. The community speakers in the open session followed suit. The committee demanded a study examining durability of benefits. You could say this demand was made, because of any or all of the following: (1) the relatively small size of the NDA booklet presented by Abbott, (2) a deservedly cautionary approach to the side effects and drug interactions, (3) by a committee that was encouraged by the community presentations in the open public commentary session; about 15 community representatives, each excessively warning of their concerns about side effects, drug interactions, of how the 6-month data was insufficient, and that Abbott was a company that should not be trusted. It seemed to me, that the committee was confused and lost sight of our primary objective, which was to make the drug available to people with HIV or AIDS. At some points, during the Abbott hearing, many of us were concerned that the committee would refuse to recommend approval. Their was too much focus on criticism of Abbott and Norvir, while not adequately emphasizing the absolute necessity of approving the drug.</p>

<p>It seemed that everyone forgot about the indisputable clinical data from #247; and the extension of some clinical data out to 32 weeks, for about 75 subjects. Additionally, the surrogate marker data from #245 was more than adequate to support accelerated approval. There were some concerns about the "disconnect" between the ritonavir monotherapy and the ritonavir/AZT groups, with regards to RNA reductions and CD4 increases.</p> 

<p>At 8 PM, the room was emptied except for Abbott and the FDA. The following day after the Merck hearing had ended, Kessler and Feigal announced a deal had been reached with Abbott. Reportedly, the FDA and Abbott stayed in the room until 11 PM working out a deal. The following was committed to by Abbott in a letter to the FDA, which was distributed to us:</p>

<ol>
<li>"Abbott agrees to provide additional data on patients treated for longer periods of time to study durability of response, and conduct pediatric studies",
<li>Abbott will provide "long-term follow-up safety and clinical endpoint data from studies #245 and #247 to assess the comparative clinical efficacy and safety data in patients with advanced stage disease vs. patients with early stage disease",
<li>Abbott "commits to participating in defining the safety and efficacy of ritonavir in pediatric patients",
<li>"in a study comparing ritonavir/saquinavir to ritonavir for individuals with 100 CD4, they agree to provide data examining durability of response by evaluating CD4 response, RNA response and safety." 
</ol>

<p>You might say, in the end, it all worked out. Although the committee was confused and over-reacted, we received from Abbott commitments to conduct worthwhile studies. The pediatric study probably would have been conducted anyway, but the long-term follow-up of #245, #247 and the saquinavir/ritonavir combination may not have been forthcoming, although I'm not sure that using #245 and #247 in this way is the optimal way to gather this type of long-term data. In the same announcement, Kessler told us of (1) President Clinton's request to Congress for an additional $52 million for ADAP (I am told that to properly cover costs for protease inhibitors, an additional $75 million is needed on top of the $52 million); and (2) the reviews of ritonavir (72 days) and indinavir (29 days) are the fastest approvals of any AIDS drugs so far. As you may know, the FDA is under intense scrutiny by Congress, industry, and patient advocacy groups, for the purposes of making Congressionally dictated FDA reforms. </p>

<p>Again, ritonanir, or Norvir, was approved for mono- and combination therapy for individuals with advanced disease, based on the 6 months follow-up data from study #247, which indicates reduced mortality and progression to AIDS for those receiving Norvir. For less advanced individuals, approval is based on surrogate markers (CD4 and viral load); there isn't any clinical endpoint data for this population.</p> 

<h4><a name="merck">Merck</a> hearing on Friday March 1</h4>

<p>This hearing was a cakewalk compared to the Abbott hearing, but there were still difficulties. For example, when the Advisory committee was first asked if they believed the data supported accelerated approval for Crixivan, 3 or 4 members said no. Following will be a brief review of the presentation by Jeff Chodakewitz, the head of clinical trials at Merck for Crixivan. </p>

<p>Over 2,000 individuals have been treated with indinavir at the currently recommended dose of 2.4 grams/day (800 mg.--3x/day). A few individuals have been treated for over 26 months.</p>

<p>Studies of particular interest that were presented include from phase III: #035--AZT/3TC/indinavir, #028--the Brazil AZT-naive clinical endpoint study of AZT/indinavir, #033--the US AZT-naive surrogate marker study of AZT/indinavir; and from phase II: #019--an AZT-naive surrogate marker study of AZT/indinavir. The data from #028 and #033 were never before publicly presented, however #035, #019 and others are reviewed in my other reports and video. Summaries of the data are available from the <a href="index.html">NATAP homepage</a>. Additionally, the NATAP 43-page protease inhibitor booklet reviews all protease inhibitor data and information to-date; it is being updated to include this newly presented data and is available by contacting NATAP's office--phone: 718 (624-8541, fax: (718) 624-8399, <a href="mailto:julev@aol.com">e-mail</a>.</p>

<p>For the <b>Merck Study #028</b>, the clinical endpoint data is not yet available, but the surrogate marker data was presented. 750 AZT-naive subjects were enrolled with CD4 between 50-250, and 224 of those 750 were included in the surrogate marker (core cohort) analysis of which 25% were women. The baseline RNA and CD4 were 29,000 (4.6 log) and 139 for the core cohort. The RNA reduction for AZT/indinavir was about 1.3 log at 4 and 12 weeks and was well sustained at 24 weeks. 40% of subjects were below the level of RNA detectability at 24 weeks; CD4 increases were 100 at 8 weeks and sustained at 24 weeks. The RNA and CD4 improvements were about the same for both the AZT/indinavir and the indinavir monotherapy arms of the study.</p>

<p>The <b>Merck Study #033</b> enrolled 742 AZT-naive subjects with 50-250 CD4; 266 subjects were in the surrogate marker analysis presented; baseline CD4 and RNA were 258 and 22,000 for the core cohort. The RNA reductions for the AZT/indinavir arm were 1.5 log at 12 weeks and 1.3 at 24 weeks. The CD4 increase was 100 at 12 weeks and sustained at 24 weeks. For the indinavir monotherapy arm the CD4 and RNA benefits were about equal to the AZT/indinavir arm. The FDA and the committee referred to this as a "disconnect." You might expect AZT, when combined with indinavir, would perform better than indinavir alone. Ed Scolnick, President of Merck Labs, said this may have been due to the toxicity of AZT. Also, it may have been due to poor AZT compliance for individuals who had never before taken AZT; or, maybe many study subjects lied to gain entry to the study and were actually AZT-experienced. For the AZT/indinavir group, 50% had undetectable viral load at 24 weeks; for the indinavir arm, 40% remained undetectable at 24 weeks. </p>

<p><b>Merck Study #035</b> examined individuals treated with AZT/3TC/indinavir, with 50-400 CD4, minimum 6 months AZT-experience, but 3TC-naive. The baseline CD4 and RNA were 39,000 and 142. The 3-drug combination RNA reductions were 2 logs at 8 weeks and 2.3 at 24 weeks; the indinavir monotherapy arm RNA reductions were 1.5 log at 12 weeks and .7 log at 24 weeks (the number of subjects upon which the .7 at 24 weeks was based was 20); the AZT/3TC arm RNA reductions were 1.25 log at 2 weeks and .7 at 24 weeks. The number of individuals at 24 weeks is about 22. The proportion of subjects with RNA below detectability were 90% at 24 weeks for the 3-drug combination, and 40% at 24 weeks for the indinavir monotherapy group. For the CD4 increase, again there was a "disconnect;" increases were about 100 CD4 at 24 weeks for the 3-drug combination and 80 for the indinavir mono- group. Merck displayed a chart indicating "48-week Responses to Indinavir Change in CD4 and Viral RNA" for their #021 study. At 48 weeks, the CD4 increase was about 80, and the viral RNA reduction was about 2.5 log; the number of subjects at 24 weeks, upon which the chart was based, was 12.</p>

<p>As you can see, results can be variable between studies; when studies are based on a small number of participants, the results can vary from one study to the other. Accelerated approval is based upon early data from studies examing such small numbers of individuals. Accelerated approval was instituted to allow access to promising treatments, such as Crixivan and Norvir, based on surrogate marker data; it was instituted because AIDS activists lobbied the FDA to allow earlier access than would be permitted by traditional approval.</p>

<p>Without accelerated approval and expanded access, individuals would not be able to access Norvir or Crixivan outside the confines of a randomized clinical trial. Of course accessing drugs, as in this case, under accelerated approval means doing so without having a fuller set of data upon which to base your decisions. For traditional (or full) approval, a clinical endpoint study must be completed, analyzed, and indicate statistically significant data depicting extension of survival and delays in progression to AIDS. However, many researchers feel that viral load may be an effective measure of the correlation between treatment effect and survival or progression to AIDS; this means an adequate and sustained reduction in viral load could indicate prolonged survival and delayed progression to AIDS. If we eventually are able to rely on that measure of disease progression, the goal of long-term studies may be narrowed to safety and durability of benefits. </p>

<p>Crixivan (indinavir) was recommended for approval of mono- and combination therapy for any individual with HIV infection, when treatment is warranted. This approval is based on surrogate marker benefits (CD4 and viral load). Clinical endpoint data is not yet available. </p>

<h4><a name="ddi">ddI</a>, AZT/ddI and AZT/ddC</h4>

<p>On the first day, February 28, of this 3-day event, a hearing was held to consider changing the indication for the use of ddI as monotherapy and for the use of AZT/ddC in combination; also, the committee considered establishing an indication for AZT/ddI, as currently it has no indication. The data from 4 important studies were reviewed for the purposes of the FDA setting the indications for use.</p>

<p>Currently, ddI is approved for treatment of adults with HIV, when intolerant to AZT monotherapy, may no longer be benefitting from AZT, or received prolonged prior AZT therapy. "This indication is based on the results of a randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial comparing 2 doses of ddI and AZT in subjects, with a median CD4 of 95 and with median prior AZT experience of 13.7 months (range: 3-61). ddI is also indicated for treatment of advanced infection, in the adult and pediatric populations, who demonstrated intolerance to AZT or significant clinical or immunological deterioration during AZT therapy. This indication is based primarily on the results of non-randomized, phase I studies in which an increase in CD4 was observed for many subjects on ddI therapy," as stated in the label.</p>

<p>The Advisory Committee recommended that ddI be approved for initial or first-line therapy, based on clinical endpoint data (reduced mortality and progression to AIDS) for which AZT is approved, but the committee was unable to agree that AZT/ddI was any more effective than ddI as monotherapy based on the clinical endpoint data before them. The committee was able to agree that the AZT/ddC combination ought to be recommended to the FDA for approval for AZT-naive, but not for AZT-experienced individuals, based on the clinical endpoint data before them.</p>

<p>Currently, the combination of AZT/ddC is approved "for selected patients with advanced disease (CD4 less than 300)," as stated on the label. For AZT-naive individuals, it is based on CD4 improvements maintained longer than for individuals receiving AZT mono-. For AZT-experienced individuals, the approved indication is based "on a sugroup analysis of clinial data that showed a clinical benefit only for individuals with a CD4 count greater than 150, at the initiation of therapy. No benefit was observed for AZT-experienced individuals with CD4 less than 150, and therefore AZT/ddC is not currently recommended for these individuals." Many activists have questioned the validity of this latter interpretation of the AZT/ddC data for AZT-experienced individuals, upon which the existing indication is based; they question whether benefits in this population (greater than 150) were actually realized. Apparently, the final determinations of these issues will return to the FDA.</p>

<p>The 4 studies, whose data were presented and discussed were: ACTG 175, the Delta Trials, CPCRA 007, ACTG 152 (a pediatric study). This report will not review the data from these studies; but, the important message is, that for the first time a survival benefit has been detected from treatment of individuals in the mid-stages of disease. ACTG 175 examined individuals in the CD4 range of 200-500; the data indicated that, for AZT-naive individuals, ddI, AZT/ddI and AZT/ddC prolonged survival and delayed progression to AIDS, when compared to individuals receiving AZT mono-. For AZT-experienced individuals, the data wasn't as convincing, but indicated that ddI and AZT/ddI reduced mortality and progression to AIDS, when compared to individuals receiving AZT mono-. Although it's never been established that AZT mono-, when used to treat individuals in that mid-CD4 range of disease stage, prolongs survival, researchers have assumed that AZT mono- is too weak a therapy, and that the onset of resistance prevents longer-term benefit in that mid-range population.</p>

<p>Once the FDA approves a therapy, it becomes easier for some individuals to access the treatment; insurance carriers are more likely to pay for approved medications and many physicians are more likely to prescribe a treatment only after its received full approval.</p> 

<h4><a name="rna">HIV</a> RNA testing and FDA approval</h4>

<p>As you may know, the data on HIV RNA testing has been quickly accumulating for both prognosis and monitoring treatment effect. Aside from data that have been accumulating from numerous other studies (ACTG 175, Delta, etc.), data were presented at the 3rd Retrovirus Conference this January by John Mellors and Upjohn supporting the utility of these tests. Chiron Diagnostics has submitted an application to the FDA for accelerated approval of their viral load test--bDNA. Chiron has 2 tests: the more sensitive 2nd generation one measures as low as 500 copies; the other only measures as low as 10,000 copies. It is uncertain which test the FDA may approve. Roche Diagnostics filed their application for accelerated approval to the FDA in November 1995. The indication originally applied for was prognosis. It is my understanding that the applications have been ammended to include an indication for treatment effect monitoring. Of course, the data required for each indication has some differences. March 21 is the scheduled date for the FDA Advisory Committees hearing for these applications. There is wide support in our community for these tests to be approved and available as soon as possible. However, the FDA will not approve the tests until the data has been compiled, analyzed, and is convincing. Additionally, testing precision, re-producibility, and standardization of methods are important parameters to the FDA in validating the tests.</p>

<h4>ADVISORY</h4>

<p>With the availability of 3 protease inhibitors, individuals will be considering treatment changes. Before making any treatment decisions, it is advisable that an individual consult with a knowledgable physician.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Community meeting with Merck on 2/26</h3>

<blockquote><p>A small group of community representatives met with Merck officials just prior to their appointed hearing date before the FDA Antiviral Drug Advisory Committee meeting.</p>

<p>Dr. Ed Scolnick, President of Merck Research Labs, convened the meeting by relating an anecdote about the initial experiments that led to the development of their protease inhibitor, indinavir. He said, in 1985 Merck experimented with cell cultures and a prototype protease inhibitor. When mixing HIV infected cells with uninfected cells and this prototype inhibitor, they first discovered that it blocked the spread of the virus. He said, they hoped to be able to make the perfect protease inhibitor, but the chemistry was too difficult.</p>

<p>He then mentioned that 1 patient, who started on a sub-optimal dose, but was switched to the currently recommended dose, has remained with a very low RNA for 2 years now. He started on monotherapy, but has since added therapy. Some may consider it acceptable to relate a best case scenario, because it may give an idea of the possibilities for an individual, and therefore evoke hope; but it may be unrealistic, and therefore unfair, to the larger masses of people who won't be as responsive; it may also be considered misleading by some observers, because very few may respond this well. The fact is that very few individuals have been taking the drug that long, so it is premature to predict the degree of that kind of response.</p>

<p>Scolnick emphasized that compliance is critical. For example if, for any reason, an individual is running low on indinavir supply, they should stop it completely rather than lowering your dose.</p>

<p>Jeff Chadokawitz started the slide show: indinavir bioavailability is 60-65%, plasma half-life is 1.8 hrs., metabolized hepatically.</p>

<p>An important point that was discussed: up til this point Merck has instructed individuals taking indinavir not to eat or drink unclear liquid for 2 hrs. prior to dosing and 1 hr. after dosing. Now, Merck will be allowing people to eat a light snack, such as toast with jelly or skim milk with medication. They say it reduces the AUC by 2-8%. However, they did caution that it may reduce the drug's efficacy; they said, ideally the best way to take indinavir is with fasting.</p>

<p>In the near future Merck will be conducting studies experimenting with eating, in order to better understand these issues.</p>

<p>Indinavir phase II studies that are part of the New Drug Application package:</p>
<ul>
<li>monotherapy -- #004, 006, 010 
<li>combination -- #19, 20, 35 
<li>dose ranging -- 018, 021
</ul>

<p>Scolnick discussed his views of <a href="rna.html">HIV RNA testing</a>. He said, it reflects replication in the whole body; it is a direct measure of the rate of replication. It will become the standard by which we measure the state of an individual's disease; as well, it's a direct measure of the efficacy of drugs.</p>

<p>In early dose ranging studies, the 800 mg.-3X/day dose suggested greater benefit than the 600 mg.-4x/day. The range of RNA reductions were more far-reaching with the 800 dose; there were some individuals with up to 4.5 log drops at 16 and 24 weeks. Although, the main original reason for selecting 800 mg.@3x/day was its ease of administration, rather than 4x/day dosing. </p>

<p><b>Merck study #019</b>. AZT-naive, baseline CD4-180/RNA - above 20,000, 20-25 per arm.<br>

The AZT/indinavir group had an RNA reduction of 2.5 log at 24 weeks. A few individuals displayed 4 to 4 1/2 log reductions.<br>

For more detailed explanations and data, the NATAP Protease Inhibitor Report, a 43-page document detailing all the available data on 5 protease inhibitors, and the NATAP Position Paper on accelerated approval for Crixivan and Norvir are available by writing <a href="mailto:julev@aol.com">NATAP</a>.</p>

<p><b>#019 viral mutation</b>.<br>

Study participants in #019 who displayed indinavir associated mutations: 9/21 (43%) on IDV mono-, 1/18 (6%) on AZT mono-, 4/22 (18%) on IDV/AZT.<br>

Participants who displayed AZT associated mutations: 1/17 (6%) on IDV mono-, 11/17 (65%) on AZT mono-, 1/22 (4%) on IDV/AZT.</p>

<title>NATAP: Abbott meeting 2/20/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<h3>Community Meeting with Abbott 2/20/96</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>On Feb. 20, I attended a small meeting with AIDS treatment advocates and Abbott Lab officials to discuss their preparations for the upcoming Advisory panel hearings, for their FDA approval and subsequent marketing.</p>

<p>The entire discussion lasted several hours and covered a variety of subjects.</p>

<p><b>Pharmacokinetic concerns</b>. Norvir is hepatically metabolized; it is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A, a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6; induction of GT & CYP1A2.</p>

<ol>
<li>Abbott presented data from <b>M94-245</b>, which examined AZT v. AZT/ritonavir v. ritonavir, in AZT-naive individuals. For this study, they used the distasteful liquid formulation. They started with 120 subjects in each of the 3 treatment groups; CD4 at entry above 200; RNA above 15,000. Baseline measures: RNA- 4.84, CD4 350-380, CD8 930-990.
<br>
RNA & CD4 changes: ritonavir mono-- 1.4 log reduction & 80 CD4 increase at 16 weeks, ritonavir/AZT- 1.2 log reduction & 30 CD4 increase at 16 weeks.
<br>
Discontinuations in study:ritonavir mono-- 25%, AZT- 19%, ritonavir/AZT- 39%
<br>
The high rate of discontinuation in the AZT/ritonavir group took place mostly in the first 2 weeks.
<br>
Side effects reported for that group included: nausea 20%; vomiting 14%; diarrhea 9%
<br>
Vomiting and diarrhea can lower your blood levels of ritonavir.
<br>
A major question is-- why the ritonavir/AZT group performed more poorly than the ritonavir monotherapy group, as measured by CD4 and viral load?
<br>
John Leonard of Abbott said he thinks that combining AZT with the liquid formulation made the therapy more distasteful and harder to take. So, there may have been poorer compliance. He displayed a chart indicating that ritonavir blood concentrations, at some point during the study, were much lower for the ritonavir/AZT group than the ritonavir monotherapy group. He said, ritonavir and AZT were not antagonistic, and ritonavir levels are not effected by AZT. In fact, he said, AZT with ritonavir were additive and possibly synergistic. Thereby, concluding that poor compliance was the reason. Also, he surmises that some study participants were sharing their ritonavir with friends, who weren't in the study; thereby, the individuals, in the study, were taking sub-optimal dosing, which is a classic cause for resistance, and, of course these individuals will perform more poorly in study.
<br>
However, Merck reported the same occurence. In a phase III AZT- naive study, the AZT/indinavir arm performed approximately equal to the indinavir monotherapy arm. At the FDA hearings the FDA and the Advisory committee called this a "disconnect".
<br>
<li><b>Indication</b>. Abbott is requesting full approval (not accelerated approval) for monotherapy and combination therapy for individuals with disease warranting treatment. 
<br>
<li>They talked about a meeting they had already had with Donna Shalala, Philip Lee, William Paul and other high level government officials regarding future collaboration between NIH and industry in conducting the necessary future studies.
<br>
One of the prime concerns of this writer and other advocates is the proper sorting out of the optimal uses of protease inhibitors. The types of questions that need addressing include: when to begin therapy, what to start therapy with, when to switch, what to switch to, optimizing combinations, improving our understanding of resistance and cross-resistance concerns, and studying the combination of 2 protease inhibitors.
<br>
Although Abbott expressed interest in properly addressing these concerns, some community advocates at the meeting were suspect. It remains to be seen if these promises will be realized in a timely fashion. My concern is that it may take too long to plan and implement a comprehensive course of action. Our government officials are notorious for headline seeking and long delays.
<br>
One of the promises coming out of the December White House AIDS summit meeting was that the Clinton Administration would meet with drug industry and NIH officials to discuss these concerns. For me, the follow-up is all that matters. Talk is cheap; let's see how quickly and comprehensively the NIH and the industry responds.
<br>
The implementation of the above outlined research directions would be extremely costly. Who will pay and how will the cost responsibilities be distributed?? These cost considerations are a barrier to this massive undertaking. But, the NIH and the drug companies, in my opinion, are obligated to conduct this research, as quickly as possible.
<br>
<li>Abbott has high expectations of the potential for combining ritonavir with saquinavir. Currently, they are conducting a small pilot study in healthy volunteers, to discern safety considerations. They expect safety to be established and are hoping to enter a study examining multiple doses of both drugs in HIV infected individuals.
<br>
<li><b>Production and supply</b>. Abbott was confident they can produce sufficient supplies for the demand. There was no hint of limitations in their capability to produce adequate supplies.
<br>
<li><b>Patient Assistance Program</b>. They promised to have such a program implemented. However, they expressed uncertainty regarding the comprehensiveness of the program.
<br>
<li><b>Drug Interactions</b>. This subject is a major concern for everyone. Norvir has more drug interaction concerns than the other 2 protease inhibiotrs. Although saquinavir and indinavir have drug interactions with many of the same drugs, for Norvir, the magnitude of the interactions and the number of drugs for which Norvir has such interactions, is greater than for saquinavir and indinavir.

</ol>

<p>Currently, there is a list of about <a href="../../network/simple/riton.html">25 drugs</a> that are NOT to be co-administered with ritonavir. Also, there are other drugs whose use with ritonavir will cause changes in blood levels to either ritonavir or the other drug; Abbott promised to arrange for an open-line for comunication between physicians, people with HIV or AIDS and the company on these concerns. They said, they would establish a hotline, where anyone could call in and request information about potential interaction between any drug and ritonavir. Also, they committed to embarking on a comprehensive education program for medical care providers, people with HIV or AIDS, and physicians. They've promised to coordinate this with community representatives.</p>

<p>I asked them about ritonavir's capacity to cross the blood brain barrier. Leonard said, he thinks it crosses the BBB, but possibly at the rate of 1%. It is my understanding that ritonavir does not cross the BBB. This subject should be researched further. I asked, if there were any data on ritonavir's effect in virus in lymph nodes. He related the study of 1 individual who was biopsied. This also needs further research.</p>

<p>A detailed report of ritonavir data, and all other protease inhibitor data, is available from our 43-page protease inhibitor report,"Protease Inhibitors: Current and Future Use", which can be ordered by <a href="mailto:julev@aol.com">contacting us</a>.</p>

<h3>Viral load testing: understanding and using it, and FDA approval (12/95)</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>On April 1, 1996, or thereabouts, the FDA will conduct their usual public panel discussion to consider the approval of the Roche HIV RNA (viral load ) test. It will probably be a joint panel including both the Antiviral Drug Advisory Committee and the Blood Products Advisory Committee. Roche submitted their "expedited review" application in November of 1995, and the FDA is required to respond within 6 months. This response could include a slight delay in approval to resolve technical questions such as labeling and site inspections. I think we can expect the FDA review and approval of Chiron's bDNA, to follow within a few months.</p>

<p><i>The following article is re-printed with permission, from the December 1995 BETA, the Bulletin of Experimental Treatments for AIDS, published by the San Francisco AIDS Foundation.</i></p>

<h3>A perspective on viral load testing <i>by Jules Levin</i></h3>

<p>In early November, Roche Molecular Systems, the manufacturer of the QC-PCR (quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction) HIV RNA test, filed an application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for accelerated review and approval of their assay. Chiron, Inc., the manufacturer of the bDNA (branched DNA) HIV RNA assay, will apply for approval within the next few months. This technology may bring about important changes in the way HIV disease is treated and HIV-related research is conducted. At recent scientific meetings, discussion has been devoted to both FDA approval of the assays and to the interpretation of test results. In September, the FDA Clinical Trials meeting at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) campus in Maryland instructed a group of researchers to arrive at a "professional consensus" on what is and is not known about the meaning of viral load test results. At the recent 2nd Annual Surrogate Markers of HIV Conference in October, this subject again received much attention. </p>

<p>The Roche QC-PCR test and the Chiron bDNA test are currently available through many reference labs. A third test manufactured by Organon Teknika, Inc. is not yet available for wide public use. All of these assays measure the number of HIV RNA copies/ml. in the blood (See BETA "Individualized Therapy, September 1994). Each uses a different method to measure viral load in the peripheral blood. However, there is some concern about whether a reduction of HIV RNA in the blood also reflects a reduction of virus or viral activity in the lymph nodes. Viral load changes may not necessarily reflect a change in disease progression unless there is a parallel change in viral load in the lymph nodes; however, some researchers believe there is a correlation between viral load increases and disease progression. David Ho, MD, (D. Ho and others, Nature, 373:123-126, 1995) found that CD4 lymphocyte increases and viral load suppression as measured by PCR were accompanied by significant clinical improvement.</p>

<p><b>Current Use and Understanding of HIV RNA Assays</b><br>

 RNA viral load assays may have several applications. In drug trials, these assays measure the antiviral effect of the drugs being studies. In all current protease inhibitor trials, the assays are used to measure drug efficacy. At recent FDA hearings for approval of d4T, saquinavir and AZT/3TC, measures of HIV RNA viral load were considered along with CD4 cell count changes when deciding whether to grant approval. Physicians may use QC-PCR and bDNA test results to evaluate the effect of a drug therapy or to measure disease stage.</p>

<p>Viral load assays are still considered investigational by FDA. They have not been officially approved, nor is there complete certainty about the full interpretation of test results and how to utilize those results. Lack of FDA approval means that many insurance carriers are unwilling to reimburse for the assays, which can be expensive (approximately $175-200). The price may be reduced if they are approved for marketing.</p>

<p>Viral load assays may eventually be used to screen blood products and plasma, and to measure the risk of vertical (maternal-fetal) transmission of HIV if FDA approves those indications. The assays can also be used to predict the risk of disease progression (prognosis). Roche has applied for approval of QC-PCR as a prognostic indicator; this is probably the same indication for which Chiron will apply. The assays are also useful in clinical management; they can be used to make treatment decisions. The assays' utility for making clinical management decisions is uncertain, but some researchers think the data is nearly complete enough to support that use. </p>

<p>HIV RNA measurement can identify those individuals who are at highest risk of disease progression--those who have the highest RNA levels. Long-term non-progressors generally have low viral load throughout their period of infection; they are somehow able to control the viral burden (Y. Cao and others, New England Journal of Medicine 332:201-208, 1995). The level of RNA associated with increased risk of progression is thought to be between 100,000 and 200,000 RNA copies/ml. or more. A retrospective study examined stored blood samples from HIV-infected individuals. The results of HIV RNA assays of the samples conducted immediately after sero-conversion indicated that the baseline RNA level was predictive of the risk of progression (Mellors and others, Annals of Internal Medicine, 122:573-579, 1995). The risk of progression is doubled if HIV RNA levels are between 10,000 and 100,000 copies/ml. compared to levels below 10,000 copies/ml. A level above 100,000 copies/ml. indicates a risk of progression 12 times higher than a level below 10,000 copies/ml. Follow-up studies are underway.</p>

<p><b>Future Uses of HIV RNA Assays</b><br>

What is the difference in the risk of progression at levels between 100,000 and 300,000 RNA copies/ml., or between 100,000 and 1 million copies/ml., or between 5,000 and 500? Researchers are unsure if there is a meaningful difference in risk of HIV progression between 5,000 and 500 copies/ml. If there is no difference, then it may not be useful at that level to add another drug or 2 in order to lower viral load. Current studies may provide better answers to these types of questions. One study, Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA) study #36, is now recruiting an expected total of 1,000 participants. Chiron donated its bDNA test for this trial. It is anticipated that this study will provide important, statistically significant answers and yield information that will allow better clinical management decisions based on RNA test results.</p>

<p>Data support claims that a change in RNA level is associated with a change in risk of disease progression, and that a 3-fold variation, if sustained, reflects a meaningful change in RNA levels. Continued compilation and analysis of data should provide stronger evidence for these claims. It is vital to understand the meaning of a decrease or increase in an individual's viral load. For example, how much additional benefit is there in lowering an individuals' RNA level from 90,000 to 30,000 copies/ml. (a 3-fold reduction)? Test results are variable, but if a 3-fold reduction is sustained, the results are considered reliable. If an individual's HIV RNA level is reduced from 80,000 to 16,000 copies/ml., that is a 5-fold reduction, does that individual benefit from such a change? These response or risk threshold's must be established in order to properly weigh the benefit/risk ratios of taking drugs. The cost to an individual of taking 1, 2 or 3 drugs is measured in toxicity, drug interactions, financial resources, compliance difficulties and remaining available treatment options. The difference in risk of progression between 80,000 and 16,000 RNA copies/ml. may not be sufficient to warrant the added risks of taking another 1 or 2 drugs. It may be more beneficial to delay that choice.</p>

<p>A clearly defined understanding of HIV RNA assays would allow refinements in the structure of AIDS clinical trials. In some instances, drugs could be studied in fewer people for a shorter time. Smaller, shorter studies would save human and financial resources, which could then be utilized for other research that is currently not feasible.</p>

<P><b>FDA Review and Approval</b><br>

AIDS clinical studies that are being reviewed to provide support for the approval of viral load assays include ACTG 116A, 116B/117, 175, the Veteran's Administration Study and the Delta Study. Roche has already compiled, analyzed and submitted the data from ACTG 116B/117 and 116A to the FDA as part of its application. Data from the Delta Trial and ACTG 175 will not be ready for submission for another 4-6 months. Once the data from all these trials have been compiled and reviewed by FDA, there may be enough information to prove that treatment decisions can be made based on RNA test results.</p>

<p>Roche has applied to FDA for approval of QC-PCR as a tool for prognosis of HIV disease progression. If a doctor were to make clinical management decisions based on test results, such use would not comply with official guidelines. But, doctors are already using the assays that way. Therefore, it is important to analyze all the available data as quickly as possible, and to seek an indication, validated by data, that would include using QC-PCR to make clinical management decisions. Once the approval process is completed, physicians will need to be educated about the proper use of QC-PCR testing, and reference laboratories will have to be inspected regularly to control the quality of the assays that are performed.</p>

<P>Equivalency between different viral load assays needs to be evaluated and established by FDA. An individual may get different numerical results from Chiron's bDNA and Roche's QC-PCR assays on the same blood sample under the same conditions. FDA and consumers will want to understand the meaning and significance of these differences.</p>

<P>Wide variation in test results can occur because of variation in the conditions and methods of drawing blood samples, in the handling, shipping and storing of the samples. Laboratory technicians need special training to properly perform QC-PCR and bDNA assays. Consistent standards and procedures at laboratories and at sites where blood is drawn, stored and shipped need to be established. FDA will be required to make on-site inspections of the companies' facilities to assure uniform standards of quality.</p>

<P>FDA may hold a joint public hearing of the Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee and the Blood Product Advisory Committee to publicly review the data. The assays have been classified as devices, and therefore will be reviewed according to regulations that govern devices. The designation of the assays as devices will allow for a relatively quicker review time. When Chiron applies for approval of the bDNA assay, FDA will have already reviewed the PCR test, and ought to be able to evaluate bDNA more quickly.</p>

<p><b>Commentary</b> <i>2/15/96</i><br>

At the recently held 3rd Retrovirus Conference, much data regarding viral load was presented, from some of the above mentioned studies and additional ones. Some researchers now believe the accumulation of data, revealed at the Conference, is such that viral load changes due to therapy is indicative of disease progression; and therefore, clinical decision making can be based upon viral load test results. A question remaining is--what are the actual thresholds or changes in levels upon which treatment changes can be based?</p>

<h3>The development of cross-resistance <br>
from the use of a protease inhibitor (1/96)</h3> 

<blockquote><p>This subject has been much discussed; we are all concerned that the development of cross-resistance can be a limiting factor in the potential benefit from the use of protease inhibitors. A brief explanation of cross-resistance is that treatment with one protease inhibitor can cause resistance to a second protease inhibitor without someone ever having been treated with that second inhibitor.</p>

<p>Both Abbott and Merck agree that prior treatment with one of their inhibitors will cause a large enough degree of cross-resistance to the other, so as to render use of the second one as ineffective. In other words, prolonged treatment with <a href="../../network/simple/riton.html">ritonavir</a>, wherein resistance to ritonavir starts to develop, will cause cross-resistance to Crixivan. Likewise, prior treatment with Crixivan will cause cross-resistance to ritonavir. The practical effect of this is that, if you choose to use ritonavir first, you may not benefit from the future use of Crixivan. Similarly, if you choose to use Crixivan first, you may not benefit from the subsequent use of ritonavir.</p>

<p><b>Reversing resistance?</b><br>
There is a potential development, that could ease our concerns about the development of cross-resistance. Similar to the relationship that we believe exists between AZT and 3TC (where, it is believed that 3TC may reverse the resistance that develops from prolonged treatment with AZT), it is possible that scientists may discover a like relationship between 2 drugs that may reverse the resistance that develops from use of one protease inhibitor.</p>

<p>For example, we may discover that treatment with one particular protease inhibitor may reverse the resistance that develops from the prior use of a different protease inhibitor. Published reports from researchers at Glaxo Wellcome indicate that <a href="../../network/simple/saquin.html">saquinavir</a> and the Vertex protease inhibitor, being developed by Glaxo, may have such a special relationship; that the development of resistance for one is reversible by treatment with the other. Of course, these findings were from in vitro experiments and must be tested in humans, but there is some promise for hope and exciting developments (Tisdale et al, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Aug. 1995, p. 1704-1710).</p>

<P>At a January '96 meeting with Glaxo, doubts were raised about whether Glaxo is fully committed to quickly studying these possibilities. They may be content to delay this direction of research. This would be a tremendous setback for people with HIV and AIDS. In this meeting, I pressured them to quickly initiate studies of VX-478 in combination with other protease inhibitors. In fairness to Glaxo, after an initial resistance, they said they will pursue this direction in a timely way, but I will be following up with continuing dialogue. This research needs to be initiated as quickly as possible, for both safety and efficacy reasons: (1) many individuals will shortly be taking indinavir, saquinavir or ritonavir; with the entry of Glaxo into trials of VX-478, some individuals may experiment with combining 478 with one of the other three, and safety concerns need examination; (2) we need to explore the potential for efficacy, that may exist by combining VX-478 with other inhibitors. This research direction is particularly significant for individuals with extensive drug experience and few treatments options remaining; the prospect of combining 2 drugs (especially, in this case, a potentially potent combination of 2 protease inhibitors), neither of which they've ever taken, is a very promising option that must quickly be explored.</p>

<p><b>Saquinavir and Crixivan or ritonavir cross-resistance</b><br>
Roche and Merck have disagreed about the effect that pre-treatment with saquinavir will have on subsequent use of Crixivan. Merck says, they believe that prolonged pre-treatment with saquinavir may start the process of the development of resistance to Crixivan; so that, if one takes Crixivan after having used saquinavir, that person may develop resistance to Crixivan sooner than if they had not used saquinavir at all. Roche says, they don't believe this will occur. Although, we have tried to resolve this difference of opinion, it remains in dispute. Finally, after pressure from our community and the FDA, both companies have agreed to conduct a "special resistance" study. They will take individuals with a minimum of 6 months pre-treatment with saquinavir and switch them to Crixivan. After enrolled in the study, their viruses will be examined for resistance patterns at baseline and then followed over time. We hope that this study will expand our understanding of cross-resistance concerns. The same potential problem exists for sequential use of saquinavir and ritonavir. Pre-treatment with saquinavir may cause the same cross-resistance development for subsequent use of ritonavir.</p>

<p>In this special resistance study, two overall developments will be examined. First, the short-term response of individuals to the switch in treatment. That is, after an individual changes treatment from saquinavir to Crixivan, will he or she experience the full extent of the initial drop in viral load, that individuals usually experience with Crixivan treatment. The second question is will the anti-viral benefits last as long as, after the switch, as they would have from an initial treatment with Crixivan without pre-treatment with saquinavir.</p>

<p>However, until we have more information, individuals who have to make treatment choices now, are put in a difficult and unenviable position. They must choose saquinavir, ritonavir or Crixivan with a limited understanding of what cross-resistance developments may occur.</p>

<P><b>Saquinavir/ritonavir combination</b><br>
At this moment, the first combination of 2 protease inhibitors is being studied for safety. Once it is established that combining saquinavir and ritonavir is safe, further studies will be conducted, examining efficacy and optimal dosing for each drug in the combination. There are two reasons why the combination of these 2 drugs is promising. Abbott says, saquinavir and ritonavir have complementary resistance profiles, and in cell culture, ritonavir resistant viruses retain full sensitivity to saquinavir. Second, ritonavir's metabolism inhibits the metabolism of other drugs when administered concomitantly. Indeed, due to the inhibition of saquinavir metabolism by the presence of ritonavir, in animal studies, the plasma concentration of saquinavir increased by 200-fold.</p>

<p>Individuals must be cautioned not to combine these 2 drugs, on their own, until we learn from the ongoing studies about the overall safety of this combination. We are unsure which dose to use for each drug; using the wrong doses could be dangerous. Still, it is expected that soon we may have sufficient information from these studies, to make some treatment decisions.</p>

<p><b>Potential developments</b><br>
Other protease inhibitors, which are in earlier stages of development, may have less problems with cross-resistance. The <a href="vertex.html">Glaxo/Vertex</a> protease inhibitor, VX-478, promises to have less concerns about cross-resistance. In addition to the potential relationship between saquinavir and VX-478, referred to above, other protease inhibitors may also have a relationship with VX-478 that would improve cross-resistance concerns. Glaxo says, from in vitro studies, without any pre-treatment with Crixivan, that combining Crixivan with VX-478 indicates additive benefits. Other drug manufacturers are trying to develop protease inhibitors that would have minimal cross-resistance problems. Upjohn is hoping to enter a phase I trial, with a 3rd generation <a href="upjohn.html">protease inhibitor</a>, which they say would not have such prohibitive cross-resistance concerns.</p></blockquote>

<h3 align=center>Protease Inhibitors (1/96)</h3>

<blockquote><p>Protease inhibitors are the new class of anti-HIV drugs, that we hope will usher us into a brighter era for the treatment of HIV. Currently, there are 5 protease inhibitors in various stages of clinical development. In pre-clinical stages are various other protease inhibitors. The surrogate marker data (CD4 and HIV RNA) are being accumulated for these 5. The Roche protease was recently approved for marketing; the Merck and Abbott protease inhibitors will be reviewed by the FDA by March of 1996. We can expect them to be marketed by March or April. Agouron's protease inhibitor, VIRACEPT or previously known as Ag-1343, is now entering its large-scale pre-accelerated approval studies. Glaxo Wellcome is developing the Vertex protease inhibitor, known as VX-478. It has just recently entered early phase II human trials. Glaxo expects to begin a study examining VX-478 in combination with other antivirals in the Spring of this year, 1996. If all goes well, we may expect VX-478's large scale pre-accelerated approval trials to begin in the Fall of 1996. </p>

<p><b>Combination therapy</b> </p>
<p>Human studies conducted by Merck, Abbott and Roche indicate that the optimal way to use the protease inhibitors will be in multi- drug combinations. Early research indicates combinations will delay the onset of resistance and prolong the benefits. Abbott's French study of AZT/ritonavir/ddC showed benefits superior to monotherapy of ritonavir alone. The same results were obtained from Merck's Crixivan combination studies; combining it with AZT/ddI or AZT/3TC produced superior results to monotherapy with Crixivan. The onset of resistance by use of monotherapy is a concern, but we hope that we can adequately delay resistance through use of the combinations. Of course, an individual will have to be able to tolerate the drugs. The data we have from these combination studies is limited, so far. Its limited to about 8 months of study time, so it will take time before we're able to actually measure how long resistance can be delayed and benefits prolonged. </p>

<p>We are at the threshold of exploring the potential for combining 2 protease inhibitors into one treatment regimen. A studies has started examining the potential benefits of combining Roche's saquinavir and Abbott's ritonavir (Norvir is the trade name). Hopefully, by the Spring of this year, 1996, a study will commence examining the combination of Merck's indinavir and saquinavir. Exploration of the prospects for using Agouron's protease inhibitor, Viracept, and Glaxo Wellcome's protease inhibitor, VX-478, in combination with other protease inhibitors will have to wait until these drugs are further along in their development. Unless, the approach to exploring combining protease inhibitors speeds up or improves, it will be a while before we can test the possibilities for combining Viracept and VX-478 with other protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>Other protease inhibitors are in various stages of pre-clinical development. Boehringer-Ingelheim is in a phase I study with its protease inhibitor. Gilead Sciences has its protease inhibitor in pre-clinical testing attempting to minimize its drugs' cross- resistance with other inhibitors. Needless to say, if its successful in minimizing its drug's cross-resistance, we would have exciting treatment possibilities. As well, <a href="upjohn.html">Upjohn's protease inhibitor</a> program is examining its 3rd generation compound, still in pre-clinical testing .</p>

<p>As I alluded to earlier, we only have surrogate marker data (CD4 and viral load) on the Roche, Abbott and Merck protease inhibitors. As a requirement to being granted accelerated approval, these companies are required to conduct "clinical endpoint" studies to discover if they actually delay progression to AIDS or prolong survival (or delay death). Data has not yet been accumulated and made available (as of this date--Jan. 25, 1996), on whether these drugs actually prolong survival and delay the progression to AIDS. In addition, there are significant concerns about the development of cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors from first using the Roche, Merck, or Abbott drugs. Therefore, some experts are recommending that if an individual is in a position (with regards to his/her health status--CD4, viral load, general health considerations) to postpone the use of a protease inhibitor, it may be advisable. By waiting, one may be able to benefit from information that we can discover in the future about cross-resistance and the efficacy of other inhibitors--Agouron' VIRACEPT and <a href="vertex.html">Glaxo's VX-478</a>. This is a personal decision, that an individual needs to make in consultation with his physician. Therefore, it is important that your doctor is informed and up-to-date about these issues.</p>

<h3 align=center>The Upjohn Protease Inhibitor (1/96)</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Upjohn (now called Pharmacia & Upjohn, after the merger) has been in the process of developing, what we hope, will be a unique protease inhibitor. They have been trying to develop this product for a while; the first 2 generation inhibitors failed, but they are now trying again with the 3rd generation.</p>

<p>Unlike all of the current protease inhibitors in clinical development (which are peptide based protease inhibitors), the Upjohn product is a non-peptidic inhibitor with a lower molelcular weight. It is different structurally; it binds differently, because of being non-peptidic and structurally different; it binds to different amino acids. Therefore, Upjohn says, its major mutations are different. The promise of this is it may not have the same measure of cross-resistance problems as the current group of inhibitors in clinical development.</p>

<p>They are currently developing their 3rd generation protease inhibitor. The first (U-96,988) had sufficient absorption and safety but was not potent enough. The 2nd generation (U-103,017) was highly protein bound, rendering it ineffectual; the 3rd generation is less protein bound and much more potent than the other two generations.</p>

<p>They are currently conducting pre-clinical studies of several 3rd generation protease inhibitors. They are testing in vitro and in animals for potency, absorption and toxicity. They hope to be able to develop either 1 or possibly 2 of these compounds. </p>

<p>If all goes well, they are planning a human, single-dose phase I study in the 2nd half of 1996.</p>

<h3>Glaxo Wellcome starts phase I/II for Vertex protease inhibitor</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>December 14, 1995. Glaxo Wellcome has started a phase I/II study for its Vertex protease inhibitor at 8 sites including 3 in the U.S. and the remaining 5 in Europe.The three U.S. sites are Denver, Atlanta and San Diego. There will be a 2-week drug washout from antivirals. The first patient was dosed yesterday. Essentially, it will be 4 week studies of three different doses of the drug: 300 mg. twice daily, 300 mg. three times daily, 450 mg. twice daily. 30 patients will be recruited, 10 per dose is expected.</p>

<P>The study will examine pharmacokinetics, tolerability and efficacy. Efficacy will be measured by CD4 and HIV RNA. The final analysis ought to be compiled by April of 1996. A multi-drug combination of AZT/3TC and the Vertex protease (VX-478) is expected to be the subject of a 28 day study starting probably by April of 1996.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the current schedule calls for the pivotal, accelerated approval trials probably not to begin until the last quarter of 1996. They are planning small pilot studies for June to start studying VX-478 in combination with other drugs, so they can select the combinations they'll use in the pivotol studies.</p>

<P>In previous single dose studies of VX-478, examining 600, 900 and 1200 mg. per day the safety profile looked good. So, Glaxo is hopeful of being able to reach higher dosages.</p>

<P>Published articles, authored by researchers from Glaxo Wellcome, say in vitro research indicates VX-478 has a unique resistance profile; it shows minimal cross-resistance with other protease inhibitors. Moreover, they claim, from their in vitro work, that saquinvir may reverse resistance created from multiple passages of VX-478.</p> 

<p><b>VX-478 in the brain and lymph tissues</b><br>
Interesting information regarding tissue distribution of VX-478 in an animal model is available. Vertex says, in rats, that 170% of the amount of drug in the blood is found in the brain; in lymph tissues, the level of the drug is 10 times higher than the amount found in the blood. According to Vertex, Ritonavir and Crixivan perform much more poorly in this regard. Apparently, with AZT, only 25% of the amount of drug in the blood makes it to the brain. Some scientists have raised concerns about this perceived benefit of such strong penetration of the CNS. Their concern is over potential side effects to the brain and CNS system, such as headaches, etc.</p>

<p><b>COMMENTARY</b>: At a meeting with community representatives, where I was in attendance, I made some suggestions regarding the development of this promising protease inhibitor; my suggestions were initially resisted by the representatives from Glaxo Wellcome. Since, VX-478 has such promise in combination with specific other protease inhibitors, because of their unique and different resistance (or mutation profile), I suggested that they quickly start the initial studies necessary to speed along development of this direction. The study process that precedes clinical trials examining combining 2 protease inhibitors, would include a study examining the safety of combining, for example VX-478 with saquinavir, indinavir, Agouron's VIRACEPT, etc. Considering that many individuals will very soon be taking saquinavir, ritonavir and indinavir, it is the responsibility of Glaxo Wellcome to quickly initiate such studies. By the end of the meeting, they agreed to consider this suggestion. We'll see how committed they are to this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Report of the FDA Hearings for approval of---AZT/3TC, Saquinivir and D4T written by Jules Levin--November 10,1995</b></p>

<p>In keeping with tradition if not regulation, the FDA held its public hearing of the Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee on November 6, 7 and 8, in Silver Springs, Md., for the consideration of approval for three AIDS antiviral therapies. The procedure is that at the end of the day, after consideration of the data, the Committee, in open hearing, offers to the FDA its recommendation to approve or not to approve. It also offers their recommendation for an indication of use for the treatment. The FDA is not bound to follow the committee's recommendation but they usually do. </p>

<p>On each of the three days, a different application for approval was considered. Glaxo Wellcome had filed an application for Accelerated Approval for the combination of AZT/3TC, for both adults and pediatrics, on June 30, 1995. Their hearing was the first, scheduled for Monday, November 6th. The 2nd day- November 7th- was for consideration of Roche's application of Accelerated Aproval for Saquinivir, which they filed in September, 1995. November 8th, the third and last day, was for Bristol-Myers Squibb's application for full approval of D4T, as it had been previously granted Accelerated Approval. </p>

<p>The first two meetings, Monday and Tuesday were very well attended; it seemed that 300 people or more were present. The press was well represented, as well as the drug industry and stock analysts; there were a lot of people with cellular phones. Representatives from Agouron, Merck and Abbott were present to observe and plan for their future hearings. By Wednesday the crowd was a little smaller. The big attraction seemed to be that the first protease inhibitor was about to be marketed.</p>

<p><b>Protease inhibitor cross-resistance meeting</b><br>
Before reviewing the hearings, I'll briefly discuss a meeting that occurred on Sunday, November 4th, the day before the hearings began. A small gathering of community advocates including myself, arrived in Silver Springs early Sunday, in order to participate in a specially scheduled meeting with Roche and Merck to address the issues related to cross-resistance between their protease inhibitors. The meeting was pre-arranged by Project Inform and co-sponsored by GMHC. </p>

<p>Since earlier in this year, there has been a significant difference of opinion between Roche and Merck regarding whether prior treatment with Roche's protease inhibitor Saquinivir can cause cross-resistance to Merck's protease inhibitor Crixivan or to other protease inhibitors. Of course, also up for discussion was the potential for cross-resistance caused by prior treatment with Crixivan to other protease inhibitors; But, Merck freely admits that Crixivan can cause cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors, therefore this subject was not the main topic for discussion at this meeting. We were here, in an attempt, to try and resolve the difference of opinion between Roche and Merck-- does prior treatment with Saquinivir facilitate the beginning of resistance to Crixivan (i.e, cross-resistance to Crixivan)?? </p>

<p>Both Roche and Merck presented data and discussed research information about resistance and cross-resistance. We spent 5 hours in this meeting. Both companies faced off and the debate between them became heated a number of times. Noel Roberts handled the presentation for Roche while both Emilio Emini and Jon Condra spoke for Merck. Much of the information presented by the two companies had previously been presented.</p>

<p>By the end of the day, both remained steadfast in their claims. Roche continued to claim that prior treatment with Saquinivir has minimal potential for cross-resistance to Crixivan and other protease inhibitors; Roche's data and opinions are based upon individuals from their trials with about 1 year's treatment exposure to Saquinivir. Merck maintains their claim that prior treatment with Saquinivir can cause some measure of cross-resistance to Crixivan. Dr. Doug Mayers, an AIDS researcher with the Division of Retrovirology at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, offered his theory as to why Roche may be mistaken. He claimed the manner in which Roche conducted the laboratory experiments to uncover the development of resistance and cross-resistance was no longer used and not reliable. Of course, Roche denied this and Merck supported it. It was again brought up at the Saquinivir hearing on Tuesday, but with no resolution. As of yet, there isn't enough information to adquately understand all the angles related to the development of cross-resistance.</p>

<p>A positive note was that this issue was addressed in the open hearing for Saquinivir on Tuesday; Dr. David Kessler, the FDA Commissioner, requested that the three protease inhibitor manufacturers -Abbott, Merck and Roche- cooperate with each other in trying to resolve the concerns about cross-resistance; and, representatives of the three companies stepped up to the microphone to agree to this cooperation. It was suggested that a "special resistance study" be conducted. That would be, to gather individuals who have been pre-treated with Saquinivir for a prolonged period of time (possibly 1 year), who have developed the Saquinivir L90M mutation, and then switch their treatment to Crixivan. It is suggested they could study two groups--in addition to the one just mentioned where they would switch treatment from Saquinivir to Crixivan-- continue a group on Saquinivir and add Crixivan to the regimen.</p>

<p>The Sunday meeting could be considered a noble attempt to discover who is telling the truth; but, the question was not resolved. We don't yet have enough information to understand the development of cross-resistance. </p>

<p>Significantly, both Merck and Roche have followed up by continuing their dialogue started at this resistance meeting. It is expected that the "special resistance study" will be initiated in the very near future. It is incumbent upon advocates to keep the pressure on Merck and Roche to insure they conduct this study.</p>

<p><b>AZT/3TC</b><br>
Glaxo Wellcome presented impressive and convincing data for the approval of this combination in adults. It was the most impressive data ever presented before this committee up til this point. Of course, it could be surpassed, by the Abbott and Merck data expected to be presented before this committee by early 1996, for their protease inhibitors. Glaxo presented the results of 4 randomized controlled clinical studies of the combination. The two therapy-naive studies examined 495 therapy naive individuals with CD4 between 100 to 500. The other two trials examined 477 AZT-experienced individuals with CD4 between 100 and 400. The CD4 increases and viral load decreases, resulting from treatment with the AZT/3TC combination, were both well sustained for--either 6 months or 1 year-- the amount of time for which data was presented, for a particular study. There were no significant safety concerns. However, the amount of study participants upon which the data was based at one year was vastly reduced from the baseline number. For example, in one study, at baseline the number of participants in the AZT/3TC-150 mg. arm was 88; by the time we arrived at one year there were 29 participants remaining in that arm.</p>

<p>The only objection raised was regarding Glaxo's plan for comfirmatory trials. Glaxo was seeking approval of this combination for two uses in adults- (1) for use by individuals who are AZT experienced, and (2) for individuals who are AZT naive. The company presented data from studies of both of those groups. The benefits to AZT-naive individuals, in terms of both CD4 and viral load, were much superior to the benefits received by those who were AZT-experienced; but, the AZT-experienced individuals also received impressive benefits, as measured by both CD4 and viral load. Based on the data alone, it would be expected that these applications for approval should sail through the hearing before the committee and the FDA approval. </p>

<p>However, an objection was raised by a vocal group of activists from TAG (Treatment Action Group). They wanted to prevent the committee from recommending approval for the AZT naive group in the higher CD4 range (250-500). Their objection was based on --- although Glaxo had already planned a clinical endpoint trial (following people to progression to AIDS and death) in the CD4 range below 250, they had not planned such a study for AZT-naive individuals above 250 CD4. They claimed good science and the regulations required such an undertaking. They would have liked a delay of approval for this population until Glaxo presented such a confirmatory or clinical endpoint study for this population-- AZT-naive (possibly to include AZT-experienced) and CD4 > 250. Their objections became very heated not only at the AZT/3TC hearing on Monday but also during the Saquinivir hearing on Tuesday. They feel (1) that a confirmatory trial in the AZT-naive, upper CD4 range poplulation is feasible ( unlike others who don't think such a trial is feasible), (2) that for varying populations (e.g.- lower CD4 range vs. upper CD4 range), efficacy responses to drugs are different and therefore each needs their own database, and (3) not requiring Glaxo to conduct this trial will open the floodgates for other drug companies to do the same. They relentlessly pursued the FDA on these points. Glaxo said they met with these activists to address the issue, but were unable to think of a feasible study design. After the hearing the other community activists, who supported full approval for AZT/3TC, said they would call the FDA after the hearing to ensure that the FDA follows the committee's recommendations for approval. </p>

<p>The other community advocates at the hearing strongly disageed, with the objections to approval, and insisted the committee and the FDA support Glaxo's request of approval for both groups--AZT-experienced and AZT-naive above 250 CD4. The Committee strongly supported this position. Dr. David Feigal, the Director of the Anti-viral Drug Product Division of the FDA, also strongly supported this position. The body of arguments he and others stated that (1) there was in place a confirmatory trial from which we could extrapolate information to the higher CD4 range, (2) we have many new drugs coming to market in the near future--the Abbott, Merck, Roche, Agouron protease inhibitors-- as well as other expected HIV antiviral drugs; Dr. Feigal said, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to conduct clinical endpoint trials for each and every one of those individual drugs in every population range, (3) the future for treatment of HIV and AIDS is going to be with multi-drug combinations and we will need to focus on conducting trials utilizing these combinations, (4) with the availability of these many new drugs it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to design trials that individuals will remain in-- a confirmatory trial in the CD4 range of 250-500 would probably have to last 3 to 4 years; with the advent of 4 or 5 new protease inhibitors, study participants, over time, will want to start switching their treatment regimens; the more you allow study participants to switch treatments the more difficult it becomes to interpret results; (5) if we could design a trial that might be inclusive enough and big enough, it still may not yield the information we want; it is the opinion of many that by the time we would have the results from such a long trial, the results would no longer be very relevant, (6) many resources would have to be devoted to an undertaking that most researchers feel would not be successful, (7) the results recently released from ACTG 175 and Delta indicate survival can be prolonged when initiating treatment at an earlier stage of disease-- higher CD4 range; and lastly (8) forthcoming, in the near future, will be a multitude of studies examining and comparing different combinations for both safety and efficacy; Glaxo agreed to collaborate-- with other drug compnaies, the ACTG and the NIH-- to conduct these studies. </p>

<p>The committee also felt that the AZT/3TC combination offered its most benefits, in terms of CD4 increases and viral load decreases, to the AZT-naive population; they felt it would be inappropriate to deny approval for that group and possibly deny access to that group; as discussed at the hearing, without explicit approval for that group, reimbursement could be denied by some insurers--private insurers, Medicaid in some states.</p>

<p>Two noteworthy concerns discussed are (1) the possibility that prior treatment with 3TC, such as when used in combination with AZT/3TC, could cause some measure of cross-resistance to DDI. Preliminary in vitro studies indicate that is a possibility. Further studies will need to be conducted to discern the measure of that problem; and, (2) TMP/SMX (used for PCP prophylaxis) decreases 3TC oral clearance by 29% (+/- 13%) and increases 3TC AUC by 44% (+/- 23%).</p>

<p><b>AZT/3TC for pediatrics</b><br>
The new FDA rule is that a company can apply for approval for a pediatric use based on adequate and well controlled adult studies together with other supportive pediatric information (such as safety and pharamacokinetic data) when the course of disease and the effects of the drug are expected to be sufficiently similar in adults and children. This rule was put into effect to accelerate development of drugs for HIV treatment in pediatrics. In other words, the presentation of convincing adult data along with pursauasive safety and pharmacokinetic data ought to be adequate for approval in the pediatric population. </p>

<p>In this case, Glaxo used the adult efficacy data because although a pediatric clinical confirmatory trial is underway, there is a lack of adequate clinical controlled data for safety and efficacy in the pediatrics populations.</p>

<P>Obviously, the adult efficacy data was adequate but pediatric data presented a safety concern. Pancreatitis occured at a higher rate in the two pediatric studies (15%) than in the adult trials overall (<0.5%). In spite of that concern, the Committee recommended approval to the FDA for this use. It was difficult to discern the actual cause for the occurrences of pancreatitis, because most of the children had advanced HIV disease and other risk factors for pancreatitis (including concomitant medications). There was some reluctance to recommend approval because of this concern, but the need for access to treatments for children was an important consideration.</p>

<p><b>Saqunivir</b><br>
Roche presented the results from 5 contolled studies totalling 920 participants. They requested an unusual indication for approval. In addition to requesting approval for Saquinivir in the ways in which they studied it, in their controlled clinical trials--Saquinivir monotherapy and in combination with either AZT alone or with the combination of AZT/DDC-- they also requested approval for Saqunivir to be used in combination with all other approved nucleoside analogues (that includes ddI, D4T and soon AZT/3TC). At the hearing, Roche presented that in their expanded access program some particpants (probably numbering up to 100 to 200 for each combination) were using these other un-studied combinations without reported safety concerns. </p>

<p>The efficacy data presented by Roche was adequate as measured by CD4 and HIV RNA for the combinations of Saquinivir/AZT and Saquinivir/AZT/DDC. The Committee recommended approval for the combination therapy indication requested-- for the treatment of advanced HIV disease in adults, with approved nucleoside analogues. The committee denied recommending approval for monotherapy with Saquinivir. They didn't think the efficacy data provided was adequate to recommend monotherapy for Saquinivir. Another concern the committee had was approving monotherapy use for individuals with 50 or under CD4 as a last resort treatment option. The data was unconvincing.</p>

<p>A noteworthy concern addressed at the hearing is the dosage for which Roche is requesting approval. Roche's application for approval is for a dose of 600 mg. three times daily for Saquinivir. At Stanford, Roche studied daily doses of 3,600 and 7,200 mg. of Saquinivir for 24 weeks. The CD4 increases and HIV RNA decreases were superior. In addition, Roche has developed a more potent (more bioavailable) formulation that is currently in a human trial; it might be available for approval by the Summer of 1996. </p>

<p>An individual may want to wait until the enhanced formula (EOF) is available before using saquinivir; there is a concern that treatment with saquinavir at the currently recommended dose, 600 mg. 3 times daily, may cause some measure of resistance to the EOF, and thereby the EOF could be less effective for that individual; but some individuals may not be able to wait or may not want to wait. Also, other protease inhibitors will be available by that time--Merck's Crixivan and Abbott's ritonavir. The fact is that the individual responses to saquinavir, as with any drug, are variable; many individuals in their studies, at the 600 mg. 3 times daily dose, responded relatively well to combination treatment including saquinivir, as measured by CD4 and HIV RNA. In the Italian study, for those who were AZT-naive and taking AZT/saquinivir, Roche said 25% of the participants had a 2 log or greater suppression of HIV RNA at between 2 and 8 weeks; and, 75% maintained a .5 log or greater RNA reduction through week 16-- not a long time. Obviously, for an individual who is faced with making treatment decisions, this subject is very difficult to sort out. </p>

<ul><b>Saquinivir notes</b>
<li>Saquinivir must be taken within 2 hours after a meal--bioavailability is improved by food.
<p>
<li><b>Drug interactions</b>: (consult your doctor) -Ketoconazole increases blood levels of Saquinivir -Rifampin decreases Saquinivir blood levels -Rifabutin may decrease Saquinivir blood levels -other agents that affect the CYP3A4 isoenzyme of the Cytochrome P450 system (liver metabolism) can affect Saquinivir blood concentrations.
<p>
<b>Protease inhibitor future developments</b>:

<li>Roche and Merck will colaborate in conducting a study of the combination of their 2 protease inhibitors; 
<p>
<li>Roche and Abbott will conduct a similar study of their 2 protease inhibitors. 
<p>
<li>Agouron will be starting their 3 U.S. phase III trials within a few months. 
<p>
<li>Glaxo Wellcome is developing a protease inhibitor (Vx-478), for which preliminary in vitro studies have displayed minimal potential for cross-resistance with other protease inhibitors. 
<p>
As well, other protease inhibitors are in development.
</ul>

<p><b>D4T - (Stavudine - Zerit)</b><br>
Bristol- Myers presented the results of their clinical confirmatory trial (#019), for the purpose of attaining full approval for D4T; they had previously received Accelerated Approval. Extracting a decision from the committee was more difficult in this case than for the other 2 hearings. The committee was very indecisive and unreluctant about granting approval of D4T; Dr. Feigal, of the FDA, had to coax a decision out of them. Some observers of the entire three days of hearings thought the committee may have been getting increasingly conservative. Maybe, the committee members were tired because three full days on this panel can be exhausting.</p>

<p>D4T's indication for Accelerated Approval, granted in June of 1994, was for those individuals who were failing or intolerant to AZT. This confirmatory trial (#019) studied individuals with a minimum of 6 months prior AZT experience, but actually the average prior AZT experience was about 1 1/2 years. Bristol, although not requesting a specific indication, is expecting the FDA to approve D4T for those-- who are failing or intolerant to AZT or have prior AZT experience of at least 6 months (since that was the criteria for the study).</p>

<p>At the end of a confusing and picky discussion by the committee, they recommended by a 4-3 vote that D4T should receive full traditional approval for patients with (possibly prolonged) prior AZT experience. The committee was uncertain and seemed lost in trying to figure out the wording they wanted to recommend. Now, this goes to the FDA and they will sort this out and come up with a final wording.</p>

<p>There were two issues that seemed to cause some reluctance on the part of committee members to grant the full approval: (1) the statistical significance of the study was not quite at the level they wanted to see, and (2) the data, although establishing that D4T had efficacy for AZT experienced individuals, was not overwhelming. Remember, for full approval, the issue is clinical endpoints-- not necessarily surrogate markers (CD4 and RNA). The 3 clinical endpoints used as parameters in the study were -- (1) time to first CD4 failure (a 50% reduction in CD4), (2) time to first AIDS-defining event, and (3) death. The data for the first endpoint-- CD4 failure-- was convincing; the data for the other two endpoints were not as convincing to the Committee members, although it seemed adequate. But, that was the point causing reluctance on the part of the committee members.</p>

<p>It was mentioned at the hearing how many physicians are using D4T as first line therapy, instead of AZT. Bristol stressed the future use of D4T in combination with other drugs. The following drug combination studies utilizing D4T are ongoing:</p>

<ul>
<li>d4T + AZT
<li>d4T + ddI
<li>d4T + 3TC
</ul>

<p>Both Merck and Agouron are utilizing d4T in their Phase III approval trials for their protease inhibitors. In the Abbott >100 CD4 study, some participants are probably using d4T because it is a standard of care option, i.e. participants can use any approved antiviral treatment.</p>

<p>Of note is the d4T + ddI study that Bristol is currently conducting. Data from this study will be presented at the Antiretroviral Conference in January of 1996. Its a study of 85 to 90 AZT-naive individuals and preliminarily the data is attractive. The decreases in viral load were impressive; but, the only data available now is for a small number of people.</p>

<p>Apparently, d4T is a useful tool in our arsenal in designing treatment alternatives; it should definitely be available to physicians and people with HIV or AIDS as an option in designing treatment regimens. Although the Committee had trouble sorting out the indication, the FDA should be granting full approval for d4T with an appropriate indication.</p>

<p><b>d4T- pediatrics</b><br>
Bristol has ongoing pediatric trials and we can expect an application for approval within a few months. The pediatric needs have been taking a back burner compared to drug development for adults. If they want to, drug companies can pursue pediatric development without delaying adult development. The problem, as I see it, is the companies don't feel the necessity because they haven't been sufficiently pressured by our community as they have been for adult development. However, myself and a few others at this hearing spoke openly in support of the need for a stronger commitment to pediatric drug development from the drug manufacturers.</p>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>DHEA INFO SHEET</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What Is It Really?</b><br>
DHEA is a naturally occurring hormone produced in your adrenal gland. No one has yet figured out everything that it does or how important it is, but among other things, it is part of the process by which testosterone is produced. DHEA has been around a long time and has been studied for its effects on heart disease, cancer, mood, viral infections and weight, mostly in test tube and animal studies. It has been available on and off again on the underground for several years, has been used in a few small HIV studies but never in a sizeable long term study that would give us some clear answers about if and how it works, and at what dose.</p>

<p><b>DHEA and HIV</b><br>
DHEA has been looked at as a possible HIV treatment for some time now primarily because studies document that many HIV positive men have significantly lower than usual levels of DHEA in their blood. A 1991 retrospective study noted an increased risk for AIDS in HIV-infected men with 200-499 T cells with lower than normal DHEA levels and concluded that DHEA may have some protective effect against progression to AIDS.</p>

<p><b>How's It Work</b><br>
Exactly how this gradual depletion of DHEA affects progression to disease is unknown. However, DHEA may play a role in the immune system. Some test tube studies suggest that the loss of DHEA may be part of the process that shifts the immune system balance from responses that control HIV to inflammatory responses that actually stimulate HIV (often associated with the "bad" cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6). These studies report that DHEA is a potent enhancer of gamma-interferon and IL-2 production by activated T cells, while reducing production of TNF-alpha. Still, other test tube studies report that DHEA has direct antiviral effects in HIV-infected lymphocytes and macrophages, but this may be mediated by DHEA's effect on the immune system. Yet another test tube study suggests that DHEA can keep TNF-alpha, oxygen free radicals and proteins from other viruses such as herpes from "turning on" latent HIV in infected cells. Other researchers including Dr. Don Kotler are interested in DHEA's role as a testosterone precursor, since levels of this hormone also tend to drop, particularly in people with wasting syndrome. While sort of a which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg-scenario, it is possible that the loss of DHEA may have something to do with the shift in metabolism in PWAs that causes the loss of lean muscle mass. Kotler thinks that someone should do a study to see whether restoring, or keeping DHEA levels constant will keep testosterone levels from falling, and/or have an anabolic (muscle building) effect in men and women. (Especially, since DHEA may have less masculinizing effects than <a href="../../network/simple/steroids.html">anabolic steroids</a>.)</p>

<p><b>DHEA Studies in PWAs</b><br>
A drug company (Elan) sponsored a study in Europe using their formulation of DHEA. The trial found no significant anti-HIV effect (as measured by p24) but there were CD4 cell boosts in 5 out of 13 PWAs taking it. The company's subsequent studies reportedly showed no benefit and their program was discontinued. Meanwhile, researchers in San Francisco ran a sixteen week study in 31 HIV positive men with CD4 cell counts between 250-600. The doses ranged from 750 mg/day to 2,250 mg/day. There were no serious toxicities. There was no significant antiviral effect or increases in CD4 cell counts. The most interesting thing the researchers found was that the level of DHEA in the blood didn't increase much with the higher doses. A small study using lower doses has been run in PWAs by a researcher in Texas. A poster at Yokohama presented data from the twelve people taking 75 mg DHEA per day. Two PWAs died before a year had passed, but nine out of ten of the remaining patients had an increase in CD4 cell counts. Of course, these little uncontrolled studies are impossible to interpret. There are no studies of DHEA in HIV- positive women because of concern about its side effects (see below). Although women naturally have less DHEA than men, depressed levels have been associated with increased risk for breast and ovarian cancers. As there is no published data on how DHEA works in large numbers of PWAs and people with HIV, particularly in the long run, we do not know how DHEA affects the course of HIV infection.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Other Studies</b><br>
A study was recently published that evaluated the effects of small amounts of DHEA (50 mg/day) in men and women aged between 40-70, since people produce less DHEA as they get older. The researchers came up with the dose by calculating how much DHEA it would take to get people up to the levels produced in their twenties. After two weeks on DHEA, people's DHEA blood levels almost doubled. Women on DHEA saw their level of masculinizing hormones, such as testosterone increase. Interestingly, only one woman reported increased facial hair -- but so did one on placebo. There was no change in libido, but people on DHEA did feel significantly better both physically, and moodwise. They slept better, felt more relaxed, had increased energy and a better ability to handle stress. Another interesting change was an increase in insulin-like growth factor levels, a hormone that stimulates anabolism (the construction of body tissue, including muscle but not fat). However, no change in weight or body fat percentage was seen over the three months on DHEA. DHEA has been studied as a weight loss drug in young women. Ironically other studies have shown that it could increase lean muscle mass in young men. Subsequent studies could not verify either of these results. However, as a precursor to testosterone (which has anabolic effects) it is possible that DHEA mildly stimulates an anabolic process in people, which means the body burns fat for its energy while converting new food into muscle. The studies of DHEA for weight gain or fat loss may be flawed because they didn't take into account participants physical activity -- important since no anabolic steroid can help you build muscles unless you exercise. Regardless, none of these studies involved PWAs so we do not know how DHEA affects PWAs' altered metabolism.</p>

<p><b>Side Effects and Toxicity</b><br>
<b>1.</b> Only minor side effects have been reported for men with short term use, such as nasal congestion and mild insomnia (reported by one person taking 2250 mg a day in the dose-ranging study). For women, DHEA may have testosterone-like effects, such as increased facial hair and menstrual changes. <b>2.</b> DHEA may elevate IL-2 levels in people, and we know from clinical trials that IL-2 has been shown to increase viral load in PWAs with less than 200 CD4 cells. It is possible that DHEA may also activate CD4 cells leaving them more susceptible to infection with HIV. So despite its anti-HIV effects, it is remotely possible that over the long run, DHEA might speed up T cell decline. It's impossible to say right now since there is no data on long term use of DHEA. Because of this concern, the PWA Health Group requires a prescription to be sure that a doctor is watching your viral load and T cells counts.</p>

<p><b>Dosing</b><br>
We don't have a clue what the proper dose of DHEA is. DHEA sappears to be fairly easily absorbed, although much of it is rapidly excreted in the urine. It may be that the body can only absorb so much, and simply flushes the rest. For example, the San Francisco study reported no proportional increase in the amount of DHEA that was absorbed with the higher doses. Meanwhile, the study in the 40-70 year old people reported that a dose as low as 50 mg a day was adequate to restore DHEA levels to what to normal. Anecdotally, people have been taking between 750 mg/day and 1500 mg/day, but everyone could be taking way too much. If you can afford it, most labs can monitor your hormone levels, so it may make sense to see what your DHEA levels are first. Then choose a dose, take it for a few weeks, and get tested again to see whether your DHEA levels are back to normal.</p>

<p><b>What We Carry</b><br>
Each batch of the DHEA we carry is pharmaceutical grade DHEA that we analyze in a high tech laboratory to check for potency and purity. Copies of the quality control reports are available for your inspection.</p>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>HYPERICIN/ST. JOHN'S WORT INFO SHEET</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What Is It Really?</b><br>
St. John's Wort is a naturally occurring herb which contains a chemical called hypericin. Synthetic forms of hypericin are under investigation as an anti-HIV treatment. The herbal product is available through buyers clubs and some health food stores. The synthetic hypericin is currently only available through clinical trials.</p>

<p><b>The Theory Behind Taking Hypericin/St. John's Wort</b><br>People have been growing St. John's Wort for centuries and herb lore has long attributed curative properties to it. Lately researchers have confirmed that one of the chemicals derived from the plant, hypericin, has potent activity in the test tube against a wide range of viruses including HIV, CMV, and maybe HPV (genital warts). Hypericin interferes with viral budding, that is, when new viruses pop out of an infected cell. Exposure to light makes hypericin even more active.</p>

<p><b>Studies in PWAs</b><br>
One ACTG trial used an intravenous synthetic hypericin that delivered very high but short-lived levels of hypericin to the blood. Exposure to that much hypericin at once caused side effects like painful itching, burning sensations and severe rash, known as photo-toxicity. The short half-life meant that they could not get levels in the blood equal to the levels that had an anti-HIV effect in the test tube. All and all, a lose-lose situation. A new ACTG study has begun to study an oral formula designed to get more consistent levels of the drug in the blood. One positive thing may have come out of the study, though. The hypericin may have caused a spontaneous remission of a bad case of genital warts in one patient. Last year, results were published from a small open label study that followed 18 patients using an injectable hypericin (that we don't carry but other buyer's clubs may) and oral hypericin. Two patients were not evaluable. The researchers reported that of the remaining sixteen patients, fourteen had stable or increased CD4 cell counts, and did not develop opportunistic infections during the course of the study.</p>

<p><b>Purity of Product</b><br>
We know next to nothing about the purity, or consistency of the St. John's Wort products that we carry. They are not pharmaceutical grade products, and like many products sold at health food stores, you have only the manufacturer's assurance that they practice good quality control. In every brand of St. John's Wort available, the amount of hypericin is small. HY2 is more potent and more expensive, but we don't know how much active hypericin is really in either product or whether these amounts are consistent. Both products also contain pseudo-hypericin, which also has anti-viral activity in the test tube.</p>

</blockquote>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=right>
<blockquote>

<p><b>Dosing</b><br>
There is no information about how much St. John's Wort one should use. For one thing, we do not know if PWAs can absorb enough hypericin from herbal products to cause the anti-viral effects seen in test tube studies. Secondly, we can't guarantee the dose of hypericin in any of these products. We don't have the slightest clue what the most adequate dose of Yerba Prima or HY2 is in PWAs. We suggest you consult with your doctor in choosing a dose of St. John's Wort. The manufaturers of each product recommend the following doses: Yerba Prima, 1 tablet twice a day (some PWAs on the underground report taking anywhere from 2-16 tablets). HY2, between 2 and 5 tablets a day.</p>

<p><b>Side Effects and Toxicity</b><br>
The most common hypericin-related toxicity was first seen in livestock. Cows that grazed on St. John's Wort came down with photo-toxic reactions — severe sores. The PWAs in the synthetic hypericin study had photo-toxic reactions which were very painful, including severe rashes, itching and burning sensations. Exposure to the sun could be debilitating. No studies have ever evaluated the toxicity of the two herbal products that we carry. Some clients using higher doses of either product have reported that they occasionally experienced the rash or burning sensations."</p>

<p><b>What We Carry</b><br>
Studies about the pure synthetic hypericin tell us little about the herbal products we carry: Yerba Prima tablets, and Pacifics Biologics' HY2. Yerba Prima comes in bottles of 180 X 250 mg tablets. The manufacturer claims it contains 0.14% hypericin. HY2, made by Pacific BioLogics, Inc., comes in bottles of 150 capsule. Each capsule contains 750 mg of St. John's Wort, of which 2.25 mg is mixed hypericin. There is no information which indicates that the amount of hypericin contained even in the brand with the highest concentration (Pacific Biologics) is any where near the level necessary to inhibit HIV.</p>

<p><b>Open Clinical Trials</b><br>
There are no studies of herbal hypericin currently running in the US. However, the ACTG is running a dose-ranging study evaluating the anti-viral activity of a new oral synthetic hypericin at Bellevue/New York University and Beth Israel in Boston. To participate in the study you need to have a CD4 cell count between 50-350 and must not have used any other anti-HIV drug for at least a month. For more information, in New York call Mary Ann Kiernan at (212) 263-6565, in Boston call Sheila Hussey at (617) 735-4103. In Boston, they are also running a small study looking at oral synthetic hypericin's activity against genital warts.</p>

<title>PWA Health Group: isoprinosine</title>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>ISOPRINOSINE INFO SHEET</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What Is It Really? </b><br>
Isoprinosine (inosine pranobex) is an old drug that has been extensively studied and used in many countries for herpes, genital warts, influenza, melanomas, other tumors, hepatitis B, and a rare brain inflammation in children caused by the zoster virus (subacute sclerosing panencephalopathy). No one really knew how it worked (not that it always did) until someone noticed that it seemed to be boosting people's immune response, perhaps by helping the body recognize that it was under attack. When the AIDS crisis struck, it was one of the first drugs evaluated.</p>

<p><b>The Theory Behind Isoprinosine</b><br>
Isoprinosine does not have any effect on HIV itself. Instead, it has been reported to stimulate various T cell, and other immune cell functions in both test tube and clinical studies. However, the way it does this — its mechanism of action — is not known. Furthermore, the data is often contradictory. Taken as a whole, the data suggest that isoprinosine helps the cell mediated immune response, the part of the immune system responsible for destroying diseased human cells in the body (as opposed to fighting viruses, bacteria or other infectious organisms swimming in your blood). Many studies say that this immune boosting effect is modest, and the immune restoration only partial.</p>

<p><b>Clinical Studies in PWAs</b><br>
The first small studies of isoprinosine reported positive results, including rises in CD4 cell counts. Larger subsequent studies did not show CD4 cell rises. One study gave a twenty-eight day regimen of two doses of isoprinosine or placebo to 63 HIV positive patients with ARC or swollen lymph glands, and then monitored these patients for a year. The study concluded that half of the patients who took 3 grams of isoprinosine had significant clinical improvement, and most had sustained increases in natural killer cells, total lymphocytes and CD4/CD8 ratios. Another study in combination with ribavirin reported no immunological benefits whatsoever. In fact, people suffered unexpected drops in their white blood cell counts. Three larger clinical studies examining isoprinosine in HIV-infected people report very conflicting results. Bad News From The Sponsor: The Newport Pharmaceutical study examined 696 HIV-infected, asymptomatic men with T cells between 200 and 400 in the United States and Britain. Half the men received 4 grams of isoprinosine per day; the other half, a placebo. After six months, no difference was seen between the placebo and isoprinosine.</p>

<p><b>Mediocre News From Italy</b><br>
Another study, conducted in Italy, followed 553 asymptomatic patients. Patients were given 3 grams of isoprinosine a day, or a placebo for three months. After one year, researchers claimed that there was a slightly improved clinical condition in the people on isoprinosine. Also, their CD4/CD8 ratios were preserved better than patients given placebo. Great News From Denmark: In a Danish study 866 people with a wide range of T cells were given either 3 grams of isoprinosine per day or placebo. After 6 months, the isoprinosine group had far fewer cases of AIDS — indicating that isoprinosine significantly delayed progression to disease. At the same time, however, isoprinosine had no effect on p24 antigen or any immune parameter such as T cell levels.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Making Sense of the Clinical Data</b><br>
This is one of those cases where there is widely contradictory data on the drug. It is hard to just dismiss any of the above studies - although each had some flaws. A number of explanations have been suggested. One test tube study notes that a metabolite (by-product) of isoprinosine has anti-PCP activity. Participants in the Danish study took no PCP prophylaxis, and most of the patients on placebo that progressed came down with PCP. Isoprinosine may simply have kept treated patients from developing this opportunistic infection, and its benefit had nothing at all to do with immune reconstitution. Another possibility is that isoprinosine could slow progression because of its anti-herpes activity. Dosing regimens also appear to be very important with some immune modulators. Taking an immune modulator for a month, and then stopping treatment could be better than continual use, which may make your system too acclimated to respond to the drug. In many of the smaller isoprinosine studies that reported immunologic changes, people were given drug a short length of time, e.g. one month, and then monitored. One doctor in Switzerland gives his patients two months of isoprinosine followed by a wash-out period. Nevertheless, right now, it is unclear how, or if, the drug helps people with HIV. This is another drug caught in limbo - contradictory data and no on-going studies to resolve the dispute.</p>

<p><b>Other Studies of Isoprinosine Herpes, Zoster, EBV</b><br>
In clinical trials, <a href="../../network/access/drugs/acyc.html">acyclovir</a> consistently out-performs isoprinosine. But, a number of studies report that the combination is superior to either drug alone.</p>

<P><b>Molluscum</b><br>
One small study reports positive results treating molluscum in HIV negative children.</p>

<p><b>Genital Warts</b><br>
A study in 165 "heterosexual" men and women with genital warts reported that isoprinosine was more effective than conventional treatment (podophyllin or cryotherapy or electrocautery) for older warts, and conventional treatment was superior for more recent lesions. Combination therapy (1 gram isoprinosine 3 times a day for one month plus conventional treatment) increased the success rate from 41% to 94%.</p>

<P><b>Side Effects and Toxicity</b></br>
Isoprinosine seems to be well tolerated. The few side effects reported included: dizziness, problems with digestion (for example, slight stomach pain and feeling full after you ate only a small amount of food), and itching. As noted above, when given with ribavirin, there was a drop in people's white blood cell (lymphocyte) counts. People who take AZT and isoprinosine together have been shown to sustain higher levels of AZT in their blood.</p>

<p><b>Dosing</b><br>
There is no way to know what the proper dose is. However the clinical studies thus far have examined between 1 - 4 grams per day. The Danish study used 1 gram three times a day. The tablets we distribute are 500 MG each. To take the doses used in the studies, you would take between 2 and 8 tablets every day. To our knowledge, only one study has evaluated how isoprinosine is absorbed and excreted in humans. This study demonstrated that isoprinosine doesn't stay in the body very long. To keep consistent levels of isoprinosine in the body would require fairly frequent oral doses, three or more times a day. Taking isoprinosine as an injection or an enema may deliver initially higher doses into the blood, but the body eliminates this isoprinosine just as quickly. We don't know whether the body requires consistent levels of an immune modulator in order to respond to it, but if it does, oral dosing is the easiest way to acheive this.</p>

<P><b>What We Carry</b><br>
We carry isoprinosine made by Newport Pharmaceuticals. It comes in boxes of 20 tablets of 500 MG each.</p>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>KETOTIFEN INFO SHEET</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What Is It?</b><br>
Ketotifen is very safe antihistamine (like Seldane or Benadryl) used extensively in Europe to treat bronchial asthma and allergies. It is also being studied as a treatment for colitis. The PWA Health Group is importing ketotifen because of preliminary reports that it lowers elevated levels of TNF-alpha, and can help PWAs gain weight.</p>

<p><b>The Theory Behind Ketotifen</b><br>
German researchers have published data showing that ketotifen lowers tnf-alpha in the test tube. TNF-alpha is a naturally occuring protein that is often highly elevated in people with HIV and may be a primary part of HIV disease. It can turn on latent HIV, increasing the production of new virus; as well as cause generalized inflammation and AIDS related weight loss. But in addition to reducing TNF-alpha, ketotifen may help people gain weight in other ways. When used for asthma, weight gain and an increase in appetite were among the most frequent side effects. Ketotifen also protects the cells in the stomach, small intestine and perhaps the rest of the gut from a number of toxins. It is also being studied as a way to treat inflammatory bowel disease/colitis which has much in common with HIV-related gut problems. A number of case studies suggest that ketotifen may be helpful treating skin problems such as acne. Ketotifen also reduces edema (swelling and puffiness caused by water retention) around sores.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Ketotifen Studies in PWAs</b><br>
Rather than focusing on ketotifen's TNF reduction as a means of slowing down HIV, the pragmatic Germans wondered what the drug might do for wasting. They published data from two small pilot studies in PWAs at last year's AIDS conference. One study used ketotifen in combination with oxymethadone, a steroid like Megace that helps people gain weight, so it is hard to gauge what effect ketotifen had (the study notes a 14% reduction in TNF-alpha levels and weight gains of 11-12 pounds in less than four weeks). A larger placebo controlled study of this combination is underway. The other study used ketotifen by itself in eight patients with elevated TNF-alpha, (but no wasting). Taking ketotifen for 12 weeks, these patients gained an average of six pounds, had increases in their body cell mass and reductions in their TNF-alpha levels.</p>

<p><b>Side Effects and Toxicity</b><br>
Ketotifen is virtually non-toxic (although it is not advised for patients with epilepsy). People who took twenty times the recommended dose (in suicide attempts) suffered no serious consequences (other than embarrassment). Its primary side effects seem to be temporary drowsiness, dry mouth,(and other mucuos membranes) appetite stimulation and weight gain.</p>

<p><b>Ketotifen in Kids</b><br>
Ketotifen is one of the rare drugs that has been extensively used and shown to be safe in children (above six months old). One study was in 107 children between six months and three years old with asthma. Children under 1 year were given .5 mg twice daily, the older children got 1 mg twice daily. Not only did the kid's asthma improve, they gained weight too.</p>

<p><b>Dosing</b><br>
No studies have been done to find the most effective dose for weight gain in PWAs. However, the German researchers are using 1 mg, four times a day for a total of 4 mg a day. However, much higher doses have been shown to be quite safe.</p>

<p><b>What We Carry</b><br>
We import Zaditen brand ketotifen made by Sandoz Parmaceuticals in France. Each box contains 60 1 mg capsules. At the 4 mg a day dose, a box should last 15 days.</p>

<title>PWA Health Group: memantine</title>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>MEMANTINE INFO SHEET</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What Is It?</b><br>
Memantine is a derivative of the decades old anti-influenza drug amantadine. Memantine is used in Germany to treat Parkinson's disease, dementia in the elderly, and to speed the recovery of comatose patients. Memantine may also be useful for PWAs with HIV encephalopathy (which can mean anything including memory loss, confusion, difficulty speaking, walking, and/or concentrating).</p>

<p><b>Memantine in PWAs</b><br>
While some PWAs have been using memantine, and the AIDS Clinical Trial Group is currently planning to study it, at present there is no data from any clinical study in PWAs. We'll keep you posted on upcoming trials. Since there is no proven treatment for HIV-related neurologic problems, the PWA Health has decided to import memantine for any PWA with a doctor's prescription.</p>

<p><b>The Theory Behind Memantine</b><br>
While the root cause of neurologic problems in PWAs is different from what causes Parkinson's or dementia in the elderly, people with these problems all lose neurons, the key brain or nerve cell, in much the same way. (PWAs with encephalopathy can lose up to 20-50% of their neurons.) How does this happen? Much of what we know comes from experience in Parkinson's disease. As the theory goes, too much of certain amino acids in the brain send signals to neurons that make them self-destruct. Memantine keeps to a minimum the destructive signals that neurons receive. These amino acids may be elevated in some PWA's too. What's worse, test tube and animal studies show that the HIV protein gp120 can also send neurons self-destruct signals. But until we know to what extent HIV related neurologic disorders are caused by these signals, we can't predict how helpful memantine will be in PWAs. If the theory is correct, another drug being studied in PWAs for neurologic problems, nimodipine, may increase the effect of memantine. With a prescription you can get nimodipine from a pharmacy, but it is very expensive, and since it isn't approved for this purpose, your insurance may not want to pay for it.</p>

<p>Want more info? We have references available. Just ask us.</p>

<p><b>Dosing</b><br>
We don't know the best dose for PWAs. In other groups, doses range from 5-60 mg a day, depending on the condition that it is being used for. 10-30 mg a day seems to be the standard maintenance dose in patients with Parkinson's disease. Since there isn't much information on the use of memantine in PWAs, it may make sense to start at a low dose, such as 5 mg a day (see below).</p>

</blockquote>
<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=2 width=400>
<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=right>
<blockquote>

<p><b>Side Effects and Toxicity</b><br>
Memantine is fairly well tolerated in the elderly. One study noted a few cases of restlessness, insomnia and nervous energy (such as pacing, fidgeting). An open label study in fourteen patients with Parkinson's using 30 mg/day reported that four (28%) of these patients quit memantine because of nervous energy, emotional agitation, confusion, dizziness and stomach upset. One doctor who has monitored some PWAs using memantine reports no serious side effects. She starts patients at a low dose, watches for adverse reactions and then gradually increases the dose. A number of PWAs have safely used related drugs, such as amantadine and Flumadine, which may bode well for the use of memantine. Even so, since there have been no clinical trials using memantine in PWAs, be very careful if you decide to take this drug. The potential for adverse or unexpected side effects for this kind of drug might be much greater in PWAs. Let your doctor know immediately of any adverse reaction, such as feeling like you want to climb the walls, emotional agitation, headaches, stomach aches and changes in mucous secretions, sweating, or any other sign of body dehydration.</p>

<p><b>Note</b><br>
Be extra careful if you are on any antidepressants such as Prozac or Zoloft since memantine may effect the way they work. You might be extra prone to hyperactivity or "manic" states if you take these drugs together. There could be a dangerous interactions between memantine and MAO inhibitors (including phenelzine sulfate, pargyline hydrochloride and methylclothiazide, furazolidone, isocarboxazid, procarbazine and tranylcypromine). If you are taking any of these start at a low dose of memantine. If you have ever had seizures you should be cautious with memantine. Data from animal studies suggest that very high doses of memantine could make seizures worse.</p>

<p><b>What We Carry</b><br>
The PWA Health Group carries Akatinol brand memantine made by Merz Pharmaceuticals in Germany. It comes in boxes of 50 x 10 mg tablets (which can be split in half for patients who wish to start at 5 mg a day).</p>

<p><b>How Can You Get Memantine?</b><br>
The PWA Health Group can help you import memantine from Germany. To order it from us, you must have your doctor write a prescription.</p>

<title>PWA Health Group: NAC</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#5c4033" vlink="#545454">
<img src="../gifs/pwa.gif">

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>NAC INFO SHEET</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What Is It Really?</b><br>
NAC (N- acetylcysteine) is a derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid cysteine. In the United States, NAC is available by prescription as an aerosol drug (similar to aerosolized pentamidine) to treat bronchitis. NAC is also used in liquid form in very high doses to treat Tylenol overdoses. In Europe, NAC is very commonly used for bronchitis, and is produced in two oral forms.</p>

<p><b>The Theory Behind NAC</b><br>
One reason PWAs take NAC is to try to pump up levels of glutathione (GSH). GSH is a vital protein that cells need to function. Many studies have documented low GSH in people with HIV. Dr. Luc Montagnier's work with CD4 cells from PWAs suggests that even cells without HIV can grow weak and die, but with added GSH can regain their vigor. This is where NAC comes in. NAC is broken down by the body into cysteine. Researchers have also noted that low levels of cysteine in PWAs. The body uses cysteine to replace glutathione. Taking NAC may be a way to add cysteine, so that your body can replenish depleted GSH levels. It is still unclear whether NAC is converted to GSH in PWAs.</p>

<p><b>More Theory Behind Taking NAC</b><br>
Whether or not NAC is converted to GSH, it might help protect the body from the effects of excess TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor). TNF is a naturally occurring protein in your body. It's often elevated in people with HIV and may be a part of HIV disease. It can turn on latent HIV, and increase HIV reproduction. It can cause a generalized inflammatory response that may be critical to AIDS-related weight loss. Both GSH and NAC interfere with TNF in the test tube.</p>

<p>NAC and GSH are also anti-oxidants -substances that mop up free radicals, volatile particles produced naturally in the body, especially when you have an infection. Too many free radicals can cause inflammation and damage organs; and like TNF, may turn on and speed the spread of HIV. How much these free radicals contribute to HIV disease is unclear.</p>

<p>There are reports that taking NAC with <a href="../../network/access/drugs/daps.html">dapsone</a> reduces some of that drug's toxicity without reducing its effectiveness. There are ongoing studies in Canada to see whether NAC may decrease PWAs' allergic reactions to <a href="../../network/access/drugs/tmp.html">Bactrim/Septra</a>.</p>

<p><b>NAC Studies in PWAs</b><br>
Studies of NAC seem to have raised more questions than they've answered. An NIH study was disappointing: after 12 weeks of taking up to 9600 mg a day, NAC had no effect on CD4 cell counts or p24 (a sloppy marker of HIV activity). However, PWAs in the study had regular GSH levels, so NAC shouldn't have done much for them anyway. More research is needed to see what NAC can do for PWAs who have low GSH levels.</p>

<p>This NIH study created a storm of controversy. The researchers reported that NAC was very poorly absorbed - it did not get into the blood, and that people in the study had no change in their intracellular GSH levels. Other researchers protested that the NIH didn't follow the proper procedures for measuring NAC or GSH levels.</p>

<p>A later study in HIV positive people with low GSH reported increased intracellular GSH 4 hours after taking a single dose of NAC (figured as @1800 mg if you weigh 130 pounds). A small study at Stanford also reported that 7 PWAs taking 1000-2000 mg for up to 12 weeks had an immediate increase in intracellular GSH. There's an on-going study at Stanford using 8000 mg/day to sort this out.</p>

<p><b>2 new studies (summer '94)</b><br>
15 people with HIV in Brazil took either 400 mg iv twice a day, or 600 mg capsules twice a day. The 8 people on iv NAC fared best, moving from an average of 256 CD4 cells to 501. The 7 people taking the oral dose went from 403 CD4s to 563, and 1449 CD8s to 2376.</p>

<p>Much more interesting was a one-year, three arm Mexican study of 300 people with HIV. The study compared AZT (500 mg) to AZT/ddC and AZT/ddC/NAC (NAC-1500 mg/day). There were significant differences in opportunistic infections and CD4 counts between the AZT-only group and the other two groups. AZT only: 62% developed new OIs, and their CD4's slipped from an average of 247 to 181 over the course of the year. AZT/ddC: 32% got OIs and their CD4s rose steadily from 175 to 294. AZT/ddC/NAC: 23% developed OIs and their CD4 cells went from 148 to 356. The difference between taking AZT/ddC or the NAC combo was not statistically significant, but adding NAC seemed to show a trend toward greater response.</p>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=right>
<blockquote>

<p><b>Dosing</b><br>
No one knows what the best dose of NAC is. Most PWAs in America take between 1200-1800 mg a day based upon test tube data, and the advice of American researchers who have been studying NAC in HIV disease for years. This may not be the best dose in the body. A German researcher who has also been working with PWAs and NAC for several years maintains that people should take 400-600 mg three times a week, preferably two hours after exercise (the less is more theory). Who's right? Only large clinical trials will tell.</p>

<p><b>Side Effects and Toxicity</b><br>
NAC has been used safely at doses up to 11,000 mg a day, but side effects can occur. A few clients from the Health Group have also reported some stomach upset and diarrhea while on NAC. One patient in the NIH study had an anaphylactoid reaction (a severe bronchial spasm) in the highest IV dose group. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea and weight loss were also seen in this study, but these effects were not necessarily caused by NAC.</p>

<p>No drug interactions were reported from the NIH study. However, the Martindale Extra Pharmacopoeia reports that some antibiotics, including amphotericin, ampicillin, erythromycin and tetracycline may be incompatible or inactivated when mixed with NAC.</p>

<p>PWAs with a history of ulcers should perhaps avoid NAC, since it can reduce mucous that they need to protect their stomachs.</p>

<p>NAC is a chelating agent, and may purge minerals from your body. Nutritionists recommend keeping track of minerals and taking some supplements if necessary.</p>

<p><b>What We Carry</b><br>
The Health Group imports pharmaceutical grade NAC from Switzerland and Germany. In the US, several companies make NAC and sell it through health food stores. Is there a difference between imported NAC and health food store NAC? We don't know. Health food store NAC can be cheaper. Health food products are manufactured with no FDA monitoring to guarantee the quality. We paid an independent laboratory to test one brand of health store NAC. It was fine. But this tells us nothing about the product's shelf-life, or even other jars of the same product.</p>

<p>Pharmaceutical grade NAC is guaranteed to have a standard amount of NAC in each tablet. It is also packaged in air tight wrapping (the capsules) or with a dessicant in the lid (effervescents) so that the NAC will not degrade once it is exposed to air. The third difference is that pharmaceutical grade NAC also contains a mild buffer, so it's gentler on the digestive system.</p>

<p>We carry two kind of NAC: 800 mg effervescent tablets and 200 mg capsules. The effervescent form is cheaper per mg.</p>

<ul>
<li>Effervescent NAC comes as fizzy tablets which you dissolve in 8 oz. of water, like alka seltzer. The tablets are made by Elan SA in Switzerland, where they are approved for bronchitis. This brand of NAC comes in tubes of 10 x 800 mg tablets. Each tube costs $8.50. This NAC contains Nutrasweet (aspartame).

<li>Capsules: Fluimucil Kapseln are regular capsules — swallowed like any other pill. The capsules are made by Inpharzam, a subsidiary of the Zambon Group, in Germany. The capsules (200 mg each) come 15 to a box for $14.00 per box and have no sweetener.

<title>PWA Health Group: oral amphotericin B (Fungilin)</title>

<img src="../gifs/pwa.gif">

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>ORAL AMPHOTERICIN B INFO SHEET</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Description</b><br>
Oral amphotericin B (Fungilin) has been approved in most European countries for decades. It's used as a treatment and prophylaxis for a variety of oral and GI fungal infections, including oral thrush. In the United States, only an intravenous (IV) form of amphotericin B is available. The Health Group can help you import the low-dose oral form (in either a liquid or lozenge form) from England.</p>

<p><b>Why do we help you import this drug?</b><br>
In the US, <a href="../../network/access/drugs/fluc.html">fluconazole</a> (Diflucan) and <a href="../../network/access/drugs/keto.html">ketaconazole</a> (Nizoral) are the most common antifungal medications. While they are usually highly effective, we have had many requests from physicians for oral ampho B because some PWAs develop resistant strains of thrush (candida) that no longer respond to either of these drugs. The resistant strains can become very nasty--causing mouth pain and extreme difficulty in eating. <a href="../../network/access/drugs/amph.html">Amphotericin B</a>, in its IV form is standard therapy for a very serious brain infection called cryptococcal meningitits. ORAL AMPHO CANNOT BE USED FOR CRYPTOCOCCAL MENINGITIS. THE ORAL FORM DOES NOT GET ABSORBED INTO THE BODY AND CANNOT HELP FUNGAL INFECTIONS OUTSIDE THE GI TRACT. Oral amphotericin B should NOT be used as an alternative for non-GI tract disease.</p>

<p><b>Toxicities</b><br>
Although the IV form of ampho B has long been dubbed ampho-terrible by PWAs due to its extreme side effects, the oral form is not toxic. No side effects have been noted at dosages under 3000 mg/day. Taking over 3000 mg/day can cause occasional stomach or intestinal discomfort, including diarrhea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Dosage</b><br>
The standard dose to treat symptoms is 400 mg/day, which may be raised if necessary. If you're taking oral ampho B for oral thrush, continue taking it for 2-3 days after your symptoms disappear. If you're taking it for GI infection, keep taking it for 2-3 weeks after your symptoms disappear.</p>

<p><b>Liquid Form</b><br>
The standard therapy is 1 ml four times a day. One ml equals 100 mg. Each bottle has its own pipette, squirt it into your mouth and swish it around well. Coat the insides of your mouth and then swallow it. Swish four times a day. If you cannot swallow, oral ampho B can be administered through a nasal-gastric tube before eating.</p>

<p><b>Lozenges</b><br>
Each lozenge is 100 mg. Take one tablet four times a day after eating, for two weeks. The dosage can be raised and/or taken for longer as necessary.</p>

<p><b>The Brand We Export</b><br>
We import Fungilin brand oral ampho B made by Squibb in England. The liquid form comes in 12 ml bottles, at a concentration of 100 mg/ml. At the recommended dose, one bottle is a 3 day supply. The lozenges come in a box of 56 tablets of 100 mg each for a thirteen and 1/2 day supply.</p>

<title>PWA Health Group: Peptide T</title>
</head>

<img src="../gifs/pwa.gif">

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>PEPTIDE T INFO SHEET</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What Is It, Really?</b><br>
Peptide T is a chain of 8 amino acids. These acids look like a portion of HIV's outer envelope. It is under investigation as a treatment for HIV-related neurological and constitutional symptoms. It is not approved anywhere in the world. In the United States, it is available only through clinical studies and buyer's clubs. It is an intranasal drug - - in other words, you squirt it up your nose. The PWA Health Group has it manufactured specifically for the underground.</p>

<p><b>What Does It Do?</b><br>
In test tube studies, Peptide T can block HIV from infecting new cells. Because of the test tube data, researchers originally thought it may be an antiviral drug. In clinical studies, though, Peptide T did not show a direct antiviral affect. It does not raise T cells nor does it lower p24 antigen. However, the clinical studies showed that Peptide T may have several other uses.</p>

<p><b>Neurological symptoms</b><br>
Several small studies have shown that Peptide T may be a treatment for cognitive problems, such as memory loss, and trouble with speaking. How, and if, Peptide T is able to help the nervous system is unclear. Some researchers believe that Peptide T protects cells from the harmful effects of HIV's envelope protein, gp120. gp120 can detach from HIV itself, bind to cells, and kill them. This free floating gp120 is thought to be a major factor in the development HIV-related neurologic disease. Some researchers believe that Peptide T restores part of the body's natural hormonal signalling network which may also be disrupted by free floating gp120. Other researchers are looking at its effects on cytokines including TNFalpha. A large neuro-cognitive trial is underway.</p>

<p><b>Peripheral Neuropathies</b><br>
A recent phase II clinical trial reports that Peptide T does not work for severe peripheral neuropathies, as once hoped. Whether it works for less severe cases remains to be seen.</p>

<p><b>Constitutional symptoms</b><br>
Peptide T may be able to alleviate symptoms like fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue. The studies needed to confirm this are still on-going.</p>

<p><b>Skin symptoms</b><br>
Small Swedish studies have suggested that Peptide T may help treat skin rashes, itching and psoriasis which many people with HIV experience. To our knowledge, there has been no research to confirm this.</p>

<p><b>Side Effects and Toxicity</b><br>
Peptide T appears to be completely non-toxic. Some people complain of a slight stinging when they squirt it up their nose. No drug interactions have been reported with Peptide T.</p>

</blockquote>
<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=2 width=400>
<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=right>
<blockquote>

<p><b>Dosing</b><br>
Most of the clinical studies are examining a 6 mg per day dose of Peptide T. We have no way of knowing whether this is the "right" dose. Other people on the underground have been using 3 mg per day.</p>

<p>Peptide T now comes in a solution of 10 mg/ml. Previous supplies of Peptide T on the underground were in a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Each bottle contains 90 mg of Peptide T in 9 ml of sterile water and benzyl alcohol.</p>

<p>The sprayers are pharmaceutical grade, imported from Germany. Each squirt gives an even 0.1 ml -- equal to 1 mg of Peptide T. If you want to take a 6 mg per day dose, you would shoot one squirt of Peptide T into each nostril three times a day (a total of six squirts a day.) At this dose, each bottle of Peptide T is an even 14 day supply.</p>

<p><b>How To Use and Store Peptide T</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Unscrew the blue plastic cap and screw on the sprayer. Once the sprayer is on, the bottle can leak, so keep it upright.

<li>Pump the sprayer to remove the excess air in the dip stick.

<li>Place the sprayer in your nostril and squirt. Do this in each nostril. Don't tip your head back. The Peptide T will run down the back of your throat.

<li>Replace the plastic cap back on the sprayer and put the bottle in a cool place until the next dose. It's not necessary to keep it in the refrigerator; however, it will not hurt it if you do.

<li>If you bought more than one bottle, you should keep the ones you aren't using in the refrigerator. Put them in the fridge, but make sure they don't freeze. Keep them cold not frozen!! When Peptide T gets cold, it turns into a clear goop (which looks like hair gel). If this happens, don't worry. The Peptide T is not damaged. Gently warm it in your hand or under slightly warm water (NOT HOT) and shake it. The peptide T will turn back to liquid soon.

<li>Remove and clean your sprayer when you finish the bottle. Clean it by squirting warm water and bleach through it a few times. Be sure to rinse it well before you use it again to ensure there is no bleach left in it.
</ol>

<p><b>Quality Control</b><br>
Every batch of Peptide T is made under sterile conditions in a high tech laboratory. Each batch is tested to ensure that the concentration is correct. Copies of the quality control reports for every batch are available for your inspection.</p>

<p><b>Open Peptide T Trials</b><br>
As you know, Peptide T is available on the underground. However, it is expensive to purchase it through us. Therefore, we strongly suggest that you consult your doctor about entering one of the on-going clinical trials. In a clinical study, you will get the drug for free. However, as of January, 1994, there are no clinical trials open in America. This might change in the next few months, so keep in touch.</p>

<title>PWA Health Group: ribavirin</title>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>RIBAVIRIN INFO SHEET</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What Is It, Really?</b><br>
Ribavirin was one of the first antiviral drugs ever discovered. It is approved in the United States in an aerosol form (similar to aerosolized pentamidine) for the treatment of a severe lung infection (RSV) in infants. It is being studied in combination with ddI as an anti-HIV treatment. More recently, it has shown activity against hepatitis A and C. Ribavirin is available in numerous Third World countries in an oral, tablet form. The PWA Health Group helps import oral ribavirin from Mexico.</p>

<p><b>Ribavirin in AIDS</b><br>
Since the beginning of the AIDS crisis, people have tried ribavirin as an anti-HIV treatment. Part of the early enthusiasm was due to the fact that, in test tubes, ribavirin can inhibit HIV. However many people were also misled by false and exaggerated claims made for the drug by it's US manufacturer, ICN Pharmaceuticals.</p>

<p><b>Ribavirin Used Alone</b><br>
Several large studies, conducted in many countries, have shown that ribavirin is not an effective treatment for HIV when used alone. In all studies for ribavirin used by itself, it was equivalent to placebo. Most researchers and physicians believe it should not be used as monotherapy.</p>

<p><b>Ribavirin With AZT</b><br>
Test tube studies show that ribavirin cancels out the effect of AZT. Although we don't know what would happen in people, the test tube data on this combination are very negative.</p>

<p><b>Ribavirin Combined with ddI</b><br>
Test tube and animal studies have indicated that ribavirin may increase the effect of ddI. In certain cell lines, ribavirin increased the effect of ddI ten-fold. In an experimental animal model of retrovirus infection, neither ribavirin nor ddI alone had an effect on tumour progression. However, when combined, they significantly delayed progression. We don't know exactly how ribavirin adds to ddI's effect, but it may be by changing the intracellular environment of ddI's target cells. The ACTG just finished a small study of the combination of ribavirin and ddI which indicated that at least the combo was safe. The researchers also reported that the anti-viral effect (as measured by viral load) was a little greater than is normally seen with ddI alone, but since this was not a controlled study, there is no way to say for sure whether this was a fluke or not. To find out, they plan on running a larger controlled study. We'll keep you informed.</p>

<p><b>Ribavirin in Hepatitis C</b><br>
A number of small uncontrolled studies suggested that ribavirin might have activity against hepatitis C. At a conference on Liver diseases last year, data was released from an NIH run study in 32 patients with hepatitis C treated with either ribavirin or placebo. The researchers reported that patients on ribavirin had improvement in liver enzymes that are used to measure disease activity and on-going liver damage. Out of sixteen patients on drug, liver enzymes normalized in four patients and decreased by at least 50% in seven patients. The average decrease for patients on drug was 47%. Two other phase III studies of ribavirin for hepatitis C recently finished and we should hear data soon. The company has now filed for approval of Ribavirin as a treatment for hepatitis C. We'll let you know what happens.</p>

<p><b>Ribavirin in Hepatitis A</b><br>
This spring, a Serbian study in ninety-nine patients with acute hepatitis reported that ribavirin had beneficial therapeutic effects in patients with hepatitis A. 57 patients with hepatitis A were treated with placebo or 200 mg of ribavirin four times a day for fourteen days. The liver enzymes in the patients who took the ribavirin decreased significantly faster, and were significantly lower than those given placebo. Interestingly, the study could find no therapeutic effect from ribavirin in 28 patients with acute hepatitis B.</p>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=right>
<blockquote>

<p><b>Dosing</b><br>
There is no clear information about which dose is most appropriate. Doses of 1200-1600 MG per day appear to be toxic. The planned ACTG study used 600mg of ribavirin per day in combination with a standard dose of ddI. The NIH hepatitis C study used 600 mg twice daily for twelve months. The hepatitis studies used 200 mg four times a day.</p>

<p><b>Side Effects and Toxicity</b><br>
Ribavirin can cause anemia and drops in T cells when given at doses of 1200-1600 mg per day. At the lower dose of 800 mg per day, ribavirin does not seem to cause anemia and appears to be well-tolerated.</p>

<p><b>What We Carry</b><br>
The PWA Health Group normally imports two brands of ribavirin: Virazole, is manufactured by ICN pharmaceuticals in the Netherlands. It comes in bottles of 20 tablets containing 200 mg each. Vilona is manufactured by ICN pharmaceuticals from Mexico. It comes in boxes of 12 tablets with 200 mg each. Until the price comes back down (it doubled in May '94) we will only carry the European brand.</p>

<p><b>Compassionate Use for Hepatitis C</b><br>
ICN now has a limited compassionate use program that provides ribavirin for free to people with proof of chronic hepatitis C who can't take interferon, or who have cases that don't respond to interferon. Proof may require a liver biopsy or PCR test in people with low antibody titres. For more information your doctor should call Dr. John Gate at ICN: (714) 545-0100.</p>

<title>PWA Health Group: roxithromycin</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#5c4033" vlink="#545454">
<img src="../gifs/pwa.gif">

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>ROXITHROMYCIN INFO SHEET</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What Is It, Really?</b><br>
Roxithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic. It is currently being sold by the PWA Health Group as a possible treatment for cryptosporidiosis, based on two small open-label studies. <a href="../../network/simple/crypto.html">Cryptosporidiosis</a>, a parasitic infection, often leads to severe diarrhea and weight loss and is potentially fatal. Unfortunately, there is no standard treatment for cryptosporidiosis. Roxithromycin is widely used in Latin America and Europe as a safe and effective treatment for a number of bacterial infections.</p>

<p><b>How's It Work</b><br>
Roxithromycin is very similar in composition, chemical structure (semi-synthetic) and mechanism of action to erythromycin, <a href="../../network/access/drugs/azit.html">azithromycin</a>, or <a href="../../network/access/drugs/clar.html">clarithromycin</a>. Antibiotics such as roxithromycin can often be prescribed for several different infections, including some STDs, upper and lower respiratory tract infections and asthma, gum infections like gingivitis, and bacterial infections associated with stomach and intestinal ulcers. Roxithromycin is absorbed well into the gastro-intestinal tract, with few side effects, and actively responds to the presence of <a href="../../network/simple/crypt.html">cryptosporidium</a>, <a href="../../network/simple/pcp.html">pneumocystis carinii (PCP)</a>, toxoplasma gondii, and <a href="../../network/simple/mac.html">Mycobacterium Avium (MAC)</a>.</p>

<p><b>Clinical Studies</b><br>
While there have been many trials that have reported the effectiveness of roxithromycin in treating various parasitic and bacterial infections, these have mostly been in non-HIV+ people. In HIV+ people, two trials have been completed to determine the effect of roxithromycin on cryptosporidiosis. However, both of these trials are small and uncontrolled. We hope that roxithromycin will be studied in HIV+ people, in a larger, controlled trial for cryptosporidiosis. Roxithromycin and cryptosporidiosis: At the 1994 International Conference on AIDS in Japan, results from a nine person study being treated for AIDS-related cryptosporidiosis were announced. Each of the PWAs received one 300 mg tablet, twice daily, for 4 weeks. After 2 weeks, complete clearance (no diarrhea, negative cryptosporidium stood cultures) were reported in 5 participants. A partial response (diarrhea improvement and decreased cryptosporidium culture) was reported in 3 participants, with no improvement reported in one participant. An earlier, even smaller trial of roxithromycin reported significant response in four participants. In this trial, four PWAs also took 300 mg of roxithromycin, twice daily, for two weeks. All participants were successfully treated for diarrhea, with improvements being reported in as little as two days upon starting treatment. Upon completion of the trial, 3 of the 4 participants were negative for cryptosporidium cultures. While the remaining participant showed initial diarrhea remission, it had recurred after the treatment ended.</p>

<p><b>What about other OIs?</b><br>
<b>Roxithromycin and MAC</b>: There has been one report of roxithromycin being effective in treating mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in the test tube. Roxithromycin showed antibacterial activity against all the MAC specimens (three specimens were from HIV+ persons, two were from HIV- persons). While the test tube data is certainly something to be optimistic about, it is critical that the manufacturer begin studies in humans to determine roxithromycin's effectiveness in treating disseminated MAC. <br>
<b>Roxithromycin and toxoplasmosis</b>: In 1989, a report announced the failure of roxithromycin in treating AIDS-related toxoplasmosis. Like cryptosporidiosis, toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection. Unlike cryptosporidiosis, toxoplasmosis usually affects the brain, sometimes leading to coma and seizures. In 1995, a study in 52 patients showed that 300 mg roxythromycin given once a week could prevent PCP and toxoplasmosis. 15% of the patients stopped the drug because of side effects like stomach ache, nausea, and raised transaminases.</p>

<p><b>Other Studies</b><br>
Roxithromycin has been studied and used for a number of different parasitic/bacterial infections in non HIV-infected people. Successful treatment of various infections has been reported, including: chlamydia, sinusitis, bacterial-associated respiratory disease, oral (odontogenic) infections, pneumonia, and skin infections(erysipelas). When studied as treatment for Lyme borreliosis (Lyme's disease) and tuburculosis, roxithromycin was not demonstrated to be an effective treatment.</p>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=right>
<blockquote>

<p><b>Cryptosporidiosis</b><br>
Cryptosporidium parvum is a single-cell parasite that produces chronic watery diarrhea in people with compromised immune systems. This infection can be fatal for HIV+ people with severely suppressed immune systems. Because diarrhea can be attributed to an number of different factors in PWAs, a diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis is confirmed by a fecal smear or intestinal biopsy. The disease is highly infectious; it is transmitted from person to person or animal to person. Recently, trace amounts of cryptosporidia have been found in New York City's water supply. One organism per 100 gallons of water has been isolated, which can be dangerous for people with severely suppressed immune systems. Treatments for cryptosporidiosis: The response to treatment of cryptosporidium infection has been abysmal among people with HIV. As previously indicated, there is no standard treatment for cryptosporidiosis. A number of different drugs are currently being investigated as a possible treatment for cryptosporidiosis. NTZ, azithromycin, paromomycin, letrazuril, IGX-CP (Hyperimmune Egg Yolks) and octreotide acetate are currently being studied as possible treatments for cryptosporidiosis. Studies to date on these treatments have shown only moderate results in treating cryptosporidiosis. A sixth compound, BACI(Bovine anti-Cryptosporidium Immunoglobulin), a drug designed specifically to combat cryptosporidium, failed to demonstrate any effectiveness in a phase I clinical trials. To learn more about <a href="../../network/trials/crypto.html">clinical trials</a> that may be open for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis, call the National Institutes of Health's clinical trials information line at 1-800-TRIALS-A.</p>

<p><b>Side Effects and Toxicity</b><br>
There have been very few reports of side effects when being treated with roxithromycin. While we do not have much data on its side effects in HIV+ people, we know that it is a treatment of choice in Latin America and Europe due to its higher safety profile over similar antibiotics. Possible side effects of roxithromycin include: nausea, vomiting, indigestion, cramps, etc. Elevation of liver enzymes have also been reported. The 1994 open label trial reported a moderate to severe rise in liver enzymes. Thus, it is crucial to have Liver Function Tests (LFTs) monitored carefully when taking roxithromycin. As with other antibiotics, roxithromycin is a broad spectrum antibiotic that may upset the natural balance of useful flora, the body's natural response to fungal infection. Antibiotics are known to predispose healthy women to vaginal candidiasis. Several studies of antibiotic treatments for a variety of opportunistic infections have reported that antibiotics aggravate vaginal and oral thrush.</p>

<p><b>Dosing</b><br>
According to the two studies in PWAs, the current recommended dose in 300 mg, twice a day. Like most antibiotics, roxithromycin should be taken for a minimum of five days to effectively treat the infection and to prevent resistance. Dosing schedules and duration should be discussed with your doctor. It is important that roxithromycin be taken at least fifteen minutes after meals. This will allow the drug to have maximum absorption in the body.

<p><b>What We Carry</b><br>
We import Rulid brand roxithromycin made by Albert-Roussel Pharma GmbH from Germany. It comes in boxes of 10 tablets of 300 mg each. Under the recommended dosing guidelines, one box will last 3-10 days.

<blockquote>


<p><b>What Is It Really?</b><br>
Saccharomyces boulardii (SB) is a live yeast packaged in capsules and sold over the counter in Europe to treat diarrhea. Studies suggest that SB protects the gut from amebas and cholera, may keep candida from spreading, alleviates diarrhea caused by c. difficile, Crohn's disease and diarrhea of unknown cause in PWAs, and traveller's diarrhea.</p>

<p><b>How's It Work?</b><br>
We don't know. Test tube results show it doesn't directly kill the bugs (bacteria, fungi, or parasites) causing infection. Theories of how it works include: 1) SB or something it produces may prevent gut inflammation that causes diarrhea, by interfering with how various bugs bind to gut cells; 2) SB might increase certain protective immune proteins that in turn kill the infection-causing bugs; and/or 3) SB might be a superior non-toxic competitor with amebas and candida in the intestine ("There ain't room in this gut for the both of us.").</p>

<p><b>Clinical Studies in PWAs</b><br>
There's only been one so far, as one in Seattle was cancelled. In a French study, 30 PWAs with chronic, severe (watery, 4-8 liters/day) diarrhea from no known cause, all with a history of CMV, MAI and KS, took 3 grams (3000 mg) of SB per day. Within two days, the volume of their diarrhea had been reduced to 1 liter. By the eighth day on SB, their stools were normally formed.</p>

<p><b>SB for C. Diff Diarrhea</b><br>
Taking antibiotics can cause diarrhea by killing off little organisms you need to maintain a healthy digestive system. Then other naturally occurring bacteria and yeast may rage out of control — without their natural predators to keep them in check. C. diff is one of the most difficult of these antibiotic-caused diarrheas to treat, mostly because it's so resistant to most other antibiotics. It's usually treated with vancomycin - a fairly toxic drug, that often fails, with recurrence of severe diarrhea.  Several studies of SB have been conducted in people with antibiotic diarrheas. In one, 13 people with recurrent C. diff tried a regimen of thirty days SB plus 10 days of vancomycin - 11 were cured with no recurrence of C. diff. A placebo controlled study of 180 people on various antibiotics reported that 22% of the people on placebo got diarrhea, but only 9.5% on SB did. A study of SB for infants with C. diff reported dramatic results as well.</p>

<P><b>Studies for Other Diarrheas</b><br>
The largest placebo controlled study of SB was in 3000 Austrians who took 250 or 1000mg while they travelled abroad. People on SB got significantly fewer cases of diarrhea than those on placebo, and there were less cases on high dose than low dose.  Another study evaluated SB in 20 patients with Crohn's disease, a life-long syndrome where people suffer from severe diarrhea, gut pain and weight loss. They were all treated with SB (250 mg 2x/day) for two weeks. All had fewer bowel movements. Half stayed on SB, while the others were put on placebo for another ten weeks. Those on SB had reductions in bowel movements while the group on placebo went back to the same number of bowel movements that they had had when the study began.</p>

<p><b>Side Effects and Toxicity</b><br>
Few side effects have been reported from the use of SB. People with yeast allergies should not take SB, and some people have complained of itchiness and facial swelling (sounds like...yeast allergy). Because this product is composed of live yeast, you must not drink alcohol for it to be effective. Alcohol will kill the yeast. It is important to drink a lot of other liquids when you have a case of diarrhea to avoid dehydration. SB is a different yeast than candida, which causes oral and vaginal thrush. SB does not increase thrush and in fact may lessen or prevent thrush infections. Some are concerned that since this is a living organism it may take root in an immune-compromised person and cause systemic infections. A number of people with AIDS have been on SB for more than a few years without any reported complications.  But there have been three reported cases of systemic SB fungal infections. In two cases, patients had perforated colons after surgery, which allowed the yeast to escape their GI tracts. Both responded quickly to a course of Ampho B. A very ill one year old girl treated with SB and 6 antibiotics for pneumonia, diarrhea, and fever developed an SB fungal infection. She was treated successfully with Fluconazole and improved overall with the use of aspirin. We must remember that she is an infant, and her system is substantially different than an adults. Normally, the yeast doesn't get absorbed; it moves right through the GI tract and is excreted in the stool in 3 to 5 days. Contact your doctor if you have any conditions that may cause a rupture in your GI tract (CMV, KS, MAC, ulcer) and you are taking SB.</p>

<p><b>Drug Interactions</b><br>
Good News: If you take SB with certain antibiotics, namely clindamycin and amoxicillin, the level of SB in your gut is substantially increased. These antibiotics kill off other organisms that may eliminate the yeast, so elevated levels of SB when taking these antibiotics are good. These drugs can cause C. diff, which SB may keep in check.  Bad News: Antifungals can kill SB, just like they kill candida and other fungal infections. Fortunately, fluconazole's effect on SB is minimal, and PWAs who want to try SB can continue to prophylax with a dose of 50-100 mg a day. Even so, for optimal effect, you should not take fluconazole and SB at the same time of the day.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Dosing</b><br>
The dose of SB differs depending upon the condition you are using it for, but ranges from 250 - 1000 mg a day. In PWAs with severe diarrhea of unknown cause, the starting dose is at least three times as much - 3000 mg a day. You may not need to continue at this dose - if it gets your diarrhea under control, you can gradually lower your dose till you find the lowest dose that works for you. In the Seattle study, if the SB works after two weeks, the people reduce their dose to 2000 mg a day. If it still works, after two more weeks, the dose is lowered another 1000 mg. This continues until each person finds his or her lowest effective maintenance dose.</p>

<p><b>On-going Studies</b><br>
At present, the one American trial for PWAs is closed, because of a company decision to focus on a phase III c. difficile trial, for which any immunocompromised patients are excluded. Most unhelpful and mean. For more information about the study, call Kris Moyer, RN, at (206) 322-5663.</p>

<p><b>Pharmaceutical vs. Health Food SB</b><br>
There are a few different European pharmaceutical products. In the US, Jarrow, a health food company, makes it. Jarrow's product is less expensive, but may come with lower concentrations of live yeast.  How good is the Jarrow yeast? We don't know. It may well be fine. Biocodex, the company with the US license, which clearly has a big financial reason to be biased, claims that they analyzed Jarrow's SB, and that: 1) it suffers from poor quality control; 2) the SB viability was not preserved by the packaging and manufacturing process, so there was a very decreased shelf-life; and, 3) there were nowhere near as many organisms per capsule as Jarrow claimed. Jarrow claims this isn't so, and that their analyses show their product's quality to be fine. Biocodex's results:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jarrow: 500 million yeast per 310 mg capsule
<li>Biocodex and Thiemann: 1 billion yeast per 250 mg capsule
</ul>

<p><b>What We Carry</b><br>
The Health Group currently carries Thiemann, a Biocodex brand of SB - but it is expensive. At 3000 mg/day, a four day supply costs $33. Jarrow's brand is available from Healing Alternatives (San Francisco, CA) and DAAIR (NYC).</p>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>SSKT (XIAO CHAI HU TANG) INFO SHEET</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What Is It, Really?</b><br>
Sho-saiko-to (SSKT) otherwise known as Minor Bupleurum Combination or Xiao Chai Hu Tang is an ancient herbal preparation used in Asia to treat what the chinese call lesser yang disorders, which includes fevers, the flu, bronchitis, lung infections, pulmonary TB, malaria, jaundice and hepatitis. Here in the 20th century, researchers have produced evidence supporting many of these traditional uses in test tube, animal studies and clinical trials in people — particularly for chronic hepatitis and liver cancer. Recent research also suggests that it may have anti-HIV effects. While traditional Chinese medicinal doctors may treat their patients with their own formulations, SSKT based on the ancient formula of seven medicinal plants is available as a pharmaceutical product in Asian countries.</p>

<p><b>How's It Work</b><br>
Probably because it is an blend of medicinal plants, SSKT has a wide range of activity in test tube and animal studies that can be broken down into three main categories: 1) anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory effects, 2) immune stimulating effects, 3) and anti-viral/tumor effects. As an anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory: SSKT acts as a free radical scavenger, preserving levels of glutathione in mice livers. It has been shown to protect the liver against a variety of toxins, including chemotherapeutic drugs. It also dramatically reduces oxidative stress in the brains of aging mice. It has also been shown to treat ulcers, diabetes and stomach irritation in rodents. As an immune-modulator: Again, in in vitro and animal studies SSKT has wide ranging effects on the immune system. It activates macrophages without boosting TNF-alpha; stimulates CTLs (the part of the immune sytem that kills infected or cancerous cells), NK cells and the production of antibodies; boosts G-CSF, and gamma-interferon (and maybe some harmful cytokines too). And it boosts T cells in rats. Anti-viral/anti-tumor effects: SSKT has been shown to have anti-viral effects against hepatitis B, HTLV and HIV. Extracts from one ingredient, scute seem responsible for most of this activity (although glycyrrhizin, another ingredient also has documented anti-viral effects). Meanwhile, even though some of the herbs in SSKT have anti-cancer effects, as a mix it exhibits much more potent inhibition of cancer cells. It stops cancer cells in mice livers, and colons from proliferating, and may even kill them.</p>

<p><b>SSKT in PWAs</b><br>
We don't know whether SSKT helps people with HIV. Both SSKT and some of its ingredients separately have shown activity against the virus in test tube studies. One study showed that doses ranging from 25-100 ug/ml stopped HIV's reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme in lymphocytes taken from asymptomatic people with HIV; these doses were somewhat less effective in blood drawn from people with symptoms, and had little or no effect against virus from PWAs. A more recent in vitro study shows that much lower doses than would normally work dramatically suppress the virus when given with AZT. But we don't know whether people with HIV can absorb enough SSKT to have an antiviral effect. Furthermore, the RT enzyme becomes resistant to most drugs aimed at it within months or weeks. We don't know anything about the development of resistance to SSKT. Studies of SSKT in people with HIV might answer some of these questions. A Japanese study published at the V International AIDS Conference reported CD4 and CD8 cell improvements in 7 out of 13 patients treated with SSKT over six months, but it didn't mention the doses they used. To our knowledge there have been no other studies, other than a rumored underground study in New York, and one just beginning in Australia.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Studies in People With Liver Disease</b><br>
There have been several studies of SSKT for hepatitis B, although none were well designed. One six month study in 80 people with chronic hep B reported decreases in viral load, antigen and 50% improvements in liver function. Another study in twenty six patients with chronic hep b reported even better results in eleven of the participants treated with SSKT. Seven out of fourteen children with chronic hep B cleared antigen within six months in yet another study of SSKT. The largest (260 people) and best designed trial of SSKT that we've been able to find evaluated whether the blend could delay or prevent the development of liver cancer in people with cirrhosis. Participants were treated with 7.5 grams a day of SSKT or standard therapy. After 34 months, 17 people on standard therapy developed lesions in their livers compared to just 9 on SSKT.</p>

<p><b>Other Studies</b><br>
Some of the ingredients of SSKT (bupleurum, and scute) in combination with a couple of other herbs including astragalus were compared to ritalin in 7 to 14 year old children with attention deficit disorders. The herbal blend was as effective as ritalin, without the toxicity. The children who did the best on the herbal combo got the highest boost in IQ points (10 points to be specific).</p>

<p><b>Side Effects and Toxicity</b><br>
Side effects from taking SSKT are very rare. However, there are a few documented cases of SSKT causing lung inflammation in elderly patients.</p>

<p><b>Drug Interactions</b><br>
There are no reports of interactions of SSKT with other drugs, other than studies that show that it reduced the level of liver toxic drugs within the liver. SSKT is often used in Asian countries to protect patients against the toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs.</p>

<p><b>Dosing</b><br>
No one knows the best dose of SSKT for people with HIV disease. The underground study purportedly used between 6-12 grams a day.</p>

<p><b>What We Carry</b><br>
The PWA Health Group imports Sun Ten brand Minor Bupleurum Combination from Taiwan. It is composed of bupleurum, scute, pinellia, fresh Ginger, ginseng, jujube, and glycyrrhizin, according to the ancient formula. It comes in bottles of 120 x 500 mg tablets, which can be dissolved (four at a time) in a cup of hot water and drunk as a tea, before or after meals.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h4>

<p>Thalidomide can cause serious side effects. It causes severe birth defects if taken during pregnancy. Since the drug is useful for treating ulcers in the mouth and throat, the FDA makes it available on an <a href="../../network/trials/aphthous.html">emergency basis</a> for those in need. Small studies suggest that thalidomide may also help weight loss in AIDS and TB. The FDA refuses to make it available for people with AIDS fighting severe weight loss. They are afraid that the more people who take the drug, the greater the chance that someone may give birth to a baby with serious birth defects.</p>

<p>The PWA Health Group and Healing Alternatives believe that people with AIDS under a doctor's care can take thalidomide safely, and that the real danger is keeping a possible life-saving treatment from people who need it. People with AIDS should not be denied a drug under a doctor's care because of a 30 year-old corporate scandal. However, due to the real possibility of serious side-effects, we ask that you read this booklet carefully BEFORE deciding to take thalidomide.</p>

<p><b>Birth Defects</b><br>
Taking thalidomide during pregnancy causes severe birth defects or death to the baby. The most common birth defect caused by thalidomide is when the hands of the newborn are attached to the shoulder, and the feet are attached to the hips, a condition known as <i><a href="#phoco">phocomelia</a></i>. If you get pregnant while you are taking thalidomide, stop taking the drug and let your doctor know immediately. We know how dangerous thalidomide is, because in the 50's the drug was falsely sold as safe for pregnancy. Most women who took thalidomide when pregnant had miscarriages or stillbirths, meaning that their babies were born dead.</p>

<p>How thalidomide causes birth defects has only been understood recently. It appears that the drug stops blood vessels from growing into the arms or legs. The most dangerous time to take thalidomide is between the 29th and the 40th day of pregnancy. Thalidomide can hurt a baby even if you take it only once during this period. This is the first month of pregnancy - when many women don't know for sure if they're pregnant yet.</p>

<p>Clearly, the plan is to not get pregnant in the first place. If there is any chance of your getting pregnant, use reliable birth control, such as the birth control pill, a diaphragm, <i><a href="#iud">IUD</a></i>, <i><a href="#nor">Norplant</a></i>, double up the condoms, the works - to make sure that pregnancy does not happen while you are taking thalidomide. MEN taking thalidomide should also use condoms every time they have sex with women for the same reason.</p>

<p>If you do have sex without birth control, forced or otherwise, stop taking the drug immediately, and talk with your doctor.</p>

<p><b>Can thalidomide cause birth defects after you've stopped taking it?</b><br>
No one knows. In fact, this has never been studied. Thalidomide breaks down into two chemicals in your blood. These chemicals cause the birth defects. They don't stay active in blood very long, so maybe thalidomide won't hurt future pregnancies. Talk about this with your doctor.</p>

<p><b>Thalidomide for People with AIDS</b><br>
Thalidomide is used all over the world (including the USA) for <i><a href="#enl">leprosy</a></i>. Its usefulness for mouth and throat sores (<a href="#aphthous"><i>aphthous</i></a> ulcers) has been reported for some time. Otherwise it has not been studied very much. This is now changing, because thalidomide may help:</p>
<ul>
<li>AIDS-related weight loss
<li>ulcers in other places, especially in the vagina or butt
<li>KS, and other vascular (blood vessel) tumors
<li>HIV infection
<li>diarrhea from <i><a href="#micro">microsporidiosis</a></i>
<li>diabetes-related blindness (<i><a href="#macular">macular degeneration</a></i>)
<li>TB and MAI
<li>rheumatoid arthritis
<li>how the body accepts transplants (HVD disease)
<li>multiple sclerosis
<li>other cancers
<li>other <i><a href="#auto">auto-immune</a></i> diseases
</ul>

<p>Thalidomide may turn out to be a surprisingly useful and even life-saving drug.

<blockquote>

<h4><a name="work">How</a> does it work?</h4>

<p>Although thalidomide has been known to help with <i><a href="#enl">leprosy</a></i>, for years no one understood why. Recent research has shown that thalidomide can lower a common <i><a href="#inflam"></a>inflammatory</i> chemical in the body. This chemical is called <i><a href="#tnf">TNF-alpha</a></i>. TNF-alpha is made by your body any time something causes inflammation inside you. You need some TNF-alpha, but high amounts have been shown to make many diseases worse (see above list) and can cause rapid, uncontrollable weight loss. Thalidomide is extremely important, because it can lower TNF-alpha, without wiping it out altogether.</p>

<p>For years, researchers paid little attention to the fact that many people with AIDS have a hard time keeping weight on. As with later stage cancer, it was seen as a natural part of the disease. Some doctors argued differently, and argued that being skinny made the disease worse. Many researchers now agree that many (but not all) <i><a href="#pwa">PWA</a></i>s have high levels of TNF-alpha, and that this can lead to severe weight loss. By lowering TNF-alpha safely, thalidomide offers great promise for AIDS and many diseases.</p>

<p>What follows next is a description of the latest research about thalidomide. Share it with your doctor. We also have a list of research references. If you want to skip this data part, that's okay - talk with us instead. But you must read: <a href="#side">Side Effects</a>, <a href="#dose">Dosing</a> and <a href="#order">How to Order Thalidomide</a> - in order to get thalidomide from us.</p>

<h4><a name="ulcer">Aphthous</a> Ulcers</h4>

<p>Aphthous (ap-thuss) ulcers are open sores that can happen on    <a href="#mucous"><i>mucous membranes</i></a>, in the mouth, throat, vagina and rectum. They are not caused by herpes or CMV. They can be large and very painful. Thalidomide has been used successfully to treat chronic aphthous ulcers for some time.</p>

<p><b>Aphthous ulcer data</b><br>
<b>Study #1</b>: In a small <i><a href="#controlled">controlled study</a></i> of 10 people with AIDS, 5 men took 100 mg of thalidomide a day, plus a steroid cream. Five other men used just the steroid. Results on steroid cream: 3 men didn't get better, and two men did, although slowly. The one who responded best had 350 T cells, many more than anyone else. The 3 PWAs who didn't get better switched to thalidomide. Results of taking thalidomide + steroid: 7 of the 8 men got better within 2 to 4 weeks. The 8th man stopped because of side effects. One also developed a rash after his ulcers went away. Five of the 7 who responded on thalidomide also gained 5 to 9 pounds.</p>

<p><b>Study #2</b>: Another <i><a href="#placebo">placebo</a></i>-controlled study of 73 people (HIV status unknown) were randomly given either thalidomide (100 mg/day) or a placebo. Results: 32 of 38 people on thalidomide got better. Six of 35 people on placebo got better. Almost half of the people on thalidomide had their sores completely heal, and the rest improved, with their sores getting significantly smaller and fewer. In many cases, the ulcers came back within 20 days after stopping the drug. 50 mg twice a week was the best dose to keep the ulcers from coming back (maintenance dose). Side effects: sleepiness and constipation.</p>

<p><b><i><a href="#case">Case studies</a></i></b>: A recent review of 25 case reports of people with AIDS suggests that thalidomide is useful, but can cause serious side effects. Doses ranged from 50 mg to 400 mg/day. In this review, 22 men and 3 women got rid of oral ulcers in two weeks. Half got rid of the ulcers permanently. Others got their ulcers back one to five months after stopping the drug. In several reports, PWAs were able to prevent the ulcers from returning with a dose of 50 mg twice a week, or 100 mg every five days. Side effects: sleepiness, <i><a href="#neur">neuropathy</a></i> (2 people), and <i><a href="#hyper">hypersensitivity</a></i>, all of which stopped with lower doses or stopping the drug.</p>

<p><b>Data on proctitis, rectal, and vaginal ulcers</b><br>
<b>Case study #1</b>: One PWA took 300 mg of thalidomide a day, and his ulcers cleared up in 3 days. After three weeks, he got a rash, and stopped taking thalidomide.</p>

<p><b>Case study #2</b>: A PWA took 300 mg/day, and his ulcers got better quickly. He stopped taking the drug because of stomach-aches and nausea. His ulcers came back, and thalidomide again worked very well for him (300 mg/day). He switched to 100 mg/day, but then stopped because of <i><a href="#periph">peripheral neuropathy</a></i>.</p>

<p><b>Vaginal ulcers</b>: Thalidomide has also been used to treat genital ulcers in people without AIDS, and should be useful for non-specific (not herpes or chrancroid) vaginal ulcers. Unfortunately, there are no plans to study thalidomide for vaginal ulcers.</p>

<p>Note: see following section for <a href="#apthous">other treatments for apthous ulcers</a>.

<h4>III - <a name="loss">Thalidomide</a> for HIV-Related Weight Loss</h4>

<p>Three small <i><a href="#placebo">placebo</a></i>-controlled studies suggest that thalidomide can help people with AIDS and tuberculosis gain weight, without adding to immune suppression. As mentioned above on page 4-5, it may do this by lowering levels of <i><a href="#tnf">TNF-alpha</a></i>, without wiping it out altogether. Also, case studies and reports from doctors treating PWAs with ulcers suggest it may reverse weight loss.</p>

<p>Weight loss in AIDS is not well understood, and can have many causes. There are many ways to fight weight loss, depending on the reason you're losing weight, or not gaining it back. Weight loss can be caused by: fighting an opportunistic infection, like pneumonia; an infection in your gut causing diarrhea; not eating enough; a sped up metabolism (so that even if you eat enough, your body burns it up too fast); depression; or poor absorption in your gut (so that what you eat doesn't get digested, and used by your body). There are different things to try. Work with a doctor and a nutritionist or dietician to find out what's going on in your body. Weight loss is not inevitable - get help, and fight it.</p>

<p><b>Data in people with AIDS</b><br>
<b>Study #1</b>: 30 PWAs with a six-month history of weight loss took 300 mg of thalidomide or <i><a href="#placebo">placebo</a></i>. Those taking thalidomide gained 4.5% in body weight after three weeks. (For example, if they weighed 100 pounds, they gained back 4-5 pounds in a few weeks.) The 15 PWAs on placebo gained back only 0.9% of their weight. Side effects: skin rash in a third of the PWAs on thalidomide.</p>

<p><b>Study #2</b>: 18 PWAs who had lost 10% or more of their weight, took 400 mg of thalidomide or a placebo daily. After 12 weeks, 8 out of 9 people taking thalidomide gained weight or stabilized, compared to 2 of the 9 PWAs on placebo, a statistically significant difference. Side effects: sleepiness and skin rash.</p>

<p><b>Study #3</b>: 30 people with tuberculosis (13 were HIV+) took 300 mg of thalidomide or placebo daily for two weeks. Taking thalidomide was significantly associated with weight gain. After that, a smaller group of participants took three more cycles of thalidomide and/or placebo, with a seven day <i><a href="#wash">washout period</a></i> between cycles. In all cases, taking thalidomide caused significant weight gain compared to placebo.</p>

<p><b>Case studies</b>: Only one case study of thalidomide to treat weight loss in PWAs has been published. Three PWAs with AIDS-related wasting took 100 mg of thalidomide a day, and each gained about ten pounds in three weeks. Also, weight gain in PWAs has been reported in other studies and case reports, as noted in the above section on aphthous ulcers.</p>

See following section for <a href="#weight">other treatments for weight loss</a>.

<h4><a name="dia">IV</a> - Treating diarrhea from <i><a href="#micro">microsporidiosis</a></i></h4>

<p>In a recent case study, twelve PWAs who each had diarrhea for over a year took 100 mg of thalidomide a day for three weeks. In all cases, their diarrhea got better, from an average of 6 movements to 2.8 a day. This improvement often happened within 3 days. All had been diagnosed only with microsporidiosis,and all had tried <a href="albe.html">albendazole</a> with no success. Side effects: One person developed a skin rash after 3 days, and stopped taking thalidomide. The diarrhea came back. Three others got too drowsy during the day. Two of them dropped to 50 mg per day, which still controlled the diarrhea. Another person's diarrhea came back after a week. The average weight loss before taking thalidomide was 18.5 lbs, and the average weight gain after 3 weeks was 2.6 pounds.</p>

<p>The authors note that they do not know why thalidomide would be such a good treatment for microsporidiosis. Not everyone with microsporidiosis in their stool gets diarrhea. <a href="#tnf"><i>TNF-alpha</i></a> has recently been found in the stools of some PWAs with microsporidiosis. Perhaps high TNF-alpha is part of why microsporidiosis sometimes causes such severe diarrhea. Clearly, more research is needed.</p>

<h4><a name="dose">V</a> - What's the best dose?</h4>

<p>We don't know yet. Clinical trials are underway now to figure this out. For both aphthous ulcers and weight loss, most doctors are prescribing either 100 mg or 200 mg per day, to avoid allergic reactions. Current AIDS trials for ulcers and weight loss offer 200 mg/day. They used to offer 300 or 400 mg/day. At those doses, many PWAs have allergic reactions, like bad skin rashes.</p>

<p><b>Maintenance therapy</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Oral ulcers: After their ulcers get better, many people take a lower dose of thalidomide, as a maintenance dose, to keep the ulcers from coming back. Not everyone gets their ulcers back, and unfortunately, it's impossible to predict if they will return. We do not know the best or safest dose for maintenance. Doctors are prescribing 100 mg every other day, 100 mg twice a week, 100 mg once every five days, 50 mg a day, or 50 mg every two days.

<li>Weight loss: We have no idea what's the best way to maintain weight gain with thalidomide. Should you stop taking it after a month? After 3 months? Maybe you should take it for two months, stop for a month, and then back on. We don't know. This is still very much an experimental drug. There is some indication that it might no longer work well after eight months. Work with your doctor, pay attention to your weight. As we learn more from clinical experience and trials, we'll let you know.

</ol>

<h4><a name="side">VI</a> - Side Effects</h4>

<p>Read this section carefully -- thalidomide can cause serious side effects in the nervous system, and can cause severe allergic reactions. You know your body best. Stop taking thalidomide if you feel like you're having a reaction, and speak to a doctor.</p>

</blockquote>
<p align=center><img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=2 width=400></p>
<blockquote>

<p><b><a name="side">POSSIBLE</a> SIDE EFFECTS</b></p>

<ul>
<li>sleepiness, drowsiness, even during the day
<li>constipation, sometimes very severe
<li>skin rash, sometimes severe
<li>headaches, stomach aches
<li>nerve pain, peripheral neuropathy (numbness and pain in your arms, hands, legs and feet)
<li>dizziness and nausea
<li>giddiness or nervousness at higher doses
<li>shivering and buzzing in the ears
<li>addiction after several months
<li>depression or mood-swings
<li>a general sense of illness, like a hangover
<li>SEVERE BIRTH DEFECTS if taken even once during pregnancy
</ul>

<p>Most studies report that the side effects are temporary and go away when people stop taking the drug. They happen more often in people who take high doses for a long period of time. A letter to Lancet describes <i><a href="#hyper">hypersensitivity</a></i> to thalidomide by two men with AIDS who took 200 mg/day to treat ulcers. One patient became hypersensitive and required colloid infusion and hydrocortisone. Allergic reactions resolved within 24 hours. Neither patient had their ulcers come back.</p>

<p><b>Peripheral neuropathy</b>: In the '50's, many people reported neurological effects, and some people developed permanent <i><a href="#neur">neuropathy</a></i>. One PWA took 100 mg of thalidomide daily for 18 months, and developed permanent peripheral neuropathy. There are other case reports of temporary neuropathy in PWAs. Most doctors report that neuropathy gets better when people stop taking the drug. The good news is that so far, no one in AIDS clinical trials has gotten neuropathy. Also, there have been no cases of neuropathy among people taking thalidomide for leprosy, even among people taking it for 20 years. If you feel any tingling or numbness in your feet and hands - stop taking the drug, and see your doctor.</p>

<p><B>SOMETHING ELSE TO WATCH OUT FOR: TB and MAC</b><br>
Thalidomide may be a good drug to treat TB symptoms. But active TB and MAC are usually diagnosed by those same symptoms (night sweats, fever, cough, weight loss). The drug might cover up that you are developing an active case, and you could suddenly break out into a very bad case. GET CHECKED for TB and MAC BEFORE you start taking thalidomide.</p>

</blockquote>
<p align=center><img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=2 width=400></p>
<blockquote>

<h4><a name="order">VII</a> - Before you order thalidomide</h4>

<p><b>Step A</b> - Make plans for birth control before taking thalidomide. If you are going to have sex while you take thalidomide, consider using another birth control method and a condom. For more information on options and where to get birth control in your area call the national Planned Parenthood at 1-800-230-PLAN, in San Francisco, call (415) 441-5454 or in New York, call 230-1111.</p>

<p><b>Step B</b> - Talk to your doctor if you have mouth or throat ulcers, or if you are losing weight. We can provide you with research and information about other treatments. For ulcers, consider the free <a href="../../network/trials/aphthous.html">FDA program</a>. For women it may be hard to have this discussion with medical professionals. Many people link the drug's use to its early history of birth defects. It will be important to explain that the drug can only cause such problems in women who are pregnant and that pregnancy can be avoided or delayed.</p>

<p><b>Step C</b> - Make plans as to where you can safely store this drug. This drug must not be mistakenly taken by anyone else. If you no longer want to take it, or have to go into the hospital - whatever- please call and we will arrange to pick it up. Keep it out of reach of children, in a safe, secure place.</p>

<p><b>Step D</b> - Additional counseling about birth control and side effects will be provided at the buyers' clubs. This is a chance to learn more about what to expect if you choose to take thalidomide and to discuss any worries about pregnancy or toxicities. Everyone will be counseled to use birth control, since it causes serious birth defects.</p>

<p>To order thalidomide from Healing Alternatives or the PWA Health Group:</p>

<p>Read this booklet and sign the front, indicating that you have talked over your decision to take thalidomide with a doctor, and that you promise to return any unused drug to us; Provide us with a doctor's prescription for a ten-day supply; Read and sign our standard release form, if you haven't ordered from us before. Take this drug at night before going to sleep (it's a <i><a href="#sed">sedative</a></i>!). Let us know of any side effects, or reactions. To get another ten day supply, you will need to provide another prescription. YOU MUST RETURN ANY UNUSED DRUG TO US. Call us if it's difficult to get it back to us, and we'll make arrangements to pick it up. Thank you for your carefulness. After four weeks, please call us to discuss your experience with taking thalidomide. A detailed report will be kept on file and updated every four weeks. If side-effects occur or you think you may be pregnant, call your doctor immediately and STOP taking the drug.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: This is one of the most conservative drug distribution programs we have ever set up. We have done this because of public and FDA concern that this drug will lead to someone having a baby with awful birth defects. Since the problem is well known, and easily prevented, we do not think this is the case, especially if these guidelines are followed. Thank for your patience and flexibility and responsibility. You are fabulous.</p>

<p><b><a name="women">A</a> SPECIAL NOTE TO WOMEN DECIDING TO TAKE THALIDOMIDE</b><br>
The history of thalidomide has been one of the most painful experiences ever for women, parents, doctors, children and many governments. As a result, thalidomide has probably the worst reputation of any drug known. So, doctors, nurses, family members, friends, and others may be uncomfortable if you decide to take thalidomide. Aphthous ulcers and weight loss in HIV are serious conditions that must be addressed. We at the PWA Health Group and Healing Alternatives believe that women have just as much right to survive AIDS as anyone else. We know that women are not pregnant every minute of their lives, and we believe that all people with HIV and AIDS have the undeniable right to decide upon their own treatment strategies. You should be aware that you may have to explain, advocate - and, at times, even defend - your right to use the drug. Reading about the history of thalidomide may help with this. For women who are having sex with men taking the drug, unfortunately nothing is known about the effect of thalidomide on sperm. No birth defects have been reported in children fathered by the thousands of men who took thalidomide in the 1950s and '60s. But they have hardly been looked for. Other drugs that men have taken have caused birth defects, so using condoms makes sense.</p>

<p><b><a name="apthous">Other</a> treatments for aphthous ulcers</b><br>
Current medications for aphthous ulcers include treatments put directly on the sores, such as tetracycline and <i><a href="#cortico">corticosteroids</a></i>; injections of steroids into the ulcers; or taking oral steroids, like prednisone (also a corticosteroid).</p>

<p>Many PWAs respond well to these options. Corticosteroids are powerful. Generally, they are avoided as much as possible in AIDS. Some research suggests that they may radically speed up HIV growth. This means that you might have less T-cells in a year than if you hadn't taken the drug. BUT these drugs are powerful anti-inflammatory medicines, and can save your life in some situations. In general, be careful, even with over-the-counter creams, like hydrocortisone. Also, corticosteroids do not help with the pain of ulcers. Lidocaine can be used. One benefit of thalidomide is that the pain usually goes away very quickly. <b>NOTE</b>: if your ulcers are caused by herpes, <i><a href="#predni">prednisone</a></i> can make the herpes much worse. Only a <i><a href="#biopsy">biopsy</a></i> can tell if it's herpes.</p>

<p>Although thalidomide seems to work well for aphthous ulcers, not all researchers feel it should be the first treatment choice. A small French study found that while it worked well for ulcers in PWAs, the drug should be used sparingly due to neurological side-effects. Dr. Mike Youle, one of the researchers, wrote in Lancet that: "in view of the possibility of peripheral neuropathy and the difficulty of obtaining thalidomide, we suggest that steroids may be a first line treatment and that thalidomide should be reserved for patients who do not respond."(Lancet, 335:1591,1990)</p>

<p><b><a name="weight">Other</a> treatments for weight loss</b><br>
There are many treatments for AIDS-related weight loss. The first step is trying to figure out why you are losing weight. Find a doctor and a nutritionist or dietician with a lot of experience with AIDS-related weight loss, and push them for answers. There are different causes of weight loss, and different choices to make accordingly. Some treatments work to help build muscles, such as nandrolone (decadurabolin), oxandrolone, and human growth hormone. One of these, rHGH (by Serono) has shown significant weight gain in PWAs. Other drugs lower <i><a href="#tnf">TNF-alpha</a></i>, such as ketotifen, which has also shown muscle gain in PWAs. PWAs have also benefitted from appetite boosters, like Marinol or Megace. There are treatments to help with diarrhea and poor absorption. Finally, there are new food supplements designed for PWAs, with special oils to help you gain weight, like Advera and Peptamen.</p>

<p>Like thalidomide, all of these have good points and possible side effects. Some may be safer for women than men, like Megace. Megace can also cause serious birth defects, and should be avoided if you're pregnant. And like most drugs, some treatments work better in some people than others.</p>

<title>PWA Health Group: thioctic acid</title>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>THIOCTIC ACID INFO SHEET</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What Is It, Really?</b><br>
Thioctic acid, also known as alpha-lipoic acid, is a natural anti-oxidant which has been used for years in Europe because of it's ability to help maintain or restore <a href="liver.html">liver</a> health. It's strong anti-oxidant capabilities have been used for radiation sickness and diabetes-related neuropathy. It has also been investigated as a possible inhibitor of HIV. The PWA Health Group sells pharmaceutical grade thioctic acid without requiring a prescription.</p>

<p><b>The Theory Behind Taking Thioctic Acid</b><br>
Thioctic acid has been used successfully for the maintenance of liver health and as a treatment for several toxin-related illnesses. It may be a promising treatment for similar complications in HIV+ people. Thioctic acid has been used extensively in Europe for years as a non-toxic nutrient to treat various chemical overdoses such as mushroom poisoning, radiation poisoning and alcoholic hepatitis. It has also been used to treat diabetic neuropathy and elevated liver enzymes. Elevated liver enzymes, which can indicate liver damage, can be a serious problem for people with HIV. For people who take oral medications such as antibiotics and/or anti-virals, balanced liver enzymes are essential for these drugs to get metabolized properly. Unfortunately, these same drugs can cause increased liver enzymes. Thioctic acid may help protect the liver so that you can take antibiotics without raising liver enzymes, or may be used to bring enzymes down so that you can start certain drugs. A second benefit of thioctic acid may be its ability to elevate the level of glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxidants in PWAs. As we have learned from trials of thioctic acid's fellow anti-oxidant NAC , naturally-occurring anti-oxidants (GSH, plasma ascorbate, plasma thiol, etc.) are often low in PWAs. This lack may cause oxidative stress, and cause inflammation and damage organs. It may also damage nerve cells, leading to peripheral neuropathy. Oxidative stress may also speed up the replication of HIV.</p>

<p><b>Thioctic Acid for Neuropathy</b><br>
While there have been several clinical trials of thioctic acid, most of them did not involve PWAs. However, these trials may help us understand what thioctic acid does, and how it may be of benefit to us. A1993 placebo-controlled trial concluded that thioctic acid was effective in reducing oxidative stress in people with diabetes. 80 people were randomized to either placebo or one of three antioxidants. These included: thioctic acid (600 mg), selenium (100mg), or vitamin E (1200 IE). Everyone on the antioxidants reported a reduction in oxidative stress, including reduced neuropathy and organ inflammation. There was no reported statistical difference between the antioxidants.</p>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=right>
<blockquote>

<p><b>Studies in PWAs</b><br>
There has been one clinical trial of thioctic acid in PWAs. In a German pilot study, 10 people took 300 mg/day of thioctic acid for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, glutathione was increased substantially in 7 PWAs, and CD4/CD8 cells were increased in 6 PWAs. There is currently a second trial open in Germany, attempting to enroll 30 PWAs to study the possible use of thioctic acid in treating PWAs with peripheral neuropathy.</p>

<p><b>Side Effects and Toxicity</b><br>
We know that side effects are minimal when taken at the doses used in clinical trials. Due to the limited number of studies with PWAs, we really don't know much about possible side effects. In studies involving HIV-negative volunteers, decreased blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) and nausea were reported by those taking higher doses of thioctic acid (900 mg). However, the data singling out thioctic acid as the cause of these effects are unsubstantiated. Like most antioxidants, thioctic acid is a chelating agent, and can purge minerals from your body. In one study of thioctic acid in HIV-negative volunteers, the amount of iron in their blood was shown to decrease significantly. This depletion can often lead to anemia. You and your doctor should monitor iron levels with regular blood tests.</p>

<p><b>Dosing</b><br>
We're not sure what's the best dose to take, or if different doses would be used for liver enzymes compared to neuropathy. We know from trials and anecdotal reports that people are taking anywhere from 200 mg/day to 600 mg/day. Only a large trial of thioctic acid that measures the efficacy and side effects with different dosages will clarify what's best.</p>

<p><b>What We Carry</b><br>
The PWA Health Group imports pharmaceutical grade thioctic acid (Thioctacid 300) made by ASTA Medica AG in Germany. While it can be found in some health food stores, the quality of health food-brand thioctic acid is not guaranteed. One bottle of Thioctacid contains sixty 300 mg tablets. According the doses recommended above, one bottle will last anywhere from 1-2 months.</p>

<title>PWA Health Group: thymosin alpha-1</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#5c4033" vlink="#545454">
<img src="../gifs/pwa.gif">

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>THYMOSIN ALPHA-1 INFO SHEET</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>NOTE</b>: Thymosin is taken as an injectable drug. (You need to use a needle.)
<ol>
<li>BEFORE taking thymosin, it is critical to have your doctor show you how to take this drug. If you are not comfortable giving yourself an injection, have your doctor help you out.
<li>You will need to get syringes (which requires a prescription in New York and several other states) and determine a way to safely dispose of your syringes.
<li>This product NEEDS TO BE REFRIGERATED. Do not leave it out more than a few hours.
<li>Thymosin comes as two doses in one small bottle. Once mixed with sterile water, the SECOND dose must be taken with TWO DAYS, or the drug will become too weak to be useful.
<li>Although thymosin is a singularly safe drug, injections can cause infections if the needle isn't sterile. Therefore we are asking all referring physicians to keep a list of adverse reactions for PWAs taking thymosin.
</ol>

<p><b>What Is It, Really?</b><br>
Thymosin is a synthetic version of a naturally occurring hormone that circulates inside your thymus. Thymosin alpha-1 is an injectable synthetic hormone that is being studied for hepatitis B, lung and neck cancer, and as an immune-modulator in AIDS. Results from a very small Italian trial suggest that thymosin in combination with an anti-retroviral and low dose alpha-interferon may result in increased T cells.</p>

<p><b>The Thymus</b><br>
The thymus is where T-cells mature and grow into functional CD4 cells or CD8 cells. How the four thymic hormones shape this process is not understood or agreed upon yet. Long overlooked by researchers, the thymus is in fact a critical part of your immune system: it's where individual T cells are tailored to respond to the millions of bacteria or fungi or viruses that could invade your body during your lifetime. Unfortunately, little is known about how the thymus works, or how it figures in HIV/AIDS.</p>

<p><b>The Theory behind Thymosin Alpha-1</b><br>
The mechanism of action for the use of thymic hormones with hepatitis B or HIV/AIDS is unknown. Interest in thymosin stems mostly from the results of a few small clinical trials and its strong safety profile. HIV/AIDS: The initial idea was to replace thymic hormones in PWAs to compensate for an increasingly atrophied thymus. Since then, taking thymosin has been reported to increase 1) IL- 2 and alpha interferon receptors on T cells, 2) thymic maturation of T cells and 3) production of IL-2, gamma interferon, and alpha interferon. It may increase the number and activity of NK (natural killer) cells. In the Italian study, 7 participants with 200-500 T cells took three drugs together: AZT, alpha-interferon (2 million units 2x/wk) and thymosin (1 mg 2x/wk). After a year, participants saw an average increase of 187 T cells, and improved T4/T8 ratios. Other participants who took AZT alone or AZT plusinterferon or AZT plus thymosin, did not experience similar T cell increases. Why AZT? The theory here is to take AZT (or another anti-retroviral) to lessen the chance that increasing T cells will result in increased HIV replication at the same time. How thymosin interacts with interferon is a mystery. One theory is that they synergize and work together to improve immune function. Others, noting similar viral load drops and T cell increases with high-dose alpha interferon and AZT, theorize that thymosin boosts interferon's antiviral activity. If that's true, it's good news given the side effects of alpha interferon. Hepatitis: The mechanism of action for treating hepatitis has yet to be spelled out. Small studies phase II studies abroad showed thymosin to be a much safer alternative to the standard treatment, alpha-interferon, with similar or better efficacy. A recent phase III trial (yet to be published) in people with chronic hepatitis B has reported disappointing results: an equal number of participants on drug and placebo cleared hepatitis DNA from their blood. Critics have suggested that the results are skewed from one site, and/or because chronic hep B was sloppily defined. It is interesting that twice as many people on placebo as expected cleared virus from their blood. Until we see the data or hear from other studies, we don't know much.</p>

<p><b>Side Effects and Toxicity</b><br>
Thymosin appears to be quite well tolerated. No adverse drug interactions have been observed. No side effects, other than irritation or a burning sensation at the site of injection, have been seen to date.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Dosing</b><br>
The dose used in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS is: 1 mg twice a week. Hepatitis B or C doses used in the clinical studies have been either 1 or 1.6 mg twice a week. Once mixed, thymosin is only stable for two days. Suggested dosing schedule: Monday-Thursday or Tuesday-Friday. Keep it refrigerated at all times.</p>

<p><b>Thymosin Preparation</b><br>
<b>Preparation</b>: Please ask your doctor for instructions and go over this process with him or her. Thymosin alpha-1 needs to be mixed before you can inject it. When you receive your order of thymosin, it should contain a small bottle with white powder (thymosin) and a glass vial of sterile water. Open the vial of sterile water and withdraw it via a needle. Gently pull off the aluminum cover to the thymosin bottle, and poke the needle through the rubber membrane in the top of the bottle. Inject the water into the bottle and swish it around to mix the thymosin and the water. If you are using your own sterile water, inject 1 ml of sterile water into the thymosin bottle.</p>

<p><b>Taking Thymosin</b><br>
When the thymosin is mixed, use an insulin needle and withdraw 1/2 ml of the fluid. Thymosin is a subcutaneous injection, namely, just below the skin. After injecting the thymosin, store it in the refrigerator. Use a clean needle each time you inject thymosin. Re-cap the needles carefully and dispose of carefully - get a red hazardous waste basket for your needles. Ask your doctor or get one from a home care company (who will also pickup on a regular basis). Home care companies always provide hazardous waste baskets and pick them up.</p>

<p><b>What We Carry</b><br>
The PWA Health Group imports Sclavo brand Thymosin-alpha-1 from Italy. Each unmixed bottle of thymosin contains 2 mg of drug.</p>

<p><b>On-Going Studies</b><br>
At present, we know of no open studies in the US. We will keep you informed.</p>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>TINIDAZOLE INFO SHEET</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What Is It?</b><br>
Tinidazole (or Fasigyn) is an anti-parasitic drug widely used throughout Europe and the Third World as treatment for a variety of amebic and parasitic infections. It is chemically similar to Flagyl — a drug with some unpleasant side effects that is used in the United States as first-line therapy for amebas. Tinidazole has similar side effects but you don't have take it as long.</p>

<p><b>What Does It Do?</b><br>
Tinidazole is approved in many countries. A large body of clinical data exists to support its use as a treatment for amebas, giardia and vaginal trichomona, just like Flagyl. So if you can't tolerate or just don't want to to take Flagyl, you might consider discussing tinidazole with your physician.</p>

<p><b>Side Effects and Toxicity</b><br>
The most common toxicities reported with tinidazole are stomach upset, bitter taste, and itchiness. Other toxicities which occur are headache, fatigue, and dizziness. But these studies weren't performed in people with AIDS. Anecdotally, people who have taken both Flagyl and tinidazole report toxicity is much the same except the side effects don't last as long. Note: drinking alcohol while taking tinidazole will make you violently ill.</p>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=right>
<blockquote>

<p><b>Dosing</b><br>
The dose of tinidazole varies depending on what you are using it for. <b>Note</b>: these are standard doses, and not from studies with PWAs. Doctors may prescribe longer doses for PWAs (eg., 3 days for giardia and 5 days for amebas). For <b>GIARDIA</b>: the dose of tinidazole is 2 grams (4 pills) for one day. For <b>Vaginal Trichomona</b>: according to the doctors we've consulted, the dose is the same as for giardia, but check with your doctor. For <b>AMEBAS</b>: the standard dose is 2 grams (4 pills) for three to five days. For a severe case of amebas, doctors prescribe 600 mg 2x/day for 6 days. <b>Note</b>: tinidazole and Flagyl can't kill ameba larva that hide in cysts, and if you don't kill these, your amebas will come right back. Follow tinidazole or Flagyl with either iodoquinol, 650 mg 3 times a day for twenty days, or paromomycin (Humatin) 500 mg 3 times a day for seven days. Both drugs are available at a regular pharmacy with a doctor's prescription.</p>

<p><b>The Brand We Carry</b><br>
Tinidazole is made by Pfizer Pharmaceuticals under the brand name Fasigyn. It comes in boxes of 8 x 500 mg tablets.</p>

<p><b>If Tinidazole's So Good, Why Isn't It Approved Here?</b><br>
Apparently, drug company, Pfizer, doesn't believe the market (and potential profit) is big enough to justify the expense of going through the approval process in the US.</p>

<p><b>How Can You Get Tinidazole?</b><br>
The PWA Health Group can help you import tinidazole from Mexico. To order it from us, you must have your doctor write a prescription.</p>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>One Liver To Love</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What does my liver have to do with this?</b><br>
Your liver is a very important organ, especially if you have HIV or AIDS. However, a lot of us don't hear about how important it is until something goes wrong with it. Very often, the doctor will tell you that there is something wrong with your liver by telling you that you have elevated liver enzymes.</p>

<p><b>What are liver enzymes?</b><br>
Everybody has liver enzymes. These enzymes help your liver get rid of the waste that is produced in your body. The more waste in your body, the more enzymes your liver needs to produce to get rid of it. Drugs, alcohol, and medications that you take to treat HIV and infections can make your liver work overtime. Diseases like hepatitis can also produce high liver enzymes.Simply put, high liver enzymes mean that your liver is really stressed out.</p>

<p><b>Why is this bad?</b><br>
First of all, if your liver is stressed out, it can make you feel sick. If you're taking a lot of pills and medications for HIV or AIDS, a stressed out liver can make the side effects of these drugs a lot worse. This can be very dangerous.</p>

<p>If your liver is stressed out, it may not be able to absorb the really important drugs you are taking to treat HIV or other diseases. It will also prevent you from absorbing important nutrients your body needs. Your may not be able to take important medications or join a clinical trial if your liver enzymes are elevated.</p>

<p><b>What will cause my liver to stress out?</b><br>
Not everyone who has HIV or AIDS has a stressed out liver. However, some people are more likely to have liver problems than others. Following is a list of things that can raise liver enzymes:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Hepatitis</b>. Hepatitis is an inflammation or infection of the liver. Hepatitis is usually caused by viruses. These viruses include hepatitis A, B, and C. CMV (cytomegalovirus) and Epstein-Barr virus can cause hepatitis. Hepatitis can also be caused by IV drug use and alcohol use.

<li><b>Alcohol and IV drug use</b>. These chemicals can cause hepatitis. They can also cause liver enzymes to elevate, putting a large amount of stress on your liver.

<li><b>Medications</b>. People with HIV or AIDS may have to take a lot of pills and shots. While these are intended to help you get better, they can also put a lot of stress on your liver. If your liver is really stressed, it won't allow your body to absorb these drugs properly.
</ul>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=right>
<blockquote>

<p><b>How do I know if my liver is stressed out?</b><br>
Your doctor can perform blood tests to measure the amount of liver enzymes being produced by your liver. These tests are the best way to check if your liver is stressed. However, there are certain physical symptoms that may give you and your doctor hints. Signs include: fever; stomach pains; and yellow coloration of the skin and eyes.</p>

<p><b>How Can I help my liver?</b><br>
While you may not be able to take out your liver and send it to Hawaii for a two-week vacation, there are a number of great things you can do to help you liver with stress. If you can lower your enzymes, you will have many more drugs to choose from to fight HIV disease, like protease inhibitors and anitbiotics:</p>

<ol>
<li>Watch your liver enzymes carefully. Keeping them low will make things a lot easier and healthier for you in the long run.

<li>Cut down on alcohol and drugs . The liver has a hard enough time as it is without these things making it worse.

<li>There are some drugs and nutrients that may help you lower your liver enzymes. Some of them are also good for hepatitis. Ask your doctor or call us at the PWA Health Group to learn more about these products:

<title>PWA Health Group: protease inhibitors</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#5c4033" vlink="#545454">
<img src="../gifs/pwa.gif">

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN JUST AZT: AN INTRODUCTION TO PROTEASE INHIBITORS</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What is a Protease Inhibitor?</b><br>
Protease (Pro-tee-ace) inhibitors are a new group of drugs. They fight HIV directly. Some are approved and some are still experimental. Believe it or not, there are about 20 different kinds of protease inhibitors. They have different strengths. Some are close to approval. Others are just getting studied.</p>

<p><b>How do you do the things you do?</b><br>
In order for HIV to cause damage, it needs to reproduce over and over. This takes many steps. The enzyme protease is one important step. HIV needs this enzyme so that it can make copies of itself. These drugs stop the protease enzyme.</p>

<p><b>Are these drugs like AZT?</b><br>
No. <a href="../../network/simple/zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="../../network/simple/dida.html">ddI</a>, <a href="../../network/simple/zalc.html">ddC</a>, <a href="../network/simple/stav.html">d4T</a> and <a href="../../network/simple/three.html">3TC</a> are a different family of drugs. They are called nucleoside analogues. They work against HIV by trying to stop a different enzyme - one called reverse transcriptase. AZT-like drugs work well in some people, but not in everyone.</p>

<p><b>Why not?</b><br>
First, these drugs are not specific. They may attack lots of white blood cells, even ones that don't have HIV in them. Second, these drugs can cause serious side effects. Third, they stop working in most people after 6-12 months.</p>

<p><b>What else?</b><br>
AZT-like drugs are not as strong against HIV as some of the protease drugs. Also, they only protect white blood cells that are not infected. They do not fight the HIV that is already in a cell. Protease inhibitors can enter infected cells and stop HIV from reproducing.</p>

<P>So far, protease inhibitors seem much safer than AZT and the other nucleoside analogues. They are so specific that they don't hurt your bone marrow, or other white blood cells, but there is no data on long-term safety.</p>

<p><b>Are there any problems with protease inhibitors?</b><br>
Yes. One of the big problems with protease inhibitors is the same 
problem I forgot to tell you about with nucleoside analogues. With all drugs that fight HIV, like AZT or 3TC or protease inhibitors, resistance can be a big problem. Resistance happens when HIV learns to keep growing in spite of a drug. When HIV is resistant to a drug, that drug can no longer fight HIV.</p>

<p>Resistance is a big problem with these drugs. For example, if your HIV learns to get around AZT, you can (if you want), switch to ddI. This is probably not true with protease inhibitors. Taking one protease drug might change the HIV in your body so that no other protease will work for you. This is called cross resistance. Unfortunately, it seems that all the protease inhibitors can cause cross resistance, although it might not happen on an individual basis.</p>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=right>
<blockquote>

<p><b>Can resistance be stopped?</b><br>
The HIV virus is very smart and can learn to resist a lot of drugs. However, we hope that <a href="../../network/simple/combo.html">combining drugs</a> (taking more than one anti-HIV drug at a time) will confuse HIV. When drugs are combined, HIV has a harder time learning to get around the drugs. And if a combination doesn't stop resistance, it might slow it down.</p>

<p>Some doctors feel that protease drugs should be taken with other anti-HIV drugs like AZT and 3TC to slow down resistance. We have no idea right now if this will work. Hopefully, trials studying this combination will let us know.</p>

<p><b>Are there any side effects from taking protease inhibitors?</b><br>
Like so many things that appear to help us fight HIV, there are side effects with protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>First, you will have to take a lot of these drugs for them to work. The body can't absorb protease very well. Taking a high amount of any drug can often mean trouble for your liver, kidneys, and stomach. The more drug you have to take, the harder your <a href="liver.html">liver</a> needs to work to break it down, causing problems.</p>

<p>Second, there are many drugs you will not be able to use depending on which protease inhibitor you decide to take. These include <a href="../../network/access/drugs/rifam.html">rifampin</a>, <a href="../../network/access/drugs/rifa.html">rifabutin</a>, Prozac, and Seldane. Side effects reported are headaches, short term diarrhea, upset stomach, and some rashes, more rarely kidney stones and blood pressure problems.</p>

<p><b>Okay, so which protease inhibitors should I keep my eyes on?</b><br>
There are three protease drugs that are approved. We still do not know if taking these drugs will keep you from getting sick in the long run.</p>

<p><b><a href="../../network/simple/saquin.html">Invirase (saquinavir)</a></b> is sold by Hoffman-LaRoche. This drug is the weakest, working only with other antivirals like AZT on a good day. But it causes weaker cross resistance than Norvir or Crixivan.</p>

<p><b><a href="../../network/simple/riton.html">Norvir (ritonavir)</a></b> is made by Abbott. It is absorbed more easily. It appears to be very strong and was approved in February by the FDA for people with 'Advanced HIV Disease. It will continue to be in trials with different combinations of nucleosides and protease inhibitors.</p>

<p><b><a href="../../network/simple/indi.html">Crixivan (indinavir)</a></b> is made by Merck. This is also a very strong drug. It was also approved in February by the FDA, has fewer side effects and may have longer lasting antiviral effect than ritonavir.</p>

<p>To learn more about open protease trials, call the <a href="../../network/index.html">AIDS Treatment Data Network</a>: 1-800-734-7104. You can also call the NIH AIDS/HIV trials hotline: 1-800-TRIALS-A, and of course, us.</p>

<img src="../gifs/pwa.gif">

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>PROTEASE UNINHIBITED</h3>

<p><b>FEB/96</b><br>
In April, there will be three protease inhibitors available for your shopping delight in drug stores. Meanwhile, some things to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not all protease drugs are created alike. How strong they are, the kinds of resistance they cause, side effects, how well they work in combination with other drugs, and what kinds of antibiotics, anti-virals, antihistamines and birth control you can use at the same time are different with each drug.
<p>
<li>Two of these drugs, Crixivan (Merck) and Ritonavir (Abbott) are the strongest anti-HIV drugs to date. One study showed that people taking Ritonavir with under 100 T cells had significantly less chance of getting sick or dying in the following six months. This is the first time that any anti-viral has been shown to do this. And preliminary data suggests that these drugs may lower HIV in the lymph as well as in the blood.</p>
<p>
<li>Taking protease drugs with other anti-virals, like AZT/3TC, ddI, d4T, etc, may make them stronger, and help the effect last much longer than just taking one protease alone. In small studies, adding AZT or AZT/ddC or AZT/3TC hit the virus much harder, for a longer period of time, in more people, and caused less AZT resistance. Just how long this effect lasts (1 year? 2 years?) - we have no idea.
<p>
<li>There is a lot of variation in how people respond to these drugs. In trials, some people have had fantastic T cell increases and viral load drops. Other people in the trials had very little response. We don't know why yet. Taking other anti-virals at the same time (see #3) increased how many people responded. Most of the big results reported in the media were in 40-60% of the people in the trials.
<p>
<li>Taking a protease drug requires a different kind of commitment from you than any previous anti-HIV drug. Be clear with yourself before starting that you can really commit to taking the drug as prescribed, each and every time. Why? Because anti-virals can only work if HIV is not resistant to them. Avoiding resistance for as long as possible is the key to getting the most out of the protease drugs. If you skip doses, even a few times, or take less than prescribed, your hiv may become resistant. In early protease trials, people who took lower doses developed many different kinds of HIV resistance, and now none of the protease drugs will work for them.
<p>
<li>Taking one can make you resistant to the others. Saquinavir can cause a partial resistance, but in some cases, full cross resistance. Taking either Crixivan or Ritonavir will make you resistant to all the other protease inhibitors. This is called cross resistance. It means you can probably only benefit from one of the powerful protease drugs. And, once your HIV gets resistant to whichever one you choose, no other protease drugs will work for you.
<p>
<li>SO it's worth taking your time to figure out your protease strategy. Check what drugs you can take with each of them, how often you have to take them, and what side effects you might expect. Consider getting a viral load test to measure what HIV is up to in your blood. Choose which drug(s) you want to try, if or what other anti-virals you want to take at the same time, and consider whether you can really commit to following your strategy 100%.
<p>
<li>How can you tell if your HIV is becoming resistant to a protease drug (or 3TC/AZT or ddI, etc)? By taking a viral load test. If your numbers are high, say 300,000, and you start a drug, your numbers should fall in a month. If they stay the same, or go up, then the drugs aren't working very well for you. It's more confusing if your viral load is low. Is the drug or your immune system or both, keeping your virus low? Talk to your doctor, and keep watching your viral load. In time we hope to have a better understanding of how to use the viral load test.
<p>
<li>Big unresolved questions: (some of them) What is the best drug combination to keep HIV and resistance low? No idea. What are the long term safety issues with the protease inhibitors? No idea. Lots of people agree that PWAs with high viral loads and symptoms, who have taken AZT and other drugs for years, might want to try protease. What about everyone else? What if your viral load is high, but you have no symptoms? Many argue that keeping HIV as low as possible is the key to survival. Others worry about getting strong resistance, before having any symptoms. What if viral load is very low - under 10,000? Taking combo anti-virals may keep it low, or maybe your immune system would do that anyway. Maybe a strong protease combo will kick you into some kind of remission, with no progression for years. Or maybe it will not change much, except to cause your HIV to become so resistant that you can't get any benefit from anti-virals if your T cells fall later. We have no idea.
</ol>

<p>Protease inhibitors seem to do great things in many people, but there are many unanswered questions about how best to use them. We have to push drug companies and doctors alike to collect the kind of information that will help us make the best decisions. Saquinavir is extremely expensive, and odds are that Crixivan and Ritonavir will be also. The companies promise useful, accessible patient assistance programs - don't hesitate to call them. Pressure local gov'ts for ADAP and Medicaid coverage. A drug is no help at all if no one can afford it.</p>

<font size=-1>

<p>GIL-TG-02. Drug: <b>cidofovir topical gel</b>. This trial will study a topical treatment for genital warts in HIV-infected women. Participants will be divided randomly into four groups. Each group will receive the treatment, but the dose and length of treatment will be different for each group. The gel will be applied for five consecutive days each week for one or two weeks. Study visits are on the first and last treatment days. The gel can be applied at home in between the study visits. After the first one or two week period of treatment, participants who are responding but whose warts have not completely resolved may be eligible to receive up to two additional courses of treatment. To participate in this trial you must be HIV+, 18 years or older, with external anogenital condyloma (warts) and a <b>T4 cell count of over 100</b>. You must have failed previous treatment with surgical excision, cryotherapy, electrocautery, laser treatment, podiflox, TCA or intralesional interferon. You may not have had previous treatment for anogenital warts within four weeks of study entry, active lesions, eg. genital herpes, or a history of untreated syphilis or Bowenoid papulosis. Total time on study is 1 to 2 weeks. Contact: Joanne Staats, RN, Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center, Bronx, NY, (718) 960-2039. <font size=-2>(added 6/26/96)</font></p>

<P>NYU-IM. Drug: <B><a href="../drugloss.html#imiquimod">imiquimod</a></B>. This trial will study a cream called imiquimod for the treatment of anal or genital warts. Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will have their warts treated with imiquimod. The other group will be treated with a placebo cream. Neither the doctor nor the participant will know which treatment is being given. Visits to the study site will be required weekly for the first two weeks, then every other week for the remaining 16 weeks. Photographs will be taken at each visit. To participate, you must have a T4 cell count of over 100 with a minimum of two perianal or genital warts.

<font size=2><P><a name="thal">Emergency Use IND</a>. Drug: <B>thalidomide</B>. This program provides thalidomide for treatment of apthous ulcers on an emergency use basis. The FDA, which sponsors this program, prefers that doctors fax requests with as much substantiation as possible. The fax number is (301) 443-9292. Currently the FDA is approving 10-20 thalidomide INDs for people with AIDS for the treatment of apthous ulcers each week. The FDA requests an oral biopsy to exclude viral or fungal infections. If you and your doctor have difficulty obtaining thalidomide, you should call the PWA Health Group at (212) 255-0520 which is keeping records of access problems. The FDA has also been approving some applications for use of thalidomide in treating anal ulcers and weight loss. Once the application is approved, the drug is provided free, one month at a time. Contact: Matthew Tarosky, FDA Antivirals Division, Bethesda, MD, (301) 443-9553.</P>

<a name="251"><P>ACTG 251</a>. Drug: <B>thalidomide</B>. This trial will study thalidomide for the treatment of mouth ulcers in people with HIV infection. Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will take thalidomide and the other will take placebo. After four weeks, if no improvement is seen, the group taking thalidomide will change to a higher dose and the group taking placebo will change to thalidomide. Because of the serious side effects of thalidomide, women must agree to use a chemical method of birth control such as the pill, plus a barrier method of birth control. Pregnancy tests will be repeated each week and for 4 weeks after the study ends. All men must agree to practice abstinence or use a condom. Treatment is for 8-12 weeks. Contact: sites in New York, Buffalo, Syracuse and Philadelphia. Call The Network at (800) 734-7104 or ACTIS at 1-800-TRIALS-A for referral. <b>Note</b>: an <a href="../news.html#thalid">interim analysis</a> of this trial shows that thalidomide is an effective treatment for aphthous ulcers.</P></font></blockquote>

<p><a name="nex">NeX</a>-AmB-Com. Drug: <b>Ambisome</b>. This program will provide AmBisome to people who cannot tolerate, or who have a high risk for toxicity from, standard amphotericin B treatment. AmBisome is a liposomal formulation of the antifungal drug amphotericin B. Liposomal means the drug is placed in tiny bubbles of fat, which it is hoped will prevent many of the side effects of standard amphotericin treatment. AmBisome is administered once a day. To participate in the program you must have invasive fungal infection and be unable to tolerate or be at high risk for toxicity from amphotericin B. You cannot have moderate to severe liver disease or be pregnant or breast feeding. Contact: BioPharm, AmBisome Coordinator, (800) 787-8268. <font size=-2>(added 3/22/06)</font></p>

<p>95-855NE. Drug: <b>methionine</b>. This trial will study supplementation with an amino-acid called methionine for the treatment of myelopathy. Myelopathy is a type of neurological disease. HIV may inhibit the ability to produce methionine, necessary for myelin formation. Myelin is a substance that protects the spinal cord. Some symptoms of myelopathy can be weakness of the limbs, partial paralysis or inability to control the legs, uncoordinated gait, increase in urinary frequency and, in men, inability to get erections. A dietary supplement of methionine may help with and possibly prevent the progression of neurological disease. The first 3 months participants will be divided into 2 groups.  The first group will receive methionine; the second group will receive a placebo.  Neither participants nor doctors will know who is receiving which medication.  After 3 months all participants will be able to take methionine for 5 months. To participate you must be HIV+, 18 years or older, with HIV-associated myelopathy, with or without neuropathy and dementia. You cannot be pregnant or nursing. You cannot have myelopathy due to any other cause except HIV infection, KS, lymphoma or other malignancies. Participation in any other investigational drug studies within last 30 days is not allowed. If you are taking tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants or clonidine, you must be on a stable
dose for at least 6 weeks. Total time on study is 8 months. Contact: Jessica Moise, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY, (212) 241-0784. <font size=-2><i>(added 10/14/96)</i></font></p>

<h4 align=center>Managed Care</h4>
<ul>
<li>Enrollment in any particular plan is specific to certain eligibilty categories (generally the AFDC and SSI), counties and zip codes within counties.
<li>There are currently about 350,000 Medicaid recipients enrolled in the 22 plans.  The scope of the services provided under contract is negotiated with each contractor.  Generally services include hospital, physician, prescribed drugs, lab and x-ray, EPSDT and therapies, home health care and durable medical equipment.  Other services may include family planning, hearing, vision, dental, transportation and nursing home.  Plans may also provide additional services under the contract not covered by regular Medicaid.
<li>Regular Medicaid policy requirements generally apply to services provided under prepaid Medicaid contracts.  While expanded services may be offered, services provided by a contractor may not be more restrictive than those provided under regular Medicaid.

<blockquote>
<p>If the demand for the priority 1 medications increases beyond the budget capacity to continue to furnish all the medications on the formulary, the program will begin to eliminate the medications in priority 3 and then priority 2, as necessary. The program will not abruptly cease purchasing priority 2 and 3 medications. The process will be gradual to allow individuals currently taking priority 2 and 3 medications an opportunity to look for other programs to provide these medications. Providing medications according to their priority will serve as the budgetary control to purchase all medications on the formulary.</p>

Participants will be assigned randomly (randomized) to one of two treatment plans (study arms):
<OL>
<LI>start ddI and HU at the same time and continue for 24 weeks; OR
<LI>start ddI alone for the first 12 weeks, then add HU for the next 12 weeks.
</OL>

<p>The randomization system will make sure that equal numbers of people with CD4 counts between 50-300 and 301-600 will be included in each study arm.  There will be 40 participants included in each study arm, for a total of 80 participants nationwide in this study.  The study will last 24 weeks for each participant.  Enrollment is planned to take at least 3 months.  The total study length should be 9-12 months.</P>

<P><B>Eligibility Criteria</B><BR>

To be in this study, a person must:</p>
<UL>
<LI>be 13 years or older
<LI>have documented HIV infection
<LI>have not taken ddI for more than 6 days total in the past
<LI>have a viral burden (bDNA) greater than 10,000
<LI>have a CD4+ cell count of 50-600 cells/mm3
<LI>have no history of or suspected intolerance to study drugs
<LI>have bone marrow levels and kidney functioning that would allow them to take HU
<LI>be able to take ddI
<LI>have not taken ddI, ddC, and/or 3TC for more than one week
<LI>be willing to stop taking AZT and/or d4T when they start the study
</UL>

<P><B>Study Medication</B><BR>
Participants will take one HU 500 mg capsule twice a day, and ddI.  The ddI  level will depend on the participant's weight:</p>
<UL>
<LI>60 kg or greater - - two ddI 100 mg tablets (200 mg) twice a day
<LI>less than 60 kg  - - one ddI 100 mg tablet and one ddI 25 mg tablet (125 mg) twice a day</UL>

<P><B>Study Procedures</B><BR>
Within 30 days before enrollment: medical history, blood testing (CBC, platelets, chemistries), and pregnancy testing.</p>

<p>At the start of the study: physical exam, medical history, blood testing (CBC, platelets, chemistries).</p>

<p>At follow-up visits, participants will have a physical exam, blood testing (CBC, platelets, chemistries) including HIV viral burden and CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts, blood draws for testing drug levels and future viral plasma cultures, and quality of life assessments.</p>

<p><B>Follow-up visit schedules</B><BR>
Participants who start ddI alone (starting HU later) will have follow up visits at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, and 24.</p>

<p>Participants who start ddI and HU together at the start of the study will be seen at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24.</P>

<P><B>Outcome Measures</B><BR>
This study will be looking at:</p>
<OL>
<LI>HIV viral load as tested by bDNA
<LI>CD4+ cell counts
<LI>Quality of life
<LI>Clinical safety
<LI>Blood levels of HU and ddI (for research only)
</OL>

<H3>Statement of purpose</H3>
The purpose of this organization is to provide a center for interaction and communication within the rapidly expanding Computer Science commuinty among Wesleyan students.  We strive to facilitate faculty student interaction, peer-to-peer eduaction, and actively encourage women to explore Computer Science.  Finally, we wish to reach out to the student body at large to arouse interest in the mysteries of computers and computer science.
<P>
<H3>What is this web site about?</H3>
Our goal is to make this site an online home for Wesleyan Computer Science students.  For next semester we hope to have some sort of student-to-student bulletin board or newsgroup in place for each Computer Science class being offered.
<BR>
We also hope to have pointers to information on the various programming languages used in the CS curriculum, including Scheme, ML, Prolog and C/C++
<P>
<H3>What's with the name????</H3>
If you can think of a better one, let us know!  Some of our members didn't 
like the nerdy connotations of GEECS, but now nobody likes Computopia either.  
At least GEECS was recursive.<P>

Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics,
<A href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/"> Wesleyan University</A>. <BR>
Combinatorics, Combinatorial Geometry, Algebraic Combinatorics

<P>
I received my Bachelor's in Mathematics from
<A href="http://www.harvard.edu/"> Harvard University</A>,
my Master's in Mathematics from the
<A href="http://www.uchicago.edu/"> University of Chicago</A>,
and my PhD in Mathematics from the
<A href="http://web.mit.edu/"> Massachussetts Institute of Technology</A>.
Before coming to Wesleyan, I was on the faculty of the 
<A href="http://www.vt.edu/"> Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University</A> and on the staff at the
<A href="http://www.ccr-p.ida.org/"> Center for Communications Research in Princeton.</A>
</P>


<HR SIZE=4>
<H3> RESEARCH INTERESTS </H3>
My main area of research is <B>combinatorial geometry</B>.  I study n-dimensional
objects called <B>polytopes</B> from many points of view.   Usually I am interested
in what can be said about the numbers of vertices, edges, and i-dimensional faces
of different classes of polytopes.  These numbers are surprisingly associated to
objects in topology, commutative algebra, and algebraic geometry.
<BR> <iMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/GIF/lilmenat.gif">
Soon, you will be able to find a list of my publications on my  <A HREF=http:/vita.html>vita</A>, and download postcript versions of
<A HREF=http:/preprints.html>selected preprints</A>.

Welcome! I am a graduate student in both the 
<A HREF= "../../">mathematics</A> and 
<A HREF = "http://www.cs.wesleyan.edu/">computer science</A> 
departments at <A HREF = "http://www.wesleyan.edu/">Wesleyan University</A>.  
My research interests include category theory in computer science, 
in particular the categorical semantics of logic programming, 
as well as the design of logic programming languages.

I am currently teaching 
<A HREF = "http://www.cs.wesleyan.edu/Math/courses/math118/">calculus</A> at 
<A HREF = "http://www.wesleyan.edu/">Wes</A> and statistics at Middlesex
Community College.

In my spare time I like to escape the declarative paradigm and hack away.
I love Quintus Prolog but sometimes I like to get my proverbial hands
dirty elsewhere.  Here are some other environments I use.

Version 2, June 1991
<P>
<PRE>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC2">Preamble</A></H2>
<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
<P>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
<P>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
<P>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</A></H2>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<P>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
<P>
<LI>
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
<P>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<P>
<LI>
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<P>
<LI>
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.
<P>
<LI>
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</OL>
<P>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<P>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
<P>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
<P>
<LI>
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<P>
<LI>
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,
<P>
<LI>
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</OL>
<P>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
<P>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<P>
<LI>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
<P>
<LI>
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
<P>
<LI>
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
<P>
<LI>
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<P>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
<P>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
<P>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<P>
<LI>
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<P>
<LI>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
<P>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
<P>
<LI>
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<P>
<H2>NO WARRANTY</H2>
<P>
<LI>
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<P>
<LI>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</OL>
<P>
<H2>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</H2>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC4">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</A></H2>
<P>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<P>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</VAR>

<P>
I came across this guide while reading "EFFector Online Volume 5 No. 15,
8/20/1993" (A Publication of the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
ISSN 1062-9424), that is available via <TT>comp.org.eff.news</TT> and
immediately decided to get my hands on it. After browsing through the
raw ASCII text file, I thought that such a useful thing, should have a more
beautiful "face" (and fewer "bugs").
<P>
As Shari points out, the EFF is still "fishing for a publisher." In other
words, it's far from being clear when this guide will be available as hard
copy, unless you want to print out the "buggy" ASCII file.
Thus, I started over to make the bulk a <EM>Texinfo</EM> document, loosely
modelled after
<VAR>Brendan Kehoe</VAR>'s <i>Zen and the Art of the Internet</I>,
originally written for Widener University's, Computer Science Department,
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
and later published as:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Kehoe, B.P.</B> (1992)
<i>Zen and the Art of the Internet: A Beginner's
Guide to the Internet.</I> 2nd Edition (July). Prentice Hall,
Englewood Cliffs, NJ. 112 pages.
The 1st Edition, (February, 2nd) is still available via anonymous ftp from
<B>ftp.cs.widener.edu</B> and many other Internet archives.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It was the first comprehensive book on the Internet available.
(Despite the "traditional" postings in
<TT>news.announce.newusers</TT> originated by ex-<B>Net.god</B>
<VAR>Gene Spafford</VAR> <TT>&lt;spaf@cs.purdue.edu&gt;</TT>
of Purdue University
and the <TT>news.answers</TT> archive maintained by <B>Net.demi-god</B>
<VAR>Jonathan I. Kamens</VAR> <TT>&lt;jik@security.ov.com&gt;</TT> of MIT).
<P>
Situation has changed dramatically, since. More and more books
get into the stores, and hopefully facilitate the life
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
of "newbies" on the Net. Just to mention some IMHO excellent examples:

<P>
See ya on the Net!
<P>
<B>p.s.:</B> Although this guide is almost complete, and I really, really,
honestly, don't have the time to go over it once again, feel free to report
"bugs", or any inconsistencies you find.
Drop me "more quotes," further additions, requests for moral support,
or "whatever-you-want"...
Just an e-mail away.
<P>
<B>p.p.s.:</B> I'd like to say a BIG "thank you" to <VAR>Shari Steele</VAR>, for
her immediate excitement on this project. <VAR>Adam Gaffin</VAR>, who generously
accepted my changes to his initial ASCII version.
<VAR>Howard Rheingold</VAR>, who let me include his article, now serving as
superb afterword of long-year first hand experience in cyberspace
(and yes, I mentioned your new book, Howard <CODE>;-)</CODE>).
And, last not least, thanks to <VAR>Bruce Sterling</VAR>, who also "gave away"
an article for free.
<P>
Again, <VAR>Bernd Raichle</VAR> <TT>&lt;raichle@informatik.uni-stuttgart.de&gt;</TT>

provided TeXpertize, when TeXpertize was badly needed (see file
<TT>`specials.texi'</TT> for your enlightenment).
BTW: Over the past 2 years, we've been doing some such projects, although
we haven't met F2F, yet. This is one of the effects of the Net.
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
(It thus should be termed "Net.effect".)

Additional thanks to <VAR>Brendan Kehoe</VAR> <TT>&lt;brendan@zen.org&gt;</TT> 
for the <EM>Texinfo</EM>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
release of <i>Zen</I>, from which I borrowed this and that.
FYI: Brendan works on the 3rd editition of his book, and might
be able to release the 2nd to the Net, depending on Prentice-Hall's
legal attorneys. So keep your fingers crossed.

Some more nights have passed, and "GNU Info" format is fully supported,
now. You can use either Emacs in INFO mode, or just GNU's <CODE>info</CODE>
browser (also available as <CODE>xinfo</CODE> for the X window system):
type <SAMP>`info -f bdgtti-2.2.info'</SAMP> and read "Dummy's" online in
hypertextual fashion.
<P>
But since edition 1.01, "Dummy's" not only features an "Info" version.
It also comes with HTML support, i.e. the HyperText Markup Language format,
that is used by the <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">World-Wide Web project</A>
(see section <A HREF="bdg_181.html#SEC184">Gophers</A> for some more ideas on this).
The <CODE>bdgtti-2.2*.html</CODE> files can thus be browsed using the
WWW tools: from within <CODE>xmosaic</CODE>,
e.g. load <SAMP>`bdgtti-2.2_toc.html'</SAMP>, and there you go!
<P>
Finally, some more folks have helped along the way.
<P>
Many thanks to <VAR>Lionel Cons</VAR>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>

Welcome to the Christmas issue of one of the <EM>most read</EM> books on
the Internet! This time, we only fix the bugs that have been reported
from most the folks listed below.
<P>
From this edition on, the standard A4, and US letter size versions are
merged into one directory. Moreoever, has the EFF a new online activist,
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
named <VAR>Stanton McCandlish</VAR> <TT>&lt;mech@eff.org&gt;</TT>
who really seems to take care about this project, and has properly set up
the EFF's FTP site. So, the "EFF is out of pace" messages from former
postings entitled <i>FAQ: Big Dummy's Guide, Life and Everything...</I>,
(that also serves as the README file to the Texinfo release), have become
obsolete.
<P>
A major rework of this guide, including an extensive overhaul of the
World-Wide Web chapter, and the HTML version is planned
and scheduled for "mid-of-next-year-or-so".
I thus recommend not to hold your breath. You shouldn't expect Texinfo
edition 1.04 to come out prior to July '94.
<P>
Thanks to all of you, who sent bug fixes, made suggestions, or just
dropped a <i>Thanks for all the Fish!</I> message.
<P>

Never say never, folks. Adam Gaffin, released version 1.4 of his ASCII
version on December 20th, and I just couldn't resist to get the Texinfo
edition back into the game, and move it from 1.03 to 1.4.
So here it is. Anyway, the statement from above still holds true, it just
needs a little bit of "adjustment."

<EM>Welcome to the Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet, version 2.2.</EM>
<P>
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is proud to have sponsored
the production of the <EM>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet</EM>.  EFF is a
nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., dedicated to ensuring
that everyone has access to the newly emerging communications technologies
vital to active participation in the events of our world.  As more and more
information is available online, new doors open up for those who have
access to that information.  Unfortunately, unless access is broadly
encouraged, individuals can be disenfranchised and doors can close, as
well. The Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet was written to help open some
doors to the vast amounts of information available on the world's largest
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
network, the Internet.
<P>
The spark for the <EM>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet</EM> was ignited in
a few informal conversations that included myself and <VAR>Steve Cisler</VAR> of Apple
Computer, Inc., in June of 1991.  With the support of Apple Computer, EFF
engaged <VAR>Adam Gaffin</VAR> to write the book and actually took on the project in
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
September of 1991.
<P>
The idea was to write a guide to the Internet for people who had
little or no experience with network communications.  We intended to post
this guide to the Net in ASCII and HyperCard formats and to give it away on
disk, as well as have a print edition available.  We have more than
realized our goal.  Individuals from as geographically far away as Germany,
Italy, Canada, South Africa, Japan, Scotland, Norway, and Antarctica have
all sent electronic mail to say that they downloaded the Big Dummy's Guide
to the Internet.  The guide is now available in a wide array of formats,
including ACSCII text, HyperCard, World Wide Web, PostScript and
AmigaGuide.  And the guide will be published in a printed format by MIT
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
Press in June of 1994.
<P>
EFF would like to thank author Adam Gaffin for doing a terrific job
of explaining the Net in such a nonthreatening way.  We'd also like to
thank the folks at Apple, especially Steve Cisler of the Apple Library, for
their support of our efforts to bring this guide to you.
<P>
We invite you to join with EFF in our fight to ensure that equal
access to the networks and free speech are protected in newly emerging
technologies.  We are a membership organization, and through donations like
yours, we can continue to sponsor important projects to make communications
easier.  Information about the Electronic Frontier Foundation and some of
the work that we do can be found at the end of this book.
<P>
We hope that the <EM>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet</EM> helps you learn
about whole new worlds, where new friends and experiences are sure to be
yours.  Enjoy!

<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
Co-founder, Electronic Frontier Foundation.
<P>
New communities are being built today.  You cannot see them, except
on a computer screen.  You cannot visit them, except through your
keyboard.  Their highways are wires and optical fibers; their language a
series of ones and zeroes.
<P>
Yet these communities of cyberspace are as real and vibrant as any
you could find on a globe or in an atlas.  Those are real people on the
other sides of those monitors.  And freed from physical limitations,
these people are developing new types of cohesive and effective
communities - ones which are defined more by common interest and purpose
than by an accident of geography, ones on which what really counts is
what you say and think and feel, not how you look or talk or how old
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
you are.
<P>
The oldest of these communities is that of the scientists, which
actually predates computers.  Scientists have long seen themselves
as an international community, where ideas were more important than
national origin.  It is not surprising that the scientists were the
first to adopt the new electronic media as their principal means of
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
day-to-day communication.
<P>
I look forward to a day in which everybody, not just scientists,
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
can enjoy similar benefits of a global community.
<P>
But how exactly does community grow out of a computer network? It
does so because the network enables new forms of communication.
<P>
The most obvious example of these new digital communications media
is electronic mail, but there are many others.  We should begin to think
of mailing lists, newsgroups, file and document archives, etc. as just
the first generation of new forms of information and communications
media.  The digital media of computer networks, by virtue of their
design and the enabling technology upon which they ride, are
fundamentally different from the now dominant mass media of television, 
radio, newspapers and magazines.  Digital communications media are
inherently capable of being more interactive, more participatory, more
egalitarian, more decentralized, and less hierarchical.
<P>
As such, the types of social relations and communities which can be
built on these media share these characteristics.  Computer networks
encourage the active participation of individuals rather than the
passive non-participation induced by television narcosis.
<P>
In mass media, the vast majority of participants are passive
recipients of information.  In digital communications media, the vast
majority of participants are active creators of information as well as
recipients.  This type of symmetry has previously only been found in
media like the telephone.  But while the telephone is almost entirely a
medium for private one-to-one communication, computer network
applications such as electronic mailing lists, conferences, and bulletin
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
boards, serve as a medium of group or "many-to-many" communication.
<P>
The new forums atop computer networks are the great levelers and
reducers of organizational hierarchy.  Each user has, at least in
theory, access to every other user, and an equal chance to be heard.
Some U.S. high-tech companies, such as Microsoft and Borland, already
use this to good advantage: their CEO's -- <VAR>Bill Gates</VAR> and
<VAR>Philippe Kahn</VAR>
-- are directly accessible to all employees via electronic mail.  This
creates a sense that the voice of the individual employee really
matters.  More generally, when corporate communication is facilitated by
electronic mail, decision-making processes can be far more inclusive and
<A NAME="IDX33"></A>
<A NAME="IDX34"></A>
<A NAME="IDX35"></A>
<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
participatory.
<P>
Computer networks do not require tightly centralized administrative
control.  In fact, decentralization is necessary to enable rapid growth
of the network itself.  Tight controls strangle growth.  This
decentralization promotes inclusiveness, for it lowers barriers to entry
for new parties wishing to join the network.
<P>
Given these characteristics, networks hold tremendous potential to
enrich our collective cultural, political, and social lives and enhance
democratic values everywhere.
<P>
And the Internet, and the UUCP and related networks connected to
it, represents an outstanding example of a computer network with these
qualities.  It is an open network of networks, not a single unitary
network, but an ensemble of interconnected systems which operate on the 
basis of multiple implementations of accepted, non-proprietary
protocols, standards and interfaces.
<P>
One of its important characteristics is that new networks, host
systems, and users may readily join the network -- the network is open
to all.
<P>
The openness (in all senses) of the Internet reflects, I believe,
the sensibilities and values of its architects.  Had the Internet
somehow been developed outside the world of research and education, it's
less likely to have had such an open architecture.  Future generations
will be indebted to this community for the wisdom of building these
types of open systems.
<P>
Still, the fundamental qualities of the Net, such as its
decentralization, also pose problems.  How can full connectivity be 
maintained in the face of an ever-expanding number of connected
networks, for example?  What of software bugs that bring down computers,
or human crackers who try to do the same?  But these problems can and
<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
will be solved.
<P>
Digital media can be the basis of new forms of political discourse,
in which citizens form and express their views on the important public
issues of the day. There is more than one possible vision of such
electronic democracy, however. Let's look at some examples of the
potential power, and problems, of the new digital media.
<P>
The idea of something called an "electronic town meeting"  received
considerable attention in 1992 with <VAR>Ross Perot</VAR>'s presidential campaign
<A NAME="IDX40"></A>
(or, at least, its first incarnation).
<P>
Perot's original vision, from 20 or so years ago,  was that viewers
would watch a debate on television and fill out punch cards which would
be mailed in and collated.  Now we could do it with 800 telephone
numbers.
<P>
In the current atmosphere of disaffection, alienation and cynicism,
anything that promotes greater citizen involvement seems a good idea.
People are turned off by politicians in general -- witness the original
surge of support for Perot as outsider who would go in and clean up the
mess -- and the idea of going right to the people is appealing,
<P>
What's wrong with this picture? The individual viewer is a passive
recipient of the views of experts.  The only action taken by the citizen
is in expressing a preference for one of three pre-constructed
alternatives.  While this might be occasionally useful, it's
unsophisticated and falls far short of the real potential of electronic
democracy. We've been reduced to forming our judgments on the basis of
mass media's portrayal of the personality and character of the
candidates.
<P>
All this is in contrast to robust political debates already found
on various on-line computer systems, from CompuServe to Usenet.
Through these new media, the issues of the day, ranging from national
security in the post-Cold War era to comparative national health care
systems, are fiercely discussed in a wide variety of bulletin boards,
conferences, and newsgroups.
<P>
What I see in online debate are multiple active participants, not
just experts, representing every point of view, in discussions that
unfold over extended periods of time. What this shows is that, far from
being alienated and disaffected from the political process, people like
to talk and discuss -- and take action -- if they have the opportunity
to do so.  Mass media don't permit that.  But these new media are more
akin to a gathering around the cracker barrel at the general store --
only extended over hundreds, thousands of miles, in cyberspace, rather
than in one physical location.
<P>
Recent years have shown the potential power of these new media.
We have also seen several examples of where talk translated into 
action.
<P>
In 1987, the Federal Communications Commission proposed changing
the way certain online providers paid for access to local phone service.
Online, this quickly became known as the "modem tax" and generated a
storm of protest.  The FCC withdrew the idea, but not quickly enough:
the "modem tax" has penetrated so deeply into the crevices of the Net
that it has taken up a permanent and ghostly residence as a kind of
virtual or cognitive virus, which periodically causes a re-infection of
the systems and its users.  FCC commissioners continue to receive
substantial mail on this even though the original issue is long dead; in
fact, it has generated more mail than any other issue in the history of
<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
<A NAME="IDX43"></A>
the FCC.
<P>
More recently, <VAR>Jim Manzi</VAR>, chairman of Lotus Development Corp.,
received more than 30,000 e-mail messages when the company was getting
ready to sell a database containing records on tens of millions of
Americans.  The flood of electronic complaints about the threat to
privacy helped force the company to abandon the project.
Issues of narrow but vital interest to the online community give a hint
<A NAME="IDX44"></A>
<A NAME="IDX45"></A>
of the organizing power of the Net.
<P>
In August, 1991, the managers of a Soviet computer network known as
Relcom stayed online during an abortive coup, relaying eyewitness
accounts and news of actions against the coup to the West and to the
<A NAME="IDX46"></A>
<A NAME="IDX47"></A>
rest of Russia.
<P>
And many public interest non-profit organizations and special
interest groups already use bulletin boards heavily as a means of
communicating among their members and organizing political activity.
<P>
But all is not perfect online.  The quality of discourse is often
very low.  Discussion is often trivial and boring and bereft of
persuasive reason.  Discourse often sinks to the level of "flaming," of
personal attacks, instead of substantive discussion.  Flaming. Those
with the most time to spend often wind up dominating the debate -- a
triumph of quantity of time available over quality of content.
<P>
It seems like no place for serious discussion. Information overload
is also a problem.  There is simply far too much to read to keep up
with.  It is all without organization.  How can this be addressed?
<P>
Recent innovations in the design of software used to connect
people to the Net and the process of online discussion itself reveal
some hope.
<P>
Flaming is universal, but different systems handle it in different
<A NAME="IDX48"></A>
ways.  Both the technology and cultural norms matter.
<P>
On Usenet, for instance, most news reader applications support a
feature known as a "killfile," which allows an individual to screen
out postings by a particular user or on a particular subject.  It is
also sometimes referred to as "the bozo filter."  This spares the user
who is sufficiently sophisticated from further flamage, but it does
nothing to stop the problem at its source.
<P>
Censorship would be one solution. But what else can be done without
resorting to unacceptably heavy-handed tactics of censorship?  There is a
great tradition of respect for free speech on these systems, and to
censor public postings or even ban a poster for annoying or offensive
content is properly seen as unacceptable, in my opinion.
<P>
Some systems use cultural norms, rather than software, to deal with
flame wars.  These online communities have developed practices which
rely more on a shared, internalized sense of appropriate behavior  than
<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
on censorship, for instance.  The WELL (Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link) is a
relatively small online conferencing system based in the San Francisco
Bay area.  On the WELL, individuals who get into a fight are encouraged
to move the discussion out of the public conference and into e-mail.
The encouragement is provided not only by the host of the conference,
but also by the users.  It is part of the culture, not part of the
technology.
<P>
WELL hosts are volunteers who facilitate the discussion of a
particular subject.  While they have the power to censor individual
postings, the power is very rarely used and only as a last resort, as it
has been found that dispute resolution by talking it out among the
parties is a superior method of problem solving in the long run.
<P>
It is not an accident that the WELL has a uniquely high quality
of conversation.  Nor is it coincidental that it developed as a small
and originally isolated community (now on the Net) which gave it a
chance to develop its own norms or that key management of the system
came from "The Farm," a large, successful commune of the 1960's and
<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
1970's led by <VAR>Stephen Gaskin</VAR>.
<P>
We still know very little about the facilitation of online
conversations.  It is a subject well worth further formal study and
experimentation.
<P>
Some problems have to do with the unrefined and immature format and
structure of the discussion medium itself.  The undifferentiated stream
of new messages marching along in 80 columns of ASCII text creates a
kind of hypnotic trance.  Compare this with the typical multiplicity of
type fonts, varied layouts, images, and pictures of the printed page.
<P>
New media take time to develop and to be shaped.  Reading text on a
terminal reminds me of looking at the Gutenberg Bible. The modern book
took a century to develop after the invention of printing with movable
type and the first Western printed books.  <VAR>Aldus Manutius</VAR> and the
inventions of modern typefaces, pagination, the table of contents, the
index, all of which gave the book its modern form, came later, were done
by different people, and were of a different order than the invention of
printing with movable type itself.  The new electronic media are
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
undergoing a similar evolution.
<P>
Key inventions are occurring slowly, for example, development of
software tools that will allow the dissemination of audio and video
across the Net. This type of software has usually been done so far by
volunteers who have given away the results.  It's a great thing, but
it's not sufficient, given how hard it is to develop robust software.
Innovation in the application space will also be driven by entrepreneurs
and independent software vendors at such point as they perceive a
business opportunity to create such products (it would be nice if
creators did it for art's sake but this seems unlikely).
<P>
There are some requirements to provide incentives to attract
additional software development.  This requires a competitive free
market in network services at all levels to serve the expanding user
demand for network services. It requires a technologically mature
network able to support these services.
<P>
And there must be a user population, current or prospective,
interested in paying for better applications -- and not just the current
base of technically sophisticated users and students, though they will
absolutely benefit.
<P>
There are multiple classes of new application opportunities.  E-mail
is overloaded because there aren't readily available alternatives yet.
New and different kinds of tools are needed for collaborative work.
Computer conferencing, as it evolves, may be sufficient for discussion
and debate.  But by itself, it cannot really support collaborative work,
in the sense of readily enabling a group to make decisions efficiently,
represent and track the status of its work process.  Trying to run an
organization via e-mail mailing list is very different than trying to 
have a discussion.
<P>
Computer networks can only fully realize their potential as
innovative communications media in an environment which encourages free
and open expression.
<P>
In some countries, legal principles of free speech protect freedom
of expression in traditional media such as the printed word.  But once
communication moves to new digital media and crosses
international borders, such legal protections fall away.  As <VAR>John Perry
Barlow</VAR>, the co-founder of EFF puts it: "In Cyberspace, the First
Amendment is a local ordinance."  There is no international legal
authority which protects free expression on trans-national networks.
Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights calls for the
protection of free expression in all media, but the declaration falls
<A NAME="IDX54"></A>
<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<A NAME="IDX56"></A>
far short of being binding.
<P>
And if we're to take seriously the idea of the electronic online
forum, we have to deal with the access issue.  If the only people with
access to the medium are well-educated, affluent, techno-literate elite,
it won't be sufficiently inclusive to represent all points of view.
<P>
We also need, fundamentally, a better infrastructure (the highway
system for information).  As we move from the high-speed Internet to the
even more powerful National Research and Education Network, we need to
look at how to bring the power of these new media into the homes of
everybody who might want it.  Addressing this "last mile" problem (phone
networks are now largely digitized, fiber-optic systems, except for the
mile between your home and the nearest switching station) should be a
priority.
<P>
Computer networks will eventually become ubiquitous around the
world.  We should therefore be concerned with the impact on society that
they have, the opportunities to improve society, and the dangers that
they pose.   Fundamentally, we are optimists who believe in the
potential of networks to enhance democratic values of openness,
diversity, and innovation.
<P>
Because the medium is so new, it is important now to develop
policies at the national and international level that help achieve the
potential of computer networks for society as a whole. By the time
television was recognized as a vast wasteland it was already too late to
change. There is a rare opportunity to develop policies in advance of a
technologically and economically mature system which would be hard to
change.
<P>

of interconnected meshes, and each mesh has its place and
responsibility in relation to other meshes."</EM>

<B>A Superhighway Through the Wasteland?</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>Mitchell Kapor is chairman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a
nonprofit group that promotes civil liberties in digital media. He was a
founder of the Lotus Development Corporation, from which he resigned in
1986. Jerry Berman is executive director of the foundation.</EM>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
   <EM>(Washington)</EM> Telecommunications and cable TV executives, seeking to
allay concerns over their proposed megamergers, insist that the coming
electronic superhighway will be an educational and informational tool as
well as a cornucopia of interactive entertainment. Allow the marriage
between entertainment and communications giants, we are told, and they will
connect students with learning resources, provide a forum for political
discourse, increase economic competitiveness and speed us into the
multimedia information age.
<P>
   Both broadcast and cable TV were introduced with similar fanfare. The
results have been disappointing. Because of regulatory failure and the
limits of the technology, they failed to be saviors of education or
political life. We love the tube but recognize that it is largely a
cultural wasteland.
<P>
    For the Government to break this cycle of promise and disappointment,
communications mergers should be approved or barred based on detailed,
enforceable commitments that the electronic superhighway will meet public
goals. The amount of electronic material the superhighway can carry is
dizzying compared to the relatively narrow range of broadcast TV and the
limited number of cable channels. Properly constructed and regulated, it
could be open to all who wish to speak, publish and communicate.
<P>
   None of the interactive services will be possible, however, if we have
an eight-lane data superhighway rushing into every home and only a narrow
footpath coming back out. Instead of settling for a multimedia version of
the same entertainment that is increasingly dissatisfying on today's TV, we
need a superhighway that encourages the production and distribution of a
broader, more diverse range of programming.
<P>
   The superhighway should be required to provide so-called open platform
services. In today's channel-based cable TV system, program producers must
negotiate for channel space with cable companies around the country. In an
open platform network, we would avoid that bottleneck. Every person would
have access to the entire superhighway, so programmers could distribute
information directly to consumers.
<P>
   Consumers would become producers: individuals and small organizations
could create and distribute programs to anyone on the highway who wants
them. Open platform services will spur diversity in the electronic media,
just as low production and distribution costs make possible a wide variety
of newspapers and magazines.
<P>
   To prevent abuses by media giants that because of recent Federal court
decisions will control the pipeline into the home and much of the content
delivered over it, we need new laws. Like today's phone companies, the
companies controlling the superhighway must be required to carry other
programmers' content, just as phone companies must provide service to
anyone who is willing to pay for it. We must guarantee that anyone who,
say, wants to start an alternative news network or a forum for political
discussion is given an outlet to do so.
<P>
   Americans will come to depend on the superhighway even more than they
need the telephone. The guarantee of universal telephone service must be
expanded to include universal access to the superhighway. Although market
forces will help keep the new technology affordable, we need laws to
protect consumers when competition fails.
<P>
   And because several companies will operate the highway, each must be
required to interconnect with the others. Likewise, the new computers that
will give us access to the superhighway should be built according to
commonly accepted standards.
<P>
   Also, even an open, competitive market will leave out organizations with
limited resources such as schools and libraries. To compensate for market
oversights, we must insure that money -- whether through Federal support or
a tax on the companies that will control the superhighway -- is made
available to these institutions. Finally, people won't use the new
technology unless they feel that their privacy is protected. Technical
means, such as recently developed encryption techniques, must be made
available to all users. And clear legal guidelines for individual control
over access to and reuse of personal information must be established.
Companies that sell entertainment services will have a record of what their
customers' interests are; these records must remain confidential.
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, T.C.I., Time-Warner, U.S. West and other companies
involved in proposed mergers have promised to allow the public full access
to the superhighway. But they are asking policy makers to trust that,
profits aside, they will use their new positions for the public good.
<P>
   Rather than opposing mergers or blindly trusting competition to shape
the data highways, Congress should make the mergers hinge on detailed
commitments to provide affordable services to all Americans. Some
legislators, led by Representative Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts,
are working to enact similar requirements; these efforts deserve support.
<P>
   The best approach would be to amend these requirements to the
Communications Act of 1934. Still the central law on open access, an
updated Communications Act would codify the terms of a new social contract
between the the telecommunications industry and the American people.

Senior Writer, Network World, Framingham, Mass.
<P>
Welcome to the Internet! You're about to start a journey through a 
unique land without frontiers, a place that is everywhere at once -- even 
though it exists physically only as a series of electrical impulses.  
You'll be joining a growing community of millions of people around the 
world who use this global resource on a daily basis.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX59"></A>
<A NAME="IDX60"></A>
<A NAME="IDX61"></A>
With this book, you will be able to use the Internet to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Stay in touch with friends, relatives and colleagues around the
world, at a fraction of the cost of phone calls or even air
mail.
<P>
<LI>
Discuss everything from archaeology to zoology with people in 
several different languages.    
<P>
<LI>
Tap into thousands of information databases and libraries 
worldwide.
<P>
<LI>
Retrieve any of thousands of documents, journals, books and
computer programs.
<P>
<LI>
Stay up to date with wire-service news and sports and 
with official weather reports.
<P>
<LI>
Play live, "real time" games with dozens of other people at once.
</UL>
<P>
And you will have become the newest member of this ever growing
community. If you stay and contribute, the Net will be richer for it --
and so will you.
<P>
But it will take a sense of adventure, a willingness to learn and
an ability to take a deep breath every once in awhile.
<P>
Connecting to "the Net" today, takes something of a sense of 
adventure, a willingness to learn and an ability to take a deep breath 
every once in awhile. Visiting the Net today is a lot like journeying to 
a foreign country.  There are so many things to see and do, but 
everything at first will seem so, well, foreign.  
<P>
When you first arrive, you won't be able to read the street signs.
You'll get lost.  If you're unlucky, you may even run into some locals
who'd just as soon you went back to where you came from.  If this
weren't enough, the entire country is constantly under construction;
every day, it seems like there's something new for you to figure out.
<P>
Fortunately, most of the locals are actually friendly.  In fact, the 
Net actually has a rich tradition of helping out visitors and newcomers.  
Until very recently, there were few written guides for ordinary people, 
and the Net grew largely through an "oral" tradition in which the
old-timers helped the newcomers.
<P>
Here's where you take a deep breath.  Fortunately, most of the
natives are actually friendly.  In fact, the Net actually has a rich
tradition of helping out visitors and newcomers.  With few written
guides for ordinary people, the Net has grown in large part one person
at a time -- if somebody helps you learn your way around, it's almost
expected you'll repay the favor some day by helping somebody else.
<P>
So when you connect, don't be afraid to ask for help.  You'll be
surprised at how many people will lend a hand!
<P>
Without such folks, in fact, this guide would not be possible. My 
thanks to all the people who have written with suggestion, additions and 
corrections since the Big Dummy's Guide first appeared on the Internet in 
1993.
<P>
Special thanks go to the following people, who, whether they know it 
or not, provided particular help -- and to my loving wife Nancy:
<P>
Rhonda Chapman, Jim Cocks, Tom Czarnik, Christopher Davis, David 
DeSimone, Jeanne deVoto, Phil Eschallier, Nico Garcia, Joe Granrose, 
Joerg Heitkoetter, Joe Ilacqua, Jonathan Kamens, Peter Kaminski, Thomas 
A. Kreeger, Stanton McCandlish, Leanne Phillips, Nancy Reynolds, Helen 
Trillian Rose, Barry Shein, Jennifer "Moira" Smith, Gerard van der Leun 
and Scott Yanoff. 
<P>
If you have any suggestions or comments on how to make this guide 
better, I'd love to hear them.  You can reach me via e-mail at 
<TT>&lt;adamg@world.std.com&gt;</TT>.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Ready - Set</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_7.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_9.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC11">Ready, Set...</A></H2>
<P>
The world is just a phone call away.  With a computer and modem, 
you'll be able to connect to the Internet, the world's largest computer 
network (and if you're lucky, you won't even need the modem; many 
colleges and companies now give their students or employees direct access 
to the Internet).
<P>
The phone line can be your existing voice line -- just remember
that if you have any extensions, you (and everybody else in the house
or office) won't be able to use them for voice calls while you are connected
<A NAME="IDX62"></A>
to the Net.
<P>
A modem is a sort of translator between computers and the phone
system. It's needed because computers and the phone system process and
transmit data, or information, in two different, and incompatible
ways.  Computers "talk" digitally; that is, they store and process
information as a series of discrete numbers.  The phone network relies
on analog signals, which on an oscilloscope would look like a series
of waves.  When your computer is ready to transmit data to another
computer over a phone line, your modem converts the computer numbers
into these waves (which sound like a lot of screeching) -- it
"modulates" them.  In turn, when information waves come into your
modem, it converts them into numbers your computer can process, by
<A NAME="IDX63"></A>
<A NAME="IDX64"></A>
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>
"demodulating" them.
<P>
Increasingly, computers come with modems already installed. If
yours didn't, you'll have to decide what speed modem to get.  Modem
speeds are judged in "bps rate" or bits per second.  One bps means 
the modem can transfer roughly one bit per second; the greater the
bps rate, the more quickly a modem can send and receive information.  
<A NAME="IDX66"></A>
A letter or character is made up of eight bits.
<P>
You can now buy a 2400-bps modem for well under $60 -- and most now 
come with the ability to handle fax messages as well.  At prices that now 
start around $150, you can buy a modem that can transfer data at 14,400
bps (and often even faster, using special compression techniques).  If you 
think you might be using the Net to transfer large numbers of files, a 
faster modem is always worth the price. It will dramatically reduce the 
amount of time your modem or computer is tied up transferring files and, if 
you are paying for Net access by the hour, will save you quite a bit in 
<A NAME="IDX67"></A>
<A NAME="IDX68"></A>
online charges. 
<P>
Like the computer to which it attaches, a modem is useless
without software to tell it how to work.  Most modems today come with
easy-to-install software.  Try the program out. If you find it
difficult to use or understand, consider a trip to the local software
store to find a better program.  You can spend several hundred dollars
on a communications program, but unless you have very specialized
needs, this will be a waste of money, as there are a host of excellent
programs available for around $100 or less.  Among the basic features you 
want to look for are a choice of different "protocols" (more on them in a 
bit) for transferring files to and from the Net and the ability to write 
"script" or "command" files that let you automate such steps as logging 
into a host system. 
<P>
When you buy a modem and the software, ask the dealer how to
install and use them.  Try out the software if you can.  If the dealer
can't help you, find another dealer.  You'll not only save yourself a
lot of frustration, you'll also have practiced the prime Internet 
directive: <EM>"Ask. People Know."</EM>
<P>
To fully take advantage of the Net, you must spend a few minutes
going over the manuals or documentation that comes with your software.
There are a few things you should pay special attention to: uploading
and downloading; screen capturing (sometimes called "screen dumping");
logging; how to change protocols; and terminal emulation.  It is also
essential to know how to convert a file created with your word
processing program into "ASCII" or "text" format, which will let you
share your thoughts with others across the Net.
<P>
Uploading is the process of sending a file from your computer to a
system on the Net. Downloading is retrieving a file from somewhere on
the Net to your computer. In general, things in cyberspace go "up" to
<A NAME="IDX69"></A>
the Net and come "down" to you.
<P>
Chances are your software will come with a choice of several
"protocols" to use for these transfers.  These protocols are systems
designed to ensure that line noise or static does not cause errors that
could ruin whatever information you are trying to transfer.
Essentially, when using a protocol, you are transferring a file in a
series of pieces.  After each piece is sent or received, your computer
and the Net system compare it. If the two pieces don't match exactly,
they transfer it again, until they agree that the information they both
have is identical.  If, after several tries, the information just
doesn't make it across, you'll either get an error message or your
screen will freeze.  In that case, try it again.  If, after five tries,
you are still stymied, something is wrong with a) the file; b) the
telephone line; c) the system you're connected to; or d) your own
<A NAME="IDX70"></A>
<A NAME="IDX71"></A>
computer.
<P>
From time to time, you will likely see messages on the Net that
you want to save for later viewing -- a recipe, a particularly witty
remark, something you want to write your congressman about, whatever.
This is where screen capturing and logging come in.
<P>
When you tell your communications software to capture a screen, it
opens a file in your computer (usually in the same directory or folder
used by the software) and "dumps" an image of whatever happens to be
on your screen at the time.
<P>
Logging works a bit differently.  When you issue a logging
command, you tell the software to open a file (again, usually in the
same directory or folder as used by the software) and then give it a
name. Then, until you turn off the logging command, everything that
scrolls on your screen is copied into that file, sort of like
recording on videotape.  This is useful for capturing long documents
that scroll for several pages -- using screen capture, you would have
to repeat the same command for each new screen.
<P>
Terminal emulation is a way for your computer to mimic, or
emulate, the way other computers put information on the screen and
accept commands from a keyboard.  In general, most systems on the Net
use a system called VT100.  Fortunately, almost all communications
programs now on the market support this system as well -- make sure
yours does.
<P>
You'll also have to know about protocols.  There are several
different ways for computers to transmit characters.  Fortunately,
there are only two protocols that you're likely to run across: 8-1-N
(which stands for "8 bits, 1 stop bit, no parity" -- yikes!) and 7-1-E
<A NAME="IDX72"></A>
(7 bits, 1 stop bit, even parity).
<P>
In general, Unix-based systems use 7-1-E, while MS-DOS-based
systems use 8-1-N.  What if you don't know what kind of system you're
connecting to?  Try one of the settings.  If you get what looks like
gobbledygook when you connect, you may need the other setting.  
If so, you can either change the setting while connected, and then hit
enter, or hang up and try again with the other setting.  It's also
possible your modem and the modem at the other end can't agree on the
right bps rate.  If changing the protocols doesn't work, try using 
another bps rate (but no faster than the one listed for your modem). 
Don't worry, remember, you can't break anything!  If something looks wrong, 
it probably is wrong.  Change your settings and try again.  Nothing is
learned without trial, error and effort.
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>
Those are the basics. Now on to the Net!

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Go!</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_8.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_10.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC12">Go!</A></H2>
<P>
Once, only people who studied or worked at an institution
directly tied to the Net could connect to the world.  Today, though,
an ever-growing number of "public-access" systems provide access for
everybody.  These systems can now be found in several states, and there
are a couple of sites that can provide access across the country.
<P>
There are two basic kinds of these host systems.  The more common
one is known as a UUCP site (UUCP being a common way to transfer
information among computers using the Unix operating system) and
<A NAME="IDX74"></A>
offers access to international electronic mail and conferences.
<P>
However, recent years have seen the growth of more powerful sites
that let you tap into the full power of the Net.  These Internet sites
not only give you access to electronic mail and conferences but to
such services as databases, libraries and huge file and program
collections around the world.  They are also fast -- as soon as you
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>
finish writing a message, it gets zapped out to its destination.
<P>
Some sites are run by for-profit companies; others by non-profit
organizations.  Some of these public-access, or host, systems, are
free of charge.  Others charge a monthly or yearly fee for unlimited
access.  And a few charge by the hour. Systems that charge for access 
will usually let you sign up online with a credit card.  Some also let 
<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
<A NAME="IDX77"></A>
<A NAME="IDX78"></A>
you set up a billing system. 
<P>
But cost should be only one consideration in choosing a host 
system, especially if you live in an area with more than one provider.  
Most systems let you look around before you sign up.  What is the range 
of each of their services?  How easy is each to use? What kind of support or 
help can you get from the system administrators? 
<P>
The last two questions are particularly important because many     
systems provide no user interface at all; when you connect, you are
dumped right into the Unix operating system.  If you're already
familiar with Unix, or you want to learn how to use it, these systems
offer phenomenal power -- in addition to Net access, most also let you
tap into the power of Unix to do everything from compiling your own
programs to playing online games.
<P>
But if you don't want to have to learn Unix, there are other
public-access systems that work through menus (just like the ones in
restaurants; you are shown a list of choices and then you make your
selection of what you want), or which provide a "user interface" that
is easier to figure out than the ever cryptic Unix.
<P>
If you don't want or need access to the full range of Internet
services, a UUCP site makes good financial sense.  They tend to charge
less than commercial Internet providers, although their messages may
<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
not go out as quickly.
<P>
Some systems also have their own unique local services, which can
range from extensive conferences to large file libraries.

<P>
When you have your communications program dial one of these host
systems, one of two things will happen when you connect.  You'll
either see a lot of gibberish on your screen, or you'll be asked to
log in.  If you see gibberish, chances are you have to change your
software's parameters (to 7-1-E or 8-1-N as the case may be).  Hang
up, make the change and then dial in again.
<P>
When you've connected, chances are you'll see something like
this:
<P>
<PRE>
Welcome to THE WORLD
Public Access UNIX for the '90s
Login as <SAMP>`new'</SAMP> if you do not have an account

login:
</PRE>
<P>
That last line is a prompt asking you to do something.  Since
this is your first call, type
<P>
<PRE>
new
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  Often, when you're asked to type something by a host
system, you'll be told what to type in quotation marks (for example,
<SAMP>`new'</SAMP> above).  Don't include the quotation marks.  Repeat: Don't
include the quotation marks.
<P>
What you see next depends on the system, but will generally
consist of information about its costs and services (you might want to
turn on your communication software's logging function, to save this
information).  You'll likely be asked if you want to establish an
account now or just look around the system.
<P>
You'll also likely be asked for your "user name."  This is not
your full name, but a one-word name you want to use while online.  It
can be any combination of letters or numbers, all in lower case.  Many
people use their first initial and last name (for example,
"jdoe"); their first name and the first letter of their last name
(for example, "johnd"); or their initials ("jxd").  Others use a
nickname.  You might want to think about this for a second, because this
user name will become part of your electronic-mail address
(see section <A HREF="bdg_44.html#SEC47">Electronic Mail</A>).  The one exception is the various Free-Net
systems, all of which assign you a user name consisting of an arbitrary
<A NAME="IDX80"></A>
sequence of letters and numbers.
<P>
You are now on the Net.  Look around the system.  See if there
are any help files for you to read.  If it's a menu-based host system, 
choose different options just to see what happens.  Remember: You can't 
break anything.  The more you play, the more comfortable you'll be. 
<P>
What follows is a list of public-access Internet sites, which are
computer systems that offer access to the Net.  All offer international
e-mail and Usenet (international conferences).  In addition, they offer:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX81"></A>
<A NAME="IDX82"></A>
<DT>FTP
<DD>File-transfer protocol -- access to hundreds of file
libraries (everything from computer software to historical
documents to song lyrics).  You'll be able to transfer
these files from the Net to your own computer.

their first call; this list provides the name you'll use in such cases.

<P>
If you don't live in an area with a public-access site, you'll still 
be able to connect to the Net.  Several services offer access 
through national data networks such as the CompuServe Packet Network and 
SprintNet, which have dozens, even hundreds of local dial-in numbers across 
the country.  These include Holonet in Berkeley, Calf., Portal in 
Cupertino, Calf., the WELL in Sausalito, Calf., Dial 'N CERF in San Diego, 
Calf., the World in Brookline, Mass., and Michnet in Ann Arbor, Mich.  Dial 
'N CERF offers access through an 800 number.  Expect to pay from $2 to $12 
an hour to use these networks, above each provider's basic charges.  The 
exact amount depends on the network, time of day and type of modem you use.  
<A NAME="IDX94"></A>
<A NAME="IDX95"></A>
<A NAME="IDX96"></A>
<A NAME="IDX97"></A>
<A NAME="IDX98"></A>
<A NAME="IDX99"></A>
<A NAME="IDX100"></A>
<A NAME="IDX101"></A>
For more information, contact the above services. 
<P>
Four other providers deliver Net access to users across the 
country:
<P>
<B>Delphi</B>, based in Cambridge, Mass., is a consumer-oriented network
much like CompuServe or America On-Line -- only it now offers
<A NAME="IDX102"></A>
subscribers access to Internet services. 
<P>
Charges: $3 a month for Internet access, in addition to standard 
charges.  These are $10 a month for four hours of off-peak (non-working 
hours) access a month and $4 an hour for eachs additional hour or $20 for 
20 hours of access a month and $1.80 an hour for each additional hour.  
For more information, call (800) 695-4005.
<P>
<B>PSI</B>, based in Reston, Va., provides nationwide access to Internet
services through scores of local dial-in numbers to owners of IBM and
compatible computers.  PSILink. which includes access to e-mail,
Usenet and ftp, costs $29 a month, plus a one-time $19 registration
fee.  Special software is required, but is available free from PSI.
PSI's Global Dialup Service provides access to telnet for $39 a month
plus a one-time $39 set-up fee.  For more information, call (800)
<A NAME="IDX103"></A>
82PSI82 or (703) 620-6651.
<P>
<B>BIX</B> (the Byte Information Exchange) offers FTP, Telnet and e-mail
access to the Internet as part of their basic service. Owned by the same 
company as Delphi, it also offers 20 hours of access a month for $20.  
<A NAME="IDX104"></A>
<A NAME="IDX105"></A>
For more information, call (800) 695-4775.
<P>
<B>NovX Systems Integration</B>, based in Seattle, Washington, offers full 
Internet access through an 800 number reachable across the United States. 
There is a $24.95 setup fee, in addition to a monthly fee of $19.95 and a

<H2><A NAME="SEC43" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC43">Net Origins</A></H2>
<P>
In the 1960s, researchers began experimenting with linking
computers to each other and to people through telephone hook-ups,
using funds from the U.S Defense Department's Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA).
<P>
ARPA wanted to see if computers in different locations could be
linked using a new technology known as packet switching, which had the
promise of letting several users share just one communications line.
Previous computer networking efforts had required a line between each
computer on the network, sort of like a train track on which only one
train can travel at a time.  The packet system allowed for creation of
a data highway, in which large numbers of vehicles could essentially
share the same lane.  Each packet was given the computer equivalent of
a map and a time stamp, so that it could be sent to the right
destination, where it would then be reassembled into a message the
<A NAME="IDX107"></A>
computer or a human could use.
<P>
This system allowed computers to share data and the researchers to
exchange electronic mail, or e-mail.  In itself, e-mail was something
of a revolution, offering the ability to send detailed letters at the
speed of a phone call.
<P>
As this system, known as ARPANet, grew, some enterprising college
students (and one in high school) developed a way to use it to conduct
online conferences.  These started as science-oriented discussions, but
they soon branched out into virtually every other field, as people
recognized the power of being able to "talk" to hundreds, or even 
<A NAME="IDX108"></A>
thousands, of people around the country.
<P>
In the 1970s, ARPA helped support the development of rules, or 
protocols, for transferring data between different types of computer 
networks.  These "internet" (from "internetworking") protocols made it 
possible to develop the worldwide Net we have today that links all sorts 
of computers across national boundaries. By the close of the 1970s, links 
developed between ARPANet and counterparts in other countries.  The world 
was now tied together in a computer web.
<P>
By the close of the 1970s, links developed between ARPANet and
counterparts in other countries.  The world was now tied together in a
computer web.
<P>
In the 1980s, this network of networks, which became known
collectively as the Internet, expanded at a phenomenal rate.  Hundreds,
then thousands, of colleges, research companies and government agencies
began to connect their computers to this worldwide Net.  Some
enterprising hobbyists and companies unwilling to pay the high costs of
Internet access (or unable to meet stringent government regulations for
access) learned how to link their own systems to the Internet, even if
"only" for e-mail and conferences.  Some of these systems began
offering access to the public. Now anybody with a computer and modem --
and persistence -- could tap into the world. 
<P>
In the 1990s, the Net grows at exponential rates.  Some estimates
are that the volume of messages transferred through the Net grows 20
percent a month.  In response, government and other users have tried in
recent years to expand the Net itself.  Once, the main Net "backbone" in
the U.S. moved data at 1.5 million bits per second.  That proved too
slow for the ever increasing amounts of data being sent over it, and in
recent years the maximum speed was increased to 1.5 million and then 45 
million bits per second. Even before the Net was able to reach that 
latter speed, however, Net experts were already figuring out ways to pump 
data at speeds of up to 2 billion bits per second -- fast enough to send 
the entire Encyclopedia Britannica across the country in just one or two 
seconds. 
<P>
Another major change has been the development of commercial 
services that provide internetworking services at speeds comparable to 
those of the government system.  In fact, by mid-1994, the U.S. 
government will remove itself from any day-to-day control over the 
workings of the Net, as regional and national providers continue to 
expand.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - How it Works</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_40.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_42.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC44" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC44">How it Works</A></H2>
<P>
The worldwide Net is actually a complex web of smaller regional
networks.  To understand it, picture a modern road network of
trans-continental superhighways connecting large cities.
From these large cities come smaller freeways and parkways to link together
small towns, whose residents travel on slower, narrow residential ways.  
<P>
The Net superhighway is the high-speed Internet.  Connected to
this are computers that use a particular system of transferring data
at high speeds.  In the U.S., the major Internet "backbone"
theoretically can move data at rates of 45 million bits per second
(compare this to the average home modem, which has a top speed of roughly
9,600 to 14,400 bits per second).  This internetworking "protocol" lets network users
<A NAME="IDX109"></A>
<A NAME="IDX110"></A>
connect to computers around the world.
<P>
Connected to the backbone computers are smaller networks serving 
particular geographic regions, which generally move data at speeds 
around 1.5 million bits per second.
<P>
Feeding off these in turn are even smaller networks or individual 
computers.
<P>
Unlike commercial networks such as CompuServe or Prodigy,
<A NAME="IDX111"></A>
<A NAME="IDX112"></A>
the Internet is not run by one central computer or computers.
This is both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness.   The approach 
means it is virtually impossible for the entire Net to crash at once -- 
even if one computer shuts down, the rest of the network stays up.  The 
design also reduces the costs for an individual or organization to get 
onto the network.  But thousands of connected computers can also make it 
difficult to navigate the Net and find what you want -- especially as 
different computers may have different commands for plumbing their 
resources.  It is only recently that Net users have begun to develop the 
sorts of navigational tools and "maps" that will let neophytes get around 
without getting lost. 
<P>
Nobody really knows how many computers and networks actually make
up this Net.  Some estimates say there are now as many as 5,000
networks connecting nearly 2 million computers and more than 15 million 
people around the world.  Whatever the actual numbers, however, it is 
clear they are only increasing.
<P>
The Net is more than just a technological marvel. It is human
communication at its most fundamental level.  The pace may be a little
quicker when the messages race around the world in a few seconds, but
it's not much different from a large and interesting party. You'll see
things in cyberspace that will make you laugh; you'll see things that
will anger you.  You'll read silly little snippets and new ideas that
make you think.  You'll make new friends and meet people you wish would
just go away.
<P>
Major network providers continue to work on ways to make it
easier for users of one network to communicate with those of another.  
Work is underway on a system for providing a universal "white pages"
in which you could look up somebody's electronic-mail address, for
example.  This connectivity trend will likely speed up in coming years
as users begin to demand seamless network access, much as telephone
users can now dial almost anywhere in the world without worrying about
<A NAME="IDX113"></A>
<A NAME="IDX114"></A>
how many phone companies actually have to connect their calls.
<P>
And today, the links grow ever closer between the Internet and such 
commercial networks as CompuServe and Prodigy, whose users can now 
exchange electronic mail with their Internet friends.  Some commercial 
providers, such as Delphi and America Online, are working to bring their 
<A NAME="IDX115"></A>
<A NAME="IDX116"></A>
subscribers direct access to Internet services.
<P>
And as it becomes easier to use, more and more people will join
this worldwide community we call the Net.
<P>
Being connected to the Net takes more than just reading
conferences and logging messages to your computer; it takes asking and
answering questions, exchanging opinions -- getting involved.
<P>
If you choose to go forward, to use and contribute, you will become
a "citizen of Cyberspace."  If you're reading these words for the first 
time, this may seem like an amusing but unlikely notion -- that one
could "inhabit" a place without physical space.  But put a mark beside 
these words.  Join the Net and actively participate for a year.  Then
re-read this passage.  It will no longer seem so strange to be a
"citizen of Cyberspace."  It will seem like the most natural thing in
the world.
<P>
And that leads to a fundamental thing to remember:
<P>
<B>You can't break the Net!</B>
<P>
As you travel the Net, your computer may freeze, your screen may
erupt into a mass of gibberish.  You may think you've just disabled a
million-dollar computer somewhere -- or even your own personal
computer.  Sooner or later, this feeling happens to everyone -- and
likely more than once. But the Net and your computer are hardier than
you think, so relax.  You can no more break the Net than you can the
phone system.  If something goes wrong, try again.  If nothing at all 
happens, you can always disconnect.   If worse comes to worse, you can 
turn off your computer.  Then take a deep breath.  And dial right back 
in. Leave a note for the person who runs the computer to which you've 
connected to ask for advice.  Try it again. Persistence pays.  
<P>
Stay and contribute.  The Net will be richer for it -- and so will 
you.

Your computer connects with a public-access site and get
gibberish on your screen.  If you are using parameters of 8-1-N, try
7-1-e (or vice-versa).  If that doesn't work, try another modem speed.
<P>

You have your computer dial a public-access site, but nothing
happens.  Check the phone number you typed in.  If correct, turn on your
modem's speaker (on Hayes-compatible modems, you can usually do this by
typing ATM1 in your communications software's "terminal mode").  If the
phone just rings and rings, the public-access site could be down for
maintenance or due to a crash or some other problem.  If you get a
"connect" message, but nothing else, try hitting enter or escape a

The Net grows so fast that even the best guide to its resources 
would be somewhat outdated the day it was printed.  At the end of each 
chapter, however, you'll find FYI pointers to places on the Net where you 
can go for more information or to keep updated on new resources and 
services. 
<P>
<VAR>Peter Kaminski</VAR> maintains a list of systems that provide public access to 
Internet services.  It's availble on the network itself, which obviously 
does you little good if you currently have no access, but which can 
prove invaluable should you move or want to find a new system.  Look for 
his "PDIAL" file in the <TT>alt.bbs.lists</TT> or <TT>news.answers</TT>
newsgroups in Usenet (for information on accessing Usenet,

You'll find numerous documents about the Internet, its history and
its resources in the <TT>`pub/Net_info'</TT> directory on the Electronic Frontier
Foundation's FTP server (see section <A HREF="bdg_132.html#SEC135">FTP (Mining the Net, part II)</A> to decipher this).

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - The Basics</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_44.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_46.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC48" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC48">The Basics</A></H2>
Electronic mail, or e-mail, is your personal connection to the
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
world of the Net.
<P>
All of the millions of people around the world who use the 
Net have their own e-mail addresses.  A growing number of "gateways" tie 
more and more people to the Net every day.  When you logged onto the host 
system you are now using, it automatically generated an address for you, 
<A NAME="IDX125"></A>
as well. 
<P>
The basic concepts behind e-mail parallel those of regular mail.
You send mail to people at their particular addresses.  In turn, they
write to you at your e-mail address.  You can subscribe to the 
electronic equivalent of magazines and newspapers. You might even get 
<A NAME="IDX126"></A>
electronic junk mail.
<P>
E-mail has two distinct advantages over regular mail.  The most 
obvious is speed. Instead of several days, your message can reach the 
other side of the world in hours, minutes or even seconds (depending on 
where you drop off your mail and the state of the connections between
there and your recipient).  The other advantage is that once you master
the basics, you'll be able to use e-mail to access databases and file
libraries.  You'll see how to do this later, along with learning how to
transfer program and data files through e-mail.
<P>
E-mail also has advantages over the telephone.  You send your
message when it's convenient for you.  Your recipients respond at their 
convenience.  No more telephone tag.  And while a phone call across
the country or around the world can quickly result in huge phone
bills, e-mail lets you exchange vast amounts of mail for only a few
pennies -- even if the other person is in New Zealand.
<P>
E-mail is your connection to help -- your Net lifeline.  The
Net can sometimes seem a frustrating place!  No matter how hard you
try, no matter where you look, you just might not be able to find the
answer to whatever is causing you problems. But when you know how to
use e-mail, help is often just a few keystrokes away: you can ask your 
system administrator or a friend for help in an e-mail message.
<P>
The quickest way to start learning e-mail is to send yourself a
message.  Most public-access sites actually have several different types 
of mail systems, all of which let you both send and receive mail. We'll 
start with the simplest one, known, appropriately enough, as "mail," and 
then look at a couple of other interfaces. At your host system's command 
prompt, type: 
<P>
<PRE>
mail username
</PRE>
<P>
where username is the name you gave yourself when you first logged on.
Hit enter.  The computer might respond with
<P>
<PRE>
Subject:
</PRE>
<P>
Type
<P>
<PRE>
test
</PRE>
<P>
or, actually, anything at all (but you'll have to hit enter before
you get to the end of the screen). Hit enter.
<P>
The cursor will drop down a line. You can now begin writing the
actual message. Type a sentence, again, anything at all.  And here's
where you hit your first Unix frustration, one that will bug you
repeatedly: you have to hit enter before you get to the very end of
the line.  Just like typewriters, many Unix programs have no
word-wrapping.<A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A>
<P>
When done with your message, hit return. Now hit control-D (the
control and the D keys at the same time).  This is a Unix command that
tells the computer you're done writing and that it should close your
"envelope" and mail it off (you could also hit enter once and then, on
a blank line, type a period at the beginning of the line and hit enter
again).
<P>
You've just sent your first e-mail message.  And because you're
sending mail to yourself, rather than to someone somewhere else on the
Net, your message has already arrived, as we'll see in a moment.
<P>
If you had wanted, you could have even written your message on
your own computer and then uploaded it into this electronic
"envelope."  There are a couple of good reasons to do this with long
or involved messages.  One is that once you hit enter at the end of a
line in "mail" you can't readily fix any mistakes on that line (unless
you use some special commands to call up a Unix text processor).  Also,
if you are paying for access by the hour, uploading a prepared
message can save you money.  Remember to save the document in ASCII or
text format.  Uploading a document you've created in a word processor
that uses special formatting commands (which these days means many
programs) will cause strange effects.
<P>
When you get that blank line after the subject line, upload the
message using the ASCII protocol.  Or you can copy and paste the text,
if your software allows that. When done, hit control-D as above.
<P>
Now you have mail waiting for you.  Normally, when you log on,
your public-access site will tell you whether you have new mail
waiting.  To open your mailbox and see your waiting mail, type
<P>
<PRE>
mail
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.
<P>
When the host system sees "mail" without a name after it, it
knows you want to look in your mailbox rather than send a message.
Your screen, on a plain-vanilla Unix system will display:
<P>
<PRE>
Mail version SMI 4.0 Mon Apr 24 18:34:15 PDT 1989  Type ? for help.
"/usr/spool/mail/adamg": 1 message 1 new 1 unread

&#62;N 1 adamg              Sat Jan 15 20:04   12/290   test
</PRE>
<P>
Ignore the first line; it's just computerese of value only to the
people who run your system. You can type a question mark and hit
return, but unless you're familiar with Unix, most of what you'll see
won't make much sense at this point.
<P>
The second line tells you the directory on the host system where
your mail messages are put, which again, is not something you'll likely 
need to know.  The second line also tells you how many messages are in your 
mailbox, how many have come in since the last time you looked and how
many messages you haven't read yet.
<P>
It's the third line that is of real interest -- it tells you who
the message is from, when it arrived, how many lines and characters
it takes up, and what the subject is.  The "N" means it is a new
message -- it arrived after the last time you looked in your mailbox.
Hit enter. And there's your message -- only now it's a lot
longer than what you wrote!
<P>
<PRE>
Message 1:
From adamg Jan 15 20:04:55 1994
Received: by eff.org id AA28949
(5.65c/IDA-1.4.4/pen-ident for adamg); Sat, 15 Jan 1994 20:04:55 -0400  
(ident-sender: adamg@eff.org)
Date: Sat, 15 Jan 1994 21:34:55 -0400

Message-Id: &#60;199204270134.AA28949@eff.org&#62;
To: adamg
Subject: test
Status: R

This is only a test!
</PRE>
<P>
Whoa! What is all that stuff? It's your message with a postmark
gone mad.  Just as the postal service puts its marks on every piece of
mail it handles, so do Net postal systems.  Only it's called a
"header" instead of a postmark. Each system that handles or routes
your mail puts its stamp on it.  Since many messages go through a
number of systems on their way to you, you will often get messages
with headers that seem to go on forever.  Among other things, a header
will tell you exactly when a message was sent and received (even the
difference between your local time and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) --
as at the end of line 4 above).
<P>
If this had been a long message, it would just keep scrolling
across and down your screen -- unless the people who run your
public-access site have set it up to pause every 24 lines.  One way to deal
with a message that doesn't stop is to use your telecommunication
software's logging or text-buffer function.  Start it before you hit
the number of the message you want to see.  Your computer will ask you
what you want to call the file you're about to create. After you name
the file and hit enter, type the number of the message you want to see
and hit enter.  When the message finishes scrolling, turn off the
text-buffer function. The message is now saved in your computer.  
This way, you can read the message while not connected to the Net
(which can save you money if you're paying by the hour) and write a
reply offline.
<P>
But in the meantime, now what?  You can respond to the message,
delete it or save it.  To respond, type a lowercase "r" and hit
enter.  You'll get something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
To: adamg
Subject: Re: test
</PRE>
<P>
Note that this time, you don't have to enter a user name.  The 
computer takes it from the message you're replying to and
automatically addresses your message to its sender. The computer also
automatically inserts a subject line, by adding "Re:" to the original 
subject.  From here, it's just like writing a new message. But say you
change your mind and decide not to reply after all. How do you get out
of the message? Hit control-C once. You'll get this:
<P>
<PRE>
(Interrupt -- one more to kill letter)
</PRE>
<P>
If you hit control-C once more, the message will disappear and you'll
get back to your mail's command line.
<P>
Now, if you type a lowercase "d" and then hit enter, you'll
delete the original message.  Type a lowercase "q" to exit your
mailbox.
<P>
If you type a "q" without first hitting "d", your message is
transferred to a file called mbox.  This file is where all read, but
un-deleted messages go.  If you want to leave it in your mailbox for
now, type a lowercase "x" and hit enter.  This gets you out of mail
without making any changes.
<P>
The mbox file works a lot like your mailbox.  To access it, type
<P>
<PRE>
mail -f mbox
</PRE>
<P>
at your host system's command line and hit enter.
<P>
You'll get a menu identical to the one in your mailbox from which
you can read these old messages, delete them or respond to them.  It's
probably a good idea to clear out your mailbox and mbox file from
time to time, if only to keep them uncluttered.
<P>
Are there any drawbacks to e-mail?  There are a few.  One is that
people seem more willing to fly off the handle electronically than in
person, or over the phone.  Maybe it's because it's so easy to hit R
and reply to a message without pausing and reflecting a moment.
That's why we have smileys (see section <A HREF="bdg_48.html#SEC51">Smileys</A>)!  There's no online 
equivalent yet of a return receipt: chances are your message got to where 
it's going, but there's no absolute way for you to know for sure unless 
you get a reply from the other person.                
<P>
So now you're ready to send e-mail to other people on the Net.
Of course, you need somebody's address to send them mail.  How do you
get it?
<P>
Alas, the simplest answer is not what you'd call the most
elegant: you call them up on the phone or write them a letter on paper
and ask them.  Residents of the electronic frontier are only beginning
to develop the equivalent of phone books, and the ones that exist
today are far from complete (still, later on, see section <A HREF="bdg_89.html#SEC92">Telnet (Mining the Net, part I)</A>,
we'll show you how to use some of these directories).
<P>
Eventually, you'll start corresponding with people, which means
you'll want to know how to address mail to them.  It's vital to know
how to do this, because the smallest mistake -- using a comma when you
should have used a period, for instance, can bounce the message back
to you, undelivered.  In this sense, Net addresses are like phone
numbers: one wrong digit and you get the wrong person.  Fortunately,
most net addresses now adhere to a relatively easy-to-understand
system.
<P>
Earlier, you sent yourself a mail message using just your
user-name.  This was sort of like making a local phone call -- you didn't
have to dial a 1 or an area code.  This also works for mail to anybody
else who has an account on the same system as you.
<P>
Sending mail outside of your system, though, will require the use
of the Net equivalent of area codes, called "domains." A basic Net
address will look something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
tomg@world.std.com
</PRE>
<P>
Tomg is somebody's user ID, and he is at (hence the  sign) a site 
(or in Internetese, a "domain") known as <SAMP>`std.com'</SAMP>.  Large organizations 
often have more than one computer linked to the Internet; in this case, 
the name of the particular machine is world (you will quickly notice 
that, like boat owners, Internet computer owners always name their 
machines). 
<P>
Domains tell you the name of the organization that runs a given
e-mail site and what kind of site it is or, if it's not in the U.S.,
what country it's located in.  Large organizations may have more than
one computer or gateway tied to the Internet, so you'll often see a
two-part domain name; and sometimes even three- or four-part domain
names.
<P>
In general, American addresses end in an organizational suffix,
such as ".edu," which means the site is at a college or university.
Other American suffixes include:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>.com</CODE>
<DD>for businesses
<P>
<DT><CODE>.org</CODE>
<DD>for non-profit organizations
<P>
<DT><CODE>.gov</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>.mil</CODE>
<DD>for government and military agencies
<P>
<DT><CODE>.net</CODE>
<DD>for companies or organizations that run large networks.
</DL>
<P>
Sites in the rest of the world tend to use a two-letter code that
represents their country.  Most make sense, such as <SAMP>`.ca'</SAMP> for Canadian
sites, but there are a couple of seemingly odd ones, at least if
you don't know the ISO 3166 standard international abbreviations.
(see section <A HREF="bdg_279.html#SEC282">Internet Country Codes</A> for a list of the rest of the world.)
E.g., swiss sites end in <SAMP>`.ch'</SAMP> (Confederatio Helvetica),
German sites end in <SAMP>`.de'</SAMP> (DEutschland),
while South African ones end in <SAMP>`.za'</SAMP> (from the archaic spelling
Zuid Afrika).
Some U.S. sites have followed this international convention
(such as well.sf.ca.us).
<P>
You'll notice that the above addresses are all in lowercase.
Unlike almost everything else having anything at all to do with Unix,
most Net mailing systems don't care about case, so you generally don't 
have to worry about capitalizing e-mail addresses.  Alas, there are a few 
exceptions -- some public-access sites do allow for capital letters in 
user names.  When in doubt, ask the person you want to write to, or let 
her send you a message first (recall how a person's e-mail address is 
usually found on the top of her message). The domain name, the part of the 
address after the @ sign, never has to be capitalized.               
<P>
It's all a fairly simple system that works very well, except,
again, it's vital to get the address exactly right -- just as you have
to dial a phone number exactly right.  Send a message to <CODE>tomg@unm.edu</CODE>
(which is the University of New Mexico) when you meant to send it to
<CODE>tomg@umn.edu</CODE> (the University of Minnesota), and your letter will either
bounce back to you undelivered, or go to the wrong person.
<P>
If your message is bounced back to you as undeliverable, you'll
get an ominous looking-message from MAILER-DAEMON (actually a rather
benign Unix program that exists to handle mail), with an evil-looking
header followed by the text of your message. Sometimes, you can tell
what went wrong by looking at the first few lines of the bounced
message.  Besides an incorrect address, it's possible your host system
does not have the other site in the "map" it maintains of other host
systems. Or you could be trying to send mail to another network, such
as Bitnet or CompuServe, that has special addressing requirements.
<P>
Sometimes, figuring all this out can prove highly frustrating.
But remember the prime Net commandment: Ask.  Send a message to your
system administrator.  He or she might be able to help decipher the
problem.
<P>
There is one kind of address that may give your host system
particular problems.  There are two main ways that Unix systems
exchange mail.  One is known as UUCP and started out with a different
addressing system than the rest of the Net.  Most UUCP systems have
since switched over to the standard Net addressing system, but a few
traditional sites still cling to their original type, which tends to
have lots of exclamation points in it, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
uunet!somesite!othersite!mybuddy
</PRE>
<P>
The problem for many host sites is that exclamation points (also
known as "bangs") now mean something special in the more common systems 
or "shells" used to operate many Unix computers. This means that 
addressing mail to such a site (or even responding to a message you 
received from one) could confuse the poor computer to no end and your 
message never gets sent out. If that happens, try putting backslashes in 
front of each exclamation point, so that you get an address that looks 
like this: 
<P>
<PRE>
uunet\!somesite\!othersite\!mybuddy
</PRE>
<P>
Note that this means you may not be able to respond to such a message
by typing a lowercase <SAMP>`r'</SAMP>  -- you may get an error message and you'll 
have to create a brand-new message. 
<P>
If you want to get a taste of what's possible through e-mail,
start an e-mail message to
<P>
<PRE>
almanac@oes.orst.edu
</PRE>
<P>
Leave the "Subject:" line blank.  As a message, write this:
<P>
<PRE>
send quote
</PRE>
<P>
Or, if you're feeling a little down, write this instead:
<P>
<PRE>
send moral-support
</PRE>
<P>
In either case, you will get back a message within a few seconds to
a few hours (depending on the state of your host system's Internet
connection).  If you simply asked for a quote, you'll get back a
fortune-cookie-like saying.  If you asked for moral support, you'll also
<A NAME="IDX127"></A>
get back a fortune-cookie-like saying, only supposedly more uplifting.
<P>
This particular "mail server" is run by Oregon State University.
Its main purpose is actually to provide a way to distribute agricultural
information via e-mail.  If you'd like to find out how to use the
server's full range of services, send a message to its address with this 
line in it: 
<P>
<PRE>
send help
</PRE>
<P>
You'll quickly get back a lengthy document detailing just what's
available and how to get it.
<P>
Feeling opinionated?  Want to give the President of the United States
a piece of your mind?  Send a message to <TT>&lt;president@whitehouse.gov&gt;</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX128"></A>
<A NAME="IDX129"></A>
Or if the vice president will do, write <TT>&lt;vice-president@whitehouse.gov&gt;</TT>.
<P>
The "mail" program is actually a very powerful one and a Netwide
standard, at least on Unix computers.  But it can be hard to figure
out -- you can type a question mark to get a list of commands, but
these may be of limited use unless you're already familiar with Unix.
Fortunately, there are a couple of other mail programs that are easier
to use.

<P>
Elm is a combination mailbox and letter-writing system that uses
menus to help you navigate through mail.  Most Unix-based host systems
<A NAME="IDX130"></A>
now have it online. To use it, type
<P>
<PRE>
elm
<A NAME="IDX131"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You'll get a menu of your waiting mail, along with a
list of commands you can execute, that will look something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
Mailbox is '/usr/spool/mail/adamg' with 38 messages [ELM 2.3 PL11]

You can use any of the following commands by pressing the first character;
d)elete or u)ndelete mail, m)ail a message, r)eply or f)orward mail, q)uit
To read a message, press &#60;return&#62;. j = move down, k = move up, ? = help
<A NAME="IDX132"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
Each line shows the date you received the message, who sent it,
how many lines long the message is, and the message's subject.
<P>
If you are using VT100 emulation, you can move up and down the
menu with your up and down arrow keys.  Otherwise, type the line number
of the message you want to read or delete and hit enter.
<P>
When you read a message, it pauses every 24 lines, instead of
scrolling until it's done.  Hit the space bar to read the next page.
You can type a lowercase "r" to reply or a lowercase "q" or "i"
to get back to the menu (the I stands for "index").
<P>
At the main menu, hitting a lowercase "m" followed by enter
will let you start a message.  To delete a message, type a lowercase
"d".  You can do this while reading the message.  Or, if you are in
the menu, move the cursor to the message's line and then hit D.
<P>
When you're done with Elm, type a lowercase "q".  The program
will ask if you really want to delete the messages you marked. Then,
it will ask you if you want to move any messages you've read but
haven't marked for deletion to a "received" file.  For now, hit your
"n" key.
<P>
Elm has a major disadvantage for the beginner. The default text
editor it generally calls up when you hit your "r" or "m" key is
often a program called emacs. Unixoids swear by emacs, but everybody
else almost always finds it impossible.  Unfortunately, you can't
always get away from it (or vi, another text editor often found on
Unix systems), so later on we'll talk about some basic commands that
<A NAME="IDX133"></A>
<A NAME="IDX134"></A>
will keep you from going totally nuts.
<P>
If you want to save a message to your own computer, hit "s", either 
within the message or with your cursor on the message entry in the elm 
menu.  A filename will pop up.  If you do not like it, type a new name 
(you won't have to backspace).  Hit enter, and the message will be saved 
with that file name in your "home directory" on your host system.  After 
you exit elm, you can now download it (ask your system administrator for 
specifics on how to download -- and upload -- such files).

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - PINE</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_46.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_48.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC50" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC50">PINE -- An even better way</A></H2>
<P>
Pine is based on elm but includes a number of improvements that
make it an ideal mail system for beginners.   Like elm, pine starts
you with a menu.  It also has an "address book" feature that is handy
for people with long or complex e-mail addresses. Hitting A at the
main menu puts you in the address book, where you can type in the
person's first name (or nickname) followed by her address. Then, when
you want to send that person a message, you only have to type in her
first name or nickname, and pine automatically inserts her actual
address. The address book also lets you set up a mailing list.  This
feature allows you to send the same message to a number of people at
<A NAME="IDX135"></A>
once.
<P>
What really sets pine apart is its built-in text editor,
which looks and feels a lot more like word-processing programs
available for MS-DOS and Macintosh users.  Not only does it have
word wrap (a revolutionary concept if ever there was one), it also has a 
rwspell-checker and a search command. Best of all, all of the commands
you need are listed in a two-line mini-menu at the bottom of each
screen.  The commands look like this:
<P>
<PRE>
^W Where is
</PRE>
<P>
The little caret is a synonym for the key marked "control" on your
keyboard.  To find where a particular word is in your document, you'd
hit your control key and your W key at the same time, which would bring
up a prompt asking you for the word to look for.
<P>
Some of pine's commands are a tad peculiar (control-V for "page
down" for example), which comes from being based on a variant of
emacs (which is utterly peculiar).  But again, all of the commands you
need are listed on that two-line mini-menu, so it shouldn't take you
more than a couple of seconds to find the right one.
<P>
To use pine, type
<P>
<PRE>
pine
<A NAME="IDX136"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
at the command line and hit enter.  It's a relatively new program, so
many systems may not yet have it online.  But it's so easy to use, you
should probably send e-mail to your system administrator urging him to
get it!

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Smileys</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_47.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_49.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC51" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC51">Smileys</A></H2>
<P>
When you're involved in an online discussion, you can't see the
smiles or shrugs that the other person might make in a live
conversation to show he's only kidding.  But online, there's no body
language. So what you might think is funny, somebody else might take as
an insult.  To try to keep such misunderstandings from erupting into
bitter disputes, we have smileys.  Tilt your head to the left and look at
the following sideways. <CODE>:-)</CODE>.  Or simply <CODE>:)</CODE>.
This is your basic "smiley."
Use it to indicate people should not take that comment you just made as
seriously as they might otherwise.  You make a smiley by typing a colon,
a hyphen and a right parenthetical bracket. Some people prefer using the
<A NAME="IDX137"></A>
<A NAME="IDX138"></A>
word "grin," usually in this form:
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;grin&#62;
</PRE>
<P>
Sometimes, though, you'll see it as *grin* or even just &#60;g&#62; for short.
Some other smileys include:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>;-)</CODE>
<DD>Wink;
<P>
<DT><CODE>:-(</CODE>
<DD>Frown;
<P>
<DT><CODE>:-O</CODE>
<DD>Surprise;
<P>
<DT><CODE>8-)</CODE>
<DD>Wearing glasses;
<P>
<DT><CODE>=|:-)=</CODE>
<DD>Abe Lincoln.
</DL>
<P>
OK, so maybe the last two are a little bogus <CODE>:-)</CODE>, but for some
really fancy ones, see section <A HREF="bdg_290.html#SEC293">The Unofficial Smiley Dictionary</A>.

<H3><A NAME="SEC55" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC55">Bitnet</A></H3>
Users of Bitnet (and NetNorth in Canada and EARN in Europe) often 
have addresses in this form: <TT>&lt;IZZY@INDVMS&gt;</TT>.  If you're lucky, all you'll 
have to do to mail to that address is add "bitnet" at the end, to get 
<TT>&lt;izzy@indvms.bitnet&gt;</TT>.  Sometimes, however, mail to such an address will 
bounce back to you, because Bitnet addresses do not always translate 
well into an Internet form.  If this happens, you can send mail 
through one of two Internet/Bitnet gateways. First, change the <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> in 
the address to a <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>, so that you get <TT>&lt;user%site.bitnet&gt;</TT>.  Then add 
either <SAMP>`@vm.marist.edu'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`@cunyvm.cuny.edu'</SAMP>, so that, with the above 
example, you would get <TT>&lt;izzy%indyvms.bitnet@vm.marist.edu&gt;</TT> or 
<TT>&lt;izzy%indvyvms.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu&gt;</TT>
<P>
Bitnet users have it a little easier: They can usually send mail 
directly to your e-mail address without fooling around with it at all.  
So send them your address and they should be OK.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Fidonet</TITLE>

<A NAME="IDX144"></A>
<H3><A NAME="SEC58" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC58">Fidonet</A></H3>
To send mail to people using a Fidonet BBS, you need the name 
they use to log onto that system and its "node number."  Fidonet node 
numbers or addresses consist of three numbers, in this form: 
<SAMP>`1:322/190'</SAMP>.  The first number tells which of several broad geographic 
zones the BBS is in (1 represents the U.S. and Canada, 2 Europe and 
Israel, 3 Pacific Asia, 4 South America).  The second number 
represents the BBS's network, while the final number is the BBS's 
"FidoNode" number in that network. If your correspondent only gives 
you two numbers (for example, <SAMP>`322/190'</SAMP>), it means the system is
in zone 1.   
<P>
Now comes the tricky part. You have to reverse the numbers and 
add to them the letters <SAMP>`f'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`n'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`z'</SAMP> (which stand for 
"FidoNode," "network," and "zone'). For example, the address above 
would become 
<P>
<PRE>
f190.n322.
</PRE>
<P>
Now add <SAMP>`fidonet.org'</SAMP> at the end, to get 
<SAMP>`f190.n322. z1.fidonet.org'</SAMP>.<A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT3">(3)</A>
Then add <SAMP>`First Name.LastName@'</SAMP>, to get 
<P>
<PRE>
FirstName.LastName@f190.n322.z1.fidonet.org. 
</PRE>
<P>
Note the period between the first and last names. 
Whew! 
<P>
The reverse process is totally different. First, the person has 
to have access to his or her BBS's "net mail" area and know the 
Fidonet address of his or her local Fidonet/UUCP gateway (often their 
system operator will know it).  Your Fidonet correspondent should 
address a net-mail message to UUCP (not your name) in the "to:" field.  
In the node-number field, they should type in the node number of the 
Fidonet/UUCP gateway (if the gateway system is in the same regional 
network as their system, they need only type the last number, for 
example, <SAMP>`390'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`322/390'</SAMP>).
Then, the first line of the message 
has to be your Internet address, followed by a blank line.  After 
that, the person can write the message and send it.  
<P>
Because of the way Fidonet moves mail, it could take a day or two 
for a message to be delivered in either direction.  Also, because many 
Fidonet systems are run as hobbies, it is considered good form to ask 
the gateway sysop's permission if you intend to pass large amounts of 
mail back and forth. Messages of a commercial nature are strictly 
forbidden (even if it's something the other person asked for). Also, 
consider it very likely that somebody other than the recipient will 
read your messages.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Seven UNIX Commands</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_59.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_61.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC63" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC63">Seven UNIX Commands you can't live without:</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="bdg_61.html#SEC64">Wildcards</A>
</UL>
<P>
If you connect to the Net through a Unix system, eventually you'll
have to come to terms with Unix.  For better or worse, most Unix systems do
NOT shield you from their inner workings -- if you want to copy a Usenet
posting to a file, for example, you'll have to use some Unix commands if
you ever want to do anything with that file.
<P>
Like MS-DOS, Unix is an operating system - it tells the computer how
to do things.  Now while Unix may have a reputation as being even more
complex than MS-DOS, in most cases, a few basic, and simple, commands
should be all you'll ever need.
<P>
If your own computer uses MS-DOS or PC-DOS, the basic concepts will
seem very familiar -- but watch out for the cd command, which works
differently enough from the similarly named DOS command that it will drive
you crazy.  Also, unlike MS-DOS, Unix is case sensitive -- if you type
commands or directory names in the wrong case, you'll get an error message.
<P>
If you're used to working on a Mac, you'll have to remember that Unix
stores files in "directories" rather than "folders."  Unix directories are
organized like branches on a tree. At the bottom is the "root" directory,
with sub-directories branching off that (and sub-directories in turn can
have sub-directories). The Mac equivalent of a Unix sub-directory is a
folder within another folder.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX149"></A>
<DT><CODE>cat</CODE>
<DD>Equivalent to the MS-DOS "type" command.  To pause a file
every screen, type <SAMP>`cat file |more'</SAMP>, better: <SAMP>`more file'</SAMP>,
where "file" is the name of the file you want to see.
Hitting control-C will stop the display.  You can also use
<SAMP>`cat'</SAMP> for writing or uploading text files to your name or home
directory (similar to the MS-DOS <SAMP>`copy con:'</SAMP> command).  If you
type <SAMP>`cat &#62;test'</SAMP>
you start a file called "test".  You can either write
something simple (no editing once you've finished a line and
you have to hit return at the end of each line) or upload
something into that file using your communications software's
ASCII protocol).  To close the file, hit control-D.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX150"></A>
<DT><CODE>cd</CODE>
<DD>The "change directory" command.  To change from your present
directory to another, type <SAMP>`cd directory'</SAMP>
and hit enter. Unlike MS-DOS, which uses a \ to denote sub-directories
(for example: stuff\text), Unix uses a / (for
example: stuff/text).  So to change from your present
directory to the stuff/text sub-directory,  you would type
<SAMP>`cd stuff/text'</SAMP>
and then hit enter. As in MS-DOS, you do not need the first
backslash if the subdirectory comes off the directory you're
already in.  To move back up a directory tree, you would type
<SAMP>`cd ..'</SAMP>
followed by enter. Note the space between the <CODE>cd</CODE> and the two
periods -- this is where MS-DOS users will really go nuts.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX151"></A>
<DT><CODE>cp</CODE>
<DD>Copies a file. The syntax is
<SAMP>`cp file1 file2'</SAMP>
which would copy file1 to file2 (or overwrite file2 with
file1).
<P>
<A NAME="IDX152"></A>
<DT><CODE>ls</CODE>
<DD>This command, when followed by enter, tells you what's in the
directory, similar to the DOS <CODE>dir</CODE> command, except in
alphabetical order.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX153"></A>
<DT><CODE>ls |more</CODE>
<DD>will stop the listing every 24 lines -- handy if there are a
lot of things in the directory. The basic ls command does not
list "hidden" files, such as the <TT>`.login'</TT> file that controls
how your system interacts with Unix. To see these files, type
<SAMP>`ls -a'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`ls -a |more'</SAMP>
<P>
<SAMP>`ls -l'</SAMP> will tell you the size of each file in bytes and tell
you when each was created or modified.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX154"></A>
<DT><CODE>mv</CODE>
<DD>Similar to the MS-DOS rename command. In fact,
<SAMP>`mv file1 file2'</SAMP>
will rename file1 as file2, The command can 
also be used to move files between directories.
<P>
<SAMP>`mv file1 News'</SAMP>
would move file1 to your News directory.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX155"></A>
<DT><CODE>rm</CODE>
<DD>Deletes a file.  Type
<SAMP>`rm filename'</SAMP>
and hit enter (but beware: when you hit enter, it's gone for
good).

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - When things go wrong II</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_61.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_63.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC65" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC65">When things go wrong:</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI>
You send a message but get back an ominous looking message from
MAILER-DAEMON containing up to several dozen lines of computerese
followed by your message.
<P>
Somewhere in those lines you can often find a clue to what went 
wrong.  You might have made a mistake in spelling the e-mail address.  
The site to which you're sending mail might have been down for 
maintenance or a problem. You may have used the wrong "translation" for 
mail to a non-Internet network. 
<P>
<LI>
You call up your host system's text editor to write a message or
reply to one and can't seem to get out.
<P>
If it's emacs, try control-X, control-C (in other words, hit your
control key and your X key at the same time, followed by control and C).
If worse comes to worse, you can hang up.
<P>
<LI>
In Elm, you accidentally hit the D key for a message you want to
save.  Type the number of the message, hit enter and then U, which will
"un-delete" the message.  This works only before you exit Elm; once you
quit, the message is gone.
<P>
<LI>
You try to upload an ASCII message you've written on your own
computer into a message you're preparing in Elm or Pine and you get a
lot of left brackets, capital Ms, Ks and Ls and some funny-looking
characters.
<P>
Believe it or not, your message will actually wind up looking
fine; all that garbage is temporary and reflects the problems some Unix
text processors have with ASCII uploads.  But it will take much longer
for your upload to finish.  One way to deal with this is to call up the
simple mail program, which will not produce any weird characters when you
upload a text file into a message.  Another way (which is better if your
prepared message is a response to somebody's mail), is to create a text
file on your host system with cat, for example,
<P>
<PRE>
cat &#62;file
</PRE>
<P>
and then upload your text into that.  Then, in Elm or Pine, you can insert
the message with a simple command (control-R in Pine, for example); only
this time you won't see all that extraneous stuff.

<H2><A NAME="SEC68" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC68">The Global Watering Hole</A></H2>
<P>
Imagine a conversation carried out over a period of hours and days,
as if people were leaving messages and responses on a bulletin board.  Or 
imagine the electronic equivalent of a radio talk show where everybody 
can put their two cents in and no one is ever on hold. 
<P>
<A NAME="IDX160"></A>
<A NAME="IDX161"></A>
Unlike e-mail, which is usually "one-to-one,"  Usenet is "many-to-many."
Usenet is the international meeting place, where people gather to meet 
their friends, discuss the day's events, keep up with computer trends or 
talk about whatever's on their mind.  Jumping into a Usenet discussion 
can be a liberating experience.  Nobody knows what you look or sound 
like, how old you are, what your background is.  You're judged solely on 
your words, your ability to make a point. 
<P>
To many people, Usenet IS the Net. In fact, it is often confused
with Internet.  But it is a totally separate system. All Internet sites
CAN carry Usenet, but so do many non-Internet sites, from sophisticated
<A NAME="IDX162"></A>
<A NAME="IDX163"></A>
<A NAME="IDX164"></A>
Unix machines to old XT clones and Apple IIs. 
<P>
Technically, Usenet messages are shipped around the world, from
host system to host system, using one of several specific Net
protocols.  Your host system stores all of its Usenet messages in one
place, which everybody with an account on the system can access. That
way, no matter how many people actually read a given message, each
host system has to store only one copy of it. Many host systems "talk"
with several others regularly in case one or another of their links goes
down for some reason.  When two host systems connect, they basically
compare notes on which Usenet messages they already have.  Any that one
is missing the other then transmits, and vice-versa.  Because they are
computers, they don't mind running through thousands, even millions, of
these comparisons every day.
<P>
Yes, millions.  For Usenet is huge.  Every day, Usenet users
pump upwards of 40 million characters a day into the system -- roughly 
the equivalent of volumes A-G of the Encyclopedia Britannica. Obviously, 
nobody could possibly keep up with this immense flow of messages.  Let's 
<A NAME="IDX165"></A>
look at how to find conferences and discussions of interest to you.
<P>
The basic building block of Usenet is the newsgroup, which is a
collection of messages with a related theme (on other networks, these
would be called conferences, forums, boards or special-interest
groups).  There are now more than 5,000 of these newsgroups, in several 
diferent languages, covering everything from art to zoology, from 
science fiction to South Africa.
<P>
Some public-access systems, typically the ones that work through 
menus, try to make it easier by dividing Usenet into several broad 
categories.  Choose one of those and you're given a list of newsgroups in 
that category.  Then select the newsgroup you're interested in and start 
reading. 
<P>
Other systems let you compile your own "reading list" so that you
only see messages in conferences you want.  In both cases, conferences
are arranged in a particular hierarchy devised in the early 1980s.
Newsgroup names start with one of a series of broad topic names.  For 
example, newsgroups beginning with "comp." are about particular
computer-related topics.  These broad topics are followed by a series of
more focused topics (so that <TT>comp.unix</TT> groups are limited to
<A NAME="IDX166"></A>
discussion about Unix).  The main hierarchies are:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>bionet</CODE>
<DD>Research biology
<P>
<DT><CODE>bit.listserv</CODE>
<DD>Conferences originating as Bitnet mailing lists

<P>
<DT><CODE>news</CODE>
<DD>News about Usenet itself
<P>
<DT><CODE>rec</CODE>
<DD>Hobbies, games and recreation
<P>
<DT><CODE>sci</CODE>
<DD>Science other than research biology
<P>
<DT><CODE>soc</CODE>
<DD>"Social" groups, often ethnically related
<P>
<DT><CODE>talk</CODE>
<DD>Politics and related topics
<P>
<DT><CODE>alt</CODE>
<DD>Controversial or unusual topics; not carried by all sites
</DL>
<P>
In addition, many host systems carry newsgroups for a particular
city, state or region.  For example, <TT>ne.housing</TT> is a newsgroup where
New Englanders look for apartments.  A growing number also carry K12
newsgroups, which are aimed at elementary and secondary teachers and
students.  And a number of sites carry clari newsgroups, which is
actually a commercial service consisting of wire-service stories and
a unique online computer news service (see section <A HREF="bdg_218.html#SEC221">News of the World</A>).

<P>
How do you dive right in?  As mentioned, on some systems, it's all 
done through menus -- you just keep choosing from a list of choices until 
you get to the newsgroup you want and then hit the "read" command.  On 
Unix systems, however, you will have to use a "newsreader" program.  Two 
of the more common ones are known as rn (for "read news") and nn (for
<A NAME="IDX167"></A>
<A NAME="IDX168"></A>
"no news" -- because it's supposed to be simpler to use). 
<P>
For beginners, nn may be the better choice because it works with
menus -- you get a list of articles in a given newsgroup and then you 
choose which ones you want to see.  To try it out, connect to your host 
system and, at the command line, type 
<P>
<PRE>
nn news.announce.newusers
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  After a few seconds, you should see something like
this:

</PRE>
<P>
Obviously, this is a good newsgroup to begin your exploration of
Usenet!  Here's what all this means:  The first letter on each line is
the letter you type to read that particular "article" (it makes sense
that a "newsgroup" would have "articles").  Next comes the name of the
person who wrote that article, followed by its length, in lines, and
what the article is about. At the bottom, you see the local time at your
access site, what you're doing right now (i.e., SELECTing articles),
which key to hit for some help (the ? key) and how many of the articles
in the newsgroup you can see on this screen. The "(moderated)" means the
newsgroup has a "moderator" who is the only one who can directly post
messages to it.  This is generally limited to groups such as this, which
contain articles of basic information, or for digests, which are
basically online magazines (more on them in a bit).
<P>
Say you're particularly interested in what "Emily Postnews"
(see section <A HREF="bdg_266.html#SEC269">Dear Emily Postnews</A>) has to
say about proper etiquette on Usenet. Hit your c key (lower case!), and
the line will light up.  If you want to read something else, hit the key
that corresponds to it.  And if you want to see what's on the next page
of articles, hit return or your space bar.
<P>
But you're impatient to get going, and you want to read that
article now.  The command for that in nn is a capital Z.  Hit it and
you'll see something like this:

**NOTE: this is intended to be satirical.  If you do not recognize
it as such, consult a doctor or professional comedian.  The
recommendations in this article should recognized for what
they are -- admonitions about what NOT to do.


"Dear Emily Postnews"

Emily Postnews, foremost authority on proper net behaviour,
gives her advice on how to act on the net.

=========================================================================

Dear Miss Postnews: How long should my signature be? -- verbose@noisy

A: Dear Verbose: Please try and make your signature as long as you
-- 09:57 --.announce.newusers-- LAST --help:?--Top 4%--
</PRE>
<P>
The first few lines are the message's header, similar to the header
you get in e-mail messages.  Then comes the beginning of the message.
The last line tells you the time again, the newsgroup name (or part of
it, anyway), the position in your message stack that this message
occupies, how to get help, and how much of the message is on screen.  If
you want to keep reading this message, just hit your space bar (not your
enter key!) for the next screen and so on until done. When done, you'll
be returned to the newsgroup menu.  For now hit Q (upper case this time),
which quits you out of nn and returns you to your host system's command
line.
<P>
To get a look at another interesting newsgroup, type
<P>
<PRE>
nn comp.risks
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  This newsgroup is another moderated group, this time a
digest of all the funny and frightening ways computers and the people
who run and use them can go wrong.  Again, you read articles by
selecting their letters.  If you're in the middle of an article and
decide you want to go onto the next one, hit your n key.
<P>
Now it's time to look for some newsgroups that might be of
particular interest to you.  Unix host systems that have nn use a program
called nngrep (ever get the feeling Unix was not entirely written in
English?) that lets you scan newsgroups.  Exit nn and at your host
system's command line, type
<P>
<PRE>
nngrep word
<A NAME="IDX169"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
where word is the subject you're interested in.  If you use a Macintosh
computer, you might try
<P>
<PRE>
nngrep mac
</PRE>
<P>
You'll get something that looks like this:
<P>
<PRE>
alt.music.machines.of.loving.grace
alt.religion.emacs
comp.binaries.mac
comp.emacs
comp.lang.forth.mac
comp.os.mach
comp.sources.mac
comp.sys.mac.announce
comp.sys.mac.apps
comp.sys.mac.comm
comp.sys.mac.databases
comp.sys.mac.digest
comp.sys.mac.games
comp.sys.mac.hardware
comp.sys.mac.hypercard
comp.sys.mac.misc
comp.sys.mac.programmer
comp.sys.mac.system
comp.sys.mac.wanted
gnu.emacs.announce
gnu.emacs.bug
gnu.emacs.gnews
gnu.emacs.gnus
gnu.emacs.help
gnu.emacs.lisp.manual
gnu.emacs.sources
gnu.emacs.vm.bug
gnu.emacs.vm.info
gnu.emacs.vms
</PRE>
<P>
Note that some of these obviously have something to do with
Macintoshes while some obviously do not; nngrep is not a perfect system.
If you want to get a list of ALL the newsgroups available on your host
system, type
<P>
<PRE>
nngrep -a |more
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
nngrep -a |pg
<A NAME="IDX170"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter (which one to use depends on the Unix used on your host
system; if one doesn't do anything, try the other). You don't
absolutely need the |more or |pg, but if you don't include it, the list
will keep scrolling, rather than pausing every 24 lines.  If you are in
nn, hitting a capital Y will bring up a similar list.
<P>
Typing <SAMP>`nn newsgroup'</SAMP> for every newsgroup can get awfully tiring
after awhile.  When you use nn, your host system looks in a file called
<TT>`.newsrc'</TT>.  This is basically a list of every newsgroup on the host system
along with notations on which groups and articles you have read (all
maintained by the computer).  You can also use this file to create a
"reading list" that brings up each newsgroup to which you want to
<A NAME="IDX171"></A>
<A NAME="IDX172"></A>
"subscribe."  To try it out, type
<P>
<PRE>
nn
</PRE>
<P>
without any newsgroup name, and hit enter.
<P>
Unfortunately, you will start out with a <TT>`.newsrc'</TT> file that has you
"subscribed" to every single newsgroup on your host system!  To delete
a newsgroup from your reading list, type a capital U while its menu is
on the screen.  The computer will ask you if you're sure you want to
"unsubscribe."  If you then hit a Y, you'll be unsubscribed and put in
the next group.
<P>
With many host systems carrying thousands of newsgroups, this will 
take you forever.
<P>
Fortunately, there are a couple of easier ways to do this.  Both
involve calling up your <TT>`.newsrc'</TT> file in a word or text processor.  In a
<TT>`.newsrc'</TT> file, each newsgroup takes up one line, consisting of the
group's name, an exclamation point or a colon and a range of numbers.
<P>
Newsgroups with a colon are ones to which you are subscribed; those 
followed by an exclamation point are "un-subscribed."  To start with a 
clean slate, then, you have to change all those colons to exclamation 
points.
If you know some UNIX, it's a one-liner, just type:
<P>
<PRE>
tr ':' '!' &#60; .newsrc &#62; temprc
</PRE>
<P>
and you're done. Without the <CODE>tr</CODE> command you must use a text
<A NAME="IDX173"></A>
editor.
<P>
If you know how to use emacs or vi, call up the <TT>`.newsrc'</TT> file (you
might want to make a copy of <TT>`.newsrc'</TT> first, just in case), and use the
<A NAME="IDX174"></A>
<A NAME="IDX175"></A>
search-and-replace function to make the change.
<P>
If you're not comfortable with these text processors, you can
download the <TT>`.newsrc'</TT> file, make the changes on your own computer and
then upload the revised file.  Before you download the file, however,
you should do a couple of things.  One is to type
<P>
<PRE>
cp .newsrc temprc
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You will actually download this temprc file (note the
name does not start with a period -- some computers, such as those using
MS-DOS, do not allow file names starting with periods).  After you
download the file, open it in your favorite word processor and use its
search-and-replace function to change the exclamation points to colons.
Be careful not to change anything else!  Save the document in ASCII or
text format.  Dial back into your host system.  At the command line,
type
<P>
<PRE>
cp temprc temprc1
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  This new file will serve as your backup <TT>`.newsrc'</TT> file
just in case something goes wrong. Upload the temprc file from your
computer.  This will overwrite the Unix system's old temprc file.  Now
type
<P>
<PRE>
cp temprc .newsrc
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You now have a clean slate to start creating a reading
list.

The first thing to understand about Usenet is that it is widely
misunderstood.  Every day on Usenet, the "blind men and the elephant"
phenomenon is evident, in spades.  In my opinion, more flame wars
arise because of a lack of understanding of the nature of Usenet than
from any other source.  And consider that such flame wars arise, of
necessity, among people who are on Usenet.  Imagine, then, how poorly
understood Usenet must be by those outside!

</PRE>
<P>
This time, the header looks much more like the gobbledygook you get 
in e-mail messages.  To keep reading, hit your space bar.  If you hit
your n key (lower case), you'll go to the next message in the 
numerical order.
<P>
To escape rn, just keep hitting your q key (in lower case), until
you get back to the command line.  Now let's set up your reading list.
Because rn uses the same <TT>`.newsrc'</TT> file as nn, you can use one of the
search-and-replace methods described above.  Or you can do this:  Type
<P>
<PRE>
rn
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  When the first newsgroup comes up on your screen, hit
your u key (in lower case).  Hit it again, and again, and again.  Or
just keep it pressed down (if your computer starts beeping, let up for a
couple of seconds).  Eventually, you'll be told you're at the end of the 
newsgroups, and asked what you want to do next.  
<P>
Here's where you begin entering newsgroups.  Type
<P>
<PRE>
g newsgroup
</PRE>
<P>
(for example, <SAMP>`g comp.sys.mac.announce'</SAMP>) and hit enter.  You'll be asked
if you want to "subscribe." Hit your y key.  Then type
<P>
<PRE>
g next newsgroup
</PRE>
<P>
(for example, <SAMP>`g comp.announce.newusers'</SAMP>) and hit enter.  Repeat until
done.  This process will also set up your reading list for nn, if you
prefer that newsreader. But how do you know which newsgroups to
subscribe?  Typing a lowercase l and then hitting enter will show you a 
list of all available newsgroups.  Again, since there could be more than
2,000 newsgroups on your system, this might not be something you want to
do.  Fortunately, you can search for groups with particular words in
their names, using the l command.  Typing
<P>
<PRE>
l mac
</PRE>
<P>
followed by enter, will bring up a list of newsgroups with those letters
in them (and as in nn, you will also see groups dealing with emacs and
the like, in addition to groups related to Macintosh computers).
<P>
Because of the vast amount of messages transmitted over Usenet,
most systems carry messages for only a few days or weeks.  So if there's
a message you want to keep, you should either turn on your computer's
screen capture or save it to a file which you can later download).  To
save a message as a file in rn, type
<P>
<PRE>
s filename
</PRE>
<P>
where filename is what you want to call the file. Hit enter.  You'll be
asked if you want to save it in "mailbox format."  In most cases, you
can answer with an n (which will strip off the header).  The message
will now be saved to a file in your News directory (which you can access
<A NAME="IDX178"></A>
<A NAME="IDX179"></A>
by typing <SAMP>`cd News'</SAMP> and then hitting enter).
<P>
Also, some newsgroups fill up particularly quickly -- go away for a
couple of days and you'll come back to find hundreds of articles!  One
way to deal with that is to mark them as "read" so that they no longer
appear on your screen.  In nn, hit a capital J; in rn, a small c.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - rn Commands</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_68.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_70.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC72" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC72">rn Commands</A></H2>
<P>
Different commands are available to you in rn depending on whether you
are already in a newsgroup or reading a specific article. At any point,
typing a lowercase <SAMP>`h'</SAMP> will bring up a list of available commands
<A NAME="IDX180"></A>
and some terse instructions for using them. Here are some of them:
<P>
After you've just called up rn, or within a newsgroup:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>c</CODE>
<DD>Marks every article in a newsgroup as read (or "caught up")
so that you don't have to see them again. The system will ask
you if you are sure. Can be done either when asked if you
want to read a particular newsgroup or once in the newsgroup.
<P>
<DT><CODE>g</CODE>
<DD>Goes to a newsgroup, in this form:
<P>
<DT><CODE>g news.group</CODE>
<DD><P>
Use this both for going to groups to which you're already
subscribed and subscribing to new groups.
<P>
<DT><CODE>h</CODE>
<DD>Provides a list of available commands with terse
instructions.
<P>
<DT><CODE>l</CODE>
<DD>Gives a list of all available newsgroups.
<P>
<DT><CODE>p</CODE>
<DD>Goes to the first previous subscribed newsgroup with un-read
articles.
<P>
<DT><CODE>q</CODE>
<DD>Quits, or exits, rn if you have not yet gone into a newsgroup.
If you are in a newsgroup, it quits that one and brings you to
the next subscribed newsgroup.
</DL>
<P>
Only within a newsgroup:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>=</CODE>
<DD>Gives a list of all available articles in the newsgroup.
<P>
<DT><CODE>m</CODE>
<DD>Marks a specific article or series of articles as "un-read"
again so that you can come back to them later. Typing
<SAMP>`1700m'</SAMP> and hitting enter would mark just that article as un-read.
Typing <SAMP>`1700-1800m'</SAMP>
and hitting enter would mark all of those articles as un-read.
<P>
<DT><CODE>s file</CODE>
<DD>Copies the current article to a file in your News directory,
where "file" is the name of the file you want to save it to.
You'll be asked if you want to use "mailbox" format when
saving. If you answer by hitting your <SAMP>`N'</SAMP> key, most of the
header will not be saved.
<P>
<DT><CODE>space</CODE>
<DD>Brings up the next page of article listings.  If already on
the last page, displays the first article in the newsgroup.
<P>
<DT><CODE>u</CODE>
<DD>Un-subscribe from the newsgroup.
<P>
<DT><CODE>/text/</CODE>
<DD>Searches through the newsgroup for articles with a specific
word or phrase in the "Subject:" line, from the current
article to the end of the newsgroup. For example,
<P>
<DT><CODE>/EFF/</CODE>
<DD>would bring you to the first article with "EFF" in the
"Subject:" line.
<P>
<DT><CODE>?text?</CODE>
<DD>The same as <SAMP>`/text/'</SAMP> except it searches in reverse order from 
the current article.
</DL>
<P>
Only within a specific article:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>C</CODE>
<DD>If you post an article and then decide it was a mistake, call
it up on your host system and hit this.  The message will soon
begin disappearing on systems around the world.
<P>
<DT><CODE>F</CODE>
<DD>Post a public response in the newsgroup to the current
article.  Includes a copy of her posting, which you can then
edit down using your host system's text editor.
<P>
<DT><CODE>f</CODE>
<DD>The same as above except it does not include a copy of the
original message in yours.
<P>
<DT><CODE>m</CODE>
<DD>Marks the current article as "un-read" so that you can come
back to it later.  You do not have to type the article
number.
<P>
<DT><CODE>Control-N</CODE>
<DD>Brings up the first response to the article. If there is no
follow-up article, this returns you to the first unread article
in the newsgroup).
<P>
<DT><CODE>Control-P</CODE>
<DD>Goes to the message to which the current article is a reply.
<P>
<DT><CODE>n</CODE>
<DD>Goes to the next unread article in the newsgroup.
<P>
<DT><CODE>N</CODE>
<DD>Takes you to the next article in the newsgroup even if you've
already read it.
<P>
<DT><CODE>q</CODE>
<DD>Quits, or exits, the current article. Leaves you in the current
newsgroup.
<P>
<DT><CODE>R</CODE>
<DD>Reply, via e-mail only, to the author of the current article.
Includes a copy of his message in yours.
<P>
<DT><CODE>r</CODE>
<DD>The same as above, except it does not include a copy of his
article.
<P>
<DT><CODE>s |mail user</CODE>
<DD>Mails a copy of the article to somebody. For "user" substitute
an e-mail address. Does not let you add comments to the
message first, however.
<P>
<DT><CODE>space</CODE>
<DD>Hitting the space bar shows the next page of the article, or, if
at the end, goes to the next un-read article.

<P>
With so much to choose from, everybody will likely have their own 
unique Usenet reading list.  But there are a few newsgroups that are 
particularly of interest to newcomers.  Among them:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<TT>news.announce.newusers</TT>
This group consists of a series of
articles that explain various facets of
Usenet.
<P>
<TT>news.newusers.questions</TT>
This is where you can ask questions 
(we'll see how in a bit) about how
Usenet works.
<P>
<TT>news.announce.newsgroups</TT>
Look here for information about new or
proposed newsgroups.
<P>
<TT>news.answers</TT>
Contains lists of "Frequently Asked
Questions"  (FAQs) and their answers from 
many different newsgroups.  Learn how to
fight jet lag in the FAQ from 
<TT>rec.travel.air</TT>; look up answers to common
questions about Microsoft Windows in
an FAQ from <TT>comp.os.ms-windows</TT>; etc.
<P>
<TT>alt.internet.services</TT>
Looking for something in particular on 
the Internet?  Ask here.
<P>
<TT>alt.infosystems.announce</TT>
People adding new information services to
the Internet will post details here.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Speaking up</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_70.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_72.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC74" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC74">Speaking up</A></H2>
<P>
"Threads" are an integral part of Usenet.  When somebody posts a
message, often somebody else will respond.  Soon, a thread of
conversation begins.  Following these threads is relatively easy.  In
nn, related messages are grouped together.  In rn, when you're done
with a message, you can hit control-N to read the next related
message, or followup.  As you explore Usenet, it's probably a good
idea to read discussions for a while before you jump in.  This way, you 
can get a feel for the particular newsgroup -- each has its 
<A NAME="IDX182"></A>
own rhythms.
<P>
Eventually, though, you'll want to speak up.  There are two main
ways to do this.  You join an existing conversation, or you can start
a whole new thread.
<P>
If you want to join a discussion, you have to decide if you want
to include portions of the message you are responding to in your
message.  The reason to do this is so people can see what you're
responding to, just in case the original message has disappeared from
their system (remember that most Usenet messages have a short life span 
on the average host system) or they can't find it.
<P>
If you're using a Unix host system, joining an existing
conversation is similar in both nn and rn: hit your F key when done
with a given article in the thread.  In rn, type a small f if you
don't want to include portions of the message you're responding to; an
uppercase F if you do. In nn, type a capital F.  You'll then be asked
if you want to include portions of the original message.
<P>
And here's where you hit another Unix wall.  When you hit your F
key, your host system calls up its basic Unix text editor.  If you're
lucky, that'll be Pico, a very easy system.  More likely, however,
you'll get dumped into emacs (or possibly vi), which you've already met
<A NAME="IDX183"></A>
<A NAME="IDX184"></A>
in the chapter on e-mail.
<P>
The single most important emacs command is
<P>
<PRE>
control-x control-c
</PRE>
<P>
This means, depress your control key and hit x.  Then depress the
control key and hit c.  Memorize this.  In fact, it's so important, it
bears repeating:
<P>
<PRE>
control-x control-c
</PRE>
<P>
These keystrokes are how you get out of emacs.  If they work well,
you'll be asked if you want to send, edit, abort or list the message you
were working on.  If they don't work well (say you accidentally hit some
other weird key combination that means something special to emacs) and
nothing seems to happen, or you just get more weird-looking emacs
prompts on the bottom of your screen, try hitting control-g. This should
stop whatever emacs was trying to do (you should see the word "quit" on
the bottom of your screen), after which you can hit control-x control-c.
But if this still doesn't work, remember that you can always disconnect
and dial back in!
<P>
If you have told your newsreader you do want to include portions
of the original message in yours, it will automatically put the entire
thing at the top of your message.  Use the arrow keys to move down to
the lines you want to delete and hit control-K, which will delete one
line at a time.
<P>
You can then write your message.  Remember that you have to hit
enter before your cursor gets to the end of the line, because emacs
does not have word wrapping.
<P>
When done, hit control-X control-C.  You'll be asked the
question about sending, editing, aborting, etc.  Chose one.  If you
hit Y, your host system will start the process to sending your
message across the Net.
<P>
The nn and rn programs work differently when it comes to posting
entirely new messages.  In nn, type
<P>
<PRE>
:post
<A NAME="IDX185"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter in any newsgroup.  You'll be asked which newsgroup to
post a message to.  Type in its name and hit enter.  Then you'll be
asked for "keywords."  These are words you'd use to attract somebody
scanning a newsgroup.  Say you're selling your car.  You might type
the type of car here.  Next comes a "summary" line, which is somewhat
similar.  Finally, you'll be asked for the message's "distribution."
This is where you put how widely you want your message disseminated.
Think about this one for a second.  If you are selling your car, it
makes little sense to send a message about it all over the world.  But
if you want to talk about the environment, it might make a lot of
sense.  Each host system has its own set of distribution
classifications, but there's generally a local one (just for users of
that system), one for the city, state or region it's in, another for
the country (for example, usa), one for the continent (for Americans
and Canadians, na) and finally, one for the entire world (usually:
world).
<P>
Which one to use?  Generally, a couple of seconds' thought will
help you decide.  If you're selling your car, use your city or regional
distribution -- people in Australia won't much care and may even get
annoyed.  If you want to discuss presidential politics, using a USA
distribution makes more sense.  If you want to talk about events in the
Middle East, sending your message to the entire world is perfectly
acceptable.
<P>
Then you can type your message.  If you've composed your message
offline (generally a good idea if you and emacs don't get along), you
can upload it now.  You may see a lot of weird looking characters as
it uploads into emacs, but those will disappear when you hit control-X
and then control-C.  Alternately: "save" the message (for example, by 
hitting m in rn), log out, compose your message offline, log back on and 
upload your message into a file on your host system.  Then call up 
Usenet, find the article you "saved." Start a reply, and you'll be asked 
if you want to include a prepared message.  Type in the name of the file 
you just created and hit enter.
<P>
In rn, you have to wait until you get to the end of a newsgroup
to hit F, which will bring up a message-composing system.
Alternately, at your host system's command line, you can type
<P>
<PRE>
Pnews
<A NAME="IDX186"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You'll be prompted somewhat similarly to the nn
system, except that you'll be given a list of possible distributions.
If you chose "world," you'll get this message:
<P>
This program posts news to thousands of machines throughout the entire
civilized world.  Your message will cost the net hundreds if not thousands of
dollars to send everywhere.  Please be sure you know what you are doing.
<P>
<EM>Are you absolutely sure that you want to do this? [ny]</EM>
<P>
Don't worry -- your message won't really cost the Net untold
amounts, although, again, it's a good idea to think for a second
whether your message really should go everywhere.
<P>
If you want to respond to a given post through e-mail, instead of
publicly, hit R in nn or r or R in rn.  In rn, as with follow-up
articles, the uppercase key includes the original message in yours.
<P>
Most newsgroups are unmoderated, which means that every message
you post will eventually wind up on every host system within the
geographic region you specified that carries that newsgroup.
<P>
Some newsgroups, however, are moderated, as you saw earlier with
<TT>comp.risks</TT>.  In these groups, messages are shipped to a single
location where a moderator, acting much like a magazine editor,
decides what actually gets posted.  In some cases, groups are
moderated like scholarly journals.  In other cases, it's to try to cut
down on the massive number of messages that might otherwise be posted.
<P>
You'll notice that many articles in Usenet end with a fancy
"signature" that often contains some witty saying, a clever drawing
and, almost incidentally, the poster's name and e-mail address.  You
too can have your own "signature" automatically appended to everything
you post.  On your own computer, create a signature file.  Try to keep
it to four lines or less, lest you annoy others on the Net.  Then,
while connected to your host system, type
<P>
<PRE>
cat &#62;.signature
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter (note the period before the s).  Upload your signature
file into this using your communications software's ASCII upload
protocol.  When done, hit control-D, the Unix command for closing a
file.  Now, every time you post a message, this will be appended to it.
<P>
There are a few caveats to posting.  Usenet is no different from
a Town Meeting or publication: you're not supposed to break the law,
whether that's posting copyrighted material or engaging in illegal
activities.  It is also not a place to try to sell products (except in
certain <TT>biz.*</TT> and explicit for-sale newsgroups).

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Cross-posting</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_71.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_73.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC75" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC75">Cross-posting</A></H2>
<P>
Sometimes, you'll have an issue you think should be discussed in
more than one newsgroup.  Rather than posting individual messages in
each group, you can post the same message in several groups at once,
through a process known as cross-posting.
<P>
Say you want to start a discussion about the political
ramifications of importing rare tropical fish from Brazil.  People who
read <TT>rec.aquaria</TT> might have something to say. So might people who read
<TT>alt.politics.animals</TT> and
<A NAME="IDX187"></A>
<TT>talk.politics.misc</TT>.
<P>
Cross-posting is easy.  It also should mean that people on other 
systems who subscribe to several newsgroups will see your message only 
once, rather than several times -- news-reading software can cancel out 
the other copies once a person has read the message.  When you get ready 
to post a message (whether through Pnews for rn or the <SAMP>`:post'</SAMP> command in 
nn), you'll be asked in which newsgroups.  Type the names of the various 
groups, separated by a comma, but no space, for example: 
<P>
<PRE>
rec.aquaria,alt.politics.animals,talk.politics.misc
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  After answering the other questions (geographic
distribution, etc.), the message will be posted in the various
groups (unless one of the groups is moderated, in which case the
message goes to the moderator, who decides whether to make it public).
<P>
It's considered bad form to post to an excessive number of
newsgroups, or inappropriate newsgroups.  Probably, you don't really have 
to post something in 20 different places.  And while you may think your 
particular political issue is vitally important to the fate of the world, 
chances are the readers of <TT>rec.arts.comics</TT> will not, or at least not 
important enough to impose on them.  You'll get a lot of nasty e-mail 
messages demanding you restrict your messages to the "appropriate" 
newsgroups. 
<P>

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Flame and Blather and Spew</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_73.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_75.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC77" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC77">Flame, Blather and Spew</A></H2>
<P>
Something about online communications seems to make some people
particularly irritable.  Perhaps it's the immediacy and semi-anonymity
of it all.  Whatever it is, there are whole classes of people you will
soon think seem to exist to make you miserable.
<P>
Rather than pausing and reflecting on a message as one might do
with a letter received on paper, it's just so easy to hit your R key
and tell somebody you don't really know what you really think of them.
Even otherwise calm people sometimes find themselves turning into
raving lunatics.  When this happens, flames erupt.  
<P>
A flame is a particularly nasty, personal attack on somebody for 
something he or she has written.  Periodically, an exchange of flames 
erupts into a flame war that begin to take up all the space in a given 
newsgroup (and sometimes several; flamers like cross-posting to let the 
world know how they feel).  These can go on for weeks (sometimes they go 
on for years, in which case they become "holy wars," usually on such 
topics as the relative merits of Macintoshes and IBMs).  Often, just when 
they're dying down, somebody new to the flame war reads all the messages, 
gets upset and issues an urgent plea that the flame war be taken to e-mail
so everybody else can get back to whatever the newsgroup's business 
is.  All this usually does, though, is start a brand new flame war, in 
which this poor person comes under attack for daring to question the 
First Amendment, prompting others to jump on the attackers for impugning 
<A NAME="IDX188"></A>
<A NAME="IDX189"></A>
<A NAME="IDX190"></A>
<A NAME="IDX191"></A>
<A NAME="IDX192"></A>
this poor soul...  You get the idea. 
<P>
Every so often, a discussion gets so out of hand that somebody
predicts that either the government will catch on and shut the whole
thing down or somebody will sue to close down the network, or maybe
even the wrath of God will smote everybody involved.  This brings what
has become an inevitable rejoinder from others who realize that the
network is, in fact, a resilient creature that will not die easily:
<EM>"Imminent death of Usenet predicted. Film at 11."</EM>
<P>
Flame wars can be tremendously fun to watch at first.  They
quickly grow boring, though.  And wait until the first time you're
attacked!
<P>
<A NAME="IDX193"></A>
<A NAME="IDX194"></A>
<A NAME="IDX195"></A>
<EM>Flamers</EM> are not the only <B>Net.characters</B> to watch out for.
<P>
<EM>Spewers</EM> assume that whatever they are particularly concerned about
either really is of universal interest or should be rammed down the
<A NAME="IDX196"></A>
throats of people who don't seem to care -- as frequently as possible.
<P>
You can usually tell a spewer's work by the number of articles he posts 
in a day on the same subject and the number of newsgroups to which he 
then sends these articles -- both can reach well into double digits. 
Often, these messages relate to various ethnic conflicts around the 
world. Frequently, there is no conceivable connection between the issue 
at hand and most of the newsgroups to which he posts.  No matter.  If you 
try to point this out in a response to one of these messages, you will be 
inundated with angry messages that either accuse you of being an 
insensitive racist/American/whatever or ignore your point entirely to
bring up several hundred more lines of commentary on the perfidy of
whoever it is the spewer thinks is out to destroy his people.
<P>
Closely related to these folks are the Holocaust revisionists, who
periodically inundate certain groups (such as <TT>soc.history</TT>) with long
rants about how the Holocaust never really happened.  Some people
attempt to refute these people with facts, but others realize this only
<A NAME="IDX197"></A>
encourages them.
<P>
<EM>Blatherers</EM> tend to be more benign.  Their problem is that they
just can't get to the point -- they can wring three or four screenfuls
out of a thought that others might sum up in a sentence or two.  A
related condition is excessive quoting.  People afflicted with this will
include an entire message in their reply rather than excising the
portions not relevant to whatever point they're trying to make.  The
<A NAME="IDX198"></A>
worst quote a long message and then add a single line:
<P>
"I agree!" or some such, often followed by a monster .signature
(see section <A HREF="bdg_81.html#SEC84">Big Sig</A>).
There are a number of other Usenet denizens you'll soon come to
recognize.  Among them:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>
<DT><B>Net.weenies</B>
<DD>These are the kind of people who enjoy Insulting
others, the kind of people who post nasty messages in a sewing
newsgroup just for the hell of it.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX200"></A>
<DT><B>Net.geeks</B>
<DD>People to whom the Net is Life, who worry about what
happens when they graduate and they lose their free, 24-hour access.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX201"></A>
<DT><B>Net.gods</B>
<DD>The old-timers; the true titans of the Net and the
keepers of its collective history. They were around when the Net
consisted of a couple of computers tied together with baling wire.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX202"></A>
<DT><B>Lurkers</B>
<DD>Actually, you can't tell these people are there, but
they are.  They're the folks who read a newsgroup but never post or
respond.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX203"></A>
<DT><B>Wizards</B>
<DD>People who know a particular Net-related topic inside
and out.  Unix wizards can perform amazing tricks with that operating
system, for example.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX204"></A>
<DT><B>Net.saints</B>
<DD>Always willing to help a newcomer, eager to share
their knowledge with those not born with an innate ability to navigate
the Net, they are not as rare as you might think.  Post a question
about something and you'll often be surprised how many responses you
get.
</DL>
<P>
The last group brings us back to the Net's oral tradition.  With
few written guides, people have traditionally learned their way around
the Net by asking somebody, whether at the terminal next to them or on
the Net itself.  That tradition continues: if you have a question, ask.
<P>
Today, one of the places you can look for help is in the
<TT>news.newusers.questions</TT> newsgroup, which, as its name suggests, is a
place to learn more about Usenet.  But be careful what you post.  Some
of the Usenet wizards there get cranky sometimes when they have to
answer the same question over and over again. Oh, they'll eventually
answer your question, but not before they tell you should have 
asked your host system administrator first or looked at the postings in
<TT>news.announce.newusers</TT>.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Killfiles</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_74.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_76.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC78" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC78">Killfiles -- The cure for all that ails you</A></H2>
<P>
As you keep reading Usenet, you are going to run across things or
people that really drive you nuts -- or that you just get tired of
seeing.
<P>
Killfiles are just the thing for you. When you start your
newsreader, it checks to see if you have any lists of words, phrases
or names you don't want to see.  If you do, then it blanks out any
<A NAME="IDX205"></A>
messages containing those words.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX206"></A>
<A NAME="IDX207"></A>
Such as cascades.
<P>
As you saw earlier, when you post a reply to a message and
include parts of that message, the original lines show up with a &#62; in
front of them.  Well, what if you reply to a reply?  Then you get a &#62;&#62;
in front of the line.  And if you reply to that reply? You get &#62;&#62;&#62;.
Keep this up, and soon you get a triangle of &#62;'s building up in your
message.
<P>
There are people who like building up these triangles, or
cascades.  They'll "respond" to your message by deleting everything
you've said, leaving only the "In message 123435, you said:" part and
the last line of your message, to which they add a nonsensical 
retort.  On and on they go until the triangle has reached the right
end of the page. Then they try to expand the triangle by deleting one
with each new line. Whoever gets to finish this mega-triangle wins.
<P>
There is even a newsgroup just for such folks: alt.cascade.
Unfortunately, cascaders would generally rather cascade in other
newsgroups. Because it takes a lot of messages to build up a completed
cascade, the targeted newsgroup soon fills up with these messages. Of
course, if you complain, you'll be bombarded with messages about the
First Amendment and artistic expression -- or worse, with another
cascade. The only thing you can do is ignore them, by setting up a
killfile.
<P>
There are also certain newsgroups where killfiles will come in
handy because of the way the newsgroups are organized.  For example, readers of
<TT>rec.arts.tv.soaps</TT> always use an acronym in their "Subject:" line for
the show they're writing about (AMC, for example, for "All My
Children").  This way, people who only want to read about "One Life to
Live" can blank out all the messages about "The Young and the
Restless" and all the others (to keep people from accidentally
screening out messages that might contain the letters "gh" in them,
"General Hospital" viewers always use "gh:" in their subject lines).
<P>
Both nn and rn let you create killfiles, but in different ways.
<P>
To create a killfile in nn, go into the newsgroup with the
offending messages and type a capital <SAMP>`K'</SAMP>.  You'll see this at the
bottom of your screen:
<P>
<PRE>
AUTO (k)ill or (s)elect (CR =&#62; Kill subject 30 days)
</PRE>
<P>
If you hit return, nn will ask you which article's subject you're
tired of. Chose one and the article and any follow-ups will disappear,
and you won't see them again for 30 days.
If you type a lower-case <SAMP>`k'</SAMP> instead, you'll get this:
<P>
<PRE>
AUTO KILL on (s)ubject or (n)ame  (s)
</PRE>
<P>
If you hit your <SAMP>`S'</SAMP> key or just enter,  you'll see this:
<P>
<PRE>
KILL Subject: (=/)
</PRE>
<P>
Type in the name of the offending word or phrase and hit enter.
You'll then be prompted:
<P>
<PRE>
KILL in (g)roup 'eff.test' or in (a)ll groups  (g)
</PRE>
<P>
except that the name of the group you see will be the one you're
actually in at the moment.  Because cascaders and other annoying
people often cross-post their messages to a wide range of newsgroups,
you might consider hitting <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`g'</SAMP>.  Next comes:
<P>
<PRE>
Lifetime of entry in days (p)ermanent  (30)
</PRE>
<P>
The P key will screen out the offending articles forever, while
hitting enter will do it for 30 days.  You can also type in a number
of days for the blocking.
<P>
Creating killfiles in rn works differently -- its default
killfile generator only works for messages in specific groups, rather
than globally for your entire newsgroup list.  To create a global
killfile, you'll have to write one yourself.
<P>
To create a killfile in rn, go into the newsgroup where the
offending messages are and type in its number so you get it on your
screen. Type a capital <SAMP>`K'</SAMP>.  From now on, any message with that subject
line will disappear before you read the group. You should probably
choose a reply, rather than the original message, so that you will get
all of the followups (the original message won't have a "Re: " in its
subject line). The next time you call up that newsgroup, rn will tell
you it's killing messages. When it's done, hit the space bar to go
back into reading mode.
<P>
To create a "global" kill file that will automatically wipe out
articles in all groups you read, start rn and type control-K.  This
will start your whatever text editor you have as your default on your
host system and create a file (called <TT>`KILL'</TT>, in your <TT>`News'</TT>
subdirectory).
<P>
On the first line, you'll type in the word, phrase or name you
don't want to see, followed by commands that tell rn whether to search
an entire message for the word or name and then what to do when it
finds it.
<P>
Each line must be in this form
<P>
<PRE>
/pattern/modifier:j
</PRE>
<P>
"Pattern" is the word or phrase you want rn to look for.  It's
case-insensitive: both "test" and "Test" will be knocked out.  The
modifier tells rn whether to limit its search to message headers
(which can be useful when the object is to never see messages from a
particular person):
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>a:</CODE>
<DD>Looks through an entire message
<P>
<DT><CODE>h:</CODE>
<DD>Looks just at the header
</DL>
<P>
You can leave out the modifier command, in which case rn will
only look at the subject line of messages. The <SAMP>`j'</SAMP> at the end tells rn
to screen out all articles with the offending word.
<P>
So if you never want to see the word "foo" in any header, ever again,
type this:
<P>
<PRE>
/foo/h:j
<A NAME="IDX208"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
This is particularly useful for getting rid of articles from
people who post in more than one newsgroup, such as cascaders, since
an article's newsgroup name is always in the header.
<P>
If you just want to block messages with a subject line about
cascades, you could try:
<P>
<PRE>
/foo/:j
<A NAME="IDX209"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
To kill anything that is a followup to any article, use this
pattern:
<P>
<PRE>
/Subject: *Re:/:j
<A NAME="IDX210"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
When done writing lines for each phrase to screen, exit the text
editor as you normally would, and you'll be put back in rn.
<P>
One word of caution: go easy on the global killfile.  An
extensive global killfile, or one that makes frequent use of the <SAMP>`a:'</SAMP>
modifier can dramatically slow down rn, since the system will now have
to look at every single word in every single message in all the
newsgroups you want to read.
<P>
If there's a particular person whose posts you never want to see
again, first find his or address (which will be in the "from:" line of
his postings) and then write a line in your killfile like this:
<P>
<PRE>
/From: *name@address\.all/h:j
<A NAME="IDX211"></A>
</PRE>

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Some Usenet hints</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_75.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_77.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC79" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC79">Some Usenet hints</A></H2>
<P>
Case counts in Unix -- most of the time.  Many Unix commands,
including many of those used for reading Usenet articles, are case
sensitive.  Hit a <SAMP>`d'</SAMP> when you meant a <SAMP>`D'</SAMP> and either nothing will
happen,
or something completely different from what you expected will happen.
So watch that case!
<P>
In nn, you can get help most of the time by typing a question mark
(the exception is when you are writing your own message, because then
you are inside the text-processing program).  In rn, type a lower-case <SAMP>`h'</SAMP>
at any prompt to get some online help.
<P>
When you're searching for a particular newsgroup, whether through
the l command in rn or with nngrep for nn, you sometimes may have to
try several keywords.  For example, there is a newsgroup dedicated to
the <VAR>Grateful Dead</VAR>, but you'd never find it if you tried, say,
<SAMP>`l grateful dead'</SAMP>, because the name is <TT>rec.music.gdead</TT>.
In general, try the smallest
possible part of the word or discussion you're looking for, for example,
use "trek" to find newsgroups about "Star Trek."  If one word doesn't
<A NAME="IDX212"></A>
<A NAME="IDX213"></A>
produce anything, try another.

Net users sometimes like to think they are smarter or somehow better
than everybody else.  They're not.  If they were, nobody on the Net would
ever have heard of Craig Shergold, the Brain-Tumor Boy, or the evil FCC's
plan to tax your modem. And you wouldn't keep seeing the same dumb chain 
letter. Alas, all of these are here to stay.  Just when they seem to have 
died off, somebody posts a message about one or the other, starting a whole 
new round of flame wars on the subject. 
For the record, here are the stories then:

<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_77.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_79.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC81" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC81">Craig Shergold</A></H3>
<P>
There once was a seven-year-old boy in England named Craig
Shergold who was diagnosed with a seemingly incurable brain tumor.  As
he lay dying, he wished only to have friends send him postcards.  The
local newspapers got a hold of the tear-jerking story.  Soon, the boy's 
wish had changed: he now wanted to get into the Guinness Book of World
Records for the largest postcard collection.  Word spread around the
<A NAME="IDX214"></A>
world. People by the millions sent him postcards.
<P>
Miraculously, the boy lived.  An American billionaire even flew
him to the U.S. for surgery to remove what remained of the tumor.  And
his wish succeeded beyond his wildest dreams -- he made the Guinness
Book of World Records.
<P>
But with Craig now well into his teens, his dream has turned into
a nightmare for the post office in the small town outside London where
he lives.  Like Craig himself, his request for cards just refuses to
die, inundating the post office with millions of cards every year.
Just when it seems like the flow is slowing, along comes somebody else
who starts up a whole new slew of requests for people to send Craig
post cards (or greeting cards or business cards -- Craig letters have
truly taken on a life of their own and begun to mutate). Even Dear Abby
has asked people to stop!
<P>
What does any of this have to do with the Net? The Craig letter
seems to pop up on Usenet as often as it does on cork boards at major 
corporations.  No matter how many times somebody like Gene Spafford
posts periodic messages to ignore them or spend your money on something
more sensible (a donation to the local Red Cross, say), somebody
manages to post a letter asking readers to send cards to poor little
Craig.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - The Modem Tax</TITLE>

<H3><A NAME="SEC82" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC82">The Modem Tax</A></H3>
<P>
In 1987, the Federal Communications Commission considered removing
a tax break it had granted CompuServe and other large commercial
computer networks for use of the national phone system.  The FCC
quickly reconsidered after alarmed users of bulletin-board systems
<A NAME="IDX215"></A>
<A NAME="IDX216"></A>
<A NAME="IDX217"></A>
bombarded it with complaints about this "modem tax." 
<P>
Now, every couple of months, somebody posts an "urgent" message
warning Net users that the FCC is about to impose a modem tax.  This is
NOT true.  The way you can tell if you're dealing with the hoax story
is simple: it ALWAYS mentions an incident in which a talk-show host on
KGO radio in San Francisco becomes outraged on the air when he reads a
story about the tax in the New York Times.
<P>
Another way to tell it's not true is that it never mentions a
specific FCC docket number or closing date for comments.
Save that letter to your congressman for something else.

Sooner or later, you're going to run into a message titled "Make Money 
Fast."  It's your basic chain letter.  The Usenet version is always about 
some guy named Dave Rhodes who was on the verge of death, or something, 
when he discovered a perfectly legal way to make tons of money -- by 
<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
posting a chain letter on computer systems around the world. Yeah, right.

There are .sigs and there are .sigs.  Many people put only bare-bones 
information in their .sig files -- their names and e-mail addresses,
perhaps their phone numbers.  Others add a quotation they think is funny or
profound and a disclaimer that their views are not those of their employer.
Still others add some ASCII-art graphics.  And then there are
those who go totally berserk, posting huge creations with multiple quotes,
hideous ASCII "barfics" and more e-mail addresses than anybody could
humanly need.  College freshmen unleashed on the Net seem to excel at
these.   You can see the best of the worst in the <TT>alt.fan.warlord</TT>

Usenet's international reach raises interesting legal questions that
have yet to be fully resolved.  Can a discussion or posting that is legal
in one country be transmitted to a country where it is against the law?
Does the posting even become illegal when it reaches the border?  And what
if that country is the only path to a third country where the message is
legal as well?  Several foreign colleges and other institutions have
cut off feeds of certain newsgroups where Americans post what is, in
the U.S., perfectly legal discussions of drugs or alternative sexual
practices.  Even in the U.S., some universities have discontinued
certain newsgroups their administrators find offensive, again, usually
in the <TT>alt.*</TT> hierarchy.

<P>
In the late 1970s, Unix developers came up with a new feature: a
system to allow Unix computers to exchange data over phone lines.
<P>
In 1979, two graduate students at Duke University in North
Carolina, <VAR>Tom Truscott</VAR> and <VAR>Jim Ellis</VAR>, came up with the idea
of using
this system, known as UUCP (for Unix-to-Unix CoPy), to distribute
information of interest to people in the Unix community.  Along with
<VAR>Steve Bellovin</VAR>, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina
and <VAR>Steve Daniel</VAR>, they wrote conferencing software and linked together
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
<A NAME="IDX222"></A>
<A NAME="IDX223"></A>
<A NAME="IDX224"></A>
<A NAME="IDX225"></A>
computers at Duke and UNC.
<P>
Word quickly spread and by 1981, a graduate student at Berkeley,
<VAR>Mark Horton</VAR> and a nearby high school student, <VAR>Matt Glickman</VAR>, had
released a new version that added more features and was able to handle
larger volumes of postings -- the original North Carolina program was
<A NAME="IDX226"></A>
<A NAME="IDX227"></A>
meant for only a few articles in a newsgroup each day.
<P>
Today, Usenet connects tens of thousands of sites around the world,
from mainframes to Amigas.  With more than 3,000 newsgroups and untold
thousands of readers, it is perhaps the world's largest computer
network.

When you start up rn, you get a "warning" that "bogus
newsgroups" are present.
<P>
Within a couple of minutes, you'll be asked
whether to keep these or delete them.  Delete them.  Bogus newsgroups
are newsgroups that your system administrator or somebody else has
determined are no longer needed.
<P>
<LI>
While in a newsgroup in rn, you get a message: "skipping
unavailable article."  This is usually an article that somebody posted
and then decided to cancel.
<P>
<LI>
You upload a text file to your Unix host system for use in a 
Usenet message or e-mail, and when you or your recipient reads the file, 
every line ends with a <SAMP>`^M'</SAMP>.
<P>
This happens because Unix handles line endings differently than MS-
DOS or Macintosh computers.  Most Unix systems have programs to convert 
incoming files from other computers. To use it, upload your file and 
then, at your command line, type
<P>
<PRE>
dos2unix filename filename

or
<P>

mac2unix filename filename

depending on which kind of computer you are using and where filename is 
the name of the file you've just uploaded.  A similar program can prepare 
text files for downloading to your computer, for example:

unix2dos filename filename

<H2><A NAME="SEC90" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC90">Internet Mailing Lists</A></H2>
<P>
Usenet is not the only forum on the Net.  Scores of "mailing
lists"  represent another way to interact with other Net users.
Unlike Usenet messages,  which are stored in one central location on
your host system's computer, mailing-list messages are delivered right
<A NAME="IDX234"></A>
<A NAME="IDX235"></A>
to your e-mail box, unlike Usenet messages.
<P>
You have to ask for permission to join a mailing list.  Unlike
Usenet, where your message is distributed to the world, on a mailing
list, you send your messages to a central moderator, who either re-mails
it to the other people on the list or uses it to compile a periodic
<A NAME="IDX236"></A>
<A NAME="IDX237"></A>
"digest" mailed to subscribers.
<P>
Given the number of newsgroups, why would anybody bother with a
mailing list?
<P>
Even on Usenet, there are some topics that just might not generate
enough interest for a newsgroup; for example, the <i>Queen</I> list, which is
all about the late <VAR>Freddie Mercury</VAR>'s band; or the <i>Marillion &#38; Fish</I>
<A NAME="IDX238"></A>
<A NAME="IDX239"></A>
<A NAME="IDX240"></A>
<A NAME="IDX241"></A>
<A NAME="IDX242"></A>
list called "Freaks."
<P>
And because a moderator decides who can participate, a mailing list
can offer a degree of freedom to speak one's mind (or not worry about
<B>net.weenies</B>) that is not necessarily possible on Usenet.  Several
groups offer anonymous postings -- only the moderator knows the real
names of people who contribute. Examples include 12Step, where people
enrolled in such programs as Alcoholics Anonymous can discuss their
experiences, and sappho, a list limited to gay and bisexual women.
<P>
You can find mailing addresses and descriptions of these lists
in the <TT>news.announce.newusers</TT> newsgroup with the subject of "Publicly
Accessible Mailing Lists."  Mailing lists now number in the hundreds,
so this posting is divided into three parts.
<P>
If you find a list to which you want to subscribe, send an e-mail
message to
<P>
<PRE>
list-request@address
</PRE>
<P>
where "list" is the name of the mailing list and "address" is the
moderator's e-mail address, asking to be added to the list.  Include
your full e-mail address just in case something happens to your
message's header along the way, and ask, if you're accepted, for the
address to mail messages to the list.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Bitnet Lists</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_87.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_89.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC91" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC91">Bitnet Lists</A></H2>
<P>
As if Usenet and mailing lists were not enough, there are
Bitnet "discussion groups" or "lists."
<P>
Bitnet is an international network linking colleges and
universities, but it uses a different set of technical protocols for
distributing information than the Internet or Usenet.
It offers hundreds of discussion groups, comparable in scope to
Usenet newsgroups.
<P>
One of the major differences is the way messages are
distributed.  Bitnet messages are sent to your mailbox, just as with a
mailing list. However, where mailing lists are often maintained by a
person, all Bitnet discussion groups are automated -- you subscribe to
them through messages to a "listserver" computer.  This is a kind of
robot moderator that controls distribution of messages on the list.  In
many cases, it also maintains indexes and archives of past postings in a
given discussion group, which can be handy if you want to get up to
speed with a discussion or just search for some information related to
<A NAME="IDX243"></A>
it.
<P>
Many Bitnet discussion groups are now "translated" into Usenet
form and carried through Usenet in the <TT>bit.listserv.*</TT> hierarchy.  In
general, it's probably better to read messages through Usenet if you
can.  It saves some storage space on your host system's hard drives.
<P>
If 50 people subscribe to the same Bitnet list, that means 50
copies of each message get stored on the system; whereas if 50 people
read a Usenet message, that's still only one message that needs storage
on the system.  It can also save your sanity if the discussion group
generates large numbers of messages.  Think of opening your e-mailbox
one day to find 200 messages in it -- 199 of them from a discussion
group and one of them a "real" e-mail message that's important to you.
<P>
Subscribing and canceling subscriptions is done through an e-mail
message to the listserver computer.  For addressing, all
listservers are known as "listserv" (yep) at some Bitnet address.
This means you will have to add <SAMP>`.bitnet'</SAMP> to the end of the
address, if it's in a form like this: <SAMP>`listserv@miamiu'</SAMP>. For example, if
you have an interest in environmental issues, you might want to
subscribe to the Econet discussion group.  To subscribe, send an e-mail
message to
<P>
<PRE>
listserv@miamiu.bitnet
</PRE>
<P>
Some Bitnet listservers are also connected to the Internet, so if you
see a listserver address ending in <SAMP>`.edu'</SAMP>, you can e-mail the
listserver without adding <SAMP>`.bitnet'</SAMP> to the end.
<P>
Always leave the "Subject:" line blank in a message to a
listserver.  Inside the message, you tell the listserver what you
want, with a series of simple commands:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>subscribe group <EM>Your Name</EM></CODE>
<DD>To subscribe to a list, where <B>group</B>
is the list name and <EM>Your Name</EM> is
your full name, for example:
<A NAME="IDX244"></A>
<SAMP>`subscribe econet Henry Fielding'</SAMP>
<P>
<DT><CODE>unsubscribe group <EM>Your Name</EM></CODE>
<DD>To discontinue a group, for example:
<A NAME="IDX245"></A>
<SAMP>`unsubscribe econet Henry Fielding'</SAMP>
<P>
<DT><CODE>list global</CODE>
<DD>This sends you a list of all available
Bitnet discussion groups.  But be careful -- the list is VERY long!
<P>
<DT><CODE>get refcard</CODE>
<DD>Sends you a list of other commands you
can use with a listserver, such as
commands for retrieving past postings
from a discussion group.
</DL>
<P>
Each of these commands goes on a separate line in your message
(and you can use one or all of them).  If you want to get a list of
all Bitnet discussion groups, send e-mail to
<P>
<PRE>
listserv@bitnic.educom.edu
</PRE>
<P>
Leave the "Subject:" line blank and use the list global command.
<P>
When you subscribe to a Bitnet group, there are two important
differences from Usenet.
<P>
First, when you want to post a message for others to read in the
discussion group, you send a message to the group name at its Bitnet
address.  Using Econet as an example, you would mail the message to:
<P>
<PRE>
econet@miamiu.bitnet
</PRE>
<P>
Note that this is different from the listserv address you used to
subscribe to the group to begin with.  Use the listserv address ONLY
to subscribe to or unsubscribe from a discussion group.  If you use the
discussion-group address to try to subscribe or unsubscribe, your message 
will go out to every other subscriber, many of whom will think unkind 
thoughts, which they may share with you in an e-mail message). 
<P>
The second difference relates to sending an e-mail message to the
author of a particular posting.  Usenet newsreaders such as rn and nn
let you do this with one key.  But if you hit your <SAMP>`R'</SAMP> key to respond to
a discussion-group message, your message will go to the listserver,
and from there to everybody else on the list!  This can prove
embarrassing to you and annoying to others. To make sure your
message goes just to the person who wrote the posting, take down his
e-mail address from the posting and then compose a brand-new message.
Remember, also, that if you see an e-mail address like
<TT>&lt;IZZY@INDYVMS&gt;</TT>, it's 
a Bitnet address. 
<P>
Two Bitnet lists will prove helpful for delving further into the
network.  NEW-LIST tells you the names of new discussion groups. To
subscribe, send a message to <TT>&lt;listserv@ndsuvm1.bitnet&gt;</TT>:
<P>
<PRE>
sub NEW-LIST Your Name
</PRE>
<P>
INFONETS is the place to go when you have questions about Bitnet.
It is also  first rate for help on questions about all major computer
networks and how to reach them.  To subscribe, send e-mail to
<TT>&lt;info-nets-request@think.com&gt;</TT>:
<P>
<PRE>
sub INFONETS Your Name
</PRE>
<P>
Both of these lists are also available on Usenet, the former as
<TT>bit.listserv.new-list</TT>; the latter as <TT>bit.listserv.infonets</TT>
(sometimes <TT>bit.listserv.info-nets</TT>).
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>"It wasn't long before the invention of the mailing-list, an
ARPANET broadcasting technique in which an identical message could
be sent automatically to large number of network subscribers.
Interestingly, one of the first really big mailing-list was "SF-LOVERS",
for Science Fiction fans. Disscussing science fiction on the network
was not work-related and was frowned upon by many ARPANET computer
administrators, but this didn't stop it from happening."</EM>

<P>
Like any large community, cyberspace has its libraries, places you
can go to look up information or take out a good book.  Telnet is one of
<A NAME="IDX246"></A>
<A NAME="IDX247"></A>
<A NAME="IDX248"></A>
your keys to these libraries.
<P>
<EM>Telnet</EM> is a program that lets you use the power of the Internet to
connect you to databases, library catalogs, and other information
resources around the world.  Want to see what the weather's like in
Vermont? Check on crop conditions in Azerbaijan? Get more information
about somebody whose name you've seen online? Telnet lets you do this,
and more.
<P>
Alas, there's a big "but!"  Unlike the phone system, Internet is not
yet universal;  not everybody can use all of its services.  Almost all
colleges and universities on the Internet provide telnet access.   So do
all of the for-fee public-access systems listed in
section <A HREF="bdg_8.html#SEC11">Ready, Set...</A>. But the 
Free-Net systems do not give you access to every telnet system.  And if 
you are using a public-access UUCP or Usenet site, you will not have 
access to telnet. The main reason for this is cost.  Connecting to the 
Internet can easily cost $1,000 or more for a leased, high-speed phone 
line. Some databases and file libraries can be queried by e-mail, 
however; we'll show you how to do that later on. In the meantime, the 
rest of this chapter assumes you are connected to a site with at least 
<A NAME="IDX249"></A>
<A NAME="IDX250"></A>
<A NAME="IDX251"></A>
<A NAME="IDX252"></A>
partial Internet access. 
<P>
Most telnet sites are fairly easy to use and have online help systems.
Most also work best (and in some cases, only) with VT100 emulation.
Let's dive right in and try one.
<P>
At your host system's command line, type
<P>
<PRE>
telnet access.usask.ca
<A NAME="IDX253"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  That's all you have to do to connect to a telnet site!
In this case, you'll be connecting to a service known as Hytelnet, which
is a database of computerized library catalogs and other databases
<A NAME="IDX254"></A>
available through telnet.  You should see something like this:

</PRE>
<P>
Every telnet site has two addresses -- one composed of words that
are easier for people to remember; the other a numerical address better
suited for computers.  The "escape character" is good to remember.  When
all else fails, hitting your control key and the <SAMP>`]'</SAMP> key at the same time
will disconnect you and return you to your host system.  At the login
prompt, type

<P>
The first choice, "&#60;WHATIS&#62;" will be highlighted.  Use your down
and up arrows to move the cursor among the choices.  Hit enter when you
decide on one.  You'll get another menu, which in turn will bring up
text files telling you how to connect to sites and giving any special
commands or instructions you might need.  Hytelnet does have one quirk.
To move back to where you started (for example, from a sub-menu to a
main menu), hit the left-arrow key on your computer.
<P>
Play with the system.  You might want to turn on your computer's
screen-capture, or at the very least, get out a pen and paper. You're
bound to run across some interesting telnet services that you'll want to
try -- and you'll need their telnet "addresses."
<P>
As you move around Hytelnet, it may seem as if you haven't left
your host system -- telnet can work that quickly.  Occasionally, when
network loads are heavy, however, you will notice a delay between the
time you type a command or enter a request and the time the remote
service responds.
<P>
To disconnect from Hytelnet and return to your system, hit your q
key and enter.
<P>
Some telnet computers are set up so that you can only access them
through a specific "port."  In those cases, you'll always see a number
after their name, for example:  <B>india.colorado.edu 13</B>. It's important to
include that number, because otherwise, you may not get in.
<P>
In fact, try the above address. Type
<P>
<PRE>
telnet india.colorado.edu 13

and hit enter.  You should see something like this:

<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_90.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_92.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC94" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC94">Library Catalogs</A></H2>
<P>
Several hundred libraries around the world, from the Snohomish 
Public Library in Washington State to the Library of Congress are now 
available to you through telnet. You can use Hytelnet to find their 
names, telnet addresses and use instructions. 
<P>
Why would you want to browse a library you can't physically get to?
Many libraries share books, so if yours doesn't have what you're looking
for, you can tell the librarian where he or she can get it.  Or if you live
in an area where the libraries are not yet online, you can use telnet to do
some basic bibliographic research before you head down to the local branch.
<P>
There are several different database programs in use by online
libraries.  Harvard's is one of the easier ones to use, so let's try it.
<P>
Telnet to <B>hollis.harvard.edu</B>.  When you connect, you'll see:

WELCOME TO HOLLIS
(Harvard OnLine Library Information System)

To begin, type one of the 2-character database codes listed below:

HU      Union Catalog of the Harvard libraries
OW      Catalog of Older Widener materials
LG      Guide to Harvard Libraries and Computing Resources

AI      Expanded Academic Index (selective 1987-1988, full 1989-  )
LR      Legal Resource Index (1980-  )
PA      PAIS International (1985-  )

To change databases from any place in HOLLIS, type CHOOSE followed by a
2-character database code, as in:    CHOOSE HU

For general help in using HOLLIS, type HELP.   For HOLLIS news, type
HELP NEWS.   For HOLLIS hours of operation, type HELP HOURS.

<P>
The first thing to notice is the name of the system: Hollis.
Librarians around the world seem to be inordinately found of cutesy,
anthropomorphized acronyms for their machines (not far from Harvard, the
librarians at Brandeis University came up with Library On-Line User
Information Service, or Louis; MIT has Barton).
<P>
If you want to do some general browsing, probably the best bet on the
Harvard system is to choose HU, which gets you access to their main
holdings, including those of its medical libraries.  Chose that, and you'll
see this:

One particularly interesting system is the one run by the Colorado
Alliance of Research Libraries, which maintains databases for libraries
throughout Colorado, the West and even in Boston.
<P>
<PRE>
Telnet <B>pac.carl.org</B>
</PRE>
<P>
Follow the simple log-in instructions. When you get a menu, type <SAMP>`72'</SAMP>
(even though that is not listed), which takes you to the Pikes Peak Library
District, which serves the city of Colorado Springs.
<P>
Several years ago, its librarians realized they could use their
database program not just for books but for cataloging city records and
community information, as well.  Today, if you want to look up municipal
ordinances or city records, you only have to type in the word you're
looking for and you'll get back cites of the relevant laws or decisions.
<P>
Carl will also connect you to the University of Hawaii library, which,
like the one in Colorado Springs, has more than just bibliographic material
online.  One of its features is an online Hawaiian almanac that can tell
you everything you ever wanted to know about Hawaiians, including the
number injured in boogie-board accidents each year (seven).

PENPages, run by Pennsylvania State University's College of
Agricultural Sciences, provides weekly world weather and crop reports
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These reports detail 
everything from the effect of the weather on palm trees in Malaysia to
the state of the Ukrainian wheat crop. Reports from Pennsylvania
country extension officers offer tips for improving farm life. One
database lists Pennsylvania hay distributors by county -- and rates
<A NAME="IDX255"></A>
the quality of their hay!
<P>
The service lets you search for information two different ways. A
menu system gives you quick access to reports that change frequently,
such as the weekly crop/weather reports. An index system lets you
search through several thousand online documents by keyword. At the
main menu, you can either browse through an online manual or choose
"PENPages," which puts you into the agriculture system.

The National Ham Radio Call-Sign Callbook lets you search for
American amateur operators by callsign, city, last name or Zip code. A
successful search will give you the ham's name, address, callsign,
age, type of license and when he or she got it. 
Telnet:  <B>callsign.cs.buffalo.edu 2000</B> or <B>ham.njit.edu 2000</B>.
When you connect, you tell the system how you want to search and
what you're looking for. For example, if you want to search for hams
by city, you would type
<P>
<PRE>
city city-name
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter (for example: <SAMP>`city Kankakee'</SAMP>).
<P>
Other search choices are "call" (after which you would type a
ham's call sign), "name," and "zip" (which you would follow with a Zip
code).  Be careful when searching for hams in a large city; there
doesn't seem to be anyway to shut off the list once it starts except
by using control-]. Otherwise, when done, type
<P>
<PRE>
quit

<P>
Communications Canada, a Canadian government agency is developing
Conversational Hypertext Access Technology (CHAT), a system
to provide easy database access to
people with little or no computer experience, using what are known as
hypertext links.  Instead of cryptic computer commands, users type
questions in English.
<P>
<PRE>
Telnet: <B>debra.doc.ca</B>

</PRE>
<P>
You choose one of the three databases now online, one on AIDS, and
<A NAME="IDX258"></A>
then ask questions in English.
<P>
Ask the AIDS database, "When was AIDS first discovered?" and it
answers:
<P>
"The first case of AIDS in North America was diagnosed in 1979.
Before that, it existed in Africa, probably beginning in the 1950's.
AIDS was discovered in North America when a number of young men with a
history of homosexuality developed a rare type of cancer called
Kaposi's sarcoma."
<P>
Sometimes, you do have to rephrase your question. For example,
when asked "What is the link between AIDS and drug use?" the computer
responds:
<P>
"I know two things about drugs: the drugs that are used to treat
people with AIDS, and the risks that drug users have in getting AIDS.
Please ask about treatments or drug users."

<H3><A NAME="SEC120" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC120">Time</A></H3>
<P>
To find out the exact time:
<P>
<PRE>
Telnet: <B>india.colorado.edu 13</B>
</PRE>
<P>
You'll see something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
Escape character is '^]'.
Sun Apr  5 14:11:41 1992
Connection closed by foreign host.
</PRE>
<P>
The middle line tells you the date and exact Mountain Standard
Time, as determined by a federal atomic clock.
<P>
If you want a more philosophical approach to your time, the U.S.
Naval Observatory's Automated Data Service has copies of detailed
papers on such things as "the nature of time."  It also carries
information on how to buy a clock, along with arcana on such things as
<A NAME="IDX268"></A>
<A NAME="IDX269"></A>
"leap seconds."
<P>
<VAR>Unfortunately the unrestricted telnet "ads" account that has been
introduced at this place in previous release of this guide has been
restricted for priviledged users. But an alternative way has also been
set up.</VAR>
<P>
<VAR>Now, one has to use an e-mail query to get the information, so
the following info would have better gone into another
(see section <A HREF="bdg_212.html#SEC215">Advanced E-mail</A>) section, but for the "sake of history..."</VAR>
<P>
There is a new experimental mail server called "adsmail" on tycho.
It will send by return mail any of the ADS data files.
You can obtain a list of available files by sending e-mail to
<TT>&lt;adsmail@tycho&gt;</TT> with subject: <SAMP>`anything'</SAMP>. For example:
<P>
<PRE>
mail -s anything adsmail@tycho.usno.navy.mil
</PRE>
<P>
To obtain any pariticular ADS file, just send e-mail with the name of the 
command associated withe the file:
 
<PRE>
mail -s gpssy adsmail@tycho.usno.navy.mil
</PRE>
<P>
and in 10 minutes or less you will receive the requested file. This service
extends ADS access to people who normally cannot telnet to tycho. Note that
no password is required for e-mail service.

Originally an in-hospital help network, it is now sponsored by Case
Western Reserve University, the city of Cleveland, the state of Ohio
and IBM. It uses simple menus, similar to those found on CompuServe,
but organized like a city:

<H3><A NAME="SEC129" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC129">Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (WELL)</A></H3>
Itself a major Net access
point in the San Francisco area, the WELL is also a unique online
community that maintains dozens of conferences on every imaginable
topic (seven devoted just to the Grateful Dead).  WELL users are
intelligent and opinionated; discussions are often fast and furious.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation was basically started in a series
of online conversations on the WELL. Although it has a serious San
Francisco flavor, it has users from across the country (enough to
<A NAME="IDX275"></A>
<A NAME="IDX276"></A>
support both East Coast and Midwest conferences).
<P>
For its conferences, the WELL uses PicoSpan software, which
presents messages differently than rn or nn.   When you enter a
conference, you can call up a list of "topics."  Enter a topic number,
and all of the messages start scrolling down the screen, sort of like
the music on an old-fashioned player-piano.  There is some online
help, but new users are sent a written manual.
See section <A HREF="bdg_44.html#SEC47">Electronic Mail</A>
for information on access charges (one advantage to connecting to the WELL
through telnet is that unless you live in the Bay Area, it is likely
to be much cheaper than other access methods).

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Putting the Finger on Someone</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_127.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_129.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC131" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC131">Putting the Finger on Someone</A></H2>
<P>
Finger is a handy little program which lets you find out more about 
people on the Net -- and lets you tell others on the Net more about 
yourself. 
<P>
Finger uses the same concept as telnet or ftp. But it works with 
only one file, called .plan (yes, with a period in front).  This is a 
text file an Internet user creates with a text editor in his home 
directory.  You can put your phone number in there, tell a little bit 
about yourself, or write almost anything at all.
<P>
To finger somebody else's <TT>`.plan'</TT> file, type this at the command
<A NAME="IDX277"></A>
line:
<P>
<PRE>
finger email-address
</PRE>
<P>
where email-address is the person's e-mail address.  You'll get back a
display that shows the last time the person was online, whether
they've gotten any new mail since that time and what, if anything, is
in their <TT>`.plan'</TT> file.
Some people and institutions have come up with creative uses for
these <TT>`.plan'</TT> files, letting you do everything from checking the weather
in Massachusetts to getting the latest baseball standings.  Try
fingering these e-mail addresses:

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Finding Someone on the Net</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_128.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_130.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC132" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC132">Finding Someone on the Net</A></H2>
<P>
So you have a friend and you want to find out if he has an Internet 
account to which you can write?  The quickest way may be to just pick up 
the phone, call him and ask him.  Although there are a variety of "white 
pages" services available on the Internet, they are far from complete -- 
college students, users of commercial services such as CompuServe and 
many Internet public-access sites, and many others simply won't be 
listed.  Major e-mail providers are working on a universal directory 
<A NAME="IDX278"></A>
system, but that could be some time away.
<P>
In the meantime, a couple of "white pages" services might give you 
some leads, or even just entertain you as you look up famous people or 
long-lost acquaintances.
<P>
The whois directory provides names, e-mail and postal mail address 
and often phone numbers for people listed in it.  To use it, telnet to
<B>internic.net</B>.
No log-on is needed.  The quickest way to use it is to type
<P>
<PRE>
whois name
</PRE>
  
at the prompt, where "name" is the last name or organization name you're 
looking for.
<P>
Another service worth trying, especially since it seems to give 
beginners fewer problems, is the Knowbot Information Service reachable by 
<A NAME="IDX279"></A>
<A NAME="IDX280"></A>
telnet at <B>info.cnri.reston.va. us 185</B>.
Again, no log-on is needed.  This service actually searches through a 
variety of other "white pages" systems, including the user directory for 
<A NAME="IDX281"></A>
MCIMail.  To look for somebody, type
<P>
<PRE>
query name
</PRE>
<P>
<SAMP>`name'</SAMP> is the last name of the person you're looking for.  You can 
get details of other commands by hitting a question mark at the prompt.
<P>
You can also use the knowbot system by e-mail.  Start a message to
<TT>&lt;netaddress@info.cnri. reston.va.us&gt;</TT>
Leave the "subject:" line blank. As your message, write 
<SAMP>`query name'</SAMP>
for the simplest type of search.  If you want details on more complex
searches, add another line:
<SAMP>`man'</SAMP>
<P>
Apart from the previously mentioned methods, there exists a periodical
posting on Usenet entitled <i>How to find people's E-mail addresses</I>
<A NAME="IDX282"></A>
that is edited and maintained by <VAR>Jonathan I. Kamens</VAR>.
It lists several alternatives in order of success probability, to enable
everybody to find everyone.
<P>
Just get <TT>`/pub/usenet/news.answers/finding-addresses'</TT>
from <B>rtfm.mit.edu</B>. See section <A HREF="bdg_132.html#SEC135">FTP (Mining the Net, part II)</A> to find out how to access this
server. It's cross-posted each month to
<TT>comp.mail.misc</TT>,
<TT>soc.net-people</TT>,
<TT>news.newusers.questions</TT>, and the respective <TT>*.answers</TT>
newsgroups.
<P>
The most interesting way described therein is a
way to search via the Usenet name server. This is a 
system at MIT that keeps track of the e-mail addresses of everybody who 
posts a Usenet message that appears at MIT.
It works by e-mail.  Send a message to 
<TT>&lt;mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu&gt;</TT>.
You can leave the <SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> line blank. As your message, write
<SAMP>`send usenet-addresses/lastname'</SAMP>
where "lastname" is the last name of the person you're looking for.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Tons of Files</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_132.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_134.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC136" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC136">Tons of Files</A></H2>
<P>
Hundreds of systems connected to Internet have file libraries, or
archives, accessible to the public. Much of this consists of free or low-
cost shareware programs for virtually every make of computer.  If you 
want a different communications program for your IBM, or feel like 
playing a new game on your Amiga, you'll be able to get it from the Net. 
<P>
But there are also libraries of documents as well.  If you
want a copy of a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, you can find it on
the Net.  Copies of historical documents, from the Magna Carta to the
Declaration of Independence are also yours for the asking, along with a
translation of a telegram from Lenin ordering the execution of
rebellious peasants.  You can also find song lyrics, poems, even
summaries of every "Lost in Space" episode ever made.  You can also find
extensive files detailing everything you could ever possibly want to know
about the Net itself.  First you'll see how to get these files; then
we'll show you where they're kept.
<P>
The commonest way to get these files is through the file transfer
protocol, or ftp.  As with telnet, not all systems that connect to the
Net have access to ftp.  However, if your system is one of these, you'll
be able to get many of these files through e-mail (see section <A HREF="bdg_212.html#SEC215">Advanced E-mail</A>).
<P>
Starting ftp is as easy as using telnet. At your host system's command
line, type
<P>
<PRE>
ftp site.name
<A NAME="IDX288"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter, where "site.name" is the address of the ftp site you want
to reach.  One major difference between telnet and ftp is that it is
considered bad form to connect to most ftp sites during their business
hours (generally 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time).  This is because
transferring files across the network takes up considerable computing
power, which during the day is likely to be needed for whatever the
computer's main function is.  There are some ftp sites that are
accessible to the public 24 hours a day, though.  You'll find these noted
in the list of ftp sites (see section <A HREF="bdg_138.html#SEC141">Some Interesting FTP Sites</A>).
<P>
How do you find a file you want, though?

<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_133.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_135.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC137" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC137">Your Friend Archie</A></H2>
Until a few years ago, this could be quite the pain -- there was
no master directory to tell you where a given file might be stored on
the Net. Who'd want to slog through hundreds of file libraries looking
for something?
<P>
<VAR>Alan Emtage</VAR>, <VAR>Bill Heelan</VAR> and <VAR>Peter Deutsch</VAR>,
students at McGill University in Montreal, asked the same question.
<A NAME="IDX289"></A>
<A NAME="IDX290"></A>
<A NAME="IDX291"></A>
Unlike the weather, though, they did something about it.
<P>
They created a database system, called archie, that would
periodically call up file libraries and basically find out what they had
available. In turn, anybody could dial into archie, type in a file name, and
see where on the Net it was available. Archie currently catalogs close to
<A NAME="IDX292"></A>
1,000 file libraries around the world.
<P>
Today, there are three ways to ask archie to find a file for you:
through telnet, a "client" Archie program on your own host system or e-mail.
All three methods let you type in a full or partial file name and
will tell you where on the Net it's stored.
If you have access to telnet, you can telnet to one of the following
addresses: <B>archie.mcgill.ca</B>; <B>archie.sura.net</B>;
<B>archie.unl.edu</B>;
<B>archie.ans.net</B>; or <B>archie.rutgers.edu</B>.
If asked for a log-in name, type
<P>
<PRE>
archie
<A NAME="IDX293"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.
<P>
When you connect, the key command is prog, which you use in this
form:
<P>
<PRE>
prog filename
</PRE>
<P>
followed by enter, where "filename" is the program or file you're
looking for. If you're unsure of a file's complete name, try typing in
part of the name. For example, <TT>`PKZIP'</TT> will work as well as
<TT>`PKZIP204.EXE'</TT>.  The system does not support DOS or Unix wildcards.
If you ask archie to look for <TT>`PKZIP*'</TT>, it will tell you it couldn't
find anything by that name.  One thing to keep in mind is that a file is
not necessarily the same as a program -- it could also be a document.
This means you can use archie to search for, say, everything online
related to the Beatles, as well as computer programs and graphics files.
<P>
A number of Net sites now have their own archie programs that
take your request for information and pass it onto the nearest archie
database -- ask your system administrator if s/he has it online. These 
"client" programs seem to provide information a lot more quickly than the
actual archie itself!  If it is available, at your host system's command
line, type
<P>
<PRE>
archie -s filename
<A NAME="IDX294"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
where filename is the program or document you're looking for, and hit
enter.  The <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> tells the program to ignore case in a file name and lets
you search for partial matches. You might actually want to type it this
way:
<P>
<PRE>
archie -s filename |more
</PRE>
<P>
which will stop the output every screen (handy if there are many sites
that carry the file you want).  Or you could open a file on your computer
with your text-logging function.
<P>
The third way, for people without access to either of the above, is e-mail.
<P>
Send a message to <TT>&lt;archie@quiche.cs.mcgill.ca&gt;</TT>. You can leave the
subject line blank.  Inside the message, type
<P>
<PRE>
prog filename
</PRE>
<P>
where filename is the file you're looking for.  You can ask archie to
look up several programs by putting their names on the same "prog" line, 
like this:
<P>
<PRE>
prog file1 file2 file3
</PRE>
<P>
Within a few hours, archie will write back with a list of the
appropriate sites.
<P>
In all three cases, if there is a system that has your file,
you'll get a response that looks something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
Host sumex-aim.stanford.edu

Location: /info-mac/comm
FILE -rw-r--r--     258256  Feb 15 17:07  zterm-09.hqx
Location: /info-mac/misc
FILE -rw-r--r--       7490  Sep 12 1991   zterm-sys7-color-icons.hqx
</PRE>
<P>
Chances are, you will get a number of similar looking responses
for each program.  The "Host" is the system that has the file.  The
"Location" tells you which directory to look in when you connect to
that system.  Ignore the funny-looking collections of r's and hyphens
for now.  After them come the size of the file or directory listing
in bytes, the date it was uploaded, and the name of the file.
<P>
Now you want to get that file.

Assuming your host site does have ftp, you connect in a similar
fashion to telnet, by typing:
<P>
<PRE>
ftp sumex-aim.stanford.edu
</PRE>
<P>
(or the name of whichever site you want to reach). Hit enter.  If the
connection works, you'll see this:
<P>
<PRE>
Connected to sumex-aim.stanford.edu.
220 SUMEX-AIM FTP server (Version 4.196 Mon Jan 13 13:52:23 PST 1992) ready.
Name (sumex-aim.stanford.edu:adamg):
</PRE>
<P>
If nothing happens after a minute or so, hit control-C to return
to your host system's command line.  But if it has worked, type
<P>
<PRE>
anonymous
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You'll see a lot of references on the Net to
"anonymous ftp." This is how it gets its name -- you don't really have
to tell the library site what your name is. The reason is that these
sites are set up so that anybody can gain access to certain public
files, while letting people with accounts on the sites to log on and
access their own personal files.  Next, you'll be asked for your 
password.  As a password, use your e-mail address.  This will then come
up:
<P>

</PRE>
<P>
Now type
<P>
<PRE>

<P>
and hit enter.  You'll see something awful like this:

226 Transfer complete.
ftp&#62;
</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX295"></A>
Ack! Let's decipher this Rosetta Stone.
<P>
First, ls is the ftp command for displaying a directory (you can
actually use dir as well, but if you're used to MS-DOS, this could lead
to confusion when you try to use dir on your host system, where it won't
work, so it's probably better to just remember to always use ls for a
directory while online).
<P>
The very first letter on each line tells you whether the listing is
for a directory or a file. If the first letter is a <SAMP>`d'</SAMP>, or an <SAMP>`l'</SAMP>,
it's a directory. Otherwise, it's a file.
<P>
The rest of that weird set of letters and dashes consist of "flags"
that tell the ftp site who can look at, change or delete the file. You
can safely ignore it. You can also ignore the rest of the line until you
get to the second number, the one just before the date. This tells you
how large the file is, in bytes. If the line is for a directory, the
number gives you a rough indication of how many items are in that
directory  -- a directory listing of 512 bytes is relatively small. Next
comes the date the file or directory was uploaded, followed (finally!) by
its name.
<P>
Notice the <TT>`README.POSTING'</TT> file up at the top of the directory. Most
archive sites have a "read me" document, which usually contains some
basic information about the site, its resources and how to use them.
Let's get this file, both for the information in it and to see how to
transfer files from there to here. At the <SAMP>`ftp&#62;'</SAMP> prompt, type
<P>
<PRE>
get README.POSTING
<A NAME="IDX296"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter. Note that ftp sites are no different from Unix sites in
general: they are case-sensitive. You'll see something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for README.POSTING (4444 bytes).
226 Transfer complete. 4444 bytes received in 1.177 seconds (3.8 Kbytes/s)
</PRE>
<P>
And that's it! The file is now located in your home directory on your host
system, from which you can now download it to your own computer. The
simple <SAMP>`get'</SAMP> command is the key to transferring a file from an archive
<A NAME="IDX297"></A>
site to your host system.
<P>
If you want to download more than one file at a time (say a series
<A NAME="IDX298"></A>
of documents), use <SAMP>`mget'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`get'</SAMP>; for example:
<P>
<PRE>
mget *.txt
</PRE>
<P>
This will transfer copies of every file ending with <TT>`.txt'</TT> in the given
directory.  Before each file is copied, you'll be asked if you're sure
you want it.  Despite this, mget could still save you considerable
time -- you won't have to type in every single file name. If you want to
save even more time, and are sure you really want <EM>all</EM> of the
<A NAME="IDX299"></A>
given files, type <SAMP>`prompt'</SAMP>
before you do the mget command. This will turn off the prompt, and all 
the files will be zapped right into your home directory.
<P>
There is one other command to keep in mind.  If you want to get a
copy of a computer program, type
<P>
<PRE>
bin
<A NAME="IDX300"></A>
<A NAME="IDX301"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  This tells the ftp site and your host site that you are
sending a binary file, i.e., a program.  Most ftp sites now use binary
format as a default, but it's a good idea to do this in case you've
connected to one of the few that doesn't.
<P>
To switch to a directory, type
<P>
<PRE>
cd directory-name
<A NAME="IDX302"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
(substituting the name of the directory you want to access) and hit
enter. Type
<P>
<PRE>
ls
<A NAME="IDX303"></A>
<A NAME="IDX304"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter to get the file listing for that particular directory.
To move back up the directory tree, type
<P>
<PRE>
cd ..
</PRE>
<P>
(note the space between the d and the first period) and hit enter.  Or
you could type
<P>
<PRE>
cdup
<A NAME="IDX305"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  Keep doing this until you get to the directory of
interest.  Alternately, if you already know the directory path of the
file you want (from our friend archie), after you connect, you could
simply type
<P>
<PRE>
get directory/subdirectory/filename
</PRE>
<P>
On many sites, files meant for public consumption are in the pub
or public directory; sometimes you'll see an info directory.
<P>
Almost every site has a bin directory, which at first glance
sounds like a bin in which interesting stuff might be dumped.  But it
actually stands for "binary" and is simply a place for the system
administrator to store the programs that run the ftp system. Lost+found
is another directory that looks interesting but actually never has
anything of public interest in them.
<P>
Before, you saw how to use archie.  From our example, you can see
that some system administrators go a little berserk when naming files.
Fortunately, there's a way for you to rename the file as it's being
transferred. Using our archie example, you'd type
<P>
<PRE>
get zterm-sys7-color-icons.hqx zterm.hqx
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  Instead of having to deal constantly with a file called
<TT>`zterm-sys7-color-icons. hqx'</TT>, you'll now have one called, simply,
<TT>`zterm.hqx'</TT>.
<P>
Those last three letters bring up something else: Many program files
are compressed to save on space and transmission time.  In order to
actually use them, you'll have to use an un-compress program on them first.

<H2><A NAME="SEC139" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC139">Odd Letters -- Decoding File Endings</A></H2>
There are a wide variety of compression methods in use.  You can 
tell which method was used by the last one to three letters at the end of 
a file. Here are some of the more common ones and what you'll need to un-
compress the files they create (most of these decompression programs can 
all be located through archie).
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX306"></A>
<DT><CODE>.txt</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX307"></A>
<DT><CODE>.TXT</CODE>
<DD>By itself, this means the file is a document, rather than a
program.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX308"></A>
<DT><CODE>.ps</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX309"></A>
<DT><CODE>.PS</CODE>
<DD>A PostScript document (in Adobe's page description language).
You can print this file on any PostScript capable printer, or use a
<A NAME="IDX310"></A>
<A NAME="IDX311"></A>
<A NAME="IDX312"></A>
<A NAME="IDX313"></A>
previewer, like GNU project's GhostScript.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX314"></A>
<DT><CODE>.doc</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX315"></A>
<DT><CODE>.DOC</CODE>
<DD>Is another common suffix for documents. No
de-compression is needed, unless it is followed by
<P>
<A NAME="IDX316"></A>
<A NAME="IDX317"></A>
<A NAME="IDX318"></A>
<DT><CODE>.z</CODE>
<DD>A file compressed by the Unix <CODE>pack</CODE> utility.  It uses Huffman coding
(which minimizes redundancy) on each byte.  Type <SAMP>`unpack filename.z'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`gunzip filename.z'</SAMP> to decompress it.  This suffix was also briefly used
to indicate gzip'ed files before <SAMP>`.gz'</SAMP> was adopted.
However, some sites <EM>still</EM> use this suffix for gzip'ed files, e.g.
the EFF's FTP-server, due to local set-ups.

<P>
A few last words of caution: Check the size of a file before you get 
it. The Net moves data at phenomenal rates of speed.  But that 500,000-byte
file that gets transferred to your host system in a few seconds 
could take more than an hour or two to download to your computer if 
you're using a 2400-baud modem.  Your host system may also have limits on 
the amount of bytes you can store online at any one time.  Also, although 
it is really extremely unlikely you will ever get a file infected with a 
virus, if you plan to do much downloading over the Net, you'd be wise to 
<A NAME="IDX359"></A>
invest in a good anti-viral program, just in case.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - The Keyboard Cabal</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_136.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_138.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC140" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC140">The Keyboard Cabal</A></H2>
<P>
System administrators are like everybody else -- they try to make
things easier for themselves.  And when you sit in front of a keyboard
all day, that can mean trying everything possible to reduce the number
of keys you actually have to hit each day.
<P>
Unfortunately, that can make it difficult for the rest of us.
<P>
You've already read about <TT>`bin'</TT> and <TT>`lost+found'</TT> directories,
<TT>`etc'</TT> is 
another seemingly interesting directory that turns out to be another 
place to store files used by the ftp site itself.  Again, nothing of any
real interest.
<P>
Then, once you get into the actual file libraries, you'll find that
in many cases, files will have such non-descriptive names as
<TT>`V1.1-AK.TXT'</TT>.
The best known example is probably a set of several hundred
files known as RFCs, which provide the basic technical and
organizational information on which much of the Internet is built.
These files can be found on many ftp sites, but always in a form such as
<TT>`RFC101.TXT'</TT>, <TT>`RFC102.TXT'</TT> and so on, with no clue whatsoever
as to what information they contain.
<P>
Fortunately, almost all ftp sites have a "Rosetta Stone" to help
you decipher these names.  Most will have a file named <TT>`README'</TT> (or some
variant) that gives basic information about the system.  Then, most
directories will either have a similar <TT>`README'</TT> file or will have an index
that does give brief descriptions of each file.  These are usually the
first file in a directory and often are in the form <TT>`00INDEX.TXT'</TT>.  Use
the ftp command to get this file.  You can then scan it online or
<A NAME="IDX360"></A>
download it to see which files you might be interested in.
<P>
Another file you will frequently see is called <TT>`ls-lgR.Z'</TT>.  This contains
a listing of every file on the system, but without any descriptions (the
name comes from the Unix command <SAMP>`ls -lgR'</SAMP>, which gives you a listing of all
the files in all your directories).  The <SAMP>`.Z'</SAMP> at the end means the file has
been compressed, which means you will have to use a Unix un-compress command
before you can read the file.
<P>
And finally, we have those system administrators who almost seem to
delight in making things difficult -- the ones who take full advantage of
Unix's ability to create absurdly long file names.  On some FTP sites, you
will see file names as long as 80 characters or so, full of capital letters,
underscores and every other orthographic device that will make it almost
impossible for you to type the file name correctly when you try to get it.
Your secret weapon here is the mget command.  Just type mget, a space, and
the first five or six letters of the file name, followed by an asterisk, for
example:
<P>
<PRE>
mget This_F*
</PRE>
<P>
The FTP site will ask you if you want to get the file that begins with that
name. If there are several files that start that way, you might have to
answer <SAMP>`n'</SAMP> a few times, but it's still easier than trying to recreate a
ludicrously long file name.

barely scratches the surface of what is available.  Liberal use of archie
will help you find specific files.

The <TT>`pub/usenet/rec.arts.books'</TT> directory has
reading lists for various authors as well as lists of recommended
bookstores in different cities.  Unfortunately, this site uses incredibly
long file names -- so long they may scroll off the end of your screen if
you are using an MS-DOS or certain other computers.  Even if you want
just one of the files, it probably makes more sense to use mget than get.
This way, you will be asked on each file whether you want to get it;
otherwise you may wind up frustrated because the system will keep telling
you the file you want doesn't exist (since you may miss the end of its
name due to the scrolling problem).

This carries one of the world's largest
collections of MS-DOS software. The files are actually copied, or
"mirrored"  from a computer at the U.S. Army's White Sands Missile Range 
(which uses ftp software that is totally incomprehensible).  It also
carries large collections of Macintosh, Windows, Atari, Amiga, Unix, OS9,
CP/M and Apple II software.  Look in the mirrors and systems directories.
The <TT>`gif'</TT> directory contains a large number of GIF graphics images.

means it is a visible-light photo taken by a weather satellite.  CI
images are similar, but use infrared light.  Both these are in black and
white.  Files that begin with SA are color radar maps of the U.S. that
show severe weather patterns but also fronts and temperatures in major
cities.  The numbers indicate the date and time (in GMT - five hours

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - ncftp</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_175.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_177.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC179" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC179">ncftp -- Now You Tell Me!</A></H2>
<P>
If you're lucky, the people who run your host system or public-
access site have installed a program called ncftp, which takes some of 
the edges off the ftp process.
<P>
For starters, when you use ncftp instead of plain old ftp, you no 
longer have to worry about misspelling "anonymous" when you connect.  The 
program does it for you.  And once you're in, instead of getting line 
after line filled with dashes, x's, r's and d's, you only get listings of 
the files or directories themselves (if you're used to MS-DOS, the 
display you get will be very similar to that produced by the <SAMP>`dir/w'</SAMP> 
command).  The program even creates a list of the ftp sites you've used 
most recently, so you can pick from that list, instead of trying to 
remember some incredibly complex ftp site name.
<P>
Launching the program, assuming your site has it, is easy.  At the 
command prompt, type
<P>
<PRE>
ncftp sitename
<A NAME="IDX431"></A>
<A NAME="IDX432"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
where "sitename" is the site you want to reach (alternately, you could 
type just ncftp and then use its open command).  Once connected, you can 
use the same ftp commands you've become used to, such as ls, get and 
mget.  Entries that end in a <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> are directories to which you can switch 
with <SAMP>`cd'</SAMP>; others are files you can get. A couple of useful ncftp commands 
include type, which lets you change the type of file transfer (from ASCII 
to binary for example) and size, which lets you see how large a file is 
before you get it, for example
<P>
<PRE>
size declaration.txt
</PRE>
<P>
would tell you how large the declaration.txt file is before you get it.  
When you say <SAMP>`bye'</SAMP> to disconnect from a site, ncftp remembers the last 
directory you were in, so that the next time you connect to the site, you 
are put back into that directory automatically. If you type <SAMP>`help'</SAMP>
you'll get a list of files you can read to extend the power of the 
program even further.

Project Gutenberg, coordinated by Michael Hart, has a fairly 
ambitious goal: to make more than 10,000 books and other documents 
available electronically by the year 2001.  In 1993, the project uploaded 
an average of four books a month to its ftp sites; in 1994, they hope to 
double the pace.
<P>
Begun in 1991, the project already maintains a "library" of hundreds 
of books and stories, from Aesop's Fables to "Through the Looking Glass" 
available for the taking.  It also has a growing number of current-affairs
documents, such as the CIA's annual "World Factbook" almanac.
<P>
Besides <B>nptn.org</B>, Project Gutenberg texts can be retrieved from 
<A NAME="IDX433"></A>
<B>mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu</B> in the etext directory.

<P>
Even with tools like Hytelnet and archie, telnet and ftp can still
be frustrating.  There are all those telnet and ftp addresses to
remember.  Telnet services often have their own unique commands.  And,
oh, those weird directory and file names!
<P>
But now that the Net has become a rich repository of information,
people are developing ways to make it far easier to find and retrieve 
information and files. Gophers and Wide-Area Information Servers (WAISs) 
are two services that could ultimately make the Internet as easy to 
navigate as commercial networks such as CompuServe or Prodigy.
<P>
Both gophers and WAISs essentially take a request for information 
and then scan the Net for it, so you don't have to.  Both also work 
through menus -- instead of typing in some long sequence of characters, 
you just move a cursor to your choice and hit enter.  Gophers even 
let you select files and programs from ftp sites this way. 
<P>
Let's first look at gophers (named for the official mascot of the 
<A NAME="IDX434"></A>
University of Minnesota, where the system was developed).
<P>
Many public-access sites now have gophers online.  To use one, type
<P>
<PRE>
gopher
</PRE>
<P>
at the command prompt and hit enter.  If you know your site does not have 
a gopher, or if nothing happens when you type that, telnet to
<P>
<PRE>
consultant.micro.umn.edu
</PRE>
<P>
At the log-in prompt, type
<P>
<PRE>
gopher
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You'll be asked what type of terminal emulation you're
using, after which you'll see something like this:

Press ? for Help, q to Quit, u to go up a menu      Page: 1/1
</PRE>
<P>
Assuming you're using VT100 or some other VT emulation, you'll be 
able to move among the choices with your up and down arrow keys.  When 
you have your cursor on an entry that looks interesting, just hit enter, 
and you'll either get a new menu of choices, a database entry form, or a 
text file, depending on what the menu entry is linked to (more on how to 
tell which you'll get in a moment).
<P>
Gophers are great for exploring the resources of the Net.  Just keep 
making choices to see what pops up.  Play with it; see where it takes 
you.  Some choices will be documents.  When you read one of these and 
either come to the end or hit a lower-case <SAMP>`q'</SAMP> to quit reading it, you'll 
be given the choice of saving a copy to your home directory or e-mailing 
it to yourself.  Other choices are simple databases that let you enter a 
word to look for in a particular database.  To get back to where you 
started on a gopher, hit your <SAMP>`u'</SAMP> key at a menu prompt, which will move you 
back "up" through the gopher menu structure (much like "cd .." in ftp).
<P>
Notice that one of your choices above is "Internet file server (ftp) 
sites."  Choose this, and you'll be connected to a modified archie 
program -- an archie with a difference.  When you search for a file 
through a gopher archie, you'll get a menu of sites that have the file 
you're looking for, just as with the old archie.  Only now, instead of 
having to write down or remember an ftp address and directory, all you 
have to do is position the cursor next to one of the numbers in the menu 
and hit enter.  You'll be connected to the ftp site, from which you can 
then choose the file you want.  This time, move the cursor to the file 
you want and hit a lower-case <SAMP>`s'</SAMP>.  You'll be asked for a name in your home 
directory to use for the file, after which the file will be copied to 
your home system.  Unfortunately, this file-transfer process does not yet 
work with all public-access sites for computer programs and compressed 
files.  If it doesn't work with yours, you'll have to get the file the 
old-fashioned way, via anonymous ftp. 
<P>
In addition to ftp sites, there are hundreds of databases and 
libraries around the world accessible through gophers.  There is not yet
a common gopher interface for library catalogs, so be prepared to follow
the online directions more closely when you use gopher to connect to
one.
<P>
Gopher menu entries that end in a <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> are gateways to another menu of 
options.  Entries that end in a period are text, graphics or program 
files, which you can retrieve to your home directory (or e-mail to 
yourself or to somebody else).  A line that ends in <SAMP>`&#60;?&#62;'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`&#60;CSO&#62;'</SAMP> 
represents a request you can make to a database for information.  The 
difference is that <SAMP>`&#60;?&#62;'</SAMP> entries call up one-line interfaces in which you 
can search for a keyword or words, while <SAMP>`&#60;CSO&#62;'</SAMP> brings up an electronic 
form with several fields for you to fill out (you might see this in 
online "White Pages" directories at colleges).
<P>
Gophers actually let you perform some relatively sophisticated 
Boolean searches.  For example, if you want to search only for files that 
contain the words "MS-DOS" and "Macintosh," you'd type
<P>
<PRE>
ms-dos and macintosh
</PRE>
<P>
(gophers are not case-sensitive) in the keyword field.  Alternately, if 
you want to get a list of files that mention either "MS-DOS" or 
"Macintosh," you'd type
<P>
<PRE>
ms-dos or macintosh

As fascinating as it can be to explore "gopherspace," you might one 
day want to quickly retrieve some information or a file.  Or you might 
grow tired of calling up endless menus to get to the one you want. 
Fortunately,  there are ways to make even gophers easier to use. 
<P>
One is with archie's friend, veronica (it allegedly is an acronym, 
but don't believe that for a second), who does for gopherspace what 
<A NAME="IDX435"></A>
archie does for ftp sites. 
<P>
In most gophers, you'll find veronica by selecting "Other gopher and 
information services" at the main menu and then "Searching through 
gopherspace using veronica."  Select this and you'll get something like 
this:

</PRE>
<P>
A few choices there!  First, the difference between searching 
directory titles and just plain ol' gopherspace.  If you already know the 
sort of directory you're looking for (say a directory containing MS-DOS 
programs), do a directory-title search.  But if you're not sure what kind 
of directory your information might be in, then do a general 
gopherspace search. In general, it doesn't matter which of the particular 
veronicas you use -- they should all be able to produce the same results.  
The reason there is more than one is because the Internet has become so 
popular that only one veronica (or one gopher or one of almost anything) 
would quickly be overwhelmed by all the information requests from around 
the world.  
<P>
You can use veronica to search for almost anything.  Want to find 
museums that might have online displays from their exhibits?  Try 
searching for "museum."  Looking for a copy of the Declaration of 
Independence?  Try "declaration." 
<P>
In many cases, your search will bring up a new gopher menu of 
choices to try.
<P>
Say you want to impress those guests coming over for dinner on 
Friday by cooking cherries flambe. If you were to call up veronica and 
type in "flambe" after calling up veronica, you would soon get a menu 
listing several flambe recipes, including one called "dessert flambe."  
Put your cursor on that line of the menu and hit enter, and you'll find 
it's a menu for cherries flambe.  Then hit your <SAMP>`q'</SAMP> key to quit, and gopher 
will ask you if you want to save the file in your home directory on your 
public-access site or whether you want to e-mail it somewhere. 
<P>
As you can see, you can use veronica as an alternative to archie, 
which, because of the Internet's growing popularity, seems to take longer 
and longer to work.
<P>
In addition to archie and veronica, we now also have jugheads (no 
bettys yet, though).  These work the same as veronicas, but their 
<A NAME="IDX436"></A>
searches are limited to the specific gopher systems on which they reside.
<P>
If there are particular gopher resources you use frequently, there 
are a couple of ways to get to them even more directly.
<P>
One is to use gopher in a manner similar to the way you can use 
telnet. If you know a particular gopher's Internet address (often the 
same as its telnet or ftp address), you can connect to it directly, 
rather than going through menus.  For example, say you want to use the 
gopher at <B>info.umd.edu</B>.  If your public-access site has a gopher system 
installed, type this 
<P>
<PRE>
gopher info.umd.edu
</PRE>
and you'll be connected.
<P>
But even that can get tedious if there are several gophers you use 
frequently. That's where bookmarks come in.  Gophers let you create a 
list of your favorite gopher sites and even database queries.  Then, 
instead of digging ever deeper into the gopher directory structure, you 
just call up your bookmark list and select the service you want.
<P>
To create a bookmark for a particular gopher site, first call up 
gopher.  Then go through all the gopher menus until you get to the menu 
you want.  Type a capital <SAMP>`A'</SAMP>. You'll be given a suggested name for the 
bookmark enty, which you can change if you want by backspacing over the 
suggestion and typing in your own.  When done, hit enter.  Now, whenever 
you're in gopherspace and want to zip back to that particular gopher 
service, just hit your <SAMP>`V'</SAMP> key (upper- or lower-case; in this instance, 
gopher doesn't care) anywhere within gopher.  This will bring up a list 
of your bookmarks. Move to the one you want and hit enter, and you'll be 
connected.
<P>
Using a capital <SAMP>`A'</SAMP> is also good for saving particular database or 
veronica queries that you use frequently (for example, searching for 
news stories on a particular topic if your public-access site maintains 
an indexed archive of wire-service news).
<P>
Instead of a capital <SAMP>`A'</SAMP>, you can also hit a lower-case <SAMP>`a'</SAMP>.  This will 
bring you to the particular line within a menu, rather than show you the 
<A NAME="IDX437"></A>
entire menu.
<P>
If you ever want to delete a bookmark, hit <SAMP>`V'</SAMP> within gopher, select 
the item you want to get rid of, and then hit your <SAMP>`D'</SAMP> key.
One more hint:
If you want to find the address of a particular gopher service, hit 
your <SAMP>`='</SAMP> key after you've highlighted its entry in a gopher menu.  You'll 
get back a couple of lines, most of which will be technicalese of no 
immediate value to most folks, but some of which will consist of the 
site's address.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Wide-Area Information Servers</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_206.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_208.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC210" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC210">Wide-Area Information Servers</A></H2>
<P>
Now you know there are hundreds of databases and library catalogs
you can search through.  But as you look, you begin to realize that each
seems to have its own unique method for searching.  If you connect to
several, this can become a pain.  Gophers reduce this problem somewhat.
<P>
Wide-area information servers promise another way to zero in on
information hidden on the Net. In a WAIS, the user sees only one
interface -- the program worries about how to access information on
dozens, even hundreds, of different databases.  You give a WAIS a
word and it scours the net looking for places where it's mentioned.  You
get a menu of documents, each ranked according to how relevant to your
search the WAIS thinks it is.
<P>
Like gophers, WAIS "client" programs can already be found on many
public-access Internet sites. If your system has a WAIS client, type 
<P>
<PRE>
swais
</PRE>
<P>
at the command prompt and hit enter (the "s" stands for "simple").  If it 
doesn't, telnet to bbs.oit.unc.edu, which is run by the University of North
Carolina  At the "login:" prompt, type
<P>
<PRE>
bbs
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You'll be asked to register and will then get a list of
"bulletins," which are various files explaining how the system works.
When done with those, hit your Q key and you'll get another menu.  Hit 4
for the "simple WAIS client," and you'll see something like this:

Keywords:

&#60;space&#62; selects, w for keywords, arrows move, &#60;return&#62; searches, q quits, ?
</PRE>
<P>
Each line represents a different database (the .au at the end of some of
them means they are in Australia; the .fr on the last line represents a
database in France).  And this is just the first page!  If you type a
capital K, you'll go to the next page (there are several pages).
Hitting a capital J will move you back a page.
<P>
The first thing you want to do is tell the WAIS program which
databases you want searched.  To select a database, move the cursor bar
over the line you want (using your down and up arrow keys) and hit your
space bar.  An asterisk will appear next to the line number.  Repeat this
until you've selected all of the databases you want searched.  Then hit
your W key, after which you'll be prompted for the key words you're
looking for.  You can type in an entire line of these words -- separate
each with a space, not a comma.
<P>
Hit return, and the search begins.
<P>
Let's say you're utterly fascinated with wheat.  So you might select
agricultural-market-news to find its current world price.  But you also
want to see if it has any religious implications, so you choose the
Bible and the Book of Mormon.  What do you do with the stuff?  Select
recipes and usenet-cookbook. Are there any recent Supreme Court
decisions involving the plant? Chose supreme-court.  How about synonyms?
Try roget-thesaurus and just plain thesaurus.
<P>
Now hit w and type in wheat.  Hit enter, and the WAIS program begins
its search.  As it looks, it tells you whether any of the databases are
offline, and if so, when they might be ready for a search.  In about a
minute, the program tells you how many hits it's found.  Then you get a new
menu, that looks something like this:

</PRE>
<P>
Each of these represents an article or citing that contains the word wheat,
or some related word.  Move the cursor bar (with the down and up arrow
keys) to the one you want to see, hit enter, and it will begin to appear
on your screen.  The "score" is a WAIS attempt to gauge how closely the
citing matches your request.  Doesn't look like the Supreme Court has had
anything to say about the plant of late!
<P>
Now think of how much time you would have spent logging onto various
databases just to find these relatively trivial examples.

<P>
Developed by researchers at <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/">CERN</A>, the European Particle Physics
Laboratory in Geneva, the World-Wide Web is somewhat similar to a WAIS.  
But it's designed on a system known as hypertext.  Words in one document
are "linked" to other documents.  It's sort of like sitting with an
encyclopedia -- you're reading an article, see a reference that 
intrigues you and so flip the pages to look up that reference.
<P>
To take a walk on <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/WWW/Geographical.html">The Web</A> try the WWW's (or W3 in the project's own jargon),
default telnet site:
<P>

info.cern.ch

No log in is needed.  When you connect, you'll see something like:

There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points
of view. If you have no other bias, here are some places to start:
   
by Subject[1]          A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete
                       but easiest to use.
                         
by Type[2]             Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may
                       allow to find things if you know what you are looking
                       for.
                         
About WWW[3]           About the World-Wide Web global information sharing

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Clients</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_208.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_210.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC212" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC212">Clients, or how to snare more on the Web</A></H2>
<P>
If you are used to plain-vanilla Unix or MS-DOS, then the way these
gophers and WAISs work seems quite straightforward.  But if you're used
to a computer with a graphical interface, such as a Macintosh, an IBM
compatible with Windows or a Next, you'll probably regard their
interfaces as somewhat primitive. And even to a veteran MS-DOS user, the 
World-Wide Web interface is rather clunky (and some of the documents and 
files on the Web now use special formatting that would confuse your poor 
<A NAME="IDX440"></A>
<A NAME="IDX441"></A>
<A NAME="IDX442"></A>
<A NAME="IDX443"></A>
<A NAME="IDX444"></A>
computer). 
<P>
There are, however, ways to integrate these services into your
graphical user interface.  In fact, there are now ways to tie into the
Internet directly, rather than relying on whatever interface your
public-access system uses, through what are known as "client" programs.  
These programs provide graphical interfaces for everything from ftp to 
the World-Wide Web.  
<P>
There is now a growing number of these "client" programs for
everything from ftp to gopher.  PSI of Reston, Va., which offers
nationwide Internet access, in fact, requires its customers to use these
programs. Using protocols known as SLIP and PPP, these programs communicate
with the Net using the same basic data packets as much larger computers
<A NAME="IDX445"></A>
<A NAME="IDX446"></A>
<A NAME="IDX447"></A>
online.
<P>
Beyond integration with your own computer's "desktop," client
programs let you do more than one thing at once on the net -- while you're
downloading a large file in one window, you can be chatting with a
friend through an Internet chat program in another.
<P>
Unfortunately, using a client program can cost a lot of money.  Some 
require you to be connected directly to the Internet through an Ethernet 
network for example.  Others work through modem protocols, such as SLIP, 
but public-access sites that allow such access may charge anywhere from 
<A NAME="IDX448"></A>
$25 to $200 a month extra for the service.
<P>
Your system administrator can give you more information on setting
up one of these connections.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - When Things Go Wrong VI</TITLE>

<H2><A NAME="SEC213" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC213">When Things Go Wrong</A></H2>
<P>
As the Internet grows ever more popular, its resources come under 
more of a strain.  If you try to use gopher in the middle of the day, at 
least on the East Coast of the U.S., you'll sometimes notice that it 
takes a very long time for particular menus or database searches to come 
up.  Sometimes, you'll even get a message that there are too many people 
connected to whichever service you're trying to use and so you can't get 
in.  The only alternative is to either try again in 20 minutes or so, or 
wait until later in the day, when the load might be lower.  When this 
happens in veronica, try one of the other veronica entries.
<P>
When you retrieve a file through gopher, you'll sometimes be asked 
if you want to store it under some ludicrously long name (there go our 
friends the system administrators again, using 128 characters just 
because Unix lets them).  With certain MS-DOS communications programs, if 
that name is longer than one line, you won't be able to backspace all the 
way back to the first line if you want to give it a simpler name.  
Backspace as far as you can.  Then, when you get ready to download it to 
your home computer, remember that the file name will be truncated on your 
end, because of MS-DOS's file-naming limitations.  Worse, your computer
might even reject the whole thing. What to do? Instead of saving it to
your home directory, mail it to yourself.  It should show up in your mail
by the time you exit gopher.  Then, use your mail command for saving it
to your home directory -- at which point you can name it anything you want.
Now you can download it.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Gophers FYI</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_210.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_212.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC214" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC214">FYI:</A></H2>
<P>
<B>David Riggins</B> maintains a list of gophers by type and category. You 
can find the most recent one at the ftp site <B>ftp.einet.net</B>, in the pub 
directory.  Look for a file with a name like <TT>`gopher-jewels.txt'</TT>. 
Alternately, you can get on a mailing list to get the latest version sent 
to your e-mailbox automatically. Send a mail message to
<TT>&lt;gopherjewelslist-request@tpis.cactus .org&gt;</TT>
(yep, that first part is all one word).  Leave 
the "subject:" line blank, and as a message, write SUBSCRIBE. 
<P>
The Interpedia project is an attempt to take gopher one step 
further, by creating an online repository of all of the interesting and 
useful information availble on the Net and from its users. To get on the 
mailing list for the project, send an e-mail message, with a "subject:" 
of "subscribe" to <TT>&lt;interpedia-request@telerama.lm.com&gt;</TT>.  You can get 
supporting documentation for the project via anonymous ftp at
<B>ftp.lm.com</B> 
in the <TT>`pub/interpedia'</TT> directory.
<P>
See also the Usenet newsgroups <TT>comp.infosystems.*</TT>:
<P>
<TT>comp.infosystems.gopher</TT>,
<TT>comp.infosystems.wais</TT>, and
<TT>comp.infosystems.www</TT> are places to go for technical discussions about
Gopher, WAISs, and the <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">World-Wide Web project</A> respectively.
Moreover there are <TT>comp.infosystems</TT> for more general discussion of
related issues.
The group <TT>comp.infosystems.gis</TT> relates to Geographic Information
Systems, and thus is more specialized on this subject.
<P>
At present, there are no veronica clients;  veronica is a gopher tool.
An informal veronica FAQ is posted regularly in <TT>comp.infosystems.gopher</TT>
and archived on <B>veronica.scs.unr.edu</B> as <TT>`veronica/veronica-faq'</TT>.
<P>
There even exists a Gopher service to read Usenet news:
<SAMP>`gopher gopher.msu.edu 4320'</SAMP>. But, the lines behind this
service are few, and thus it's likely that you get the following message,
when trying to enter:
<P>
<PRE>
We are sorry, but our Usenet News gateway limits the number of
simultaneous connections.  If you were attempting to read news and were
instead directed to this file, all of those connections are in use.  We
offer this gateway as a "last resort" for people who have no other
access for reading Usenet.  We do not have the capacity to serve as the
Usenet gateway for large numbers of users around the Internet.
Individuals who like this style of access should ask their Internet
service providers to offer the same sort of gateway on their local
Gopher server.  Individuals and campuses should consider installing
local news feeds and local news readers (such as RN, NN, TIN, or
Trumpet) so that users can read and post to Usenet newsgroups
conveniently.

For system administrators: the software we use to implement this gateway
is the go4gw Gopher gateway software from Roland Schemers of Stanford
University.  This software should be available by anonymous ftp from
boombox.micro.umn.edu, somewhere under /pub/gopher.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - The File is in the Mail</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_212.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_214.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC216" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC216">The File's in the Mail</A></H2>
E-mail by itself is a powerful tool, and by now you may be
sending e-mail messages all over the place.  You might even be on a
mailing list or two. But there is a lot more to e-mail than just
sending messages.  If your host system does not have access to ftp,
or it doesn't have access to every ftp site on the Net, you can have
programs and files sent right to your mailbox.  And using some simple
techniques, you can use e-mail to send data files such as spreadsheets,
or even whole programs, to friends and colleagues around the world.
<P>
A key to both is a set of programs known as encoders and
decoders.  For all its basic power, Net e-mail has a big problem: it
can't handle graphics characters or the control codes found in even
the simplest of computer programs. Encoders however, can translate
these into forms usable in e-mail, while decoders turn them back into
a form that you can actually use. If you are using a Unix-based host
system, chances are it already has an encoder and decoder online that
you can use. These programs will also let you use programs posted in
several Usenet newsgroups, such as <TT>comp.binaries.ibm.pc</TT>.
<P>
If both you and your intended recipient communicate via Unix-based
host systems, then it's pretty easy, because almost all Unix
host systems will have encoder/decoder programs online.
<P>
First, upload the file you want to send to your friend to your
host site.  Ask your system administrator how to upload a file to your
name or "home" directory.  Then type
<P>
<PRE>
uuencode file file &#62;file.uu
<A NAME="IDX449"></A>
<A NAME="IDX450"></A>
<A NAME="IDX451"></A>
<A NAME="IDX452"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter. "File" is the name of the file you want to prepare for
mailing, and yes, you have to type the name twice!  The &#62; is a Unix
command that tells the system to call the "encoded" file "file.uu"
(you could actually call it anything you want).
<P>
Now to get it into a mail message.  The quick and dirty way is to
type
<P>
<PRE>
mail friend
</PRE>
<P>
where "friend" is your friend's address.  At the subject line, tell
her the name of the enclosed file.  When you get the blank line, type
<P>
<PRE>
~r file.uu
</PRE>
<P>
or whatever you called the file, and hit enter. (on some systems, the <SAMP>`~'</SAMP>
may not work; if so, ask your system administrator what to use).  This
inserts the file into your mail message.  Hit control-D, and your file
is on its way!
<P>
On the other end, when your friend goes into his mailbox,  she
should transfer it to her home directory.  Then your friend should
type
<P>
<PRE>
uudecode file.name
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  This creates a new file in her name directory with
whatever name you originally gave it.  She can then download it to her
own computer.  Before she can actually use it, though, she'll have to
open it up with a text processor and delete the mail header that has
been "stamped" on it.  If you use a mailer program that automatically
appends a "signature," tell her about that so she can delete that as
well.

<H2><A NAME="SEC217" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC217">Receiving Files</A></H2>
<P>
If somebody sends you a file through the mail, you'll have to go 
through a couple of steps to get it into a form you can actually use.  If 
you are using the simple mail program, go into mail and type 
<P>
<PRE>
w # file.name
</PRE>
<P>
where <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> is the number of the message you want to transfer and 
<TT>`file.name'</TT> is what you want to call the resulting file.  In pine, call 
up the message and hit your O key and then E.  You'll then be asked 
for a file name. In elm, call up the message and hit your S key.  
You'll get something that looks like this: 
<P>
<PRE>
=file.request
</PRE>
<P>
Type a new file name and hit enter (if you hit enter without 
typing a file name, the message will be saved to another mail folder, 
not your home directory). 
<P>
In all three cases, exit the mail program to return to your host 
system's command line. Because the file has been encoded for mail 
delivery, you now have to run a decoder.  At the command line, type 
<P>
<PRE>
uudecode file.name
</PRE>
<P>
where <TT>`file.name'</TT> is the file you created while in mail. Uudecode will 
create a new, uncompressed binary file.  In some cases, you may have to 
run it through some other programs (for example, if it is in "tar" form), 
but generally it should now be ready for you to download to your own 
computer (on which you might then have to run a de-compressor program 
such as PKXZIP).

<H2><A NAME="SEC218" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC218">Sending Files to Non-Internet Sites</A></H2>
<P>
What if your friend only connects with a non-Unix system, such as 
CompuServe or MCIMail?  There are programs available for MS-DOS, Apple 
and Amiga computers that will encode and decode files.  Of course, since 
you can't send one of these programs to your friend via e-mail (how would 
she un-encode it?), you'll have to mail (the old-fashioned way) or give 
her a diskette with the program on it first.   Then, she can get the file 
by e-mail and go through the above process (only on her own computer) to 
get a usable file.  Remember to give her an encoder program as well, if 
she wants to send you files in return. 
<P>
For MS-DOS machines, you'll want to get uunecode.com and 
uudecode.com.  Both can be found through anonymous ftp at 
<B>wuarchive.wustl.edu</B> in the <TT>`/mirrors/msdos/starter'</TT> directory.
The MS-DOS version is as easy to use as the Unix one: Just type 
<P>
<PRE>
uudecode filename.ext
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.
<P>
Mac users should get a program called uutool, which can be found 
in the <TT>`info-mac/util'</TT> directory on <B>sumex-aim.stanford.edu</B>. 
<P>
Think twice before sending somebody a giant file. Although large 
sites connected directly to the Internet can probably handle mega-files, 
many smaller systems cannot. Some commercial systems, such as CompuServe 
and MCIMail, limit the size of mail messages their users can receive.  
Fidonet doesn't even allow encoded messages.  In general, a file size of 
30,000 or so bytes is a safe upper limit for non-Internet systems.

<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_215.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_217.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC219" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC219">Getting FTP Files via E-Mail</A></H2>
<P>
To help people without ftp access, a number of ftp sites have set up 
mail servers (also known as archive servers) that allow you to get files 
via e-mail.  You send a request to one of these machines and they send 
back the file you want.  As with ftp, you'll be able to find everything 
from historical documents to software (but please note that if you do 
have access to ftp, that method is always quicker and ties up fewer 
resources than using e-mail). 
<P>
Some interesting or useful mail servers include:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><TT>&lt;mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu&gt;</TT>
<DD>Files of "frequently asked questions" related to Usenet; state-by-state
lists of U.S. representatives and Senators and their addresses and office
phone numbers.
<P>
<DT><TT>&lt;archive-server@eff.org&gt;</TT>
<DD>Information about the Electronic Frontier
Foundation; documents about legal issues on the Net.
<P>
<DT><TT>&lt;archive-server@cs.widener.edu&gt;</TT>
<DD>Back copies of the Computer Underground
Digest and every possible fact you could want to know about "The
Simpsons."
<P>
<DT><TT>&lt;netlib@uunet.uu.net&gt;</TT>
<DD>Programs for many types of personal computers;
archives of past postings from many Usenet newsgroups.
<P>
<DT><TT>&lt;archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov&gt;</TT>
<DD>Space-related text and graphics
(GIF-format) files.
<P>
<DT><TT>&lt;service@nic.ddn.mil&gt;</TT>
<DD>Detailed information about Internet.
</DL>
<P>
Most mail servers work pretty much the same -- you send an e-mail 
message that tells them what file you want and how you want it sent to 
you.  The most important command is "send," which tells the computer you 
want it to send you a particular file. 
<P>
First, though, you'll need to know where the mail server stores 
that file, because you have to tell it which directory or sub-directory
it's in.  There are a couple of ways to do this. You can 
send an e-mail message to the archive-server that consists of one 
line: 
<P>
<PRE>
index
</PRE>
<P>
The server will then send you a directory listing of its main, or 
root directory.  You'll then have to send a second message to the 
archive server with one line: 
 
<PRE>
index directory/subdirectory
</PRE>
 
where that is the directory or directory path for which you want a 
listing.  An alternative is to send an e-mail message to our old 
friend archie, which should send you back the file's exact location on 
the archive-server (along with similar listings for all the other 
sites that may have the file, however)
<P>
Once you have the file name and its directory path, compose a 
message to the archive server like this:
 
<PRE>
send directory/subdirectory/file 
</PRE>
  
Send off the message and, anywhere from a few minutes to a couple 
of days later, you'll find a new message in your mailbox: a copy of the 
file you requested.  The exact time it will take a file to get to you 
depends on a variety of factors, including how many requests are in line 
before yours (mail servers can only process so many requests at a time) 
and the state of the connections between the server and you. 
<P>
Seems simple enough. It gets a little more complicated when you 
request a program rather than a document.  Programs or other files that 
contain unusual characters or lines longer than 130 characters (graphics 
files, for example) require special processing by both the mail server 
to ensure they are transmitted via e-mail.  Then you'll have to run them 
through at least one converter program to put them in a form you can 
actually use.  To ensure that a program or other "non-mailable" file 
actually gets to you, include another line in your e-mail message to the 
server: 
                                            
<PRE>
encoder                      
</PRE>
 
This converts the file into an encoded form.  To decode it, you'll 
first have to transfer the file message into a file in your home 
directory.  
<P>
One further complication comes when you request a particularly 
long file.  Many Net sites can only handle so much mail at a time.  To 
make sure you get the entire file, tell the mail server to break it up 
into smaller pieces, with another line in your e-mail request like 
this: 
 
<PRE>
size 100000
</PRE>
<P>
This gives the mail server the maximum size, in bytes, of each 
file segment.  This particular size is good for UUCP sites. Internet 
and Bitnet sites can generally go up to 300,000.  When you get all of 
these files in mail, transfer them to your home directory.  Exit mail 
and call up each file in your host system's text processor and delete 
each one's entire header and footer (or "signature" at the end).  When 
done with this, at your host system's command line, type 
 
<PRE>
cat file1 file2 &#62; bigfile
</PRE>
 
where file1 is the first file, file2 the second file, and so on.  The
<SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP> tells your host system to combine them into a new megafile called 
bigfile (or whatever you want to call it).  After you save the file to 
your home directory (see section <A HREF="bdg_214.html#SEC217">Receiving Files</A> above), you can then run uudecode, 
tar, etc. One word of caution, though: if the file you want is long 
enough that it has to be broken into pieces, think of how much time it's 
going to take you to download the whole thing -- especially if you're 
using a 2400-baud modem! 
<P>
There are a number of other mail servers.  To get a list, send an 
e-mail message to:
<P>
<TT>&lt;mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu&gt;</TT>
 
<PRE>
send usenet/comp.sources.wanted/How_to_find_sources_(READ_THIS_BEFORE_POSTING)
</PRE>
 
You'll have to spell it exactly as listed above.  Some mail 
servers use different software, which will require slightly different 
commands than the ones listed here.  In general, if you send a message 
to a mail server that says only 
 
<PRE>
help
</PRE>
 
you should get back a file detailing all of its commands. 
<P>
But what if the file you want is not on one of these mail 
servers?  That's where ftpmail comes in.  Run by Digital Equipment 
Corp. in California, this service can connect to almost any ftp site 
in the world, get the file you want and then mail it to you. Using it 
is fairly simple -- you send an e-mail message to ftpmail that 
includes a series of commands telling the system where to find the 
<A NAME="IDX453"></A>
<A NAME="IDX454"></A>
<A NAME="IDX455"></A>
file you want and how to format it to mail to you. 
<P>
Compose an e-mail message to
 
<PRE>
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
</PRE>
 
Leave the "subject:" line blank.  Inside the message, there are 
several commands you can give.  The first line should be 
 
<PRE>
reply address
</PRE>
 
where "address" is your e-mail address. The next line should be 
 
<PRE>
connect host
</PRE>
 
where "host" is the system that has the file you want (for example: 
<B>wuarchive.wustl.edu</B>). Other commands you should consider using are 
"binary" (required for program files); "compress" (reduces the file 
size for quicker transmission) and "uuencode" (which encodes the file 
so you can do something with it when it arrives).  The last line of 
your message should be the word "quit".  
<P>
Let's say you want a copy of the U.S. constitution.  Using archie, 
you've found a file called, surprise, constitution, at the ftp site 
<B>archive.cis.ohio-state.edu</B>, in the <TT>`/pub/firearms/politics/ rkba'</TT> 
directory. You'd send a message to <TT>&lt;ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com&gt;</TT> that looks 
like this: 
 
<PRE>
reply adamg@world.std.com
connect archive.cis.ohio-state.edu
binary
compress
uuencode
get pub/firearms/politics/rkba/constitution
quit
</PRE>
 
When you get the file in your mailbox, use the above procedure 
for copying it to a file.  Run it through uudecode.  Then type 
 
<PRE>
uncompress file.name
</PRE>
 
to make it usable.
<P>
Since this was a text file, you could have changed the "binary" to 
"ascii" and then eliminated the "uuencode" file.  For programs, though, 
you'll want to keep these lines.  One caveat with ftpmail: it has become 
such a popular service that it could take a week or more for your 
requested files to arrive.
<P>
We therefore strongly encourage you to "distribute" your requests over
the currently known "ftpmail" sites:

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - The all knowing Oracle</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_216.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_218.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC220" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC220">The all knowing Oracle</A></H2>
<P>
One other thing you can do through e-mail is consult with the
Usenet Oracle.  You can ask the Oracle anything at all and get back an
answer (whether you like the answer is another question).
<P>
First, you'll want to get instructions on how to address the Oracle 
(he, or she, or it, is very particular about such things and likes being 
addressed in august, solemn and particularly sycophantic tones).  Start 
<A NAME="IDX456"></A>
an e-mail message to 
<P>
<PRE>
oracle@iuvax.cs.indiana.edu
</PRE>
<P>
In the "Subject:" line, type
<P>
<PRE>
help
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You don't actually have to say anything in the message 
itself -- at least not yet.  Hit control-D to send off your request 
for help.  Within a few hours, the Oracle will mail you back detailed 
instructions.  It's a fairly long file, so before you start reading 
it, turn on your communications software's logging function, to save 
it to your computer (or save the message to a file on your host system's 
home directory and then download the file).  After you've digested it, 
you can compose your question to the Oracle.  Mail it to the above 
address, only this time with a subject line that describes your 
question.  Expect an answer within a couple of days. And don't be 
surprised if you also find a question in your mailbox -- the Oracle 
extracts payment by making seekers of knowledge answer questions as 
well!
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>"If just one piece of mail gets lost, well, they'll just think they
forgot to send it.  But if *two* pieces of mail get lost, hell, they'll
just think the other guy hasn't gotten around to answering his mail.
And if *fifty* pieces of mail get lost, can you imagine it, if *fifty*
pieces of mail get lost, why they'll think someone *else* is broken!
And if 1GB of mail gets lost, they'll just *know* that Arpa is down and
think it's a conspiracy to keep them from their God given right to receive Net Mail ..."</EM>

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Clarinet UPI</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_218.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_220.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC222" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC222">Clarinet: UPI, Dave Barry and Dilbert</A></H2>
<P>
     Usenet "newsgroups" can be something of a misnomer.  They may be 
interesting, informative and educational, but they are often not news, 
at least, not the way most people would think of them. But there are several 
sources of news and sports on the Net.  
<P>
     One of the largest is Clarinet, a company in Cupertino, Calf., that 
distributes wire-service news and columns, along with a news service 
<A NAME="IDX457"></A>
<A NAME="IDX458"></A>
devoted to computers and even the Dilbert comic strip, in Usenet form.  
<P>
     Distributed in Usenet form, Clarinet stories and columns are 
organized into more than 100 newsgroups (in this case, a truly 
appropriate name), some of them with an extremely narrow focus, for 
example, <TT>clari.news.gov.taxes</TT>.  The general news and sports come from 
United Press International; the computer news from the NewsBytes 
<A NAME="IDX459"></A>
<A NAME="IDX460"></A>
<A NAME="IDX461"></A>
service; the features from several syndicates. 
<P>
     Because Clarinet charges for its service, not all host systems 
carry its articles. Those that do carry them as Usenet groups starting 
with <TT>clari.*</TT>.  As with other Usenet hierarchies, these are named starting 
with broad area and ending with more specific categories.  Some of these 
include business news (<TT>clari.biz</TT>); general national and foreign news, 
politics and the like (<TT>clari.news</TT>), sports (<TT>clari.sports</TT>); columns by 
<VAR>Mike Royko</VAR>, <VAR>Miss Manners</VAR>, <VAR>Dave Barry</VAR> and others (<TT>clari.feature</TT>); and 
NewsBytes computer and telecommunications reports (<TT>clari.nb</TT>).  Because 
Clarinet started in Canada, there is a separate set of
<TT>clari.canada</TT> 
newsgroups.  The <TT>clari.nb</TT> newsgroups are divided into specific computer 
<A NAME="IDX462"></A>
<A NAME="IDX463"></A>
<A NAME="IDX464"></A>
types (<TT>clari.nb.apple</TT>, for example).
<P>
     Clari news groups feature stories updated around the clock.  There 
are even a couple of "bulletin" newsgroups for breaking stories: 
<TT>clari.news.bulletin</TT> and <TT>clari.news.urgent</TT>.  Clarinet also sets up new 
newsgroups for breaking stories that become ongoing ones (such as major 
natural disasters, coups in large countries and the like). 
<P>
     Occasionally, you will see stories in clari newsgroups that just 
don't seem to belong there.  Stories about former Washington, D.C. mayor 
<VAR>Marion Barry</VAR>, for example, often wind interspersed among columns by
<A NAME="IDX465"></A>
<A NAME="IDX466"></A>
<VAR>Dave Barry</VAR>.
<P>
     This happens because of the way wire services work.  UPI uses 
three-letter codes to route its stories to the newspapers and radio 
stations that make up most of its clientele, and harried editors on 
deadline sometimes punch in the wrong code.

<P>
If your host system doesn't carry the clari or <TT>msen.reuters</TT> 
newsgroups, you might be able to keep up with the news a different way 
over the Net.  USA Today has been something of an online newspaper 
pioneer, selling its stories to bulletin-board and online systems across 
the country for several years.  Cleveland Free-Net provides the online 
version of USA Today (along with all its other services) for free.  
Currently, the paper only publishes five days a week, so you'll have to 
<A NAME="IDX467"></A>
<A NAME="IDX468"></A>
get your weekend news fix elsewhere. 
<P>
Telnet: <B>freenet-in-a.cwru.edu</B> or
<B>freenet-in-b.cwru.edu</B>
<P>
After you connect and log in, look for this menu entry: NPTN/USA
TODAY HEADLINE NEWS.  Type the number next to it and hit enter.  You'll
then get a menu listing a series of broad categories, such as sports and
telecommunications.  Choose one, and you'll get a yet another menu,
listing the ten most recent dates of publication.  Each of these
contains one-paragraph summaries of the day's news in that particular
subject.

Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty are American radio stations
that broadcast to the former Communist countries of eastern Europe.
Every day, their news departments prepare a summary of news in those
countries, which is then disseminated via the Net, through a Bitnet 
mailing list and a Usenet newsgroup.
<P>
To have the daily digests sent directly to your e-mailbox, send a 
<A NAME="IDX469"></A>
<A NAME="IDX470"></A>
message to 
<P>
<PRE>
listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu
</PRE>
<P>
Leave the subject line blank, and as a message, write:
<P>
<PRE>
subscribe rferl-l Your Name
</PRE>
<P>
Alternately, look for the bulletins in the Usenet newsgroup
<TT>misc.news-east-europe.rferl</TT>.
<P>
Daily Brazilian news updates are available (in Portuguese) from the
University of Sao Paulo.  Use anonymous ftp to connect to
<P>
<PRE>
uspif.if.usp.br
</PRE>
<P>
Use <SAMP>`cd'</SAMP> to switch to the whois directory.  The news summaries are stored
in files with this form: <TT>`NEWS.23OCT92;1'</TT>.
But to get them, leave off the
semicolon and the 1, and don't capitalize anything, for example:
<P>
<PRE>
get news.23oct92

<P>
Daily summaries of news reports from France (in French) are availble 
on the National Capital FreeNet in Ottawa, Ont. Telnet to

Many Net systems provide access to a series of interactive
services that let you hold live "chats" or play online games with
people around the world.  To find out if your host system offers
these, you can ask your system administrator or just try them -- if
nothing happens, then your system does not provide them.  In general,
if you can use telnet and ftp, chances are good you can use these
services as well.

<H2><A NAME="SEC229" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC229">Talk</A></H2>
<P>
This is the Net equivalent of a telephone conversation and
requires that both you and the person you want to talk to have access
to this function and are online at the same time.  To use it, type
<P>
<PRE>
talk user@site.name
<A NAME="IDX471"></A>
<A NAME="IDX472"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
where <SAMP>`user@site.name'</SAMP> is the e-mail address of the other person.
She will see something like this on her screen: 
<P>
<PRE>
talk: connection requested by yourname@site.name
talk: respond with:  talk yourname@site.name
</PRE>
<P>
To start the conversation, she should then type (at her host system's
command line):
<P>
<PRE>
talk yourname@site.name
</PRE>
<P>
where that is your e-mail address.  Both of you will then get a top
and bottom window on your screen.  She will see everything you type in
one window; you'll see everything she types in the other.  To
disconnect, hit control-C.
<P>
One note: Public-access sites that use Sun computers sometimes have
trouble with the talk program.  If talk does not work, try typing
<SAMP>`otalk'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`ntalk'</SAMP>
instead.  However, the party at the other end will have to have the same
program online for the connection to work.

<P>
IRC is a program that lets you hold live keyboard conversations
with people around the world.  It's a lot like an international CB
radio  - it even uses "channels."  Type something on your computer and
it's instantly echoed around the world to whoever happens to be on the
same channel with you.  You can join in existing public group chats or
set up your own.  You can even create a private channel for yourself
and as few as one or two other people.  And just like on a CB radio,
you can give yourself a unique "handle" or nickname.
<P>
IRC currently links host systems in 20 different countries, from
Australia to Hong Kong to Israel.  Unfortunately, it's like telnet -- 
either your site has it or it doesn't.  If your host system does have it,  
<A NAME="IDX473"></A>
<A NAME="IDX474"></A>
Just type 
<P>
<PRE>
irc
<A NAME="IDX475"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You'll get something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
*** Connecting to port 6667 of server world.std.com

23:13 [1] adamg [Mail: 32] * type /help for help
</PRE>
<P>
You are now in channel 0, the "null" channel, in which you can look
up various help files, but not much else. As you can see, IRC takes over
your entire screen.  The top of the screen is where messages will
appear.  The last line is where you type IRC commands and messages.  All
IRC commands begin with a <SAMP>`/'</SAMP>.  The slash tells the computer you are about
to enter a command, rather than a message. To see what channels are
available, type
<P>
<PRE>
/list
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You'll get something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
*** Channel    Users  Topic

<P>
Because IRC allows for a large number of channels, the list might
scroll off your screen, so you might want to turn on your computer's
screen capture to capture the entire list.  Note that the channels
always have names, instead of numbers.  Each line in the listing tells
you the channel name, the number of people currently in it, and whether
there's a specific topic for it.  To switch to a particular channel,
type
<P>
<PRE>
/join #channel
</PRE>
<P>
where <SAMP>`#channel'</SAMP> is the channel name and hit enter.  Some "public"
channels actually require an invitation from somebody already on it.  To
request an invitation, type
<P>
<PRE>
/who #channel-name
</PRE>
<P>
where <SAMP>`channel-name'</SAMP> is the name of the channel, and hit enter.  Then ask
someone with an @ next to their name if you can join in.  Note that
whenever you enter a channel, you have to include the <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>.  Choose one
with a number of users, so you can see IRC in action.
<P>
If it's a busy channel, as soon as you join it, the top of your
screen will quickly be filled with messages.  Each will start with a
person's IRC nickname, followed by his message.
<P>
It may seem awfully confusing at first.  There could be two or
three conversations going on at the same time and sometimes the
messages will come in so fast you'll wonder how you can read them all.
<P>
Eventually, though, you'll get into the rhythm of the channel and
things will begin to make more sense.  You might even want to add your
two cents (in fact, don't be surprised if a message to you shows up on
your screen right away; on some channels, newcomers are welcomed
immediately).  To enter a public message, simply type it on that bottom
line (the computer knows it's a message because you haven't started the
line with a slash) and hit enter.
<P>
Public messages have a user's nickname in brackets, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;tomg&#62;
</PRE>
<P>
If you receive a private message from somebody, his name will be
between asterisks, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
*tomg*
</PRE>
<P>
For more information on using IRC, see the IRC command box.  You
can find discussions about IRC in the <TT>alt.irc</TT> newsgroup.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - IRC Commands</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_227.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_229.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC231" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC231">IRC Commands</A></H2>
<P>
Note: Hit enter after each command.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX476"></A>
<DT><CODE>/away</CODE>
<DD>When you're called away to put out a grease fire
in the kitchen, issue this command to let others know
you're still connected but just away from your terminal
or computer for awhile.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX477"></A>
<DT><CODE>/help</CODE>
<DD>Brings up a list of commands for which there is a help
file. You will get a "topic:" prompt.  Type in the
subject for which you want information and hit enter.
Hit enter by itself to exit help.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX478"></A>
<DT><CODE>/invite</CODE>
<DD>Asks another IRC to join you in a conversation.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX479"></A>
<DT><CODE>/invite fleepo #hottub</CODE>
<DD>would send a message to fleepo asking him to join you on
the #hottub channel.  The channel name is optional.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX480"></A>
<DT><CODE>/join</CODE>
<DD>Use this to switch to or create a particular channel,
like this: <SAMP>`/join #hottub'</SAMP>
<P>
If one of these channels exists and is not a private
one, you will enter it.  Otherwise, you have just
created it. Note you have to use a <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> as the first
character.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX481"></A>
<DT><CODE>/list</CODE>
<DD>This will give you a list of all available public
channels, their topics (if any) and the number of users
currently on them.  Hidden and private channels are not
shown.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX482"></A>
<DT><CODE>/m name</CODE>
<DD>Send a private message to that user.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX483"></A>
<DT><CODE>/mode</CODE>
<DD>This lets you determine who can join a channel you've
created.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX484"></A>
<DT><CODE>/mode #channel +s</CODE>
<DD>creates a secret channel.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX485"></A>
<DT><CODE>/mode #channel +p</CODE>
<DD>makes the channel private
<P>
<A NAME="IDX486"></A>
<DT><CODE>/nick</CODE>
<DD>This lets you change the name by which others see you.
<P>
<SAMP>`/nick fleepo'</SAMP>
would change your name for the present session to
fleepo. People can still use /whois to find your e-mail
address.  If you try to enter a channel where somebody
else is already using that nickname, IRC will ask you to
select another name.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX487"></A>
<DT><CODE>/query</CODE>
<DD>This sets up a private conversation between you and
another IRC user.  To do this, type
<SAMP>`/query nickname'</SAMP>
<P>
Every message you type after that will go only to that
person.  If she then types
<SAMP>`/query nickname'</SAMP>
where nickname is yours, then you have established a
private conversation.  To exit this mode, type
<SAMP>`/query'</SAMP>
by itself.  While in query mode, you and the other
person can continue to "listen" to the discussion on
whatever public channels you were on, although neither
of you will be able to respond to any of the messages
there.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX488"></A>
<DT><CODE>/quit</CODE>
<DD>Exit IRC.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX489"></A>
<DT><CODE>/signoff</CODE>
<DD>Exit IRC.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX490"></A>
<DT><CODE>/summon</CODE>
<DD>Asks somebody connected to a host system with IRC to
join you on IRC. You must use the person's entire e-mail
address.
<P>
<SAMP>`/summon fleepo@foo.bar.com'</SAMP>
would send a message to fleepo asking him to start IRC.
Usually not a good idea to just summon people unless you
know they're already amenable to the idea; otherwise you
may wind up annoying them no end. This command does not
work on all sites.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX491"></A>
<DT><CODE>/topic</CODE>
<DD>When you've started a new channel, use this command to let
others know what it's about.
<P>
<SAMP>`/topic #Amiga'</SAMP>
would tell people who use /list that your channel is meant
for discussing Amiga computers.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX492"></A>
<DT><CODE>/who &#60;chan&#62;</CODE>
<DD>Shows you the e-mail address of people on a particular
channel.
<P>
<SAMP>`/who #foo'</SAMP>
would show you the addresses of everybody on channel foo.
<P>
<SAMP>`/who'</SAMP>
by itself shows you every e-mail address for every person
on IRC at the time, although be careful: on a busy night
you might get a list of 500 names!
<P>
<A NAME="IDX493"></A>
<DT><CODE>/whois</CODE>
<DD>Use this to get some information about a specific IRC
user or to see who is online.
<P>
<SAMP>`/whois nickname'</SAMP>
will give you the e-mail address for the person using
that nickname.
<P>
<SAMP>`/whois *'</SAMP>
will list everybody on every channel.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX494"></A>
<DT><CODE>/whowas</CODE>
<DD>Similar to <SAMP>`/whois'</SAMP>; gives information for people who
recently signed off IRC.

<H2><A NAME="SEC232" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC232">IRC in Times of Crisis</A></H2>
IRC has become a new medium for staying on top of really big 
breaking news.  In 1993, when Russian lawmakers barricaded themselves 
inside the parliament building, some enterprising Muscovites and a couple 
of Americans set up a "news channel" on IRC to relay first-person 
accounts direct from Moscow. The channel was set up to provide a 
continuous loop of information, much like all-news radio stations that 
cycle through the day's news every 20 minutes.  In 1994, Los Angeles 
residents set up a similar channel to relay information related to the 
Northridge earthquake.  In both cases, logs of the channels were archived 
somewhere on the Net, for those unable to "tune in" live.
<P>
How would you find such channels in the future?  Use the <SAMP>`/list'</SAMP> 
command to scroll through the available channels.  If one has been set up 
to discuss a particular breaking event, chances are you'll see a brief 
description next to the channel name that will tell you that's the place 
to tune.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - MUDs</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_229.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_231.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC233" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC233">MUDs</A></H2>
<P>
Multiple-User Dimensions or Dungeons (MUDs) take IRC into the DUM
realm of fantasy.  MUDs are live, role-playing games in which you
enter assume a new identity and enter an alternate reality through
your keyboard.  As you explore this other world, through a series of
simple commands (such as "look," "go" and "take"), you'll run across
other users, who may engage you in a friendly discussion, enlist your
<A NAME="IDX495"></A>
<A NAME="IDX496"></A>
<A NAME="IDX497"></A>
aid in some quest or try to kill you for no apparent reason.
<P>
Each MUD has its own personality and creator (or God) who was
willing to put in the long hours required to establish the particular
MUD's rules, laws of nature and information databases.  Some MUDs
stress the social aspects of online communications -- users frequently
gather online to chat and join together to build new structures or
even entire realms.  Others are closer to "Dungeons and Dragons" and
are filled with sorcerers, dragons and evil people out to keep you
<A NAME="IDX498"></A>
from completing your quest -- through murder if necessary.
<P>
Many MUDs (there are also related games known as MUCKs and MUSEs)
require you to apply in advance, through e-mail, for a character name
and password.  One that lets you look around first, though, is
HoloMuck at McGill University in Montreal.  The premise of this game
is that you arrive in the middle of Tanstaafl, a city on the planet
Holo.  You have to find a place to live (else you get thrown into the
homeless shelter) and then you can begin exploring.  Magic is allowed
on this world, but only outside the city limits.  Get bored with the
city and you can roam the rest of the world or even take a trip into
orbit (of course, all this takes money; you can either wait for your
weekly salary or take a trip to the city casino).  Once you become
familiar with the city and get your own character, you can even begin
erecting your own building (or subway line, or almost anything else).
<P>
To connect, telnet to
<B>hobbes.cs.mcgill.ca 5757</B>
<P>
When you connect, type
<P>
<PRE>
connect guest guest
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  This connects you to the "guest" account, which
has a password of "guest."
You'll see this:
<P>
<PRE>
The Homeless Shelter(#22Rna)
You wake up in the town's Homeless Shelter, where vagrants are put for
protective holding.
Please don't sleep in public places-- there are plenty of
open apartments available.  Type 'apartments' to see how to get to an          
apartment building with open vacancies.                                      
There is a small sign on the wall here, with helpful information.
Type 'look sign' to read it.
The door is standing open for your return to respectable society.
Simply walk 'out' to the center.
</PRE>
<P>
Of course, you want to join respectable society, but first you
want to see what that sign says.  So you type
<P>
<PRE>
look sign
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter, which brings up a list of some basic commands.  Then
you type
<P>
<PRE>
out
</PRE>
<P>
followed by enter, which brings up this:
<P>
<PRE>
You slip out the door, and head southeast...
Tanstaafl Center
This is the center of the beautiful town of Tanstaafl.
High Street runs north and south into residential areas, while
Main Street runs east and west into business districts.
SW: is Tanstaafl Towers.
Please claim an apartment... no sleeping in public!
SE: the Public Library offers both information and entertainment.
NW: is the Homeless Shelter, formerly the Town Jail.
NE: is Town Hall, site of several important services, including: Public
Message Board, Bureau of Land Management (with maps and regulations), and
other governmental/ bureaucratic help.
Down: Below a sign marked with both red and blue large letter 'U's, a
staircase leads into an underground subway passage.
(Feel free to 'look' in any direction for more information.)
[Obvious exits: launch, d, nw, se, w, e, n, s, ne, sw]
Contents:
Instructions for newcomers
Directional signpost
Founders' statue
</PRE>
<P>
To see "Instructions for newcomers", type
<P>
<PRE>
look Instructions for newcomers
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You could do the same for "Directional signpost" and
"Founders' statue."  Then type
<P>
<PRE>
SW
</PRE>
<P>
and enter to get to Tanstaafl Towers, the city housing complex, where
you have to claim an apartment (you may have to look around; many will
already be occupied).  And now it's off to explore Holo!  One command
you'll want to keep in mind is "take." Periodically, you'll come
across items that, when you take them will confer certain abilities or
powers on you.  If you type
<P>
<PRE>
help
</PRE>
<P>
and enter, you'll get a list of files you can read to learn more about
the MUD's commands.
<P>
The "say" command lets you talk to other players publicly. For
example,
<P>
<PRE>
say Hey, I'm here!
</PRE>
<P>
would be broadcast to everybody else in the room with you.  If you
want to talk to just one particular person, use "whisper" instead of
"say."
<P>
<PRE>
whisper agora=Hey, I'm here!
</PRE>
<P>
would be heard only by agora.  Another way to communicate with
somebody regardless of where on the world they are is through your
pager.  If you suddenly see yours go off while visiting, chances are
it's a wizard checking to see if you need any help.  To read his
<A NAME="IDX499"></A>
message, type
<P>
<PRE>
page
</PRE>
<P>
To send him a message, type
<P>
<PRE>
page name=message
</PRE>
<P>
where name is the wizard's name (it'll be in the original message).
<P>
Other MUDs and MUCKs may have different commands, but generally
use the same basic idea of letting you navigate through relatively
simple English commands.
<P>
When you connect to a MUD, choose your password as carefully as
you would one for your host system; alas, there are MUD crackers who
enjoy trying to break into other people's MUD accounts.  And never,
never use the same password as the one you use on your host system!
<P>
MUDs can prove highly addicting.  "The jury is still out on
whether MUDding is 'just a game'  or 'an extension of real life with
gamelike qualities'," says <VAR>Jennifer Smith</VAR>, an active MUD player who
<A NAME="IDX500"></A>
wrote an FAQ on the subject.
<P>
She adds one caution: "You shouldn't do anything that you
wouldn't do in real life, even if the world is a fantasy world.  The
important thing to remember is that it's the fantasy world of possibly
hundreds of people, and not just yours in  particular.  There's a
human being on the other side of each and every wire!  Always remember
that you may meet these other people some day,  and they may break
your nose.  People who treat others badly gradually build up bad
reputations and eventually receive the NO FUN Stamp of Disapproval."

<H2><A NAME="SEC235" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC235">The other Side of the Coin</A></H2>
<P>
All is not fun and games on the Net.  Like any community, the Net
has its share of obnoxious characters who seem to exist only to make
your life miserable (you've already met some of them in section <A HREF="bdg_64.html#SEC67">Usenet: the Global Watering Hole</A>).
There are people who seem to spend a bit more time on the Net than many 
would find healthy.  It also has its criminals.  <VAR>Clifford Stoll</VAR> writes in 
<i>The Cuckoo's Egg</I> how he tracked a team of German hackers who were 
breaking into U.S. computers and selling the information they found to 
the Soviets.  <VAR>Robert Morris</VAR>, a Cornell University student, was convicted 
of unleashing a "worm" program that effectively disabled several thousand 
<A NAME="IDX501"></A>
<A NAME="IDX502"></A>
<A NAME="IDX503"></A>
computers connected to the Internet.  
<P>
Of more immediate concern to the average Net user are crackers
who seek to find other's passwords to break into Net systems and people
who infect programs on ftp sites with viruses.
<P>
There is a widely available program known as "Crack" that can
decipher user passwords composed of words that might be found in a
dictionary (this is why you shouldn't use such passwords).  Short of
that, there are the annoying types who take a special thrill in trying to 
make you miserable.  The best advice in dealing with them is to count to 
10 and then ignore them -- like juveniles everywhere, most of their fun 
comes in seeing how upset you can get. 
<P>
Meanwhile, two Cornell University students pleaded guilty in 1992 to
uploading virus-infected Macintosh programs to ftp sites.  If you plan
to try out large amounts of software from ftp sites, it might be wise to
download or buy a good anti-viral program.
<P>
But can law enforcement go too far in seeking out the criminals?
The Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded in large part in
response to a series of government raids against an alleged gang of
hackers.  The raids resulted in the near bankruptcy of one game
company never alleged to have had anything to do with the hackers,
when the government seized its computers and refused to give them
back.  The case against another alleged participant collapsed in court
when his attorney showed the "proprietary" and supposedly hacked
information he printed in an electronic newsletter was actually
available via an 800 number for about $13 -- from the phone company
from which that data was taken.

<H2><A NAME="SEC238" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC238">The Net in the Classroom</A></H2>
<P>
If you're a teacher, you've probably already begun to see the
potential the Net has for use in the class.  Usenet, ftp and telnet have
tremendous educational potential, from keeping up with world events to
arranging international science experiments.
<P>
Because the Net now reaches so many countries and often stays
online even when the phones go down, you and your students can  "tune
in" to first-hand accounts during international conflicts.  Look at
your system's list of Usenet <TT>soc.culture.*</TT> groups to see if
there is one
about the country or region you're interested in.  Even in peacetime,
these newsgroups can be great places to find people from countries you
might be studying.
<P>
The biggest problem may be getting accounts for your students, if
you're not lucky enough to live within the local calling area of a
Free-Net system. Many colleges and universities, however, are willing
to discuss providing accounts for secondary students at little or no
cost.  Several states, including California and Texas, have
Internet-linked networks for teachers and students.
<P>
In addition, there are a number of resources on the Internet aimed
specifically at elementary and secondary students and teachers.  You
can use these to set up science experiments with classes in another
country, learn how to use computers in the classroom or keep up with the
latest advances in teaching everything from physics to physical
education.
<P>
Some of these resources are listed in the follwoing.

Begun on the Fidonet hobbyist network, K12Net is now also
carried on many Usenet systems and provides a host of interesting and
valuable services.  These include international chat for students,
foreign-language discussions (for example, there are French and
German-only conference where American students can practice those languages
with students from Quebec and German).  There are also conferences aimed
at teachers of specific subjects, from physical education to physics.
The K12 network still has limited distribution, so ask your

If your system doesn't carry K12, but has access to
telnet, you can reach it through SpaceMet Forum, a bulletin-board system
aimed at teachers and students that is run by the physics and astronomy
department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  The address
is <B>spacemet.phast.umass.edu</B>.  When you connect, hit escape once.
Like K12, SpaceMet Forum began as a Fidonet system, but has since
grown much larger.  Mort and Helen Sternheim, professors at the
university, started SpaceMet as a one-line bulletin-board system several
years ago to help bolster middle-school science education in nearby
<A NAME="IDX512"></A>
towns.
<P>
Today, there is a whole series of satellite SpaceMet BBSs in
western Massachusetts and SpaceMet itself is now linked to Fidonet and
Internet.
<P>
In addition to the K12 conferences, SpaceMet carries numerous
educationally oriented conferences.  It also has a large file library of
interest to educators and students, but be aware that getting files to
your site could be difficult and maybe even impossible.  Unlike most
other Internet sites, Spacemet does not use an ftp interface. The
Sternheims say ZMODEM sometimes works over the network, but don't count
on it.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Usenet and Bitnet in the Classroom</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_248.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_250.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC252" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC252">Usenet and Bitnet in the Classroom</A></H2>
There are numerous Usenet newsgroups of potential interest to
teachers and students (see section <A HREF="bdg_64.html#SEC67">Usenet: the Global Watering Hole</A>).
<P>
As you might expect, many are of a scientific bent. You can find
these by typing <SAMP>`l sci.'</SAMP> in rn or using <SAMP>`nngrep sci.'</SAMP> for nn.
There are now
close to 40, with subjects ranging from archaeology to economics (the
"dismal science," remember?) to astronomy to nanotechnology (the
construction of microscopically small machines).
<P>
One thing students will quickly learn from many of these groups:
science is not just dull, boring facts.  Science is argument and
standing your ground and making your case.  The Usenet <TT>sci.*</TT> groups
encourage critical thinking.
<P>
Beyond science, social-studies and history classes can keep busy
learning about other countries, through the <TT>soc.culture.*</TT> newsgroups.
<P>
Most of these newsgroups originated as ways for expatriates of a
given country to keep in touch with their homeland and its culture.  In
times of crisis, however, these groups often become places to
disseminate information from or into the country and to discuss what is
happening.  From Afghanistan to Yugoslavia, close to 50 countries are
now represented on Usenet.
To see which groups are available, use <SAMP>`l soc.culture.'</SAMP> in rn or
<SAMP>`nngrep soc.culture.'</SAMP> for nn.
<P>
One caveat:  Teachers might want to peruse particular newsgroups 
before setting their students loose in them.  Some have higher levels of 
flaming and blather than others.
<P>
Several "talk" newsgroups provide additional topical discussions,
but teachers should screen them first before recommending them to
students.  They range from <TT>talk.abortion</TT>, via
<TT>talk.politics. guns</TT> to
<A NAME="IDX519"></A>
<TT>talk.politics.space</TT>, and <TT>talk.environment</TT>.
<P>
There are also a number of Bitnet discussion groups of potential
interest to students and teachers.
See section <A HREF="bdg_86.html#SEC89">Mailing Lists and Bitnet</A>
for information on
finding and subscribing to Bitnet discussion groups.  Some with an
educational orientation include:
<P>

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Setting Up Shop</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_251.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_253.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC255" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC255">Setting Up Shop</A></H2>
<P>
Back in olden days, oh, before 1990 or so, there were no markets in 
the virtual community -- if you wanted to buy a book, you still had to 
jump in your car and drive to the nearest bookstore.
<P>
This was because in those days, the Net consisted mainly of a series 
of government-funded networks on which explicit commercial activity was 
forbidden.  Today, much of the Net is run by private companies, which 
generally have no such restrictions, and a number of companies have begun 
experimenting with online "shops" or other services.  Many of these shops 
are run by booksellers, while the services range from delivery of indexed 
copies of federal documents to an online newsstand that hopes to entice 
you to subscribe to any of several publications (of the printed on paper 
variety).  A number of companies also use Usenet newsgroups (in the biz 
hierarchy) to distribute press releases and product information.
<P>
Still, commercial activity on the remains far below that found on 
other networks, such as CompuServe, with its Electronic Mall, or Prodigy, 
with its advertisements on almost every screen.  In part that's because 
of the newness and complexity of the Internet as a commercial medium.  In 
part, however, that is because of security concerns.  Companies worry 
about such issues as crackers getting into their system over the network, 
and many people do not like the idea of sending a credit-card number via 
the Internet (an e-mail message could be routed through several sites to 
get to its destination).  These concerns could disappear as Net users 
turn to such means as message encryption and "digital signatures." In the 
meantime, however, businesses on the Net can still consider themselves 
<A NAME="IDX521"></A>
<A NAME="IDX522"></A>
something of Internet pioneers. 
<P>
A couple of public-access sites and a regional network have set up 
"marketplaces" for online businesses. 
<P>
The World in Brookline, Mass., currently rents "space" to several 
bookstores and computer-programming firms, as well as an "adult toy 
shop."  To browse their offerings, use gopher to connect to
<P>

world.std.com
</PRE>
<P>
At the main menu, select "Shops on the World."
<P>
Msen in Ann Arbor provides its "Msen Marketplace," where you'll find 
a travel agency and an "Online Career Center" offering help-wanted ads 
from across the country.  Msen also provides an "Internet Business 
Pages," an online directory of companies seeking to reach the Internet 
community.  You can reach Msen through gopher at

<iMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC=logos/bdgtti.gif>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX523"></A>
<EM>The revolution is just beginning.</EM>
<P>
New communications systems and digital technologies have already
meant dramatic changes in the way we live.  Think of what is already
routine that would have been considered impossible just ten years ago.
You can browse through the holdings of your local library -- or of
libraries halfway around the world -- do your banking and see if your
neighbor has gone bankrupt, all through a computer and modem.
<P>
Imploding costs coupled with exploding power are bringing ever
more powerful computer and digital systems to ever growing numbers of
people.  The Net, with its rapidly expanding collection of databases
and other information sources, is no longer limited to the
industrialized nations of the West; today the web extends into once
remote areas from Siberia to Zimbabwe. The cost of computers and
modems used to plug into the Net, meanwhile, continue to plummet,
making them ever more affordable.
<P>
Cyberspace has become a vital part of millions of people's daily
lives. People form relationships online, they fall in love, they get
married, all because of initial contacts in cyberspace, that ephemeral
"place" that transcends national and state boundaries. Business
deals are transacted entirely in ASCII.  Political and social
movements begin online, coordinated by people who could be thousands
<A NAME="IDX524"></A>
of miles apart.
<P>
<EM>Yet this is only the beginning.</EM>
<P>
We live in an age of communication, yet, the various media we use
to talk to one another remain largely separate systems. One day,
however, your telephone, TV, fax machine and personal computer will be
replaced by a single "information processor" linked to the worldwide
Net by strands of optical fiber.
<P>
Beyond databases and file libraries, power will be at your
fingertips. Linked to thousands, even millions of like-minded people,
you'll be able to participate in social and political movements across
the country and around the world.
<P>
How does this happen? In part, it will come about through new
technologies. High-definition television will require the development
of inexpensive computers that can process as much information as
today's workstations.  Telephone and cable companies will compete to
see who can bring those fiber-optic cables into your home first.  
High-speed data networks, such as the Internet, will be replaced by even more
powerful systems.
<P>
The Clinton administration, arguably the first led by people who 
know how to use not only computer networks but computers, is pushing for 
creation of a series of "information superhighways" comparable in scope 
to the Interstate highway system of the 1950s (one of whose champions in 
<A NAME="IDX525"></A>
<A NAME="IDX526"></A>
the Senate has a son elected vice president in 1992).    
<P>
Right now, we are in the network equivalent of the early 1950s, 
just before the creation of that massive highway network. Sure, there are 
plenty of interesting things out there, but you have to meander along 
two-lane roads, and have a good map, to get to them. 
<P>
Creation of this new Net will also require a new communications
paradigm: the Net as information utility.  The Net remains a somewhat
complicated and mysterious place.  To get something out of the Net
today, you have to spend a fair amount of time with a Net veteran or a
manual like this.  You have to learn such arcana as the vagaries of the
Unix cd command.
<P>
Contrast this with the telephone, which now also provides access to
large amounts of information through push buttons, or a computer network
such as Prodigy, which one navigates through simple commands and mouse
<A NAME="IDX527"></A>
clicks.
<P>
Internet system administrators have begun to realize that not all 
people want to learn the intricacies of Unix, and that that fact does 
not make them bad people.  We are already seeing the development of 
simple interfaces that will put the Net's power to use by millions of 
people.  You can already see their influence in the menus of gophers and 
the World-Wide Web, which require no complex computing skills but which 
open the gates to thousands of information resources.  Mail programs and 
text editors such as Pico and Pine promise much of the power of older 
<A NAME="IDX528"></A>
<A NAME="IDX529"></A>
<A NAME="IDX530"></A>
programs such as emacs at a fraction of the complexity. 
<P>
Some software engineers are looking at taking this even further, by
creating graphical interfaces that will let somebody navigate the
Internet just by clicking on the screen with a mouse or by calling up an
easy text editor, sort of the way one can now navigate a Macintosh
computer -- or a commercial online service such as Prodigy.
<P>
<EM>Then there are the Internet services themselves.</EM>
<P>
For every database now available through the Internet, there are
probably three or four that are not.  Government agencies are only
slowly beginning to connect their storehouses of information to the
Net. Several commercial vendors, from database services to booksellers,
have made their services available through the Net.
<P>
Few people now use one of the Net's more interesting
applications.  A standard known as MIME lets one send audio and
graphics files in a message.  Imagine opening your e-mail one day to hear
your granddaughter's first words, or a "photo" of your friend's new
house.  Eventually, this standard could allow for distribution of even
<A NAME="IDX531"></A>
small video displays over the Net.
<P>
All of this will require vast new amounts of Net power, to handle
both the millions of new people who will jump onto the Net and the new
applications they want.  Replicating a moving image on a computer screen
alone takes a phenomenal amount of computer bits, and computing power to
arrange them.
<P>
All of this combines into a National Information Infrastructure able 
to move billions of bits of information in one second -- the kind of 
<A NAME="IDX532"></A>
power needed to hook information "hoses" into every business and house.
<P>
As these "superhighways" grow, so will the "on ramps," for a high-speed
road does you little good if you can't get to it.   The costs of 
modems seem to fall as fast as those of computers.  High-speed modems 
<A NAME="IDX533"></A>
(9600 baud and up) are becoming increasingly affordable.  At 9600 baud,
you can download a satellite weather image of North America in less than 
two minutes, a file that, with a slower modem could take up to 20 
minutes to download.  Eventually, homes could be connected directly to a 
national digital network.  Most long-distance phone traffic is already 
carried in digital form, through high-volume optical fibers.  Phone 
companies are ever so slowly working to extend these fibers the "final 
mile" to the home.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation is working to 
ensure these links are affordable. 
<P>
Beyond the technical questions are increasingly thorny social,
political and economic issues. Who is to have access to these
services, and at what cost?  If we live in an information age, are we
laying the seeds for a new information under class, unable to compete
with those fortunate enough to have the money and skills needed to
manipulate new communications channels? Who, in fact, decides who has
access to what?  As more companies realize the potential profits to be
made in the new information infrastructure, what happens to such
systems as Usenet, possibly the world's first successful anarchistic
system, where everybody can say whatever they want?
<P>
What are the laws of the electronic frontier?  When national and
state boundaries lose their meaning in cyberspace,  the question might
even be: WHO is the law?  What if a practice that is legal in one
country is "committed" in another country where it is illegal, over a
computer network that crosses through a third country? Who goes after
computer crackers?

<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> In 1988, <i>Whole Earth Review</I> published my article, "Virtual
Communities." Four years later, I reread it and realized that I had
learned a few things, and that the world I was observing had changed.
So I rewrote it. The original version is available on the WELL as

Portions of this will appear in <i>Globalizing Networks: Computers and

into Whole Earth Review.
<P>
This is a world-readable file, and I think these are important issues;
encourage distribution, but I do ask for fair use: Don't remove my name
from my words when you quote or reproduce them, don't change them, and
don't impair my ability to make a living with them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
    I'm a writer, so I spend a lot of time alone in a room with my words
and my thoughts. On occasion, I venture outside to interview people or
to find information. After work, I reenter the human community, via my
family, my neighborhood, my circle of acquaintances. But that regime
left me feeling isolated and lonely during the working day, with few
opportunities to expand my circle of friends. For the past seven years,
however, I have participated in a wide-ranging, intellectually
stimulating, professionally rewarding, sometimes painful, and often
intensely emotional ongoing interchange with dozens of new friends,
hundreds of colleagues, thousands of acquaintances. And I still spend
many of my days in a room, physically isolated. My mind, however, is
linked with a worldwide collection of like-minded (and not so like-minded)
souls: My virtual community.
<P>
    Virtual communities emerged from a surprising intersection of
humanity and technology. When the ubiquity of the world
telecommunications network is combined with the information-structuring
and storing capabilities of computers, a new communication medium
becomes possible. As we've learned from the history of the telephone,
radio, television, people can adopt new communication media and redesign
their way of life with surprising rapidity. Computers, modems, and
communication networks furnish the technological infrastructure of
computer-mediated communication (CMC); cyberspace is the conceptual
space where words and human relationships, data and wealth and power are
manifested by people using CMC technology; virtual communities are
cultural aggregations that emerge when enough people bump into each
<A NAME="IDX534"></A>
other often enough in cyberspace.
<P>
    A virtual community as they exist today is a group of people who may 
or may not meet one another face to face, and who exchange words and 
ideas through the mediation of computer bulletin boards and networks. In 
cyberspace, we chat and argue, engage in intellectual intercourse, 
perform acts of commerce, exchange knowledge, share emotional support, 
make plans, brainstorm, gossip, feud, fall in love, find friends and 
lose them, play games and metagames, flirt, create a little high art and 
a lot of idle talk. We do everything people do when people get together, 
but we do it with words on computer screens, leaving our bodies behind. 
Millions of us have already built communities where our identities 
commingle and interact electronically, independent of local time or 
location. The way a few of us live now might be the way a larger 
population will live, decades hence. 
<P>
    The pioneers are still out there exploring the frontier, the borders 
of the domain have yet to be determined, or even the shape of it, or the 
best way to find one's way in it. But people are using the technology of 
computer-mediated communications CMC technology to do things with each 
other that weren't possible before. Human behavior in cyberspace, as we 
can observe it and participate in it today, is going to be a crucially 
important factor. The ways in which people use CMC always will be rooted 
in human needs, not hardware or software. 
<P>
    If the use of virtual communities turns out to answer a deep and 
compelling need in people, and not just snag onto a human foible like 
pinball or pac-man, today's small online enclaves may grow into much 
larger networks over the next twenty years. The potential for social 
change is a side-effect of the trajectory of telecommunications and 
computer industries, as it can be forecast for the next ten years. This 
odd social revolution -- communities of people who may never or rarely 
meet face to face -- might piggyback on the technologies that the 
biggest telecommunication companies already are planning to install over 
the next ten years. 
<P>
    It is possible that the hardware and software of a new global 
telecommunications infrastructure, orders of magnitude more powerful 
than today's state of the art, now moving from the laboratories to the 
market, will expand the reach of this spaceless place throughout the 
1990s to a much wider population than today's hackers, technologists, 
scholars, students, and enthusiasts. The age of the online pioneers will 
end soon, and the cyberspace settlers will come en-masse. Telecommuters 
who might have thought they were just working from home and avoiding one 
day of gridlock on the freeway will find themselves drawn into a whole 
new society. Students and scientists are already there, artists have 
made significant inroads, librarians and educators have their own 
pioneers as well, and political activists of all stripes have just begun 
to discover the power of plugging a computer into a telephone. When 
today's millions become tens and hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, 
what kind of place, and what kind of model for human behavior will they 
find? 
<P>
    Today's bedroom electronic bulletin boards, regional computer 
conferencing systems, global computer networks offer clues to what might 
happen when more powerful enabling technology comes along. The hardware 
for amplifying the computing and communication capacity of every home on 
the world-grid is in the pipeline, although the ultimate applications 
are not yet clear. We'll be able to transfer the Library of Congress 
from any point on the globe to any another point in seconds, upload and 
download full-motion digital video at will. But is that really what 
people are likely to do with all that bandwidth and computing power? 
Some of the answers have to come from the behavioral rather than the 
technological part of the system. How will people actually use the 
desktop supercomputers and multimedia telephones that the engineers tell 
us we'll have in the near future. 
<P>
    One possibility is that people are going to do what people always do 
with a new communication technology: use it in ways never intended or 
foreseen by its inventors, to turn old social codes inside out and make 
new kinds of communities possible. CMC will change us, and change our 
culture, the way telephones and televisions and cheap video cameras 
changed us -- by altering the way we perceive and communicate. Virtual 
communities transformed my life profoundly, years ago, and continue to 
do so.

<H2><A NAME="SEC259" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC259">A Cybernaut's Eye View</A></H2>
<P>
    The most important clues to the shape of the future at this point 
might not be found in looking more closely at the properties of silicon, 
but in paying attention to the ways people need to, fail to, and try to 
communicate with one another. Right now, some people are convinced that 
spending hours a day in front of a screen, typing on a keyboard, 
fulfills in some way our need for a community of peers. Whether we have 
discovered something wonderful or stumbled into something insidiously 
unwonderful, or both, the fact that people want to use CMC to meet other 
people and experiment with identity are valuable signposts to possible 
futures. Human behavior in cyberspace, as we can observe it today on the 
nets and in the BBSs, gives rise to important questions about the 
effects of communication technology on human values. What kinds of 
humans are we becoming in an increasingly computer-mediated world, and 
do we have any control over that transformation? How have our 
definitions of "human" and "community" been under pressure to change to 
fit the specifications of a technology-guided civilization? 
<P>
    Fortunately, questions about the nature of virtual communities are 
not purely theoretical, for there is a readily accessible example of the 
phenomenon at hand to study. Millions of people now inhabit the social 
spaces that have grown up on the world's computer networks, and this 
previously invisible global subculture has been growing at a monstrous 
rate recently (e.g., the Internet growing by 25% per month). 
<P>
    I've lived here myself for seven years; the WELL and the net have 
been a regular part of my routine, like gardening on Sunday, for one 
sixth of my life thus far. My wife and daughter long ago grew accustomed 
to the fact that I sit in front of my computer early in the morning and 
late at night, chuckling and cursing, sometimes crying, about something 
I am reading on the computer screen. The questions I raise here are not 
those of a scientist, or of a polemicist who has found an answer to 
something, but as a user -- a nearly obsessive user -- of CMC and a deep 
mucker-about in virtual communities. What kind of people are my friends 
and I becoming? What does that portend for others? 
<P>
    If CMC has a potential, it is in the way people in so many parts of 
the net fiercely defend the use of the term "community" to describe the 
relationships we have built online. But fierceness of belief is not 
sufficient evidence that the belief is sound. Is the aura of community 
an illusion? The question has not been answered, and is worth asking. 
I've seen people hurt by interactions in virtual communities. Is 
telecommunication culture capable of becoming something more than what 
Scott Peck calls a "pseudo-community," where people lack the genuine 
personal commitments to one another that form the bedrock of genuine 
community? Or is our notion of "genuine" changing in an age where more 
people every day live their lives in increasingly artificial 
environments? New technologies tend to change old ways of doing things. 
Is the human need for community going to be the next technology 
commodity? 
<P>
    I can attest that I and thousands of other cybernauts know that what 
we are looking for, and finding in some surprising ways, is not just 
information, but instant access to ongoing relationships with a large 
number of other people. Individuals find friends and groups find shared 
identities online, through the aggregated networks of relationships and 
commitments that make any community possible. But are relationships and 
commitments as we know them even possible in a place where identities 
are fluid? The physical world, known variously as "IRL" ("In Real 
Life"), or "offline," is a place where the identity and position of the 
people you communicate with are well known, fixed, and highly visual. In 
cyberspace, everybody is in the dark. We can only exchange words with 
each other -- no glances or shrugs or ironic smiles. Even the nuances of 
voice and intonation are stripped away. On top of the technology-imposed 
constraints, we who populate cyberspace deliberately experiment with 
fracturing traditional notions of identity by living as multiple 
simultaneous personae in different virtual neighborhoods. 
<P>
    We reduce and encode our identities as words on a screen, decode and 
unpack the identities of others. The way we use these words, the stories 
(true and false) we tell about ourselves (or about the identity we want 
people to believe us to be) is what determines our identities in 
cyberspace. The aggregation of personae, interacting with each other, 
determines the nature of the collective culture. Our personae, 
constructed from our stories of who we are, use the overt topics of 
discussion in a BBS or network for a more fundamental purpose, as means 
of interacting with each other. And all this takes place on both public 
and private levels, in many-to-many open discussions and one-to-one 
private electronic mail, front stage role-playing and backstage 
behavior. 
<P>
    When I'm online, I cruise through my conferences, reading and 
replying in topics that I've been following, starting my own topics when 
the inspiration or need strikes me. Every few minutes, I get a notice on 
my screen that I have incoming mail. I might decide to wait to read the 
mail until I'm finished doing something else, or drop from the 
conference into the mailer, to see who it is from. At the same time that 
I am participating in open discussion in conferences and private 
discourse in electronic mail, people I know well use "sends" -- a means 
of sending one or two quick sentences to my screen without the 
intervention of an electronic mail message. This can be irritating 
before you get used to it, since you are either reading or writing 
something else when it happens, but eventually it becomes a kind of 
rhythm: different degrees of thoughtfulness and formality happen 
simultaneously, along with the simultaneous multiple personae. Then 
there are public and private conferences that have partially overlapping 
memberships. CMC offers tools for facilitating all the various ways 
people have discovered to divide and communicate, group and subgroup and 
regroup, include and exclude, select and elect. 
<P>
    When a group of people remain in communication with one another for 
extended periods of time, the question of whether it is a community 
arises. Virtual communities might be real communities, they might be 
pseudocommunities, or they might be something entirely new in the realm 
of social contracts, but I believe they are in part a response to the 
hunger for community that has followed the disintegration of traditional 
communities around the world. 
<P>
    Social norms and shared mental models have not emerged yet, so 
everyone's sense of what kind of place cyberspace is can vary widely, 
which makes it hard to tell whether the person you are communicating 
with shares the same model of the system within which you are 
communicating. Indeed, the online acronym YMMV ("Your Mileage May Vary") 
has become shorthand for this kind of indeterminacy of shared context. 
For example, I know people who use vicious online verbal combat as a way 
of blowing off steam from the pressures of their real life -- "sport 
hassling" -- and others who use it voyeuristically, as a text-based form 
of real-life soap-opera. To some people, it's a game. And I know people 
who feel as passionately committed to our virtual community and the 
people in it (or at least some of the people in it) as our nation, 
occupation, or neighborhood. Whether we like it or not, the 
communitarians and the venters, the builders and the vandals, the 
egalitarians and the passive-aggressives, are all in this place 
together. The diversity of the communicating population is one of the 
defining characteristics of the new medium, one of its chief 
attractions, the source of many of its most vexing problems. 
<P>
    Is the prospect of moving en-masse into cyberspace in the near 
future, when the world's communication network undergoes explosive 
expansion of bandwidth, a beneficial thing for entire populations to do? 
In which ways might the growth of virtual communities promote 
alienation? How might virtual communities facilitate conviviality? Which 
social structures will dissolve, which political forces will arise, and 
which will lose power? These are questions worth asking now, while there 
is still time to shape the future of the medium. In the sense that we 
are traveling blind into a technology-shaped future that might be very 
different from today's culture, direct reports from life in different 
corners of the world's online cultures today might furnish valuable 
signposts to the territory ahead. 
<P>
    Since the summer of 1985, I've spent an average of two hours a day, 
seven days a week, often when I travel, plugged into the WELL (Whole 
Earth 'Lectronic Link) via a computer and a telephone line, exchanging 
information and playing with attention, becoming entangled In Real Life, 
with a growing network of similarly wired-in strangers I met in 
cyberspace. I remember the first time I walked into a room full of 
people (IRL) whose faces were completely unknown to me, but who knew 
many intimate details of my history, and whose own stories I knew very 
well. I had contended with these people, shot the breeze around the 
electronic water cooler, shared alliances and formed bonds, fallen off 
my chair laughing with them, become livid with anger at these people, 
but I had not before seen their faces. 
<P>
    I found this digital watering hole for information-age hunters and 
gatherers the same way most people find such places -- I was lonely, 
hungry for intellectual and emotional companionship, although I didn't 
know it. While many commuters dream of working at home, telecommuting, I 
happen to know what it's like to work that way. I never could stand to 
commute or even get out of my pajamas if I didn't want to, so I've 
always worked at home. It has its advantages and its disadvantages. 
Others like myself also have been drawn into the online world because 
they shared with me the occupational hazard of the self-employed,
home-based symbolic analyst of the 1990s -- isolation. The kind of people 
that Robert Reich calls "symbolic analysts" are natural matches for 
online communities: programmers, writers, freelance artists and 
designers, independent radio and television producers, editors, 
researchers, librarians. People who know what to do with symbols, 
abstractions, and representations, but who sometimes find themselves 
spending more time with keyboards and screens than human companions. 
<P>
    I've learned that virtual communities are very much like other 
communities in some ways, deceptively so to those who assume that people 
who communicate via words on a screen are in some way aberrant in their 
communication skills and human needs. And I've learned that virtual 
communities are very much not like communities in some other ways, 
deceptively so to those who assume that people who communicate via words 
on a screen necessarily share the same level of commitment to each other 
in real life as more traditional communities. Communities can emerge 
from and exist within computer-linked groups, but that technical linkage 
of electronic personae is not sufficient to create a community.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Social Contracts</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_256.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_258.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC260" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC260">Social Contracts, Reciprocity, and Gift Economies in Cyberspace</A></H2>
<P>
    The network of communications that constitutes a virtual community 
can include the exchange of information as a kind of commodity, and the 
economic implications of this phenomenon are significant; the ultimate 
social potential of the network, however, lies not solely in its utility 
as an information market, but in the individual and group relationships 
that can happen over time. When such a group accumulates a sufficient 
number of friendships and rivalries, and witnesses the births, 
marriages, and deaths that bond any other kind of community, it takes on 
a definite and profound sense of place in people's minds. Virtual 
communities usually have a geographically local focus, and often have a 
connection to a much wider domain. The local focus of my virtual 
community, the WELL, is the San Francisco Bay Area; the wider locus 
consists of hundreds of thousands of other sites around the world, and 
millions of other communitarians, linked via exchanges of messages into 
a meta-community known as "the net." 
<P>
    The existence of computer-linked communities was predicted twenty 
years ago by <VAR>J.C.R. Licklider</VAR> and <VAR>Robert Taylor</VAR>, who as research 
directors for the Department of Defense, set in motion the research that 
resulted in the creation of the first such community, the ARPAnet: "What 
will on-line interactive communities be like?" Licklider and Taylor 
wrote, in 1968: "In most fields they will consist of geographically 
separated members, sometimes grouped in small clusters and sometimes 
working individually. They will be communities not of common location, 
but of common interest..." 
<P>
    My friends and I sometimes believe we are part of the future that 
Licklider dreamed about, and we often can attest to the truth of his 
prediction that "life will be happier for the on-line individual because 
the people with whom one interacts most strongly will be selected more 
by commonality of interests and goals than by accidents of proximity." I 
still believe that, but I also know that life also has turned out to be 
unhappy at times, intensely so in some circumstances, because of words 
on a screen. Events in cyberspace can have concrete effects in real 
life, of both the pleasant and less pleasant varieties. Participating in 
a virtual community has not solved all of life's problems for me, but it 
has served as an aid, a comfort and an inspiration at times; at other 
times, it has been like an endless, ugly, long-simmering family brawl. 
<P>
    I've changed my mind about a lot of aspects of the WELL over the 
years, but the "sense of place" is still as strong as ever. As Ray 
Oldenburg revealed in "The Great Good Place," there are three essential 
places in every person's life: the place they live, the place they work, 
and the place they gather for conviviality. Although the casual 
conversation that takes place in cafes, beauty shops, pubs, town squares 
is universally considered to be trivial, "idle talk," Oldenburg makes 
the case that such places are where communities can arise and hold 
together. When the automobile-centric, suburban, high-rise, fast food, 
shopping mall way of life eliminated many of these "third places," the 
social fabric of existing communities shredded. It might not be the same 
kind of place that Oldenburg had in mind, but so many of his 
descriptions of "third places" could also describe the WELL. 
<P>
    The feeling of logging into the WELL for just a minute or two, 
dozens of times a day is very similar to the feeling of peeking into the 
cafe, the pub, the common room, to see who's there, and whether you want 
to stay around for a chat. Indeed, in all the hundreds of thousands of 
computer systems around the world that use the UNIX operating system, as 
does the WELL, the most widely used command is the one that shows you 
who is online. Another widely used command is the one that shows you a 
particular user's biography. 
<P>
    I visit the WELL both for the sheer pleasure of communicating with 
my newfound friends, and for its value as a practical instrument 
for gathering information on subjects that are of momentary or enduring 
importance, from child care to neuroscience, technical questions on 
telecommunications to arguments on philosophical, political, or 
spiritual subjects. It's a bit like a neighborhood pub or coffee shop. 
It's a little like a salon, where I can participate in a hundred ongoing 
conversations with people who don't care what I look like or sound like, 
but who do care how I think and communicate. There are seminars and word 
fights in different corners. And it's all a little like a groupmind, 
where questions are answered, support is given, inspiration is provided, 
by people I may have never heard from before, and whom I may never meet 
face to face.  
<P>
    Because we cannot see one another, we are unable to form prejudices 
about others before we read what they have to say: Race, gender, age, 
national origin and physical appearance are not apparent unless a person 
wants to make such characteristics public. People who are thoughtful but 
who are not quick to formulate a reply often do better in CMC than face 
to face or over the telephone. People whose physical handicaps make it 
difficult to form new friendships find that virtual communities treat 
them as they always wanted to be treated -- as thinkers and transmitters 
of ideas and feeling beings, not carnal vessels with a certain 
appearance and way of walking and talking (or not walking and not 
talking). Don't mistake this filtration of appearances for 
dehumanization: Words on a screen are quite capable of moving one to 
laughter or tears, of evoking anger or compassion, of creating a 
community from a collection of strangers. 
<P>
    From my informal research into virtual communities around the world, 
I have found that enthusiastic members of virtual communities in Japan, 
England, and the US agree that "increasing the diversity of their circle 
of friends" was one of the most important advantages of computer 
conferencing. CMC is a way to meet people, whether or not you feel the 
need to affiliate with them on a community level, but the way you meet 
them has an interesting twist: In traditional kinds of communities, we 
are accustomed to meeting people, then getting to know them; in virtual 
communities, you can get to know people and then choose to meet them. In 
some cases, you can get to know people who you might never meet on the 
physical plane. 
<P>
    How does anybody find friends? In the traditional community, we 
search through our pool of neighbors and professional colleagues, of 
acquaintances and acquaintances of acquaintances, in order to find 
people who share our values and interests. We then exchange information 
about one another, disclose and discuss our mutual interests, and 
sometimes we become friends. In a virtual community we can go directly 
to the place where our favorite subjects are being discussed, then get 
acquainted with those who share our passions, or who use words in a way 
we find attractive. In this sense, the topic is the address: You can't 
simply pick up a phone and ask to be connected with someone who wants to 
talk about Islamic art or California wine, or someone with a three year 
old daughter or a 30 year old Hudson; you can, however, join a computer 
conference on any of those topics, then open a public or private 
correspondence with the previously-unknown people you find in that 
conference. You will find that your chances of making friends are 
magnified by orders of magnitude over the old methods of finding a peer 
group. 
<P>
    You can be fooled about people in cyberspace, behind the cloak of 
words. But that can be said about telephones or face to face 
communications, as well; computer-mediated communications provide new 
ways to fool people, and the most obvious identity-swindles will die out 
only when enough people learn to use the medium critically. Sara Kiesler 
noted that the word "phony" is an artifact of the early years of the 
telephone, when media-naive people were conned by slick talkers in ways 
that wouldn't deceive an eight-year old with a cellular phone today. 
<P>
    There is both an intellectual and an emotional component to CMC. 
Since so many members of virtual communities are the kind of
knowledge-based professionals whose professional standing can be enhanced
by what they know, virtual communities can be practical, cold-blooded 
instruments. Virtual communities can help their members cope with 
information overload. The problem with the information age, especially 
for students and knowledge workers who spend their time immersed in the 
info-flow, is that there is too much information available and no 
effective filters for sifting the key data that are useful and 
interesting to us as individuals. Programmers are trying to design 
better and better "software agents" that can seek and sift, filter and 
find, and save us from the awful feeling one gets when it turns out that 
the specific knowledge one needs is buried in 15,000 pages of related 
information. 
<P>
    The first software agents are now becoming available (e.g., WAIS, 
Rosebud), but we already have far more sophisticated, if informal, 
social contracts among groups of people that allow us to act as software 
agents for one another. If, in my wanderings through information space, 
I come across items that don't interest me but which I know one of my 
worldwide loose-knit affinity group of online friends would appreciate, 
I send the appropriate friend a pointer, or simply forward the entire 
text (one of the new powers of CMC is the ability to publish and 
converse with the same medium). In some cases, I can put the information 
in exactly the right place for 10,000 people I don't know, but who are 
intensely interested in that specific topic, to find it when they need 
it. And sometimes, 10,000 people I don't know do the same thing for me. 
<P>
    This unwritten, unspoken social contract, a blend of strong-tie and 
weak-tie relationships among people who have a mixture of motives, 
requires one to give something, and enables one to receive something. I 
have to keep my friends in mind and send them pointers instead of 
throwing my informational discards into the virtual scrap-heap. It 
doesn't take a great deal of energy to do that, since I have to sift 
that information anyway in order to find the knowledge I seek for my own 
purposes; it takes two keystrokes to delete the information, three 
keystrokes to forward it to someone else. And with scores of other 
people who have an eye out for my interests while they explore sectors 
of the information space that I normally wouldn't frequent, I find that 
the help I receive far outweighs the energy I expend helping others: A 
marriage of altruism and self-interest. 
<P>
    The first time I learned about that particular cyberspace power was 
early in the history of the WELL, when I was invited to join a panel of 
experts who advise the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment 
(OTA). The subject of the assessment was "Communication Systems for an 
Information Age." I'm not an expert in telecommunication technology or 
policy, but I do know where to find a group of such experts, and how to 
get them to tell me what they know. Before I went to Washington for my 
first panel meeting, I opened a conference in the WELL and invited 
assorted information-freaks, technophiles, and communication experts to 
help me come up with something to say. An amazing collection of minds 
flocked to that topic, and some of them created whole new communities 
when they collided. 
<P>
    By the time I sat down with the captains of industry, government 
advisers, and academic experts at the panel table, I had over 200 pages 
of expert advice from my own panel. I wouldn't have been able to 
integrate that much knowledge of my subject in an entire academic or 
industrial career, and it only took me (and my virtual community) a few 
minutes a day for six weeks. I have found the WELL to be an outright 
magical resource, professionally. An editor or producer or client can 
call and ask me if I know much about the Constitution, or fiber optics, 
or intellectual property. "Let me get back to you in twenty minutes," I 
say, reaching for the modem. In terms of the way I learned to use the 
WELL to get the right piece of information at the right time, I'd say 
that the hours I've spent putting information into the WELL turned out 
to be the most lucrative professional investments I've ever made. 
<P>
    The same strategy of nurturing and making use of loose
information-sharing affiliations across the net can be applied to an infinite
domain 
of problem areas, from literary criticism to software evaluation. It's a 
neat way for a sufficiently large, sufficiently diverse group of people 
to multiply their individual degree of expertise, and I think it could 
be done even if the people aren't involved in a community other than 
their company or their research specialty. I think it works better when 
the community's conceptual model of itself is more like barn-raising 
than horse-trading, though. Reciprocity is a key element of any
market-based culture, but the arrangement I'm describing feels to me more like 
a kind of gift economy where people do things for one another out of a 
spirit of building something between them, rather than a
spreadsheet-calculated quid pro quo. When that spirit exists, everybody gets a 
little extra something, a little sparkle, from their more practical 
transactions; different kinds of things become possible when this 
mindset pervades. Conversely, people who have valuable things to add to 
the mix tend to keep their heads down and their ideas to themselves when 
a mercenary or hostile zeitgeist dominates an online community. 
<P>
    I think one key difference between straightforward workaday 
reciprocity is that in the virtual community I know best, one valuable 
currency is knowledge, elegantly presented. Wit and use of language are 
rewarded in this medium, which is biased toward those who learn how to 
manipulate attention and emotion with the written word. Sometimes, you 
give one person more information than you would give another person in 
response to the same query, simply because you recognize one of them to 
be more generous or funny or to-the-point or agreeable to your political 
convictions than the other one. 
<P>
    If you give useful information freely, without demanding
tightly-coupled reciprocity, your requests for information are met more swiftly, 
in greater detail, than they would have been otherwise. The person  you 
help might never be in a position to help you, but someone else might 
be. That's why it is hard to distinguish idle talk from serious
context-setting. In a virtual community, idle talk is context-setting. Idle talk 
is where people learn what kind of person you are, why you should be 
trusted or mistrusted, what interests you. An agora is more than the 
site of transactions; it is also a place where people meet and size up 
one another. 
<P>
    A market depends on the quality of knowledge held by the 
participants, the buyers and sellers, about price and availability and a 
thousand other things that influence business; a market that has a forum 
for informal and back-channel communications is a better-informed 
market. The London Stock Exchange grew out of the informal transactions 
in a coffee-house; when it became the London International Stock 
Exchange a few years ago, and abolished the trading-room floor, the 
enterprise lost something vital in the transition from an old room where 
all the old boys met and cut their deals to the screens of thousands of 
workstations scattered around the world. 
<P>
    The context of the informal community of knowledge sharers grew to 
include years of both professional and personal relationships. It is not 
news that the right network of people can serve as an inquiry research 
system: You throw out the question, and somebody on the net knows the 
answer. You can make a game out of it, where you gain symbolic prestige 
among your virtual peers by knowing the answer. And you can make a game 
out of it among a group of people who have dropped out of their orthodox 
professional lives, where some of them sell these information services 
for exorbitant rates, in order to participate voluntarily in the virtual 
community game. 
<P>
    When the WELL was young and growing more slowly than it is now, such 
knowledge-potlatching had a kind of naively enthusiastic energy. When 
you extend the conversation -- several dozen different characters,
well-known to one another from four or five years of virtual hanging-out, 
several hours a day -- it gets richer, but not necessarily "happier." 
<P>
    Virtual communities have several drawbacks in comparison to
face-to-face communication, disadvantages that must be kept in mind if you are 
to make use of the power of these computer-mediated discussion groups. 
The filtration factor that prevents one from knowing the race or age of 
another participant also prevents people from communicating the facial 
expressions, body language, and tone of voice that constitute the 
inaudible but vital component of most face to face communications. 
Irony, sarcasm, compassion, and other subtle but all-important nuances 
that aren't conveyed in words alone are lost when all you can see of a 
person are words on a screen. 
<P>
    It's amazing how the ambiguity of words in the absence of body 
language inevitably leads to online misunderstandings. And since the 
physical absence of other people also seems to loosen some of the social 
bonds that prevent people from insulting one another in person, 
misunderstandings can grow into truly nasty stuff before anybody has a 
chance to untangle the original miscommunication. Heated diatribes and 
interpersonal incivility that wouldn't crop up often in face to face or 
even telephone discourse seem to appear with relative frequency in 
computer conferences. The only presently available antidote to this flaw 
of CMC as a human communication medium is widespread knowledge of this 
flaw -- aka "netiquette." 
<P>
    Online civility and how to deal with breaches of it is a topic unto 
itself, and has been much-argued on the WELL. Degrees of outright 
incivility constitute entire universes such as alt.flame, the Usenet 
newsgroup where people go specifically to spend their days hurling vile 
imprecations at one another. I am beginning to suspect that the most 
powerful and effective defense an online community has in the face of 
those who are bent on disruption might be norms and agreements about 
withdrawing attention from those who can't abide by even loose rules of 
verbal behavior. "If you continue doing that," I remember someone saying 
to a particularly persistent would-be disrupter, "we will stop paying 
attention to you." This is technically easy to do on Usenet, where 
putting the name of a person or topic header in a "kill file" (aka "bozo 
filter") means you will never see future contributions from that person 
or about that topic. You can simply choose to not see any postings from 
Rich Rosen, or that feature the word "abortion" in the title. A society 
in which people can remove one another, or even entire topics of 
discussion, from visibility. The WELL does not have a bozo filter, 
although the need for one is a topic of frequent discussion.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Who Is The WELL?</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_257.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_259.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC261" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC261">Who Is The WELL?</A></H2>
<P>
    One way to know what the WELL is like is to know something about the 
kind of people who use it. It has roots in the San Francisco Bay Area, 
and in two separate cultural revolutions that took place there in past 
<A NAME="IDX535"></A>
decades. The Whole Earth Catalog originally emerged from the 
counterculture as Stewart Brand's way of providing access to tools and 
ideas to all the communes who were exploring alternate ways of life in 
the forests of Mendocino or the high deserts outside Santa Fe. The Whole 
Earth Catalogs and the magazines they spawned, Co-Evolution Quarterly 
and Whole Earth Review, have outlived the counterculture itself, since 
they are still alive and raising hell after nearly 25 years. For many 
years, the people who have been exploring alternatives and are open to 
ideas that you don't find in the mass media have found themselves in 
cities instead of rural communes, where their need for new tools and 
ideas didn't go away. 
<P>
    The Whole Earth Catalog crew received a large advance in the
mid-1980s to produce an updated version, a project involving many 
geographically-separated authors and editors, many of whom were using 
computers. They bought a minicomputer and the license to Picospan, a 
computer conferencing program, leased an office next to the magazine's 
office, leased incoming telephone lines, set up modems, and the WELL was 
born in 1985. The idea from the beginning was that the founders weren't 
sure what the WELL would become, but they would provide tools for people 
to build it into something useful. It was consciously a cultural 
experiment, and the business was designed to succeed or fail on the 
basis of the results of the experiment. The person Stewart Brand chose 
to be the WELL's first director -- technician, manager, innkeeper, and 
bouncer -- was Matthew McClure, not-coincidentally a computer-savvy 
veteran of The Farm, one of the most successful of the communes that 
started in the sixties. Brand and McClure started a low-rules, high-tone 
discussion, where savvy networkers, futurists, misfits who had learned 
how to make our outsiderness work for us, could take the technology of 
CMC to its cultural limits. 
<P>
<A NAME="IDX536"></A>
    The Whole Earth network -- the granola-eating utopians, the solar-power
enthusiasts, serious ecologists and the space-station crowd, 
immortalists, Biospherians, environmentalists, social activists -- was 
part of the core population from the beginning. But there were a couple 
of other key elements. One was the subculture that happened ten years 
after the counterculture era -- the personal computer revolution. 
Personal computers and the PC industry were created by young iconoclasts 
who wanted to have whizzy tools and change the world. Whole Earth had 
honored them, including the outlaws among them, with the early Hacker's 
Conferences. The young computer wizards, and the grizzled old hands who 
were still messing with mainframes, showed up early at the WELL because 
the guts of the system itself -- the UNIX operating system and "C" 
language programming code -- were available for tinkering by responsible 
craftsmen. 
<P>
    A third cultural element that made up the initial mix of the WELL, 
which has drifted from its counterculture origins in many ways, were the 
deadheads. Books and theses have been written about the subculture that 
have grown up around the band, the Grateful Dead. The deadheads have a 
strong feeling of community, but they can only manifest it en masse when 
the band has concerts. They were a community looking for a place to 
happen when several technology-savvy deadheads started a "Grateful Dead 
Conference" on the WELL. GD was so phenomenally successful that for the 
first several years, deadheads were by far the single largest source of 
income for the enterprise. 
<P>
    Along with the other elements came the first marathon swimmers in 
the new currents of the information streams, the futurists and writers 
and journalists. The New York Times, Business Week, the San Francisco 
Chronicle, Time, Rolling Stone, Byte, the Wall Street Journal all have 
journalists that I know personally who drop into the WELL as a listening 
post. People in Silicon Valley lurk to hear loose talk among the pros. 
Journalists tend to attract other journalists, and the purpose of 
journalists is to attract everybody else: most people have to use an old 
medium to hear news about the arrival of a new medium. 
<P>
    Things changed, both rapidly and slowly, in the WELL. There were 
about 600 members of the WELL when I joined, in the summer of 1985. It 
seemed that then, as now, the usual ten percent of the members did 80% 
of the talking. Now there are about 6000 people, with a net gain of 
about a hundred a month. There do seem to be more women than other parts 
of cyberspace. Most of the people I meet seem to be white or Asian; 
African-Americans aren't missing, but they aren't conspicuous or even 
visible. If you can fake it, gender and age are invisible, too. I'd 
guess the WELL consists of about 80% men, 20% women. I don't know 
whether formal demographics would be the kind of thing that most WELL 
users would want to contribute to. It's certainly something we'd 
discuss, argue, debate, joke about. 
<P>
    One important social rule was built into Picospan, the software that 
the WELL lives inside: Nobody is anonymous. Everybody is required to 
attach their real "userid" to their postings. It is possible to use 
pseudonyms to create alternate identities, or to carry metamessages, but 
the pseudonyms are always linked in every posting to the real userid. So 
individual personae -- whether or not they correspond closely to the 
real person who owns the account -- are responsible for the words they 
post. In fact, the first several years, the screen that you saw when you 
reached the WELL said "You own your own words." Stewart Brand, the 
WELL's co-founder likes epigrams: "Whole Earth," "Information wants to 
be free." "You own your own words." Like the best epigrams, "You own 
your own words" is open to multiple interpretations. The matter of 
responsibility and ownership of words is one of the topics WELLbeings 
argue about endlessly, so much that the phrase has been abbreviated to 
"YOYOW," As in, "Oh no, another YOYOW debate." 
<P>
    Who are the WELL members, and what do they talk about? I can tell 
you about the individuals I have come to know over six years, but the 
WELL has long since been something larger than the sum of everybody's 
friends. The characteristics of the pool of people who tune into this 
electronic listening post, whether or not they every post a word in 
public, is a strong determinant of the flavor of the "place." There's a 
cross-sectional feeling of "who are we?" that transcends the 
intersecting and non-intersecting rings of friends and acquaintances 
each individual develops.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - My Neighborhood On The WELL</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_258.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_260.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC262" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC262">My Neighborhood On The WELL</A></H2>
<P>
    Every CMC system gives users tools for creating their own sense of 
place, by customizing the way they navigate through the database of 
conferences, topics, and responses. A conference or newsgroup is like a 
place you go. If you go to several different places in a fixed order, it 
seems to reinforce the feeling of place by creating a customized 
neighborhood that is also shared by others. You see some of the same 
users in different parts of the same neighborhood. Some faces, you see 
only in one context -- the parents conference, the Grateful Dead tours 
conference, the politics or sex conference. 
<P>
    My home neighborhood on the WELL is reflected in my ".cflist," the 
file that records my preferences about the order of conferences I visit. 
It is always possible to go to any conference with a command, but with a 
<TT>`.cflist'</TT> you structure your online time by going from conference to 
specified conference at regular intervals, reading and perhaps 
responding in several ongoing threads in several different places. 
That's the part of the art of discourse where I have found that the 
computer adds value to the intellectual activity of discussing formally 
distinct subjects asynchronously, from different parts of the world, 
over extending periods, by enabling groups to structure conversations by 
topic, over time. 
<P>
    My <TT>`.cflist'</TT> starts, for sentimental reasons, with the Mind 
conference, the first one I hosted on the WELL, since 1985. I've changed 
my <TT>`.cflist'</TT> hundreds of times over the years, to add or delete 
conferences from my regular neighborhood, but I've always kept Mind in 
the lead. The entry banner screen for the Mind conference used to 
display to each user the exact phase of the moon in numbers and ASCII 
graphics every time they logged in to the conference. But the volunteer 
programmer who had created the "phoon" program had decided to withdraw 
it, years later, in a dispute with WELL management. There is often a 
technological fix to a social problem within this particular universe. 
Because the WELL seems to be an intersection of many different cultures, 
there have been many experiments with software tools to ameliorate 
problems that seemed to crop up between people, whether because of the 
nature of the medium or the nature of the people. A frighteningly 
expensive pool of talent was donated by volunteer programmers to create 
tools and even weapons for WELL users to deal with each other. People 
keep giving things to the WELL, and taking them away. Offline readers 
and online tools by volunteer programmers gave others increased power to 
<A NAME="IDX537"></A>
communicate. 
<P>
    The News conference is what's next. This is the commons, the place 
where the most people visit the most often, where the most outrageous 
off-topic proliferation is least pernicious, where the important 
announcements about the system or social events or major disputes or new 
conferences are announced. When an earthquake or fire happens, News is 
where you want to go. Immediately after the 1989 earthquake and during 
the Oakland fire of 1991, the WELL was a place to check the damage to 
the local geographic community, lend help to those who need it, and get 
first-hand reports. During Tienamen square, the Gulf War, the Soviet 
Coup, the WELL was a media-funnel, with snippets of email from Tel-Aviv 
and entire newsgroups fed by fax machines in China, erupting in News 
conference topics that grew into fast-moving conferences of their own. 
During any major crisis in the real world, the routine at our house is 
to turn on CNN and log into the WELL. 
<P>
    After News is Hosts, where the hottest stuff usually happens. The 
hosts community is a story in itself. The success of the WELL in its 
first five years, all would agree, rested heavily on the efforts of the 
conference hosts -- online characters who had created the character of 
the first neighborhoods and kept the juice flowing between one another 
all over the WELL, but most pointedly in the Hosts conference. Some 
spicy reading in the Archives conference originated from old hosts' 
disputes - and substantial arguments about the implications of CMC for 
civil rights, intellectual property, censorship, by a lot of people who 
know what they are talking about, mixed liberally with a lot of other 
people who don't know what they are talking about, but love to talk 
anyway, via keyboard and screen, for years on end. 
<P>
    In this virtual place, the pillars of the community and the worst 
offenders of public sensibilities are in the same group -- the hosts. At 
their best and their worst, this ten percent of the online population 
put out the words that the other ninety percent keep paying to read. 
Like good hosts at any social gathering, they make newcomers welcome, 
keep the conversation flowing, mediate disputes, clean up messes, and 
throw out miscreants, if need be. A WELL host is part salon keeper, part 
saloon keeper, part talk-show host, part publisher. The only power to 
censor or to ban a user is the hosts' power. Policy varies from host to 
host, and that's the only policy. The only justice for those who misuse 
that power is the forced participation in weeks of debilitating and 
vituperative post-mortem. 
<P>
    The hosts community is part long-running soap opera, part town 
meeting, bar-room brawl, anarchic debating society, creative groupmind, 
bloody arena, union hall, playpen, encounter group. The Hosts conference 
is extremely general, from technical questions to personal attacks. The 
Policy conference is supposed to be restricted to matters of what WELL 
policy is, or ought to be. The part-delusion, part-accurate perception 
that the hosts and other users have strong influence over WELL policy is 
part of what feeds debate here, and a strong element in the libertarian 
reputation of the stereotypical WELLite. After fighting my way through a 
day's or hour's worth of the Hot New Dispute in News, Hosts, and Policy, 
I check on the conferences I host -- Info, Virtual Communities, Virtual 
Reality. After that my <TT>`.cflist'</TT> directs me, at the press of the return 
key, to the first new topic or response in the Parenting, Writers', 
Grateful Dead tours, Telecommunication, Macintosh, Weird, Electronic 
Frontier Foundation, Whole Earth, Books, Media, Men on the WELL, 
Miscellaneous, and Unclear conferences. 
<P>
    The social dynamics of the WELL spawn new conferences in response to 
different kinds of pressures. Whenever a hot interpersonal or doctrinal 
issue breaks out, for example, people want to stage the brawl or make a 
dramatic farewell speech or shocking disclosure or serious accusation in 
the most heavily-visited area of the WELL, which is usually the place 
that others want to be a Commons -- a place where people from different 
sub-communities can come to find out what is going on around the WELL, 
outside the WELL, where they can pose questions to the committee of the 
whole. When too many discussions of what the WELL's official policy 
ought to be, about censorship or intellectual property or the way people 
treat each other, break out, they tended to clutter the place people 
went to get a quick sense of what is happening outside their 
neighborhoods. So the Policy conference was born. 
<P>
    But then the WELL grew larger and it wasn't just policy but 
governance and social issues like political correctness or the right of 
users to determine the social rules of the system. Several years and six 
thousand more users after the fission of the News and Policy 
conferences, another conference split off News -- "MetaWELL,"  a 
conference was created strictly to discussions about the WELL itself, its 
nature, its situation (often dire), its future. 
<P>
    Grabbing attention in the Commons is a powerful act. Some people 
seem drawn to performing there; others burst out there in acts of 
desperation, after one history of frustration or another. Dealing with 
people who are so consistently off-topic or apparently deeply grooved 
into incoherence, long-windedness, scatology, is one of the events that 
challenges a community to decide what its values really are, or ought to 
be. 
<P>
    Something is happening here. I'm not sure anybody understands it 
yet. I know that the WELL and the net is an important part of my life 
and I have to decide for myself whether this is a new way to make 
genuine commitments to other human beings, or a silicon-induced illusion 
of community. I urge others to help pursue that question in a variety of 
ways, while we have the time. The political dimensions of CMC might lead 
to situations that would pre-empt questions of other social effects; 
responses to the need for understanding the power-relationships inherent 
in CMC are well represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and 
others. We need to learn a lot more, very quickly, about what kind of 
place our minds are homesteading. 
<P>
    The future of virtual communities is connected to the future of 
everything else, starting with the most precious thing people have to 
gain or lose -- political freedom. The part played by communication 
technologies in the disintegration of communism, the way broadcast 
television pre-empted the American electoral process, the power of fax 
and CMC networks during times of political repression like Tienamen 
Square and the Soviet Coup attempt, the power of citizen electronic 
journalism, the power-maneuvering of law enforcement and intelligence 
agencies to restrict rights of citizen access and expression in 
cyberspace, all point to the future of CMC as a close correlate of 
future political scenarios. More important than civilizing cyberspace is 
ensuring its freedom as a citizen-to-citizen communication and 
publication medium; laws that infringe equity of access to and freedom 
of expression in cyberspace could transform today's populist empowerment 
into yet another instrument of manipulation. Will "electronic democracy" 
be an accurate description of political empowerment that grows out of 
the screen of a computer? Or will it become a brilliant piece of 
disinfotainment, another means of manipulating emotions and 
manufacturing public opinion in the service of power. 
<P>
    Who controls what kinds of information is communicated in the 
international networks where virtual communities live? Who censors, and 
what is censored? Who safeguards the privacy of individuals in the face 
of technologies that make it possible to amass and retrieve detailed 
personal information about every member of a large population? The 
answers to these political questions might make moot any more abstract 
questions about cultures in cyberspace. Democracy itself depends on the 
relatively free flow of communications. The following words by James 
Madison are carved in marble at the United States Library of Congress: 
"A popular government without popular information, or the means of 
acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or perhaps 
both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance, and a people who mean to 
be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which 
knowledge gives." It is time for people to arm themselves with power 
about the future of CMC technology. 
<P>
    Who controls the market for relationships? Will the world's 
increasingly interlinked, increasingly powerful, decreasingly costly 
communications infrastructure be controlled by a small number of very 
large companies? Will cyberspace be privatized and parceled out to those 
who can afford to buy into the auction? If political forces do not seize 
the high ground and end today's freewheeling exchange of ideas, it is 
still possible for a more benevolent form of economic control to stunt 
the evolution of virtual communities, if a small number of companies 
gain the power to put up toll-roads in the information networks, and 
smaller companies are not able to compete with them. 
<P>
    Or will there be an open market, in which newcomers like Apple or 
Microsoft can become industry leaders? The playing field in the global 
telecommunications industry will never be level, but the degree of 
individual freedom available through telecommunication technologies in 
the future may depend upon whether the market for goods and services in 
cyberspace remains open for new companies to create new uses for CMC. 
<P>
    I present these observations as a set of questions, not as answers. 
I believe that we need to try to understand the nature of CMC, 
cyberspace, and virtual communities in every important context -- 
politically, economically, socially, culturally, cognitively. Each 
different perspective reveals something that the other perspectives do 
not reveal. Each different discipline fails to see something that 
another discipline sees very well. We need to think as teams here, 
across boundaries of academic discipline, industrial affiliation, 
nation, to understand, and thus perhaps regain control of, the way human 
communities are being transformed by communication technologies. We 
can't do this solely as dispassionate observers, although there is 
certainly a huge need for the detached assessment of social science. But 
community is a matter of the heart and the gut as well as the head. Some 
of the most important learning will always have to be done by jumping 
into one corner or another of cyberspace, living there, and getting up 
to your elbows in the problems that virtual communities face.

<A NAME="IDX538"></A>
(Reprinted from SCIENCE FICTION EYE #10 with permission of the author.)
<P>
I just wrote my first nonfiction book. It's called THE HACKER CRACKDOWN:
LAW AND DISORDER ON THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER. Writing this book has
required me to spend much of the past year and a half in the company of
<A NAME="IDX539"></A>
<A NAME="IDX540"></A>
<A NAME="IDX541"></A>
hackers, cops, and civil libertarians.
<P>
I've spent much time listening to arguments over what's legal, what's
illegal, what's right and wrong, what's decent and what's despicable,
what's moral and immoral, in the world of computers and civil liberties.
My various informants were knowledgeable people who cared passionately
about these issues, and most of them seemed well-intentioned.
Considered as a whole, however, their opinions were a baffling mess of
contradictions.
<P>
When I started this project, my ignorance of the issues involved was
genuine and profound. I'd never knowingly met anyone from the computer
underground. I'd never logged-on to an underground bulletin-board or
read a semi-legal hacker magazine. Although I did care a great deal
about the issue of freedom of expression, I knew sadly little about the
history of civil rights in America or the legal doctrines that surround
freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of association. My
relations with the police were firmly based on the stratagem of avoiding
personal contact with police to the greatest extent possible.
<P>
I didn't go looking for this project. This project came looking for me.
I became inextricably involved when agents of the United States Secret
Service, acting under the guidance of federal attorneys from Chicago,
came to my home town of Austin on March 1, 1990, and confiscated the
computers of a local science fiction gaming publisher.  <VAR>Steve Jackson</VAR>
Games, Inc., of Austin, was about to publish a gaming-book called GURPS
<A NAME="IDX542"></A>
Cyberpunk.
<P>
When the federal law-enforcement agents discovered the electronic
manuscript of CYBERPUNK on the computers they had seized from Mr.
Jackson's offices, they expressed grave shock and alarm. They declared
that CYBERPUNK was "a manual for computer crime."
<P>
It's not my intention to reprise the story of the Jackson case in this
column. I've done that to the best of my ability in THE HACKER
CRACKDOWN; and in any case the ramifications of March 1 are far from
over. Mr. Jackson was never charged with any crime. His civil suit
against the raiders is still in federal court as I write this.
<P>
I don't want to repeat here what some cops believe, what some hackers
believe, or what some civil libertarians believe. Instead, I want to
discuss my own moral beliefs as a science fiction writer -- such as they
are. As an SF writer, I want to attempt a personal statement of
principle.
<P>
It has not escaped my attention that there are many people who believe
that anyone called a "cyberpunk" must be, almost by definition, entirely
devoid of principle. I offer as evidence an excerpt from <VAR>Buck
BloomBecker</VAR>'s 1990 book, SPECTACULAR COMPUTER CRIMES. On page 53, in a
chapter titled "Who Are The Computer Criminals?", Mr. BloomBecker
<A NAME="IDX543"></A>
introduces the formal classification of "cyberpunk" criminality.
<P>
"In the last few years, a new genre of science fiction has arisen under
the evocative name of 'cyberpunk.' Introduced in the work of <VAR>William
Gibson</VAR>, particularly in his prize-winning novel NEUROMANCER, cyberpunk
takes an apocalyptic view of the technological future. In NEUROMANCER,
the protagonist is a futuristic hacker who must use the most
sophisticated computer strategies to commit crimes for people who offer
him enough money to buy the biological creations he needs to survive.
His life is one of cynical despair, fueled by the desire to avoid death.
Though none of the virus cases actually seen so far have been so
devastating, this book certainly represents an attitude that should be
watched for when we find new cases of computer virus and try to
<A NAME="IDX544"></A>
understand the motivations behind them."
<P>
"The New York Times's <VAR>John Markoff</VAR>, one of the more perceptive and
accomplished writers in the field, has written that a number of computer
criminals demonstrate new levels of meanness. He characterizes them, as
<A NAME="IDX545"></A>
do I, as cyberpunks."
<P>
Those of us who have read Gibson's NEUROMANCER closely will be aware of
certain factual inaccuracies in Mr. BloomBecker's brief review.
NEUROMANCER is not "apocalyptic." The chief conspirator in NEUROMANCER
forces Case's loyalty, not by buying his services, but by planting
poison-sacs in his brain. Case is "fueled" not by his greed for money or
"biological creations," or even by the cynical "desire to avoid death,"
but rather by his burning desire to hack cyberspace. And so forth.
<P>
However, I don't think this misreading of NEUROMANCER is based on
carelessness or malice. The rest of Mr. BloomBecker's book generally is
informative, well-organized, and thoughtful. Instead, I feel that Mr.
BloomBecker manfully absorbed as much of NEUROMANCER as he could without
suffering a mental toxic reaction. This report of his is what he
actually <EM>saw</EM> when reading the novel.
<P>
NEUROMANCER has won quite a following in the world of computer crime
investigation. A prominent law enforcement official once told me that
police unfailingly conclude the worst when they find a teenager with a
computer and a copy of NEUROMANCER. When I declared that I too was a
"cyberpunk" writer, she asked me if I would print the recipe for a
pipe-bomb in my works. I was astonished by this question, which struck
me as bizarre rhetorical excess at the time. That was before I had
actually examined bulletin-boards in the computer underground, which I
found to be chock-a-block with recipes for pipe-bombs, and worse. (I
didn't have the heart to tell her that my friend and colleague <VAR>Walter
Jon Williams</VAR> had once written and published an SF story closely
<A NAME="IDX546"></A>
<A NAME="IDX547"></A>
<A NAME="IDX548"></A>
describing explosives derived from simple household chemicals.)
<P>
Cyberpunk SF (along with SF in general) has, in fact, permeated the
computer underground. I have met young underground hackers who use the
aliases "Neuromancer," "Wintermute" and "Count Zero." The Legion of
Doom, the absolute bete noire of computer law-enforcement, used to
congregate on a bulletin-board called "Black Ice."
<P>
In the past, I didn't know much about anyone in the underground, but
they certainly knew about me. Since that time, I've had people express
sincere admiration for my novels, and then, in almost the same breath,
brag to me about breaking into hospital computers to chortle over
confidential medical reports about herpes victims.
<P>
The single most stinging example of this syndrome is "<VAR>Pengo</VAR>," a member
of the German hacker-group that broke into Internet computers while in
the pay of the KGB. He told German police, and the judge at the trial of
his co-conspirators, that he was inspired by NEUROMANCER and <VAR>John
<A NAME="IDX549"></A>
<A NAME="IDX550"></A>
<A NAME="IDX551"></A>
<A NAME="IDX552"></A>
<A NAME="IDX553"></A>
Brunner</VAR>'s SHOCKWAVE RIDER.
<P>
I didn't write NEUROMANCER. I did, however, read it in manuscript and
offered many purportedly helpful comments. I praised the book publicly
and repeatedly and at length. I've done everything I can to get people
to read this book.
<P>
I don't recall cautioning Gibson that his novel might lead to anarchist
hackers selling their expertise to the ferocious and repulsive apparat
that gave the world the Lubyanka and the Gulag Archipelago. I don't
think I could have issued any such caution, even if I'd felt the danger
of such a possibility, which I didn't. I still don't know in what
fashion Gibson might have changed his book to avoid inciting evildoers,
while still retaining the integrity of his vision -- the very quality
about the book that makes it compelling and worthwhile.
<P>
<EM>This leads me to my first statements of moral principle.</EM>
<P>
As a "cyberpunk" SF writer, I am not responsible for every act committed
by a Bohemian with a computer. I don't own the word "cyberpunk" and
cannot help where it is bestowed, or who uses it, or to what ends.
<P>
As a science fiction writer, it is not my business to make people
behave. It is my business to make people imagine. I cannot control other
people's imaginations -- any more than I would allow them to control
mine.
<P>
I am, however, morally obliged to speak out when acts of evil are
committed that use my ideas or my rhetoric, however distantly, as a
justification.
<P>
Pengo and his friends committed a grave crime that was worthy of
condemnation and punishment. They were clever, but treacherously clever.
They were imaginative, but it was imagination in a bad cause.  They were
technically accomplished, but they abused their expertise for illicit
profit and to feed their egos. They may be "cyberpunks" -- according to
many, they may deserve that title far more than I do -- but they're no
friends of mine.
<P>
What is "crime"? What is a moral offense? What actions are evil and
dishonorable? I find these extraordinarily difficult questions. I have
no special status that should allow me to speak with authority on such
subjects. Quite the contrary. As a writer in a scorned popular
literature and a self-professed eccentric Bohemian, I have next to no
authority of any kind. I'm not a moralist, philosopher, or prophet.
I've always considered my "moral role," such as it is, to be that of a
court jester -- a person sometimes allowed to speak the unspeakable, to
explore ideas and issues in a format where they can be treated as games,
thought-experiments, or metaphors, not as prescriptions, laws, or
sermons.
<P>
I have no religion, no sacred scripture to guide my actions and provide
an infallible moral bedrock. I'm not seeking political responsibilities
or the power of public office. I habitually question any pronouncement
of authority, and entertain the liveliest skepticism about the processes
of law and justice. I feel no urge to conform to the behavior of the
majority of my fellow citizens. I'm a pain in the neck.
<P>
My behavior is far from flawless. I lived and thrived in Austin, Texas
in the 1970s and 1980s, in a festering milieu of arty
crypto-intellectual hippies. I've committed countless "crimes," like millions
of other people in my generation. These crimes were of the glamorous
"victimless" variety, but they would surely have served to put me in
prison had I done them, say, in front of the State Legislature.
<P>
Had I lived a hundred years ago as I live today, I would probably have
been lynched by outraged fellow Texans as a moral abomination. If I
lived in Iran today and wrote and thought as I do, I would probably be
tried and executed.
<P>
As far as I can tell, moral relativism is a fact of life. I think it
might be possible to outwardly conform to every jot and tittle of the
taboos of one's society, while feeling no emotional or intellectual
commitment to them. I understand that certain philosophers have argued
that this is morally proper behavior for a good citizen. But I can't
live that life. I feel, sincerely, that my society is engaged in many
actions which are foolish and shortsighted and likely to lead to our
destruction. I feel that our society must change, and change radically,
in a process that will cause great damage to our present system of
values. This doesn't excuse my own failings, which I regret, but it does
explain, I hope, why my lifestyle and my actions are not likely to make
authority feel entirely comfortable.
<P>
Knowledge is power. The rise of computer networking, of the Information
Society, is doing strange and disruptive things to the processes by
which power and knowledge are currently distributed.  Knowledge and
information, supplied through these new conduits, are highly corrosive
to the status quo. People living in the midst of technological
revolution are living outside the law: not necessarily because they mean
to break laws, but because the laws are vague, obsolete, overbroad,
draconian, or unenforceable. Hackers break laws as a matter of course,
and some have been punished unduly for relatively minor infractions not
motivated by malice. Even computer police, seeking earnestly to
apprehend and punish wrongdoers, have been accused of abuse of their
offices, and of violation of the Constitution and the civil statutes.
These police may indeed have committed these "crimes." Some officials
have already suffered grave damage to their reputations and careers --
all the time convinced that they were morally in the right; and, like
the hackers they pursued, never feeling any genuine sense of shame,
remorse, or guilt.
<P>
I have lived, and still live, in a counterculture, with its own system
of values. Counterculture -- Bohemia -- is never far from criminality.
"To live outside the law you must be honest" was Bob Dylan's classic
hippie motto. A Bohemian finds romance in the notion that "his clothes
are dirty but his hands are clean." But there's danger in setting aside
the strictures of the law to linchpin one's honor on one's personal
integrity. If you throw away the rulebook to rely on your individual
conscience you will be put in the way of temptation.
<P>
And temptation is a burden. It hurts. It is grotesquely easy to justify,
to rationalize, an action of which one should properly be ashamed. In
investigating the milieu of computer-crime I have come into contact with
a world of temptation formerly closed to me.  Nowadays, it would take no
great effort on my part to break into computers, to steal long-distance
telephone service, to ingratiate myself with people who would merrily
supply me with huge amounts of illicitly copied software. I could even
build pipe-bombs. I haven't done these things, and disapprove of them;
in fact, having come to know these practices better than I cared to, I
feel sincere revulsion for them now. But this knowledge is a kind of
power, and power is tempting. Journalistic objectivity, or the urge to
play with ideas, cannot entirely protect you. Temptation clings to the
mind like a series of small but nagging weights. Carrying these weights
may make you stronger. Or they may drag you down.
<P>
"His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean." It's a fine ideal, when
you can live up to it. Like a lot of Bohemians, I've gazed with a fine
disdain on certain people in power whose clothes were clean but their
hands conspicuously dirty. But I've also met a few people eager to pat
me on the back, whose clothes were dirty and their hands as well.
They're not pleasant company.
<P>
Somehow one must draw a line. I'm not very good at drawing lines. When
other people have drawn me a line, I've generally been quite anxious to
have a good long contemplative look at the other side. I don't feel much
confidence in my ability to draw these lines. But I feel that I should.
The world won't wait. It only took a few guys with pool cues and
switchblades to turn Woodstock Nation into Altamont. Haight-Ashbury was
once full of people who could trust anyone they'd smoked grass with and
love anyone they'd dropped acid with -- for about six months. Soon the
place was aswarm with speed-freaks and junkies, and heaven help us if
they didn't look just like the love-bead dudes from the League of
Spiritual Discovery. Corruption exists, temptation exists. Some people
fall. And the temptation is there for all of us, all the time.
<P>
I've come to draw a line at money. It's not a good line, but it's
something. There are certain activities that are unorthodox, dubious,
illegal or quasi-legal, but they might perhaps be justified by an honest
person with unconventional standards. But in my opinion, when you're
making a commercial living from breaking the law, you're beyond the
pale. I find it hard to accept your countercultural sincerity when
you're grinning and pocketing the cash, compadre.
<P>
I can understand a kid swiping phone service when he's broke, powerless,
and dying to explore the new world of the networks. I don't approve of
this, but I can understand it. I scorn to do this myself, and I never
have; but I don't find it so heinous that it deserves pitiless
repression. But if you're stealing phone service and selling it -- if
you've made yourself a miniature phone company and you're pimping off
the energy of others just to line your own pockets -- you're a thief.
When the heat comes to put you away, don't come crying "brother" to me.
<P>
If you're creating software and giving it away, you're a fine human
being. If you're writing software and letting other people copy it and
try it out as shareware, I appreciate your sense of trust, and if I like
your work, I'll pay you. If you're copying other people's software and
giving it away, you're damaging other people's interests, and should be
ashamed, even if you're posing as a glamorous info-liberating
subversive. But if you're copying other people's software and selling
it, you're a crook and I despise you.
<P>
Writing and spreading viruses is a vile, hurtful, and shameful activity
that I unreservedly condemn.
<P>
There's something wrong with the Information Society. There's something
wrong with the idea that "information" is a commodity like a desk or a
chair. There's something wrong with patenting software algorithms.
There's something direly mean spirited and ungenerous about inventing a
language and then renting it out to other people to speak. There's
something unprecedented and sinister in this process of creeping
commodification of data and knowledge. A computer is something too close
to the human brain for me to rest entirely content with someone
patenting or copyrighting the process of its thought.  There's something
sick and unworkable about an economic system which has already spewed
forth such a vast black market. I don't think democracy will thrive in a
milieu where vast empires of data are encrypted, restricted,
proprietary, confidential, top secret, and sensitive. I fear for the
stability of a society that builds sand castles out of databits and
tries to stop a real-world tide with royal commands.
<P>
Whole societies can fall. In Eastern Europe we have seen whole nations
collapse in a slough of corruption. In pursuit of their unworkable
economic doctrine, the Marxists doubled and redoubled their efforts at
social control, while losing all sight of the values that make life
worth living. At last the entire power structure was so discredited that
the last remaining shred of moral integrity could only be found in
Bohemia: in dissidents and dramatists and their illegal samizdat
underground fanzines. Their clothes were dirty but their hands were
clean. The only agitprop poster Vaclav Havel needed was a sign saying
<EM>Vaclav Havel Guarantees Free Elections.</EM> He'd never held power, but
people believed him, and they believed his Velvet Revolution friends.
<P>
I wish there were people in the Computer Revolution who could inspire,
and deserved to inspire, that level of trust. I wish there were people
in the Electronic Frontier whose moral integrity unquestionably matched
the unleashed power of those digital machines. A society is in dire
straits when it puts its Bohemia in power. I tremble for my country when
I contemplate this prospect. And yet it's possible. If dire straits
come, it can even be the last best hope.
<P>
The issues that enmeshed me in 1990 are not going to go away. I became
involved as a writer and journalist, because I felt it was right.
Having made that decision, I intend to stand by my commitment. I expect
to stay involved in these issues, in this debate, for the rest of my
life. These are timeless issues: civil rights, knowledge, power, freedom
and privacy, the necessary steps that a civilized society must take to
protect itself from criminals. There is no finality in politics; it
creates itself anew, it must be dealt with every day.
<P>
The future is a dark road and our speed is headlong. I didn't ask for
power or responsibility. I'm a science fiction writer, I only wanted to
play with Big Ideas in my cheerfully lunatic sandbox. What little
benefit I myself can contribute to society would likely be best employed
in writing better SF novels. I intend to write those better novels, if I
can. But in the meantime I seem to have accumulated a few odd shreds of
influence. It's a very minor kind of power, and doubtless more than I
deserve; but power without responsibility is a monstrous thing.
<P>
In writing HACKER CRACKDOWN, I tried to describe the truth as other
people saw it. I see it too, with my own eyes, but I can't yet pretend
to understand what I'm seeing. The best I can do, it seems to me, is to
try to approach the situation as an open-minded person of goodwill.  I
therefore offer the following final set of principles, which I hope will
guide me in the days to come.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
I'll listen to anybody, and I'll try to imagine myself in their
situation.
<P>
<LI>
I'll assume goodwill on the part of others until they fully earn my
distrust.
<P>
<LI>
I won't cherish grudges. I'll forgive those who change their minds and
actions, just as I reserve the right to change my own mind and actions.
<P>
<LI>
I'll look hard for the disadvantages to others, in the things that give
me advantage. I won't assume that the way I live today is the natural
order of the universe, just because I happen to be benefiting from it at
the moment.
</UL>
<P>
And while I don't plan to give up making money from my ethically dubious
cyberpunk activities, I hope to temper my impropriety by giving more
work away for no money at all.

FIRST NATION IN CYBERSPACE
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>Twenty million strong and adding a million new users a month, the Internet
is suddenly the place to be.</EM>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 Back in the mid-1960s, at the height of the cold war, the Department of
Defense faced a tough question: How could orders be issued to the armed
forces if the U.S. were ravaged by a nuclear assault? The communication
hubs in place at the time -- the telephone switching offices and the radio
and TV broadcast stations -- were not only vulnerable to attack, they
would also probably be the first to go. The Pentagon needed a military
command-and-control system that would continue to operate even if most of
the phone lines were in tatters and the switches had melted down.
<P>
 In 1964 a researcher at the Rand Corp. named Paul Baran came up with a
bizarre solution to this Strangelovian puzzle. He designed a
computer-communications network that had no hub, no central switching
station, no governing authority, and that assumed that the links
connecting any city to any other were totally unreliable. Baran's system
was the antithesis of the orderly, efficient phone network; it was more
like an electronic post office designed by a madman. In Baran's scheme,
each message was cut into tiny strips and stuffed into electronic
envelopes, called packets, each marked with the address of the sender and
the intended receiver. The packets were then released like so much
confetti into the web of interconnected computers, where they were tossed
back and forth over high-speed wires in the general direction of their
destination and reassembled when they finally got there. If any packets
were missing or mangled (and it was assumed that some would be), it was no
big deal; they were simply re-sent.
<P>
 Baran's packet-switching network, as it came to be called, might have
been a minor footnote in cold war history were it not for one contingency:
it took root in the computers that began showing up in universities and
government research laboratories in the late 1960s and early 1970s and
became, by a path as circuitous as one taken by those wayward packets, the
technological underpinning of the Internet.
<P>
 The Internet, for those who haven't been hanging out in cyberspace,
reading the business pages or following Doonesbury, is the mother of all
computer networks -- an anarchistic electronic freeway that has spread
uncontrollably and now circles the globe. It is at once the shining
archetype and the nightmare vision of the information highway that the
Clinton Administration has been touting and that the telephone and
cable-TV companies are racing to build. Much of what Bell Atlantic and
Time Warner are planning to sell -- interactivity, two-way communications,
multimedia info on demand -- the Internet already provides for free. And
because of its cold war roots, the Internet has one quality that makes it
a formidable competitor: you couldn't destroy it if you tried.
<P>
 Nobody owns the Internet, and no single organization controls its use. In
the mid-1980s the National Science Foundation built the high-speed,
long-distance data lines that form Internet's U.S. backbone. But the major
costs of running the network are shared in a cooperative arrangement by
its primary users: universities, national labs, high-tech corporations and
foreign governments. Two years ago, the NSF lifted restrictions against
commercial use of the Internet, and in September the White House announced
a plan to make it the starting point for an even grander concept called
the National Information Infrastructure.
<P>
 Suddenly the Internet is the place to be. College students are queuing up
outside computing centers to get online. Executives are ordering new
business cards that show off their Internet addresses. Millions of people
around the world are logging on to tap into libraries, call up satellite
weather photos, download free computer programs and participate in
discussion groups with everyone from lawyers to physicists to
sadomasochists. Even the President and Vice President have their own
Internet accounts (although they aren't very good at answering their
mail). "It's the Internet boom," says network activist Mitch Kapor, who
thinks the true sign that popular interest has reached critical mass came
this summer when the New Yorker printed a cartoon showing two
computer-savvy canines with the caption, "On the Internet, nobody knows
you're a dog."
<P>
 But the Internet is not ready for prime time. There are no TV Guides to
sort through the 5,000 discussion groups or the 2,500 electronic
newsletters or the tens of thousands of computers with files to share.
Instead of feeling surrounded by information, first-timers ("newbies" in
the jargon of the Net) are likely to find themselves adrift in a
borderless sea. Old-timers say the first wave of dizziness doesn't last
long. "It's like driving a car with a clutch," says Thomas Lunzer, a
network designer at SRI International, a California consulting firm.
"Once you figure it out, you can drive all over the place."
<P>
 But you must learn new languages (like UNIX), new forms of address (like
<TT>&lt;president@white house.gov&gt;</TT>) and new ways of expressing feeling (like those
ubiquitous sideways smiley faces), and you must master a whole set of
rules for how to behave, called netiquette. Rule No. 1: Don't ask dumb
questions. In fact, don't ask any questions at all before you've read the
FAQ (frequently asked questions) files. Otherwise you risk annoying a few
hundred thousand people who may either yell at you (IN ALL CAPS!) or,
worse still, ignore you.
<P>
 All that is starting to change, however, as successive waves of netters
demand, and eventually get, more user-friendly tools for navigating the
Internet. In fact, anyone with a desktop computer and a modem connecting
it to a phone line can now find ways into and around the network. "The
Internet isn't just computer scientists talking to one another anymore,"
says Glee Willis, the engineering librarian at the University of Nevada at
Reno and one of nearly 20,000 (mostly female) academic librarians who have
joined the Internet in the past five years. "It's a family place. It's a
place for perverts. It's everything rolled into one."
<P>
 As traffic swells, the Internet is beginning to suffer the problems of
any heavily traveled highway, including vandalism, break-ins and traffic
jams. "It's like an amusement park that's so successful that there are
long waits for the most popular rides," says David Farber, a professor of
information science at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the
network's original architects. And while most users wait patiently for the
access and information they need, rogue hackers use stolen passwords to
roam the network, exploring forbidden computers and reading other people's
mail.
<P>
 How big is the Internet? Part of its mystique is that nobody knows for
sure. The only fact that can be measured precisely is the number of
computers directly connected to it by high-speed links -- a figure that is
updated periodically by sending a computer program crawling around like a
Roto-Rooter, tallying the number of connections (last count: roughly 2
million). But that figure does not include military computers that for
security reasons are invisible to other users, or the hundreds of people
who may share a single Internet host. Nor does it include millions more
who dial into the Internet through the growing number of commercial
gateways, such as Panix and Netcom, which offer indirect telephone access
for $10 to $20 a month. When all these users are taken into account, the
total number of people around the world who can get into the Internet one
way or another may be 20 million. "It's a large country," says Farber of
the Internet population. "We ought to apply to the U.N. as the first
nation in cyberspace."
<P>
 That nation is about to get even bigger as the major commercial computer
networks -- Prodigy, CompuServe, America Online, GEnie and Delphi Internet
Service -- begin to dismantle the walls that have separated their private
operations from the public Internet. The success of the Internet is a
matter of frustration to the owners of the commercial networks, who have
tried all sorts of marketing tricks and still count fewer than 5 million
subscribers among them. Most commercial networks now allow electronic mail
to pass between their services and the Internet. Delphi, which was
purchased by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. in September, began providing its
customers full Internet access last summer. America Online (which
publishes an electronic version of Time) is scheduled to begin offering
limited Internet services later this month.
<P>
 People who use these new entry points into the Net may be in for a shock.
Unlike the family-oriented commercial services, which censor messages they
find offensive, the Internet imposes no restrictions. Anybody can start a
discussion on any topic and say anything. There have been sporadic
attempts by local network managers to crack down on the raunchier
discussion groups, but as Internet pioneer <VAR>John Gilmore</VAR>
<A NAME="IDX555"></A>
puts it, "The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."
<P>
 The casual visitor to the newsgroups on the Usenet (a bulletin-board
system that began as a competitor to the Internet but has been largely
subsumed by it) will discover discussion groups labeled, according to the
Net's idiosyncratic cataloging system, alt.sex.masturbation,
alt.sex.bondage and alt.sex.fetish.feet. On Internet Relay Chat, a global
24-hour-a-day message board, one can stumble upon imaginary orgies played
out with one-line typed commands
("Now I'm taking off your shirt..."). In
<TT>alt.binaries.pictures.erotica</TT>, a user can peek at snapshots that
would make a sailor blush.
<P>
 But those who focus on the Internet's sexual content risk missing the
point. For every sexually oriented discussion group there are hundreds on
tamer and often more substantial topics ranging from bungee jumping to
particle physics. Last week Virginia college student <VAR>Chris Glover</VAR>
responded to a distressed message from a suicidal undergraduate in Denver.
After two hours of messages back and forth, Glover was able to pinpoint
<A NAME="IDX556"></A>
the woman's location and call for help.
<P>
 With all this variety, Internet users are unimpressed by television's
promise of a 500-channel future. The Internet already delivers 10,000
channels, and the only obstacle that prevents it from carrying live TV
pictures is the bandwidth (or carrying capacity) of the data lines. Some
video clips -- and at least one full-length video movie -- are already
available on the network. And last spring, writer Carl Malamud began using
the Internet to distribute a weekly "radio" interview show called Geek
of the Week. Malamud is undeterred by the fact that it takes a computer
about an hour over a high-speed modem to capture the 30 minutes of sound
that a $10 radio can pick up instantly for free. But bandwidth capacity
has nowhere to go but up, says Malamud, and its cost will only go down.
<P>
 The Internet, however, will have to go through some radical changes
before it can join the world of commerce. Subsidized for so long by the
Federal Government, its culture is not geared to normal business
activities. It does not take kindly to unsolicited advertisements; use
electronic mail to promote your product and you are likely to be inundated
with hate mail directed not only at you personally but also at your
supervisor, your suppliers and your customers as well. "It's a perfect
Marxist state, where almost nobody does any business," says Farber. "But
at some point that will have to change."
<P>
 The change has already begun. NSF's contribution now represents about 10%
of the total cost of the network, and the agency is scheduled to start
phasing out its support next April, removing at the same time what few
restrictions still remain against commercial activity. According to Tim
O'Reilly, president of O'Reilly &#38; Associates, a publisher experimenting
with advertiser-supported Internet magazines, the system could evolve in
one of two ways: either entrepreneurs will manage to set up shop on a
free-market version of the Internet, or some consortium will take the
whole thing over and turn it into a giant CompuServe. "That's an
outcome," O'Reilly says, "that would effectively destroy the Internet as
we know it."
<P>
 As the traffic builds and the billboards go up, some Internet veterans
are mourning the old electronic freeway. "I feel kind of sad about it,"
says Denise Caruso, editorial director of Friday Holdings, a publisher
specializing in new media. "It was such a dynamic, pulsing thing. I
wonder whether we shouldn't have left it alone." Others see the period of
uncertainty ahead as a rare opportunity for citizens to shape their own
technological destiny. "We need... a firm idea of the kind of media
environment we would like to see in the future," warns Howard Rheingold
in his new book, The Virtual Community. While it may be difficult for
communities as diverse as those on the Internet to set their own agenda,
it seems increasingly likely that if they don't, someone else will do it
for them.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"I just returned from a network meeting in San Diego today and thought you
would be interested in my interpretation of what NSF proposes for the National
Education and Research Network (NREN). Rather than comment specifically, I
decided it would be interesting to write a <EM>parody</EM> which relates the NREN to
the construction of a national super highway. Doing so removes the highly
technical aspects of the overall planned functions the NREN.
Please excuse this style, but I think its the only way to explain my
understanding of their plan in a way that does not immediately get very
technical. It may be flawed, but the information is based upon
Hans-Werner Braun's presentation.... as I understood it."

<P>
The National Science Foundation is in the process of developing plans to
build a national super highway that will advance transportation technology in
our country. The super highway proposed will replace the existing interstate
highway system and allow speeds of at least 240 MPH. the following interview
with NSF developers explores their current plans.
<P>
*
<P>
ME: I understand you are building a new Super national
highway<A NAME="FOOT8" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT8">(8)</A> to serve the
<A NAME="IDX562"></A>
purposes of advancing ground transportation throughout our county.
<P>
NSF: Yes we are, as a part of an earlier initiative sponsored by the then
Senator Gore. We are very excited about the technology that will allow
transportation speeds of
240 MPH<A NAME="FOOT9" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT9">(9)</A> across the country.
  
ME: That sounds exciting, how will it be built?
<P>
NSF: Well, we will have this super highway designed to allow the high speed
travel<A NAME="FOOT10" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT10">(10)</A>
and it will have six entrance/exit
<A NAME="IDX563"></A>
ramps.<A NAME="FOOT11" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT11">(11)</A>
 
ME: Ahh.... that doesn't sound like very many ramps, where will they be
located?
<P>
NSF: Well, several years ago we funded the establishment of six gourmet
restaurants<A NAME="FOOT12" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT12">(12)</A>
scattered across the country, we are going to fund the building
of the super highway and access ramps at the restaurant locations. We are
however allowing the ramp
contractor<A NAME="FOOT13" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT13">(13)</A>
to build as many ramps as he wishes, at his own expense.
<P>
ME: I assume then the contractor for the
highway<A NAME="FOOT14" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT14">(14)</A>
builds ramps where ever it makes sense to optimize access.
<P>
NSF: Well, not exactly. We are separating the contracts for the ramps and the
highway so the bidders can be very competitive.
<P>
ME: I see. How to you plan to connect the rest of the interstate highway
system<A NAME="FOOT15" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT15">(15)</A>
to your super national highway?
<P>
NSF: Well actually, its not part of our plan. We are having the highway and
access ramps built for us, its up to the states or other government agencies
to provide the highways to the access ramps. We will however fund a few temporary
roads<A NAME="FOOT16" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT16">(16)</A>
to connect parts of the existing interstate highway system, but don't
intend to make them permanent. Did I forget to mention that we will be
shutting down the existing interstate highway
system?<A NAME="FOOT17" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT17">(17)</A>
<P>
ME: You mean I will no longer be able to drive across the existing interstate
highway system?
<P>
NSF: Yes, it will be destroyed.
<P>
ME: OK, lets see If I understand. I have a state highway system for example,
and I put in a connecting highway to your super highway, and I can now travel
on it, right?
<P>
NSF: Well, no you can't. The super highway will only be used for vehicles that
can run
240 MPH<A NAME="FOOT18" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT18">(18)</A>
and we must approve every vehicle, destination, and trip
the vehicle
takes.<A NAME="FOOT19" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT19">(19)</A>
We don't want our super highway clogged with vehicles which can only travel
70 MPH!<A NAME="FOOT20" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT20">(20)</A>
<P>
ME: I'm confused. You mean you want my state for example, to build an access
road to a super highway it can't generally use?
<P>
NSF: Well, yes and no. You see we also want to encourage development of toll
roads in our
country.<A NAME="FOOT21" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT21">(21)</A>
Our six high speed access ramps are wide enough to
allow parallel toll roads to be accessed as well as our super highway. Private
road builders will be able to put in toll roads between our access ramps, for
a fee.
<P>
ME: So there will no longer be a "free" interstate highway system?
<P>
NSF: Right!
<P>
ME: Lets see if I got this straight. You build a national super highway that
has six access ramps located where you once established gourmet restaurants
and you destroy the interstate highway system. There are no plans to replicate the
functionality of the interstate highway systems, but you will allow private
toll road builders to use your wide access ramps and develop parallel toll
roads to your super highway. My state or the government has to build the roads
that lead to the super highway, but once there, cannot travel on it unless the
specific vehicle can run at 240 MPH and has specific permission from you to
travel on it.
<P>
NSF: You've got it!
<P>
ME: Well then you must have a very interesting reason to put this highway and
the access ramps at these restaurant locations.
<P>
NSF: Well, you see, the gourmet food business isn't what it used to be. Fast
food has really taken over in our country, we really need to preserve the
gourmet food
business.<A NAME="FOOT22" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT22">(22)</A>
High quality restaurants should be located right
off of classy high speed highways. We really would like to encourage restaurant
patrons to use the super highway so they can have breakfast in San Diego and
dinner in Champaign Illinois. We will be looking for patrons who can afford to
eat at multiple restaurants and we will let them ride the highway for free! Of
course they must have a vehicle that can go
240 MPH.<A NAME="FOOT23" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT23">(23)</A>
<P>
ME: I'm even more confused. How will I get across the country?
<P>
NSF: Well, if your state puts in an access road to one of our access ramps you
take it, and then exit-off on to one of the toll roads that will be built
parallel to our super highway.
<P>
ME: How fast will I be able to
go?<A NAME="FOOT24" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT24">(24)</A>
<P>
NSF: What ever the speed limit is on the toll road.
<P>
ME: What will it cost me to ride on it?
<P>
NSF: What ever the toll is. You see, we expect that several toll roads will be
developed. Competition! It should keep the price down.
<P>
ME: When the super highway is empty, how will it be used?
<P>
NSF: Well, we are telling the gourmet restaurants that they should work
together even though they will be competing with each other for
customers.<A NAME="FOOT25" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT25">(25)</A>
You know, they could develop plans to send trash to each other so they can
demonstrate how fast the transportation is on the super highway, it would be
in their best interest.<A NAME="FOOT26" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT26">(26)</A>
<P>
ME: Aren't there plans for development of high speed toll roads already in
progress by several toll road builders? What makes you think they will put
their roads in-between your access
ramps?<A NAME="FOOT27" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT27">(27)</A>
<P>
NSF: F.O.D.
<P>
ME: What?
<P>
NSF: Field Of Dreams. If we build it they will come.
<P>
ME: So again, tell me who pays for what?
<P>
NSF: The government funds the super highway and six access ramps. The toll
road providers build their own roads and pays an access fee for the ramps. The
states and other government agencies pay for any roads necessary to get to the
access ramps. When you get on a toll road and pay what ever the price is.
<P>
ME: And the only one's allowed to ride on the super highway are those persons
who have special vehicles that can go 240 MPH with your specific permission,
or those who can afford to frequent the gourmet restaurants and travel at 240
MPH. Everyone else takes the toll roads.
<P>
NSF: Right, but don't forget the trash runs between restaurants!
<P>
ME: Oh, how silly of me! Hmmmm. I wonder if this is really what Senator Gore
had in mind?

<H1><A NAME="SEC268" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC268">The Lingo</A></H1>
<iMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC=logos/bdgtti.gif>
<P>
This glossary is only a tiny subset of net.speak, all the various terms and
phrases that people regularly use on Internet.  For a more
complete (and more entertaining) reference, get a
copy of <i>The New Hacker's Dictionary</I>, which is based on a VERY
large text file called the Jargon File, edited by Eric Raymond
<A NAME="IDX565"></A>
<TT>&lt;eric@snark.thyrsus.com&gt;</TT>.
<P>
The 2nd edition just came out in December 1993, and is available from
the MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02142.
The up-to-date version of the Jargon File
<i>The on-line hacker Jargon File, version 3.0, 29 July 1993</I>,
is kept on various FTP servers
<A NAME="IDX566"></A>
(e.g. from <B>ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu</B> as file <TT>`/pub/gnu/jarg300.txt.gz'</TT>).
<P>
<B><CODE>:-)</CODE></B>
This odd symbol is one of the ways a person can portray "mood" in
the very flat medium of computers--by using "smilies."  This is
"metacommunication," and there are literally hundreds of them, from
the obvious to the obscure (see section <A HREF="bdg_290.html#SEC293">The Unofficial Smiley Dictionary</A>).
This particular example expresses "happiness."  Don't see it?
Tilt your head to the left 90 degrees. Smilies, or smileys are also
used to denote sarcasm.
<P>
<B>ASCII</B>
Has two meanings.  ASCII is a universal computer code
for English letters and characters.  Computers store
all information as binary numbers. In ASCII, the
letter "A" is stored as 01000001, whether the computer
is made by IBM, Apple or Commodore.  ASCII also refers
to a method, or protocol, for copying files from one
computer to another over a network, in which neither
computer checks for any errors that might have been
caused by static or other problems.
<P>
<B>ANSI</B>
Computers use several different methods for deciding
how to put information on your screen and how your
keyboard interacts with the screen.  ANSI is one of
these "terminal emulation" methods.  Although most
popular on PC-based bulletin-board systems, it can also
be found on some Net sites.  To use it properly, you
will first have to turn it on, or enable it, in your
communications software.
<P>
<B>ARPANet</B>
A predecessor of the Internet.  Started in 1969 with
funds from the Defense Department's Advanced Projects
Research Agency.
<P>
<B>Backbone</B>
A high-speed network that connects several powerful
computers.  In the U.S., the backbone of the Internet is
often considered the NSFNet, a government funded link
between a handful of supercomputer sites across the
country.
<P>
<B>Baud</B>
The speed at which modems transfer data.  One baud is
roughly equal to one bit per second.  It takes eight
bits to make up one letter or character.  Modems rarely
transfer data at exactly the same speed as their listed
baud rate because of static or computer problems. More
expensive modems use systems, such as Microcom Network
Protocol (MNP), which can correct for these errors or
which "compress" data to speed up transmission.
<P>
<B>BITNet</B>
Another, academically oriented, international computer
network, which uses a different set of computer
instructions to move data.  It is easily accessible to
Internet users through e-mail, and provides a large
number of conferences and databases.  Its name comes from
"Because It's Time."
<P>
<B>Bounce</B>
What your e-mail does when it cannot get to its
recipient -- it bounces back to you -- unless it goes 
off into the ether, never to be found again.
<P>
<B>Command line</B>
On Unix host systems, this is where you tell the
machine what you want it to do, by entering commands.
<P>
<B>Communications software</B>
A program that tells a modem how to work.
<P>
<B>Daemon</B>
An otherwise harmless Unix program that normally works
out of sight of the user. On the Internet, you'll most
likely encounter it only when your e-mail is not
delivered to your recipient -- you'll get back your
original message plus an ugly message from a "mailer
daemon."
<P>
<B>Distribution</B>
A way to limit where your Usenet postings go.  Handy for
such things as "for sale" messages or discussions of
regional politics.
<P>
<B>Domain</B>
The last part of an Internet address, such as "news.com."
<P>
<B>Dot</B>
When you want to impress the net veterans you meet at
parties, say "dot" instead of "period," for example: "My
address is john at site dot domain dot com."
<P>
<B>Dot file</B>
A file on a Unix public-access system
that alters the way you or your messages interact with
that system.  For example, your .login file contains
various parameters for such things as the text editor you
get when you send a message.   When you do an ls command,
these files do not appear in the directory listing; do
<SAMP>`ls -a'</SAMP> to list them.
<P>
<B>Down</B>
When a public-access site runs into technical trouble,
and you can no longer gain access to it, it's down.
<P>
<B>Download</B>
Copy a file from a host system to your computer.  There
are several different methods, or protocols, for
downloading files, most of which periodically check the
file as it is being copied to ensure no information is
inadvertently destroyed or damaged during the process.
Some, such as XMODEM, only let you download one file at
a time.  Others, such as batch-YMODEM and ZMODEM, let
you type in the names of several files at once, which
are then automatically downloaded.
<P>
<B>EMACS</B>
From Editing MACroS.  A standard Unix text editor preferred by Unix types
that beginners tend to hate.                
<P>
<B>E-mail</B>
Electronic mail -- a way to send a private message to
somebody else on the Net. Used as both noun and verb.
<P>
<B>Emoticon</B>
A smiley. See <CODE>:-)</CODE>.
<P>
<B>F2F</B>
Face to Face.  When you actually meet those people you
been corresponding with/flaming.
<P>
<B>FAQ</B>
Frequently Asked Questions.  A compilation of answers to
these.  Many Usenet newsgroups have these files, which
are posted once a month or so for beginners.
<P>
<B>FYI</B>
For Your Interest.
<P>
<B>Film at 11</B>
One reaction to an overwrought argument: "Imminent death
of the Net predicted. Film at 11."

An Internet program that lets you get some bit of
information about another user, provided they have first
created a <TT>`.plan'</TT> file.
<P>
<B>Flame</B>
Online yelling and/or ranting directed at somebody else.
Often results in flame wars, which occasionally turn into
holy wars (See section <A HREF="bdg_73.html#SEC76">Usenet: from Flame Wars to Killfiles</A>).
<P>
<B>Followup</B>
A Usenet posting that is a response to an earlier
message.
<P>
<B>Foo/foobar</B>
A sort of online algebraic place holder, for example: "If
you want to know when another site is run by a for-profit
company, look for an address in the form of
<TT>&lt;foo@foobar.com&gt;</TT>."
<P>

<P>
<B>Hacker</B>
On the Net, unlike among the general public, this is not
a bad person; it is simply somebody who enjoys stretching
hardware and software to their limits, seeing just what 
they can get their computers to do.  What many people 
call hackers, net.denizens refer to as crackers.
<P>

Two modems trying to connect first do this to agree on
how to transfer data.
<P>
<B>Hang</B>
When a modem fails to hang up.
<P>

outside the research and government community.
<P>
<B>IMHO</B>

address, which is often that of a computer that
automates the process.
<P>
<B>MIME</B>
Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions. A currently (1993)
heavily developing extension of the Internet
mail protocol, that enables sending of 8 bit e-mail messages,

linked through fiber optic cables, phone lines and
satellites.
<P>
<B>Newbie</B>
Somebody new to the Net.  Sometimes used derogatorily by 
<B>net.veterans</B> who have forgotten that they, too, were

<P>
"Dear Emily Postnews"
<P>
<EM>Ms Emily Postnews</EM>, foremost authority on proper net behaviour,
<A NAME="IDX569"></A>
gives her advice on how to act on the net.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Dear Miss Postnews: How long should my signature be?</I>
-- <TT>&lt;verbose@noisy&gt;</TT>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Dear Verbose: Please try and make your signature as long as you
can.  It's much more important than your article, of course, so try
to have more lines of signature than actual text.
<P>
Try to include a large graphic made of ASCII characters, plus lots of
cute quotes and slogans.  People will never tire of reading these
pearls of wisdom again and again, and you will soon become personally
associated with the joy each reader feels at seeing yet another
delightful repeat of your signature.
<P>
Be sure as well to include a complete map of USENET with each
signature, to show how anybody can get mail to you from any site in
the world.  Be sure to include Internet gateways as well.  Also tell
people on your own site how to mail to you.  Give independent
addresses for Internet, UUCP, and BITNET, even if they're all the
same.
<P>
Aside from your reply address, include your full name, company and
organization.  It's just common courtesy -- after all, in some
newsreaders people have to type an <EM>entire</EM> keystroke to go back to
the top of your article to see this information in the header.
<P>
By all means include your phone number and street address in every
single article.  People are always responding to usenet articles with
phone calls and letters.  It would be silly to go to the extra trouble
of including this information only in articles that need a response by
conventional channels!
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Dear Emily: Today I posted an article and forgot to include my
signature.  What should I do?</I>
-- <TT>&lt;forgetful@myvax&gt;</TT>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Dear Forgetful: Rush to your terminal right away and post an
article that says, "Oops, I forgot to post my signature with that last
article.  Here it is."
<P>
Since most people will have forgotten your earlier article,
(particularly since it dared to be so boring as to not have a nice,
juicy signature) this will remind them of it.  Besides, people care
much more about the signature anyway.  See the previous letter for
more important details.
<P>
Also, be sure to include your signature TWICE in each article.  That
way you're sure people will read it.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Dear Ms. Postnews: I couldn't get mail through to somebody on
another site.  What should I do?</I>
-- <TT>&lt;eager@beaver.dam&gt;</TT>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Dear Eager: No problem, just post your message to a group that a
lot of people read.  Say, "This is for John Smith.  I couldn't get
mail through so I'm posting it.  All others please ignore."
<P>
This way tens of thousands of people will spend a few seconds scanning
over and ignoring your article, using up over 16 man-hours their
collective time, but you will be saved the terrible trouble of
checking through Usenet maps or looking for alternate routes.  Just
think, if you couldn't distribute your message to 30,000 other
computers, you might actually have to (gasp) call directory assistance
for 60 cents, or even phone the person.  This can cost as much as a
few DOLLARS (!) for a 5 minute call!
<P>
And certainly it's better to spend 10 to 20 dollars of other people's
money distributing the message then for you to have to waste $9 on an
overnight letter, or even 29 cents on a stamp!
<P>
Don't forget.  The world will end if your message doesn't get through,
so post it as many places as you can.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: What about a test message?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> It is important, when testing, to test the entire net.  Never test
merely a subnet distribution when the whole net can be done.  Also put
"please ignore" on your test messages, since we all know that
everybody always skips a message with a line like that.  Don't use a
subject like "My sex is female but I demand to be addressed as male."
because such articles are read in depth by all USEnauts.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: Somebody just posted that Roman Polanski directed Star Wars.  What
should I do?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Post the correct answer at once!  We can't have people go on
believing that!  Very good of you to spot this.  You'll probably be
the only one to make the correction, so post as soon as you can.  No
time to lose, so certainly don't wait a day, or check to see if
somebody else has made the correction.
<P>
And it's not good enough to send the message by mail.  Since you're
the only one who really knows that it was Francis Coppola, you have to
inform the whole net right away!
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: I read an article that said, "reply by mail, I'll summarize."  What
should I do?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Post your response to the whole net.  That request applies only to
dumb people who don't have something interesting to say.  Your
postings are much more worthwhile than other people's, so it would be
a waste to reply by mail.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: I collected replies to an article I wrote, and now it's time to
summarize.  What should I do?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Simply concatenate all the articles together into a big file and
post that.  On USENET, this is known as a summary.  It lets people
read all the replies without annoying newsreaders getting in the way.
Do the same when summarizing a vote.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: I saw a long article that I wish to rebut carefully, what should I do?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Include the entire text with your article, particularly the
signature, and include your comments closely packed between the lines.
Be sure to post, and not mail, even though your article looks like a
reply to the original.  Everybody <EM>loves</EM> to read those long
point-by-point debates, especially when they evolve into name-calling
and lots of "Is too!" -- "Is not!" -- "Is too, twizot!" exchanges.
<P>
Be sure to follow-up everything, and never let another person get in
the last word on a net debate.  Why, if people let other people have
the last word, then discussions would actually stop!  Remember, other
net readers aren't nearly as clever as you, and if somebody posts
something wrong, the readers can't possibly realize that on their own
without your elucidations.  If somebody gets insulting in their net
postings, the best response is to get right down to their level and
fire a return salvo.  When I read one net person make an insulting
attack on another, I always immediately take it as gospel unless a
rebuttal is posted.  It never makes me think less of the insulter, so
it's your duty to respond.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: How can I choose what groups to post in?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Pick as many as you can, so that you get the widest audience.
After all, the net exists to give you an audience.  Ignore those who
suggest you should only use groups where you think the article is
highly appropriate.  Pick all groups where anybody might even be
slightly interested.
<P>
Always make sure followups go to all the groups.  In the rare event
that you post a followup which contains something original, make sure
you expand the list of groups.  Never include a "Followup-to:" line in
the header, since some people might miss part of the valuable
discussion in the fringe groups.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: How about an example?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Ok.  Let's say you want to report that Gretzky has been traded from
the Oilers to the Kings.  Now right away you might think
<TT>rec.sport.hockey</TT>
would be enough.  WRONG.  Many more people might be
interested.  This is a big trade!  Since it's a NEWS article, it
belongs in the
<TT>news.*</TT>
hierarchy as well.  If you are a news admin, or
there is one on your machine, try
<TT>news.admin</TT>.
If not, use
<TT>news.misc</TT>.
<P>
The Oilers are probably interested in geology, so try
<TT>sci.geo.fluids</TT>.
He is a big star, so post to
<TT>sci.astro</TT>, and
<TT>sci.space</TT>
because they are
also interested in stars.  And of course
<TT>comp.dcom.telecom</TT>
because he
was born in the birthplace of the telephone.  And because he's
Canadian, post to
<TT>soc.culture.Ontario.southwestern</TT>.
But that group
doesn't exist, so cross-post to
<TT>news.groups</TT>
suggesting it should be
created.  With this many groups of interest, your article will be
quite bizarre, so post to
<TT>talk.bizarre</TT>
as well.  (And post to
<TT>comp.std.mumps</TT>,
since they hardly get any articles there, and a "comp"
group will propagate your article further.)
<P>
You may also find it is more fun to post the article once in each
group.  If you list all the newsgroups in the same article, some
newsreaders will only show the the article to the reader once!  Don't
tolerate this.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: How do I create a newsgroup?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> The easiest way goes something like <SAMP>`inews -C newgroup ...'</SAMP>, and
while that will stir up lots of conversation about your new newsgroup,
it might not be enough.
<P>
First post a message in news.groups describing the group.  This is a
"call for discussion."  (If you see a call for discussion, immediately
post a one line message saying that you like or dislike the group.)
When proposing the group, pick a name with a TLA (three-letter
acronym) that will be understood only by "in" readers of the group.
<P>
After the call for discussion, post the call for flames, followed by a
call for arguments about the name and a call for run-on puns.
Eventually make a call for "votes." USENET is a democracy, so voters
can now all post their votes to ensure they get to all 30,000 machines
instead of just the person counting. Every few days post a long
summary of all the votes so that people can complain about bad mailers
and double votes.  It means you'll be more popular and get lots of
mail.  At the end of 21 days you can post the vote results so that
people can argue about all the technical violations of the guidelines
you made.  Blame them on the moderator-of-the-week for
news.announce.newgroups.  Then your group might be created.
<P>
To liven up discussion, choose a good cross-match for your hierarchy
and group.  For example, comp.race.formula1 or soc.vlsi.design would
be good group names.  If you want your group created quickly, include
an interesting word like "sex" or "activism."  To avoid limiting
discussion, make the name as broad as possible, and don't forget that
TLA.
<P>
If possible, count votes from a leaf site with a once-a-week polled
connection to botswanavax.  Schedule the vote during your relay site's
head crash if possible.
<P>
Under no circumstances use the trial group method, because it
eliminates the discussion, flame, pun, voting and guideline-violation
accusation phases, thus taking all the fun out of it.  To create an
ALT group, simply issue the creation command.  Then issue an rmgroup
and some more newgroup messages to save other netters the trouble of
doing that part.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: I cant spell worth a dam.  I hope your going too tell me what to do?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Don't worry about how your articles look.  Remember it's the
message that counts, not the way it's presented.  Ignore the fact that
sloppy spelling in a purely written forum sends out the same silent
messages that soiled clothing would when addressing an audience.
<P>
<i>Q: How should I pick a subject for my articles?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Keep it short and meaningless.  That way people will be forced to
actually read your article to find out what's in it.  This means a
bigger audience for you, and we all know that's what the net is for.
If you do a followup, be sure and keep the same subject, even if it's
totally meaningless and not part of the same discussion.  If you
don't, you won't catch all the people who are looking for stuff on the
original topic, and that means less audience for you.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: What sort of tone should I take in my article?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Be as outrageous as possible.  If you don't say outlandish things,
and fill your article with libelous insults of net people, you may not
stick out enough in the flood of articles to get a response.  The more
insane your posting looks, the more likely it is that you'll get lots
of followups.  The net is here, after all, so that you can get lots of
attention.
<P>
If your article is polite, reasoned and to the point, you may only get
mailed replies.  Yuck!
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: The posting software suggested I had too long a signature and too
many lines of included text in my article.  What's the best course?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Such restrictions were put in the software for no reason at all, so
don't even try to figure out why they might apply to your article.
Turns out most people search the net to find nice articles that
consist of the complete text of an earlier article plus a few lines.
<P>
In order to help these people, fill your article with dummy original
lines to get past the restrictions.  Everybody will thank you for it.
<P>
For your signature, I know it's tough, but you will have to read it in
with the editor.  Do this twice to make sure it's firmly in there.  By
the way, to show your support for the free distribution of
information, be sure to include a copyright message forbidding
transmission of your article to sites whose USENET politics you don't
like.
<P>
Also, if you do have a lot of free time and want to trim down the text
in your article, be sure to delete some of the attribution lines so
that it looks like the original author of -- say -- a plea for world
peace actually wrote the followup calling for the nuking of Bermuda.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: They just announced on the radio that the United States has invaded
Iraq.  Should I post?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Of course.  The net can reach people in as few as 3 to 5 days.
It's the perfect way to inform people about such news events long
after the broadcast networks have covered them.  As you are probably
the only person to have heard the news on the radio, be sure to post
as soon as you can.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: I have this great joke.  You see, these three strings walk into a bar...</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Oh dear.  Don't spoil it for me.  Submit it to rec.humor, and post
it to the moderator of
<TT>rec.humor.funny</TT>
at the same time.  I'm sure he's never seen that joke.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: What computer should I buy?  An Atari ST or an Amiga?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Cross post that question to the Atari and Amiga groups.  It's an
interesting and novel question that I am sure they would love to
investigate in those groups.  There is no need to read the groups in
advance or examine the "frequently asked question" lists to see if the
topic has already been dealt with.  In fact, you don't need to read
the group at all, and you can tell people that in your query.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: What about other important questions?  How should I know when to
post?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Always post them.  It would be a big waste of your time to find a
knowledgeable user in one of the groups and ask through private mail
if the topic has already come up.  Much easier to bother thousands of
people with the same question.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: Somebody just posted a query to the net, and I want to get the
answer too.  What should I do?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Immediately post a following, including the complete text of the
query.  At the bottom add, "Me too!"  If somebody else has done this,
follow up their article and add "Me three," or whatever number is
appropriate.  Don't forget your full signature.  After all, if you
just mail the original poster and ask for a copy of the answers, you
will simply clutter the poster's mailbox, and save people who do
answer the question the joyful duty of noting all the "me (n)s" and
sending off all the multiple copies.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: What is the measure of a worthwhile group?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Why, it's Volume, Volume, Volume.  Any group that has lots of noise
in it must be good.  Remember, the higher the volume of material in a
group, the higher percentage of useful, factual and insightful
articles you will find.  In fact, if a group can't demonstrate a high
enough volume, it should be deleted from the net.
<P>
*
<P>
<i>Q: Emily, I'm having a serious disagreement with somebody on the net.
I tried complaints to his sysadmin, organizing mail campaigns, called
for his removal from the net and phoning his employer to get him
fired.  Everybody laughed at me.  What can I do?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Go to the daily papers.  Most modern reporters are top-notch
computer experts who will understand the net, and your problems,
perfectly.  They will print careful, reasoned stories without any
errors at all, and surely represent the situation properly to the
public.  The public will also all act wisely, as they are also fully
cognizant of the subtle nature of net society.
<P>
Papers never sensationalize or distort, so be sure to point out things
like racism and sexism wherever they might exist.  Be sure as well
that they understand that all things on the net, particularly insults,
are meant literally.  Link what transpires on the net to the causes of
the Holocaust, if possible.  If regular papers won't take the story,
go to a tabloid paper -- they are always interested in good stories.
<P>
By arranging all this free publicity for the net, you'll become very
well known.  People on the net will wait in eager anticipation for
your every posting, and refer to you constantly.  You'll get more mail
than you ever dreamed possible -- the ultimate in net success.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>"News articles are separated into divisions called 
newsgroups. Each division is supposed to limit itself 
to a single topic, and the name of the group is 
supposed to give you some idea as to the content of the
group. These groups are then organized into hierarchies
of related topics. Usenet Network News started out with 
just two hierarchies, mod and net. The mod hierarchy 
had those groups that had a person as the moderator to
edit and control the information. The net hierarchy 
handled all other groups. With the release of B News 
and its ability to have any single group be moderated
or open, the great renaming was undertaken."</EM>

<EM>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</EM> was founded in July of 1990 to
ensure that the principles embodied in the Constitution and the Bill of
<A NAME="IDX570"></A>
<A NAME="IDX571"></A>
<A NAME="IDX572"></A>
Rights are protected as new communications technologies emerge.
<P>
From the beginning, EFF has worked to shape our nation's communications
infrastructure and the policies that govern it in order to maintain and
enhance First Amendment, privacy and other democratic values. We believe
that our overriding public goal must be the creation of Electronic
Democracy, so our work focuses on the establishment of:
<P>

<LI>
new laws that protect citizens' basic Constitutional rights as they
use new communications technologies,
<P>

a policy of common carriage requirements for all network providers
so that all speech, no matter how controversial, will be carried without
discrimination,
<P>
<LI>
a National Public Network where voice, data and video services are
accessible to all citizens on an equitable and affordable basis, and
<P>
<LI>
a diversity of communities that enable all citizens to have a voice
in the information age.

<P>
EFF's Open Platform Proposal advocates that the nation's telecommunications
infrastructure providers offer affordable, widely available transmission of
voice, data and video information.  The telecommunications infrastructure
must promote broad access and enable citizens to receive and publish a
diversity of information.  In addition, a competitive environment must be
ensured to preserve the core principles of common carriage, universal
service and open standards.
<P>
In the near term, EFF supports the implementation of services such as ISDN
and ADSL, currently available digital technologies, for sending voice, data
<A NAME="IDX573"></A>
<A NAME="IDX574"></A>
and video at reasonable cost to consumers.
<P>
EFF supports federal funding to promote the development of network tools
and applications that will make the Internet and the NREN easier to use.
Although the NREN will be made up of services from commercial providers,
government also has a vital role to play in making grants to institutions
<A NAME="IDX575"></A>
that cannot afford to pay for Internet connectivity.

<P>
EFF has been working to ensure that common carrier principles are upheld in
the information age.  Common carrier principles require that network
providers carry all speech, regardless of its controversial content.
Common carriers must also provide all speakers and information providers
with equal, nondiscriminatory access to the network.
<P>
EFF chairs the Digital Security and Privacy Working Group, a coalition of
over 50 organizations--from computer software and hardware firms,
telecommunications and energy companies to civil liberties advocates--that
work on sound privacy policies in telecommunications.  For example, the
group has worked to oppose the FBI's Digital Telephony proposal and
<A NAME="IDX576"></A>
<A NAME="IDX577"></A>
<A NAME="IDX578"></A>
government-mandated encryption policies.
<P>
EFF is working to convince Congress that all measures supporting broader
public access to information should be enacted into law.  EFF supports an
Electronic Freedom of Information Act and other legislation to make
information more accessible to citizens in electronic formats.
<P>
EFF supports both legal and technical means to enhance privacy in
communications.  We, therefore, advocate all measures that ensure the
public's right to use the most effective encryption technologies available.

EFF sponsors legal cases where users' online civil liberties have been
violated.  The Steve Jackson Games case, decided in March of 1993,
established privacy protections for electronic publishers and users of
electronic mail.  We continue to monitor the online community for legal
<A NAME="IDX579"></A>
actions that merit EFF support.
<P>
EFF provides a free telephone hotline for members of the online community
who have questions regarding their legal rights.
<P>
Members of EFF's staff and board speak to law enforcement organizations,
state attorney bar associations and university classes on the work that we
do and how these groups can get involved.

EFF, in conjunction with the Consumer Federation of America and the
American Civil Liberties Union, coordinates and sponsors the Communications
Policy Forum (CPF).  CPF enables nonprofit organizations, computer and
communications firms, and government policymakers to come together in a
<A NAME="IDX580"></A>
nonpartisan setting to discuss communications policy goals and strategies.
<P>
EFF works with local organizations that support online communications
issues.  In September of 1993, EFF will cosponsor a cryptography conference
with a group in Austin, Texas.  Earlier this year, EFF sponsored a summit
of groups from around the country to discuss common goals.  We also
participate in an online mailing list for organizations that share our
interests.
<P>
EFF is a funder and organizer of the annual Computers, Freedom and Privacy
conference, where academics, civil libertarians, law enforcement officials
and computer users all meet to discuss the privacy implications of
communicating online.  Each year at the conference, EFF presents its
Pioneer awards to individuals who have made significant contributions to
<A NAME="IDX581"></A>
computer communications.
<P>
EFF maintains several communications forums online.  We have our own
Internet node, eff.org, which houses our FTP and Gopher sites and our
discussion areas, <TT>comp.org.eff.talk</TT> and <TT>comp.org.eff.news</TT>.
EFF also maintains conferences on the <EM>Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (WELL)</EM>,
<EM>CompuServe</EM> and <EM>America Online</EM>.

<EM>"The Gurus of Unix Meeting of Minds (GUMM) takes place Wednesday,
April 1, 2076 (check THAT in your perpetual calendar program), 14 feet above
the ground directly in front of the Milpitas Gumps.  Members will grep
each other by the hand (after intro), yacc a lot, smoke filtered
chroots in pipes, chown with forks, use the wc (unless uuclean), fseek
nice zombie processes, strip, and sleep, but not, we hope, od.  Three
days will be devoted to discussion of the ramifications of whodo.  Two
seconds have been allotted for a complete rundown of all the user-
friendly features of Unix.  Seminars include "Everything You Know is
Wrong," led by Tom Kempson, "Batman or Cat:man?" led by Richie Dennis
"cc C?  Si!  Si!" led by Kerwin Bernighan, and "Document Unix, Are You
Kidding?" led by Jan Yeats.  No Reader Service No. is necessary because
all GUGUs (Gurus of Unix Group of Users) already know everything we
could tell them."</EM>

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Networks not included</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_280.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_282.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC284" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC284">Networks which are not included</A></H2>
<P>
Networks such as MILNET (U.S. Army) have computers all around the
world. It is generally possible to assume that wherever there is
a U.S. military base, there will be a node reachable through gateways.
<P>
Private company networks such as for DEC (Digital Equipment Corp.),
or Sun Microsystems, for example, have nodes in many exotic locations.
However the connection may take place via UUCP and cost a lot of money.
Those networks have therefore not been included. In addition, those
are PRIVATE networks.
<P>
Many companies (like U.S. Sprint, for example) offer commercial
services to many countries which are not readily available on
the Internet. The service is VERY COSTLY, usually takes place via
UUCP or X.400 connections. X.400 e-mail is usually charged to
someone and if the telecommunication carrier cannot find someone
to pay for the message transfer, it will reject it. As a result,
those types of network have not been included in the list.
Although a user may RECEIVE e-mail from a user on those networks, one
may not be able to reply to it.
<P>
FIDONET nodes are NOT included. While all nodes agree to forward
e-mail as a condition to be included in the tables, the high
cost of phone calls in more exotic locations prompts some
sysadmins not to want their site publicised. Many FIDO nodes
exist throughout the Middle-East and Africa.

<H2><A NAME="SEC288" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC288">UK and GB domains</A></H2>
<P>
There are two codes for United Kingdom, namely UK and GB. While
UK is used for addressing of most domains in DNS format, the field
GB is used mainly in the X.400 addressing of United Kingdom sites.
However, there is an increasing trend in some United Kingdom sites
being directly connected to Internet under the GB domain. The GB domain
is hence a perfectly suitable Internet top level domain.
