<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>Our primary focus is what we have come to call "Breakthrough Communications", or communication that effectively breaks through the natural barriers and screens that have become a necessary human adaptation to our message-saturated culture. We accomplish this through a combination of two disciplines: One, a deep appreciation for the individual, their felt-needs and interests, their unique problems and situation, and their dreams and aspirations; second, through the creation of sensitive and artistic communication, marketing tools, and programs. Many of the communication programs we have created are licensed exclusively to local churches and schools. This is done for two reasons: One, since research-based, professionally prepared media campaigns are often cost-prohibitive to local churches and schools, we control cost by offering them to many local protected markets. The resulting prices are generally 10-20% of what it normally would cost to prepare equally professional media materials. Two, since we want churches to be able to build a unique image around specific themes, we offer the programs on an exclusive license-protected basis (one and three years with low-cost renewals).</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>The Spiritual Wrestling Federation (SWF) has been organized to help evangelize the unchurched through the medium of wrestling. Christian professional wrestlers such as Jake 'The Snake' Roberts, 'Superstar' Billy Graham, 'The Million Dollar Man' Ted DiBiase, 'Wildman' Mark Mero &amp; Sable and other professional wrestlers who profess faith in Jesus Christ belong to the SWF and individually and collectively partici- pate in speaking at churches, schools and for other sponsors who would like to see spiritual seekers come to have a personal faith in Jesus Christ. An illustrated sermon called 'The Empty Ring' is a very effective evangelistic tool to help atttract people to come out to see a professional wrestling match and hear the Gospel at the same time. The goal of the SWF is to reach as many people as possible who do not yet have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ with the Gospel and to help get them into local churches and participate in regular Bible study throughout the world.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>WebSlide provides churches with song slides, announcement, drama, and sermon slides. We use the finest materials available. We will beat any price for song slides (although we've yet to see anyone with lower prices). Be careful of those companies which offer slides for $1 each. You have to order sets or minimums, you can't get exactly what you need. Many times those companies use sub-standard materials, or their quality is poor. Our slides are reversal (Kodalith is used) which means very bright, clear text and graphics on opaque backgrounds (they can also be colorized). We use the best multi-media grade mounts available. We guarantee our slides forever. So, what do ours cost? $1.25. No minimums, no maximums, no catch. How long do they take? Orders are processed Wednesday and mailed Thursday priority mail. See our web site for details.</FONT>

They are the essentials, the things we must master before we can become proficient in any particular field. But the basics are also the things to which we must return when we lose our bearings. They are the bedrock, apart from which we have no hope of standing. As new believers, we learn the basic principles: the love of God, the destructiveness of sin, salvation by faith, the authority of the Word, the sufficiency of grace. We begin to practice the basic exercises: confession, prayer, study, service. As we mature, we come to realize that proficiency, skill in living the Christian Life, is not a matter of moving beyond the basics, but is a matter of delving more deeply into them.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>The Bible Browser is a simple but powerful tool for exploring the Bible in ways that just aren't possible with traditional printed texts. With the Bible Browser you can look up Bible passages by book chapter:verse reference. You can also retrieve passages by keyword, substring, or regular expression. You can even do fancy things like perform logical ANDs, ORs, and NOTs on groups of passages (and when you do this, results still come back in just a few seconds!). The Bible Browser does not cater to any particular theological point of view. All are welcome!</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>A WORD FROM OUR PRESIDENT... Beginning in 1986 I was one of the first missionary speakers to travel extensively with a video projector. For two years I ministered around the U.S. in conferences showing missionary videos on a large screen. I soon found that the impact of video presentations on my audiences was dynamic and incredibly powerful. This remarkable multimedia equipment was sought after by many of the religious organizations I visited. I foresaw then that this technology was going to become extremely beneficial for ministries everywhere. Knowing that churches would need a company that understood their unique needs, I helped start Fowler Productions with Dr. Ron English. Ron, our Vice-President, also comes from an extensive ministry background. Our company has since become the largest dealer of video projectors in the world for the religious market. Researching which types of video projection equipment will best serve churches is a top priority for us. Over the last ten years video projector prices have become increasingly more affordable while the image quality, brightness and features continue to rise. Our company is dedicated to serving churches and missionary organizations worldwide. Out of our continuing commitment to be "The Company that Gives You More" we have achieved many industry firsts.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>God's Love In Action (Sammy Tippit Ministries) is emerging at the close of the 20th century as one of the world's leading international revival and evangelistic ministries. God's Love In Action is committed to bringing the message of revival to the church and the gospel to the world utilizing four strategies: God's Love In Action conducts mass evangelistic meetings around the world. Sammy Tippit has preached on every continent and has seen thousands respond publicly to repent and follow Christ. Sammy has mobilized the Christian community in Prayer and Spiritual Awakening conferences around the world. He then mobilizes the Christian community in the ministry of mass evangelism. This has been so effective in Brazil that the Brazilian Baptist Convention has asked God's Love In Action to go to every state capital in Brazil with spiritual awakening conferences and evangelistic crusades by the year 2000. God's Love In Action is committed to the follow-up of new believers. Counselors are trained and classes scheduled for those who come to Christ. In many cities where Sammy has completed crusades, new churches have sprung up as a result of the meetings. Bible college students have stayed for one year following Siberian crusades where previously there was only a handful of believers. Sammy has pioneered evangelistic crusades in Romania, Mongolia, and several un-reached cities in Siberia. He conducted the first ever organized evangelistic outdoor crusades in Romania and Mongolia. He has preached the first ever stadium crusades in over 20 cities in Eastern Europe and Asia.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>Our primary focus is what we have come to call "Breakthrough Communications", or communication that effectively breaks through the natural barriers and screens that have become a necessary human adaptation to our message-saturated culture. We accomplish this through a combination of two disciplines: One, a deep appreciation for the individual, their felt-needs and interests, their unique problems and situation, and their dreams and aspirations; second, through the creation of sensitive and artistic communication, marketing tools, and programs. Many of the communication programs we have created are licensed exclusively to local churches and schools. This is done for two reasons: One, since research-based, professionally prepared media campaigns are often cost-prohibitive to local churches and schools, we control cost by offering them to many local protected markets. The resulting prices are generally 10-20% of what it normally would cost to prepare equally professional media materials. Two, since we want churches to be able to build a unique image around specific themes, we offer the programs on an exclusive license-protected basis (one and three years with low-cost renewals).</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>Lay Renewal Miseries began in 1954 when founder Bob Fenn and a group of laymen in Dallas, Texas, organized a conference to study the role of the laity. The success of this conference spawned requests for similar events in surrounding communities and churches. The work grew over the next twenty-five years until Bob sensed God's call to sell his clothing business and devote his entire life to local church renewal. In 1984 the work was organized as Lay Renewal Ministries, Inc. in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1985 LRM acquired the Institute of Church Renewal started by Dr. Ben Johnson, thus expanding its program resources and network of lay coordinators and team members throughout the country. In 1988, LRM opened its Christian Resource Center where it provides resources and services to individuals, pastors, and churches. SCOPE: Motivational events, equipping workshops, consulting and resources are provided to several hundred churches in over 30 denominations and nondenominational yearly. These churches are located in every state and several foreign countries. With over 100 lay coordinators, consultants and retreat leaders and over 6,000 lay team members and resource representatives, Lay Renewal Ministries is able to serve churches of every size, denominational affiliation and location at an extremely low cost.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>Our primary focus is what we have come to call "Breakthrough Communications", or communication that effectively breaks through the natural barriers and screens that have become a necessary human adaptation to our message-saturated culture. We accomplish this through a combination of two disciplines: One, a deep appreciation for the individual, their felt-needs and interests, their unique problems and situation, and their dreams and aspirations; second, through the creation of sensitive and artistic communication, marketing tools, and programs. Many of the communication programs we have created are licensed exclusively to local churches and schools. This is done for two reasons: One, since research-based, professionally prepared media campaigns are often cost-prohibitive to local churches and schools, we control cost by offering them to many local protected markets. The resulting prices are generally 10-20% of what it normally would cost to prepare equally professional media materials. Two, since we want churches to be able to build a unique image around specific themes, we offer the programs on an exclusive license-protected basis (one and three years with low-cost renewals).</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>A WORD FROM OUR PRESIDENT... Beginning in 1986 I was one of the first missionary speakers to travel extensively with a video projector. For two years I ministered around the U.S. in conferences showing missionary videos on a large screen. I soon found that the impact of video presentations on my audiences was dynamic and incredibly powerful. This remarkable multimedia equipment was sought after by many of the religious organizations I visited. I foresaw then that this technology was going to become extremely beneficial for ministries everywhere. Knowing that churches would need a company that understood their unique needs, I helped start Fowler Productions with Dr. Ron English. Ron, our Vice-President, also comes from an extensive ministry background. Our company has since become the largest dealer of video projectors in the world for the religious market. Researching which types of video projection equipment will best serve churches is a top priority for us. Over the last ten years video projector prices have become increasingly more affordable while the image quality, brightness and features continue to rise. Our company is dedicated to serving churches and missionary organizations worldwide. Out of our continuing commitment to be "The Company that Gives You More" we have achieved many industry firsts.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>WebSlide provides churches with song slides, announcement, drama, and sermon slides. We use the finest materials available. We will beat any price for song slides (although we've yet to see anyone with lower prices). Be careful of those companies which offer slides for $1 each. You have to order sets or minimums, you can't get exactly what you need. Many times those companies use sub-standard materials, or their quality is poor. Our slides are reversal (Kodalith is used) which means very bright, clear text and graphics on opaque backgrounds (they can also be colorized). We use the best multi-media grade mounts available. We guarantee our slides forever. So, what do ours cost? $1.25. No minimums, no maximums, no catch. How long do they take? Orders are processed Wednesday and mailed Thursday priority mail. See our web site for details.</FONT>

We believe that the best case scenario for education is in a classroom with a qualified and God called instructor however, many Christians are not physically able to attend seminary classes. Foreign mission or military assignments, rural locations, physical disabilities, and many other circumstances make it necessary to wait years to enter an academic institution. We are here to fill that gap.</FONT>

Another moving time of worship is on Saturday night when hundreds of people carrying beautiful praise banners surround the crowd as everyone joins in praising the Lord through song. Since 1979, the Creation Festival has grown to become the largest event of it's type in the world. This growth has beeen not just in the attendance of Creation, but also in the quality of the entire production. The most important changes by far are those that happen in our lives each year at Creation. No matter how bad things are going at home, the time spent at Creation brings spiritual refreshment and insight.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>Lay Renewal Miseries began in 1954 when founder Bob Fenn and a group of laymen in Dallas, Texas, organized a conference to study the role of the laity. The success of this conference spawned requests for similar events in surrounding communities and churches. The work grew over the next twenty-five years until Bob sensed God's call to sell his clothing business and devote his entire life to local church renewal. In 1984 the work was organized as Lay Renewal Ministries, Inc. in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1985 LRM acquired the Institute of Church Renewal started by Dr. Ben Johnson, thus expanding its program resources and network of lay coordinators and team members throughout the country. In 1988, LRM opened its Christian Resource Center where it provides resources and services to individuals, pastors, and churches. SCOPE: Motivational events, equipping workshops, consulting and resources are provided to several hundred churches in over 30 denominations and nondenominational yearly. These churches are located in every state and several foreign countries. With over 100 lay coordinators, consultants and retreat leaders and over 6,000 lay team members and resource representatives, Lay Renewal Ministries is able to serve churches of every size, denominational affiliation and location at an extremely low cost.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>Monthly newsletter and on-line resources which help to expose deception in Christian denominations. As we "contend for the faith," we should ever strive to do so without being meanspirited or unkind. We must "speak the truth in love." However, if we are "earnestly contending" it would be unrealistic not to expect at times to be misunderstood or even ridiculed. Love, indeed, means loving people enough to tell them the truth and to warn them of those who in the name of love pervert the truth. Accordingly, our compassion is mainly directed to the uninformed multitudes and young Christians who need to be protected from deceivers and dangerous leaders. Jesus had compassion on the multitudes, but publicly rebuked erroneous leaders.</FONT>

In the exploration of each theme, short, crisp features present a wide variety of engrossing material, illuminating the theme from different perspectives. There are apt quotations from the Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament, theologians, biblical scholars, saints and mystics, politicians, poets, writers, artists, scientists, doctors, psychologists, and historians. For background references, books, old and new, are summarized. Relevant passages are excerpted for your use. Everything in The Living Pulpit is written in clear, accessible language. We know how valuable your time is, so all our articles are short and to the point. Yet each issue is full of useful, interesting, stimulating material.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>Christ In The City Column... "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come." (Matthew 24:14. NIV) For a long time, a major stumbling block that hindered my salvation was that I felt the gospel did not pertain to me. I am a young African-American female from inner-city Detroit, and most of what I learned from history and saw in the present from the church turned me off. It was only by the grace of God that I came into salvation... and began to understand that "in Christ there is no east or west". Now, with a heart for evangelism, apologetics, and prayer, I, a student at Florida A&amp;M University, offer this service to the world-wide web. Each month, we will explore a different topic (the Nation of Islam, hip-hop music and culture, New Age) and find out why Christianity is a far better choice.

Available only to IUGM members, this training program equips trainees by giving them a practical overview of the various administrative and ministry functions of a modern rescue mission. The curriculum of the LTP consists of a series of college-level courses that combine self-study (books, tapes, and other learning materials) with "hands on" experience in the actual operations of an IUGM member mission.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>International Outreach (IO) was founded by Stuart Gramenz of Australia to reach India with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Stuart was involved in holding large evangelistic crusades, "Jesus Heals Campaigns", to achieve this. The immediate results were very encouraging, with thousands upon thousands responding to the Gospel, but this gave rise to a new challenge - FOLLOW UP, the answer being to train the nationals to reach their nation. Stuart met P. D. Prasada Rao at a crusade in Hyderabad and discovered they both had a vision to train the nationals of India. This resulted in the establishment of the Ministry Training College in 1983.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>Loginet is a network that mobilises Christians and Christian businessmen to use their God-given talents and skills to support missionaries f all Christian denominations in the field. We believe that every Christian has a built-in desire to be involved missions, and we want to make it possible for normal Christians to experience the challenge and joy of evangelism. Currently active in Mozambique and South Africa we maintain an extensive database of Christians from all walks of life who want to be involved in missions. Some are businessmen who offer vehicles, food, goods or equipment at cost to missionaries others are housewives sending clothes and food to war orphans in Mozambique and some are ordinary people offering their homes as an overnight stop for missionaries on the road. Some offer the use of aircraft or vehicles and radio equipment and other communication networks. We work closely with many organisations in the region to try and connect the needs that exist to the Christians that can meet those needs. Missionaries who are helped are blessed, but so are those who extend the blessing.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>A program is under way to serve the public through educational efforts concerning a First Amendment and religious freedom issue. This is to bring a state certified Bible course (elective) into the public high schools of the United States. There is already a precedent for this as this course is being taught in eight cities in North Carolina and numerous other cities across the country. The curriculum for the program shows a concern to convey the content of the Bible as compared to literature and history. The program is primarily concerned with education rather than indoctrination of students. The central approach of the class is simply to study the Bible as a foundation document of society, and that approach is altogether appropriate in a comprehensive program of secular education.</FONT>

A highlight of the festival for many people is the Friday night candle lighting service. Picture a hillside shimmering with the light of 50,000 candles as voices unite in worship and praise. Another moving time of worship is on Saturday night when hundreds of people carrying beautiful praise banners surround the crowd as everyone joins in praising the Lord through song. Since 1979, the Creation Festival has grown to become the largest event of it's type in the world. This growth has beeen not just in the attendance of Creation, but also in the quality of the entire production. The most important changes by far are those that happen in our lives each year at Creation. No matter how bad things are going at home, the time spent at Creation brings spiritual refreshment and insight.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>At age 15, Amy Grant wrote her first song Brand New Start. Shortly afterwards, she recorded her first album Amy Grant (released in 1978). It was an instant success and she became the teenage sensation in Contemporary Christian Music (CCM). Soon she went on to be the most popular CCM singer in the 80s, winning 5 Grammy and numerous Dove Awards. Her first hit album Age to Age (1982) is CCM's all time best album. </FONT>

Teens and adults enjoy this unit, as the Led Zeppelin sound is similar to current alternative grunge music and many parents grew up in the '70's listening to it. Due to the group's rock-n-roll ambience and evangelical focus, many non-Christians interested in New Jerusalem. Loud band, though - make sure rock is what you want - rock for the Rock of Ages!

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>Vigilantes of Love is, for lack of a better term, a folk-rock band.

Mallonee writes songs with historical references, complex characters, and themes of faith and desperation that span all of VOL's music. And live, the band is likely both to create an intimate, honest setting for these lyrics and to heat the place up a little. </FONT>

Late church goers scurry to their seats looking down to begin the same process. Visitors scan the room, pondering the need to look down and shuffle through paper. The music begins. Now picture this: In a church across town the music also begins . . . and a slide with the words to "Majesty" pops onto a screen. Heads, hearts, and voices are lifted high as people in their seats . . . and those still walking down the isle, worship His majesty. Visitors scan the room and join in as participants and think to themselves, "I like this. I can fit right in."</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>WholeHearted Worship was founded in 1992 to provide quality, anointed worship music for use in small group settings. It is a fact that the average church in America has less than 100 people. Even in the large churches, people gravitate toward smaller sub-groups for sharing and support. In most of these situations, and certainly in our families, the desire for meaningful praise and worship usually exceeds available talent to lead in worship. So, our desire and commitment is to record great songs that are familiar to the worship community. We started out to see how such a product would be received. We now hear reports from all over the world how Praise and Worship for Small Groups is a blessing. For that we are grateful.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>This study is a discussion of the substance of worship and its relationship to music, the gospel and the church. 'Worship Today' was originally written as the basis of the Discussion Group questions for SMURF (Song Music UnReal Fun) Camp '96, and hence most of it follows a question and answer format, while the remainder has been added for completeness. These are issues that I have had to face and check regularly in my life. I hope that by sharing my journey of discovery that you may have a fuller experience of worship.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>In addition to a great music and teaching line-up, there will again be many special features that are unique to a Creation festival. A highlight of the festival for many people is the Friday night candle lighting service. Picture a hillside shimmering with the light of 50,000 candles as voices unite in worship and praise. Another moving time of worship is on Saturday night when hundreds of people carrying beautiful praise banners surround the crowd as everyone joins in praising the Lord through song. Since 1979, the Creation Festival has grown to become the largest event of it's type in the world. This growth has beeen not just in the attendance of Creation, but also in the quality of the entire production. The most important changes by far are those that happen in our lives each year at Creation. No matter how bad things are going at home, the time spent at Creation brings spiritual refreshment and insight.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>The fundamental principles which underlie any course of study are called simply "the basics." The basics are the ABC's, the nuts and bolts. They are the essentials, the things we must master before we can become proficient in any particular field. But the basics are also the things to which we must return when we lose our bearings. They are the bedrock, apart from which we have no hope of standing. As new believers, we learn the basic principles: the love of God, the destructiveness of sin, salvation by faith, the authority of the Word, the sufficiency of grace. We begin to practice the basic exercises: confession, prayer, study, service. As we mature, we come to realize that proficiency, skill in living the Christian Life, is not a matter of moving beyond the basics, but is a matter of delving more deeply into them.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>Many Evangelicals today would affirm Bishop Butler's stern rebuke to John Wesley: "Sir the pretending to extraordinary revelations and gifts of the Holy Ghost is a horrid thing, a very horrid thing." (Cited by Ronald A. Knox, Enthusiasm [Oxford: The University Press, 1950], 450). What is the reason for such a revulsion to contemporary charismatic experience? Simply because, in the long evolution of Christian theology, miracles have come to signify the additional revelation of qualitatively new Christian doctrine, principally, in Scripture. To claim a revelation or a miracle represents an attempt, essentially, to add new content to the Bible. The modem conflict over the cessation of miraculous gifts has antecedents as old as the fairly sophisticated arguments of early rabbinic Judaism. But the cessationist doctrine found its classic expression in post-reformation era Calvinism.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>The fundamental principles which underlie any course of study are called simply "the basics." The basics are the ABC's, the nuts and bolts. They are the essentials, the things we must master before we can become proficient in any particular field. But the basics are also the things to which we must return when we lose our bearings. They are the bedrock, apart from which we have no hope of standing. As new believers, we learn the basic principles: the love of God, the destructiveness of sin, salvation by faith, the authority of the Word, the sufficiency of grace. We begin to practice the basic exercises: confession, prayer, study, service. As we mature, we come to realize that proficiency, skill in living the Christian Life, is not a matter of moving beyond the basics, but is a matter of delving more deeply into them.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>Many Evangelicals today would affirm Bishop Butler's stern rebuke to John Wesley: "Sir the pretending to extraordinary revelations and gifts of the Holy Ghost is a horrid thing, a very horrid thing." (Cited by Ronald A. Knox, Enthusiasm [Oxford: The University Press, 1950], 450). What is the reason for such a revulsion to contemporary charismatic experience? Simply because, in the long evolution of Christian theology, miracles have come to signify the additional revelation of qualitatively new Christian doctrine, principally, in Scripture. To claim a revelation or a miracle represents an attempt, essentially, to add new content to the Bible. The modem conflict over the cessation of miraculous gifts has antecedents as old as the fairly sophisticated arguments of early rabbinic Judaism. But the cessationist doctrine found its classic expression in post-reformation era Calvinism.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>A WORD FROM OUR PRESIDENT... Beginning in 1986 I was one of the first missionary speakers to travel extensively with a video projector. For two years I ministered around the U.S. in conferences showing missionary videos on a large screen. I soon found that the impact of video presentations on my audiences was dynamic and incredibly powerful. This remarkable multimedia equipment was sought after by many of the religious organizations I visited. I foresaw then that this technology was going to become extremely beneficial for ministries everywhere. Knowing that churches would need a company that understood their unique needs, I helped start Fowler Productions with Dr. Ron English. Ron, our Vice-President, also comes from an extensive ministry background. Our company has since become the largest dealer of video projectors in the world for the religious market. Researching which types of video projection equipment will best serve churches is a top priority for us. Over the last ten years video projector prices have become increasingly more affordable while the image quality, brightness and features continue to rise. Our company is dedicated to serving churches and missionary organizations worldwide. Out of our continuing commitment to be "The Company that Gives You More" we have achieved many industry firsts.</FONT>

They live here because they like the lifestyle of Tangier and have no desire to live on the mainland. Tangier has three Bed &amp; Breakfasts, five gift shops, two grocery stores, three restraunts, and three sandwitch shops, and it's just wonderful to get on one of the little bugies and take a tour of the Island.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>A WORD FROM OUR PRESIDENT... Beginning in 1986 I was one of the first missionary speakers to travel extensively with a video projector. For two years I ministered around the U.S. in conferences showing missionary videos on a large screen. I soon found that the impact of video presentations on my audiences was dynamic and incredibly powerful. This remarkable multimedia equipment was sought after by many of the religious organizations I visited. I foresaw then that this technology was going to become extremely beneficial for ministries everywhere. Knowing that churches would need a company that understood their unique needs, I helped start Fowler Productions with Dr. Ron English. Ron, our Vice-President, also comes from an extensive ministry background. Our company has since become the largest dealer of video projectors in the world for the religious market. Researching which types of video projection equipment will best serve churches is a top priority for us. Over the last ten years video projector prices have become increasingly more affordable while the image quality, brightness and features continue to rise. Our company is dedicated to serving churches and missionary organizations worldwide. Out of our continuing commitment to be "The Company that Gives You More" we have achieved many industry firsts.</FONT>

Late church goers scurry to their seats looking down to begin the same process. Visitors scan the room, pondering the need to look down and shuffle through paper. The music begins. Now picture this: In a church across town the music also begins . . . and a slide with the words to "Majesty" pops onto a screen. Heads, hearts, and voices are lifted high as people in their seats . . . and those still walking down the isle, worship His majesty. Visitors scan the room and join in as participants and think to themselves, "I like this. I can fit right in."</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>Lay Renewal Miseries began in 1954 when founder Bob Fenn and a group of laymen in Dallas, Texas, organized a conference to study the role of the laity. The success of this conference spawned requests for similar events in surrounding communities and churches. The work grew over the next twenty-five years until Bob sensed God's call to sell his clothing business and devote his entire life to local church renewal. In 1984 the work was organized as Lay Renewal Ministries, Inc. in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1985 LRM acquired the Institute of Church Renewal started by Dr. Ben Johnson, thus expanding its program resources and network of lay coordinators and team members throughout the country. In 1988, LRM opened its Christian Resource Center where it provides resources and services to individuals, pastors, and churches. SCOPE: Motivational events, equipping workshops, consulting and resources are provided to several hundred churches in over 30 denominations and nondenominational yearly. These churches are located in every state and several foreign countries. With over 100 lay coordinators, consultants and retreat leaders and over 6,000 lay team members and resource representatives, Lay Renewal Ministries is able to serve churches of every size, denominational affiliation and location at an extremely low cost.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>A WORD FROM OUR PRESIDENT... Beginning in 1986 I was one of the first missionary speakers to travel extensively with a video projector. For two years I ministered around the U.S. in conferences showing missionary videos on a large screen. I soon found that the impact of video presentations on my audiences was dynamic and incredibly powerful. This remarkable multimedia equipment was sought after by many of the religious organizations I visited. I foresaw then that this technology was going to become extremely beneficial for ministries everywhere. Knowing that churches would need a company that understood their unique needs, I helped start Fowler Productions with Dr. Ron English. Ron, our Vice-President, also comes from an extensive ministry background. Our company has since become the largest dealer of video projectors in the world for the religious market. Researching which types of video projection equipment will best serve churches is a top priority for us. Over the last ten years video projector prices have become increasingly more affordable while the image quality, brightness and features continue to rise. Our company is dedicated to serving churches and missionary organizations worldwide. Out of our continuing commitment to be "The Company that Gives You More" we have achieved many industry firsts.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>WebSlide provides churches with song slides, announcement, drama, and sermon slides. We use the finest materials available. We will beat any price for song slides (although we've yet to see anyone with lower prices). Be careful of those companies which offer slides for $1 each. You have to order sets or minimums, you can't get exactly what you need. Many times those companies use sub-standard materials, or their quality is poor. Our slides are reversal (Kodalith is used) which means very bright, clear text and graphics on opaque backgrounds (they can also be colorized). We use the best multi-media grade mounts available. We guarantee our slides forever. So, what do ours cost? $1.25. No minimums, no maximums, no catch. How long do they take? Orders are processed Wednesday and mailed Thursday priority mail. See our web site for details.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>WholeHearted Worship was founded in 1992 to provide quality, anointed worship music for use in small group settings. It is a fact that the average church in America has less than 100 people. Even in the large churches, people gravitate toward smaller sub-groups for sharing and support. In most of these situations, and certainly in our families, the desire for meaningful praise and worship usually exceeds available talent to lead in worship. So, our desire and commitment is to record great songs that are familiar to the worship community. We started out to see how such a product would be received. We now hear reports from all over the world how Praise and Worship for Small Groups is a blessing. For that we are grateful.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>White Harvest is an inter-agency funding service for missionaries and Christian workers involved in the white, (ripe) harvest fields of the world. White Harvest is dedicated to releasing as many workers into the Harvest as possible, by providing them with fair wages and freeing them from support raising. Priority is given to the following workers: 1. Those who must raise their own support. 2. Those working with unreached and least evangelized peoples. White Harvest Fund (WHF) is built by donations from businesses, churches, foundations, and individuals committed to the completion of the Great Commission of Jesus Christ. WHF does not employ or supervise missionaries. Our goal is that each worker we sponsor will be fairly compensated at 100% of budget.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>Rockford Master's Commission is an INTENSE 9 month discipleship program designed to cultivate a radical new generation of Christian leaders and ministers. This program focuses on the person of Jesus Christ first, and then on interpersonal relationships, as well as cutting edge ministry training at the Rockford training center (also the location of Jeanne Mayo's 1,000 member youth ministry). THe students come and experience Jesus face to face and they are never the same again! We believe that this world needs a Radical new breed of ministers who truly know Jesus and also know how to effectively communicate to Generation X!!</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>The Church of Christ in Farmerville, Louisiana is a group of Christians dedicated to simple, New Testament Christianity. We believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God, and completely sufficient for salvation, worship and daily living. We believe we are saved by the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, and that we are promised life, both now and forever because of his resurrection from the dead. We believe salvation is by the grace of God, and is appropriated by faith in obedience to the gospel of Christ. Further, we believe it is our privilege to teach others the good news of Jesus Christ whether it be in our own community or around the world. We invite all who visit our web site to use these resources for their own spiritual development, and to help others. We welcome comments and questions sent to our email address. We will do our best to help all who are truly seeking to find God's will for their lives. </FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>The mission of the Church of the Nazarene is to respond to the Great Commission of Christ to "go and make disciples of all nations." Our key objective is to advance God's Kingdom by the preservation and propagation of Christian Holiness as set forth in the Scriptures. Organized October 8, 1908, in Pilot Point, Texas, the Church of the Nazarene has made its headquarters home in Kansas City, Mo., since 1919. The headquarters complex is located at 6401 The Paseo at the intersection of 63rd Street and The Paseo. The Nazarene Publishing House is located at 2923 Troost Avenue about five miles north of denominational headquarters. Nazarene Headquarters provides support services to almost 1.2 million members worshiping in more than 11,480 churches in the United States, Canada, and 111 other world areas. This includes maintaining ministerial credentials and church records, coordinating the support and sending of missionaries, developing Sunday school and discipleship curriculum, providing retirement support programs for pastors, encouraging the planting of new churches, developing radio programs for outreach to all parts of the globe, and much more. Founded in 1911, the Nazarene Publishing House is the largest publisher of Wesleyan-Holiness literature in the world. Products include Sunday school curriculum, music, drama resources, periodicals, and books. In addition, many kinds of merchandise items are carried for the convenience of local churches in fulfilling their mission. NPH prints more than 600,000 books annually, in addition to a wide variety of periodicals and other publications. Nazarenes support ten liberal arts institutions in the United States, Canada, and the British Isles, as well as four seminaries and 35 Bible colleges. The church operates three hospitals, 35 medical clinics, three nurses training colleges, one teacher training college, and more than 370 primary and secondary schools outside the United States and Canada. The Church of the Nazarene holds denominational membership in both the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) and the Christian Holiness Association (CHA).</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>We at Countryside Church of the Nazarene believe that the message of Jesus Christ must reach everyone and cannot be accomplished through social or culturally bound churches. Our mission is to reach the people through Christ's teachings of love and holiness. Christ first loved the sinner and then expressed the need for holiness. Because of God's love for us He allowed His Son to be the door to enter the kingdom of heaven and when we choose Jesus Christ we find the door that leads there. In Choosing Jesus Christ as our Savior, we are choosing a path of holiness. The holiness is seen as we continually learn and grow closer to Christ. We extend an unjudgemental hand in true Christian friendship with a bias towards love and holiness. </FONT>

The entire Bible is primarily about the Israelite people and the promises made to them through our Father's original Covenant with Abraham; through which the entire world has subsequently been blessed which is a prophetic fulfillment of our Father's Word. We also delve into a deeper study of Bible prophecy as it relates to the End Times. Our resources include many Bibles (KJV in particular), Hebrew/Greek Dictionaries (Strong's Exhaustive Concordance/Dictionary in particular); Lexicons; secular dictionaries; encyclopedias; ancient maps; charts; world history and many other resources.
