<h3>What is HTML Assistant?</h3>
HTML Assistant is a hypertext editor for creating and editing documents used on the World Wide Web. 
<P>
It permits you to validate and test your work with the browsers of your choice without leaving the editor.
<P>
In addition to its editing facilities, HTML Assistant incorporates features which can help you to organize 
and keep track of the Internet resources that you use.
<P>
It runs under MS Windows so you need to have Windows on your system in order to use it. 
<p>
The HTML documents created with HTML Assistant can be displayed on any computer for which browser 
software exists including IBM PC compatibles, Apple Macintosh, UNIX and simple terminal based 
systems.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
How can I get a copy of HTML Assistant?</h3>

HTML Assistant is available via anonymous FTP as freeware. The author holds the copyright, but the 
software may be freely used and distributed.  Distribution must include all the files in the program file set 
(htmlasst.zip).
<p>
The current release is version 1.4.
<p>
You can download it directly in several ways<P>
<OL>
<LI><a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/inst14.exe"> As a self-installing archive (500K).</a> "inst14.exe".<P>

<STRONG> Recommended: </STRONG> This is the longest file, but the easiest to install. It contains <B>ALL</B> the files you need, <B>INCLUDING VBRUN300.DLL</B>. It will guide you through the installation process, can make backups of any system files it replaces, and will permit you to easily uninstall the program.<P>

 After you receive the file, to begin the guided installation of <I>HTML Assistant</I>, simply execute the INST14.EXE file -- either by double clicking on its name in File Manager, or by using the "RUN" option in Program Manager's "FILE" menu. <P>

[<B>NOTE:</B> If you already have VBRUN300.DLL, you can <a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/part14.exe">download "part14.exe" (270K)</a> -
 it lacks VBRUN300.DLL, but is otherwise equivalent to INST14.EXE]<P>

<LI><a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/htmlasst.zip">As a compressed (.zip)  file (206K).</a>"htmlasst.zip".<P>

<LI><a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/htmlazip.exe">As a self-extracting archive (222K</a>"htmlazip.exe".
</OL>
<B>Important:</B> With options 2 or 3, if you don't already have it, you will also need the file &QUOT;vbrun300.dll&QUOT;.  You can download it by clicking <a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/vbrun300.zip">here</a> as &QUOT;vbrun300.zip&QUOT; -- length is about 230K 
bytes.  If you want a self-extracting archive, you can download &QUOT;vbrunzip.exe&QUOT; (about 245K), by clicking <a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/vbrunzip.exe">here</a>.<P>

If you prefer to use FTP software, the FTP site for HTML Assistant is:  ftp.cs.dal.ca 
<p>
The directory containing the files is /htmlasst/
<p>
Always check the short &QUOT;readme.1st&QUOT; file to see what files you need.

<p>
<hr>
<h3>Why is it called HTML Assistant? </h3>

World Wide Web browsers (Netscape, Cello and Mosaic are examples of browsers that work with MS Windows) use 
hypertext to access and display information available on the World Wide Web. Hypertext is text that 
incorporates pointers to additional information.  Microsoft Windows "Help" files are examples of 
hypertext documents.
<p>

The hypertext documents used by World Wide Web browsers are ordinary text files that include special 
markings that tell the browser software something about how the text should appear to the user, as well as 
how to retrieve information when the user requests it.
<p>

The language, or code, used for these special markings is Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
<p>

While HTML markings could be added to any text file using a simple editor like "Notepad" which comes 
with MS Windows, the process is tedious and time consuming.  Also, it is difficult to see how the 
documents you create will actually look when displayed by a browser.
<p>

HTML Assistant provides, along with a text editor, special tools and functions that 'assist' in the process 
of creating HTML text files by letting the computer handle most of the repetitive and time consuming 
tasks. 
<p>

HTML Assistant also permits you to validate your documents by viewing them with WWW browsers, while you are working 
on them, without leaving the editor.
<p>

HTML Assistant incorporates the following features to make the work of creating HTML text documents 
easier:

<ol>
<li>Point and click creation of HTML Hypertext markings<p>
<li>Ability to validate and test your work with the WWW browsers of your choice at the click of a button. You can quickly and easily 
view the documents you are working on to see how they will look when actually displayed by browsers. 
HTML assistant can take advantage of Cello's DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) capability so that testing 
your work with Cello is almost seamless.<p>
<li>A user defined toolbox enables you easily to include new markup text as more features are added to 
HTML.  You can also create your own markings for special editing tasks.<p>
<li>Facilities for extracting, organizing and combining URLs (pointers to information -- see below) from 
different sources. <p>
<li>A multiple document interface (more than one file may be opened at one time) so you can easily cut 
and paste between documents.<p>
<li>Context sensitive 'Help'<p>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>What are URLs?</h3>

URLs, or Uniform Resource Locators, are the pointers to information that can be accessed by browsers.  
URLs enable a single browser program to incorporate many of the functions that normally require several 
other software packages including FTP, news, Email and gopher.
<p>

For example, the URL "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/htmlasst.zip" could be used in an HTML document to 
enable a browser to retrieve the 'HTML Assistant' program files from an FTP site.<p>

Continuing with the example, the HTML text that would permit a user to retrieve the HTML Assistant 
files might look something like this:<p>

<code>&lt;a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/htmlasst.zip">Retrieve HTML Assistant program 
files&lt;/a></code>
<p>
When the HTML was displayed by a browser, the user would see only the text "Retrieve HTML Assistant 
program files".  The text would be highlighted in some way (i.e., underlined, boxed, or in a different color 
than normal text) to indicate that it was 'linked' to the URL and that the user could 'click' on it to 
download the binary file "htmlasst.zip".<p>
<hr><h3>
How does HTML Assistant make it easier to work with URLs?</h3>

HTML Assistant minimizes typing and makes it easy to systematically collect and organize URLs.<p>

URLs can be somewhat laborious to type. It requires even more typing to add the HTML code that makes 
the information pointed to by the URL accessible to a user. 
<p>
With HTML Assistant, URLs need to be typed only once and sometimes not at all.  URLs created in 
HTML Assistant can be saved to files and can be quickly retrieved for point and click insertion into any 
document.  
<p>
URLs saved by browsers such as Cello (in Bookmark files) or Mosaic (in its menus and its 'hotlist') can be 
automatically copied and converted to HTML Assistant URL files for point and click insertion into your 
own documents.
<p>
HTML Assistant makes it easy to organize information you collect.  Files of collected URLs can be 
automatically converted to HTML text with a few mouse clicks.  This enables you to quickly create your 
own browser pages of links organized by subject, date or in whatever way suits you.  You can build your 
own information system based on a hierarchy of menus kept on WWW browser pages stored on your hard 
drive or on an HTML server.
<p><hr>
<h3>Where can I find MS Windows browsers for viewing HTML files?</h3>

"Cello" is available at ftp.law.cornell.edu in the directory /pub/LII/Cello/.<p>

"Netscape" is available at ftp.mcom.com/netscape/.  If that site is busy (as it often is), try one of the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/net/infosys/Mosaic-Comm/
<LI>lark.cc.ukans.edu/Netscape/
<LI>ftp.meer.net/Netscape/
<LI>doc.ic.ac.uk/packages/Netscape/
<LI>archie.au/pub/misc/netscape/ 
</UL>

"Mosaic" is available at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in the directory /pc/mosaic/.<p>
<hr>
<h3>What is "HTML Assistant Pro"? </h3>

<a href="http://fox.nstn.ca/~harawitz/comparsn.html"><strong>See a comparison of HTML Assistant (freeware) and HTML Assistant Pro (the commercial version).</strong></a><p>

Two versions of HTML Assistant are available.  The free version, called "HTML Assistant" is described in 
this document.  It is a full working version with all the features described above.  It will continue to be 
freely available and new versions will be released from time to time.<p>

<A HREF="http://fox.nstn.ca/~harawitz/htmlpro1.html">"HTML Assistant Pro"</A> is a commercially available version of HTML Assistant. <p>

It has additional features including:<p> 

<ol>
<li>An automatic HTML page creator plus pushbutton templates for forms and tables to get you up-and-running quickly<P>
<LI>The ability to edit files of any size<P>
<li>Toolbar support for HTML 2 and HTML 3 tags including forms, tables and background designs<P>
<li>Formatting filters that make it easy to create readable documents from HTML files.<p>
<li>Timesaving file and URL search features.<p>
<li>A printed manual<p> 
<li>It is fully supported and will keep up with changes in Windows versions, HTML, browsers, etc.<p>

Hey there! Thanks for stopping by.

HTML doucuments can be written with any text editor. Use the 'source' button
 of your browser, or the 'save as' option to view the HTML source of a page you
 particularly like, and chances are you'll see its really not all that hard.
<p>
All HTML basically consists of is text, with markup 'tokens' around selected 
text to instruct your web browser to format it in a particular way. On the
 same plane, there are tags to indicate that you'd like a picture or the like
included in the document. HTML writing is fun, easy and generally intuitive.
<p>
There are several online tutorials around to help with anything from basic web
page creation to the more advanced topics of CGI programming and such. Follow
 the links I've put on this page, which are decently categorized, and remember
 that true web creation lies not in impressions, but how well you can spawn
 your own creativity into your work.
<p>
If this is your first time, or if you find that you need some inspiration, or
if you simply have some spare time, I urge you to read this 
wonderful essay by Vannevar Bush, titled <a href="http://www.isg.sfu.ca/~duchier/misc/vbush/"><strong><i>As We May Think</i></strong></a>, written in 1945. It is
quite amazing.
<p>
You may now also <a href="url-submit.html">submit a URL</a> for inclusion in the
 guide. This will be reviewed, and included within 24 hours.

Look for the <img src="new.gif"> tag for new links.

Tags are always surrounded by brackets (&lt; and&gt;). For example, the <CODE>&lt;TITLE&gt;</CODE> tag specifies the title of a document.(Note: HTML is not case sensitive, so you could also use <CODE>&lt;title&gt;</CODE>instead of <CODE>&lt;TITLE></CODE>.) You will also notice its corresponding tag,<CODE>&lt;/TITLE&gt;</CODE>, includes a slash (/) before the word TITLE. In HTML, slashesare used to note the end of a command (in this case, the end of a title).If you look through the above example, you'll see that nearly every taghas a corresponding tag which includes the slash. The only tag here thatdoes not is the paragraph tag, which appears as <CODE>&lt;P&gt;</CODE>. The <CODE>&lt;P&gt;</CODE> tag is usedto connote the end of a paragraph, so only one tag is needed. The othertags used within this document will be explained further in the tutorial.<H2>The Basic Tags</H2><h3>Title Tags (<code>&lt;TITLE&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/TITLE&gt;</code>)</h3><P>Every HTML document should have a title. Titles appear at the top andcenter of a Web browser's open screen. Your title should be somewhatdescriptive - that is, descriptive enough for other people to know what'son that page just by looking at the title. For example, <CITE>George WashingtonMiddle School Home Page</CITE> would be a lot more useful as a title than <cite>SchoolPage</cite>.<h3>Headings (<CODE>&lt;Hx&gt;</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;/Hx&gt;</CODE>)</h3><P>Headings serve as headlines for a document. It is customary for a Webpage to have a heading at the top of each page. There are six levels ofheadings, numbered 1 through 6, with 1 being the largest and the boldest.In general, the first heading in each document should be tagged <CODE>&lt;H1&gt;</CODE>. Thesyntax of the heading tag is:<P><CODE>&lt;Hx&gt;Here is My Heading&lt;/Hx&gt;</CODE><P>The x in the tags must be a number, 1 through 6. So, if you used theheading <CODE>&lt;H1&gt;</CODE>, it would appear as<hr><blockquote><H1>Here is My Heading</H1></blockquote><hr><P>If, however, you used <CODE>&lt;H3&gt;</CODE> instead, you'd get something like<hr><blockquote><H3>Here is My Heading</H3></blockquote><hr><P>In many documents, the first heading is identical to the title. Forlarger documents, subheadings such as <CODE>&lt;H3&gt;</CODE> would be used within thedocument to designate the start of a new subject. Additionally, headings,1, 2 and 3 are by far the most common, for 4, 5, and 6 can appear sosmall that they are a distraction to the reader.<H3>Paragraph Tags </H3><P>Unlike many other text documents, HTML files do not recognize carriagereturns. So, if you had an HTML document that looked like<code><P>Welcome to our School Home Page.<br>This site is under construction.</code><P>it would appear as this on a Web browser:<blockquote><P>Welcome to our School Home Page. This site is under construction.</blockquote><P>In order for the computer to recognize the end of a line in HTML, youmust include a paragaph tag, or <CODE>&lt;P&gt;</CODE>. This tag will end a paragraph foryou and add a small amount of space before the next paragaph. It is veryimportant that you use <CODE>&lt;P&lt;</CODE> tags when you wish to end a paragraph -otherwise, your document will appear as one gigantic paragraph.  It should be noted that some coders of HTML documents prefer to place the &lt;P&gt; tag before each paragraph rather than at the end.<P>So, let's try our HTML document again, this time with paragraph tags.<PRE><CODE>Welcome to our School Home Page.&lt;P&gt;This site is under construction.&lt;P&gt;</CODE></PRE><P>This time, our result appears as<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Welcome to our School Home Page.<P>This site is under construction.</BLOCKQUOTE><h3>Line Break Tags &lt;br&gt;</h3><P>In many cases, you'll want to end a line of some text, but you won't wantto leave the amount of space below it that the paragraph tag leaves. Inthese situations, you can use the line break tag, or &lt;br&gt;. Here's ourexample:<P><code>Welcome to our School Home Page. &lt;br&gt; This site is under construction.&lt;p&gt;</code><P>We've inserted a line break tag in the middle of the document. What wenow get is this:<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Welcome to our School Home Page.<br>This site is under construction.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>If you compare this to the above example which used the paragraph tag,you'll see that our line break tag does not leave the same amount ofspace.<h3>Stylized Text Formatting</h3><P>HTML allows you to present text in certain styles to add depth andmeaning to the presentation. Words can be italicized and bolded, forexample. In HTML, text format tags fall into two catagories, logical andphysical. Logical tags focus on the actual use of the formatting, such asciting a source or emphasizing a point. Physical tags, on the other hand,are more literal, and they tell the computer to recognize the text asspecifically underlined, bold, or some other different style. As ageneral rule, most Web designers try to use <em>logical</em> tags more thanphysical tags, for as Web software becomes more advanced, they'll be ableto give more utility to a tag that isn't as specific as one which onlyknows how to make text into italics or whatnot. But that's not to saythere's anything wrong with physical tags - they're easier to remember thanlogical tags. All style tags are used the same way - place a starting tag(without the slash) before the desired text, and a closing tag (with theslash) at the end of the text.<P>Confused? Don't worry, it's not that important. In any case, here is alist of the common physical and logical tags.<h4>Physical Styles</h4><UL><LI>&lt;B&gt; and &lt;/B&gt; are used to <b>bolden</b> text.<LI>&lt;I&gt; and &lt;/I&gt; are used to <i>italicize</i> text.<LI>&lt;TT&gt; and &lt;/TT&gt; will give you <tt>typewriter, or fixed-width</tt>, text.</ul><h4>Logical Styles</h4><DL><DT>&lt;DFN&gt; and &lt;/DFN&gt;<DD>Used for a word being defined. Usually appears as italics. Example: <DFN>Lynxis a text-based Web browser</DFN>.<P><DT>&lt;EM&gt; and &lt;/EM&gt;<DD>Used for emphasis. Usually appears as italics. Example: <EM>If you like theRolling Stones, visit their web page at http://stones.com</EM>.<P><DT>&lt;CITE&gt; and &lt;/CITE&gt;<DD>Used for citing books, movies, etc. Usually appears as italics. Example:Howard Gardner discusses Multiple Intelligences theory in <CITE>Frames of Mind</CITE>.<P><DT>&lt;CODE&gt; and &lt;/CODE&gt;<DD>Used for presenting computer code. Appears as a fixed-width font.Example: <CODE>10 if x=y then go to 40</CODE><P><DT>&lt;KBD&gt; and &lt;/KBD&gt;<DD>Used for user keyboard entry. Usually appears as either a boldfixed-width font. Example: To get the manual on the listserv, type in <KBD>manlistproc</KBD>.<P><DT>&lt;STRONG&gt; and &lt;/STRONG&gt;<DD>Used for strong emphasis. Usually appears as bold. Example: <strong>If you haveany problems, please contact the Webmaster</strong>!<P><DT>&lt;VAR&gt; and &lt;/VAR&gt;<DD>Used to represent variables - i.e, something the user must replace withtheir own information. Usually appears as italics. Example: <var>REVIEWLISTNAME</var> will list the users subscribed to a given listserv.</DL><H3>Special Characters (Escape Sequences)</h3><P>Four characters of the ASCII character set - the left angle bracket (&lt;),the right angle bracket (&gt;), the ampersand (&) and the double quote (") -are used in HTML to represent certain aspects of markup tags. Because ofthis, they cannot be used as part of a text document without a little bitof assistance. Additionally, accent marks and other less commoncharacters can not appear without special help. Instead, you representthese characters with codes known as escape sequences, which must beincluded in the usual brackets for them to be recognized. Some of themore common codes:<UL><li><code>&amp;lt;</code>  is the escape sequence for &lt;<li><code>&amp;gt;</code>  is the escape sequence for ><li><code>&amp;amp;</code>  is the escape sequence for &<li><code>&amp;quot;</code>  is the escape sequence for "<li><code>&amp;ouml;</code>  is the escape sequence for &ouml;:  a lowercase o with an umlaut:<li><code>&amp;ntilde;</code>  is the escape sequence for &ntilde;:  a lowercase n with an tilde:<li><code>&amp;Egrave;</code>  is the escape sequence for &Egrave;:  an uppercase E with a grave accent:i</ul><P>A full list of supported characters can be found at <A HREF="http://www.w3.org">http://www.w3.org</A>.<h3>Horizontal Rules</h3><P>The &lt;HR&gt; tag produces a horizontal line the width of the browser window.<h3>Linking to Other Documents &lt;A HREF&gt;</h3><P>Perhaps the best aspect of writing in HTML is its ability to link text toother texts, which as a document is known as hypertext. HTML uses ananchor tag, or &lt;A&gt;, to link documents together. Every anchor tag includesthe following elements:<UL><li>the anchor<li>the file to which it should connect<li>the text which it will be used as the "link"<li>the closing anchor</UL><P>Sound complicated? In practice, it really isn't. Here's a typical anchor tag:<P><code>&lt;A HREF="http://k12.cnidr.org:90"&gt;The EdWeb Home Page&lt;/A&gt;</code><P>As you can see, the tag begins with an &lt;A, the basic element of everyanchor tag. After a single space, the &lt;A is followed byHREF="http://k12.cnidr.org:90"&gt;. The HREF=" section tells the computerthat this tag will link the document to another document. The next set ofinformation, http://k12.cnidr.org:90"&gt;, is the name of the document towhich it should connect, which in this case is a Web page atk12.cnidr.org:90. Addresses such as these are often called UniformResource Locators, or URL's. The "&gt; at the end of the address simplytells the computer that the address is over.<P>Next, we have some text which says <tt>The EdWeb Home Page</tt>. This is theinformation that will actually appear on the screen. The information isknown as a link, for when you select it in your Web browser by clickingit with a mouse or moving your cursor on top of it, it will connect youto the address (in this case, <code>http://k12.cnidr.org:90</code>). Finally, &lt;/A&gt; isadded at the end of the tag to tell the computer that the tag is complete.<P>While the anchor and the closing anchor in this kind of tag remainconstant, the other two pieces, the URL and the link, are adjustable.URLs can include practically any file on the internet, such as a website, a gopher, even an email address, though most commonly you will linkyour documents to web sites. Here are some major examples of differenttypes of URLs as they would appear within an anchor:<P><pre>A link to the <a href="http://stones.com">Stones Web Page</a>           &lt;A HREF="http://stones.com"&gt;A link to a file in the same folder     &lt;A HREF="homepage.html"&gt;A link to the <a href="gopher://digital.cosn.org">CoSN Gopher</a>               &lt;A HREF="gopher://digital.cosn.org"&gt;A link to a <a href="news:k12.chat.teacher">newsgroup</a>                    &lt;A HREF="news:k12.chat.teacher"&gt;A link to an <a href="telnet://capaccess.org">outside network</a>             &lt;A HREF="telnet://capaccess.org"&gt;To mail a message to <a href="mailto:acarvin@k12.cnidr.org">my email</a>            &lt;A HREF="mailto:acarvin@k12.cnidr.org"&gt;To copy the software, <a href="ftp://mcom.com/netscape">Netscape</a>           &lt;A HREF="ftp://mcom.com/netscape"&gt;</pre><P>As you can see at the beginning of each URL, the anchor includes a basiccode to designate what type of link is to be created. To transfer a file,the code is <code>ftp://</code>, and to access a gopher, it's <code>gopher://</code>. The onlyanchor which isn't as obvious is <code>http://</code>, which links you to a Web page.HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, which is the technical namefor the method of connecting to a Web page. As for the second example -the link to a file in the same folder - it's used when you are creatingmultiple documents for your Web site. If the other file is located in thesame folder directory on your computer, all you have to do is include thename of the file, which in this case is called <code>homepage.html</code>.<P>If, however, the file is located in a different folder on your computer,you'll have to specify the entire URL for the computer to follow thepath. Let's say you have a file in a folder called <code>my.home.page</code>, and youwanted to connect it to your friend Jane's home page, which happens to bein another folder called jane.folder on the same computer, which iscalled my.computer.com. You'd have to write the anchor as if you werelinking it to another computer, so your anchor might look like this:<P><code>&lt;A HREF="http://my.computer.com/jane.folder/jane.homepage.html"&gt;</code><P>When the computer looks up this link, it connects to the computer,<code>my.computer.com</code>, and then goes the folder jane.folder, which it knows todo because <code>jane.folder</code> is preceded by a slash (/) in the address (Note:slashes are used to designate the opening of a file within a folder, andbecause you may place a file within several layers of folders, the lengthof the address and the number of slashes may be quite large). Thecomputer then sees another slash right before <code>jane.homepage.html</code>, thename of Jane's Web file. The computer opens <code>jane.homepage.html</code> and thenpresents it on the screen.<P>Of course, if you want your Web users to know where a certain link goes,you'll have to provide them some information about the link. Let's lookagain at our example:<P>&lt;A HREF="http://k12.cnidr.org:90"&gt;The EdWeb Home Page&lt;/A&gt;<P>In the space between the anchor itself and the closing tag, we have thewords <code>The EdWeb Home Page</code>. That's the link. When you open a Web documentwith this example in it, this is what you'd see:<P><a href="http://k12.cnidr.org:90">The EdWeb Home Page</a><P>And that's it. The rest of the information is hidden away, but thecomputer still knows it's there. So, if you moved your mouse or cursor tothe link and selected it, the computer would look up the URL that islisted within the anchor and bring you to it.<h3>Using Anchors Within a Single Document</h3><P>Sometimes when you're desigining a Web page with lots of information, itcan be handy to make links within the document to other points in thetext. For example, if you're putting together an on-line dictionary andone of your definitions is<DL><DT>Lynx<DD>A browsing program used to access the World Wide Web.</DL><P>That's all well and good, but what if the reader has no idea what theWorld Wide Web is? You'll want to be able to connect them to thatinformation, and since our dictionary is in the form of one long file,we'll have to make a link to a definition further down within thedocument.  To do this, you need to add an anchor to the words "The WorldWide Web" in your new definition, using a new tag called &lt;A NAME&gt;:<P>&lt;A NAME="web"&gt;The World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt;<P>And within your definition for <em>Lynx</em>, you'll also have to add a link to"World Wide Web" so the computer knows to bring you to its definition. Inthis case, you would use a tag that is fairly similar to a typical anchortag:<P><code>        A browsing program used to access the &lt;A HREF="#web"&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt;.</code><P>The words <em>World Wide Web</em> are now a link to web, which you've just definedin the <A NAME> tag. The hash mark (i.e., the #) tells the computer it'slooking for a link within a document.<P>Finally, let's say you have a really, really big dictionary, and theletters T through Z are actually in a totally separate file called<em>dic.t-z.html</em>. You'd have to let the computer know that it needs to jumpto a different file as well as go down to the definition for World WideWeb. Well, you'd use the same <code>&lt;A HREF&gt;</code> tag as you did above, with one newtwist:<P><code>        A browsing program used to access the &lt;AHREF="dic.t-z.html#web"&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt;.</code><P>Preceding the hash mark we've added the name of the file, <em>dic.t-z.html</em>.Now the computer knows to go to that file first before looking for thelink.<h2>Intermediate HTML Design</h2><P>So far, we've covered the basics of HTML. With this information, youshould be able to design some simple, but very effective, web documents.In the next section, we'll cover other markups which will help you jazzup your efforts.<h3>Unnumbered Lists &lt;UL&gt;</h3><P>Very often in Web design, you'll find yourself needing to make a list ofitems. Of course, you could always add a line break tag &lt;BR&gt; or aparagraph tag &lt;P&gt; to separate each item, but often that won't look verygood. To help you out, HTML recognizes a tag that will let you createlists which include a bullet before each item. For example, if you wantedto create a list like this:<P><UL><LI> Eenie<LI> Meanie<LI> Miney<LI> Mo</UL><P>You would use the unnumbered list tag, or <code>&lt;UL&gt;</code>. Additionally, each itemin the list would include a list item tag, or <code>&lt;LI&gt;</code>. So to make our list,we'd type the following:<P><code>&lt;UL&gt;<br>&lt;LI&gt; Eenie<br>&lt;LI&gt; Meanie<br>&lt;LI&gt; Miney<br>&lt;LI&gt; Mo<br>&lt;/UL&gt;</code><P>And make sure you include the closing tag, <code>&lt;/UL&gt;</code>, or you might reallyconfuse the computer. Otherwise, these tags should give you a nicelooking bulleted list.<h3>Numbered Lists</h3><P>Sometimes instead of an unnumbered list, you'll want to list some itemsthat are numbered. Another tag, <code>&lt;OL&gt;</code> will create an ordered list thatautomatically includes the numbers. It's very similar to a <code>&lt;UL&gt;</code> list, theonly difference being in the opening and closing tags. Let's try this:<P><code>&lt;OL&gt;<br>&lt;LI&gt; Eenie<br>&lt;LI&gt; Meanie<br>&lt;LI&gt; Miney<br>&lt;LI&gt; Mo<br>&lt;/OL&gt;</code><P>When you look at this on the Web, the list appears as<P><OL><LI> Eenie<LI> Meanie<LI> Miney<LI> Mo</OL><P>Ordered list tags are really handy when you want to number your list andplan to add items to the list every now and then. This way, your listwill remain numbered and you won't have to retype the numbers each timeyou make a change.<h3>Definition Lists &lt;DL&gt;</h3><P>A definition list usually consists of a tag for the term, <code>&lt;DL&gt;</code>, and a tagfor the definition, <code>&lt;DD&gt;</code>. <code>&lt;DL&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/DL&gt;</code> tags are needed at the beginningand end of the list.<P>Let's use one of our previous examples.<P><code>    <br>&lt;DL>    <br>&lt;DT&gt;Lynx    <br>&lt;DD&gt;A browsing program used to access the World Wide Web.    <br>&lt;/DL&gt;</code><P>The output would look like:<DL><DT>Lynx<DD>A browsing program used to access the World Wide Web.</DL><P>Of course, most definition lists would include more than one item, as inthe above example, but the rules remain the same - precede each term witha <code>&lt;DT></code>, each definition with a <code>&lt;DD></code>, and a <code>&lt;/DL></code> at the end, and yourlist will work quite nicely.<P>The <code>&lt;DT></code> and <code>&lt;DD></code> entries can contain multiple paragraphs (separated by<code>&lt;P></code> paragraph tags), lists, or other definition information.<h3>Extended Quotations and the &lt;BLOCKQUOTE> Tag</h3><P>Sometimes when you're designing a Web page you'll have a quote you wishto highlight within the text. The <code>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE></code> tag is used toautomatically indent and separate the quote from the rest of the text.For example:<P>My favorite passage in Henry V is<P><code>&lt;blockquote><br>I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,&lt;br><br>Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:&lt;br><br>Follow your spirit, and upon this charge,&lt;br><br>Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'&lt;<br>/blockquote><P>&lt;P>Though I think the St. Crispan's speech is pretty good, too.</code><P>The result is:<P>My favorite passage in Henry V is<P><blockquote>I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,<br>Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:<br>Follow your spirit, and upon this charge,<br>Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'</blockquote><P>Though I think the St. Crispan's speech is pretty good, too.<P>The <code>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE></code> tag distinguishes the quote from the other text. In thiscase, we've also used a few line break tags, <code>&lt;BR>'s</code>, to split up eachline. If the tags hadn't been included, it would look like this:<P>My favorite passage in Henry V is<blockquote>I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, Straining upon the start.The game's afoot: Follow your spirit, and upon this charge, Cry 'God forHarry, England, and Saint George!'</blockquote><P>Though I think the St. Crispan's speech is pretty good, too.<h3>Addresses</h3><P>The <code>&lt;ADDRESS></code> tag is generally used at the bottom of a document toacknowledge the author and how to contact him or her. For example, youmight try the following at the end of your page:<P><code>&lt;ADDRESS><br>GW Middle School Home Page / Anytown, USA / webmaster@gwms.edu<br>&lt;/ADDRESS></code><P>With that, you'd get this as a result:<p><address>GW Middle School Home Page / Anytown, USA / webmaster@gwms.edu</address><P>The <code>&lt;ADDRESS></code> tag highlights the text, usually by italicizing it. Thereare other methods of highlighting text (which will be covered in the nextsection), but in future Web browsers, the <code>&lt;ADDRESS></code> tag may take on otheruses, such as an automatic email response form or something of the like.<h3>In-line Images</h3><P>Most Web browsers can display in-line images (that is, images next totext) that are in X Bitmap (XBM) or GIF format. Each image takes time toprocess and slows down the initial display of the document, so generallyyou should not include too many or overly large images.<P>To include an in-line image, use<code>&lt;IMG SRC=image_URL></code> where image_URL  is the address of the image file. The syntax for IMG SRCURLs is identical to that used in an anchor HREF. If the image file is aGIF file, then the filename part of image_URL  must end with <code>.gif</code>.Filenames of X Bitmap images must end with <code>.xbm</code>.<P><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="button.gif">By default the bottom of an image is aligned with the text as shown inthis paragraph.<P><IMG ALIGN=top SRC="button.gif">You can add alignment commands such as <code>ALIGN=TOP</code> if you want the browserto align adjacent text with the top of the image as shown in thisparagraph. The full in-line image tag with the top alignment is:<br><code>&lt;IMG ALIGN=top SRC="button.gif"></code><P><IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="button.gif"><code>ALIGN=MIDDLE</code> aligns the text with the center of the image.<h4>Alternate Text for Browsers That Can't Display Images</h4><P>Some World Wide Web browsers, primarily those that run on VT100terminals, cannot display images. The <code>ALT</code> option allows you to specifytext to be displayed when an image cannot be. For example:<P>    <code>&lt;IMG SRC = "UpArrow.gif" ALT = "Up"></code><P>where <code>UpArrow.gif</code> is the picture of an upward pointing arrow. With NCSAMosaic and other graphics-capable viewers, the user sees the up arrowgraphic. With a VT100 browser, such as <em>Lynx</em>, the user sees the word"Up."<h3>External Images, Sounds, and Animations</h3><P>You may want to have an image open as a separate document when a useractivates a link on either a word or a smaller, in-line version of theimage included in your document. This is considered an external image andis useful if you do not wish to slow down the loading of the maindocument with large in-line images.<P>To include a reference to an external image, use<code>&lt;A HREF = image_URL >link anchor&lt;/A></code><P>The same syntax is used for links to external animations and sounds. Theonly difference is the file extension of the linked file. For example,<blockquote><code>&lt;A HREF = "QuickTimeMovie.mov">link anchor&lt;/A></code></blockquote><P>specifies a link to a <em>QuickTime</em> movie. Some common file types and theirextensions are:<pre><strong>File Type  			Extension</strong>Plain text          .txtHTML document       .htmlGIF image           .gifTIFF image          .tiffXBM bitmap image    .xbmJPEG image          .jpg or .jpegPostScript file     .psAIFF sound          .aiffAU sound            .auQuickTime movie     .movMPEG movie          .mpeg or .mpg</pre><P>Make sure your intended audience has the necessary viewers. Most UNIXworkstations, for instance, cannot view QuickTime movies.<h2>A Longer Example</h2><P>Here is a longer example of an HTML document:<P>&lt;HEAD>&lt;TITLE&gt;GWMS Home Page&lt;/TITLE&gt;<P>    &lt;TITLE&gt;A Longer Example&lt;/TITLE&gt;<P>    &lt;/HEAD&gt;<P>    &lt;BODY&gt;<P>    &lt;H1&gt;A Longer Example&lt;/H1&gt;<P>    This is a simple HTML document. This is the first    paragraph. &lt;P&gt;<P>    This is the second paragraph, which shows special effects.  This is a    word in &lt;I&gt;italics&lt;/I&gt;.  This is a word in &lt;B&gt;bold&lt;/B&gt;.&lt;P&gt;<P>    Here is an in-lined GIF image: &lt;IMG SRC = "barney3.gif"&gt;.<P>    &lt;P&gt;<P>    This is the third paragraph, which demonstrates links.  Here is    a hypertext link from the word &lt;A HREF = "andy.html"&gt;foo&lt;/A&gt;    to Andy's Home Page.<P>&lt;P&gt;    &lt;H2&gt;A second-level header&lt;/H2&gt;<P>    Here is a section of text that should display as a    fixed-width font: &lt;P&gt;<P>    &lt;PRE&gt;<P>        On the stiff twig up there<P>        Hunches a wet black rook<P>        Arranging and rearranging its feathers in the rain ...<P>    &lt;/PRE&gt;<P>    This is an unordered list with two items: &lt;P&gt;<P>    &lt;UL&gt;<P>    &lt;LI&gt; cranberries<P>    &lt;LI&gt; blueberries<P>    &lt;/UL&gt;<P>    This is the end of my example document. &lt;P&gt;<P>    &lt;ADDRESS&gt;Me (me@mycomputer.univ.edu)&lt;/ADDRESS&gt;<P>    &lt;/BODY&gt;<P><hr><A NAME="example2"></A>Were you able to follow the HTML? If you'd like to see how well you did, take a look a what this code <a href="code.html">really looks like</a>.<p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><P>In addition to tags already discussed, this example also uses the &lt;HEAD&gt;... &lt;/HEAD&gt; and &lt;BODY&gt; ... &lt;/BODY&gt; tags, which separate the document intointroductory information about the document and the main text of thedocument. These tags don't change the appearance of the formatteddocument at all, but are useful for several purposes (for example, NCSAMosaic for Macintosh 2.0, for example, allows you to browse just theheader portion of document before deciding whether to download the rest),and it is recommended that you use these tags.<TITLE>HTML Crash Course for Educators</TITLE><p><center><A HREF="resource.cntnts.html"><img border=0 src="home.gif" alt="Return to the EdWeb Home Room"></a><A HREF="dic.html"><img border=0 src="dic.gif" alt="I'd like to see the Edweb Dictionary"></a><A HREF="form.html"><img border=0 src="write.gif" alt="I'd like to send comments to EdWeb"></center></a></font><p><hr><center><em><A HREF="mailto:acarvin@k12.cnidr.org">EdWeb: Exploring Technology and School Reform, by Andy Carvin.

HTML doucuments can be written with any text editor. Use the 'source' button
 of your browser, or the 'save as' option to view the HTML source of a page you
 particularly like, and chances are you'll see its really not all that hard.
<p>
All HTML basically consists of is text, with markup 'tokens' around selected 
text to instruct your web browser to format it in a particular way. On the
 same plane, there are tags to indicate that you'd like a picture or the like
included in the document. HTML writing is fun, easy and generally intuitive.
<p>
There are several online tutorials around to help with anything from basic web
page creation to the more advanced topics of CGI programming and such. Follow
 the links I've put on this page, which are decently categorized, and remember
 that true web creation lies not in impressions, but how well you can spawn
 your own creativity into your work.
<p>
If this is your first time, or if you find that you need some inspiration, or
if you simply have some spare time, I urge you to read this 
wonderful essay by Vannevar Bush, titled <a href="http://www.isg.sfu.ca/~duchier/misc/vbush/"><strong><i>As We May Think</i></strong></a>, written in 1945. It is
quite amazing.
<p>
You may now also <a href="url-submit.html">submit a URL</a> for inclusion in the
 guide. This will be reviewed, and included within 24 hours.

Look for the <img src="new.gif"> tag for new links.

<p>This page is really for my own reference, but after getting many
   'how do you do <i>so-and-so</i> on your web page' questions I thought I'd share a list of
   sites I've found useful. Be warned of its Macintosh leanings, and that the
   links are geared toward those who already know the basics of putting up a
   web page. Newbies should refer to 
   <a href="http://www.interlog.com/~csteele/newbie.html"

<H1 align=right>        <a href="">     What is a Webmaster ?   </a>    </H1>

        There could of course be many variations of answers to this question,
        and I do not claim to provide the definitive one. However I have tried
        to research this question fully and carefully, and I've taken input
        from more authoritive people than myself. In particular, my starting
        template for this document was
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Provider/">
        Putting Information onto the Web</a>.

        As with most of my web creations, approximately half is adapted from
        other sources, which I hope I have adequately acknowledged;
        and approximately half is my own original sin.

        Especial thanks are due to Tim Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly.

        We will look at several r&ocirc;les related to, or interacting with,
        'webmaster'.
        The boundaries between these r&ocirc;les are not sharply defined;
        e.g. a webmaster might also sometimes perform authoring or system
        administration. In a small company he or she might perform all the
        tasks described here; and the r&ocirc;le may be much more specialized
        in a larger company.

<li>    <a href ="http://WWW.Stars.com/W3C/Provider/#sysadmin">System Administrator</a>
</ul>
        We could perhaps identify further r&ocirc;les such as publisher,
        designer, or programmer.
        These might be added in a future revision of this document.

        If you are a person responsible for managing the information provided
        by your organization, you have to balance the advantages of a "house
        style" with the advantages of giving each group or author free rein.
        If you end up with decisions in this area, it is as well to write them
        down (not to mention put them on the web).

        As an author, you have information you would like
        to publish onto the web.
        You will need to know how to create and edit hypertext,
        and you will need to learn the conventions and etiquette of the web.

        As a webmaster, you are responsible for the
        information base of a particular site or organization.
        You will probably want to learn how to organize
        large amounts of hypertext,
        and perhaps how to create and maintain a "house style".

        Webmaster duties typically
        will include editorial responsibility for the content,
        quality and style of the site,
        in collaboration with the area authors on the team.

        This will include finding, creating and
        installing tools to create web content and check consistency;
        development and enforcement of the house style,
        including liaison with graphic artists;
        and the development of interactive web applications.
<p>
        A webmaster should have demonstrable inspiration in, and understanding
        of, hypertext as a
        medium and proven experience in the creative use of UNIX in addition to
        excellent proofreading and editing skills.

        The ability to facilitate the arrival at consensus,
        a sense of clean design amid complex constraints, speed in prototyping,
        and the ability to hold long-term goals in mind while
        producing immediate solutions are key.

        The ability to work both
        independently and effectively with others is a necessary qualification,
        as are good communication and writing skills.
        You will need to be more
        familiar with the server in order to set up a configuration
        that works for your data,
        and you will probably want to
        learn about various tools that can be useful.

        The server administrator (the one with the root password) in principle
        has the power to turn the thing on or off, and control what happens.
        However, it is wise to have clearly delegated responsibility for
        separate areas of documentation. Maybe the server administrator has no
        responsibility at all for the actual content of the data, in which case
        he or she should just keep the machine running properly.

Today, I am going to show you some new thingsabout LISTSERV, including what LISTSERV was originally designedfor -- mailing lists.<P>Remember, though, that this lesson only covers LISTSERV lists.In fact, this lesson is an elementary lesson for ordinaryLISTSERV users like you and me. Tomorrow's lesson will be ahighly technical lesson for LISTSERV (and other mailing listservers) gurus-to-be.<P>What is a LISTSERV mailing list? Quite simply, it is a listmaintained by a LISTSERV program of a whole bunch of peoplewho share similar interests. Anyone can subscribe to alist by sending a SUBSCRIBE command (remember those?) tothe LISTSERV address. Any e-mail letter sent to the list'saddress is copied and mass-mailed to the e-mail box of everyperson subscribed to the list. Everyone else on the list canthen reply to that letter, and then ... well, you get the picture.<P>LISTSERV lists give you a way to have open discussions withdozens (or even hundreds) of people on a myriad of topics.Best of all, it is all done through e-mail!<P>I want to say something about the difference betweenlist addresses and LISTSERV addresses. Let's pretend that Icreate a list here at the University of Alabama for theopen discussion of power line-chomping squirrels. I'lleven call the list "SQUIRREL".<P>The address for our pretend squirrel discussion list would beSQUIRREL@UA1VM.UA.EDU (or SQUIRREL@UA1VM.BITNET). Any e-mailletter sent to the SQUIRREL@UA1VM.UA.EDU address would becopied and mass-mailed to every single person subscribed tothe squirrel list. That's simple enough.<P>But how are people going to subscribe to my squirrel list? We needa second address just to handle all of the commands for the list!That second address is the LISTSERV address (which, in thiscase, is LISTSERV@UA1VM.UA.EDU).<P>Are you starting to see the picture?<P>The list address is the address you send something to if youwant it to be distributed to everyone else subscribed to thelist. The LISTSERV address is the address you send all of yourcommands to.<P>What would happen if you sent a command (like SUBSCRIBE or GET)to the discussion list's address instead of to the LISTSERV'saddress? Simple -- your command would be treated like a letterand would be sent to everyone on the list (how embarrassing!).<P>Remember this (and you will see this on a pop quiz sometime):    -  Send your LETTERS to the list address!    -  Send your COMMANDS to the LISTSERV address!Now, life would be a whole bunch easier if the only LISTSERV inthe world was at the University of Alabama. But, it isn't. Thereare thousands of different LISTSERVs around the world, andthere are literally tens of thousands of different LISTSERV lists.<P>How are you ever going to find out what different discussionlists are out there, and what these lists' addresses are?Well, there are a couple of ways to do this:     1. Word of mouth -- someone tells you about a hot new        list you need to check out.     2. Internet Yellow Pages -- there are some GREAT books        you can buy in most bookstores that tell you where        all of the neat stuff is on the Internet (as a matter        of fact, Osborne/McGraw-Hill has given me permission        to quote from their "Internet Yellow Pages" later on        in this workshop!!).     3. The LIST GLOBAL or LIST GLOBAL / STRING command -- we'll        talk about this in MAP06.     4. Announcements on other lists.How are you ever going to figure out which LISTSERV addressgoes with which discussion list? EASY! This trick only workswith LISTSERV discussion lists, but if you take the full addressof a discussion list (like SQUIRREL@UA1VM.UA.EDU) and replacethe discussion list's name with the word "LISTSERV", you'llend up with the correct LISTSERV address for that particularlist (in this case, the correct LISTSERV address for thesquirrel list would be LISTSERV@UA1VM.UA.EDU).<P>A few more examples:<UL>     CHAUCER@UICVM.BITNET - LISTSERV@UICVM.BITNET<BR>     ROADMAP@UA1VM.UA.EDU - LISTSERV@UA1VM.UA.EDU<BR>     PPD-L@HUMBER.BITNET -  LISTSERV@HUMBER.BITNET<BR>     VEGLIFE@VTVM1.BITNET - LISTSERV@VTVM1.BITNET<BR></UL>Why is this important to know? Well, let's say that I tell youthat there is a LISTSERV list called VEGLIFE@VTVM1.BITNET thatyou really need to subscribe to. All I have given you is the list'saddress. Remember, you can only send LETTERS to the list addressYou need the LISTSERV address in order to subscribe!<P>With this trick, you automatically know that the LISTSERV addressfor VEGLIFE@VTVM1.BITNET is LISTSERV@VTVM1.BITNET and youcan subscribe to the list without any problem!<P>You may notice that some list addresses look something like this:<P>     CRUISE-L@UNLVM <P>   MAPTEST@UA1VM <P>    NAVIGATE@UBVM<P>Those are BITNET addresses. To turn these addresses into somethingthat you can use, you'll have to add .BITNET to the end of the addresses:<P>     CRUISE-L@UNLVM.BITNET <P> MAPTEST@UA1VM.BITNET <P> NAVIGATE@UBVM.BITNET<P>and the LISTSERV addresses would be:<P>     LISTSERV@UNLVM.BITNET<P>  LISTSERV@UA1VM.UA.EDU <P> LISTSERV@UBVM.BITNET<P>One nice thing about this is that you can almost always tell thata list is a LISTSERV list by looking at the list's address. Ifthe address is LIST@NODE or LIST@NODE.BITNET, you can all but betthat the list is a LISTSERV list.<P>Now let's talk about some new LISTSERV commands. You alreadyknow the SUBSCRIBE command<P>     SUBSCRIBE listname <your full name><P>and the GET command<P>     GET filename filetype F=MAIL<P>I want to show you a couple of other commands that will make yourlife a whole lot easier (remember, all commands must be sent toa LISTSERV address).<P>If you ever need to unsubscribe from a list, the UNSUBSCRIBE commandwill take care of everything. There are three different UNSUBSCRIBEcommands that you can use:<UL>     UNSUBSCRIBE listname          -- to unsubscribe from a particular                                      list (you need to replace the                                      word "listname" with the name                                      of a the list you are dropping)<BR>     UNSUBSCRIBE *                 -- to unsubscribe from every list                                      at a particular Listserv address<BR>     UNSUBSCRIBE GLOBAL            -- to unsubscribe from every LISTSERV                                      list on the planet<BR></UL>Have you ever accidentally thrown away an e-mail letter? Well,if that letter was from a LISTSERV list and if that list keepsan archive, you can retrieve that letter from the LISTSERV!Here is how to do it:<P>     1. Send an INDEX listname F=MAIL command to the LISTSERV address        (for example, to get the index for the squirrel list,        your command would say INDEX SQUIRREL F=MAIL).<P>     2. Look through the index to find the file or notebook that        you want to retrieve (the index will even tell you the        filename and filetypes for each of the files!!).<P>     3. Use the GET filename filetype F=MAIL command to get the        file or notebook that you want.<P>Remember: you send LETTERS to the list address; you sendCOMMANDS to the LISTSERV address. Etch this into your brain :)<P>There are a couple more things I want to talk about, but I'llsave them until tomorrow :)<P><H3>REVIEW:</H3><P><UL>     <LI>LISTSERV lists are (usually) discussion lists that are       (usually) open to any who wants to subscribe     <LI> You subscribe to a LISTSERV list using the SUBSCRIBE       LISTNAME <YOUR FULL NAME> command     <LI> Letters are sent to the list address, commands to the       LISTSERV address.     <LI>You find new lists through word of mouth, Internet Yellow       Pages (and other books), the LIST GLOBAL and LIST GLOBAL /       STRING command, and announcements on other lists.     <LI>The LISTSERV address can be found by replacing the       listname in the address with the word LISTSERV       (listname@address ---> LISTSERV@address). This only       works with LISTSERV addresses, though.     <LI>You need to change addresses like list@node to       list@node.bitnet before you can use the address.     <LI>To unsubscribe from a list, use the UNSUBSCRIBE,       UNSUBSCRIBE *, or UNSUBSCRIBE GLOBAL command (remember       that all commands must be sent to the LISTSERV address).     <LI>To receive a list of all of the files that you can       get from a particular LISTSERV list, use the INDEX       LISTNAME command. You can then use the GET FILENAME       FILETYPE F=MAIL command to get the files that you       want.     <LI>You send letters to the list address, commands to the       LISTSERV address.</UL><H3>HOMEWORK:</H3><P>This homework assignment is completely optional. Also, you arereminded to contact your school system administrator if youhave questions about, or difficulties with, any part of the Roadmapworkshop (please do not write me -- my mailer can't handle thevolume).<P>1)   If you would like an in-depth guide to LISTSERV, GET the     file LSVGUIDE MEMO from the LISTSERV file server at     LISTSERV@EARNCC.BITNET (note that this is *NOT* on the     University of Alabama's LISTSERV file server).<P>2)   If you would like a very brief guide to LISTSERV, GET the     file LISTSERV REFCARD from the LISTSERV file server     at the University of Alabama. This is a list of a whole bunch     of LISTSERV commands, along with a brief explanation of what     each command does.<P> +----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+<br>:  PATRICK DOUGLAS CRISPEN   :  The views expressed in this letter do not  :<br>:   PCRISPE1@UA1VM.UA.EDU    :   necessarily represent the views of the    :<br>: THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA  :     University of Alabama - Tuscaloosa.     :<br>+----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+<br>:       Roadmap: Copyright Patrick Crispen 1994.

<H1>Writing HTML<!-- describe the document, avoid context sensative descriptions -->
<!-- keywords for the document --><!-- should be "document" unless providing a search, then "service" -->
</H1>

<H2>HTML Basics</H2>

<UL>
<LI>HTML documents are plain ASCII text. You can use notepad,
vi, emacs or any other text editor/word processor that will save
in an ASCII format
<LI>There are also several WYSIWYG HTML editors available for
various platforms. We'll learn the basics of <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers/World_Wide_Web/HTML_Editors/MS_Windows/HTML_Assistant/">HTML Assistant</A>.
Additionally, some text editors such as MS Word, have HTML templates,
converters or other such useful things.
<LI>HTML documents are described using HTML <EM>tags</EM>. Tags
have four basic elements:
<UL>
<LI>A left angle bracket (less than sign): &lt;
<LI>Followed by the name of the tag (such as LI or OL)
<LI>Ending with the right angle bracket (greater than sign): &gt;
<LI><EM>Some</EM> tags come in pairs. The starting tag will generally
look like &lt;H1&gt;, the ending tag will be the same--with the
addition of a slash &quot;/&quot; like so, &lt;/H1&gt;.
</UL>

<LI>HTML is <EM>not</EM> case sensitive.
</UL>
<HR>

<H2>Basic Markup Tags</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Title Tag: &lt; <CODE>TITLE</CODE>&gt;your title here&lt;<CODE>/TITLE</CODE>&gt;
<LI>Effect: Displayed separately from the document itself. Usually
in the title bar, used as title for bookmark.
<LI>Use: Think of a few words to describe your document, and make
them the title.
<LI>Example: The title of this document is &quot;Writing HTML&quot;
<LI>Headings Tag: &lt;<CODE>H</CODE><VAR>y</VAR>&gt;Your Heading
Here &lt;<CODE>/H</CODE><VAR>y</VAR>&gt; where y is a heading
level between 1 and 6. Major headings are level 1 headings.
<LI>Effect: Displayed in a larger font, usually in bold.
<LI>Use: Headings separate the document into logical sections.
Usually the first level 1 heading and the title are the same thing.
<LI>Example: &quot;Basic Markup Tags&quot; is a level two heading.
<LI>Paragraphs Tag: &lt;<CODE>P</CODE>&gt;
<LI>Effect: Inserts a line break and blank line.
<LI>Use: HTML ignores Carriage returns and squishes lines of spaces
into one space. The paragraph tags separates them.
<LI>Example This line and the next line are separated by a paragraph
tag<BR>
but are on the same line in the HTML file.
<LI>Links Tag: &lt;<CODE>A HREF=&quot;</CODE><VAR>filename/URL</VAR><CODE>&quot;</CODE>&gt;text
for your link here &lt;<CODE>/A</CODE>&gt;. where <VAR>filename/URL</VAR>
is the absolute or relative URL for the file you are linking to.
Absolute paths list out the entire path to the document, including
the machine address. Relative paths give the path from the directory
containing the current document.
<LI>Effect: text for the link appears underlined and/or in a different
color. Clicking on the text will take the user to the linked document.
<LI>Use: Link your stuff in with other stuff, such as other sources
of information or further explanation of a difficult concept.
<LI>Example: This is a <A href="http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/whyfm.html">link to an example</A>
of using links to explain new words or concepts.
<LI>Horizontal Rules Tag: &lt;<CODE>HR</CODE>&gt;
<LI>Effect: draws a horizontal line across the window.
<LI>Use: a visual way to separate sections
<LI>Example: A horizontal rule follows to separate this section
from the next:
</UL>

<P>
<HR>

<H2>Lists</H2>

<P>
HTML supports unordered, ordered and dictionary lists.
<H3>Unordered Lists</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Start with a &lt;<CODE>UL</CODE>&gt; tag.
<LI>Put an &lt;<CODE>LI</CODE>&gt; tag in front of each item in
the list
<LI>End the list with &lt;<CODE>/UL</CODE>&gt;
</OL>

<P>
Other HTML tags can be nested inside the text in an &lt;<CODE>LI</CODE>&gt;
item.
<H3>Ordered Lists</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Start with a &lt;<CODE>OL</CODE>&gt; tag.
<LI>Put an &lt;<CODE>LI</CODE>&gt; tag in front of each item in
the list
<LI>End the list with &lt;<CODE>/OL</CODE>&gt;
</OL>

<P>
You don't have to type the numbers in an ordered list, they are
inserted automatically. Like unnumbered lists, the body of an
item in a numbered list can contain other HTML tags.
<H3>Dictionary Lists</H3>

<P>
Dictionary lists look like glossaries when displayed. There are
four tags in dictionary lists:
<OL>
<LI>Start with a &lt;DL&gt; tag
<LI>Each element of the list has two parts, the first is tagged
with a &lt;DT&gt; dictionary term tag.
<LI>Then delimit the definition with the &lt; DD&gt; dictionary
definition tag. Other lists or HTML tags can be nested within
the body of the &lt; DD&gt;.
<LI>After defining all the terms, close with &lt;/DL&gt;
</OL>

<P>
The section titled &quot;Basic Markup Tags&quot; in this page
is an example of a Dictionary List. <HR>

<H2>Images and Other HTML Tags</H2>

<H3>Images</H3>

<P>
Images work a lot like links. The basic format is the same, the
format looks like
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&lt; <CODE>IMG SRC = </CODE><VAR>image_URL</VAR> &gt; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<VAR>image_URL</VAR> is the URL for the image, it has the exact
same format as for HREF tags. The image should be in GIF format.
Netscape can display GIFs and JPEGs inline, but not all browsers
can.
<P>
Images can also include an align code, the format looks just the
same with one addition:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&lt; <CODE>IMG ALIGN=</CODE><VAR>position</VAR><CODE> SRC = </CODE><VAR>image_URL</VAR>
&gt; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
where <VAR>position</VAR> is one of <CODE>center, top, bottom</CODE>.
<P>
<IMG src="snowshoe.gif"> The default is <CODE>bottom</CODE>
<P>
<IMG align=top src="snowshoe.gif"> This is <CODE>align=top</CODE>
<P>
<IMG align = middle src="snowshoe.gif"> This is <CODE>align=middle</CODE>

<H3>Text Formatting Commands</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Preformatted text Tag: &lt;PRE&amp;rt;&lt;/PRE;&gt;
<LI>Effect: Text is displayed just like you typed it. Spaces,
tabs, and carriage returns are significant (usually, they are
ignored).
<LI>Use: when you've already got the text formatted, and you don't
want WWW browsers messing with it.
<LI>Example: Here's an example of using preformatted text to fake
a <A href="http://lal.cs.byu.edu/cs330/syllabus.html">class syllabus</A>.
<LI>Extended Quotations Tag: &lt;<CODE>BLOCKQUOTE</CODE>&gt;&lt;<CODE>/BLOCKQUOTE</CODE>&gt;
<LI>Effect: Indented just like an extended quote should be.
<LI>Use: When you have a long quote that needs to be indented.
<LI>Example: Here's an extended quote from the <A href="http://io.datasys.swri.edu/Lost.html">Getting Lost</A>
page.
<LI>First, do *nothing*. Sit down, take it easy, try to calm down.
Look at the pretty scenery. Maybe you'll notice something you
recognize. (However don't be hasty about &quot;recognizing&quot;
landmarks. Remember you may want to see something familiar so
badly that you don't notice that it isn't really what you want
it to be.) Of course if the weather is nasty you may need to start
seeking shelter. If this is the case try to either find or build
shelter quickly and close by. If you are in a group discuss the
situation and try to keep everybody calm (especially yourself).
Try to keep the group together unless there is a *compelling*
reason to split up. And no, disagreement over what to do is not
a compelling reason to split up. <BR>
Notice how the text was indented.
<LI>Addresses Tag: &lt;<CODE>ADDRESS</CODE>&gt;&lt;<CODE>/ADDRESS</CODE>&gt;
<LI>Effect: Most browsers (all?) put the text in italics.
<LI>Use: When you want to set apart the address or name of an
author, source or etc.
<LI>Example: At the bottom of this page, my name and the updated
date are in an address field.
</UL>

<P>

<H3>Character Formatting</H3>

<P>
There are physical and logical styles. Logical styles describe
the meaning of your text and the browser decides how to display
the text. Logical styles separate meaning from display, this allows
flexibility in displays. Physical styles tell the browsers exactly
how to display the text without making any mention of what the
text means. Use logical styles whenever possible.
<P>
Logical Styles: there are many more than what's listed here. See
the styles pull down menu in HTML assistant for more. These are
just the common ones:
<DL>
<DT>&lt;<CODE><B>DFN</B></CODE>&gt;
<DD>defining a term
<DT>&lt;<CODE><B>EM</B></CODE>&gt;
<DD>emphasizing a word or phrase.
<DT>&lt;<CODE><B>CODE</B></CODE>&gt;
<DD>code from a computer program.
<DT>&lt;<CODE><B>STRONG</B></CODE>&gt;
<DD>make a word or phrase appear strong.
</DL>

<P>
Physical Styles: there's only three:
<DL>
<DT>&lt;<CODE><B>B</B></CODE>&gt;
<DD>bold
<DT>&lt;<CODE><B>I</B></CODE>&gt;
<DD>italic
<DT>&lt;<CODE><B>TT</B></CODE>&gt;
<DD>typewriter text (fixed width).
</DL>

<P>
Using any of the logical or physical styles has the same format,
it looks like:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&lt;<VAR>tag</VAR>&gt; the text to which to apply the style. &lt;/<VAR>tag</VAR>&gt;

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Where <VAR>tag</VAR> is one of the codes mentioned above. <HR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="-2">client.www.emissary -- dat/www.dat </FONT><BR>

<P>
&quot;Wollongong's Emissary is a new Internet access solution
featuring Web browsing, multimedia e-mail and news reading, file
retrieval, and interactive access all in a single, integrated
Windows application. Emissary addresses problems that Internet
users have been struggling with for years--complexity and inefficiency.
What sets Emissary apart from the pack is the incorporation of
COLT(TM)--Wollongong's object oriented, Client Object Linking
Technology, the intelligent agent that insulates users from all
those multi-letter acronyms like FTP, HTTP, MIME, etc.
<P>
&quot;Before Emissary, Internet users were forced to buy different
applications with separate user interfaces to utilize select Internet
resources. These separate applications require users to manipulate
multiple applications and various protocols to do simple tasks,
such as viewing an image contained in a mail message or news item.
With Emissary, all the complexities of Internet protocols are
negotiated and executed automatically.
<P>
&quot;EMISSARY IS CURRENTLY IN THE BETA TEST PHASE. IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT THE FINAL VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE.
<P>
&quot;The Beta-5a version of Emissary will expire and cease to
operate on 31 August 1995. Please check the Wollongong Web pages
for periodic software updates.
<P>
&quot;Wollongong is pleased to offer this opportunity to evaluate
Emissary Beta to the entire Internet community. Input from Beta
users, like yourself, will help Wollongong improve Emissary before
its final release.&quot; <FONT SIZE="-1">README-type Text Description:

<P>
Platform: Windows 95, Windows NT.
<P>
&quot;<B>HotJava</B>(tm) is a prototype of a World-Wide Web browser
with the unique feature that it displays &quot;executable content&quot;
written in the Java programming language.
<P>
&quot;The primary goal of this Alpha release is to allow people
to try the various demos and to write their own Java applets.
This Alpha release of HotJava is not intended to replace your
favorite browser for daily web surfing.
<P>
&quot;Because of exceptionally high interest from Windows 95 users,
we are releasing this version now despite a couple of major crash-causing
bugs (for more details, see <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/KnownBugs-win32.html">http://java.sun.com/KnownBugs-win32.html</A>).
We are keeping these bugs in mind, but are currently focusing
our development resources on a stable and feature-complete beta
release.
<P>
&quot;Requirements for running Java/HotJava Alpha3:
<UL>
<LI>An Intel x86-based machine running Windows NT 3.5 or Windows
95.
<LI>See <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/installation-alpha3-win32-x86.html">http://java.sun.com/installation-alpha3-win32-x86.html</A>
for details.
</UL>

<P>
&quot;<B>Java</B> and <B>HotJava</B> are available without a fee
for non-commercial use (academic, research and internal business
purposes). Commercial licensing terms will be announced soon.&quot;
<P>
&quot;For instructions on downloading HotJava Alpha3 for Win32,
browse <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/installation-alpha3-win32-x86.html">http://java.sun.com/installation-alpha3-win32-x86.html</A>.
&quot;In addition to the documentation included in this release,

&quot;<I>Internet Assistant </I>and <I>Microsoft Viewer</I> for
<I> Microsoft Word for Windows</I> -- Questions &amp; Answers,
Updated February 1995:
<DL>
<DT>&quot;What is Microsoft Word Internet Assistant?
<DD>&quot;<I>Microsoft Internet Assistant</I> is a free add-on
that makes <I>Word</I> for Windows the easiest, most powerful
tool for creating exploring,and sharing information on the World
Wide Web, a global network of servers on the <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>.
<DT>&quot;What is Microsoft Word Viewer?
<DD><I>Microsoft Word Viewer </I>enables users who do not own
<I>Word for Windows</I> to easily view and print <I>Word</I> documents.
<DT>&quot;How do I get these items and when will they be available?
<DD>&quot;<I>Microsoft Internet Assistant</I> and <I>Microsoft
Viewer</I> will be posted under the &quot;What's New&quot; heading
of the Microsoft Home Page of the World Wide Web. Microsoft's
Home Page can be accessed at the URL <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/ </A>by
anyone who is connected to the <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>.
They will also be available on floppy disk directly from Microsoft
at (800) 426-9400 ($5.50 shipping and handling charge will be
applied). <I>Internet Assistant</I> will be available first for
North American versions of <I>Word</I>. It will be fully tested
for all other English versions of <I>Word</I> and then will be
adjustedto work with French and German versions of <I>Word</I>.
Look for informationon how to obtain a pre-release version of
<I>Internet Assistant</I> under the &quot;What's New&quot; heading
of the Microsoft Home Page of the World Wide Web in the very near
future.

<OL>
<LI>&quot;Why would a user want Internet Assistant? Anyone who
knows <I>Word</I> now knows how to write documents for the <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>:
<UL>
<LI>With <I>Internet Assistant</I> creating a document for the
<A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>, complete with
hyperlinks is as easy as saving a file. Now Microsoft <I>Word</I>
automatically generates hypertext markup language ( <A HREF="glossary.html#html">HTML </A>),
the standard file format of the World Wide Web. <I>Microsoft Internet
Assistant</I> eliminates the need for users to learn the complex
<A HREF="glossary.html#html">HTML </A>format or spend time manually
inputting <A HREF="glossary.html#html">HTML </A>tags.
<LI>Users also benefit from <I>Word</I>'s point and click formatting
options and convenient toolbars when they use <I>Internet Assistant</I>
to create documents for the <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>.
<LI>It's <I>Microsoft Word</I>, all the Intellisense features
like AutoCorrect and AutoFormat that have made <I>Word</I> the
all-time best selling word processor are available now for <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>authoring.
</UL>

<LI>Microsoft Office and the <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>Work
Together Like One:
<UL>
<LI>Create <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>documents
in <I>Word</I>'s own file format, bringing all the ease of use
and powerful features of <I>Microsoft Office</I> applications
to users writing documents for the <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>.
<LI>Create hyperlinks between <I>Word</I> documents with cut and
paste ease.
<LI>Create compound documents using Microsoft Office applications
AND the power of OLE.
<LI>Create &quot;internal Webs&quot; by linking <I>Word</I> documents
shared on internal network servers, bringing the power of the
<A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>to organizations.
</UL>

<LI>You can Use <I>Microsoft Word</I> to Explore the <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>:
<UL>
<LI>With built in support for the most popular protocols, <I>Internet
Assistant</I> brings users access to the already vast and rapidly
expanding world of information available on the <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>,
in the easy and familiar <I>Word</I> interface.
<LI>With one click in <I>Word</I>, users can switch between editing
and browsing modes, freeing them from learning different editing
and browsing tools, and the cumbersome process of switching between
applications.
</UL>

</OL>

<DL>
<DT>&quot;Where does the Viewer fit in?
<DD>&quot;People who already own <I>Word</I> do not necessarily
need the <I>Word Viewer</I>. If someone creates a document in
<I>Word</I> format with hyperlinks and posts it on the Web, another
person who does not own <I>Word</I> can use the <I>Word Viewer</I>
and any $(Internet) browsing tool (like <A HREF="mosaic.html#ncsa">NCSA Mosaic World Wide Web Browser </A>or
<A HREF=".html#">NCSA Mosaic World Wide Web Browser </A>) to view
that document. One can create documents in <I>Word</I> format
with <I>Internet Assistant</I> that have rich formatting (like
text that wraps around graphics and multiple columns) that surpasses
the level of formatting possible in <A HREF="glossary.html#html">HTML </A>authoring.
<DT>&quot;How does Word simplify creating Web pages?
<DD>&quot;Anyone who knows <I>Word</I> automatically knows how
to write documents for the <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>because
<I>Word</I> now automatically generates hypertext markup language
( <A HREF="glossary.html#html">HTML </A>), the standard file format
of World Wide Web documents. Users no longer need to learn the
<A HREF="glossary.html#html">HTML </A>format or spend time manually
inputting <A HREF="glossary.html#html">HTML </A>tags to create
documents for the World Wide Web. <I>Word</I> does it for them.
<I>Microsoft Internet Assistant</I> also makes creating hyperlinks
between documents easy as cutting and pasting across documents.
<DT>&quot;How does Internet Assistant work with my other Office
applications like Excel, Powerpoint and Access?
<DD>&quot;Users can embed OLE objects (like spreadsheets, tables,
presentations, etc.) within a <I>Word</I> document just as always.
Users can then create hyperlinks to these richly-formatted compound
documents and thus overcome the limitations of the <A HREF="glossary.html#html">HTML </A>format.
<DT>&quot;What do I need to make Internet Assistant work?
<DD>&quot;You need <I>Microsoft Word for Windows version </I>6.0.
Also, you need to have appropriate hardware, physical connectivity
to the <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>, and a service
provider to provide <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>access.
Check with a local reseller regarding appropriate hardware and
an Internet service provider in your area for more details.
<DT>&quot;Does Word let you browse or surf the <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>?
<DD>&quot;Yes. Once you have an <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>connection,
it's easy to connectto and browse the <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>because
you can do it right from <I>Word</I>'s familiar interface, eliminating
the need to use different authoring and browsing tools. Users
also have access to the most popular <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>services
because <I>Microsoft Internet Assistant</I> comes with built in
support for the key <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>protocols
( <A HREF="glossary.html#http">HTTP </A>), FTP, Gopher).
<DT>&quot;How will this work with Microsoft Network? Is there
a connection?
<DD>&quot;Microsoft Network will be allowing users to interact
with many of the features on the <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>.
Our tools are targeted at the customer who wishes to produce and
publish materials for Web Servers. As Microsoft Network customers
will, over time, be able to view Web information, the natural
connection is, again, allowing the customers to use tools they
own and tools they know.
<DT>&quot;Will Internet Assistant Work with NT Word?
<DD>&quot;This release of the <I>Internet Assistant for Word</I>
includes several 16-bit components. Unfortunately, it is technically
impossible to integrate these 16-bit components with a 32-bit
application like <I>NT Word</I>.<BR>
Users who are running 16-bit <I>Word for Windows</I> on NT machines
will be able to use the 16-bit version of <I>Internet Assistant</I>
to be released soon.<BR>
After the release of the 16-bit version of <I>Internet Assistant
for Word for Windows </I>6.0, we will begin working on a 32-bit
version that will work on both <I>NT Word</I> and <I>Word 7.0
for Windows 95</I>.
<DT>&quot;Are there plans to make this available on other operating
systems?
<DD>&quot;<I>Internet Assistant</I> will work on 16-bit <I>Word</I>
running on Windows NT. We are very interested in developing <I>Internet
Assistant for the Macintosh</I>, but are still investigating the
possibility ofachieving this goal.
<DT>&quot;Why is Microsoft providing Internet Assistant and Microsoft
Viewer?
<DD>&quot;As millions of people have begun to discover on-line
publishing,our users wanted us to bring the ease of use and power
of <I>Word</I> to the <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>.
<I>Internet Assistant</I> allows <I>Word</I> users to tap into
and benefit from the exploding world of on-line publishing by
putting unlimited resources within reach and by allowing people
to easily make their documents available to broad audiences. The
<I>Word Viewer</I> is an effort to increase the size of the audiencefor
<I>Word</I> documents and to introduce the power of <I>Word</I>
to those computer users who have not yet experienced the world's
best selling word processor. Together, <I>Internet Assistant</I>
and the <I>Word Viewer</I> make <I>Microsoft Word</I> the easiest,
most powerful tool for creating exploring, and sharing information
on the fast-growing <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>.
<DT>&quot;What do I need in order to access the <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>using
<I>Internet Assistant</I>?
<DD>&quot;Web viewing support requires an existing <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>connection,
including $(TCP/IP) support and a WINSOCK.DLL. <A HREF="glossary.html#internet">Internet </A>connectivity
can be obtained separately from an Internet service provider.&quot;

	<li> Inline graphics.  What makes WWW pages interesting.  These are also what makes it so slow.  In <A HREF="http://www.davis.k12.ut.us/JHarris.html">my homepage,</A> the pictures take 30,887 bytes and the text (including html commands) takes only 11312 bytes.
	<li> Links. They appear different than the regular text.  They may be underlined, colored, both or neither.  The words "my homepage" are a link in the previous sentence.
	</ol>

<p><LI> Toolbar buttons
	<ol type=a>
	<li> appear right above the <B>Location: </B> line and just below the Directories line.
	<li> Back.  Reloads the previous web page.
	<li> Forward.  Any guesses?
	<li> Home.  Reloads the default homepage.  Particularly useful if you get lost.
	<li> Reload.  Reloads the current page.  
	<li> Images.  If the images weren't loaded (we'll get to that) this button will load them.
	<li> Open.  Click, type a location and click again to open a specific location.
	<li> Find.  Find a word in the page.
	<li> Stop.  Stop the loading of a page from the Web.
	</ol>

<p><LI> Following Links.
	<ol type=a>
	<li> click on a highlighted word or phrase
	<li> or click on an outlined image.
	<li> the highlighted phrase or word may or may not have anything to do with the link--but usualy does.
	</ol>

<p><LI> Jumping to a specific page.
	<ol type=a>
	<li> Type in a URL
		<ol type=i>
		<li> They <B>are</B> case sensitive.
		<li> you must not make any mistakes at all
		<li> its a good idea to aviod typing them.  Cut and paste works well as does following links.
		</ol>
	<li> An example: we'll jump right to the Xerox map server at <A HREF="http://pubweb.parc.xerox.com/map">http://pubweb.parc.xerox.com/map</A>.
		<ol type=i>
		<li> click on <TT>File</TT>|<TT>Open Location</TT> or <br>
		        click on Open.
		<li> Type the URL in the location field.  You may have to delete an old one.
		<li> Click on Open or press <TT><Enter></TT>.
		<li> wait.
		<li> Another way to open a specific URL is to type it right into the location line in the Netscape window and press <TT><Enter></TT>
		<li> Notice the map is outlined.  This means the image is linked somewhere, much like a button.  The map is also why the page took so long to load.
		</ol>
	</ol>

<p><LI> Jump Back
	<ol type=a>
	<li> Click on Back.
	<li> If done enough times, this will take you back to your homepage
	<li> Jumping back is usefull when you encounter a boring page (this happens quite often) or need to get back to something usefull.
	<li> Opening the <TT>Go</TT> menu and selecting <TT>Back</TT> will do the same thing and give the keyboard shortcut.
	</ol>

<p><LI> Jump forward
	<ol type=a>
	<li> Possible after going back.
	<li> If the button is faded, its not possible.
	<li> Also availible under the <TT>Go</TT> menu.
	</ol>

<p><LI> The history list.
	<ol type=a>
	<li> A list of the places you've visited, with the most recent on top.
	<li> To find it, select <TT>Go</TT> then <TT>View History</TT>.
	<li> The line for the page in the viewer is highlighted and your homepage should appear at the bottom of the list.
	<li> To select a page from the list, simply highlight it and click on Go To.  
	<li> Close closes the history list
	<li> Create bookmark makes a bookmark of the highlighted entry.  More about bookmarks coming up.
	</ol>

<p><LI> Stop.
	<ol type=a>
	<li> Click on Stop when Netscape seems to hang.
	<li> Why would netscape hang?  Mostly from temporary quirks in the Internet.
	<li> If Stop is faded, there's no page loading to stop.
	</ol>

<h2>Part 2:  Its still prety easy</h2>

<hr>

<ol type=1>

<LI> Making the best of of the screen
	<ol type=a> 
	<li>Set your Windows display drivew to 1024x468 pixels
		<ol type=i>
		<li> Double click Setup icon.  Select Options|Change System Settings.
		<li> Open display list, select resolution and color.
		<li> Tell windows where to find the driver.
		<li> Restart windows.
		<li> <STRONG>Note</STRONG> some graphics drivers have their own setup icon.  If yours does, use it instead.
		</ol>
	<li>Change the size of the toolbar.
		<ol type=i>
		<li> You can turn off text, images or both.
		<li> Without text, its hard to tell what the buttons do
		<li> Without pictures, the toolbar is both small and usefull.
		<li> To do it:  Choose Options|Preferences, make the change.  To save, choose Options|Save Options.
		</ol>
	<li> Remove the Location Field
		<ol type=i>
		<li> Prevents timid users from being intimidated by URLs
		<li> Eliminates a shortcut for direct jumps to specific pages.
		<li> To do it:  Choose Options|Show Location and save if desired. 
		</ol>
	<li> Get rid of directory buttons
		<ol type=i>
		<li> All the links are duplicated in the pull-down menu
		<li> To do it:  Choose Options|Show Directory Buttons
		</ol>
	<li> Dump the security colorbars
		<ol type=i>
		<li> Duplicated by the key icon: <IMG SRC="key.gif">.
		<li> There aren't very many secure hosts in the first place.
		<li> To do it: Choose Options|Show Security Colorbars
		</ol>
	<li> Use 2 or 3 or more windows
		<ol type=i>
		<li> Each window acts indepent of the others.
		<li> <STRONG>Except</STRONG> Close window which happily closes all of them.
		<li> To do it:  Choose File|New Window
		</ol>
	</ol>
<P>
<LI> Handling Multimedia
	<ol type=a>
	<li> Although the web was developed with Multimedia in mind, multimedia on the web only works mostly well.  There are two problems:
		<ol type=i>
		<li> Images/movies/sound are big.  They take along time to load, they use alot of resources.
		<li> There aren't definitive standards for multimedia.  Some standards are less supported on some platforms than others (.bmp or .eps for example)
		</ol>
	<li> Netscape itself doens't deal with multimedia, it calls helper applications which do.  
	<li> Dealing with random glitches, line noise and other inexplicable problems.
		<ol type=i>
		<li> Select View|Refresh.  Refresh redraws the screen and fixes problems caused when your graphics card burps.
		<li> Reload images.  Fixes images garbled during transmission br re-requesting them from the server.
		</ol>
	<li> Hiding images speeds up page loading and images can be loaded later.
		<ol type=i>
		<li> Instead of getting the image, a generic icon is displayed: <IMG SRC="no_image.gif">
		<li> Clicking on the icon (not this one though) will bring up the image.
		<li> Clicking the load images button will load all images.
		</ol>
	<li>  Movies.  They are nice, they are huge.
	<li>  Saving multimedia files, if you think of a reason to.
		<ol type=i>
		<li> The whole idea of the web is to ease access to data stored on <STRONG>other</STRONG> people's computers.  What would be some good reasons to store them on yours?  (there are some).
		<li> If the helper application has a save or save as option, use that.  or...
		<li> Temporarily reconfigure Netscape not to use a
helper application and reload the file.  Upon discovering it hasn't
the slightest idea what to do, Netscape will ask you to give the file
a name and save it.  or...
		<li> Configure Netscape to launch an image viewing
program when images are loaded.  Here is a <a href="file://educatn.jpg"><a
href="educatn.jpg">sample image</a></a>
		<li> If the file is an image, load the file into its own Netscape page, and choose File|Save.  
		<li> Actualy, the file is already on your hard drive.  If you can see it on your screen, its sitting somewhere on your computer.  Unfortunately, its a temporary file with a cryptic name.   
		</ol>
	</ol>

<P>
<LI> Returning to places you found interesting.
	<ol type=a>
	<li> After surfing the web for a while, you'll find a slew of stuff you'd like to return to.  How do you get back to a page?
		<ol type=i>
		<li> Write down the URL and type it in.
		<li> Remember the path you took to get there.
		<li> Save the page on local disk.
		<li> <STRONG>Use bookmarks!</STRONG>
		</ol>
	<li> Bookmark basics
		<ol type=i>
		<li> To add a bookmark, select Bookmarks|Add Bookmark
		<li> To jump to a bookmark, select Bookmarks then highlight one and double click on it or select Jump To.
		<li> To remove a bookmark, select Bookmarks|View Bookmarks|Edit then highlight the fated bookmark and click on Remove Item.
		</ol>
	</ol>

<P>
<LI> Advanced Bookmarks.
	<ol type=a>
	<li> Bookmarks can be renamed and edited
		<ol type=i>
		<li> Select Bookmarks|View Bookmarks|Edit
		<li> Highlight the bookmark to be changed.
		<li> Change any of the information in the text boxes on the right half of the window. 
		<li> Of course, changing the URL may not be a good idea.
		<li> The description is for your use only, you can put anything you want in it.
		<li> The name is also just for you.  
		</ol>
	<li> Creating web pages from and exporting the bookmark file.
		<ol type=i>
		<li> After selecting Bookmarks|View Bookmarks|Edit, select Export Bookmarks. 
		<li> Netscape will ask you for a file name.  Enter the filename.
		<li> The bookmark file will be exported as html.  Here's an exported version of <A HREF="http://bookmark.htm">my bookmark file</A>.
		</ol>
	<li> Importing bookmark files.
		<ol type=i>
		<li> After selecting Bookmarks|View Bookmarks|Edit, select Import Bookmarks. 
		<li> Netscape will ask for a file name.  Idealy, this will be the name of file to be imported.  
		<li> The new file will replace the old bookmark file.  
		</ol>
	<li> Creating menus and submenus in your bookmark file
		<ol type=i>
		<li> Choose Bookmarks|View Bookmarks then click Edit
		<li> Highlight a bookmark in your list (with a single click).
		<li> Click the New Header button.  This creates a new
header aptly name "- New Header."  The dash indicates that it
represents a header.
 		<li> Highlight the New Header and rename it by typing
the new name in Name text field.  
		<li> Items under the sub-menu appear under the heading and are indented several spaces.  To put on item in a sub-menu, highlight the item and move it up by clicking the Up button until it appears indented under the right heading.  
		<li> To get an item out of a sub-menu, highlight it and click on down until the item is no longer indented.
		<li> This might sound complicated, but once you do it for real, its actualy pretty easy.  
		</ol>
	</ol>

<p>
<LI> Changing the Default Preferences
	<ol type=a>
	<li> Click on Options|Preferences.
	<li> The format of the dialogue boxes vary from version to version.  But the content is similar	
	<li> At the top of the Preferences dialogue box, there is a pull down menu with several categories for changing things:
	<li> Window and Link Styles
		<ol type=i>
		<li> When you choose Options|Preferences, this is what you start with.
		<li> Specify how to display the toolbar.
		<li> Use Start With: to change your default homepage.  You can either start with a blank page, or enter a URL.
		<li> Changing the link style may make them more readable for you.  Normaly, they are underlined.
		<li> Followed links are displayed in a different color than unexplored linkds.  When followed links expire can be set as well.
		</ol>
	<li> Mail and News
		<ol type=i>
		<li> Netscape can be used to send mail to people using the mailto:user@location URL.  There are several preferences you can set.
		<li> SMTP server shouldn't be changed.  That's the computer that handles your mail.  If it don't work, talk to your system administrator.
		<li> Your name, email address and organization all go in the header for your message.
		<li> Signature file gives the location of a text file to append to the end of each message.  Your signature file shouldn't be more than 5 lines. 
		<li> Netscape can also be used (with some difficulty) to read the news.
		<li> NNTP shouldn't be changed unless you know what your doing.  It gives the name of the computer that will serve news to you.  Problems ? see your system administrator | Leave it alone.
		<li> Newsrc is a file that tells the newsreader which newsgroups you read, which articles you've read etc.  The location should be correct.
		<li> Show articles tells netscape how many articles to show at once.
		</ol>
	<li> Cache and network
		<ol type=i>
		<li> Netscape caches, or temporarily stores, images and information to prevent costly reloading.  Most of this should be left alone.
		<li> You can set the cache size and location.
		<li> Flushing the memory or disk cache though is useful when you are working on a page and want to reload it to see changes and explicitly reloading doesn't get the new version. 
		<li> Network options should be left alone as well.
		<li> Netscape opens more than one connection at a time to load data in paralell, you can set how many connections to open at once.
		</ol>
	<li>Images and Security
		<ol type=i>
		<li> Your computer can only display a finite number of colors on the monitor at one time (with a good graphics card and one megabyte of video RAM though, that number can be 16 million). 
		<li> <A HREF="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/?dither">Dithering</A> is creating additional colors by mixing together pixels of different colors to create the appearance of a new color (sounds like pointalism?).
		<li> You can either have Netscape dither a color for you, or just use the closest available color.  
		<li> Netscape will inform you when you are about to transmit information over an insecure (non-encrypted, not unsure of its self-value) connection.  
		<li> I think its just a big advertisement for their secure server, so I turned 'em all off.
		</ol>
	<li> Applications and Directories
		<ol type=i>
		<li> While Netscape can speak alot of Internet protocals, there are some things it can not do.  When a connection requires a protocal Netscape doesn't know, it uses a supporting application.
		<li> This should be either done by or under consultation from your system administrator.
		<li> In the directories section, you can tell netscape where to keep certain files.
		<li> The Temporary Directory tells Netscape where to put temportary files.
		<li> The Bookmark File is stored at the location given. 
		</ol>
	<li> Helper Applications
		<ol type=i>
		<li> As mentioned before, Netscape uses helper applications to handle most forms of Multimedia.  Setting the information in this dialogue box should be done by your system administrator.
		</ol>
	<li>Proxies
		<ol type=i>
		<li> Most of the time, this information won't matter.  But if you use netscape from behind a firewall, you'll need to fill this form out with the names of the proxies for various applications.  Talk to your system administrator (if you have a firewall, you'll have a system administrator).

Using the mozock.dll file
</center>
<hr>
</H1>

<font size=2>
<center>
This document prepared by <a
href="http://www.engsoc.carleton.ca/~shabby">Mark Dittberner</a> (<i><a 
href="mailto:shabby@engsoc.carleton.ca">shabby@engsoc.carleton.ca</a></i>) 
for the EngSoc UNIX Project. </center>
</font>

<p>
Probably the most frequently asked question about browsers is how do 
I get them to run in stand-alone mode?  Well, here is the answer! So tell 
all your friends that the answer is here!

<p>
The mozock.dll file has been provided by Netscape as a null winsock 
file.  This means that you can use netscape without actually loading 
your winsock package.  This is useful for previewing your pages 
before uploading them to your account. This applies to Windows v3.1, not
too sure if it works with Win95 - if anyone can confirm this - please
let me know and I'll update my pages.

<p>
To use the mozock.dll file, follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Create a directory that you will use to edit your HTML files (ie 
c:\html).  This directory can also contain subdirectories to separate
your HTML files.  Make sure this directory is <strong>NOT</strong> in your 
DOS path and <strong>NOT</strong> your winsock directory.

<li>Put the mozock.dll file into this directory and rename it 
winsock.dll. This is why it has to be in a separate directory, so you 
don't write over the real winsock.dll file.

<p>You can get the mozock.dll file from:<br>
<a href="ftp://ftp.engsoc.carleton.ca/pub/Internet/mozock.zip">here</a> 
if you are loggin in from a Carleton University Campus Server. or<br>
<a href="ftp://ftp1.netscape.com/unsupported/windows/mozock.dll">here</a> at
Netscape's FTS Server (make sure you SHIFT-Click the link - otherwise the 
browser will try to 'show' you the file).

<p>
<li>Create a separate Netscape icon for viewing your HTML files.  This can
be done by highlighting your existing Netscape icon, holding down the CTRL
key and dragging it to a new window. The command line option will 
contain c:\netscape.netscape.exe (or wherever Netcape is located).  The 
working directory will be the HTML directory (ie: c:\html).  So now when 
you start up this particular instance of Netscape, it will first look in 
the c:\html directory for the Winsock and it will find the null winsock.

<li>When netscape first loads it will try to find your normal startup
page (which it won't because that would be on the net).  Simply stop
the search and select Open Local File from the File pull down menu.
Locate the HTML file you wish to preview and voila!  You can also
edit the file at the same time ans when you wish to view the updated
file, simply reload the file in Netscape.

</ol>

<p>
To make things even easier, add a HTML filename at the end of the command
line so it loads that page up first. Like this:

<p>
Command line: c:\netscape\netscape.exe c:\html\startup.htm

<p>
This will load up that page first.

<p>That should be all!

<p>If you have any questions or problems, mail me at <i><a 
href="mailto:shabby@engsoc.carleton.ca">shabby@engsoc.carleton.ca</a></i>.

<H1>The Web </H1>

<H1>Most of the history of the WWW can be explained in terms of
4 letter acronyms.</H1>

<H2>ARPA</H2>

<P>
ARPA is the Advanced Research Project Agency of the department
of defense. They noticed computers were becoming more important
in the command and communication of the military. They thought
it would be a good idea for these computers to communicate in
a reliable, hard to destroy fashion. The result was ARPANET. ARPANET
was a decentralized network--it had no central control that could
be destroyed by enemy forces. Also, ARPANET used packets to send
information back and forth. Because packets can be resent and
redirected, they allowed connections to fail and messages to become
garbled without loosing the ability to communicate. ARPANET turned
out to be a good idea.
<P>
Academia noticed that computers could communicate accross the
country in a reliable fashion and thought that would be a good
way to share information, so they jumped in too. Universities
could get the ARPANET software, connect up and share information
and resources with colleagues around the country. The term <B>Internet</B>
was used to describe the resulting network.
<H2>CERN</H2>

<P>
Things went realy well for a long time. In 1981, there were about
200 computers on the Internet and everyone thought that was just
great. By 1992, there were more than a million computers on the
net. By now, finding something on the net was becoming very, very
hard. Because ARPA needed and created a decentralized network,
there was no central index, message facility, or central anything
about the Internet. If you wanted to find someone, you either
knew someone who knew or found someone who knew and asked them.
<P>
Particle physcisists working at CERN (the European Laboratory
for Partilce Physics) came up with a great idea. Why not give
everything on the Internet a name and save locations along with
information is a way that hid the location from the user? Using
this system, a person could &quot;link&quot; other information
with their information creating a web of information about a topic
that could be accessed without actualy knowing where it came from.
The idea was called the &quot;World Wide Web&quot; and caught
on big.
<H2>HTTP</H2>

<P>
The web runs on the Hyper text transfer protocal (HTTP). HTTP
uses packets on the internet to send mutlimedia back and forth
between computers around the world. HTTP is based on uniform resource
locators (URLs). URLs consist of three major parts: the protocal
name, followed by the host name followed by the name of the file.
In <TT>http://www.davis.k12.ut.us/knowlton/JHarris.html</TT> the
protocal is <TT>http</TT>, the machine name is <TT>www.davis.k12.ut.us</TT>
and the name of the file is <TT>/knowlton/JHarris.html</TT>.
<H2>HTML</H2>

<P>
Pages on the web are described using hyper text markup language
(HTML). HTML is a very simple language understood by browsers
which use the HTTP to get HTML documents, and format the page
based on the HTML. HTML allows web authors to describe how their
page should look in a general way. Instead of saying &quot;display
the word HTML in 16 point times bold black letters&quot;, the
auther simply says, &quot;make HTML a level two header.&quot;
This allows computers with different display capabilities and
users with different style preferences to accomodate a most any
formatting requirment. To my computer &quot;Level 2 header&quot;
might mean 20 point sans serif blue letters underlined in red.
While on your computer it might simply mean display the header
in all-caps.
<P>
The growth of the web has been fast enough that alot of HTML has
been written before anyone realy decided what HTML was going to
be. In the last six months, efforts to standardize HTML have focused
on versions which are more specific, giving authors fine-tuned
control over font size, color and other elements of document layout.
[begin SOAPBOX] HTML though is not a HTLL--hyper text layout language,
its a markup language.[end SOAPBOX]
<H2>UIUC</H2>

<P>
The first web browser was developed at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champagne. It was called Mosaic and worked pretty well
for a product of academia. It wasn't terribly fast, but it worked.
In fact, for several months, people new to the web called it Mosaic--mistaking
the browser for the web. Mosaic was a very, very popular piece
of free software. It ran on several platforms.
<P>
The students who developed Mosaic thought they could do a better
job of a web browser and make a great deal of money in the process.
So they did. They formed a new company, worked out some legal
kinks with UIUC and developed a browser called Netscape. In the
finest Internet tradition, the Netscape browser is free to students,
non-profit employees and anyone else not making money for using
it. So how do they make money? By selling the software that serves
HTML documents. While UIUC still has a free server, Netscape's
server has several advantages in commerce applications (and costs
a cool $2,000 or so). Netscape's server allows secure communication
of important things like credit card numbers. Netscape is a very,
very popular piece of software. It rendered Mosaic obsolete in
the space of about three weeks.<HR>

<OL>
<LI>The problem is part of the solution.
<OL>
<LI>The internet is very decentralized, this prevents both catastrophic
breakdowns when a key resource fails and prevents good indexing
and catalogueing.
<LI>There is a great deal of information on the web, you can find
something about anything. This also makes it difficult to find
anything.
<LI>Anyone can put information on the web, this allows a wide
variety of opinions and sources. Unfortunately, not everyone is
an expert in the field about which they write.
<LI>People decided that search programs would be a good idea,
and they are. Unfortunately, everyone knows that and a good search
program is always busy.
</OL>

<LI>Jumping to a web search program.
<OL>
<LI>The people at netscape thought it would be a good idea to
put together a page that contains links to various web search
programs.
<LI>The search page is found under Directory|Internet Search.
<LI>For some reason, Netscape thinks InfoSeek makes a good WWW
search engine. It probly does, but you have to be a subscriber.
Being a subscriber is not free.
<LI>The second engine on the page is Lycos. Lycos is a good thing.
Its free, comprehensive and easy to use. Its also always busy.
</OL>

<LI><A HREF="http://lycos.cs.cmu.edu/">Lycos</A> 
<OL>
<LI>Becuase Lycos indexes everything, it will almost always return
something for a given search term.
<LI>for popular topics, Lycos will return hundreds of connections.

<LI>Lycos seems to be best for obscure searches.

<LI>Yahoo is a huge (32,000+) database of WWW pages organized
by topic.
<LI>To find something in Yahoo, either use the search engine or
work through the categories.
<LI>If you know what you want, the search will work great. Since
the search program matches any word in the description, you may
get a page of unreleated links with the one you wanted tucked
in somewhere.
<LI>Working through the categories gives you a good sense of what's
available on your topic and may get you sidetracked for several
minutes (hours?) before finding your information.

advertize.
<LI>Its also easy to intercept and copy a credit card number being
transmitted accross the Internet.
<LI>Right now, this is probly not a problem. There's lots and
lots of information flying by on wires across the nation right
now. Very, very few of them contain credit card numbers.
<LI>As more companies and consumers get connected on the Internet,
more credit card numbers will be transmitted, and criminals will
become more tempted.
</OL>

<LI>Solution #1: Use the Netscape Server and Client
<OL>
<LI>The Netscape Commerce server and Netscape client can scramle
and descramble all messages sent back and forth to each other.
<LI>While this is the best solution, it has one fatal drawback:
not everyone (hardly anyone) uses the Netscape server.
</OL>

<LI>Solution #2: Other encryption methods
<OL>
<LI>Send the credit card number (or other secure information)
in several packets. FInding one packet is hard, finding two is
even harder.
<LI>Use an encrypted telnet session.
<LI>Give the bussiness your credit card number for them to keep

<LI>Use the phone!

<LI>Solution #3: Don't worry about it

<H2>HTML Basics</H2>

<UL>
<LI>HTML documents are plain ASCII text. You can use notepad,
vi, emacs or any other text editor/word processor that will save
in an ASCII format
<LI>There are also several WYSIWYG HTML editors available for
various platforms. We'll learn the basics of <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers/World_Wide_Web/HTML_Editors/MS_Windows/HTML_Assistant/">HTML Assistant</A>.
Additionally, some text editors such as MS Word, have HTML templates,
converters or other such useful things.
<LI>HTML documents are described using HTML <EM>tags</EM>. Tags
have four basic elements:
<UL>
<LI>A left angle bracket (less than sign): &lt;
<LI>Followed by the name of the tag (such as LI or OL)
<LI>Ending with the right angle bracket (greater than sign): &gt;
<LI><EM>Some</EM> tags come in pairs. The starting tag will generally
look like &lt;H1&gt;, the ending tag will be the same--with the
addition of a slash &quot;/&quot; like so, &lt;/H1&gt;.
</UL>

<LI>HTML is <EM>not</EM> case sensitive.
</UL>
<HR>

<H2>Basic Markup Tags</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Title Tag: &lt; <CODE>TITLE</CODE>&gt;your title here&lt;<CODE>/TITLE</CODE>&gt;
<LI>Effect: Displayed separately from the document itself. Usually
in the title bar, used as title for bookmark.
<LI>Use: Think of a few words to describe your document, and make
them the title.
<LI>Example: The title of this document is &quot;Writing HTML&quot;
<LI>Headings Tag: &lt;<CODE>H</CODE><VAR>y</VAR>&gt;Your Heading
Here &lt;<CODE>/H</CODE><VAR>y</VAR>&gt; where y is a heading
level between 1 and 6. Major headings are level 1 headings.
<LI>Effect: Displayed in a larger font, usually in bold.
<LI>Use: Headings separate the document into logical sections.
Usually the first level 1 heading and the title are the same thing.
<LI>Example: &quot;Basic Markup Tags&quot; is a level two heading.
<LI>Paragraphs Tag: &lt;<CODE>P</CODE>&gt;
<LI>Effect: Inserts a line break and blank line.
<LI>Use: HTML ignores Carriage returns and squishes lines of spaces
into one space. The paragraph tags separates them.
<LI>Example This line and the next line are separated by a paragraph
tag<BR>
but are on the same line in the HTML file.
<LI>Links Tag: &lt;<CODE>A HREF=&quot;</CODE><VAR>filename/URL</VAR><CODE>&quot;</CODE>&gt;text
for your link here &lt;<CODE>/A</CODE>&gt;. where <VAR>filename/URL</VAR>
is the absolute or relative URL for the file you are linking to.
Absolute paths list out the entire path to the document, including
the machine address. Relative paths give the path from the directory
containing the current document.
<LI>Effect: text for the link appears underlined and/or in a different
color. Clicking on the text will take the user to the linked document.
<LI>Use: Link your stuff in with other stuff, such as other sources
of information or further explanation of a difficult concept.
<LI>Example: This is a <A href="http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/whyfm.html">link to an example</A>
of using links to explain new words or concepts.
<LI>Horizontal Rules Tag: &lt;<CODE>HR</CODE>&gt;
<LI>Effect: draws a horizontal line across the window.
<LI>Use: a visual way to separate sections
<LI>Example: A horizontal rule follows to separate this section
from the next:
</UL>

<P>
<HR>

<H2>Lists</H2>

<P>
HTML supports unordered, ordered and dictionary lists.
<H3>Unordered Lists</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Start with a &lt;<CODE>UL</CODE>&gt; tag.
<LI>Put an &lt;<CODE>LI</CODE>&gt; tag in front of each item in
the list
<LI>End the list with &lt;<CODE>/UL</CODE>&gt;
</OL>

<P>
Other HTML tags can be nested inside the text in an &lt;<CODE>LI</CODE>&gt;
item.
<H3>Ordered Lists</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Start with a &lt;<CODE>OL</CODE>&gt; tag.
<LI>Put an &lt;<CODE>LI</CODE>&gt; tag in front of each item in
the list
<LI>End the list with &lt;<CODE>/OL</CODE>&gt;
</OL>

<P>
You don't have to type the numbers in an ordered list, they are
inserted automatically. Like unnumbered lists, the body of an
item in a numbered list can contain other HTML tags.
<H3>Dictionary Lists</H3>

<P>
Dictionary lists look like glossaries when displayed. There are
four tags in dictionary lists:
<OL>
<LI>Start with a &lt;DL&gt; tag
<LI>Each element of the list has two parts, the first is tagged
with a &lt;DT&gt; dictionary term tag.
<LI>Then delimit the definition with the &lt; DD&gt; dictionary
definition tag. Other lists or HTML tags can be nested within
the body of the &lt; DD&gt;.
<LI>After defining all the terms, close with &lt;/DL&gt;
</OL>

<P>
The section titled &quot;Basic Markup Tags&quot; in this page
is an example of a Dictionary List. <HR>

<H2>Images and Other HTML Tags</H2>

<H3>Images</H3>

<P>
Images work a lot like links. The basic format is the same, the
format looks like
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&lt; <CODE>IMG SRC = </CODE><VAR>image_URL</VAR> &gt; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<VAR>image_URL</VAR> is the URL for the image, it has the exact
same format as for HREF tags. The image should be in GIF format.
Netscape can display GIFs and JPEGs inline, but not all browsers
can.
<P>
Images can also include an align code, the format looks just the
same with one addition:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&lt; <CODE>IMG ALIGN=</CODE><VAR>position</VAR><CODE> SRC = </CODE><VAR>image_URL</VAR>
&gt; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
where <VAR>position</VAR> is one of <CODE>center, top, bottom</CODE>.
<P>
<IMG src="snowshoe.gif"> The default is <CODE>bottom</CODE>
<P>
<IMG align=top src="snowshoe.gif"> This is <CODE>align=top</CODE>
<P>
<IMG align = middle src="snowshoe.gif"> This is <CODE>align=middle</CODE>

<H3>Text Formatting Commands</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Preformatted text Tag: &lt;PRE&amp;rt;&lt;/PRE;&gt;
<LI>Effect: Text is displayed just like you typed it. Spaces,
tabs, and carriage returns are significant (usually, they are
ignored).
<LI>Use: when you've already got the text formatted, and you don't
want WWW browsers messing with it.
<LI>Example: Here's an example of using preformatted text to fake
a <A href="http://lal.cs.byu.edu/cs330/syllabus.html">class syllabus</A>.
<LI>Extended Quotations Tag: &lt;<CODE>BLOCKQUOTE</CODE>&gt;&lt;<CODE>/BLOCKQUOTE</CODE>&gt;
<LI>Effect: Indented just like an extended quote should be.
<LI>Use: When you have a long quote that needs to be indented.
<LI>Example: Here's an extended quote from the <A href="http://io.datasys.swri.edu/Lost.html">Getting Lost</A>
page.
<LI>First, do *nothing*. Sit down, take it easy, try to calm down.
Look at the pretty scenery. Maybe you'll notice something you
recognize. (However don't be hasty about &quot;recognizing&quot;
landmarks. Remember you may want to see something familiar so
badly that you don't notice that it isn't really what you want
it to be.) Of course if the weather is nasty you may need to start
seeking shelter. If this is the case try to either find or build
shelter quickly and close by. If you are in a group discuss the
situation and try to keep everybody calm (especially yourself).
Try to keep the group together unless there is a *compelling*
reason to split up. And no, disagreement over what to do is not
a compelling reason to split up. <BR>
Notice how the text was indented.
<LI>Addresses Tag: &lt;<CODE>ADDRESS</CODE>&gt;&lt;<CODE>/ADDRESS</CODE>&gt;
<LI>Effect: Most browsers (all?) put the text in italics.
<LI>Use: When you want to set apart the address or name of an
author, source or etc.
<LI>Example: At the bottom of this page, my name and the updated
date are in an address field.
</UL>

<P>

<H3>Character Formatting</H3>

<P>
There are physical and logical styles. Logical styles describe
the meaning of your text and the browser decides how to display
the text. Logical styles separate meaning from display, this allows
flexibility in displays. Physical styles tell the browsers exactly
how to display the text without making any mention of what the
text means. Use logical styles whenever possible.
<P>
Logical Styles: there are many more than what's listed here. See
the styles pull down menu in HTML assistant for more. These are
just the common ones:
<DL>
<DT>&lt;<CODE><B>DFN</B></CODE>&gt;
<DD>defining a term
<DT>&lt;<CODE><B>EM</B></CODE>&gt;
<DD>emphasizing a word or phrase.
<DT>&lt;<CODE><B>CODE</B></CODE>&gt;
<DD>code from a computer program.
<DT>&lt;<CODE><B>STRONG</B></CODE>&gt;
<DD>make a word or phrase appear strong.
</DL>

<P>
Physical Styles: there's only three:
<DL>
<DT>&lt;<CODE><B>B</B></CODE>&gt;
<DD>bold
<DT>&lt;<CODE><B>I</B></CODE>&gt;
<DD>italic
<DT>&lt;<CODE><B>TT</B></CODE>&gt;
<DD>typewriter text (fixed width).
</DL>

<P>
Using any of the logical or physical styles has the same format,
it looks like:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&lt;<VAR>tag</VAR>&gt; the text to which to apply the style. &lt;/<VAR>tag</VAR>&gt;

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Where <VAR>tag</VAR> is one of the codes mentioned above. <HR>

This site is still underconstruction, but if you'd like, you can look at the <A HREF="paper.html">school newspaper</A>, see the weekly <A HREF="lunch.html">lunch menu</A> or browse through the <A HREF="project.html">Civil War Project</A>, written and designed by<A HREF="putnam.html">Mrs. Putnam's American History Class</a>.<p></body></html><hr size=3><P>HTML uses what are known as markup tags to let the Web browser know howto display the document. Tags are always surrounded by brackets (&lt; and&gt;). For example, the <CODE>&lt;TITLE&gt;</CODE> tag specifies the title of a document.(Note: HTML is not case sensitive, so you could also use <CODE>&lt;title&gt;</CODE>instead of <CODE>&lt;TITLE></CODE>.) You will also notice its corresponding tag,<CODE>&lt;/TITLE&gt;</CODE>, includes a slash (/) before the word TITLE. In HTML, slashesare used to note the end of a command (in this case, the end of a title).If you look through the above example, you'll see that nearly every taghas a corresponding tag which includes the slash. The only tag here thatdoes not is the paragraph tag, which appears as <CODE>&lt;P&gt;</CODE>. The <CODE>&lt;P&gt;</CODE> tag is usedto connote the end of a paragraph, so only one tag is needed. The othertags used within this document will be explained further in the tutorial.<H2>The Basic Tags</H2><h3>Title Tags (<code>&lt;TITLE&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/TITLE&gt;</code>)</h3><P>Every HTML document should have a title. Titles appear at the top andcenter of a Web browser's open screen. Your title should be somewhatdescriptive - that is, descriptive enough for other people to know what'son that page just by looking at the title. For example, <CITE>George WashingtonMiddle School Home Page</CITE> would be a lot more useful as a title than <cite>SchoolPage</cite>.<h3>Headings (<CODE>&lt;Hx&gt;</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;/Hx&gt;</CODE>)</h3><P>Headings serve as headlines for a document. It is customary for a Webpage to have a heading at the top of each page. There are six levels ofheadings, numbered 1 through 6, with 1 being the largest and the boldest.In general, the first heading in each document should be tagged <CODE>&lt;H1&gt;</CODE>. Thesyntax of the heading tag is:<P><CODE>&lt;Hx&gt;Here is My Heading&lt;/Hx&gt;</CODE><P>The x in the tags must be a number, 1 through 6. So, if you used theheading <CODE>&lt;H1&gt;</CODE>, it would appear as<hr><blockquote><H1>Here is My Heading</H1></blockquote><hr><P>If, however, you used <CODE>&lt;H3&gt;</CODE> instead, you'd get something like<hr><blockquote><H3>Here is My Heading</H3></blockquote><hr><P>In many documents, the first heading is identical to the title. Forlarger documents, subheadings such as <CODE>&lt;H3&gt;</CODE> would be used within thedocument to designate the start of a new subject. Additionally, headings,1, 2 and 3 are by far the most common, for 4, 5, and 6 can appear sosmall that they are a distraction to the reader.<H3>Paragraph Tags </H3><P>Unlike many other text documents, HTML files do not recognize carriagereturns. So, if you had an HTML document that looked like<code><P>Welcome to our School Home Page.<br>This site is under construction.</code><P>it would appear as this on a Web browser:<blockquote><P>Welcome to our School Home Page. This site is under construction.</blockquote><P>In order for the computer to recognize the end of a line in HTML, youmust include a paragaph tag, or <CODE>&lt;P&gt;</CODE>. This tag will end a paragraph foryou and add a small amount of space before the next paragaph. It is veryimportant that you use <CODE>&lt;P&lt;</CODE> tags when you wish to end a paragraph -otherwise, your document will appear as one gigantic paragraph.  It should be noted that some coders of HTML documents prefer to place the &lt;P&gt; tag before each paragraph rather than at the end.<P>So, let's try our HTML document again, this time with paragraph tags.<PRE><CODE>Welcome to our School Home Page.&lt;P&gt;This site is under construction.&lt;P&gt;</CODE></PRE><P>This time, our result appears as<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Welcome to our School Home Page.<P>This site is under construction.</BLOCKQUOTE><h3>Line Break Tags &lt;br&gt;</h3><P>In many cases, you'll want to end a line of some text, but you won't wantto leave the amount of space below it that the paragraph tag leaves. Inthese situations, you can use the line break tag, or &lt;br&gt;. Here's ourexample:<P><code>Welcome to our School Home Page. &lt;br&gt; This site is under construction.&lt;p&gt;</code><P>We've inserted a line break tag in the middle of the document. What wenow get is this:<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Welcome to our School Home Page.<br>This site is under construction.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>If you compare this to the above example which used the paragraph tag,you'll see that our line break tag does not leave the same amount ofspace.<h3>Stylized Text Formatting</h3><P>HTML allows you to present text in certain styles to add depth andmeaning to the presentation. Words can be italicized and bolded, forexample. In HTML, text format tags fall into two catagories, logical andphysical. Logical tags focus on the actual use of the formatting, such asciting a source or emphasizing a point. Physical tags, on the other hand,are more literal, and they tell the computer to recognize the text asspecifically underlined, bold, or some other different style. As ageneral rule, most Web designers try to use <em>logical</em> tags more thanphysical tags, for as Web software becomes more advanced, they'll be ableto give more utility to a tag that isn't as specific as one which onlyknows how to make text into italics or whatnot. But that's not to saythere's anything wrong with physical tags - they're easier to remember thanlogical tags. All style tags are used the same way - place a starting tag(without the slash) before the desired text, and a closing tag (with theslash) at the end of the text.<P>Confused? Don't worry, it's not that important. In any case, here is alist of the common physical and logical tags.<h4>Physical Styles</h4><UL><LI>&lt;B&gt; and &lt;/B&gt; are used to <b>bolden</b> text.<LI>&lt;I&gt; and &lt;/I&gt; are used to <i>italicize</i> text.<LI>&lt;TT&gt; and &lt;/TT&gt; will give you <tt>typewriter, or fixed-width</tt>, text.</ul><h4>Logical Styles</h4><DL><DT>&lt;DFN&gt; and &lt;/DFN&gt;<DD>Used for a word being defined. Usually appears as italics. Example: <DFN>Lynxis a text-based Web browser</DFN>.<P><DT>&lt;EM&gt; and &lt;/EM&gt;<DD>Used for emphasis. Usually appears as italics. Example: <EM>If you like theRolling Stones, visit their web page at http://stones.com</EM>.<P><DT>&lt;CITE&gt; and &lt;/CITE&gt;<DD>Used for citing books, movies, etc. Usually appears as italics. Example:Howard Gardner discusses Multiple Intelligences theory in <CITE>Frames of Mind</CITE>.<P><DT>&lt;CODE&gt; and &lt;/CODE&gt;<DD>Used for presenting computer code. Appears as a fixed-width font.Example: <CODE>10 if x=y then go to 40</CODE><P><DT>&lt;KBD&gt; and &lt;/KBD&gt;<DD>Used for user keyboard entry. Usually appears as either a boldfixed-width font. Example: To get the manual on the listserv, type in <KBD>manlistproc</KBD>.<P><DT>&lt;STRONG&gt; and &lt;/STRONG&gt;<DD>Used for strong emphasis. Usually appears as bold. Example: <strong>If you haveany problems, please contact the Webmaster</strong>!<P><DT>&lt;VAR&gt; and &lt;/VAR&gt;<DD>Used to represent variables - i.e, something the user must replace withtheir own information. Usually appears as italics. Example: <var>REVIEWLISTNAME</var> will list the users subscribed to a given listserv.</DL><H3>Special Characters (Escape Sequences)</h3><P>Four characters of the ASCII character set - the left angle bracket (&lt;),the right angle bracket (&gt;), the ampersand (&) and the double quote (") -are used in HTML to represent certain aspects of markup tags. Because ofthis, they cannot be used as part of a text document without a little bitof assistance. Additionally, accent marks and other less commoncharacters can not appear without special help. Instead, you representthese characters with codes known as escape sequences, which must beincluded in the usual brackets for them to be recognized. Some of themore common codes:<UL><li><code>&amp;lt;</code>  is the escape sequence for &lt;<li><code>&amp;gt;</code>  is the escape sequence for ><li><code>&amp;amp;</code>  is the escape sequence for &<li><code>&amp;quot;</code>  is the escape sequence for "<li><code>&amp;ouml;</code>  is the escape sequence for &ouml;:  a lowercase o with an umlaut:<li><code>&amp;ntilde;</code>  is the escape sequence for &ntilde;:  a lowercase n with an tilde:<li><code>&amp;Egrave;</code>  is the escape sequence for &Egrave;:  an uppercase E with a grave accent:i</ul><P>A full list of supported characters can be found at <A HREF="http://www.w3.org">http://www.w3.org</A>.<h3>Horizontal Rules</h3><P>The &lt;HR&gt; tag produces a horizontal line the width of the browser window.<h3>Linking to Other Documents &lt;A HREF&gt;</h3><P>Perhaps the best aspect of writing in HTML is its ability to link text toother texts, which as a document is known as hypertext. HTML uses ananchor tag, or &lt;A&gt;, to link documents together. Every anchor tag includesthe following elements:<UL><li>the anchor<li>the file to which it should connect<li>the text which it will be used as the "link"<li>the closing anchor</UL><P>Sound complicated? In practice, it really isn't. Here's a typical anchor tag:<P><code>&lt;A HREF="http://k12.cnidr.org:90"&gt;The EdWeb Home Page&lt;/A&gt;</code><P>As you can see, the tag begins with an &lt;A, the basic element of everyanchor tag. After a single space, the &lt;A is followed byHREF="http://k12.cnidr.org:90"&gt;. The HREF=" section tells the computerthat this tag will link the document to another document. The next set ofinformation, http://k12.cnidr.org:90"&gt;, is the name of the document towhich it should connect, which in this case is a Web page atk12.cnidr.org:90. Addresses such as these are often called UniformResource Locators, or URL's. The "&gt; at the end of the address simplytells the computer that the address is over.<P>Next, we have some text which says <tt>The EdWeb Home Page</tt>. This is theinformation that will actually appear on the screen. The information isknown as a link, for when you select it in your Web browser by clickingit with a mouse or moving your cursor on top of it, it will connect youto the address (in this case, <code>http://k12.cnidr.org:90</code>). Finally, &lt;/A&gt; isadded at the end of the tag to tell the computer that the tag is complete.<P>While the anchor and the closing anchor in this kind of tag remainconstant, the other two pieces, the URL and the link, are adjustable.URLs can include practically any file on the internet, such as a website, a gopher, even an email address, though most commonly you will linkyour documents to web sites. Here are some major examples of differenttypes of URLs as they would appear within an anchor:<P><pre>A link to the <a href="http://stones.com">Stones Web Page</a>           &lt;A HREF="http://stones.com"&gt;A link to a file in the same folder     &lt;A HREF="homepage.html"&gt;A link to the <a href="gopher://digital.cosn.org">CoSN Gopher</a>               &lt;A HREF="gopher://digital.cosn.org"&gt;A link to a <a href="news:k12.chat.teacher">newsgroup</a>                    &lt;A HREF="news:k12.chat.teacher"&gt;A link to an <a href="telnet://capaccess.org">outside network</a>             &lt;A HREF="telnet://capaccess.org"&gt;To mail a message to <a href="mailto:acarvin@k12.cnidr.org">my email</a>            &lt;A HREF="mailto:acarvin@k12.cnidr.org"&gt;To copy the software, <a href="ftp://mcom.com/netscape">Netscape</a>           &lt;A HREF="ftp://mcom.com/netscape"&gt;</pre><P>As you can see at the beginning of each URL, the anchor includes a basiccode to designate what type of link is to be created. To transfer a file,the code is <code>ftp://</code>, and to access a gopher, it's <code>gopher://</code>. The onlyanchor which isn't as obvious is <code>http://</code>, which links you to a Web page.HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, which is the technical namefor the method of connecting to a Web page. As for the second example -the link to a file in the same folder - it's used when you are creatingmultiple documents for your Web site. If the other file is located in thesame folder directory on your computer, all you have to do is include thename of the file, which in this case is called <code>homepage.html</code>.<P>If, however, the file is located in a different folder on your computer,you'll have to specify the entire URL for the computer to follow thepath. Let's say you have a file in a folder called <code>my.home.page</code>, and youwanted to connect it to your friend Jane's home page, which happens to bein another folder called jane.folder on the same computer, which iscalled my.computer.com. You'd have to write the anchor as if you werelinking it to another computer, so your anchor might look like this:<P><code>&lt;A HREF="http://my.computer.com/jane.folder/jane.homepage.html"&gt;</code><P>When the computer looks up this link, it connects to the computer,<code>my.computer.com</code>, and then goes the folder jane.folder, which it knows todo because <code>jane.folder</code> is preceded by a slash (/) in the address (Note:slashes are used to designate the opening of a file within a folder, andbecause you may place a file within several layers of folders, the lengthof the address and the number of slashes may be quite large). Thecomputer then sees another slash right before <code>jane.homepage.html</code>, thename of Jane's Web file. The computer opens <code>jane.homepage.html</code> and thenpresents it on the screen.<P>Of course, if you want your Web users to know where a certain link goes,you'll have to provide them some information about the link. Let's lookagain at our example:<P>&lt;A HREF="http://k12.cnidr.org:90"&gt;The EdWeb Home Page&lt;/A&gt;<P>In the space between the anchor itself and the closing tag, we have thewords <code>The EdWeb Home Page</code>. That's the link. When you open a Web documentwith this example in it, this is what you'd see:<P><a href="http://k12.cnidr.org:90">The EdWeb Home Page</a><P>And that's it. The rest of the information is hidden away, but thecomputer still knows it's there. So, if you moved your mouse or cursor tothe link and selected it, the computer would look up the URL that islisted within the anchor and bring you to it.<h3>Using Anchors Within a Single Document</h3><P>Sometimes when you're desigining a Web page with lots of information, itcan be handy to make links within the document to other points in thetext. For example, if you're putting together an on-line dictionary andone of your definitions is<DL><DT>Lynx<DD>A browsing program used to access the World Wide Web.</DL><P>That's all well and good, but what if the reader has no idea what theWorld Wide Web is? You'll want to be able to connect them to thatinformation, and since our dictionary is in the form of one long file,we'll have to make a link to a definition further down within thedocument.  To do this, you need to add an anchor to the words "The WorldWide Web" in your new definition, using a new tag called &lt;A NAME&gt;:<P>&lt;A NAME="web"&gt;The World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt;<P>And within your definition for <em>Lynx</em>, you'll also have to add a link to"World Wide Web" so the computer knows to bring you to its definition. Inthis case, you would use a tag that is fairly similar to a typical anchortag:<P><code>        A browsing program used to access the &lt;A HREF="#web"&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt;.</code><P>The words <em>World Wide Web</em> are now a link to web, which you've just definedin the <A NAME> tag. The hash mark (i.e., the #) tells the computer it'slooking for a link within a document.<P>Finally, let's say you have a really, really big dictionary, and theletters T through Z are actually in a totally separate file called<em>dic.t-z.html</em>. You'd have to let the computer know that it needs to jumpto a different file as well as go down to the definition for World WideWeb. Well, you'd use the same <code>&lt;A HREF&gt;</code> tag as you did above, with one newtwist:<P><code>        A browsing program used to access the &lt;AHREF="dic.t-z.html#web"&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt;.</code><P>Preceding the hash mark we've added the name of the file, <em>dic.t-z.html</em>.Now the computer knows to go to that file first before looking for thelink.<h2>Intermediate HTML Design</h2><P>So far, we've covered the basics of HTML. With this information, youshould be able to design some simple, but very effective, web documents.In the next section, we'll cover other markups which will help you jazzup your efforts.<h3>Unnumbered Lists &lt;UL&gt;</h3><P>Very often in Web design, you'll find yourself needing to make a list ofitems. Of course, you could always add a line break tag &lt;BR&gt; or aparagraph tag &lt;P&gt; to separate each item, but often that won't look verygood. To help you out, HTML recognizes a tag that will let you createlists which include a bullet before each item. For example, if you wantedto create a list like this:<P><UL><LI> Eenie<LI> Meanie<LI> Miney<LI> Mo</UL><P>You would use the unnumbered list tag, or <code>&lt;UL&gt;</code>. Additionally, each itemin the list would include a list item tag, or <code>&lt;LI&gt;</code>. So to make our list,we'd type the following:<P><code>&lt;UL&gt;<br>&lt;LI&gt; Eenie<br>&lt;LI&gt; Meanie<br>&lt;LI&gt; Miney<br>&lt;LI&gt; Mo<br>&lt;/UL&gt;</code><P>And make sure you include the closing tag, <code>&lt;/UL&gt;</code>, or you might reallyconfuse the computer. Otherwise, these tags should give you a nicelooking bulleted list.<h3>Numbered Lists</h3><P>Sometimes instead of an unnumbered list, you'll want to list some itemsthat are numbered. Another tag, <code>&lt;OL&gt;</code> will create an ordered list thatautomatically includes the numbers. It's very similar to a <code>&lt;UL&gt;</code> list, theonly difference being in the opening and closing tags. Let's try this:<P><code>&lt;OL&gt;<br>&lt;LI&gt; Eenie<br>&lt;LI&gt; Meanie<br>&lt;LI&gt; Miney<br>&lt;LI&gt; Mo<br>&lt;/OL&gt;</code><P>When you look at this on the Web, the list appears as<P><OL><LI> Eenie<LI> Meanie<LI> Miney<LI> Mo</OL><P>Ordered list tags are really handy when you want to number your list andplan to add items to the list every now and then. This way, your listwill remain numbered and you won't have to retype the numbers each timeyou make a change.<h3>Definition Lists &lt;DL&gt;</h3><P>A definition list usually consists of a tag for the term, <code>&lt;DL&gt;</code>, and a tagfor the definition, <code>&lt;DD&gt;</code>. <code>&lt;DL&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/DL&gt;</code> tags are needed at the beginningand end of the list.<P>Let's use one of our previous examples.<P><code>    <br>&lt;DL>    <br>&lt;DT&gt;Lynx    <br>&lt;DD&gt;A browsing program used to access the World Wide Web.    <br>&lt;/DL&gt;</code><P>The output would look like:<DL><DT>Lynx<DD>A browsing program used to access the World Wide Web.</DL><P>Of course, most definition lists would include more than one item, as inthe above example, but the rules remain the same - precede each term witha <code>&lt;DT></code>, each definition with a <code>&lt;DD></code>, and a <code>&lt;/DL></code> at the end, and yourlist will work quite nicely.<P>The <code>&lt;DT></code> and <code>&lt;DD></code> entries can contain multiple paragraphs (separated by<code>&lt;P></code> paragraph tags), lists, or other definition information.<h3>Extended Quotations and the &lt;BLOCKQUOTE> Tag</h3><P>Sometimes when you're designing a Web page you'll have a quote you wishto highlight within the text. The <code>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE></code> tag is used toautomatically indent and separate the quote from the rest of the text.For example:<P>My favorite passage in Henry V is<P><code>&lt;blockquote><br>I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,&lt;br><br>Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:&lt;br><br>Follow your spirit, and upon this charge,&lt;br><br>Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'&lt;<br>/blockquote><P>&lt;P>Though I think the St. Crispan's speech is pretty good, too.</code><P>The result is:<P>My favorite passage in Henry V is<P><blockquote>I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,<br>Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:<br>Follow your spirit, and upon this charge,<br>Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'</blockquote><P>Though I think the St. Crispan's speech is pretty good, too.<P>The <code>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE></code> tag distinguishes the quote from the other text. In thiscase, we've also used a few line break tags, <code>&lt;BR>'s</code>, to split up eachline. If the tags hadn't been included, it would look like this:<P>My favorite passage in Henry V is<blockquote>I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, Straining upon the start.The game's afoot: Follow your spirit, and upon this charge, Cry 'God forHarry, England, and Saint George!'</blockquote><P>Though I think the St. Crispan's speech is pretty good, too.<h3>Addresses</h3><P>The <code>&lt;ADDRESS></code> tag is generally used at the bottom of a document toacknowledge the author and how to contact him or her. For example, youmight try the following at the end of your page:<P><code>&lt;ADDRESS><br>GW Middle School Home Page / Anytown, USA / webmaster@gwms.edu<br>&lt;/ADDRESS></code><P>With that, you'd get this as a result:<p><address>GW Middle School Home Page / Anytown, USA / webmaster@gwms.edu</address><P>The <code>&lt;ADDRESS></code> tag highlights the text, usually by italicizing it. Thereare other methods of highlighting text (which will be covered in the nextsection), but in future Web browsers, the <code>&lt;ADDRESS></code> tag may take on otheruses, such as an automatic email response form or something of the like.<h3>In-line Images</h3><P>Most Web browsers can display in-line images (that is, images next totext) that are in X Bitmap (XBM) or GIF format. Each image takes time toprocess and slows down the initial display of the document, so generallyyou should not include too many or overly large images.<P>To include an in-line image, use<code>&lt;IMG SRC=image_URL></code> where image_URL  is the address of the image file. The syntax for IMG SRCURLs is identical to that used in an anchor HREF. If the image file is aGIF file, then the filename part of image_URL  must end with <code>.gif</code>.Filenames of X Bitmap images must end with <code>.xbm</code>.<P><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="button.gif">By default the bottom of an image is aligned with the text as shown inthis paragraph.<P><IMG ALIGN=top SRC="button.gif">You can add alignment commands such as <code>ALIGN=TOP</code> if you want the browserto align adjacent text with the top of the image as shown in thisparagraph. The full in-line image tag with the top alignment is:<br><code>&lt;IMG ALIGN=top SRC="button.gif"></code><P><IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="button.gif"><code>ALIGN=MIDDLE</code> aligns the text with the center of the image.<h4>Alternate Text for Browsers That Can't Display Images</h4><P>Some World Wide Web browsers, primarily those that run on VT100terminals, cannot display images. The <code>ALT</code> option allows you to specifytext to be displayed when an image cannot be. For example:<P>    <code>&lt;IMG SRC = "UpArrow.gif" ALT = "Up"></code><P>where <code>UpArrow.gif</code> is the picture of an upward pointing arrow. With NCSAMosaic and other graphics-capable viewers, the user sees the up arrowgraphic. With a VT100 browser, such as <em>Lynx</em>, the user sees the word"Up."<h3>External Images, Sounds, and Animations</h3><P>You may want to have an image open as a separate document when a useractivates a link on either a word or a smaller, in-line version of theimage included in your document. This is considered an external image andis useful if you do not wish to slow down the loading of the maindocument with large in-line images.<P>To include a reference to an external image, use<code>&lt;A HREF = image_URL >link anchor&lt;/A></code><P>The same syntax is used for links to external animations and sounds. Theonly difference is the file extension of the linked file. For example,<blockquote><code>&lt;A HREF = "QuickTimeMovie.mov">link anchor&lt;/A></code></blockquote><P>specifies a link to a <em>QuickTime</em> movie. Some common file types and theirextensions are:<pre><strong>File Type  			Extension</strong>Plain text          .txtHTML document       .htmlGIF image           .gifTIFF image          .tiffXBM bitmap image    .xbmJPEG image          .jpg or .jpegPostScript file     .psAIFF sound          .aiffAU sound            .auQuickTime movie     .movMPEG movie          .mpeg or .mpg</pre><P>Make sure your intended audience has the necessary viewers. Most UNIXworkstations, for instance, cannot view QuickTime movies.<h2>A Longer Example</h2><P>Here is a longer example of an HTML document:<P>&lt;HEAD>&lt;TITLE&gt;GWMS Home Page&lt;/TITLE&gt;<P>    &lt;TITLE&gt;A Longer Example&lt;/TITLE&gt;<P>    &lt;/HEAD&gt;<P>    &lt;BODY&gt;<P>    &lt;H1&gt;A Longer Example&lt;/H1&gt;<P>    This is a simple HTML document. This is the first    paragraph. &lt;P&gt;<P>    This is the second paragraph, which shows special effects.  This is a    word in &lt;I&gt;italics&lt;/I&gt;.  This is a word in &lt;B&gt;bold&lt;/B&gt;.&lt;P&gt;<P>    Here is an in-lined GIF image: &lt;IMG SRC = "barney3.gif"&gt;.<P>    &lt;P&gt;<P>    This is the third paragraph, which demonstrates links.  Here is    a hypertext link from the word &lt;A HREF = "andy.html"&gt;foo&lt;/A&gt;    to Andy's Home Page.<P>&lt;P&gt;    &lt;H2&gt;A second-level header&lt;/H2&gt;<P>    Here is a section of text that should display as a    fixed-width font: &lt;P&gt;<P>    &lt;PRE&gt;<P>        On the stiff twig up there<P>        Hunches a wet black rook<P>        Arranging and rearranging its feathers in the rain ...<P>    &lt;/PRE&gt;<P>    This is an unordered list with two items: &lt;P&gt;<P>    &lt;UL&gt;<P>    &lt;LI&gt; cranberries<P>    &lt;LI&gt; blueberries<P>    &lt;/UL&gt;<P>    This is the end of my example document. &lt;P&gt;<P>    &lt;ADDRESS&gt;Me (me@mycomputer.univ.edu)&lt;/ADDRESS&gt;<P>    &lt;/BODY&gt;<P><hr><A NAME="example2"></A>Were you able to follow the HTML? If you'd like to see how well you did, take a look a what this code <a href="code.html">really looks like</a>.<p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><P>In addition to tags already discussed, this example also uses the &lt;HEAD&gt;... &lt;/HEAD&gt; and &lt;BODY&gt; ... &lt;/BODY&gt; tags, which separate the document intointroductory information about the document and the main text of thedocument. These tags don't change the appearance of the formatteddocument at all, but are useful for several purposes (for example, NCSAMosaic for Macintosh 2.0, for example, allows you to browse just theheader portion of document before deciding whether to download the rest),and it is recommended that you use these tags.<TITLE>HTML Crash Course for Educators</TITLE><p><center><A HREF="resource.cntnts.html"><img border=0 src="home.gif" alt="Return to the EdWeb Home Room"></a><A HREF="dic.html"><img border=0 src="dic.gif" alt="I'd like to see the Edweb Dictionary"></a><A HREF="form.html"><img border=0 src="write.gif" alt="I'd like to send comments to EdWeb"></center></a></font><p><hr><center><em><A HREF="mailto:acarvin@k12.cnidr.org">EdWeb: Exploring Technology and School Reform, by Andy Carvin.

Not all web pages are alike, and some are grosser than others.  Just
because HTML will allow you to do it, doesn't mean it's going to look
good.  We'll look at some good and bad examples and generalize some
good style rules.  First, the less effective examples:

<h1> Mag's Big List of HTML Editors </h1>

<p> I hope for this to be the most complete list of HTML editing tools
around.  If you know of a tool that is not on this list,
or if you find incorrect or incomplete information here, please
<A href="mailto:mag@ncsa.uiuc.edu">let me know</a>.

<p> I'm working on collecting
<A href="http://sdg.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~mag/work/HTMLResources.html">other
HTML resources</a>, too.

This FAQ was prepared by <a href="http://cs.dal.ca/ftp/htmlasst/hh.html">Howard Harawitz</a>. 
<br>
This revision: September 2, 1995.
<p>
A text version of this FAQ can be obtained via anonymous FTP at:
ftp.cs.dal.ca /htmlasst/htmlafaq.txt.  You can download the plain text version directly by clicking <a href = 
"ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/htmlafaq.txt">here.</a>

<HR>
<h3>What is HTML Assistant?</h3>
HTML Assistant is a hypertext editor for creating and editing documents used on the World Wide Web. 
<P>
It permits you to validate and test your work with the browsers of your choice without leaving the editor.
<P>
In addition to its editing facilities, HTML Assistant incorporates features which can help you to organize 
and keep track of the Internet resources that you use.
<P>
It runs under MS Windows so you need to have Windows on your system in order to use it. 
<p>
The HTML documents created with HTML Assistant can be displayed on any computer for which browser 
software exists including IBM PC compatibles, Apple Macintosh, UNIX and simple terminal based 
systems.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
How can I get a copy of HTML Assistant?</h3>

HTML Assistant is available via anonymous FTP as freeware. The author holds the copyright, but the 
software may be freely used and distributed.  Distribution must include all the files in the program file set 
(htmlasst.zip).
<p>
The current release is version 1.4.
<p>
You can download it directly in several ways<P>
<OL>
<LI><a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/inst14.exe"> As a self-installing archive (500K).</a> "inst14.exe".<P>

<STRONG> Recommended: </STRONG> This is the longest file, but the easiest to install. It contains <B>ALL</B> the files you need, <B>INCLUDING VBRUN300.DLL</B>. It will guide you through the installation process, can make backups of any system files it replaces, and will permit you to easily uninstall the program.<P>

 After you receive the file, to begin the guided installation of <I>HTML Assistant</I>, simply execute the INST14.EXE file -- either by double clicking on its name in File Manager, or by using the "RUN" option in Program Manager's "FILE" menu. <P>

[<B>NOTE:</B> If you already have VBRUN300.DLL, you can <a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/part14.exe">download "part14.exe" (270K)</a> -
 it lacks VBRUN300.DLL, but is otherwise equivalent to INST14.EXE]<P>

<LI><a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/htmlasst.zip">As a compressed (.zip)  file (206K).</a>"htmlasst.zip".<P>

<LI><a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/htmlazip.exe">As a self-extracting archive (222K</a>"htmlazip.exe".
</OL>
<B>Important:</B> With options 2 or 3, if you don't already have it, you will also need the file &QUOT;vbrun300.dll&QUOT;.  You can download it by clicking <a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/vbrun300.zip">here</a> as &QUOT;vbrun300.zip&QUOT; -- length is about 230K 
bytes.  If you want a self-extracting archive, you can download &QUOT;vbrunzip.exe&QUOT; (about 245K), by clicking <a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/vbrunzip.exe">here</a>.<P>

If you prefer to use FTP software, the FTP site for HTML Assistant is:  ftp.cs.dal.ca 
<p>
The directory containing the files is /htmlasst/
<p>
Always check the short &QUOT;readme.1st&QUOT; file to see what files you need.

Newsletter" page for learning about the World Wide Web and HTML.
<p>

Once the document is displayed, simply point and click to bring up additional information. 
<p> 

<hr><h3>
How is HTML Assistant supported?</h3>

The primary support for HTML Assistant will be by means of an electronic publication called &QUOT;HTML 
Assistant Newsletter&QUOT;.  This will be forwarded, on a &QUOT;semi-irregular&QUOT; basis, to subscribers by Email 
starting early June, 1994.
<p>  

To subscribe send Email to <i>sales@brooknorth.bedford.ns.ca</i>. In the 'SUBJECT:' field include the word 
&QUOT;subscribe&QUOT; (quotes are not necessary).

href="mailto:sales@brooknorth.bedford.ns.ca">send Email to Brooklyn North Software Works</a>.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>Why is it called HTML Assistant? </h3>

World Wide Web browsers (Netscape, Cello and Mosaic are examples of browsers that work with MS Windows) use 
hypertext to access and display information available on the World Wide Web. Hypertext is text that 
incorporates pointers to additional information.  Microsoft Windows "Help" files are examples of 
hypertext documents.
<p>

The hypertext documents used by World Wide Web browsers are ordinary text files that include special 
markings that tell the browser software something about how the text should appear to the user, as well as 
how to retrieve information when the user requests it.
<p>

The language, or code, used for these special markings is Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
<p>

While HTML markings could be added to any text file using a simple editor like "Notepad" which comes 
with MS Windows, the process is tedious and time consuming.  Also, it is difficult to see how the 
documents you create will actually look when displayed by a browser.
<p>

HTML Assistant provides, along with a text editor, special tools and functions that 'assist' in the process 
of creating HTML text files by letting the computer handle most of the repetitive and time consuming 
tasks. 
<p>

HTML Assistant also permits you to validate your documents by viewing them with WWW browsers, while you are working 
on them, without leaving the editor.
<p>

HTML Assistant incorporates the following features to make the work of creating HTML text documents 
easier:

<ol>
<li>Point and click creation of HTML Hypertext markings<p>
<li>Ability to validate and test your work with the WWW browsers of your choice at the click of a button. You can quickly and easily 
view the documents you are working on to see how they will look when actually displayed by browsers. 
HTML assistant can take advantage of Cello's DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) capability so that testing 
your work with Cello is almost seamless.<p>
<li>A user defined toolbox enables you easily to include new markup text as more features are added to 
HTML.  You can also create your own markings for special editing tasks.<p>
<li>Facilities for extracting, organizing and combining URLs (pointers to information -- see below) from 
different sources. <p>
<li>A multiple document interface (more than one file may be opened at one time) so you can easily cut 
and paste between documents.<p>
<li>Context sensitive 'Help'<p>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>What are URLs?</h3>

URLs, or Uniform Resource Locators, are the pointers to information that can be accessed by browsers.  
URLs enable a single browser program to incorporate many of the functions that normally require several 
other software packages including FTP, news, Email and gopher.
<p>

For example, the URL "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/htmlasst.zip" could be used in an HTML document to 
enable a browser to retrieve the 'HTML Assistant' program files from an FTP site.<p>

Continuing with the example, the HTML text that would permit a user to retrieve the HTML Assistant 
files might look something like this:<p>

<code>&lt;a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst/htmlasst.zip">Retrieve HTML Assistant program 
files&lt;/a></code>
<p>
When the HTML was displayed by a browser, the user would see only the text "Retrieve HTML Assistant 
program files".  The text would be highlighted in some way (i.e., underlined, boxed, or in a different color 
than normal text) to indicate that it was 'linked' to the URL and that the user could 'click' on it to 
download the binary file "htmlasst.zip".<p>
<hr><h3>
How does HTML Assistant make it easier to work with URLs?</h3>

HTML Assistant minimizes typing and makes it easy to systematically collect and organize URLs.<p>

URLs can be somewhat laborious to type. It requires even more typing to add the HTML code that makes 
the information pointed to by the URL accessible to a user. 
<p>
With HTML Assistant, URLs need to be typed only once and sometimes not at all.  URLs created in 
HTML Assistant can be saved to files and can be quickly retrieved for point and click insertion into any 
document.  
<p>
URLs saved by browsers such as Cello (in Bookmark files) or Mosaic (in its menus and its 'hotlist') can be 
automatically copied and converted to HTML Assistant URL files for point and click insertion into your 
own documents.
<p>
HTML Assistant makes it easy to organize information you collect.  Files of collected URLs can be 
automatically converted to HTML text with a few mouse clicks.  This enables you to quickly create your 
own browser pages of links organized by subject, date or in whatever way suits you.  You can build your 
own information system based on a hierarchy of menus kept on WWW browser pages stored on your hard 
drive or on an HTML server.
<p><hr>
<h3>Where can I find MS Windows browsers for viewing HTML files?</h3>

"Cello" is available at ftp.law.cornell.edu in the directory /pub/LII/Cello/.<p>

"Netscape" is available at ftp.mcom.com/netscape/.  If that site is busy (as it often is), try one of the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/net/infosys/Mosaic-Comm/
<LI>lark.cc.ukans.edu/Netscape/
<LI>ftp.meer.net/Netscape/
<LI>doc.ic.ac.uk/packages/Netscape/
<LI>archie.au/pub/misc/netscape/ 
</UL>

"Mosaic" is available at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in the directory /pc/mosaic/.<p>
<hr>
<h3>What is "HTML Assistant Pro"? </h3>

<a href="http://fox.nstn.ca/~harawitz/comparsn.html"><strong>See a comparison of HTML Assistant (freeware) and HTML Assistant Pro (the commercial version).</strong></a><p>

Two versions of HTML Assistant are available.  The free version, called "HTML Assistant" is described in 
this document.  It is a full working version with all the features described above.  It will continue to be 
freely available and new versions will be released from time to time.<p>

<A HREF="http://fox.nstn.ca/~harawitz/htmlpro1.html">"HTML Assistant Pro"</A> is a commercially available version of HTML Assistant. <p>

It has additional features including:<p> 

<ol>
<li>An automatic HTML page creator plus pushbutton templates for forms and tables to get you up-and-running quickly<P>
<LI>The ability to edit files of any size<P>
<li>Toolbar support for HTML 2 and HTML 3 tags including forms, tables and background designs<P>
<li>Formatting filters that make it easy to create readable documents from HTML files.<p>
<li>Timesaving file and URL search features.<p>
<li>A printed manual<p> 
<li>It is fully supported and will keep up with changes in Windows versions, HTML, browsers, etc.<p>

<H1>Using HTML Forms</H1>

<p>

This document describes the interactive components of HTML forms.

These may include:

<dl>

<dd><a href="#tf">text fields</a>

<dd><a href="#pf">password fields</a>

<dd><a href="#cb">checkbox buttons</a>

<dd><a href="#rb">radio buttons</a>

<dd><a href="#sm">selection menus</a>

<dd><a href="#rsb">reset buttons</a>

<dd><a href="#sb">submit buttons</a>

</dl>

<p>

Following is a brief description of each feature, along with an 

example of its use. 

<p>

You can check out the <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/fill-out-forms/overview.html">form support documentation</a> written by the 

people at NCSA.

<h2>Summary of HTML Features</h2>
<FORM ACTION="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/htbin-post/post-query" METHOD="POST">

<ul>

<li><a name="tf"><strong>text fields</strong></a> <input name="temp"><p>

    <dl>

    <dt> To fill in a text field, move the cursor into the field and begin

         typing. The box will scroll if your response is longer than 

         the box can display.<p>

    <dd> <input name="temp" size=35 value="text fields can be of various"><p>

    <dd> <textarea name="temp" rows=5 cols=25>sizes

and

shapes

but they all work the same.

</textarea>

    </dl><p>



<li><a name="pf"><strong>password fields</strong></a> <input name="temp" type="password"><p>

    <dl>

    <dt> Password fields act the same as text fields, except that the text

         you enter is not shown (convenient for credit card numbers, 

         secret messages and, of course, passwords.) For instance, this

         box contains the key to happiness:<p>

    <dd> <input type="password" name="temp" value="eat raw fish"><p>

    </dl><p>



<li><a name="cb"><strong>checkbox buttons</strong></a> <input type="checkbox" name="temp" value="thing1"> <input type="checkbox" name="temp" value="thing2"><p> 

    <dl>

    <dt> The checkbox button indicates a non-exclusive choice. You may 

         select as many choices as apply. For example, <code>YES</code> and 

         <code>NO</code> have been selected from the following list:<p>

    <dd> <input type="checkbox" name="temp" value="eat" checked> YES

    <dd> <input type="checkbox" name="temp" value="drink" checked> NO

    <dl>

    <dt> The radio button indicates an exclusive choice; only one

         choice may be selected. For instance, <code>YES</code> has

         been selected below. If you select <code>NO</code>, 

         <code>YES</code> will automatically be unselected.<p>

    <dd> <input type="radio" name="temp2" value="eat" checked> YES

    <dd> <input type="radio" name="temp2" value="drink"> NO

    <dl>

    <dt>Like checkbox and radio buttons, selection menus present a 

        list of options to choose from, although in a different form.

        Some selection menus <em>(like the one above)</em> allow you to choose 

        only one option, some <em>(like the one below)</em> allow you to choose

        any number of options.<p>

    <dd><select multiple size=3 name="menu2">

<li><a name="rsb"><strong>reset buttons</strong></a> <input type="reset"><p>

    <dl>

    <dt>Reset buttons change the form back to its original state, removing

        all changes made to it. Reset buttons can be called anything, but

        they all do the same thing.<p>

    <dd><input type="reset" value="Clear"> <input type="reset" value="Bye"> <input type="reset" value="Clean Form">

    <dl>

    <dt>Submit buttons do just that: submit the contents of the form to

        wherever the form creator desires. <p>If you select one of the buttons

        on this example form, you'll see the values of the form variables displayed

        on a new page. <p>It is only when this button is 

        selected that the information on the form is registered. Like reset 

        buttons, submit buttons can have various names.<p>

<H1 align=right>        <a href="">     What is a Webmaster ?   </a>    </H1>

        There could of course be many variations of answers to this question,
        and I do not claim to provide the definitive one. However I have tried
        to research this question fully and carefully, and I've taken input
        from more authoritive people than myself. In particular, my starting
        template for this document was
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Provider/">
        Putting Information onto the Web</a>.

        As with most of my web creations, approximately half is adapted from
        other sources, which I hope I have adequately acknowledged;
        and approximately half is my own original sin.

        Especial thanks are due to Tim Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly.

        We will look at several r&ocirc;les related to, or interacting with,
        'webmaster'.
        The boundaries between these r&ocirc;les are not sharply defined;
        e.g. a webmaster might also sometimes perform authoring or system
        administration. In a small company he or she might perform all the
        tasks described here; and the r&ocirc;le may be much more specialized
        in a larger company.

<li>    <a href ="http://WWW.Stars.com/W3C/Provider/#sysadmin">System Administrator</a>
</ul>
        We could perhaps identify further r&ocirc;les such as publisher,
        designer, or programmer.
        These might be added in a future revision of this document.

        If you are a person responsible for managing the information provided
        by your organization, you have to balance the advantages of a "house
        style" with the advantages of giving each group or author free rein.
        If you end up with decisions in this area, it is as well to write them
        down (not to mention put them on the web).

        As an author, you have information you would like
        to publish onto the web.
        You will need to know how to create and edit hypertext,
        and you will need to learn the conventions and etiquette of the web.

        you can look at any of a number of good resources on HyperText Markup Language,

        You should make a mail alias "webmaster" on the server machine so
        that people who have problems with your server can mail you about it
        easily. This is similar to the "postmaster" alias for
        people who have mail problems with your machine.

        As a webmaster, you are responsible for the
        information base of a particular site or organization.
        You will probably want to learn how to organize
        large amounts of hypertext,
        and perhaps how to create and maintain a "house style".

        Webmaster duties typically
        will include editorial responsibility for the content,
        quality and style of the site,
        in collaboration with the area authors on the team.

        This will include finding, creating and
        installing tools to create web content and check consistency;
        development and enforcement of the house style,
        including liaison with graphic artists;
        and the development of interactive web applications.
<p>
        A webmaster should have demonstrable inspiration in, and understanding
        of, hypertext as a
        medium and proven experience in the creative use of UNIX in addition to
        excellent proofreading and editing skills.

        The ability to facilitate the arrival at consensus,
        a sense of clean design amid complex constraints, speed in prototyping,
        and the ability to hold long-term goals in mind while
        producing immediate solutions are key.

        The ability to work both
        independently and effectively with others is a necessary qualification,
        as are good communication and writing skills.
        You will need to be more
        familiar with the server in order to set up a configuration
        that works for your data,
        and you will probably want to
        learn about various tools that can be useful.

        The server administrator (the one with the root password) in principle
        has the power to turn the thing on or off, and control what happens.
        However, it is wise to have clearly delegated responsibility for
        separate areas of documentation. Maybe the server administrator has no
        responsibility at all for the actual content of the data, in which case
        he or she should just keep the machine running properly.

        As a system administrator, you will need to know

<p>This page is really for my own reference, but after getting many
   'how do you do <i>so-and-so</i> on your web page' questions I thought I'd share a list of
   sites I've found useful. Be warned of its Macintosh leanings, and that the
   links are geared toward those who already know the basics of putting up a
   web page. Newbies should refer to 
   <a href="http://www.interlog.com/~csteele/newbie.html"

<H2><A NAME=s>Epilog -- Open Standards</A></H2>
<P>It would seem fitting to end this article with a short plug for the concept
of &quot;open standards.&quot; Much of the success of the Internet and its many
pieces is that fact that it has developed and evolved in a very open process.
This dialog results in a healthy competition of ideas and results. Open
standards better serve the needs of the marketplace than of the
mega-corporations. Microsoft might see them as a threat, as might IBM. <B><I>Bigger
is better, only when it is better</I></B>. For some, a very terrifying concept.</P>

Mature artists steal."           -- Lionel Trilling, in Esquire<P>I am proud to say that not a single word in this entire lesson ismine :)<P>Actually, I want to thank James Milles (the Head of Computer Servicesat the Saint Louis University Law Library) for giving me permissionto reprint his "Discussion Lists: Mail Server Commands" file. Jamesis a "God" in my book, and his support really means a lot to me.<P>We covered some basic LISTSERV commands yesterday. Today's lesson isgoing to show you some more advanced LISTSERV commands, as well assome new commands for other mail list servers. These additional mailservers include Listproc, Mailbase, Mailserv, and Majordomo.<P>Unlike LISTSERV, there is no set way to figure out if a mailinglist is running on a Listproc, Mailbase, Mailserv, or Majordomowithout someone telling you. So, today's lesson is really justa review of some of the LISTSERV commands we went over last lesson,an introduction to some new LISTSERV commands, and a referencesheet for other mail server commands that you can use later.<P><HR><B>DISCUSSION LISTS: MAIL SERVER COMMANDS</B><P>Version 1.21July 28, 1994<BR>James MillesSaint Louis University Law Librarymillesjg@sluvca.slu.edu<P>1.  E-mail discussion lists constitute one of the most popularmethods of group communication on the Internet.  Discussion listssupport group communication by providing, at minimum, two basicfunctions: (1) the ability to distribute a message to a group ofpeople by sending it to a single, central address, and (2) theability to quietly join and leave the list at any time.<P>     1.1.  In order to provide these separate functions, an     e-mail discussion list typically has two addresses     associated with it: (1) a "listname address," the address to     which you send any messages that you intend to be read by     the list subscribers; and (2) an "administrative address,"     the address to which you send any commands or requests that     affect your subscription to the list.  It's easy to remember     this distinction by thinking of your local newspaper: the     first address is somewhat analogous to sending a "letter to     the editor,"  while the second is like sending a letter to     the newspaper's subscription office.<P>     1.2.  With most discussion lists, the "administrative     address" is a computer program that allows the subscriber to     subscribe and unsubscribe automatically, without external     intervention.  There are at least five popular mail server     programs used to manage Internet discussion lists: REVISED     LISTSERV (also called BITNET LISTSERV), Unix ListProcessor     (or Listproc), Mailbase, Mailserv, and Majordomo.  The     commands for subscribing and unsubscribing under most of     these programs are the same; however, other useful commands     differ greatly from one program to another, and some     programs support features that others do not.<P>     1.3.  This document does not describe all the features     supported by any of these programs, only those most commonly     used.  For more information on any of these programs, send a     message containing only the word "help" to the appropriate     mail server.  Additional programs and commands will be added     in future revisions of this document.<P>     1.4.  This document also does not deal with discussion lists     to which one subscribes by sending a message to     "listname-request."  There are a great many discussion     lists of this type; some are distribution lists maintained     manually by the listowner, while others use some form of     mailer software ranging from a simple script to a fairly     sophisticated mailing list program.  Some require that     subscription requests be placed in the message text; others     require them to be included in the Subject: line.  Because     of the variety of methods of maintaining these lists, it is     impossible to generalize about their command features.     However, as a rule, assume that any discussion list with an     administrative address of "listname-request" is maintained     manually by a human being.  Accordingly, you should     subscribe by sending a friendly message in plain English to     "listname-request."  If a program responds with     instructions for subscribing, follow the instructions.<P>     1.5.  The latest version of this document is available by     e-mail and by anonymous ftp:<P>          E-mail:   Send a message containing only the line<BR>                    GET MAILSER CMD NETTRAIN F=MAIL<BR>                    to LISTSERV@UBVM.cc.buffalo.edu.<BR>          FTP:      Anonymous ftp to ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu<BR>                    cd /nettrain<BR>                    get mailser.cmd<BR>                    -- or --<BR>                    anonymous ftp to sluaxa.slu.edu<BR>                    cd /pub/millesjg<BR>                    get mailser.cmd<BR>2.  When you subscribe to a list, you will typically receive a"welcome" message, describing the purpose of the list and tellingyou how to unsubscribe.  Save this message!  It tells you whichprogram the discussion list is run under, and how to get furtherhelp.<P>     2.1.  Mail servers can be confusing.  Many people use the     term "listserv" generically, to refer to any list mail     server program.  To make things worse, the Unix     ListProcessor (listproc) program was originally called     "listserv," just like REVISED LISTSERV.  Many listproc hosts     are still configured with the name "listserv," and will     accept commands addressed to "listserv@host" as well as to     the correct name, "listproc@host."<P>     2.2.  Usually--but not always--you can find out which     program a discussion list is run under by examining the     message headers.  For instance, listproc lists should     include a line saying "Unix ListProcessor."  However, the     best practice is to save any "welcome" message you receive     when you subscribe, and to note at that time which set of     commands is applicable.<P>3.  Remember to send all commands to the "administrativeaddress"--mailserver@host--not to the "listname address".Mailserver is the program that maintains the list (eitherlistproc, LISTSERV, mailbase, mailserv, or majordomo); host isthe address of the host computer (for example, ucdavis.edu orcleo.murdoch.edu.au).<P>     3.1.  Be sure to leave the Subject: line blank, and to     delete any signature file if your mailer allows you to do     so.<P>     3.2.  Always include the name of the list in the message to     mailserver@host.  Most mailserver sites maintain many     different discussion lists, and it is essential that you     tell the mail server which list you are talking about.<P>     3.3.  For instance, to join the discussion list     law-lib@ucdavis.edu, send an e-mail message containing only     the command<P>     SUBSCRIBE LAW-LIB John Doe<P>     to listproc@ucdavis.edu.<P>     The other examples used below are:     INT-LAW@UMINN1.BITNET (REVISED LISTSERV),     law-europe@mailbase.ac.uk (Mailbase),     envirolaw@oregon.uoregon.edu (Mailserv),and     elaw-j@cleo.murdoch.edu.au (Majordomo).<P><HR>Join a list:<P><UL>     Listproc:      SUBSCRIBE listname Firstname Lastname                    (e.g., SUBSCRIBE LAW-LIB John Doe)<BR>     LISTSERV:      SUBSCRIBE listname Firstname Lastname                    (e.g., SUBSCRIBE INT-LAW John Doe)<BR>     Mailbase:      JOIN listname Firstname Lastname                    (e.g., JOIN LAW-EUROPE John Doe)<BR>     Mailserv:      SUBSCRIBE listname Firstname Lastname                    (e.g., SUBSCRIBE ENVIROLAW John Doe)                    (Optionally, include the e-mail address at                    which you wish to receive list mail:)               SUBSCRIBE listname Firstname Lastname address<BR>     Majordomo:     SUBSCRIBE listname                    (e.g., SUBSCRIBE ELAW-J)                    (Optionally, include the e-mail address at                    which you wish to receive list mail:)                    SUBSCRIBE listname address<BR></UL>Leave a list:<P><UL>     Listproc:      UNSUBSCRIBE listname<BR>     LISTSERV:      UNSUBSCRIBE listname<BR>     Mailbase:      LEAVE listname<BR>     Mailserv:      UNSUBSCRIBE listname                    (UNSUBSCRIBE listname address                    if you subscribed under a different e-mail                    address.)<BR>     Majordomo:     UNSUBSCRIBE listname                    (UNSUBSCRIBE listname address                    if you subscribed under a different e-mail                    address.)<BR></UL>Receive the list in digest format (multiple messages compiledinto a single mailing, usually daily or weekly):<P><UL>     Listproc:      SET listname MAIL DIGEST<BR>     LISTSERV:      SET listname DIGEST<BR>     Mailbase:      Not supported.<BR>     Mailserv:      Not supported.<BR>     Majordomo:     SUBSCRIBE listname-DIGEST                    (in the same message, unsubscribe from the                    undigested version:)                    UNSUBSCRIBE listname<BR>                    </UL>(Note: with those programs that support the digest option,whether or not to offer the digest format is within thediscretion of the listowner;

however,                    it uses a difficult, batch-coded search                    language to construct queries.  I find it                    useful to keep a "template" file in my                    Internet account, and then edit the file as                    appropriate when I need to do a search.                    Here's the search file:<BR>                    //  JOB  Echo=No                    Database Search DD=Rules                    //Rules DD   *                    Search nafta in int-law since 93/6/1                    Index                    /*<BR>                    To run a search, send this file in an e-mail                    message to LISTSERV@[host].

The date is                    optional; Boolean combinations, nesting with                    parentheses, and a great number of other                    capabilities are supported.

<H2><A NAME=s>Epilog -- Open Standards</A></H2>
<P>It would seem fitting to end this article with a short plug for the concept
of &quot;open standards.&quot; Much of the success of the Internet and its many
pieces is that fact that it has developed and evolved in a very open process.
This dialog results in a healthy competition of ideas and results. Open
standards better serve the needs of the marketplace than of the
mega-corporations. Microsoft might see them as a threat, as might IBM. <B><I>Bigger
is better, only when it is better</I></B>. For some, a very terrifying concept.</P>

I've shown you the differencesbetween each of the three levels of connectivity, I've taught you howto read an e-mail address (and I *still* don't think that "p-crispy-one"is funny!), I've burned it into your mind that you send letters to thelist address and commands to the LISTSERV address, and I even let JamesMilles introduce you to the world of other mailing list programs.<P>The Internet, however, is made up of more than computers and commands.All of the computers and commands would be useless if it weren't forthe people who used the computers and commands. The commands are neat,but it is the PEOPLE who make the Internet what it is.<P>The problem is that every grouping of people develops its own cultureand common rules that governs the behavior of the people.<P>Today's lesson is going to give you an insider's look at how toavoid some of the mistakes that EVERYONE makes when they start outon the Internet. If you can take what is said in this lesson to heart,you are going to find that your travels on the Information Superhighwayare going to be a whole lot smoother.<P>The following "Netiquette" guide (that's the common way to describethe ettiquette of the Internet) was written by my father, the Rev. Bob"Bob" Crispen. I think you'll soon see where my sense of humor comesfrom :)<P>In fact, it was because of my dad that I first got onto the Internet(I got an e-mail account so that I could e-mail him and ask him formoney).<P><HR><CENTER>                                NETIQUETTE<BR>                       by the Rev. Bob "Bob" Crispen<BR>                         (Patrick Crispen's daddy)<BR></CENTER><P>One of these days you're going to get tired of Web surfing or listeningin on LISTSERVs, IRCs, Usenet newsgroups or whatever, and you're goingto want to say something yourself.  At that moment your life willchange.  Let's see if we can't make that a change for the better.<P><b>Evangelism:</b>Everyone is tempted from time to time to evangelize, to stride boldlyinto the enemy's camp and throw down the gauntlet.  We will never seethe end of people who pop up on comp.sys.intel praising Macs andAmigas; who send mail to the SKEPTIC list that flying saucers really,truly do exist; who enlighten the Buddhist newsgroups that they're allbound for hell, and on and on.<P>In the entire history of the net, no one has managed to do this withoutlooking like a complete idiot.  If you believe you are the one personwho will succeed where millions have failed, then you're ready to learnabout ...<P><b>Flames:</b>There is nothing you can say that won't offend somebody:<P>     >It's a bright, sunny day today.<P>     You filthy *@!?$, what have you got against Seattle?<P>Flames (violent verbal expressions of disapproval), misunderstandings,overreactions, and hurt feelings are par for the course.  Four lessonsfrom experience:<P>(1) Hedge your bets.  Rather than saying, "Metal rules! Death to allthat appose!!" try saying "In my humble opinion (often abbreviatedIMHO) metal bands perfectly express my feelings, choices, andlifestyle.  Your mileage may vary" (another net cliche', lessfrequently abbreviated YMMV).  By the way, BTW is another frequent netabbreviation, for what it's worth (FWIW).<P>(2) Apologize.  When misunderstanding is the culprit, and especially ifyou respect the person who misunderstood, take the blame on yourselffor being unclear, apologize, say what you meant more clearly (ifappropriate) and put it behind you.  As in real life (remember that?)people who are quick to anger are often equally quick to forgive.<P>(3) Avoid flame bait (conduct which gravely offends the norms, moresand folkways of a particular group).  "Now wait a minute!" you say."Do you mean that something that's accepted behavior on one list ornewsgroup will draw dozens of stinging, ridiculing comments inanother?" I sure do.  What can you do?  Lurk a while before you post.Read what's said like an anthropologist, trying to discover what thebig no-nos are.  The beginning of a school term is a wonderful time todo this, as you will observe the clueless newbies who weren't smartenough to read this paragraph being torn to shreds.  There aresome things you should NEVER do, and we'll list them in a minute, butlet's get to the last bit of advice.<P>(4) Bow down to the group's gods.  In every Usenet newsgroup andlistserv mailing list there are old, grey heads who have earned therespect of everyone in the group.  For example, amongst the subscribersto the list discussing the late American bandleader Stan Kenton are theproducer of a Kenton box set and the authors of definitive Kentonbiographies and discographies.  You are entirely ignorant compared tothose people.  Never pretend you're anything else.  They would dearlylove to help you -- to answer a question, help you find a rare record-- but you'll always come out second best in a head-butting contestwith them.<P>Still other group members have earned their status through longservice.  Friendships have developed over many years, and marriage isnot unknown.  By commenting abusively to or about one of these gods,you'll earn not only her enmity, but the enmity of all of her friends-- which may be everyone in the group but you!<P>Dos and don'ts (or how to avoid most flames):<P>(1) <b>DON'T</b> include the entire contents of a previous posting in your reply.<P> (1) <b>DO</b> cut mercilessly.  Leave just enough to indicate what you're responding to.  NEVER include mail headers except maybe the "From:" line.  If you can't figure out howto delete lines in your mailer software, paraphrase or type the quoted material in.<P>(2) <b>DON'T</b> reply to a point in a posting without quoting or paraphrasing what you're responding to and who said it. Reason: a dozen postings may occur between the original message and your reply. At some sites your reply may get there before the original.<P>(2) <b>DO</b> quote (briefly) or paraphrase. If the original "Subject:" line was "Big dogs" make sure yours says "Re: Big dogs".  Some REPLY functions do this  automatically. By net convention, included lines are preceded by ">"   (greater-than signs).  Some mail editors and newsreaders do this automatically. Others require you to do it manually or set the "indent character"<P>(3) <b>DON'T</b> send a message saying "Why doesn't anybody say anything about X?" or "Who wants to talk about X?" <P>(3) It's always a risk to start a new topic (often called a thread). The group may have just finished a long, bitter war about that very subject.  But if you want to take the risk, SAY SOMETHING yourself about the subject you're raising.<P>(4)<b> DON'T</b> send lines longer than 70 characters.  This is a kindness to folks with terminal-based mail editors or newsreaders.  Some mail gateways truncate extra  characters turning your deathless prose into gibberish.<P>(4) Some mail editor tools only SEEM to insert line breaks for you, but actually don't, so that every paragraph is one immense line. Learn what your mail editor does.<P>(5)<b> DON'T SEND A MESSAGE IN ALL CAPS.  CAPITALIZED MESSAGES ARE HARDER TO READ THAN LOWER CASE OR MIXED CASE.</b><P>(5) <b>DO</b> use normal capitalization. Separate your paragraphs with blank lines.  Make your message inviting to your potential readers.<P>(6) <b>DON'T</b> betray confidences. It is all too easy to quote a personal letter in a posting to the entire group. <P>(6) <b>DO</b> read the "To:" and "Cc:" lines in your message before you send it.  Are you SURE you want the mail to go there?<P>(7)<b> DON'T</b> make statements which can be interpreted as official positions of your organization or offers to do business.  Saying "Boy, I'd sure like to have  one of them Crays" could result in a truck at your loading dock and abill in the mail even larger thanyour student loan.<P>(7) <b>DO</b> treat every post as though you were sending a copy to your boss, your minister, and your worst enemy. <P>  (8) <b>DON'T</b> rely on the ability of your readers to tell the difference between  serious statements and satire or sarcasm. It's hard to write funny. It's even harder  to write satire.<P>(8) <b>DO</b> remember that no one can hear your tone of voice.  Use emoticons (or smilies) like :-) or ;^) -- turn your head counterclockwise to see the smile.  You can also use caps for emphasis or use net conventions for italics and  underlines as in: You said the guitar solo on "Comfortably Numb" from Pink Floyd's   _The Wall_ was *lame*? Are you <b>OUT OF YOUR MIND???!!!</b><P>(9) <b>DON'T</b> make a posting that says nothing but "Me, too."  This is most annoying when combined with (1) or (2) above.  Ditto for "I don't know."<P>(9) <b>DO</b> remember the immortal words of Martin Farquhar Tupper (1810-1889): "Well-timed silence hath more eloquence than speech." <p> A word to people living in the United States: the net isinternational.  If you tell a Belgian she's being unAmerican, SHE ISN'TOFFENDED.  OF COURSE she's unAmerican; you're unBelgian.  She doesn'tcare about being lectured on the First Amendment and American values.She doesn't HAVE a First Amendment, and she thinks Belgian values areBETTER.  We Americans have made fools of ourselves by forgetting thiseverywhere else.  Let's try to behave a little better on the net.<P>Finally, many groups have had the sense to write down some of theirnorms and folkways in a frequently asked questions (FAQ) list alongwith (what else?) the answers to frequently asked questions.  ManyUsenet FAQs are posted monthly or so on the news.answers.  Listownersof listservs are often quite willing to mail you the FAQ for the list.In fact, they may have already told you where it is in the letter youget welcoming you to the list.<P>With all we've said above, and with all the help newsgroup moderatorsand listowners are providing to newcomers, it almost seems like you'dhave to work at it to go charging in with your mouth open and your eyesand ears shut, thereby aggravating and alienating some otherwiseperfectly nice people.  The good Lord gave us two eyes and two ears andone mouth to remind us of that very thing.  But he gave us ten fingers,and here we are.<P>-----Now a note from me:<P>HOMEWORK:<P>     There are DOZENS of Netiquette guides on the Internet, although     IMHO none of them are as good as my dad's :)  (1)<P>     Actually, Arlene Rinaldi has a HUGE Netiquette guide that I am     going to show you how to retrieve using file transfer protocol,     gopher, and the WWW later on in the workshop.<P>     So your homework today is:<P><UL>          1. Save this lesson<BR>          2. Re-read this lesson several times.<BR>          3.

Orimagine the electronic equivalent of a radio talk show where everybodycan put their two cents in and no one is ever on hold.<p>Unlike e-mail, which is usually "one-to-one,"  Usenet is "many-to-many." Usenet is the international meeting place, where people gather tomeet their friends, discuss the day's events, keep up with computertrends or talk about whatever's on their mind.  Jumping into a Usenetdiscussion can be a liberating experience.  Nobody knows what you look orsound like, how old you are, what your background is.  You're judgedsolely on your words, your ability to make a point.<p>To many people, Usenet IS the Net. In fact, it is often confusedwith Internet.  But it is a totally separate system. All Internet sitesCAN carry Usenet, but so do many non-Internet sites, from sophisticatedUnix machines to old XT clones and Apple IIs.<p>Technically, Usenet messages are shipped around the world, fromhost system to host system, using one of several specific Netprotocols.  Your host system stores all of its Usenet messages in oneplace, which everybody with an account on the system can access. Thatway, no matter how many people actually read a given message, eachhost system has to store only one copy of it. Many host systems "talk"with several others regularly in case one or another of their links goesdown for some reason.  When two host systems connect, they basicallycompare notes on which Usenet messages they already have.  Any that oneis missing the other then transmits, and vice-versa.  Because they arecomputers, they don't mind running through thousands, even millions, ofthese comparisons every day.<p>Yes, millions.  For Usenet is huge.  Every day, Usenet userspump upwards of 40 million characters a day into the system -- roughlythe equivalent of volumes A-G of the Encyclopedia Britannica. Obviously,nobody could possibly keep up with this immense flow of messages.  Let'slook at how to find conferences and discussions of interest to you.<p>The basic building block of Usenet is the newsgroup, which is acollection of messages with a related theme (on other networks, thesewould be called conferences, forums, bboards or special-interestgroups).  There are now more than 5,000 of these newsgroups, in severaldifferent languages, covering everything from art to zoology, fromscience fiction to South Africa.<p>Some public-access systems, typically the ones that work throughmenus, try to make it easier by dividing Usenet into several broadcategories.  Choose one of those and you're given a list of newsgroups inthat category.  Then select the newsgroup you're interested in and startreading.<p>Other systems let you compile your own "reading list" so that youonly see messages in conferences you want.  In both cases, conferencesare arranged in a particular hierarchy devised in the early 1980s.Newsgroup names start with one of a series of broad topic names.  Forexample, newsgroups beginning with "comp." are about particular computer-related topics.  These broad topics are followed by a series of morefocused topics (so that "comp.unix" groups are limited to discussionabout Unix).  The main hierarchies are:<p><ul>             bionet -           Research biology<br>             bit.listserv -     Conferences originating as Bitnet mailing lists<br>             biz -              Business<br>             comp -             Computers and related subjects<br>             misc -             Discussions that don't fit anywhere else<br>             news -          News about Usenet itself<br>             rec     -          Hobbies, games and recreation<br>             sci     -          Science other than research biology<br>             soc     -          "Social" groups, often ethnically related<br>             talk    -          Politics and related topics<br>             alt     -          Controversial or unusual topics; not                             carried by all sites<br></ul>In addition, many host systems carry newsgroups for a particularcity, state or region.  For example, ne.housing is a newsgroup whereNew Englanders look for apartments.  A growing number also carry K12newsgroups, which are aimed at elementary and secondary teachers andstudents.  And a number of sites carry clari newsgroups, which isactually a commercial service consisting of wire-service stories anda unique online computer news service.<p>... With so much to choose from, everybody will likely have their ownunique Usenet reading list.  But there are a few newsgroups that areparticularly of interest to newcomers.  Among them:<p><ul>     news.announce.newusers -    This group consists of a series of                                articles that explain various facets of                                Usenet.<br>     news.newusers.questions - This is where you can ask questions                                about how Usenet works.<br>     news.announce.newsgroups - Look here for information about new or                                proposed newsgroups.<br>     news.answers  -             Contains lists of "Frequently Asked                                Questions"  (FAQs) and their answers from                                many different newsgroups.  Learn how to                                fight jet lag in the FAQ from                                rec.travel.air; look up answers to common                                questions about Microsoft Windows in                                an FAQ from comp.os.ms-windows; etc.<br>     alt.internet.services  -    Looking for something in particular on                                the Internet?  Ask here.<br>     alt.infosystems.announce  - People adding new information services to                                the Internet will post details here.<br></ul><hr>And now for a few words from "p-crispy-one":<p>The EFF (1) notes that daily input into Usenet is equivalent to volumesA-G of the Encyclopedia Britannica. You should be warned that theinformation on Usenet is of *much* lower quality. Anybody with anopinion can post anything in a Usenet newsgroup, whether they knowwhat they're talking about or not. If you want to bet your gradein school or your company's or organization's future on informationyou get from Usenet, please e-mail me first -- I have some bargainsin real estate (including a great price for a bridge in Brooklyn) I'dlike to discuss with you.<p>There are more Usenet newsgroups, dedicated to the discussion of moretopics, than you could even imagine. I recently heard that there areover 6,000 different Usenet newsgroups, although I think that numbermay be a little low. The Osborne/McGraw-Hill Internet Yellow Pageshas fifty-five pages of Usenet newsgroup listings (p. 363-418).<p>What are some of these newsgroups? Here is a short list taken fromthe Osborne/McGraw-Hill Internet Yellow Pages (and reprinted bypermission):<p><ul>  alt.abuse-recovery   -             Helping victims of abuse recover<br>  alt.barney.dinosaur.die.die.die  - Hate and excoriation of Barney the                                    Dinosaur<br>  bionet.jobs                  -     Job opportunities in biology<br>  bit.listserv.xerox-l      -        Xerox products<br>  biz.books.technical      -         Selling and buying books<br>  clari.biz.top          -           Top business news<br>  comp.cog-eng           -           Cognitive engineering<br>  ...</ul>As you can see, the topics are pretty diverse. I also want you tonotice something about the group names. All of the Usenet groupnames have periods (or, in Internet language, "dots") in them.That is a great way to see if a group is a Usenet group or amailing list group (which we covered last week).<p><ul>         gnu.emacs.sources  -    Usenet newsgroup<br>     RHA-L              -    Mailing list<br>     rec.birds          -    Usenet newsgroup<br>     Navigate           -    Mailing list<br></ul>So, how do you read the posts in a Usenet newsgroup? Well, you haveto have access to a Usenet newsreader.<p>There are literally DOZENS of different Usenet readers out there.Your local Internet provider will be able to tell you what Usenetreader you have access to, and will probably also be able totell you some of your reader's commands (remember that in a lotof Usenet readers the commands are case sensitive).<p>Some of the more important Usenet reader commands that you needto know are:<p><ul>     <li>How to access your Usenet reader     <li>How to access a particular newsgroup     <li>How to subscribe/unsubscribe to a particular newsgroup     <li>How to read a post     <li>How to send a post     <li>How to respond to a posting by e-mail     <li>How to save a post     <li>How to move from one newsgroup to another     <li>How to exit your Usenet reader</ul>HOMEWORK:<p>1)   Ask your school system administrator if you have Usenet     access. If you do, ask for a handout or help file which lists the           commands for your reader. (Most Usenet readers also have a pretty           extensive, albeit confusing, help screen. If you can get into your          reader, you may want to check out this help screen).<p>     If you don't have Usenet access, or if your provider does     not have a help file, please be patient. When we get to     the lessons on Gopher, I'll show you some tricks that will help you         around this problem :)<p>NOTES:<p>(1) We'll talk about the Electronic Frontier Foundation next.<p>SOURCES:<p>The text in this lesson comes from the Electronic Frontier Foundation's"EFF's Guide to the Internet, v.2.3" and is reprinted by permission.<p> +----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+<br>:  PATRICK DOUGLAS CRISPEN   :  The views expressed in this letter do not  :<br>:   PCRISPE1@UA1VM.UA.EDU    :   necessarily represent the views of the    :<br>: THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA  :     University of Alabama - Tuscaloosa.     :<br>+----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+<br>:       Roadmap: Copyright Patrick Crispen 1994.

With very little thought, you canconvert the list into a shell script (or your operating system'sequivalent) that will mail the same message to every single one of thesegroups.<p>Doing this is called "spamming", after the Monty Python sketch quotedabove.<p>During the past year, there have been three such mailings that have"succeeded":  One poster said that the end of the world was nigh;another advertised the services of their law firm in the so-called"Green Card Lottery" message; and a third, labeled "MAKE.MONEY.FAST"was the Usenet equivalent of the old chain letter.<p>Of the three, the one that got the most attention was the Green CardLottery spam (1).  According to the Washington Post, the law firmin question considered the Internet to be "an ideal, low-cost andperfectly legitimate way to target people likely to be potentialclients."<p>Many people felt differently, though.  They felt that, first, theInternet is the wrong place to conduct commercial business.  Many ofthe charters of the Usenet newsgroups and listservs specificallyprohibit offers to do business.  The few that do accept offersrestrict the buyers and sellers to individuals, not businesses.  Thenet has had a long tradition of non-commercialism, ever since itsfounding days as ARPAnet.<p>Second, the net isn't free.  One popular newsreader "trn" displays thefollowing message before it lets you post:<p>     This program posts news articles to thousands of machines     throughout the enter {sic} civilized world.  Your message will cost     the net hundreds if not thousands of dollars to send     everywhere.  Please be sure you know what you are doing.<p>     Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?  y/n<p>Since the spammers are alleged to have posted to over 6,000 groups,they surely spent quite a bit of somebody's money.<p>Finally, people who gather together to discuss a topic get annoyed whensomeone discusses something outside the group's charter.  They oftencomplain to the newsgroup itself, thereby increasing the trafficeven further.<p>Note that spams generally aren't crossposted.  That means that everynews host will receive, process, and make available to its readers aseparate copy of the spam for every newsgroup.  Of course, "courteous"spammers who use crossposting can make things even worse.  In onerecent spam, not only was the spam sent to all sorts of unrelatednewsgroups, but so were the angry replies!  (The people replying wereguilty of not reading their "To:" and "Cc:" lines before they posted).<p>WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU SEE A SPAM.<p>First, NEVER reply to the group.  The spammer won't read it.  He'sinterested in talking, not listening, and he isn't a list member or aregular reader.  Your angry posting will only annoy the other membersof the group, and won't affect the spammer in the slightest.<p>Second, if you have a lot of time on your hands, you may read theresponses of members who ignored my first bit of advice.  Oncomp.os.vxworks, for example, one (moderately clueless) member posted(in response to the end of the world spam) "This isn't a religiousnewsgroup!"  An old-timer responded "I think that very much depends onthe topic. ;)." (that's a wink)<p>Third, if you have even more time on your hands, reply to the posterat his own mailbox.  But you may not get satisfaction.  Quite oftenspammers hit and run, and by the time you get back to yell at them,they've closed out their accounts (or if their site administrator ison her toes, they'll have had their accounts closed by the administrator).<p>Fourth, if you're even angrier at the spammer, you can write to theadministrator of his site.  If the spammer is clown@circus.com, hisadministrator is postmaster@circus.com.<p>Fifth, and this is net abuse that can get you removed by your siteadministrator, you may want to mailbomb the offender.  That consists ofsending him lots and lots of email until his site or his accountcrashes.  And, yes, it is perfectly possible to make a machine crash,taking down all its users, by sending too much mail to a person on thatmachine.  The same thing can happen to gateways processing the mail.<p>What I do is *think* about mailing offenders the Manhattan telephonedirectory.  In PostScript.  I enjoy the thought without abusing the netmyself.  Yes, you have it within your power to spam the world, or tomailbomb (mostly innocent) people.  You also have it within your powerto buy a gun and start shooting at people.  That doesn't mean you haveto do it.<p>URBAN LEGENDS (ULs):<p>Another example of spamming on a much smaller scale, at least in mymind, are the urban legends that simply refuse to die. There is nobetter example of an urban legend than the story surrounding CraigShergold.<p>"There once was a seven-year-old boy named Craig Shergold who wasdiagnosed with a seemingly incurable brain tumor. As he lay dying,he wished only to have friends send him postcards. The local newspapersgot a hold of the tear-jerking story. Soon, the boy's wish had changed:he now wanted to get into the Guinness Book of World Records for thelargest postcard collection. Word spread around the world. People bythe millions sent him postcards.<p>Miraculously, the boy lived. An American billionaire even flew himto the U.S. for surgery to remove what remained of the tumor. Andhis wish succeeded beyond his wildest dreams -- he made the GuinnessBook of world records.<p>But with Craig now well into his teens, his dream has turned intoa nightmare for the post office in the small town outside Londonwhere he lives. Like Craig himself, his request for cards justrefuses to die, inundating the post office with millions of cardsevery year. Just when it seems like the flow is slowing, alongcomes somebody else who starts up a whole new slew of requestsfor people to send Craig post cards (or greeting cards or businesscards -- Craig letters have truly taken on a life of their ownand begun to mutate). Even Dear Abby has been powerless to makeit stop." (2)<p>The current variation on the Craig story that is floating aroundthe Internet is that you should send your cards to the Make A Wishfoundation in Atlanta, Georgia.<p>Other urban legends currently making their way around the Internetinclude a story that gangs are driving around at night with theirheadlights out and then shooting anyone who "flashes them" withtheir high beam headlights, and that there is a "virus" calledCD-IT that is eating the hard-drives of stupid people. The "lightsout" story may be true, but the police departments in Chicago,New York City, and Los Angeles all told me over the phone thatthe story was false (I called). The CD-IT story it true, butit is FOUR YEARS OLD!!!<p>I am going to share with you the number one rule for Internetdiscussion group survival: only post things that are relevantto the topic that the discussion group was created to discuss.The Craig Shergold story would have died a peaceful death yearsago if people had only remembered the "relevant posting" rule.<p>TOMORROW: Internet Security<p>HOMEWORK:<p>1)   If you are really interested in urban legends, there is a     Usenet newsgroup (alt.folklore.urban) that you should check     out.<p>2)   If you want to see a cute example of what a flame war really looks     like, my dad recently recorded a flame war on a relatively calm     Usenet group. That file is now on the LISTSERV file server at     the University of Alabama under the name FLAME WAR. Please feel     free to GET this file (see MAP02 for a review of the GET command).<p>FOR MORE INFORMATION:<p>     The November/December 1994 edition of Internet World magazine has     several good articles about Usenet.

It is vast, unmapped, culturally<br>      and legally ambiguous, verbally terse (unless you happen to<br>      be a court stenographer), hard to get around in, and up for<br>      grabs. Large institutions already claim to own the place,<br>      but most of the actual natives are solitary and independent,<br>      sometimes to the point of sociopathy. It is, of course, a<br>      perfect breeding ground for both outlaws and new ideas about<br>      liberty." -- John Perry Barlow, Crime and Puzzlement<p>I would love to tell you that the Internet is a safe place and thatthere is no reason for you to protect your password. Unfortunately,there are a LOT of people out there who would LOVE to break intoyour account and "use your account as a base for operations (1)."<p>How prevalent is this? According to Mike Godwin, Chief Legal Counselfor the Electronic Frontier Foundation, it's "fairly common." (1)<p>The only defense against people who want to break into your account --a.k.a. "crackers" -- is your password. Keep your password secure, andyou should never have anything to worry about. Give your password toothers, or write your password down and put it near your computer,and ... well, you get the picture.<p>There are some KEY points you need to remember to protect yourself andyour account:<p>     - <b>NEVER</b> give your password to *ANYONE* (1). The whole purpose       of having a password in the first place is to ensure that       *NO ONE* other than you can use your account.<p>     -<b> NEVER</b> write your password down, and especially never write       your password anywhere near your computer.<p>     - <b>NEVER</b> e-mail your password to anyone.<p>     -<b> DO</b> change your password on a regular basis (1). There is no better       way to thwart a would-be cracker than to change your password       as often as possible. Your local Internet service provider will       be able to tell you your system's recommendation on how often       you should change your password, but a good rule of thumb is       to change it at least every three months.<p>     -<b>DON'T</b> pick a password that is found in the dictionary (1). When       you set your password, it is encrypted and stored into a file.       It is really easy for a "cracker" to find your password by       encrypting every word in the dictionary, and then looking       for a match between the words in his encrypted dictionary       and your encrypted password. If he finds a match, he has your       password and can start using your account at will.<p>     -<b> DON'T</b> use passwords that are foreign words. The hacker can       get a foreign dictionary, and ...<p>     - <b>DON'T</b> choose a password that relates to you personally (2)       or that can easily be tied to you. Some good examples of BAD       passwords are: your name, your relatives' names, nicknames,       birthdates, license plate numbers, social security numbers (US),       work ID numbers, and telephone numbers.<p>     - <b>DO</b> use a password that is at least eight characters long and       that has a mix of letters and numbers. The minimum length of       a password should be four to six characters long.<p>The best passwords -- the ones that are the easiest for you toremember, and the ones that are the hardest for crackers to crack --are passwords that are like those fake words you used to create whenyou would cram for a test. For example, to remember that "the Lawof Demand is the inverse relationship between price and quantitydemanded," I created the word TLODITIRBP&QD. NO ONE could hack thatas a password. Best of all, its EASY to remember (well, its easyfor an economist to remember).<p>Here are a couple of other good passwords:<p>   In 1976 I moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma   -   I76IMTTO<p>   The conference lost 12,000 dollars   -   TCL12KD<p>   U of A Crimson Tide Football is #1   -   UACTFI#1<p>Sentences are EASY to remember, and they make passwords that are nearlyimpossible to break.<p>Finally, there is one last thing that I want to say before I close:I feel that "hacking" and "cracking" so violates the spirit of theInternet that I will do everything in my power to help put theovergrown babies who engage in such activities where they belong --behind bars. Until that time comes, however, I'm going to changemy password as often as possible.<p>HOMEWORK<p>     Contact your school system administrator, find out how you     can change your password, and CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD!!<p>SOURCES:<p>(1) from a telephone interview with Mike Godwin, Chief Legal Counsel    for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.<p>(2) comments from the Computer Law Association, as quoted in    Bottom Line Personal 6/1/94 p.8 (in edupage 5.22.92)<p>(3) quoted from edupage 06.09.94 (from a story in the Tampa Tribune    6/8/94 Baylife 5)<p> +----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+<br>:  PATRICK DOUGLAS CRISPEN   :  The views expressed in this letter do not  :<br>:   PCRISPE1@UA1VM.UA.EDU    :   necessarily represent the views of the    :<br>: THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA  :     University of Alabama - Tuscaloosa.     :<br>+----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+<br>:       Roadmap: Copyright Patrick Crispen 1994.

In the pastfew lessons, we have talked about communicating on a one-to-one basis(e-mail) and on a one-to-many basis (LISTSERV and Usenet).<p>In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to log in to other computers aroundthe world and take full advantage of the public programs and servicesthat these other computers offer.<p>There is some bad news, though. Some of you, especially a goodnumber of you with "level one" Internet access, do not have accessto TELNET. If this is true for you, please accept my apologies.I promise to make it up to you next week when I show you FileTransfer Protocol -- and besides, you can always take today's lessonand tomorrow's lesson and bug your school system administrator intooffering TELNET (you can also save this lesson for the daythat you do have TELNET access).<p>With TELNET, the commands that you type on your keyboard are sentfrom your terminal to your local Internet service provider, andthen from your provider to the remote computer that you haveaccessed. Unlike the LISTSERV commands that you sent last weekthat took CENTURIES to process (okay, a *slight* exaggeration),TELNET commands (usually) travel so fast that you can't eventell that you are using a remote computer.<p>So what can you do with this ability to log into remote computers?If your local Internet provider allows it, it is possible for youto TELNET into your account from another city and check your e-mailwhile you are on vacation or away on business. You can also TELNETinto huge databases to do research, or even TELNET into librariesaround the world to check if they have a certain book that youare looking for. TELNET also offers an easy entry into the worldof Gophers and the World Wide Web for those people who may nototherwise have access to these tools.<p>In MAP04: E-MAIL, I showed you that an Internet address for a user lookedsomething like: user@address. Well, since we are no longer interested in theperson -- we want to access the computer, not the person -- we can throw awayboth the "user" and the "@" part. All we care about now is the stuff *after*the @.<p>TELNET addresses look something like this:<p>     seabass.st.usm.edu    -   cybernet.cse.fau.edu     bbhost.hq.eso.org     -    fedworld.gov<p>Gee ... that's easy. You may also see TELNET addresses with numbersat the end of them. Those numbers are "port" numbers. Port numbersdon't have anything to do with hardware ports on the computer; insteadthey are (sort of) a way for you to tell the remote computer whichprogram or server you want it to pull up. A TELNET address with a portnumber allows you not only to access a remote computer, but to alsopull up a specific program or server on that remote computer (BTW, thestandard port number is port 23):<p>     seabass.st.usm.edu 23   -  cybernet.cse.fau.edu 2010     bbhost.hq.eso.org 6969   - fedworld.gov 4242<p>We seem to have the addresses down pat. Now for the fun stuff!<p>There are seven steps to a successful TELNET session. These stepsare all based on simple common sense, and I will explain them allin a minute. But first, here are the seven steps:<p><ul>     1. Start-up the TELNET program<br>     2. Give the TELNET program an address to connect to        (BTW, some really nifty TELNET packages allow you        to combine steps 1 and 2 into one simple step!)<br>     3. Make a note of what the "escape character" is<br>     4. Log in to the remote computer<br>     5. Set the "terminal emulation"<br>     6. Play around on the remote computer<br>     7. Quit<br></ul>Now let's talk about each of these steps. There are a lot of differentTELNET software programs around, but each of these programs operate onthe same basic principles. (BTW, my explanation may be a little"mainframe-y" but you will soon discover that you can easilytranslate my explanation so that you can use TELNET in Windowsor on a Macintosh).<p>Starting the TELNET program is easy. All most of you have to do istype the word TELNET on your command line, and the program willstart right up. If you are using Windows or a Macintosh (oran equivalent), double-click on the TELNET icon.<p>The second step is to give the TELNET program the address ofthe computer that you want to access. This is where the programsstart to differ. Some programs will automatically ask you to enterthe address of the remote host, but most won't. If your programdoes not automatically ask you for the address, you need to type<p>          open <site address> <port number><p>on the command line. For example, to get TELNET access toYALEINFO.YALE.EDU 7000, you would type OPEN YALEINFO.YALE.EDU 7000.(If you are using Windows or a Mac, the OPEN command may belocated on a pull-down menu). If you don't include the portnumber, TELNET will automatically assume that you want toconnect to port 23.<p>Remember when I said that some nifty TELNET programs allow youstart-up the TELNET program and access the address all in oneeasy step? Instead of doing the two steps I just went over, youmay be able to just type<p>          telnet <site address> <port number><p>on the command line (for example: TELNET YALEINFO.YALE.EDU 7000).<p>After you have told TELNET which computer you want it to access, andright before you gain access to the remote computer's login screen,you will see something like this:<p>     telnet YALEINFO.YALE.EDU 7000<p>     Trying 130.132.21.53 Port 7000 ...<p>     Connected to YALEINFO.YALE.EDU<p>     Escape character is ...<p>This tells you that your TELNET program is trying to access theYALEINFO.YALE.EDU 7000 address, gives the IP address for YALEINFO(remember those from MAP04?), tells you when you are connected,and gives you the escape character. REMEMBER THE ESCAPE CHARACTER!You are going to need it in a second :)<p>The next step is to log in to the remote computer. Everyone shouldknow how to log in to a computer by now ;)    <=== a winking smiley<p>If you are accessing a public site, the "login" -- the "password"that you need to access the remote computer -- will probably bepublicly known. For example, tomorrow I will send you a list ofseveral dozen TELNET sites, including their addresses and logins.Some public sites even TELL you what the login is when you TELNETto them! Heck, some TELNET sites are wide open and do not requirea login or password at all!!<p>The fifth step is to set the terminal emulation. All this means is thatyou are going to tell the remote site how data should be shown onyour screen. The most common terminal emulation setting is VT100,which is the standard for terminal-based communications.<p>If you do not have a VT100 terminal, or a terminal that can pretendits a VT100 terminal. you may have to set your terminal emulationto either your correct terminal type or, if you do not know youryour correct terminal type, to a "dumb" terminal emulation.<p>Fortunately, some TELNET sites automatically take care setting theterminal emulation for you, so you don't even have to worry aboutit.<p>If you end up with a screen full of gibberish, chances are you didnot use the correct terminal emulation setting. Your best bet if thishappens is to disconnect from the site and try again.<p>I think you can figure out the sixth step -- play around on theremote computer -- all by yourself :)<p>The final step is to quit. Some sites are nice and tell you how todo this, but most expect you to figure out how to quit on yourown. That is where the escape character comes in!<p>Remember that once you access the remote computer, every keystrokeof yours will be carried out not on your computer but on the remotecomputer! Typing the escape character (usually the control key and theright bracket key pressed at the same time) temporarily interruptsyour TELNET session and puts you into the TELNET command mode.<p>Once you are in the command mode, you can use a couple of commands:<p>     CLOSE   -    Closes your TELNET connection to the remote computer                 and either returns you to the command mode (if you                 started in the command mode) or quits TELNET.<p>     QUIT    -    Quits the TELNET program; if you are connected to                 a remote computer, QUIT will disconnect you from                 the remote computer and then quit TELNET.<p>     SET ECHO  -  If you can't see what you are typing, or if you                 type and see double, this command should take                 care of the problem<p>     <ENTER> -    (or <RETURN>) Pressing the enter or return key                 will take you out of TELNET command mode and                 return you to your TELNET session.<p>     OPEN   -     Opens a connection to a remote computer<p>So, if you are in the middle of a TELNET session and you decideto quit, you would type the escape character to enter the TELNETcommand mode, and then type the word QUIT.<p>One last thing and I will let you go: regular TELNET does notwork if you are trying to TELNET to an IBM 3270 mainframe computer.You'll have to use TN3270 instead. It works just like TELNET,only the keys on your keyboard may change a little (IBM usessomething called map3270 to lay out the keys, and IBM uses alot of function keys).<p>HOMEWORK<p><p>     Study this lesson carefully. Next lesson I am going to send     you a huge list of TELNET addresses, and turn you loose     to wreak havok on the Internet :)<p>     Also, a not-so-subtle hint: we just ended one section of     the workshop and entered a new one. What does the teacher     usually give you when a class section ends?<p>     Study hard >:)        <===== that's a devil smiley<p> +----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+<br>:  PATRICK DOUGLAS CRISPEN   :  The views expressed in this letter do not  :<br>:   PCRISPE1@UA1VM.UA.EDU    :   necessarily represent the views of the    :<br>: THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA  :     University of Alabama - Tuscaloosa.     :<br>+----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+<br>:       Roadmap: Copyright Patrick Crispen 1994.

I went through "The Internet Yellow Pages" and randomlypicked forty-one interesting telnet sites.<p>Before I turn you loose on the Internet, there are a few things Iwant to say:<p>     -  The listings give the site's address, and the password        required.

If this happens, just pick       another site.<p>     - Please remember that your local Internet service provider       only handles the *local* part of your service.

I hopethat you are having as much fun participating in this workshopas I am having teaching it! :)<p>Last lesson we used a tool called "Telnet" which allowed us to accessremote computers and run programs on those remote computers.<p>This week we are going to use a tool called "File Transfer Protocol"(or "FTP") which will allow us to access remote computers and retrievefiles from these computers. Actually, it is probably more accurateto say that we will be using "anonymous" FTP, but I'll explain thatin a minute.<p>What sort of files are available through FTP?  Well, "hundreds ofsystems connected to the Internet have file libraries, or archives,accessible to the public. Much of this consists of free or low-cost{computer} programs for virtually every make of computer. If youwant a different communications program for your IBM, or feel likeplaying a new game on your Amiga, you'll {probably} be able to get it{using FTP}."<p>"But there are also libraries of documents as well. If you want acopy of a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, you can {get a copyusing FTP}. Copies of historical documents, from the Magna Carta tothe Declaration of Independence are also yours for the asking ...You can also find song lyrics, poems, {and} even summaries ofevery {Animaniacs} episode ever made. You can also find extensivefiles detailing everything you could possibly want to know aboutthe Net itself" (1)<p>Before we get too in-depth into FTP, I think that now is as gooda time as any to quickly review the client/server relationshipthat I briefly mentioned in lesson three (MAP03: Levels of InternetConnectivity).<p>The "client" is just another word for a program running on yourservice provider's system that enables you to talk to, and getstuff from, distant computers. The client on your service provider'ssystem takes your commands and turns them into requests for informationfrom programs -- "servers" -- running on other, distant computers.<p>The client/server relationship allows you to TELNET into remotecomputers and run programs on those remote computers, and it alsoallows you to use FTP to get files from remote sites.<p>The client/server relationship is also what makes my job as an Internettrainer quite difficult. While all of the FTP clients out there do theexact same thing, they all use different commands to do it <<grumble>>.<p>Fortunately, if you can understand the basics of what happens duringan FTP session, the commands -- no matter what client software you areusing -- are pretty easy.<p>The basic steps in an FTP session are:<ul>     1. Start-up your FTP client<br>     2. Give your FTP client an address to connect to (and, just        like TELNET, step one and two can be combined into one        easy step).<br>     3. Identify yourself to the remote site<br>     4. Give the remote site your password<br>     5. Look around the directories for files<br>     6. Change directories<br>     7. Set the file transfer mode (optional)<br>     8. Get the file(s) you want<br>     9. Quit<br></ul>The best way to understand what is going on during an FTP session isto watch a sample FTP session. The University of Alabama's connectionto the Internet is through SURAnet (a large regional network), so I amgoing to FTP to them.<p>Before I do that, though, there are three things that I need toemphasize:<p>     1. FTP requires a heck of a lot of resources, both on your        system and on the remote system that you are accessing.        Because of this, FTP sessions should only be run during        non-working hours (usually 6 PM to 6 AM local).<p>        I realize that this constraint is going to be a difficult        for those of you who are reading this at work, and who only        have Internet (and FTP access) through your employer. However,        as "responsible Internet citizens" we have to remember that        the FTP sites are providing us FTP access out of the kindness        of their hearts. If we take advantage of this kindness, and        access various FTP sites during working hours, the FTP sites        may decide to close their doors to the public ... and then        EVERYONE loses.<p>     2. In light of what I said in #1, please do not flood SURAnet.        Later this week I will post a list of FTP sites that you        can visit (much like the TELNET list I posted previously).        Until I post that list, just sit back and enjoy the show :)<p>     3. Since this lesson is already over 100 lines long, I hope that        you won't mind if I break this FTP lesson into two lessons.        The first lesson will be today, and I'll finish tomorrow.        This will mean that we will end this lesson in the middle        of our sample FTP session, but it will also mean that this        lesson won't be the size of a small book by Gibbon :)<p>Starting an FTP session is pretty easy. For most of you, all youhave to do to start-up your FTP client is type<p>          ftp<p>on you system's command line (or, if you are in a Windows or Macenvironment, double-click on the FTP icon).<p>>From there, you would give the client an FTP address to connect to.<p>Like TELNET, however, there is a way to combine these two steps intoone, easy step. For most of you, to access your FTP client and giveyour client an address to hook into, all you would have to do ittype the command<p>          ftp <site address><p>and replace <site address> with the address of the FTP site that youwant your client software to access.<p>In our example, the SURAnet FTP address is ftp.sura.net, so I would type<p>          ftp ftp.sura.net<p>to start an FTP session. (Note that the second "ftp" is part ofSURAnet's FTP address. If I wanted to ftp to info.umd.edu, I wouldtype "ftp info.umd.edu"; if I wanted to ftp to lcs.mit.edu, I wouldtype "ftp lcs.mit.edu").<p>Once I hit the enter key, the following appears on my screen:<p>   ftp ftp.sura.net<br>   Connecting to ftp.sura.net 128.167.254.179, port 21<br>   220 nic.sura.net FTP server (Version wu-2.4(1) Fri May 20 10:20:58<br>   EDT 1994) ready.<br>   USER (identify yourself to the host):<p>The second line tells me that my system is connecting to ftp.sura.net(and even gives me the IP address for ftp.sura.net (remember the IPaddresses from MAP04: E-MAIL???)), the third line gives me someautomatic information from SURAnet, and the bottom line asks me tolog in.<p>If I had an account on the SURAnet system, I would enter my SURAnetuser ID. But, since I don't have an account on this system, I haveto find another way to access the system :)<p>This is where the "anonymous" FTP I mentioned earlier comes in :)One neat way to access some FTP sites -- at least those FTP sitesthat allow outside access -- is to use the userid "anonymous".By using the name "anonymous", you are telling that FTP site thatyou aren't a regular user of that site, but you would still like toaccess the FTP site, look around, and retrieve files.<p>So, where it says USER, I type the word<p>          anonymous<p>hit enter, and cross my fingers. If SURAnet does not allow anonymousaccess, I'm about to find out :)<p>My screen fills with some more automatic stuff from SURAnet:<p>   >>>USER anonymous<br>   331 Guest login ok, send your complete e-mail address as password.<br>   Password:<p>COOL! That second line means that SURAnet is going to let me in! AllI have to do now is give SURAnet a password.<p>Out of politeness to the FTP site, if you login as "anonymous", youneed to use your full Internet address as your password. This helpsthe FTP site keep track of who has visited its site.<p>So, since SURAnet wants my password, and since the password for anyanonymous FTP session is my full Internet address, I type<p>          pcrispe1@ua1vm.ua.edu<p>(Stop laughing -- p-crispy-one is *NOT* funny!!). Once I hit enter,my screen fills with more automatic stuff:<p>   >>>PASS ********<br>   230-    SURAnet ftp server running wuarchive experimental ftpd<br>   230-<br>   230-Welcome to the SURAnet ftp server.  If you have any problems with<br>   230-the server please mail the to systems@sura.net. If you do have  <br>            problems,<br>   230-please try using a dash (-) as the first character of your password<br>   230- -- this will turn off the continuation messages that may be confusing<br>   230-your ftp client.<br>   ...<br>   230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.<br>   Command:<p>Notice the line "Guest login ok, access restrictions apply." Thismeans that the site has given me access, but I only have access tothe files that are available to the general public.<p>Okay ... now what? I've started-up my FTP client, I've given the clientan FTP address to connect to, I've identified myself to the remote site(I told it that I am anonymous), and I've given the site my password.<p>Now it's time to see what sort of files and directories are around, andto get those files ... which we will do next lesson :)<p>HOMEWORK:<p>     1. See if you local Internet service provider has a handout        on FTP commands.<p>     2. If you do not have FTP access, please be patient. I'll        show you how to access FTP by e-mail in another lesson.<p>     3. There *WILL* be a pop quiz sometime this week, and        the quiz will cover lessons 1-10. Study :)<p>SOURCES:<p>(1) The "EFF's Guide to the Internet", reprinted by permission.<p> +----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+<br>:  PATRICK DOUGLAS CRISPEN   :  The views expressed in this letter do not  :<br>:   PCRISPE1@UA1VM.UA.EDU    :   necessarily represent the views of the    :<br>: THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA  :     University of Alabama - Tuscaloosa.     :<br>+----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+<br>:       Roadmap: Copyright Patrick Crispen 1994.

Quit<br></ul>I've accessed SURAnet's FTP site (ftp.sura.net), told the site thatI am "anonymous", and given the site my full Internet address asmy password.<p>Now that I'm in, I'm going to look around and see what the SURAnetFTP site has to offer.<p>On most FTP clients, the command to list the contents of the currentdirectory on the remote machine is just<p>          dir<p>(BTW, you can see a list of all of the acceptable commands foryour FTP client by typing "help")<p>My FTP client accepts and uses the "dir" command, so I type<p>          dir<p>and the following appears on my screen:<p>   >>>PORT 130,160,4,100,212,230<br>   200 PORT command successful<br>   >>>LIST<br>   150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for /bin/ls.<br>   total 728<p>   drwxrwx--x   3 0        0              512 Aug  5 01:55 bin<br>   drwxr-xr-x   2 0        1              512 May 10 12:47 etc<br>   drwxrwxrwx   6 0        10             512 Oct 21 11:37 incoming<br>   drwxr-xr-x   2 0        0             8192 Feb 15  1992 lost+found<br>   -rw-r--r--   1 0        1           350142 Oct 25 00:00 ls-lR<br>   drwxrwxr-r  24 0        100            512 May  3 13:25 pub<p>This is a listing of all of the stuff in the current directory.Let's take a look at the first entry and see if we can figure outwhat all of this means:<p>   drwxrwx--x   3 0        0              512 Aug  5 01:55 bin<p>If the line begins with a "-" instead of a "d", it is a file.The letter "d" at the beginning of this example tells me that thisis *not* a file -- it is a subdirectory.<p>What does *THAT* mean? Well, pretend that the FTP site is simplya big house. You walk into the house through the front door, andyou find yourself standing in an entry hall. The entry hall mayhave some neat stuff in it, but it also has doors leading to otherrooms throughout the house.<p>The subdirectories -- the "d"s -- are just doors to other "rooms"at the FTP site, and the files -- the "-"s -- are the neat stuffthat you can get while you are at the site.<p>Getting back to our example<p>   drwxrwx--x   3 0        0              512 Aug  5 01:55 bin<p>the "drwxrwx--x" tells us that this entry is a subdirectory (the"rwxrwx--x" part is just some security stuff). The "512" tellsus the size of the subdirectory in bytes.  The "Aug  5 01:55" tellsus the date and time that this subdirectory was last updated. Thelast part -- the "bin" -- tells us the name of the subdirectory.<p>Let's look at one more example:<p>   -rw-r--r--   1 0        1           350142 Oct 25 00:00 ls-lR<p>There is a "-" instead of a "d", so this is a file. The "350142"tells us that the size of this file is 350,142 bytes, the filewas last updated at midnight on October 25, and the name of thisfile is "ls-lR".<p>Finally, let's get back to the main SURAnet directory contents:<p>   drwxrwx--x   3 0        0              512 Aug  5 01:55 bin<br>   drwxr-xr-x   2 0        1              512 May 10 12:47 etc<br>   drwxrwxrwx   6 0        10             512 Oct 21 11:37 incoming<br>   drwxr-xr-x   2 0        0             8192 Feb 15  1992 lost+found<br>   -rw-r--r--   1 0        1           350142 Oct 25 00:00 ls-lR<br>   drwxrwxr-r  24 0        100            512 May  3 13:25 pub<p>I want to leave this main directory and get into a subdirectory.To change directories on most FTP clients, you use the command<p>          cd <directory><p>and replace <directory> with the name of the directory that youwant to access.<p>Since I am interested in public information, I'm going to getinto "pub" directory ("pub" is the standard FTP abbreviationfor "public"). I type<p>          cd PUB<p>and the following appears on my screen:<p>   >>>CWD PUB<br>   550 PUB: No such file or directory.<p>Uhhh ... what happened?<p>One of the unfortunate shortcomings of FTP is that, for most of you,FTP is *case sensitive*. My "cd PUB" command did not work becausethere is no "PUB" directory ... but there *IS* a "pub" directory :)<p>Let's try it again. I type<p>          cd pub<p>and the following appears on my screen:<p>   >>>CWD pub<br>   250 CWD command successful.Cool! It worked!<p>Now I need to see the contents of this new directory that I justentered. Do you remember what FTP command I should use? (Hint: it is"dir")<p>I type "dir", and the following appears on my screen:<p>   >>>PORT 130,160,4,100,215,140<br>   200 PORT command successful.<br>   >>>LIST<br>   150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for /bin/ls.<br>   Total 56<br>   -rw-rw-r--   1 1023     100           4052 Apr 22  1994 README<br>   drwxrwsr-x   2 1023     100            512 Aug  6  1993 SURAnet<br>   drwxrwxr-x   6 1020     120            512 Mar  3  1992 archie<br>   drwxrwxr-x   2 1034     120            512 Feb 15  1992 articles<br>   drwxrwxr-x   2 1007     110            512 Jun 22 15:40 books<br>   ... <<stuff deleted by me>><p>Whoa! That first file -- README -- looks pretty important. I betit contains some important information that will make my life awhole bunch easier (Good rule of thumb: if you see a file thatcontains the words README or INDEX, it is an important file).<p>I need to get this README file.<p>To get a file using FTP, you use the<p>          get <filename><p>command, replaing <filename> with the name of the file that youwant to get. The get command retrieves the file from the remotesite and stores the file on your service provider's system.<p>Since I want to get the README file, I type<p>          get README<p>(making sure to use the correct case), and the following appearson my screen:<p>   Invalid local filename; use 'name.type.mode' or 'name.type'<p>Now what?!?<p>This is a problem that some of you may have when you try to get"one word" files. Some local Internet service providers requirefiles stored on their machines to have some sort of extension ortype. Your can't have a file whose name is just README ... ithas to be README.<type> (ie. README.DOC, README.TXT, etc).<p>Since the "get README" command did not work, I'm going to have touse the<p>          get <filename> <name I want it saved as><p>command, replacing <remote file name> with README, and replacing<name I want it saved as> with the name that I want the file tobe saved as on my service provider's computer.<p>So, I type<p>          get README README.DOC<p>and the following appears on my screen:<p>   >>>PORT 130,160,4,100,218,90<br>   200 PORT command successful.<br>   >>>RETR README<br>   150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for README (4502 bytes).<p>After a few additional seconds, the following is added to my screen:<p>   226 Transfer complete.<br>   4637 bytes transferred. Transfer rate 6.14 Kbytes/sec.<p>YIPEE! It worked!! Let's quit FTP and take a look at the file thatI just got.<p>To quit ftp, you need to use either the "bye" or "quit" commands.<p>On my client, the command is "quit", so I type<p>          quit<p>and the following appears on my screen:<p>   221 Goodbye.<br>   Ready; T=0.54/0.96 01:45:53<p>Okay ..

It is sitting on myaccount on my service provider's system!<p>Depending on your system, it is either easy or hard to get intothe files that get from FTP (in Unix, type "ls"; in VM, type "fl").Your local Internet service provider can tell you a little moreabout how to access, read, and print these files.<p>Looking at this new file that I just got from FTP, I discover thatthe contents of the README file are a brief explanation of what isin every subdirectory off of the pub directory (cool!):<p>   The following items are available anonymous ftp from   ftp.sura.net:<p>   Directories found under pub:<p>   archie/          Information on the archie service as well as client                    software to use archie.   articles/        Text versions of articles in the SURAnet newsletter.   books/           Subdirectory containing information on ordering                    discounted books through SURAnet.   databases/       The databases in raw format that are also offered                    through our WAIS server.   dns/             Software and documentation to help setup the Domain                    Name Server software on Unix machines (BIND)   fdic/            The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's ftp                    archive.   ... <<stuff deleted by me>>NEAT! :)<p>I want to go back and get one of the articles in the SURAnet newsletter.Thanks to what I learned from the README file, I now know that thefiles that I am looking for are in "pub" directory and in the"articles" subdirectory.<p>In FTP notation, I can write this as<p>          /pub/articles<p>This means the same thing as saying "in the pub directory, inthe articles subdirectory" and, as you will soon see, this notationwill eventually even save me a few steps.<p>Let's go back to SURAnet and get some newsletter articles!<p>I type<p>          ftp ftp.sura.net<p>and the following appears on my screen:<p>   Connecting to ftp.sura.net 128.167.254.179, port 21<br>   220 nic.sura.net FTP server (Version wu-2.4(1) Fri May 20 10:20:58<br>   EDT 1994) ready.<br>   USER (identify yourself to the host):<p>Since I do not have an account on the SURAnet machine, I type<p>          anonymous<p>and the following appears on my screen:<p>   >>>USER anonymous<br>   331 Guest login ok, send your complete e-mail address as password.<br>   Password:<br>I type my full Internet address -- pcrispe1@ua1vm.ua.edu -- as<br>my password, and the following appears on my screen:<br>   >>>PASS ********<br>   230-    SURAnet ftp server running wuarchive experimental ftpd<br>   230-<br>   230-Welcome to the SURAnet ftp server.

AFTER THIS LESSON WE WILL DISCUSS FTP FILECOMPRESSION/DECOMPRESSION, AND ON FRIDAY WE WILL DISCUSS ARCHIE (AND I WILLGIVE YOU A *HUGE* LIST OF FTP SITES THAT YOU CAN VISIT).<h4>MAP15: FTPMAIL</h4><br>     "The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of      everyday thinking." -- Albert Einstein, Out of My Later Years<p>Before we get to ftpmail, there are a few other things that Iwant to discuss.<p>Last time I showed you how to retrieve a text file using FTP.But how can a text file written on an IBM be read on an AppleMacintosh or on a Unix workstation? Its easy -- thanks to somethingcalled ASCII.<p>ASCII is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange,and it is the standard format for transmitting textual data.*Any* computer can read an ASCII text file. Without going tooin-depth into how ASCII works, let's just say that ASCII ensuresthat the text in an ASCII text file will appear the same on anycomputer regardless of the computer's brand name or operatingsystem.<p>ASCII is fine and dandy for saving and transferring text files,but it won't work with non-text, data files -- like computerprograms. Data files must be saved in "Binary".<p>Binary files are files that can only run on certain machinesor programs. Good examples of Binary files include sharewaresoftware, Microsoft Word files, Microsoft Powerpoint presentations,satellite weather images, and sound files.<p>Remember, ASCII files are just 'plain' text files that can beread on any computer, and Binary files are files that can onlybe run on certain computers or programs.<p>The default transfer mode in FTP is ASCII. This means thatunless you tell FTP to do otherwise, all of your files willautomatically be transferred in ASCII format. If you try toretrieve a Binary file using FTP without first resetting thetransfer mode, your Binary file will be transferred in ASCIIand the file *WILL NOT WORK* once you get it.<p>Fortunately, changing the transfer mode in FTP is easy. All thatmost of you have to do to change the FTP transfer mode from ASCIIto Binary is type<p>          binary<p>right before you get the file, and the file will be transferred toyou in Binary format.<p>To change back to ASCII transfer mode, just type<p>          ascii<p>and FTP will reset its transfer mode to ASCII.<p>If you ever forget what transfer mode you are currently using --something that I do *ALL* of the time -- all you need to do istype<p>          status<p>and your computer will display a whole bunch of information,including your transfer mode :)<p>BTW, how can you tell if a file is an ASCII file or a Binaryfile? Well, take a look at the extensions (remember, an extensionis the stuff at the end of the file name -- the extension forCRISPEN.DOC is .DOC; the extension for SQUIRREL.TXT is .TXT).If the file's extension is .doc or .txt, or if the file doesnot have an extension, it is a good bet that the file is anASCII text file. If the file has a weird extension -- like .gifor .zip -- it is a good bet that the file is a Binary file.There are, of course, always exceptions to this rule.<p>The "duck theory" also works pretty well in determining if afile is an ASCII or Binary file. The duck theory says that ifit looks like a duck, waddles like a duck, swims like a duck,quacks like a duck, and is seen hanging around with otherducks ... it is probably a duck.<p>Using the duck theory to determine if a file is an ASCII orBinary file, you can safely assume that if you have a file thatlooks like a ASCII text file and is seen in the same directoryas other ASCII text files, you can safely assume that the filethat you are looking at is, in reality, a DUCK :)<p>(First squirrels ... now ducks ... this workshop is getting to me)<p>MULTIPLE FILE TRANSFERS:<p>How can you transfer multiple files at the same time? Simple! Usethe "mget" (multiple get) command!<p>Let's say that I want to get every file in a particular directorywith the word "duck" in it. I would type<p>          mget duck*<p>The * (a.k.a. "splat") is a "wild card" that tells the client toget every file that begins with the word "duck" and that hasany additional characters after the word "duck".<p>The best way to explain wildcards is to give you an example. Let'spretend that I have a directory with the following files in it:<p>     duckreport.doc          ducket.exet<br>     duck1.txt               duck2.txt<br>     ducksoup                duck.gif<p>Where I place the wildcard in my mget command will determinewhat files I get:<p>     mget command:         files it would retrieve:<p>     mget duck*            duckreport.doc; ducket.exe; duck1.txt;<br>                           duck2.txt; ducksoup; duck.gif<br>     mget duck*.txt        duck1.txt; duck2.txt<br>     mget duck.*           duck.gif<p>Before you continue on, take a minute and try to figure out whyeach of the mget commands retrieved different files. If you canfigure it out -- and believe me folks, this is EASY -- you willbe a master of the mget command :)<p>FTPMAIL:<p>If your local Internet service provider does not have an FTPclient, you can still get FTP files by using a tool calledftpmail!<p>The steps in a basic ftpmail session are pretty easy:<p>     1. Write an e-mail letter to an ftpmail site near        you, and put the necessary ftpmail commands        in the BODY of your letter.<br>     2. The ftpmail site will write you back and tell you that        it has received your request, and will tell you the        number of requests ahead of yours (I still think that        the number that they give you is just a random, large        number (but I am probably mistaken)).<br>     3. A day or two later -- yes, I said "day" -- the ftpmail        system will e-mail you the file that you requested.        The ftpmail system will also send you a copy of the        "transaction" as it occurred between ftpmail and the        remote FTP site (this transaction will look a lot        like the examples in yesterday's lesson).<p>Today, I am going to show you how to get ASCII text files usingftpmail. We'll talk about Binary files tomorrow.<p>The first step is finding an ftpmail site near you. ftpmailwas developed at the Digital Western Research Laboratory, andtheir ftpmail address -- ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com -- is the mostwidely known (and widely used) ftpmail address in the world.Unfortunately, because of the traffic that this site sees, thedecwrl address is also sometimes the slowest ftpmail site inthe world :(   <--- a frowning smiley<p>There are other ftpmail servers around the world that may becloser to you, and that may actually be faster that the decwrladdress:<ul>          Australia     - ftpmail@cs.uow.edu.au<br>          France        - ftpmail@grasp.insa-lyon.fr<br>          Germany       - ftpmail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de<br>          Great Britain - ftpmail@doc.ic.ac.uk<br>          Ireland       - ftpmail@ieunet.ie<br>          Sweden        - ftpmail@lth.se<br>          USA           - ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu<br>          USA           - ftpmail@ftp.uu.net<br>          USA           - ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com<br>  </ul>        Once you have found a site closest to you, you are ready to startsending commands to the ftpmail address! The commands, just likeall of the LISTSERV commands that I drilled into your head earlierin the workshop, need to be in the BODY of your e-mail letter.<p>The body of you letter to the ftpmail site will actually have SEVERALcommands in it. The basic FTPmail commands are, in order:<p>       reply <your Internet address><br>          This tells ftmail where to send the file(s) to.<p>       connect <ftp site address><br>          This tells ftpmail the site that you want it to<br>          connect to.<p>       <transfer mode><br>          This tells ftpmail if you want the files in ASCII or<br>          binary<p>       chdir <directory><br>          This tells ftpmail in which directory the file that we want<br>          is located.<p>       get <filname><br>          This tells ftpmail to get a specific file.<p>               quit<br>          Ends the ftpmail session<p>Yesterday, we ftp'd to ftp.sura.net, got into the /pub/articlesdirectory, and got the file fall91.issue<p>To do this using ftpmail, I need to send an e-mail a letter toftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu (or to any other ftpmail site), and thebody of my letter would look like this:<p>          reply pcrispe1@ua1vm.ua.edu<br>          connect ftp.sura.net<br>          ascii<br>          chdir /pub/articles<br>          get fall91.issue<br>          quit<br>A day or two after I send this letter to the ftpmail address,I should see the file sitting in my e-mail box. Notice that Isaid "should." The traffic at the various ftpmail sites isoften incredible, and sometimes requests get lost. If thishappens to you, you should just send your request again :)<p>TOMORROW:<p><ul>  - FTP File Compression/Decompression<br>           - Binary files via ftpmail<br>           - A few more ftpmail commands (ie. chunksize).<br></ul>HOMEWORK:<p>     1.

As the numbers of files that are availablethrough ftp increases daily, ftp sites are actively lookingfor ways to squeeze more files into a limited amount of space.<p>The ftp sites accomplish this by using file compression.<p>The good news is that a compressed file takes up a lot less spaceon the ftp site's computer. The bad news is that a compressed fileis absolutely useless until you uncompress it.<p>Wait ... it gets worse. Before you can uncompress a file, you haveto know what compression method was used to compress the file inthe first place. Unfortunately, there is no one standard ftp filecompression method -- there are HUNDREDS of different file compressionmethods in use today :(<p>If you have to know what compression method was used before youcan uncompress a file, how are you ever going to figure out whichmethod was used? Well, it is actually pretty easy:<p>     1. Most ftp directories have a READ.ME file that shows an        index of all the files that are in that directory. Some        really nice ftp sites have expanded READ.ME files that        include a mention about what compression method was used        and where you can get a free copy of the software needed        to uncompress the files.<p>     2. Look at the files' extensions. By looking at the extensions        and comparing them to the chart below, you will be able to        determine what compression method was used and what particular        software is needed to uncompress the file.<p>Fortunately, most uncompression software is either public domain (meaningthat it is completely free) or shareware (meaning that you can get a copyof it for free, but the author expects you to send him some money for theprogram if you decide to keep it and use it). Best of all, mostuncompression software is available through ftp! :)<p>The list below shows some of the most popular extensions that youare bound to encounter during your visits to ftp sites around theworld. It also shows transfer modes needed to retrieve files withthese extensions, what uncompress software package you need toto uncompress the files after you retrieve them, and it even givessome additional comments about each of the extensions.<p>Paraphrasing something I said in MAP01, I want you to be awarethat the one compression method that isn't listed below is goingto be the one compression package that you ADORE. Please do nottake this personally. There are literally HUNDREDS of compressionmethods in use today, and there is no way that I can list allof them.<p>SUGGESTION: Save the following list, and use it as a reference toolfor when you encounter an extension that you have never seen before :)Also, please notice that the following list talks about "archie".Archie is an FTP search tool that we will discuss tomorrow.<p>(the following list was adapted from "The EFF's Guide to the Internet"by Patrick Crispen)<p>.txt or .TXT -  ASCII  <br>               By itself, this means the file is                                     a document rather than a program,                                     and does not need to be uncompressed<p>.ps or .PS   -  ASCII   <br>              A PostScript document (in Adobe's                                     page description language).

(Be careful, though: .doc                                     and .DOC extensions are also used for                                     Microsoft Word documents (which are                                     Binary files).

The Net moves data at phenomenal rates of speed.  But that 500,000-byte file that gets transferred to your host system in a few secondscould take more than an hour or two to download to your computer ifyou're using a 2400-baud modem.  Your host system may also have limits onthe amount of bytes you can store online at any one time.  Also, althoughit is really extremely unlikely you will ever get a file infected with avirus, if you plan to do much downloading over the Net, you'd be wise toinvest in a good anti-viral program, just in case." (1)<p>FTPMAIL AND BINARY FILES<p>Yesterday, I showed you that it is possible to get get ftp filesusing e-mail by sending an e-mail letter to one of the followingaddresses<p>          Australia     - ftpmail@cs.uow.edu.au<br>          France        - ftpmail@grasp.insa-lyon.fr<br>          Germany       - ftpmail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de<br>          Great Britain  - ftpmail@doc.ic.ac.uk<br>          Ireland       - ftpmail@ieunet.ie<br>          Sweden        - ftpmail@lth.se<br>          USA           - ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu<br>          USA           - ftpmail@ftp.uu.net<br>          USA           - ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com<p>with the following commands in the body of your e-mail letter<p>          reply <your Internet address><br>          connect <ftp site address><br>          <transfer mode><br>          chdir <directory><br>          get <filname><br>          quit<p>Before I introduce you to the new stuff, there are a couple ofthings that I want to review with you.<p>First, the<p>          reply <your Internet address><br>command tells the ftpmail address where you want the file sent.If you use the example that I gave you yesterday<p>          reply pcrispe1@ua1vm.ua.edu<br>          connect ftp.sura.net<br>          ascii<br>          chdir /pub/articles<br>          get fall91.issue<br>          quit<p>without changing the reply address, ftpmail is going to send thefile to *ME*, not to you :)<p>Please remember to change the reply line to include *YOUR*Internet e-mail address.<p>Also, I did not mention this yesterday, but ftpmail limitsyou to only one CHDIR command per letter.<p>Finally, yesterday I asked you to contact you local Internetservice provider to see if they placed any size limits onfile transfers. If they do, there is an additional commandthat you need to add to your list of commands<p>          chunksize <size><p>This command will break the files into chunks that yoursystem can handle. If your system has a 50,000 characterlimit on messages from the Internet, your chunksize<p>command should be          chunksize 49000<p>(you want to make sure that you set your chunksize below whatyour system's limits are). This command will break your fileinto 49,000 character chunks, and will then send the chunksto you :)<p>You already now how to retrieve ASCII text files using ftpmail.Today, I am going to show you how to retrieve Binary files usingftpmail.<p>Binary file transfers using ftpmail aren't difficult ... theyjust require a few additional steps. Because all e-mail has tobe in ASCII form, ftpmail has to encode your Binary file inASCII before it can e-mail the file to you. Once you get thefile, you can then decode the file back into Binary :)<p>Fortunately, there are two ways that ftpmail can encode Binaryfiles into ASCII. The first way it can do this is through somethingcalled "uuencode." As long as you have a uudecode program -- anduudecode programs are all over the place (chances are your sitehas uudecode stored on its system) -- the whole process is simple.<p>The second encoding type that you can use is called "btoa" (binaryto ascii). Your local Internet service provider will be able totell you a little more about btoa.<p>So, to get ASCII files using ftpmail, you would use the followingcommands in the body of your letter to the ftpmail address:<p>          reply <your Internet address><br>          connect <ftp site address><br>          ascii<br>          chdir <directory><br>          chunksize <size><br>          get <filname><p>and to get Binary files using ftpmail, you would use the followingcommands in the body of your letter to the ftpmail address:<p>          reply <your Internet address><br>          connect <ftp site address><br>          <uuencode or btoa><br>          chdir <directory><br>          <encoding type><br>          chunksize <size><br>          get <filname><p>TOMORROW: - ARCHIE          - A *HUGE* LIST OF FTP SITES THAT YOU CAN VISIT<p>HOMEWORK<p>     Take a break.

However, beforewe can retrieve a file, we have to know where the file is located!<p>Wouldn't it be great if there was some sort of "search" programthat would look through hundreds of different anonymous ftpsites and tell us where all of the files that we want arelocated?<p>Well, such a search program exists. It is called "Archie".<p>Archie is actually a collection of servers. Each of theseservers is responsible for keeping track of file locationsin several different anonymous ftp sites. All of the archieservers talk to each other, and they pool their informationinto a huge, global database that is periodically updated.<p>"The archie catalog subsystem maintains a list of about 1200Internet anonymous ftp archive sites of approximately 2.5million unique filenames themselves containing 200 Gigabytes(that is, 200,000,000,000 bytes) of information. The currentcatalog requires about 400 MB of disk storage."

Well, this tells me the address ofthe anonymous ftp site is<p>     theory.lcs.mit.edu<p>the directory that the file is located in is<p>     /pub/areaii<p>and the name of the file is<p>     roadmap.ps<p>Archie doesn't retrieve the file for me, but it does tellme exactly where the file that I am looking for is located.Once I know the file's location (and its filename), retrievingthe file using ftp is easy!<p>There are three ways that you can access archie:<p>     1. through an archie client running on your local Internet        service provider's system,     2. through a telnet connection directly to an archie server, or     3. by sending an e-mail letter directly to an archie server.The load on all of the archie servers is incredible. If your sitehas its own archie client, you should use that client instead oftelnetting or e-mailing to a distant archie server.<p>To find out if your site is running its own archie client, typethe word<p>          archie<p>and see what happens. If you don't get an error message, you cansafely assume that your site has its own archie client :)<p>To actually conduct an archie search using your site's archieclient, type<p>          archie <searchterm><p>replacing <searchterm> with what you want the client to searchfor. For example:<p>     What you want archie          What you should     to search for                 type     --------------------          ---------------     files and directories         archie squirrel     that have the word     "squirrel" in their     titles     files that have the           archie .win32     extension .win32ACCESSING ARCHIE BY TELNET<p>The following are a few of the archie servers that you can accessusing telnet.

Adams<p>When I was in elementary school, I was a rather "spirited" child.I remember constantly asking my teachers why I had to learn longdivision when I could just as easily use a calculator to come upwith the answer.<p>Needless to say, may parents heard from my teachers ... often.<p>What does this story have to do with this lesson? Well, I amproud to announce that we have just finished learning the "longdivision" of the Internet (FTP).<p>In this lesson we are going to start using the "calculator" of theInternet -- a client/server package called "Gopher".<p>Gopher was developed at the University of Minnesota, and it isa menu-driven application that allows you to hop around the globelooking for information. Gopher's interconnected menus allow youto "burrow" deeper and deeper until you find the information thatyou are looking for.<p>Imagine that I decide to gather together all of the informationthat I can find about power line-chomping squirrels, and I putthat information into a menu-driven library. Also imaginethat someone else who is interested in the uses of yak furcreates a menu-driven yak fur library.<p>If these two menu-driven libraries are interconnected, anyone whohas access to my squirrel library will also have access to theyak fur library (and vice versa).<p>Now imagine if THOUSANDS of these specialized libraries wereinterconnected. That is what Gopher does, and all of theseinterconnected Gopher libraries make up what is called"Gopherspace."<p>Think of Gopherspace as being a huge stadium filled with informationon a myriad of different topics. If you have ever been to a majorsporting event, you will remember that your ticket to that eventtold you which gate you had to pass through to enter the stadium.<p>Once you entered the stadium, however, you were free to roam around,buy a hot dog, and make fun of the opponent's fans. You had access toEVERYTHING in that stadium, regardless of which gate you enteredthrough.<p>Gopherspace is set up the same way. Your "gate" is the client thatyou use to enter Gopherspace. Once are in, however, you are freeto roam around and take advantage of everything that is inside the"stadium".<p>Why is Gopher so special? Well, unlike Archie which just tellsyou where the information that you want can be found, Gopher actuallygoes out, GETS the information that you want, and puts the informationon your computer screen! (You could even say that Gopher actually"goes fer" the information that you want).<p>A TOUR OF GOPHERSPACE<p>I'll explain Gopher access and Gopher commands tomorrow. Today, Iwant to take you on a little tour of "Gopherspace."<p>We are going to start our tour at GOPHER.SQUIRREL.COM -- a gophersite that I have totally made up for this tour. Remember, itdoes not matter where you start -- as long as you are inGopherspace, you have access to the same information that everyoneelse has.<p>When you access your Gopher client, you will start out in yourclient's "root menu". Each root menu is different, but they allhave the same basic stuff.<p>I am going to be using a UNIX Gopher client for today's tour.As I said earlier, we'll talk a little more about the commandstomorrow, but for now I want you to remember two things:<p>     1. Your site's root menu will be different from my example.<p>     2. In a UNIX Gopher client menu, the symbols at the end of        each menu item tell you what that menu item is. The        following guide will help you decipher the symbols:<p>           <b>/</b>   -  gateways to other menu options<br>            <b> .</b>   -  text, graphic, or program files<br>            <b> <?></b>  - requests you can make to a database                   for information<br>           <b>  <CSO></b> - phonebook requests you can make to                   a database for information<p>Also, in a UNIX Gopher client the --> selects which menu item you wantto enter. You move the --> up and down by using the up and down arrows,and you select the menu item by using the enter key.<p>With that said, let's begin the tour! Our tour starts on theGOPHER.SQUIRREL.COM root menu:<p>             <center>  Root gopher server: gopher.squirrel.com<p></center><ul>      --> 1.   Information about the Squirrel Gopher Server.<br>          2.   What's new in the Squirrel Gopher.<br>          3.   Network Resources, Services and Information/<br>          4.

Local Squirrel Archives/<br>          8.   Other Gopher and Information Servers around the World/</ul>I move the --> up and down by using the up and down arrows. When Ifinally find a menu item that I want to select, I put the -->next to that menu item and press the enter key.<p>Since the first menu item -- "Information about the Squirrel GopherServer" -- is a file (it has a "." at the end of it), let's see ifwe can get into it!<p>I move the cursor up to "Information about the Squirrel GopherServer," press enter, and the following appears on my screen:<p>               WELCOME TO THE SQUIRREL.COM GOPHER SERVER<p>     The SQUIRREL.COM gopher was created by Patrick "P-Crispy-One" Crispen     to serve as a repository for more information about squirrels than     anyone could ever possibly want to know.<p>     While you are here, please check out our special Sally Struthers     menu which contains ...<p>COOL! Unlike ftp, Gopher allows us to read files before we GETthem! That's going to save us a whole bunch of time! :)<p>Let's go back to the root menu and start a REAL journey.I'm going to take you to a site we visited just the other day --SURAnet!<p>So I go back to the root menu:<p>                      <center>Root gopher server: gopher.squirrel.com</center><p><ul>          1.

Other Gopher and Information Servers around the World/</ul>I want to visit other Gopher sites around the world, so I usethe down arrow to move the cursor down to "Other Gopher andInformation Servers around the World", press enter, and watch asthe following appears on my screen:<p>               <center>Other Gopher and Information Servers around the World</center><p><ul>          1.

This is COOL!<p>This menu allows me to access Gophers all over the world! I'm goingto have to remember this.<p>Let's keep today's tour close to (my) home. I move the cursor down to"North America", hit enter, and the following appears on my screen:<p>                                   <center> North America</center><p><ul>          1.

I move the cursor down to the "USA" menu, press enter,and a new menu appears on my screen:<p>                                          <center>USA</center><p><ul>      --> 1.

Yep -- one for each of the 50 states, one forWashington, D.C., one for "All", and one for "General".<p>I feel like an adventure. I move the cursor up to the "All" menu, pressenter, prop my feet up, and wait for the following new menu to appearon my screen:<p>                                        <center>  All</center><p><ul>          1.  1994 California Voter information/<br>          2.

That is whyI spent all last week teaching you ftp)<p>Last week we used ftp to get the file fall91.issue from theSURAnet ftp site. Let's see if we can do the same thing usingGopher!<p>I move the cursor down to "FTP gateway link to ftp.sura.net", pressenter, and the following menu appears on my screen:<p>                         <center> FTP gateway link to ftp.sura.net</center><p><ul>          1.

We did not have to use any weird commands (all we        used was the up and down arrows, and the enter key).<br>     2. We were able to see a directory of every menu we passed through,        and we never had to type DIR.<br>     3. We were able to read the fall91.issue file without having        to GET the file, and without having to leave the Gopher        program.</ul>Tomorrow, we'll talk about Gopher commands :)<p>HOMEWORK<p>     Divide 14,682 by 269 ... by hand (I'm kidding).     BTW ...

<!doctype html public "-//W30//DTD W3 HTML 2.0//EN"><HTML><!-- OWNER_NAME="Davis County School District" --><LINK rev=made href="mailto:www@cc.davis.k12.ut.us"><!-- OWNER_INFO="45 E State St Farmington UT 84025" --><HEAD><TITLE>Internet Roadmap </TITLE></HEAD><BODY><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="roadmap.gif" ALT="ROADMAP"><br><p><h4>MAP19: GOPHER (PART TWO)</h4><br>     "Nothing quite new is perfect." -- Cicero, Brutus<p>There are three ways to enter Gopherspace:<p><ul>     1. through a Gopher client running on your local Internet service        provider's machine,<br>     2. through a telnet connection to a publicly-accessible Gopher        site, or<br>     3. through e-mail (we'll talk about e-mail access on the         next lesson).</ul>How can you tell if your local Internet service provider has a Gopherclient that you can use? Easy! Just type<p>          <center>gopher</center>at your system's command prompt, and watch what happens. If your providerhas a Gopher client, your Gopher client's root menu will appear on yourscreen.<p>If your site does *not* have a Gopher client, however, all you willsee on your screen after you type "gopher" will be an error message.<p>Fortunately, if you can't access Gopher through your local provider,you can always access Gopher through telnet. The following isa list adapted from the Gopher FAQ (1) and it lists the telnetaddresses and logins for just a few of the publicly accessibleGopher sites:<p>   <b> North America</b><br>     consultant.micro.umn.edu<br>      ux1.cso.uiuc.edu      <br>     panda.uiowa.edu         <br>     gopher.msu.edu          <br>    <b>Europe </b><br>     gopher.ebone.net   <br>      <b> Sweden</b><br>    gopher.sunet.se   <br>     <b> Australia</b><br>     info.anu.edu.au    <br>        <b>South America </b><br>     tolten.puc.cl        <br>    <b>Ecuador</b><br>     ecnet.ec             <br>     <b>Japan</b><br>     gan.ncc.go.jp        <br>   Please use the site that is closest to you. Also, if you are inNorth America, please remember that the consultant.micro.umn.eduaddress is the most used Gopher address in the entire world(this is the address of the University of Minnesota's Gopherserver -- the birthplace of Gopher). You might be better offif you telnetted to another North American site.<p>Also, if your site is running its own Gopher client software, itis *STRONGLY* recommended that you use your site's Gopher clientsoftware instead of telneting into the public logon sites. Yourclient is set up so that you can use custom features not availablethrough a telnet connection (i.e. mouse, scroll bars, etc.). Youwill also find that your provider's Gopher client will run muchfaster than a telnet Gopher client (1).<p>DIRECT CLIENT ACCESS TO REMOTE GOPHERS<p>As I said above, to access your root Gopher menu, all that youhave to do is type<p>          <center>gopher</center>at your system's command prompt.<p>Sometimes, however, you may want to bypass your own root menu andconnect directly to a remote Gopher server. You can do this bytyping<p>          <center>gopher <site address></center>at your system's command prompt, replacing <site address> with thethe address of the remote Gopher server that you want to access.<p>For example, to connect directly with the info.asu.edu GopherI would type<p>          <center>gopher info.asu.edu</center>at my system's command prompt.<p>LOCAL VERSUS DISTANT INFORMATION<p>Spend any amount of time in Gopherspace, and you are bound to runinto roadblocks. The most common roadblock that you will encounteris an error message that says<p>          Empty Menu; no items selected or nothing available<p>when you try to access a file or menu that you *KNOW* exists (andthat you may have even accessed just a few seconds earlier).<p>One of the biggest mistakes that people make is they assumethat this "Empty Menu" error is a problem with their localInternet service provider's system. IT ISN'T!!<p>Your local Internet service provider is only responsible for theLOCAL portion of your Internet service. If you are having problemsaccessing a distant Gopher file or menu, your problem isn'twith your local provider, it is with the distant site thatyou are trying to access!<p>There are two things that you need to keep in mind any timeyou are having problems with Gopher:<p><ul>     1. Gopherspace is incredibly dynamic. Sites "appear" and        and "disappear" every second of every day. Internet        traffic, power outages, weather, scheduled repairs,        and even squirrels affect whether a site is on-line        or off-line.<br>     2. Sites can "disappear" for as little as a second or        they can shut down and disappear forever. If you        are having problems accessing something in Gopherspace,        wait a little while and try to access it later.</ul>UNIX GOPHER COMMANDS<p>Once you access your Gopher client (or telnet into a Gopher client),take a look at the bottom of the root menu. If you see a menu linethat says<p>          Press ? for Help, q to Quit, u to go up a menu<p>You are using a UNIX Gopher client.<p>Fortunately, the on-line help menu for the UNIX Gopher is reallygood. If you type<p>          <center>?</center><p>your screen will fill with a whole bunch of UNIX Gopher commands.<p>I'm not going to show you all of these commands -- you can findthem pretty easily by typing "?" -- but I do want to show youa few of the most important commands that you will use:<p>     <b>Up arrow</b>                -   Moves the --> cursor up one line<br>    <b> Down arrow </b>             -   Moves the --> cursor down one line<br>    <b> Right arrow or Return </b>             -  "Enters" the selected menu item<br>          <b> Left arrow or u </b>             -  "Exits" the item and returns you to                     -   the previous menu<br><p>After you have entered a file and have gotten to the bottom of it,the following menu bar appears<p>   Press <RETURN> to continue, <m> to mail, <s> to save, or <p> to print<p>Pressing "return" will just take you back to the previous menu. Ifyou want a copy of the file, you are going to have to either press"m" or "s".<p>If you are telnetting into a Gopher client, or if the file is small,your best bet would be to type "m". The client will then ask youfor an address you want the current document mailed to. Enter yourfull Internet e-mail address :)<p>OTHER GOPHER CLIENT COMMANDS<p>There are a whole bunch of different Gopher clients out there.Fortunately, they all work on the same basic principles, andthey all have relatively good on-line help menus.<p>Access your Gopher client, take a look at your help menu, andfind the keys or commands necessary to:<p>     - Move the cursor up and down the screen<br>     - "Enter" files (select an item)<br>     - "Exit" files (go back to the previous menu)<br>     - Quit the program<p>We'll talk about some of the more advanced commands later thisweek :)<p>HOMEWORK:<p><ul>     1. Enter Gopherspace and play around :)<br>     2. If you REALLY feel daring, you might want to find        Richard Smith's "Navigating the Internet: Let's Go        Gophern" workshop archives. The workshop was a one-month        workshop which taught nothing but Gopher :)<br>        The following are some Gopher sites that I found that        have the "Gophern" archives. You'll have to access        these sites directly -- type "gopher <site address>" --        and then hunt around the site for the "Gophern" files.</ul>        gopher-chem.ucdavis.edu <br>                   gopher.kfki.hu<br>        ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu  <br>                    gopher2.nhm.ac.uk<br>        rc1.vub.ac.be          <br>                    wealaka.okgeosurvey1.gov<br>        gopher.keller.clarke.edu <br>                  ukoln.bath.ac.uk<br>        gopher.ub2.lu.se         <br>                  utl.library.utoronto.ca<p>SOURCES:<p>(1) From the University of Minnesota's Gopher FAQ, last modified    on 7/25/94<p> +----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+<br>:  PATRICK DOUGLAS CRISPEN   :  The views expressed in this letter do not  :<br>:   PCRISPE1@UA1VM.UA.EDU    :   necessarily represent the views of the    :<br>: THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA  :     University of Alabama - Tuscaloosa.     :<br>+----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+<br>:       Roadmap: Copyright Patrick Crispen 1994.

Leave a bookmark.<p>Bookmarks are "flags" that allow you to mark a neat Gopher menu or fileso that you can return to that menu or file whenever you want. All ofyour bookmarks are kept in a "booklist" that acts just like a personalgopher menu!<p>Each Gopher client has its own particular Bookmark commands, but theyall work on the same basic principle: you leave a bookmark at a sitethat interests you, and you can access that bookmark though a booklistthat acts just like a regular gopher menu.<p>BOOKMARKS AND BOOKLISTS IN THE UNIX GOPHER CLIENT<p>If you are using a UNIX Gopher client, there are four basic UNIX bookmarkcommands that you need to remember:<p>     <b>a</b> -         Adds the item that the --> is pointing at to your                booklist.<br>     <b>A</b>  -        Adds the current directory that you are in to your                booklist.<br>     <b>v</b>  -        Views your booklist<br>     <b>d</b>  -        Deletes a bookmark from your booklist<p>On Monday, I showed you the fictional "gopher.squirrel.com" rootGopher server. Let's go back to that Gopher server and look athow we can start using bookmarks to make our lives a little easier:<p>                       Root gopher server: gopher.squirrel.com<p>          1.   Information about the Squirrel Gopher Server.<br>          2.   What's new in the Squirrel Gopher.<br>          3.   Network Resources, Services and Information/<br>          4.   Squirrel Staff Directory <CSO><br>          5.   Squirrel Human Resources Information/<br>          6.   Potpourri, Miscellaneous Topics/<br>          7.   Local Squirrel Archives/<br>      --> 8.   Other Gopher and Information Servers around the World/<p>If I type an upper case "A", I will add this entire menu to mybooklist (under the entry "Root gopher server: gopher.squirrel.com").If I type a lower case "a", I will add whatever the --> is pointingat to my booklist.<p>I'm going to do both.<p>I type an upper case "A", and the following appears on my screen:<p>     Name for this bookmark?   Root gopher server: gopher.squirrel.com<p>I can cancel this, rename this bookmark, or accept this name. I'm goingto accept the name. Once I do this, the bookmark is added to mybooklist.<p>I also want to add the "Other Gopher and Information Servers around theWorld" menu to my booklist, so I move the --> cursor down to that lineand type a lower case "a". I go through the "name" prompt again, and theentry is then added to my Booklist.<p>Okay ... I've just added two bookmarks to my booklist. What does*THAT* mean? Well, if I type the letter "v", the following menuappears on my screen:<p>                             Bookmarks<p>          1.   Root gopher server: gopher.squirrel.com/<br>      --> 2.   Other Gopher and Information Servers around the World/<p>COOL! I've just created my own Gopher menu! Best of all, *I* get todecide what information and sites are going to be on this Gopher menu!<p>Since these two bookmarks look a little lonely, I think I should addSURAnet my booklist too. My booklist acts just like any other Gophermenu, so I move the cursor down to the "Other Gopher and InformationServers around the world" line, press return, and the following menuappears on my screen:<p>               Other Gopher and Information Servers around the World<p>          1.   All the Gopher Servers in the World/<br>          2.   Search All the Gopher Servers in the World <?><br>          3.   Search titles in Gopherspace using veronica/<br>          4.

South America/<br>          ... snip snip snip (these are my Internet scissors) ...<p>We've seen this before!<p>I move the cursor down to "North America", press return, and thefollowing menu appears on my screen:<p>                                    North America<p>          1.   Canada/<br>          2.   Costa Rica/<br>          3.   Mexico/<br>      --> 4.   USA/<p>Since I know that SURAnet is in the U.S., I move the cursor down to"USA", press return, and the following appears on my screen:<p>                                          USA<p>      --> 1.

West Virginia/<br>          52.  Wisconsin/<br>          53.  Wyoming/<p>I select the "All" menu, and after a little while the following menuappears on my screen:<p>                                          All<p>          1.  1994 California Voter information/<br>          2.  AACRAO National Office, Washington, DC/<br>          3.  AATF - American Association of Teachers of French/<br>          4.  ACADEME THIS WEEK (Chronicle of Higher Education)/<br>          ... snip snip snip ...<br>          988. SUNY Office of Library Services<br>     -->  989. SURAnet NIC/<br>          990. Safety Information Resources on the InterNet/<br>          991. Sailor - Maryland's Information Network/<br>          ... snip snip snip ...<p>Now I have a choice. I can either move the cursor down to "SURAnet NIC"and type a lower case "a" to add SURAnet to my booklist, or I canenter the SURAnet Gopher and type an upper case "A". Either waywill give me the same result.<p>I'm lazy. I type a lower case "a".<p>Let's see what my booklist looks like now. I type the letter "v"and the following menu appears on my screen:<p>                             Bookmarks<p>          1.   Root gopher server: gopher.squirrel.com/<br>          2.   Other Gopher and Information Servers around the World/<br>      --> 3.   SURAnet NIC/<p>Now, if I ever need to get to SURAnet, all I will have to do is accessmy booklist!<p>BOOKMARKS AND BOOKLISTS IN THE RICE CMS GOPHER<p>Despite what UNIX fans may tell you, not everyone in the world has aUNIX account. Many new Internet users -- especially new users at someU.S. colleges and universities -- have accounts on IBM VM mainframes(as a matter of fact, *MY* main account is on a VM mainframe).<p>The VM Gopher menu is set-up a little differently from the UNIXGopher menu:<p>     Rice CMS Gopher 2.4.0                            GOPHER.SQUIRREL.COM<br>     1/8                                  <center>(root menu)</center><br>     <document>  Information about the Squirrel Gopher Server<br>     <document>  What's new in the Squirrel Gopher<br>     <menu>      Network Resources, Services and Information<br>     <phonebk>   Squirrel staff directory<br>     <menu>      Squirrel Human Resources Information<br>     <menu>      Potpourri, Miscellaneous Topics<br>     <menu>      Local Squirrel Archives<br>     <menu>_     Other Gopher Servers<br>     1= Help      2=          3= Return    4= Print     5= Receive  6= Find<br>     7= Backward  8= Forward  9= Bookmark 10= Booklist 11=         12= Quit<p>The VM Gopher has a whole bunch of nifty features. It prints the addressof the Gopher site that you are connected to in the upper-right-handcorner of the screen (UNIX users have to type "=" to get this information).It also tells you if a menu item is a file or menu without using anyweird "/" or "." symbols.<p>One of the drawbacks to the VM Gopher is that there is no bookmark commandequivalent to UNIX's lower case "a" command. The VM Gopher's bookmarkcommand acts just like UNIX's upper case "A" command, which means thatyou have to actually enter a site or menu item if you want to add thatsite or menu item to your booklist.<p>Here is what I mean:     Rice CMS Gopher 2.4.0                            GOPHER.SQUIRREL.COM<br>     1/8                                  (root menu)<br>     <document>  Information about the Squirrel Gopher Server<br>     <document>  What's new in the Squirrel Gopher<br>     <menu>      Network Resources, Services and Information<br>     <phonebk>   Squirrel staff directory<br>     <menu>      Squirrel Human Resources Information<br>     <menu>      Potpourri, Miscellaneous Topics<br>     <menu>      Local Squirrel Archives<br>     <menu>_     Other Gopher Servers<br>     1= Help      2=          3= Return    4= Print     5= Receive  6= Find<br>     7= Backward  8= Forward  9= Bookmark 10= Booklist 11=         12= Quit<p>To add this root menu to my booklist, all I have to do is press the PF9PF9 key (I won't be able to rename the bookmark entry, though).<p>However, if I want to add the "Other Gopher Servers" menu to mybooklist, I have to first enter the "Other Gopher Servers" menu(by moving the _ cursor down to the "Other Gopher Servers" lineand pressing enter), and THEN press PF9.<p>After I have done this, I can view my new booklist by typing PF10:<p>     Rice CMS Gopher 2.4.0     1/8<br>     <menu>      (root menu)<br>     <menu>_     Other Gopher Servers<br>     1= Help      2=          3= Return    4= Print     5= Load     6= Find<br>     7= Backward  8= Forward  9= Delete   10= Refresh  11=         12= Quit<p>Notice that once I enter my booklist, three things happen:<p>     1. The address in the upper-right-hand corner disappears        (my booklist is a personal Gopher menu that does not        have an address) :)<p>     2. PF9 changes from "Bookmark" to "Delete". If I ever        need to a delete a bookmark, I'll have to enter        my Booklist, move the _ cursor to the entry that        I want to delete, and then press PF9.<p>     3. PF10 changes from "Booklist" to "Refresh". After I have        deleted an entry from my Booklist, I can refresh my        Booklist screen by pressing PF10.<p>HOMEWORK<p>     1. Play!<p>     2. Add some sites to your booklist.<p>     3.

SCHOOL CROSSING ZONES</H1></B><BR></I> </PRE>
  
  <BODY><HR> <P>
   Following, you will find information to help you with planning of your Child Access Routes. 
  There is certain criteria that must be met before a city can put in a cross walk, flashing lights,
  or a crossing guard.  A summary of this criteria follows. 
  <P>
  SCHOOL CROSSING-  A marked crosswalk.  Must have 10 or more students using it AND the
  street must have an average daily traffic which exceeds 500 vehicles.
  <P>
  REDUCE SPEED SCHOOL ZONE - A marked crosswalk with flashing lights.  Must have 10 or
  more students using it, the street must have an average daily traffic which exceeds 500
  vehicles, AND it must meet the criteria on Appendix A (see attached).  You may have one at
  signalized crossings.
  <P>
  NARROW SCHOOL ROUTE - This is signed in an area without sidewalks and a paved
  shoulder less than three feet.  May be installed ONLY after the District School Traffic Safety
  Committee has determined that boundary changes, alternate school routes, or supplemental
  methods of transportation are not feasible.  It is NOT intended as a permanent substitute for
  sidewalks or pavement widening in urban areas.  Narrow School Routes shall be a maximum
  length of one mile in urban and two miles in rural areas.
  <PRE>
  A School Crosswalk may NOT be placed within 600 feet of the following:
       1.  A signalized intersection or crosswalk
       2.  A stop sign controlled intersection or crosswalk
       3.  Another school or pedestrian crosswalk
  </PRE>
 <P>
  School crossings may NOT be placed at any location that has inadequate stopping sight
  distance (see Appendix B).  (Remember to increase the stopping sight distance when on a
  downhill grade. )
 <P> 
  If you feel that you qualify for a school crosswalk, reduced speed school zone, or a narrow
  school route, you MUST contact your local police department so that a study may be done.  I
  have listed only the criteria for a study to be done.  There is a formula that must be applied
  before any of these may be placed.

What Is CARP?
</H1></B><BR></I>

<B><H3>CARP stands for Child Access Routing Plans. </H3></B><BR> <BODY><HR><p>The State of Utah has required each school district in the state to establish a District School Traffic Safety Committee.  The job of this committee is to review each Child Access Routing Plan for all elementary and junior high schools, to see if it includes specific key areas.  These plans must be submitted annually.<p>The purpose of the plans is to select the safest route for each child to walk to school.  During the process, hazards will be studied and discussed.  Sometimes, the school committee will have the city study the need for a cross walk in an particular area.  Other times, the need for sidewalks will be addressed.  The committee also studies the community to see if walking routes need to have weed and snow removal as well.<p>The whole idea behind this process is to try to make it safer for our children to walk to school.

The District's School Traffic Safety Committee is in place.  In addition, Section 41-6-78(16)(a), requires child access routing plans and training be provided at each school.  These plans must be in place by the beginning of school this fall.  To accomplish this, these must be updated by April 30th of each year, so that the approval process can be completed prior to June, and the plans may be disseminated to the parents of all the students prior to the beginning of the school year.<P>We need your help to comply with the requirements of 41-6-78 UCA.  The first step in this process requires the establishment of a school Committee, a sub-Committee to the District's Committee, to develop and implement a school plan.  <P><OL TYPE=I><LI>	School Traffic Safety Committee<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Each school in the District shall establish a School Traffic Safety Committee.  The Committee shall consist of:<OL TYPE=A><P><LI>	School Principal or designee;<P><LI>	PTA Safety Commissioner;<P><LI>	A member of the Joint Staff Study Committee;<P><LI>	Someone from each municipality affected (see attached sheet for names of contacts at each municipality);<P><LI>	Others as needed.<P></OL>The second step is to do your research and write a plan.  Below, you will find the contents, form, and the order of the plan.  All Elementaries and Junior High Schools are required to provide a plan.  This next section MUST be in written form following the outline shown below.  You must write the plan based on EXISTING CONDITIONS.  Do not write your plan using conditions that you recommend or wish existed.  After it is written, the plan should be in a form such that, after approval, can be disseminated to the parents of all your students.<P><LI>	School Plan<OL TYPE=A><P><LI>	Written Plan<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Each elementary and junior high school shall prepare a routing plan using existing conditions. The plan shall include supporting data in writing including:<OL TYPE=1><P><LI>  	The school location;<P><LI>  	Existing traffic controls;<P><LI>  	Established school crossings; <P><LI>  	Established speed school zones (with name & phone # to notify guards in the   	event of early dismissal);<P><LI>  	Established narrow school routes;<P><LI>  	Present access routes and the numbers of students using those routes;<P><LI>  	Sidewalks (or lack of);<P><LI>  	Hazards (manmade and natural - don't solve the Issue here)<P><LI>  	Bicycle Routes;<P><LI> 	Future growth areas;<P><LI> 	Loading/unloading areas for students who ride the bus;<P><LI> 	Loading/unloading areas for students who arrive by car.</OL><P><LI>	Dissemination of Plan and Training<OL TYPE=1><P><LI>	After the plan has been approved, the plan shall be sent to each parent whose student attends the school.<P><LI>	Annually, all elementary school children shall be given training on the routing plan, on crossing safety, and bike safety if you are allowing them to ride bikes.</OL><P><LI>	Maps<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Include maps that are easily read, can be duplicated, and include legends.  Two or three maps, which when folded are 8" x 10", must include the following information:<OL TYPE=1><P><LI>	Map 1 shall show:<UL>		<LI>School location	<LI>Established School Crossings	<LI>Present access routes - use arrows to show the direction of travel going TO school</UL><P><LI>	Map 2 shall show:<UL>	<LI>GEO Code divisions (if you are discussing routes per GEO Code)<P></UL><LI>	Map 3 shall show:<UL>	<LI>Loading/Unloading areas for buses	<LI>Loading/Unloading areas for parents or other vehicles</OL><P><./UL><LI>	Signatures:<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Include signatures from the people listed in Section 1.1-5, indicating that they approve of the plan as written.<P></OL>You must include all of the signatures listed in 1 at the end of this plan.  Make sure that you refer to the attached sheet entitled "CARP MUNICIPALITY CONTACTS" to see who's signature you need for 1.4.  A form entitled "CHILD ACCESS ROUTING PLANS APPROVAL FORM" is also attached.  Please make enough copies so that each municipality fills out their own copy.   Leave a copy of your plan at each municipality that signs the "Child Access Routing Form." <P>The third step is to analyze your hazards and determine what changes are required to make the routes safer for walking students.  Included in this packet is a document entitled "Specifications of School Crossing Zones."  (This is a condensed version of the document provided for the state municipalities.)  This document briefly tells when a study can be made to determine the necessity for a school crossing, reduced speed school zone, or a narrow school route.  A copy of this study must be attached to your plan.  (An example of a study is attached.)  Please do not make recommendations until you have referred to the "Specifications of School Crossing Zones" and have spoken to someone from the municipality ( see " CARP Municipality Contacts").  <P><LI>	Recommendations<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Each school shall develop recommendations to make the walking routes safer and to mitigate the hazards listed in the written plan.  This Section is a separate page (or pages) and will include the following:<OL TYPE=A><P><LI>  School Name<P><LI>	Issues<OL TYPE=1><P><LI>	<UL>		<LI>Issue:	<LI>Discussion:	<LI>Possible solutions including, but not limited to:	<LI>Traffic controls, 	<LI>School crossings	<LI>Reduced speed school zones	<LI>Narrow school routes	<LI>Other related safety items.  </OL><P></UL><LI>	Studies that have been done to show that the crosswalks or other changes can be legally placed.<OL TYPE=1><P><LI>	Informal<P><LI>	Formal</OL><P><LI>	Signatures of people in section 1 showing approval of recommendations.<P></OL>	The Issues will be listed and discussed separately.  Number them 3.2.1, 3.2.2, etc.  The signatures need to be on the document showing recommendations.  Please leave enough room for the municipalities to make written comments on this document.  You should be working with the municipality while writing this plan, so the wording should be correct when you get their signatures.<P>Two copies of the written plan, maps, and recommendations shall be submitted to Jan Gibbons in Planning and Emergency Preparedness for review.<P>The District School Traffic Safety Committee shall study the school recommendations and upon approval submit them to UDOT for final approval.<P>	Included in this packet, is a check list entitled "CARP - Child Access Routing Plans".  The Committee will be using this document to check if your plan is COMPLETE.  Also, included in this packet is a sample Child Access Routing Plan for the new Kaysville Elementary.  If you have concerns or questions, please contact Jan Gibbons at 451-3114.<HR><h6><ADDRESS>Davis County Schools</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>45 East State Street</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>PO Box 0588</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>Farmington, UT  84025-0588</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>Phone: (801) 451-1198</ADDRESS><pre><I>	This page was written by Jan Gibbons.  	It was last updated June 13, 1996.  	Please email your comments to:  	jgibbons@census.dist.davis.k12.ut.us<BR></pre><A HREF="mailto:jgibbons@census.dist.davis.k12.ut.us" > Janet Gibbons </A>Davis County Schools Emergency Preparedness Coordinator</BODY></h6></HTML>

When snow plows come through the area, the typical place to put the snow is along the side of the road, causing students to walk in the middle of the street.Solution:  Put sidewalks along Main and 1500 West.<P><LI>	Issue: There is a need for a crosswalk in front of the school on 700 East with a crossing guard.Discussion: Due to the number of parents dropping students off in front of the school, it is dangerous for elementary students to cross the street unaided.  Due to the speed that already exists on the road, a crossing guard will not be provided under the law.   PTA volunteers or playground aids can be used as crossing guards. Solution:  Put a crosswalk in front of the school on 700 East.<P><LI> 	Issue:  There needs to be a three way stop and crosswalks at each corner at 700 East and 1475 South.Discussion:  Due to the increase in vehicular traffic with parents coming from all directions, dropping off students at the school, this will be a very busy intersection.  There is a stop sign for people going from 700 East to 1475 East, but there will be many students crossing here.  Stops on 1475 East need to be added and crosswalks are needed for the safety of the students.Solution:  Put two stop signs on 1475 East, and cross walks crossing 1475 East and 700 East.<P><LI>	Issue:  There needs to be a four way stop and crosswalks added to the intersection of Burton Lane and 235 East (Via La Costa Way).Discussion:  Burton Lane is a busy street.  Stop signs need to be added to Burton Lane, and crosswalks need to be added to aid students crossing this street.  Presently there are stop signs on Via La Costa Way.Solution:  Place stop signs on Burton Lane, and paint crosswalks on both Burton Lane and Via La Costa Way.<P><LI>	Issue:  A crosswalk needs to be added to the intersection of Burton Lane and 200 East.Discussion:  Burton Lane is a busy street.  A crosswalk needs to be added to aid students crossing this street.  Presently there are stop signs on 200 East, but no crosswalks to cross Burton Lane.Solution:  Paint a crosswalk on Burton Lane crossing to the east side of 200 East.<P><LI>	Issue:  A crosswalk needs to be added to the intersection of Burton Lane and 50 West (Frontage Road).Discussion:  Burton Lane is a busy street.  A crosswalk needs to be added to aid students crossing this street.  Presently there are stop signs on 50 West (Frontage Road), but no crosswalks to cross Burton Lane.Solution:  Paint a crosswalk on Burton Lane crossing to the east side of 50 West (Frontage Road).<P><LI>	Issue:  A crosswalk needs to be added to the intersection of 1250 South and  700 East.Discussion:  A crosswalk needs to be added to aid students crossing this street.  Presently there is a cross walk crossing 1250 South, but no crosswalk to cross 700 East to the south of 1250 South.Solution:  Paint a crosswalk crossing 700 East to the south of 1250 South.<P><LI>	Issue:  There is no purpose to having a four way stop with crosswalks at the intersection of 650 East and 1475 South.Discussion:  650 East does not go through the home to the new school.  There are fences around the site for the building of the school.  The fence will remain after the school is built and students can not cut through. Solution:  Remove the stop signs on 1475 South, but leave the signs up on 650 East.  Do not repaint the crosswalks, forcing the student to cross at 700 East.</OL><P><LI>	 Studies that have been done - <OL TYPE=1><P><LI>	Informal - We drove the neighborhood on 3/13/95.

<html><head><TITLE> CARP - Admin Routing Plans</TITLE></head><B><H1><I> Administrative UpdatesChild Access Routing Plans1996</H1></B><BR></I><BODY><HR>Small Capital Outlay - If you find that your school needs the district to make improvements on the school grounds, you will need to fill out a work request.  Please be very specific.  You need to mention your need in your Child Access Routing Plan, but to get the improvements, you must go through the small capital outlay process.  Sharon Gardner must approve the work order.<p>Hazardous Busing - When you are working on your Child Access Routing Plan, and you come across an area that might qualify for hazardous busing, you need to fill out a Hazardous Busing form and apply for it through Transportation.  For the Access Plan, you need to find the "safest" route for your students to walk.  Make that route part of your Child Access Routing Plan, and change the plan later if you are granted hazardous busing.  Hazardous busing is a separate procedure and is not handled in conjunction with the Child Access Routing Plan.<p>Recommendations Section - When your committee feels that they want to change something, they must do it in this section.  This is the section where you request cross walks, crossing guards, stop signs, etc.  If your committee feels that something will increase the safety of the children, and it meets the warrants, please put it in this section.  If the city does not agree with your request, leave it in the plan, but  have them attach a memo of nonconcurrence.  Your job is to find the safest routes, and to make recommendations to improve the safety of the children.<p>Established Speed Zone - this is a cross-walk with flashing lights.  There doesn't have to be a crossing guard here, but if there is, you must list the guard's name and phone number.  Do not list this type of cross-walk under the cross walk section.<p>Maps - you must include arrows showing direction of travel on one of your maps.  This step is required by the state and county. <p>Number of Copies - Keep the plan with original signatures at your school.  Send me two Xeroxed copies of the plan.  The first copy is for the Superintendent's file, and the second is for UDOT.<p>DUE DATE - The plans for the 1996-97 school year are DUE in my office by April 30, 1996.  We must have the plans turned in to UDOT before summer for the cities and state to qualify for their funding.<p><h6><ADDRESS>Davis County Schools</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>45 East State Street</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>PO Box 0588</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>Farmington, UT  84025-0588</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>Phone: (801) 451-1198</ADDRESS><pre><I>	This page was written by Jan Gibbons.  	It was last updated June 13, 1996.  	Please email your comments to:  	jgibbons@census.dist.davis.k12.ut.us<BR></pre><A HREF="mailto:jgibbons@census.dist.davis.k12.ut.us" > Janet Gibbons </A> Davis County Schools Emergency Preparedness Coordinator</BODY></h6></HTML>

<html><head><TITLE>CERT Teams in the Schools </TITLE></head><B><H1><I>COMMUNITY RESPONSE TEAMS(CERT) IN THE SCHOOLS</H1></B><BR></I><BODY><HR><p>After a major earthquake or other emergency, fire, police, and other emergency response agencies may be overburdened and may not be able to reach your community immediately.  Davis County School District employees may have to take initial emergency response action and fend for themselves for at least 72 hours.  Past earthquakes have shown that the first rescuers on scene are usually volunteers.  Untrained volunteers can endanger their own lives, as well as the lives of those individuals they are trying to assist.<p>The idea of training volunteers from the community to assist emergency services personnel during large-scale natural disasters began in Los Angeles in 1985 with studies of earthquake preparedness and response.<p>The Los Angeles City Fire Department (LAFD) developed a pilot program to train multi-functional volunteer response teams to perform basic fire suppression, light search and rescue, and first aid.  The first team of 30 neighborhood watch organization leaders that completed training in early 1986 demonstrated that the concept was viable.  <p>The purpose of the Community Response Team program is to improve, through training, community self-reliance and survival ability in the event of a large natural disaster.  The earthquake scenario is used because recent California history has proven that emergency resources will be depleted to the extent that some individuals or neighborhoods will need to rely on themselves within the first 24 to 48 hours. <p>Training consists of seven sessions spread out over seven weeks for a total of 21 hours of instruction.  Classes cover personal and family preparedness, non-structural hazard mitigation, the Incident Command System, size-up, disaster psychology, hazardous-materials identification, fire suppression, search and rescue, recognizing and treating life-threatening emergencies, and a simulated exercise.  Select groups of volunteers are trained and will form teams capable of taking care of basic self-help emergency functions until help can arrive.<p>Hurricane Hugo, the flooding of the Mississippi River, the San Francisco and Northridge earthquakes recently have demonstrated the devastating potential for broad-based destruction that natural disaster can inflict on mankind.  Prudent risk management does not allow the fire service to maintain personnel and resources on a full-time basis to cope with such large-scale disasters.<p>WE NEED TO RELY ON OUR OWN RESOURCES.  Studies have shown that most people are not killed by an earthquake.  They are usually killed by things falling on them, fires, poisonous fumes, or flooding.  Things that are normally available to you, (telephones, utilities, and roads), will be damaged in an earthquake.  The Whittier Narrows earthquake was a 5.9.  It resulted in only 3 deaths, but within 40 minutes, all the ambulances were taken, and half the fire engines were out fighting fires!  You may not be able to get help for 72 or more hours.  Preparing families to function on their own is imperative.<p>Utah was one of the first states in the nation, outside of California, to recognize the value  of the Community Emergency Response Team Program to its citizens.  CERT is not only an outstanding vehicle to enable a population to take care of themselves in the immediate hours following a major disaster, but also a program that would bridge the gap between the lay public and the emergency management community.<p>Davis County Schools is the first school district in the state to provide this type of training for their personnel as an on-going inservice program.  For those taking CERT training, two credit hours of inservice credit will be granted on the completion of this course.  Six people trained from each elementary and special schools, twelve people trained from each of the junior and senior high schools, and employees from other buildings within the District, should give us skilled people to meet the needs of the safety of our student and employee populations.  <p>As our employees train to be CERT members, not only will our safety needs be met, but also those of their own communities.  When the earthquake or other disaster hits, we may not be in school.  If this were to happen, our trained CERT members will be available to help in their community.  Our CERT members will be receiving the same training that is being provided throughout the county.  <p>Our efforts are coordinated throgh the newly established Davis County CERT Association.  The Association brings together the primary responders (sheriff, police, and fire) from all munipalities within this County.The current president of the Association is Jan Gibbons, who is the DCSD Emergency Preparedness Coordinator.<p><HR><h6><ADDRESS>Davis County Schools</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>45 East State Street</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>PO Box 0588</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>Farmington, UT  84025-0588</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>Phone: (801) 451-1198</ADDRESS><pre><I>	This page was written by Jan Gibbons.  	It was last updated June 13, 1996.  	Please email your comments to:  	jgibbons@census.dist.davis.k12.ut.us<BR></pre><A HREF="mailto:jgibbons@census.dist.davis.k12.ut.us" > Janet Gibbons </A>Davis County Schools Emergency Preparedness Coordinator</BODY><h6></HTML>

DAVIS COUNTY CERT ASSOCIATION<BR>
</CENTER>     The next Davis County CERT Association meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, June 19, 1996 at 7 p.m. in the Davis County Sheriff's Office.  We need a representative from each CERT jurisdiction to attend this next meeting. We will be conducting board member elections for this next year, and need representation from all CERT organizations.  Beginning in June, our association meetings will be quarterly.<P>
CERT VIDEO<BR>
     The CERT promotional video grant that was given to the State of Utah, Comprehensive Emergency Management should be completed before the June meeting. If a copy can be obtained, it will be shown during that meeting. The purpose of the video is to give an overview of the CERT program that can be used for recruitment and training purposes.<BR>
   If you remember it was decided that the video should take on a dual function and will be produced in two segments.  The first function will be to present the program to an audience that is not familiar with CERT, give them an idea of what is involved in the training, and how it can benefit their family and community. This portion will be approximately 10-15 minutes in length and be used to recruit potential CERT trainees. The second function will cover the basic skills used in CERT training, such as: medical, fire fighting, cribbing and other techniques. This segment can be used as an example during CERT training classes, but should not be used in place of the training classes.<BR>
   The video was scheduled to be finished and submitted to FEMA for their approval several months ago, but due to equipment problems and weather conditions, it took longer than planned.<P>
COURSES IN PROGRESS<BR>
     Several CERT Basic Courses will be starting in the near future. If you have questions about upcoming CERT classes, contact the CERT           Program Manager in your area:<BR>
ACTIVITIES<BR>
     Clearfield City in conjunction with Clearfield Emergency Management will be sponsoring a Community partnership Fair in the parking lot of Tom Winegar's Market on May 11, 1996 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. There will be booths and activities which should be interesting for all. A CERT booth will also be set up to promote the program.<BR>
                
STATE SPONSORED TRAINING<BR>
     The Utah State Division of Comprehensive Emergency Management, or CEM, regularly sponsors training that we citizens of Davis County can take advantage of to increase our knowledge of Emergency Management. Listed below are some of the training topics and scheduled dates.<BR>
<I>TRAINING TOPIC DATES</I><BR>
   CERT Train the Trainer     <BR>
     May 13-17, 1996<BR>
   Exercise Design<BR>
<DL><DD>July 10-11, 1996</DL>   CERT Train the Trainer<BR>
<DL><DD>July 15-19, 1996</DL>To attend any State-sponsored training, you must register early and make sure that your local Emergency Management Director is aware of your desire to attend the training. You must also fill out and submit a General Admissions Application, Form 75-5 EZ, which can be obtained from your Local Emergency Management office. The training is excellent and will not only increase your knowledge but will help you be an asset to your community through your efforts to improve your preparedness level. If you have questions your can contact CEM training division at 538-3400 or Roger Anderson Davis County Emergency Services at 451-4100.<P>
GETTING THE WORD OUT<BR>
     The Davis County School District has designated one week a year as Emergency Preparedness Week in each school, K-12 in Davis County. The activities associated with this week must be completed by October 31st of each year and is left up to the individual schools to decide just what activities they will have.<BR>
     This is a wonderful opportunity to contact the principle of the schools in your jurisdiction and coordinate an activity in which the CERT program can be promoted. I would encourage each CERT program manager to take the opportunity to be involved with the School Emergency Preparedness Program.<P>
HELP<BR>
     We are trying to build an association which will ensure that all the citizens in Davis County are trained alike, so they can help each other in times of need. It is important that everyone feels that they belong to the same organization. We would like to offer annual C.E.R.T. conferences, inservice classes and exercises. For this to work, we need the aid of people who are committed to helping us. We are looking for people who committed to helping us; who can attend quarterly meetings, and are willing to donate other hours to make this a reality. If you can give some of your time and expertise, please come to our next meeting and volunteer. Don't forget to attend our quarterly meeting on June 19, 1996 at 7 p.m. at the Sheriff's Department (please use the back door.)<P>

<TITLE>The Web</TITLE>
<H1>The Web</H1>

First off, "the WWW", "the Web" and "W^3" are all the same thing.  The web is a distributed hypermedia database.
<ul>
	<li> distributed - on several computers
	<li> hypermedia - linked media, much like hypertext, except with other media
	<li> database - an organized repository of information
</ul>
So the web is a linked multi-media repository of information stored on several computers.  Because the Web is distributed, it needs a network to move information back and forth between computers.  That network just happens to be the Internet.  
<P>

The network is the Internet, and the protocal is HTTP, and names are
called URL's.  HTTP is simply a protocal for transfering HTML
documents.  HTML stands for "hypertext markup language."  URL stands
for "uniform resource locator."  That's computeresque speech for "a
universal system for naming and locating resources."  The upshot of
that is that with a URL, you can use HTTP to access most anything in
the world.  <P>

URL's are formed as follows:
<pre>
	protocal://machine.name:port/directory/path/to/file.name.html
</pre>
So the URL:
<pre>
	http://www.davis.k12.ut.us/knowlton/ldsbc/web.html
</pre>
can be used to find the document <tt>web.html</tt> in the <TT>/knowlton/ldsbc/</TT> directory on the machine named <TT>lal.cs.byu.edu</TT> and should be loaded and interpreted using the <TT>http</TT> protocal.
<P>

How about the following URL's:
<p>
<pre>
	http://scholastic.com:2005/public/IAP/IAP-Home.html	



	http://www.ircam.fr/divers/musees-art.html



	telnet://access.usask.ca



	news://hamblin.math.byu.edu/comp.infosystems.www.announce


	
	ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/games/winlife.zip

<TITLE> Email</TITLE>
<H1> Email</H1>

<H2>What is email?</H2>

Email is the primary form of person to person communication on the
Internet.  Email is like regular mail, except it takes several seconds
(or even a whole minute) to travel around the world.  Email is like
telephones except the other person doesn't have to be there.  Its
asynchronous. 
<P>

A disadvantage to email is that it doesn't convey emotion very well.
Sarcasm and very rude comments look exactly the same.  Consequently,
emoticons have developed.  Emoticons are little smileys that convey
the emotion missed by face to face communication.  Here is a smiley
:).  There is even a <A
HREF="http://a.cs.okstate.edu/bdgtti/bdg_290.html">Smiley
Dictionary</A>.  Another disadvantage to email is that if you don't
know someone's address, you probly won't find it.

<P>

An advantage to email is that it is asynchronous.  Two people don't
have to get together at the same time to communicate via email.  Its
similar to leaving a message.  Also, email is independent of location.
Two people don't have to be in the same place (or even the same
continent) to communicate with email.  The greatest advantage to email
is that its <blink>free</blink>.
<P>

<H2>How does one use email?</H2>

It depends on what email system you are using.  Since we are using <I>Groupwise</I>, we'll cover how to send email to the internet from <I>Groupwise</I>.  Assuming we all have access to it, if not, some of us will watch while others send email :^(  
<P>

Since <I>Groupwise</I> is a Windows program, using it is fairly easy.
Send a message like normal, but for the address, enter
<TT>internet:address</TT>.  My email address at work is
<TT>jim@lab.knowltonel.davis.k12.ut.us</TT> so if you are using <i>Groupwise</i>, send
email to <TT>internet:jim@lab.knowltonel.davis.k12.ut.us</TT>.
<P>

Of course, there is a bit of Netiquitte to consider when using email:
<ul>
	<li> Don't include a To: line.  Its redundant.
	<li> Be informal.
	<li> Its nice to include a return address (both email and snail mail).
	<li> Don't over-smiley someone
	<li> Spelling doesn't realy matter!!!
</ul>

<TITLE>Reading Internet Addresses</TITLE>
<H1>Reading Internet Addresses</H1>

When <STRONG>people</STRONG> look at an internet address they see
something like: 
<P> 
<PRE>

cheetah.cs.byu.edu

</PRE>

The text version of the name (as given above) is called the fully
qualifed domain name (FQDN).  Computers or routers on the internet
don't work with FQDNs they work with Internet Protocal addresses, or
IP addresses.  The IP address for <TT>cheetah.cs.byu.edu</TT> is:

<P>
<PRE>

128.187.2.181

</PRE> 

Both the number and the name are unique for this particular computer
on the network.  In this case, an HP 712/80 that I am using to put
these notes together.  
<P>

<H2>Resolving Names and Numbers</H2>


Fortunately, it is up to our networking software and hardware to
resolve the names and numbers and make sure our information gets to
and from the right place.  This happens through the address resolution
protocal (ARP).  When a computer encounters a FQDN, it sends a request
a nameserver.  The nameserver looks through its table of names and
numbers.  If the name is in the table, the name server returns the IP
address which is then tacked on the packet and the whole bundle is
sent to a router.  But if the nameserver does not know the IP address
of the FQDN, it asks another nameserver and so on until someone knows
the IP address for the name.  The IP address is then returned to the
computer which tacks it onto the packet and sends it off the to the
router. 
<P> All of this takes about half a second or less.
<P>

<H2>Host names, Domains and Subnets</H2>

After a little time on the net, you can look at a FQDN and tell a good
bit about the computer with that name.  The last set of letters gives
the domain for the address, in this case, the domain is <TT>edu</TT>
meaning an educational institution in the United States.  The
following list of tailing domains comes from <A
HREF="http://sundance.cso.uiuc.edu/Publications/Other/Zen/zen-1.0_2.html#SEC3">Zen
and the Art of the Internet</A>:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>com</CODE>
<DD>Usually a company or other commercial institution or organization,
like Convex Computers (<SAMP>`convex.com'</SAMP>).
<P>
<DT><CODE>edu</CODE>
<DD>An educational institution, e.g. New York University, named <SAMP>`nyu.edu'</SAMP>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>gov</CODE>
<DD>A government site; for example, NASA is <SAMP>`nasa.gov'</SAMP>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>mil</CODE>
<DD>A military site, like the Air Force (<SAMP>`af.mil'</SAMP>).
<P>
<DT><CODE>net</CODE>
<DD>Gateways and other administrative hosts for a
network (it does <EM>not</EM> mean all of the hosts in a
network).<A NAME="FOOT1" HREF="http://sundance.cso.uiuc.edu/Publications/Other/Zen/zen-1.0_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>  One such gateway is
<SAMP>`near.net'</SAMP>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>org</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX3"></A>
This is a domain reserved for private organizations, who don't
comfortably fit in the other classes of domains.  One example is the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (see section <A HREF="http://sundance.cso.uiuc.edu/Publications/Other/Zen/zen-1.0_9.html#SEC95">The Electronic Frontier Foundation</A>), named <SAMP>`eff.org'</SAMP>.
</DL>

Also, each country has its own top level domain name.  Such as
<TT>.uk</TT> for the United Kingdom and <TT>.fr</TT> for france.
<P>

The rest of the address, <TT>cheetah.cs.byu</TT>, gives the subdomain,
subnetwork and host name.  In this case, the subdomain is
<TT>byu</TT>, the sub-subdomain is <TT>cs</TT> and the host name is
<TT>cheetah</TT>.  So just by looking at the FQDN, we know that
<TT>cheetah</TT> is host in the Computer Science Department at Brigham
Young University which is an educational institution.
<P>

What can we learn from:

<HTML><TITLE>A Brief History of the Internet</TITLE>
<H1>A Brief History of the Internet</H1>
<BODY>


<H1><A NAME="History">History</A></H1>
This information is mostly a summary of what's found in the EEF
Extended guide to the Internet in the <A
HREF="http://www.eff.org/papers/eegtti/eeg_44.html#SEC45">Net
Origins</A> section.  <P>

There has been alot of hype about the "Information Superhighway" over
the last few monthes and people are connecting to the internet in
record numbers.  All of the hype leaves many people wondering what the
Information Superhighway is.  Pretty much it depends on who you ask.
Cable companies see the Information Superhighay as a 500-channel
interactive TV extravaganze with video on demand served to homes
across the nation allowing families to watch what the want when they
want to.  In fact, the technology for that is not too far off.
Telephone companies see the information superhighway as a chance to
send video, sound and text over the phone lines to personal computers.
If the phone companies have their way, the computer and the phone will
be closely related in the future.  Other more Jeffersonian observers
see the Internet as the world's first real chance to truly have a
global community where peole from different nations and socio-economic
backgrounds can communicate with each other on a peer-to-peer basis.
And finaly, here is <A
HREF="http://highway.html">a
favorite definition</A> of the information superhighway.

The Internet started as a research project to connect computer using
phone lines for the DoD ARPA (that's Department of Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency).  The goal of the project was to determine
if a new technology called <strong>packet switching</strong> could be
used to connect computers in a network.  Packet switching allows more
than two computers to communicate on the same phone line at the same
time.  Packet switching was to networks as multiple lane roads are to
highways.  The <A
HREF="http://www.eff.org/papers/eegtti/eeg_44.html#SEC45">EEF
explanation</a> is much clearer.  
<P>

Under the auspices of ARPA, protocals were developed to allow
different computers to communicate.  Protocals are the set of rules
used by one computer to talk with the computer on the other end of the
line.  In large, protocals are system dependent\--they change with the
system.  By creating one protocal, different systems could speak the
same language to each other.  By the end of the 1970's computers
throughout the world were connected using ``internetworking'' or
Internet protocals.
<P>

In the 80's the exponential growth curve of the Internet began to
climb, slowly.  Initialy, the users were colleges, research companies
and anyone else with lots of money and an interest in global
information sharing about primarily scientific topics.  A few private
users found their way to the net with modems, phone connections and
persistence.  <P>

In the 90's the growth curve realy began to climb.  The growth is so
fast and dynamic that the number of connected people or machines or
daily traffic can only be estimated (here is a do-it-yourself <A
HREF="http://www.digital.com/gnn/news/feature/inet-demo/net.measure.html">guide
to estimating the number of people on the net</A>) The user profile is
much more difficult to determine.  In the begining, like 5 or 3 years
ago, one could assume a familiarity with computers (at least a BS in
computer science) in most any internet user.  Now, that assumption no
longer holds.  Users are not computer people with an interest in
something else (like cats or ponds or gardening) they are people with
an interest in something else (like making money) with a connection to
the internet.  The interent is going public.  <P>

<H1>How the Internet Works</H1>

Well, it depends on how you want to look at it.  At the physcical
level, the internet is a bunch of computers and cable that literaly
covers the entire earth. As shown below, at the logical level, the
internet looks like a bunch of lines and dots covering a map of the
world.
<P>

There is good information about what the Internet looks like in the <A
HREF="http://www.eff.org/papers/eegtti/eeg_45.html#SEC46">How it
Works</A> section of the EEF Extended Guide to the Internet.  <P>

Basicaly, the Internet looks like the US road system.  Except the
Internet is less organized and the maps aren't as good.  In fact,
there are no numbers for how many machines (or connections) make up
the Internet.
<P>


<HR>
<H2>Routing</H2>

So how does information get between computers?  Each computer is
assigned an <STRONG>IP address</STRONG>.  Each packet, or piece of
information, contains the IP address of the computer it is trying to
reach.  The packet is then routed to get to the right place. Here is
an <A

The California Integrated Waste Management Board is responsible 
for managing Californias solid waste stream.  The Board is helping California divert 
50 percent of its waste from landfills by 2000 by developing waste reduction programs, 
providing public education and outreach, assisting local governments and businesses, and 
fostering market development for recyclable materials.  The Board also protects public 
health and the environment by encouraging used oil recycling, regulating waste management 
facilities, and cleaning up abandoned and illegal dump sites. 

The Waste Board is one of six agencies under the umbrella of the

The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) and the State Water
Resources Control Board (SWRCB) are conducting a parallel rulemaking as a
result of Assembly Bill 1220 (Chapter 656, Statutes of 1993). The proposed
regulations for solid waste disposal sites were noticed on July 26, 1996,
and the initial formal comment period ended on September 11, 1996. &nbsp;
An additional comment period commenced on November 18 and ended on December
4, 1996. &nbsp;<B>A new comment period is underway and will end on January
7, 1997. </B></FONT></A>
<P>
<A NAME="top"><FONT COLOR="#000000">On <B>January 7, 1997</B>, a joint CIWMB
Permitting and Enforcement Committee meeting/SWRCB Workshop will be conducted

Technically, organic materials make up approximately two thirds
of the waste stream. However, much of this is paper which should
either be used more efficiently or recycled. Yard waste, such
as grass clippings, tree trimmings, and leaves, can account for
nearly a quarter of all household garbage. Interested in more

<HR>
<H3><B><A NAME="comp1"></A>What is composting and why do it?</B>
</H3>

<P>
<B><dd>Composting, nature's own way of recycling, is the controlled
decomposition of organic material such as leaves, twigs, grass
clippings, and vegetable food waste. Compost is the soil amendment
product that results from proper composting. Whether it's done
on site, at the point of waste generation, or in a large scale,
centralized facility, composting helps to keep the high volume
of organic material out of landfills and turns it into a useful
product. On site composting reduces the cost of hauling materials
and is generally exempted from solid waste regulations. Large
scale facilities can handle more material and potentially produce
a more consistent product, but may be faced with regulatory issues.
</B>
<P>
<B><dd>This site should provide enough information to get you started
composting at any scale. The principles of composting are the
same if you have one cubic yard or many hundreds. Recent regulatory
developments may allow landscapers to process materials they generate
without excessive state-level, solid waste regulatory burden.
However, since composting involves the decay of organic wastes,
people who choose to compost need to be sensitive to the impacts
their operations could have on others. Noise, dust, and odor are
common complaints about poorly run operations. It's best to be
as good a neighbor as possible, to insure minimal impacts.</B>
<P>
<B><dd>However you go about doing it, composting can be very cost
effective, and compost is great for your gardens and landscaping,
saving money spent on purchasing soil conditioners, mulch, and
fertilizer. </B><HR>

<H1>About the <BR>
Recycled-Content Product Database</H1>
This is your link to the California Integrated Waste Management Board's Recycled-Content Product (RCP) Database.
<P>
The RCP Database has information on RCPs as well as manufacturers, distributors, reprocessors, mills, and converters who procure or produce these products or the recycled materials needed to make them.  The result is a growing list of over 10,000 materials, products, and businesses.  The creation and maintenance of this data is a crucial part of the Board's strategy to bolster and stimulate the RCP market.
<P>
The quantity and variety of recycled-content products grows daily.  The RCP Database does not include all recycled-content products that are available or even all of the distributors of the products listed, but it's a good starting place.

<P>
Each of us influence which products are supplied to the market.  We do it every day by our choices of what  products we demand.  And the best way to get the attention of those suppliers is through the specification and procurement process.  Every time we buy any product, the supplier of that product gets immediate feedback.  There's no question about whether their product was marketable or not.  The only question is how many other consumers also bought their product?  When a sufficient number of consumers start demanding products that contain minimum percentages of postconsumer content, you will then have the undivided attention of that supplier.  That supplier wants to keep your business and will find a manufacturer that will be able to meet your specifications.  Procurement specifications should also be reviewed to ensure that unnecessary requirements that have nothing to do with product performance are not included.

<A NAME="Guidelines for Purchasing RCPs">Guidelines for Purchasing RCPs</A>
</H3>
<P>
We encourage you to keep the following guidelines in mind when considering your purchase:
<OL>
<LI><B>Is the product readily available?</B> <BR>By "readily available" we mean: Will the product get to you in time to be of use to you?  Many times you know in advance what your procurement needs are.  You don't wait until you are out of the product before you order it.  Sometimes it takes longer to get a product with a certain amount of postconsumer content in it.  If, by adjusting the lead time, you can get the specified product in plenty of time for its intended use, it is usually worth the extra effort.  However, if the product is not readily available or it is urgently needed because of unforeseen circumstances, you must purchase whatever product is available to fulfill your immediate needs.
<P>
<LI><B>Has the product been commercially demonstrated?</B> <BR>This is important in order to establish that the product is reliable and safe and has predictable performance characteristics under actual commercial conditions.  A product that hasn't been commercially demonstrated is an unknown factor.  It is our experience that consumers are hesitant to use products that have only recently become commercially available.  When considering your product purchases, stay within your comfort zone.  But, through education and training, strive to expand that comfort zone to include new products.
<P>
<LI><B>Is the product cost-competitive?</B> <BR>There are a number of recycled-content products currently on the market that are cost-competitive.  For other products it is not as simple as comparing up front costs.  Some RCPs have lower maintenance and replacement costs than their virgin counterparts.  To accurately compare these you must consider the life cycle costs of both and then make your decision accordingly.  You will find that sometimes recycled-content products are more expensive than similar products made from virgin material.  Each day the infrastructure to reduce the costs of manufacturing recycled-content products gets better.  It gets back to supply and demand.  If we keep demanding products that meet our specifications, manufacturers will make them and distributors will supply them.
</OL>
<P>
We hope the RCP Database will increase your knowledge of the recycled-content product possibilities and your awareness of where you might purchase many of these products.

</H3>
<P>
The RCP Database is structured to help you find products quickly and easily.  Pull-down menus help you find just the right product to fit your needs.  The database is a national listing, but you can narrow your search by state if you prefer.  Within California you can further narrow your search by county.  Each time you access the database you will be limited to printing a maximum of five companies that meet your search criteria.  The companies are accessed randomly so that if you use the database on successive days you may receive five different companies that meet the same search criteria.   You cannot copy the database, and electronic extracts are not possible because of copyright considerations.
<P>
<B>Type of Business</B>
<P>
This pull-down menu lists five categories:
<OL>
<LI><B>Distributor</B>: Sells a finished product.
<P>
<LI><B>Converter</B>: Adds value to a recycled material by sorting, cleaning, baling, chipping, etc.
<P>
<LI><B>Manufacturer</B>: Makes a finished product.
<P>
<LI><B>Reprocessor</B>: Changes the form of a recycled material so that it can be used in the manufacturing process (pellets, flakes, etc.).
<P>
<LI><B>Mill</B>: Makes an interim product (bolts of cloth, rolls of paper, etc.).
</OL>
<P>
The default selection is "Distributor."  If you want any of the other four choices, put the pointer on the arrow to the right of "Distributor" and click the left button on the mouse once.  Then put the pointer on one of the other choices and click the left button on the mouse once to select it.
<P>
<B>Recycled-Content Product List</B>
<P>
This pull-down menu is a listing of all of the recycled-content products in alphabetical order.  In addition to the recycled-content products, parentheses indicate the materials that the product was manufactured from.  You make your selection from this menu by putting the pointer on the arrow next to the window and click the left button on the mouse once.  Then put the pointer on your product choice and click the left button on the mouse once to select it.
<P>
<B>Total Recycled Content</B>
<P>
This window shows the minimum percentage of total recycled content you are looking for in your product.  The total recycled content of the product includes material recycled at the manufacturing site.  This is not a pull-down menu so you must enter the percentage you are looking for (20, 30, 40, etc.).  To enter a percentage, put the pointer in the box and click the left mouse button once.  Then type the percentage you desire.  You do not need to add the percent sign or specify the percentage as a decimal portion (i.e., type 20 rather than 0.20).
<P>
<B>Postconsumer Content</B>
<P>
This window shows the minimum percentage of postconsumer content you are looking for in your product.  The postconsumer content is the amount of material that has been recycled after the product has been used by a consumer for its intended purpose. This is not a pull-down menu so you must enter the percentage you are looking for (20, 30, 40, etc.).  To enter a percentage put the pointer in the box and click the left mouse button once.  Then type the percentage you desire.
<P>
<B>State/County</B>
<P>
This pull-down menu is a listing of the states and protectorates of the United States.  The default selection is "All States."  You can choose any state or protectorate by putting the pointer on the arrow next to the window and click the left button on the mouse once.  Then put the pointer on the state or protectorate you want to search and click the left button on the mouse once to select it.  To select California you can either follow the above procedure or go directly to the "Search in California only" button at the bottom left corner of the page.
<P>
If your search is limited to California you can also search by county.  The county pull-down menu replaces the state menu.  The default selection is "All Counties."  You can choose any California county, listed alphabetically, by putting the pointer on the arrow next to the window and click the left button on the mouse once.  Then put the pointer on the county you want to search and click the left button on the mouse once to select it.
<P>
<B>Search/Reset Buttons</B>
<P>
The RCP Database is now ready to search its records for any businesses that meet your criteria.
<P>
There are two buttons at the bottom of the screen:
<OL>
<LI><B>Search</B> - If you are happy with your criteria, put the pointer on this button and click the left button on the mouse once to search the database.
<P>
<LI><B>Reset</B> - If you would like to change all of your criteria, put the pointer on this button and click the left button on the mouse once.  All of the search criteria windows will be set to their default settings.  It may be easier to reselect individual criteria if you want to change only one or two.
</OL>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Once you have clicked on the "Search" button, the RCP Database searches for businesses that meet your criteria and displays up to five for you.  You can print the search results by moving the pointer to the word "File" at the top left of the page.  While pointing at "File" click the left button on the mouse once.  Another pull-down menu will be shown.  Point to the "Print Frame" selection and click the left mouse button once.  A "Print Screen" will come up with options for print range, print quality, and setup options.  Under normal circumstances you don't need to adjust any of these settings.  Just point to "OK" and click the left button on the mouse once.  Your search results should be printed at your printer.
<P>
<B>Changing Criteria for a New Search</B>
<P>
If you want to refine or change your search criteria in any way, click on the right button on the mouse once and continue to hold it down and select "Back" to go back to the "Product Selection" screen.  From this screen you can choose your search criteria again.  At any time during your use of the RCP Database, you can click on the right button on the mouse once and continue to hold it down and select "Back" to go back one frame or "Forward" to go forward one frame.  If either "Back" or "Forward" are dim, then that selection is not available.

 publications most useful to you.  Our goal is to make as many publications as possible available electronically.
  All new publications are provided in electronic format, and many of our fact sheets and brochures can be 
viewed on line!  We will continue to expand this capability to our older publications--beginning with 
those most frequently requested.  Please direct any comments or suggestions (by phone or e-mail)

      <FONT COLOR="Black">Introduction</FONT>
    </H2>
  <DD>
    <FONT COLOR="Black"><A NAME="board">Landmark state legislation passed in
    1989 and 1990, known as the California Integrated Waste Management Act (IWM
    Act), created a new waste management philosophy in California. The IWM Act
    emphasizes conservation of natural resources through a hierarchy of management
    methods to reduce, reuse, and recycle solid waste. The centerpiece of this
    effort is the development of comprehensive local plans to identify and promote
    programs to divert large quantities of materials from traditional disposal
    methods (landfilling and transformation). Statutory waste diversion goals
    were set at 25 percent by the year 1995 and 50 percent by the year 2000.
    Included in this planning process is the need to identify future landfill
    capacity and to ensure that environmentally safe landfills are available
    for disposal of solid waste that cannot be reduced, recycled, or
    composted.</A></FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT COLOR="Black"> <A NAME="board"></A></FONT>
  <DD>
    <FONT COLOR="Black"><A NAME="board">A full-time California Integrated Waste
    Management Board (CIWMB, Board) was established to provide effective and
    coordinated management of the state's solid waste stream. The Board is vested
    with policy-making and regulatory authority to ensure a reduction in the
    quantity of waste generated and disposed in landfills, and to ensure compliance
    with environmental regulations. The principal elements of the Board's
    decision-making process are public hearings and workshops. This structure
    ensures access for all interested parties as the Board develops and debates
    key issues. The Board is comprised of representatives of both Executive and
    Legislative branches of State government--a cooperative partnership to develop
    a forward-looking solid waste management system.</A></FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT COLOR="Black"> <A NAME="board"></A></FONT>
  <DD>
    <FONT COLOR="Black"><A NAME="board">The Board's mission to protect public
    health and safety and the environment through waste prevention, waste diversion,
    and safe waste processing and disposal can be accomplished only by cultivating
    effective relationships with local governments and private industry. Through
    public information and education programs, the Board is laying a foundation
    to change the public's daily habits and routines and to impact the
    decision-making processes of businesses and local government so that they
    reflect an awareness of the environmental and economic consequences of excessive
    waste generation. The Board's challenge is to motivate California from a
    wasteful society to a resourceful one. The Board must facilitate the development
    of markets for recyclable materials and the treatment of solid waste as a
    resource, promoting the development of facilities required to divert waste
    from disposal and provide disposal capacity for materials that cannot feasibly
    be diverted.</A></FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT COLOR="Black"> <A NAME="board"></A></FONT>
  <DD>
    <FONT COLOR="Black"><A NAME="board">California will meet its 25 percent diversion
    goal in 1995. This is strong testimony to the success of Board programs to
    date and the commitment of the state's 31 million residents to evolve from
    a "disposable" society into one that is aware of the need to conserve resources
    and protect the environment. It is widely recognized, however, that achieving
    the next 25 percent is a significant challenge. The 50 percent goal is
    attainable, but meeting it will require renewed commitment, focusing the
    collective energies of local government and business working with the Board
    to increase acceptance of compost, to employ effective waste prevention practices
    and continue developing sustainable markets for recycled goods.</A></FONT>

    at no charge, and assuring the proper disposal of used oil. The program is
    voluntary and requires that staff effectively market the benefits to private
    businesses and seek their partnership in participating. Staff contact service
    station operators, lubricating shops, automotive service centers, and other
    similar businesses that could collect used motor oil as a result of doing
    business with the public. An incentive is paid to those businesses who certify
    as collection centers. Staff also registers industrial generators of used

    normally discarded by businesses and helps them avoid disposal costs while
    finding low- or no-cost supplies or feedstocks. The Waste Reduction Awards
    Program (WRAP) recognizes California businesses that have made outstanding
    efforts to reduce nonhazardous waste and send less garbage to the landfill.

    construction and demolition waste management); reviewing activities and
    production processes; recommending waste prevention options; preparing

<CENTER><H3>VENTURA COUNTY LEADS STATE IN RECYCLED OIL
USE</H3></CENTER>

<P>
<DD><B>THOUSAND OAKS</B>--<P>The <B>California Integrated Waste
Management Board</B> today honored Ventura County and all 10
county cities for their pioneering use of re-refined motor oil in
their fleet vehicles.<P>

     <DD>"Ventura County's use of re-refined motor oil is an
example of government's expanding environmental awareness.
Getting the maximum mileage possible out of every quart of crude
should be incentive enough to give American Petroleum Institute
(API)-certified re-refined petroleum products a second look,"
said Waste Board Chairman Daniel G. Pennington.  "We hope county
residents will also take note of how well re-refined oil works
and consider using it in their cars and trucks."<P>

     <DD>Pennington today presented commendations to
representatives of the local jurisdictions, as well as
representatives of businesses that sell re-refined oil to the
public.  Frank Schillo, Chairman of the Board of Supervisors, and
Judy Lazar, Mayor Pro Tem of Thousand Oaks, also spoke at the
event.<P>

     <DD>Re-refined oil is used motor oil that has been cleansed
of dirt, microscopic metal contaminants, and chemical additives. 
Fresh additives replace ones removed during the refinement
process and re-refined oil that meets industry standards is API-
certified.  Nearly all of the county's 1,400 vehicles logged an
estimated 13 million problem-free miles on re-refined petroleum
lubricants in fiscal year 1995-96. The area is the first known
region in the entire country to put re-refined motor oil to such
widespread official transportation use.<P>  

     <DD>Pennington cited Thousand Oaks for operating the only
closed-loop re-refined oil program in the county.  Twice a month,
its Used Oil Recycling Program collects approximately 1,200
gallons of used oil, re-refines it, and sells it back to the city
for less than the cost of virgin crude.  Thousand Oaks' entire
fleet of 350 vehicles operates on re-refined motor oil
exclusively.  The city publicly promotes the benefits of re-
refined oil with incentive and discount programs and recently met
with oil companies to develop a marketing plan with three of the
largest grocery chains in California.<P> 

     <DD>Growing use of re-refined oil may help solve the problem
of what to do with the 118 million gallons of used oil generated
in California each year.  An estimated 74 million gallons of used
oil are recycled each year in the State, leaving the disposal of
more than 40 million gallons unaccounted for.  The improper
disposal of used motor oil threatens waterways in California. 
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a single
gallon of motor oil has the potential to contaminate one million
gallons of water.<P>
  
     <DD>"Motor oil never actually wears out," Pennington said. 
"It gets dirty and needs to be cleaned.  If it wears the API
stamp of approval, re-refined oil is as good as virgin oil.  Even
new car manufacturers recognize API-approved re-refined motor oil
as safe to use."<P>

     <DD>Mercedes-Benz, Ford, General Motors, Detroit Diesel, and
Chrysler approve the use of re-refined oils in their automobiles,
as long as the product meets industry standards.  Last spring,
the State Department of General Services awarded its second,
consecutive two-year Statewide Lubrication Contract to a number
of vendors, making it possible for local governments to purchase
re-refined oil through the State.  The contract allows the
purchase of an estimated 167,170 gallons of re-refined oil
annually, a 179 percent increase over the 60,000 gallons bought
in 1995.  Nearly three dozen governmental agencies and private
companies--including Coldwell Banker, PG&E, Wal-Mart, and AT&T--
use re-refined motor oil in their vehicles.<P>

     <DD>In April, a Waste Board-sponsored phone survey of 140
city and county fleet managers from around the state found that
93 percent of all agencies using re-refined motor oil rated the
product as either "good" or "excellent."  Most agencies,
according to the survey, had used re-refined oil for up to five
years and 80 percent of those responding cited re-refined oil's
"environmental-friendly" merits as compelling reasons for trying
the product.<P>

<CENTER><H3>CAL POLY COMPOST EFFORT A SUCCESS</H3></CENTER>

<P>
<DD><B>SACRAMENTO</B>--In its efforts to market compost as a key
part of its strategy to attain mandated 50 percent waste stream
diversion levels by 2000, the <B>California Integrated Waste
Management Board</B> has found both an ally and shining example
in Pomona's California State Polytechnic University "LandLab"
experiment.  Built partly on the adjacent 200-acre Spadra
Landfill in east Los Angeles County, LandLab's compost operation
is a visual feast of restored, brightly hued native landscaping
that makes a compelling case for organically induced reclamation
projects and state-of-the-art landfill technology.<P>

     <DD>"The LandLab compost project is a fine example of the
value of compost for commercial and private uses," said Waste
Board Chairman Daniel G. Pennington.  "Cal Poly is to be highly
commended for so successfully demonstrating what could well
represent California's reclaimed landfills of the future."<P>

     <DD>In a recent presentation at the Waste Board's Sacramento
headquarters, LandLab director Dr. Edwin Barnes described the
composting project's progress from its modest startup in 1993 on
campus grounds to a gardening showcase today.<P>
  
     <DD>LandLab uses urban "green waste"--leaves, chipped
vegetation, manure, and unchipped landscape debris--from six
surrounding cities and unincorporated areas to landscape campus
grounds as well as portions of the 200-acre Spadra landfill. 
Moreover, by diverting green wastes, LandLab saved communities
landfilling costs and reduced dependency on chemical fertilizers. 
 In another effort, LandLab also successfully used waste paper
pulp to grow a field of pumpkins.  Sales from this field last
autumn generated $40,000 in revenue for the university, Dr.
Barnes said.<P>

     <DD>The Waste Board has co-funded five compost demonstration
projects in Central Valley farms over the past few years.  The
projects are demonstrating the economic and agribusiness worth of
organic soil amendments compared to traditional chemical
fertilizers.  For informational publications on composting, call
the Waste Board Hotline at 1-800-553-2962.<P>

<CENTER><H3>GARBAGE TRANSFER STATIONS JOIN WASTE BOARD'S TIERED
REGULATIONS</H3></CENTER>

<P>
<DD><B>SACRAMENTO</B>--Solid waste transfer operations that hande
limited amounts of refuse but do not actually process the
materials are the latest beneficiaries of new, more flexible
State tiered regulations administered by the <B>California
Integrated Waste Management Board</B>.<P>  

     <DD>"The Waste Board welcomes limited volume transfer
stations into our regulatory tiers, where permit requirements
more aptly fit the processes," explained Waste Board Chairman
Daniel G. Pennington.  "In keeping with Governor Wilson's mandate
to streamline burdensome laws and regulations without
compromising public safety, our tiered level approach to working
with California's solid waste stream represents a significant
step in achieving that objective."<P>

     <DD>The new regulations state that limited volume transfer
operations receiving 60 cubic yards or less of solid wastes on
any operating day, along with sealed container transfer
operations that receive solid wastes in sealed containers, pose
little in the way of health and safety risks and require less
scrutiny than large-scale operations.  Instead, State waste
regulators decided such transfer operations belonged under the
Waste Board's regulatory "Enforcement Agency Notification
Tier."<P>

     <DD>To comply with the law, limited volume transfer
operators must file written notification with enforcement
agencies, stating their location, identifying owner/operators,
describing their  operations, and certifying the information
supplied is true and accurate.  At a later date, the Waste Board
will consider "slotting" transfer stations that receive more than
60 cubic yards of solid wastes daily into appropriate levels of
its tier structure.<P>  

     <DD>Limited volume and sealed container transfer operations
are just the latest refuse handling operations in the tiers
system.  Nearly a year ago, the Waste Board slotted organic
composting operations into tiers and followed in July this year
with nonhazardous petroleum-contaminated soil facilities.<P>

     <DD>The Waste Board's regulatory tiers provide five separate
categories in which types of waste handling businesses are
regulated according to the potential public health and
environmental safety risks associated with each operation.  The
tiers replace a "one-size-fits-all" approach that worked better
before California's waste handling system diversified into a
broad mosaic of landfills, material recovery and transfer
stations, sludge and ash operations, and other businesses.<P>  

     <DD>In its simplest form, the "excluded tier," a business
only has to operate in accordance with local regulations.  At the
most rigorous level, the "full permit tier," businesses are
required to submit a complete application package, a thorough
inventory of its operations, and file record keeping data with
the State and local agencies; show proof of compliance with the
California Environmental Quality Act; undergo monthly inspections
by the enforcement agency; and adhere to minimum operating
standards.<P>

<CENTER><H3>WASTE BOARD BEGINS CLEANUP OF FRESNO COUNTY TIRE FIRE
SITE</H3></CENTER>

<P>
<DD><B>SACRAMENTO</B>--Work began this week to clean up the site
in western Fresno County where nearly one million illegally
stockpiled waste tires burned following an arson fire in May. 
Contractors for the <B>California Integrated Waste Management
Board</B> will spend the next month moving contaminated soil,
covering burn ash, and improving drainage at the former Choperena
Illegal Waste Tire Site, covering 10 acres of canyon walls off
Little Panoche Road.<P>  

     <DD>"With high levels of hazardous materials posing a threat
to public health and safety and particularly the nearby Little
Panoche Creek, we have made this cleanup a top priority," said
Waste Board Chairman Daniel G. Pennington.  "Our crews will work
as quickly and effectively as possible to ensure that any
environmental risks from ash or runoff are corrected before the
rainy season gets under way."<P>

     <DD>The $450,000 Waste Board-funded cleanup will involve
moving soil -- containing steel belts from melted tires and ash
residue with high levels of zinc and other heavy metals -- to the
upper portion of the canyon, placing a clay cover over it,
reworking drainage and providing erosion control.<P>

     <DD>On May 20, an arsonist started several fires along
Little Panoche Road adjacent to the Choperena Illegal Waste Tire
Site.  As the fires merged, they burned into the canyon where
nearly 3 million tires had been illegally stockpiled.  The fire
ignited the site, threatening PG&E transmission lines overhead. 
The lines are an integral part of the state's power grid.<P>

     <DD>The expedited cleanup of the Choperena site is made
possible through funds from the Board's Illegal Disposal Site
Cleanup Program.  The program began in 1994 as a way for the
State to help local governments remediate closed disposal sites
and clean up abandoned and illegal disposal sites.  The Waste
Board funds these cleanups through grants to local government, by
hiring a contractor and managing the cleanup itself, or through
loans to local governments.  Since the program began, the Board
has approved more than $18 million for cleanup of 47 sites
statewide.<P>

<CENTER><H3>IMPERIAL COUNTY ILLEGAL DUMP UNDERGOES STATE
CLEANUP</H3></CENTER>

<P>
<DD><B>SACRAMENTO</B>--Contractors for the <B>California
Integrated Waste Management Board</B>  have begun work at the
illegal Heber Dump in Imperial County as part of a State-funded
cleanup operation aimed at protecting neighborhoods and the
environment from dangerous accumulations of trash and debris.<P>

     <DD>Homes, crop fields, and water storage ponds for the
Heber Water Treatment Plant are located within 1,000 feet of the
illegal dump.  Unpermitted dumping grounds can pose fire and
ground water contamination risks, as well as harbor disease-
carrying rodents and insects.<P>

     <DD>"The community of Heber can rest a little easier knowing
this unpermitted and hazardous pile of garbage is being
eliminated," said Waste Board Chairman Daniel G. Pennington.<P>

     <DD>Last June, the Waste Board approved spending up to
$25,000 to remove 500 cubic yards of debris from the dump to a
permitted landfill and secure the site against trespass. A
nuisance to the community of Heber since 1977, the abandoned dump
has been used for illicit paint sniffing and other drug activity.

Cleanup money will be used to trim trees on the lot to improve
visibility, fence the perimeter, and haul away demolished
structures, household refuse, syringes, and other drug
paraphernalia to an area landfill.<P>

<P>
<B>PROPOSED REGULATORY ACTION</B>
<P>
The California Integrated California Waste Management Board (CIWMB) proposes
to amend Title 14, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Division 7, Chapters
3 and 5, Articles as listed above. The proposed regulations would remove
existing overlap, conflict, and duplication in the regulations between the
CIWMB and the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB); and, further,
the proposed regulations will minimize overlap and duplication between the
CIWMB and Local Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) regarding the regulation of solid
waste disposal sites. The proposed amendment would also relocate specified
regulations from Title 14, Chapters 3 and 5, to Title 27, Division 2, Chapters
1 through 7, resulting in a consolidated set of regulations promulgated by
the CIWMB and SWRCB for landfills and disposal sites. Regulations being retained
in Title 14, Chapters 3 and 5, will be revised as needed to reflect the scope
and applicability for solid waste handling, transfer and processing aspects
that will remain in that Title.
<P>
<B>WRITTEN COMMENT PERIOD</B>
<P>
Any interested person, or his or her authorized representative, may submit
written comments relevant to the portions of the CIWMB's proposed regulatory
action to the CIWMB. Comments on the SWRCB-promulgated portion of the proposed
regulatory action should be directed to the SWRCB (see accompanying Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking - SWRCB). The written comment period closes at the
close of the public hearing to be held on September 11, 1996. The CIWMB will
only consider comments received at the CIWMB's headquarters by that time.

<B>INFORMATIVE DIGEST</B>
<P>
The California Integrated Waste Management Act (Act), Public Resources Code
(PRC) section 40000 <I>et seq.</I>, provides for the protection of public
health and safety and the environment through waste prevention, waste diversion,
and safe waste processing and disposal. PRC sections 40502 and 43020 authorize
the CIWMB to adopt rules and regulations for purposes of implementing the
Act. Specifically, the Act requires the CIWMB to adopt and revise regulations
which set forth minimum standards for solid waste handling and disposal.
Further, PRC section 43103 requires the CIWMB, in cooperation with the SWRCB,
to revise its regulations as required by the Solid Waste Disposal Regulatory
Reform Act of 1993 (AB 1220/Eastin, <I>Stats. of 1993, c. 656</I>, hereafter
referred to <B>AB 1220 </B>).
<P>
In 1977, pursuant to the State Solid Waste Management Act (the predecessor
to the current Act and <B>AB 1220</B>), the CIWMB adopted regulations setting
forth Minimum Standards for Solid Waste Handling and Disposal and regulations
for Enforcement of Solid Waste Standards and Administration of Solid Waste
Facilities Permits; Loan Guarantees. Within these regulations are the
requirements for disposal site operation, permitting, closure and financial
responsibility. The Act required the adoption of regulations specifying
procedures for proper closure and postclosure maintenance including plans
and financial responsibilities.
<P>
Under Subtitle D of RCRA, Congress directed the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) to develop regulations governing the management
of solid waste, including regulations for operation, closure and financial
responsibility of municipal solid waste landfills that, in California, are
subject to CIWMB regulations promulgated in Title 14, California Code of
Regulations. Congress allows a state to assume responsibility for regulating
municipal solid waste disposal (<B>MSW landfills</B>). California has applied
for, and received, USEPA approval as an approved State to implement the
provisions of 40CFR258, the Federal Rules that USAEPA promulgated under RCRA.
The proposed CIWMB action is consistent with Federal Rules and maintains
the requirements necessary to allow continued USEPA approval of the aspects
of California's solid waste program consistent with the authority granted
to the CIWMB under the Act and <B>AB 1220</B>.
<P>
The Solid Waste Disposal Regulatory Reform Act (<B>AB 1220</B>) directs the
SWRCB and the California Integrated Waste Management Board (<B>CIWMB</B>)
to develop one consolidated set of solid waste disposal facility regulations
including, one consolidated permit application that requires the operator
to develop only one technical report to incorporate the requirements of both
the solid waste facility permit and waste discharge requirements; and, if
possible, the two agencies' financial assurance requirements. <B>AB 1220</B>
further directs that the CIWMB maintain only its authority to regulate only
those aspects of solid waste disposal that do not involve prevention of water
pollution. Furthermore, <B>AB 1220</B> directs that the promulgation of the
combined regulations not result in a decrease in environmental protection.
<P>
The Solid Waste Disposal Regulatory Reform Act shapes the development of
regulations as follows:
<P>
1) maintain a clear and concise division of authority and responsibility
to remove all areas of overlap, duplication and conflict between the CIWMB
and SWRCB in the regulation of solid waste disposal sites, without reducing
current state minimum standards for environmental protection;
<P>
2) consolidate regulations for these sites;
<P>
3) streamline the process for obtaining a full solid waste facility permit;
and
<P>
4) clarify and remove overlap in the roles of the local enforcement agency
(LEA) and CIWMB.
<P>
<B>AB 1220</B> contains many specific provisions that are implemented by
the proposed regulations. <B>AB 1220</B> requires the CIWMB to effectuate
a clear division of authority between the SWRCB and CIWMB by developing a
consolidated set of solid waste disposal facility regulations where distinct
chapters are written and implemented by the appropriate agency. Further,
<B>AB 1220</B> directed that a clear and concise division of responsibilities
shall be maintained to minimize overlap and duplication between the CIWMB
and the certified local enforcement agencies. The purpose for the separation
of authority is to:
<P>
1) make clear that the SWRCB and RWQCBs are the sole agencies regulating
the disposal and classification of solid waste for the purpose of protecting
the waters of the state, and
<P>
2) have the CIWMB and LEAs regulate all other aspects of solid waste disposal
within the scope of their appropriate regulatory authority.
<P>
The proposed regulations are an attempt to merge all State requirements for
solid waste disposal facilities and sites. Applicable portions of CIWMB
regulations contained in Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations,
as well as SWRCB regulations contained in Chapter 15 of Title 23 of the
California Code of Regulations, will be moved and consolidated into Title
27. In addition, Title 27 will contain a single set of definitions promulgated
for use by SWRCB, RWQCBs, CIWMB and LEAs.
<P>
The proposed regulations establish a requirement for a joint technical document
as directed by <B>AB 1220</B>. Currently a Report of Disposal Site Information
is required as part of an application to the CIWMB for a solid waste facilities
permit while a Report of Waste Discharge is required by the Regional Water
Quality Control Board as part of an application for Waste Discharge Requirements.
These two technical documents contain significant amounts of information
that are similar or identical. The proposed regulation package would eliminate
this duplication by establishing a requirement for a joint technical document
that will be submitted to both agencies.
<P>
The proposed regulations will also attempt to eliminate many areas of overlap
between the CIWMB and Local Enforcement Agencies. In general, this will be
accomplished by removing as best as practicle the CIWMB from review/approval
authority within the regulations except where this authority is explicitly
provided in statute or in applicable portions of the Code of Federal Regulations.
The result will be that the LEA will have stand-alone authority for approvals
and oversight where applicable. Some notable exceptions to this are the areas
of financial assurances, closure plans, Federal Subtitle D approvals, and
solid waste facility permits. For financial assurances, the responsibility
for review and approval will remain with the CIWMB as mandated by existing
statute and not changed by <B>AB 1220</B>. The other major areas where the
CIWMB will maintain its statutory mandates within the regulations are, approval
authority for closure plans, authority for Federal Subtitle D approvals,
and concurrence authority for permits.
<P>
<B>Scope of the rulemaking</B>
<P>
This rulemaking is initiated to achieve compliance with <B>AB 1220</B> and
is limited to 1) maintaining applicability to landfills and disposal sites;
2) moving without regulatory effect, portions of Title 14 that apply to landfills
and disposal sites into Title 27; 3) revising (and moving) existing landfill
and disposal site regulations in order to remove aspects for the protection
of water quality and inserting where necessary, applicable provisions to
protect public health and safety and the environment; 4) removing duplicative
roles between the CIWMB and its LEAs where applicable; 5) combining applicable
CIWMB and SWRCB definitions into a consolidated set of definitions; 6)
establishing requirements for a joint application for both the Report of
Waste Discharge and Solid Waste Facility Permit, and streamlining the permitting
process; 7) establishing requirements for a joint technical document; 8)
retaining CIWMB authority for those provisions that are statutorily or federally
mandated; 9) combining SWRCB and CIWMB closure and postclosure maintenance
requirements into on set of regulations which require one closure plan to
be prepared for each solid waste landfill; and 10) leaving the remaining
portions of Chapters 3 and 5 of Title 14 unaffected for this rulemaking,
yet, at the same time, revising certain sections of Title 14 to apply to
the scope of the unaffected regulations.
<P>
<B>PLAIN ENGLISH REQUIREMENTS</B>
<P>
CIWMB staff has determined that it is not feasible to draft the regulations
in plain English due to the technical nature of the regulations; however,
a non-controlling, plain English summary of the regulations is available
from the contact person named in this notice.
<P>
<B>PLAIN ENGLISH POLICY STATEMENT</B>
<P>
The proposed regulations would create a clear and concise division of authority
and responsibility&#190;&#190;removing all areas of overlap, duplication
and conflict&#190;&#190;between the CIWMB and the SWRCB in the regulation
of solid waste disposal sites without reducing current State minimum standards
for environmental protection; consolidate regulations for these sites; and
clarify and remove overlap in the roles of the LEAs and the CIWMB. This action
would merge existing CIWMB regulations for disposal sites, contained in Title
14 of the California Code of Regulations (14 CCR,) with existing SWRCB
regulations, for waste management units, found in 23 CCR, Chapter 15 and
move the merged regulations to 27 CCR.
<P>
<B>AUTHORITY AND REFERENCES</B>
<P>
PRC sections 40502, 43020, 43030, and 43103 provide authority for these
regulations. The CIWMB proposes to reference PRC sections 43000 through 45042
and the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 257 and 258.
<P>
<B>MANDATES ON LOCAL AGENCIES OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS</B>
<P>
CIWMB staff has determined pursuant to Government Code section 11346.9, that
adoption of the proposed regulations will not impose a mandate on school
districts, nor will they impose any non-discretionary costs or savings on
them. The CIWMB staff has also determined that the regulations do not place
a mandate on local agencies. CIWMB staff has determined that the regulations
do not impose any non-discretionary costs or savings on local agencies.
<P>
<B>COST TO PUBLIC AGENCIES, SCHOOL DISTRICTS,</B>
<P>
<B>AND STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS</B>
<P>
CIWMB staff has determined pursuant to Government Code section 11346.5(a)(5)
and (6), that the proposed regulations will result in no costs or savings
to any state agencies, and no costs to any local agencies or school districts
that are required to be reimbursed under Part 7 (commencing with section
17500) of Division 4 of the Government Code, no other non-discretionary costs
or savings on local agencies or school districts, and no costs or savings
in federal funding to the state.
<P>
<B>EFFECT ON HOUSING COSTS</B>
<P>
CIWMB staff has determined pursuant to Government Code section 11346.5(a)(11),
that the proposed regulations will have no significant adverse impact on
housing costs.
<P>
<B>EFFECTS ON BUSINESS AND SMALL BUSINESS</B>
<P>
CIWMB staff has determined that the proposed regulations, will have a net
zero economic impact on businesses. The proposed regulations simply reorganize
and clarify the authority of agencies enforcing the existing requirements.
The proposed regulations integrate permitting and approval processes for
solid waste disposal sites with applicable requirements of the SWRCB with
no substantive economic impacts.
<P>
<B>COST IMPACT ON PRIVATE PERSONS OR ENTERPRISES</B>
<P>
CIWMB staff has determined pursuant to Government Code section 11346.2(a)(9),
that the adoption of the proposed regulations will not have a cost impact
on private persons or enterprises.
<P>
<B>EFFECT ON COMPETITION WITH OUT-OF-STATE BUSINESS</B>
<P>

11346.5, that the proposed regulations will not have a significant adverse
economic impact on business, including California businesses' ability to
compete with out-of-state business.
<P>
<B>EFFECT ON CREATION OR ELIMINATION OF JOBS, EXISTING OR NEW BUSINESS IN
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA</B>
<P>
In accordance with Government Code section 11346.3, CIWMB staff has determined
that the proposed regulatory action will not affect the creation or elimination
of jobs within the State of California, the creation of new businesses or
the elimination of existing businesses within California, or the expansion
of businesses currently doing business within the State.
<P>
<B>CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVES</B>
<P>
In accordance with Government Code sections 11346.2 and 11346.9, the CIWMB

<P>
<B>STATUS AND TRANSMITTAL OF REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING AB 1220: &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15 DAY COMMENT PERIOD</B>
<P>
The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) and State Water
Resources Control Board (SWRCB) have prepared a revised version of the proposed
regulations implementing AB 1220 (Chapter 656, Statutes of 1993). AB 1220
requires reduction of overlap, duplication, and conflict among the CIWMB,
SWRCB, and Local Enforcement Agencies. The modified regulatory language will
be moved from Title 14 and Chapter 15 of Title 23 and placed in Title 27
of the California Code of Regulations (CCR). This includes all requirements
for discharges of solid waste to land from Chapter 15. Requirements for
discharges of hazardous waste to land will remain in Chapter 15.
<P>
If you have previously asked to receive the proposed regulations or if you
commented on the July, 1996 version of the regulations, a copy is enclosed.
The proposed regulations incorporate all changes made in response to comments
received during the forty five day comment period that ended September 11,
1996. Only comments on the changes made since the last version will be
considered; these changes are double underlined in this version of the proposed
regulations. Comments are due by 5:00 p.m. on December 4. 1996.
<P>
We intend to continue to follow a joint process for our rulemakings. We plan
to hold a joint CIWMB Permitting and Enforcement Committee Meeting and SWRCB
Workshop prior to adoption, if feasible. Later, the CIWMB and the SWRCB will
hold Board Meetings for consideration of adoption at the same time and place,
if feasible. We anticipate consideration of adoption in early 1997. You will
be apprised of the dates, times, and locations in advance.
<P>
Please send written comments to:
<P>
Ms. Sharon Anderson, Permitting &amp; Enforcement Division, California Integrated
Waste Management Board, 8800 Cal Center Drive, Sacramento, CA 95826.
<P>
Ms. Anderson will provide copies of your comments to the SWRCB.
<P>
If you have any questions pertaining to SWRCB requirements, please contact
Mr. Ed Wosika, Land Disposal Section, SWRCB at (916) 227 4389. Questions
pertaining to all other requirements should be directed to Ms. Anderson,
Enforcement Agency Section Supervisor, CIWMB at (916) 255 2379.

<P>
<TT>TRANSMITTAL OF CALIFORNIA INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT BOARD (CIWMB)/STATE
WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD (SWRCB) NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING FOR AB
1220 PROPOSED REGULATIONS</TT>
<P>
<TT>Enclosed for your review are the Notices of Proposed Rulemaking for CIWMB
and SWRCB proposed regulations implementing AB 1220 (Chapter 656, Statutes
of 1993). AB 1220 requires reduction of overlap, duplication, and conflict
among the CIWMB, SWRCB, and Local Enforcement Agencies. The modified regulatory
language will be moved from Title 14 and Chapter 15 of Title 23 and placed
in Title 27 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR). This includes all
requirements for discharges of solid waste to land from Chapter 15. Requirements
for discharges of hazardous waste to land will remain in Chapter 15.</TT>
<P>
<TT>The formal notice of the proposed rulemaking is on July 26, 1996. The
scope of the regulations is primarily limited to AB 1220 implementation.
Both the SWRCB and the CIWMB may consider making substantive changes in future
rulemakings.</TT>
<P>
<TT>Please note that if you have previously requested to receive the proposed
regulations, a copy is enclosed. These proposed regulations incorporate prior
input from Local Enforcement Agencies, Regional Water Quality Control Boards
(RWQCBs), the AB 1220 Working Group (a committee of industry, government,
and environmental representatives), and interested parties.</TT>
<P>
<TT>We intend to follow a joint process for our rulemakings. This entails
a joint public hearing on Wednesday, September 11 at 1:00 p.m. at the CIWMB
Meeting Room, 8800 Cal Center Drive, Sacramento, CA 95826. The remainder
of the process will be discussed at the hearing, but most likely will include
a joint CIWMB Permitting and Enforcement Committee Meeting and SWRCB Workshop.
Later, CIWMB and SWRCB will hold Board Meetings for adoption at the same
time and place, if feasible. We anticipate adoption in early 1997. </TT>
<P>
<TT>The purpose of the September 11 hearing is to give the public an opportunity
to make oral comments on the Proposed Regulations. Written comments must
be received by the end of the public hearing in order to be considered. Each
section has been clearly identified as to which board is promulgating that
section. Therefore, please send comments on the CIWMB sections to:</TT>

<B>PROPOSED REGULATORY ACTION</B>
<P>
The California Integrated California Waste Management Board (CIWMB) proposes
to amend Title 14, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Division 7, Chapters
3 and 5, Articles as listed above. The proposed regulations would remove
existing overlap, conflict, and duplication in the regulations between the
CIWMB and the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB); and, further,
the proposed regulations will minimize overlap and duplication between the
CIWMB and Local Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) regarding the regulation of solid
waste disposal sites. The proposed amendment would also relocate specified
regulations from Title 14, Chapters 3 and 5, to Title 27, Division 2, Chapters
1 through 7, resulting in a consolidated set of regulations promulgated by
the CIWMB and SWRCB for landfills and disposal sites. Regulations being retained
in Title 14, Chapters 3 and 5, will be revised as needed to reflect the scope
and applicability for solid waste handling, transfer and processing aspects
that will remain in that Title.
<P>
<B>WRITTEN COMMENT PERIOD</B>
<P>
Any interested person, or his or her authorized representative, may submit
written comments relevant to the portions of the CIWMB's proposed regulatory
action to the CIWMB. Comments on the SWRCB-promulgated portion of the proposed
regulatory action should be directed to the SWRCB (see accompanying Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking - SWRCB). The written comment period closes at the
close of the public hearing to be held on September 11, 1996. The CIWMB will
only consider comments received at the CIWMB's headquarters by that time.

<B>INFORMATIVE DIGEST</B>
<P>
The California Integrated Waste Management Act (Act), Public Resources Code
(PRC) section 40000 <I>et seq.</I>, provides for the protection of public
health and safety and the environment through waste prevention, waste diversion,
and safe waste processing and disposal. PRC sections 40502 and 43020 authorize
the CIWMB to adopt rules and regulations for purposes of implementing the
Act. Specifically, the Act requires the CIWMB to adopt and revise regulations
which set forth minimum standards for solid waste handling and disposal.
Further, PRC section 43103 requires the CIWMB, in cooperation with the SWRCB,
to revise its regulations as required by the Solid Waste Disposal Regulatory
Reform Act of 1993 (AB 1220/Eastin, <I>Stats. of 1993, c. 656</I>, hereafter
referred to <B>AB 1220 </B>).
<P>
In 1977, pursuant to the State Solid Waste Management Act (the predecessor
to the current Act and <B>AB 1220</B>), the CIWMB adopted regulations setting
forth Minimum Standards for Solid Waste Handling and Disposal and regulations
for Enforcement of Solid Waste Standards and Administration of Solid Waste
Facilities Permits; Loan Guarantees. Within these regulations are the
requirements for disposal site operation, permitting, closure and financial
responsibility. The Act required the adoption of regulations specifying
procedures for proper closure and postclosure maintenance including plans
and financial responsibilities.
<P>
Under Subtitle D of RCRA, Congress directed the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) to develop regulations governing the management
of solid waste, including regulations for operation, closure and financial
responsibility of municipal solid waste landfills that, in California, are
subject to CIWMB regulations promulgated in Title 14, California Code of
Regulations. Congress allows a state to assume responsibility for regulating
municipal solid waste disposal (<B>MSW landfills</B>). California has applied
for, and received, USEPA approval as an approved State to implement the
provisions of 40CFR258, the Federal Rules that USAEPA promulgated under RCRA.
The proposed CIWMB action is consistent with Federal Rules and maintains
the requirements necessary to allow continued USEPA approval of the aspects
of California's solid waste program consistent with the authority granted
to the CIWMB under the Act and <B>AB 1220</B>.
<P>
The Solid Waste Disposal Regulatory Reform Act (<B>AB 1220</B>) directs the
SWRCB and the California Integrated Waste Management Board (<B>CIWMB</B>)
to develop one consolidated set of solid waste disposal facility regulations
including, one consolidated permit application that requires the operator
to develop only one technical report to incorporate the requirements of both
the solid waste facility permit and waste discharge requirements; and, if
possible, the two agencies' financial assurance requirements. <B>AB 1220</B>
further directs that the CIWMB maintain only its authority to regulate only
those aspects of solid waste disposal that do not involve prevention of water
pollution. Furthermore, <B>AB 1220</B> directs that the promulgation of the
combined regulations not result in a decrease in environmental protection.
<P>
The Solid Waste Disposal Regulatory Reform Act shapes the development of
regulations as follows:
<P>
1) maintain a clear and concise division of authority and responsibility
to remove all areas of overlap, duplication and conflict between the CIWMB
and SWRCB in the regulation of solid waste disposal sites, without reducing
current state minimum standards for environmental protection;
<P>
2) consolidate regulations for these sites;
<P>
3) streamline the process for obtaining a full solid waste facility permit;
and
<P>
4) clarify and remove overlap in the roles of the local enforcement agency
(LEA) and CIWMB.
<P>
<B>AB 1220</B> contains many specific provisions that are implemented by
the proposed regulations. <B>AB 1220</B> requires the CIWMB to effectuate
a clear division of authority between the SWRCB and CIWMB by developing a
consolidated set of solid waste disposal facility regulations where distinct
chapters are written and implemented by the appropriate agency. Further,
<B>AB 1220</B> directed that a clear and concise division of responsibilities
shall be maintained to minimize overlap and duplication between the CIWMB
and the certified local enforcement agencies. The purpose for the separation
of authority is to:
<P>
1) make clear that the SWRCB and RWQCBs are the sole agencies regulating
the disposal and classification of solid waste for the purpose of protecting
the waters of the state, and
<P>
2) have the CIWMB and LEAs regulate all other aspects of solid waste disposal
within the scope of their appropriate regulatory authority.
<P>
The proposed regulations are an attempt to merge all State requirements for
solid waste disposal facilities and sites. Applicable portions of CIWMB
regulations contained in Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations,
as well as SWRCB regulations contained in Chapter 15 of Title 23 of the
California Code of Regulations, will be moved and consolidated into Title
27. In addition, Title 27 will contain a single set of definitions promulgated
for use by SWRCB, RWQCBs, CIWMB and LEAs.
<P>
The proposed regulations establish a requirement for a joint technical document
as directed by <B>AB 1220</B>. Currently a Report of Disposal Site Information
is required as part of an application to the CIWMB for a solid waste facilities
permit while a Report of Waste Discharge is required by the Regional Water
Quality Control Board as part of an application for Waste Discharge Requirements.
These two technical documents contain significant amounts of information
that are similar or identical. The proposed regulation package would eliminate
this duplication by establishing a requirement for a joint technical document
that will be submitted to both agencies.
<P>
The proposed regulations will also attempt to eliminate many areas of overlap
between the CIWMB and Local Enforcement Agencies. In general, this will be
accomplished by removing as best as practicle the CIWMB from review/approval
authority within the regulations except where this authority is explicitly
provided in statute or in applicable portions of the Code of Federal Regulations.
The result will be that the LEA will have stand-alone authority for approvals
and oversight where applicable. Some notable exceptions to this are the areas
of financial assurances, closure plans, Federal Subtitle D approvals, and
solid waste facility permits. For financial assurances, the responsibility
for review and approval will remain with the CIWMB as mandated by existing
statute and not changed by <B>AB 1220</B>. The other major areas where the
CIWMB will maintain its statutory mandates within the regulations are, approval
authority for closure plans, authority for Federal Subtitle D approvals,
and concurrence authority for permits.
<P>
<B>Scope of the rulemaking</B>
<P>
This rulemaking is initiated to achieve compliance with <B>AB 1220</B> and
is limited to 1) maintaining applicability to landfills and disposal sites;
2) moving without regulatory effect, portions of Title 14 that apply to landfills
and disposal sites into Title 27; 3) revising (and moving) existing landfill
and disposal site regulations in order to remove aspects for the protection
of water quality and inserting where necessary, applicable provisions to
protect public health and safety and the environment; 4) removing duplicative
roles between the CIWMB and its LEAs where applicable; 5) combining applicable
CIWMB and SWRCB definitions into a consolidated set of definitions; 6)
establishing requirements for a joint application for both the Report of
Waste Discharge and Solid Waste Facility Permit, and streamlining the permitting
process; 7) establishing requirements for a joint technical document; 8)
retaining CIWMB authority for those provisions that are statutorily or federally
mandated; 9) combining SWRCB and CIWMB closure and postclosure maintenance
requirements into on set of regulations which require one closure plan to
be prepared for each solid waste landfill; and 10) leaving the remaining
portions of Chapters 3 and 5 of Title 14 unaffected for this rulemaking,
yet, at the same time, revising certain sections of Title 14 to apply to
the scope of the unaffected regulations.
<P>
<B>PLAIN ENGLISH REQUIREMENTS</B>
<P>
CIWMB staff has determined that it is not feasible to draft the regulations
in plain English due to the technical nature of the regulations; however,
a non-controlling, plain English summary of the regulations is available
from the contact person named in this notice.
<P>
<B>PLAIN ENGLISH POLICY STATEMENT</B>
<P>
The proposed regulations would create a clear and concise division of authority
and responsibility&#190;&#190;removing all areas of overlap, duplication
and conflict&#190;&#190;between the CIWMB and the SWRCB in the regulation
of solid waste disposal sites without reducing current State minimum standards
for environmental protection; consolidate regulations for these sites; and
clarify and remove overlap in the roles of the LEAs and the CIWMB. This action
would merge existing CIWMB regulations for disposal sites, contained in Title
14 of the California Code of Regulations (14 CCR,) with existing SWRCB
regulations, for waste management units, found in 23 CCR, Chapter 15 and
move the merged regulations to 27 CCR.
<P>
<B>AUTHORITY AND REFERENCES</B>
<P>
PRC sections 40502, 43020, 43030, and 43103 provide authority for these
regulations. The CIWMB proposes to reference PRC sections 43000 through 45042
and the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 257 and 258.
<P>
<B>MANDATES ON LOCAL AGENCIES OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS</B>
<P>
CIWMB staff has determined pursuant to Government Code section 11346.9, that
adoption of the proposed regulations will not impose a mandate on school
districts, nor will they impose any non-discretionary costs or savings on
them. The CIWMB staff has also determined that the regulations do not place
a mandate on local agencies. CIWMB staff has determined that the regulations
do not impose any non-discretionary costs or savings on local agencies.
<P>
<B>COST TO PUBLIC AGENCIES, SCHOOL DISTRICTS,</B>
<P>
<B>AND STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS</B>
<P>
CIWMB staff has determined pursuant to Government Code section 11346.5(a)(5)
and (6), that the proposed regulations will result in no costs or savings
to any state agencies, and no costs to any local agencies or school districts
that are required to be reimbursed under Part 7 (commencing with section
17500) of Division 4 of the Government Code, no other non-discretionary costs
or savings on local agencies or school districts, and no costs or savings
in federal funding to the state.
<P>
<B>EFFECT ON HOUSING COSTS</B>
<P>
CIWMB staff has determined pursuant to Government Code section 11346.5(a)(11),
that the proposed regulations will have no significant adverse impact on
housing costs.
<P>
<B>EFFECTS ON BUSINESS AND SMALL BUSINESS</B>
<P>
CIWMB staff has determined that the proposed regulations, will have a net
zero economic impact on businesses. The proposed regulations simply reorganize
and clarify the authority of agencies enforcing the existing requirements.
The proposed regulations integrate permitting and approval processes for
solid waste disposal sites with applicable requirements of the SWRCB with
no substantive economic impacts.
<P>
<B>COST IMPACT ON PRIVATE PERSONS OR ENTERPRISES</B>
<P>
CIWMB staff has determined pursuant to Government Code section 11346.2(a)(9),
that the adoption of the proposed regulations will not have a cost impact
on private persons or enterprises.
<P>
<B>EFFECT ON COMPETITION WITH OUT-OF-STATE BUSINESS</B>
<P>
CIWMB staff has determined pursuant to Government Code sections 11346.3 and
11346.5, that the proposed regulations will not have a significant adverse
economic impact on business, including California businesses' ability to
compete with out-of-state business.
<P>
<B>EFFECT ON CREATION OR ELIMINATION OF JOBS, EXISTING OR NEW BUSINESS IN
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA</B>
<P>
In accordance with Government Code section 11346.3, CIWMB staff has determined
that the proposed regulatory action will not affect the creation or elimination
of jobs within the State of California, the creation of new businesses or
the elimination of existing businesses within California, or the expansion
of businesses currently doing business within the State.
<P>
<B>CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVES</B>
<P>
In accordance with Government Code sections 11346.2 and 11346.9, the CIWMB
must determine that no alternative it considers would be more effective in
carrying out the purpose for which the action is proposed or would be as
effective and less burdensome to affected private persons than the proposed
action.

This planning document, <I><A HREF="plan/toc.htm">Meeting the 50 Percent
Challenge: Recycling Market Development Strategies through the Year
2000</A>,</I> (pub. #400-96-058) describes activities to assist local governments and the private
sector in achieving that reduction goal. &nbsp;The CIWMB (Board) will undertake
sixteen priority actions to stimulate use of secondary materials and demand
for products made from these materials. The list continues the priority materials
selected in the Board's 1993 plan (paper, plastic, and compostables) and
expands the priority list to include three additional materials: tires, urban
wood, and inerts. Additionally, the priority actions in the 1996 plan depart
from those in the 1993 plan by recognizing the importance of targeting collection
efficiency, by reducing the emphasis on mandatory programs, and by emphasizing
voluntary actions through partnerships and alliances amoung state agencies,
local governements, and private businesses.

      Do you change your car's motor oil? Did you know that State Certified Used
      Oil Collection Centers will take your used motor oil and will even pay you
      16&#162; a gallon?
      <P>
      When you take your used oil to a Certified Center for recycling, you are
      protecting the environment, conserving a valuable resource, and getting paid
      for it. That's a winning combination!
      <P>
      There is one catch. Certified Center managers will not accept used motor
      oil that has been contaminated with other fluids such as antifreeze, solvents,
      gasoline, or water. So please, don't mix your used oil with anything. However,
      if your used oil accidentally gets contaminated, your Certified Center manager
      can tell you where to take it for proper disposal.
      <P>
      <B>Business Owners/Operators</B>
      <P>
      Did you know that over 5 million California residents change their own motor
      oil? That's about one out of every five adults. Would you like to see some
      of those do-it-yourselfers come to your business?
      <P>
      When you become a State Certified Used Oil Collection Center and accept used
      motor oil from the public you increase your customer traffic, provide a valuable
      service to your community, and receive a 16&#162; per gallon recycling incentive
      from the California Integrated Waste Management Board.
      <P>
      If you own or operate an automotive parts retail shop, service or repair
      shop, gas station or auto dealership and are interested in becoming certified,
      complete a certification application and mail it to:

      If you own or operate equipment that generates used oil, you are considered
      an industrial generator of used oil. If you become a registered industrial
      generator, you can receive a 16&#162; per gallon recycling incentive for
      all the used oil generated by your equipment.
      <P>
      Curbside collection programs that pick up used oil may also become registered
      with the State. Once registered, program operators can receive the 16&#162;
      per gallon recycling incentive for all the used oil collected at curbside
      as well as used oil generated by program vehicles.
      <P>
      Private businesses, local governments, or special districts may become registered
      industrial generators or registered curbside collection programs. To become
      registered, complete a registration application and mail it to:

  Quarterly Report on California's Recycling Markets: <BR>
  Third Quarter 1996

<H3>
  Preface
</H3>
<P>
This issue of the California Integrated Waste Management Board's (CIWMB)
<I>Quarterly Report on California's Recycling Markets</I> debuts coverage
of a new group of recyclables: Construction &amp; Demolition (C&amp;D) Materials.
There are many important reasons for us to cover C&amp;D materials in this
report, including requests from our readers.
<P>
C&amp;D materials represent a significant percentage of the materials disposed
in California each year: 3.5 million tons in 1990, or 8.8 percent of all
materials disposed that year. The CIWMB recently identified C&amp;D materials
as one of its "priority" materials for market development in its recently
published document <I>Meeting the 50 Percent Challenge: Recycling Market</I>
<I>Development Strategies Through the Year 2000</I> (also referred to as
the recycling market development plan, or "the plan"). Major market development
opportunities for C&amp;D identified in the plan included developing
specifications for reused concrete, asphalt, and asphalt roofing, and the
promotion of new markets for clean drywall.
<P>
If you would like to receive a copy of the CIWMB's 1996 recycling market
development plan, please call the CIWMB's Recycling Hotline at 800-553-2962
and request Publication #400-96-058. (Outside of California, call 916-255-2296.)
<P>
Integral to the development of the plan were "Market Status Reports", prepared
by CIWMB staff, for the following secondary materials: Postconsumer Recovered
Paper, Postconsumer Plastics, Urban Compost and Mulch, Container and Plate
Glass, Ferrous Scrap, Inerts, Urban Wood, and Postconsumer Tires. Each of
the reports provides an overview of the recycling infrastructure and market
conditions for its respective secondary material(s), identifies barriers
to expanding markets, and outlines strategies for overcoming those barriers.
Additionally, staff prepared Market Status Reports on the CIWMB's "Buy Recycled"
and Industrial Market Development programs, and a paper on secondary materials
exports. If you would like any of these reports, please call the CIWMB's
Recycling Hotline.<BR>
<P>
<I><B>Landfilling of Recovered Materials in California?</B></I>
<P>
With the downturn in recycling markets for various secondary materials this
year, the media highlighted incidents of recovered materials sent to landfills.
Most reports of landfilled recyclables referred to such incidents on the
East Coast or in the Midwestregions of the U.S. with limited access to overseas
markets. However, with both domestic and overseas market prices for some
recyclables (such as mixed paper) near zero during the third quarter, it
is conceivable that materials recovered in California were sent to landfills.

  Quarterly Report on California's Recycling Markets: <BR>
  Third Quarter 1996
</H2>
<H3>
  U.S. Economic Summary
</H3>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Overall, the nation's economy was moderately expanding during
the third quarter of 1996, but at a slower rate than during the previous
two quarters.<SUP>1</SUP> &nbsp; Real (adjusted for inflation) Gross Domestic
Product rose at an annual rate of 4.2 percent during the third quarter, 0.5
percent less than second quarter growth, but up from 2 percent during the
first quarter and near zero during the fourth quarter of 1995.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The monthly economic indicators since June suggest that the
pace of output expansion has moderated. The economic indicator most telling
of recycling market conditions is <I>manufacturing production</I>, which
decelerated to a 3.3 percent growth rate during July-August, compared with
5.9 percent during January-June. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Other evidence of U.S. economic growth moderation during the
third quarter included: payroll employment gains averaged 145,000 jobs per
month in the third quarter, down from 236,000 additional jobs per month during
the first six months of 1996; residential construction spending was 2 percent
lower during July-August than in the previous three months; and real consumer
spending in July-August increased only moderately from its spring quarter
average.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Based on the University of Michigan report, the pace of annual
economic growth in the U.S. dropped to 2.4 percent in the third quarter of
1996, reflecting real final sales growth of 1.5 percent annually, combined
with some inventory stock-building.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Fourth Quarter Forecast</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Sluggish growth in real final sales is projected for the fourth
quarter. With inventory building projected to contribute a smaller boost
than during the third quarter, real GDP growth is forecast to slip to just
under <BR>
2 percent.</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Introduction</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This chapter covers the following six "grades" of postconsumer
recovered paper: </FONT>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <FONT SIZE=2>Old corrugated containers (OCC)</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT SIZE=2>Old newspapers (ONP)</FONT>
  <LI>

</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For a description of each paper grade, please see "Grade
Definitions" at the end of this chapter.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Third Quarter Summary</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Recovered paper markets finally ended their months-long slide
during the third quarter, as supply and demand began to come into balance.
However, weak overseas demand continued to hinder West Coast markets, and
there was little improvement in prices for California recovered paper throughout
the quarter. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>U.S. paperboard mills slowly began to increase production, reducing
their recovered paper inventories and increasing their purchases of the same
(particularly OCC). Generation of paper declined with reduced business activity
during the summer months, as is customary, and less paper was recovered due
to low prices paid by processors and mills.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>High grade deinking papers (CPO, WL) and SOP benefited from
increased virgin market pulp prices during July, which created increased
demand for deinked market pulp. Many deinked market pulp producers in the
Eastern U.S. increased production during the latter part of the quarter.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Markets for ONP and OMG remained in the doldrums as North American
newsprint producers continued to reduce production in a vain effort to halt
spiraling newsprint price declines. Additionally, overseas ONP demand was
extremely weak in August and September. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Mixed paper remained a grade with such low value that processors
charged to accept it (except where processors were under contract with a
municipality to pay a minimum price for mixed paper recovered via curbside
recycling programs). </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Grade Profiles</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Old Corrugated Containers</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Markets for OCC improved slightly during the third quarter for
all regions of the U.S.<I> except the West Coast.</I> West Coast OCC markets
did not improve, but did not lose ground, either, which was an improvement
in relative terms to the previous several months of declining demand and
prices. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>While the U.S. OCC recovery was driven primarily by increased
demand at domestic mills, overseas demand continued to slide due to weak
economic conditions in Asian countries, canceling the gains in domestic demand
and keeping prices and demand for OCC on the West Coast down. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Domestically, OCC demand grew due primarily to three factors:<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <FONT SIZE=2> Production by containerboard (linerboard and corrugating medium)
    mills increased as demand for corrugated containers increased.</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT SIZE=2> Inventories of OCC at containerboard and other paperboard mills
    dwindled, necessitating increased purchasing of OCC.</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT SIZE=2> OCC supplies shrank due to low prices paid by processors, spurring
    higher prices offered by mills.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>U.S. paperboard production figures for July (the most recent
month available at the time of publication) increased significantly over
June, and surpassed the July 1995 figure by 3.4 percent<SUP>2</SUP> , the
first month in 1996 that surpassed the production figure for the year-previous
month.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another sign that demand for corrugated containers increased
during the third quarter was that inventories of containerboard at mills
and box plants were down 11.1 percent in July compared with the same month
in 1995.<SUP>3</SUP></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>U.S. paperboard mills had built exceptionally large inventories
of OCC during the latter half of 1995 as production declined. Additionally,
many mills capitalized on low OCC prices by purchasing large quantities,
even though it was not needed to sustain production. As paperboard mills
began to increase production during the third quarter 1996, their OCC inventories
began to decline, and there was not as much inexpensive OCC available to
immediately replenish those inventories. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Supplies of recovered OCC diminished during the first and second
quarters of 1996 as prices fell. Recovery of OCC is perhaps more price-sensitive
than any other recovered paper grade. A good deal of OCC is recovered by
"scavengers" from refuse dumpsters, by refuse firms from transfer stations,
and by mixed waste material recovery facilities. These sources increase their
OCC recovery efforts when prices are high, and reduce their efforts when
prices are low. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The price paid by processors for OCC during the first two quarters
of 1996 fell below $20/ton, providing little incentive for recovery of OCC
from the wastestream. Initially, the decline in recovered supply did not
affect paperboard mills, as production was low. However, when production
increased during the third quarter, mills required more OCC and raised their
OCC purchase prices to stimulate supply.</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>Increased OCC Recycling Capacity in Northwest
</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Georgia-Pacific's (G-P) paper mill in Toledo, Oregon, added
considerable new capacity to consume OCC during the third quarter. (Full
capacity was reached on August 5.) The installation of new recycling equipment
allowed G-P to increase it's consumption of secondary fiber (over 90 percent
OCC) from 500 tons per day (tpd) to 1100 tpd. Eventually, G-P plans to increase
OCC consumption to 1300 tpd. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The 600 tpd increase in G-P's OCC recycling capacity is quite
significant, both from an industry standpoint and for California OCC markets.
Only a few paperboard mills in California (those producing linerboard) consume
more than 600 tpd of OCC. To meet their demand for OCC, G-P imports a great
deal from California: through the third quarter, about 30 percent of G-P's
OCC purchases originated in California.<SUP>4</SUP></FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>Exports Continue to Decline</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Weak overseas demand for OCC largely offset increased domestic
mill demand, suppressing any price gains in California. California OCC exports
fell from 67,876 metric tons in June to 57,798 metric tons in July, but rallied
in August (the most recent month for which export data was available) to
65,507 metric tons. By contrast, in July and August 1995, California OCC
exports totaled 83,802 and 103,049 metric tons, respectively. Trade journals
reported that exports to Asia in September were also weak. (See the following
table.)</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Poor economic conditions in Asian countries were responsible
for their weak demand for OCC (and other recovered paper grades). Many Asian
mills reportedly took extended downtime because of the lack of demand for
their products. Compounding this situation was a major increase of a tax
on finished goods in China, further reducing demand for paper products and
consequently reducing demand for recovered paper. </FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>Prices</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Market prices for OCC declined slightly during September, but
otherwise remained fairly stable during the third quarter, a vast improvement
from the steady price decline during the previous quarter.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Median OCC market prices, as reported in <I>Paper Recycler</I>,
began the quarter at $65/ton (unchanged from June), declined $5/ton in August
to $60/ton, then remained at that level in September. Median processor prices,
as reported in <I>Fibre Market News</I>, increased $5/ton in July to $22.50/ton,
then increased again in September to $25/ton. (See the following table. Also,
for prices from 1992 to the third quarter of 1996, see "Historical Price

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With the price of virgin market pulp as well as preconsumer
"pulp substitutes" on the rise, printing &amp; writing paper producers increased
their demand for deinked market pulp (DMP). Deinked market pulp mills responded
by increasing prices and boosting production for the first time in months.
The increased production translated into greater demand for HGD particularly
WLand sorted office paper (SOP). Additionally, tissue producers reportedly
increased their production during the third quarter, creating increased demand
for WL. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The increased demand for SOP by DMP producers was the first
such increase this year. SOP had fallen on hard times as many DMP producers
encountered quality problems with the grade, including higher-than-anticipated
percentages of groundwood fiber. Additionally, some newer mills had experienced
technical problems, slowing production. As a result, many DMP producers reduced
their consumption of SOP in favor of WL. However, during the slow spring
and summer months, many DMP producers apparently solved some of their technical
problems, and SOP suppliers worked harder at keeping groundwood paper within
allowable limits. Consequently, when DMP producers began to increase production,
they increased their demand for SOP (and WL as well).</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>Decline in Office Paper
Generation/Recovery</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A decline in both the generation and recovery of office papers
during the third quarter limited the available supply of such papers to paper
mills, boosting prices. The decline in generation was due to the seasonal
slowdown in office-based businesses. The decline in recovery was due to some
paper collectors (notably refuse haulers) scaling back their office paper
collection efforts in response to poor market conditions and the problems
marketing SOP to deinked market pulp mills. One large refuse hauler reportedly
scaled back its office paper collection efforts in the Houston, Texas, area
by 50 percent.<SUP>7</SUP> </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Median market prices for CPO, WL, and SOP, as reported in <I>Paper
Recycler</I>, all held steady or increased on a month-to-month basis during
the third quarter. Median processor prices, as reported in <I>Fibre Market
News</I>, held steady throughout the quarter, with no reported change. (See
the following tables. Also, for prices from 1992 to the third quarter of

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Markets for ONP remained extremely weak during the third quarter,
both domestically and overseas. It was surprising, then, that prices at both
the market and processor levels remained unchanged throughout the quarter.
</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>Newsprint Producer Downtime Continues</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Demand for ONP by North American newsprint producers remained
low throughout the third quarter as mills particularly those in Canada continued
to take downtime in an effort to reverse continued newsprint price drops.
Average West Coast transaction price for 30 lb. newsprint, as reported in
<I>Pulp &amp; Paper Week</I>, declined during each month of the third quarter,
ending at $570/metric ton. Newsprint prices have fallen every month since
April 1996, when they were $740/metric ton.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In spite of newsprint producer downtime, newspaper publishers
were able to avoid any newsprint price increases during the third quarter,
primarily for two reasons. First, both publishers and producers had large
inventories of newsprint on hand. Publisher inventories averaged 44 days
worth of newsprint in August<SUP>8</SUP> , which put them in the drivers
seat when bargaining on newsprint prices. Producers had nearly 750,000 metric
tons of inventory at the end of July, the highest amount since
1991-92.<SUP>9</SUP></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The other reason that newspaper publishers were able to avoid
newsprint price hikes was that their demand for newsprint was customarily
down during the summer due to less advertisements in newspapers. Newspaper
publishers' consumption of newsprint traditionally reaches its lowest point
in August. </FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>Exports Down</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Overseas mills provided no relief for beleaguered ONP markets.
ONP exports in July and August were extremely low, while September's exports
were reportedly no better. As with OCC, poor overseas demand reflected reduced
production by overseas mills due to stale economies. (See the following
table.)</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>In spite of reduced domestic and overseas ONP demand, prices
remained unchanged at both the market and processor levels throughout the

prices, which could have triggered shortages and ultimately, higher
prices.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT><I><B><FONT SIZE=2>East Coast ONP Disposed
</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The unfortunate consequence of municipal collection of recyclables
during periods of rock-bottom markets struck ONP on the East Coast during
the third quarter, as some recovered loads were reportedly landfilled or
incinerated. Even with the East Coast's high landfill tip fees, if there
is not demand for a recovered material at <I>any</I> price, the only option
for the material (other than storage) is disposal.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Most of the East Coast's ONP is consumed by Canadian newsprint
mills, which were those taking the most downtime during the third quarter.
Additionally, the East Coast's most accessible overseas markets -- those
in Europe - were largely idle during the summer months, as is customary.
Consequently, there were times when there was simply no market for recovered
ONP, and so it was landfilled or incinerated. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Even though ONP markets on the West Coast were in bad shape
during the third quarter, there were no widespread rumors of ONP landfilled
in California. (However, it is conceivable that some landfilling of ONP did
take place.) </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Mixed Paper</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Mixed paper markets continued to deteriorate during the third
quarter, with prices paid by both domestic and overseas mills for delivered
loads very close to zero, or in some cases in negative values. The poor market
conditions for OCC and ONP (in particular) were responsible for keeping demand
and price for MP down. With prices for OCC and ONP at low levels, many domestic
paper mills that can consume MP opted to use cleaner, more predictable sorted
OCC and ONP instead. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Somewhat paradoxically, exports of MP from California increased
substantially in July and August (see the following table), which is not
suggested by the static export prices. There are two likely explanations
for the increase in MP exports: first, overseas mills were capitalizing on
the rock-bottom prices for MP by building inventories. Tough inspections
of MP shipments to China, which slowed shipping times considerably, gave
overseas buyers that much more leverage to offer low prices for MP. Second,
mills were likely substituting MP for ONP, suggested by the low ONP shipments
during July and August. (See export table under previous "ONP" subsection.)

<FONT SIZE=2>The relatively strong overseas demand for MP kept the material
moving to markets, in spite of low prices. California was and is fortunate
to have export market outlets for its recovered MP, given that domestic mills
provide very little demand for this material. On the East Coast, landfilling
of recovered MP was quite commonplace during the third quarter, due to a
lack of market outlets. It is also possible that some MP recovered through
California's curbside recycling programs was landfilled during the third
quarter. </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Mixed paper prices continued to tumble during the third quarter.
Market prices, as reported in <I>Paper Recycler</I>, dropped by 50 percent
in July to $7.50/ton, then declined to $5/ton in August, remaining at that
level in September. Processor prices, as reported in <I>Fibre Market News</I>,
dropped from $-10 in June to $-30 in July, remaining at that level through
August and September. The negative prices charged by processors reflected
their costs of handling and shipping the material to market, but in fact
did not entirely cover these costs, given the extremely low market prices.

of 1996, see "Historical Price Charts" at the end of this report.)</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Fourth Quarter Preview</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>October brought increased demand and prices for some recovered
paper grades, but there were signs that those market conditions would not
continue during the fourth quarter. The U.S. economy appeared to continue
its third quarter slowdown into October, and export markets remained weak.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>OCC fared well in October, with both West Coast domestic and
overseas prices increasing. However, OCC prices will likely not continue
to increase during the fourth quarter, as it is traditionally a period of
lower OCC prices, primarily for two reasons: lower production by containerboard
mills (following increased third quarter production to supply box plants
with increased holiday inventories), and higher OCC generation due to holiday
merchandise stocking at retail stores. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Prices for all three major office paper grades either increased
or remained stable during October. Strong demand for white ledger by tissue
producers who were running strong production schedules indirectly increased
demand for less expensive sorted office paper by deinked market pulp producers.
However, business demand for printing &amp; writing papers is traditionally
slow during the fourth quarter, so it is unlikely that recovered office paper
prices will increase much more during the fourth quarter. Additionally, virgin
market pulp prices, which either remained stable or improved in October,
are not likely to increase much if at all for the duration of the year. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>ONP demand remained flat during October, as newsprint producers
continued to curtail production to balance supply with demand. Domestic ONP
markets will likely remain at least stable if not improve during November
and December. Newspaper publishers traditionally increase their consumption
of newsprint during the fourth quarter, as holiday advertising increases
substantially. If publisher newsprint inventories dwindle to the point that
they must significantly increase purchases, and overseas ONP demand remains
at least stable, ONP prices may increase during the fourth quarter.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Fourth quarter market conditions for old magazines should parallel
those for ONP, with any hope for improvement hinging on increased demand
for newsprint by newspaper publishers. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Demand and prices for mixed paper are expected to remain low
throughout the fourth quarter. </FONT>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<FONT SIZE=2>After months with no change, the average sales price for bulk
compost from yard trimmings in the Southwestern U.S. (including California)
decreased slightly during the third quarter, while the average price for
bulk yard trimmings mulch increased somewhat. It's possible that compost
was moved at bargain rates to make room at compost facilities for the vast
quantities of residential yard trimmings generated during the summer. The
higher price for mulch was unexpected, and no explanation is readily
apparent.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The price decline for compost could have been a result of local
oversupply, due to a surplus of feedstock. More yard trimmings are generated
and collected in the summer months, and the unusually wet spring and hot
summer temperatures in most of the state likely resulted in excessive quantities
of yard trimmings. Municipal composting programs usually compost all incoming
material, so supply is not always in balance with demand, especially for
new programs that have yet to identify local markets for the compost produced.
Additionally, prices could have been lowered at a few locations to liquidate
surplus product.<BR>

a surprise, with the reasons for the increase unknown. A price
<I>decrease</I> in California would have been more likely because of the
surplus of green material redirected to compost and mulch operations due
to the closure of biomass energy facilities. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Yard trimmings mulch also referred to as "clean green" mulch
is usually screened or chipped, and can be used as feedstock for composting
or applied directly on the soil for farm and orchard applications. Mulch
aids both water retention and weed suppression. In addition, recent research
indicates some plant diseases may be suppressed through the use of mulch.
It is possible that demand for mulch is increasing as news spreads about
the benefits of mulch, resulting in higher prices in some areas.</FONT>

<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>Local Program News</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Through the third quarter, California had 173 curbside collection
programs for yard trimmings<SUP>12</SUP>, with more on the way. &nbsp; Sacramento
County, which has been conducting a pilot program for automated collection
of yard trimmings, announced plans to implement county wide pickup over the
next few years. Variable-can rates are a part of the final plan, which will
use the existing 90-gallon refuse cans for yard trimmings, and offer residents
a choice of 90-, 60- or 38-gallon cans for refuse. Residents will be charged
the current monthly rate for the 60-gallon refuse can, more for the 90-gallon
can and less for the 38-gallon can. Up to 40 percent of the waste stream
in Sacramento County is green waste, so diversion of yard trimmings via this
collection program will play a major role in this county's effort to reach
50 percent diversion by the year 2000. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A few composters in Central and Northern California reported
a slight increase in yard trimmings compost prices for September. One city
in Northern California raised prices by $1/cu yd for its locally produced
yard trimmings compost and mulch after a city council member contended that
the products were underpriced. </FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>Composting Capacity Update</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The number of composting facilities and operations in California
continues to grow. During the third quarter, local enforcement agencies issued
three new "standardized" composting facility permits, with CIWMB concurrence.
The standardized permit tier is for facilities that have more than 10,000
cubic yards of feedstock and/or finished compost on site at any one time.
One of the new facilities has reportedly been in continuous operation since
1985, (prior to the requirement for any solid waste facility permit). </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Unprocessed Yard Trimmings </FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unprocessed yard trimmings (UYT), also referred to as "clean
green" and "yard waste," are collected from urban residences and are commonly
used as feedstock for composting. <I>Recycling Times</I> continued to report
UYT prices at -$5.60/cu yd during the third quarter. This negative value
reflects the fees charged by processors to accept the material. Processor
fees are usually considerably lower than landfill disposal fees, so offer
a cost-beneficial alternative to landfilling for UYT generators.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Wood Waste</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Wood waste was covered in the Compost/Organics section of previous
issues of this report because many composters are also wood processors. However,
the new Construction and Demolition (C&amp;D) section in this issue covers
markets for "urban wood debris." </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As noted in the C&amp;D section, urban wood debris includes
wood debris from C&amp;D activities, wood generated during the manufacture
or processing of wood products, and wood pallets. It <I>excludes</I> tree
trimmings, grass clippings, leaves, and the residuals of raw woody crops;
these materials will continue to be addressed in this Compost/Organics
section.</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>Organic Farmers</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Growth in organic farming, including the conversion by some
large conventional farmers to sustainable growing methods, is creating new
demand for urban compost. Organic farmers tend to be more familiar with compost
and more willing to use urban compost products than their counterparts in
conventional agriculture. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A recent survey by the Organic Farming Research Foundation indicates
that the number of organic farms is increasing: 39 percent of the respondents
from this survey began working on conventional farms and later made the
transition to organic farming. Almost half of the respondents intend to increase
their organic acreage over the next 23 years. Only 4 percent intend to decrease
acreage. </FONT>

<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>Agricultural Outreach</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The CIWMB's efforts to develop new markets in California agriculture
for compost derived from urban green materials and other feedstock will continue.
CIWMB staff will present compost information at farm shows from November
1996 through February 1997. Introducing farm show attendees to the benefits
of using compost and mulch and promoting the CIWMB compost and mulch agricultural
demonstration projects are important parts of this effort. The five agricultural
compost and mulch demonstrations which began three years ago are winding
down CIWMB support ends in March 1997. New CIWMB support of an agricultural
demonstration project using yard trimming mulches on avocado groves will
begin soon.</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>Legislation</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Markets for organic material may be impacted by two bills passed
during the third quarter. Assembly Bill 1647 (Bustamante, Chapter 978) states
that beneficial reuse in the construction and operations of a solid waste
landfill, <I>including use of alternative daily cover</I>, constitutes diversion
through recycling. The CIWMB will adopt rules and regulations that establish
conditions for the use of alternative daily cover. AB 1647 becomes effective
January 1, 1997. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>AB 1890 (Brulte, Chapter 854) may affect the biomass industry,
which has the potential to consume a considerable amount of California's
green material. AB 1890 provides the foundation for restructuring the regulatory
framework for California's electric power industry. The bill requires the
Secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA) to
report to the Legislature on public policy strategies to shift costs from
existing utility ratepayers to alternate sources that benefit from
biomass-generated electricity. The bill is an urgency measure and became
effective on September 24, 1996.</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>Organics Markets on the Web</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The World Wide Web is providing new marketing opportunities
for organic products. CalMAX, the California Materials Exchange, has long
listed soil amendment and raw organic materials among the available and wanted
materials in its publication and bulletin board. Now CalMAX is on the Web.
This provides a way for businesses to make connections for beneficial reuse
of "waste" material. CalMAX is online at:
h<I>ttp://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/mrt/calmax/</I></FONT><I><FONT SIZE=2>calmax.html.</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another organics-related site is <I>Recyclers' World</I>, with
free listings to buy, sell, or trade organic materials. Several categories
are listed for differing types and grades of material. The "organic" and
"food waste" sections have categories for home composting, central composting
(large scale), rendering and protein wastes, and processed and packaged food
wastes. The central composting category includes the following items: bulk
compost, tenders and quotations for central composting, and other central
composting materials. The address is<I>:

  <B>Third Quarter Summary</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<FONT SIZE=2>Markets for postconsumer polyethylene terephthalate (PETE)
containers, flake, and pellet weakened during the third quarter, due to an
overabundant supply of virgin PETE resin. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On a more positive note, markets for postconsumer, natural
(noncolored) high density polyethylene (HDPE) flake and pellet picked up
during the third quarter, driven by price increases for virgin HDPE resin.
(Prices for flake and pellet increased, but container prices remained
unchanged.)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Prices for pellets from postconsumer low density polyethylene
(LDPE) film remained flat during the third quarter, despite the fact that
prices for virgin LDPE resin (film grade) increased during the quarter.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Price changes and market factors for specific plastics during
the third quarter are discussed in the following section. Prices for virgin
resin, postconsumer pellet and postconsumer flake are duplicated from
<I>Plastics News</I> ;&nbsp;prices for postconsumer containers at both the
market (baled) and processor (loose) levels -- are duplicated from <I>Recycling

<FONT SIZE=2>Prices for postconsumer PETE continued to decline during the
third quarter of 1996. Processor prices for loose PETE containers (exclusive
of California Refund Value) between June and September 1996 dropped from
approximately 2-3 cents/lb to 1 cent/lb, while market prices for baled containers
declined from 25 cents/lb to 11 cents/lb. The price for postconsumer PETE
flake fell from 47 to 28 cents/lb, and the price for postconsumer PETE pellet
fell from 50 cents/lb to 32 cents/lb. (See the following table. Also, for
prices between 1992-1996, see "Historical Price Charts" at the end of this

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A major decline in the price for <I>virgin</I> PETE resin, which
fell another 13 cents/lb during the third quarter from 63 to 50 cents/lb
was responsible for the price declines for postconsumer PETE resin. Between
January and September 1996, the price for virgin PETE resin dropped by a
total of 25 cents/lb! </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Widespread availability of virgin PETE resin resulting from
new production capacity accounted for the sharp price decline for the resin.
The increase in production capacity was based on anticipated increases in
demand as more product manufacturers were switching to PETE containers. However,
through the third quarter, demand had not increased to the point where it
was in balance with available supply, and consequently, prices for virgin
PETE were pressured downward. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With virgin PETE prices depressed, postconsumer markets suffered.
Specifically, container and product manufacturers purchased widely available,
inexpensive off-spec virgin resin instead of postconsumer resin. This in
turn resulted in fewer PETE reprocessors buying postconsumer material. According
to Resource Recycling's <I>Container Recycling Report</I> (September 1996),
plastics industry representatives believe the number of firms in the U.S.
buying postconsumer PETE has declined by two-thirds to twelve and that this
number may drop to six by the beginning of 1997. By the end of the third
quarter, the only outlets for postconsumer PETE containers recovered in
California were export markets in the Far East and domestic reprocessors
with pre-existing purchase contracts. <BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>During the third quarter, processor prices for postconsumer
natural HDPE containers (loose) held steady at around two cents/lb, while
market prices for baled containers continued to hover around 10 cents/lb.
Prices for postconsumer HDPE flake increased from 23 to 26 cents/lb and
post-consumer pellet declined slightly from 33 to 27 cents/lb to begin the
3rd quarter, then rebounded to 34 cents/lb by the end of the quarter. (See

<FONT SIZE=2>Increased prices for <I>virgin</I> natural HDPE resin were primarily

natural HDPE resin increased from 41 to 46 cents/lb.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Strong demand by plastic bag and container manufacturers was
the driving force behind the price increases for virgin natural HDPE resin
during the third quarter. In addition, these same manufacturers bolstered
demand for <I>postconsumer</I> resin since some of their products contain

in California after 1995 meet one of five compliance options for their rigid
plastic packaging containers (of any resin type), including containing at
least 25 percent postconsumer resin. The RPPC law also requires that the
CIWMB annually approve an "all container" plastic recycling rate. While the
CIWMB has yet to approve an all container recycling rate for 1995, it has
begun the development of a less costly method to calculate the rates for
1996 and beyond.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another bill affecting the RPPC program is Senate Bill 1155
(Maddy and Costa, Chapter 754), signed into law on September 21, 1996. SB
1155 permanently exempts all food and cosmetic containers from the RPPC Program.
The significance of this change is unknown at this time as these containers
were originally granted a waiver from the Program until January 1, 1997,
and so were never regulated. <BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Prices for postconsumer LDPE resin remained unchanged during
the third quarter, despite price increases for virgin LDPE. Prices for baled
LDPE film remained in the 0-5 cents/lb range, depending on quality (i.e.
food contamination, amount of incompatible resin types, percentage clear
vs. colored, etc.). Prices for colored LDPE flake remained at 10.5
cents/lb<U>,</U> while clear LDPE pellets held steady between 29-30 cents/lb.
Prices for virgin LDPE pellet (clear film) increased from 47 to 52 cents/lb.

<FONT SIZE=2>The main factors driving the markets for postconsumer LDPE resin
were increased demand by domestic trash bag manufacturers, agricultural and
construction film producers, and to a lesser extent, exports to Latin America
and China. According to industry sources, use of postconsumer resin was based
mainly on its price advantage over virgin, but in addition, the
minimum-recycled-content requirement for plastic trash bags sold in California
was also a factor.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Prices for postconsumer polystyrene remained stable during the
third quarter in spite of a fair amount of fluctuation in the price of virgin
PS resin. Virgin PS pellet began the quarter at 49 cents/lb, fell to 43 cents/lb
in August, and then climbed back to 47 cents/lb by the end of September.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The stable prices for postconsumer polystyrene during the third
quarter and throughout the year in spite of fluctuations in virgin resin
prices, indicate that supply and demand for postconsumer PS resin are well
balanced. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Fourth Quarter Preview</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Prices for postconsumer PETE will likely erode further during
the fourth quarter, due to the oversupply of virgin PETE resin. This condition
is likely to persist well into 1997 as manufacturer inventories of virgin
PETE resin will be full and new supplies will be ample for some time to come.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As a result of the ready availability of inexpensive virgin
PETE resin, demand for postconsumer PETE material will likely decline and
some recovered material may be landfilled, since there are few market outlets
for it. One estimate published in an industry trade journal is that one out
of every four pounds of collected PETE material could be disposed. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The third quarter postconsumer PETE market imbalance will likely
be compounded in the fourth quarter, since processor inventories of postconsumer
containers are expected to be high. Inventories swelled during the third
quarter as generation and recovery of such containers increased with the
warm weather, while at the same time there were insufficient market outlets
for the recovered material.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Regarding postconsumer HDPE, prices are not likely to continue
increasing during the fourth quarter, as demand for virgin HDPE by major
end users such as agricultural and plumbing pipe producers is expected to
seasonally decline. The decline in demand for virgin HDPE should bring down
prices and exert downward price pressure on postconsumer HDPE resin. In addition,
export markets have usually built up pre-holiday production inventories of
postconsumer material by the fourth quarter, which should further weaken
postconsumer HDPE demand.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The U.S. market for aluminum used beverage containers (UBC)
remained in the doldrums during the third quarter, although California markets
improved slightly during August and September.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>UBC Market Profile</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In July, August, and September, can sheet producers, reacting
to dwindling supplies of UBCs from recyclers, bid up prices to boost
recovery.<SUP>18 &nbsp;</SUP> The U.S. market price for UBCs increased to
$0.53/lb in August, a 3 cents/lb increase over July's figure. The U.S. price
was, however, 19.5 percent lower than the corresponding price of one year
earlier.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Western Region market prices for UBC, as listed in <I>Recycling
Times</I>, were between 45-55 cents/lb in July, 45-53 cents/lb in August,
and 45-54 cents/lb in September. These prices were virtually unchanged from
the 45-55 cents/lb price for the month of June.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Western Region processor prices, as listed in <I>Recycling
Times</I>, remained between 25-35 cents/lb during the months of July, August,
and September. This range was down slightly compared to a range of 30-42
cents/lb during the month of June. (See the following table. Also, for prices
between 1992-1996, see "Historical Price Charts" at the end of this report.)

<P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The continued weakness in UBC markets, both for California and
nationwide, appeared to be primarily the result of a low LME (London Metals
Exchange) cash price for primary aluminum. During the third quarter, the
price fluctuated between 66 and 68 cents/lb, about 16 percent less than prices
during the same period last year.<SUP>19</SUP> &nbsp;The LME cash price for
primary aluminum in September was at a two-year low. Prices for UBC parallel
LME primary aluminum prices, and LME primary aluminum prices parallel those
for copper, as copper competes with aluminum in some industrial applications.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Weakness in the copper market, attributable to a large sell-off
of copper in the commodities market, contributed to the downturn in the LME
price for aluminum. As of late September, copper prices had fallen about
a third since early May, when Sumitomo Corp., the giant Tokyo corporation,
disclosed the loss of about $1.8 billion in copper futures trading. The copper
trading scandal occurred as a Sumitomo employee attempted to corner the copper
market and incurred copper trading losses over a number of years. After the
announcement, Sumitomo sold many of its copper contracts, causing the
international price of copper to fall. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In spite of weak U.S. UBC markets, California UBC market prices
increased slightly during the third quarter. The California market price
for UBC, as listed in <I>Recycling Manager</I>, was 47 cents/lb in late
September, a <BR>
12 percent increase from the late July price of 42 cents/lb. The September
price improvement reflected increased purchasing of UBCs by can sheet producers
during the last two months of the third quarter.</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>UBC Recovery</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It appears that the 1996 U.S. UBC recycling rate may not reach
60 percent for the first time since 1988. (1995 was not a stellar year for
UBC recovery either, with the recovery rate reaching only 62 percent.) Through
August 1996, consumption of UBCs by aluminum can sheet producers was down
7 percent over 1995 levels, yet beverage can <I>shipments</I> were ahead
of last year's pace. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Recycling experts point out numerous reasons for the reduction
in the national UBC recycling rate, including:<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <FONT SIZE=2>Reduction in the number of small recycling centers.</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT SIZE=2>Increased curbside collection programs (the participation and
    capture rate of curbside programs may not be as effective as recycling centers
    for recovering aluminum cans).</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT SIZE=2>Greater use of aluminum cans instead of paper cups at large
    events (such as sporting events) where recovery levels are very low.</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT SIZE=2>Less media time sponsored by the aluminum industry promoting
    the recyclability of aluminum cans.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Fourth Quarter Preview</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Markets for UBCs in California during the fourth quarter in
will most likely remain flat, although there is an outside chance that there
will be a slight improvement, if worldwide economic conditions improve.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Tony Bird of Anthony Bird Associates (Surrey, United Kingdom)
is optimistic that increased demand will soon create tight markets for aluminum.
According to Mr. Bird, the leading economic indicators in the U.S., Japan
and Germany signal an economic upturn which will accelerate aluminum orders
in 1997.<SUP>22</SUP></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Steward Spector, publisher of <I>The Spector Report </I>(Hewlett,
New York) indicates that worldwide primary aluminum production and prices
should increase during the fourth quarter and into
1997.<SUP>23</SUP></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Because markets and prices for UBCs in California are closely
tied to U.S. and international demand for primary and secondary aluminum
(which in turn is influenced by both domestic and worldwide economies), the
performance of California's UBC markets will hinge on the performance of
those economies.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Markets for California glass containers remained stable during
the third quarter, reflecting the ability of glass container and fiberglass
manufacturers to consume all the containers recovered within the state. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In general, end user and processor prices for cullet and glass
containers remained unchanged during the third quarter. The following tables
show a decline in the lower end of the range of prices paid by end users
for clear and brown glass cullet during the month of July. Most likely, the
lower price reflected that of one end user, rather than several, and could
be considered a sampling variation. Prices are those reported in <I>Recycling
Times</I>, then adjusted using information provided by contactsin the glass
processing industry. (See the following tables. Also, for prices between
1992-1996, see "Historical Price Charts" at the end of this report.) </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>As was the case during the second quarter, a source from a
California glass processor indicated that demand for clear, brown, and clear
beneficiated cullet by California glass container manufacturers exceeded
his company's ability to supply the material. The company continued to import
cullet from out-of-state to meet demand. </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Marketing of three-color mix (3-mix) glass in California continued
to be challenging during the third quarter. Although 3-mix comprises a relatively
large share of the glass recovered in California, market options are still
few. Municipal curbside collection programs recover the majority of 3-mix
in California. </FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There are only two principal markets for 3-mix in California:
Gallo Glass in Modesto, which uses it to produce dark green wine bottles,
and the four fiberglass producers in the state. Because of limited markets
for 3-mix and because a considerable amount of processing is required before
3-mix can be used by either Gallo or by fiberglass producers, the <I>market
price</I> municipalities receive for 3-mix is very low: between $0 and $10
per ton.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Although the market price of 3-mix is very low, the Department
of Conservation (DOC) beverage container redemption program enables
municipalities to receive a price for 3-mix well above the market value.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Municipalities participating in the DOC program receive a processing
fee of approximately $23.66/ton for commingled<SUP>25</SUP> &nbsp;3-mix and
a redemption fee of $36.00/ton for a total receipt of about $59.66/ton. Thus,
after transportation charges, municipalities typically receive between $45
and $50/ton for 3-mix.</FONT><BR>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>Glass Containers Lose Market Share</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Glass containers continue to lose market share to other container
material types. Soft drink and food product manufacturers are increasingly
substituting aluminum and plastic containers for glass. As of the end of
May 1996, year-to-date glass container production was down 2.9 percent from
the previous year.<SUP>26 </SUP></FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Fourth Quarter Preview</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Markets and prices for glass containers and cullet should continue
to remain relatively stable in the western U.S. during the fourth quarter.
Seasonal demand for cullet by color and the cost of transportation will continue
to result in some fluctuations in prices.</FONT>

<P>
<B>Third Quarter Summary</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Markets for recovered steel cans in California remained weak
during the third quarter, due to a continued softening of the ferrous scrap
market. The primary factors which contributed to the weakness in ferrous
scrap markets were:<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <FONT SIZE=2>Weaker overseas demand (due in part to a stronger U.S. dollar
    and a depressed Japanese economy).</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT SIZE=2>A decline in domestic and international steel production.</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT SIZE=2>A decline in the price of copper. </FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Steel Can Market Profile</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The <I>California</I> market price for steel can scrap remained
unchanged during July and August, but decreased $5.00 per ton in September
due to weaker domestic and international ferrous scrap markets. As of October
1996, U.S. steel production was up by 2 percent compared with the same period
in 1995, yet domestic steel mill <I>consumption of ferrous scrap</I> through
the second quarter was less than year-previous levels. U.S. steel mills were
largely substituting pig iron, imported from Russia and Brazil, for ferrous
scrap. The downward trend in scrap consumption most likely continued into
the third quarter, although actual figures were not available at the time
of publication. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The price paid for steel can scrap in California is based on
the composite regional price index for #1 heavy melting steel published in
<I>Iron Age Scrap Price Bulletin.</I><SUP>27</SUP> <I>Iron Age's</I> composite
index is based on surveys of western ferrous scrap processors and
exporters.<SUP>28 </SUP></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Market prices for steel cans in the Western Region, as reported
by <I>Recycling Times</I>, declined in July, but then remained stable throughout
the remainder of the quarter. Processor prices also declined in July, but
then returned to their June level in August and remained unchanged in September.
As with California steel can prices, weaker domestic and international ferrous
scrap markets were the main reason for the lower prices in the Western Region.

Price Charts" at the end of this report.)</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>A decline in the international price of copper also contributed
to lower prices for steel can scrap during the third quarter. Steel cans
are used to extract copper ore from mined earth. Approximately two pounds
of steel cans are required to extract one pound of copper ore.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The price of copper determines the amount copper producers will
pay for steel cans. The international price of copper declined by about a
third between early May and September after it was disclosed that a rogue
copper trader at Sumitomo Corp., the giant Tokyo corporation, attempted to
corner the copper market. After the announcement, Sumitomo sold many of its
copper contracts, causing the price to fall. (See also the information provided
in the previous section of this report on "Aluminum Used Beverage Containers.")

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The fourth quarter picture for steel can scrap markets in the
West is unclear. While some end users reduced their price for steel cans
by $5/ton in October, others held the line on prices. At the time of publication,
the reason for the October steel can price reductions by some end users was
not known, nor was it known whether those reductions would continue during
the fourth quarter. <BR>

<H2>
  I. SUMMARY
</H2>
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
To facilitate meeting the 50% diversion requirement of the Integrated Waste
Management Act (IWMA), the Board sought input from cities and counties, the
public and private waste management and recycling industry, manufacturers,
environmental groups, the public and its own staff on the issues associated
with reaching the goal, potential solutions to obstacles and the Board's
role in achieving 50% diversion.
<P>
A Board staff team (team) was assigned to evaluate suggestions received at
the Board's three 50% initiative workshops and from cities, counties and
Board staff <A HREF="attach.htm">(see Attachments 1-3)</A>. Approximately
1,000 suggestions were received and have been grouped together for analysis
(see <A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A> and <A HREF="rank.htm">Attachment 2</A>
(370K file). Not all suggestions received were related to achieving the 50%
goal. The suggestions related to other Board initiatives were forwarded for
analysis in the appropriate forum.
<P>
The remaining suggestions were placed into nine major categories. Within
each category, suggestions with like themes were combined into concepts and
each concept was evaluated. The team did not modify the types of activities
suggested, or the stringency of suggestions. For example, the team did not
change a suggested activity from "mandated" to "encouraged".
<P>
Each concept was evaluated for: additional costs to the Board and others;
diversion potential; demonstrated sucess and time to optimize the impact
on the waste stream; and sphere of influence. Additional information was
gathered on whether the idea was a new, expanded or modified Board program
and whether it would require legislative changes. The team was not asked
to evaluate existing Board programs and activities.
<P>
Staff recommends that the Board focus on the groups of suggestions which
ranked high for each category. Many of the concepts which have the highest
potential for reducing the waste stream are controversial and/or require
legislative changes. The stringency of a suggestion and concept had a great
impact on ranking. For example, suggestions related to green waste diversion
range from "encourage diversion of green waste" to "mandate a landfill disposal
ban for green waste". The scores related to cost, amount of green waste diverted
and sphere of influence would be significantly different due to the stringency
of the requirement. The mandate would have a greater impact on reducing disposal,
but would be more costly and controversial.
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00001.GIF">
<P>
<B><I><A NAME="fig1">Figure 1</A>. Process for developing staff
recommendations.</I></B>
<P>
The team performed a screening level analysis to assist the Board in determining
which of the suggestions received to pursue further. At the workshops, each
person presented one or more suggestions, but the impacts of each suggestion
were not discussed. This format allowed the Board to hear the maximum number
of suggestions, but did not identify all issues associated with implementing
each of the suggestions.
<P>
It is critical to remember the following when reviewing the analysis and
recommendations:
<P>
1. The Board and Committees will need additional information on the potential
consequences of implementing each suggestion to make informed decisions as
to which suggestions to pursue.
<P>
2. The team assumed any necessary additional data gathering would be limited
to a few months.
<P>
3. Many concepts are modifications or expansions of existing Board programs
and similar topics have been discussed at Committee meetings.
<P>
4. The Board and Committees will also need information on existing programs
to make informed decisions. An evaluation of existing programs was outside
the scope of the team's assignment.
<P>
5. After considering the additional data, the Board and Committees could
make decisions as to whether to pursue any concept further.
<P>
6. If the Board wishes to proceed with legislation in 1997, decisions need
to be made and language developed by early March for consideration by Assembly
and Senate policy committees in April.
<P>
7. There is a limited, three-year window of opportunity between now and the
year 2000 for the Board, cities and counties to develop information and implement
programs to meet 50% diversion.
<P>
8. New activities need to be implemented to the point where they will actually
reduce the waste stream within the three years, to assist cities and counties
to meet the goal.
<P>
9. With the projected decline in Board revenues as diversion increases, the
team believes it is increasingly important for the Board to focus its activities
and consider the cost effectiveness of ongoing activities in making its
decisions.

<P>
These screening level recommendations lay out a set of options which, based
on staff's preliminary analysis, are the most likely of the suggestions received
to assist in meeting the 50% goal. This set of recommendations does not
necessarily reflect future staff recommendations which would be developed
after further analysis. The recommendations do not compare existing Board
programs to suggestions received, as that was beyond the team's scope of
work. <BR>
<P>
Staff's general recommendations are presented first. Next are staff's proposed
priorities for considering the recommended concepts. The priority order is
based on considering the broader concepts before considering more specific
concepts. Staff's 44 recommended concepts in the nine major categories follow
in the analysis section.<BR>
<P>
There will be some cost with pursuing almost all the concepts. With the projected
decline in Board revenues as diversion increases, staff believes it is
increasingly important for the Board to focus its activities and consider
ongoing activity costs in making its decisions. The team also based its analysis
on the assumption that gathering any necessary additional data related to
a concept would be limited to a few months. After considering the additional
data, the Board could make decisions as to whether to pursue the concept
further.<BR>
<P>
If the Board wishes to proceed with legislation in 1997, decisions need to
be made and language developed by early March for consideration by Assembly
and Senate policy committees in April. Unless it is an urgency measure which
requires a two-thirds vote of the Legislature, legislation passed in 1997
will become effective January 1, 1998. Some ideas may merit further discussion
and the Board may wish to hold them over for consideration as legislation
in 1998. In that case, however, those legislative proposals would not become
effective until January 1, 1999.<BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>

<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<U><B><A NAME="general">General Recommendations</A><BR>
</B></U>
<P>
One of the most common themes in many categories is the Board should focus
on programs which have the largest diversion potential and evaluate existing
and proposed programs for effectiveness as well. This approach would focus
on doing a few things well, rather than doing limited work on many things.
This approach is analyzed in the Broader Concepts Category, and is also included
in concepts such as: targeting loans and grants; targeting public outreach;
exempting rural cities and counties from Integrated Waste Management Act
(IWMA) diversion requirements; promoting reuse of construction and demolition
materials; facilitating diversion facility siting at disposal sites; and
promoting and facilitating organic materials recycling. <BR>
<P>
A second common theme was maximizing Board, city and county resources and
effectiveness through partnerships. The partnerships are for activities which
are best done on a statewide basis or take advantage of economies of scale
on a statewide basis. This approach is included in concepts such as: improving
the Board's ability to access outside funds; starting joint initiatives with
other states and business associations; leveraging greater buying power through
state contracts for cities and counties; and promoting efficient use of resources
to businesses through industry associations. <BR>
<P>
A third common theme was establishing additional financial incentives for
diversion. This approach is included in concepts such as: establishing tax
credits for purchase of recycled material as feedstock; promoting unit pricing
for waste disposal; disclosing unsubsidized disposal costs; and allowing
sale of excess diversion credits. These measures could heighten the financial
rewards for expanding recycling enterprises, reducing waste generation and
could make recycling more financially attractive.<BR>
<P>
A fourth common theme was imposing additional requirements on cities and
counties that failed to meet the goals. This approach is included in concepts
such as requiring unit pricing for cities and counties that did not meet
the goals; banning green waste disposal in landfills for cities and counties
that did not meet the goals; and requiring cities and counties to charge
unsubsidized disposal costs.<BR>
<P>
Team members also observed that based on review of all the suggestions, the
Board's existing products and/or statutory requirements are not well known
(see <A HREF="sugg.htm">Attachment 3</A>) and need to be more effectively
publicized. <BR>
<CENTER>

<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<U><B><A NAME="proposed">Proposed Priorities for Considering
Recommendations</A><BR>
</B></U>
<P>
Staff recommends the Board consider two broader concepts before considering
more specific concepts. Using this order for considering concepts, the Board
would first decide whether to focus the Board's efforts on key programs that
will lead to 50% diversion (concept 1) and whether to evaluate existing and
proposed Board programs for effectiveness (concept 2). The outcome of a Board
decision on these two concepts will determine which of the remaining concepts
the Board chooses to pursue and determine the allocation of resources to
programs. If the Board chooses to focus on the most effective programs for
achieving the 50% diversion goal, it may be necessary for the Board to consider
proposing legislative changes to remove requirements for less effective
activities. <BR>
<P>
Once the Board decides whether to implement the concepts 1 and 2, staff
recommends the Board consider whether and how to exempt rural cities and
counties from the diversion requirements of the IWMA (concept 3). Exempting
rural cities and counties would require a change in legislation. Many other
recommendations include developing tools and providing financial and technical
assistance for cities and counties. Staff will concentrate on developing
tools and providing assistance to the other cities and counties if rural
cities and counties no longer require any, or as much,
assistance.<U><B></B></U>

<P>
Californians generate about 45 million tons of waste per year. As California's
population grows the waste produced increases, as do the demands on our waste
management programs and facilities. State law, effective in 1990, requires
waste diversion in order to conserve landfill space and natural resources.
The waste diversion goals are ambitious: 25% diversion by 1995 and 50% diversion
by 2000. Each of California's cities and counties is required to meet the
diversion goals in partnership with private industry, the public and Board.<BR>
<P>
In 1994 California's cities and counties submitted the first evidence of
the progress being made in implementing diversion programs and diverting
waste. The reports indicated significant progress in implementing diversion
programs. Statewide, there was an 86% increase in diversion programs between
1990 and the end of 1994, with a 155% increase in diversion programs expected
between 1990 and 2000. <BR>
<P>
On a statewide basis, cities and counties met the 25% diversion goal for
1995. This was calculated using 1995 statewide disposal tonnage to estimate
diversion. To better understand the tonnage that needs to be diverted, it
is estimated that 60 million tons of waste will be generated in 2000, about
11 million tons are now diverted, so it is estimated an additional 14-19
million tons of materials will need to be diverted to achieve the 50% goal.
The actual measurement of goal achievement will be somewhat different and
will take into account changes in population, economics and other factors.
<BR>
<P>
To assist cities and counties in meeting the diversion goals, the Board has
already developed many tools and provided much assistance. The tools and
assistance include, but are not limited to: Recycling Market Development
Zone loans; the recycling hotline; school curriculum; the landfill capacity
report; waste management facility and material collection cost models; business
waste reduction kits; users' guides for measuring diversion goal achievement;
rural diversion assistance manual; and technical assistance to cities and
counties. <BR>
<P>
To reach the 50% diversion goal many cities and counties are examining the
current conditions, identifying existing and potential diversion programs
which could be used to reach the goal and determining the effectiveness and
cost of diversion programs for various materials. Implementation of diversion
programs will affect cities and counties, the public and industry involved
in waste management and waste diversion.<BR>
<P>
In addition to the 50% Initiative, the Board has embarked on several initiatives
which, taken together, focus on the most effective ways of achieving the
diversion goals and overseeing public health and safety aspects of facilities
needed for diversion and facilities needed for disposal of materials that
cannot be diverted. These initiatives include Board program integration,
market development plan activities, tire program review, organic materials
initiative, Board and Local Enforcement Agency (LEA) Partnership 2000 plans,
Permitting and Enforcement Division's "Other 50%" Initiative and related
activities. All of these initiatives will contribute to the upcoming revision
of the Board's strategic plan.

<P>
<U><B><A NAME="board">The Board Initiative to Develop Strategies to Meet
the 50% Diversion Goal</A><BR>
</B></U>
<P>
To facilitate meeting 50% diversion, the Board sought input from cities and
counties, the public and private waste management and recycling industry,
manufacturers, environmental groups, and the public on the issues associated
with reaching the goal, potential solutions to obstacles and the Board's
role in achieving 50% diversion. <BR>
<P>
The Board held three workshops to obtain suggestions from all the parties
involved in meeting the diversion goals. The three workshops were: October
19, 1995 in Sacramento; November 13, 1995 in Rancho Cucamonga; and April
18, 1996 in Sacramento.
<P>
Representatives of rural cities and counties and the Board's Local Government
Technical Advisory Committee presented ideas at the April 18, 1996 workshop.
The Board also solicited written comments. Summaries of comments received
at the three workshops and in letters were prepared. Transcripts of the workshops
are also available in the Board's library.

<P>
<B><A NAME="development">1) Development of Strategies</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
A team from throughout the Board was selected by Executive staff to coordinate
the analysis of suggestions received and develop recommendations on which
of the suggestions received were most likely to assist in reaching 50% diversion.
Executive staff assigned additional Board staff with expertise to help the
team evaluate the suggestions. The team performed a screening level analysis
to assist the Board in determining what suggestions to pursue further. <BR>
<P>
Approximately 1,000 suggestions were received and have been grouped together
for analysis. Not all suggestions received were related to achieving the
50% goal. The suggestions related to other Board initiatives were forwarded
for analysis in the appropriate forum.<BR>
<P>
<A NAME="suggestions">The remaining suggestions</A> were placed into nine
major categories: <A HREF="concepts.htm">broader concepts</A>;
<A HREF="fund.htm">funding and financial incentives</A>;
<A HREF="cost.htm">cost effectiveness and program comparison</A>;
<A HREF="opa.htm">public affairs and education</A>;
<A HREF="disposal.htm">disposal reduction goals and goal measurement</A>;
<A HREF="local.htm">local diversion assistance</A>; <A HREF="market.htm">market
development</A>; <A HREF="waste.htm">waste prevention</A>; and
<A HREF="facility.htm">facility operations/permitting and enforcement</A>.
Within each category, suggestions with like themes were combined into concepts
and each concept was evaluated. The team did not modify the types of activities
suggested, or the stringency of suggestions. For example, the team did not
change a suggested activity from "mandated" to "encouraged".
<P ALIGN=Center>
<BR>
<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<A NAME="evaluation"><B>2) Evaluation Criteria</B> </A><BR>
<P>
The team developed evaluation criteria to provide an objective and consistent
approach for evaluating each of the concepts. Because the concepts consist
of a wide range of ideas, the criteria were purposely kept broad. They primarily
focus on the significant aspects of getting to 50 percent by 2000. The four
key areas evaluated were: <BR>
<P>
1. Potential Costs to the Board - For new programs, this was an assessment
of the total costs associated with implementation of the concept for equipment,
personnel, operation, and/or funds for grants or loans. For expansions of
existing programs, the assessment was for additional costs, over and above
the costs of the existing program, for equipment, personnel, operation, and/or
funds for grants or loans.<BR>
<P>
2. Potential Costs to Others - These costs were assessed in more general
terms than costs to the Board, as information on costs in cities, counties
and businesses was not readily available. <BR>
<P>
3. Potential Impact on Waste stream - There were two parts of this assessment.
First, the specific waste types affected by the concept were identified as
a percent of the waste stream and, second, within those waste types, the
percentage that would likely be diverted by the proposed concept. <BR>
<P>
4. Likelihood for Successful Implementation within 3 years - There are two
parts of this assessment. First, an assessment of whether the technology,
practice, or process proposed by the concept has been successfully used
elsewhere. Second, the time needed for the concept's effect on the waste
stream to be optimized. The time to optimize the effect included any needed
legislative and regulatory changes, product development and distribution,
training and implementation of the activity.<BR>
<P>
5. Potential Sphere of Influence - There were three parts of this assessment.
First, the percentage of population that would be affected by the concept.
Second, the number of cities and counties that would be affected by the concept.
Third, the number of sectors that would be affected by the concept. <BR>
<P>
Additional information was gathered on whether each concept was new or
modification of an existing Board program, and if legislative or regulatory
changes were needed.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="method">3) Method of Analysis</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
The concepts were evaluated by estimating the extent to which suggestions
within the concept satisfy the evaluation criteria. Each of the two cost
criteria, two potential impact on the waste stream criteria and two likelihood
for successful implementation criteria were weighted equally. The three potential
sphere of influence criteria were only given the weight of one of the other
criteria.<BR>
<P>
A broad spectrum of staff was used to evaluate the concepts. Estimating the
cost or ultimate diversion impact of a specific recommendation in most cases
was difficult and required intimate knowledge of a specific subject or program
area. Therefore, each category was evaluated by a unique panel of Board staff
with expertise in the areas addressed by the category. Each panel was headed
by a team member. All told, 31 staff participated in the evaluation
process.<BR>
<P>
The panels met independently on several occasions. Each panel discussed the
suggestions, refined the concepts and shared information needed for the
evaluation. Each panel evaluated concepts within its category and recommended
one or more of them. Each panel recommended between 3 and 13 concepts as
passing the screening criteria for further consideration by the Board. <BR>
<P>
The team does not recommend that evaluation results be compared across
categories. The team used the evaluation to screen the concepts and identify
the most effective and feasible suggestions that emerged within each category.
The analysis of the recommended concepts below indicates the difficulties
in applying the basic criteria.
<P ALIGN=Center>

<P>
<B>4) Analysis of Categories<BR>
</B>
<P>
<U><B><A NAME="broader">Broader Concepts</A><BR>
</B></U>
<P>
Staff recommends the Board consider two broader concepts before considering
more specific concepts. Using this order for considering concepts, the Board
would first decide whether to focus the Board's efforts on key programs that
will lead to 50% diversion (concept 1) and whether to evaluate existing and
proposed Board programs for effectiveness (concept 2). The outcome of a Board
decision on these two concepts will determine which of the remaining concepts
the Board chooses to pursue and determine the allocation of resources to
programs. If the Board chooses to focus on the most effective programs for
achieving the 50% diversion goal, it may be necessary for the Board to consider
proposing legislative changes to remove requirements for less effective
activities. <BR>
<P>
Once the Board decides whether to implement concepts 1 and 2, staff recommends
the Board consider whether and how to exempt rural cities and counties from
the diversion requirements of the IWMA (concept 3). Exempting rural cities
and counties would require a change in legislation. Many other recommendations
include developing tools and providing financial and technical assistance
for cities and counties. Staff will concentrate on developing tools and providing
assistance to the other cities and counties if rural cities and counties
no longer require any, or as much, assistance.

<P>
<B>On June 29, 1994, the Board authorized the Local Assistance and Planning
Committee to utilize a consent agenda for the approval of planning elements
due to the large number of documents that the Committee will have to consider.
The following items have been reviewed by Board staff and have been recommended
to the Committee for consent. The Committee will be asked to approve these
items at one time without discussion. At the beginning of the meeting, the
Chair of the Committee will ask Committee members or other interested parties
or staff who wish to address an item on the Consent Agenda to state their
names and the items they wish to address for the record. The Chair or an
individual Committee Member may request that an item be removed from the
Consent Calendar for full hearing. [Items removed from the Consent Calendar
will be heard in the originally scheduled order.]</B>

<P>
<I><B>On June 29, 1994, the Board authorized the Local Assistance and Planning
Committee to utilize a consent agenda for the approval of planning elements
due to the large number of documents that the Committee will have to consider.
The following items have been reviewed by Board staff and have been recommended
to the Committee for consent. The Committee will be asked to approve these
items at one time without discussion. At the beginning of the meeting, the
Chair of the Committee will ask Committee members or other interested parties
or staff who wish to address an item on the Consent Agenda to state their
names and the items they wish to address for the record. The Chair or an
individual Committee Member may request that an item be removed from the
Consent Calendar for full hearing. [Items removed from the Consent Calendar
will be heard in the originally scheduled order.]<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+3><B>What is Waste Prevention World?</B></FONT>
<P>This site is about <I>doing more with less.</I>  It's about efficiency and rethinking your daily activities.  Any way you change your life to produce less and reduce the materials you (or your business) create is waste prevention.  The idea has many names: waste prevention, source reduction, and sometimes waste reduction.
<P>If you want to get into the technical nitty-gritty of waste prevention definitions, read on.
For other general recycling terms, check out our <A HREF="wpdefin1.htm">waste prevention definitions</A> page, or get back to browsing our <A HREF="wpmain.htm">main page.</A>

<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>I. So, what is source reduction?</B></FONT><BR>

<H4><STRONG>The definition in California Integrated Waste Management
statute is:</STRONG></H4>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><I>&quot;Source Reduction&quot; means any action which causes
a net reduction in the generation of solid waste. &quot;Source
Reduction&quot; includes, but is not limited to, reducing the
use of nonrecyclable materials, replacing disposable materials
and products with reusable materials and products, reducing packaging,
reducing the amount of yard wastes generated, establishing garbage
rate structures with incentives to reduce the amount of wastes
that generators produce, and increasing the efficiency of the
use of paper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastic, and other materials.
&quot;Source Reduction&quot; does not include steps taken after
the material becomes solid waste or actions which would impact
air or water resources in lieu of land, including, but not limited
to, transformation.</I>
<P>
An alternative definition to the one in the statute was adopted
by the CIWMB in May 1993 (as recommended in the Statewide Waste
Prevention Plan). This definition highlights the role of individuals
as well as organizations, clearly states that source reduction
occurs before anything enters the waste stream; and addresses
the question of the overall environmental impacts.
<P>

<I>&quot;Any action undertaken by an individual or organization
to eliminate or reduce the amount or toxicity of materials before
they enter the municipal solid waste stream. This action is intended
to conserve resources, promote efficiency, and reduce pollution.&quot;
</I></FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>According to the <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov" >U.S. EPA</A></FONT>:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Source reduction is the design, manufacture, purchase,
or use of materials or products (including packages) to reduce
their amount or toxicity before they enter the municipal solid
waste stream. Because it is intended to reduce pollution and conserve
resources, source reduction should not increase the net amount
or toxicity of wastes generated throughout the life of a product.&quot
<P>

The above definition emphasizes the process of how waste is
generated. Analyzing this process helps us find source reduction
opportunities. The last sentence of the definition handles life-cycle
questions that often arise when substituting products or packaging.
As you can see, waste prevention, or source reduction, has everyday
opportunities such as <A HREF="wporgnc/wpgras1.htm" >mowing your lawn  
</A>or buying pet food, or even in designing consumer products.
</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>II. What does waste prevention mean?</B></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3><I>Waste prevention</I> is used synonymously with <I>source
reduction</I>, a term often used in waste management circles. The combined
experience of other states and "public interest groups" indicates that it is easier
to understand the term waste prevention. Therefore, the CIWMB
adopt the term <I>waste prevention</I> in May 1993.</FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>III. How does waste reduction compare to waste prevention?
</B></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3>Typically, <B>waste reduction</B> includes waste prevention
and recycling. A number of local jurisdictions in CA, public interest groups and
a few states use <B>waste reduction</B> synonymously with <B>waste
prevention. </B>Check how the term is being used when reviewing
documents or in conversation to avoid confusion.

Producing waste negatively impacts your bottom line. You
pay for it when you purchase excess supplies and materials--those
that aren't used efficiently and become waste--then you pay
to collect and haul the waste away. Preventing waste not only saves
resources and reduces pollution, it also saves money. It's just good

The Board offers low interest loans (see below), financial assistance,
product-marketing, and permitting assistance to businesses located
within a zone. Local governments offer additional incentives,
including relaxed building codes and zoning laws, streamlined
local permit process, reduced taxes and licensing, and increased
and consistent secondary material feedstock supply.

<B>RMDZ Loans</B></H4>  The Loan program provides direct loans to (1) businesses
who use recycled content feedstock in their manufacturing process
and are located within a designated Recycling Market Development
Zone, or (2) local governments in the zone to finance public works
infrastructure which directly supports businesses who use postconsumer
or secondary waste material. Funds may be used for real property,
equipment, working capital, or refinancing of current debt. Interest
rate to be charged on loans is currently a fixed rate of 6%.

 Thank you.

<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR>
<b>Step #1:  Complete pre-assessment tasks (get organized!) </b><P>
<UL>
 		<LI>Develop or obtain forms to use during your assessment. 
		<LI>Collect background information on the organization/type of business.

  		<LI>Develop a series of questions to guide your initial phone
conversation with the business to make sure you collect critical information.

	  	<LI>Determine appropriate time of week/month/year to conduct assessment
- pick a time when waste is being generated (not off season) and when containers
are full.
	  	<LI>Explain the waste assessment process to your contact at the business
BEFORE you arrive
	  	<LI>Clarify confidentiality issues with the business. 
</UL>


<BR>
<b>Step #2:  Collect information at the business site</b><BR>Listed below are
<B>SKILLS</B> and related <B>TOOLS</B> to use when collecting information during
the waste assessment.<BR>
		
		

<uL align="left">


<LI><B>SKILL: Questioning</B><P>

TOOLS:<BR>
	-  Develop a list of probing and open-ended questions:
<BR>

	<DD>o  What are they currently doing to reduce waste?<BR>
	<DD>o  What materials do they purchase, process, ship and dispose of?<BR> 
	<DD>o  Who provides waste removal and recycling services?<BR><BR> 

<LI><B>SKILL: Listening</B><P>

TOOLS:<BR>
	 	-  Restate what they said.<BR>
	 	-  Ask for clarification/details about their responses/comments.
<BR><BR>


<LI><B>SKILL: Observing</B><P>
	
TOOLS:<BR>
-  Pay attention--you are a detective who is looking for clues to the mystery of
waste!<BR>
-  Look at the waste & recycling containers, compactor,
shipping/receiving area, internal trash containers, manufacturing/processing
floor, reproduction room - anywhere there is activity that may generate
materials.<BR>
-  Ask lots of questions about what you see. <BR><BR>


<LI><B>SKILL: Writing</B> (take notes)<BR><BR>

TOOLS:<BR>
 -  What did you see, hear, observe? <BR>
 -  What are they doing/not doing to reduce waste? <BR>
 -  Who else could you talk to that would have useful information? <BR>
 -  Can you call them within the next few days?<BR>
 -  Use forms to capture this information.<BR><BR>


<LI><B>SKILL: Pictures/slides</B><BR><BR>

TOOLS:<BR>
 -  Ask permission to bring a camera. <BR>
 -  Use photos of dumpster, recycling bins, receiving area, etc. as part of your
report or presentation to the business.<BR> <BR>

<LI><b>TIPS:</b><BR><BR>

 -  Remember you are a visitor and need to see things from the business's 
point of view as well as your point of view.<BR>
 -  Provide them with useful information at the time of the assessment; include
a packet or some information.<BR>
 -  Be positive about their current efforts, even if they are minimal;
build on what they are doing rather than suggesting that their current efforts
are misdirected or futile.<BR></UL><BR>


<b>Step #3:  Organize the information you collected</b><P>


<UL>
	 	<LI>Develop a report of the information you collected (see samples). 
	 	<LI>Call the business to "fill in the blanks" or clarify information you
collected.  Do this within a week of your visit. 
</UL><BR>

<b>Step #4:  Evaluate the information you collected</b><BR>

<UL>
	  	<LI>Identify major components of the waste stream. 
	  	<LI>Identify opportunities for waste reduction, reuse, recycling and buy
recycled. 
</UL><BR>

<b>Step #5:  Develop written recommendations for the business</b><P>
	
<ul>
		<LI>Based on your evaluation, develop specific recommendations for the
business. 
	 	<LI>Include recommendations on prevention, reuse, composting, recycling
and buy recycled. 
	  	<LI>Make recommendations realistic and specific enough for the business
to take action. 
	 	<LI>Include short, medium, and long range waste reduction options. 
	  	<LI>Add these recommendations to your waste assessment report; present
it to the business. 

</uL><BR>


<b>Step #6:  Follow-up with the business (phone call) </b><P>


<UL>
	 	<LI>Allow time for the business to take action, maybe 3 months. 
	 	<LI>Conduct follow-up phone calls to determine progress, get their
feedback and offer additional assistance if feasible. 
</UL>

<H2>Business Waste Prevention: Quick Tips!</H2>
<EM>Producing waste negatively impacts your bottom line. You
pay for it when you purchase excess supplies and materials--those
that aren't used efficiently and become waste--then you pay
to collect and haul the waste away. Preventing waste not only saves
resources and reduces pollution, it also saves money. It's just good
business sense!</EM><HR>
Waste prevention saves resources and money. Begin by examining
the wastes you generate and where they come from. Then look for
ways to improve efficiency and eliminate waste. The ideas below
can help you get started.
<P>
<STRONG>Purchasing</STRONG>

<UL>
<LI>Establish purchasing guidelines to encourage waste prevention
(durable, concentrated, reusable, high quality).
<LI>Consider length of warranty and availability of repair services
when purchasing equipment.
<LI>Substitute less toxic materials for toxic materials (e.g.,
vegetable-based inks, water-based glue, markers and paints).
<LI>Order merchandise with minimal packaging or layers of packaging.
<LI>Request that deliveries be shipped in returnable containers.
<LI>Order supplies by voice mail or electronic mail.
<LI>Use optical scanners, which give more details about inventory,
allowing more precise ordering.
</UL>

<STRONG>Packaging</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>Eliminate unneeded packaging or layers of packaging.
<LI>Use lightweight packaging.
<LI>Use reusable boxes and mailbags for shipping to branch offices,
stores, and warehouses.
<LI>Reuse packing materials(e.g., foam peanuts, bubblewrap and
cardboard boxes) or find someone who can).
<LI>Set up a system for returning cardboard boxes and foam peanuts
to distributors for reuse.
<LI>Return, reuse and repair wooden pallets and spools.
</UL>

<STRONG>Writing/Printing Paper</STRONG>

<UL>
<LI>Make double-sided copies whenever possible.
<LI>Reuse envelopes and use two-way envelopes.
<LI>Route or circulate memos, periodicals and reports, rather
than distributing individual copies.
<LI>Use voice or electronic mail or post memos on a central bulletin
board.
<LI>Make scratch pads from used paper.
<LI>Use outdated letterhead for in-house memos.
<LI>Eliminate unnecessary forms. Double-side forms or redesign
them to fit on a half sheet.
<LI>Use narrow-ruled notebooks.
<LI>Save documents on floppy disks instead of printing hard copies.
<LI>Use central files for hard copies.
<LI>Print more words on each page (e.g., smaller font, narrow
margins).
<LI>Proof documents on screen before printing.
<LI>Print drafts on paper already printed on one side.
<LI>Use same draft of report for corrections by several people.
<LI>Accept final in-house documents with hand corrections.
<LI>Seek methods to reduce production errors.
<LI>Donate old magazines or journals to hospitals, clinics, or
libraries.
<LI>Keep mailing lists current/one copy per address.
<LI>Call or mail postcards directly to senders asking that your
name be removed from mailing lists.<BR>
Reduce advertising mail by writing to: Direct Marketing Association,
Mail Preference Service, DMA,P.O. Box 9008, Farmingdale, NY 11735-9008.
Ask to be removed from mailing lists.
</UL>
<BR>     <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../wpimage/ret_top.gif"> Go to top of page</A><BR>
<STRONG>Overstocked/Surplus Items</STRONG>

<UL>
<LI>Set up an area for employees to exchange used items.
<LI>Advertise surplus and reusable waste items through a commercial
waste exchange. CALMAX is a materials exchange network in California;
services are available at no cost to users. Call (916) 255-2369
for a free catalog and materials listing form.
</UL>

<STRONG>Equipment</STRONG>

<UL>
<LI>Rent instead of buying equipment that is used only occasionally.
<LI>Use remanufactured office equipment.
<LI>Invest in equipment that facilitates waste prevention, such
as:<BR>
high quality, durable, repairable equipment; copiers and printers
that make two-sided copies; modem cards; folder/sealers
<LI>Institute maintenance practices that prolong the life of copiers,
computers, and other equipment.
<LI>Reclaim reusable parts from old equipment.
<LI>Use refilled or rebuilt fax and printer cartridges.
<LI>Sell or give old furniture and equipment to employees or donate
it to a local charity.
<LI>Find uses for worn tires (e.g., landscaping, swings).
<LI>Use retreaded tires on company vehicles. Rotate tires on a
regular basis to prolong tire life. Keep tires properly inflated.
<LI>Install reusable heating, ventilation and air conditioning
filters.
<LI>Replace incandescent with fluorescent lights.
</UL>
<BR>     <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../wpimage/ret_top.gif"> Go to top of page</A><BR>
<STRONG>Landscaping/Organics</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>Use a mulching mower or retrofit your mower to leave grass
clippings on the lawn (grasscycling).
<LI>Compost grass clippings and leaves or ask your landscaper
to send trimmings to a composting facility (check with recycling
coordinator about any composting requirements).
<LI>Use compost as a topsoil amendment or request that your landscaper
use it.
<LI>Choose a landscape design that needs low maintenance and generates
little waste (e.g., perennials, slow growing shrubs).
<LI>Buy a chipper and turn tree and shrub clippings into mulch.
</UL>

<STRONG>Food and Personal Services</STRONG>

<UL>
<LI>Use durable towels, tablecloths, napkins, dishes, flatware,
cups and glasses.
<LI>Encourage employees to bring their own mugs and utensils.
Ask food vendor to offer discounts on beverages served in a customer's
own mug.
<LI>Buy company mugs; stop providing disposable cups.
<LI>Encourage customers to take home extra food.
<LI>Offer smaller portions (e.g., child's menu).
<LI>Provide condiments in bulk dispensers.
<LI>Arrange for food bank pick-up of unserved food. Call Food
Chain 800 845-3008.
<LI>Sell or give food scraps to farmers who can process them for
feed (check with local health and agricultural agencies).
<LI>Compost vegetable food scraps. (Check with your recycling
coordinator concerning local guidelines or restrictions.)
<LI>Purchase a worm bin for your office to convert food wastes
(banana peels, coffee grounds) into high quality potting soil
(vermicompost).
<LI>Buy reusable coffee filters or unbleached disposable filters.
<LI>Reuse trash can liners or eliminate where possible.
<LI>Consider using cloth roll towels, hot air dryers, large paper
rolls in restrooms, or buy lighter/smaller-sized paper towels.
</UL>

<STRONG>Consumer Choices</STRONG>

<UL>
<LI>Teach your customers about the importance of waste prevention.
Effective tools for getting the message across include: promotional
campaigns; brochures and newsletters (remember to use recycled
paper); banners; newspaper ads; product displays and store signs.
<LI>Encourage customers to bring their own bag(s) and compliment
them when they do.
<LI>Offer customers a rebate when they reuse grocery bags, containers,
mugs and cups.
<LI>Offer customers waste prevention choices such as:
</UL>

<MENU>
<LI>items in bulk or concentrate;
<LI>items in refillable bottles;
<LI>solar-powered items, such as calculators, flashlights; and
<BR>
durable and repairable merchandise.
</MENU>

<UL>
<LI>Encourage customers to return reusable items (e.g., metal
hangers to dry cleaners).

<P>
Since its inception in 1991, the CALMAX program has helped California businesses divert over 300,000 tons of material from diposal toward reuse and recycling opportunities.  This has saved those same businesses over $4 million in disposal and procurement costs.  How do we know?  Because CALMAX users have told us!
<P>
Vital to the continuing success of CALMAX are the "Successful Exchange Reports".  We like to think of these as our fund raisers, for without them we have no evidence of the value of the program, and without evidence, well, we just don't like to think about that.  If CALMAX has been a useful service to you or your business, please let us know.  You can call CALMAX at (916) 255-2369 or e-mail us at <A HREF=mailto:calmax@mrt.ciwmb.ca.gov>calmax@mrt.ciwmb.ca.gov</A>. 
<P>
When contacting us, please be prepared to provide the following types of information:
<STRONG><UL>
<LI>Type and amount of material exchanged
<LI>When and where exchange occurred
<LI>Did you provide or receive the material
<LI>Disposal or procurement savings
<LI>Contact information so we can follow up if necessary
</UL></STRONG>
<P>
Not only does this information help us to justify the program, it also helps us tailor our efforts to better serve you.  While all information can be kept confidential, with your permission we might even select your exchange as one of our <A HREF="calmax.htm#Bi-Monthly Features"> <STRONG>Match of the Catalog or Creative Reuse</STRONG></A> stories.  
<P>
Let us <STRONG><EM>thank you</EM></STRONG> in advance for helping CALMAX help you!

<P>
<B>The goal of CALMAX</B> is to conserve energy, resources, and landfill space 
by helping businesses and organizations find alternatives to the disposal of 
valuable materials or wastes. Furthermore, CALMAX aims to help California reach 
the goals posed by AB939.  This law, passed in 1989, mandates that cities and 
counties must reduce the amount of waste going to landfills.  AB939 states 
there must be a 25% reduction by 1995 and a 50% reduction by the year 2000.

<P>
<B>CALMAX benefits</B> California's businesses and communities in many ways:
<OL>
<LI><B>New Markets</B> for excess materials are encouraged and facilitated.  
<LI><B>Disposal Costs</B> are reduced and there is even the possibility of 
selling material you once threw away.
<LI><B>Economic Development</B> is promoted by helping start-up businesses find free 
or inexpensive materials.
<LI><B>Environmental Enhancement</B> occurs as we conserve resources and landfill 
space by finding uses for materials rather than discarding them.
<LI><B>Your Community</B> benefits as schools, art groups, and nonprofit organizations 
discover the wealth of free or inexpensive materials available to them.
</OL>

<CENTER><H1>CALMAX Netiquette</H1>
<H2>Guidelines for Using CALMAX</H2>
</CENTER><HR>

<UL>
<DL>

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">THE CARDINAL RULE</FONT></B>
<P><DD>CALMAX is for trading items that would <EM><STRONG>otherwise be discarded</STRONG>.</EM>
<P><DD>The <EM>primary</EM> purpose of CALMAX is reuse, based on the hierarchy in 
the waste management field: <STRONG>Reduce</STRONG>, <STRONG>Reuse</STRONG>, <STRONG>Recycle</STRONG>.
<P><DD>The <EM>secondary</EM> purpose for CALMAX is recycling. CALMAX listings may 
also be used to obtain feedstock for the manufacturing of products containing recycled materials.

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Limits on Advertising Recycled-Content Products</FONT></B>
<P><DD>CALMAX users may solicit feedstock--postconsumer items--in the WANTED listings, 
if they make a recycled product; however, they may not list recycled products in the 
AVAILABLE listings.

<P><DD>A business which manufactures recycled products is presumably charging a competitive 
price for his or her products.  To allow such companies to place listings in CALMAX 
for these items is tantamount to giving them free advertising for their products, 
which they sell at "full price."

<P><DD>As a State agency, CIWMB must administer its programs impartially.  To allow this 
type of advertising gives some companies an unfair advantage in the marketplace.  
Granted, many people believe recycled products deserve a competitive edge until they 
become the rule, rather than the exception.  However, there are other programs and 
directories focused on providing free advertising for the manufacturers of recycled 
products.  Thanks for using these programs to meet your needs and for keeping CALMAX 
operating according to its stated purpose.

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Limits on Recyclers and Materials Brokers</FONT></B>
<P><DD>Similarly, it is not appropriate for CALMAX to provide free advertising to brokers 
or recyclers who make their living in the resource recovery business.  The focus of 
CALMAX listings should be resources generated by the company placing the listing.  
The CIWMB encourages brokers to use CALMAX to obtain materials by responding to listings and 
by placing materials WANTED listings; however, to maintain the focus of CALMAX within 
the resources available,  professional recyclers and brokers may not place AVAILABLE 
listings in CALMAX.  (If you obtain items that are not scrap materials, such as a 
closeout on containers, hangers, fixtures, or some other reuseful item, especially 
if they are free, or free to schools,  individual exceptions may be made to this rule.  
Please call CALMAX to discuss your listing.)

<P><DD>As with recycled products manufacturers, there are other media, free to the public, 
for advertising recycling centers according to the type of materials taken, most 
notably, the Board's Hotline: (800) 553-2962.

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Special Services</FONT></B>
<P><DD>CALMAX will continue to list specialized reuse and recycling 
services (see other Resources) if they are: free public services;  nonprofit organizations; companies that donate a significant portion of their materials for reuse by nonprofits (or act as a conduit for such donations); or 
if they offer unique information services to assist Californians in the reuse 
and recycling of specialized materials; or if they cater to specialized industries.


<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Catalog Courtesy</FONT></B>
<P><DD>
Please respond to all inquiries, even if only to say that you are not interested. 
CALMAX will only work if listers are responsive.   If complaints are received that you 
are not returning phone calls and the problem is not resolved in a timely manner, your 
listing (s).  If the number in your listing is on 
an answer phone or voice mail system, please be sure your full name, and/or business name,  as 
stated in your listing, is mentioned on your outgoing message.  Otherwise, 
respondents have no way of knowing if they have reached the right party.

<P>
CALMAX staff do not enter into negotiations between parties using the catalog; 
however, the California Integrated Waste Management Board has a responsibility 
to protect the integrity of the CALMAX program.  Therefore, if CALMAX receive complaints 
that you are not paying for commodities received, or if you are otherwise breaching 
agreements made with other users of CALMAX , your listing(s) will be removed.

<P>
<STRONG>Please take the time to report any SUCCESSFUL EXCHANGES by sending an e-mail to CALMAX
at <A HREF=mailto:calmax@mrt.ciwmb.ca.gov>calmax@mrt.ciwmb.ca.gov</A> and/or calling CALMAX at (916) 255-2369.  
You may also request removal of your listing if a match is made.  This feedback is absolutely 
critical to justify the continuation of this program.
</STRONG>
<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Complaints and Compliments:</FONT></B> 
<P><DD>We take 
constructive feedback very seriously, both 
compliments and complaints.  Every one of your good ideas is implemented, as long 
as it is possible to do and it benefits CALMAX overall. Your calls and letters are 
our only way of knowing that does and doesnot work in the real world of CALMAX.  
Please do not hesitate to tell the CALMAX coordinators what you think and how we can help! .  
Tell us how we can serve you better!

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Study the Listings and Other Features</FONT></B>
<P><DD>This isn't necessary every time, but as a get-acquainted 
exercise, it's a must.  See how the materials exchange is organized and who is 
participating.  Get a feel for the materials categories, the areas where most 
things are available, and how what's advertised now may meet your needs.  Also, look at the different articles and other resources.

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Look for a Match</FONT></B>
<P><DD>Check the "Materials Available" section.  Are there items 
advertised that you would like?  If so, call the contacts listed and start 
shopping.  If you have items you're ready to part with, check "Materials Wanted."  
If there's a match, make calls to any potential new owners.

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Write an Advertisement</FONT></B>
<P><DD>If you don't see what you want or need to recycle in CALMAX, place a listing.  Whether you want material or 
want to get rid of it, there's only one way to know if someone will be interested 
in what you have (or has what you want): List it and see what happens. 

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Call the Coordinators</FONT></B>
<P><DD>If you aren't a big risk taker, even in the reuse and 
recycling want-ads, call CALMAX at (916) 255-2369.  Maybe what you have to offer is 
exactly what the last caller was asking for!  CALMAX staff can offer assistance in match facilitations.

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Be an Avid Catalog Reader</FONT></B>
<P><DD>Always take at least a quick look, to be up on what's 
happening or changing in materials trends. 
			
<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Talk it Up to Others</FONT></B>
<P><DD>Materials exchange programs link often totally unrelated 
businesses for mutual benefit.  Tell your friends, because 
the more the word goes out the grapevine, the more participants, materials, and 
great opportunities for trades.

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Brag About Being a "Green" Business</FONT></B>
<P><DD> In your business literature, when you state what your company is doing for the 
environment, list your participation in the CALMAX right up there with office 
recycling and buying recycled products.

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Be Creative</FONT></B>
<P><DD>If you've done all these things, a whole new world of potential 
reuse and recycling has been opened up to you.   People 
have developed entire new product lines out of discarded material from another 
business.  What hidden treasure will YOU find?

<DL>

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Purpose</FONT></B>
<P><DD>To provide a free source of used materials to California's schools, 
during these times of limited resources.

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">What is KidMAX?</FONT></B>
<P><DD>KidMAX is the catchphrase for promoting CALMAX in 
California's schools.

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Background</FONT></B>
<P><DD>CALMAX is advertised as "the Waste-Not Want Ads for 
California Business, Industry, and Institutions."  Schools have 
always been eligible to utilize CALMAX as a source of supplies, 
materials, furniture, etc.  However, previous promotional 
efforts focused on reaching our primary target audience -- business 
and industry.  If teachers or school personnel heard about CALMAX, it 
was primarily by "word of mouth."

<P><DD>Many CALMAX participants expressed an interest in identifying 
"worthy cause" organizations such as schools in order to donate 
 materials to these entities.  Consequently,  CALMAX staff developed  a mechanism to identify 
these listings for those CALMAX readers who preferred to target 
their materials to schools.   All KidMAX listings are now identified by  bold headings and  checkmarks  
in front of the listings.

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Just One Rule</FONT></B>
<P><DD><B>Considering the current economic challenges in our 
school system, we ask that all items offered to the schools through 
CALMAX be given for free.</B>

<P><DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF3333">Beyond the Wanted  Listings</FONT></B>
<P><DD>If you have items you think might be 
more appropriate for schools than for other businesses (art supplies, 
outdated equipment, etc.), call CALMAX.   A block has been added to the CALMAX Listing 
Form, where you can indicate your interest in donating some or all of 
your available items to schools.   In addition,  there are often tax benefits to these 
donations (consult your tax preparer).

 CAL-MEX is a CIWMB initiative that is part of a larger program involving several groups, including the
USEPA and the Cities of San Diego and Tijuana, called the<A HREF="http://borderwastewise.org"> Border Waste-Wise Program</A>.  This program is designed to address waste
issues within the border region between the two cities.
<P>
The CAL-MEX part of CALMAX has been created to encourage
exchanges of potentially useful discards within the San
Diego/Tijuana border area.  Because many of the American
businesses in Mexico must take certain wastes back to the United
States to dispose of them, CAL-MEX can provide an opportunity for
these businesses to trade materials in Mexico or back in
California, rather than paying to have them disposed.  On the
other hand, organizations in Mexico may be interested in
materials being offered by businesses here in California or in
Mexico.  This project will also dovetail with a new binational
Recycled Market Development Zone being developed by the two
border cities.  
<P>
 CALMAX plans to support CAL-MEX by offering selected
listings and information in Spanish to encourage businesses and
other organizations across the border to participate. 
<EM> (Currently <A HREF="cmlist.doc"> selected CAL-MEX listings</A> are provided in Spanish in a format compatable with Microsoft Word 6.0. )</EM>  Visitors can also search Region 13 through the <A HREF="../catalog.htm"> On-Line Classifieds</A>.


We encourage all businesses to take advantage of the opportunities
being made available through this new component of CALMAX.

<P>
We usually think of hospitals serving their communities by curing 
illness and helping injured people recover.  Recently, I've heard 
of a couple of hospitals that have decided to go a little further 
in helping their communities and, at the same time, help themselves.  

<P>
The first hospital is the Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz which 
has a program called "Domin-Again".  Domin-Again is a reuse 
program which was started in 1994 by the hospital ecology task 
force, to help reduce waste in the hospital and to provide needed 
resources to schools and other groups in the community.  Plastic 
water bottles, boxes, buckets and lids, trays, packing chips, and 
other items were all being thrown away before some energetic and 
thoughtful hospital employees took the initiative to start this 
program.  The program is housed in a hospital-owned garage and is 
operated voluntarily by staff and other interested persons.

<P><UL>As Carol George, Domin-Again's coordinator says, <EM>"this program gives 
another life to materials which were just thrown away."</EM></UL>

<P>
Another example of a medical facility helping others and 
themselves is the Kaiser Permanente Laboratories of North 
Hollywood.  This facility donates their used computers, 
microscopes, and medical equipment both to public schools and 
less developed countries.  Cardboard, paper, and glass is also 
recycled and given to other companies for reuse.  Additionally, 
by simply reusing plastic containers and sterilized test tubes, 
the facility saves over $62,000 annually.

<P>
Most communities in California have at least one hospital or 
medical facility.  These may not only be a source of useful 
medicine for the community, but also useful materials.  There are 
many other hospitals, in addition to the two highlighted above, 
that have started programs to further utilize surplus or 
discarded materials.  These facilities have shown how creativity, 
waste reduction and business sense can combine to bring good 
health and good will to their communities.

<H2>May/June Match of the Catalog</H2>
<EM>by Ken Decio</EM></CENTER>
<HR>
<UL>

<P>
When the Colusa County Superintendent of Schools needed to get 
rid of over 40,000 law books from a defunct law school, no one 
knew where to turn.  So, almost 50 tons of books were kept in 
storage units, costing the district $3000 per year. Various 
schools, law firms, and businesses throughout the County were 
contacted, but no one was interested in them.  

<P>
Just when it appeared that the only remaining option was the 
dump, Phil Martell, the City Administrator for the City of 
Williams, became aware of the issue.  He was determined to keep 
these books from ending up at the bottom of a landfill.  Alan 
White, an employee of the California Integrated Waste Management 
Board, suggested that Phil investigate CALMAX as a possible 
solution to finding a home for the books.

<P>
Phil promptly placed a free ad in CALMAX and was amazed at the 
number of calls he received from businesses interested in the 
books.  He was able to donate 4.5 tons of books to one company, 
but the volume of books was simply too large for this firm to 
handle alone.  Then he received a call from Craig Hollyfield of 
All Sierra Recycling in Auburn, CA, and things progressed 
rapidly.

<P>
Craig, who was referred to CALMAX by his Weyerhaeuser Recycling 
sales representative, spotted Phil's "Legal Books-Free" ad in the 
catalog.  Craig had just recently opened All Sierra Recycling and 
was initially a bit overwhelmed with the volume of law books.  It 
required eight trips to Williams to recover 45 tons of books.  

<P>
Most of the books were scrapped to recover white ledger paper, 
which easily covered the labor and transportation costs 
associated with collecting the books.  However, to increase his 
profit margin, Craig negotiated a consignment agreement with 
Frank Biebl, Development Director for the Sacramento Surplus Book 
Room.  Frank and his volunteer staff sorted through the 45 tons 
of books and recovered nearly 7,000 that were deemed marketable. 
 The leather-bound books are being marketed to interior design 
firms and law offices for decorator purposes.  Some of the books 
are being sold for as much as $4.00 each, compared to recovering 
only 75 cent worth of white ledger paper contained in each book.

<P>
This is yet another example of how CALMAX can help communities 
and/or businesses network together to find viable alternatives to 
disposing of valuable resources.  The Colusa County School 
District saved thousands of dollars on storage and disposal 
costs; All Sierra Recycling generated a profit from recovering 
the books; the Sacramento Surplus Book Room was able to market 
many of the books for decorator purposes; and almost 50 tons of 
material was diverted from the Colusa County's landfill!
<P>
<UL>As Phil Martell exclaimed, <EM>"The CALMAX magazine was a godsend to us".</EM></UL>

<H2>July/August Match of the Catalog</H2>

It has been very difficult in the past for state agencies to keep old or obsolete computers,
electronic equipment, furniture, etc. from ending up in California's landfills.  This type of
equipment could not be donated or recycled because it was considered to be a "gift of public
funds" to charities and businesses.  In 1991, the Department of General Services (DGS)
amended the State Administrative Manual to allow state agencies to donate obsolete
equipment to non-state and nonprofit entities instead of having to dispose of them in landfills. 
In 1994, DGS also authorized the use of CALMAX and appropriate recyclers and salvage
dealers as alternatives for finding new homes for State-owned property.
<P>
Rick A. Hicks, Property Controller/Recycling Coordinator of the California Department of
Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) in Sacramento, heard about CALMAX from a friend over five
years ago which inspired him to start an in-house materials exchange, called "CDPR MAX".  
Rick compiles a list of surplus property at CDPR and e-mails the inventory throughout the
Department to see if anyone could use the material.   The CDPR MAX listings have resulted
in several successful exchanges so far.  If the property cannot be exchanged through CDPR
MAX, then Rick sends most of the unwanted equipment to DGS's Property Utilization Unit
where new homes are found for the supplies.  Rick also utilizes CALMAX to get rid of
unsalvageable material, which leads to this issue's Match of the Catalog.
<P>
Recently, Rick was experiencing difficulties getting rid of damaged and obsolete computer
and electronic equipment ranging from answering machines, calculators and typewriters to
facsimile machines, copier machines and computers.  He looked through CALMAX and
spotted Troy Peebler's listing which stated "Looking for all types of computer and electronic
equipment in working or not conditions".  Rick contacted Troy at AAAA Computer Recycling
in Sacramento, and Troy recycled all of the equipment and will accept more computer
equipment from Rick in the future.      
<P>
This match illustrates the value of CALMAX to government agencies as well as
entrepreneurs.  Through  CALMAX, the California Department of Pesticide Regulation  saved
on disposal costs while AAAA Computer Recycling was able to scrap the materials for a
profit while diverting hundreds of pounds of materials from the landfill.  Congratulations to
Rick Hicks and Troy Peebler for showing that everyone can profit from CALMAX!  
<P>
For more information regarding the State of California's property disposal methods and public
sales days, please contact Hollis Thompson of DGS's Surplus Property Unit at (916) 928-
4633.

I'd like to devote this issue's update to two new and exciting
developments in the CALMAX program.  The first is something we've
been thinking about for some time called CAL-MEX -- as in
California and Mexico.  CAL-MEX is a CIWMB initiative that is
part of a larger program involving several groups, including the
USEPA and the Cities of San Diego and Tijuana, called the Border
Waste-Wise Program.  This program is designed to address waste
issues within the border region between the two cities.
<P>
The CAL-MEX part of CALMAX has been created to encourage
exchanges of potentially useful discards within the San
Diego/Tijuana border area.  Because many of the American
businesses in Mexico must take certain wastes back to the United
States to dispose of them, CAL-MEX can provide an opportunity for
these businesses to trade materials in Mexico or back in
California, rather than paying to have them disposed.  On the
other hand, organizations in Mexico may be interested in
materials being offered by businesses here in California or in
Mexico.  This project will also dovetail with a new project
considering the establishment of a Recycling Market Development
Zone in Tijuana, similiar to the CIWMB's existing program.  This
proposal is being developed by the two border cities.
<P>
CALMAX plans to support CAL-MEX by offering selected listings and
information in Spanish to encourage businesses and other
organizations across the border to participate.  We encourage all
businesses to take advantage of the opportunities being made
available through this new component of CALMAX.  Look for the
symbol that designates CAL-MEX in the listings.  Finally, CAL-MEX
information will also be offered via the Internet, which brings
up the next subject I'll be talking about.
<P>
As many of you may know, the Internet has become major
communication tool and a innovative approach to doing business. 
A couple of issues ago, we advertized the CIWMB's home page
(http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/).  We are now pleased to announce the
establishment of CALMAX's presence on the internet!  Through the
CALMAX web site you'll be able to access all the information in
the catalog and more.  This development is a significant step
toward our goal of reducing the amount of paper used to produce
and mail the paper catalog.  
<P>
You can find the CALMAX web site by accessing the CIWMB's home
page, and looking under Business Waste Prevention or by going
directly to it at:

  http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/mrt/calmax/calmax.htm  

Not only is the CALMAX information free on the Internet, but a
wide variety of other waste reduction information is also
available at your fingertips while visiting. 
<P>
If you have any ideas or suggestions to further enhance these
improvements to the CALMAX program, please feel free to give
CALMAX a call (916-255-2369) or e-mail <A HREF=mailto:calmax@mrt.ciwmb.ca.gov>(calmax@mrt.ciwmb.ca.gov)</A>.

<P>  
Is there anything you can do with rusty bicycle parts besides
contracting a case of tetanus or tossing them in the garbage?  A
company in Oregon believes there are plenty of uses for these
seemingly useless parts.  Resource Revival uses old bicycle parts
to create a range of products, from art to attire.  Items such as
valve and bearing key rings, spiked dog collars, log holders,
stools, valve-core earrings, belts, candlesticks, tables, tube
ties, and rubber suspenders are fashioned out of re-"cycled"
bike components.  Over 100 bicycle shops throughout the Western
United States participate in the program, and the company reuses
over 1000 pounds of bicycle parts monthly.  They also donate 5 percent
of their pretax profits to educational charities, as well as
donate functional bike parts to various entities. 
<P>
Resource Revival obtains reusable parts by offering bicycle shops
$.50 per pound for unwanted bearings, inner tubes, metal break
levers, chains, rear derailleurs, rims, wheels, etc. 
Participating bicycle shops ship the materials to Salem, Oregon,
where the Garten Foundation, a nonprofit organization employing
developmentally disabled adults, disassembles the parts and sends
the components to Resource Revival in Portland, Oregon.  There, a
group of artists create a variety of functional items from these
disassembled bicycle parts.
<P>   
Bicycle shops can benefit from the program by reducing their
disposal costs and by increasing revenues through
environmentally friendly business practices.  By accepting
bicycle parts in their stores, many shopowners report an increase
in foot traffic which usually results in higher sales.  In
addition, some shops can actually earn a profit on the $.50 per
pound price by accumulating large quantities of parts to reduce
shipping costs. 
<P>
This is yet another example of the myriad of benefits associated
with reuse: jobs are created, disposal costs are reduced,
materials are diverted from local landfills, and practical--and
unique--products are created by reusing "unwanted materials". 
For more information on products offered by Resource Revival,
call (800) 866-8823 or e-mail at <A HREF=mailto:tubeties@aol.com>tubeties@aol.com</A>

Think you can find a new house through CALMAX?   Well...almost.  Lou Hernandez, formally of Los Angeles, found most of the materials needed for the new house he's building in Ensenada, Mexico from the CALMAX catalog.  In fact, the first story of his house is now complete, using mostly materials collected from numerous CALMAX exchanges.
<P>
With the help of CALMAX, Lou started a business called Broken Barrier Brokers.  He uses CALMAX to find materials to bring and sell in Mexico.  Lou's exchanges fit in well with CALMAX's new promotion, CALMEX, which encourages transactions of discards within the border area.  Through his transactions, he has saved over $7,600 and diverted over 21,000 pounds of materials from the landfill.
<P>
Lou first heard of CALMAX several years ago while attending ECOEXPO, an environmental conference in Los Angeles.  He was looking for solar equipment for his house in Mexico, but came across the CALMAX booth and the rest is history.  Lou saw an opportunity and seized it.  He began to use CALMAX to find materials to bring into Mexico, keeping some for his house and making a profit selling the remaining materials.
<P>
This story is a perfect example of the entrepreneurial spirit of many CALMAX users.  As Lou Hernandez says, "just about everything you need, including wood and plumbing can be found through CALMAX, if you're patient enough."  Whether you're patient or not, let CALMAX work for you to build or help your business and, most importantly, improve your bottom line.  And of course, we'd like to congratulate Lou and his family on their new dream home, built with the help of CALMAX.

<B>CALMEX..</B>.The first Spanish only CALMEX listings were mailed to over 200 businesses in the border region in August.  This program is designed to encourage reuse and recycling opportunities in the San Diego/Tijuana border area.  Look for the symbol (>) to denote CALMEX listings in the CALMAX catalog.  
<P>
<B>STAFF CHANGES...</B>We are pleased to announce that Beth Regula is the new CALMAX student assistant. Beth is an Environmental Studies major at Sacramento State University and has worked in the Administrative Assistant's Office at the CIWMB since May,1995.  Welcome Beth!
<P>
<B>AND THE WINNER IS...</B>Phase Three Environmental Management was awarded the 1996/97 CALMAX contract at the Board meeting on August 28, 1996 in Sacramento.  Three proposals were submitted to the CIWMB for the 1996/97 CALMAX contract. Phase Three was the lowest qualified bidder and will perform numerous activities, such as producing, printing, and mailing the CALMAX catalog to subscribers.  Congratulations to Phase Three Environmental Management!
<P>
<B>MINIMAX ROUNDTABLE...</B>The CIWMB and the Local Government Commission hosted a MiniMAX Roundtable in Sacramento on September 12, 1996.  The purpose of the event was to develop a strategy for how CALMAX can encourage and support local materials exchanges (MiniMAXes)in California.  Attendees included representatives from existing MiniMAXes, city and county agencies interested in starting their own MiniMAXes, and other supporters of MiniMAXes.  The group worked on a draft MiniMAX manual, which will be available in the next few months as a resource for developing and promoting MiniMAXes in the future.  CALMAX staff would like to thank all the participants for making this such a productive and enjoyable event!
<P>
<B>CALMAX ON THE WEB...</B>There are many benefits to using CALMAX on the Web.  Listings are updated weekly, instead of every other month, and users can submit new listings electronically.  Not only are the listings more current on the internet compared to the paper catalog, they can be posted and accessed 24 hours a day. In addition to the classified ads, the CALMAX home page offers a wide variety of money-saving, waste reduction information.  CALMAX user tips are also featured, which can provide assistance to first-time users of CALMAX.  Available are articles on creative reuse ideas,  KidMax, the CALMAX Match of the Catalog, lists of other reuse programs and assistance, and electronic links to other materials exchanges throughout the USA. If you have access to the internet, please e-mail us and we'll take your name off the mailing list.  This will save paper and help reduce printing and distribution costs for the CIWMB.    So...check out CALMAX on the Web!!

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Creative Reuse:  "Its In the Bag"</B></FONT><BR>
<EM>by Beth Regula-Thompson</EM></center><BR>
<HR>

In Humboldt county, Canela Valentine, owner of Faze II Recycling,
has been very creative by finding a way to generate an income by
re-using someone else's discards.  Grain is a commodity that is
sold nationwide, and it commonly is packaged in durable cloth
bags.  Rural communities see a lot of them, especially on farms
and during the winter months.  Faze II Recycling came up with a
great idea to re-use these grain sacks by converting them into
multi-purpose bags.  The business already owned the tools needed
for this production enterprise, but was still in need of a supply
of feedstock.  Faze II Recyling decided to work on solving this
predicament by running an ad in CALMAX, looking for empty grain
sacks.  Mad River Brewery of Blue Lake, CA, answered the ad, and
became a major supplier for this new enterprise.
<P>
With the untorn grain sacks, Faze II Recycling makes tough re-
usable bags in 3 sizes.  The small bag is great for lunches; the
intermediate bag can be used for shopping--or carrying books; and
the biggest bag is an excellent size for laundry--or sports
equipment. 
<P>
The nifty thing about these bags is both their durability and
decor.  Designs are made on the outside of the bag, often of
wheat, grass, or corn.  The bags may be made with handles.   The
handles are sturdy and bear a design that matches the bag:  these
designs are colorful and even have matching zig-zag stitches. 
The bags even come with a flat bottom, so they can stand up.
<P>
Additionally, Faze II Recyling has come up with some wonderful
ideas on ways to promote more of this particular type of re-use. 
For instance:  the grain sack producers could include
instructions on, or a pamphlet with, the bags explaining proper
opening techniques; locate a bin for customers to return sacks at
the grain stores for others to pick up and reuse; or locate a bin
at the local recycling center for the bags.  Faze II Recycling is
even considering starting a program directly with the company
that makes the bags to recycle their textile trimmings.
<P>
What a wonderful way to help the environment, save room in the
landfills, and generate an income too.  Congratulations Canela!

  <B>"CALMAX Finds Companies Willing To Take the Wrap"</B><BR>
<P><B> Dateline:  Riverside
</B> - When a California newspaper publisher was looking for ways to
reduce the amount of materials they were throwing in the trash,
they turned to another publication for answers: CALMAX.
<P>
The Press-Enterprise, a daily newspaper with a circulation close
to 170,000 in Riverside, asked Vic Capato, their Environmental
and Safety specialist, to examine the newspaper's waste
management practices.  Vic's duties, as the appointed Chairman of
the newspaper's Recycling Opportunities Committee, brought him to
the Government Conference on the Environment in Sacramento. 
There he visited the CALMAX booth and leafed through the catalog,
discovering that he might be able find homes for many of the
materials that the newspaper was paying to throw away.
<P>
Weekly, the Press-Enterprise receives approximately 200 pallets
of advertisement inserts for various editions of the newspaper.
The pallets are covered with plastic shrink wrap, resulting in
two full dumpsters of shrink wrap being hauled to the landfill
each week.  Vic scanned the CALMAX catalog and contacted several
companies that handled various types of plastics.  He found that
most companies were not willing to pick up small quantities of
plastic and, unfortunately, the shrink wrap could not be
stockpiled by the Press-Enterprise since there was limited
storage space available in the building. 
<P>
Vic developed an innovative solution.  He contacted HD Plastics,
a company in nearby Ontario, that had placed a listing in CALMAX
soliciting "CLEAR PALLET WRAP & LDPE FILM SCRAP".  Vic negotiated
an agreement with HD Plastics where the shrink wrap would be
transported to the reprocessing facility in Press-Enterprise
trucks that were already delivering and picking up papers in the
area.  HD Plastics pays the Press-Enterprise 10 cents a pound for
the shrink wrap, and has diverted over 6,000 pounds of material
from the newspaper's dumpsters.  
<P>
Vic then turned his attention to another disposal problem: 
plastic core plugs.  The newspaper was annually generating 3,000
pounds of polypropylene core plugs that are found in the reels
that newsprint is rolled on.  Vic again found an ad in CALMAX for
polypropylene and worked out a similar arrangement with Western
Gold ThermoPlastics in Los Angeles.  Press-Enterprise trucks now
transport the core plugs to the reprocessing facility in Los
Angeles and receive 10 cents per pound for the material.
<P>
Vic Capato discovered the value of coupling CALMAX with a little
creativity, and has improved his company's bottom line.  To date,
the Press-Enterprise has saved substantially on disposal costs
while earning nearly $1000 from materials formerly thrown away. 
HD Plastics and Western Gold Thermoplastics received low-cost
feedstock for their plastic reprocessing operations, and over
9,000 pounds of materials were kept out of California's
landfills.

A LITTLE LATE...We apologize for the tardy September/October
issue of the catalog and any inconvenience it may have caused. 
With a change in contractors, it took a few extra days to get
everything together.  Remember, however, whether it's rain,
sleet, snow, hail, or just bureaucracy that delays delivery, you
can ALWAYS get up-to-date CALMAX information from our web site:
<P>
              http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/mrt/calmax/calmax.htm
<P>
JUST A REMINDER...Our new contractor is Phase Three Environmental
Management.  This means that new listings for the catalog, on-
line, and internet should be sent either to the CALMAX program
(fax #916/255-4580) or to Phase Three at:
<P>

fax:      (916)933-5937<BR>
<P>
BULLETIN BOARD SERVICE...Due to the evolving nature of CALMAX,
there has been an interruption in CALMAX's BBS service.  We are
looking into the feasibility of continuing the BBS, and would
appreciate your feedback.  Meanwhile, the CALMAX Internet/Web
site is unaffected by this change.
<P>
CATALOG CHANGES...In order to continue operating the CALMAX
program with an ever-decreasing budget, we are looking at ways to
increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the program. 
We are supported by public funds and believe they should not be
wasted. One of the ways we can reduce costs is by making changes
in the catalog.  The changes may be gradual at first, but we will
probably make significant changes within a few months.  For
example, last month we decreased the font size, created three
columns instead of two, and reduced the number of pages to 56,
all while increasing the number of listings.  This month we
changed the cover by removing one of the colors. The information
contained in the catalog will be the same, but it may look
different, and will cost us less to produce.  We would appreciate
your feedback, so if you have questions or suggestions, please
call us at (916)255-2369.
<P>
MINIMAX ROUNDTABLE...In our last update, we talked about the
September 12 meeting with many of the people who are involved
with reuse programs throughout the State.  Many issues were
discussed, such as: relationships between material exchange
programs (like CALMAX) and material exchange facilities that
actually store materials on-site; electronic linkages; and the
use of associations to carry the message of reuse.  If you would
like to know more about this meeting or would like a copy of the
written summary, please call.
<P>
CAL-MEX...Just a reminder that listings for Region 13 (Southern
Coast/Baja California) are available in Spanish.  If you wish to
receive them, please call.
<P>
CALMAX ON THE WEB...We've said it before, and we'll certainly say
it again: Our web site can be accessed 24 hours a day, it's
updated weekly (the catalog is bimonthly), and  there are no
printing or mailing costs associated with it.  You can reach us
at http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/mrt/calmax/calmax.htm.

Congratulations to Triad Energy Resources Inc. and to C&H Sugar
Company for being selected as the 1995 CALMAX Match of the Year. 
Their story of exchanging a sugar filtration byproduct and
converting it into a soil amendment originally appeared in the
July/August 1995 issue of CALMAX. <P> 

The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB)
presented Mike Daley of Triad and Sandra Stevens of C&H Sugar
with resolutions commending their outstanding reuse and recycling
effort at a public CIWMB meeting in Modesto on April 24, 1996.<P>

Triad ERI is an agricultural service company that tests and
analyzes soils, crops and water for farmers, then advises
landowners what nutrients are needed and where to find them. 
Triad typically does not rely on traditional chemical
fertilizers.  Instead, the company recommends surplus food and
food byproducts like egg shells, mushroom waste and even ash from
biomass plants.<P>
  
A major sugar producer in California, C&H Sugar Company had been
unable to find a use for its sugar filtration byproducts produced
during the refining process.  The company has landfilled the
material for several years at its property in Crockett.  However,
increasing landfill storage costs and regulatory requirements
encouraged the company to find alternative uses for its residues.<P>

The "Match of the Year" award recognized Triad for converting
20,000 tons of stockpiled sugar byproducts from C&H Sugar's
filtration process into an agricultural soil amendment and
fertilizer.  C&H Sugar has a total of 200,000 tons of this
residue--several years' worth--at its Crockett site, and Triad
expects to use up the supply over the next two to three years. In
addition, the land where the material was previously landfilled
will eventually be turned into a 1300 acre park operated by the
East Bay Regional Park District.<P>       

Triad president Mike Daley credits the CALMAX catalog for
increasing his business "by at least 25 percent or more in the
last 18 months."  As a result of reading the CALMAX publication,
his company has also used 30,000 tons of spent mushroom compost,
2,000 tons of horse manure, as well as various quantities of
coffee grounds, spent filter media, and surplus pallets.<P>

Thank you Mike Daley and Sandra Stevens for showing that unwanted
byproducts can be turned into valuable resources that restore our
soils, reduce the need for landfilling, and improve California's
business bottom line.

Printing Tips
</H3>
<IMG SRC="../wpimage/purpleba.gif" ALIGN=texttop
WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALT="o">PDF file printing can be troubling if your "Page Setup" preferences are not correct. Here are some tips:
<P>
<B>A)</B>
Make sure to test your print-output before printing the entire file. To do this, print one or two pages of the file. Choose a text page <I>and</I> a page with graphics. Print these and take a look to make sure they are suitable before sending the entire document to the printer.
<P>
<B>B)</B>
PDF printing can be RAM (random access memory)
intensive. The "spooling" of a large PDF file (as with any file type) can take
a while. The nice thing about PDF files is that they are true pages, and can be
sent in sections, based upon need, to the printer. If your system or printer
does not have a lot of RAM, print the file in 10-page sections (this suggestion
is for files larger than 300k). This will reduce the amount of print time for
large PDF files because the amount of information you are sending from your
computer to the printer is minimized.
<P>
<B>
C)
</B>
Suggested Printer Settings:
<P>
Laser printer settings:
<BR>For black and white output (as the majority of
Laser printers print black ink only) in your Page Setup dialog box, <B>set the "Graphic Mode" to "Raster" or "Black and White"</B>

<P>DeskJets, InkJets, DeskWriters, etc. (both color
and black and white):
<BR>
Grayscale and black and white PDF files will print
fine if the Page Setup dialog box is set to "black and white". This is because
the grayscales of the document are embedded.
<B>DO NOT print black and white or grayscale PDF files in the "Grayscale" mode.
</B>This can often corrupt the graphical output. Color PDF files should print fine on all color printers.
<P>Again if your not sure of the output, test your settings on one or two pages of a large PDF file before printing the entire document.
<B>Reduce Waste!</B>

<CENTER><STRONG><H3>APPLICATIONS NOW OPEN FOR CALIFORNIA
        BUSINESSES TO "WRAP UP" RECYCLING AWARDS</H3></STRONG></CENTER><P>

     SACRAMENTO - - California businesses and nonprofit organizations putting forth their
best efforts to reduce waste and recycle on the job are encouraged to apply for the 1996
Waste Reduction Awards Program (WRAP), sponsored by the <STRONG>California Integrated Waste
Management Board.</STRONG><P>

     "It gives us great pleasure to honor the many innovative measures companies and
nonprofits are taking statewide to reduce, reuse, recycle and buy recycled," Waste Board
Chairman Daniel G. Pennington said today, announcing the opening of the 1996 WRAP
application period. "Waste reduction activities aren't just good for the environment, they're
critical to California reaching its mandate to cut the state's waste by 50 percent as of the year
2000, and provide a substantial bottom-line benefit, saving businesses and organizations
hundreds, even thousands, of dollars. Everybody wins when we eliminate waste at the
source."<P>

     California businesses and nonprofit organizations that have taken effective steps to
reduce the amount of nonhazardous waste they send to landfills are eligible to apply for the
1996 Waste Reduction Awards Program. However, companies in the business of recycling or
reducing waste that is generated by others are only eligible to apply for recognition based
upon their efforts to reduce their own waste. Government agencies and schools are not
eligible for the awards program.<P>

     Deadline to apply is July 31, 1996. To receive an application, please call the Local
Government Commission at (916) 448-1198, or download the application from the Waste
Board's Web site at http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov (see Business and Industry section).<P>

     Now in its fourth year, the WRAP awards evaluate how well applicants reduce, reuse
and recycle their waste. Also considered are: efforts to buy recycled-content products;
reduction of packaging waste; and educating employees about reducing waste. All winners
receive an award from the Integrated Waste Management Board and camera-ready logo art
suitable for use in advertising and on products or educational materials to demonstrate State
recognition of the company's efforts.<P>

     Past winners have included Sea World, Beaulieu Vineyards, Apple Computer,
Frederick's of Hollywood and 92 Target Stores, among many others.

<STRONG><P>1.  What are the WRAP awards?</p></STRONG>

<P>The Waste Reduction Awards Program (WRAP) is an annual program, established
in 1993 by the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB), that
recognizes California businesses that have made outstanding efforts to reduce
nonhazardous waste and send less garbage to our landfills.   Successful applicants
will receive an award certificate from the State of California along with a camera-
ready WRAP WINNER logo.  The logo is perfect for use on products, advertising,
and on educational materials to show that the State applauds efforts to reduce
waste.  
<STRONG>
<P>2.  Were the businesses randomly chosen for the award, or were there specific
criteria?</STRONG>

<P>Any California business that has taken effective measures to reduce the amount of
waste it generates may apply.  Applicants do not compete by type or size of
business, but are judged based on their individual merit.  Businesses are asked to
provide information about the steps they are taking to reduce waste in their daily
business operations, such as incentives for company or employee recycling
programs, the reduction of packaging for their products, and the reuse and
recycling of materials in the manufacturing of their products.  Businesses are also
required to give a breakdown of the amount of recycled and postconsumer
materials being used in their manufacturing process (materials that were recyclable
and those that were made from recycled materials).

<STRONG><P>3.  How many businesses have received an award?</STRONG>

<P>To date, 1093 California businesses have been chosen to receive a WRAP award,
and all of them share the common achievement of waste reduction.  Almost all of
them, for example, have one or more employees devoted to overseeing their waste
reduction program, and many of the winners have asked their suppliers to reduce
the wasteful packaging on products.  Other companies have even found uses for
their discards or unwanted materials.

<STRONG><P>4.  Can businesses actually help solve California's garbage problem?</STRONG>

<P>California has set a goal to reuce its waste by 50 percent by the year 2000.  There
are approximately one million businesses in California and they generate nearly half
of all of California's waste.  If all California businesses took the kind of lead the
WRAP award winners have, there would be a tremendous drop in the amount of
waste going to landfills.  Because of California's shortage of long-term landfill
space, many local governments are predicting a 20- to 100-percent increase in
disposal costs over the next few years.  By reducing waste, businesses are
avoiding millions of dollars in disposal costs.

<STRONG><P>5.  What are most businesses throwing away?</STRONG>

<P>Primarily paper, mostly through businesses' daily administrative functions and
dealings with customers.  But there are other things as well, depending on the size
and type of business.  It's not unusual for manufacturers and warehousers to have
plastics comprise 25 percent of their waste stream.  While it is less for retail 8
percent  and offices 6 percent   that is still a tremendous amount of plastic that
ends up in our landfills. As another example, in 1991, an estimated 30 million toner
cartridges were sold for laser printers and personal computer copiers.  Nearly 86%
of them were used once and thrown away, creating enough plastic waste to
stretch halfway around the world. Today, businesses commonly recycle toner
cartridges, saving money and reducing waste at the same time.

<STRONG><P>6.  What can businesses do to solve the problem of excess waste?  Is it
complicated?</STRONG>

<P>There are plenty of things companies can do and, no, it is not that complicated.   
Businesses, large or small, can undertake some very simple measures to reduce
and divert the amount of waste they send to the landfill each year, such as
reducing office paper waste, purchasing recycled materials, having landscape
wastes composted, recycling glass, cardboard, aluminum and plastic.  Even
batteries, tires and motor oil can be recycled.

<STRONG><P>7.  Are businesses actually saving money by reducing waste?</STRONG>

<P>Yes, many of the WRAP award winners report dramatic savings in their waste
disposal costs as a result of waste reduction or waste diversion.  For example,
Warner Bros. Studios has saved well over $100,000 in garbage hauling fees since
instituting a program to donate excess materials and divert others for recycling.
And a Torrance-based  private label vitamin manufacturer was able to reduce its
landfill costs by $30,000 in one year by diverting more than 915,000 pounds of
garbage. The Fetzer Vineyards in Mendocino County initiated waste reduction
efforts in 1990 and has since reduced the company s waste by 86 percent, saving
more than $80,000 in disposal fees.

<STRONG><P>8.  How can businesses get started?  What's the first thing they can do?</STRONG>

<P>Conducting a waste assessment of their operation is a good first step for
businesses.  A waste assessment involves taking a close look at the waste
management system and deciding what could be changed or eliminated in an effort
to reduce the waste produced by the business.  A very basic assessment, for
example, could involve asking these questions:
<UL>
<LI>What kind of material is produced as waste and how much is going to be thrown away?  Is there a way of reducing or eliminating the waste?
<LI>Can some of the materials be reused or recycled instead of throwing them
     away?  Is there another business or individual who has a need for them?
<LI>Is there an employee-incentive or employee-involvement program in place to
     educate employees about waste reduction practices and encourage the
     employees to apply waste reduction measures to their everyday work routines?
</UL>
     

<P>Answering even these basic questions can help any business owner or manager
determine a workable solution for establishing an efficient waste management
system.
<STRONG>
<P>9.  What about reusable and recyclable materials?  How can businesses locate
individuals or businesses that need these kind of materials?
</STRONG>
<P>The California Materials Exchange (CALMAX), a free materials exchange program
sponsored by the California Integrated Waste Management Board, publishes a
bimonthly catalog that lists materials "available" and "wanted" for reuse and
recycling among businesses.  Businesses can list their materials in the catalog and
also use it to keep track of where they can obtain and exchange materials
necessary for their production or manufacturing process, or even routine daily
operation procedures.

<STRONG><P>10.  How can businesses find out more about waste reduction, the WRAP
competition and CALMAX?
</STRONG>

<CENTER><H3>305 CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES WIN AWARDS FOR REDUCING WASTE</H3></CENTER>

<P>
<DD><B>SACRAMENTO</B>-- Businesses throughout the state are finding it makes good sense economically and ecologically to cut back on the amount of waste they produce, and 305 of them have been named as winners in the 1995 Waste Reduction Awards Program (WRAP). From Northrup and the Fetzer Vineyards to Sea World and an impressive 90 Target Stores, the companies represented in this year's WRAP competition, now in it's third year and sponsored by the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB), have demonstrated outstanding efforts to reduce, reuse, recycle and buy recycled.
<P>
	"California businesses are discovering bottom-line profits when they introduce waste-reduction programs into their everyday operations," said CIWMB Chairman Daniel G. Pennington. "WRAP winners are companies solving real waste problems with simple, smart and innovative programs. They're also saving dollars by avoiding disposal costs. We applaud their efforts, congratulate them for being among this year's honorees, and hope they will serve as an inspiration to other businesses, large and small, because reducing the burden of waste in California is everybody's business."
<P>
	The business sector generates more than half of the state's waste, and efforts by companies to reduce and recycle are vitally important to help meet California's mandate to cut by 50 percent the amount of trash going into landfills as of the year 2000. Winners in the 1995 Waste Reduction Awards Program have instituted various programs to trim the amount of garbage they formerly sent to landfills.  All WRAP winners receive a certificate of recognition from the California Integrated Waste Management Board, as well as the right to use the WRAP winner logo to promote their waste reduction accomplishments.

Some outstanding examples of waste reduction include:<P>

	<STRONG>Fetzer Vineyards</STRONG> in <STRONG>Mendocino County</STRONG> has reduced its waste by 86 percent since 1990, saving more than $80,000 in disposal fees. During the same period, the vintner has diverted half a million pounds of solid waste from landfills. Fetzer's "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle" program composts 10,000 tons of grape seeds and stems, recycles 13.5 tons of plastic shrink wrap, and is incorporating recycled wood and doors, Pise' or rammed earth walls, and nontoxic paints and glues in the construction of its new administration building.<P>

	<STRONG>International Billings Service</STRONG> (IBS) of <STRONG>El Dorado Hills</STRONG> produces over 500 million bill statements a month, including forms and envelopes. The company's annual "Quality Celebration" was won by its Recycle Team last year, and since May 1993, IBS has diverted 3,644 tons of recyclable material from landfills, at a savings of over $481,000.<P>

	<STRONG>Northrup Gruman Corporation,</STRONG> headquartered in <STRONG>Los Angeles</STRONG>, is a leader in military and commercial aerostructures and defense electronics. The company's Nonhazardous Waste Minimization Committee expanded its Southern California program to include programs companywide in order to improve waste management, share best practices and document statistics. Northrup also recycles aluminum to benefit elementary schools, and its annual Earth Day programs raise employee awareness of environmental responsibilities. The corporation's toner cartridge recycling program has saved Northrup over $500,000 since its inception in 1992.<P>

	<STRONG>Sea World of California</STRONG>, an <STRONG>Anheuser-Busch</STRONG> theme park located in<STRONG> San Diego</STRONG>, has implemented recycling efforts resulting in diversion of 973,406 pounds of trash from local landfills. The park's programs have recycled nearly 324,800 pounds of clean green waste and 531,080 pounds of cardboard annually. Overall, Sea World's recycling program yielded a savings of $32,218 in 1994.<P>

	<STRONG>Target Stores</STRONG>, a discount department store chain with outlets in 34 states, has implemented recycling and waste reduction efforts in all of its operations and realized a 75-percent reduction in trash. In one year alone, Target achieved an 80-percent trashless packaging level in its softlines area (no pins, tissue, clips,  tape or individual bags). The chain's two California distribution centers and 90 of its stores are 1995 WRAP winners.<P>

	<STRONG>Warner Bros.</STRONG>, a 108-acre motion picture studio in Burbank that resembles a small city with myriad manufacturing and production facilities, sponsors the "Second Time AroundA Community Reuse Partnership" program which, in cooperation with <STRONG>Fox Studios</STRONG>, donates materials to over 650 nonprofit and educational organizations, thus conserving resources and providing community assistance. Since 1993, Warner Bros. has increased its waste diversion by 164 percent, reaching a diversion rate of 33 percent of all waste generated and saving $135,000 in hauling fees. The studio's waste prevention actions also result in tax deductions for the donations, and have netted revenue of over $35,000 from the sale of recyclable materials.<P>

	<STRONG>Yosemite Concessions Services (YCS) Corporation </STRONG>operates concession facilities in <STRONG>Yosemite National Park</STRONG> and implemented its waste reduction program in 1974. Twenty-six different materials have been added to the company's recycling program, which also includes composting. Over 25 percent of the company's waste is recycled, and more than 50 percent of the solid waste generated at its facilities is diverted from landfills. YCS' waste reduction programs have saved the company approximately $165,000 a year.<P>

	The California Integrated Waste Management Board, which oversees the state's mandate to reduce all waste going into landfills by 50 percent as of the year 2000, is encouraging business, industry and consumers to reduce the amount of waste generated. The Board's Waste Reduction Awards Program provides California businesses with public recognition for outstanding achievements in integrated waste management. Applicants are honored based on a set of criteria developed in cooperation with the business community. Practices evaluated include waste prevention, materials reuse, recycling, recycled-product procurement, and employee education.

<MARQUEE LOOP=INFINITE BEHAVIOR=ALTERNATE DIRECTION=RIGHT BGCOLOR=White ALIGN=Middle><H1>Congratulations!</H1></MARQUEE>

<B>That's what we'd like to say to your business once you have been selected as a 1996 Waste Reduction Award
Program (WRAP) winner.  The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) is
pleased to have this program to recognize business efforts to reduce waste.<P>

WRAP is an annual award program that recognizes California businesses who have made
outstanding efforts to reduce nonhazardous waste and send less garbage to landfills. 
Practices evaluated include waste prevention, materials reuse, recycling, recycled product
procurement, composting, and employee education.  Successful applicants receive
an award from the State of California, along with the rights to use the WRAP logo on
products, advertising, and promotional materials.<P>

The CIWMB distributes information to the media to further promote WRAP winners' achievements. 
In 1995, a press release was sent to statewide media representatives noting the accomplishments of 305 businesses who are both helping California communities meet their waste reduction goals <STRONG>AND</STRONG> saving money in the process.  <P>

We applaud all business efforts to reduce, reuse, and recycle.  These
activities conserve landfill space, save money, and, by purchasing recycled content products, help
promote markets for recycled materials.  We encourage all businesses to become models for other
businesses and strive to find additional ways to reduce waste where ever possible.  We
hope to see your business apply for WRAP, for the first time or again, in 1996.</B>

Why send it to the landfill when it is easier and better for your lawn to grasscycle.  Team up with retailers or manufacturers that sell or make mulching lawn mowers.  Jointly promote the benefits of grasscycling.  The CIWMB has brochures in English and Spanish that provide information you can use.  These are also available on diskette for easy customizing and printing.  Several cities have implemented successful programs.

Gardeners love the end product: a fine soil amendment.   The CIWMB has a kit available with information on setting up local home composting programs.
<LI><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Unwanted mail:</B></FONT>  Nearly everyone gripes about junk mail.  Campaigns to reduce junk mail will not make dramatic decreases in waste, but they are popular with the public and can be combined with other waste reduction efforts.  Use this type of program as a stepping stone toward greater waste prevention awareness.   The CIWMB has a fact sheet and sample outreach materials from other cities.</B></FONT>
<LI><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Excess packaging week:</B></FONT>  Select a week to designate as excess packaging week.

<P>
The idea of &quotpay as you throw&quot or &quotunit pricing&quot has been around a long time.  We face it every day for almost everything we buy: dollars per gallon of gasoline, per loaf of bread, per overnight video rental, per kilowatt hour of electricity, or per cubic foot of water.  In fact, prices that are not set by the unit are the exception, rather than the rule: all-you-can-eat pizza buffets, copier service agreements, and government services such as police and fire protection.

<P>
Municipal solid waste (household garbage disposal) has tradtionally been funded through taxes or flat rate billing.  This pricing scheme creates the same incentive as the all-you-can-eat pizza buffet: the smart economic move is to eat--or throw away--all you can, because the more you get for a fixed price, the better deal you're getting.  All-you-can-dump solid waste pricing has played a significant part in creating the national solid waste crisis, exemplified by disappearing landfill capacity, rising disposal costs, limited use of recycling programs, and the attitude that unlimited waste service is a right.

<P>
Therefore, unit pricing for solid waste disposal means charging a fee for each unit disposed.  The unit may be measured by the bag, by the can, or by the pound.

<P>
<A NAME="benefits"></A>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Benefits of unit pricing</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Although the transition to a unit pricing system can be difficult for agenices accustomed to flat rate billing, unit pricing can make a profound change that leads to a variety of benefits.  Most importantly, it creates the connection between each customer's cost and disposal habits, and provides an incentive for customers to make smarter choices in how they handle their waste.

<P>
All unit pricing systems offer important advantages for both the solid waste agencies and their customers:

<UL>
<LI><B>Increased awareness of solid waste costs.</B>  Traditionally, true solid waste operational costs have been obscured from the consumer by being lumped into one general tax bill that covers many public services.  Unit pricing makes customers aware of the cost of the waste services they use, and reinforces that awareness every time a customer pays a garbage bill or buys a pre-paid garbage bag or tag/sticker.
<P>
<LI><B>Incentive to reduce waste.</B>  When customers have to pay more for each can or bag disposed, they are likely to think twice before purchasing excessivly packaged products at the store, or throwing old lettuce into the trash instead of the compost pile.

<P>
<LI><B>Incentive to recycle.</B>  If throwing away is more expensive because the true costs of disposal are accounted for, recycling becomes a more economically beneficial option.  This financial incentive can help increase use of recycling programs, and can reduce total waste management system costs.

<P>
<LI><B>Reduced dependence on landfills or incinerators</B>  Unit pricing will reduce tonnage going to landfills or incinerators.  Therefore, the need for expansion of landfills is postponed.

<P>
<LI><B>Stabilized system costs</B>  Final disposal is often the most unstable, and sometimes the most expensive, component of solid waste system cost.  The incentives created by unit pricing by reducing the impact of landifll costs can help stabilize system costs.

<P>
<LI><B>Equity among customers.</B>  Flat-rate billings and taxes make no distinciton between high- and low-level disposers.  With unit pricing, customers are charged according to the amount of waste they dispose.

<P>
<LI><B>Help in meeting legislated diversion goals.</B>  The State of California, as well as other states and counties across the country, has mandated recycling or disposal reduction goals for communities within its jurisdiction.  Unit pricing systems can create incentives that encourage customers to change their disposal habits to help meet these goals.

<A NAME="introduction"></A>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Introduction:</B></FONT>
<DD><B>Grasscycling is the natural practice of leaving clippings 
on the lawn when mowing. This can save time, money and other resources like landfill space. The clippings quickly decompose, returning nutrients to the soil. Proper turf management, in conjunction with the practice of grasscycling, can reduce water and fertilizer requirements, mowing time, and disposal costs.

<P>
<DD>Yard trimmings make up the largest single component of California's municipal waste. In 1990, a drought year, this amounted to approximately six million tons, or 15 percent of the waste stream. It is estimated that grass clippings make up about half of all yard trimmings over the course of the year.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Photo caption: <A HREF="#Demo">Grasscycling demo at the State Capitol.</B></A></FONT>

<P>
<DD>The average California lawn generates 300 to 400 pounds of grass clippings per 1000 square feet annually. This can be as much as eight tons per acre each year!

<P>
<DD>The nitrogen contained in these clippings almost equals the recommended application rate for healthy turf (5 pounds of nitrogen per 1000 square feet per year). While some of this nitrogen is lost through the decomposition of the clippings, grasscycling can have the overall impact of reducing fertilization requirements by 25 percent or more. Similar savings on water use are possible.<P>

<DD>Mowing time can be reduced by 50 percent or more since the bagging and disposal of clippings is eliminated. Cost savings can even be realized in hidden ways. By not handling heavy bags of clippings, back injuries and other physical maladies can be avoided--a real savings on workman's compensation for landscape maintenance contractors!

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Grasscycling Demo at the State Capitol</B></FONT></CENTER>
<P>
Fountain Circle (see the picture at the top of this page) on the west side of California's state capitol was a demonstration ground for grasscycling.  The area normally took more than two hours to mow with a conventional bagging mower, but now takes only 45 minutes.  This was a cooperative effort among the CIWMB, Department of General Services, the Office of Buildings and Grounds, and the Toro Company.  The initial demonstration was well received and DGS/OBG is now converting its entire fleet to mulching (grasscycling) mowers.

<HR NOSHADE>

<P>
For educating others (landscapers, clients, residents,etc.), check out the CIWMB brochure <U>&quot;Grasscycling: Send Your Grass Back To Its Roots.&quot</U>
The brochure can be shipped by postal mail if requested through our email address: <A HREF="mailto:wpinfoex@mrt.ciwmb.ca.gov">wpinfoex@mrt.ciwmb.ca.gov</A>
<P>
The CIWMB has worked closely with the University of California Cooperative Extension in the development of informational materials. Close cooperation with the
California Landscape Contractors Association (who officially endorse
grasscycling), the Northern California Turf and Landscape Council, and the
Southern California Turfgrass Council has resulted in widespread interest and
increasing conversion to this time, money, and landfill saving practice.

<P>
If you try to print a Web page (like this one) that has white or non-black text, some printers will print a blank page. To overcome this, look for an option in your Web browser's "page setup" menu and select "black text" or a similar option. This will force the printer to treat any non-black text as black text.

<P>
<I>Here are a few ideas and suggestions on how to have a wonderful,
gift-giving, holiday season and still be earth friendly.</I>

<UL>
<P><LI>
Not sure what to get someone? How about a gift certificate? That way, you know the gift will be kept.
<P><LI> Make gifts. Everyone appreciates a homecooked meal or baked goodies.
<P><LI>Consider nonmaterial gifts. Tickets to a sporting event, movie, play, or concert are a real treat! Or make a charitable donation in someone's name.
<P><LI>When you go shopping,  bring your own reusable bags.
<P><LI>Think durable! Consider how long an item will last before you make a purchase. Often a cheaper item will wear out long before its more durable equivalent. 
<P><LI>Look for items made with recycled content. 
</UL>

<FONT SIZE=+3><B><I>No-Waste</I> Gift Wrapping Ideas</B></FONT>


<IMG SRC="../wpimage/13train.gif" ALT="Drawing of gift wrapped in comics." WIDTH=275 HEIGHT=218 HSPACE=5 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0 ALIGN=left>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P>


<UL>
<P><LI>
Creative wrapping paper substitutes include used blueprint paper,
the Sunday comics, or even the sports section for a sports enthusiast.
Design your own wrapping paper using paper shopping bags: decorate
them with paints, crayons, markers, or art projects from school.
<P><LI>Wrap the gift in a drawstring bag and use an inexpensive luggage
tag for the gift tag.
<P><LI>
Decorate oversized gifts with just a bow that can be used again.
<P><LI>
Put toy animals in a cowboy hat and wrap a cowboy scarf around
it.
<P><LI>
Put flea market 'jewels' in a jewelry box.
<P><LI>
Put a small gift in a knit hat and close the top with a barrette
or a decorative hat pin.
<P><LI>
Put games in a backpack or a kid's design pillow case.
<P><LI>
For a person who is handy, wrap a gift in a tool box.
<P><LI>
Put blouses and other gifts in decorative hat boxes and tie with
a hair ribbon.
<P><LI>
For a person who sews, wrap a gift in a fabric remnant and tie it
with a piece of lace, ribbon, or a tape measure.
<P><LI>
Any kitchen gift can be wrapped in a colorful dish towel. Kitchen
utensils can pop out of an oven mitt.
<P><LI>
Place home-baked cookies in a reusable tin box, a kitchen container,
or a decorated oatmeal box.
<P><LI>
Use a colorful tablecloth to wrap dishes or dining room gifts.
<P><LI>
For a reader, wrap a book in a reusable canvas shopping sack.
<P><LI>
For a gardener, put garden tools in the pocket of an apron, a planter,
or a bucket.
<P><LI>
Hang earrings, bracelets, or necklaces right on the Christmas tree,
or put them inside or around an open ornament.
<P><LI>
Wrap earrings or small items in a painted egg carton.
<P><LI>
Find a elegant bottle or neat old bottle from a flea market, thrift
store, or antique store and put a gift certificate inside it for
a cosmetics store that dispenses products for refillable containers.
<P><LI>
Search the flea market, garage sales, and thrift stores for interesting
old boxes that can be used as decorative packages.
<P><LI>
Make use of that old satin bathrobe that's falling apart at the
seams. Cut it up and use the pieces to wrap small packages or
as a tissue paper replacement. Check your scrap rag box for other
good pieces of interesting fabric that can be cut up and used
for wrapping.
<P><LI>
Search the attic for old family photos and mementos and give them
to your favorite relative wrapped in grandma's old hat and a lace
curtain.
<P><LI>
Replace tissue paper with old lace or strips of paper shopping
bags or used gift wrap.
<P><LI>
If you use traditional gift wrapping, always buy recycled-content
wrapping paper. If your store doesn't sell recycled-content wrapping
paper, ask the manager to order it in the future.
<P><LI>
If you send holiday cards, buy recycled-content cards and envelopes.
Or make your own cards out of last year's cards and the wrapping
paper you saved.
<P><LI>
Make gift tags from last year's holiday cards.
<P><LI>
Shipping a gift? Reuse the foam peanuts from another package,
or use unbuttered popcorn for packing.
<P><LI>
Create a child's play kit from what-nots found around the house.
1. Glue used comic book pictures, or playing cards from an incomplete
deck to an old box. 2. Fill the box with basic creative equipment:
scissors, glue, tape, crayons, and colorful paper scraps. 3. Search
the house for unmatched treasures: bent cookie cutters, old game
tokens, fabric scraps, ribbon, yarn, and so on. 4. Use leftover
dry-cleaner cardboard to cut out the various parts of a house,
(walls, roof, chimney, etc.). The child can assemble the house
and decorate it with the materials in the box.
<P><LI>
And don't forget to look for toys, books, and other products made from recycled materials.
<P><LI>
When unwrapping those gifts this year, save the ribbons, bows,
and other packaging to be used throughout the new year.
</UL>

<H2><B>It's Time to Open the Gifts!</B></H2>

<P>
<I>Before opening all those gaily wrapped packages from Santa
and his helpers, here are a few hints to get you through the mountains
of ribbon, stuffing, and wrapping.</I>
<P><UL>
</UL>

<P><LI> Set a box aside to collect the reusable ribbons, bows, and
other package decorations.
<P><LI>
 Most gifts boxes can be flattened and reused throughout the
year for other items. Recycle boxes that can't be reused.
<P><LI>
With all the excitement, people usually tear through the gift
wrap, so set aside a large box or bag to collect the torn gift
wrap. If there are large uncrumpled pieces of wrap, consider using
those pieces for wrapping future gifts.
<P>
CAUTION: Before taking the bag of used gift wrap out to the trash
can, check to make sure toy or game parts have not been accidently
dropped in the bag.
<P><LI>Drop off extra packaging materials at local private
mailing centers such as Mail Boxes Etc. Call the
Plastic Loosefill Products Council (1-800-828-2214)
for the names of local businesses that reuse them.
<P><LI>
Put this year's Christmas cards away to cut up and use as gift
tags for next year's gifts.
<P><LI>
 Got a new microwave, toaster, clock radio, toy, or coat? Consider
giving away your old appliances, toys, games, or clothing to a
local charity or thrift store.
<P><LI>
Before you throw away or recycle all of those gift catalogs, take a
minute to pick out the ones you don't want to receive anymore. Call
their toll-free numbers NOW and ask to get off their list.
<P><LI>
 If you bought a live Christmas tree, be sure to plant it. Or
consider donating it a local school or nursing home to plant on
their grounds.
<P><LI> If you bought a cut tree, remove all decorations including
tinsel and lights before recycling. Check your local paper for
instructions on recycling options and the dates for pickup or
dropoff. City and county Christmas tree recycling programs are
also advertised on the radio.<HR><!----------------------------------Other sites links---------------------------------->

<H2>How do I get on mailing lists?</H2>

<P>
Every time you enter a contest, make a donation, buy something,
order a product by mail, write a check, or send in a subscription
or warranty card, chances are your name and address are being
added to a mailing list of some kind. Then the mailing list may
be sold or traded.
<H2>What can I do to reduce junk mail?</H2>

<P>
Below are steps you can take to reduce junk mail. Be patient;
it takes three to six months before you notice a reduction in
your junk mail.
<H2>Call mail order catalog companies</H2>

<P>
Most catalogs provide an 800 telephone number for placing an order;
call this number and ask to be taken off their mailing list.

<H2>Contact specific organizations or businesses</H2>

If you receive unwanted flyers or mail, call the customer service
department of the organization or business responsible and request
that your name be removed from their mailing list. Alternatively,
send in a written request that is signed and dated. Include a
sample of the mailing label so the sender can identify how you
are listed in their files.
<H2>Return junk mail</H2>

Envelopes stamped &quot;address correction requested&quot;
or &quot;return postage guaranteed&quot; can be retuned unopened to the sender by writing &quot;refused, return to sender&quot; on the envelope. DO NOT write this on mail without that special notation; the post office will not return it to the
sender.
<H2>Get off national mailing lists</H2>

<P>
Write to the address below and ask to be placed on a &quot;suppress&quot;
file. Include a list of your name and address in all the different
ways it appears on your junk mail. The Mail Preference Service
places your name in the suppress file for five years. The Direct
Marketing Association sends this list to its business subscribers
four times a year.

<H2>Xeriscaping: establishing a waste efficient landscape</H2>

<HR>
<P>
Just as the State of California instituted a hierarchy of preferred
waste management practices, with prevention at the top, so too
can a landscape be designed from the beginning to prevent or reduce
the amount of resources needed to maintain it and the amount of
waste it produces. Each region of California has different resource
conditions, such as available water, soil type, temperature ranges
and lighting. By designing a landscape in an appropriate manner,
selecting compatible plants, and installing efficient irrigation
systems, a balance can be achieved that fits both the aesthetic
needs of the landowner or client, and the resource availability
of the region.
<P>
Many times a landscape is &quot;inherited&quot; it is already
established and you are simply charged with maintaining it. A
transition to a more resource efficient landscape may be a possibility.
However, long term resource efficiency improves when planning
and preparation can be given attention ahead of time.
<HR>

<H3><B><A NAME="design">Landscape Design and Plant Selection</A>
</B></H3>

<P>
The first question to ask in considering a landscape is &quot;Why?&quot;.
Why have a landscape? Why install plants and a lawn instead of
decking or pavement? What is it to be used for? Will it be an
active recreational space or a quiet, contemplative area for meditative
toiling? Whatever the intended use, proper design and plant selection
can reduce the amount of waste a landscape generates through maintenance.
In the end, that means time and money savings.<BR>
<P>
Today's waste efficient landscapes use &quot;unthirsty&quot; plants--California
natives and drought tolerant exotics. Proper soil preparation,
garden layout, and planting time assures that plants can mature
into beautiful specimens with minimal trimming. In a word, the
modern approach to California landscaping is xeriscaping.<HR>

<H3><B>What is xeriscaping?</B></H3>

<P>
Literally, the word xeriscaping comes from a combination of two
other words: &quot;xeri-&quot; derived from the Greek word &quot;xeros&quot;
for dry; and &quot;-scape&quot;, meaning a kind of view or scene.
While xeriscape translates to mean &quot;dry scene&quot;, in practice
xeriscaping means simply landscaping with slow growing, drought
tolerant plants to conserve water and reduce yard trimmings. 
<P>
The practice of xeriscaping will vary from region to region in
California. Plants which are appropriate in one climate may not
work well in another. The moist northwest may even be considered
inhospitable to sturdy plants of the desert south. Landscapes
need to be planned to be compatible with locally available resources,
including water, soil types and sunlight. <BR>

<P>
California's limited supply of water, subject to ever increasing
demands, is just one resource saved by xeriscaping. This results
in immediate cost savings through lower water bills. Xeriscaping
can reduce the amount of plant trimmings which must be disposed
of or otherwise managed, thereby helping your community, and ultimately
you, to save resources. A reduction in plant trimmings can reduce
the amount of labor needed to maintain a given landscape. Or,
put another way, reduced plant maintenance allows more time to
be spent on other aspects of landscape maintenance, or on another
landscape account.<BR>

<P>
Xeriscapes generally require less fertilizer and pest control
measures than traditional landscapes. Because pesticides and fertilizers
can inadvertently harm beneficial organisms, as well as impact
air and water quality, reducing their use is a good idea. And,
of course, using less of these materials saves money. <BR>

<P>
While indigenous plants are naturally accustomed to local climates
and therefore good choices for water and waste efficient landscapes,
xeriscaping doesn't mean planting California native plants only.
For example, one could draw from many available colorful drought
tolerant plants native to other &quot;Mediterranean&quot; climates
such as Southern Europe, North Africa, Western Asia, South Africa,
and Australia. There are many excellent books that provide further
information on this subject (please refer to References and Resources
section), as well as a growing number of nurseries that specialized
in xeriscape plants.<HR>

<P>
Healthy soils grow healthy plants. A well drained soil, generally
defined as one that can absorb &#189; inch of water or more per
hour, creates a good environment for grass, plants, and trees
to set deep roots and take advantage of deep water and nutrients.
In the long run this makes for healthy, steady growth with reduced
fertilization and irrigation needs. Of course a soil can be too
well drained, such as a sandy soil, and need some help to better
hold water and nutrients for plants.
<P>
The addition of the proper soil amendments can either help a soil
drain faster or slower. Well composted organic material is an
ideal amendment that can serve both these purposes. Additionally,
a good compost provides a source of slow release nutrients for
plants. The balanced growth encouraged by these conditions can
reduce pruning maintenance as well as disease and pest pressures.
<P>
Having a soil tested for organic and nutrient content is a good
idea before the addition of any amendment. The test results can
indicate what nutrients are lacking in addition to how much compost
or other organic material should be added. Additionally, knowing
the attributes of the compost or amendment is wise. Ask the producer
of the product for an analysis, or have the material tested by
a soils lab. Finally, obtain advice from a horticultural expert
regarding the soil types in your area and the needs of specific
plants.
<P>
For amendments to effectively enhance soil properties, thorough
blending or tilling is important in any area that roots will initially
grow. The deeper that amendments can be blended into the soil,
the better. For lawns, a minimum of six inches is recommended.
For most shrubs, digging a donut-shaped ring approximately three
or four times the width of the root ball which extends down an
additional six inches below the bottom of the root ball is a good
idea. The root ball itself should sit on an intact or well stablized
soil platform.
<P>
For most trees, the planting hole preparation is the same as for
shrubs, except that minimal amending of native soils is recommended.
Rather, after planting, start a program of nutritious surface
mulching to slowly improve all soil within the tree's drip line.
Stake a tree on either side and loosely tie it as low as possible
for support during it's first year to protect and help the tree
get established.
<P>
Water efficient irrigation systems are also waste efficient. By
providing water in moderation, and only to where a landscape requires
moisture, excessive plant and weed growth can be avoided. Recent
advances in irrigation technology allow for precise delivery of
water with very little waste. Drip systems and micro-emitters
have become very cost effective when evaluated against water restrictions
and rising water costs. The real solid waste benefit of these
systems is that water and fertilizer go toward growing the plants
desired, preventing nutrient-consuming and waste-generating weed
growth in other areas.
<P>
Remember to always amend and blend a soil prior to installing
the irrigation systems to avoid damage to the system.
<P>
Do your part by designing, installing, or converting landscapes
to be low waste, water efficient, easily maintained xeriscapes.
