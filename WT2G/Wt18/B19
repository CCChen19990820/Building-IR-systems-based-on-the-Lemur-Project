<FONT SIZE=+2>Overview of<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=+3><B>California Yard Waste Issues:</FONT></B>
<P>
California is known for its landscapes, both natural and created.
The expansive yards and &quot;Sunset&quot; gardens of the state's
urban and suburban communities are nearly as famous as the coastline,
oak-dotted rolling hills, and grand Sierra. But while the natural
beauty of the Golden State has been gifted to its fortunate residents
by Nature, the created beauty comes at a price.

<P>
To develop and maintain the cherished landscapes that frame our
homes and buildings requires significant input.  Water, soil amendments,
fertilizer, hardscape, and other natural and manufactured resources
come together to give us the greenery we surround ourselves with.
And out of these landscapes come the trimmings--grass, leaves,
branches, and weeds--that need to be managed. Conventionally this
has meant disposal; stuffing yard waste into garbage cans, piling
it in the street, or hauling it to the dump. For many reasons
this convention needs to change.
<P>
California generated over 40 million tons of municipal solid waste
in 1990. At over eight pounds per person per day, Californians
produce <I><B>more waste than any other population on Earth</B></I>. Official numbers
derived from mandated studies put yard waste at about 15 percent
of the total, or close to six million tons each year. Many believe
that these numbers may be artificially low because the waste studies
were performed during drought years when plant and weed growth
was slowed by water restrictions.
<P>
Compounding concerns about the burden on California's disposal
systems were studies performed in the late 1980s which indicated
that the State was running out of landfill space. While some communities
did have access to landfills that would, at current rates of filling,
last for decades, 70 percent of the State's population lived in
counties that would face a capacity shortage within only 15 years.
More frightening, the studies indicated 40 percent of the state's
population lived in ten counties with less than five years of
remaining permitted landfill capacity. Without the curtailment
the filling rates and the development of new capacity, it was
feared that many communities would soon have no place to put their
waste.
<P>
Recognizing the urgency of this situation, the California Legislature
passed the Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989. Often referred
to by its Assembly Bill (AB) number, 939, this Act created programs
and modified existing laws to better manage the state's residues.
One of the most notable components of AB 939, and certainly that
which gets the most public attention, is the waste reduction goals
it sets.

<P>
California cities and counties are required to plan for
and implement programs to reduce the amount of generated waste
that goes to landfills, or other disposal, 25 percent by the year
1995, and 50 percent by the turn of the century. 

<P>
Additionally, AB 939 set out a preferred approach, or management
hierarchy, for dealing with this waste. In order of preference
this is: source reduction (also known as waste prevention); recycling
and composting; transformation (which includes incineration);
and lastly landfilling. The plans and programs developed by communities
should follow this hierarchy in addressing waste issues. Finally,
AB 939 created the California Integrated Waste Management Board
(CIWMB) to coordinate the development and implementation of programs.

<P>
Other states in the U.S. have recognized similar waste management
concerns within their borders and have reacted in a variety of
ways. Many states have set waste reduction goals, though few are
as aggressive as California's 50 percent. On the other hand, some
states have gone much further and simply banned the disposal of
selected materials, most commonly yard waste. In 1994, nearly
half the states had some form of yard waste disposal restriction
in place, either at the state or local levels.
<P>
So far, legislative measures to restrict the disposal of any nonhazardous
waste have not gone far in California. Preferring to leave the
decision to local governments who best know what programs are
feasible in their communities, the State has simply set goals
to achieve. However, these goals should not be taken lightly.
To achieve them will require the participation of every waste
generator, public and private, and communities will be looking
to those that produce the larger portions of the waste stream
to help the most.
<P>
So, aside from a social responsibility to reduce the amount of
waste a person or business generates, are there any other reasons?
<P>
Typically, when the cause of waste generation is analyzed, it
can found that resources are consumed (e.g., money, materials,
etc.) in order to buy or produce a good or service. As noted at
the beginning of this page, the landscaping industry uses many
resources to produce the beautiful settings clients and homeowners
expect. On the back end, more resources are required to properly
dispose of the waste, either in the form of time and labor, or
fees paid to someone else, or both. With planning and minor adjustments
to business as usual, the amount of waste produced by an activity
can be reduced or eliminated, and significant savings can be realized
in return.

<H2>Home composting--small and easy</H2>

Composting can be done in most backyards in a homemade or manufactured
composting bin or an open pile (some cities do require enclosed
bins). Businesses, schools, and other facilities with adequate
yard area can also easily compost. Professional landscapers should
consider offering the service of maintaining a compost bin or
pile for their clients. This could save trips to the dump, and
produce compost for use at that account.<BR><BR>
Consider contacting your city or county government for information
about free composting workshops and discounted composting bins.
You can obtain many ready-to-use bins through retail or mailorder
establishments. Even an old garbage can may be used for composting
if you punch holes in the sides and bottom. For a description
of how to build your own bin or a list of manufactured home composting
bins, check out the bin page.<HR>

<H2>Recipe for composting</H2>

<P>
While a multitude of organisms, fungus and bacteria are involved
in the overall process, there are four basic ingredients for composting:
nitrogen, carbon, water and air. Composting is a lot like cooking,
and the easiest compost recipe calls for blending roughly equal
parts of green or wet material (which is high in nitrogen) and
brown or dry material (which is high in carbon). Simply layer
or mix these materials in a pile or enclosure; chop or shred large
pieces to 12&quot; or shorter. Water and fluff to add air. Then
leave it to the microorganisms which will break down the material
over time.<HR>

<H3>Nitrogen</H3>

<P>
Grass clippings, landscape trimmings, and green garden waste are
ideal sources of nitrogen for composting. Vegetable and fruit
trimmings and peels can also provide nitrogen. To reduce the potential
for pests or odors, it is best to avoid meat or dairy scraps and
bury any food scraps deep within the compost pile. <HR>

<H3>Carbon</H3>

<P>
Dry yard and garden material such as dry leaves, twigs, or hay
can provide the carbon balance for a compost pile. Untreated wood
chips and sawdust are a powerful carbon source which may be useful
if the pile contains excess nitrogen. <HR>

<H3>Water</H3>

<P>
One of the most common mistakes in composting is letting the pile
get too dry. Your compost pile should be moist as a wrung-out
sponge. A moisture content of 40 to 60 percent is preferable.
To test for adequate moisture, reach into your compost pile and
grab a handful of material and squeeze it; if a few drops of water
come out, it's probably got enough moisture, if it doesn't, add
water. When you water, it is best to put a hose into the pile
so that you aren't just wetting the top. You can also water as
you are turning the pile. During dry weather, you may have to
add water regularly. A properly constructed compost pile will
drain excess water and not become soggy. <HR>

<H3>Air</H3>

<P>
The bacteria and fungus that are in your compost pile need oxygen
to live and work. If your pile is too dense or becomes too wet,
the air supply to the inside is cut off and the beneficial organisms
die. Decomposition will slow and an offensive odor may arise.
To avoid this and speed the process, turn and fluff the pile with
a pitchfork often, perhaps weekly. You can also turn the pile
by just re-piling it into a new pile; many composting bins make
this easy to do by coming apart so you can easily re-pile the
old pile back into the bin.<HR>

<H3>Time, temperature, and style</H3>

<P>
Composting can be done in a hot, fast, &quot;gourmet&quot; fashion
by the active gardener or in a more casual manner. Both ways will
have a positive effect on the environment and produce useable
compost. It just depends on how much time you want to spend with
your compost pile and how fast you want the compost. <BR>
&quot;Gourmet&quot; compost piles that have the right blend of
nitrogen (greens) and carbon (browns) and are kept moist and fluffed
regularly, will heat up to temperatures of 120 to 140 degrees
Fahrenheit. These high temperatures will kill most weed seeds
and speed up the process so that the &quot;compost&quot; could
be ready in just a few months.<BR>
&quot;Casual&quot; compost piles are also quite workable since
compost will &quot;happen&quot; even if you just pile on yard
and food waste, water sporadically, and wait. The pile won't get
as hot, so it won't decompose as quickly and may not kill weed
seeds. Casual composting can take more time.<HR>

<H3>Size</H3>

<P>
Ideally, the compost pile should be at least three feet wide by
three feet deep by three feet tall (one cubic yard). This size
provides enough food and insulation to keep the organisms warm
and happy and working hard. However, piles can be larger or smaller
and work just fine if managed well.<HR>

<H3>How to tell when it's done.</H3>

<P>
Your compost is finished when the original material has been transformed
into a uniform dark brown, crumbly product with a pleasant earthy
aroma. There may be a few chunks of woody material left; these
can be screened out and put back into a new pile. <BR>
You may want to stop adding to your compost pile after it gets
to optimal size (see above) and start a new pile so that your
first pile can finish decomposing (during which time the temperature
will drop).<HR>

<P>
Composting is best learned while doing. Through practice and observation
you will find what works best for your situation, and you can
modify the process to suit your needs. There are also a number
of books written on small scale composting; check your local library
or bookstore. Also, remember to check with your local government
for workshops, handouts, or guides on composting. <BR></FONT>

<DT><H3><B>What is Project Recycle? </B></H3>

Project Recycle is the California State  <A HREF="../../../mrt/wpw/wpdefin1.htm">waste reduction and recycling</A> program administered by the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) to reduce the amount of waste State facilities generate and throw away.  This comprehensive program implements waste prevention, reuse, and recycling programs at State-owned and leased buildings and facilities.

<DT><H3><B>What mandates it? </B></H3>

<A HREF="execord.htm">Executive Order W-7-91</A> requires California State agencies to buy recycled products and set up recycling programs for recyclable materials, where feasible, and the CIWMB to assist in these efforts.
<P>
<B>Public Contract Code (PCC) Sections 12164.5-12167.1</B> require the CIWMB to implement and maintain a recycling plan for the Legislature and all State-owned and leased buildings and provide for the recycling of office paper, corrugated cardboard, newsprint,  beverage containers, waste oil and any other recyclable material generated in sufficient quantity.  PCC 12165 (d) prohibits establishment of a recycling program by any State office, agency, or its emplyees without CIWMB approval.  PCC 12167.1 requires State agencies and institutions to report quantities of materials collected for recycling to the CIWMB.
<P>
<B>Public Resources Code, Sections 42560-42562</B> require the CIWMB to initiate a high grade, white office paper recovery assistance program for California State offices by providing training materials and recycling containers, identifying markets for collected materials and negotiating contracts with local secondary material brokers.
<DT><H3><B>What policies and procedures govern Project Recycle?</B></H3>
<A HREF="http://www.nfoweb.com/folio.pgi/samm/query=*/doc/{6758,0,0,0}/hit_headings/words=4/hits_only?">California State Administrative Manual Chapter 1900</A> informs employees at state facilities of the CIWMB's policies and procedures regarding the prevention of solid waste generation and, alternatively, the reuse or recycling of solid waste.  It describes related State agency and individual
State facility responsibilities.

<DT><H3><B>Where does it exist? </B></H3>
This program exists in all types of California State-owned and leased facilities including
offices, universities and colleges, prisons, youth authority facilities, developmental centers, hospitals, maintenance facilities, and parks.

<DT><H3><B>What resources are assigned to this program? </B></H3>

Project Recycle is administered by six full-time employees and
three part-time student assistants.  Revenue from the sale of recyclables
is used to purchase recycling containers and equipment for California State-owned and leased facilities.

<DT><H3><B>What is Project Recycle's mission? </B></H3>
Project Recycle's mission is to coordinate comprehensive recycling and other waste reduction programs at State facilities by:<P>

<DL><DD><LI>managing State recycling contracts;<P>

<LI>training and advising State employees and recycling coordinators;<P>

<LI>acting as a liaison between State facilities and recyclers;<P>

<LI>providing recycling information, supplies, and equipment;<P>

<LI>gathering and reporting data on materials collected for recycling; and<P>

<LI>publishing a quarterly Project Recycle Update.
<P>
</DL>
<DT><H3><B>What is Project Recycle's purpose? </B></H3>
<P>

<DL><DD><LI>set a good example of State leadership in conserving natural resources through recycling;<P>

<LI>generate revenue to support the State's recycling program;<P>

<LI>assist in meeting AB 939 solid waste reduction goals.<P>
</DL>
<DT><H3><B>What is Project Recycle's current status? </B></H3>

As of January 1996, Project Recycle coordinates and monitors waste reduction and recycling programs at over <B>900</B> State facilities.  During 1995, <B>25,450 tons</B> of material were reported collected from California State facilities. This is a 10 percent increase over the <B>23,184 tons</B> collected in 1994, a 65 percent percent increase over the <B>15,469 tons</B> collected in 1993 and a 138 percent increase over the <B>10,677 tons</B> collected in 1992.

  1995 Annual Report
</H4>
<H2>
  <I>The Quiet Revolution in Waste Management</I>
</H2>
<H1>
  Executive Summary
</H1>
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
There was a time when most Californians thought of their trash as the exclusive
property of the local landfill. Reduce, reuse, and recycle was the road less
traveled; the waste stream, a current that flowed largely in the direction
of disposal.
<P>
But then a funny thing happened on the way to the dump. People began to realize
that while landfills are an important, necessary part of the state's
infrastructure, indiscriminate disposal of waste was an imprudent strategy
for California. Health risks, diminishing landfill capacity, and threats
to the environment all combined with a recognition that there was market
potential in much of what was being discarded. A mainstream response to the
waste stream dilemma was taking shape.
<P>
That shape took on its clarity with passage of the Integrated Waste Management
Act (AB 939) in 1989, which established the basis for a new approach to
management of California's waste stream. The centerpiece of the act: mandated
goals of 25 percent diversion of the state's waste from landfills by 1995,
and 50 percent diversion by the year 2000.
<P>
The act also set the stage for a series of reforms affecting waste management
at the state and local levels, and today, amidst all the changes California
is experiencing as we approach the 21st century, a quiet revolution in waste
management has begun to change the attitudes and infrastructure that frame
California's response to its waste and recycling needs. Needless disposal
is out. Reduce, reuse, and recycle is in.
<P>
The Integrated Waste Management Board is responsible for oversight of this
far-reaching effort. We also play a central role in promoting achievement
of our ambitious waste diversion goals. And we enforce provisions of law
designed to protect the environment and the public's health and safety.
<P>
Fully aware that our goals will be achieved through local programs, the board
has successfully forged a positive, productive working relationship with
key elements of the public and private sectors. Indeed, partnership has proven
essential to managing a changing waste infrastructure. An alliance of state
and local governments; waste, recycling, and technology industries; environmental
and public interest groups; and an involved public is bringing true integrated
waste management to California. Here at the waste board, we call it "partnership
in practice."
<P>
With our mission in full gear, the year 1995 produced results today, and
progress for tomorrow.
<H3>
  Leaving Less Behind for the Future
</H3>
<H4>
  <I>Results</I> <I>Today</I>
</H4>
<P>
When the Integrated Waste Management Act became law, California was only
diverting 12.5 percent of its waste from landfills. Reduce, reuse, and recycle
was a concept far removed from practice, and 25 percent statewide diversion
was a distant goal. Today, the three Rs are a way of life in the Golden State,
and our first diversion threshold is being hurdled as we raise the bar once
more. Projections estimate we have met and surpassed 25 percent statewide
diversion.
<P>
This is a triumph of local leadership. Jurisdictions throughout California
have collectively increased the number of diversion programs in the state
by 155 percent since 1990. Localities are in compliance and leading the way:
to date, more than 1,000 plans have been submitted to the board by local
jurisdictions identifying how they will achieve diversion; all but a handful
have received approval or conditional approval from the board.
<P>
This campaign to which the board is providing sound, consistent leadership
is being won at the local level. The dynamic shift in how our state handles
its waste, like so many other California success stories, is largely rooted
in community response, and community spirit. A few examples:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Just a few years ago, the waste diversion rates for the City of Victorville
    and the Town of Apple Valley were about 3.5 percent and 7.6 percent,
    respectively. Since then, they have responded to the challenge through a
    variety of diversion programs and a cooperative effort to build a material
    recovery and transfer facility designed to process source-separated recyclables,
    mixed waste, and green waste. Today, they are projected to meet the 25 and
    50 percent diversion mandates.
  <LI>
    Calaveras County and the City of Angels Camp have really turned it around.
    In 1990, the city had a diversion rate of 4.8 percent, the county only 2.1
    percent. But before the end of 1995, both had met the 25 percent goal. How
    did they do it? Through a combination of programs implemented by local government
    and private businesses. Some of these programs are buyback centers, curbside
    recycling, paper recycling in schools and government offices, a home composting
    program, yard waste collection sites, and landfill rate structures to encourage
    separation of inert construction materials.
  <LI>
    In December 1995, the West Contra Costa Integrated Waste Management Agency
    became the first regional agency to have a board-approved regional plan.
    This was the result of a working partnership between board staff and local
    jurisdictions. These jurisdictions, whose individual plans for achieving
    diversion had been disapproved in 1993, decided to work together and apply
    a regional approach to their objectives. They adopted a regional Source Reduction
    and Recycling Element detailing how they will cooperatively implement programs
    to achieve diversion mandates.
  <LI>
    The City of Oxnard has implemented a number of waste reduction programs,
    including an automated curbside recycling pilot program. A collection truck
    has been designed to collect both refuse and recyclables with a "split container"
    system. Residents place all their recyclables on one side and refuse in the
    other. Mechanically operated, the collection truck is designed to keep the
    materials separated for transportation to a recycling station and landfill.
    This curbside program allows all collections to be made with one truck, improving
    efficiency, reducing impact on local pollution and transportation, and increasing
    recycling participation.
</UL>
<P>
To bolster the efforts of local government, the IWMB continues its state-local
partnership program. Through contracts with the League of California Cities,
California State Association of Counties, and other local organizations,
the IWMB has extended its waste prevention and public education efforts.
For example, the board developed <I>Closing the Loop: Integrated Waste Management
Activities for School and Home,</I> a waste management curriculum for K-12
schoolchildren, and trains teachers to incorporate this curriculum as part
of their ongoing environmental and science education programs. The Cupertino
Union Elementary School District in Santa Clara County and the Round Valley
School District in Mendocino County have embraced the <I>Closing the Loop
</I>program, which has found huge success with the schoolchildren. The board
has implemented a community pilot program to determine the success of waste
prevention programs such as this.
<P>
Finally, a study conducted for the board revealed one of the lesser publicized
benefits of increased diversion: expanded landfill capacity. We know that
diversion is bringing us resource conservation, a cleaner environment, and
enhanced public health and safety. But thanks in large part to successful
diversion occurring around the state, materials that landfills once absorbed
are making their way to secondary markets. As a result, the report, <I>Toward
Ensuring Adequate Landfill Capacity </I>indicates that years of remaining
statewide capacity increased from 13-18 years in 1990 to as much as 28 years
by 1993-an increase of about 43 percent. During the same period, per capita
waste disposal declined from 7.9 pounds per day to 5.9 pounds per day, resulting
in a decline in annual statewide disposal from 42.5 million tons in 1990
to 34 million tons in 1993. The findings of this report show that expanded
diversion and preserved capacity are two sides of the same coin.
<H4>
  <I>Progress for Tomorrow</I>
</H4>
<P>
Recognizing the challenge local governments have accepted, the board is already
looking ahead to 50 percent diversion by the year 2000. To date, the IWMB
has developed more than 100 separate tools and resources to assist those
working to increase diversion around the state. Among these are guidelines,
standards, models, research reports, media events, seminars, public education
curricula, grants, loans, and direct technical assistance.
<P>
The board has also begun a series of workshops to identify ways to achieve
50 percent diversion and, perhaps more importantly, the obstacles to reaching
50 percent diversion and how the board can help to eliminate them. These
workshops, involving affected parties from the public and private sectors,
again demonstrate the board's commitment to keeping intact the "partnership
in practice" that has propelled us this far; a partnership that unlocked
the door to 25 percent diversion, and holds the key to 50 percent.
<H3>
  Paving a Path to the Marketplace
</H3>
<H4>
  <I>Results Today</I>
</H4>
<P>
All the good intentions and great ideas to spur reduction, reuse, and recycling
of waste are for naught if there are insufficient markets for secondary
materials. Responding to the call for leadership on this front, the board
has pursued an assertive yet thoughtful approach to stimulating markets for
waste. Our efforts have been helpful; marked by creativity, responsiveness
and, just as important, an adherence to the guiding principle of limiting
government's role in the marketplace.
<P>
In the past, we have reported on the progress of our Recycling Market Development
Zone (RMDZ) Program, which provides assistance to start-up and expanding
recycling businesses. Forty zones have been established throughout California,
where businesses are eligible for financial assistance, including low-interest
loans and tax credits, to build and run their recycling operations. Through
this program, nearly 650 jobs have been created or saved, and 1.5 million
tons of waste are being diverted annually from landfills for reuse.
<P>
While the board has proven it can do much to help stimulate markets for secondary
materials, California's markets belong to California's businesses and consumers.
In 1995, the board adopted its Private Buy Recycled Strategy to encourage
business, industrial, and residential consumers to purchase products manufactured
with or packaged in recycled materials.
<P>
The centerpiece of the strategy is the formation of "alliances" involving
private industry, local governments, and others to overcome barriers to the
purchase of recycled-content products. Some of the barriers being addressed
are pricing, availability, quality and performance standards issues. Alliances
with whom the board has initiated work include the Alliance of Motion Picture
and Television Producers and the Recycled Paper Coalition (RPC).
<P>
In particular, the Central Valley Chapter of the RPC has been designated
as a regional paper alliance, composed of companies like Bank of America,
Aerojet, and Coca-Cola and recycling organizations like Business for the
Environment and Global Futures. They are continuing to add new members, and
soon we will begin providing them with assistance in setting purchasing goals,
measurement, and reporting progress on purchases.
<H4>
  <I>Progress for Tomorrow</I>
</H4>
<P>
The board has recognized that one of the keys to reaching 50 percent diversion
by the year 2000 will be the development of long-term markets for compost.
After all, yard waste is the single largest component of California's waste
stream. In 1995, we helped to achieve a major breakthrough in developing
markets for compost from urban green material and other feedstocks by
coordinating development of voluntary compost quality guidelines for agricultural
applications (by far the largest end use for compost). The guidelines, developed
by a steering committee convened by the board comprising agricultural and
compost industry representatives in California, are now being implemented
by an industry trade group.
<P>
We have also been successful in promoting one of the important benefits of
composting: building up our soil resources. Throughout the state, people
are beginning to understand that "compost makes soil sense."
<P>
To extend our efforts to the field, we provided funds for five compost
demonstration projects in key agricultural areas around the state. Each project
involves local growers, compost producers, agriculture extension agents,
and local government. The projects will enable us to assess how these operations
run most effectively, and how they can best accommodate an expanding compost
recycling effort in California.
<P>
We are also moving forward on other market development efforts. We plan to
update our market development plan in 1996. We also expect to continue our
Rigid Plastic Packaging Container Program study to develop a methodology
for measuring recycling rates for plastic containers; again, our "partnership
in practice" is demonstrated by our convening of a broad-based advisory group
to develop the methodology. Finally, recognizing that recovery, or supply,
of high quality postconsumer materials must expand or the increasing demand
by manufacturers will stall, we will be shifting some of our emphasis to
increasing recovery.
<P>
The Private Buy Recycled Strategy discussed earlier is an excellent example
of our philosophy on market development: building networks and partnerships
where businesses, state agencies and others can share approaches, problems
and solutions, and using this knowledge to meet the challenge of developing
reliable, stable and competitive markets for all products made from diverted
waste.
<H3>
  A Reasoned Regulatory Approach
</H3>
<P>
As California reaches 25 percent diversion and begins its advance toward
50 percent, an ever-expanding list of innovative recycling and reuse techniques
are being developed. For the past few years, the board has proactively sought
to review and revise its regulations to promote the development of these
new industries and to assist local jurisdictions in developing plans necessary
to achieve the waste diversion mandates.
<P>
The board has already made significant reforms to California's solid waste
regulatory process over the past two years, eliminating duplication and conflict
with other agencies, streamlining reporting requirements, and simplifying
the permitting process. A 10 percent reduction in state fees for landfills
took effect in 1994, and the cap on future fees has been lowered by 20 percent.
Most of our reforms accomplish the dual objectives of relieving burdens on
business and strengthening our position relative to achieving 50 percent
diversion. All of our reforms preserve the highest standards of health and
environmental protection for which California is so well known.
<H4>
  <I>Results Today</I>
</H4>
<P>
Landmark legislation in 1993 began efforts between the IWMB and the State
Water Resources Control Board to overhaul existing landfill management programs
in order to eliminate the duplicative and often conflicting regulatory
requirements, site review, and enforcement practices of the two agencies.
Fee programs were immediately restructured to consolidate existing fee collection
and further reduce the overall dollar amount assessed to industry. Subsequent
representative workgroup meetings identified broad areas for regulatory/policy
revision.
<P>
Over the past year, we have spent considerable resources rewriting all
regulations affecting landfill management to eliminate overlap, duplication,
and conflicting requirements. In order to gain support for this fundamental
shift in the landfill management program, draft regulations were circulated
for interagency review, including all regional water boards and local enforcement
agencies (more than 70 entities) for review in the latter part of 1995. We
are continuing to receive comment and make changes from that initial informal
review in order to begin the next round of review by all interested parties
in the spring of 1996.
<P>
Beginning with a series of "Permit Reform Workshops" in 1994, the board sought
to replace the one-size-fits-all permit with a tiered approach to regulatory
oversight. Working with all interested parties, we have developed a system
that is both flexible and responsive, in which facilities will be permitted
commensurate with the nature of their operation.
<P>
The regulatory tiers became effective in March 1995, now providing five levels
of oversight, ranging from exclusion to a full permit. The next step; placement
of the varying waste management operations within the tiers; began in 1995
as well. Compost operations were placed within the tiers first; industry,
environmental interests, and local governments lauded both the process and
the product. We then addressed contaminated soils operations, and placed
them successfully in the tiers in March 1996.
<H4>
  <I>Progress for Tomorrow</I>
</H4>
<P>
Using the methodology developed, the board will continue its work on the
regulatory tiers in 1996, focusing on material recovery facilities, transfer
stations, and recycling operations as one package. Other facilities that
will be taken up later include those which handle special wastes like sewage
sludge and construction/demolition debris.
<P>
For local jurisdictions, successful integrated waste management requires
building programs uniquely configured to meet their own needs. Seeking to
help with this task, we have begun work on a cost model that will provide
information to allow comparison of various types of diversion programs. Some
of the information will include costs related to construction, operation,
and maintenance; funding sources; staffing needs; siting issues; and types
and amounts of material handled. This information, which will be objective,
current, and easily accessible, will serve as a planning tool that local
governments can use to select the right mix of programs to meet their waste
diversion goals.
<P>
The board developed its response to the Governor's Executive Order on Regulatory
Improvement (W-127-95) by soliciting from the regulated community and all
other interested parties recommendations on where board regulations could
be further simplified, streamlined or even eliminated. The overwhelming response
was that the board had done so much in the past four years to address concerns
about its regulations that few areas of concern remained to be addressed.
Commentors pointed to the change in calculation of diversion achievement
from the point of generation to the point of disposal as well as the creation
of the tiered regulatory structure as some of the most significant and cost
effective reforms undertaken.
<P>
The board has submitted a plan of future regulatory and legislative efforts
to further streamline its processes and continue the dialogue with affected
parties to bring about even greater improvements during 1996. By spring of
1996, a series of regulatory actions will begin to eliminate any unnecessary
regulation that has not yet been acted upon. By summer, additional workshops
and actions will be announced to streamline processes in the areas of local
planning, solid waste facility management, used oil program administration,
waste tire management, and household hazardous waste program administration.
<H3>
  Protection of California's People and Resources
</H3>
<P>
While we have worked hard to expand markets for recycled materials and forge
a workable regulatory system, we have never swerved in our efforts to protect
California's environment and the health and safety of its citizens.
<P>
Where oversight is critical, our scope has been focused. Where action is
called for, our response has been forceful.
<P>
In just the past two years, the board, under the Solid Waste Disposal and
Codisposal Site Cleanup Program adopted in 1993, has identified and approved
funding for cleanup of 32 sites around the state. By the end of 1995, 20
of those sites had been remediated.
<P>
These are sites that the responsible party is unable or unwilling to remediate
or has abandoned and the owner cannot be found. Without our involvement,
cleanup of these sites would not occur&Ntilde;and the threats they pose would
continue to loom over nearby citizens and the environment. Instead, these
communities have benefited by the elimination of health and safety dangers
from sources such as soil contamination and pollution of surface waters.
<P>
We also made significant contributions last year to resolving the problem
of waste tire stockpiles in California, which often results in nuisance,
pollution or injury to the public health and safety. Through our Tire Recycling
Management Fund, we are providing resources to perform cleanup, abatement,
or remedial work at waste tire sites where responsible parties have failed
to take appropriate action. During 1995, we awarded more than $500,000 to
clean up eight waste tire stockpiles; all of which border residential areas.
<P>
A cornerstone of the state's enforcement program is the mission of the Local
Enforcement Agencies (LEA), who enforce solid waste laws and conduct landfill
inspections within their jurisdictions. The board has adopted a process for
evaluating the performance of the 57 LEAs around the state. In addition to
performance evaluation, we provide LEAs with additional tools to ensure they
are on track, including training, technical assistance, and financial assistance.
<P>
Our focus here remains twofold: to promote the highest caliber of LEA performance
and to maximize the effectiveness of our own role. For instance, while in
the past year we have been able to document areas most in need of improvement
where LEA performance is concerned, we have also found that we must work
harder to provide clear guidance on new and developing board policies which
affect the role and duties of LEAs.

Driven by a worthwhile mission; a staff devoted to a responsible, balanced
regulatory approach; and an alliance of public and private sector interests
committed to consensus, the Integrated Waste Management Board built a record
of success for 1995, and laid the groundwork for even greater achievements
in 1996 and beyond.

waste generated and disposed, and to ensure compliance with
environmental regulations. The Board also conducts a broad range

15 years in the private sector, directing governmental relations
for the national Rubber Manufacturers Association and
subsequently the national Motor and Equipment Manufacturers
Association. During his stint in Washington, D.C., Mr.Pennington

affecting sewage treatment plant effluent discharge. He also
provided governmental relations on Capitol Hill, representing
tire and rubber product interests in development of the National
Resource Recovery Act.<P>

This status report provides information for container and plate cullet. Section
II addresses the container cullet supply and demand factors, market development
barriers, and strategies to enhance container cullet recycling. Section III
addresses the market, barriers, and strategies to improve the market for
plate glass and other construction and demolition glass.

<B>II. <A NAME="Container">Container</A> Cullet </B>
<P>
The primary cullet market in California is the container market. The glass
container manufacturing industry is a mature industry that has gone through
continuous consolidation over the past 15 years. The consolidation has meant
that older, higher-cost plants were closed. New processes and equipment have
helped the glass container industry to compete with other packaging materials
but as the market share for glass containers has declined, the demand for
California cullet has also been reduced.
<P>
According to the Board's waste stream composition data, glass (food and beverage
container and plate) represents about 1.3 million tons (3.5 percent) of the
material disposed in California in 1991. The Department of Conservation (DOC)
has more recent information which indicates that about 620,000 tons of container
glass were collected in the state last year. DOC estimates a 73 percent recycling
rate for California Redemption Value (CRV) glass containers.
<P>
Most diversion of container glass occurs through the efforts of private recyclers
and local government curbside programs. Most of the glass collected in the
state is used by glass manufacturers to produce food and beverage containers.
The second largest market for cullet is fiberglass production.

<B><A NAME="CC:Definition">Definition</A> of Container Cullet </B>
<P>
The Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, Inc. (ISRI) has published
specifications and practices that apply to container glass cullet purchased
and sold in the United States and Canada. These cullet specifications are
divided into two categories: unprocessed and processed cullet.
<P>
Unprocessed container cullet is defined as broken or whole scrap glass.
Specifications for unprocessed culled are listed for flint (clear), amber
(brown), and green (emerald).
<P>
The specifications also describes the amount of cullet color segregation
allowed. For example, flint can contain 95 to 100 percent flint and 0 to
5 percent amber, green, and other colors.
<P>
Processed container cullet is defined as crushed and whole contaminant-free
scrap container glass which is furnace ready. The size of the cullet can
vary from whole glass containers to minus 100 mesh. The ideal material size
is 3/8 inch to 3/4 inch with a 10 percent minimum of fine particles. Material
size is based upon buyer and seller's agreement. The cullet cannot contain
ferrous and non ferrous metals, ceramics, or other glass (e.g., plate window,
heat-resistant, and lead-based glass). The specifications also describe the
amount of cullet color segregation allowed. For example, total non flint
cullet must contain less that 5 percent flint cullet.

<B><A NAME="CC:Supply">Supply</A> of Scrap Material </B>
<P>
Cullet is diverted from the waste stream through programs operated by local
jurisdictions, waste haulers, private recyclers, and community service
organizations. After the material is diverted by these programs, it flows
to processors' "glass beneficiation facilities" which crush, clean, and size
the cullet and sell it to glass container manufacturers and fiberglass producers.
<P>
Recent technology development, spearheaded by the Gallo Glass Company, allows
glass container manufacturers to use recycled glass contaminated by ceramics
and stones. In the past, the pieces would either become a weak spot in a
bottle or the pieces would sink to the bottom of the furnace and reflect
heat into the furnace wall. The result was often damage to tiles and expensive
repairs. When the pieces of stone or ceramic contaminants are pulverized
in the newer technology, they are melted with the cullet and become an integral
part of the new container. Recovery of contaminated cullet has been so successful
that landfilling of recycled glass is extremely rare. Firms that are on the
lookout for scrap glass for glasphalt or other applications will seldom find
enough scrap glass for their projects.
<P>
The Department of Conservation (DOC) reports that 620,732 tons of food and
beverage container glass were collected in California in fiscal year (FY)
1994-1995. This figure does not include plate or automotive glass. DOC reports
that buyback centers collected the largest amount of cullet in the state:
over 385,500 tons (62.1 percent). Curbside programs provided the next largest
amount of cullet, 192,427 tons (31.0 percent), while the remaining cullet,
42,830 tons (7.0 percent) moved into the system from drop-off, reverse vending
machine, and community service programs.
<P>
Estimates of the amount of plate and automotive cullet diverted from the
waste stream are not available.
<CENTER>

<P>
<B>Primary <A NAME="CC:Factors">Factors</A> Affecting Supply </B>
<P>
The primary factors affecting supply of cullet are:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Availability of glass food, drink, and beverage containers in the waste stream.
  <LI>
    Amount of California Redemption Value (CRV) deposit which will affect the
    number of CRV containers sold in California.
  <LI>
    Household / Business participation in glass recycling.
  <LI>
    Ability and motivation of local jurisdictions, waste haulers, and private
    recyclers to divert and recycle glass from the waste stream.
</UL>
<P>
Price is not a major issue at this time since cullet prices have been relatively
stable over the past couple of years. Certainly, though, if the price of
cullet were to increase substantially, additional supply would come available.
<CENTER>
  ____________________
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Projected Cullet <A NAME="CC:ProjSupply">Supply</A> </B>
<P>
The market share of products packaged in glass food and beverage containers
has been decreasing over the last several years. Glass container production
reports indicate that 1995 may represent the industry's lowest output in
over a decade. If this trend continues, less container glass will be available
in the waste stream to divert.
<P>
In California, the glass beneficiation industry as undergone a major
consolidation over the last year. Most of the volume of cullet is now controlled
by one company in the state. This consolidation may produce some processing
efficiencies in operation, however material prices could reflect the lack
of competition in the cullet markets. The price received by recyclers for
recycled glass could be reduced and the price end users pay may he higher.
<CENTER>
  ____________________
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><A NAME="CC:Demand">Demand</A> for California Cullet </B>
<P>
In California, cullet demand exceeds supply. According to DOC data, California
container and fiberglass producers used 740,000 tons of cullet in California
in 1994. The difference between the amount of cullet used and the amount
of cullet collected (119,593 tons) was made up from cullet imported into
the state and the use of recycled plate glass. The amounts of imported cullet
and plate glass used for container and fiberglass production is not known.
<P>
The demand for cullet in California is driven primarily by the production
rates of California's glass food and beverage container and fiberglass
manufacturing industries and the State's minimum content requirements for
food and beverage containers and fiberglass. AB 1340 (Statutes of 1991, Chapter
706, Eastin) requires fiberglass producers to use at least 30 percent
postconsumer cullet in fiberglass building insulation made or sold in California.
SB 1178 (Statutes of 1990, Chapter 1094, O'Connell) requires glass food,
drink, and beverage containers manufactured for sale in California to use
at least 35 percent postconsumer cullet.
<P>
Another factor affecting the demand for California container cullet by California
container manufacturers is the uncertainty of product manufacturers importing
empty glass containers into California and filling the containers with product.
If this occurs, fewer containers will be produced in California with the
consequent reduced use of cullet.
<P>
Construction uses of cullet has been sporadic. Glasphalt and roadbase projects
were undertaken when major earthquakes created significant plate glass at
low prices.
<P>
Construction use of recycled glass could provide an almost unlimited demand
for cullet that would far exceed supply. In California, as long as cullet
prices remain 6 to 10 times higher than sand and aggregate rock used in glasphalt
and roadbase, significant amounts of cullet will not find its way into roadbeds.
<P>
Higher-valued products such as glass tile, dishes, picture frames, or high
end bowls and other glassware, offer limited markets for cullet. However,
as these products represent only a small part of the dishware and decorative
market, only a few tons of cullet per year will be used.
<CENTER>
  ____________________
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Projected <A NAME="CC:ProjDemand">Demand</A> for Cullet </B>
<P>
Assuming that the minimum-content requirements for containers and fiberglass
will not be changed in the next two to three years, the production rates
of glass food and beverage container and the fiberglass industry will continue
to have the major influence on the demand for California container cullet.
<P>
The industry consolidation has reduced the number of glass plants in California
and some of the remaining glass plants have parent company ownership from
Mexico (Anchor &amp; Latchford) and France (Ball Incon &amp; Foster
Forbes-American/National). New plants have opened in Mexico and will represent
new competition for glass bottle sales in the California glass manufacturing
industry.
<P>
The national projected growth rates (production) of glass containers for
the next couple of years is thought to be flat or declining. California will
more than likely follow the national trend. If this is the case, the demand
for cullet could remain relatively flat or lessen.
<P>
Projected fiberglass production rates will also affect cullet use. Nationally,
fiberglass production was off in 1995 due to slow construction starts.
Nationally, fiberglass production in 1996 is not expected to be a banner
year either. If housing starts increase (partly determined by interest rates),
fiberglass production could increase. Also, the extent to which California
fiberglass producers export their product overseas is unknown, but may have
a positive impact on cullet use.

<P>
<B>Primary <A NAME="CC:Barriers">Barriers</A> to Material Supply/Demand </B>
<P>
<B> Glass Beneficiation Industry </B>
<P>
Quality concerns are one of the primary barriers to increasing the amount
of glass beneficiated in California.
<P>
Glass beneficiators had seen an improvement in the quality of cullet received
from recyclers and processors as the glass recycling infrastructure was being
built. Further improvements in the quality of cullet have not been made in
the last couple of years. Glass received by beneficiation facilities may,
in fact, be getting dirtier. Some experts attribute the degradation of cullet
to the emergence of dirty material recovery facilities (MRFs).
<P>
Glass beneficiation facilities are continuing to have problems with contaminants
in cullet. Refractory material, such as ceramics, stone, brick, asphalt,
stucco, and heat resistant material (e.g., ovenware), continue to be found
in the feedstock brought to beneficiation facilities. The technology used
by Gallo will, generally speaking, allow more contamination in cullet. However,
this technology has limits on the amount of contamination it can tolerate,
and requires more energy to process cullet than conventional beneficiation
facilities.
<P>
Glass beneficiation facilities are caught between a feedstock that is becoming
dirtier and more stringent standards required by glass container and fiberglass
manufacturers. In an effort to control maintenance and production equipment
costs, glass container and fiberglass manufacturers are requiring cleaner
cullet. (Contaminated cullet reduces the life expectancy and increases the
operating costs of glass container and fiberglass production equipment).
<P>
Medical waste continues to invade cullet received by beneficiation facilities.
Medical waste in the form of syringes, glass vials, and pharmaceutical glass
pose very serious problems for beneficiators. For example, vials and tubes
containing fluid are broken during processing and their contents may infect
or injure workers. Medical waste cannot be tolerated in container cullet.
Beneficiators are now rejecting loads of glass that contain <I>any</I> medical
waste.
<P>
<B> Glass Container Manufacturing Industry </B>
<P>
The relatively high price of cullet in California, the trend away from
color-separating glass, and the fact that many glass container manufacturers
also make other kinds of containers are the major barriers to expansion of
cullet use in California.
<P>
The glass container manufacturing industry maintains that in California the
cost of cullet to container manufacturers is higher than in 47 other states.
In those states, the cost of using cullet approximates the cost of using
virgin (batch) materials. Whereas in California cullet is more expensive
than virgin materials. With a decreasing container market share, California
container manufacturers are hard pressed to pass along any increase in production
costs (higher cullet prices) to their customers. The container manufacturing
industry ascribes the higher cost of cullet to the processing fee (AB 2020).
<P>
California container manufacturers used 600,000 to 700,000 tons of cullet
in 1995. If the price of cullet approximated the cost of cullet in other
states, the glass container industry asserts that California container producers
could double the amount of cullet used.
<P>
<I><B> Color Separation </B> </I>
<P>
Less glass is being color separated by recyclers and consequently less color
separated material is available to container manufactures. The trend in glass
recycling is to mix brown, green, and clear glass food, drink, and beverage
containers, producing what the industry calls three-color mix. About twice
as much three-color mix is collected today compared to two years ago. The
increase in three-color mix may be the combined result of:
<UL>
  <LI>
    The fiberglass industry's increased demand for three-color.
  <LI>
    The operation of more dirty MRFs by jurisdictions.
  <LI>
    The increase in demand for three-color by one large vertically integrated
    wine producer.
  <LI>
    The State's AB 2020 monetary incentive for recyclers to focus on cullet volume
    rather than cullet quality.
</UL>
<P>
<I><B> Horizontal Integration </B></I>
<P>
Most all of the California glass container manufacturers are horizontally
integrated, producing plastic and metal containers as well. Because they
have the flexibility to produce non glass containers, the "glass industry"
may not be as inclined to promote the use of glass containers, knowing that
any glass market share loss will be gained by the other container types they
also produce.
<P>
<B> Fiberglass Manufacturing Industry </B>
<P>
The scrap glass that has ceramic or stone contamination cannot be used by
the fiberglass industry even if the glass is pulverized. Their smaller furnaces
cannot sufficiently melt all of the contaminants. To manufacture fiberglass,
molten glass is spun to form glass fibers. The design of the fiberglass plant's
spinning operation cannot tolerate even very small contaminants.

<B><A NAME="CC:Strategies">Strategies</A> to Overcome Barriers </B>
<P>
<B> Glass Beneficiation Industry </B>
<P>
One possible means to overcome the quality barriers affecting the glass
beneficiation industry (which in turn affects the ability of the glass container
and fiberglass manufacturing industry to use more glass) is for the Board,
working with the local jurisdictions, to undertake a public education program
to educate/remind recyclers, haulers, and jurisdictions that they share in
the responsibility to provide as clean a product to beneficiators as economically
possible.
<P>
Another way to boost the supply of cullet is to increase the number of households
participating in glass recycling in California. This could be accomplished
through additional education efforts by jurisdictions and the Board aimed
at providing more information to households on the benefits of glass recycling.
<P>
<B> Glass Container Manufacturing Industry </B>
<P>
The container manufacturing industry in California maintains that the higher
price of cullet vis-&agrave;-vis other states and the trend to three-color
mix are by-and-large a product of AB 2020.
<P>
The Board should consider two actions to assist DOC in collecting more glass:
<OL>
  <LI>
    The Board could support DOC to expand the number and type of glass containers
    included under the deposit program. This could increase the quantity of glass
    containers diverted from landfills.
  <LI>
    The Board could assist DOC to educate the public on the philosophy and rationale
    for the glass processing fee that is ultimately paid for by glass container
    manufacturers in the state. The philosophy is that each of the four material
    types (glass, plastic, aluminum, and bi-metal) should be recycled based on
    the "market economics" of each material. For example, recyclers should not
    have to depend on making enough money on aluminum recycling to subsidize
    glass recycling. The processing fee helps insure that the market for glass
    recycling in California is viable and that glass recyclers do not lose money
    recycling glass containers in California.
</OL>
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B> III. <A NAME="Plate">Plate</A> Glass </B>
<P>
Plate glass cullet is being used as feedstock in fiberglass manufacture and
plate glass manufacture itself. Using plate glass cullet requires less energy
than using virgin materials. Unlike other recyclable commodities, limited
data is available for plate glass cullet.
<P>
Plate glass includes all types of glass produced in a flat form. Technically,
according to the Glass Association of North America, "float glass" is the
correct term since "plate glass" refers to a specific glass process. Most
plate glass is used for windows in buildings and automobiles.
<P>
Staff did not find any data on the amount of scrap plate glass generated
in California. The source reduction and recycling elements (SRRE) submitted
by local jurisdictions cover generation amounts of scrap container glasses
and other nonrecyclable glass but do not specifically categorize scrap plate
or automotive glass.
<CENTER>
  ____________________
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><A NAME="PG:Supply">Supply</A> of Plate Glass Cullet </B>
<P>
There is no data available to estimate the available supply of scrap plate
glass. Industry experts indicate demand for plate glass scrap will grow by
3-4 percent during 1996. This demand should be sufficient to make use of
available supply.
<P>
Listed below are the primary factors that affect plate glass cullet supply.
<P>
<I> <I><B> Economy (Housing).</B></I> </I> Supply of cullet depends largely
on the amount of plate glass being processed or fabricated as windows or
other glass panels for buildings.
<P>
<I><B> Collection.</B></I> The collection system also plays a big role on
how much of the scrap plate glass goes to beneficiation facilities. Beneficiation
facilities usually provide dumpsters to plate glass fabricators for their
discarded plate glass.
<P>
<I><B> Transportation. </B></I> Glass beneficiation facilities may not find
it economically feasible to collect scrap plate glass from distant generators
because of transportation costs. Except for possibly window manufacturers,
large generators of scrap plate glass do not exist so feasible volumes must
be collected from many small generators.
<P>
<I><B> Quality (Equipment). </B></I> Because of the stringent quality
requirements of users of plate glass cullet, the availability of the equipment
to process the scrap plate glass to produce a good quality cullet is an important
factor that will affect cullet supply. Depending on the degree of contamination
(e.g., ceramics, glass other than plate), a beneficiation facility may not
accept contaminated scrap plate glass, resulting in the disposal of what
could have been an addition to the processed cullet supply inventory available
for plate glass manufacturing.
<CENTER>
  ____________________
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><A NAME="PG:Demand">Demand</A> for California Plate Glass Cullet </B>
<P>
Plate glass cullet demand is strongly dependent on the demand for plate glass
and fiberglass insulation. Factors affecting demand for plate glass are housing
starts (which depends largely on interest rates) and automobile sales. Increased
construction activities result in a higher demand for plate glass and fiberglass
insulation materials. With an increase in housing, manufacturers will need
more cullet as feedstock for their plate glass or fiberglass manufacturing
processes.
<P>
Demand for plate glass is predicted to be up 3-4 percent during 1996 due
to a projected increase in housing starts. Nonresidential construction will
also contribute to the projected flat glass demand increase. Automotive glass
is also expected to have a healthy growth. (<I>Glass Industry</I>, Vol. 77,
No.1, Jan. 1996).

<P>
<B>Primary <A NAME="PG:Barriers">Barriers</A> to Material Supply/Demand </B>
<P>
Although fiberglass manufacturing facilities would prefer using plate glass
cullet rather than container glass cullet, the availability of plate glass
cullet is inconsistent and maintaining an inventory will increase price.
Although the quality of the plate glass cullet is better than container glass
cullet, fiberglass facilities are still concerned with the amount of dust
present on delivered glass cullet (plate and container).
<P>
Processed cullet deliveries are sometimes rejected by manufacturers because
of contamination. This makes the beneficiation facilities very selective
and strict on accepting plate glass for processing. Generators must therefore
be careful to eliminate contaminants as they collect plate glass.
<P>
Transportation costs are often a barrier to supply and demand of plate glass
cullet. The distance between beneficiation facilities that process plate
cullet and end users affect transportation costs and therefore the price
of the material.
<CENTER>
  ____________________

<P>
<B><A NAME="PG:Strategies">Strategies</A> to Overcome Barriers </B>
<P>
The barriers mentioned above are all industry-dependent. The Board should
develop and disseminate information on practices which avoid contamination
of the scrap plate glass for processing. Once these practices are identified,
case studies can be prepared and disseminated to the glass fabrication industry.
<P>
Since most of the scrap plate glass comes from window fabricators, other
potential sources need to be tapped. Staff should investigate the feasibility
of collecting plate glass from demolition sites.

The ferrous scrap market is an old and well-established market operating
on a world-wide scale. On an annual tonnage basis, more ferrous scrap is
recycled than all other secondary materials combined. The market for municipal
ferrous scrap operates as a part of the larger market for industrial ferrous
scrap.
<P>
By weight, ferrous metals are the largest category of metals in the municipal
waste stream. The largest quantities of ferrous metals are found in durable
goods such as appliances, furniture, tires, and other miscellaneous durables,
and in steel cans. Steel cans are defined as steel food, paint, and aerosol
containers, including steel cans which have been "tinned" (i.e., "tin cans").
<P>
According to the Board's waste stream composition data, the category "ferrous
metal and steel cans" incorporates all ferrous metal except the category
"white goods". Ferrous metal and steel cans represented about 3.5 percent
of the material disposed in California in 1991, or 1.3 million tons annually.
This roughly equals the total amount of glass disposed in the state that
year. Because data on steel cans are aggregated with that for other ferrous
material, an estimate of the tons of cans disposed in California is not possible.
The Steel Recycling Institute estimates that 1.55 million tons of cans were
recycled in the U.S. in 1994. Roughly speaking, if California accounts for
about 13 percent of the total U.S. population, and steel can recycling is
in some fashion related to population, then California recycled an estimated
202,000 tons of steel cans in 1994.
<P>
Most steel cans are diverted through the efforts of jurisdictions operating
curbside programs. About 400 programs in California include steel cans in
their collection programs. Most of the collected steel cans in California
are used by steel manufacturers to produce steel and by the copper industry
to increase the quantity of copper extracted from ore at their mines.
<P>
In 1991, approximately 3.38 million major household appliances (268,000 tons)
and 301,500 tons of other metallic discards (e.g., wood-burning stoves, metal
furniture) were discarded. Appliances and other metallic discards (not including
vehicles) constitute approximately 1 percent of the solid waste generated
each year in California. The published recycling rate estimates for household
appliances (refrigerators, freezers, stoves, etc.) is approximately 71 percent.
<P>
In 1994, approximately 20 million vehicles (12 million tons) were discarded
in California. Vehicles are estimated to be recycled at rates exceeding 95
percent. This estimate does not include motorcycles, scooters, and bicycles,
which are believed to be recycled at much lower levels. The recycling rate
for vehicles is higher than for appliances because of the amount of scrap
metal in each vehicle and the relatively well-established system for recycling
vehicles.
<P>
The market for California's ferrous is principally the Pacific Rim. The demand
in California itself is limited because there is only one steel mill in the
state. Future California ferrous scrap metal demand will depend on the current
ferrous metals market which is old and well established and operates on a
world-wide scale.
<P>
This status report addresses the steel can supply and demand factors, market
development barriers, and strategies to enhance steel can recycling; and
the market, barriers, and strategies to improve the market for metallic discards
and other construction and demolition ferrous.

<P>
The Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, Inc. (ISRI) has published
specifications and practices that apply to steel can scrap purchased and
sold in the United States and Canada. The specification for can scrap is
defined as: "Steel can scrap compressed to charging box size and weighing
no less than 75 pounds per cubic foot. Cans may be baled without removal
of paper labels, but free of other non metallic. The bundle may include up
to 5- gallon tin-coated containers."
<P>
"Major appliance" means any domestic or commercial device; including, but
not limited to, a washing machine, clothes dryer, water heater, dehumidifier,
conventional oven, microwave oven, stove, refrigerator, freezer, air-conditioner,
trash compactor, or residential furnace.
<P>
"White goods" means any household appliance that once was traditionally white
in color; including, but not limited to, a refrigerator, stove, washing machine,
freezer, clothes dryer, or water heater.

"Metallic discards" means any large metal article or product, or any part
thereof; including, but not limited to, metal furniture, machinery, major
appliances, electronic products, and wood burning stoves.

<B>II. &nbsp;Supply of Steel <A NAME="Can">Can</A> Scrap </B>
<P>
<B> <A NAME="Can:Supply">Supply</A> </B>
<P>
Steel cans are primarily diverted from the waste stream through curbside
programs operated by local jurisdictions. Some cans are also diverted from
commercial and institutional accounts by waste haulers and recyclers. In
California, the diverted material flows to a processor, known as a detinner,
where the can scrap is shredded and the tin is removed. The shredded detinned
material is then sold to steel producers and copper mines throughout the
West.
<P>
The primary factors affecting supply of steel cans include:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Number of steel cans sold in the state.
  <LI>
    Number of curbside programs collecting steel cans.
  <LI>
    Consumer awareness of recyclability of steel cans.
  <LI>
    Willingness of recyclers to service commercial and institutional scrap steel
    can generators.
  <LI>
    Participation of commercial and institutional generators and the haulers
    serving them.
</UL>
<P>
Future supply of steel cans will be affected by the highly competitive market
for packaging containers. In California the steel can has lost most of the
beverage can market to aluminum. As the price of aluminum increases, there
is some interest in beverage product manufacturers switching to steel cans.
If this occurs, more steel cans will be available for recycling.
<CENTER>

<P>
<B> <A NAME="Can:Demand">Demand</A> For Steel Can Scrap </B>
<P>
The demand for steel cans in California arises from western copper and steel
production, and to some extent, iron foundries. This demand is affected by
production rates of copper ore, U.S. steel production, and the global market
for ferrous scrap.
<P>
Future demand for steel cans will largely depend on the worldwide demand
for copper and steel. The demand for copper and steel is, in turn, largely
dependent on the growth rate of the western, U.S., and global economies.
As the economies expand, more copper and steel is used in the industrial,
transportation, and construction sectors.

<B> Primary <A NAME="Can:Barriers">Barriers</A> To Steel Can Recycling </B>
<P>
The primary barriers to steel can recycling are:
<P>
Lack of sufficient collection systems for food service and institutional
recycling of steel containers.
<P>
Steel drums, pails, propane canisters, and aerosol paint cans are considered
"problem containers." As a result, there is a lack of sufficient awareness
of and participation in the recycling of these containers. Regulatory agencies
continue to spread misinformation which creates a perception that regulatory
obstacles exist to recycle these ferrous containers. In reality, regulations
have become more permissive and supportive for recycling.

<B> <A NAME="Can:Strategies">Strategies</A> for Steel Can Recycling </B>
<P>
The staff proposed strategies to increase steel can recycling are:
<P>
The Board should partner with such private sector organizations as the Steel
Recycling Institute in an outreach program to encourage business and haulers
to collect steel cans from commercial and institutional accounts. The outreach
should target the largest sources of steel cans, such as schools, hospitals,
and restaurants. Outreach methods might include fact sheets, workshops, and
the Board's web page internet site.
<P>
The Board, working with the steel recycling industry, should create opportunities
to educate the public on the recyclability of "problem containers". The Board,
with industry, should hold workshops, publish reports, research papers, and
fact sheets to educate the public to help eliminate the information barrier.
This outreach should target the largest generators of these containers.

<B>III. &nbsp;<A NAME="Metallic">Metallic</A> Discards </B>
<P>
<B> Primary <A NAME="Met:Barriers">Barriers</A> to Metallic Discards Recycling
</B>
<P>
Staff has identified the following six barriers to metallic discard recycling.
<P>
Transportation costs in rural areas may hamper metallic discards recycling.
The cost to transport metallic discards in rural areas are higher than in
metropolitan areas, and may exceedthe price paid for the recyclable metals
themselves.
<P>
Energy conservation appliance rebate/pickup programs have been phased out
or are being phased out because of the high program costs. In part, this
is because the supply of old appliances available for recycling may not be
sufficiently high to warrant the investment and cost of operating an appliance
recycling program.
<P>
The costs to the public to have old appliances recycled is approximately
$20 to $40 per unit. It may not seem worthwhile to the average consumer to
pay to have their appliances recycled. Many retail stores do not take back
old appliances when a new one is delivered.
<P>
Additional costs may discourage people from considering recycling. Some
appliances contain hazardous waste components, PCBs, oils, CFCs, which require
special removal before the appliances are recycled and/or disposed. This
adds to the costs and liability of appliance recycling.
<P>
There are few incentives to prompt recycling rather than disposal of old
appliances. Unlike other states, California has no absolute mandatory landfill
ban on metallic discards. Landfill operators can dump metallic discards if
it is not economically feasible to recycle them.
<P>
In rural cities and counties, local enforcement agencies don't have the resources
to enforce illegal disposal of appliances. As a result, many appliances are
being disposed in ditches, fields, and rivers rather than being taken to
a facility for recycling.
<CENTER>
  ____________________
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<B> <A NAME="Met:Strategies">Strategies</A> for Metallic Discards Recycling
</B>
<P>
Staff proposed strategies to overcome the barriers identified above are:
<P>
Sponsor a legislative ban on all metallic discards from being landfilled
and requiring landfill operators to set the metallic discards aside for
recycling. This would increase the supply of appliances available for recycling.
Landfill operators may have to raise their fees for accepting old appliances
to cover added costs for processing prior to transporting to a metal recycling
facility.
<P>
Sponsor legislation requiring retail stores selling appliances to collect
an "Advance Disposal Fee." This would provide a funding source and create
an infrastructure to collect and process the old appliance for recycling
rather than disposal. Some funds from the fee could be allocated to increased
enforcement of illegal dumping laws.
<P>
Promote development of an efficient metallic discards diversion infrastructure
involving State agencies, local jurisdictions, and businesses. These entities
would work together to decide how to collect, process and recycle old appliances.
For example, recycling and reuse centers could be established to fix old
appliances and sell them at a lower than retail price at reuse warehouses.
Another example is to have the municipal sanitation department designate
appliance pickup days at certain intervals during the year. This would decrease
illegal appliance disposal.

<P>
This paper addresses <I>postconsumer</I> recovered paper only, because it
is postconsumer paper that is most prevalent in California's landfills and
which faces the greatest barriers to increasing recovery and recycling. By
contrast, there are few barriers to recovering and recycling preconsumer
paper (such as converting scrap), and demand is strong-and always has been-for
such paper.
<P>
The paper addresses four major "grades" of postconsumer recovered paper:
old corrugated containers, office papers (computer printout, white ledger,
and sorted office paper), mixed paper, and old newspapers. The definitions
for these paper grades are as follows: <BR>
<P>
<B>Old Corrugated Containers (OCC)</B>
<P>
Used cardboard boxes.<BR>
<P>
<B>Office Papers</B>
<P>
<I><B>Computer Printout (CPO).</B></I><B> </B>White, groundwood-free papers
used for printing computer-generated data. Typically are continuous, serrated
papers, with "tractor feed" strips on side. Have superior strength and printing
surface to ledger papers.
<P>
<I><B>White Ledger (WL).</B></I><B> </B>White, groundwood-free printing and
writing papers such as copier paper, laser printer paper, white lined tablet
paper, and stationary.
<P>
<I><B>Sorted Office Paper (SOP).</B></I> A <I>selective</I> mixture of papers
typically generated in offices, comprised primarily of white ledger but including
colored ledger, carbonless forms, envelopes, and groundwood-free coated paper.
(Note: The term "sorted" is based on the fact that the acceptable mixture
of papers must still be sorted from non-acceptable papers such as boxboard,
cardboard, newspapers, magazines, and catalogs.)<BR>
<P>
<B>Mixed Paper </B>
<P>
An extremely broad mixture of papers, with few unacceptable paper types.
Includes virtually all types of paper generated in offices, and a large
percentage of papers generated in homes. Unacceptable paper types typically
include plastic-coated papers such as frozen food packages and paper
towels/tissue. <BR>
<P>
<B>Old Newspaper (ONP)</B>
<P>
Newspapers and other uncoated, unbound groundwood papers such as advertising
fliers, election guides, and tax forms.

<P>
Some types of plastic containers are being recycled in significant amounts.
For example, over 70 percent of PET soda bottles are recycled in California,
and 25 percent of HDPE milk jugs are recycled nationally. However, the overall
recycling rate for plastics, which includes a variety of plastic resins used
in containers, packaging, and durable goods, is small.
<P>
Specifically, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)
estimates that 19.3 million tons of plastic waste were generated in the U.S.
in 1993. Of that amount, only 0.7 million tons were diverted from disposal,
only 3.5 percent of the amount generated. In comparison, the recycling rate
for paper was 34 percent, for glass, 22 percent, and for aluminum, 26 percent.
The remainder of the plastic waste, 18.6 million tons, was disposed (see
Table 1).<BR>

The California Integrated Waste Management Board (Board) has also collected
data on the amount of plastic waste generated, diverted, and disposed in
California. Cities and counties collected the data through waste characterization
studies conducted in 1990. The results of the California study are similar
to the U.S. EPA findings in regard to the overall recycling rate for plastics.
Specifically, California reported a plastic waste diversion rate of 2.9 percent
in 1990 (see Table 2). Both the Board and U.S. EPA estimates are indicative
of the low diversion level for plastics in general.<BR>

World production of plastics is projected to increase by almost 4 percent
annually to 152 million tons by the year 2000 (<I>Modern Plastics, Encyclopedia
'96</I>). Polyethylene production is projected to increase by 3.9 percent
annually to more than 46 million tons. Polypropylene production is projected
to increase by 5.5 percent annually to more than 23 million tons. In addition,
polyvinyl chloride is projected to increase by 3.7 percent annually to nearly
26 million tons.

<I> Modern Plastics </I> also reports that the amount of postconsumer resins
(PCRs) produced in the U.S. increased from 0.7 million tons in 1993 to 0.9
million tons in 1994; this is a 22 percent increase. Most of the PCRs were
derived from PET and HDPE bottles; 0.5 million tons in 1994. Over 15,000
communities have collection programs (curbside, drop-off and buy back)
nationally, and over 1,300 companies are involved with the PCR business.

<P>
The California Integrated Waste Management Board provides assistance to both
local government and private businesses for implementing recycling programs
through a variety of sections within the Waste Prevention and Market Development
Division. These sections include the Recycling Business Assistance Team (R-Team),
the Market Analysis and Services Section, and the Buy Recycled Section. In
addition, the Board has prepared the<I> Directory of Plastics Brokers and
Reprocessors</I> to link suppliers and buyers of postconsumer plastics.
<P>
The American Plastics Council has undertaken a number of efforts to increase
the supply of PCRs. These include funding of an automated optical plastic
container sorting facility in Lane County, Oregon; a guidebook and companion
video on how to begin curbside collection programs; and a "state of the art"
durable goods recycling research center in Berkeley, California.
<P>
Major computer manufacturers, such as Hewlett-Packard (HP) and IBM, have
begun recycling programs for their hardware as well as other companies' machines.
The computers are disassembled and plastic and metal components are separated
for recycling. In addition, HP and Apple currently incorporate 25 percent
PCR in their computer housings. HP is also designing future generations of
its hardware with recycling in mind by eliminating, wherever possible, components
which cannot be recycled. For example, some gears, manufactured with bonded
metal and plastic, are impossible to recycle. In future models, such non
recyclable items will be replaced with single-material recyclable ones.
<P>
To promote the recovery of plastics from auto bodies, Chrysler, Ford, and
General Motors have formed the Vehicle Recycling Partnership to examine methods
for recycling plastic from scrap autos. Manufacturers are developing a hand-held
automatic, plastic identification device utilizing infrared sensors to identify
resin types. They are also looking to improve the recyclability of components,
make them easier to disassemble, and use fewer resin types. Some examples
of auto parts currently incorporating PCRs are bumpers, instrument panels,
door panels, and seat foam. In addition, the Du Pont Corporation has developed
a prototype "green seat" which uses only one resin for the seat cushion,
upholstery, seat structures, and frame. Such designs reduce disassembly costs,
thereby making recycling economically feasible.

Worldwide consumption of plastics is expected to increase by 3.8 percent
per year to over 148 million tons by the year 2000 (<I>Modern Plastics,
Encyclopedia '96</I>). More specifically, <I>Modern Plastics</I> projects
consumption in the U.S. to increase at an annual rate of 3.3 percent to 43
million tons by the year 2000. Over the same time period, consumption in
Western Europe is also projected to increase at an annual rate of 3.3 percent
to 42 million tons; consumption in Asia is projected to increase at an annual
rate of 5.2 percent to 40 million tons. A strong global and domestic economy
should maintain anticipated increases in demand for plastic products. Strong
demand for virgin resins should keep prices up and thus provide suppliers
of postconsumer resins with a cost advantage over virgin.

<P>
<B> Efforts to <A NAME="Increase">Increase</A> Demand for Postconsumer Plastics
</B>
<P>
Since 1990, several market development initiatives have been implemented
by both the public and private sectors to increase plastics recycling. These
initiatives have not resulted in a dramatic increase in the overall recycling
rate for plastics, but they have demonstrated that plastics recycling is
economically feasible and have helped to boost public awareness that plastics
can be recycled. As a result, the outlook for postconsumer plastics markets
is more optimistic. A synopsis of selected market development efforts in
plastics recycling is included below.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> California Integrated Waste Management Board </I></B>
<P>
The Board has implemented several programs to develop markets for PCRs and/or
establish new or expanded businesses involved with plastics recycling. These
programs are based upon two minimum content laws enacted by the Legislature
requiring specified products to contain a minimum amount of postconsumer
material. One program seeks to increase demand for postconsumer materials
by specifying that plastic trash bags of 1.0 mil (0.0254 mm) or greater thickness
must contain at least 10 percent postconsumer plastic. In 1995, the minimum
content requirement applied to all plastic trash bags of 0.75 mil or greater
thickness, which must contain at least 30 percent postconsumer material.
<P>
The other law to increase demand for postconsumer plastics is the Rigid Plastic
Packaging Container (RPPC) Program. The RPPC Act requires that specified
plastic containers be either source-reduced by 10 percent, contain 25 percent
postconsumer resin, be reusable or refillable, or meet specified recycling
rates.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Other State Programs </I></B>
<P>
The California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act (AB
2020) established a beverage container recycling goal of 80 percent. The
purpose of the law is to increase the supply of used beverage containers
including plastic. The annual recycling rate for PET beverage containers
is shown in Table 3.

The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), in partnership with the National Recycling
Coalition Recycling Advisory Council, the Clean Washington Center, the New
York State Office of Recycling Market Development, and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, has developed a system that links buyers and sellers of
postconsumer materials on an electronic cash exchange. By providing an electronic
bulletin board for trading secondary materials, the CBOT provides buyers
and sellers access to more markets, better product quality, and more reliable
price information. The CBOT began operating the electronic bulletin board
for PET and HDPE in the fall of 1995.

<B>IV. &nbsp;Market <A NAME="Barriers">Barriers</A> to Postconsumer Plastic
Recycling </B>
<P>
Based on supply and demand forecasts discussed earlier, increases in virgin
resin production capacity will keep ahead of, or at least keep pace with,
increases in demand for plastic resins. Therefore, barring any unforeseen
events, such as factory upsets or sporadic export markets, prices for virgin
resin should not experience any wide price variations. However, in order
for postconsumer resins to maintain or expand their current market share,
advances in collection, sorting, and processing techniques will be necessary
in order to maintain or increase price competitiveness with virgin resin.
<P>
Maintaining price advantage over virgin resins is important because, in general,
businesses use PCRs only when they represent a price advantage over virgin.
<P>
In general, plastic industry representatives believe that fabricators of
plastic products would use a significant amount of postconsumer resins if
the prices were at least 20 percent lower than that of the competing virgin
resin.
<CENTER>
  ____________________<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>High <A NAME="Cost">Cost</A> of Collection, Sorting, and Cleaning </B>
<P>
One of the elements adding to the cost of PCRs is the labor-intensive process
of collecting, sorting, and cleaning plastics recovered through curbside
or drop-off programs. Since plastics have a high volume-to-weight ratio,
the cost of collecting plastics is higher than for other residential waste
types. Once delivered to a recycling center or material recovery facility,
the plastics are generally manually sorted, although automation will be the
trend of the future.
<P>
Typical costs for postconsumer plastic handling and processing are shown
in Table 4.

<P>
These costs may result in postconsumer resin prices that are only marginally
less than virgin resin prices. However, in the past, unexpected supply shortages
have increased the prices for virgin resins, making the PCRs more
price-competitive. In addition, automated sorting systems, using
computer-controlled vision, infrared and x-ray resin identification, and
color and optical density identification technologies offer the possibility
of reducing sorting costs.<SUP> </SUP> However, this technology is still
in the developmental stage and is expensive. To help address the issue of
collection costs, the Board has developed a computer cost model for local
government and the private sector to evaluate collection/processing cost.
The model allows the user to evaluate costs based on a variety of parameters
which affect the operating cost of a collection program.
<P>
In addition, the Board is working on a computer database (which should be
available by early 1997) detailing "yield factors," which will allow local
governments and businesses to assess how much material is available for
collection from different types of industries. Furthermore, in the near future
the Board may also consider legislation to revise the plastics coding system
to improve sorting efficiency.

<B>Lack of Long-Term Market <A NAME="Planning">Planning</A> </B>

Currently, prices for PCRs closely follow prices for virgin resins. Long-term
contracts at guaranteed prices would help smooth short-term price variations
for PCRs and help to build more stable markets for PCRs.

<P>
<B><A NAME="Contamination">Contamination</A> of Postconsumer Plastic </B>
<P>
<B><I> Public Health Concerns </I></B>
<P>
Since plastics are often collected from residential and commercial mixed
waste sources, the plastic can become contaminated with hazardous chemicals
and/or pathogens from other waste.
<P>
Recognizing this health risk, the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
has issued guidelines for the use of recycled plastic in food containers
and packaging. These guidelines only pertain to chemical contaminants in
mechanically reprocessed postconsumer plastic. The general regulations state
that packaging material contacting food "shall be of a purity suitable for
its intended use." Therefore, it is incumbent upon the manufacturer to
demonstrate that the container or packaging meets FDA guidelines.
<P>
However, with sufficient substantiation by the container manufacturer, the
FDA may issue a "Letter of Non-Objection" for the use of PCR in a container
or package. For example, Johnson Control, Inc. recently announced Federal
Food and Drug Administration approval for its proprietary process for cleaning
PET bottles for food contact applications. PCRs are currently being used
in food contact applications in soda bottles, containers for fruits and
vegetables, and egg cartons. However, despite FDA non-objection, the container
and product manufacturer assumes all liability for the safety of the packaging.
<P>
<B><I> Incompatible Resin Types </I></B>
<P>
In addition to contamination issues relating to public health impacts, product
and container manufacturers are sensitive to problems associated with mixed
resin types. Different resins have different molecular structures and hence
dissimilar physical properties, such as melting point, impact resistance,
elasticity, and strength. Thus, it is critical that PCRs be as homogeneous
as possible to minimize the problems associated with packaging quality. If
resin types become mixed during reprocessing, manufacturing equipment can
become damaged and the recycled plastic is not usable for new products.
<CENTER>
  ____________________<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Perception">Perception</A> of Recycled-Content Products as Inferior
</B>
<P>
Another market barrier to increased plastic recycling is the lack of knowledge
on the part of the public and businesses about plastics recycling in general.
People may perceive products manufactured with recycled content as inferior
because they believe that recycled content products are not as durable or
as reliable as products made from virgin materials.
<P>
On the manufacturing side, some product designers prefer to use virgin resin
with well-known physical properties, and are hesitant to use PCRs because
of supply and quality concerns. However, many reprocessors have proven that
they are able to meet supply and quality specifications.
<CENTER>
  ____________________<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Uncertainty">Uncertainty</A> About What is Recyclable </B>
<P>
The general public is not familiar with the industry resin coding system
and is not sure what plastics are being collected locally for recycling.
This lack of knowledge can lead to increased contamination since resins types
not targeted for collection may be included in the curbside and drop-off
bin. In addition, many commercial and retail businesses which have homogenous
and clean sources of postconsumer plastic are unaware of the value these
materials have and the savings they can realize by reducing their disposal
costs.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B>V. &nbsp;<A NAME="Strategies">Strategies</A> to Overcome Market Barriers
</B>
<P>
To increase the amount of plastics diverted from disposal the Board should
encourage the use of postconsumer plastic in durable plastic products by
increasing industry awareness regarding the supply and quality of postconsumer
plastic, and by providing information about design for recycling.
<P>
To accomplish this goal the Board should implement the following
strategies:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Conduct workshops targeting postconsumer plastic reprocessors and durable
    goods manufacturers to promote minimum recycled content and design for
    recycling.<BR>
  <LI>
    Conduct public information and education campaign to promote buying recycled
    or purchasing of recycled products.<BR>
  <LI>
    Target Board Recycling Market Development Zone loan funds to support
    establishment of reprocessors and recycled content product manufacturers.<BR>
  <LI>
    In addition, the Board should assist business compliance with the Rigid Plastic
    Packaging Container Program and the Minimum-Content Trashbag Program.<BR>
  <LI>
    Annually calculate the all-container and PETE recycling rates for plastic
    packaging containers and, if necessary, expand compliance of the program
    requirements.<BR>
  <LI>
    Continue to certify plastic trashbag manufacturers' compliance with the program.

<B>VI. &nbsp;<A NAME="Summary">Summary</A> </B>
<P>
The amount of plastic used in automobiles, electronics and other durable
goods and in containers and packaging continues to increase. Sales of virgin
plastic resins in the United States in 1994 totaled 78 billion pounds a 10
percent increase over 1993. This increase in the demand for plastics reflects
not only an increase in the gross amount of products being manufactured but
also in the plastic content of those products. In addition, the proportion
of plastic in the waste stream will continue to grow both in real and relative
terms. In relative terms, the percentage of plastic in the waste stream will
increase as other materials (such as paper, yard waste, and
construction/demolition materials) are diverted in larger amounts.
<P>
The supply of postconsumer resins should continue to increase as more
residential, commercial, and industrial collection programs are implemented.
Demand should also increase, as the domestic and global economy is expected
to maintain a healthy growth rate through the year 2000. To further increase
markets for postconsumer markets, barriers such as the high cost of collection,
sorting, and processing; contamination; and uncertainty about the quality
of recycled content products will need to be addressed. In addition, to stimulate
demand for postconsumer plastics, efforts should be made to increase the
use of recycled resins in durable goods such as appliances, electronics,
and in automobiles and lawn and garden equipment.
<P>
In conclusion, while plastic recycling has lagged behind that for other
commodities, market conditions in 1994 demonstrated that plastics recycling
is economically feasible and results in a valuable resource. The potential
exists to greatly increase the amount of plastic that is currently being
recycled. While there is room to increase the amount of bottles and containers
recycled, the greater emphasis should be placed on increasing the number
of recycled plastic used in durable goods. By working together to address
supply issues, and to stimulate demand for postconsumer plastics, government
and industry can create jobs, conserve energy, and save natural resources
and scarce landfill capacity.

<P>
This paper addresses California markets for recycled inert wastes. Topics
covered include supply, demand, trends, barriers and recommendations to overcome
barriers.
<P>
<B><A NAME="Definitions">Definitions</A></B>
<P>
The term inerts includes concrete, asphalt, asphalt roofing, aggregate, brick,
rubble, and soil. Drywall is often included in this category, though it is
not technically an inert. Processor, or recycler, is the person or business
that crushes or grinds the inerts. This paper focuses on the following inerts:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Recycled aggregate, made from crushed concrete and asphalt.
  <LI>
    Recycled asphalt, which is asphalt pavement made with a percentage of reclaimed
    asphalt pavement.
  <LI>
    Asphalt roofing refers to asphalt composition roofing shingles, which is
    made of asphalt, small&#173;sized aggregate, and roofing felt made of either
    fiberglass or cellulose.
  <LI>
    Drywall, which consists of a sheet of gypsum covered with paper and used
    for interior walls.
</UL>
<P>
<B> <A NAME="Quantities">Quantities</A> </B>
<P>
The most current waste characterization numbers come from the 1990 waste
stream composition data reported to the California Integrated Waste Management
Board (CIWMB) by local governments. Generation of inertsolidwaste was estimated
at 8.9 million tons. The recycling rate for this category was 57 percent.
The remainder, 43 percent or 3.5 million tons, was disposed of in 1990; this
amount comprised 8.8 percent of the waste stream. Asphalt roofing accounts
for approximately 1.1 to 2.2 million tons yearly.
<P>
New construction drywall waste is estimated to be from 300,000 to over 500,000
tons per year, depending on the amount of new construction.
<P>
<B> <A NAME="Importance">Importance</A></B>
<P>
Although inerts recycling is one of California's best success stories, there
is the potential to increase the rate much further through education and
specification changes. Inerts recycling is important for waste reduction
goals due to the material's heavy weight. It has good recycling potential
because it is durable, it can be stockpiled, it is easy to keep segregated,
and it can often be recycled on the same project, thus avoiding transportation
costs. Inerts recycling can be very cost-effective in urban areas where most
of the feedstock is produced.
<P>
Drywall recycling is important because gypsum can produce hydrogen sulfide
gas in certain landfills, particularly in a wet climate. Hydrogen sulfide
gas is toxic at high concentrations (~1,000 parts per million) and has a
foul, rotten egg odor. Drywall is also a major component of construction
waste, and can be used for a variety of purposes.
<P>
<B> Primary <A NAME="Members">Members</A></B>
<P>
The primary members of the inerts recycling industry are generators/ purchasers
(e.g., Caltrans, municipalities, private developers), landfill operators
and haulers, processors and contractors, and pertinent regulatory agencies.
Farmers are presently the largest purchaser of recycled drywall.
<P>
<B> <A NAME="Legislation">Legislation</A></B>
<P>
Assembly Bill (AB) 1306, which was enacted into law in 1989, required Caltrans
to review and modify all bid specifications for paving materials, and base,
subbase, and pervious back fill materials to encourage the maximum use of
recycled materials. The bill also requires Caltrans to purchase recycled
paving materials, base,etc., if the price is competitive. Although Caltrans
has developed some paving specifications allowing recycled material, many
of these have not been well publicized, and other specifications still prohibit
recycled content. Public Resources Code &#167;42700, enacted in 1990, requires
the CIWMB to work with Caltrans to review and develop specifications for
using recycled materials in pavement products.
<P>
The federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991
required research on and use of recycled materials in pavement products.
However, these requirements have been repealed, eliminating any federal mandates
to reuse inerts.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B>II. Current <A NAME="CSupply">Supply</A></B>
<P>
Most inerts are currently generated from road construction and private on-site
work, in the form of concrete, asphalt, and aggregate. Most road construction
is by Caltrans and local public works projects. Private on&#173;site work
generates inerts from sidewalks, curbs and gutters, new development adjacent
to existing streets, parking lots, building foundations, and concrete walls.
Old asphalt roofing is generated mostly from residential roof replacements,
while new asphalt roofing is composed of cut offs from manufacturing plants.
Drywall is generated at construction and demolition sites, though the
construction scrap is cleaner and has more market potential.
<P>
<B> <A NAME="CS:Factors">Factors</A> Affecting Supply </B>
<P>
Supply is primarily affected by economics, quality, and amount of demolition
activity or, in the case of drywall, the amount of construction activity.
<P>
<B><I>Economics</I></B>
<P>
Numerous economics factors affect the supply of inerts for recycling.
<P>
Equipment. Processors must modify or purchase equipment, which also may require
additional permits and their costs.
<P>
Tipping fees. The average landfill tipping fee in California is $31. A typical
recycler's tipping fee ranges from $4 to $12 per ton.
<P>
Transportation costs. The distance to the processor versus to the landfill
must be factored in. Hauling costs approximately $60 per hour.
<P>
Labor costs. Additional labor is required to keep inerts separate at the
job site, or to separate it at the recycler's.
<P>
Price of product. The reclaimed aggregate or gypsum price will affect the
overall economics; a higher purchase price means the tipping fee can be lowered,
thus attracting more feedstock. In southern California, virgin aggregate
costs $7 to $11 per ton, and recycled aggregate costs $2.50 to $6 per ton.
In northern California, virgin aggregate costs $5 to $7 per ton, and recycled
aggregate is competitive with virgin. Mined bulk gypsum costs approximately
$30 per ton; reclaimed gypsum costs $15 to $20 per ton.
<CENTER>
  ____________________
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><I> Quality</I></B>
<P>
If the quality of the feedstock is low, it may be rejected by the processor.
The inerts can be contaminated if not properly separated from other materials
at the job site. Common contaminants in aggregate base are organics such
as wood, grass, and paper; plastic; metals; and brick, though brick may be
acceptable and even desirable in aggregate subbase. Drywall can be contaminated
with wood and miscellaneous paper; for some uses, the drywall paper is a
contaminant, though in agriculture it assists with water absorption.
<P>
Demolition drywall can be contaminated with nails, tape, joint compound,
and paint, and should be used for non-agricultural purposes only.
<CENTER>
  ____________________
</CENTER>
<P>
<B> <I>Demolition/Construction Activity</I></B>
<P>
The amount of demolition and construction activity affects the supply. Caltrans
projects often require large volumes of aggregate. Some stationary recyclers
are too small to supply these large quantities at one time. Without adequate
space to stockpile, these smaller processors require steady demolition to
replenish supply. Earthquakes and military base demolition can create a large
supply of excess concrete and asphalt in specific areas. However, if military
bases can landfill at no charge, they have no incentive to pay a recycler's
tipping fee, and are likely to landfill it or leave it in place. Construction
activity increases the supply of leftover concrete and clean drywall scrap.
  <HR>
<BR>
<B>III. &nbsp;Projected <A NAME="ProjSupply">Supply</A> </B>
<P>
The future supply of inerts will be affected by disasters, base closures,
local government policies, and landfill tipping fees.
<P>
Disasters, particularly earthquakes, will continue to create a steady supply
of inerts.
<P>
By the year 2000, 29 military bases will be closed or "realigned" in California,
with a total land area of 116 square miles. The potential for inerts stockpiling
from demolition is enormous.
<P>
Local government recycling policies may require more inerts recycling.
<P>
Landfill tipping fees may rise eventually, making recycling more cost-effective
from further distances.
<P>
An increased rate of demolition is expected because as cities continue to
grow, there will be less available open space in which to build.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B>IV. &nbsp;Current <A NAME="CDemand">Demand</A></B>
<P>
The current demand for reclaimed concrete and asphalt is primarily as aggregate
used as base under roads. It is also used under parking lots, driveways,
and building foundations, and as pipe trench structural backfill. Concrete
and asphalt can also be crushed to 2 to 6 inches and, along with rubble,
brick, and dirt, be buried as construction fill material at the job site,
such as that used in the recent residential sink hole in San Francisco. The
largest demand for reclaimed gypsum from drywall is as a soil amendment or
additive.
<P>
Primary purchasers of aggregate include Caltrans contractors, local public
works agencies, and private developers; while farmers are the primary purchasers
of reclaimed gypsum.
<P>
Recycled asphalt pavement (15 percent recycled) is also currently used on
non-Caltrans projects, primarily in southern California.<BR>
<P>
<B><A NAME="CD:Factors">Factors</A> Affecting Demand </B>
<P>
Demand is primarily affected by specifications, quality of product, negative
perception/lack of information, amount of construction activity, and supply
of virgin inerts.
<P>
<B>Aggregate Specifications</B>
<P>
<I><B> Greenbook </B></I>
<P>
The <I>Greenbook</I> is the common name for the <I>Standard Specifications
for Public Works Construction</I>, which is published by southern California
chapters of the American Public Works Association and the Associated General
Contractors of California. Most municipalities in southern California depend
on the <I>Greenbook</I> for roadway specifications. The <I>Greenbook</I>
allows crushed asphalt, concrete, and aggregate in its "Crushed Miscellaneous
Base" (CMB), "Processed Miscellaneous Base" (PMB), and Select Subbase. However,
many contractors habitually specify "Crushed Aggregate Base" (CAB) which
does not allow recycled aggregate.
<P>
<B><I> Caltrans</I> </B>
<P>
Most municipalities in northern California depend on Caltrans' <I>Standard
Specifications, July 1992</I>. In Caltrans ' terminology, aggregate base
(AB) is the layer that supports the pavement, and aggregate subbase (ASB)
is the layer that supports the AB. The specifications do not mention recycled
inerts in Class 2 or 3 AB or in Class 1, 2, or 3 ASB. However, Caltrans '
Standard Special Provisions (SSP) amends these specifications to allow
"reclaimed" asphalt and concrete in Class 2 and 3 AB and Class 1, 2, and
3 ASB. SSPs are methods that have been used successfully for a period of
time, and are approved by Caltrans for general use. Some purchasers are not
aware of this.
<CENTER>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B> Asphalt Specifications </B>
<P>
<I><B> Greenbook </B></I>
<P>
The <I>Greenbook</I> provides specifications for 15 percent recycled asphalt
and is widely used in southern California.
<P>
<B> <I>Caltrans </I></B>
<P>
There is currently little demand for recycled asphalt in Caltrans projects,
as Caltrans is still in the process of developing recycled asphalt
specifications.
<P>
Most municipalities and private developers in northern California will not
use recycled asphalt until Caltrans develops specifications. Even if local
governments used other specifications, there is little supply because the
asphalt recycling industry requires large volume markets before investing
in equipment. However, one company in the East Bay, Gallager &amp; Burke,
has purchased a plant and sells 15 percent recycled asphalt to several area
agencies, while another company routinely adds 5 percent recycled to all
new asphalt.
<CENTER>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B> Quality of Product</B>
<P>
Demand for recycled inerts is dependent on the materials' quality. Contaminated
inerts might contain clay, metal, brick, or wood. Clean construction drywall
contains certain additives from the manufacturing process, such as boron.
Boron can be a detriment or a benefit depending on the amount of boron already
in the soil and the type of crops being grown.
<CENTER>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B> Negative Perception/Lack of Information </B>
<P>
Many city/county engineers are unlikely to specify recycled aggregate base
because they are accustomed to virgin materials and lack experience with
recycled. Some hear rumors of problems, but are not aware of the success
stories. Many farmers already use mined gypsum and are reluctant to switch
to reclaimed gypsum for fear of contamination.
<CENTER>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B> Construction Activity </B>
<P>
Demand for aggregate and asphalt depends on the amount of construction,
particularly roadway construction, which is determined in part by economic
cycles, State and local policies, and transportation bond election results.<BR>
<P>
<B>Supply of Virgin Inerts </B>
<P>
Reserves of aggregate are diminishing at quarries that are convenient to
urban areas. Some existing quarries have a five- to ten-year projected life,
and it is becoming more difficult to permit new quarries near urban areas.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B>V. &nbsp;Projected <A NAME="ProjDemand">Demand</A></B>
<P>
Demand will probably increase for recycled aggregate, asphalt, and asphalt
roofing by Caltrans and municipal projects, as discussed below.<BR>
<P>
<B> <A NAME="Aggregate">Aggregate</A></B>
<P>
Municipalities are expected to use more recycled aggregate as they learn
of Caltrans' SSPs and gain confidence with local processors. The Board has
begun a variety of efforts to promote the SSPs and the use of recycled aggregate,
including the publication of two fact sheets, <I>Recycled Aggregate</I> and
<I>Asphalt Pavement Recycling</I>, which are being distributed to local
government recycling coordinators. Other outreach appears beneficial.<BR>
<P>
<B> <A NAME="Asphalt">Asphalt</A></B>
<P>
Recycled asphalt is expected to increase on Caltrans and local road projects
after Caltrans completes test projects. Caltrans is presently testing several
processes for asphalt recycling. Specifications for two processes, "hot recycling
at a central plant" (25-50 percent recycled), and "cold, in-place" (100 percent
recycled). These specifications were supposed to be ready by mid-1996 in
the form of SSPs, according to Caltrans. They are also testing recycled asphalt
from multisource stockpiles (15 percent recycled), a microwave process (70
percent recycled), and a "hot, in-place" process (100 percent recycled).<BR>
<P>
<B> Asphalt <A NAME="Roofing">Roofing</A></B>
<P>
Asphalt roofing can be used to produce a road-patch material, and can be
ground and added to hot-mix asphalt (primarily new shingles) or aggregate
base (primarily old shingles). Asphalt roofing has been recycled in numerous
projects outside California, including New Jersey, Minnesota, Ontario, North
Carolina and Massachusetts. There are currently no recyclers of asphalt roofing
in California to Board staff's knowledge; however, there is growing interest.
In the spring of 1996, Caltrans tested the use of old asphalt roofing as
10 percent of Class 2 aggregate base, with favorable results. Board staff
will be discussing with Caltrans the possibility of a pilot project. A
prospective recycler claims that asphalt roofing will lower the cost of aggregate
base, which will increase the demand for old asphalt roofing.<BR>
<P>
<B> <A NAME="Drywall">Drywall</A></B>
<P>
Recycled drywall prices compete favorably with virgin gypsum. With additional
studies to verify its purity, more farmers should be willing to purchase
reclaimed gypsum.
<CENTER>

<P>
<B>VI. &nbsp;Primary <A NAME="Barriers">Barriers</A> to Material
Supply/Demand</B>
<P>
The primary barriers to supply and demand are specifications, negative
perception/lack of information, and unique industry costs.
<P>
<B> Caltrans Aggregate Specifications</B>
<P>
As noted earlier, Caltrans has developed Standard Special Provisions (SSP)
that allow recycled asphalt and concrete in Class 2 and 3 AB and Class 1,
2, and 3 ASB. However, they are not included in Caltrans' <I>Standard
Specifications, July 1992</I>, the book that contractors and city/county
engineers routinely use.<BR>
<P>
<B> Caltrans Asphalt Specifications </B>
<P>
Caltrans' <I>Standard Specifications, July 1992</I> does not mention reclaimed
asphalt for use in asphalt pavement. Caltrans is presently testing five processes
of asphalt recycling. Development of these specifications is long overdue,
and has been repeatedly postponed due to Caltrans' other priorities.<BR>
<P>
<B> Asphalt Roofing Specifications </B>
<P>
Neither the <I>Greenbook</I>, Caltrans' <I>Standard Specifications, July
1992</I>, nor Caltrans' SSPs mention ground asphalt roofing shingles in aggregate
base, sub-base, or asphalt.<BR>
<P>
<B> Negative Perception</B>
<P>
Some purchasers, particularly city and county engineers, are leery of using
recycled inerts because they assume their quality is inferior to virgin.
Some local governments have long-standing relationships with quarries, and
no longer even test the products delivered to the work site. They are reluctant
to change to an unknown product. Some engineers have had, or heard of, bad
experiences with recycled inerts, so refuse to specify or allow them on their
projects.<BR>
<P>
<B> Lack of Information </B>
<P>
<B><I> Aggregate </I></B>
<P>
The inerts recycling industry is multi-faceted, and communication is often
not as effective as it could be. As noted earlier, Caltrans has developed
Standard Special Provisions (SSP) that specifically allow recycled asphalt
and concrete in Class 2 and 3 AB and Class 1, 2, and 3 ASB. These SSPs, however,
are not in the standard specification book, and therefore not as easily
accessible. Recycled inerts are relatively new products, and require new
skills. Many processors, contractors, and users (such as local governments),
lack the experience necessary to work with recycled materials testing procedures
and markets, and do not have the time to research successful recycled projects.
<P>
<B><I> Drywall</I> </B>
<P>
More information is needed about drywall's use in agriculture. Two studies
provide some positive feedback, but more studies are needed that target
California agriculture. In one study, ground drywall was compared with
agricultural gypsum and limestone on a corn field in upstate New York, with
positive results. The study recommended further research by applying ground
drywall to a variety of soil types, deforested lands, and roadside soils
with high concentrations of sodium from de-icing salts. (De-icing salts are
used in two Caltrans districts, but the soil is monitored and apparently
does not need treatment.) In the second study, an analysis was made of the
chemical suitability of new drywall for agricultural use in California's
Central Valley, with positive results.<BR>
<P>
<B> Unique Industry Costs</B>
<P>
Inerts recycling is a new industry. A new recycler must modify or purchase
equipment; obtain additional permits, such as local land use permits; and
pay additional labor costs. Air pollution control equipment is required at
mobile sites, which makes many smaller jobs cost-prohibitive. Recyclers have
more wear and tear on equipment, and locate in higher rent areas. Recyclers
must charge tipping fees to cover costs, and these fees, together with
transportation costs, must compete with landfilling. The final product also
must compete with the virgin product. In addition, new products or procedures
must be tested before specifications can be developed. Loan programs do not
cover this type of expense.

<P>
<B>VIII. &nbsp;<A NAME="Summary">Summary</A></B>
<P>
<B>Major <A NAME="SumBarriers">Barriers</A></B>
<P>
The primary barriers to inerts recycling are lack of specifications, negative
perception, lack of information, and unique industry costs.
<P>
<B><I> Lack of Specifications </I></B>
<P>
Caltrans is the most important agency for development of road construction
specifications because Caltrans projects require large volumes of inerts,
and because most local governments use Caltrans specifications. Caltrans'
existing specifications for recycled road base are not included in their
specification book. Caltrans' recycled asphalt specifications are long overdue,
and have been repeatedly postponed due to their other priorities. Caltrans
does not have specifications for ground asphalt roofing shingles in road
base or asphalt.
<P>
<B><I> Negative Perception </I></B>
<P>
Many city and county engineers are leery of using recycled inerts because
they assume its quality is inferior to virgin, and are reluctant to change
to an unknown product due to liability concerns.
<P>
<B><I> Lack of Information </I></B>
<P>
When setting up new operations, potential recyclers often need guidance in
permitting requirements, markets, and technology. Many city and county engineers
are reluctant to try a new recycled product because they lack experience
with recycled materials testing procedures. Many farmers are reluctant to
use reclaimed drywall on their fields because they lack information about
its quality.
<P>
<B><I> Unique Industry Costs </I></B>
<P>
Inerts recyclers have costs that are unique to the industry, such as modifying
equipment, obtaining additional permits, additional labor costs, and higher
land costs.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SumStrategies">Strategies</A> </B>
<P>
Recommended actions are summarized below.
<P>
<B><I>Lack of Specifications </I></B>
<P>
The Board should establish an MOU with Caltrans to develop and promote
specifications for recycled-content road products. Assist Caltrans in testing
and give encouragement and funding where necessary, particularly for the
use of asphalt roofing shingles in asphalt pavement and aggregate base, and
reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) in asphalt. Work with local governments
to promote local testing and specification development for recycled-content
road products.<BR>
<P>
<B><I>Negative Perceptions/ Lack of Information </I></B>
<P>
Collect and disseminate information on inerts recycling to industry, local
governments, and the public via workshops, mailings, and Internet, and through
professional organizations. Give customized assistance to individual businesses
via R-Team. Consider hiring construction experts to promote recycled inerts
within industry. Consider funding studies on the use of ground drywall in
soil enhancement applications.<BR>
<P>
<B> <I>Unique Industry Costs </I></B>
<P>
Direct CIWMB staff to enter into an MOU with Caltrans to investigate the
economics of recycling road products, and investigate co-sponsoring legislation
or setting policies, to encourage use of recycled-content road products.
Assign inerts into the lowest solid waste facilities tier in the solid waste
facilities' tiered permitting system to allow long term storage and processing;
distribute the Board's disaster plan (when complete) which discusses the
selection of storage sites; and help create consistent policies by coordinating
with other State permitting agencies.

Over 40 percent of California's waste stream is compostable organic material.
Generation figures for the waste stream in 1990 show 14.6 percent was yard
waste, 8.5 percent was wood waste, 7.1 percent was food waste, and 5.7 percent
was "other" paper (potentially compostable), with small percentages of other
compostable organic materials. Sewage sludge (biosolids), used for co-compost
and land application, represents .5 percent of the waste stream as reported
to the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB). Wood and paper
are addressed separately in other appendices.
<P>
The organic fraction of the waste stream has great potential for composting
and must be diverted if we are to meet the 50&nbsp;percent diversion goal
by the year 2000. Composting may represent the greatest potential for turning
compostable materials into value-added products. Besides composting, organic
materials can be made into many beneficial products including mulch and additives
for on-farm composting, animal feed, animal bedding, biofuel, and landfill
cover. Although paper is not addressed in this report, composting could be
appropriate for some paper, such as waxed or food-contaminated paper, and
for paper mill sludge, which cannot otherwise be recycled into higher value
products.
<P>
Many jurisdictions recognize the need for programs to reduce and divert urban
organics. Backyard composting programs, target yard trimmings to keep them
out of the waste stream. Curbside, drop-off, and seasonal collection of yard
trimmings are becoming commonplace throughout California. There are currently
over 170&nbsp;curbside programs. A separate collection generally results
in cleaner material with less contamination from foreign matter. Supermarket
produce culls and restaurant and institutional food residues can be collected
separately for composting. More composting facilities and operations are
expected to be permitted now that the composting facility regulations have
gone into effect.
<P>
Farmers and growers in large-scale agriculture represent the largest market
for urban compost use. California has 30&nbsp;million acres of farmland with
almost 8&nbsp;million acres in harvested crops. Although organic and sustainable
farming methods promote compost use, most farmers and growers have little
firsthand experience using compost, and agricultural markets remain largely
undeveloped. Awareness of sustainable farming practices continues to grow,
spurred on by the need to:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Reduce use of hazardous pesticides through Integrated Pest Management (IPM).
  <LI>
    Conserve water, especially to reduce nitrate leaching from agricultural chemicals
    into the water table.
  <LI>
    Prevent erosion.
  <LI>
    Adopt methods replenishing soils' organic matter.
  <LI>
    Use of compost is expected to grow as sustainable methods gain wider acceptance.
</UL>
<P>
Nursery owners and landscapers represent markets for compost products with
potential high use. Landscapers are beginning to use more urban compost materials
and make compost from materials generated in their businesses. Landscapers
have endorsed waste prevention measures such as grasscycling and on-site
composting. Some horticultural nursery operations use compost as a cost-effective
soil amendment. Niche markets for urban compost products that need further
development include erosion control and wetland restoration.
<P>
Compost use provides many benefits including better soil aeration and increased
soil tilth. Compost provides slow release of nutrients, and facilitates water
conservation by improving the water holding capacity of soil. Compost and
mulch are useful for weed abatement and erosion control. Enriching soil with
organic matter increases the diversity of microbial activity. A growing volume
of research indicates that compost and mulch amended soil may encourage disease
resistance in specific situations.

<B><A NAME="Definitions">Definitions</A> </B>
<P>
The organic fraction of the waste stream is primarily yard and garden trimmings
from residential and commercial properties, food residues, wood waste,
agricultural crop residues, and manure. The following are definitions of
terms used within this appendix.
<P>
<I><B> Clean green material </B></I> is green material that is processed
by a permitted solid waste or composting facility to reduce contamination
to the greatest extent possible (Public Resource Code (PRC), Title 14, Section
17868.4). Tree and landscape trimmings that have never been combined with
waste materials are considered clean green material.
<P>
<I><B> Fresh green </B> <I><B>mulch</B></I> </I> is uncomposted clean green
material, primarily composed of residential yard trimmings. Minimal processing,
such as screening to remove contaminants or grinding to reduce size, may
prepare the material for use as mulch or compost feedstock.
<P>
<I><B> Green material </B></I> is any plant material that is either separated
at the point of generation or separated at a centralized processing facility
that employs methods to minimize contamination. Green material includes yard
trimmings, plant materials from the food processing industry, manure, untreated
wood wastes, paper products, and natural fiber products. U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and State metal concentration limit requirements
must be met.
<P>
<I><B> Other Paper </B></I> is a term used in the data collection process
to indicate paper residues suitable for composting.
<P>
<I><B> Sewage sludge (biosolids) </B></I> is material generated during the
treatment of domestic sewage in a treatment plant.
<P>
<I><B> Yard waste or yard trimmings </B></I> refers to leaves, grass clippings,
and garden prunings.

<P>
<B><I> Agricultural Compost and Mulch Demonstrations </I></B>
<P>
Five agricultural compost and mulch demonstrations were initiated by the
California Integrated Waste Management Board during 1994. They show urban
compost product use on a variety of commercial crops in major agricultural
regions of California. Farmers, nurserymen, farm advisors, local government
representatives, and compost producers are working together on cooperative
teams to document the benefits of using urban compost products in crop
production. Scheduled to be completed in 1997, the preliminary findings indicate
that compost use can be advantageous. Most crops are doing at least as well
with compost as with other soil amendments. Cooperative team members have
also observed specific disease suppression on peaches and onions in the
randomized plots receiving compost applications.
<P>
<B> <I>Compost Product Guidelines </I></B>
<P>
The one-year effort to develop compost product guidelines brought together
potential urban compost users, farm advisors, and compost producers on a
Compost Agricultural Steering Committee. The guidelines encourage dialog
with producers about compost, the ingredients, and the process that creates
the product. The guidelines can provide a valuable source of information
for the compost buyer. Particle size, organic matter content, salinity, and
pH are among the list of parameters to be disclosed. The Board is encouraging
the compost and agricultural industries to work together to further refine
and implement the guidelines. The California Compost Quality Council (CCQC),
a broad-based coalition representing compost producers, compost users, and
State government, is beginning to implement the guidelines.
<P>
<B> <I>Outreach to Agriculture </I></B>
<P>
The CIWMB's compost outreach to agriculture, conducted in cooperation with
U.S. EPA, is focused on presenting informational exhibits and workshops at
established farm shows throughout the State. The CIWMB and EPA also sponsored
a variety of conferences to bring compost information and education directly
to agriculture, and to the commercial nursery and landscape industries. CIWMB
is continuing this outreach program, including outreach at farm equipment
expositions and the trade show at the California Farm Bureau Federation annual
conference.

Current statewide figures on the amount of yard trimmings and food residues
in the waste stream are not available. (See table on following page for 1990
figures.) While yard waste averaged less than 15 percent of the statewide
waste stream reported in 1990, many cities claim yard trimmings represent
up to 40 percent of the waste generated. More tons of urban organics, including
yard trimmings, food residues, and "other" paper, are generated today than
in 1990 due to population increase. The drought of 1990 may have contributed
to under-reporting of yard waste. Over 2.5 million tons of compost are currently
being produced by the 65 compost distributors on CIWMB's "compost and mulch
sources list."

<B> Primary <A NAME="S:Factors">Factors</A> Affecting Supply Collection </B>
<P>
More organic materials are being diverted as the infrastructure for collection
continues to be developed. Some cities have traditionally collected yard
trimmings in the spring and in the autumn. Many jurisdictions have separate
collections year-round for yard trimmings, increasing the available supply
of source-separated compostables.
<P>
The level of contamination, (i.e. mixing of source-separated organics with
undesirable materials), varies widely. Factors influencing contaminants include
the amount of education directed toward the person who takes the material
to the curb or drop-off site as well as the collection methods, whether in
separate bins or bags, or picked up from the street. Food processing residues
and supermarket produce culls are increasingly used in composting and
vermiculture operations, both for the nutrients and moisture content.
<I>Biocycle</I> <I>Journal</I> reported that there are several food composting
facilities in California. U.S.&nbsp;EPA reports that nationally, food composting
reached measurable proportions for the first time in 1994.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Regulatory Atmosphere </I></B>
<P>
The regulatory environment affects decisions to establish or expand a composting
business. Some potential composters began mulching operations while awaiting
completion of the composting facility regulations. Land spreading or on-farm
composting was encouraged where the supply of collected urban green material
exceeded the capacity of local permitted composting facilities. Since less
processing is required, the selling price of green mulch, which is minimally
processed, is lower than for compost.
<P>
Several other agencies regulate composting facilities and operations.
<P>
Regional Air Quality Control Boards may regulate emissions from composting
equipment. They also restrict burning. Thus, agricultural residues are becoming
more available for on-farm composting. The Water Quality Control Board completed
streamlined water discharge requirements that apply to most composting
facilities.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Markets </I></B>
<P>
A few years ago, biofuel was the highest-dollar-value market for wood, woody
yard trimmings, and agricultural wastes, bringing as much as $40 to $60 per
ton. Many biomass and cogeneration plants have closed as the "standard offer"
contracts resulting from the fuel crisis of the late seventies came to an
end, resulting in increased amounts of biomass available for mulch and
composting. Forthcoming Public Utilities Commission decisions on competitive
pricing for energy will impact the remaining biomass and cogeneration operations,
especially if a special provisions are made to maintain renewable energy
facilities. See <I>Market Status Report: Urban Wood</I> for a more complete
assessment and impacts of biomass fuel.
<CENTER>

<P>
<B><A NAME="S:Projected">Projected</A> Supply </B>
<P>
The amount of organic waste is expected to increase with population growth.
U.S.&nbsp;EPA projects lower per capita generation of yard waste for 2000,
as yard trimmings used for backyard composting are not included in U.S. EPA
waste generation figures. Backyard composting is considered source reduction,
thus some yard trimmings are not counted in national generation figures.
California also includes yard trimmings as source reduction, but they are
counted for generation. Many cities and counties offer popular grasscycling
and backyard composting programs which keep yard waste out of landfills by
encouraging on going participation from an estimated 3 percent per year of
the population.
<P>
Implementing backyard composting programs, food waste reduction by restaurants,
and other waste prevention activities will lessen the supply of urban organics
that must be diverted from landfills. Aggressively promoting on-farm and
institutional composting, will help achieve the waste reduction projected
by U.S. EPA and CIWMB.
<P>
As cities and counties continue to establish organic material collection
programs, more feedstock will be available for diversion of composting operations
and facilities. By Department of Conservation Division of Recycling count
yard trimmings are included in over 170 curbside collection programs.
<P>
Large scale mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) composting has not developed
in California, although in 1990 several jurisdictions reported planning MSW
composting facilities. According to an article in the March 1996 issue of
<I>MSW Management</I> MSW plants in other parts of the country have closed,
primarily because of odor problems and lack of capital available to solve
those problems. In the future information may be available about how many
active and planned projects are in California.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B> III. &nbsp;<A NAME="Demand">Demand</A> </B><BR>
<P>
<B> <A NAME="D:Current">Current</A> Demand </B>
<P>
The Board hopes to divert ten million tons per year of organic material and
to create additional markets for five to six million tons of compost per
year. Composting reduces the volume of feedstock by one third to one half,
so one ton of organic material would make approximately one half ton of compost.
Current demand is estimated at around three million tons of compost and mulch.
Successful composters claim to sell all the compost products they produce.
In fact the demand for compost from established producers may be greater
than the available supply, so some established producers are working to increase
their supply of feedstock and permitted capacty.
<P>
Uncomposted green material has gained a foothold in the marketplace along
with woody mulch. The demand is from farmers and composters who use fresh
green as mulch, and from composters as feedstock in compost production. Green
mulch or ground yard trimmings are cheaper to produce than mature compost,
requiring only minimal processing through a permitted solid waste facility.
<CENTER>
  ____________________
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><A NAME="D:Factors">Factors</A> Affecting Demand </B>
<P>
<B><I> Marketing and "Brand" Names </I></B>
<P>
As in any business, a compost producer must reliably produce a consistent
product, and have sufficient quantity available when needed. Consistent product
quality, customer service, and successful marketing techniques are key
ingredients to maintaining demand for products. Government-operated composting
facilities must view composting as more than a waste management technique.
They must adopt marketing techniques to sell products.
<P>
All compost is not the same. Products or "brand names" from recognized producers
command higher prices. Currently, the term "compost" is used to sell all
manner of soil amendment products, from uncomposted forest product fines
to fully mature compost, and everything in between. A recognizable symbol
of quality can boost markets.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Transportation and Application Costs </I></B>
<P>
The cost of using compost includes the product cost, transportation cost
to deliver the material, and the cost to apply the product. Costs to spread
the product may remain be relatively high until equipment and application
methods are refined with increased usage. Compost sells at a fairly low price,
($5-$20/cu.yd. or $10-$40/ton), compared to the products it competes with,
particularly manure and chemical fertilizers. Transportation costs can exceed
the cost of the product when shipping a great distance. Costs at the front
end must be compared to benefits (e.g. crop yield or increased organic matter)
at the back end. Comparing the short term benefits of synthetic inputs to
the long term benefits of compost, (improved water-holding capacity or improved
tilth), may prove difficult.
<CENTER>

</CENTER>
<P>
<B><A NAME="D:Projected">Projected</A> Demand </B>
<P>
<B><I> Agriculture </I></B>
<P>
Few conventional farmers or growers currently use compost or other organic
methods on the 30 million acres of California farmland. The largely untapped
market is there, waiting to be developed. A few compost marketing pundits
have projected that, within three years, the demand for compost and green
mulch could outstrip the supply at current prices.
<P>
Rapid changes seem to be taking place in attitude towards organic soil amendments
and understanding of compost's benefits. While only about one percent of
the farmers in California are certified organic, many conventional farmers
are learning about sustainable farming methods, which encourage compost and
other organic inputs while reducing the amount of agrichemicals used. Farmers
and growers will adopt some alternative methods, including compost use,
especially when costs are affordable and there is no decrease in crop yield.
This trend in use of urban organics is expected to grow significantly, increasing
markets for urban green materials.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Landscaping and Horticulture </I></B>
<P>
Landscaping contractors are adopting green industry guidelines and will no
doubt increase their use of compost products from urban sources. Since appearance
is important, landscapers demand products that look good. Several horticultural
nurseries use compost products and work with local compost providers to develop
products suited to their needs. If this is any indication, the outlook is
very good for increased demand in both the nursery and the landscape
industries.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Alternative Daily Cover (ADC) </I></B>
<P>
ADC is material used in place of the usual soil cover on the working face
of a landfill each day to avoid odor and flies. A one-year approved demonstration
trial is required before alternative materials, such as yard trimmings, are
approved for use. ADC is a viable market for green material in California,
particularly where no native soils are available at a landfill site. On February
23, 1996, the California State Supreme Court ruled against counting yard
trimmings used as alternative daily cover for diversion credit; however,
landfills may continue to use green material as ADC. A bill allowing diversion
credit for ADC (AB 1647, Bustamonte, Chapter 978) goes into effect January
1, 1997.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Biosolids </I></B>
<P>
Sewage sludge, also called biosolids, represents a small part of the waste
stream as reported to the CIWMB in 1990. However, sanitation districts and
companies involved in beneficial reuse of biosolids are enthusiastic about
composting biosolids, and frequently mix in other urban organics as bulking
agents. Much research has focused on sewage sludge and MSW compost, showing
them to be safe soil amendments in many applications.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B>IV. &nbsp;<A NAME="Barriers">Barriers</A> to Markets </B>
<P>
<B> Underdeveloped Agricultural <A NAME="Markets">Markets</A> </B>
<P>
Agricultural markets for compost and mulch products are underdeveloped, due
in part to the reasons described below.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Market Information on Compost Lacking </I></B>
<P>
Market information on compost and other soil amendment products is not readily
available. Compost commands a low price at local markets, so there has been
no perceived need to track the flow of supply or demand on a statewide or
national level until recently.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Perception of Contamination </I></B>
<P>
Users want "clean" compost with no contamination by unprocessed waste or
heavy metals. Curbside collected organics may be mixed with glass, plastic,
metals, rock or other foreign matter. "Clean green" material processed through
a permitted facility, may still contain "contaminants" such as plastic bags
or tennis balls not screened out during processing.
<P>
Public perception of urban compost is negative. This perception extends to
all feedstocks, including yard trimmings, but is stronger towards biosolids.
Several major food crop producers will not buy products grown on land that
has used biosolids. Farmers want to know how to use compost, especially
recommended application rates for specific crops, and long term versus short
term benefits. Use of organic materials, especially compost from urban sources,
is unfamiliar to many farmers and farm advisors schooled in conventional
methods. They may not know anyone who has used compost. There is no list
of demonstrations or resources for interested farmers.<BR>
<P>
<B> <I>Compost Not High on Buy Recycled Procurement List </I></B>
<P>
Compost products made from municipal materials are not a high priority for
government procurement when governments purchase soil amendment products
for public parks, golf courses, and other landscaping uses.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Perception of Compost Application as Too Costly </I></B>
<P>
Farmers may think that applying compost is expensive because equipment to
apply compost or mulch products may not be available. Farmers have invested
in water supply and drainage systems that also function to deliver fertilizers,
herbicides and pesticide applications. Those systems are not adapted to spreading
compost.<BR>
<CENTER>
  ____________________
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Perception of Regulatory Red <A NAME="Tape">Tape</A> </B>
<P>
<B> <I>Public Perception </I></B>
<P>
Public perception is that California has too much red tape. Compliance with
the multitude of State and local regulations can be time consuming, costly,
and complex. Siting and permitting a composting facility or operation can
cost thousands of dollars and may include local business permits, special
siting requirements, planning commission and other local government approval,
as well as regional Water Quality Control Boards, regional Air Quality Management
Districts and other regional or State agencies.
<P>
While it is often the last permit obtained, the CIWMB composting facility
permit is "a piece of cake" compared to the host of other requirements, to
quote a recently permitted commercial composter.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> New Composting Facility Regulations Not Well Understood </I></B>
<P>
New composting facility regulations, effective July 31, 1995, have reduced
the regulatory burden, which should aid the composting industry; however,
potential composters and on&#173;farm composters are cautious. CIWMB composting
regulations are not widely understood, although they became effective July
31 1995. The regulations incorporate performance standards. They do not prescribe
specific actions to avoid undesirable outcomes. Interpretation by Enforcement
Agencies in combination with local ordinances, make existing and potential
composters hesitant to begin or expand composting urban feedstocks. Operators
prefer to know in advance which tier they will be on and exactly what
requirements and fees will be imposed by State and local governments.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B> V. &nbsp;<A HREF="#Strategies" NAME="Strategies">Strategies</A> to Overcome
Barriers </B>
<P>
<B> Increase Compost <A NAME="Use">Use</A> </B>
<P>
The use of compost and clean green materials in agriculture and in the landscape
and nursery industries could be increased using some of the following strategies.
<P>
<B><I> Educate End Users and Producers </I></B>
<P>
CIWMB should compile and distribute market reports and other information
about compostable products, and publicize market information from national
waste management publications for compost producers . Case studies of successful
marketing operations can be distributed. Develop a comprehensive tracking
system to assess the development of compost and clean green mulching facilities
and markets for organic products from urban sources to closely track the
development of this emerging recycling industry. The CIWMB should continue
its public education program promoting the value and benefits of urban compost
at farm shows and in trade publications. Consumer education is needed to
introduce conventional farmers to urban compost use and to reassure consumers
about health and safety issues.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Refine and Publicize Compost Quality Standards </I></B>
<P>
Continue cooperation and dialog between end users and producers to determine
the market needs for compost product quality. Encourage efforts to further
refine and implement compost product quality guidelines by the agricultural
and composting industries. Continue working with California Compost Quality
Council, California Organics Recycling Council, Association of Compost Producers
and the Composting Council to assist the fledgling composting industry.
<P>
Generally contaminant-free compost will find the highest value markets. Encourage
improved collection methods. Collectors must ensure that load-checking protocols
at facilities marketing "clean green" material result in contaminant levels
at or below the required 0.5 percent level. Special care may be needed to
monitor materials that are a visual problem, such as tennis balls and other
hard-to-remove waste materials. What constitutes a contaminant depends upon
the end use. Not all consumers demand the same type of product, and a contaminant
in one application may be acceptable in another. Appearance is critical for
landscapers who demand clean material for their clients. Farming uses may
allow some amount of plastic or glass, while plant pathogens, herbicide residues
or viable weed seeds are unacceptable. The CIWMB should encourage end users
to demand the product they can use. At the same time, collectors must educate
the public to prepare materials for collection in a suitable manner.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Promote and Publicize Existing Compost Demonstration Projects </I></B>
<P>
Sponsor new research and demonstrations, extend existing projects, and encourage
additional compost demonstrations and use by other groups throughout the
state. The CIWMB should publicize the compost demonstration projects through
field days, videos, and other media, and compile project results so that
farmers can see agricultural use of compost firsthand, allowing farmers to
discuss the pros and cons of compost use and compost products with their
peers. Piggyback or co-sponsor programs that encourage compost use, such
as the Department of Pesticide Regulation's (DPR) Integrated Pest Management
(IPM) Innovators program, and events of the Committee for Sustainable
Agriculture, the Community Alliance for Family Farmers, compost producers,
and other groups. More research and demonstration projects are needed to
familiarize users with urban compost products in local environments (the
"farm down the road"), and to provide information about application rates
and efficiencies. Coordinate with the Fertilizer Research and Education Program
(FREP) and other programs to promote inclusion of compost projects in grant
awards. Publicize grant availability from other sources. Work with Cooperative
Extension Farm Advisors, Resource Conservation Districts, and other researchers
and agronomists to foster research on compost and support discussion of recent
research findings and further research needs for urban compost.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Promote Compost Product Sales Through Buy Recycled Efforts </I></B>
<P>
Continue efforts to encourage procurement officers to find local sources
of compost for use at schools, parks, community colleges, and other public
properties. Include compost and other recycled organic products in the CIWMB
"buy recycled" online database. Educate potential governmental users and
procurement officers about the availability of compost products. Encourage
producers and end users to dialog so that composters will provide the type
of material needed for specific applications. Publicize specifications of
the Department of Transportation (Caltrans) for urban compost and compost
made from recycled, municipally collected materials until they are included
in the<I> State Standard Specifications</I> manual.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Facilitate Availability of Compost Equipment </I></B>
<P>
Equipment for spreading compost products is commonly available. Existing
conventional farm equipment, such as manure spreaders, can spread compost
with little, if any, modification. Companies that specialize in spreading
manures and composts can be hired on an "as needed" basis. Local governments
can make information available about compost spreaders and equipment for
compost application. Composters should consider product application as an
additional service for their customers.
<P>
<CENTER>
  ____________________
</CENTER>
<P>
<B> Improve Compost <A NAME="Production">Production</A> </B>
<P>
Compost production can be improved by streamlining regulatory procedures,
and facilitating exchange of information between the composting community
and regulators.
<P>
<B><I> Reduce Regulatory Red Tape </I></B>
<P>
The CIWMB should continue efforts to streamline State regulations and work
with local and regional decision makers, especially LEAs, to simplify and
coordinate local procedures for siting composting facilities. CIWMB can assist
local governments with preparation of step-by-step procedures on "permitting
road maps" for their jurisdictions and set up green teams to expedite siting
and permitting processes. R-Team, Board Recycling Market Development Zone
staff, and zone administrators can be enlisted to facilitate siting and
development of new and expanded compost facilities and operations in Recycling
Market Development Zones and elsewhere. The CIWMB should prepare how-to fact
sheets and case studies that explain composting requirements so all potential
composters know what tier they fit into with a given feedstock type and volume
of feedstock, active compost, and sales.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Increase Understanding of Tiered Permitting </I></B>
<P>
The CIWMB has been widely praised for developing the tiered regulatory framework,
but should increase efforts to help the regulated public understand the tiers
and the compost facility and operation regulatory requirements.
<P>
Although the Local Enforcement Agencies actually put the regulations into
effect, the Board should sponsor regional workshops to bring regulators and
producers together to share knowledge about safe, productive and cost effective
composting techniques. Workshops could highlight best management practices
and explore alternative ways to comply with regulations.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B> VII. &nbsp;<A NAME="Summary">Summary</A> </B>
<P>
Yard trimmings, food residues and other biodegradable materials in the organic
fraction of the waste stream represent about 40 percent of the waste steam.
Most of this material must be diverted to meet the 50 percent diversion goal
by 2000. Compost and mulch are the primary products made from urban organics.
Agriculture represents the largest potential market for urban compost and
mulch use. Landscapers and nurseries are emerging markets for urban compost
and mulch products.
<P>
<B> Barriers </B>
<P>
The major barriers to recycling and composting urban organics, primarily
yard trimmings and food wastes, are:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Agricultural markets for compost products are underdeveloped, with little
    market information available. Perception concerns over compost safety and
    benefits deter market development.
  <LI>
    Local and State regulations do not encourage existing and potential composters
    to expand or begin composting organics from the urban wastestream, so widespread
    expansion of composting facilities has not occurred.
</UL>
<P>
<B> Strategies </B>
<P>
Staff strategies to improve recycling and composting of urban organics include:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Increase the use of compost in agriculture and in the landscape and nursery
    industries by providing education to collectors, procurement officers, and
    compost users through compost outreach (education, demonstrations, guidelines,
    and market information).
  <LI>
    Improve compost production by providing information and assistance to the
    composting community and to regulators via joint training, regulatory
    streamlining or roadmaps, and educational outreach.<BR>

<P>
This report primarily discusses urban wood. Although there is no regulator
definition for urban wood waste, it is general accepted to be wood that includes
pieces generated during the manufacture or processing of wood products; the
harvesting or processing of raw woody crops; the wood debris from construction,
demolition, and renovation activities; and wood used in packaging and
transportation, such as pallets. Urban wood waste excludes green waste, such
as tree trimmings, grass clippings, brush, leaves, and weeds (these materials
are addressed in the "<I>Compost</I>" Paper). The wood waste generated during
the land clearing portion of large construction operations is often included
in this definition. The wood being quantified in this section essentially
encompasses the wood waste that enters, or potentially could enter, the municipal
waste stream. This material has also been called "nonyard wood waste." <BR>
<BR>
Due to inconsistencies in defining and quantifying this material, accurate
figures on urban wood waste generation, disposal, and diversion tonnages
are not available. However, estimates of the quantities of urban wood waste
have been compiled by various sources. They can be used to outline general
industry trends and general waste flows.<BR>
<BR>
The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) compiled available
data on wood waste generation taken from draft "source reduction and recycling
elements" (SRRE) submitted by local jurisdictions in 1990. The information
in that database estimates that 3,797,655 tons per year of urban wood waste
entered the California wastestream, or approximately 9 percent of the total
waste stream. Of that amount, 88 percent, or 3,350,185 tons per year were
landfilled, while the remaining 447,470 tons were diverted.<BR>
<BR>
The tonnages of wood waste listed above should not have included material
sent to biomass facilities or other transformation facilities permitted by
the CIWMB. However, some jurisdictions may have included such materials in
their reports. <BR>
<BR>
Another supply of wood waste that was not quantified in the SRREs was wood
that was disposed in wood-only landfills (wood monofills). As this material
does not enter the municipal waste stream, it will not affect overall quantities
and will not be discussed further in this report. <BR>
  <HR>
<B> </B>
<P>
<B>II. &nbsp;<A NAME="Supply">Supply</A> of Urban Wood </B>
<P>
As indicated in the introduction, almost 4 million tons of urban wood waste
enters the California municipal wastestream annually. In 1995 an additional
900,000 tons of urban wood waste was consumed by biomass plants in California.
<P>
Of the 4 million tons of urban wood entering the wastestream, the majority
comes from two sources: wood waste from activities related to construction,
demolition, and renovation; and wood (such as pallet wood) used to package
and transport goods. Thus, the vast majority of urban wood waste is generated
in the state's large urban centers.
<P>
Statistics on the generation, collection, and disposal of wood waste by region
are shown in the following table.<BR>
<BR>
Again, the amounts should not include wood waste resulting from logging and
milling operations and wood waste going to biomass plants for the production
of energy and steam. <BR>

<P>
Note that 65 percent of the urban wood waste entering the municipal waste
stream originated from the Greater Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay regions.
<BR>
<P>
The regional supply trends should remain consistent for at least the short
term, as the supply center for urban wood waste will continue to be the most
densely populated areas. However, the overall supply of wood waste should
remain high or increase in the near future. <BR>
<BR>
Several factors may affect the potential increase in wood waste generation
and disposal. The overall generation of wood waste can be loosely tied to
the construction and demolition industries (the largest contributors). These
industries, along with shipping and manufacturing, flourish with the overall
growth of the population and local and national economies. If the California
economy grows, wood waste generation will increase. <BR>
<BR>
The primary factors affecting the amounts of wood waste disposed include
low landfill tipping fees and an overall glut in the processed wood waste
market. The primary cause of the market glut is based on the fact that processed
wood waste continues to be produced while a primary market, biomass fuel,
has diminished over the past few years.<BR>
  <HR>
<P>
<B> III. &nbsp;<A NAME="Demand">Demand</A> for Urban Wood<BR>
</B>
<P>
By far, the largest market for wood waste in California has been as feedstock
for fuel in the biomass industry. Lesser markets include wood waste ground
for mulch and bedding, feedstocks for fiberboard manufacture, and salvaging
whole pieces for reuse and remilling. <BR>
<P>
<B><I> <A NAME="Biomass">Biomass</A></I><BR>
<BR>
</B>The biomass industry represents the largest market for processed urban
wood waste and material from logging, agriculture, and other sources of wood
waste that do not traditionally landfill their waste.
<P>
In the 1980s the biomass industry experienced rapid growth in California,
fostered by the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA),
which promoted renewable energy sources. Facilities that used renewable fuels,
such as biomass, and met other criteria qualified for guaranteed contracts
at higher energy and power prices than traditional non-renewable energy
facilities.
<P>
Many of the contracts held by the biomass plants have reached the end of
the ten-year guaranteed contract period. The economics of the new contracts
often do not justify continued operation of these facilities. As a result,
many plants are closing or curtailing operations. This has resulted in a
significant downsizing of the wood waste fuel market and has created the
current glut in the market. The current consumption of wood waste by the
biomass industry has shrunken to about half its peak of three years ago.
The latest figures available are from 1994. This data was provided by the
biomass and wood processing industries. At the time the data was compiled,
11 biomass plants, which consumed almost 700,000 tons of urban wood waste,
had already ceased operations. The latest data indicates approximately 19
plants are still in operation, consuming about 900,000 tons of urban wood
waste per year.
<CENTER>
  ____________________<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><I> <A NAME="Other">Other</A> Markets</I></B>
<P>
The smaller markets for wood waste represented by fiberboard and particle
board (engineered wood) manufacturers and mulch producers have maintained
their current markets, but are not large enough to offset the downsizing
of the biomass industry. Construction waste represents the most likely source
of wood waste feedstock for the engineered wood industry due to its need
for clean, homogenous wood. Mixed wood waste generally is not adequate for
fiberboard manufacture due to its inconsistent make up. However, advances
in sorting and processing techniques may open this market for other wood
waste.
<P>
Wood waste processors will continue to produce mulch and compost as the market
demands. However, there is no accurate data on the current markets at this
time. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the current market demands
or the appropriate methods to address those demands.
<P>
It should be noted that the majority of the 100 or so established wood waste
processors in the state sold at least a portion of their end product to the
biomass industry. As a result, the shrinking biomass industry will certainly
cause closures in the wood waste processing industry and reduce the processing
capabilities in the state. No other new markets have surfaced to consume
the vast majority of wood waste currently being landfilled.
<P>
Discussions with industry representatives stressed that there are numerous
niche markets for wood that either reuse the component in its original intent,
or craft smaller wood pieces into value-added commodities. Although these
businesses are quite small individually, they can represent a significant
share of the market when they are combined.
<P>
Other potential markets for wood waste that may warrant further investigation
include the paper pulping industry, export markets, and methanol/ethanol
production. Although the current economics of some of these markets may not
be favorable, they are worth mentioning for future reference.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B> IV. &nbsp;Primary <A NAME="Barriers">Barriers</A><BR>
<BR>
</B>The primary barriers to reusing and processing urban wood waste include
the current wasteful practices that generate the material, the relatively
low disposal costs for wood waste, the time limitations to hand deconstruction,
and a diminishing market for the processed material.
<CENTER>
  ____________________<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><I> Construction and Demolition <A NAME="Practices">Practices</A> </I><BR>
<BR>
</B>The majority of construction and demolition contractors are generally
unaware of wood waste diversion opportunities and the possible economic
opportunities that they present. In some instances, local wood waste processors
offer drop box services or are willing to accept construction wood waste
at no or reduced tipping fees, and the contractor saves the avoided disposal
costs. But this practice is not widespread, being limited to the influence
of regional biomass facilities, or to a lesser extent, the local particle
board manufacturer that purchase the wood waste.
<P>
Demolition wood waste however, represents a much larger portion of the municipal
waste stream. It is, however, far more difficult to recycle, since wood in
demolition debris is commingled with other wastes. The quickest and most
common way to demolish a building is through heavy equipment use. This tends
to break up and mix the materials that formed the structure, thereby increasing
the costs to separate and process the wood. Hand demolition techniques offer
an alternative that recovers a much higher percentage of the material; however,
time constraints often limit this option. Furthermore, workers must be skilled
in deconstruction techniques to make this approach cost-effective.
<CENTER>
  ____________________<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><I> <A NAME="Disposal">Disposal</A> Cost</I></B>
<P>
California landfill tipping fees average about $30.00 per ton. Such relatively
low disposal costs act as a disincentive to reuse and recycle wood. Economic
alternatives need to be evaluated and publicized. If it is currently cheaper
to haul wood waste to a landfill than separate, process, and transport it
to markets, there is little or no incentive for a generator of wood waste
to consider alternatives to disposal.
<CENTER>
  ____________________<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><I> Market <A NAME="Glut">Glut</A>/Low Market Price</I></B>
<P>
The wood waste market is currently glutted with processed material. The
overabundance of processed material, compounded by the continual decline
of the biomass fuels segment of the market, results in depressed prices,
making further collection uneconomical. If the current market trends continue,
many of the wood waste processors currently operating will go out of business.
<P>
The market glut and low market price for processed wood waste are being
exacerbated by the possibility of deregulation of the state's public utilities.
The California Public Utilities Commission has been evaluating several scenarios
of deregulation of the state's public utilities since 1994 and a decision
is not likely this year. This uncertainty in the final form of deregulation
has served as an incentive for several of the biomass plants to accept buy-out
offers of existing contracts and curtail operations. This has expedited the
downsizing of the biomass market for wood waste. Until the final form of
deregulation is decided, this trend towards diminished wood waste markets
will likely continue.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B> V. &nbsp;<A NAME="Strategies">Strategies</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
A variety of market forces determine the health and growth of the wood waste
market. As such, the CIWMB has little influence on the overall wood waste
market. The CIWMB's primary role in assisting markets should be in supporting
operations that process wood waste and consume processed wood waste products
in order to divert this material from permitted disposal facilities.
<P>
The CIWMB should support legislation which increases demand for processed
wood waste which would reduce that reaching disposal foster existing markets.
The most influential legislation currently being proposed is Assembly Bill
(AB) 1202. This bill would require 1.8 percent of all electricity generated
in California to be purchased from biomass plants. As the entire capacity
of the biomass industry is estimated at 1.5 to 2 percent of the electric
energy produced, the passage of this bill would support the biomass industry
in California and ensure that at least the current market for wood waste
endures. The CIWMB should continue to actively support AB 1202.
<P>
The CIWMB should continue to investigate and support additional forms of
wood waste reuse and efforts to process wood waste for higher-order uses
such as engineered wood production. Further study is needed to determine
the viability of using urban wood waste as a feedstock for the manufacture
of particle board and fiberboard as well as a source of fiber for pulping
mills. These present the only current alternatives to biomass consumption
at this time.
<P>
The CIWMB should continue to evaluate and encourage diversion and reuse practices
in addition to market assistance.
<P>
The CIWMB should network with wood processors and large construction firms
to encourage reuse of wood waste, an easily recovered material. This can
be achieved through the current programs established at the CIWMB including
the Construction and Demolition Program, the R-Team, the RMDZ Loan Program,
and the Buy Recycled Program. These programs should continue their current
effort with possible emphasis on operations that target priority materials
and recycling strategies.
<P>
Education is needed to show local contractors the economic advantages of
either separating the waste on site or using a local wood waste processor
as a "disposal" option. Also, in order to recycle greater percentages of
demolition wood waste, efforts need to be focussed on educating demolition
contractors about deconstruction techniques which will allow them to produce
materials for eventual reuse. This can be accomplished by examining successful
and profitable operations and documenting them. The information can then
be disseminated in fact sheets and case studies to other contractors and
operations throughout the State.
<P>
The CIWMB should continue its efforts in documenting and publicizing
deconstruction techniques that salvage wood for reuse. The information can
be distributed by mailings of fact sheets and case studies to trade associations,
local enforcement agencies, and specific targeted groups. This information
can also be posted on the CIWMB's web site on the Internet.
<P>
There is currently very little information regarding new or alternative markets
for wood waste. If the CIWMB concludes that alternative markets for wood
waste represents a significant potential for consuming this material, further
study is needed. The studies might include evaluating operations and techniques
used to recover materials generated from construction and demolition activities
as well as material recovery facility techniques that economically remove
wood waste from mixed demolition materials. The studies should also include
the evaluation of potential markets available for the processed wood waste.
<P>
Low disposal costs continue to be a major barrier to diversion. With low
disposal costs, there is no incentive for wood waste generators to pursue
any other options beyond landfill disposal. The options available to the
CIWMB to change these economics include landfill bans on wood waste, increases
in tipping fees, and assessing strategies to reduce hauling, processing,
and manufacturing costs. As tipping fee increases and landfill bans are not
viable at this time, methods need to be developed to reduce recycling costs
to allow these operations to compete with low disposal costs.

<P>
In 1995, approximately 30 million waste tires were generated in California.
About 18 million of those (60 percent) were diverted from disposal through
reuse, retreading, combustion, or recycling. The largest market for waste
tires was as a fuel (over 11 million tires: 5 million for electricity production
and 6 million for cement production). The second largest market for used
and waste tires was the reuse/retread market (over 4 million tires). Another
2 million tires were recycled into products including rubberized asphalt,
rubber mats and playground covers, carpet tile, speed bumps, sound walls,
and various stamped or molded products. <BR>
<BR>
  <HR>
<P>
<P>
<B>II. &nbsp;<A NAME="Supply">Supply</A> of Waste Tires<BR>
</B>
<P>
Currently there is no formal system for tracking the generation, reuse/recycling,
and disposal of used tires. The generation estimates discussed in this paper
are based on population, the number of vehicles registered in the state,
vehicle miles traveled, and average fuel consumption. Reuse/recycling numbers
are based on information from businesses involved with scrap tire collection
and processing. Based on available information, the supply of waste tires
in 1996 is estimated to be 12 million tires, roughly the amount stockpiled
(not including tires in existing stockpiles or disposal sites) and disposed
of in 1995.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<P>
<B> III. &nbsp;<A NAME="Demand">Demand</A> for Waste Tires<BR>
</B>
<P>
The amount of waste tires combusted at cement kilns may increase significantly
in the next two to three years. Tires are a cheaper fuel source than coal,
and may burn cleaner than coal in regard to sulfur dioxide (SO<SUB>2</SUB>)
and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). For more information on air quality impacts
of tires as a fuel, please refer to the Board's January 1992 report to the
Legislature, <I>Tires as a Fuel Supplement: Feasibility Study</I>. Since
tires are a cheaper fuel alternative to coal, cement kiln operators believe
that demand in this market could increase by more than 10 million tires per
year. If all existing plants were to utilize tires as a fuel, this market
could consume up to 24 million tires annually. <BR>
<BR>
The increase in combustion of tires in cement kilns may be partially offset
due to the possible closure of the Modesto Energy Project, a major market
for waste tires. Its purchase agreement with PG&amp;E expires in the spring
of 1998, and since the cost of producing electricity at this facility is
not currently competitive with other sources of electricity, its contract
may not be renewed. The facility, located in Westley, California combusts
up to 5 million tires annually. <BR>
<BR>
There are new and existing markets for crumb rubber that may divert more
tires in the near future. Rubberized asphalt, in addition to other applications
for crumb rubber such as molded rubber products and soil amendment, could
divert additional tires. In addition, devulcanized rubber offers the hope
that any decline in combustion could be offset by increased diversion through
this application. However, it is not possible to accurately predict the degree
to which these other end uses can make up for the loss of the electrical
generating facility in Westley. An additional 3-4 million tires could be
diverted through the above methods within the next 2-3 years.<BR>
<BR>
Based on the above analysis, the overall demand for waste tires in California
could potentially increase by up eight or nine million tires during the next
few years.
<P>
Specific end-use markets are discussed below.<BR>

</B><BR>
Many tires still have useful tread life after they have been replaced by
new tires. In California, an estimated 1.5 million tires were reused in 1995.
In addition, another 2.7 million tires were retreaded in California in 1995.
There is also a strong export market to Mexico, China, and India for reusable
tires. Roughly 1.7 million tires were exported in 1995 for retread/reuse
or processing into crumb rubber. <BR>

Tires are an attractive alternative to coal at cement kilns because they
generate revenue from tipping fees (10-25 cents/tire, where as coal costs
approximately $30.00/ton). In addition, they have a higher Btu content than
coal and hence burn cleaner and reduce emissions of "criteria air pollutants"
(pollutants such as SO<SUB>2</SUB> and NOx for which emission standards have
been set). Tire incineration at cement kilns also eliminates processing costs
associated with recycling or landfilling. Specifically, tires must be processed
to produce crumb rubber and by law must be cut or shredded prior to landfilling.
Another advantage to combustion at cement kilns is that there is no residue
to dispose of since the ash is incorporated into the cement. On the downside,
however, cost savings may not be realized if hauling distances are too long.

One area which offers more diversion potential for tires is the crumb rubber
market. Approximately 1.8 million tires were diverted from disposal in 1995
through crumb rubber applications. End uses included rubberized asphalt,
molded products, mats and playground covers, speed bumps, carpet pads, and
soil amendments.
<P>
Of the above end uses, rubberized asphalt has the greatest market potential.
However, the elimination of the federal requirement that states use rubberized
asphalt in federally-funded highway projects has slowed development of this
market. Nevertheless, 10 percent of all asphalt placed by CalTrans is rubberized
asphalt. The Board estimates that rubberized asphalt could annually divert
up to 5 million waste tires generated in California. In addition, existing
rubberized asphalt paving projects have shown that the material has better
engineering properties and longer life than conventional asphalt.
<P>
Recent technological improvements in crumb rubber production allow smaller
particle sizes, which have wider applications in molded rubber and composite
products. With increases of production capacity, and the consequent increased
supply of quality crumb rubber feedstock at a lower cost, recycled-content
rubber products could become more price-competitive with virgin rubber
products.<BR>
<BR>
Another important emerging use of crumb rubber is as a soil amendment. When
tilled into the soil, crumb rubber improves porosity and the ability of air,
water, and fertilizers to penetrate to plant root zones. School athletic
playing fields are a large potential market, but it is currently hampered
by tight school budgets. <BR>

An undetermined amount of waste tires are diverted through civil engineering
applications. Demonstration projects have proven that tires cut in half like
a bagel and buried under the surface of planted areas (golf courses for example)
help trap moisture and fertilizers, thus resulting in significant cost savings
since water and fertilizer have to be applied less frequently. Other civil
engineering applications for whole or cut tires include sound wall barriers,
leachate collection systems, artificial reefs, slope stability/erosion control,
and road base. In addition, crumb rubber has been used to manufacture railroad
ties and speed bumps. <BR>

<B><I> Potential <A NAME="Markets">Markets</A></I><BR>
</B><BR>
In addition to diverting more tires through incineration and rubberized asphalt,
there are three other technologies that are being further developed that
have the potential to divert a significant quantity of used tires.
<P>
Pyrolysis (heat in the absence of oxygen) is the thermal distillation of
waste tires. However, there are currently few markets for the products of
pyrolysis (oil, gas, carbon black and steel), principally because the revenue
from the sale of the products does not cover the cost of producing them.
<BR>
<BR>
Gasification is a thermal process that turns a percentage of the scrap tire
into a salable gas. However, once again, because of the high cost of production,
there is currently no commercially viable market developed for this product.
<BR>
<BR>
Devulcanization is the chemical breakdown of the bonds that provides rubber
with its structural integrity. New chemical processes for devulcanizing tires
offers the promise of reusing "delinked" polymers in new thermoset products.
Previously, thermoset products were not recyclable because chemical bonding
of polymer chains prevented their recycling through melting and reforming
into new products. The major advantage to devulcanization is the ability
to take old tires and break them down chemically into a feedstock which could
be used to make new tires and other rubber products. Tire manufacturers believe
that new tires may be manufactured with up to 10 percent recycled content
within the next two to three years.<BR>
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B>IV. &nbsp;Market <A NAME="Barriers">Barriers</A> </B> <BR>
<P>
The cost advantage of using tires over coal as a fuel at cement kilns is
substantial and has supported this active market for waste tires. However,
this market has been impacted by recent concerns about emissions of toxic
air contaminants which may pose a significant cancer risk (which EPA defines
as a risk of more than one cancer case per million people) to people living
near cement kilns. To help evaluate this risk, the Board will contract for
a study to determine the level of emissions from cement kilns of hazardous
air pollutants. This study will help identify any necessary pollution control
technologies required to reduce emissions to safe levels.<BR>
<BR>
There are four main barriers to crumb rubber markets:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>
    High cost of collection, sorting, and processing.<BR>
  <LI>
    Emerging markets that are underdeveloped. <BR>
  <LI>
    Public health concerns over incineration and paving with rubberized
    asphalt.<BR>
  <LI>
    Perception of recycled-content products as inferior.<BR>
</UL>
<P>
In order for tire recyclers to operate a profitable business they must charge
retailers for the collection of used tires to subsidize the processing of
waste tires for reuse or recycling. Typically, tire recyclers receive 65-75
cents per tire to pick them up from a retailer. Often, they are underbid
by illegal tire haulers who dispose of the tires at unpermitted storage piles
or dumps and avoid paying tipping fees for tire handling and disposal. To
combat illegal disposal and put illegal haulers out of business for good,
markets for waste tires are needed. If markets could be developed to increase
the value of waste tires, then recyclers could be price competitive with
illegal haulers for the tires, or at some point maybe even offer money to
retailers for the scrap tire. <BR>
<BR>
Once the tires are picked up by recyclers, reusable tires that still have
tread life are sorted from the remaining tires, which will be used for
manufacture into other products. The sorting and processing costs associated
with manufacturing new products, whether its whole or cut tire civil engineering
application or for crumb rubber uses, often makes the product more expensive
than products made from virgin rubber feedstocks. Once again, better markets
could help tire recyclers realize economies of scale to bring down their
unit costs and be more price competitive with virgin rubber products.<BR>
<BR>
Public health concerns may also prove to be a barrier in the cement kiln
and rubberized asphalt market. Exposure to toxic air pollutants which may
be generated when tires are incinerated could limit the amount of tires being
diverted to cement kilns. This issue came up during a recent successful lawsuit
brought by Greenpeace against a kiln operator. The court ruled that the operator
had to revise its local permits in compliance with the requirements of the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) prior to burning tires at its
facility. The main concern to be addressed in the CEQA review was public
exposure to carcinogens such as dioxin in the air emissions from the facility.
There have also been worker health and safety problems during rubberized
asphalt paving projects. Specifically, exposure to the off-gasses resulting
from heating of the rubberized asphalt have made workers ill. This impact
must be addressed in order to promote rubberized asphalt on a wide scale.<BR>
<BR>
Another market barrier to waste tire recycling is the perception of products
manufactured with recycled content as inferior. Some people believe that
recycled content products are not as durable nor as reliable as products
made from virgin materials. On the manufacturing side, some product designers
prefer to use virgin rubber with established physical properties, and are
hesitant to use recycled rubber because of supply and quality concerns. However,
waste tire processors have proven that with improved technologies now available
they are able to meet supply and quality specifications.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the above market barriers, another issue to consider is that
the Board's grant program favors urban areas over rural areas, because a
primary consideration in awarding grant is the number of tires that the proposed
project will divert. Obviously, urban areas will have significantly more
tires to divert than rural areas.

<B> V. &nbsp;<A NAME="Strategies">Strategies</A> to Overcome Market Barriers
<BR>
</B>
<P>
The solution to the waste tire problem is market development. In general,
spending available State funding on site clean up and tire hauler enforcement
will not address the problem. Market development for waste tires is the only
long-term, viable solution to tire disposal, both legal and illegal.
<P>
The two primary growth markets for waste tires are as fuel for cement kilns
and feedstock for crumb rubber applications. The Board should focus its waste
tire market development activities toward these two markets in the short
term. However, the Board should also consider medium to long-term market
development activities in the area of pyrolysis and devulcanization. If the
latter two markets were to become economically competitive, then significant
new markets would be opened for waste tires. In conclusion, the Board should
pursue the following strategies.<BR>
<P>

<B>VI. &nbsp;<A NAME="Summary">Summary</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
Each year California, because of its large population and business community,
generates tens of millions of waste tires. There are currently three main
markets for these waste tires, as a fuel at cement kilns; reusable and
retreadable tires; and as a feedstock for crumb rubber producers. Unfortunately,
these and other markets are insufficient to divert all of the waste tires
generated. Nevertheless, well over half the waste tires are currently being
diverted from landfilling or stockpiling (both legal and illegal). <BR>
<BR>
To promote markets for waste tires, and hence increase diversion from disposal,
the Board should assist cement kiln operators in performing emissions testing
to address concerns about hazardous air pollutants; and encourage the use
of crumb rubber in rubberized asphalt and as a feedstock for a variety of
rubber products. In addition to the above, the Board should consider promoting
methods for the efficient collection and processing of waste tires. And finally,
the Board should encourage public and private buy recycled promotional activities
to stimulate consumer demand for recycled-content rubber products.

<B>I.</B> &nbsp;<A NAME="Intro"><B>Introduction </B> <BR>
<BR>
</A>Assembly Bill 939 and subsequent related legislation brought an unprecedented
and growing supply of secondary materials to the marketplace.<SUP>1</SUP>
Even if California achieves 10 percent waste prevention, there are still
about 12-13 million tons <I>per year</I> of postconsumer materials (in excess
of what is currently being diverted) that must be diverted from California
landfills to achieve the 50 percent goal by the year 2000.<SUP>2</SUP> To
prevent their eventual return to the landfill, these materials must be
manufactured into new products, and these new products must be purchased
by consumers. Developing end markets for these recycled-content products
(RCP) is crucial to achieving the goals of AB 939 and building a self-sustaining
secondary material market in California.
<P>
An efficient and fully developed manufacturing infrastructure that will use
collected secondary material is crucial.
<P>
However, this relatively new market faces the problems of any new market:
the industry is reluctant to increase investments in infrastructure without
a proven demand for recycled products, and unless supply and pricing become
more predictable, there will not be a reliable demand for such products.
Therefore, for this market to remain viable as the supply of secondary (and
especially postconsumer) material increases, the demand for RCPs must be
augmented. While the Legislature mandates several public and private programs
designed to increase RCP manufacture and demand, demand has not kept pace
with supply in the manner needed to attain the 50 percent diversion goal
established by AB 939.
<P>
The benefits of increased RCP purchases are multidimensional: economic
development, resource conservation, and a more flexible and revitalized economy.
Therefore, the Board has been mandated to develop a private buy recycled
program (Public Resources Code [PRC] sections 42600 and 40507, and Public
Contract Code [PCC] section 12153) and the State Agency Buy Recycled Campaign
(PCC &#167;&#167; 10507.5 - 12225).
<P>
Both the private and State buy recycled efforts must be focused and coordinated
to overcome obstacles to buying recycled. As identified in the Board adopted
"Private Buy Recycled Strategy," today's barriers include low consumer awareness,
inadequate information, and concerns about RCP quality, reliable availability,
and competitive prices. Few changes in these barriers have occurred in the
past year so the Board's current buy recycled programs are still appropriate
and relevant.<BR>
<BR>
  <HR>
<P>
<B>II.&nbsp;</B><A NAME="PrivBuy"><B>Private Buy Recycled Strategy <BR>
</B></A>
<P>
To overcome the barriers identified above, the Board adopted a "Private Buy
Recycled Strategy" in January 1995. The essence of this strategy is to harness
the purchasing power of individual companies by creating alliances among
private industry, local government, and other involved parties. The strategy
calls for five alliances: <BR>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Motion Picture and Television Industry
  <LI>
    Organics
  <LI>
    Paper
  <LI>
    Building and Construction
  <LI>
    Plastics
</UL>
<P>
The Plastics Alliance is on hold due to resource constraints. These alliances
will promote RCPs, waste reduction, and secondary material resource collection.
Typical stakeholders include consumers, haulers, processors, manufacturers,
vendors, local and State government, and nonprofit groups. A stakeholder
is any party that is significantly involved in the recycling loop.
<P>
To break down RCP purchasing barriers and close the recycling loop, the
stakeholders within these alliances must work together to understand and
address each other's needs. Alliances establish recycled procurement goals
for their members to increase the demand for RCPs and improve markets for
collected materials. At the same time, stakeholders may also set goals for
collection of recyclable materials. Finally, stakeholders look for solutions
to the barriers related to the collection of secondary materials and the
procurement of RCPs.
<P>
To support the strategy, the Board's Private Buy Recycled Program is creating
a variety of outreach materials intended for the public and private sector.
The materials include a resource guide of model procurement and waste management
practices of businesses; sustainable building case studies; and the
Recycled-Content Product Database database.
<P>
The Recycled-Content Product Database is mandated by PRC &#167; 42600(d),
which requires the Board to develop a directory of California vendors of
recycled products. The database, which contains about 10,000 listings of
recycled-content products, is now complete and is accessible on the Internet.
The RCP Database can be queried on several different fields to focus searches
and returns a random sample of up to five companies that meet the search
criteria.
<P>
The five alliances are organized around specific commodities (e.g., paper
and organics) and multiple materials (e.g., building and construction, office,
and automotive supplies). The alliances focus on important components of
the waste stream necessary to achieve the goals of the California Integrated
Waste Management Act and overcome the barriers to RCP procurement.
<CENTER>

<P>
<A NAME="MotionPic"><B><I> Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers
</I></B></A>
<P>
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) is a coalition
of the major studios and supporting businesses in the film and television
industry. The movie/television industry is participating in some of its own
buy&#173;recycled promotions, including development of a Web page that will
list environmentally preferred products used specifically by studios and
related businesses. Several studios have dedicated environmental coordinators.
Two studios, Warner Brothers and Disney, are members of the Recycled Paper
Coalition. While Board staff remains accessible to AMPTP, workload priorities
dictate an "as needed" role with this Coalition.
<CENTER>
  <B>____________________ </B><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<I><A NAME="RPaprCoal"><B> Recycled Paper Coalition </B></A> </I>
<P>
Because paper represents 40 percent of the waste stream, the Recycled Paper
Coalition is a high priority for the Buy Recycled Program. Staff has supported
the alliance in a variety of ways, including assistance in membership drives
and developing model programs. The coalition has over 200 members nationwide.
This voluntary organization of paper-users includes on its Board of Directors:
Bank of America, Chevron, PG&amp;E, Hewlett-Packard, Salomon Brothers, George
Lithograph, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and The Gap, Inc. Among
its other member corporations are Raley's, Warner Brothers, Disney, Tower
Records, and the Xerox Corporation.
<P>
The national coalition's 1995 Annual Report became available in May 1996.
Coalition members reported purchases of over 140,000 tons of environmentally
preferred paper in 1995, equating to 46,000 tons of postconsumer waste paper
diverted from landfills. Members also reported recycling over 144,000 tons
of office paper. More than 190,000 tons were, therefore, diverted from landfills.
Nationally, this is about 0.1 percent of the waste stream.
<P>
There are now three California Chapters: Northern California (primarily the
Bay Area and Central Coast); Central Valley (Redding through the Valley);
and Southern California (everything else). The Northern California Chapter
also acts as the National Chapter and accounts for 70 percent of the national
membership.
<P>
Both the Southern California and Central Valley chapters need assistance
to increase their membership. In particular, the Southern California chapter
has experienced a tremendous impact from slow regional economic recovery
and consequent downsizing and mergers. These conditions have resulted in
high turnover of coalition board members. Members representing companies
in flux, of necessity, have curtailed coalition participation for higher
priorities. The Central Valley Chapter is virtually brand new.
<P>
During 1995, California coalition members purchased about 65,000 tons of
environmentally preferred paper that averaged 35 percent postconsumer by
weight. California members reported recycling about 84,000 tons of office
paper. This means that over 106,000 tons were diverted from disposal (0.2
percent of the California waste stream).
<CENTER>
  <B>____________________ </B><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="Greenbldg"><B><I>Model Green Building Projects</I></B></A>
<P>
To address the coalition membership drive needs, the Board funded $10,000
for a demonstration Model Green Building Project in Glendale, California.
The project's purpose is to provide a complete loop recycling system, from
prevention to procurement, in office parks or multitenant office buildings.
The primary criterion for building or complex selection was that it had at
least one high-profile anchor business. (In Glendale, Allstate Insurance
is the primary tenant buildings managed by Coldwell Banker's CB Commercial.)
The businesses in the tower or complex also had to agree to join the Recycled
Paper Coalition in return for assistance in setting up recycling programs,
designed for overall cost savings to the participating businesses.
<P>
Board staff expects to promote the program widely, with the belief that other
companies will want to do similar programs when they see what others are
able to do. Based on the results of similar model programs, there appear
to be financial incentives for high volume paper generators to develop a
closed-loop recycling system. The contractor for the Glendale Project RSI,
Inc. reports that their highly successful pilot project in Woodland Hills
recycled 7,100 tons in 1995, for a diversion rate of 65 percent. In addition
to avoiding disposal costs, the Woodland Hills tenants obtained $1 million
in revenue from sale of recyclables. Sixty-three percent of new products
purchased by the tenant association members were RCPs at an average 12 percent
savings, on all office products purchased through their group efforts.
<P>
The Glendale Project was kicked off on July 24, 1996, at a press event and
continental breakfast for the employees. The Mayor of Glendale and other
local dignitaries, Board Member Wesley&nbsp;Chesbro, and representatives
of the Recycled Paper Coalition and Bank of America attended the event.
<P>
A contract concept for $25,000 was approved by the Board on May&nbsp;29,
1996, to sponsor two more projects, one in the Central Valley and a second
one in Southern California. The advisors are currently reviewing the Scope
of Work of the RFP, and if the contract remains on schedule, it will be let
by December.

<I><A NAME="OrganicAll"><B> Organics Alliance </B></A> </I>
<P>
Although the Board is not involved in any formal Organics Alliance, Buy Recycled
staff is currently promoting the use of urban organic materials through five
agricultural demonstrations. Cooperating farmers in Alameda, Fresno, Monterey,
San Benito, Santa&nbsp;Clara, Stanislaus, and Tulare counties have established
demonstration trials using compost or mulch in their agricultural production.
Commercial crops of broccoli, cauliflower, cotton, grapes, green peppers,
hay, lettuce, onions, peaches, strawberries, sweet corn, tomatoes, watermelons,
avocados, and nursery stocks are grown in soil amended or mulched with materials
made primarily from yard trimmings. The five compost demonstrations in Northern
California are progressing very positively and are scheduled to submit their
final reports by March 31, 1997. Findings will be shared with the public
later in 1997.
<P>
A sixth agricultural demonstration will be conducted in Southern California
with local government financial partners (Los Angeles, San Diego and Santa
Barbara) over a two-year period. John Menge of U.C. Riverside with the City
of San Diego, Ventura Couty, Santa&nbsp;Barbara County, and the Coachella
Valley will establish avocado and citrus orchard sites using urban mulch.
<P>
The Private Buy Recycled Strategy indicates that both the compost quality
standards workshops and the compost demonstration projects need to be completed
before any Organics Alliance is formed. The California Compost Quality Council
is now under contract with the Board to develop and implement voluntary compost
quality guidelines.
<P>
Efforts to promote the use of urban compost by California agriculture continue
through the Waste Prevention and Market Development Division's compost outreach
activities. Staff provides informational handout material at several farm
shows and agricultural workshops each year. The need for the formation of
an organics alliance or regional alliances will be addressed in the future
depending on the success of the other activities fulfilling the same objective.

<A NAME="BldgConst"><B><I> Building and Construction Alliance </I></B></A>
<P>
Staff has been working with several local governments, community groups,
and trade associations to promote the formation of regional building and
construction alliances. Included are alliances in Alameda, Santa Barbara,
Los Angeles and San Diego counties. In each case, the potential to overcome
barriers, implement solutions, and then share those approaches statewide
appears to be good. To meet this potential, we are convening stakeholders
based upon specific projects on a regional basis identified from the entire
building and construction arena.
<P>
To provide a better foundation for alliance formation, staff is planning
to market the Board's RCP Database, and other Buy Recycled Program resources
and services related to the use of recycled-content building products. Staff
has targeted the Southern California Building Industry Association (BIA)
for initial outreach efforts.<BR>
<P>
<B>Santa Barbara Regional Alliance</B>
<P>
Staff has been working in partnership with an existing alliance, the
Sustainability Project (TSP) in Santa Barbara. TSP is a consortium of several
public and private groups: Committee on the Environment of the Santa Barbara
Chapter of the American Institute of Architects; the Architectural Foundation
of Santa Barbara; the Community Environmental Council; and the Renewable
Energy Institute (affiliated with California Polytechnic State University,
San Luis Obispo).
<P>
The primary purposes of the TSP are to promote education and research regarding
sustainability, to build community awareness and consensus regarding the
elements of sustainability, and to encourage the development of sustainable
communities. The TSP Board of Directors includes architects, urban and city
planners, interior designers, engineers, building contractors, landscape
architects, and government officials.
<P>
In June, Buy Recycled staff assisted TSP in organizing and presenting their
successful "Green Building Now" Conference and Trade Show in Santa Barbara.
Staff contributed to the effort by converting and standardizing hard copy
mass mailing lists to electronic databases, designed and printed brochures,
performed mass mailings to potential participants, and made follow-up calls
to potential exhibitors. In addition, Board staff moderated workshops and
assisted in registration duties. The Conference highlighted sustainable building
techniques, case studies, construction waste management, and builder programs.
About 350 participants attended. In addition, about 50 manufacturers and
distributors of sustainable products exhibited at the conference. This conference
and vendor show will serve as a model for other communities planning to host
sustainability conferences.<BR>
<P>
<B>Southern California Regional Alliances</B>
<P>
Staff has contacted the Southern California chapter of the Building Industry
Association (BIA). Staff worked with the BIA on an article promoting the
use of RCBPs in their newsletter and informed Chapter members of the availability
of the RCP Database. Staff will follow up by contacting each regional chapter
to offer a presentation concerning the Board's RCP database, guidelines and
information related to the use of RCBPs in sustainable design. Staff hopes
to repeat the approach with BIA Chapters and other key building and construction
trade organizations throughout California.
<P>
Staff is pursuing a partnership with the City of San Diego for the construction
of a mobile Environmental Office Display. This project will demonstrate the
use of environmentally preferable building materials and office products,
including recycled-content products such as those used in the Ridgehaven
building retrofit. The Board contributed $10,000 to pay for a portion of
the project costs. The display will be constructed on a mobile trailer chassis
to allow the exhibit to be towed to various outreach events throughout
California. Staff will be negotiating a MOU with the City of San Diego to
allow the Board to use the exhibit for three months each year by targeting
Northern California events.
<P>
Staff is collaborating with the City of Los Angeles Board of Public Works
to address sustainability in construction and waste management issues for
the Playa Vista project. Playa Vista is the largest undeveloped tract in
the City limits (1,087 acres) and includes the Ballona Wetlands. Current
plans for Playa Vista include the new Dreamworks Studio (600,000 square feet
of space), 13,085 high density residential units, 5 million square feet of
office and studio space, 600,000 sq ft of neighborhood retail space, 750
hotel rooms, 560,000 sq ft of community buildings, and a new boat basin.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>III.</B> &nbsp;<A NAME="Campaign"><B>State Agency Buy Recycled Campaign
</B></A>
<P>
The public sector consumes approximately 20 percent of the goods in California,
and many of these goods are not of recycled content; thus, encouragement
of RCP procurement by State agencies could have a major effect. To promote
State government purchase of RCPs, the Board is also implementing the State
Agency Buy Recycled Campaign (SABRC). State agencies must meet three procurement
mandates and report their success in meeting them: <BR>
<UL>
  <LI>
    By January 1, 1997, at least 25 percent of the total fine printing and writing
    paper purchased or procured shall be recycled paper.<BR>
  <LI>
    By January 1, 1997, at least 50 percent of the total dollar amount of paper
    products purchased or procured shall have recycled content.<BR>
  <LI>
    By January 1, 1997, at least 20 percent, and by January 1, 1998, at least
    30 percent, and by January 1, 2000, at least 50 percent of the total dollar
    amount of purchases made by each State agency shall be recycled product
    purchases. RCPs must be purchased from within the 11 product categories listed
    in the legislation. <BR>
</UL>
<P>
Barriers to RCP procurement are similar in both the public and private sectors:
low consumer awareness, inadequate information, and concerns about RCP quality,
reliable availability, and competitive prices also exist in the public
procurement arena.
<P>
To overcome these barriers, staff provides a variety of assistance to State
agencies. The Board purchased 120 copies of the Official Recycled Product
Guide (RPG) and provided one, free of charge, to each of the state agency
contacts that staff has identified. The Board has also created an automated
procurement tracking and reporting Application. This Application enables
the user to electronically record and report RCP purchases, as well as purchases
made from any number of specific companies or types of companies. It can
be used to identify and track product preferences, tax, shipping, and/or
purchases from target groups such as Small, Disabled Veteran, and Minority
Owned Businesses. This Application will also be available, free of charge,
to any interested local government agency or private business.
<P>
Another developing feature of the SABRC is the advertisement of RCPs available
through the Department of General Services (DGS), Office of Procurement.
Staff is encouraging the placement of procurement information on DGS's Internet
homepage and on the Purchasing Information Network (PIN). Typical information
to be listed includes:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>
    RCPs available from statewide contracts.
  <LI>
    RCPs available from State Stores.
  <LI>
    RCPs available from State price schedule.
  <LI>
    RCPs available from the Prison Industry Authority.
  <LI>
    RCPs available from federal contracts.
  <LI>
    RCPs available from California Multiple Awards Schedule.
  <LI>
    Manufacturers, wholesalers, and vendors of RCPs. <BR>
</UL>
<P>
The Board is in the process of receiving the second annual Recycled-Content
Product Procurement Report in which each State agency reports the RCP purchases
made during the previous fiscal year. Eighty-one percent (105/129) of State
agencies submitted FY 94/96 reports. Of these reports, 23 percent (24/105)
met all three of the procurement mandates. The FY 94/95 reports indicated
over $20,000,000 was spent on RCPs. Staff anticipates the FY 95/96 Reports
to show an increase in RCP expenditures by state agencies.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B>IV.</B><A NAME="Strategies"><B> Strategies </B></A>
<P>
To further promote the Board's Buy Recycled Program, the Board should undertake
the strategies described in this section.
<P>
Continue to encourage RCP procurement and the implementation of waste management
strategies by the private sector through the formation of alliances. This
partnership approach should be cost-effective because it leverages State
resources with private sector effort. Primary Board efforts should focus
on supporting alliance activities (vendor shows, workshops, developing model
programs), and assisting in membership drives and alliance formation initiatives.
<P>
When forming new alliances, seek these partnerships with interested and active
local governments. Staff has learned that the success of an alliance relies
heavily on the involvement of local government. Future alliances should continue
to focus on the paper, building and construction, and organics sectors.
<P>
Where appropriate, implement the "model green building" approach through
the alliances. This is a comprehensive approach where businesses in a business
park or office tower each seek to implement strategies through the entire
recycling loop-waste prevention to procurement. This approach can result
in a greater number of businesses implementing waste management strategies,
greater savings seen through avoided disposal costs and recycling revenues,
and greater procurement savings. This approach is recommended because it
is sometimes difficult to get businesses to attend workshops on recycled
content product procurement and waste management strategies. The "model green
building" approach may help to overcome this problem.
<P>
Maintain the RCP database that currently lists 10,000 recycled-content products
and is linked to the Internet. Staff should promote the use of the database
as a marketing tool for manufacturers and the use of it as a procurement
tool for consumers.
<P>
Facilitate limited life-cycle analyses for products such as recycled-content
latex paint and rubberized asphalt to increase our knowledge of why RCPs
should be preferred over virgin products. These findings should then be shared
with prospective public and private consumers through the Board's outreach
programs.
<P>
Work with local governments to identify and eliminate local ordinances and
codes that pose barriers to the use of RCPs. Promote or coordinate product
testing and specification development for recycled-content building products.
<P>
Publicize success stories by continuing to produce case studies on sustainable
buildings; procurement successes in the private and public sectors; and model
ordinances, contract language, and specifications. Increase publicity for
jurisdictions and businesses who are successfully procuring recycled-content
products. To highlight successes, use trade journals, press releases, local
outreach mechanisms, awards programs of trade associations, etc.
<P>
Actively coordinate the implementation of the State Agency Buy Recycled Campaign
with the Department of General Services. This entails overcoming resistance
on the part of DGS to implement this program.<BR>
<BR>
  <HR>
<P>
<B>V.</B> &nbsp;<A NAME="Summary"><B>Summary </B></A>
<P>
Barriers to the procurement of recycled-content products (RCP) include: low
consumer awareness, inadequate information, and concerns about RCP quality,
reliable availability, and competitive prices. Staff recommends the following
solutions: continue the implementation of the Private Buy Recycled Strategy
and the State Agency Buy Recycled Campaign.
<P>
These efforts bring stakeholders together to discuss implementation of
comprehensive "close the loop" programs from prevention to procurement. The
focus is on products made from the largest sectors of the waste stream (paper,
building and construction, and organics) and plastics.

<B>I. &nbsp;<A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A> </B> <B> <BR>
<BR>
</B> Economic development is an important consideration in the diversion
of solid waste from landfills. Once the materials are diverted from landfills,
the next step is to develop sustainable markets for those materials. To
accomplish the development of sustainable markets for these materials, the
California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) has developed two closely
linked economic development programs to assist businesses that manufacture
new products from recyclable materials: the Recycling Market Development
Zones (RMDZ) and the Recycling Business Assistance Team (R-Team).
<P>
In response to the concerns leading to the passage of Assembly Bill 939 (Sher,
Stats. 1989, ch. 1095), the State of California established the Recycling
Market Development Zone (RMDZ) program. Authorized by Senate Bill 1322 (Bergeson,
Stats. 1989, ch. 1096), the program objective was to create markets for diverted
materials by increasing the use of recycled materials as manufacturing feedstock.
<P>
This was the first program in the nation to couple established economic
development practices with integrated waste management efforts. The program
was intended to provide local governments with a tool to reduce dependence
on diminishing landfill space and meet the waste diversion goals of AB 939
by working with the private manufacturing sector.
<P>
Subsequently, the R-Team was developed as a result of a U.S. EPA grant in
late 1994. The R-Team's goal is, to provide recycling manufacturing businesses
in California with coordinated business development, technical, financial
and marketing assistance. This is done by linking other programs and agencies
with expertise in those areas. Two major linkages are referring R-Team businesses
wishing to locate in California to the RMDZs and providing additional services
as needed to the businesses within the RMDZs.
<P>
To qualify for RMDZ designation, jurisdictions were required to identify
local incentives that they could provide to businesses that manufacture with
secondary materials. Some incentives included site selection, tax benefits,
permit assistance, local low-interest loan programs, and marketing and business
plan assistance. The R-Team supplements these with additional services and
information.
<P>
In exchange for local commitments to fostering recycling-based manufacturers,
the Board provides technical assistance to both the zone administrators and
the businesses requesting assistance and low- interest loans. The Board and
R-Team offer services to local RMDZ staff such as training; "matchmaking"
(linking recycled feedstock suppliers to users); technical information, (such
as the plastics clearinghouse and lists of construction and demolition businesses
that use recycled materials); market data on various secondary materials;
and networking opportunities through Board-sponsored workshops.
<P>
Since March 1991, the Board has established 40 RMDZs, the maximum allowed.
As a result of Board and local government efforts, the RMDZs are distributed
throughout the state, and represent both urban and rural jurisdictions including
66 percent of the state's population.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B> II. &nbsp;<A NAME="Objectives">Objectives</A> and Strategies </B>
<P>
Based on the evaluation of the programs to date and on assessing the need
to reach 50 percent diversion by the year 2000, the goal of the Board's
industrial market development programs for the next two to three years should
be to create a strong and sustainable secondary materials-based industry
throughout California, capable of absorbing an estimated 27 million tons
of recovered materials each year. This is the total amount estimated by the
Board as necessary to achieve the 50 percent diversion rate by the year 2000.
<BR>
<BR>
To achieve this goal, the Board must take a focused, proactive approach,
which seeks to identify businesses and business opportunities for "getting
to 50 percent." This includes implementing an aggressive marketing strategy
which sets the agenda for targeting candidate businesses, and pursuing them
by offering the services they need to be able to feasibly use recycled materials
in manufacturing and marketing recycled-content products.
<P>
A primary goal of the Recycling Market Development Zone Program is to generate
$10 million in initial loan applications and approximately $3 million in
closed loans per quarter, or $40 million in applications and $12 million
in closed loans per year. This is a preliminary goal subject to ratification
or modification when staff brings forward the RMDZ marketing strategy. <BR>
<BR>
At its April 24, 1996 meeting, the Board set the following objectives for
the RMDZ program and recommendations for achieving them. These objectives
and recommended actions are based on, and are intended to address the issues
raised in the Board's program evaluation surveys and other information gathering
efforts.
<CENTER>
  ____________________<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B> Extend the <A NAME="RMDZ">RMDZ</A> Loan Program<BR>
</B> <BR>
The Board should ensure the extension of the RMDZ Loan Program through the
year 2005 in accordance with the Board's May 1995 recommendations to the
Legislature, including authorization to participate in the California Capital
Access Program (CalCAP).<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Strategies</I><BR>
<BR>
</B>The Board should continue to work to secure the extension of the RMDZ
loan program, consistent with its May 1995 recommendations, including seeking
the ability to leverage its funds by enabling it to participate in CalCAP.<BR>
<BR>
The Board should continue to consider other leveraging mechanisms when available
to increase the amount of loan funds available to it.
<CENTER>
  ____________________<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B> Increase <A NAME="Awareness">Awareness</A> of Programs </B>
<P>
The Board must increase awareness of the RMDZ program and the development
of recycling-based businesses in the zones.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Strategies</I><BR>
<BR>
</B>In the spring of 1996, the Board should consider, adopt, and begin
implementation of a marketing strategy for the RMDZ program that makes efficient
use of limited funds and maximizes the leveraging of outside resources to
inform the manufacturing community of the benefits offered. This strategy
should be directed first at the zones and their surrounding communities;
second, at the rest of California; and third, at other states and countries.
<P>
The focus of the marketing strategy should be to aggressively identify candidate
manufacturers who could benefit from the RMDZ program and who could best
assist local governments in reaching their diversion mandates under AB 939.
<P>
Toward this end, the Board should work proactively with the zones to target
and establish one-on-one working relationships with interested businesses,
to assist those businesses in expanding or converting to the use of recycled
feedstock and/or locating within the zones, while making maximum use of all
available RMDZ services and benefits.
<P>
The Board should provide general promotional materials as part of the strategy.
<P>
The Board should investigate what can be done at the State level to assist
recycling businesses through the local and State permitting processes.
<P>
The Board should evaluate and compare the RMDZ loan program's credit and
collateral requirements with other State and commercial lending programs
and determine if improvements can be made, particularly to encourage smaller,
start-up businesses.
<CENTER>

<B> Provide <A NAME="Technical">Technical</A> Assistance<BR>
<BR>
</B>The Board should provide the zone administrators and recycling-based
manufacturers with "hands-on" technical assistance regarding siting decisions
and regulatory compliance, feedstock information, business planning and
development assistance, financing resources, manufacturing technologies,
and marketing assistance for recycled-content products.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Strategies</I><BR>
<BR>
</B>The Board should inventory the expertise of its staff and that of the
zone staffs, and make a listing of expertise available to provide for mutual
assistance.
<P>
The Board should secure outside consultant services to supplement Board and
zone staff expertise in areas such as business plan development and product
marketing assistance, while seeking to supplement and train staff to minimize
the need for consultant services in the long run. These contracts, which
would provide direct services to RMDZ businesses on an as needed basis, could
be partially funded out of the R-Team monies. R-Team contracts of this nature
are being considered at the Board's May 1996, Administration Committee meeting.
Staff is directed to consider in the scheduled May 1996, Administration Committee
item on R-Team contracts the feasibility of using only R-Team funds for
implementation of the marketing strategy.
<P>
The Board should continue to establish itself as a leader in developing,
evaluating and providing information about recycled feedstock, secondary
materials and recycled-content product market conditions, and recycling
technologies. This should include the publication of quarterly market reports.
<P>
The Board should share information and increase the effectiveness of and
support for the RMDZ programs zone administrators. Staff should compile,
and publish case studies of successful RMDZ program efforts to all zones
and other interested parties, such as local officials, economic development
professionals, and lenders. Case studies should be structured so that they
address specific questions and needs of targeted audiences.
<P>
The Board should encourage its staff and assist the zones in developing working
relationships with other state economic development programs to leverage
their resources. Suggested programs to consult with include the California
Association of Local Economic Developers (CALED), the Trade and Commerce
Agency, the Business Environmental Assistance Center, and various chambers
of commerce in the RMDZs, as well as other small business service providers
such as the Small Business Administration districts and branches and Certified
Development Companies.
<P>
The Board should recognize differences in zone needs and work with individual
zone administrators to provide appropriate services.

<P>
<B><I> Strategies</I></B>
<P>
In light of limited zone resources and the diversity and breadth of training
required, the need for ongoing training, and the desirability of a common
denominator in certain subject areas, the Board should continue to sponsor
and/or approve specific training courses for Board and zone staff. Training
should be conducted on a basis that offers the best economy of scale. Future
training should be considered as part of the Board's overall training program.
<P>
The cost of training of zone staff by the Board should be approved in advance
and reimbursed to the zones for completed courses, within specified dollar
limits and with a minimum required local match of at least 5 percent, either
in cash or in-kind services.

Board and in the zones, to track business contacts and other zone activities
such as materials diverted, jobs created, technical assistance services,
and resources expended. <BR>
<P>
<B><I> Strategies</I></B>
<P>
To provide for more complete and consistent information about program activities
and future program needs, the Board should work with the zones to develop
and institute a uniform business and administrative tracking and reporting
system, such as ACT! (a contact management software) and other appropriate
fiscal record-keeping systems. The use of such systems, when developed, should
be required of the zones by the Board as a condition of financial support.
<P>
Information required semiannually from the zones should include the number
of businesses contacted, type of assistance offered, responses, and results.
The information compiled would be reported to the Board and to the zones
semiannually.
<P>
Staff should work with the California Association of Recycling Market Development
Zones (CARMDZ) to determine the feasibility of developing and implementing
a standardized reporting system, with both computer and manual versions,
without provision of financial incentives by the Board. The computer version
should have a "fill-in-the-blanks" option available in a standard software
program such as Excel.
<P>
Parameters such as jobs retained or created and tons diverted should be
considered as part of any reporting system.

The Board should secure adequate and sustained funding for the RMDZ program
and ensure that the zone and loan programs are implemented efficiently by
the zones at the local level.<BR>
<P>
<B><I> Strategies</I></B>
<P>
The Board should consider appropriate financial support for the RMDZ program
at the State and zone levels as a part of its annual budget process.
<P>
To maximize the amount of capital available for loans, the Board should minimize
paying for loan program administrative costs from the Loan Sub-Account (LSA).
The Board should, also, adopt a policy that specifies when demand for loan
funds exceeds the available supply, the Board shall avoid paying for any
and all costs from the LSA for activities other than directly funding loans.
Staff is directed to provide the Market Development Committee with information
on Board administrative costs allocated in the RMDZ LSA and on procedures
for making this allocation.
<P>
To help provide adequate and sustained program funding, the Board should
actively seek to obtain federal funds and other financial support to supplement
the zones' and the Board's program resources.
<P>
The Board should assist the zones in seeking increased local funding, by
providing them with information about the program's potential local benefits.
<P>
The Board should continue to evaluate options regarding the establishment
of financial incentives for the zones.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>III. &nbsp;<A NAME="Additional">Additional</A> Strategies<BR>
</B>
<P>
In addition to the recommended actions already approved by the Board, the
Board could adopt any of the following options:
<P>
Pursue legislation to enhance incentives available to recycling-based
manufacturers within RMDZs. Incentives like those available to businesses
in California's Enterprise Zones would strongly encourage manufacturers to
select RMDZs when considering their siting options.
<P>
In order to stimulate the expansion of recycling-based manufacturing by making
such expansions more feasible, the Board could work with local utilities
(such as Sacramento Municipal Utilities District) to encourage them to offer
utility rate discounts similar to those currently offered by Pacific Gas
and Electric, San Diego Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison.
<P>
In order to increase the attractiveness of the RMDZ loan program, the Board
could consider some modifications. These changes could include moving the
application from a quarterly cycle to a continuous process. <BR>

<P>
International trade is a major force in California's economy, currently
accounting for nearly 25 percent of the state's economy. With major port
facilities in the San Francisco and Los Angeles, California is a major gateway
for products entering and leaving the United States. Many goods moving through
California ports, such as industrial and postconsumer secondary materials,
originated in other states. According to the California Trade and Commerce
Agency, California exports of secondary materials have typically exceeded
$1 billion annually.
<P>
This report provides an overview of California's export markets for secondary
materials. The market information for these materials typically does not
explicitly separate postconsumer materials. However, since the majority of
these materials are postconsumer, reviewing the general trends and issues
affecting secondary material markets provides a useful tool for understanding
postconsumer material exports.
<P>
Exports of finished goods made from recycled postconsumer materials will
not be discussed in detail in this report. Exports markets for these products
involve the same types of issues faced by marketers of products made from
virgin materials, such as dealing with U.S. and foreign trade regulations,
committing sufficient resources to determine the best prospects for overseas
markets, and dealing with the more complicated insurance, transportation,
and contractual issues of export sales.
<P>
A major issue surrounding export of secondary materials involves the drawbacks
of shipping industrial feedstocks overseas when they could be used to produce
higher-value goods in the United States. While this debate is important,
the current reality of secondary material markets in California is that large
quantities of material from California and other states are exported through
California because transportation costs to domestic markets are prohibitive,
domestic markets are not available, or foreign markets provide better prices
than domestic markets.
<P>
Overseas export markets for secondary materials have played an important
role in markets for California's postconsumer materials by absorbing large
quantities of the secondary materials generated in California that local
recycling facilities do not provide demand for. With most secondary materials
characterized by high volumes and low values, ready access to overseas markets
has allowed California local governments to collect some types of materials
that other states could not afford to pursue. The most important secondary
materials export markets include those for recovered paper, scrap metal,
scrap plastics, and scrap aluminum.
<P>
Export markets for secondary materials have historically involved significant
demand and price swings. During the peaks of these cycles, competition for
materials can become fierce and export prices can significantly outstrip
prices offered by domestic buyers. These market swings are controlled by
a number of factors, including foreign economic conditions, currency exchange
rates, availability of cargo shipping containers, and stockpiling of materials
by foreign buyers.
<P>
Successful marketing under changing conditions requires understanding and
staying informed of changes in the markets. Nearly all collectors (e.g.,
curbside collection programs, material recovery facilities) and intermediate
processors (e.g., firms which prepare materials by baling, grinding, or shredding
materials) of postconsumer materials choose brokers, export management companies,
or other intermediaries to facilitate their export sales. Brokers typically
handle most aspects of the transaction, from arranging freight, making sure
specifications are met, arranging Letters of Credit, and preparing port and
customs documentation. Some large brokers are also processors who buy substantial
volumes to supply their U.S. recycling facilities and also broker export
shipments when warranted by market conditions. Many export transactions also
involve the services of freight forwarders, who oversee moving cargo to an
international destination and can handle transport, insurance, financing,
and processing of documents necessary for the transaction and movement of
goods. In general, export transactions are significantly more involved than
similar domestic transactions.
<P>
Most of California's secondary material exports leave by ocean freight in
cargo containers through one of the three federal customs districts in
California. These districts track all port, air, truck, and rail exports
within the district. The Los Angeles Customs District stretches from Ventura
to Orange County, and in 1994 became the nation's largest gateway for foreign
trade, with over $146 billion in exports in 1994. The San Francisco and San
Diego customs districts cover the remaining northern and southern parts of
the state. San Francisco exports approximately half as many secondary materials
as Los Angeles and San Diego about one quarter as many.

<P>
<B>II. &nbsp;<A NAME="Supply">Supply and Demand for Exportable Secondary
Materials</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
Significant supplies of secondary materials collected in California for recycling
are exported internationally. However, U.S. Census Bureau export statistics
do not indicate the state of origin for export shipments, making it difficult
to determine the quantity of <I>California-generated</I> secondary materials
available for export. In general, in-state market demand for many secondary
materials such as paper and plastic are insufficient to handle local supplies.
Lower ocean freight rates versus overland shipping to distant domestic markets,
combined with cycles of strong demand from overseas markets have tended have
shaped export markets into the "escape valve" for California-generated secondary
materials.
<P>
Demand for California's secondary material exports is dominated by the rapidly
growing economies of Asia. Korea and Japan account are the largest markets
for California's secondary materials, each exporting over $130 million in
materials during 1994. Other important markets for California secondary materials
include Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, India and Mexico. During 1994, the total
export value of the California secondary materials discussed in this paper
exceeded $700 million.
<P>
These countries use both American and European secondary materials as feedstocks
for their industries. In many of these countries where natural resources
are scarce, imported secondary materials play a vital role in supplying
industrial operations. The remainder of this section will discuss historical
and anticipated demand for selected secondary materials exported from California
port districts. The tables summarize U.S. Census Bureau export data derived
from shipper's export declarations from 1989 through November 1995.

<B><A NAME="Iron">Iron</A> and Steel Scrap</B>
<P>
Scrap iron and steel is the largest and most well-established commodity of
secondary material scrap exported from California. In 1994, approximately
25 percent of U.S. scrap iron and steel exports were shipped from California
port districts with a total value of $337 million. Korea has been the dominant
market for these materials, accounting for 45 percent (632,000 tons) of
California's market.
<P>
Other significant markets have included China, India, Japan, and Malaysia.
Although there are many different types of iron and steel scrap, the principle
types exported from California are listed below.

There is an active and well-established commodity market for waste paper
exports. In 1994, approximately 30 percent of U.S. waste paper exports were
shipped from California port districts with a total value of $230 million.
China, Japan,South Korea, and Taiwan are the primary markets for California
waste paper exports. Lack of forest resources makes these countries extremely
dependent on waste paper as a raw material to manufacture paper and paperboard.

<FONT>California waste paper exports dropped during the early 1990s due to
high ocean freight rates, an increase in European wastepaper exports, and
reduced U.S. merchandise imports causing a shortage of shipping containers
for exports. However, during 1994 and 1995 waste paper exports began increasing,
especially for OCC. This increase in waste paper exports resumed both the
national and California trends of 5 to10 percent annual growth in waste paper
exports since the early 1970s. </FONT>
<P>
Most industry analysts believe demand for U.S. waste paper will hold steady
or increase slowly throughout the remainder of the decade as Asian economies
continue to grow. Listed below are market highlights for several of the waste
paper grades.
<P>
<I><B> Used corrugated containers (OCC).</B></I> Since 1990, South Korean
and Chinese demand for California exports of OCC have increased rapidly,
nearly matching the 20 to30 percent market shares of Japan and Taiwan. Thailand
has emerged as a small but rapidly growing market, capturing nearly 5 percent

<BR>
</B>Plastic scrap has yet to reach status as a true commodity, primarily
because of very low profit margins and wide variations in product quality
due to contaminants. Export markets for plastic scrap include large quantities
of industrial scrap which are significantly more valuable than postconsumer
materials. Nearly all postconsumer scrap exports are classified in export
declarations as "Ethylene" or "Other" categories. Estimates of how much exported
plastic scrap is postconsumer range widely (from 30 to 70 percent) but most
sources do agree the amount has been increasing over time. While costs for
overseas shipping can more than double the cost of plastic scrap, this material
is attractive to foreign processors and manufacturers who generally have
lower processing costs but much higher virgin resin costs than their American
counterparts.
<P>
In 1994, approximately 42 percent of U.S. scrap plastic exports were shipped
from California port districts with a total value of $61 million. Hong Kong
has consistently been the dominant market for California's scrap plastic
exports, accounting for nearly 75 percent of the market in 1994.
<P>
Other markets include Taiwan, China, and the Philippines. Much of Hong Kong
exports are destined for use in small plastic products (e.g., toys) or for
re-export to China. A rapidly developing market in Indonesia was halted in
late 1993 when government officials banned several types of waste and scrap
imports due to concerns about the potentially hazardous nature of the materials.

California exports of aluminum scrap have been characterized by wide swings
in demand since 1989. Japan has been the principal market for both aluminum
used beverage cans (UBC) and other aluminum scrap, although this market dipped
dramatically during the early 1990s, due in part to the Japanese recession
and the availability of less expensive scrap supplies from Russia.

<FONT>California exports of glass scrap and cullet are minimal, with Mexico
and Japan being primary markets. In general, the weight of glass and its
low value increases transportation costs beyond a reasonable return for most
export markets. Even rail or truck transport to the nearby Mexican market
becomes extremely costly when the Mexican value-added tax of 10 to 15 percent
is applied to scrap glass shipments.</FONT>

<FONT>The United States accounts for 45 percent of the world's used clothing
exports. In 1994, approximately 37 percent of U.S. worn clothing exports
were shipped from California port districts with a total value of $84 million.
Mexico accounted for nearly half of this market, with other important markets
including Japan, Pakistan, India, and Chile. Most used clothing is sent abroad
in 100 pound bales for reuse as clothing in developing countries. The
international trade in second-hand clothing is a thriving one. Although U.S.
exports of used textiles have been growing since 1990, California exports
have been relatively stable since 1992, averaging 65-70 thousand tons annually.
Since 1989, the average value of a metric ton of exported used clothing has
ranged around $1,000 per ton, making it one of the more valuable postconsumer
materials.</FONT>

<B>III.</B> &nbsp;<B>Primary Issues Relating to Exports of
<A NAME="Secondary">Secondary</A> Materials</B>
<P>
As stated earlier, California's export market for secondary materials involves
complex interactions between domestic and foreign economic conditions and
processing infrastructures. Below are summaries of the primary issues impacting
export markets for secondary materials.<BR>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Relative">Relative</A> Value of Resources</B>
<P>
Many foreign markets can process secondary materials more cheaply than U.S.
markets due to lower labor and other operating costs. However, lower processing
costs are often counteracted by the cost of overseas shipping. The most important
force driving the value of many secondary materials in foreign markets is
their importance as primary sources of feedstocks for industrial operations.
Many foreign countries have insufficient natural resources or industrial
infrastructure to produce enough virgin feedstocks (e.g., wood pulp, plastic
resin, aluminum) to meet domestic demand. Many foreign countries <I>must</I>
import secondary materials to meet their domestic demand, while most U.S.
industries only use secondary materials as cost-saving substitutes for virgin
materials. Additionally, many Pacific Rim countries manufacture products
from secondary materials for which quality standards are not as strict as
those established by U.S. manufacturers.<BR>
<P>
<B>Market <A NAME="Volatility">Volatility</A></B>
<P>
The volatility of overseas secondary materials markets is based on a number
of factors, most of which are beyond the control of government or private
enterprise, and difficult to predict with any certainty. The extremes of
surges in demand and prices can often mean enormous profits or bankruptcy,
so both foreign and domestic buyers on the West Coast tend to avoid long
term commitments. This creates difficulties for sellers seeking stable demand
for their materials, especially collectors of postconsumer materials that
cannot afford to ship their materials to distant domestic markets. Some analysts
have suggested the periodic cycles of intense demand from export markets
have tended to discourage development of West Coast facilities.<BR>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Transportation">Transportation</A></B>
<P>
Availability of shipping containers can have a pronounced impact on markets.
The U.S. recession in the early 1990s created less demand for Pacific Rim
imports, which meant fewer containers available for exports back to Pacific
Rim countries. In recent years, a general increase in European demand for
Asian products has put more pressure on cargo container availability at West
Coast ports. Some analysts predict that as NAFTA is implemented, rail and
truck transport to Mexico will become easier and less costly, possibly providing
better export opportunities for secondary materials generated or passing
through California.<BR>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Hazardous">Hazardous</A> Waste</B>
<P>
In recent years, concerns about hazardous waste exports from developed to
developing countries has resulted in a number of international agreements
and treaties limiting or banning exports of certain types of hazardous wastes.
The broad terms and vague definitions used in these agreements have created
uncertainty about whether some types of recyclable wastes may be defined
as hazardous. In particular, scrap metals and some plastic scrap exports
are facing intense scrutiny from foreign buyers who must ensure that scrap
materials are not considered hazardous waste by government customs inspectors.
Of particular concern is scrap such as mixed plastic bottles that may contain
hazardous liquid residues.<BR>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Complexity">Complexity</A> of Export Marketing</B>
<P>
Marketing any product to foreign markets requires an extensive and ongoing
knowledge of the product, the country, and many other factors. In California,
most secondary material collectors must rely to some extent on export markets,
and use brokers, export management companies, or other expert intermediaries
to facilitate export sales. Domestic manufacturers of products incorporating
postconsumer materials also face the need to understand the complexities
of foreign markets, but often are young companies without the resources to
study markets or hire export intermediaries. Most of these manufacturers
typically concentrate exclusively less complex domestic markets.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B>IV. &nbsp;<A NAME="Strategies">Strategies</A> Relating to Exports of Secondary
Materials </B>
<P>
As stated at the beginning of this report, exports will continue to play
an important role in providing markets for secondary materials recovered
in California. Periods of low demand and low prices created by exports markets
contribute to undermining the interest of postconsumer material collectors
and processors to establish or expand operations in California. The Board
should continue to aggressively attract and expand local markets for these
materials. Additionally, the Board should pursue the following actions to
assist collectors, processors, and manufacturers in better understanding,
using, and responding to export markets. <BR>
<P>
<B>Promote the Recyclables Exchange</B>
<P>
The Board should advise local governments, generators, and processors of
the availability and capabilities of the recently initiated Chicago Board
of Trade (CBOT) Recyclables Exchange. This computerized bulletin board system
posts nationwide listings from buyers and sellers of recyclable materials,
providing ready access to the markets for secondary materials such as waste
paper and plastic scrap. West Coast markets have yet to make significant
use of this system, which would assist them in tracking domestic (and potentially
foreign) prices and participants in secondary materials markets. The success
of this systems is dependent upon significant participation by market
participants. The Board should aggressively promote use of this system to
make market information readily available. As the market information becomes
more widely available, CBOT will probably develop a futures market for various
secondary materials, which would tend to create more stable markets over
time. Actions the Board should take include:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Subscribe to the exchange to support the system and access detailed information
    about individual trades.
  <LI>
    Encourage active traders to join and use the exchange by providing funding
    for RMDZ Administrators, municipal recycling coordinators, and other generators
    to cover the $1,000 annual subscription fee.
  <LI>
    Conduct or actively assist CBOT in conducting additional workshops for California
    local governments and other interested parties.
  <LI>
    Prepare and publish articles, advertisements, and other printed materials
    about CBOT.<BR>
</UL>
<P>
<B><FONT>Assist Recycled-Content Product Manufacturers</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Many recycled-content product manufacturers are fairly young companies
that may not have had the time or resources to explore potential export markets.
The Board should work closely with and/or enter into an Interagency Agreement
with the Trade and Commerce Agency to provide detailed export marketing
assistance and counseling to recycled-content product manufacturers. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Promote Export Opportunities</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>The Board has limited ability to significantly affect export markets.
However, working in cooperation with federal, state trade and commerce agencies
together with Cal/EPA, the Board can help promote exports-especially to the
fiber-short Pacific Rim nations. The Board should consider opportunities
to expand export markets in cooperation with the other government agencies,
especially for paper, plastics, and metals.</FONT>
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B>V</B>. &nbsp;<B><FONT><A NAME="Summary">Summary</A> </FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Exports offer valuable market opportunities for California-collected
materials and products made from them. These markets, though, are heavily
influenced by decisions and forces outside of the State or businesses to
accurately predict or control. The opportunities should not be ignored, but
rather should be understood and targeted as Californians continue their efforts
to reach 50 percent divrtsion by 2000. </FONT>
<P>
Three strategies are suggested for Board consideration to expand export markets,
especially for collected paper and plastics and products made from them:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Promote the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Recyclables Exchange.
  <LI>
    Assist recycled-content product manufacturers with export markets development.
  <LI>
    Promote export opportunities.

<P>
The passage of the Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB 939) challenged
Californians to adopt a new approach to waste management, involving the creation
of less waste and maximizing the use of recyclable materials. AB 939 mandated
the state's cities and counties to divert from landfills 25 percent of their
1990 waste streams, as adjusted for population growth and local economies,
by 1995 and 50 percent by 2000. Californians have made significant progress
toward achieving these goals. Major achievements include local governments'
implementation of new prevention and collection programs, resulting in a
25 percent statewide diversion rate in 1995 and establishment of many new
and expanded markets for recyclable materials. However, the challenge of
AB 939 has not yet been fully met.
<P>
To meet the 50 percent diversion mandate, collection programs must be expanded
and new and enhanced markets developed for an additional 13 million tons
of materials by the year 2000. If the challenge is to be met, waste prevention,
material collection, and market development actions must be sufficient to
divert a total of 25 million tons of recyclable materials by the year 2000.

Development Strategies through the Year 2000,</I> describes activities the
Integrated Waste Management Board will undertake to assist local governments
and the private sector in achieving that reduction goal.
<P>
Although this challenge is daunting, developing markets for recyclable materials
and products made from them offers significant opportunities. Many materials
in the waste stream can be used as raw materials by new and existing industries.
Manufacturing products made from recyclable materials lessens the environmental
impacts of solid waste disposal, increases California's manufacturing capacity,
creates new job opportunities, and conserves natural resources. Consumer
acceptance and purchase of the new products will ensure that recycling becomes
a sound business strategy that will continue to provide incentives to further
improve collection, processing, and remanufacturing technologies. Achievement
of these opportunities requires unique partnerships between State and local
governments; the waste management, recycling, and manufacturing industries;
and the public. This plan relies heavily on the establishment, expansion,
and achievements of those partnerships.

<B>II. </B>&nbsp;<B><A NAME="Process">The 1996 Market Development Plan Update
Process</A> </B>
<P>
The Board adopted its first plan for market development (<I>Meeting the
Challenge: A Market Development Plan for California</I>) in 1993. By late
1995, the Board recognized that changes in the state's economy and recycling
industry infrastructure, as well as in the needs of local government, made
revision and update of the 1993 market development plan a necessity.
Additionally, developing and maintaining a market development plan had become
a mandated activity with the passage of AB 1909 in 1993 (Public Resources
Code &#167;42005-42009). The Board's previous plan provided general guidelines
for implementing the Board's market development programs.
<P>
To begin the update process, Board staff prepared reports on major secondary
materials markets and conducted workshops to gather public comments and
suggestions on priorities the Board should establish for its market development
programs. The final 1996 market development plan is the result of these
activities.
<P>
This 1996 plan has been prepared with extensive public input. The proposed
plan was circulated to interested parties for public comment, and two public
workshops were held on June 14 and June 19, 1996. Based on comments received,
the plan was revised to better meet the needs of local governments and
businesses. The plan was then adopted by the Board at its publicly noticed
August 28, 1996, meeting.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<B>III. &nbsp;<A NAME="MDforRCP">Market Development for Recyclable Material
and Recycled-Content Products</A> </B>
<P>
The premise of the 1996 plan is that market development must address three
closely interrelated activities, each of which is extremely sensitive to
factors primarily affected by the private sector:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Collection and processing of materials.
  <LI>
    Manufacturer use of recycled feedstock.
  <LI>
    Product marketing and consumer use.
</UL>
<P>
For many secondary materials and products, market development is affected
by industry's relative inexperience with recycled feedstocks. Thus,
manufacturers' specifications, consumer preferences and perceptions, perceived
and actual feedstock and product quality, and public policy decisions all
impact the supply and demand of secondary materials and products made from
them.
<P>
The Board's market development program must consider how these complex and
interrelated factors affect each other. The Board has consistently sought
comments and suggestions from all participants in the market development
community when developing and evaluating programs. Additionally, the Board
directs that its market development programs should:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Promote partnerships among State government, business, and local governments
    for stimulating market development for recycled materials.
  <LI>
    Encourage manufacturing of value-added products whenever possible.
  <LI>
    Develop or expand self-sustaining businesses that will not be dependent on
    long-term government support.
</UL>
<P>
The Board's 1993 market development plan identified efforts the Board could
pursue to overcome market development barriers for each of three targeted
"priority materials" (paper, plastics, and compostables). Decreasing revenues
and other resource constraints limited the Board's ability to aggressively
implement all priority action items in that plan. However, the Board has
made significant progress on many of them. The revised plan builds on such
successes and relies heavily on other policy documents approved by the Board.
These include:

  <LI>
    <I> Statewide Waste Prevention Plan </I>

for each of these reports. The identified programs will continue to be
implemented.

<B>IV. &nbsp;Core Elements of the 1996 Market Development Plan</B>
<P>
<B> A. <A NAME="Goals">Goals</A> </B>
<P>
In 1990, California generated 45 million tons of solid waste. Of that amount,
approximately 40 million tons were being landfilled in California and 5 million
tons were being recycled or composted. By 1995, generation had decreased
to 44 million tons, but diversion had increased; with 12 million tons being
recycled or composted. Thus, through the conscientious efforts of State and
local government, businesses, and private citizens, California had achieved
its 25 percent diversion goal for 1995. This important achievement demonstrated
the economic viability of diversion programs, conserved natural resources
and landfill capacity, and created jobs in local communities. However,
Californians face an even bigger challenge in achieving the mandated 50 percent
diversion level, which will require that 25 million tons per year (MTPY)
be recycled or composted by the year 2000. This is a 13 MTPY increase over
1995 diversion levels.
<P>
The Board's primary goal in preparing the 1996 market development plan is
to help create markets for this additional 13 MTPY of collected material.
To do so, the Board will seek to build partnerships with local governments,
businesses, and solid waste and environmental organizations. In addition,
the Board will work cooperatively with local government and the private sector
to develop the collection infrastructure and innovative recycling technology
necessary for diverting 25 MTPY of postconsumer material from disposal.
<P>
A second goal is to develop markets for materials that, while not contributing
greatly to the 50 percent diversion goal, are important for other reasons
such as legislative mandates, health and safety impacts, or cost considerations.
<P>
<P>
<B> B. <A NAME="Criteria">Criteria</A> for Recommended Actions </B>
<P>
The recommendations contained in this plan are based on four qualitative
criteria:
<P>
<I><B> Relative contribution toward achieving the 50 percent diversion goal.
</B></I>
<P>
Meeting the year-2000 diversion mandate was the primary factor. Materials
representing a significant portion of the waste stream were targeted (i.e.,
paper, compostables, inerts, and wood).
<P>
<I><B> Special collection or environmental problems. </B></I>
<P>
The plan includes those materials which are costly to collect, process, and
dispose of due to their unique physical properties. Such commodities pose
unique collection and environmental problems. Thus, tires were selected as
a targeted commodity due to their significant environmental problems when
landfilled or illegally dumped and because the Board has tire-specific
discretionary funds to address tire market barriers. Plastics were targeted
since the Board administers two minimum-content plastics programs (trash
bags and rigid plastic packaging containers) mandated by State law, and
postconsumer resin must be available to support compliance with these laws.
In addition, most California jurisdictions have invested in infrastructure
to collect plastics, and the Board wants to ensure that there are sufficient
markets for the collected plastics.
<P>
<I><B> Anticipated impact on creating or enhancing markets. </B></I>
<P>
The plan includes Board actions which would likely be effective in creating
or enhancing markets.
<P>
<I><B> Time frame for implementation. </B></I>
<P>
Since the Board must achieve the 50 percent diversion mandate by the year
2000, the timeframe for implementing priority actions was an important
consideration. To ensure that the mandate is achieved, the Board selected
recommendations that it can implement in the next two to three years.<BR>

<P>
Based on the above criteria, the Board has established the following materials
and programs for priority market development efforts:
<P>
<I><B> Paper, Compostables, Inerts, and Wood </B></I>
<P>
These<B> </B>materials<B> </B>are targeted due to their large contribution
in the California waste stream and the need to aggressively divert these
materials to achieve the 50 percent diversion goal.
<P>
<I><B> Tires and Plastics </B></I>
<P>
These materials are targeted because they pose special collection and
environmental problems and because there are specifically mandated Board
market development programs.
<P>
<I><B> Industrial Market Development and Buy Recycled Programs </B></I>
<P>
These programs (R-Team and Buy Recycled) are targeted for priority effort
due to their impact on creating or enhancing markets.
<P>
For planning purposes, the Board assumes that 25 MTPY of market capacity
will be needed in the year 2000, as shown in Table A, Market<I>
</I>Capacity<I> </I>Goals. Additional, but unquantified, reductions in waste
generation will likely occur due to waste prevention (source reduction) efforts.
The 25 MTPY market capacity includes existing domestic and export capacity,
and the new capacity needed to absorb additional materials diverted for
recycling, composting, and energy recovery to meet the 50 percent diversion
goal.

<B>E. <A NAME="Summary">Summary</A> of the 1996 Market Development Plan</B>
<P>
The Board will undertake 16 priority actions to stimulate use of secondary
materials and demand for products made from these materials. The list continues
the priority materials selected in the 1993 plan (paper, plastic, and
compostables) and expands the priority list to include three additional
materials:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Tires, because they are an environmental problem in California and because
    the Board has discretionary funds available to promote tire markets.
  <LI>
    Urban wood, which represents about 7.5 percent of California's waste stream
    and faces unknown impacts due to reduction of biomass electricity facilities.
  <LI>
    Inerts, which represent 19 percent of the waste stream.
</UL>
<P>
Additionally, the priority actions in the 1996 plan depart from those in
the 1993 plan by recognizing the importance of targeting collection efficiency,
by reducing the emphasis on mandatory programs, and by emphasizing instead
voluntary actions through partnerships and alliances. The following table
summarizes the priority market development activities the Board will implement
during the next two to three years. Additional actions may be undertaken
in response to particularly attractive options to significantly divert additional
material. <I>Actions are not listed in priority order</I>. Detail on each
action is given in the section following the table.

A review of these 16 priority actions reveals several very important issues
which the Board will address so that California can achieve a 50 percent
disposal reduction by the year 2000:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Success of the priority actions relies heavily on public education and the
    sharing of information among local governments, private industry, the Board,
    and other State agencies.
  <LI>
    Since these actions are intended to set the direction and priorities for
    the Board's market development programs over the next 2-3 years, the Board
    will begin assessing the progress toward achieving the 50 percent diversion
    within the next several months in order to begin making any necessary program
    adjustments to this plan. Thus, market analysis, program evaluation, and
    diversion tracking will be done on a regular basis to ensure that sufficient
    progress is being made to reach the 50 percent mandate.
  <LI>
    The interrelationship between waste prevention and market development must
    be tracked. Preventing waste (the top waste management priority for the Board)
    may reduce material available for recycling/market development, but will
    also contribute to landfill diversion.
  <LI>
    Further development of local governments partnerships is needed to incorporate
    these actions into the local governments' market and industrial development
    programs. Local government efforts must be tailored to reflect their unique
    conditions, infrastructures, budgets, and expertise and take full advantage
    of the information, partnerships, and opportunities available in each of
    the priority actions.
</UL>
<P>
In conclusion, California can achieve the 50 percent diversion goal by 2000,
but this will happen only through the support, commitment, and cooperation
of the Board, local governments, recycling businesses, and the public.

<B>VI.</B> <B>Provisions for Reviewing and Revision</B>
<P>
This market development plan provides specific guidance to the Executive
Director regarding the Board's priority market development programs during
the next two to three years. However, the dynamic nature of recycling markets,
the ongoing needs of private industry and local government, and the impacts
of program implementation may alter the priorities selected in this plan.
The Board acknowledges the need for this market development plan to be reviewed
and revised on a regular basis (as mandated in Public Resources Code
&#167;42005-42009). Because sufficient staff and contract resources are critical
to successful implementation of the Board's priority market development programs,
future review of this plan will be scheduled so the plan can have a direct
influence on the Board's annual development of its budget and contract concepts.
The Board will consider revisions to its market development plan each February
concurrently with setting loan objectives for the following fiscal year.
<P>
In addition, the Board will continue to assess markets on a quarterly basis.
The results of the ongoing analysis will be printed and distributed through
the Board's quarterly markets report. Thus, the Board will continues to analyze,
identify and understand the markets and market trends for secondary materials,
the barriers to expanding those markets, and opportunities to overcome barriers.
<P>
Finally, the Board directs staff to update the Market Development Committee
regularly concerning implementation of the actions contained in this plan
and the Board's progress toward's meeting the 50 percent mandate. Board staff
will also apprise the Committee regarding other actions staff has taken to
assist local governments and businesses to recycle materials and develop
expanded markets for California secondary materials.

  Suggestions Already Accomplished by the Board
</H2>
<P>
  <HR>
<OL>
  <LI>
    Revise and expand the Board's Rural Cookbook and make it accessible through
    the Board s Website.
  <LI>
    Define waste in order to easily settle the question "what is waste?"
  <LI>
    Permit cities and counties to count removing recyclables from waste sent
    to landfills as diversion.
  <LI>
    Develop a tracking method for waste that leaves the county where it is generated
    (i.e., disposed in another county or exported out-of-state).
  <LI>
    Develop more and complete information databases on a variety of items to
    be used both internationally and by local governments.
  <LI>
    Have Board staff provide training to cities and counties on diversion related
    issues.
  <LI>
    Analyze public health issues associated with diversion facilities, especially
    material recovery facilities (MRFs).
  <LI>
    Implement tiered regulations with a focus on actual health and safety impacts
    - i.e., slotting should not be just a function of size. Expedite efforts
    in promoting tiered permits.
  <LI>
    Improve Solid Waste Information System (SWIS) list accessibility. Include
    information of value to markets i.e., Notification tier composting operations,
    capacity and actual production figures - feedstock in and compost out.
  <LI>
    Evaluate legality/feasibility of an export fee for waste disposed out of
    state.
  <LI>
    Provide grants to construct household hazardous waste (HHW) facilities.
  <LI>
    Work with developed partnership programs and supply funds or brochures for
    programs.
  <LI>
    Provide more training on greenwaste and composting.
  <LI>
    Develop a general media kit for cities and counties, especially in rural
    areas, so it is easy to implement a public education campaign.
  <LI>
    Send press releases to Source Reduction and Recycling Coordinators as well
    as press so local government is aware of Board publicity.
  <LI>
    Have Board staff attend rural fairs.
  <LI>
    Increase use of telecommunications in public education efforts.
  <LI>
    Increase materials available on the Internet to increase knowledge of Board
    programs.
  <LI>
    Develop a list of all grant and loan programs and information items (brochures,
    public service announcements, reports, etc.)
  <LI>
    Create more off-the-shelf educational materials that cities and counties
    can use. This would take advantage of economies of scale.
  <LI>
    Provide a directory of businesses that are producing recycled products for
    distribution through Internet and at Board booths at fairs, etc.
  <LI>
    Help schools and school districts implement recycling programs.
  <LI>
    Educate the public as to why landfills are still necessary, and why permitting
    and enforcement is necessary.

<B><A NAME="1">1. The Board should focus its efforts on fewer key programs
that will lead to 50 percent diversion.</A> <BR>
</B>
<P>
The Board should target/focus its programs and efforts on key material types,
large waste generators, and large potential consumers/manufacturers of the
major secondary materials that will lead to 50 percent diversion.<B> </B>This
concept is a general overall approach that would guide the Board in its effort
to assist cities and counties in reaching 50 percent diversion. It consists
of ideas ranging from: 1) the Board, cities and counties should focus program
activities toward key waste generators and material types where viable
alternatives exist; 2) have staff focus on materials that have the biggest
impacts and form material based task forces; and 3) put more emphasis on
targeting the largest waste generators (commercial and industrial) over which
jurisdictions have limited control. <BR>
<P>
Focusing the Board's effort is especially critical within the context of
the limited time remaining to reach 50 percent diversion by 2000 and projected
declines in Board revenues. Many Board staff in the areas of diversion
assistance, market development, and waste prevention are assigned to work
on major material types, large generators, and large consumers/ manufacturers;
however, the focus can often be diluted by programs and tasks with little
diversion potential. If staff efforts were focused, instead, on a few key
programs, the potential for high diversion would be much greater. Staff would
identify key programs that have the greatest potential for diversion. The
evaluation would include both new programs (identified as part of the 50
percent process, Market Development Plan, or other activities) and existing
programs. <BR>
<P>
The Cost Effectiveness and Waste Management Program Comparison panel assumed
that the time to identify the key programs would be relatively short, within
several months and, initially the evaluation would focus on activities which
are not mandated. Much of the information on major material types, large
generators, and large consumers/manufacturers already exists or can be extracted
from existing information. <BR>
<P>
There would be some additional cost associated with re-evaluating programs.
However, the benefits in terms of increased diversion are expected to be
high and overall Board costs to reach 50% would be expected to decrease.<BR>
<P>
This concept could be both an expansion of existing programs and new programs.
Legislation could be required to change or remove requirements for programs
that have less diversion potential. <BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 1:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct staff to: 1)
evaluate how existing and proposed activities contribute to reaching the
50% diversion goal; and 2) develop an approach for focusing Board efforts
on activities most likely to achieve the 50% diversion goal. The approach
should identify and explain the need for any proposed legislative changes.<BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><A HREF="#top">Top</A></I>
<P>
<B><A HREF="#2">2. Evaluate Board programs for effectiveness and direct staff
to effective programs.</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
This concept also provides an approach to guide the Board in reaching 50
percent diversion. It consists of ideas ranging from: 1) perform critical
analysis of all activities and direct more staff to the most effective programs;
2) identify effective waste prevention, collection, and recycling options
to reach the target diversion rates; and 3) account for complete follow-up
and maintenance of key databases that will assist in getting to 50 percent.<BR>
<P>
The Cost Effectiveness and Waste Management Program Comparison panel viewed
this concept more as a subconcept to the general overall approach of the
Board focusing its effort on key material types, large waste generators,
and large potential consumers/manufacturers of the major secondary materials
(see concept 1, above). The key programs identified under concept 1 would
be evaluated for their effectiveness in producing relatively high diversion
results with low program costs. Effectiveness is defined as those activities
and programs which produce relatively high diversion results with low program
costs. This should further enhance the potential for high diversion that
would be realized under the above concept. It was assumed that analysis of
Board programs for effectiveness would be relatively short, within several
months. <BR>
<P>
There would be some additional cost associated with re-evaluating programs.
However, the benefits in terms of increased diversion are expected to be
high and overall Board costs to reach 50% would be expected to decrease.<BR>
<P>
This concept could be both an expansion of existing programs and new programs.
Legislation could be required to change or remove requirements for programs
that have less diversion potential. <BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 2:</B></U> Staff recommends that the Board build on the
information developed under concept 1, and direct Board staff to: 1) evaluate
the effectiveness of existing programs and proposed programs (identified
as part of the 50 percent process, Market Development, or other activities);
and 2) develop an approach for focusing Board efforts on effective programs.
The approach should identify and explain the need for any proposed legislative
changes.<BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><A HREF="#top">Top</A></I>
<P>
<A NAME="3"><B>3. Exempt rural cities and counties from the diversion planning
and diversion goals of the IWMA</B>. </A><BR>
<P>
The concept contained suggestions that the rural cities and counties be exempted
due to the small amount of waste they generate, and their lack of staff and
money to implement diversion programs. <BR>
<P>
Approximately 27%, or 128, of California's 532 cities and counties qualify
as rural. Rural cities and counties are home to about 7% of California's
population and generate about 8% of the California's waste stream. Rural
cites and counties are required to produce the same types of plans and meet
the same diversion goals as other cities and counties unless they petition
the Board for reduced requirements. Exempting rural cities or counties, or
having alternative goals was discussed when the IWMA was originally drafted.
<BR>
<P>
Given low staffing in rural cities and counties, preparation of plans and
measurement of goal achievement is comparatively very costly for them. This
concept would reduce rural city and county costs. It could also reduce costs
for the Board and allow staff to be redirected to other efforts. <BR>
<P>
This concept would modify existing Board programs and would require legislation.
<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 3:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board hold a workshop to discuss
the issues associated with how and whether to exempt rural cities and counties
from diversion requirements of the IWMA. Based on that discussion, the Board
could decide whether to pursue Board-sponsored legislation.

<A NAME="4"><B>4. Raise IWM Fee rate to $1.40 to increase funding for waste</B>
<B>diversion programs.</B></A>
<P>
There was one suggestion within this concept: the Board could raise the IWM
Fee, its primary funding source, for carrying out its waste diversion mandates.
This could provide an additional $2 million per fiscal year or a total of
$6 million over fiscal years 1997-98 through 1999-2000.<BR>
<P>
This concept would increase the funds available to the Board and would impose
a limited expense on the affected public. This could be carried out quickly
and was rated highly using the standard evaluation criteria.<BR>
<P>
This concept is a modification to an existing Board program and does not
require legislation.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 4:</B></U> Staff recommend the Board request the presentation
of an agenda item regarding Options for Enhancing the IWM Fee which includes
consideration of raising the IWM Fee. Based on the discussion, the Board
could decide whether to pursue raising the IWM fee.

<P>
<B><A NAME="5">5. Impose IWM Fee at Material Recovery Facilities (MRF) and
Transfer stations for materials disposed of outside of California.</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
This concept would levy the IWM fee, the Board's primary funding source,
on MRFs and transfer stations that export solid waste that for disposal outside
of California. This could make available an additional $500,000 per fiscal
year.<BR>
<P>
While this approach in and of itself may not significantly increase diversion,
it could provide additional funds for Board diversion programs and eliminate
an inequity in the current IWM Fee structure.<BR>
<P>
This concept is a modification to an existing Board program and would require
legislation.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 5:</B></U> Staff recommend the Board request the presentation
of the agenda item discussed in concept 4 above, regarding Options for Enhancing
the IWM Fee which includes consideration of collecting the fee from MRFs

<P>
<B><A NAME="6">6. Increase IWM Fee significantly (e.g. $5/ton) and provide
a break for cities and counties that meet or exceed diversion goals.</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
This concept was composed of two suggestions: 1) raise the IWM fee to create
an incentive to divert more; and 2) provide a break in the IWM fee to cities
and counties which meet the diversion goals. The IWM Fee structure could
be changed to a sliding scale (starting at $5.00 per ton, for example) such
that the rate paid by each landfill would fall as their city or county met
and or exceeded its diversion goals. Rather than enhancing revenues, the
fee schedule could be set so overall, there would be a neutral impact on
the IWM account.<BR>
<P>
Using such a fee schedule could maintain, or increase, the resources available
to the Board and provide an incentive for California residents and businesses
to divert waste. This suggestion was highly rated by the standard 50% Initiative
evaluation criteria. This recommendation has one of the highest diversion
potentials in this category.<BR>
<P>
This concept is a modification to an existing Board program and would require
legislation.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 6:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board request the presentation
of the agenda item discussed in concepts 4 and 5 above regarding Options
for Enhancing the IWM Fee which includes consideration of a significant fee
increase with a break for cities and counties meeting or exceeding the diversion
goals. Based on the discussion the Board could determine whether to pursue
Board sponsored legislation.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="7"><B>7. Improve Board grant application procedures to improve the</B>
<B>Board's ability to access outside grant funds.</B></A><B><BR>
</B>
<P>
This concept consisted of suggestions which included: 1) actively seeking
and applying for grants; and 2) streamlining Board procedures to obtain grants.
<BR>
<P>
The Board has successfully applied for numerous grants for diversion programs
from agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. More grant
funds could potentially be available to the Board if the grant opportunities
were known earlier, and Board coordination and review requirements were reviewed,
and if necessary, streamlined. The time required for internal coordination
and to obtain approvals is so lengthy that many opportunities to apply for
grants are missed. <BR>
<P>
This concept would impose little, if any, cost on the Board and none on other
entities. This suggestion was highly rated by the standard evaluation
criteria.<BR>
<P>
This concept is a modification to an existing Board program and does not
require legislation.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 7:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct review of current
procedures for applying for grants and, if necessary revise the procedures
to allow the Board to submit timely applications for grant funds. <BR>

<B><A NAME="8">8. Refocus the applicable portions of the Board's grant and
loan programs to make diversion potential the highest priority. Provide grants
to expand recycling of specific materials/products.</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
This concept consisted of suggestions which ranged from: 1) increasing
flexibility in the use of existing Board grant funds; 2) focusing all Board
financial assistance on programs with high diversion potential; and 3) funding
innovative recycled content manufacturing. <BR>
<P>
The Board has a number of grants and loans programs. Household hazardous
waste and used oil are defined as hazardous waste, and fall outside the measured
waste stream for achievement of the diversion goal. A variety of criteria
are used by the Board when awarding grants and loans. These criteria should
be reviewed and revised to make each proposal's ability to stimulate waste
diversion the highest and primary criteria.<BR>
<P>
This concept was highly rated by the standard 50% Initiative evaluation criteria.
It could be implemented fairly quickly at low cost to the Board.<BR>
<P>
This concept is a modification to an existing Board program and does not
require legislation.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 8:</B></U> Staff recommend the Board direct Recycling Market
Development Zone (RMDZ) and tire staff to continue to work on this issue
and include a discussion of tying loans or grants to diversion potential
in their next respective agenda items on grant and loan review criteria.<BR>

<A NAME="9"><B>9. Leverage Board diversion efforts by starting joint</B>
<B>initiatives with other states, interest groups and business</B>
<B>associations.</B> </A><BR>
<P>
This concept would direct various staff to identify and work with other states,
special interest groups, and business associations to promote the waste diversion
goals. Teaming up with these entities could allow the Board's information
and messages to reach broader or more targeted audiences at a lower cost.
It could also lead to the creation of new or stronger associations between
the public and private sectors and bring combined expertise and ability to
bear on diverting specific material types or decreasing the amount in the
waste stream. This concept is similar to concepts 28 and 32 which also discuss
Board partnerships to increase effectiveness and take advantage of economies
of scale.<BR>
<P>
This concept was highly rated by the standard 50% Initiative evaluation criteria.
Forming such partnerships could be accomplished at very little cost to the
Board or these entities.<BR>
<P>
This concept is an expansion of existing Board programs and does not require
legislation.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 9:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct staff to: 1)
expand its efforts to identify the potential for joint initiatives and
incorporate such partnerships into existing projects; and 2) include a discussion
of potential partnerships and joint initiatives in agenda items on proposed
new activities, as appropriate.<BR>

</B>
<P>
This concept consists of suggestions which range from: 1) providing tax
incentives for businesses using recycled materials as feedstock; 2) providing
tax credits for purchase of equipment that prevents waste; to 3) providing
a volume-based tax credit to businesses for recycling activities. <BR>
<P>
This concept would offer tax credits for individuals or companies that purchased
recycled materials or purchased equipment to process or use secondary materials
in finished products.<BR>
<P>
This recommendation has one of the highest potential diversion potentials
in this category. While enacting an effective tax credit program would require
legislation, time and additional funds, it would also provide a significant
boost to recycling in California.<BR>
<P>
This concept would be a new program for the Board. It would require legislation
and coordination with appropriate state agencies.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 10:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct staff to coordinate
with appropriate state agencies and prepare an agenda item on potential tax
credits. Based on the discussion, the Board could decide whether to pursue
Board-sponsored legislation.<BR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="11">11. Perform a study to help cities and counties find a way
to fund programs.</A></B>
<P>
This concept suggests a study targeted at cities and counties who have difficulty
funding their diversion programs. The study would highlight the best funding
arrangements used by other cities and counties or additional sources of funding.
<BR>
<P>
Many cities and counties testified at the Board workshops that funding for
diversion programs was very limited and they did not have sufficient staff
resources to identify alternative funding mechanisms or additional sources
of funding. <BR>
<P>
This recommendation could be carried out at moderate cost to the Board and
at no cost to other entities. It could stimulate diversion if it led cities
and counties to obtain additional funding to expand or improve their waste
diversion programs.<BR>
<P>
This concept is an expansion of an existing Board program and could require
contract funds. It does not require legislation. <BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 11:</B></U> The Board could direct staff to complete, or award

<P>
<B><A NAME="12">12. More actively promote unit pricing among cities and
counties.</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
Unit pricing is a waste collection billing system in which the amount paid
by each waste generator is proportional to the amount of waste disposed.
The concept consisted of suggestions such as: 1) strongly promoting unit
pricing to increase source separation and waste reduction; and 2) inviting
affected parties to participate in a Board-sponsored working group on how
to promote unit pricing. <BR>
<P>
Unit pricing has led to quick, dramatic reductions in waste disposed in many
communities. Several communities have reported achieving a 15-60% decrease
in disposal shortly after unit pricing was instituted. Economic consequences
are often effective in changing behavior. Additional information on the
prevalence, the effects and latest technologies and costs of unit pricing
could be assembled.
<P>
Additional promotional materials could be developed. More workshops could
be held. Direct appeals by the Board to local elected officials could be
made.<BR>
<P>
This recommendation could be accomplished at moderate cost the Board and
at little cost to other entities. If additional communities adopted unit
pricing arrangements, significantly increased recycling and source reduction
would result. This suggestion was highly rated by the standard 50% Initiative
evaluation criteria and has one of the highest diversion potentials in this
category. <BR>
<P>
This concept is an expansion of an existing Board program and does not require
legislation.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 12:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct the presentation

consideration of options to more actively promote unit pricing to cities

</B></A>
<P>
This concept is more stringent than concept 12 which encourages unit pricing.
This concept would require the adoption of pricing or financing arrangements
that provide financial rewards for waste diversion.<BR>
<P>
The discussion about unit pricing found under concept 12 applies to concept
13. While this was not one of the highest ranking recommendations it would
have one of the highest diversion impacts in this category.<BR>
<P>
This concept is a modification to an existing Board program and would require
legislation.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 13:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct the presentation
of an agenda item discussed in concept 12 above regarding California Unit

<P>
<B><A NAME="14">14. Require all landfills to charge the true, unsubsidized
cost of landfill disposal. </A><BR>
</B>
<P>
This concept is to require that landfills charge rates reflective of their
true, unsubsidized disposal costs. In many cities and counties the true cost
of landfill disposal is subsidized, or is not fully paid by waste generators.
If the true costs were paid up front, alternatives such as recycling would
be more attractive. If this requirement were coupled with unit pricing systems,
the incentive for generators to reduce or recycle would be significantly
enhanced.<BR>
<P>
While this approach would be controversial and possibly difficult to enforce,
it has one of the highest diversion potentials in this category.<BR>

<P>
This concept is very similar to concept 11, above. This concept is less stringent
since it requires disclosure of true costs of disposal, but does not landfills
to charge the true disposal costs. <BR>
<P>
As an alternative to concept 11 above, merely requiring the disclosure of
true landfilling costs would improve the attractiveness of reduction and
recycling programs. The true value of these programs would become more evident
and could counter some arguments that they are too expensive.<BR>
<P>
This approach may not be as controversial as concept 11 above, but would
have less impact on diversion.<BR>

</B>
<P>
This concept would allow cities and counties to transfer or sell diversion
tonnage above the 25% and 50% goals.<BR>
<P>
Some cities and counties can divert waste at lower costs than others. If
low-cost cities and counties could sell diversion tonnage above their goals
to high-cost cities and counties, they would have an incentive to maximize
diversion. High-cost cities and counties could then achieve their goals at
a lower cost. &nbsp;
<P>
This would allow cities, counties and the Board to minimize their costs to
meeting the IWMA goals.<BR>
<P>
While this approach would not necessarily cause the most additional diversion,
it could significantly reduce the cost to California of meeting the IWMA
goals.
<P>
This concept would be a new program for the Board and would require
legislation.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 16:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct the presentation
of an agenda item regarding Changes to IWM Goals and Goal Measurement which
includes consideration of the allowing cities and counties to sell diversion

  Cost Effectiveness and Program Comparison
</H2>
<P>
  <HR>
This category consists of concepts that suggest either specific programs
that would be cost effective, or providing successful diversion model programs
and comparative information to cites and counties on costs and effectiveness
of diversion programs.
<P>
In evaluating these concepts, the Cost Effectiveness and Waste Management
Program Comparison Panel determined that two evaluation criteria related
to sphere of influence, population and sectors, would have the same score
for all concepts. All the concepts within this category are of a statewide
perspective and would affect all sectors.

</TABLE>
<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME="17">17. Provide successful model programs (case studies) for
effective diversion and comparison models of various programs. </A></B>
<P>
This concept consists of ideas ranging from: 1) developing a model program
handbook that would list successful types of municipal diversion programs
and provide case studies; 2) improving quantitative basis for local decision
making, maximizing impact, cost effectiveness, etc. through models designed
by Board-led decision making workshops; and 3) providing uplink/downlink
capability to increase participation in Board training/workshops for and
with partners.
<P>
Providing successful model programs and comparison models of various programs
to cities, counties and private industry would serve as valuable planning
tools, helping to make programs more effective in reaching 50 percent diversion.
Effective is defined as those activities and programs which produce relatively
high diversion results with low program costs. Cities, counties and private
industry would be able to draw upon the information, selecting the right
mix to increase waste diversion. The Board has already developed several
models to assist with waste prevention and diversion, including the Rural
Cookbook, the Facility Cost Model, and the Collection Cost Model. The proposed
models would be expansions of existing models or development of new models.
In evaluating the concept, it was assumed that the models would be practical
and relevant, serve cities, counties and private industry needs, and take
less than one year to be developed.
<P>
There would be some additional cost to the Board through increased contract
funds or staff assigned to develop the models.
<P>
This is an expansion of existing Board programs and no legislation would
be required.
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 17:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct staff to: 1)
work with cities, counties and private industry to identify successful, effective
programs; 2) identify diversion program comparison models needed; and 3)
develop proposals on models and products highlighting effective programs
for Board consideration.
<P ALIGN=Center>

<P>
<B><A NAME="18">18. Leverage greater buying power through state contracts
for local governments. </A></B>
<P>
This concept consists of the following idea: help cities and counties increase
buying power for equipment such as recycling containers, backyard composters,
tub grinders, trucks, etc., through statewide contracts (e.g., similar to
the way police cars are purchased -in large volumes for lower prices).
<P>
Leveraging greater buying power through state contracts would assist diversion
programs, especially those in rural or small cites and counties, that are
ready for implementation and seeking specific equipment, or existing programs
that need to replace existing equipment. This would allow diversion programs
to take advantage of economies of scale when purchasing necessary equipment.
In evaluating the concept, it was assumed that any local jurisdiction could
take advantage of the program and emphasis would be statewide. However, rural
and small cities and counties would probably receive the greatest benefit,
although distribution of the equipment could impact cost savings.
<P>
This would be a new program for the Board and could require legislation depending
on the types of programs established (e.g., statewide contract similar to
that used by the Department of General Services or private cooperatives).
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 18:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct staff to: 1)
identify any legal or administrative issues with a proposal to leverage buying
power for equipment; 2) work with cities and counties to determine what equipment
purchases could be assisted by this program; and 3) if feasible, pursue
legislation where necessary, and then develop a proposal for a statewide
contract and implementation process.

The Public Affairs and Education category contains a wide variety of suggestions
ranging from: 1) increase awareness of 50% goal by increasing Board presence
at fairs, conferences, and other public events; 2) increase public education
campaigns; and 3) create new awards/contest (similar to the Waste Reduction
Awards Program) to encourage diversion activities.<BR>
<P>
Upon evaluating suggestions, the Public Affairs and Education panel agreed
that in general, public education can cover and/or address all types of wastes;
however, the actual diversion due to the public education and outreach effort
is very difficult to measure. Therefore, the impact on the waste stream addressed
received maximum scores while the potential for diversion of each waste type
received the lowest score. It is difficult to measure public behavioral changes
due to public education programs and changes are often realized over an extended
period of time. Therefore, the potential time to optimize the effect on the
waste stream was evaluated as the time needed to implement the concept.<BR>
<P>
Waste diversion public education activities have traditionally been large-scale,
multi-media public education campaigns or personal contact through outreach
at events. The issues associated with each type of activity are different.
Public education campaigns reach large numbers of people, are typically very
costly to produce and distribute through media outlets and may have a low
rate of behavior changes. Personal contact through outreach activities serve
a limited number of people, are typically less costly than traditional
multi-media public education campaigns and may increase the rate of behavior
changes. <BR>
<P>
<A NAME="top">The Public Affairs and Education panel recommends the following
four concepts for further Board consideration:<BR>

</TABLE>
<P>
<B> <A NAME="19">19. Increase awareness of 50% goals by increasing the Board's
presence at fairs, conferences, and other public events.<BR>
</A></B>
<P>
This concept consists of ideas ranging from: 1) encouraging proactive state
fair involvement; 2) using all possible and affordable venues, continue to
state that getting to the 50% goal is important; and 3) increasing public
outreach at fairs and conferences.<BR>
<P>
To maintain the 25% waste reduction and pursue an additional 25% waste reduction,
it is crucial that the Board increases the public's awareness of the 50%
goal. Research has shown that more people change behavior with personal contacts.
Increasing the Board's presence at fairs, conferences, and other public events
would increase personal contacts. The Board has been involved at the State
Fair, numerous County Fairs, technical conferences, Earth Day events, and
other public events throughout the year with favorable results each time.
Rural cities and counties especially appreciate the Board's presence at their
fairs. However, due to budgetary and technical constraints, the outreach
program has not been able to meet the full demand for Board participation.
<BR>
<P>
The sphere of influence for this program will be limited to the people who
attend these fairs, conferences, and public events. By attending public outreach
events, the Board can provide information in a more personal manner and has
the potential for reaching more fairgoers and attendees. There would be some
cost in increasing the Board's presence at fairs. To minimize the operational
expenses at the county fairs and other public events, the Board should consider
sharing a booth with the host County or other interested parties. The State
Fair is the biggest and longest public outreach event, and the Board could
create a subcommittee for the development of the outreach activities for
the State Fair exhibit.<BR>
<P>
This concept is an expansion of the existing activities and does not require
new legislation. <BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 19:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct staff to review
existing policy for participation in fairs, conferences and events, and if
develop options for potential methods of cost sharing for Board participation.
<BR>

<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<A NAME="20"><B>20. Dedicate more time and effort for public outreach in
Southern California where the majority of the population resides.</B> <BR>
</A>
<P>
The concept reflects a suggestion to focus outreach in the highest population
area. More than half of the state population resides in Southern California
where 59% of the waste is generated. With the projected decrease in revenues,
the Board needs to examine the approach to most effectively develop new public
education campaigns and increase the California regions targeted for campaigns.
However, a new, major statewide media campaign is very costly, and the
effectiveness is difficult to measure. Therefore, a focused public outreach
to a high population areas such as Southern California. <BR>
<P>
This concept is a modification of existing outreach activities and does not
require new legislation.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 20:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct staff to review
existing policy for participation in fairs, conferences and events, and develop
options for revising the policy to target major population centers in Southern
California. <BR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="21">21. Establish a "chat room" or a similar site on the internet
site so that the Board's customers can present environmental and recycling
questions and the Board staff or other businesses can post the answers.
</A></B>
<P>
The concept is a request to increase interaction with the Board's customers
ability on the internet. The Board brought up its Internet/World Wide Web
Home Page on January 1, 1996. The Board's Home Page, which has been visited
approximately 15,000 times over the past eleven months has proven successful
in promoting waste prevention by posting information frequently requested
by cities, counties, businesses, industries, and institutions. <BR>
<P>
Several suggestions regarding the promotion of the use of the internet for
specific activities were brought up at the three Board workshops, and most
of them have been already implemented. <BR>
<P>
Establishing the "chat room" or a similar site to provide the Board's customers
an opportunity to interact can be done with relatively low cost to the Board
and the external customers. A Board staff person would need to act as moderator
to ensure adequate responses are provided to questions posted. Or, requests
could be sent via e&#173;mail and Board staff could post a response. This
would be similar to a "chat room" with a small time delay.
<P>
This concept is an expansion of the existing Board Home Page function and
does not require new legislation.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 21:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct staff to analyze
issues related to and options for setting up a "chat room", and set up the
"chat room" if any issues identified can be easily resolved.<BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="22">22. Develop new public education campaigns and increase the
number of targeted areas.<BR>
</A></B>
<P>
This concept consists of ideas ranging from: 1) develop new public service
announcements; 2) aggressively publicize reuse and waste reduction, not just
recycling; and 3) coordinate public education campaigns with the Department
of Conservation's Division of Recycling and businesses. <BR>
<P>
To achieve 50% diversion, it is critical that the public be educated. One
of the most effective ways to reach a large proportion of the population
is through multi-media campaigns. <BR>
<P>
The sphere of influence of this concept will be the population in the areas
targeted for the campaign. There will be costs to the Board. Developing new
public education campaigns can be very costly, and in the past the Board
had contracts to produce public education campaigns. With the projected decline
in Board revenues as diversion increases, new approaches to developing less
costly multi-media public education campaigns would be needed if the Board
chose to pursue this concept. Partnerships with other State agencies or
businesses would be a way to reduce costs. <BR>
<P>
This concept is an expansion of existing Board programs and does not require
new legislation.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 22</B></U><B>:</B> Staff recommend the Board direct staff
to: 1) identify potential options for lower cost multi-media public education
campaigns, including partnerships; and 2) develop a proposal for pursuing
lower cost options. <BR>

Board analysis can be found in <A HREF="rank.htm">Attachment 2</A> (370K

  Disposal Reduction Goals and Goal Measurement
</H2>
<P>
  <HR>
The Disposal Reduction Goals and Goal Measurement category contains a wide
variety of suggestions which range from: 1) exempting rural cities and counties
from goal measurement and setting alternative goals; 2) promoting other Board
activities by allowing disposal reduction for activities such as timely clean
up of illegal disposal sites or monofilling materials with current limited
markets or low prices for future landfill mining; 3) changing the definition
of disposal and how to measure disposal reduction in the IWMA. <BR>
<P>
Several of the ideas proposed to change the definition of disposal and diversion,
thus it was difficult to use the impact on the waste stream and diversion
potential criteria which are based on the existing definitions of disposal
and diversion. Also, most of the ideas in this category do not directly relate
to implementing diversion and were difficult to evaluate in terms of diversion
potential and impact on the waste stream. <BR>
<P>
Several of the ideas have been raised in various forums in the past such
as the proposal to change the proportion of transformation which is counted
as diversion which was contained in proposed 1996 legislation and re-evaluating
the need for diversion reporting which was considered when the Board sponsored
legislation which passed in 1992 (Assembly Bill 2494). Other ideas are new,
such as promoting various Board activities such as illegal disposal site
clean-up by allowing it to count as disposal reduction, and have not been
considered by the Board. <BR>
<P>
The Disposal Reduction Goals and Goal Measurement Panel recommends the following
five concepts for further Board consideration: <BR>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">

  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<A NAME="23"><B>23. Continue to focus on diversion programs implemented not
just achievement of numerical goals.</B> <BR>
</A>
<P>
This concept included a number of suggestions that ranged from: 1) changing
the law to emphasize diversion program implementation; and 2) placing more
emphasis of diversion than accounting. <BR>
<P>
There has been considerable confusion about the current statute which requires
that the Board examine diversion program implementation as well as goal
measurement. So, the Board is required by law to implement this concept.
<BR>
<P>
If the Board focused more on programs implemented there could be decreased
costs to cities and counties, haulers and the waste management industry.
<BR>
<P>
This is an expansion of existing Board programs and activities and would
not require a legislative change. <BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 23:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct staff to develop
means to educate people about existing statute and Board policies regarding
diversion program implementation and goal measurement. <BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<A NAME="24"><B>24. Allow transformation to count for more than 10% diversion
for the 50% diversion goal</B>. </A><BR>
<P>
This concept consists of suggestions ranging from: 1) revisit incineration
of municipal solid waste now that technology allows cleaner burning plants;
2) define cogeneration and waste-to-energy as diversion; and 3) encourage
incineration of contaminated or unmarketable combustible waste.<BR>
<P>
Existing law counts transformation as disposal until 1995 then allows
transformation to count for up to 10 of the 50% goal in 2000. The topic of
transformation has been controversial since the IWMA was first drafted. Staff
assumed that this suggestion was limited to existing waste-to-energy and
biomass facilities, as other factors such as economics and Public Utilities
Commission deregulation currently are the driving forces in construction
of new transformation facilities. There are three waste-to-energy facilities
which handle a limited amount of tonnage, but biomass facilities serve cities
and counties statewide. <BR>
<P>
There would be a small additional cost to the Board, cities, counties and
somewhat larger costs to private industry as biomass facilities have not
been part of the disposal reporting system and would have to report tonnage
incinerated.
<P>
This concept would modify existing Board programs and would require both
legislative and regulatory changes. <BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 24:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board hold a workshop to
discuss the issues associated with increasing the portion of transformation
allowed to count as diversion and based on that discussion, decide whether
to pursue Board-sponsored legislation.<BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="25">25. Measure numerical goal achievement by county, region
or state not by individual city or unincorporated county.</A></B> <BR>
<P>
The three suggestions in this concept were to measure goal achievement
differently on either a county, region or statewide basis.<BR>
<P>
Many goal measurement issues are tied to problems with allocating waste to
532 individual cites and counties. This problem developed in the base-year
when waste at landfills serving multiple cites or counties was allocated
primarily based on population. It is now known that population does not
accurately represent the waste generated by businesses and businesses generate
about 55% of the California waste stream. Many of the issues in the current
disposal measurement system relate to determining from what city or county
the waste is sent. There are fewer errors in allocation when goal achievement
is measured at the county level or higher and there are few issues with goal
measurement for existing Regional Agencies. <BR>
<P>
This concept could reduce the staff time spent on reviewing each city's and
county's documents and the disposal reporting system. It would require less
detailed reporting by haulers, waste management industry, cities and counties.
<BR>
<P>
This concept would modify an existing Board program and would require
legislation. <BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 25:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board request a report from
Dr. Tseng, the Base-year Inaccuracies Working Group and staff on issues
associated with changing the area used for measuring goal achievement. Based
on that report and subsequent Board discussion, it is recommended the Board
decide whether to pursue Board-sponsored legislation.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<A NAME="26"><B>26. Develop solutions to problems with measuring goal
achievement.</B> </A><BR>
<P>
This concept included suggestions which ranged from: 1) develop information
on disaster waste and goal measurement; 2) establish a new base-year when
measurement accuracy problems are solved; and 3) improve methods for identifying
orphan diverted wastes at MRFs. <BR>
<P>
As stated in the concept 25, above, there have been measurement inaccuracies
which developed during the base-year when measurement issues and the sources
of waste generation were less well known. This idea would expand on existing
activities to add work on various types of measurement issues that has not
yet started. The Base-Year Inaccuracies Working Group is working with staff
and Dr. Tseng under an Interagency Agreement (IAA) to develop solutions to
many of the problems. <BR>
<P>
Expanding the work would require additional staff or augmentation of the
existing Interagency Agreement with Dr. Tseng. There will be some low costs
for cities, counties and private industry to participate in the Working
Group.<BR>
<P>
Solving measurement issues would have some costs for cities, counties and
the waste management industry in the short term, but could lead to savings
in the long term. <BR>
<P>
This suggestion would modify an existing Board program and, depending on
the solutions developed, could require legislation.
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 26:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board request a report from
the Dr. Tseng, the Base-year Inaccuracies Working Group and staff on issues
associated with changing the area used for measuring goal achievement. Based
on that report and subsequent Board discussion, it is recommended the Board
decide whether to pursue Board-sponsored legislation. <BR>

  Local Diversion Assistance
</H2>
<P>
  <HR>
The Local Diversion Assistance category consists of a large variety of ideas
related to improving Board assistance to cities and counties through a variety
of means. These include: 1) prepare and distribute more case studies, models,
databases and "how-to" reports; 2) expand forums and opportunities for cites
and counties to share information on diversion-related topics through the
Internet, regional networks and Board newsletters; 3) focus diversion assistance
efforts on property management companies and associations to reduce duplication
of diversion efforts; and 4) provide staff as consultants to cities and counties
for program development and implementation. <BR>
<P>
The Local Diversion Assistance panel recommends the following six concepts
for further Board consideration: <BR>

assistance to specific city or county needs. Continue to shift Board staff
focus from planning to diversion program implementation
assistance.</B><B><BR>
</B></A></B>
<P>
Ideas in this concept range from: 1) increasing assistance in establishing
regional diversion facilities; 2) identifying local needs by county and city
and developing specific programs to assist in implementation; and 3) providing
cities and counties with focused customer service using Board staff teams
from a variety of program areas. <BR>
<P>
Cities and counties are responsible for 50% disposal reduction. The cities
and counties are not always able to access Board assistance from various
programs in a coordinated manner. Staff designated as each city's or county's
point of contact are focused on document review, leaving little time for
coordinating assistance to meet individual city or county or regional needs.
Staff concentrated in the Sacramento area are not readily accessible to address
the unique needs of northern cities and counties or the bulk of the waste
stream in Southern California cities and counties.<BR>
<P>
Implementing ideas within this concept will require some increased staff
time and resources in addition to staff currently providing assistance. This
concept could be developed and implemented in a relatively short time frame.
While the Board has several good assistance programs, currently only informal
coordination of assistance takes place. Coordinated technical assistance
programs to meet regional or local conditions is likely to result in greater
diversion for cities and counties which are responsible for meeting the 50%
mandate.<BR>
<P>
Some additional programs may be needed, and existing programs would need
additional dedicated resources for implementation. Legislation would be required.
<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 27</B></U>: Staff recommends the Board direct staff to: 1)
expand use of the current informal practice of interdivisional teams working
with individual cities, counties or regions on program implementation issues;
and 2) pursue Board-sponsored legislation to streamline planning document
preparation and reporting. <BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>

<P>
<B><A NAME="28">28. Provide cities and counties program implementation tools
such as case studies, models and examples.<BR>
</A></B>
<P>
Ideas in this concept range from: 1) developing information on diversion
program financing options; 2) increasing the quantity of example documents
available through the Office of Local Assistance library; and 3) developing
model contracts for city and county use.<BR>
<P>
Cities and counties are experiencing increased requirements due to Federal
and State legislation, which is shifting responsibility for funding programs
to counties and cities. This decreases funding available for waste diversion
activities. Developing tools and models at the state level provides
cost-effective assistance to cities and counties which face waste diversion
budget decreases. <BR>
<P>
Assistance tools can be used across the state where needed. Disposal reduction,
while localized, can increase through use of Board-developed tools. Existing
Board tools and models, such as the Model Siting Element, have proven useful
to cities and counties in meeting mandates. <BR>
<P>
Some additional Board staff and resources would be needed for tool development,
production, and distribution. Some time would be required to develop and
distribute the tools.<BR>
<P>
Tool and model development can occur within the Board's existing programmatic
structure. Legislation would not be required.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 28</B></U><B>:</B> Staff recommends the Board direct staff
to: 1) work with cities and counties to determine the most useful or needed
tools and models; and 2) prepare a plan to prioritize, develop and distribute
the tools and models<BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="29">29. Facilitate partnerships between the Board, cities, counties,
and private entities to take advantage of economies of scale in achieving
the 50% diversion goal.<BR>
</A></B>
<P>
This concept includes suggestions which range from: 1) facilitating dialogue
between haulers, cities, counties and businesses to increase diversion; 2)
looking for opportunities to combine diversion efforts among state facilities,
city and county offices, and private businesses; and 3) assisting cities,
counties and/or businesses/chambers of commerce in forming voluntary waste
reduction coalitions similar to the Paper Reduction Coalition.<BR>
<P>
While cities and counties are mandated to reduce disposal, with few exceptions
private industry has no such mandates. Fostering cooperative relationships
between government and industry will not only develop a climate for expanding
diversion practices but also create economies of scale resulting in reduced
costs to all parties.<BR>
<P>
Partnerships can maximize the effectiveness of available resources and maximize
diversion. Ideas in this concept can be pursued immediately.<BR>
<P>
Successful partnerships require common goals and priorities. The Board has
found success in current and past partnerships; this concept would further
the work currently being accomplished. This concept does not require legislation
or regulatory changes. <BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 29</B></U><B>: </B>Staff recommends the Board direct staff
to: 1) coordinate efforts to identify potential partnerships within their
program areas; and 2) provide cities and counties additional encouragement
and guidance in developing regional agreements. <BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="30">30. Provide opportunities for internal communication and
networking both within the Board and between the Board, cities, counties
and businesses. <BR>
</A></B>
<P>
This concept include suggestions ranging from: 1) facilitating city and county
information sharing through an Internet discussion group; 2) soliciting input
on effectiveness of Board programs through structured interaction with city
and county representatives; and 3) increasing the number of issues of the
Board's Infocycling newsletter each year.<BR>
<P>
Cities and counties across the state have pursued many different programs
to decrease waste and have experienced different levels of success in
implementing disposal reduction programs. Information sharing, through formalized
meetings, workshops, and publications, can help cities, counties and businesses
to understand program options, be aware of potential benefits and pitfalls,
and implement programs appropriate to their specific circumstances.<BR>
<P>
Some ideas presented in this concept can be implemented immediately; others
can be integrated into existing programs over time. Most of these ideas can
be accomplished with existing staff and resources, others would have some
additional cost to the Board. Diversion can be increased within cites, counties
and businesses by learning more about various programs.<BR>
<P>
These ideas include both expansions of existing programs and some new
initiatives. No legislative changes are anticipated. <BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 30</B></U><B>:</B> Staff recommends the Board direct staff
to: 1) review and modify existing activities to increase information sharing;
and 2) incorporate suggestions for increased information sharing in proposals
for new activities. <BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="31">31. Provide training programs for Board staff, cities, counties
and other Board partners to promote disposal reduction program
implementation.<BR>
</A></B>
<P>
This concept includes suggestions which range from: 1) increasing technical
training for Board staff on diversion program implementation; and 2) hosting
workshops/training sessions for city, county and business recycling coordinators.
<BR>
<P>
Waste prevention and diversion practices continue to expand and change. Providing
ongoing training opportunities for Board staff and city and county staff
will further current successes in disposal reduction.<BR>
<P>
Maintaining an educated Board staff and promoting further education for city
and county staff will result in better formulated and executed programs,
resulting in increased disposal reduction. Training programs can be implemented
in a relatively short time period. Costs to obtain trainers may be reduced
through forging partnerships (see concept 29, above). <BR>
<P>
While the Board offers many excellent training programs, few focus on actual
program implementation. The existing training program could be enhanced to
include some of these ideas. This concept does not require legislation or
regulatory changes.<BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<U><B>Strategy 31</B></U><B>:</B> Staff recommends the Board support
implementation of the Integrated Training Program.<BR>
<BR>
<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="32">32. Increase Board staff presence/assistance in cities and
counties.<BR>
</A></B>
<P>
Suggestions in this concept range from: 1) assigning Board staff to work
temporarily in cities and counties; 2) exchanging staff between the Board
and cities or counties for a specified time period, and 3) using Board staff
as "consultants" to cities or counties needing assistance.<BR>
<P>
Many cities and counties have limited staff dedicated to solid waste issues.
Solid waste mandates can prove overwhelming to some of these cities and counties.
Providing Board staff to perform specific functions could result in increased
city and county compliance with Board mandates. There could be legal issues
with providing this type of assistance. Prioritizing requests for assistance
could be difficult. <BR>
<P>
These ideas could be implemented fairly quickly. Diversion may increase with
city and county staff able to devote more time to implementation tasks. Board
costs may be high due to additional staffing requirements. <BR>
<P>
This would be a new Board initiative. It does not require legislation or
regulatory changes.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 32</B></U><B>:</B> Staff recommends the Board direct staff
to analyze legal issues associated with Board staff performing work for cities
and counties; 2) if there are no legal issues, identify projects in which
Board staff could participate, develop a plan to assure accountability and
prioritize city and county requests for assistance.<BR>

Board analysis can be found in <A HREF="rank.htm">Attachment 2 </A>&nbsp;(370K

  Market Development
</H2>
<P>
  <HR>
The Market Development category consists of a wide variety of suggestions
related to improving markets for recycled materials through: 1) RMDZ assistance
and loans; 2) increasing work with industry associations which generate materials
which are a significant portion of the waste stream; 3) identifying and promoting
use of backhaul to reduce the cost of diversion; and 4) expanding minimum
content requirements. <BR>
<P>
<A NAME="top">The Market Development panel recommends the following five
concepts for further Board consideration:</A><BR>

  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<B><A NAME="33">33. Increase outreach into business community to increase
priority material recycling and Buy Recycled. </A><BR>
</B>
<P>
This concept consists of ideas ranging from: 1) expand outreach program with
the business community to recycle a large percentage of waste; 2) focus efforts
and resources on diversion from commercial sources of the most dense material;
and 3) improve networking between Board staff, cities, counties and businesses
involved in diversion by soliciting attendance at periodic regional meetings.
<BR>
<P>
Cities and counties have the state mandate to reduce disposal by 50% within
the next three years. With only limited exceptions, private industry has
no such mandates, but plays a critical role in the diversion/market/buy recycled
continuum. Statewide, businesses generate about 55% of the total waste stream.
Given this reality, the Board can be most effective by providing outreach
directly to the business community, providing information, assistance, and
approaches which make business sense to these parties to encourage their
voluntary participation. <BR>
<P>
This concept expands existing programs and would have some additional cost
to the Board. The cost to cities and counties is expected to be minimal.
This concept could have quite a high impact on diverting the waste stream.
Depending on how agressively this activity is pursued, it could be optimized
by in a few years. <BR>
<P>
This concept would not require legislation and is an expansion of existing
efforts.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 33</B></U><B>:</B> Staff recommends the Board direct staff
to: 1) work in cooperation with cities and counties to identify the best
businesses, locations, and industries to target; 2) develop information for
businesses (e.g. case studies); and 3) provide outreach to those selected
businesses with city, county and trade association support.<BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="34">34. Increase green waste diversion. </A><BR>
</B>
<P>
This concept consists of ideas ranging from: 1) devote greater resources
to increase alternatives for the public to divert yard waste; 2) expand markets
for ground up green waste/mulch through market development research; 3) require
county/city or private composting in all cities and counties and 4) use idle
city/county trucks to deliver mulch and compost products to residents and
businesses.<BR>
<P>
Green waste continues to represent nearly a third of California's waste stream;
most cities and counties simply will not be able to divert 50% without
significant prevention, collection and marketing programs for this material.
Large-scale marketing opportunities abound, in areas such as agriculture,
nurseries, building construction, and landscaping. Commercial fertilizer
companies have expressed an interest in forming a partnership with composters
to provide products having both organic and nutrient enhancements. <BR>
<P>
There would be some cost to Board to expand its existing green waste efforts
both in the form of contract funds and staff. The cost to cities and counties
would be low. The increased markets are expected to be in place within 3
years. <BR>
<P>
Some suggestions in this concept would require legislation, specifically,
requiring county, city or private composting in all cities and counties.
Other ideas mentioned above could be accomplished without legislation. This
concept is an expansion of existing efforts. <BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 34</B></U><B>:</B> Staff recommends the Board direct staff
to: 1) work with cities, counties and private industry to expand the Board's
compost outreach efforts to farmers, nurseries, landscapers, and other State
agencies; 2) research and develop an effective approach to increase use of
mulch and compost by promising target groups; and 3) based on Board discussion
decide whether to pursue legislation.<BR>
<P>
<B><A NAME="35">35. Increase awareness and information about supply, location,
and flow of materials.</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
This concept consists of ideas ranging from: 1) provide answers to industry's
first questions of quality, location, and price of materials to make market
development work; 2) hold workshops to share information about successful
local market development programs; and 3) set up groups to assist rural cities
and counties in finding markets for their recyclables. <BR>
<P>
The Market Development panel assumed the Board would focus on 4-5 major
commercial/industrial areas rather than the entire state and focus on paper,
compostables and inerts which have the largest impact on the waste stream.
<BR>
<P>
To decide to invest in a new business or new equipment using recycled feedstock,
industry must have confidence that an adequate quantity of recycled materials
of acceptable quality is available at a price competitive with virgin
alternatives. Although the business will generally conduct its own assessment,
region-specific information and leads provided by the Board and/or cities
and counties can provide a cost-saving service. Such a service could entice
a business to begin its analysis and increase the chance of bringing recycling
industries to the State and/or encouraging the production of recycled-content
products sooner. <BR>
<P>
There would be some additional costs to the Board to expand its efforts and
moderate costs to cities and counties. The waste stream reduction is expected
to be relatively high. <BR>
<P>
This concept would not require legislation and is an expansion of existing
efforts.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 35</B></U><B>:</B> Staff recommends the Board direct staff
to identify the most effective options for collecting and publicizing regional
supply and location information for paper, compostables, and inerts (paving,
concrete, drywall) in the four or five largest commercial/industrial areas
of California. <BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>

<P>
<B><A NAME="36">36. Develop markets and promote reuse of construction and
demolition (C &amp; D) materials.</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
This concept consists of ideas ranging from: 1) encourage business departments
to allow use of used building materials; 2) introduce legislation requiring
Caltrans to test and produce recycled asphalt specifications; and 3) work
with builders and the housing industry to inform them about use of recycled
products in their construction.<BR>
<P>
C &amp; D materials represent 20-25% of the waste stream. Reuse or recycling
of C &amp; D materials can, in many applications, represent a substantial
cost savings over the use of new material. <BR>
<P>
This concept would have low cost to the Board, cities and counties. The impact
on reducing the waste stream would be moderate. <BR>
<P>
Some suggestions in this concept would require legislation, such as requiring
Caltrans to test and produce recycled asphalt specifications. Other ideas
mentioned above could be accomplished without legislation. This concept is
a modification of an existing program.
<P>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 36</B></U><B>:</B> Staff recommends the Board direct staff
to: 1) focus on the reuse of C &amp; D materials which includes encouraging
industry associations and building departments to allow use of used building
materials; and 2) report on whether Caltrans wishes to pursue legislation
on testing and producing recylced asphalt specifications. <BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="37">37. Expand outreach and technical assistance of the RMDZ
Zone and Loan Program.</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
This concept consists of ideas ranging from: 1) extend the RMDZ program,
and expand its range of incentives to bring businesses to California; 2)
prepare case studies of lessons learned to share with other zones and nonzone
entities; and 3) expand outreach to traditional lending institutions to promote
loans to recycling businesses.<BR>
<P>
The Board's Zone and Loan Program has proven to be an effective service to
cities, counties and businesses. The Board has relied on Zone administrators
and its own staff to promote loans with little direct targeting of the most
viable businesses or the promotion of private funding sources (banks and
other conventional sources). Opportunities exist to work in cooperation with
the traditional private lenders to make recycling business loans more attractive
to them by arranging joint financing, thereby beginning to bring recycling
loans to the private lenders while still limiting their exposure. <BR>
<P>
The program activities could be expanded, not necessarily geographically
but rather through outreach and information, to promote the lessons learned;
successes and failures. The Zones have a strong network to share one another's
programs and results, but this information has not been effectively communicated
to non-zone communities to guide their waste management decisions. <BR>
<P>
This concept could be accomplished at little or no cost to the Board, cities
and counties. Implementing this concept could be accomplished fairly
quickly.<BR>
<P>
This concept would not require legislation and is an expansion of existing
efforts.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 37</B></U><B>:</B> Staff recommends the Board direct staff
to incorporate the following suggestions in the upcoming February 5, 1997
workshop: 1) identification of opportunities for working in cooperation with
the traditional private lenders to make recycling business loans more attractive
to private lenders; and options for targeting viable businesses. <BR>

  Waste Prevention
</H2>
<P>
  <HR>
The Waste Prevention category consists of suggestions related to reducing
waste generation and waste disposal. Suggestions in this category ranged
from: 1) sponsor and coordinate industry specific waste reduction/recycling
workshops; 2) encourage businesses which are successfully using waste prevention
techniques to instruct other businesses; 3) ban green waste at landfills
for cities and counties not meeting the 25% and 50% goal; and 4) streamline
the WRAP awards application form.<BR>
<P>
The Waste Prevention Panel found it difficult to use the criteria related
to the sphere of influence for population, cities and counties, and sectors
because it was difficult to estimate the sphere of influence for activities
that prevent waste generation. <BR>
<P>
<A NAME="top">The Waste Prevention Panel recommends the Board consider the
following four concepts further:</A>

<P>
<A NAME="38"><B>38. Ban green waste from landfill disposal for cities and
counties not meeting 25%</B> <B>and/or 50%.</B></A><B><BR>
</B>
<P>
This concept consists of the suggestion to ban green waste from landfills
in areas unable to meet the 25% and/or 50% goal. <BR>
<P>
At approximately 20% of the waste stream, yard waste (grass clippings, tree
trimmings, prunings, etc.) is the largest single component of California's
waste stream, even crossing sector lines. This idea imposes yard waste prevention
on those cities and counties unable or unwilling to meet the current IWMA
goals, but leaves flexibility to those cities and counties which have
demonstrated successful diversion. Many options to manage yard waste in a
manner other than disposal either exist or are readily implementable for
all cities and counties. These options range from grasscycling and home
composting, to large scale processing and ADC. More than 21 states implement
some form of a disposal ban for this material. Those states with the most
success in implementing yard waste disposal bans can be evaluated for use
as models. The primary barriers to preventing disposal of this material in
California are politics and moderate start-up costs. <BR>
<P>
Significant opportunity exists for the private sector to play a major role
in either collection, processing, marketing, or final use of end-products.
Though considered low value, ready markets exist for this material. <BR>
<P>
There would be some additional cost to Board to expand existing efforts and
a small cost to cities and counties. The impact on the waste stream would
be moderately high, up to 20%. This concept could be accomplished in the
next few years. <BR>
<P>
This concept would require legislation and if implemented would expand existing
efforts.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 38</B></U><B>:</B> Staff recommends the Board direct staff
to: 1) identify those states with the most success in implementing yard waste
disposal bans; 2) set up a Board workshop to discuss banning greenwaste at
landfills for cities and counties not meeting the 25% and 50% goals; and
3) based on that discussion decide whether to consider the concept and

<P>
<B><A NAME="39">39. Require unit pricing for cities and counties not meeting
25% and/or 50%.</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
This concept stands alone and did not have other ideas grouped within it.
It is similar to concepts 12 and 13 above, but would limit requirements for
unit pricing to cities and counties not meeting the IWMA goals. Unit pricing
is a waste collection billing system in which the amount paid by each waste
generator is proportional to the amount of waste disposed. <BR>
<P>
Whether it is variable garbage can rate options for the residential sector,
or variable contract options provided to the business community,
"paying-as-you-throw" provides a sound basis and economic incentive upon
which to build other waste reduction and diversion programs. Without mandates
and penalties, the extent to which a waste reduction message will penetrate
a given population is limited. Financial impacts, both positive and negative,
for certain behaviors can more profoundly encourage a larger portion of a
population than could an environmental message alone. <BR>
<P>
Evidence of behavioral changes in areas that introduce unit pricing systems
tends to support this theory. Several communities report a 15-60% reduction
in disposal shortly after implementing unit pricing. <BR>
<P>
There would be some cost to the Board to undertake new work and the concept
would be moderately expensive for cities and counties to implement initially.
The concept would have a significant impact on reducing the waste stream.
<BR>
<P>
This concept would require legislation and such legislation would be a new
effort. The Board has previously studied unit pricing and compiled various
implementation results from other states and localities in California.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 39</B></U><B>: </B>Staff recommends the Board direct staff
to prepare of an agenda item, discussed in strategies 12 and 13, regarding
California Unit Pricing Policy which includes consideration of requiring
unit pricing by cities and counties not meeting the 25% and 50% goals. Based
on the discussion, the Board could consider pursuing Board-sponsored
legislation.<BR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="40">40. Expand resource efficiency promotion to business and
industry.</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
This concept consists of ideas ranging from: 1) focus on waste prevention
(including energy) for the commercial sector since it is generally cost
effective; 2) support cities' and counties' business waste prevention campaigns
with materials, money, etc.; and 3) focus on disposal cost avoidance when
the Board is assisting businesses in waste reduction efforts.<BR>
<P>
Business responds to impacts on its bottom line. Fortunately, many, if not
most, waste reducing practices can be shown to improve efficiencies, saving
business dollars on resource use as well as disposal costs. Existing efforts
to educate business (e.g. Business Waste Reduction Kits) focus on cost savings
in order to sway private sector decision makers. Widespread awareness and
adoption of waste reducing, resource efficient practices by the sector
responsible for more than half of California's waste would have significant
impacts on tonnage going for disposal. <BR>
<P>
There would be some additional cost to Board to expand existing efforts and
little or no cost to cities and counties. This concept could significantly
impact reduce the waste stream.<BR>
<P>
This concept would not require legislation and is an expansion of existing
efforts.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 40</B></U><B>:</B> Staff recommends the Board direct staff
to: 1) expand documentation of business sectors where resource efficiency
has been successfully applied; and 2) develop a strategy to effectively publicize
resource efficiency to other businesses. <BR>

<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="41">41. Implement the Transport Packaging Initiative.</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
This concept consists of ideas ranging from: 1) work to reduce packaging
used by manufacturers instead of waiting to recycle packaging; 2) work with
packaging industry to encourage the use of multi-use and longer lasting pallets;
and 3) implement a transport packaging initiative.<BR>
<P>
There is great potential for improvements in the efficiency of product delivery
infrastructure as it relates to material use, reuse, and recyclability. Cardboard
(10% of the waste stream), wood (8% of the waste stream) , and plastic (2-4%
of the waste stream) are materials with known value and techniques for managing
outside of disposal. The fostering of technological advances in light-weighting,
durability, and recovery could have positive impacts on the amount of transport
packaging materials previously discarded after single use. <BR>
<P>
This concept would have some additional cost for the Board to expand existing
efforts. The cost to cities and counties would be inexpensive, yet they would
directly realize the diversion benefits of this initiative. For those businesses
which adopt efficient transport packaging, the impact on the waste stream
is quite high; however, the impact on their bottom line would be equally
significant. <BR>
<P>
This concept would not require legislation and is an expansion of existing
efforts.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 41</B></U><B>:</B> Staff recommends that the Board support
initiation of the transport packaging initiative.<BR>
<P>

Board analysis can be found in <A HREF="rank.htm">Attachment 2</A> (370K

  Facility Operations/Permitting and Enforcement
</H2>
<P>
  <HR>
This category addresses ideas which are related to diversion occurring at
landfills and diversion facility operation, permitting, and enforcement.
<BR>
<P>
Many of the ideas related to this category are not being analyzed as part
of the 50% Initiative because they addressed landfill permitting issues not
related to the 50% diversion mandate. These and other facility regulatory
issues will be considered as part of the Permitting and Enforcement Division's
"Other 50% Initiative". The "Other 50% Initiative" will evaluate the overall
organization and functions of the Permitting and Enforcement Division, with
the goals of increasing efficiency and better serving the Board's external
and internal customers. The "Other 50% Initiative" is currently projected
to be presented to the Permitting and Enforcement Committee in spring of
1997. <BR>
<P>
The standard 50% Initiative analysis method was applied to the concepts.
<BR>
<P>
<A NAME="top">The Facility Operations/Permitting and Enforcement Panel recommends
the Board consider the following three concepts further:</A><BR>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="42"><B>42. Conduct additional workshops and training on organic
material recycling. Focus on accepted practices and include operators and
users.</B> </A><BR>
<P>
Organic materials represent the major component of the waste stream to target
for diversion. Resolution of technical and regulatory problem areas of organic
material recycling, and a workshop and training forum for problem solving
between all parties is needed to increase diversion of organic materials.
This concept addresses the need for such a forum. <BR>
<P>
Staff are conducting workshops and training on organic material recycling
odor issues in November 1996 and are expected to report back to the Board
shortly after completion. A second broader workshop to include market related
and other issues is being considered for Summer 1997. The results of the
first workshop and response from the attendees should be used to develop
the concept further.<BR>
<P>
This concept scored highest in this category based primarily on low cost
to the Board and outside parties, large amount of the waste stream targeted,
and short time to optimize the effect on the waste stream. However, the potential
overall organic waste component likely to be diverted was considered small
to moderate.<BR>
<P>
Although a new program for workshops is being initiated by the Permitting
and Enforcement and Markets Divisions, this concept was considered an expansion
of the existing work. No legislation is required.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 42:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct staff to: 1)
analyze the results of the first workshop and response from the attendees;
and 2) develop a plan based on the results for expanding organic materials
workshops and training. <BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="43">43. Provide fact sheet or guidance document on diversion
activities that can be conducted at the disposal facilities.</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
With the recent passage of AB 1647, disposal facilities are now recognized
as a potential market for beneficial reuse of diverted waste materials. Examples
include the use of alternative daily cover, mulch, shredded tires, and
construction and demolition wastes. The Board has received numerous inquiries
from outside parties on this issue but does not currently have a mechanism
in place to provide information for other than alternative daily cover. This
concept addresses the need for such information. <BR>
<P>
The LEA Advisory process is currently in place to provide the information
recommended. This concept can be placed on the ongoing schedule for LEA
Advisories and should be able to be implemented within six months by staff
without additional cost.
<P>
A similar document could be prepared for city and county diversion planners
who do not normally use LEA advisories.<BR>
<P>
This concept scored high in the category based primarily on low cost to the
Board and others and short time to optimize the effect on the waste stream.
However, the potential for diversion was considered small to moderate.<BR>
<P>
This concept was considered a new program. No legislation is required.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 43:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct staff to: 1)
place providing information on diversion activities that can be conducted
at disposal facilities on the ongoing schedule for LEA Advisories; and 2)
prepare a similar fact sheet for city and county diversion planners and diversion
facility operators. <BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../images/top.gif" BORDER=0></A></I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="44">44. Provide fact sheet or guidance document on diversion
activities that can be conducted at the disposal facilities.</A><BR>
</B>
<P>
Because of existing infrastructure and environmental control systems, landfills
and disposal sites may be excellent sites for construction and operation
of diversion facilities which are needed to increase waste diversion. With
the recent adoption of tiered permitting requirements and ongoing tier slotting
process, permitting and regulatory requirements for diversion facilities
at existing sites is an important issue. Guidance to LEAs and operators is
needed on this issue to help resolve problems which could prevent increased
diversion.<BR>
<P>
The LEA Advisory process is currently in place to provide the information
recommended. This concept can be placed on the ongoing schedule for LEA
Advisories and should be able to be implemented within six months by staff
without additional cost. A similar document could be prepared for city and
county diversion planners who do not normally use LEA advisories.<BR>
<P>
This concept scored high in the category based primarily on low cost to the
Board and others. The potential for diversion was considered small to moderate.
Because diversion facilities would have to be permitted and built, the time
to optimize was longer than for concepts 42 and 43 but should have an optimum
effect within a few years. <BR>
<P>
This concept was considered a new program. No legislation is required.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Strategy 44:</B></U> Staff recommends the Board direct staff to: 1)
place providing guidance to facilitate siting diversion facilities at disposal
sites on the ongoing schedule for LEA Advisories; and 2) prepare a similar
fact sheet for city and county diversion planners and diversion facility
operators. <BR>
<P>
The Facility Operations/Permitting and Enforcement panel also analyzed the
concepts of total bans on green waste and other recyclable materials from
landfill disposal. Banning green waste from landfill disposal scored highest
in the category for potential effect on diversion. The green waste ban would
address green waste other than that used as alternative daily cover (ADC),
since AB 1647 has established that ADC is not disposal. The demonstrated
success for implementation also scored high on the basis of the number of
states (21) that have banned green waste from landfills. The panel did not
recommend banning green waste from disposal at all landfills because of the
high cost to public and private entities outside the Board and the long time
required to enact controversial legislation to require such a ban. However,
the Facility Operations/Permitting and Enforcement panel concurs with the
Waste Prevention panel concept 38 of further board consideration of banning
green waste disposal at landfills by cities and counties not meeting the
25% and/or 50% goals. <BR>
<P>

Board analysis can be found in <A HREF="rank.htm">Attachment 2</A> &nbsp;(370K

<FONT SIZE=+3><B>Working Definitions</B></FONT>
<P>

Many people working in solid waste are confused by terms we
use all the time, especially when these words have evolved recently.
Below are selected working definitions that aim to alleviate confusion
and help us communicate amongst ourselves and the public. 

<P>
<A HREF="wporgnc/wpcomp1.htm" >Composting:</A> The biological decomposition
of organic materials such as leaves, grass clippings, brush, and
food waste into a soil amendment.

<P>
<A HREF="wporgnc/wpgras1.htm" >Grasscycling:</A> The practice of leaving
clippings on the lawn while mowing.

<P>
<B>Pollution Prevention:</B> Preventing all forms of pollution,
including toxics and other pollutants emitted into air, water,
and land. Waste Prevention is a subset of pollution prevention.

<P>
<B>Precycling:</B>  Making purchasing decisions that will reduce
waste such as buying goods with less packaging (e.g., goods in
bulk or concentrated form), choosing products that will last longer,
and avoiding single-use or disposable products.

<P>
<B>Recycling:</B>  The process of collecting, sorting, cleansing,
treating, and reconstituting materials that would otherwise become
solid waste, and returning them to the economic mainstream in
the form of raw material for new, reused, or reconstituted products
which meet the quality standards necessary to be used in the marketplace.

<P>
<B>Reuse:</B> is the recovery or reapplication of a package
or product for uses similar or identical to its originally intended
application, without manufacturing or preparation processes that
significantly alter the original package or product.

<P>
<B>Source Reduction:</B>  See Waste Prevention.

<P>
<B>Waste Diversion:</B>  As defined in CA statute, is the combined
efforts of waste prevention, reuse, and recycling practices.

<P>
<B>Waste Minimization:</B>  Refers to elimininating, reducing
and recycling of hazardous waste.

<P>
<A HREF="wpwhat.htm" >Waste Prevention:</A> Any action undertaken
by an individual or organization to eliminate or reduce the amount
or toxicity of materials before they enter the municipal solid
waste stream. This action is intended to conserve resources, promote
efficiency, and reduce pollution.

<P>
<B>Waste Reduction:</B>  The combined efforts of waste prevention,
reuse, composting, and recycling practices. (Some groups use this
term synonymously with Source Reduction so check out how it is
being used to avoid confusion.)

<P>
<A HREF="wporgnc/wrmfct.htm" >Worm composting:</A>  Worms feed on slowly
decomposing materials (e.g, vegetable scraps) to produce a nutrient
rich soil amendment, in a controlled environment.

<P>
<A HREF="wporgnc/wrmfct.htm" >Vermicomposting:</A>  See worm composting.

<P>
<A HREF="wporgnc/wpxeri.htm" >Xeriscaping:</A>  the practice of landscaping
with slow growing, drought-tolerant plants.

<P>


<EM>Waste prevention means eliminating waste before it is
created. It's a proven cost-effective approach that helps
both your bottom line and the environment. Combined with a
comprehensive recycling effort, hospitals can significantly
reduce their waste. All activities on this fact sheet have
been implemented by some hospital in the United States or
have been provided by a medical professional.</EM><HR><P>
<STRONG>Waste, Here Today and  Tomorrow</STRONG><P>
Californians generate 45 million tons of waste each year. 
That's equivalent to eight pounds per person per day!
Meanwhile, landfills are filling up as it becomes more
costly. <P>
To address this problem, in 1990 the California legislature 
mandated that local jurisdictions reduce their solid waste
generation by 25 percent in 1995 and 50 percent in the year
2000. All of us, at home and work, have a responsibility to
conserve resources for future generations.<P>
Fortunately, many waste prevention practices save money.
Waste reduction, the combination of waste prevention and
recycling efforts, makes good business sense.<P>
Waste reduction begins by understanding what is purchased, 
how goods are used, and what is discarded, and then is put
to use by finding ways to eliminate, reduce, reuse, and
recycle materials.<P>
<EM>Contrary to popular belief, non-hazardous medical 
waste makes up nearly 3/4 of the waste generated 
in a hospital and should not be overlooked.</EM><P>
A good strategy is to target the largest components of the
waste stream and do the easy waste reduction steps first.
Below is a chart showing the solid waste composition in
hospitals in the city of Los Angeles.  Although waste varies, in most
hospitals the largest components of the waste stream are
paper (especially cardboard, mixed paper, newspapers, and
high-grade paper), plastics (especially film plastic), food
waste, and disposable linens (a combination of paper and
other materials). Yard trimmings may be a much higher percent of your waste stream if your
hospital has a large landscaped area. See Appendix A for a
more detailed listing of these materials.<P>
Along with preventing waste and recycling, it is important
to purchase products made from recycled materials. This
makes recycling successful by stimulating demand for
recycled materials.<P>
And finally, consider rewarding employees for their
successful waste reduction ideas. Some hospitals reward
employees with cash bonuses and recognition.<P>
Below are ideas to help you identify waste reduction
opportunities at your hospital. By setting up a solid waste
management program you can turn ideas into action. (See
Sources of Information on page 6 for guide books on how to
set up your own solid waste management program.)<P><HR>
<STRONG>Percent Solid Waste Compostion (By Weight) In Hospitals*</STRONG><P><IMG SRC="../wpimage/charthsp.gif">
<P>
          *Based on composition of waste in nine Los Angeles
City hospitals (1990)<HR>

<STRONG>Custodial Services</STRONG><P> Renegotiate contracts with haulers of "red bag" or
regulated medical waste to provide clean and reusable containers.<P>

 <EM>   The NewYork City Department of Sanitation estimates    
that a l,000-bed hospital switching from disposable 
   to reusable containers for sharp medical instruments   
    would achieve:</EM><P>



<UL>
<LI>Cost savings per year: $175,000<BR>
<LI> Waste prevention in pounds per year: 34,000

Eliminate plastic trash bag liners in administrative
areas.

    <EM>The New York City Department of Sanitation estimates   
    that a l,000-bed hospital making this change would 
    achieve:</EM><P>

<P>

Buy most cleaning substances in 55-gallon drums that are
refilled by the supplier.
<P>
Use concentrated cleaning solutions that staff mix as
needed.
<P>
Use washable mop heads instead of disposable ones.
<P>
<HR>

<STRONG>Purchasing</STRONG><P>

Buy in bulk whenever possible; it saves packaging.<P>
<EM> Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital (341 beds) in           
    Portland, Oregon switched from buying juice in 32-oz   
     glass containers to 60-oz plastic containers that the  
     hospital recycles. </EM><P>
        <UL>
<LI>Cost savings per year: $125 <BR>
<LI> Waste prevention in pounds per year: 2,500
</UL>
<P>

Select or ask vendors to follow packaging preference
criteria:
<UL>
<LI> No packaging or minimal packaging. <BR>               
<LI> Consumable, returnable, refillable, reusable packaging.<BR>
<LI> Recyclable packaging/recycled material in
packaging.
</UL>
<P>

Improve ordering practices so perishable products don't
become outdated and unusable.<P>
Cut down on multiple subscriptions of medical publications
by asking staff to share journals and magazines.<P>
Reuse packaging.<P>
    <EM>Kaiser Permanente Northwest Region receives more       
than 24,000 glasses and contact lens boxes annually. 
The Region started reusing 2,000 of these boxes 
to mail eyeglasses instead of buying new boxes. 
Remaining boxes are available for pharmacy mailings.</EM>
<P>
<HR>

<STRONG>Patient-Care Supplies</STRONG><P>
 
Determine if cloth towels can be used and later sold for
rags.<P>
 Replace paper towels with air dryers.<P>
   
<EM>The New York City Department of Sanitation estimates   
that a l,000-bed hospital replacing paper towels with 
air dyers would achieve:</EM>
<P>
       <UL>
<LI>Cost savings per year: $45,000<BR>
<LI>Waste prevention in pounds per year: 200,000
</UL>
<P>

  Use cloth diapers.<P>
   <EM> Kaiser Permanente's Northwest Region switched from     
disposable to cloth diapers.  Any hospital making this
change needs to follow procedures for infection
control and skin care. Kaiser found there was no
change in costs or savings it was a cost neutral
change:</EM><P>
         <UL>
<LI> there was no adverse effect on patient or staff 
safety; and<BR>
<LI> it decreased the amount of solid waste 
going to landfills.<BR><P>
</UL>

  Use worn diapers as cleaning rags.<P>
 Provide decubitus-care mattresses instead of foam 
"egg-carton" mattresses.<P>
    <EM> Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon     
     (341-bed facility) purchased several hundred permanent
     waterproof mattresses to replace about 96 percent of   
   disposable egg crate foam mattresses (it is still
necessary to use foam mattresses in some situations).

<EM><DL>
<DT>The lodging industry in California, with over 396,000 guest
rooms, produces approximately 600,000 tons of garbage every year!
Hoteliers have many opportunities to reduce waste by establishing
waste prevention and recycling programs and by purchasing recycled
products. Besides reducing waste and saving money, these actions
can increase employee morale and customer satisfaction.<DD></DL></EM>
<HR><P>
Management should adopt an environmental policy to reflect how
the company sees itself in relation to the environment, neighbors,
and the people it employs and serves. Chains with multiple locations
may want to encourage each hotel to evaluate and establish its
own program.
<P>
For your program to be successful, management should appropriate
the necessary staff and funds to run your environmental program,
and offer training to staff.
<P>
Promote your program and successes to guests and conference attendees
through your advertising.
<P>
Conduct a waste evaluation to identify waste prevention ideas
and estimate the amount of recyclable materials generated at your
hotel. Chances are, you can use many of the following ideas, which
are being successfully used by many hotels and motels, and can
help you reduce waste and save money!
<P>
  <B>Waste Prevention</B>
<P>
Waste prevention means not creating waste in the first place.
Waste that is not created does not have to be disposed, which
saves money.
<UL>
<LI>Minimize waste by replacing disposable room amenities with
refillable or reusable substitutes.
<LI>Establish purchasing guidelines to encourage the use of durable,
repairable equipment, and high-quality, reusable products such
as linen and tableware.
<LI>Donate soap and toiletries to local shelters.
<LI>Distribute restaurant condiments from behind the counter,
rather than in single-service packets.
<LI>Donate unserved food to local food banks. California's &quot;Good
Samaritan&quot; law protects the donor from liability if the food
is properly stored and handled. Produce scraps can be composted
on site, or donated to local farmers for composting or animal
feed.
<LI>Reuse old linens as aprons or towels, or donate them to local
charities.
<LI>Donate old furniture and equipment to institutions or charity.
<LI>Purchase cleaning supplies in bulk to minimize packaging and
save money. For example, concentrated cleaning solutions can be
diluted on site and dispensed in reusable pump-spray bottles.
<LI>Ask your vendors and suppliers to provide supplies that are
not overpackaged. Ask them to take back excess packaging for reuse.
<LI>Change lighting from incandescent to fluorescent. Fluorescent
bulbs last much longer, meaning that you have fewer bulbs to dispose
of and spend less time changing them. The initial outlay will
quickly be paid for by reduced energy costs.
<LI>Practice grasscycling, that is, the natural recycling of grass
by leaving clippings on the lawn to decompose. They quickly release
valuable nutrients back into the soil. Have groundskeepers mulch
or compost landscape wastes.
</UL>

<P>
<EM>Le Chateau Montbello in Quebec, Canada has constructed a composting
site, which will be used to fertilize and mulch its herb garden.
<P>
The Ritz-Carlton in Pasadena makes aprons and napkins from stained,
worn linens. By also determining just the right amount of chemicals
to use in laundering, the hotel saved $45,000 in one year!
<P>
The Seattle Sheraton Hotel and Towers donated 2000 telephones
from guest rooms to a local housing organization, which made them
available to low-income tenants.
<P>
Hotels in Florida have saved up to 50 percent in waste disposal costs
by implementing aggressive waste reduction efforts. These savings
come from reduced garbage hauling costs and the sale of recyclable
materials.
</EM>
<P>
<B>Recycling</B>
<P>
Hotels and motels generate large amounts of highly recyclable
materials, such as office paper, newspaper, corrugated cardboard,
plastics, metals, and glass.  Work with your waste hauler or recycler
to arrange the details of your recycling program.
<UL>
<LI>Consider recycling materials, such as glass, cans, cardboard,
plastic, and cooking grease from the restaurant.
<LI>Work with suppliers to minimize the use of materials that
are difficult to recycle, such waxed cardboard.
<LI>Collect old telephone books, magazines, newspapers, beverage
containers, etc., from guest rooms.  Put out recycling containers for guests to use or have cleaning
staff collect them.
<LI>Recycle office materials. Examples are computer and bond paper,
beverage containers, copier and printer cartridges.
<LI>Recycle motor oils, antifreeze, paint, etc., used by groundskeeping
and maintenance staff.
</UL>
<BR>
<B>Buy Recycled Products</B>
<P>
The collection of recyclable materials is only the first step
of the process we call recycling. Interesting new products are
being manufactured from your recyclables and turning up in the
marketplace. When you buy goods with recycled content, your purchases
help to create a demand for materials collected in recycling programs.
Remember to ask about a product's &quot;post-consumer content&quot;.
This means the product was made from materials that were used
and recycled by consumers, rather than from manufacturing wastes.
<P>Review your existing purchasing policies to assure they do
not exclude buying goods with recycled content.  Remove discriminatory standards that prevent the purchase
of recycled products. State in bid packets that your organization expects vendors to supply products with recycled content.

<B>Waste Reduction at Meetings, Conferences and Expos</B>
<P>
Conferences and trade shows are often overlooked as a major source
of waste generated at hotels. The average trade show attendee
takes home up to ten pounds of paper, and the typical expo generates
the equivalent of 170 trees in waste paper! Hotels and meeting
planners can reduce waste by planning low-waste meetings. Work
with the corporations and associations holding the meetings, and
urge them to try some of these ideas:
<UL>
<LI>Announce to participating corporations, associations, and
attendees, through mailings, that waste prevention and recycling
will be taking place.
<LI>Urge attendees to reduce waste in their guest rooms as well.
For instance, a guest may choose not to have linens and towels
replaced every day.
<LI>If plastic badge holders are used, place collection bins at
the meeting to collect them for reuse at another conference.
<LI>Don't offer wasteful gifts and premiums that attendees are
likely to just throw away after the conference. Give something
useful, such as commuter mugs with the corporation logo.
<LI>Ask trade show and expo vendors to limit the amount of material
they bring to the show floor to that which they plan to distribute.
(Some hotels are asking vendors to remove the materials, rather
than picking up the tab for disposal or recycling.)
<LI>Use recycled paper products and plan for recycling by placing
recycling containers at all meeting sites. 
<LI>Print promotional materials on both sides of the paper, and minimize the use of glossy paper.

<B><H2>Waste Reduction Opportunities in the Landscape Industry</H2></B>
<A NAME="top"></A>
<P>

<EM>The landscaping of a front yard, backyard, or business grounds is a long-term investment requiring significant resource input. With a little forethought, these resource requirements can 
be efficiently managed, reducing the amount of waste often produced by such projects.  Additionally, current recycling efforts underway throughout the State of California have made available many new products that contain or use recycled materials. By using "recycled content" landscaping products, virgin natural resources are conserved, markets for the collected recyclable materials are strengthened, and residents and professionals can save money. </EM>
<HR>
<STRONG>Landscaping Supplies - Purchasing
and Packaging</STRONG>
<P>
The first step in waste reduction takes place when a product is purchased. Look for landscaping supplies that are available without excess packaging, such as in bulk form. Consumers 
can influence manufacturers to produce products with minimal packaging or packaging containing recycled content by "voting with their dollars," or even contacting manufacturers directly and expressing purchase preferences.
<P>
Fertilizers and pesticides can be purchased in bulk quantities, reusable containers, or water-soluble packages. Bulk 
packaging reduces the amount of waste per unit of product, and usually costs less. Reusable packages are designed to be returned to the manufacturer or distributor to be refilled. Some manufacturers produce water-soluble packaging that 
is incorporated into the final product.
<P>
In the landscape industry, the reuse or recycling of plant containers can have a dramatic impact on the waste stream from landscape operations. Nurseries may accept certain empty plastic flats, as well as plastic and wood plant containers, for reuse. Wood containers can be reused as decorative planters, cut up into stakes, or ground up for mulch. Plastic containers that are not reused can be recycled and incorporated into products such as plastic lumber for landscaping timbers, benches, or playground equipment. Both large and small generators of used containers should consider "material exchange" services, such as <A HREF="../../calmax/calmax.htm"> CALMAX</A>, to find individuals interested in reusing these materials.
<P>
<STRONG>Landscape Design and Installation
<P>
Plant Selection</STRONG>
<P>
With appropriate landscape design and plant selection, the landscape waste stream can be significantly reduced, in turn reducing the overall waste stream.  An effective way to reduce waste by design is by using plants that require less pruning. Certain trees and shrubs, most often those that are slow growing or drought tolerant, need little or no pruning and produce less waste. Choose plants that fit the available space 
in order to minimize pruning needs. In addition, the use of both winter and summer perennials can give year-round color without the cost and waste of replacing annual plants.
<P>
Further waste reduction can be accomplished by designing the landscape based on anticipated use (turf vs. shrubbery), and then purchasing plants that require less maintenance and water. The installation of perennial ground covers that do not require replacement every year can be an attractive alternative to turf and result in a reduction in waste. If turf is selected, choose dwarf or other slow growing varieties that require less water.
<P>
<STRONG>Irrigation Systems</STRONG>
<P>
The proper design and operation of irrigation systems can help reduce unnecessary excess growth, maintenance requirements, and subsequent waste. Use of drip irrigation places water 
next to the plant, enhancing plant health, as well as minimizing weed growth. Less weeding saves labor costs and decreases the amount of organic matter in the waste stream.
<P>
<STRONG>Soil Amendments</STRONG>
<P>
In addition to plant selection and watering, soil preparation is an important factor in landscape waste reduction. There are soil enhancement products on the market that contain up to 100 percent recycled content. Compost, which has been used by farmers for centuries, is a ready-to-use soil enricher that looks and feels like dark, crumbly soil. It is made from recycled organic matter, and has numerous benefcial effects both before and after planting as a soil conditioner and fertilizer. Compost enhances soil structure, texture, and aeration as well as improves moisture regulation. Compost loosens clay soils to improve drainage, and helps sandy soils retain water.  Adding compost to soils aids in erosion control, promotes soil fertility, and stimulates healthy root development in plants. It also provides slow-release nutrients that feed plants on a constant basis, in contrast to many synthetic fertilizers that cause spurts of growth, often increasing the need for pruning, trimming, and mowing.
An innovative product for high traffic turf is "crumb rubber", made by reducing scrap tires into very small pieces which can be combined with composted organic materials. The main benefit from using tires as a soil amendment is the reduction in soil compaction. The incorporation of crumb rubber can promote earlier turf growth, build stronger and healthier root systems, promote drainage, grow turf that will bounce back after continued hard use, and lower maintenance cost.
<P>
<STRONG>Mulch</STRONG>
<P>
Mulch is any material (wood chips, compost, paper, shredded tires, rocks) placed over the soil surface to reduce evaporation and erosion, prevent weed growth, and insulate plants from extreme temperature changes. Mulch can be applied 3-6" deep on top of your soil. Do not bury or dig in the mulch; just keep it on the surface. It is also best to keep mulch a few inches away from the trunks of trees to prevent fungal infections. Mulching provides ideal, moist conditions for healthy micro-organism and macro-organism populations. These two populations will work together to "rototill" the soil and increase the overall health and structure of the soil.
<P>
When purchasing mulches and composts as top dressings 
or soil amendments, consideration should be given to products with the highest recycled content.
<P>
<STRONG>Landscape Edging</STRONG>
<P>
Landscape edging helps to separate one spreading or adventitious plant from another, or simply defines areas within a landscape. The requirements of a given landscape make selection and installation of edging materials relatively important. 
<P>
Small differences in products can result in long-term savings for the property owner and maintenance contractor. Effective containment and durability save maintenance dollars in the future.
<P>
Begin by considering what type of edging material is best to use. Available materials include poly/vinyl, aluminum, steel, wood, and even concrete. By asking your landscape supplier you should be able to find materials that are either 100 percent recycled or have some recycled content. Other materials that can be used as an edging material include old bricks, broken chunks of concrete, rocks dug up during the prepping of a yard, or other materials that fit into your designed landscape.
<P>
<STRONG>Landscape Maintenance</STRONG>
<P>
Waste reduction in the maintenance of turf and landscapes can be accomplished by simply reducing the amount of growth. Proper monitoring and maintenance of irrigation systems can help to keep turf and plant growth to a manageable level. A reduction in growth will translate into less frequent trimming and pruning, and a subsequent reduction in waste. For instance, limiting the amount of water and fertilizer applied to a lawn can allow it to be maintained in a healthy state without producing excess amounts of grass clippings.
<P>
On average, a thousand square feet of California lawn produces over 300 pounds of clipping annually. These clippings can be incorporated directly back into the lawn by "grasscycling". Grasscycling is the natural recycling of grass by leaving clippings on the lawn when mowing. Moderate growth through proper management, or more frequent mowing, will produce short clippings that will not cover the grass surface. Grass clippings decompose quickly and release valuable nutrients back into the soil. Grasscycling is simple, easy, and it works! Most mower manufacturers sell mowers that are capable of grasscycling, or have kits which can convert conventional mowers. If clippings must be collected, they should be composted.
<P>
Trimmings and clippings from lawns, trees and shrubs can be composted, used as a mulch or even burned as biomass fuel to produce electricity. Mulching and composting can be performed on site, or the material can be transported to an appropriate facility. Prunings and clippings can be mulched at the job site using a chipper/shredder and applied around the garden, or can be transported to a local processor.
<P>
Compost can be added to established turf area as well as any planting beds. There are two ways to add compost to lawns  by aerating and applying compost into the holes made by the aerator, or simply by sprinkling a layer on top, called top dressing. In the planting bed areas a top dressing of compost once or twice a year will help to ensure a beautiful garden.  Additional applications throughout the year could benefit the garden and will not damage the plants. You can either leave the compost on the soil surface as a mulch or work it into the soil.
<P>
Although some of the above recommendations may differ from traditional landscape practices, all have been proven to be effective through actual implementation. With yard trimmings alone making up the single largest portion of California's waste stream (15 to 20 percent), any effort to prevent waste through landscaping practices will help communities reach their waste reduction goals.

<P>

<EM>Recycled Paper? Yes!  But that's just a start. Here are other environmental considerations you may want to make when ordering printing.</EM>
<HR>
<P>
<STRONG>Reduce...</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Design to Prevent Waste</STRONG>
<P>
Put more words on a page by using smaller fonts and margins. It is not necessary to begin a chapter on the right side of facing pages. Choose a thin coverstock or eliminate the cover.
<P>
<STRONG>Double-Side Documents</STRONG>
<P>
Be sure to use both sides of the page whenever possible.
<P>
<STRONG>Order Only What You Need</STRONG>
<P>
Volume discounts may make it economical to order more, but can you really use 1000 or 5000? Anticipate corrections and changes (will your business be moving or changing its phone number?).
<P>
<STRONG>Request Vegetable-Based Ink</STRONG>
<P>
Soy and other vegetable-based inks help prevent air and water pollution.They also give brighter colors and rub off less on the reader's hands.
<P>
<STRONG>Request Least-Toxic Colors</STRONG>
<P>
Some ink colors are less friendly than others because their pigments contain toxic heavy metals.  Ask about heavy metals when choosing colored ink.  Avoid metallic and fluorescent inks.
<P>
<STRONG>...and Recycle</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Choose Paper That is Locally Recyclable </STRONG>
<P>
White paper is usually the most recyclable.<BR> 
Avoid fluorescent and goldenrod paper.<BR>  
Avoid plastic covers and bindings.
<P>
<STRONG>Ask for Recycled Paper</STRONG>
<P>
Help complete the recycling loop. Recycled paper may cost a bit more, but you can offset these costs by preventing waste  printing fewer copies and fitting more words on each page. Remember to ask about the recycled content and the postconsumer content of the paper. 50 percent postconsumer means that half of the paper is made of materials that were consumed and recycled. If the postconsumer content of recycled paper is not specified, it is probably made from manufacturing wastes which have not made a complete loop.
<P>
<STRONG>Look for "Tree-Free" Paper</STRONG>
<P>
Alternative fibers such as kenaf, cereal straw, and sugar beet pulp are used to make beautiful paper. Some sources are: Tree Free EcoPaper (800)775-0225, Ecofavini Papers (800)996-0090
<P>
<STRONG>About Vegetable-Based Ink</STRONG>
<P>
Vegetable-based printing ink is made with vegetable oil, such as soybean or corn oil, as a substitute for petroleum.
<P>
Vegetable-based inks significantly reduce the amount of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) released into the air during printing. When the Los Angeles Times switched to soy-based ink, they reduced their VOC emissions by 200 tons per year and won an air quality award from South Coast Air Quality Management District.
<P>
While vegetable oils are a renewable resource, the pigment suspended in those oils is an often toxic ingredient for which there are few substitutes. Certain colors of ink, even vegetable-based ink, contain heavy-metal pigments like cadmium, barium, and copper, which are associated with various health hazards. If you choose colored ink, ask the printer for a color without heavy metals.

<P>
<EM><DL>
<DT>There are many opportunities for reducing waste in building 
maintenance, custodial care, and landscaping. Reducing 
waste can mean saving money on both garbage bills and 
buying supplies. The following are suggestions from professionals in property management and waste reduction. 
</DL>
</EM>
<HR>
<P><STRONG>Building Maintenance</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Service all building equipment as indicated in the warranties.
<LI>Purchase durable, repairable, and energy efficient equipment.  It may cost more up front, but will save money in the long run.
<LI>Keep buildings in good repair; avoid deferred maintenance. Repairs are usually less expensive if handled right away.
<LI>Use durable, recycled, and recyclable materials when 
doing maintenance and repairs.  For a list of businesses which sell recycled content construction products, call (800) 553-2962.
<LI>Obtain and recycle material through the<A HREF="../../calmax/calmax.htm">  California Materials Exchange (CALMAX)</A> or a local material exchange; for more information about this free listing service, call (916) 255-2369.  Materials exchanges help businesses and institutions locate markets for materials they have traditionally discarded and to find materials suitable for reuse.
<LI>Contact local processors who accept construction/renovation debris for recycling.  For a list of processors call (800) 553-2962.
<LI>Donate old furniture, office equipment, outdated forms, 
or paper that is only used on one side.  These materials 
can be used by many nonprofits, schools, or other organizations.  Contact United Way, local homeless shelters, or social service organizations for potential recipients.
<LI>Purchase reusable air filters or air filter frames. Completely reusable air filters require cleaning with hot water (no soap); reusable frames have a disposable filter insert.  Some organizations have found it cost effective to hire a firm that replaces filter inserts on a regular schedule.
<LI>Purchase longer lasting light bulbs. Incandescent light sockets in exit signs can be converted to fluorescent.  Check out availability of rebates from your electric company.
<LI>Use sensors or timers to automatically turn equipment 
on and off.  This can reduce wear on equipment and energy costs.
<LI>Purchase energy-efficient plugs and sockets.
<LI>Maintain building with lead-free paint, and paint on 
as-needed basis.
<LI>Recycle old paint and other related materials appropriately, see the CIWMB fact sheet on <EM>Recycling Latex Paint</EM>.</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Custodial</STRONG>
<P><UL>
<LI>Make recycling available to building tenants.  See the CIWMB brochure on W<EM>aste Reduction For Business & Industry</EM> for more information about how to set up a recycling program.
<LI>Use cloth towel dispensers in bathrooms or purchase recycled and unbleached paper towel rolls.
<LI>If individual rolls of toilet paper are removed before they are completely empty, save them and donate to shelters.
<LI>Ask vendors to sell products that are more durable, reusable, repairable, and recyclable.  Also, ask suppliers not to overpackage orders.
<LI>Request that deliveries be shipped in returnable and reusable containers.  Ask vendors to take back packaging. In some cases they may be able to reuse it.
<LI>Prior to recycling or disposing, find out if packaging materials could be reused by your company or another business.  Cardboard and polystyrene may be used for art projects.
<LI>Purchase products with no packaging, less packaging, or reusable packaging.
<LI>Reduce wood waste by requiring suppliers to collect crates, pallets, barrels, and spools for reuse. These items may also be used internally or can be given to employees to take home.<LI>Purchase cleaning supplies in bulk and concentrate form.  These give you more product for less packaging, and are usually less expensive.
<LI>Use cleaners without toxic, corrosive, and flammable chemicals. Read labels.  Look for products that do not require special handling and/or do not have warnings.
<LI>Dispense cleaning solutions in refillable containers like pump-spray bottles.  Use products in nonaerosol containers where possible.
<LI>Use washable rags.
<LI>Eliminate trash bag liners in waste cans where no wet trash is disposed of.
</UL><P>
<STRONG>Landscaping</STRONG><P>
<UL>
<LI>Compost yard trimmings and use them as a topsoil amendment.
<LI>Chip tree trimmings and use as mulch.
<LI>Plant drought-tolerant plants, they use less water and produce fewer trimmings.
<LI>Avoid overfertilizing and overwatering, which lead to thatch buildup and excess lawn clippings.
<LI>Practice "grasscycling" by leaving grass clippings on the lawn as you mow, and allow them to decompose naturally. See ClWMB's brochure on <EM><A HREF="../wporgnc/wpgras1.htm"> Grasscycling</A>.</EM>
<LI>Practice integrated pest management which encourages biological pest controls and minimum applications of pesticides.
<LI>Return plant containers to vendors.</UL>

<A NAME="top"></A><BR>
<EM>Restaurants, fast food establishments, and cafeterias can do a lot to minimize or reduce potential cost increases by incorporating simple waste prevention and recycling programs and procedures
that will eliminate much of the waste that is thrown away. With
proper purchasing and handling, and careful preparation and storage,
food service establishments can help reduce waste and save money! Your
restaurant may already be using many of these ideas to reduce
costs as well as waste. Try a few new suggestions, see how they
work, and then continue to expand your waste reduction program.
</EM>
<HR>
<P><B>Beverages</B>

<UL>
<LI>Serve beverages from a beverage gun or dispenser, buy bar
mixes in concentrate form, and buy milk in 5-gallon dispenser
boxes.
</UL>

<B>Grocery Items</B>

<UL>
<LI>Use health department-approved, refillable condiment dispensers
instead of individual packets.  Buy shelf-stable food supplies in
bulk when sales volume and storage space allows.
<LI>Consider buying your lettuce pre-cut during those times of
the year when the pre-cut cost is equal to (or less than) the
cost of the bulk product.
<LI>Buy meats in bulk or uncut form and cut to size.
<LI>Consider buying shelled eggs, in bulk, if your egg usage for
general cooking or baking is three or more cases per week.
</UL>

<B>Produce Handling and Storage</B>

<UL>
<LI>Donate unserved food to a local food bank.
<LI>Check your produce deliveries carefully for rotten or damaged
product, and return any substandard product.
<LI>Rotate perishable stock at every delivery to minimize waste
due to spoilage.
<LI>Clean coolers and freezers regularly to ensure that food has
not fallen behind the shelving and spoiled.
<LI>Arrange your refrigerated and dry storage areas to facilitate
easy product access and rotation.  
<LI>Store raw vegetables and other perishables in reusable airtight containers to prevent unnecessary dehydration and spoilage.
<LI>Rehydrate vegetables (e.g., celery, lettuce, carrots, broccoli,
etc.) that have wilted by trimming off the very bottom part of
the stalk and immersing in warm water (100&#176;F.) for 15 to
20 minutes.
</UL>

<B>Food Preparation and  Storage</B>

<UL>
<LI>Adjust inventory levels on perishables to reduce waste due
to spoilage or dehydration.
<LI>Use hourly or daily production charts to minimize over prepping
and unnecessary waste.
<LI>Whenever possible, prepare foods to order.
<LI>When prepping food, only trim off what is not needed.
<LI>Use vegetable and meat trimmings for soup stock.
<LI>Adjust the size of meal portions if you find they are consistently
being returned unfinished.
<LI>Precool hot foods (in an ice bath) before refrigerating.
<LI>Reuse leftover foods that have been stored at proper temperature
within two days of preparation to prevent waste due to spoilage.
<LI>Store leftover hot foods from different stations in separate
containers to reduce the chance of spoilage.
<LI>Wrap freezer products tightly, label, and date them. Make
sure they are used in a timely fashion, to minimize waste due
to freezer burn.
</UL>
<BR>
<A HREF="#top"> <IMG SRC="../wpimage/ret_top.gif">  Go to top of page</A><BR><BR>
<B>Purchasing</B>

<UL>
<LI>Ask your suppliers take back shipping boxes for reuse or recycling
and to keep you informed about new and existing products that
are packaged in ways which can reduce waste.
<LI>Always consider durability as a cost criterion when buying
equipment and janitorial supplies.
</UL>

<B>Paper Supplies</B>

<UL>
<LI>Purchase paper products made from recycled materials.
<LI>Use reusable coasters (or nothing at all) instead of paper
napkins when serving beverages from the bar.
<LI>Store and handle unwrapped paper supplies to prevent the products
from inadvertently falling on the floor.
</UL>

<B>Janitorial and Restaurant Supplies</B>

<UL>
<LI>Use reusable table linen and dinnerware.
<LI>Use cloth towels for cleaning, rather than the paper equivalents.
<LI>Use plastic trash can liners made of recycled HDPE instead
of ones made of LDPE or LLDPE. They contain less raw material,
work equally well for most uses, and generally cost less.
<LI>Purchase cleaning supplies in concentrate form.
<LI>Use multi-purpose cleaners that can be used for all types
of surfaces rather than cleaners that are job specific. Whenever
possible, use cleaning agents that are less hazardous or nonhazardous.
<LI>Use reusable hats for kitchen employees instead of disposable
paper ones.
</UL>

<B>Production and Service Areas</B>

<UL>
<LI>Implement a monthly cleaning and maintenance program for all
your equipment.

dining room trash.
</UL>

<B>Front-of-the-House</B>

<UL>
<LI>Distribute condiments from behind the counter instead of offering
self-service.
<LI>Use straw-style stir sticks for bar beverages instead of the
solid style.
<LI>Serve straws from health department-approved dispensers rather
than pre-wrapped, and offer only one straw per drink.
<LI>Use serving containers in sizes that meet the packaging needs
of your menu items without having excess packaging material.
<LI>Minimize the use of unnecessary extra packaging of take-out
foods.  Use less packaging for eat-in foods than for food being
taken out, or use none at all.
<IMG SRC="../wpimage/coffeem.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<LI>Offer customers a discount if they bring their own mugs, containers,
or bags.
</UL>
<BR>
<A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../wpimage/ret_top.gif"> Go to top of page</A>
<BR><BR>

<B>Recycling Activities</B>

<UL>
<LI>Set up a rendering service for your waste grease, fat, or
used cooking oil.

bin in the dining area for your customers' empty beverage containers.
<LI>Donate empty plastic pails or buckets to schools, nurseries,
churches, customers, or employees.  Donate old uniforms to thrift shops.
</UL>

<B>Ask Your Employees</B>
<P>
Don't forget to ask your staff for their input and assistance
on what can be done to reduce waste. Reward them for good ideas.
Including employees in the decision-making process will help ensure
participation in your efforts to reduce waste, and will result
in higher productivity, better morale, and lower costs.
<P>
<B>Tell Your Customers</B>
<P>
Educate customers and advertise your waste reduction program
by posting signs highlighting your efforts.  Offer customers a discount if they bring their own mugs, ocntainers, or bags.
<P>
<EM>Eat Your Vegetables, Sacramento, CA, donates 250 pounds of
unserved food every week to local food banks. To date they have
donated approximately 60,000 pounds of food! They return plastic
berry baskets to the produce dealer for reuse and have arranged
for their produce supplier to pick up cardboard boxes, which are
repacked with produce. Office paper printed on one side only is
saved and made into note pads by their printer. Eat Your Vegetables
is participating in a pilot composting program operated by the
County of Sacramento and has reduced the volume of garbage that
is landfilled by 90%.</EM>

<H2> <B><CENTER>Waste Reduction at Retail Stores</CENTER></B></H2>
<IMG SRC="../wpimage/wrap1.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="top"></A>
<P>
<EM>Retail stores generate large amounts of highly recyclable materials,
such as office paper and corrugated cardboard. They also throw
away plastics, such as plastic films (shrink wraps and bags) and
polystyrene packing &quot;peanuts&quot;, newspaper, and beverage
containers. You can educate customers and employees about waste
reduction by promoting waste prevention through advertising campaigns
and putting out recycling containers. And retailers can save money
by observing the three Rs: reduce, reuse, recycle.</EM>
<BR><HR><BR>
<B>Reduce</B>
<P>
The largest component of waste at retail stores is packaging.
Work with your vendors and suppliers and ask them to provide items
without excess packaging. Retailers have a tremendous opportunity
to save money and reduce waste by following these packaging guidelines:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Give your customers the choice of whether or not they want
their purchase bagged, or offer a discount to customers who bring
their own bag.   Ask your suppliers to eliminate packaging altogether, if possible.
<P>
<LI>Minimize the amount of packaging used.
<P>
<LI>Ask suppliers to provide packaging materials that are either
refillable or reusable. For example, retail stores can reuse certain
packaging materials such as cardboard and polystyrene packing
&quot;peanuts&quot;.
<P>
<LI>Recyclable/Recycled Content. Use packaging that is recyclable
and is made with recycled materials. To the greatest extent possible,
recycled content should be composed of postconsumer recycled
waste material, that is, material which has served its intended
end use and has been discarded by a business or consumer.
</OL>

<P>
<B>Reuse</B>
<P>
Donate old and outdated merchandise to charities rather than throwing
it in the trash. Store remodeling produces construction and demolition
debris in large amounts from time to time. Many of these materials
can be reused by other stores, schools, churches, or community
organizations. They can be reused or recycled by advertising in
a materials exchange, such as CalMAX, the <A HREF="../../calmax/calmax.htm"> California Materials
Exchange</A>. Materials exchanges help businesses and institutions
find markets for materials they have traditionally discarded.
For more information about this free listing service, call CalMAX
at (916) 255-2369.
<P>
<B>Recycle</B>
<P>
Retail stores can reduce disposal costs and sometimes even earn
revenue from the sale of separated recyclables. Estimate the amount
of recyclable materials your store produces and arrange to have
it picked up by your waste hauler or recycler. Services may include
providing recycling containers, promoting your program, and educating
your employees.
<P>
Ask these questions when looking for a vendor to pick up your
recyclables: 
<UL>
<LI>What materials does the vendor accept for recycling?
<LI>How should the materials be separated? 
<LI>Is there a minimum amount required for a pick up? 
<LI>Do they charge for pickup? 
<LI>Will the vendor pay for the recyclables? 
<LI>Will the vendor supply recycling containers to use throughout the workplace and large bins for the main storage area? 
<LI>How will pickups be arranged? Scheduled?  On-call? 
<LI>Does the vendor offer shredding services for confidential materials? 
<LI>Does the vendor have references?
</UL>



<P>
Choose appropriate recycling containers. The size and style of
recycling equipment varies. Many vendors will supply a variety
of small-size containers for business recycling programs and nearly
all provide and service the larger storage dumpsters. You may
wish to purchase your own personalized recycling bins with your
company's logo or convert an existing trash container into a recycling
container. Many recycling containers are made of recycled materials,
so purchase and use them whenever possible.
<P>
Locate recycling bins strategically and label them clearly. Place
recycling bins in all heavy traffic areas, common work areas,
and most importantly, in locations where recyclables are typically
generated.
<P>

<B>Buy Recycled Products</B>
<P>
By purchasing and using products made with recycled materials,
you are &quot;closing the recycling loop.&quot; In addition to
packaging materials with recycled content, there are many other
recycled products available, such as: office paper products; tissue
paper products; plastic landscaping &quot;timbers&quot; and ceiling,
wall, and floor tiles. Ask your suppliers and contractors to make
these products available to you.
<P>
<B>At Malls</B>
<P>
Mall property managers and anchor stores can provide leadership
by coordinating waste prevention, recycling, and purchasing programs
at multi-tenant complexes. Mall managers can consolidate efforts
among businesses to generate large amounts of recyclable material
thereby making recycling more cost effective.

<B>Success Stories</B>
<P>
<EM>Sears, Roebuck and Co. is a leader in procurement of reduced and
recycled packaging. Sears asked suppliers to identify ways to
reduce the amount of waste, by eliminating packaging where possible,
and by increasing the use of recycled content. Suppliers agreed
to reduce the volume of packaging by 25 percent by 1995. Sears estimates
the program will reduce packaging by 1.5 million tons by the end
of 1994 and save about $5 million annually!
<P>
Raley's Superstores bags groceries in plastic bags made from 30 percent
recycled milk jugs. Raley's offers customers a 5-cent credit for
reusing their large printed grocery bags, which has resulted in
millions of bags being reused!
<P>
Herman Miller, Inc. has saved over $1 million annually, in part,
with reusable or cartonless furniture packaging. The company also
holds workshops to educate employees about waste prevention.

<B><H2>Don't Throw Your Profits Out With the Trash, Second Edition</H2></B>
<A NAME="top"></A>
<P><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<STRONG>The Bottom Line</STRONG>
<BR>When you get right down to it, making a profit is the driving force behind almost all businesses. Successful businesses maximize their income and minimize expenses. Why then, are so many potential profits going out with the trash?
<P>
Of the approximately 45 million tons of garbage produced in California each year, more than half originates from the commercial and industrial sectors. By practicing waste prevention, reusing products, recycling whenever possible, and making environmentally conscious purchases, your business can cut costs and increase profits.
<P>
Here are just a few examples of northern and central California businesses that have positively impacted their bottom line and were 1994 winners and participants of the Waste Reduction Awards Program (WRAP).
<HR>
<P>
<STRONG>Ben Franklin Press, Napa, CA </STRONG>
<BR>
Ben Franklin Press is a high-quality commercial print shop in the Napa Valley, doing award-winning printing for the wine and food industry. Ben Franklin Press distributes leftover paper and paper scrap to many schools in the area. The shop recycles all cardboard and all uncoated paper it receives and uses recycled stock for printing on a daily basis.  This waste reduction and recycling program enables Ben Franklin to save approximately $500 per month, while also benefiting its clients and local schoolchildren. 
<P>
<STRONG>Broderbund Software, Novato, CA</STRONG>
<BR>
Broderbund Software, Inc., a diversified consumer software company with a broad selection of products for homes, schools, and small businesses, has implemented a comprehensive

<P>
<STRONG>Doubletree Hotel, San Francisco, CA</STRONG><BR>
The Doubletree Hotel at the San Francisco Airport offers 291 guest rooms, a restaurant, lounge and banquet/meeting facilities for individuals and groups. Since February 1992, the hotel's 160 employees have been participating in a recycling program.

<B><H2>Don't Throw Your Profits Out With the Trash, Fourth Edition</H2></B>
<A NAME="top"></A>
<P><BR><BR><BR>
<STRONG>The Bottom Line</STRONG><BR>
When you get right down to it, making a profit is the driving force behind almost all businesses. Successful businesses maximize their income and minimize expenses. Why then, are so many potential profits going out with the trash?
<P>
Of the approximately 45 million tons of garbage produced in California each year, more than half originates from the commercial and industrial sectors. By practicing waste prevention, reusing products, recycling whenever possible, and making environmentally conscious purchases, your business can cut costs and increase profits.
<P>
Here are just a few examples of southern California businesses that have positively impacted their bottom line and were 1994 winners and participants of the Waste Reduction Awards Program (WRAP).
<HR>
<P>
<STRONG>AMI South Bay Hospital, Redondo Beach, CA</STRONG><BR>
AMI South Bay Hospital, a full-service, 208-bed health care facility in Redondo Beach, has embarked upon an aggressive waste management program aimed at packaging waste and recycling. Disposal tonnage has been cut by 50 percent, with cost savings of $100,000 since program inception.  The hospital actively seeks vendors who provide items with postconsumer recycled content.
<P>
<STRONG>Baxter Diagnostics Inc - Paramax Chemistry, Irvine, CA</STRONG><BR>
Paramax Chemistry manufacturers the Paramax, a blood chemistry analyzer used in hospitals. Through its waste reduction and recycling efforts, the facility has reduced landfill waste by 77 percent since 1989. Paramax's Cuvette Reuse Project allows customers to return empty spools and cardboard boxes free of shipping charges. This project is estimated to reduce 203,760 pounds of cardboard and 180,000 pounds of plastic waste annually.
<P>
<STRONG>Bazaar del Mundo, Inc., San Diego, CA</STRONG><BR>
Located in the Old Town San Diego State Historic Park, the Bazaar instituted an extensive recycling program in 1990 and recycles cardboard, glass, plastic, steel cans, and grease. By diverting approximately 200 tons of material a year from the landfill, the Bazaar del Mundo has realized a savings to date of $10,700.
<P>
<STRONG>Beckman Instruments, Inc., Brea, CA</STRONG><BR>
Beckman Instruments, Inc. provides quality products and services, from academic bioresearch to applications in the bioindustrial and diagnostic laboratory. The facility involves all 1200 employees in recycling white paper, cardboard, computer paper, plastics, and aluminum cans. In addition, Beckman has a program that allows customers to return polystyrene shipping containers (at Beckman's expense) for reuse. Since the inception of their program in May of 1993, Beckman has diverted over 275 tons of waste from local landfills, and has earned over $35,000 from both sales of recyclable items and reduced landfill costs.
<P>
<STRONG>Doubletree Hotel - Orange County, Orange, CA</STRONG><BR>
The Doubletree Hotel, Orange County, is a 450-room, first-class, full-service, corporate hotel located near Disneyland. Unclaimed guest items and used employee uniforms are donated to charities. The hotel also offers green suites: environmentally friendly guest rooms with recycled products and filtered air and water. In 1994 they recycled 73,000 pounds of materials and saved $12,000.
<P>
<STRONG>East Shore RV Park, San Dimas, CA </STRONG><BR>
East Shore R.V. Park rents sites to recreational vehicles on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, supplying renters with full hookups, telephone, cable TV, grass, trees, and other convenient amenities, and lake access for fishing. In an effort to reduce their weekly trash pickups, they have started a program of mulching their grass cuttings three times a month back onto their 37 acres of lawns and, once a month, picking the clippings up and composting them on site. They mix the composted grass clippings with chips from tree trimmings and spread it in planter beds for weed control, thereby reducing their use of chemical weed control. East Shore's efforts to reduce weekly trash pickups have resulted in a savings of at least $7,000, or 46 fewer trash hauls a year. 
<P>
<STRONG>Kaiser Permanente - 
Sherman Way Regional Laboratories, North Hollywood, CA</STRONG><BR>
Kaiser Permanente Sherman Way Regional Reference Laboratories donates used computers, microscopes, and medical equipment to public schools and less developed countries. Listings with the California Materials Exchange and Los Angeles Sanitation District Recycling Directory have helped maximize waste reduction by offering used cardboard, paper, and glass to other companies that can use them.  Also, by reusing plastic containers and sterilized test tubes, the company is saving $62,000 annually.
<P>
<STRONG>Lakewood Regional Medical Center, Lakewood, CA </STRONG><BR>
Lakewood Regional Medical Center recycles paper and cardboard and has cut compactor waste hauling in half, saving approximately $24,000 per year.
<P>
<STRONG>Nissan Motor Corporation, Gardena, CA</STRONG><BR> 
Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A. has reduced the use of paper and diskettes by placing their environmental and safety manual on the local area network computer system. Nissan's memohead and business cards are made from recycled paper. Nissan's Master Parts Distribution Center in Compton has saved over $80,000 in packaging costs by reuse and recycling.
<P>
<STRONG>Norton's Palm Dry Cleaners Inc., Placentia, CA</STRONG><BR> 
Norton's Palm Dry Cleaners, Inc. is promoting the use of a reusable garment bag to reduce packing material waste. At present, it is estimated this service reduces material use about 25 percent, resulting in a cost saving for plastic bags of 25 percent, or about $4,000 annually.
<P>
<STRONG>Plaza Camino Real, Carlsbad, CA </STRONG><BR>
Plaza Camino Real is a super regional shopping center located in North San Diego County within the cities of Oceanside and Carlsbad. The center recycles all mixed paper, cardboard, glass & plastic bottles, aluminum and metal cans, green wastes, and construction debris. A special program during eight months of the year diverts food wastes from their restaurants to feedlots in the Riverside County area. The 145 retail stores and restaurants and the five major department stores at Plaza Camino Real have cut 51 percent from their waste stream, thus saving over $25,000 in hauling and dumping fees in 1994 alone.
<P>
<STRONG>Ricoh Electronics, Inc., Tustin, CA</STRONG><BR>
Ricoh Electronics, Inc. manufactures copier machines and related supplies such as toner, developer, parts, and thermal paper products. By separating corrugated paper boxes and recycling them, the company reduced trash hauling fees by $800 per month. All areas of the company have collection boxes for white and nonwhite paper which is collected for recycling. This recycling program earns the company $300 to $600 per month.
<P>
<STRONG>Sea World of California, San Diego, CA</STRONG><BR>
Sea World's recycling efforts have resulted in the diversion of 881,252 pounds of trash from local landfills. The "clean green" waste and cardboard recycling programs results in nearly 320,200 pounds of clean green waste and 438,760 pounds of cardboard recycled annually. In 1993, Sea World of California's recycling program yielded a savings of $19,284.
<P>
<STRONG>Toyota Technical Center, USA, Inc., Torrance, CA </STRONG><BR>
Toyota Technical Center, USA, Inc., (TTC) is an automotive research and development company, with locations in Michigan, California, and Arizona.  Each location has a dedicated recycling program.  In California, TTC has reduced the number of trash pickups, resulting in a 76 percent savings in the company's waste removal budget between 1993 and 1994. Also, money saved at TTC in California due to purchasing fewer supplies has resulted in a 15 percent reduction in costs.

<B><H2>Creating a Paper Reduction Campaign</H2></B>
<A NAME="top"></A>
<P>

<EM>Offices use a lot of paper, nearly 1.5 pounds per person per day, according to a study done by the City of Los Angeles, so they are a prime target for waste reduction.
A paper reduction campaign is a focused effort to promote paper reduction by: using less paper; reusing paper where appropriate; and recycling. To make a campaign successful, management and staff participation and support are essential.
<P>The following steps and ideas can help you start a paper reduction campaign in your office.     </EM>

<HR>
<STRONG>Getting Started</STRONG>
<P>
Form a committee to plan and carry out the paper reduction campaign; include representatives from management and all levels of staff. The committee should then do the following:
<UL>
<LI>Identify quantities of different types of paper in the waste stream. Typical types of paper include: white office paper, envelopes, colored paper, newspaper, boxboard, cardboard. See the waste evaluation worksheets in the CIWMB publication, <EM>"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle It's Good Business A Guide for California Business."</EM>
<LI>Decide your priorities; consider: 
<BR>- how much of the particular paper type contributes 
to your office's waste stream;
<BR>- how you might be able to support existing waste 
reduction efforts;
<BR>- ease of implementing new waste reduction practices.
<LI>Develop measurable goals, strategies (see below for 
strategy suggestions), and a timeline for implementation.
<LI>Obtain organizational approval and support for the plan.
<LI>Have your organization adopt a formal waste reduction policy which supports the paper reduction campaign.
<LI>Design logos and develop slogans for use in the campaign.
<LI>Have a formal kick-off event. Explain the campaign to all staff; announce formal goals.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Making it Work</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>Implement the campaign in phases so that people aren't overwhelmed with changes. New ideas can be pilot tested in a few areas to obtain feedback before expanding office wide.
<LI>Use volunteer section or division "leaders" who will help implement projects and take responsibility for encouraging employees in their area to practice waste reduction.
<LI>Acknowledge and respond to people's concerns. Some ideas for reducing waste may work better than others and every office will be different.
<LI>Be patient: new behaviors are often required to reduce waste and there may be some frustration on the part of staff or management who need to be persuaded to change the way they do things.
<LI>Be flexible, persistent and willing to try new ideas.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Keeping People Motivated</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>Many people will have good ideas about how to reduce paper usage; ask for and encourage those ideas.
<LI>Make the campaign fun by holding contests, posting 
interesting visual displays, and putting out entertaining reminders and announcements. They can be sent out through electronic mail, voice mail, routed in the office 
or posted in conspicuous locations.
<LI>Have employees sign a pledge to reduce paper.
<LI>Give awards for reducing paper use, good ideas, and general waste reduction efforts.
<LI>Publicize successes, let people know when goals are met.
<LI>Be sure that new employees are informed about in-house waste reduction policies, practices and projects.  Give them a new employee kit which contains a desktop paper collection box, information about the waste reduction program, etc.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Strategies for Encouraging Reduced Paper Use</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>Promote a "think before you copy" attitude. Workers should be encouraged to make sure they really need the copies they are making and not to make excess copies.
<LI>Adopt an organizational policy that all individual documents will be two sided (this does not mean combining documents in order to use both sides, for documents with odd-numbered pages, this will mean that the last page is blank.)
<LI>Keep copiers and printers in good repair and make it policy to only buy copiers and printers which will do two-sided copying reliably.
<LI>Let people know that two-sided copying not only saves paper, it saves postage (from reduced mail volume) and storage space.
<LI>Remind people to double-sided copy by posting reminders near the copiers, using interesting posters or entertaining slogans ("2 sides are better than one", "make a 2 (copies) for I (page) offer", "get a second impression", etc.) and changing them often to maintain interest.
<LI>Set up computer software for default 2-sided printing including word processing, spreadsheets, electronic mail and others.
<LI>Promote getting the most out of paper by using both sides:
<BR>- Encourage people to save and reuse single-sided paper 
at their desks.
<BR>- Collect paper that has been used on one side for reuse 
in copiers, printers, fax machines and to be made into scratch pads.
<LI>Encourage reuse of envelopes, etc. Your office can buy recyclable labels with the office address and logo to place over addresses on envelopes being reused.
<LI>Encourage people to reuse items such as file folders at their desk; excess reusable items can be centrally collected.
<LI>Reduce and double-side standard forms. In its effort 
to reduce paper, Bank of America saved significant amounts of paper by reducing and consolidating various standard forms.
<LI>Use e-mail for forms and document transmittals. As part of their paper reduction campaign, AT&T switched its vendor billing, employee newsletter and other documents to electronic mail saving millions of sheets of paper annually.
<LI>Check the CIWMB fact sheet on <EM><A HREF="fsoffice.htm"> Waste Reduction Ideas for Offices</A></EM> for more ways to reduce paper usage.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Encouraging Recycling</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>Set up an office recycling program. See the CIWMB brochure, <EM>Waste Reduction for Business & Industry</EM> for information about getting your recyclables collected.
<LI>Choose appropriate recycling containers. The size and style of recycling equipment varies. Many vendors will supply a variety of small-size containers for business recycling programs and nearly all provide and service the larger storage dumpsters. You may wish to purchase your own personalized recycling bins with your organization's logo or convert an existing trash container into a recycling container. Many recycling containers are made of recycled materials, so purchase and use them whenever possible.
<LI>Locate recycling bins strategically and label them clearly. Place recycling bins in all heavy traffic areas, common work areas, and most importantly, in locations where recyclables are typically generated.
<LI>Monitor recycling containers for contaminants on a regular basis. Also check trash cans for items that should be recycled. Focus reminders, contests etc. on any problem areas.
<LI>Make it organizational policy to purchase and use products made with recycled materials. This "closes the recycling loop" by making sure there are end-products and markets for recycled materials. Examples of paper products with recycled content are bond paper, computer paper, kraft envelopes, file folders, tissue paper products, etc.
<LI>Ask your suppliers and contractors to make these recycled content products available to you.
<LI>Use savings from waste prevention efforts to offset the costs of buying recycled products in those instances where they cost more.

<TITLE>MOTIVATING EMPLOYEES TO CHANGE OLD HABITS</TITLE>

<B><H2>Motivating Employees to Change Old Habits</H2></B>
<A NAME="top"></A>
<P>

<EM>Waste reduction hinges on the participation and support of employees, managers, and customers. It involves rethinking the way we do things and changing old habits. This is not easy, but rewards abound as resources and money are saved. Below is advice from experts who have first-hand experience motivating people.</EM>

<HR>
Changing old habits and forming new ones is an ongoing process that begins with exposure to, and assimilation of pertinent information.  An individual uses information to create a perception 
of the relative costs and benefits of adopting a new behavior. 
If a new practice isn't reinforced by an ongoing perception that benefits outweigh costs, the change will likely be temporary.
<P>
It takes, time, patience, and persistence. Here are some ideas that have been used in other businesses to educate and motivate employees to reduce waste.
<P>
<STRONG>Creative Images</STRONG>
<P>
In our information age where we are bombarded with all kinds of information, it is important to make your message stand out. 
The right visual impressions can actually be stronger than words.
<UL>
<LI>Use a catchy logo and slogan for your program.
<LI>Create pictures and graphics to jazz up written materials, recycling containers, and coffee mugs.
<LI>Show people how much waste they generate using photos, videos, or displays.
<LI>Present a short video to employees.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Motivating Messages</STRONG>
<P>
Facts should be put in terms people can relate to and the message should be easy to understand.  A startling fact can help motivate a person to seek change.
<UL>
<LI>Explain why it is important to stop wasting resources.  
<LU>Where possible, present benefits in terms of cost savings, resources saved, customer satisfaction, corporate and personal responsibility towards future generations.
<LI>Present information so it stands out; 
avoid being redundant or boring.
<LI>Use startling facts.
<LI>Personalize information and relate it to what a person already knows.
<LI>Don't assume employees and managers are very familiar with key waste reduction words or concepts.
<LI>Avoid giving too much information at once; 
give information in manageable pieces.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Person-to-Person Communication</STRONG>
<P>
In addition to distributing or posting written educational materials, where feasible, present information person-to-person. It is more influential than written materials alone.
<UL>
<LI>Seek volunteers in each work area who are willing to 
be trained as "waste reduction pros." The pros provide 
a friendly and knowledgeable source of information throughout the organization.  And they can provide feedback on how you are doing.
<LI>Train new employees. Let them know they are expected 
to use resources carefully and fully participate in waste reduction programs. Explain how to prevent waste and recycle materials.
<LI>Use all-employee gatherings to promote waste 
reduction. Show what is being done well and what 
areas need improvement.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Incentives</STRONG>
<P>
There are lots of great ways to motivate employees. 
Here are just a few:
<UL>
<LI>Graph progress and show people how they are doing 
by division, floor or other unit.
<LI>Create a contest and award prizes or trophies 
(reused, of course).
<LI>Financially reward employees for ideas that generate significant cost savings and waste reduction.
<LI>Offer discounts to employees who purchase coffee using their own washable mug.
<LI>Recognize employee's waste reduction efforts in front 
of others.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Involve Employees</STRONG>
<P>
Employees best know how operations work and are critical 
to the success of any program.
<UL>
<LI>Solicit ideas from employees involve them so they 
have ownership in the program.
<LI>Let employees be part of the decision-making process; invite employees to participate in a waste reduction team that is responsible for implementing waste reduction practices.
<LI>Ask employees to make a waste reduction pledge.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Set a Good Example</STRONG>
<P>
To help make new practices mainstream be sure to practice what you preach.
<UL>
<LI>If using promotional give-aways or prizes, make sure they exemplify waste reduction (e.g., a coffee mug with your program's slogan, a refillable pen made from recycled plastic). Don't give away premiums or materials that will end up in the trash.
<LI>Distribute information in the least wasteful way. 
Send messages electronically, if that option is available. Route messages or post them on a central bulletin board. Print or copy using both sides of the page and format documents so there isn't excessive white space.
<LI>Ask employees to bring their own plate or mug to gatherings where food and beverages will be served.

<STRONG>Show Your Commitment to Using Resources Wisely</STRONG> by stating in bid packets that your organization expects suppliers to participate in waste prevention and recycling.
Ask vendors to identify products that promote waste prevention
and recycling.
<P>
<STRONG>Policies That Encourage Waste Prevention:</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>Perform life cycle cost analysis which include an assessment of a product's
maintenance, energy and water use, and disposal costs.
<LI>Allow a price preference for durable, reusable, repairable, and recycled
products. A price preference is a way to recognize that some virgin
materials receive tax breaks and other subsidies which drive down
the prices of products. Consider using cost savings from waste
reduction activities to pay for more expensive, but less wasteful
products. 
<LI>An alternative to price preferences is to use &quot;set-asides&quot;
that require a certain portion of purchases for a given commodity
be satisfied with products meeting waste reduction standards.
<LI>Consider centralized purchasing through one department or person.
It makes it easier to apply waste reduction purchasing policies.
<LI>Make each department accountable for the supplies they use. 
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Below are a few ways to reduce waste through purchasing. Think about what will work for
your organization and brainstorm new ideas: </STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>Re-evaluate items purchased. Are they really necessary? (e.g., some cafeterias have
stopped purchasing straws).
<LI>Purchase refillable or reusable products (e.g., refillable pens and pencils, cloth towels and rags, mugs,
flatware, dishes, air filters).
<LI>Conduct a prepurchase review to consider alternatives to disposable and single-use products.
<LI>Purchase the lightest, smallest durable product that will complete the task. Bigger is not necessarily better.
<LI>Practice &quot;just-in-time supply&quot; to avoid over purchasing and spoilage.
<LI>Purchase products that don't need batteries or use solar energy (e.g., manual pencil
sharpeners, solar powered calculators). 
<LI>Select nontoxic products.  Read labels. Look for products that do not require special handling,
ventilation or have warnings. 
<LI>Choose concentrated cleaning solutions in bulk form. These give you more product for less packaging.
Dispense liquid solutions in pump spray bottles rather than aerosol
containers.
<LI>Purchase products without packaging, with less packaging, or reusable packaging. Ask suppliers not to overpackage orders.  (You may have to keep asking over and over!)
<LI>Ask vendors to take back packaging. In some cases they may be able to reuse it. Alternatively,
save and reuse packaging materials. Offer excess packaging materials to firms that can use them. 
<LI>Purchase copiers and printers that make two-sided copies reliably. Maintain machines on a regular
basis to reduce jams. 
<LI>Research alternative technologies that can prevent waste (e.g., modem cards, digital duplicators, folder/sealers).
<LI>Purchase rebuilt or refilled toner cartridges. These generally are much cheaper than new ones. Check your warranty and contact several vendors because quality varies. 
<LI>Negotiate longer, more comprehensive warranties and service contracts for equipment.  Maintain equipment to maximize its life.
<LI>Educate employees about waste prevention through purchasing. Purchasing agents base orders
on employee requests. Employees need to know what to ask for.
<LI>Try to repair, refurbish, or rebuild before buying new (e.g., furniture).  Purchase quality used or remanufactured products instead of new ones. 
<LI>Contact the California Materials Exchange (CALMAX) to advertise or find low cost or free used materials. Categories cover construction, containers, durables (e.g., furniture, office supplies), electronic,
glass, metal, organic, paint/wax, pallets, paper, plastic, rubber, textile, wood, and miscellaneous. Call 800-553-2962 for more information.

<B><H2>Use Less Packaging and Reduce Waste!</H2></B>
<A NAME="top"></A>
<P>
<EM>Every year Californians produce 45 million tons of garbage, and
approximately one third is packaging. New state-of-the-art landfills
are harder and harder to site. Because of the costs and environmental
problems associated with the disposal of solid waste, there is
growing concern and interest in reducing the amount of waste generated
while increasing the amount of waste that is recycled and reused.</EM>
<BR><HR><BR>
<P>
Packaging is one area where significant waste reduction can be
accomplished. Packaging manufacturers, retailers, and consumers
have a tremendous opportunity to make a valuable contribution
to the overall resolution of these problems. And while there are
certainly no absolute formulas or prescriptions for the packaging
industry, it is also clear that the traditional view of package
design, use, and disposal practices must change.
<P>
Working hand in hand, retailers, packagers, and consumers should
voluntarily choose to aggressively pursue all possible waste reduction
strategies, including waste prevention, reuse, and recycling.
<P>
<EM>Herman Miller, Inc. has saved over $1 million annually, in
part, with reusable or cartonless furniture packaging. The company
also holds workshops to educate employees about waste prevention.
</EM>
<P>
<B>Principles for Packaging Reduction</B>
<P>
These are the principles that leading packaging firms have found
successful in achieving substantial cost savings and effective
waste reduction. Implement them in order of priority, if possible.
There may be conflicts between competing goals, such as package
minimization and use of recycled content. In general, if you cannot
do both, select the option that results in the least amount of
waste going to landfills.
<P>
<B>Eliminate</B>
<P>
The basic principle of waste prevention is that by preventing
waste material from being produced in the first place, there will
be less waste to manage. If possible, eliminate the package altogether,
provided product integrity will not be jeopardized.
<P>
<B>Reduce</B>
<P>
Reduce the amount of packaging used. For those products that must
be packaged, consider methods of reducing the amount of material
used in the packaging. Minimal packaging can be accomplished through:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Product design changes (e.g., concentrates, different product structures);
<LI>Modifications to package design (e.g., structure of the package);
<LI>New or different types of packaging;
<LI>Single material packaging (e.g., one package component); and
<LI>Development and use of consumable packages where appropriate.
(Consumable packages are those which are eliminated in the process
of using the product so that no packaging remains; an example
would be the use of water soluble packets for a product that is
to be mixed with water.)
</UL>
<P>
<B>Reuse</B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Design packages that are refillable or reusable.
<LI>Refillable packages may be refilled by either the consumer, retailer,
or product producer from bulk or larger containers. To be considered
refillable, packaging must be refilled or reused for its original
purpose, rather than reused for a secondary purpose such as storing
refrigerator leftovers or other limited applications.
<LI>Maximize the use of reusable packaging, including reusable transport
packaging.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Recyclable Packaging and Recycled Content</B>
<P>
Packaging should be designed to be compatible with available recycling
systems. Labels, seals, tapes, closures, and so on, should also
be compatible with commonrecycled material processing systems.
<P>
A material should be considered recyclable only if there is an
economically viable and widely available system for collecting,
processing, and marketing the material.
<P>
Use the maximum feasible amount of postconsumer, recycled material
in the packaging.
<P>
A package that is designed to be both recycled and composed of
recycled material is most preferable. However, regulatory restrictions
(such as Rule 41 of the Uniform Freight Classification or Food
and Drug Administration regulations) or structural considerations
may limit the use of recycled content.
<P>
To the greatest extent possible, recycled content should be composed
of post-consumer, recycled, waste material, that is, material
which has served its intended end use and has been discarded by
a business or consumer.
<P>
<B>Packaging Analysis Checklist</B>
<P>
Without compromising health, safety, or product-integrity standards
or violating statutory or regulatory requirements, can the preferred
packaging procurement practices be implemented?  Following is a
checklist for retailers or manufacturers to use with their vendors
on all packaging: unit packaging, secondary packaging,
and tertiary packaging (shipping containers).
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Are there toxic materials in the packaging?
<LI>Can the toxic materials be eliminated?
<LI>Can non-toxic materials be substituted?
<LI>Can the package be eliminated?
<LI>Can the packaging be reduced through product design changes,
package design changes, elimination of secondary package or wrapping
material, decreasing size of packaging-to-product ratio, or other
volume reduction?
<LI>Can the package be made returnable for reuse and redistribution?
<LI>Can the package be made to be refilled by a customer or consumer
either from bulk or larger containers?
<LI>Is the package recyclable?
<LI>Can the package be made easier to recycle, by redesigning it
to be composed predominantly of a single material?
<LI>If the packaging is made of more than one material, can the
different materials be easily separated?
<LI>Does the packaging contain inks, dyes, or tints which can be
removed to enhance recyclability?
<LI>Does the package contain the maximum feasible amount of postconsumer
material?
<LI>Do you currently receive more than one type of flexible film
(stretch wrap)?
<LI>To make in-store recycling easier, have you considered selecting
one plastic material and asking your vendors to ship using only
that material?

<EM>Many people are confused by solid waste terms, especially terms like "waste reduction," that have evolved recently. Below are working definitions that aim to alleviate confusion and help us all communicate clearly with each other.</EM>
<HR>
<P><STRONG>Closing the Loop:</STRONG> Refers to buying products that contain recycled content, including materials containing postconsumer content.
<P><STRONG>Composting: </STRONG>The biological decomposition of organic materials such as leaves, grass clippings, brush, and food waste into a soil amendment.
<P><STRONG>Grasscycling: </STRONG>The practice of leaving grass clippings on the lawn while mowing, which allows the nutrients to return into the soil.
<P><STRONG>Postconsumer Content:</STRONG> The portion of a product's content that is made from material (e.g., paper, plastic) that was consumed and recycled by a business or residence.  This contrasts with recycled content that consists of scrap produced in the manufacturing process.
<P><STRONG>Precycling:</STRONG> Making purchasing decisions that will reduce waste, such as buying goods with less packaging (e.g., goods in bulk or concentrated form), choosing products that will last longer, and avoiding single-use or disposable products. Buying recycled is also included in precycling campaigns.
<P><STRONG>Pollution Prevention: </STRONG>Avoiding the production of all forms of pollution, including toxics and other pollutants emitted into air, water, and land, as a preferable alternative to cleaning up pollution that has already occurred.
<P><STRONG>Recycling: </STRONG>The process of collecting, sorting, cleansing, treating, and reconstituting materials that would otherwise become solid waste, and returning them to the economic mainstream in the form of raw material for new or reconstituted products which meet the quality standards necessary to be used in the marketplace.
<P><STRONG>Reuse:</STRONG> To use something over again in it's current form, i.e., without breaking it down into a raw material.
<P><STRONG>Source Reduction: </STRONG>See Waste Prevention.
<P><STRONG>Waste Diversion: </STRONG>The combined efforts of waste prevention, reuse, recycling and composting practices.
<P><STRONG>Waste Minimization:</STRONG> Refers to eliminating, reducing and recycling of hazardous waste.
<P><STRONG>Waste Prevention: </STRONG>Any action undertaken by an individual or organization to eliminate or reduce the amount or toxicity of materials before they enter the municipal solid waste stream.  This action is intended to conserve resources, promote efficiency, and reduce pollution.  The CIWMB uses this term instead of source reduction since we have found it is easier for the public to understand.
<P><STRONG>Waste Reduction:</STRONG> The combined efforts of waste prevention, reuse, composting, and recycling practices. (Note: some organizations use this term synonymously with waste prevention, while others do not).
<P><STRONG>Worm Composting:</STRONG> The process whereby worms feed on slowly decomposing materials (e.g., vegetable scraps) in a controlled environment to produce a nutrient-rich soil amendment.
<P><STRONG>Vermicomposting:</STRONG> See worm composting.
<P><STRONG>Xeriscaping:</STRONG> The practice of landscaping with slowgrowing, drought-tolerant plants.

<B><H2>Materials Exchange</H2></B>
<A NAME="top"></A>
<P>
<STRONG><EM>The Trash of One Business is the Treasure of Another</EM></STRONG><P>
<P><HR>
<STRONG>Definition.</STRONG> A materials exchange is a program for trading materials between companies or organizations, generated at the work place which traditionally have been discarded. The primary tools of these programs consist of 
a periodic catalog and/or electronic access by modem to a 
data base containing such information. Materials or waste exchange programs serve business, industry, and institutions, including schools and nonprofit organizations.
<P><STRONG>History.</STRONG> Materials exchange originated in Great Britain 
in 1942 to conserve materials for the war effort. The first North American exchange was started in Canada in 1974 for hazardous waste, where most programs on this continent 
were originally focused. In this arena, the safe and confidential transfer of still usable chemicals and other commodities made materials exchange practical and money-saving. The toxic 
status of the items involved made their disposal and handling high-risk and very costly.
<P><STRONG>Materials Exchange in California.</STRONG> It has only been in recent years that the concept of materials exchange has been applied to nonhazardous waste management. 
The <A HREF="../../calmax/calmax.htm"> California Materials Exchange (CALMAX)</A>, is the first program known to have applied the materials exchange concept to nonhazardous waste exclusively. Established in 1991, CALMAX published its first bimonthly catalog in February 1992.  A free program of the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB), CALMAX solely handles nonhazardous waste because of the split authority for waste management in California: CIWMB has jurisdiction over nonhazardous waste; the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) is responsible for hazardous waste 
management. DTSC publishes an annual catalog, analogous 
to CALMAX, called the California Waste Exchange. 
(For information, contact DTSC: (916)322-7676.)
<P><STRONG><A HREF="../../calmax/calmax.htm"> The California Materials Exchange (CALMAX).</A></STRONG> There is no charge to receive the CALMAX bimonthly catalog, and placing a listing in CALMAX is also free.  Everything listed in CALMAX must be offered at a nominal cost or for free, inasmuch as these are items that would have otherwise been discarded.  The catalog is organized in three major sections:  AVAILABLE LISTINGS (goods offered); WANTED LISTINGS (items desired); and abbreviated REGIONAL LISTINGS at the back of the catalog, for seeing at a glance what is available in any one of California's 14 CALMAX regions, identified at the front of each catalog.  There are 15 materials categories.
<P>All exchanges are transacted between the advertising and responding parties.  CIWMB or CALMAX do not enter into negotiations.  CIWMB merely provides CALMAX as a network for trade.  The primary focus of CALMAX is REUSE  
to continue to use items in their original form.  A secondary focus is recycling, breaking materials down to form new materials or items.
<P>CALMAX provides a reuse network among businesses and organizations that has not existed before now.  Additionally, CALMAX provides an interim market for recycling of materials until an ongoing market is established.
<P>Each catalog provides a wealth of information other than just the "waste not want ads."  A special outreach to schools called KidMAX provides free wanted ads for materials needed by teachers.  These listings are specially marked so businesses<A HREF="../../calmax/kidmax.htm"><IMG SRC="../../calmax/ctl_kidx.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT></A>
can know to donate their discards to them.  Other features include: a bimonthly program update; 
a Match of the Catalog to inspire readers about the wide range of possible trades; lists of related reuse and recycling resources; a form for placing ads; and the all-important Successful Exchange Form for reporting results.
<P><STRONG>Waste Diverted and Money Saved.</STRONG> In its first two years (1992-93), CALMAX diverted more than 170,000 tons from landfills and saved California businesses and organizations over a million dollars.

<P><STRONG>CALMAX On-Line. </STRONG>The expansion of CALMAX to an on-line bulletin board system is a decisive turning-point. Before on-line access was available, CALMAX participants were mostly small to medium-sized businesses.  (Big business has little time and too many potential commodities to trade by thumbing through a 64-page catalog.)  As CALMAX On-Line continues to develop, it is now positioned for potential access on the burgeoning information superhighway.  The potential for wide-scale trading is now virtually unlimited.
<P><STRONG>Local  Materials Exchanges.</STRONG> In a new direction, CALMAX staff will shift gears in 1994-95 to encourage the development of more local materials exchange programs and provide technical assistance to that end.  (Currently, local exchanges exist only in San Diego, Humboldt, Sonoma, and Ventura Counties.)  Ideally, exchanges close to home are the easiest to facilitate because of the minimal transportation involved in each transaction.  If every major region in California were to develop a materials exchange and network their listings with CALMAX On-Line, Californians would reap the optimal benefits of materials exchange.  They would enjoy the expertise of staff in their own community, familiar with commodities and contacts to facilitate exchanges.  At the same time, they would have the benefit of those interactions reaching the pages of the statewide catalog and information system, expanding the possibilities for trades across the State and nation.
<P><STRONG>National Materials Exchange Network (NMEN).</STRONG> All CALMAX listings are uploaded to NMEN regularly. Materials exchange programs at all levels complement each other.  While many exchanges are best made close to home, large companies with a wide radius of business may find it just as cost effective to trade in a larger geographic range.
<P><STRONG>Materials Exchange - An Important Part of the Answer.</STRONG>  Materials exchange is above all, a form of waste diversion.  Because business and industry generate over 60 percent of California's waste stream, the landfill diversion rates required by AB 939 could not be met without programs that encourage waste reduction in the commercial sector.
<P>Materials exchange isn't the only answer, but at the California Integrated Waste Management Board, we hope to see programs like CALMAX and local "miniMAXes" utilized increasingly as a major vehicle of integrated waste management. With over a million businesses in California, CALMAX alone could enable Californians to reach the first AB 939 target of 25 percent diversion from landfills. All it would take is 10 percent of those million businesses making one exchange per year through CALMAX.
<P>Consider the possibilities! CALMAX cannot do it without you. We welcome copromotional opportunities with local government and the business community. More details on topics included in this fact sheet are contained in the CALMAX brochure, a sample catalog, and The CALMAX Users Guide. To obtain these materials 
or for more information, contact Joyce Mason, CALMAX Coordinator, at the California Integrated Waste Management Board: (916)255-2369. Speakers and a slide show on CALMAX are available for your events.
<P><STRONG>CALMAX Has Saved California Businesses Over $1 Million. </STRONG><P>
<EM>CALMAX is a program and service mark of the California Integrated Waste Management Board. CALMAX is operated jointly, under contract, with the Local Government Commission of Sacramento, a nonprofit organization developing local solutions to environmental and social problems facing our communities. The CALMAX 
computer system was developed by American Consulting and Commodities, Inc. (ACCI) of San Ramon.</EM>

<B><H2>Encouraging Top Management to Support Waste Reduction Efforts</H2></B>
<A NAME="top"></A>
<P>

<EM>Every day more companies are taking steps to save money and our natural resources through waste reduction efforts. Where do you begin?  As a first step, you will need to gain 
the support of top management. Every organization is a bit different so you will need to modify these ideas to make them work for you.</EM>
<P>Before approaching management with your waste reduction ideas, consider investigating the pros and cons of your ideas. You will be able to make a stronger and more convincing assessment of why waste reduction, the practice of waste prevention and recycling, is important to your business.  
<HR>
<P><STRONG>Get your foot in the door.</STRONG><P>
Meeting with the right people is essential, but in large organizations this is not always easy. Every organization has its own decision making process, so it would be best to ask several people for ideas.
<P><STRONG>Determine which decision makers need to support your waste reduction program.</STRONG>
<P>
Who has the ability to make decisions about operations, purchasing, products, packaging and services? Usually it's the CEO, owner or other senior managers.
<P><STRONG>Network- Find people who have access to the decision makers and ask for their help.</STRONG><P>
You may not have direct access to decision makers, but you may know someone who does. Ask these people how to best approach decision makers. Do you need to make a presentation? How much detail should it contain? Some managers like to approve general concepts while others want more specific details.  Every manager has his or her own style.
<P><STRONG>Set up a meeting and make a convincing presentation.</STRONG><P>
Managers often have very little spare time.  Make your presentation clear, concise, factual, and persuasive.
<P><STRONG>Collect information and ideas to present to management to show the problem.</STRONG><P>
Is there a problem?  You bet there is.  Californians generate 
45 million tons of waste each year and about 61 percent of this waste comes from commercial and industrial sources.  All of us, at home and work, have a responsibility to conserve resources for future generations.  If it can't be done voluntarily today, 
it may have to be mandated in the future.
<UL>
<LI>Make a short video or take photographs of waste generated at your company.  Photograph dumpsters and trash cans in various locations.  Show the video or pictures to management and employees.  Select images that represent problems, but do not come across too negatively towards any individual or department.
<LI>Explain that California cities and counties are mandated 
by the Integrated Waste Management Act (AB 939), to divert their solid waste from landfills by 25 percent in 1995 and 50 percent in the year 2000, or face significant fines.  So far, jurisdictions are relying on voluntary approaches for the commercial sector.  If unsuccessful, jurisdictions may be forced to find other alternatives.</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Explain what the competition is doing or will be doing soon.</STRONG><P>
<UL>
<LI>Are any of your competitors actively reducing waste?  
In almost every field a few firms have active waste reduction efforts.  Emphasize economic savings or public relations gains that your competitors may be realizing through their waste reduction efforts.  Don't get lost behind the competition.
<LI>Show videos geared toward business managers. 
Keep California Beautiful has two videos that provide several examples of how businesses are saving money and reducing waste.</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Highlight potential savings from waste reduction.</STRONG><P>
The most common benefits cited from waste prevention and recycling efforts are savings in purchasing and waste disposal costs.  Depending on the type of waste reduction practice, you may also need to look at changes in labor costs, utility costs, storage space, printing costs, and postage.
<P><STRONG>Purchase Cost: </STRONG>The purchase cost of one product multiplied by the number needed in a year gives the cost for each year. For example, if product A costs $0.35 each and 365 are used year, the purchase cost is $128 each year. Similarly, if product B costs $80 and lasts 2 years, one-half of the product is used each year resulting in an amortized purchase cost of $40 each year. Include the cost of other items that would be used together. For example, reusable items may require soap for cleaning and disposable items may require additional trash bags.
<P><STRONG>Waste Hauling and Disposal Cost: </STRONG>The combined impact of several waste prevention actions may decrease the level of waste removal services (e.g., number of bins, weight of bins, or frequency of pickups) your business needs.  You can renegotiate waste removal contracts when they expire or, if stated in your contract, you may be able to reduce the level of service at any time.  This results in cost savings referred to as avoided disposal cost.  Keep in mind that these savings can only be realized when there is a downsize in waste removal service.  A single waste reduction effort may not eliminate the need for a bin, but several efforts may.
<P><STRONG>Labor Cost: </STRONG>To assess labor requirements, estimate time required to order, stock, service and dispose of comparable products.  With known labor costs and time requirements for each activity, labor costs can be effectively estimated.  Labor costs do not actually change for a facility unless staff hours are either subtracted or added to payroll as a result of the action. In other words, if existing staff can integrate work into their current schedules, labor costs do not change.
<P><STRONG>Utility Costs: </STRONG>Compare product efficiency and assess the need for energy and water.  Also, find out if any rebates are available.  For instance, washing reusable dishes requires energy and water.  The costs of these resources should be added to the cost of the product.  Purchase of an energy- or water-efficient dishwasher may qualify your company for a rebate, affecting costs.
<P><STRONG>Storage Space:</STRONG> Some waste prevention efforts, such as using a send-and-return envelope (the envelope used for mailing a bill is used for the return check) decrease storage needs.  Other waste prevention practices may change storage needs in other ways.  For example, switching from disposable to washable plates would shift space requirements from dry goods storage areas 
to space near a dishwasher.  Recycling programs may demand additional storage space for holding recyclables between pick ups.
<P><STRONG>Printing Costs: </STRONG>When there is a reduction in the number of copies that must be printed, there is a savings in printing or copying costs.  This may occur when reports are distributed electronically, mailing lists are updated so fewer copies are needed, and documents are shortened (a document is double-sided, has 
a smaller font or smaller margins, etc.)
<P><STRONG>Postage:</STRONG> This is often overlooked.  Less mailing reduces postage costs in addition to saving paper.  First class mail costs $7,000 per ton while the paper itself costs about $1,000 per ton!
<P><STRONG>Indicate likely reactions by customers, Board of Directors, and stock holders. </STRONG>
<P>Determine how key groups will respond to changes in your products, packaging, and improved internal operations.  Todays public is concerned about the environment.  Your efforts to reduce waste may translate into positive public relations and greater sales.
<P><STRONG>Persistence and Patience </STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Don't get discouraged.</STRONG>  Everyone who starts up a successful program faces obstacles.  Sometimes an idea is presented at a time when it must compete with more urgent matters.  And there will always be a few people who will 
object to any change.  Be patient and keep trying.
<P><STRONG>Ask to set up a pilot.</STRONG>  Many managers are willing to try something new for a limited period of time, if it supports their image of quality and saves money.
<P><STRONG>Give management ideas on how they can help.  </STRONG>You will need management to participate in kick-off events, sign memorandums and letters, and endorse the program by setting an example.
<P><STRONG>Encourage managment to adopt environmental policies.</STRONG> Set the tone of management's support by developing a policy statement for management approval.  See the CIWMB fact sheet Environmental Policies for Business on this topic.
<P><STRONG>Ask management to allow staff time to work on program. </STRONG>Staff and managers working on waste reduction will need time to develop a plan, test new ideas, measure results, educate employees, etc.

<HR>
Adopt an environmental policy to reflect how your company sees itself in relation to its environment, neighbors, the people it employs and serves, and future generations.  Today, more companies are adopting environmental policies and many are striving for zero defects, zero pollution, and zero waste because it is part of good business.  Below is language found in environmental policy statements from several companies and organizations. Use it as a starting point for developing your own policies.

<B><H2>Buy Recycled Products!</H2></B>
<A NAME="top"></A>
<P>

<EM><DL>
<DT>The collection of recyclable materials is only the first step 
of the process we call recycling. Interesting new products are being manufactured from your recyclables and turning up in the marketplace. When you buy goods with recycled content, your purchases help to create a demand for materials collected in recycling programs. Remember to ask about a product's "postconsumer content." This means the product was made from materials that were used and recycled by consumers, rather than from manufacturing wastes.</DL>
<P>Here is a look at some of the materials you recycle and the new products that are being made from them:

</EM>

<HR>
<P>
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1>Recycled Paper</FONT></STRONG>
<P>
Paper and paperboard products represent approximately 40 percent of the United States municipal solid waste. "Recycled" once meant brown paper full of specks and blotches. Now recycled papers are available in many attractive styles, grades, and colors. Whatever your need, there is probably a recycled paper to suit your purposes.

<P>
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1>Recycled Glass</FONT></STRONG>
<P>
Glass accounts for about 4 percent, by weight, of California's waste stream. Most is container glass. The remainder is plate glass, fiberglass, light bulbs, and other types.<P>
Recycled glass is currently being used to manufacture all kinds of containers, pressed and blown glass products, beautiful floor and wall tiles, glass blocks, sandblasting material, and reflective paint for road signs. It is also used as a drainage medium, in filtration systems, and in road building materials.
<P>
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1>Recycled Plastics</FONT></STRONG>
<P>
Plastic waste comprises 5 percent of California's waste stream. Recycled plastics are being manufactured into many new products. While all materials are theoretically recyclable, the different plastic types may or may not be recyclable in your community, depending on recycling services available in your area. The most commonly recycled plastics are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) </STRONG> is the most actively recycled resin in the post-consumer plastics waste stream. Most PET recycled comes from beverage containers. Recycled PET is made into polyester fibers used as stuffing for jackets, pillows, and sleeping bags. Five two-liter PET bottles can fill a man's ski jacket; 36 can stuff a sleeping bag.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>High Density Polyethylene (HDPE)</STRONG> Much of the recycled HDPE comes from milk and water bottles and is used to make containers for detergents, motor oil, and some food products.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Polystyrene (PS)</STRONG> is used in a wide variety of consumer products, such as office equipment, video cassette casings, hangers, flower pots, packaging "peanuts," toys, and insulation.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) </STRONG> Film plastics are the most common type of plastic packaging and represent an enormous source of potentially recyclable post-consumer plastic. Consumer and manufacturer interest in plastic film products with recycled content, such as trash, grocery, merchandise, and garment bags, is expected to increase because of the lower color-consistency requirements of this product.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)</STRONG> is primarily used in construction and other applications where collectors have difficulty identifying and separating plastic resins. Markets involving recycled PVC include siding and drain pipe, which can use large quantities of lower-quality resin.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Polypropylene (Pp)</STRONG> is commonly used to manufacture products with extended lifetimes such as furniture and auto battery cases.  Automobile makers are experimenting with recycling PP scrap from old cars into new car bumpers.
<P>
<LI><STRONG> Other</STRONG> includes all other resins and layered multi-material plastics.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Commingled or Mixed Plastics</STRONG> are low value mixtures of post-consumer plastics. These are fueling public interest in products such as plastic lumber, 
to replace the use of pressure treated wood. With extended lifetimes and low maintenance requirements, plastic lumber is suitable for use as landscape timbers, picnic tables, pallets, and marine piers.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1>Compost</FONT></STRONG>
<P>
The growing demand for landfill alternatives in this country is leading more communities to implement yard waste composting projects. Composting provides an environmentally sound method of waste disposal because it relies on natural biological processes under controlled conditions. Composting can reduce the volume of materials by 30-60 percent.
Landscape trimmings are made into a variety of soil amendments and mulches which help to keep weeds out and moisture in.
<P>
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1>Tires</FONT></STRONG>
<P>
Of the estimated 28.2 million tires discarded in California annually, approximately 60 percent are landfilled, stockpiled, or illegally dumped! 16 percent are reused, exported, or retreaded.
Besides being retreaded for reuse, tires are processed into raw materials (crumb rubber) for use in rubberized and rubber modified asphalt paving materials. Tires are also used in building construction, erosion control, artificial marine habitats, crash barriers, and playground equipment.
<P>
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1>Used Oil and Antifreeze</FONT></STRONG>
<P>
Used motor oil is re-refined into new motor oil, as well as transmission fluid and lubricating oils of very high quality. It takes three gallons of used motor oil to produce one gallon of re-refined motor oil, compared to using 75 gallons of crude oil just to make one gallon of virgin motor oil. Used antifreeze is also re-refined for reuse.
<P>
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1>Construction and Demolition Debris</FONT></STRONG>
<P>
Wood waste is processed into a variety of products such as compost, mulch, sawdust, woodchips, pressed wood logs, and fiberboard. Drywall is crushed and used as a soil amendment, or in the manufacture, along with old newspaper, of floor underlayment. Look also for fiberglass insulation and paint 
with recycled content.

<P>

<EM>In 1989, Eat Your Vegetables (EYV), a Sacramento restaurant, opened its doors for business and began finding ways to reduce waste. Ted Jones, owner of EYV, and his employees implemented an array of waste prevention activites and are now diverting an impressive 88 percent of the waste they generate* from two restaurants! EYV restaurants have surpassed the AB 939 State-mandated goals of 25 percent diversion by 1995 and 50 percent by the year 2000.
<P>
Furthermore, Jones found that waste reduction saves money! He says he has benefited from cost savings and adds, "By letting customers know about your efforts, it helps create customer loyalty." Although local jurisdictions must meet the AB 939 requirements or be fined, "restaurants also have to face up to the reality of AB 939 goals and do our part," Jones says.</EM>

<HR>
<P>
<STRONG>Background</STRONG>
<P>
EYV has two cafeteria-style restaurants specializing in baked goods, soups, salads, pasta, and baked potatoes. Customers can return for as much as they like. Each restaurant also has 
a complete bakery and beverage bar. Together the two restaurants have 7700 square feet with seating for 205.
<P>
<STRONG>Getting Started</STRONG>
<P> 
Ted Jones started his waste reduction efforts by taking a look at the waste his restaurants generated; this is referred to as a waste audit or waste assessment. "It helps you understand 
your waste stream and see the major areas that need attention," Jones says. "Then pick one area of waste where you can reduce, donate, reuse, recycle, or compost. Do one thing at a time and use common sense." He adds, "Follow up and follow through!"
<P>
Jones started with glass recycling and then cardboard reuse. Now he and his employees donate, reuse, recycle, or compost almost all the restaurants' waste. They further support recycling by purchasing goods made from recycled materials.
<P>
<STRONG>How do employees know what to do?</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>EYV has formal training for new employees.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>How does EYV prevent waste in the first place?</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>EYV uses washable plates, silverware, and glasses for meals eaten in the restaurant.
<LI>EYV offers condiments in bulk dispensers rather than in individual packets (e.g., cream, salt & pepper, sugar, honey, artificial sweetener, toothpicks, and straws). Bulk dispensers are kept at a central location instead of at individual tables.
<LI>EYV purchases products in bulk, when possible, to 
<LI>reduce packaging. For example, milk is purchased in one-gallon HDPE plastic containers rather than half-gallon paper containers.
<LI>EYV sells nonfat frozen yogurt in cones or washable bowls and spoons, rather than in single-use paper cups with plastic or wood spoons.
<LI>Beverages are dispensed into washable cups at a beverage bar.  This reduces cost, labor, and trash generation.
<LI>Employees cover refrigerated foods with reusable plastic covers rather than with plastic wrap.
<LI>Employees clean up with washable rags rather than paper towels; the rags are washed on site and reused.
<LI>Management posts messages to employees on erasable boards or bulletin boards.
<LI>EYV makes double-sided copies whenever possible and has their toner cartridges refilled.
<LI>EYV has always had a practice of checking the quality 
of incoming produce to assure quality, thereby reducing produce waste.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>What does EYV do with unused food, old uniforms, and food containers?</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>EYV donates these items to food kitchens and shelters. This includes about 250 Ibs. weekly of left over, unused food (8% of waste stream), used clothing such as shirts, aprons, and employee donations (10 Ibs weekly), and used food containers (cottage cheese, 5-gallon pails).
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>How else does EYV prevent waste through reuse?</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> EYV purchases about one third of their beer in refillable bottles; they are picked up when new beer deliveries are made. EYV pays a deposit for these and they cost about 
<LI>5 percent less than nonrefillables.
<LI>EYV uses returnable and reusable containers in its catering operations such as bowls and serving trays.
<LI>Employees reuse plastic garbage can liners.
<LI>Paper used on one side is collected and taken to EYV's printer where it is made into note pads.
<LI>Strawberry baskets are saved and collected by the distributors during peak season. In the off-season, empty baskets are taken to the Sacramento Natural Foods Co-op, which gives them back to produce farmers.
<LI>EYV asked its produce delivery vendor if they would pick up cardboard boxes.  Jones reports that "they were more than happy to do so." Produce delivery people collect empty waxed and other cardboard produce boxes so that they can be reused.
<LI>People who raise exotic birds pick up over 525 pounds per week of produce trimmings (17% of the waste stream). Employees bag and store the trimmings in the walk-in until collected.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>What about composting?</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> EYV has participated in Sacramento County's pilot composting program since July, 1993. Employees place table scraps, food preparation waste, paper towels, napkins, individual milk cartons, flour bags, some office waste, and landscape clippings into a separate container that is collected by Sacramento County on a weekly basis. This amounts to about 1000 pounds per week (about a third of the total waste stream).
<LI>In return for participating in the County's composting program, EYV received free compost to use in its gardens.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>What does EYV recycle?</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A private hauler provides a bin, picks up glass, and pays EYV a minimal amount about $100 each year.

<P>
<STRONG>What effect has waste reduction and recycling had on EYV's garbage volume?</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Initially EYV had two 4-yard dumpsters picked up twice weekly, in other words, they were generating 16 yards weekly. Now they generate 1.5 yards per week about--90% reduction in volume.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Does waste reduction save money?</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Waste reduction saves money in two major ways. One is from avoided disposal costs, the other from savings in purchasing costs. Below is a list of costs and savings from EYV's waste reduction efforts.

<P>
<STRONG>What is EYV still throwing away?</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>They are throwing away plastic liners, plastic wrapper, aseptic packaging from soda syrup boxes, and a little office paper.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Does EYV Buy Recycled?  Yes!</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>They purchase recycled paper with postconsumer content for menus, flyers, brochures, business cards, envelopes, frequent diner cards, and computer paper.
<LI>Other products made from recycled materials without postconsumer content are unbleached coffee filters, unbleached paper towels, toilet paper, and napkins. 
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>How is toxicity reduced?</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Cleaning supplies are biodegradable.  
<LI>EYV uses unbleached paper towels.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>What about energy and water conservation?</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>SMUD and PG&E (local utilities) gave EYV awards for energy efficiency.  EYV converted lighting from incandescent to compact flourescent.  So far the flourescent bulbs have lasted 5.5 years.  EYV also purchased energy efficient equipment for their kitchens.
<LI>EYV installed low-flush toilets to conserve water.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Have there been problems?</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>EYV experimented with paper, rather than plastic straws, but these did not hold up during use.
<LI>Finding someone to take the produce trimmings took about a year. Several unsuccessful contacts were made including a local zoo and several individuals who kept animals.

Printing Tips
</H3>
<IMG SRC="../wpimage/purpleba.gif" ALIGN=texttop
WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALT="o">PDF file printing can be troubling if your "Page Setup" preferences are not correct. Here are some tips:
<P>
<B>A)</B>
Make sure to test your print-output before printing the entire file. To do this, print one or two pages of the file. Choose a text page <I>and</I> a page with graphics. Print these and take a look to make sure they are suitable before sending the entire document to the printer.
<P>
<B>B)</B>
PDF printing can be RAM (random access memory)
intensive. The "spooling" of a large PDF file (as with any file type) can take
a while. The nice thing about PDF files is that they are true pages, and can be
sent in sections, based upon need, to the printer. If your system or printer
does not have a lot of RAM, print the file in 10-page sections (this suggestion
is for files larger than 300k). This will reduce the amount of print time for
large PDF files because the amount of information you are sending from your
computer to the printer is minimized.
<P>
<B>
C)
</B>
Suggested Printer Settings:
<P>
Laser printer settings:
<BR>For black and white output (as the majority of
Laser printers print black ink only) in your Page Setup dialog box, <B>set the "Graphic Mode" to "Raster" or "Black and White"</B>

<P>DeskJets, InkJets, DeskWriters, etc. (both color
and black and white):
<BR>
Grayscale and black and white PDF files will print
fine if the Page Setup dialog box is set to "black and white". This is because
the grayscales of the document are embedded.

<H1>Tips for Listing in CALMAX</H1>
<IMG SRC="cy_bar.gif"  WIDTH=80%></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<P>
</CENTER>CALMAX staff suggest that you first read <A HREF="netiquet.htm"> CALMAX Netiquette</A> and <A HREF="disclaim..htm"> CALMAX Disclaimer</A> for limitations before adding a listing.  Then, to post a new listing, simply type in the following information as you scroll down the screen.  <BR>
<P>  

 <B> Business Information</B>.   Type in your first and last name, business name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number, fax number, and E-mail address.  <B>It is very important to submit this information, so CALMAX staff can contact you in the future to renew or cancel your listing(s).</B>
<P> 
<P> <B><U> Material Category</U></B>.   Listings are grouped into 15 material categories (ie. CONSTRUCTION, CONTAINERS, DURABLE GOODS, etc.).  To select a material category for your listing,  click on the downward arrow in the button bar next to CONSTRUCTION, and select the appropriate material category.  For example, if you are searching for computers, select the "ELECTRONIC" material category. You can place a listing for only one material at a time.
<P>
<B>  Available/Wanted</B>.   Next, select either Available (if you have material you would like to find a home for)  or Wanted (if you are seeking a material).
<P>
 <B>Material Location: City</B>.  Type in the city and state where material is available or where you are seeking material(s).
<P>

<B> Material Name.</B>  Type a <B>short </B>description of the material, such as "COMPUTER EQUIPMENT" or "CLEAN ORGANIC WASTES".
<P>
<B>Material Description.</B>  Describe in detail the material you are listing.  You have four lines of 60 characters each for a total of 240 characters in which to describe your material.  The material description should include such items as:

<UL>
<LI>Physical Properties;
</UL>
<P><UL>
<LI>Whether available item is free or if there is a charge;
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>How much you are willing to pay for wanted items;
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The amount of available or wanted materials;  
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Transportation issues:  how far you are willing to deliver or pick up materials; 
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>How often material is available or wanted; and
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Any other important information you want to include.
</UL>
<P>
<B>KidMAX Listing</B>.  KidMAX is designed to provide a free source of used materials to California's schools.  If you are representing a school that is placing a "Wanted" listing or are a business that would like to donate "Available" items to schools, mark the "Yes" button.  For more information on this program, click on <A HREF="kidmax.htm"> KidMAX</A>.  
<P>
<B>Regions</B>.  In order to encourage local exchanges, CALMAX is organized into 16 regions.  Select the appropriate region(s) where your material is available or wanted.  You may select up to 5 regions, but please mark only the region(s) that apply to your situation.  For example, if you have SCRAP RUBBER available only in San Francisco, mark region 4.   If your company is seeking SCRAP RUBBER in both San Francisco and Los Angeles, mark regions 4 and 11. 
<P>
<B>Submit Listing For Review</B>.  Click on the Submit button <B>once</B> and wait for listing to appear on the screen.  CALMAX staff will review your listing(s) and will contact you if clarification or more information is required.  The listing will be posted on the CALMAX web site within one week.  If you need assistance in placing a listing, contact CALMAX staff at (916) 255-2369.

		<P>
		The passage of landmark state legislation in 1989 and 1990, known as the
California Integrated Waste Management Act (IWM Act), created a whole new waste
management philosophy in California. Based on the principles of integrated waste
management, the IWM Act emphasized conservation of natural resources through a
hierarchy of management methods to reduce, reuse, and recycle solid waste.
		<P>
		The full-time California Integrated Waste Management Board (Board) was
established in 1990 to provide effective and coordinated management of the
state's solid waste. The Board is vested with policy-making and regulatory
authority to ensure a reduction in the quantity of waste generated and disposed
of in landfills, and to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. It is
comprised of representatives appointed by both the Legislative and Executive
branches of state government-a cooperative partnership to develop a
forward-looking solid waste management system.

<H2>Is your garbage really garbage?</H2></FONT>
<B>Goal: To help readers think about the waste they generate.</B>

<P>Is there something in your garbage that isn't really garbage?
<P>Chances are, yes. Over half of what you put in the trash can be recycled, reused or transformed into new consumer products.
<P>Waste prevention and recycling programs are expanding to help local governments comply with a state law requiring cities and counties to cut their garbage in half by the year 2000. Many cities have composting programs and curbside collection programs, but they need you to take another look at your trash. Are any other items that can be recycled in there? If so, it's time to sort them out.
<P>Even yard waste -- which makes up a huge part of California's waste stream -- can be recycled right in your own backyard through the simple practices of grasscycling, mulching and composting. In addition to saving landfill space, you'll save on buying fertilizer for your yard.
<P>If you put vegetable food scraps in the compost bin, you'll be surprised how little real
garbage will end up in your garbage can.
<P>For many of us, recycling has become a habit at home and at work. But for others, recycling and waste reduction has yet to catch on. To learn what you can recycle, call [insert local information].
<P>Let's keep in mind why we're reducing waste and recycling. Not only do we need to conserve our natural resources, but our landfills are filling up fast. If we're not careful with what we throw away, California could run out of landfill space in the year 2005.
<P>Here's one way to remind yourself of the task at hand and to help beat the clock.
<P>Try thinking of your recycling bin as your ungarbage can; put everything in it that your area recycles. Better yet, consider yourself a generator of untrash. The best way to relieve the burden of solid waste management is never to create waste in the first place. And instead of thinking of your trash bin as an ordinary garbage can, consider it as your own little landfill. Don't forget that you'll need to cut the amount of garbage you stick in your landfill in half by the year 2000.
<P>For other ways to recycle and reduce the amount of waste you send to your landfill, call [insert local information number] or the California Integrated Waste Management Board at 1-800-CA-WASTE.

<H2>The meaning and importance of waste prevention</H2>
<B>Goal:  To help readers understand and appreciate waste prevention.</B>

<P>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
<P>This familiar saying was typically muttered by Mom after you caught a bad cold usually doing something foolish -- like playing out in the rain without a warm jacket.
<P>Later on in life, the same prevention motto held true. How many health problems would have hurt a lot less -- both in physical and financial terms -- if we would have paid more attention to warning signs in the first place?
<P>The fundamental virtue of prevention is a valuable lesson that applies to broader notions of public health and the environment, too. Preventing a problem is usually the cheapest way to go when it comes to protecting urban and rural environments. One of the best examples is taking personal responsibility for your own garbage.
<P>Consider this: each Californian, on average, generates eight pounds of waste every day. According to the California Integrated Waste Management Board, Californians are responsible for 44 million tons of garbage annually. Nationwide, the total is more like 200 million tons, more than a quarter of which is merely packaging, the No. 1 waste problem in America.
<P>The recycling ethic has helped stem the flow of garbage into expensive landfills. But it is only a part of the solution to the waste management challenges facing California.
<P>Recycling will always be a part of the strategy behind successful waste management efforts, but ultimately, its role should diminish over time. How can that be? Attribute it to the beauty of prevention.
<P>Prevention in the waste management arena is commonly referred to as "source reduction." It's really a rather simple concept. Eliminate waste before it is created. Less waste means less of a waste management problem, less of a need for recycling. While recycling is an effective way to manage waste materials once they have been generated, waste prevention actually reduces the amount of material used in the first place.
<P>At its core, waste prevention is the design, manufacture, purchase or use of materials to reduce the amount, or toxicity, of trash generated.  If you don't create waste, nobody has to pay to store, collect or haul it to a landfill.
<P>Waste prevention offers significant side benefits as well. It saves precious natural resources by encouraging more efficient use of raw material. And it reduces pollution associated with extraction of raw materials, manufacturing excess products, and waste disposal.
<P>Waste prevention not only reduces the amount of stuff that needs to be recycled, it saves everyone involved money. It reduces waste disposal and handling costs because it avoids a whole series of expensive procedures, including municipal composting, landfilling or combustion in power plants or incinerators. This reduces need for government taxes. And consumers, such as yourself, save directly by buying only what you need, in bulk, with less packaging!
<P>A law passed in 1989 established a statewide goal of reducing the state's waste stream by 50 percent by the end of this decade. Help do your part and try to reduce the waste generated in your home in half. It will take a supreme effort by all to meet this ambitious timetable.
<P>The key to making waste prevention work in order to reach the 50 percent waste reduction goal are not government programs, but individuals. We are all used to doing things a certain way. Preventing waste means we have to make lifestyle changes: purchasing more durable products and rejecting items with individually wrapped or single-serving containers; repairing and reusing items we might have once thrown away.
<P>When the cures involve million dollar investments in waste processing facilities, it seems to make a lot of cents to put stock into more than a few ounces of prevention.

<H2>Overview of waste prevention techniques</H2>
<B>Goal:  To provide readers with ideas on waste prevention practices they can use daily.</B>

<P>California, as well as the rest of the nation, is slowly coming to the realization that solid waste management is no longer an exercise in just finding new places to put trash. Even recycling, which transforms waste into new consumer products, is not enough to avert environmental and economic problems.
<P>The overall amount of garbage produced in the first place has to shrink. It is that simple.
<P>This straightforward realization, however, is not easily translated into the day-to-day operations of homes and businesses. The good news is that more and more individuals, and companies, have seen the light, and have committed to a comprehensive program of waste prevention -- sometimes called source reduction -- to limit the amount of garbage that ends up going to expensive landfills.
<P>Opportunities for preventing waste present themselves on a day-to-day, hour-to-hour (yes, even minute-to-minute) basis. Here are some suggestions to be applied at home, while shopping, in your yard, or at work.
<P>On the Home Front
<P>Think twice before tossing. Can the item be reused for another purpose? Bags, containers, boxes and envelopes can often live many lives. After washing, for example, empty glass and plastic jars, milk jugs, coffee cans or dairy tubs can be used to store leftovers as well as buttons, nails or thumbtacks. If there is something you can no longer use, donate these items to friends and relatives or charitable organizations. If all else fails, hold a garage sale.
<P>Rent, borrow or share things you use infrequently. These items could include everything from party decorations to audiovisual equipment to chain saws, rug cleaners or garden tillers. You should also consider repairing or maintaining items you already have, particularly large appliances and electronic equipment, large items which take up a lot of space if sent to a landfill.
<P>One note of caution is in order. Do not reuse containers that originally held products such as motor oil or pesticides. Harmful residues can persist. And never store anything potentially harmful in containers designed for food or beverages. Always label containers and store them out of the reach of children and pets.
<P>While Shopping
<P>Since packaging is the leading source of waste in landfills, shoppers should always choose products with the least necessary wrapping. Keep in mind that as the amount of product in a container increases, the packaging waste per serving or use usually decreases.
<P>Consider large or economy size containers for household products that are used frequently, items such as laundry soap or pet foods. Using concentrated products also reduces waste, as does bulk merchandise. Be sure to recognize and support store  managers when they stock products with no or reduced packaging.
<P>While waste prevention is typically thought of in terms of reducing the amount of materials going into the waste stream, another critical component is reducing waste toxicity. Many nontoxic alternatives have recently been put on store shelves. Reduced mercury batteries are one example.
<P>In Your Backyard
<P>Sometime using nontoxic alternatives yields fringe benefits. You could plant marigolds in your garden to ward off certain pests, an approach that not only limits the use of pesticides, but brightens up the day of anyone admiring your garden.
<P>Here are some other tips for your backyard. Manage your yard so it creates less waste by "grasscycling" (leaving your grass clippings on the lawn), xeriscaping (planting slow-growing trees and shrubs that require less water and trimming), and mulching (the spreading of clippings and leaves around planted areas to keep down weeds and keep in moisture).
<P>You could also compost yard trimmings and kitchen scraps, start a backyard compost pile or a worm bin to convert food waste into a high quality soil amendment.
<P>At Work
<P>Bring a mug to work for your coffee or tea, a simple act that could save pounds and pounds of paper, styrofoam and plastic waste over the course of a job.
<P>Persuade purchasing departments to choose reusable products, such as recharged cartridges, for laser printers. Apply many of the techniques used at home at work. Also, include the following waste prevention techniques: work with suppliers to minimize the amount of packaging used and to return shipping materials such as crates, cartons and pallets for reuse; use high quality, long-lasting supplies and equipment that can be repaired easily; use supplies and materials for efficiency. For example, switching to double-sided photocopying can cut paper costs by 10 to 40 percent. Reduce hazardous waste by finding out which products in your graphics and maintenance departments -- inks, solvents or glue -- are available with fewer toxic constituents. Ask suppliers about water-based (rather than oil- or solvent-based) products.
<P>If management questions the value of waste prevention, explain to them it makes economic sense. For example, tell them about how about how Fetzer Vineyards of Redwood Valley reduced its waste by 86 percent between 1991 and 1994, saving more than $50,000 in disposal fees. Or tell management about the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, whose waste reduction efforts include donations of used linens and uniforms to the homeless. Total disposal fee savings from their waste reduction recycling programs: $26,000. Or try IBM's Storage Systems Division in San Jose, where innovative environmental packaging has saved more than $4.7 million! And, last, but certainly not least, the AMI South Bay Hospital in Redondo Beach, which has cut its waste disposal tonnage by 50 percent, with cost savings already topping $100,000 since program inception.

<H2>Schools: laboratories of waste prevention</H2>
<B>Goal: To provide readers with general information on school waste prevention.</B>

<P>One of the most effective ways to reduce the mounds of trash generated in California every single day is to educate kids about the value of waste prevention. Children soon discover that saving our environment can be fun and rewarding and can generate more than a few nickels and dimes.
<P>Not only do such efforts help local governments meet waste diversion goals, but our schools represent the best opportunity to make lasting changes in individual habits and our "throw away" culture. Educating the next generation of parents and adults about simple waste prevention can make the job of reducing garbage in the waste stream far easier in the future.
<P>One of the most preventable sources of waste at schools occurs in the classroom. The large volume of paper used by the more than 5.2 million public school children in California can significantly contribute to the waste stream. Simple practices of waste prevention, however, can bring these volumes down considerably. For example, students should be encouraged to submit homework on the back side of used paper. Handouts should be printed on both sides, and teachers can maximize the use of overhead projectors and the blackboards to minimize the use of xeroxed information. Through simple practices of waste prevention, students are learning about resource conservation, AND are practicing what they learn by participating in a simple, but effective, waster reduction program.
<P>What are other, less noticeable sources of waste generated at school-sites? What can schools do to reduce the generation of these materials?
<P>In 1994, the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) launched an investigation to find out what was going on in California schools in order to develop model programs for the entire state. The CIWMB survey of K-12 schools revealed that quite a bit of prevention and recycling activity was occurring, but such efforts were scattered here and there. There was little coordination and most efforts were not comprehensive, but rather stimulated by a few thoughtful and forward-looking individuals. If children were going to make a big impact in the fight against unnecessary waste, however, entire school districts would have to be involved.
<P>The CIWMB then selected a variety of school districts throughout the state to serve as pilot programs to quantify benefits in terms of reducing waste flows to local landfills and saving schools money. To give you an idea of waste prevention techniques schools are implementing, here are a few waste prevention success stories:
<UL>
<LI>The Richmond School District, which educates 31,000 kids in Contra Costa County near Oakland, saved $30,000 in waste hauler fees because of reduced garbage volumes in cafeterias. Student "Green Teams" monitoring the collection of recyclables at lunch has reduced lunch waste by 75 percent!
<LI>Oak Hills Elementary School in Ventura County has set a goal of zero waste generation, also focusing on lunch and snack  activities, and modeled after a program being carried out at all six schools located within the Sacramento area's Oak Park Unified School District. Here are the fundamental rules of the program: student lunches and snacks only use reusable containers; no paper napkins or nonreusable packaging are allowed; all drinks must be in reusable or recyclable containers (no glass); nothing is thrown away. The five hundred students now only fill one 55-gallon can of trash during lunch. Previously, the same students filled eight of these cans.
<LI>The rural Palo Verde Unified School District, located in the Mojave Desert, has joined up with the City of Blythe, a prison and a waste hauler to divert well over three tons of milk and juice boxes and more than forty cubic yards of cardboard from local landfills. All the proceeds from sales of recycled cardboard goes to fund the prison, where laborers sort and bale the material for reuse.
<LI>The Laytonville Unified School District in Mendocino County has discovered that worms can be enlisted in the fight to curb waste. In 1993, the school district diverted 14,000 pounds of waste through its composting and recycling efforts. Lunch waste, including nonprotein food waste and paper bags, is taken to worm bins located in the school garden. The worms, and other waste reduction activities, have reduced the school's garbage by 60 to 80 percent.
</UL>
<P>Based upon these, and other success stories, the CIWMB has developed two guides to help schools reduce waste and save money. Seeing Green Through Waste Prevention provides valuable insights in how to perform waste composition surveys, waste prevention activities and cost analysis procedures to help set up a comprehensive waste reduction program. A Districtwide Approach to Recycling includes case studies that document the economic benefits of districtwide programs and provides detailed information on how to promote district-wide recycling.
<P>Both guides are available by calling the CIWMB's schools section at (916) 255-2385.

<H2>The facts of waste prevention versus recycling</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to think beyond recycling and practice waste prevention.</B>

<P>Practices such as recycling have helped reduce the amount of waste going to landfills.
<P>But a more effective and pervasive strategy to lessen the burden of piles of garbage on local governments is waste prevention. Since 1973, twice as much waste has been diverted from landfills through waste prevention techniques, such as packaging changes and product design, as from recycling, according to the Global Futures Foundation, a nonprofit research group. California businesses have saved millions from waste prevention in 1995 alone. Business benefits from waste prevention efforts as they typically have higher returns on investment than recycling activities -- sometimes as high as 3,300 percent!
<P>Waste prevention is a terrific way to create jobs, reduce costs of doing business and provide great local economic development opportunities.
<P>Local governments up and down the State need to comply with state laws that require 50 percent of the waste generated in their communities to be diverted away from landfills by the year 2000. While recycling will play a large role, waste prevention is the cornerstone of the state's strategy to reduce amounts of waste flowing to dozens of landfills that could reach capacity by the end of this decade.
<P>Everyone has heard the saying "Reduce. Reuse. Recycle." Waste prevention deals with reducing and reusing, and these are preferred because they require fewer resources -- they are at the top of the waste management "hierarchy."
<P>Reducing is the most basic solution to today's garbage glut: less waste means less of a waste problem.
<P>Reuse means obtaining several uses from a product. Extending the life of a product, whether its an old sweat shirt or a piece of furniture, reduces the overall rate of waste generation.
<P>Recycling is at the bottom of the hierarchy since it addresses material that has already entered the waste stream. Recycling is actually just the beginning of the recovery process; it takes energy, resources and money to convert materials into a new product. After recycling, we must "close the loop." Manufacturers need to make products from these recovered materials and consumers then need to buy them (i.e. buy recycled). If there are no end uses for the recyclable materials Californians collect, those materials could still end up in a landfill.
<P>Both waste prevention and recycling are critical strategies that need to be embraced by all of us (citizens and businesses) in order for California to meet its waste management goals.
<P>To make progress on the waste prevention front, we should consider the following goals:
<UL>
<LI>Make an ongoing commitment to no net reduction in landfill capacity
<LI>Conduct waste audits at 80 percent of community businesses by 2005
<LI>Reduce commercial and industrial waste 2 percent annually
</UL>
<P>When all production, shipping and disposal costs are factored  in, waste prevention will save more money than recycling. Think about what you can do to prevent the amount of waste you recycle or throw away.

<H2>The A,B,C's of waste prevention activism</H2>
<B>Goal:  To encourage readers to take actions to prevent waste.</B>

<P>Activism can take many forms.
<P>Most people think of environmental activism as something someone does in their spare time. It entails tasks such as going to a few meetings (maybe even a protest), writing some letters or perhaps making a few phone calls.
<P>Being a waste prevention activist, however, can really be a full-time job and a state of mind. Whether you spend most of your time at home or at work, the best waste prevention activist knows how to be effective without annoying other people.
<P>For instance, many of our old habits are the result of advice from family and friends.  You'd be surprised how many of these decisions would be different if you had all of the facts about how much waste you produce everyday.
<P>While each decision may seem to have a small impact on the amount of material that you throw away, there are accumulative effects. Each Californian, on average, leaves a legacy of over 90,000 pounds of garbage! With this disturbing fact in mind, let's see how each and every state citizen can become a waste prevention activist.
<P>If one were to hand out report cards to waste prevention activists, here's the type of activities one would expect from the top, average and bottom waste prevention activist students.
<P>An "A" activist would live a near waste-free life at home and at work.
<P>All forms of waste at home would be tightly managed.
<P>For example, you would have written the Direct Marketing Association (P.O. Box 9008, Farmington, NY 11735-9008) and reduced your junk mail to almost a trickle. All paper -- mixed mail scraps, magazine, newspaper and cardboard -- would regularly be sorted and recycled.
<P>When shopping, you would bring your own bags (or boxes), choose only products with recycled content packaging (or no packaging at all) and purchased in bulk, but only in amounts that you would realistically use. As a gardener, you would only plant drought tolerant native plants that require little pruning, would grasscycle your lawn and mulch or compost your green waste. To persuade your neighbors, you would set an example. And you would bring up the reasons for some of your yard and home projects in simple conversations.
<P>You would also set an example at work and try to convince fellow employees to develop companywide programs. Developing a proposal for top management, based on long-term economic savings for the firm, would be a priority. You would also write to manufacturers of products you like, but which feature excessive packaging, to ask them to reduce waste in their product packaging.
<P>A "B" activist would focus on durable, repairable products when shopping, but still might stop at a fast food restaurant and help fill the nearby waste container with packaging waste. Nevertheless, you often purchase products in refillable or reusable containers.
<P>You like junk mail. But you spend hours every week carefully sorting the paper heaps into appropriate white, mixed and  magazine stock holders that are then donated to a local charity for recycling.
<P>You love that old-fashioned lawn, but are careful to limit the use of fertilizers and pesticides to limit growth spurts and corresponding increases in green waste. And you've started a compost pile, (but still dump lawn clippings on the street.)
<P>Though you are careful to limit waste production at work, you haven't quite figured out how to tell your coworkers about ways they could improve their less-than-stellar performance in reducing waste.
<P>As a "C" activist you would, at least, be thinking about the amount of waste generated in your household. On the plus side, you can say you repair and maintain the equipment you have and rent, borrow or share things that you use infrequently. On top of that, you often buy safe substitutes for harsh chemical products that are difficult to dispose.
<P>You still like to stick all of your produce in disposable bags and -- worse yet -- you still buy individually wrapped cheese slices for your kids (because that's the only kind they say they like). On the other hand, you once asked the local store manager if he could carry more products that create less waste.
<P>A "D" waste prevention activist recycles beer cans and just started sorting the bottles too. But glass containers that cannot be redeemed are tossed in the trash. Every once in a while, you think about all the junk that flows into the waste cans, but its never really changes your purchasing habits or motivates you to reform the habits of family members or dudes at school.
<P>An "F" activist is rally not an activist at all because this person makes no effort to reduce, reuse or recycle.
<P>Putting the practice of waste prevention into practice will require some lifestyle changes, particularly for those whose current efforts might merit a D or F grade. But changing habits doesn't mean life will be more difficult. Quite the contrary. A few simple changes can start you on your way. Besides, if we don't reduce waste, the economic and social costs of waste disposal will continue to skyrocket and all communities -- large and small, urban and rural -- will face increasingly harder decisions about managing their trash.
<P>As a waste prevention activist, you should also know that the federal government develops and provides information about this important issue and is working to create incentives to reduce waste. Likewise, state government does much the same. For example, the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) has a Waste Prevention Information Exchange that can provide you with factsheets, clip art and expertise to help you start a waste reduction program at work. Just call (916) 255-INFO. The CIWMB also sponsors the Waste Reduction Awards Program (WRAP) every year to recognize California businesses for outstanding efforts to reduce nonhazardous waste generation. Successful firms receive an award and are allowed to use the WRAP logo on products, advertising and promotional materials.
<P>As an employee or businessperson, remember that the workplace is a critical site for waste prevention activities. Whether initiating a paper reduction campaign or convincing upper management to participate in the California Materials Exchange, a  program administered by the CIWMB, sharpen up on your presentation skills. Don't be afraid to let those creative juices flow. Highlight some startling facts to grab people's attention: Californians generate enough waste per year to cover the entire city of San Francisco with over two feet of compacted garbage. Talk to people one-on-one. Be careful not to make neighbors uncomfortable about activities that generate too much waste. Just gently let them know there is a better way.
<P>The bottom line on being a waste prevention activist is teaching by example. And bragging about the results. Let everyone know how much money you've saved, and waste prevention just could become contagious!

<H2>Sustainability = consuming and purchasing less</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to rethink their purchasing practices.</B>

<P>Why do we throw away plastic containers and not our socks?
<P>Both only need to be washed to be reused.
<P>If you want to know the truth, a plastic food container is even more durable and long-lasting than the typical pair of socks, and can easily be used to store leftovers. But for some reason, we think of socks as reusable. Plastic containers are something to throw away.
<P>Marketing experts have sold America on the concept of "convenience" which emphasizes consumption. (That's why socks win over the plastic container.) The more we have to buy something, the more products companies sell. We've been conditioned to believe that more, bigger and newer is always better and more convenient.
<P>Yet making more informed choices about everyday activities such as food shopping or lawn care, (or the decision to reuse a plastic container) can make modern lifestyles more sustainable.
<P>If one looks up the word "sustain" in the dictionary, the most common meanings are "to keep in existence, keep up, maintain or prolong" or "to provide for the support of, as in sustenance or nourishment." These definitions obviously have wide applications. 
<P>The fundamental concept of "sustainability" often becomes blurred when used in the context of being environmentally responsible. When it comes to the topic of waste management, however, "sustainability" can be measured in terms of consuming and purchasing habits.
<P>Stop and think about it for a minute. Everything we buy is made from some material resource. Plastic is made from oil, aluminum comes from bauxite ore, paper is made primarily from trees. All materials are important and valuable, whether we think of them as containers or products, disposable or reusable.
<P>Our consumption patterns form the basis of our perceived purchasing needs. Consuming the largest amount of water, electric, gas, or any type of resource, however, is an unsustainable practice. So are shopping habits linked to excessive or unnecessary purchases. Less consumption -- not more -- should be the overriding rule behind shopping.
<P>Your purchasing decisions, after all, are the culmination of a series of events. Choosing products offered by firms using less packaging, reduced hazardous waste volumes, or those which use more environmentally benign constituents, rewards sustainable practices. Not buying products from firms that use excessive packaging or that contain ingredients with large air, water or soil impacts provides an incentive for companies to reform their businesses.
<P>Perhaps the ultimate trick to conserving natural resources is perceptual. Let's compare time actually saved, and lost resources, to the true cost of those spare moments of convenience.
<P>Americans, for example, throw away six billion disposable pens every year. All those pens take a big toll on our landfills, use  precious oil in manufacturing the plastic, and consume energy for production. Don't forget to add the dollar out of pocket for the new pen. Now, how much time have we saved by getting a new pen out of a box rather than screwing a refill into a reusable one? Is the expenditure of resources worth the promoted convenience? And is it really less convenient to put our reusable plastic food containers in the dishwasher than to put our socks in the washing machine?
<P>To conserve our natural resources, and live a more sustainable lifestyle, we need to a high value on all resource materials. We also need to keep a sharp eye open at the store so we aren't fooled by so-called convenience products.
<P>The notion of sustainability takes into account a series of resource decisions. Your consumption, and corresponding purchases, carry environmental price tags. The closer to zero you can get the final tally, the more sustainable your shopping and lifestyle.

<H2>It's landfull for California landfills</H2>
<B>Goal: To provide readers with a general understanding of landfill problems and why it's necessary to practice waste reduction.</B></CENTER>

<P>Even with the good job Californians are doing of recycling, this state's landfills are filling up fast. Why should you be concerned? Because the age-old laws of supply and demand apply to garbage disposal, too. The less landfill space available, the higher the disposal cost.
<P>On top of that, new landfills are much more costly than the older ones they replace.
<P>As of 1990, about half of the counties in California had less than 15 years of landfill space remaining. These counties, unfortunately, represent 70 percent of the state's population. And California's population -- now close to 33 million -- keeps growing. If no new landfills are built, we could run out of space to put our garbage by the year 2005.
<P>Would you like to live next door to a landfill? Few people would, and that's why finding new space for solid waste is a challenging task. Siting a new landfill can take as many as 14 years; expanding an existing one can take as many as eight years.
<P>Fortunately, there is something positive that every Californian can do. If you, and your neighbors, help reduce the amount of garbage you generate, we can help keep our disposal bills, and our number of landfills, low at the same time.
<P>State law requires that all cities and counties cut their amount of garbage going to landfills in half by the year 2000. And that law is why we encourage you to reduce and reuse, then recycle and buy recycled. The fact is, over 75 percent of what we throw away can be reduced, reused or recycled. And it's easier than you think.
<P>You can significantly reduce your garbage by selecting products with the least amount of packaging, buying items in bulk, and buying products that can be used over and over again. Disposable products, while convenient, waste resources.
<P>Another way to reduce waste is to address green waste. Keep in mind that leaves and grass clippings account for one-fifth of our garbage and take up a lot of space in our landfills. By mulching or composting your yard waste, you can make a big dent in your garbage and get a batch of home-made soil amendment at the same time.
<P>For tips on reducing the amount of garbage you send to the landfill, call [insert local number] or the California Integrated Waste Management Board at 1-800-CA-WASTE.

<CENTER><H2>Grocery shopping with the four Rs in mind</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to shop with waste prevention in mind.</B></CENTER>

<P>Walking into a grocery store can be an overwhelming experience: there are so many choices. What brand? What size? What flavor? What packaging??? By keeping the four R's in mind -- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Rebuy (or Buy Recycled) -- you can reduce waste, and save money, all by the simple process of shopping.
<P>How do you apply the four Rs when shopping? 
<P>It's easiest to shop with the first R -- Reduce -- in mind.  Look for ways to get more product and less packaging for your money. Take dry breakfast cereals for instance. Most are available in large, family-sized boxes, which reduces packaging over time. The idea of buying in larger size holds true for many products, from detergents to tomato sauces and pastes. Second, don't package products that don't need it. Fruits and vegetables are prime examples. Apples and carrots can be bought loose (or, if necessary, be put in a plastic bag brought from home). Third, reuse your paper, plastic, or cloth bags. And fourth, carry a shopping list to reduce the amount of
impulse shopping you do, thereby reducing unnecessary waste.
<P>The second R -- Reuse -- is also important. Buy groceries like juice, lunch supplies and condiments with reusable containers in mind. Juices can be purchased in concentrate form to be mixed in your own reusable containers. You can reduce a tremendous amount of lunch waste by avoiding single serving containers.
<P>The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) has compiled some statistics that speak to the urgency of implementing the credo of Reuse. The CIWMB determined that the average student disposes of 540 paper bags, disposable juice packs, and plastic sandwich bags a year.  Multiply those numbers by the millions of students eating lunches in California schools and you begin to appreciate the need for more responsible shopping habits. Remember, many condiments like ketchup, mustard and salad dressing can be purchased in large containers to reduce waste.
<P>Don't forget to also buy with Recycling -- the third R -- in mind. If you can't reuse an item, or plan to dispose of it, make sure the item is recyclable. Typically, this means it is cardboard, glass, aluminum, tin, or specific kinds of plastic. For example, No. 1 and No. 2 plastics are readily recyclable. (If you are not sure whether the plastic container is a No. 1 or 2 plastic, and therefore can be recycled, ask store management. And if they don't know, ask them to find out!). Recycling is important, but it is often more effective to prevent waste before it is generated in the first place. That's why the first R -- Reduce -- is the top priority.
<P>Finally, Buy Recycled -- buy products made with recycled material. Purchasing these products helps turn waste reduction strategies into economic development opportunities. The packaging on many products lists whether recycled material is used. Buying these products helps "close the loop," and because these products use fewer resources, you will be helping the environment. 
<P>Buying with the four Rs in mind can help build up the piggy  bank and help the [insert County/City name] reach its state waste reduction goals. What better reason to shop responsibly and help your community to do its part to help avert a waste crisis in California.

<CENTER><H2>Reducing food waste by planning ahead</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to prevent food waste.</B></CENTER>

<P>Food.  A lot of our time, money, self-image, social contacts, even childhood memories are bound up with food in some way.  Unfortunately, food also plays a big role in the mounds of waste taken to your local landfill each and every day.  Much -- if not most -- of this food-related waste could, and should, never even make it into your waste basket.
<P>The simplest way to reduce food waste, of course, is to reduce the potential for waste right up front.  Buy the kinds and amounts of food which you anticipate that you, and any likely eating companions, can consume in a reasonable period of time.  Be imaginative with leftovers.  Freeze excess items before they spoil.  When some discards are unavoidable, consider using a garbage disposal or a compost pile.  If you begin composting, be sure to check on recommended methods with the (City/County Waste Management Department), the library, garden center, or book store.
<P>When eating out, order appropriately sized portions if there's a choice.  Share items at places you know tend to have bigger portions than you can eat alone.  Suggest that the restaurant not serve you a side dish if you know you don't want it. (Assure them that there will be other customers who are crazy about macaroni and cheese or those funky looking vegetables from outer space.) Encourage the manager or chef to offer variously sized portions -- or sharing -- if these options aren't available.  Bring leftovers home in a "doggie bag" (preferably not a giant-sized nonrecyclable container), or, if you pride yourself on being the supreme waste preventer,  bring your own doggie bag to the restaurant.
<P>And don't forget to recycle any containers that might be left after food and beverages are consumed - for example, pickle, salsa, or peanut butter glass jars, aluminum or plastic soda containers, tin cans, or fiberboard boxes.
<P>Finally, if you're going on a picnic or having a group in for a casual meal, try using reusable utensils or buying recycled paper products.  This helps prevent waste and reduces the number of natural resources that we use in a ritual that most of us look forward to three times a day.

<CENTER><H2>General packaging reduction techniques</H2>
<B>Goal: To increase the reader's awareness of packaging and encourage waste prevention</B></CENTER>.

<P>Every year, Californians generate approximately 15 million tons of waste that is merely packaging for the actual products we buy. This packaging includes the cardboard and paper wrappers on fast food, the nice camouflage surrounding gifts under the Christmas tree, and the layers upon layers of plastic, styrofoam and other packing materials that always seems to be getting in your way.
<P>There are, no doubt, several important reasons for packaging. Some of them are practical -- such as protection against breakage of products -- and some of them are aesthetic. Regardless of the motives, however, packaging represents one of the most promising areas in terms of reducing the river of waste flowing into landfills.
<P>The concept behind packaging is often sound. It prevents tampering, keeps products -- particularly food -- fresh, and often provides valuable product information. Yet most packaging is only used once before being thrown away.
<P>Remember, you, too, make packaging decisions on a daily basis. You, therefore, can make a difference.
<P>Many everyday household goods have more than one life to live. Before throwing away bags, containers and other items, ask yourself if you can safely use the item elsewhere in the house. For example, you could use coffee cans and similar food containers for storing items such as nails, buttons, tacks and food. Or turn them into a flower pot. Extending a product's life in this way helps slow down the rate at which California's landfills are filling up. It can save you money too.
<P>Consider the additional lives simple items such as a toothbrush can lead. It can become an indispensable household cleaning tool to be used on that old typewriter, new computer or maybe even hard-to-get-to sections of the old car engine sitting in the garage. The Sunday newspaper comics can be transformed into original, and environmentally-responsible, gift wrapping paper. You can reuse an old cardboard box to ship a birthday present to your brother or sister instead of buying new boxes or gift wrap.
<P>Turn recycled paper into greeting cards. Not only would such a project be fun for the kids, but you'll be surprised at the fond reaction you'll get from friends when you start making and sending eco-friendly cards for special occasions or as an excuse to say a simple "Hello!"
<P>Old clothing that is not even fit for the thrift store should not necessarily be thrown away. You can update clothing by adding new buttons or by lowering -- yes, even raising -- hemlines. Ask your local dry cleaner if you can return hangers. Also, request that your clothes not be wrapped in plastic. And build a newspaper box so the newspaper delivery person doesn't have to burden you with rubber bands and protective rain bags.
<P>A few other tips: Use both sides of a piece of paper for writing notes before recycling it. Save colored paper, egg cartons and other packaging for use in arts and crafts projects at day care facilities, schools or youth and senior centers. Turn  used lumber into birdhouses, mailboxes, compost bins or other woodworking projects. Jars can make great cookie cutters; a peanut butter jar can be used to store leftovers or serve as a vase for flowers.
<P>Reducing packaging techniques is not just a hobby for the home, but is slowly becoming standard business practice at a growing number of companies throughout the world. Herman Miller, Inc., for example, saves over $1 million annually by using cartonless or reusable furniture packaging.
<P>Whether at work or in the home, become aware of opportunities to prevent waste by reusing material that used to fill up the trash can. You'll be surprised how less often you'll have to make the trip out to the outside trash can and how much further those dollars will go.

<B>Goal: To encourage readers to reduce packaging waste.</B></CENTER>

<P>Attention: All homebodies, couch-potatoes, and outlet store kings and queens. It's the perfect time to be attentive to reducing your waste (Your waist may need reducing too, but that's a subject I won't touch.) This type of waste reduction is good for public health, as well as the financial health of [insert local information].
<P>Packaging is one of the chief contributors to California's, and the nation's, waste management dilemma. It  accounts for a least a third of the volume of America's trash.  Much packaging has valid uses. But much of it also is completely frivolous with no real functional value. Many products, for example, are sold in packaging that has no basic purpose other than to attract attention or make the product appear larger. The volume of this waste is frequently, and amazingly, excessive. 
<P>Excessive packaging practices are not only wasteful and environmentally unsound, but also costly, to you, the typical consumer. The Environmental Defense Fund notes that $1 of every $10 we spend on food, for example, pays for packaging. When evaluating which of several products to buy, a cost-conscious and environmentally careful shopper should therefore consider the product's packaging characteristics before buying.
<P>Several terms have been coined to describe this "stop waste before it happens" approach.  The terms are "waste prevention" and "precycling." These terms refer to how shoppers should think about their purchasing decisions: avoid overpackaged, disposable, and nonreusable or nonrecyclable products. Avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid.
<P>If enough shoppers eschew mispackaged and overly packaged goods, manufacturers will eventually get the message that something's wrong with their products and modify them if they want to stay in business. And, whenever it's possible (such as in locally owned stores), shoppers can tell their retailer how a product's packaging affects their purchasing preferences.  If enough people do this, stocking patterns will change, and your community will be doing its part to better the world we live in. 
<P>In addition, shoppers can decline bags in which to carry their purchases whenever they can handle the purchases without them (carrying a canvas tote or a previously acquired shopping bag is  helpful).
<P>When packaging cannot be avoided, its recyclability should be considered.  To recycle corrugated boxes -- boxes contracted into parallel grooves for added strength -- remove all packing materials and flatten them before placing them on the curb for pickup.  Noncorrugated boxes such as those for food, shoes and holiday gifts may be put in with recyclable paper.
<P>Avoidance or reduction of waste is the highest form of recycling in the broadest sense: it keeps resources out of the waste stream and in the "useful stream."   Consumers should keep this in mind when making everyday purchasing decisions.

<CENTER><H2>Waste prevention by using nontoxic alternatives</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to use nontoxic alternative cleaning supplies.</B></CENTER>

<P>Many families today recycle and take an active interest in protecting the environment by preventing waste from entering landfills. Oddly enough, the fight against garbage begins right in your own home, the place where you feel safest and most comfortable.
<P>Look under your kitchen sink, in the garage and inside your closets. Do you have chemical cleaners, solvents and other commonly used Household Hazardous Wastes (HHWs) on hand? What will happen to those containers of Ajax, bug killers or other products that feature toxics warning labels? Should they end up in your trash can?
<P>Recycling bottles, cans and newspapers is a great start. But families can do much more to help reduce the amount of materials going into landfills by focusing on reducing toxicity, too.
<P>Over $100 billion has been spent to reduce levels of air pollution, yet exposure to gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide are more likely to occur at home from chemicals polluting indoor air quality. It has been said that the average home today contains more chemicals than the average chemical lab of 100 years ago. The demand for brighter, whiter clothes and for synthetic solutions for other pressing problems has resulted in a situation where your home maybe not be the sanctuary you thought it was.
<P>Some basic waste prevention fundamentals become even more important when applied to products with toxic attributes. For example, try reducing the number of times you use the product. Instead of once a week, perhaps every other week would be enough. Sometimes typical rules of waste prevention may not apply. For example, instead of purchasing the huge economy size of a chemical you may only use infrequently, it might actually make more sense to purchase a smaller size container. Otherwise, you may have a disposal problem down the line.
<P>Another possibility, of course, is to go ahead and buy economy size but share what you don't need with neighbors, or donate the surplus to charity or government. (Remember, however, never to put surplus products with hazardous components in food or beverage containers.) Check and see if there are exchanges that would allow other individuals to use the material. Waste prevention can take many forms, including acts of sharing what you don't need. 	
<P>If you can't find a willing user of the material, watch for opportunities in your community to dispose properly. Often there are special collection days for items such as leftover paints, pesticides, solvents and batteries.
<P>The fundamental ground rule of waste prevention in the realm of household toxics is this: take actions to use nonhazardous or less hazardous ingredients to accomplish your tasks. Instead of bombarding your garden with pesticides, find out about plants that may do the same job. Instead of toxic cleaners, dissolve baking soda or mix vinegar with salt and water for a good surface cleaner. Instead of letting go another flea bomb because your pet cat is scratching away, why not start with a vacuum? Then feed  brewer's yeast, vitamin B or garlic to your pets. Or wash your pet with herbs such as rosemary. All of these things may take care of the fleas without exposing you, your pets, and the rest of your family, to possible side effects of toxics.
<P>Making the switch to nontoxic or less toxic products may ultimately reduce the amount of toxics being used in the workplace to manufacture consumer products containing hazardous substances. This, in turn, can potentially reduce the number of workers exposed to such substances. Since manufacturers respond to consumer demands, switching to less toxic or nontoxic household products will send a message to produce safer alternatives.
<P>In the long run, using nontoxic alternatives reduces both solid and hazardous waste entering landfills. It is a waste prevention strategy that benefits both the earth and home.

<CENTER><H2>Reduce household hazardous waste</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to reduce their use of toxic chemicals.</B></CENTER>

<P>All over California -- lurking on shelves in garages, hidden under kitchen and bathroom sinks -- lie an array of hazardous wastes which pose serious threats to California's environment. Nasty enough to warrant protective suits, gloves and goggles in the workplace because of the industrial strengths used, these products can be purchased in reduced concentrations by anyone for home use.
<P>Paints, car products, pool chemicals and other products pose a danger to children and pets. Poison Control Center statistics show that half of reported poisonings occur from non-drug-exposures. Approximately 20 percent of these nondrug exposures stem from cleaning products.
<P>Serious accidents result when products are misused. Read the product label and make sure that it will do what you intend. Use the product correctly to prevent poisoning and injury -- don't mix products together -- and remember twice as much is not always twice as good.
<P>Look-alikes can be dangerous. To a child, rat poison can look like granola; antifreeze like something good to drink. Streams, rivers, oceans and groundwater are polluted when waste products spill or are poured on to the ground. Throwing hazardous household products into the trash can also injure refuse collectors. Items such as aerosols cans, might not seem to be hazardous waste, but they are. They may explode. Chemicals can splash and irritating fumes can be created from mixtures of substances with toxic constituents.
<P>These products also become headaches if they enter the waste stream. When surplus household cleaners, automotive products, pesticides, motor oils and other products containing potentially dangerous materials are thrown away, they become household hazardous waste.
<P>Typically, these products have the words "Danger," "Warning" or "Caution"  on the label. These words are signals that you should be careful when disposing these products.
<P>Some products, such as aerosol cans, are especially dangerous if dumped into landfills, so the California Legislature has explicitly mandated that they not enter the waste stream. Aerosol cylinders have exploded and started fires at landfills. The costs to local governments for these troublesome items are high -- approximately $3 a container. Since these cans contain residual chemicals, they cannot be recycled. They may end up in specialized treatment centers as far away as Washington or Texas. Responsible citizens  decrease their use of aerosols. When you have aerosols, keep them as long as their shelf life is good and the contents are useful to you. Dispose of them at community Household Hazardous Waste collection centers.
<P>Some basic ground rules for reducing household hazardous waste are as follows: If you have to purchase toxic products, simplify your life -- buy one product that will do the job of many expensive ones -- buy only what you need. If you buy more than what you intend to use, donate unused portions of products to friends or community organizations. Take products such as used motor oil, batteries and latex paint to a recycling center.
<P>Remember it is illegal to put household hazardous waste in the trash or to pour paint or pesticides down the drains in your home or storm drains. If any products cannot be reused, or properly disposed of in your trash, store them in their original containers away from food, pets and children, and wait for a household hazardous waste collection day in your community.
<P>For information on local collection programs, call [insert local information].

<H2>Garage sales, rummage sales and thrift shops</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to practice reuse via donations and shopping.</B></H2>
	
<P>As any weekend garage-saler can attest, there are many prime opportunities for you to prevent waste through the treasured acts of selling and shopping.
<P>How can this be? Can you say R-U-M-M-A-G-E  S-A-L-E or T-H-R-I-F-T  S-H-O-P?
<P>One person's trash is another person's treasure.
<P>OK, you've been a good shopper. You've purchased durable items that have lasted far longer than you ever anticipated. But do you have to live with these things forever?
<P>The answer is no. There is no need to throw away used items that are in good or repairable condition just because you have no further use for them. And they don't have to contribute to your clutter collection, either. When cleaning out a closet or a garage, redecorating or moving, give your unwanted items a second life.
<P>Remember, recycling is wonderful. But reducing the amount of goods we have to discard in the first place is even better. Every item reused is one less pound, give or take, for the landfill; the more natural resources saved -- whether wood (for furniture or paper) or cotton (for clothes) or oil (that's the basis for plastics, don't forget) -- the less energy and water used, and the less pollution created in the production process.
<P>Turn those old sweaters, record albums or college textbooks into cold, hard cash. Hold a yard sale with your neighbors. Haul out that old couch that's been sitting in the garage for eons. If you are past the deadline for placing a garage sale ad for this weekend, you could check on a "too late to classify" ad or get one in early for next weekend.
<P>Garage, rummage and thrift sales can benefit all of us. They are not only a way to get rid of old items, they also represent a chance to be green shopaholics.
<P>Purchasing secondhand items at garage sales or thrift stores reduces waste. At garage sales, it's not uncommon to find goods in nearly perfect condition for a fraction of their original price. But please remember that waste prevention also means not acquiring things we don't really need (and which will have to be disposed of later), so consider making a pledge to only buy presents for friends from these outlets. Or just think about what you might need for the Halloween costume or other special events.
<P>Do yourself and the environment a favor -- consider reuse FIRST.

<CENTER><H2>Reuse ethic: repair, donate and buy used</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to adopt a reuse ethic.</B></CENTER>

<P>If you are moving soon, or just finally got around to that spring household cleaning, you should be aware that prime opportunities to be a waste prevention activist loom on the horizon. Whether you repair broken goods, donate items to charitable organizations, or even buy used products, you can help in the fight against unnecessary waste.
<P>Repairing broken, damaged or worn-out possessions is usually preferable to throwing them away or buying new replacements because it saves you money. There are several ways to find a person or shop to repair items. These include checking your telephone directory, newspaper ads and hardware stores, or taking recommendations from friends and acquaintances.
<P>Phone Book -- If you're trying to find out about repairs of durable goods, check the Yellow Pages under "fix-it services" and "home repair and maintenance," or look under the names of particular items you need serviced. Some sample listings are:
<UL>
<LI>Major Appliances -- dealers and service
<LI>Lawn mowers -- sharpening and repairing
<LI>Shoe repairing
<LI>Upholsterers
<LI>Vacuum cleaners -- repairing and parts
<LI>Video equipment -- service and repair
<LI>Computers -- service and repairs, supplies and parts
<LI>Copying machines and supplies
<LI>Typewriters
<LI>Newspapers -- Check the classified ads for repair services and handypeople. Many newspapers often have separate display advertising sections labeled "Dial-a-Pro" or something similar.
<LI>Hardware Stores -- Look at the business cards displayed on bulletin boards at local hardware stores and ask for any other information they may have.
<LI>Personal Recommendations -- Don't forget to ask friends and neighbors for recommendations about repair shops. It is often best to speak to friends or neighbors to get some indication of the quality of a person's past work.
</UL>
<P>Beyond repairs, other possible waste prevention techniques include the act of donation. If you don't have time for a garage sale, don't want to place a classified ad and have already offered your rich assortment of goodies to all your friends, consider giving what's left to family members, neighbors or charitable organizations. Or, better yet, consider organizing a food or clothing drive. Where appropriate, encourage area merchants to donate damaged goods or food items that are still edible to food banks, shelters and groups that serve the homeless.
<P>Charitable organizations can also repair, clean and resell many of your old treasures. In many cases, these organizations will pickup items right from your home. Donors may sometimes receive tax deductions. Remember, all items should be usable, clean and of reasonable quality.
<P>In addition to the many community agencies that welcome donations, there are many places where you can not only give away  or sell your reusable items, but can also buy good used items. This "give and take" approach to possessions is sound from a solid waste management standpoint. Patronize both nonprofit and commercial stores that further the reuse ethic. Consider purchases not only of used clothing or furniture, but also musical instruments, toys and video games, sports equipment and even medical equipment and supplies.
<P>Remember, opting for used or "irregular" items is another  good way to practice waste prevention. It's often hard to determine why an item might be considered flawed. Such products are often less expensive than new or "first quality" items, and using them will keep them from being thrown away.
<P>The bit of extra thought you give to these ideas now can mean a great deal to those who'll benefit when you "leave less behind for the future." The environment also benefits any time waste is reduced and resources are reused and conserved.

<CENTER><H2>Reusables: items like bags and boxes</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to use reusable packaging materials.</B></CENTER>

<P>America is a disposable society. We pay premium prices for brand new products just for the sake of convenience. Why clean a ceramic mug when you can throw a disposable cup away?
<P>This throw-away culture, however, cannot continue if California, and the rest of the nation, wishes to move beyond a costly solid waste legacy to a more sustainable economy. You, along with businesses and governments, can make a difference. Take personal responsibility for your own waste stream by paying more attention at home.
<P>Many everyday items -- including bags and boxes -- can have more than one use. And there are durable alternatives to these "disposable" containers as well, which offer additional ways to avoid taxing California's overburdened landfills.
<P>Before discarding containers such as bags and boxes, consider whether it is practical and hygienic to reuse them. For example, you can reuse paper and plastic bags -- as well as those twist ties. Keep a supply on hand -- in a drawer or perhaps a hanging basket -- in the kitchen. Instead of placing food items -- such as cheese or vegetables -- into a new plastic baggy, place them in a plastic bag previously used to package another food item.
<P>You can also reuse brown paper shopping bags to ship an item instead of buying shipping paper. And don't buy those expensive shipping boxes, especially if you are trying to figure out how to recycle all of those cardboard boxes that keep stacking up all around you. Simply cover up the old addresses and use them to send packages to others. A good method is to write the new address information on 3 X 5 cards and then tape these cards over the old addresses.
<P>If you are cleaning out paperwork, such as taxes, favorite newspaper clippings or bills, see if you can find a used box as a container before you go running off to purchase expensive specialty products at the store.
<P>Don't limit yourself to paper products containers either. Glass and plastic containers offer even more opportunities for reuse. A jar, for example, can be used as a cookie cutter and be used to buy foods such as honey, maple syrup and peanut butter in bulk.
<P>One final thing to remember about reusing bags, boxes and other containers. There are ways to avoid having such bags and boxes around the house in the first place.  You can take a string, mesh or canvas tote bag with you on your next visit to the grocery store or other shopping destinations.  (If you know you are purchasing several heavy items, bring a box.)
<P>When a reusable bag is not on hand, and only one or two items are being purchased, consider whether you need a bag at all.

<CENTER><H2>Don't dump, donate</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage business readers to practice reuse.</B></CENTER>
	
<P>The Hewlett Packard Co. has long been a leader in reducing waste from its computer manufacturing processes. However, following recent renovations, the firm still accumulated materials, such as used furniture and unused computer paper.
<P>Rather than view these items as waste or even candidates for recycling, the forward-looking company decided to donate the items to a local school. Not only did this act divert this potential waste from the landfill, but it also helped the school keep its operating costs down.
<P>This success story is one of only a few and California's overburdened landfills could benefit from more like it. Just ask your local landfill operators.
<P>For example, officials at one landfill have reported the disposal of new records, compact discs, campaign gear, clothing and other textiles. Landfill operators have seen truckloads of other shelf-ready merchandise -- including boots, laundry detergent and food -- dumped at landfills for the sole sake of clearing excess inventory.
<P>Perhaps these businesses do not realize that under Internal Revenue Code Section 170(e)(3), cost tax deductions are available to many donors of excess inventory. This law allows "for profit" enterprises to donate their excess inventory to charitable organizations and receive a deduction of up to twice the cost. Shipping and handling expenses are also deductible.
<P>If you manage a business and you aren't sure where or how to donate your excess inventory, you might consider contacting Gifts in Kind America. This nonprofit organization, formed in 1983 by the United Way, provides support to charities through in-kind donations from businesses. (In-kind donations are donations of service or materials instead of money.)
<P>Based in Alexandria, Virginia, Gifts In Kind became its own independent nonprofit entity in 1984 and has made connections for businesses to donate over $250 million worth of products in its first eight years of existence.
<P>Some of the organization's clients include Fortune 500 corporate giants such as Hewlett Packard and the Gillette Company; others are small, independent family businesses. Gifts in Kind also brokers and handles all "product giving" for computer firms such as Microsoft. Every year, the group disperses products to approximately 50,000 nonprofits nationwide. It also networks with nearly 400 retailers to donate clothing via the American Apparel Manufacturing Association.
<P>Business owners and managers should consider donating excess inventory as an alternative to dumping it in landfills. We can all benefit if you give. Your motto should be simple: "Donate...Don't Dump!" It's a win-win situation for all of us and makes business "cents."
<P>Gifts in Kind America can be reached at (703) 836-2121. Your accountant can also provide information on this special deduction.

<CENTER><H2>Junk mail</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to get off junk mail lists</B></CENTER>.

<P>Much like that persistent pink rabbit with the drum kit we see on television, it keeps coming, and coming, and coming. It's always there, Monday through Saturday, week in and week out, through rain, sleet and even snow.
<P>It, of course, is junk mail! That incessant stream of printed matter soliciting your hard-earned dollars for the latest cause of the moment or the "Sale of the Century." Not only does junk mail waste your precious time, but it is also waste that typically takes up precious space in your local landfill.
<P>Did you recently ask if you could put yourself on lots of mailing lists (with companies you don't even know the names of) and deliberately put in a plea for more junk mail (aka "business bulk mail")? Did you also volunteer to create more waste for your local government so the current statewide disposal rate of one ton per second Californian jumps up a notch?
<P>Probably not, at least not willingly. Chances are, however, you unwittingly did these things if you recently ordered something from a catalog, sent a check to a charity, responded to an ad offer, used your credit card, subscribed to a new magazine, bought  a new appliance and filled out the warranty card or even just had your name added to the phone book.
<P>How do all of these things tie together? Direct-marketing companies, credit bureaus and credit-card companies, warranty card recipients and mailing list brokers are probably as interested in the business of renting, selling or trading your name, address and/or phone number to others as they are in selling you something or giving you credit.
<P>When you realize the latest dream contest you entered was really a ruse to add your name to still more mailing lists just so you can waste even more precious time reading still more junk mail, you know its time to take action.
<P>What can you do? You could move, but they would find you. You could change your name, but what a hassle, and your parents might not be to crazy about it. Though you may feel hopeless wading through the marketer's pleas, there is hope.
<P>Though it is not easy to get off of mailing lists, it's not impossible. Call 800 numbers in catalogs and ask to be taken off their mailing lists. Contact specific organizations or businesses with your request for removal, but be sure to include the mailing label so they can identify how you are listed in their files. More drastic -- some might say empowering -- approaches include taking the unopened envelope and scrawl "refused, return to sender" on it and let the sender pay for postage twice. They will eventually get the message, or go broke paying for letters to themselves.
<P>Other tips for staying off phone lists (which quickly become mailing lists) include not putting your phone number on checks and having an unlisted number.
<P>One simple way to reduce overall mail burden by halting the spreading of your name to other mailing lists is to write to the following address: Mail Preference Service, Direct Marketing Association, P.O. Box 9008, Farmingdale, NY 11735-9008. Ask them to place your name in the "suppress" file. This will not take your name off existing mailing lists, but it will keep you from being added to new ones for five years.
<P>Credit bureaus have been known to sell names and addresses to banks and credit card companies. Here are the addresses to three of the largest credit bureaus:
<UL>
<LI>Equifax Options, Equifax Marketing Decisions Systems, Inc., P.O. Box 740123, Atlanta, GA 30374-0123.
<LI>Trans Union, Transmark, Inc., 555 W. Adams Street, Chicago, IL  60661.
<LI>TRW-NCAC, Att: Mail Preference Service, Target Marketing Services Division, 12606 Greenville Ave., Dallas, TX 75243.
</UL>
<P>When you buy a new product, don't fill out the warranty card. They are typically solely a means to gather names for direct-mail lists. Typically, you are covered by the warranty whether the card is returned or not. Feel free to contact one of the largest warranty card companies and asked to be removed from their list: National Demographics & Lifestyles, List Order Services, 1621 18th St, #300, Denver, CO 80202.
<P>Here are some additional culprits in the business of direct-mail lists. Write them at: (1) Donnelley Marketing, 1235 N. Ave., Nevada, IA  50201-1419; (2) Metro Mail Corporation, 901 W. Bond, Lincoln, NB  68521; (3) R.L. Polk and Company, List Services Division, 6400 Monroe Boulevard, Taylor, MI  48180; (4) Haines and Company, Inc., Pat Garner, 8050 Freedom Ave. NW, North Canton, OH  44720.
<P>One has to be patient in the battle against junk mail. It took years to build these lists. It will take a while -- up to six months -- before you will notice a reduction.
<P>For additional information call the California Integrated Waste Management Board's hotline: (800) 553-2962.

<CENTER><H2>Grasscycling offers simple alternative</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to practice grasscycling.</B></CENTER>

<P>One of summer's great traditions is dragging out the old lawnmower, cutting the grass, and trashing those mounds and mounds of clippings. But before you get right back into the swing of things, did you ever stop to think what happens to all those bags of clippings generated from your, and your neighbor's, weekly mowing ritual?
<P>Grass clippings make up a surprisingly large portion of California's waste stream -- as much as several million tons each year. Yard waste, on average, makes up 15 percent of all garbage, and during the growing season half of that is grass clippings. With California's communities looking for ways to reduce waste, a simple alternative to bagging clippings and dumping them in the landfill is to practice the art of "grasscycling."
<P>Unlike many other forms of waste reduction, grasscycling sometimes requires you to do less, rather than more, work. Instead of raking up all those clippings and putting them in a bag or at the curb for pick-up, grasscycling is the natural recycling of grass. In other words, just leave clippings on the lawn when mowing.
<P>Won't that cause thatch, which leads to decay and a bad looking lawn? Think again. Grass clippings decompose quickly and release valuable nutrients back into the soil. University studies have shown that grasscycling is not harmful to lawns when they are cared for properly. In fact, grasscycling has long been a common practice on large grass areas such as parks, golf courses, and sport fields -- locations where clippings collection is not feasible.
<P>The basics of grasscycling are nearly identical to conventional lawn care:  Water and fertilize in moderation, keep mower blades sharp, cut when the grass is dry, and never remove more than one third the length of the grass height at once.  Because bagging is eliminated and nutrients are returned to the soil, both time and money can be saved.
<P>These benefits for you are matched by even bigger benefits for society at large, as precious and costly landfill space is reserved for other forms of garbage that have no alternative or beneficial uses.
<P>To make your grasscycling chores even easier, specialized "mulching" mowers are now available from most major manufacturers. These special mowers chop clippings into small pieces that can barely be seen and decompose quickly.  For existing mowers, retrofit kits are often available from local dealers to convert  a standard machines to a mulcher.
<P>Because the landscaping industry is facing increasing pressure from local governments to meet California's aggressive waste reduction mandates, Dr. Ali Harivandi, a turfgrass specialist with the University of California Cooperative Extension for the San Francisco Bay Area, promotes grasscycling.  "Turf has often been blamed for many environmental concerns," Dr. Harivandi explains. "First it was the drought, then groundwater contamination from fertilizers, and even air and noise pollution from mowers!  Now it's solid waste issues." 
<P>The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) in Sacramento worked closely with Dr. Harivandi to develop a grasscycling brochure to educate homeowners and landscapers.  The CIWMB and Dr. Harivandi have also worked with the landscaping industry to broaden acceptance of grasscycling.  The California Landscape Contractors Association (CLCA) has now officially endorsed grasscycling as a responsible turf management technique.
<P>Recognizing that yard waste disposal bans have occurred in other states, the "green industry" in California is increasingly receptive to managing yard wastes in a more environmentally-sound manner.
<P>The State of California has learned to "practice what it preaches" in its own front yard, too.  The CIWMB established grasscycling demonstration sites at the State Capitol in cooperation with the Office of Building and Grounds of the Department of General Services.  The grounds crew has been so pleased with the resulting time and money savings that they are converting their entire fleet to grasscycling mowers.  [Mention if any local public agencies, including schools, are involved in grasscycling programs]

<P>If you had a choice, which would you rather see grow -- your precious little garden or that expensive landfill on the edge of town?	
<P>Chances are the garden would win out. But once that choice has been made, you might want to get a few tips on how to turn yard clippings, fall leaves, or even vegetable or fruit scraps, into the marvelous substance of compost.
<P>What exactly is composting, some of you may ask? Composting is the natural process of decomposing organic material, like leaves or grass clippings.  Bacteria and insects consume this material leaving nutrient rich soil.  Composting has been going on in forests since the beginning of time and can easily be done in your backyard.  A major advantage of composting for any gardener is that the home-grown compost can be used instead of commercial fertilizers and mulches.
<P>Composting techniques such as grasscycling, which refers to the practice of simply leaving lawn clippings on the lawn after mowing, can be integrated into a broad waste prevention campaign in your home or business. Though frequently thought of as nature's way of recycling, composting is really a waste prevention activity because it prevents so-called "green wastes" from becoming a waste in the first place.
<P>And home composting is an easy, responsible way to keep millions of tons of organic materials each year from becoming a waste disposal burden. Despite common impressions, all of the "green" waste that is shipped to landfills never finds its way back to the soil because new liners designed to prevent toxic releases also limits oxygen to break down this organic material. Composting is, therefore, a way to "close the loop" right in your own backyard.
<P>Many California communities now offer classes and guidebooks to help residents compost yard trimmings and kitchen scraps conveniently and safely.  The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) has produced videos for use by local governments to educate residents on various approaches to this environmentally friendly way to both reduce waste and produce soil product for yards and gardens.
<P>To compost in your backyard, all you need is a little space (about a square yard) for an open pile or compost bin. Several composting bins are commercially available [mention if there is a local bin program and who to contact].  Composting can also be done in open piles, though bins are often preferable as they keep the material contained, hold moisture better, and offer resistance to rodents.
<P>Those persistent Fall leaves can go into the compost pile along with grass clippings, bush trimmings, weeds, and other yard waste.  Kitchen scraps (no meat or dairy) can also be added, but should be covered with the non-food material in the bin.  The pile needs to be kept moist; in the Fall, the rain may do this for you, otherwise use a hose or gray water. If you take out a handful of material, squeeze it and a couple of drops come out, it's wet enough.  About once a week, fluff the pile with a pitch  fork to give it air.  You can also turn the pile completely over by building it into another pile, or remove the bin and repile it into the bin (to do this you'll need a couple of square yards of space).  In a couple of months you'll have compost for your yard.
<P>Fall leaves can also be piled up by themselves either in a bin or covered pile and left to sit out the winter.  In the spring, the leaf pile will have shrunk considerably and can be mixed with grass clippings and other yard and vegetable trimmings in a new compost pile or put on the soil directly as a mulch.  Leaves can also be used as a mulch in the fall by raking them directly onto dirt areas where they will break down naturally by spring.
<P>Businesses are also jumping into the compost pile. For example, the Pebble Beach Company of Monterey County is developing an ambitious yard trimmings composting program at their internationally renowned seaside resort.  The company, responsible for managing five world class golf courses, must also manage 2,500 tons of assorted trimmings generated from those courses as well as 3,500 acres of forest land in the Del Monte Forest.  A majority of the materials generated at the golf courses is grass clippings, while the trimmings from the Forest include dead trees and exotic plants removed while replanting the area with native plants and trees.  Historically, these "wastes" were sent to a local landfill.
<P>Then something marvelous happened. The company purchased $175,000 worth of equipment to process plant material into compost at their on-site maintenance yard.  The purchase was economically feasible due in part to a 40% recycling investment tax credit program administered by CIWMB.  By composting yard trimmings instead of sending them to the landfill, the company will save $65,000 per year in labor, transportation, and disposal costs.  The compost produced will be used as a soil amendment for the forest replanting program, potentially saving over $20,000 per year which is currently spent on soil amendment purchases. 
<P>By using compost on the same area where it was originally generated, the composting program at Pebble Beach is simply a large, but excellent example of "closing the loop" at home.

<CENTER><H2>A recipe for good compost</H2>
<B>Goal: To provide readers more specific information on how to compost.</B></CENTER>
	
<P>Composting is a means of using natural decomposing processes to turn kitchen and yard waste into a nutrient rich soil supplement for your yard or garden.  It can be fun and rewarding to return organic matter to the land by creating soil.  And, to top it off, composting helps your community to reduce the amount of "garbage" that needs to be processed by professional, and expensive, waste processors.
<P>Look upon composting as a way of recycling organic matter. It stimulates natural cycles of decomposition and is an ecologically sensible way to use organic wastes. From the view of local governments, composting is a waste prevention strategy because the material never enters the waste stream. Whether trimmings from the bushes lining the house or scraps from the dinner plate, composting offers a convenient solution to particularly troublesome wastes.
<P>If you have some yard space, about three square feet, and a little time, you can compost.  Composting can be practiced using a home made or manufactured bin, or an open pile. Here are a four key recipe tips to make sure your compost ends up being a winner.
<P>1. Green-brown mix: Wet or "green" materials such as fresh grass clippings and food wastes tend to be high in nitrogen. Dry or "brown" materials such as leaves and dried yard waste are high in carbon.  Both of these materials are needed, in approximately an equal mix. Remember, these materials should be crumbled, shredded or chopped to be less than 12 inches in length to achieve good compost.  Avoid putting meat and dairy products into the pile.
<P>2. Moisture content: The compost pile should be kept damp, but not soggy.  It should receive an occasional watering both on top and inside and be kept "moist as a wrung out sponge."
<P>3. Air:  The bacteria and fungus that help decompose the green and brown waste need air to survive.  Therefore, compost piles should be turned once every week to two weeks.  If you do not turn your pile regularly it will lack oxygen, become anaerobic, and begin to emit odors that are, generally speaking, not associated with fine cooking.
<P>4. Size: The ideal size for a home composting pile is three square feet.  This size allows the pile to heat up, killing weed seeds and speeding up the decomposition process.  Hot compost piles can produce compost in less than a month while cool compost piles can take more than two months.
<P>How will you know when the compost is done? Finished compost is uniform dark brown material that has an earthy aroma. Once the material in your compost bin has reached this state, the few larger chunks of wood or other material that remain can be added to a new pile to begin the decomposition process again.
<P>These backyard composting principles can also be applied at apartments and businesses.  However, because space is frequently a problem,  you can compost using a smaller pile or you can  compost using a worm bin.  For more information on composting call [insert local information].

<CENTER><H2>Xeriscaping</H2>
<B>Goal: To provide readers with information on xeriscaping.</B></CENTER>

<P>You may think that decisions about how to landscape your front yard, as well as that new garden in the back, should be nobody's concern but your own.
<P>Well, actually, they are. But if you want to reduce your own maintenance chores and lessen the burden on California's waste management and water systems, you may want to consider xeriscaping, which is a low-water-requiring landscape practice.
<P>Careful planning of landscaping at home -- or at the office -- represents a long-term investment that can have a profound effect not only on wastes heading for the landfill, but on precious, and scarce, resources such as irrigation water (not to mention your time.) Xeriscaping can reduce the amount of waste generated by growing plants, and can also reduce time devoted to weeding, pruning and watering necessary to maintaining a beautiful landscape.
<P>The first step to developing a truly eco-friendly green landscape comes with purchasing decisions. You should look for landscaping supplies that are available without excess packaging. Buying in bulk is typically the best route to take. If you choose to use them, commercial garden supplies can be purchased in bulk quantities, reusable containers or water -soluble packages. Bulk packaging reduces the amount of waste per unit of product, and usually costs less. Xeriscaping, you might want to know, encourages the use of integrated pest management and therefore limits the need for traditional pesticides.
<P>In the landscape industry, the reuse and recycling of plant containers can have a dramatic impact on the waste stream from landscape operations. Nurseries, for instance, may accept certain empty plastic flats, as well as plastic and wood plant containers, for reuse. Wood containers can be reused as decorative planters, cut up into stakes, or ground up for mulch. Plastic containers can also be reused or recycled into plastic lumber for landscaping timbers and other uses.
<P>Perhaps the most important decision you have to make as a xeriscaper is what plants to plant. Remember, the less pruning required by plants, the better. Trees and shrubs that are native to California are often drought-tolerant and slow growing. As a general rule of thumb, these plants will produce less waste (and require less water). These plants are typically deep rooted and often have leaves specially adapted to reduce transpiration rates (thick cuticles, hairy leaves and stems, fewer stomata).
<P>Most successful unirrigated landscapes utilize the moister climates of coastal or mountain areas. This is where most California native landscaping plants come from. Planting these plants in interior valleys, or in the desert, can prove to be difficult. For lists of what native plants work well in your particular vicinity, contact your local Master Gardeners, a group of experts associated with the Cooperative Agricultural Extension programs of the University of California and other land grant colleges. (There are master gardener programs in almost every county in the state.)
<P>To ensure that your California native plants prosper, keep the  nearby soil free of competing plants and mulch with composted wood chips, pine needles, fine gravel or even recycled chunks of asphalt. Mulching provides ideal, moist conditions for healthy micro-organism and macro-organism populations.
<P>Also improve your soil -- including lowering its pH. Plan for shading (which reduces water needs) and plant just before of after the rainy season. Don't forget that there are soil enhancement products that contain up to 100 percent recycled organic material content. The use of compost elevates soil structure, texture and aeration. It also improves moisture regulation and provides slow-release nutrients that feed plants on a constant basis, in contrast to synthetic fertilizers that cause spurts of growth, often increasing the need for pruning, trimming and mowing.
<P>When purchasing mulches and composts as top dressings or soil amendments, always consider products with the highest recycled content.
<P>To maximize waste reduction opportunities, choose plants that fit the available space in order to minimize pruning needs. Always consider the mature size of the plant before making decisions on location. The use of both winter and summer perennials can give year-round color without the cost and waste of replacing annual plants. Installation of perennial ground covers that do not require replacement every year can be an attractive alternative to turf and result in a reduction of green waste.
<P>Beyond careful choosing and proper maintenance of plants, the design and operation of irrigation systems can also help reduce unnecessary excess growth, maintenance requirements and subsequent waste. For example, use of drip irrigation places water next to the plant, enhancing plant health, as well as minimizing weed growth. Less weed growth saves labor costs (and time) and decreases the amount of organic matter in the waste stream.
<P>Other techniques that can be employed as agents of waste prevention include landscape edging, which helps separate one spreading or invasive plant from another. Often these edging materials, whether they be aluminum, steel, wood or other material, have recycled content.
<P>After such purchasing decisions, the biggest factor in pursuing superior xeriscaping is ongoing maintenance. Proper monitoring and maintenance of irrigation systems can help keep turf and plant growth to a manageable level. This translates into less trimming and pruning, and less waste. Techniques such as "grasscycling" -- a fancy word for the practice of leaving clippings on your properly cared for lawn after mowing -- make the best use of available nutrients for the soil.
<P>Remember, whatever waste is generated by your various plant endeavors can be usually be composted or mulched.
<P>Though the practice of xeriscaping was initiated primarily because of concerns over scarce water supplies, it is now being viewed in the broader context of sustainability. Beyond the implications for waste reduction are impacts on reducing energy use. Planting deciduous trees can reduce air conditioner needs in the summer by providing shade to your house, and they can reduce heating needs in the winter by letting the sun through.
<P>The variety of benefits provided by xeriscaping demonstrates how waste prevention activities dovetail with other important public policy and your individual goals.

<CENTER><H2>Worm bins</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to try vermicomposting.</B></CENTER>

<P>Worms have never received much credit for the wonderful work they do. While gardeners have always had deep respect for these creatures, and their ability to keep soil healthy, waste managers now also gaze fondly upon worms.
<P>Green waste, in all of its varied forms -- leaves, lawn clippings, weeds, vegetable food scraps -- is one of the state's most troublesome waste streams. Indeed, some counties will focus almost exclusively on green wastes over the next few years because they have done nearly all they can do to reduce other waste streams. If California's cities and counties are to reach the goal of diverting 50 percent of California's solid waste away from landfills by the turn of the century, then worms will likely need to play a supporting role.
<P>The practice of making compost can be a very labor intensive one. Typically, commercial composting centers are subsidized, often by privately-owned power plant operators who burn wood waste as fuel. Many of these "biomass" electricity generating facilities are closing, threatening much of California's commercial composting industry. These closures are dismantling an infrastructure that will have to be replaced by more on-site, and sometimes unusual, composting activities.
<P>Composting through the use of worms in your own backyard, or school, is a very simple way to turn garbage into a useful product that can help brighten up the flower beds and improve the food output of the vegetable garden.
<P>Worm composting, known as vermicomposting, can easily be integrated into your daily routine. (It is a waste prevention technique because the waste never leaves the premises.) First, you need a worm bin. Most are constructed out of redwood or plywood, but most any scrap wood will do. All you have to do is create a square box or use a store-bought plastic storage box. The bins can be as large as you want them. Some schools have built giant worm homes, as large as 32 square feet! Backyard bins, generally speaking, will be much smaller.
<P>After each meal, separate nonprotein items, such as meat scraps or dairy remnants, from the rest of what's left on your plate. (If you leave this stuff in the mix, odors can get quite unpleasant.) Worms, after all, love fruit and vegetable peelings, coffee grounds, tea bags, crushed egg shells, bread and rice. Add this mixture to a shredded paper bag or newspaper bedding  in the bin. You've started a worm farm.
<P>About once a week, bury the food scraps in the bedding to discourage mold and fruit flies. Another good idea is to bury the worm food in a different corner of the box at each feeding. If the food is not gone the next time you take a peek into the bin, try feeding the worms a little less for a while.
<P>After a few months the original bedding will have disappeared. Instead, you will notice a rich, dark worm compost. That means it's time to put the worms on a diet. Start feeding them only on one side of the bin for a few weeks, so you can scoop up the super soil on the other. Once the super soil is removed, lay down some more bedding, and start the whole process over again.
<P>Many schools now feature worm bins. At Sierra Elementary school in El Dorado County, for example, all food scraps are fed to red worms purchased with aluminum can recycling funds.
<P>Whether at school or at home, relying on worms to develop compost is one of the easiest ways to help keep California clean. Feed them and then just sit back and let the squiggly critters do what they do best!

<CENTER><H2>Tire reuse can be fun</H2>
<B>Goal:  To provide readers with information and ideas on tire reuse.</B></CENTER>

<P>What should we do with the almost 30 million waste tires generated annually by Californians? The answer is simple: reuse them.
<P>Reusing tires is an area where being an environmentally responsible citizen can be fun. Do you want a bird feeder, a swing or even a retaining wall in your yard? Tires are the answer.
<P>Given the consequences associated with not reusing tires, more and more Californians are finding creative ways to reuse a resource that we all utilize. After all, each citizen disposes, on average, about one tire per year.
<P>Though many think of tires as being black, dirty items, and possibly even toxic, when scrubbed and cleaned properly, tires pose no direct threat to soils or to you.
<P>There are two different types of tires and each type is suited for different reuses. Most new tires are steel-belted radials, which are better for basic planters, super intensive gardening structures and retaining walls. Bias-ply tires, on the other hand, do not have steel belts and are essential for projects that require cutting through the tread. These tires are great for projects like bird feeders, lawn and gardening edging, stepping stone forms or swings. You can find bias tires in vacant lots and junk yards, as well as old tire stockpiles.
<P>Of the 29 million tires generated last year, about 18 million were reused, retreaded, recycled or combusted. Those numbers translate to a 62-percent diversion away from the state's crowded landfills. Since 1990, when a law establishing the state's tire reuse program went into effect, the state has increased its rate of recycling and other uses by 28 percent.
<P>These numbers may sound impressive, but tires are among the California Integrated Waste Management Board's (CIWMB) top concerns because of fire and disease hazards associated with stockpiled tires. The CIWMB, therefore, provides grant funding through a competitive program established by the CIWMB every year to find new uses for tires. Past recipients have been individuals, small businesses and nonprofit groups.
<P>Try to take responsibility for your own tires. Here's one quick example of how to use tires to reduce green wastes, another problematic portion of California's diverse waste stream.
<P>Tires can make excellent composters. Get eight firm tires, all the same size. Four will be used for actual composting, the other four for storage. The larger the tire, the more compost they will hold.
<P>Make the center hole of both sides of the tire wider, leaving a 1 1/2 inch border of tire. (Any sabre, jig or reciprocating saw that will accept a universal 1/4-inch shank blade will work; an orbital jigsaw works best.) Be careful when working with tires as balance weights on many tires are made of lead, and these are toxic, so they need to be removed, and worn steel-belted radials have sharp wires that could injure you.
<P>Choose an area convenient to water, near your garden, and  preferably in the sun. Make two stacks of four tires each. When you want to mix and aerate, pull the top tire filled with compost toward you, dumping contents on the ground. Then place this first unit in the new location. Fork the contents into the first unit. Then, pull the second unit off and dump its contents. Continue this sequence until all units are moved to the new location.
<P>If you want to know how to make birdfeeders, swings, retaining walls and other items you can pick up a copy of the book "Tire Recycling is Fun," written and illustrated by Paul Farber. The book can be obtained by writing to the author  at the following address: Re-Tiring, Box 505, Roy, Utah  84067.

<CENTER><H2>Recharge printer toner cartridges</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to reuse toner cartridges.</B></CENTER>

<P>Residents and businesses with laser printers and/or photocopiers know the cost of keeping these machines going can sometimes put a crimp in the budget. Savvy individuals -- and that could include you -- should consider a way to save money and help conserve natural resources. The process is simple: "recharge" the plastic toner cartridges in them.
<P>Those with other printers, and typewriter owners, can save too by "reloading" their ribbon casings.
<P>The more one prints, copies or types, the quicker the toner or ribbon ink is depleted.  The plastic containers or casings, however, are reusable. There is no need to get new containers or casings. Reusing -- instead of replacing them -- is typically very cost-effective. On top of that, recharging and reloading is a simple act of saving the earth's resources.
<P>About half the cost of a new cartridge (or about $60 out of $120) can be saved by refilling an existing cartridge with toner instead of throwing it out and replacing it.  In addition, some companies maintain that their remanufactured cartridges are superior to the originals.  That's because, on the first recharge, they'll replace (for an extra fee, but for less than a new cartridge costs) the drums and rollers with what they consider better components.  The results should be guaranteed. 
<P>There are two ways to recharge empty cartridges, and it's a good idea to check on a company's procedures.  The "drill and fill" method is cheaper, but can cause problems.  A hole is drilled in the cartridge, toner is added, and the hole resealed.  Spillage and other damage can result. 
<P>The preferred way of recharging is to disassemble and inspect the cartridge, clean and lubricate it, then refill, reassemble and test.  According to the American Cartridge Recycling Association, this should NOT result in warranties being voided by printer and copier companies.
<P>Local companies willing to recharge also can be found in the Yellow Pages under "Computers-Supplies & Parts."

<CENTER><H2>State offers free service for firms "trading trash"</H2>
<B>Goal: To provide readers information on <A HREF="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/mrt/calmax/calmax.htm">CALMAX.</A></B></CENTER>

<P>The state of California is providing a free service designed to help citizens and businesses trade their discards -- things that might otherwise end up as "trash."
<P>Why would state government care about your junk? It just so happens there are big dollar savings, and tangible environmental benefits, to promoting trades of discards/trash.
<P>The service works like the classified ads in newspapers and helps people find markets or reusers for materials that were previously discarded. It also helps others find free or inexpensive materials, products, and feedstocks for their business or organizations such as schools or non-profit organizations.  Ultimately, these exchanges of items that were once considered garbage promotes not only resource conservation, but a reduction in solid waste that needs to be disposed.
<P>Dubbed CALMAX, for California Materials Exchange, the program features a
Materials Listings Catalog.  Any business, agency or individual can list in the catalog -- at no cost -- any nonhazardous surplus or otherwise "nonuseful" material that would be destined for the landfill.
<P>Anyone interested in any of the materials listed can call the contact person shown in the ad and work out arrangements for acquiring the material. 
<P>Likewise, anyone who needs or wants any kind of material also can list in the catalog specifically what is being sought.  Exchanges, purchases or donations are again freely negotiated and agreed upon between the interested parties.  Catalogs are available at no charge.
<P>All the listings in the "available" and "wanted" sections are organized under these headings and mentioned again in an abbreviated format in the Regional Listings.  CALMAX has 15 materials categories, including: Construction, Containers, Electronic, Glass, Metal, Plastic, and Wood.  Some materials recently made available include:  florescent light fixtures, used bricks, buckets, champagne bins, a copier, electric bulbs, hay, horse manure, plastic pellets, used cassette tapes, fabric and leather scraps, clay pottery, 3-ring binders, ink, and sales counters.  Wanted items listed were just as diverse: fencing, bleachers, construction and demolition waste, boxes, mosaic tiles, drums, furnishings, an "unusually old water heater," an electrical generator, scrap electronics, paint, flowers for drying, paper, rope, art supplies, lumber, magnets, keys, mannequins and much, much more.
<P>The "Regional Listings" section is divided into 16 subsections: 14 regional areas, one "all of California" section for materials available or wanted within many or all of the regional areas, and an "out-of-state" section. 
<P>If you are not on the CALMAX mailing list, you're probably losing money.  In the first three years of the program, CALMAX saved California businesses over $1.5 million dollars and diverted 232,000 tons of assorted materials from landfills.
<P>Maybe you don't have time to thumb through a 64-page catalog, which could be a great read with your morning coffee.  If not,  try CALMAX On-Line.  If you have a computer and modem, all you have to do is dial (916) 448-0615 from your communications software.  (For questions or assistance, call the Local Government Commission at (916) 448-1198.)  CALMAX covers the entire State of California and is part of the National Materials Exchange Network (NMEN).  All items are listed nationally, unless you request otherwise.
<P>Want to put a free ad in the CALMAX catalog, get on the mailing list or learn more?  Call the California Integrated Waste Management Board at (916) 255-2369 or write the board at 8800 Cal Center Drive, Sacramento, CA 95826.

<CENTER><H2>Waste prevention at work</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to implement waste prevention at work.</B></CENTER>

<P>If every California home followed some waste prevention techniques, the state would still not meet its goal of reducing waste by 50 percent by the year 2000.
<P>That's because 61 percent of the state's 45 million annual tons of waste is produced by businesses. If California is going to respond to the challenge of the state's waste reduction targets, then lots of creative thinking and waste reduction is going to have to be done while on the job.
<P>Luckily, California's entrepreneurial spirit is reflected in innovative programs instituted at a variety of different types of commercial and industrial enterprises. Firms like Mag Instrument, Inc., producer of the Mag-lite flashlight since 1979, have reduced the amount of packaging in its products and reuses packaging received from suppliers.
<P>All corrugated cardboard is baled and recycled, as is the computer paper. They also close the loop by purchasing recycled-content paper products and using recycled products in manufacturing their flashlights.
<P>One of the best ways to understand the benefits of waste prevention is through a little research. In almost every field, there are a few firms that have active waste prevention efforts. Your business may realize economic savings or public relations gains through a new waste prevention program.
<P>One option is to get your company to adopt an environmental policy reflecting how the firm sees itself in relation to the environment, neighbors and the people it employs. Today, more companies are adopting environmental policies. A typical goal is zero waste.
<P>Some of the things to look for when evaluating the benefits of waste prevention are the waste disposal costs you avoid by reducing the company waste stream; the reduction in energy and water utility costs; the reduction in raw materials; the reduction in storage costs; and the reduction in printing and postage costs.
<P>The most effective way to communicate the value of waste prevention is person-to-person communication. Seek volunteers in each work area who are willing to be trained "waste reduction pros." These pros can become friendly sources of waste prevention information and provide ongoing feedback. Train new employees. Let them know they are expected to use resources carefully and fully participate in waste reduction programs. Finally, use all-employee gatherings to promote waste prevention. Show what is being done and what areas need improvement. Document and verify waste reduced and money saved.
<P>For example, Eat Your Vegetables restaurants in Sacramento are now diverting 88% of their waste. The owner chopped his annual waste bill from $4,200 to just $400. These numbers can be useful in showing the environmental and economic benefits of waste prevention.
<P>The first step in a companywide waste prevention campaign is a waste audit or waste assessment. It helps you understand the waste stream and the major areas that need attention. A good  strategy is to pick one area of waste where you can reduce, donate, reuse, recycle or compost. Do one thing at a time and use common sense. The bottom line: follow up and follow through!
<P>After implementing thorough waste prevention techniques, there will typically still be some material that can be recycled. Small businesses often do not generate enough of these recyclables to attract hauling services. But forward-looking entrepreneurs have teamed up with neighbors to form co-ops. Through such partnerships, small businesses may be able to save money by sharing equipment such as balers, sharing space for collection and loading of materials, and collectively generating enough recyclables to make collection profitable for both the hauler and the small business. By sharing these expenses, small businesses are preventing waste while they are recycling.

<CENTER><H2>Don't make the holidays "the haulidays"</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to practice no waste holidays.</B></CENTER>

<P>The days after major holidays are often major hauling days for garbage collection companies. Just picture that monstrous pile of wadded wrapping paper under the tree after Christmas -- not to mention the tree itself -- and you'll know what we're talking about.
<P>Paper already makes up over 30 percent of California's solid waste stream. During the Christmas season alone, the average household will generate between 3 and 10 bags of beyond-the-ordinary trash.
<P>And with California's population topping 30 million people, that's a lot of extra waste and one heck of a "present" for the neighborhood landfill.
<P>It's easy to go overboard with gift wrapping. We all want the gifts we give to look special and exciting -- to give those gifts that personal touch. So we run out and sometimes spend even more on expensive wrapping paper, ribbons and cards than we do on the gift itself.
<P>There is a better way. Try putting more "gift" in your gift wrap. Instead of disposable paper, make the wrapping part of the gift. For example, wrap Mom's blouse in a matching scarf and tie it with a hair ribbon. Or "reverse" wrap by putting the best thing on the outside. Wrap a good paperback in a nice bathrobe, using the belt as a ribbon, then pop a packet of cocoa or a candy cane in the pocket. The book inside gives support to the robe so it feels like a sturdy package.
<P>One rationale for less gift wrap could be financial considerations. For economy's sake, you can plan the cost of the "gift" wrap into your budget for the gift.
<P>If you really want to be a spendthrift, scour the attic or flea markets for old tins, hat boxes, fabric and other containers and materials that will make a unique, funny, or appropriate package for your gift. Wrap a granddaughter's gift in grandma's old lace curtain. The lace can be saved as a family heirloom. Put a check for a college student in an old bank book or an antique encyclopedia.
<P>The ideas are endless. Gifts can be "gift" wrapped in purses, backpacks, tool chests, tablecloths, towels, hats and bread boxes. Almost any reusable container or fabric can be used in this creative way.
<P>No-waste gift wrapping can actually enhance the quality of your gift, showing that you have done something extra special for that special someone. It also shows that you've done something extra for the environment -- and it's a lot of fun in the bargain.
<P>P.S. Don't forget to recycle your Christmas tree.

<CENTER><H2>Holiday "peanuts"</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to reuse or minimize holiday packaging.</B></CENTER>

<P>Free! That may not be a word you'll hear much of this December as the emphasis is usually on spending -- not saving -- money. But believe it or not, some things in life are free, and they can definitely help you to reduce the cost of sending all of those packages to distant family members or relatives and friends. At the same time, you'll be doing your part to help protect the environment.
<P>As one of Santa's helpers, many of you are, no doubt, busy preparing parcels to send. You are most likely scrambling to find packing material. Hopefully, many of you saved items such as corrugated cardboard boxes and "peanuts" from packages of your own so you could reuse them for occasions such as this, making your packaging costs practically "free."  And reusing materials not only saves some dollars, but conserves valuable natural resources.
<P>If you've been asleep at the wheel and don't have packing material of your own, you may want to look into opportunities for free packing materials offered by local businesses.  The Polystyrene Packaging Council of California reports that over a thousand Mail Boxes Etc. franchises all across the country have developed holiday programs to encourage the reuse of loose-fill polystyrene packaging chips, commonly referred to as "peanuts" because of their shape. (Please, don't try to eat them.)
<P>If you have too much packing material, you may want to donate your peanuts so others can reuse. The polystyrene must be clean and uncontaminated to be accepted in the Mail Boxes Etc. reuse programs as well as those established by other firms. Some local firms may also have other packaging material on hand, such as shredded paper or excelsior (wood shavings) and bubble wrap.
<P>Consider checking the Yellow Pages under "Packaging Materials" or "Packing and Crating Services" and make a few phone calls. If the establishment does not have a reuse program, suggest they start one for next holiday season.
<P>Beyond businesses participating in these reuse programs, check with neighbors, co-workers, friends. Many "pack rats," who have saved every box ever sent to them and can no longer get into their garage, would probably be happy to share their wealth. You'll be doing them a favor just as they do a favor for you.
<P>Another packing option is newspaper. Instead of putting that large Sunday paper into the recycling bin for pick-up (or, worse yet, in the garbage) use it as packing material.  You can even use it for gift wrap!
<P>Packaging waste is the single largest component of California's, and the nation's, solid waste stream. Reusing packaging material, therefore, is an extremely important way for you to make sure that the holiday season is not only one of giving and receiving gifts, but marked by a respect for the Earth.

<CENTER><H2>Toward a "greener" Christmas tree</H2>
<B>Goal: To encourage readers to think about Christmas tree use.</B></CENTER>

<P>The Christmas tree: for many Californians, it is the symbol of the holiday season. It comes in many sizes and shapes -- from a table-top trimming to a ceiling-scraping giant, from fir to pine, from live to aluminum.
<P>Regardless of type, the Christmas tree has long been a symbol of joy and glad tidings; gifts seem to grow at its base.
<P>But what happens to this arboreal harbinger of goodwill after all the presents are opened, the feast is finished, and members of the family have each gone their own and separate ways? You may be happy to know that your Christmas tree's useful life doesn't need to come to an end once the ornaments are carefully packed away.
<P>Every year, more than 40,000 tons of Christmas trees require handling at the end of the holiday season in California. Most communities throughout the state are beginning to recognize that the final resting place for cut Christmas trees isn't in the state's burgeoning landfills. A growing awareness of environmental issues, coupled with a mandate to reduce the disposal of still-valuable resources, has convinced growing numbers of  California cities and counties to plan Christmas tree recovery programs that give old Tannenbaum a second life.
<P>The California Integrated Waste Management Act requires local governments to reduce solid waste disposal by 50 percent by the year 2000. New waste prevention and recycling programs are being implemented in almost every California community. Unlike most of these efforts, a Christmas tree recovery program is not a year-round effort. The trees are only collected during a specific time period, ranging from a single day or weekend, to as long as a month.
<P>On top of that, these seasonal programs often involve folks not usually associated with waste management issues. This creates unique challenges and opportunities as local agencies, businesses, special interest groups, and citizens are all brought together in a collective effort to reduce wastes during the holidays.
<P>The potential market for your fading Christmas tree may seem slim, but secondary uses are actually quite plentiful. After chipping and shredding, the trees can be used as: (1) mulch for water conservation and weed control; (2) erosion and/or dust control on hiking trails and bridle paths; (3) additives in composting operations; or (4) alternative fuel in special power generation facilities called "biomass" co-generation facilities.
<P>Some communities have even used whole trees in wildlife habitat restoration projects by piling them around watering holes to provide shelter for birds, or by sinking them into lakes as a haven for small fish.
<P>Local public works programs, such as park maintenance and public building landscaping, may also be able to utilize the trees as a resource. Community gardens are yet another potential market for mulch as well as whole trees, the latter serving as trellises for vining plants such as beans or peas.
<P>The rewards for participating in Christmas tree recovery  programs are varied. One of the most popular drop-off programs in Santa Barbara County in recent years was at a site where each resident received a small cactus for bringing in a tree.
<P>Christmas tree recovery programs are just one part of broader efforts to reduce holiday waste. For instance, one way to prevent waste is to purchase a living Christmas tree or a reusable artificial tree. Either one of these approaches eliminates the need for post-holiday tree waste management. Though many argue there is a direct correlation between consumerism and economic health, a little forethought on the part of holiday shoppers and home entertainers reduces unnecessary waste without adversely impacting the local economy. Gifts of durable goods in sensible packaging, the use of washable plates at parties, and donations of used or unwanted clothes and toys, are all examples of simple holiday waste reduction ideas that provide boons to long-term economic and
environmental health.
<P>Remembering the ethics of reduce, reuse and recycle during traditional times of celebration reinforces a community's waste reduction efforts and helps California meet its resource conservation goals. For more information on waste reduction in your neighborhood, [insert local information].

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>How do unit pricing systems work?</B></FONT>
<P>The term &quotunit pricing&quot does not refer to a particular pricing system, but rather describes any funding system that charges customers according to the amount of waste disposed.  Virtually all current unit pricing systems can be classified by one of the five types described below.  Additionally, minor design elements within each system can be tailored to meet a community's unique solid waste goals.
<P>Below are the strengths and weaknesses of each system.  Note: some incentives to reduce waste and recycle (a strength), as well as potential risk of illegal dumping (a weakness), are common to all.

<FONT SIZE=+3><B>Success stories</B></FONT>
<P>
In the 1980s, only a small number of unit pricing systems were operating in places like Olympia, Washington; Plantation, Florida; and Santa Clara, California.  As of January 1993, unit pricing systems had spread to more than 1,000 communities with the potential to expand to 1,800 communities by early 1994.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P>
 As of November 1993, more than 20 unit pricing systems are in operation in California.

<P>
The current surge of unit pricing systems can be attributed to their proven success records in various communities.  For example:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Lodi, California,</B> population 55,000, started a variable can system in 1993, with a 38-gallon trash cart, 65-gallon recycling cart, and a 95-gallon yard waste cart.  Lodi reports 30.5 percent diversion in 1995.  Diversion was at 10 percent in 1990.

<P>
<LI><B>Santa Monica, California,</B> population 88,000, implemented a variable can garbage rate system in April 1992.  Santa Monica reports a 32 percent decrease in residential tonnage disposal and a 13 percent increase in tons recycled.

<P>
<LI><B>Quincy, Illinois,</B> population 40,000, requires customers to place a payment tag/sticker on each unit of refuse set at the curb.  Quincy reports a 20 percent decrease in disposal tonnage (200 fewer tons per month), and a 50 percent increase in recycling program tonnage.

<LI><B>Capital Regional District, British Columbia (Victoria),</B> includes four &quotcore&quot municipalities (total population 200,000), each of which limits collection of refuse funded through property taxes to 100 liters per week.  Additional refuse must be accompanied by a separate pre-paid garbage tag/sticker.  The Regional District currently diverts 34 percent of its waste stream and is approaching its goal of 50 percent diversion by the year 2000.

<CENTER><H2><I>Frequently Asked Questions About Grasscycling</I></H2></CENTER>

<H3>Does grasscycling cause thatch build-up?  No!</H3>
Research has shown that grass roots are the primary cause of thatch, not grass
clippings.  Thatch is composed mainly of roots, stems, rhizomes, crowns, and
stolons.  These plant materials contain large amounts of lignin (wood) and
decompose slowly.  Grass clippings are approximately 80-85% water with only
small amounts of lignin, and decompose rapidly.  Some grasses such as
bermudagrass and kikuyugrass are more thatch-prone than others. 
<P>
A small amount of thatch (approximately 1/2 inch) is actually beneficial to a
lawn, providing insulation to roots and serving as a mulch to prevent excessive
water evaporation and soil compaction.  It may also create a cushioning effect
for lawn play.

<H3>Does grasscycling spread lawn disease?  No!</H3>
Improper watering and fertilizing are the primary cause of disease spread.  If an
accommodating environment for turfgrass disease is present, infestation will
occur whether clippings are collected or not.

<H3>Will grasscycling make my lawn look bad?  No!</H3>
If a lawn is properly mowed, watered, and fertilized, grasscycling can actually
produce a healthier-looking lawn.  It is important to cut the lawn frequently to
produce small clippings that will fall between the standing blades and
decompose quickly.  However, if a lawn is not cut frequently enough and long
clippings are left on the lawn, it may produce a "hay-like" look which can be
unsightly. 
<P>
Many golf courses and parks have practiced grasscycling for years.  Ninety-
eight percent of the residential participants in a grasscycling study conducted by
Texas A&M reported that they will never bag their clippings again!
<P>
Just remember, grasscycling:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>     Saves time (no more bagging)
<LI>     Saves money (less water and fertilizer are needed, no landfill fees)
<LI>     Encourages a healthier lawn (clippings contain valuable nutrients)
<LI>     Saves energy (mowing time, hauling to the landfill)
<LI>     Saves valuable landfill space!
</UL>

<H3>Are there alternatives to grasscycling?  Yes!</H3>
Grasscycling is not feasible in every situation.  Prolonged wet weather,
mechanical breakdown of mowers, or infrequent mowing are situations where
grass clippings should probably be bagged since an excessive volume of
clippings may be generated.  But do not throw the clippings away! 
<P>
Grass clippings are an excellent addition to a backyard compost pile.  Clippings
can also be used as mulch to provide weed control and prevent moisture loss
around flower beds, trees, and shrubs.  Mulching with clippings should be
avoided, however, if they are of an invasive variety, such as bermudagrass, or
if herbicides have been applied recently to the lawn.

<P>
University studies have shown that the average California lawn generates 300 to
400 pounds of grass clippings per 1000 square feet annually.  This can be as
much as eight tons per acre each year!  Significant quantities of water,
fertilizer, and labor go into producing all those clippings, and it is a shame to
see that all go to waste if the clippings are thrown away.  By practicing
responsible turf management, including "grasscycling," a landscaper can both
reduce those inputs, and at the same time eliminate the waste.
<P>
<H3>WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE TURF MANAGEMENT?</H3>
Responsible turf management refers to installing and maintaining a lawn in an
environmentally sound and cost effective manner.  By doing it right from the
start, turf can be managed with only moderate water and fertilizer requirements,
and the headaches of thatch removal and disease control can also be minimized.
<P>
<H3>INSTALLATION</H3>
By preparing the area correctly before laying turf or seeding, long term
management can be eased significantly.  Make sure that the area has good
drainage, achieved through proper grading and underground conduits.  Avoid
installing turf on berms or severe slopes unless necessary.  Other drought
resistant ground covers might serve the purpose better than turf.  Whether
native soils are sandy or clay, the turf will benefit from the addition and deep
tilling of well composted organic material.  This helps the soil and grass plants
better manage water and nutrients.  Allowing for deep root growth will
contribute to overall turf health and resilience.
<P>
<H3>WATERING</H3>
Turfgrasses vary in their need for water.  Most grasses in California need about
1 inch of water every 5 to 7 days in the growing season and much less during
slow growth months.  Lawns watered too frequently tend to develop shallow
root systems which may make them more susceptible to stress and disease. 
Deep, infrequent watering produces a deeper, extensive root system which
enables turf to resist disease and stress.  Over-watering not only is wasteful, it
also causes lawns to grow faster and require more mowing.   
<P>
It is a good idea to regularly check irrigation systems for even coverage.  A
simple audit can be performed by placing empty containers in a number of
locations around a lawn, and then run the system.  (Empty tuna cans work
great, and are just about two inches deep.)  See if the containers fill evenly,
and how much water is delivered during a regular watering.  Adjust sprinkler
heads to avoid dry or soggy spots.
<P>
The best time to water is early morning, as less water is lost due to
evaporation, and water pressure is at its peak.  Try to avoid watering in the
evening because prolonged damp conditions may encourage disease
development.
<P>
<H3>FERTILIZING</H3>
Proper fertilization is essential in maintaining a healthy lawn.  However, over-
fertilization can weaken a lawn by causing excessive and succulent top growth. 
For moderate, even growth, use a combination of fast acting fertilizers
(ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, or urea) and slow release nitrogen
sources such as sulfur-coated urea, urea formaldehyde, IBDU or organic
fertilizers.  Avoid using large quantities of fast acting fertilizers.  These
fertilizers produce very fast growth for short periods.  
<P>
Check with a local turf specialist to determine the fertilization rates for your
grass type.  Chances are you can get by with less than recommended and still
have a beautiful lawn.  Regardless of the grass type and its fertility needs, as a
general rule, it is better for the lawn, and grasscycling, to apply smaller
quantities of fertilizer more frequently rather than larger amounts less
frequently.
<P>
<H3>WHAT IS "GRASSCYCLING"?</H3>
Grasscycling is the natural practice of leaving clippings on the lawn when
mowing.  It is obvious how this practice can save resources like landfill space,
but there are additional benefits as well.  The clippings quickly decompose,
returning nutrients to the soil.  Grasscycling, in conjunction with the practice of
reducing water and fertilizer inputs, can reduce mowing time in addition to
disposal costs.
<P>
Many people treat their lawns like a "crop:" they (over) water and (over)
fertilize their lawns to encourage excessive growth.  The harvested "crop"
(those grass clippings) is then bagged and transported to a landfill.  What a
waste!  Proper mowing, watering, and fertilizing practices result in more
moderate turf growth yet still produce a healthy, green lawn.  Grasscycling can
be practiced on any healthy lawn as long as responsible turf management
guidelines are followed.  
<P>
The nitrogen contained in grass clippings removed from a lawn almost equals
the recommended application rate for healthy turf (about 5 pounds of nitrogen
per year per 1000 square feet).  While some of this nitrogen is lost through the
decomposition of the clippings, leaving the clippings on the lawn by
grasscycling can have the overall impact of reducing fertilization requirements
by 15 to 25 percent or more.  Similar savings on water use are possible.
<P>
<H3>MOWING</H3>
Proper mowing is required for successful grasscycling.  It is best to cut grass
when the surface is dry (no drops of moisture on the grass), and keep mower
blades sharp.  Follow the "1/3 rule:" mow the lawn often enough so that no
more than 1/3 of the length of the grass blade is removed in any one mowing. 
Proper mowing will produce short clippings that will not cover up the grass
surface.  You may have to cut the lawn more frequently, or double cut, when
the lawn is growing fast, such as in the spring, but much less when the turf is
growing slowly.  Additionally, in many areas of California, raising the mowing
height in the summer encourages deeper roots and protects grass from drought
and heat damage.  <A HREF="wpgras2c.htm">(Check out our chart of recommended mowing heights!)</A>
<P>
You can grasscycle with most any mower.  The mower collection bag can be
removed to allow clippings to drop on the lawn.  However, if your mower does
not have a safety flap covering the opening where the bag fits into the chute, or
a plug for the chute, contact your local retailer to purchase a retrofit kit. A bit
of experimentation might be needed to keep clippings from clumping when
using a conventional mower.  Please be sure not to compromise your mower's
safety systems.  
<P>
Additionally, most lawnmower manufacturers have developed mulching or
recycling mowers which cut grass blades into small pieces and force them into
the turf.  Mulching or recycling mowers make grasscycling easy.  Studies have
shown that seasonal mowing time can be reduced by 50 percent or more since
the bagging and disposal of clippings is eliminated.  Cost savings can even be
realized in hidden ways.  By not handling heavy bags of clippings, back injuries
and other physical maladies can be avoided a real savings on health care costs and workers
compensation!
<P><P>
Clearly there are times when collecting the clippings is necessary, such as when
there are excessive leaves on the turf, or when the grass is too wet.  This guide
will discuss options for managing those clippings by composting later.  In the
meantime, note that several brands of recycling mowers are available in
California to help landscapers grasscycle.  If you are thinking of replacing some
of your mowers soon, seriously consider purchasing mowers with grasscycling
capabilities.

</OL>

<A NAME="01"></A>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>1. What are California's waste reduction and disposal goals?
</B></FONT>

<P>
California has established aggressive solid waste reduction
goals to conserve both natural resources and landfill capacity.
Cities and counties are responsible for planning and implementing
programs to reduce waste disposal by 25 percent by this year (1995) and
50 percent by the year 2000.

<P>The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) is the
agency responsible for overseeing the development programs designed
to meet these goals. Indications are that most communities are
meeting the 25 percent challenge, some are even exceeding it. However,
additional effort will be required to cut California's waste in
half.

<P><A NAME="02"></A>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>2. How is California going to meet these goals, and what
role does &quot;vermicomposting&quot; play?</FONT></B>

<P>
Every community has developed a game plan to get there. Most
have implemented a variety programs to reduce waste. These include
waste prevention efforts like home composting, as well as recycling
activities, such as curbside collection from homes and processing
waste from businesses.<BR>

<P>
In all, California generates nearly 40 million tons of waste each
year. In order to meet the goals, large quantities of organic
waste, which accounts for more than half of garbage, will need
to be recovered and processed. This can be done by conventional
composting operations, fuel production, and in some cases vermicomposting-or
composting with the assistance of worms. Presently, however, worms
are playing a very small role in California's waste management
programs.

<P><A NAME="03"></A>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>3. What have been the traditional uses for worms and the
traditional markets for the worm industry?</FONT></B>

<P>
Worms have been raised in California for decades. In fact,
California Food and Agriculture law defines vermiculture, or worm
farming, as a form of agriculture. Additionally, there are many
different types of worms raised and used for various purposes.

<P>
Traditionally worms have been raised for fishing bait as well
as a protein source for various products, including animal food
and cosmetics. Worms have also been used to manage agricultural
wastes, such as dairy manure, since they convert waste into a
nutrient rich soil product called &quot;castings&quot;.

<P><A NAME="04"></A>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>4. Vermicomposting is currently not regulated as a solid
waste facility in CA. Should it be?</FONT></B>

<P>
Vermicomposting, a form of vermiculture, is currently defined
as an agricultural activity. According to the California Dept
of Food and Agriculture, worms can be considered livestock, much
as cows are in a ranching or dairy operation. Within reason, certain
organic wastes can be viewed as feed.

<P>
Under new California solid waste laws, vermicomposting is considered
&quot;excluded&quot; from regulation as a conventional composting
facility, which are defined as solid waste facilities. However,
an &quot;exclusion&quot; recognizes that a given activity is involved
in solid waste handling and therefore must comply with fundamental
health and safety codes.

<P>
If a worm operation becomes a nuisance, for instance by taking
in more waste than can be effectively fed to and processed by
the worms, it could be viewed that the activity has crossed the
line and become a solid waste facility. Concerns about a particular
circumstance should be directed to community's environmental health
department.<P>

<P>
California's waste reduction laws have created a real opportunity
for innovation, which is encouraged. However, with innovation
comes uncertainty, and emerging technologies need to be scrutinized
for feasibility.

<P>
Some entrepreneurs are experimenting with using certain types
of worms to process municipal organic waste into soil products.
This usually requires some degree of processing or composting
of the organic wastes into a form suitable to be used as worm
food. The products of these operations, the worm castings, may
fill niche markets within the soil amendment industry.

<P><A NAME="05"></A>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>5. What are the ideal uses for worms?</FONT></B>

<P>
That is hard to say. From a waste management perspective, the
CIWMB has encouraged residents to help prevent waste and manage
their own organic discards by composting at home, including using
worm boxes for food residue. This simple technology can provide
a rich soil amendment while reducing waste at the point of generation,
thus reducing collection and management costs. The CIWMB also
recognizes that worms may be playing some role in creating higher
end soil products along with conventional composting methods.

<P><A NAME="06"></A>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>6. What are the prospects for the worm industry to solve
California's solid waste disposal problem, and are there enough
worms to do it?</FONT></B>

<P>
First of all, no one is specifically asking for worms to solve
California's solid waste problems. Additionally, most organic
waste is not in a form that can readily be fed to worms. Composting
is required first, and once material is composted, it may be marketed
as is. So it's not a matter of the worms themselves solving the
State's solid waste concerns. However, if a policy was established
today that called for all of California's organic wastes to be
processed by worms, then there may not be enough worms today,
but no such policy is anticipated.

<P>Even so, consider the following thoughts on the supply of worms:
worm research shows that the reproductive capacity of some worms
is substantial if provided ideal conditions. Some worm types used
for composting may be able to reproduce up to six times a year.
Using a simple doubling of worm populations every two months,
worm farmers could quickly saturate the market if an official
call for worms was issued.<HR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
This table demonstrates basic arithmetical doubling of a one ton population every two months and shows that in just over four years the worms would multiply
into more tons than the 40 million tons of waste Californians
generate annually.</FONT>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="07"></A>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>7. If someone has more questions about vermicomposting,
where do they go from here?</FONT></B>

<P>
Individuals interested in pursuing more information on vermicomposting
or vermiculture, as well as worm and soil market realities, should
contact an existing worm farm, soil blender, or organic waste
processor to discuss the present and future possibilities of worm
enterprises. The CIWMB maintains an informal <A HREF="WRMLIST1.HTM">list of worm suppliers</A>
for the purpose of informing people where worms can be procured.

<P>
We will be starting an office paper recycling program to recover (list types of paper to be recovered).  The program will take only a few minutes of your time each week and will require only minor changes in your work habits.  Your participation in this program is necessary for its success.<P>

At the orientation session on (date of session) at (time) in (location), (program coordinator's name) will explain the details of the program to you and provide you with containers for storing the paper to be recycled.  By taking an active part in this program, you will help accomplish our goals of reducing waste and conserving valuable natural resources not only for our department but for our community as well.  Waste paper (white ledger and computer paper, colored paper, newspaper, paper bags, paper board, and cardboard packaging) makes up as much as 41 percent of our nation's solid waste.  One ton of recovered paper saves over three cubic yards of landfill space.  Besides helping conserve landfill space, our program will help conserve natural resources.<P>

You will receive a desktop container for your daily recyclable paper.  Once your desktop container is full, please empty it in the centrally located metal white and red intermediate container. <P>  

Thank you in advance for your participation in this worthwhile endeavor.  If your have questions or would like to assist in the program, call (program coordinator) at extension (XXXX).

<H3><LEFT><B>Groundwood Paper Dilemma</B></LEFT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+6>T</FONT>he State of California wants its agencies to recycle as much scrap material as possible and increase the purchase of recycled content products.  However, these goals conflict when State agencies buy recycled content paper containing "groundwood".  Recent purchases of groundwood computer paper have contaminated many loads of high-grade white recycle paper.  

<P>Like newsprint, groundwood is a low-cost printing and writing paper made from wood fiber that is mechanically ground to a pulp in water.  In contrast, groundwood free paper is more expensive because it is made from wood chips cooked with chemicals in a high pressure vat.  The result is a longer, stronger, brighter fiber used in high grade (groundwood free) paper.  A disadvantage of groundwood free paper is a 50% lower yield of paper per ton of tree fiber processed.
     
<P>Although groundwood paper has a lower purchase price, it causes problems later in its life cycle.  It does not have archival qualities, contaminates high-grade paper, and is much lower in value if sold for recycling.  When recycled, groundwood paper often goes into products that are used once and thrown away.  If paper market prices are low, groundwood paper may be landfilled when recyclers won't take it without charge.  Conversely, groundwood paper is a good choice for short-lived products such as newspapers, magazines, and catalogs that are easily kept separate from office paper.  In a July 1995 report, the U.S. Department of Energy concluded that using groundwood free recycled content printing and writing paper at its Washington, D.C. headquarters has less environmental impact and is much lower in life cycle cost.          

<P>Groundwood paper is soft, bulky, opaque, light beige to white in color, and looks similar to newsprint but may be thicker and heavier.  It cannot be recycled as computer printout, white ledger, colored ledger, sorted office paper, or newspaper.  If your office has a mixed paper program, put groundwood paper in a mixed paper recycle bin.  If not, put groundwood paper in the trash.  When in doubt, throw it out!

<H3><LEFT><B>Project Recycle Approves State Recycling Programs</B></LEFT></H3>
<FONT SIZE=+6>P</FONT>ublic Contract Code Section 12165 (d) states that "no individual, group of individuals, state office, agency, or its employees shall establish a ...(recycling)... collection program or enter into agreement for a ...(recycling)...program unless approved by the board (Integrated Waste Management Board)."  To signify that a State facility has a Board approved recycling program, Project Recycle now issues certificates to those facilities.  To date, Project Recycle has issued 1,044 approval certificates.  As new State facility recycling programs are approved, they will receive an approval certificate from Project Recycle.

<P>If your State office or facility has not received a certificate, please contact the Project Recycle staff person assigned to your geographic area or facility type.  If you are not certain who that is, please call (916) 255-2385 for assistance.

<FONT SIZE=+6>T</FONT>he Stephen P. Teale Data Center (TDC) is a State entity that provides data processing services to over 200 public sector organizations, the majority of which are also State entities.  Teale’s offerings include a wide range of information technology services, from meeting scientific and engineering requirements to high volume on-line interactive systems and batch processing.  Services include hardware and software support for large mainframe systems, a statewide telecommunications network, and specialized services such as Supercomputer and Geographic Information services.
 
<P>Diana Correa, TDC’s Recycle Coordinator, reports that TDC recycles approximately <B>9,000 pounds</B> per month of confidential records via DGS’ Document Destruction Center.  DGS shreds, bales, and sells the paper for recycling.

<P>TDC also collects newspapers, magazines, glass and plastic beverage containers which are given to the Sacramento Local Conservation Corps (SLCC).  SLCC also collects 30-50 bags/month of computer paper and pin-feed strips generated at the Job Handling Unit.  In addition, TDC’s Holiday Food Drive Committee collects aluminum cans.  This effort generates money for a food drive and diverts approximately 400 - 600 pounds/year of aluminum from landfills.  Other items collected at TDC include corrugated cardboard, laser printer cartridges, rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries and large lead-acid batteries used with TDC’s "Uninterruptable Power System".

<P>Diana adds, "everyone can and should participate in Project Recycle on a daily basis.  Before you leave work each day, check your waste-basket.  Have you tossed any white paper, computer paper, newspaper, magazines or soda cans?  By taking a few minutes to recycle these items properly, you can make a difference in the Recycling Program and leave the earth in better condition for future generations."

<H3><LEFT><B>New So. Cal Recycling Contract</B></LEFT></H3>
<FONT SIZE=+6>O</FONT>n July 1, 1996 Project Recycle contracted with Safeshred Certified Document Destruction to collect and purchase non-confidential records and scrap paper from 14 State buildings in Los Angeles and Orange Counties.  Departments covered include Corporations, Employment Development, General Services (DGS),  Highway Patrol, Toxic Substances Control, and Transportation.  Also included is the Air Resources Board, California Museum of Science and Industry, and Water Resources Control Board.  Building occupancies range from 1,750 at DGS’ Ronald Reagan Building to 100 at the CA Museum of Science of Industry for a total of 5,600.

<P>The contract covers several scrap paper grades:  computer printout, white ledger, colored ledger, mixed waste paper, corrugated cardboard, old newspapers, and book stock.  The contractor paid Project Recycle a <B>$7,000</B> advance fee for the right to collect non-confidential scrap paper from these buildings for two years.  The advance fee contract greatly reduces haggling with a contract recycler over weights and paper grades.  It also increases the recycler’s incentive to maximize scrap paper collection from State facilities.  In cooperation with CIWMB, the new contractor is improving paper recycling at these buildings by increasing bulk storage capacity and conducting recycling kick off events at many of the buildings.

<H3><LEFT><B>Recycling at Porterville Developmental Center</B></LEFT></H3>
<P>by Mitch Fee
<P><FONT SIZE=+6>T</FONT>he Porterville Developmental Center (PDC) first tried to start a recycling program in late 1990.  We wanted to collect paper products (corrugated cardboard, newspaper and office paper) and market them to community recycling vendors. However, we soon discovered no one would collect the paper in rural Tulare County. 

<P>Not until 1991, when Ila Lewis of the CIWMB contacted us about Project Recycle, did our efforts begin to pay off.  With active support of PDC management and CIWMB, we began to collect all of our office scrap paper (both white and colored ledger), computer printout paper, newsprint, corrugated cardboard, glass, tin cans, aluminum cans, plastic bottles, misc. metals and milk cartons from all around PDC.  Clients at PDC became an essential part of our recycling efforts when we paid them to shred all confidential material, sort white from colored ledger paper and collect and transport recyclables to a central storage area.  Lewis also arranged for Corcoran State Prison (CSP) to haul away all of 
our recyclables and process them at CSP.  This unique relationship between PDC and CSP continues today.

<P>Recently, PDC began collecting and recycling items from the nearby community.  We pick up corrugated cardboard (OCC) at over 25 different schools and companies in Porterville. We helped a local high school club earn money by setting up collection bins for OCC.  We also shred over 25 tons per quarter of bank records from various branches of the Bank of Sierra in Tulare County.  With CIWMB approval, we contracted with the Employment Development Department’s Porterville office to shred all of their records.  All of this paper is recycled. 

<P>In 1992, we processed over 10 tons per quarter of various materials.  Now, we average in excess of <B>65 tons per quarter</B> that no longer go to our local landfill.  We employ over <B>100</B> of our clients in our recycling program.  PDC offers pick-up and shredding of confidential documents for businesses and offices in Tulare County.  The average fee is about 11 cents/pound.  PDC does an excellent job and meets State requirements for State employee witnessed confidential document destruction.

<FONT SIZE=+6>T</FONT>he National Office Paper Recycling Project can provide your leased office building with 20" X 30" recycling promotional posters.  The posters are free of charge for the first five and $25 per dozen after that.  The posters show a beautiful forest with the message: "Recycling Won’t Make You Rich Or Get You Promoted, But Look At The Benefits."  In addition to the posters, the National Office Paper Recycling Project can provide an Office Paper Recycling Guide, an Office Recycling Guide for Building Managers, and 1" X 2" stickers with the message:  "I’m recycling at work.  Make it your business."  To order the above materials, ask your building manager to telephone (202) 223-3088.  The National Office Paper Recycling Project is a collaborative effort of public and private sector leaders to establish an office recycling ethic in merica.                                                             <CENTER><IMG SRC="recycle.gif"></CENTER><BR>

<H3><LEFT><B>Sticky Stamps Gum Up Paper Recycling</B></LEFT></H3>
<FONT SIZE=+6>P</FONT>roject Recycle receives many questions from State facility staff about what should be done with revenuehose easy-to-use self-adhesive stamps could pose a problem for paper recycling programs.  The glue on the back of the stamps isn’t 100 percent water soluble.  When the stamps are pulped with scrap paper, clumps of glue can gum up expensive paper making equipment and cause tiny holes in recycled paper products.  To fix this problem, the post office is working with a laboratory to develop totally benign adhesives.  The best remedy for paper recycling programs may be to discourage collection of stamped envelopes entirely.

<P>More and more self-adhesive stamps are being used.  In 1994, only 2.4 billion peel-and-stick stamps were sold by the U.S. Postal Sevice.  This year that number is expected to top 30 billion - more than half the 50 billion stamps that will be sold.  By the turn of the century, some 90 percent of all stamps are expected to be self-adhesive.

<H3><LEFT><B>Waste Paper Prices Hit Ten Year Low</B></LEFT></H3>
<FONT SIZE=+6>A</FONT>ccording to a U.S. Department of Labor report, the price of high grade "pulp substitutes" and "deinking" recovered paper grades hit a ten-year low of $61.70/ton in April 1996.  This "Producer Price Index" is pegged to a December 1986 base price of $100/ton.  It does not adjust for inflation, which means the April 1996 price of $61.70/ton would be much lower if adjusted for inflation since 1986.  The previous monthly low on the index was $86.70/ton in November 1993, and the high was $184.50/ton in May 1995.  Reasons for the precipitous decline since May 1995 include: reduced economic activity, decreased overseas demand, and low prices for virgin pulp.  Recent reports indicate the export market for waste paper is improving.  However, commodity markets are difficult to predict because they are global and complex. 

<P>High grade recovered paper often found in offices includes computer printout, white ledger, and colored ledger.  "Pulp Substitutes" is a general classification of recovered paper grades that can be used directly in paper manufacture without cleaning, bleaching, or deinking.  Example: envelope cuttings free from printing which are produced in the manufacture of envelopes.  "Deinking" is a process for removing most of the ink, varying amounts of the filler and most of the remaining extraneous materials from printed recovered paper.  Example:  postconsumer printed white ledger (bond) paper.

DGS cannot offer cartridges under the terms and conditions of this contract that meet the high expectations of  ITEC’s customers.  Many users have experienced problems with defective cartridges.  Defective cartridges received from Landmark Laser may be returned to Landmark Laser for a refund or replacement. 

<P>DGS hopes to let a new LTC contract within 90 days.  The new contract will be awarded to several vendors.  If there are problems with one vendor, another can be used.  We hope your department will not be discouraged by this contract cancellation, but will continue to recycle and purchase remanufactured LTCs when a new contract is awarded.  This is an emerging industry which promises to save the State money and conserve natural resources.

<FONT SIZE=+6>W</FONT>hat San Francisco Bay Area 104-acre facility has 12 streets named after different bird species, is occupied by 350 people primarily engaged in hydraulic, civil, and structural engineering research, but also has over four million books, dozens of buildings, rents office/laboratory space to ten or twelve private companies, and hosts many conferences and meetings?  It's a fascinating place with a great recycling program.  A $620 disposal fee per 40-cubic yard bin of solid waste is one incentive to recycle.  A greater concern is the adverse consequence of a hazardous material spill on the porous soil.  It could quickly drain into San Francisco Bay.

<P>Nearly 136 tons of recyclable materials were collected during the year ending June 30, 1995.  Paper grades included computer printout (2.5%), white ledger (22.5%), corrugated cardboard (7.4%), newspapers (10.6%), telephone directories (0.9%), and magazines (0.2%).  After adding aluminum, glass, and plastic beverage containers (0.5%), the list gets more interesting.  It includes vehicle batteries (0.3%), used motor oil (0.6%), wood pallets (1.6%), miscellaneous metals (4.4%), and wood waste (48.7%).  Most of the wood waste was from demolition of obsolete structures at the facility.

<P>What is this place and why does it have so many books?  It's the University of California Berkeley, Richmond Field Station.  Growing at a rate of 250,000 books annually, it's also the University of California's northern California repository for rare and overflow library books.  Scott E.

<FONT SIZE=+6>P</FONT>roject Recycle receives many questions from State facility staff about what should be done with revenue received from the sale of recyclables.  Although information on this subject is summarized in some Project Recycle letters and memos, the applicable law is cited below.

<P>Public Contract Code 12167. "Revenues received from this plan [the Recycling Plan developed with the Dept. of General Services] or any other activity involving the collection and sale of recyclable materials in state and legislative offices located in state-owned and state-leased buildings, such as the sale of waste materials through recycling programs operated by the CIWMB or in agreement with the board, shall be deposited in the Integrated Waste Management (IWM) Account in the IWM Fund and are hereby continuously appropriated to the board, without regard to fiscal years, until June 30, 1994, for the purposes of offsetting recycling program costs.  On and after July 1, 1994, the funds in the IWM Account may be expended by the board, only upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the purpose of offsetting recycling program costs."

<P>This revenue provision of PCC 12167 does not apply to: (1) employee property such as used beverage containers collected in non-State bins, (2) quasi-autonomous State entities as described in SAM 4802, and (3) State agencies with written Board approval to retain recyclables revenue (usually institutions such as colleges, prisons, and developmental centers).

<LEFT><H3>Steel Can Recycling</H3></LEFT>
Nearly 16 million California residents have the opportunity to recycle steel cans through curbside, drop-off, and buyback programs.  In addition, steel from old cars, appliances, and construction materials is recycled through other channels and programs.  Despite these efforts, one large source of steel often landfilled and in need of recycling improvement is #10  steel cans generated by the food service industry.  The Steel Recycling Institute (SRI) is working with recycling coordinators, government officials, independent recyclers, scrap processors and others to collect #10 steel cans.  Rather than send them to a  landfill, these cans should end up at a de-tinner, foundry, or steel mill for recycling. 
<P>
To improve recycling of steel cans, SRI provides information on waste audits, recycling instruction, recycler information, case studies, marketing information, and contracts.  SRI has information on many successful steel can recycling operations at:  hospitals, correctional facilities, schools, military bases, as well as general foodservice establishments.   For information and assistance from SRI, contact Betsey Meyer at:

<H4>Quarterly Recycle Pro:  Tomasa Manlove</H4>

This quarter's Recycle Pro is Tomasa "Tommie" Manlove at EDD, Riverside.  Tommie began her job in Technical Services and immediately faced a recycling challenge;  the recycler servicing her office for over 3 years was suddenly unable to continue collecting recyclables due to trucks continuously breaking down.  Tommie accepted the challenge of finding a new, reliable recycler.  Like a detective pursuing leads, Tommie first contacted a recycling company that was recommended to her by the previous recycler.  This company could not help because her 40-employee office had an insufficient volume of materials.   Tommie did not give up.  She used the telephone book to call recyclers, but for the same reason still didn't have any luck.  However, when turned down by a recycler, she would ask for referrals.  
<P>
Finally, when someone suggested the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), she found a recycler that was willing, able, and prepared to help her.  She contacted Scoutmaster James Secrist at Troop #216 in the neighboring town of Redlands.  They did indeed offer free recycling services.  This nonprofit group uses the proceeds from recycling to fund uniforms, camping trips, and other BSA-related needs.  As the scoutmaster shared several success stories, Tommie got the feeling that this might be the way to go to keep their recycling program alive.  "I could see he was enthusiastic and wanted to help us," Tommie relates.  She contacted Project Recycle in Sacramento for rules and approval and was referred to its Southern California representative, Suzanne Gandy.  Suzanne advised Tommie of the options she had for the types of containers to use.  Mr. Secrist agreed to pick up all the recyclables on a weekly basis and provide Suzanne with a quarterly report on the amounts recycled.  EDD chose a bag system that Tommie likes because, "they seem to hold more and are flexible for Mr. Secrist to handle quickly, quietly and easily."  <P>
The six 20-gallon steel cans EDD had been using for recycling were old and dinged up.  They might have been scrapped, but it turns out the scouts could use them to help sort recyclables.   Suzanne got Project Recycle's okay to donate them to the troop for that purpose.
<P>
Project Recycle would like to salute Tommie for taking all the steps necessary to revitalize her office recycling program!  Tommie related, "because of the positive effect on our environment, recycling as much as possible will always be important to me."

<DT><LEFT><H3>Caltrans' Reuse and Recycling Program</H3></LEFT></DT>
by Raymond Tsztoo,  P.E.<BR>
Caltrans, State and Local Project Development Program
<P>
Conserving and reusing natural resources has always been important to the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).  The concepts of reduce, reuse, and recycle are incorporated into the design, planning, construction, and maintenance of the State's impressive highway system.  Recycling, energy conservation, and waste reduction are all  programs which have become an important element in Caltrans' way of doing business. Conserving resources not only saves valuable raw resources, but can also save tax dollars while not contributing further to the problem of diminishing landfills.
<P>
<H4>Hardware Recycle Program</H4>
Construction projects on existing highways often involve removing or disturbing existing facilities to accommodate new construction. For example, highway widening, realignment, or safety improvements could dislocate lights, signs, guardrails, fencing, etc.  While many of the items removed are obsolete, the majority conform to current standards and have 10 to 50 years of useful life remaining.  Caltrans' recycle program strives to utilize these reusable materials in cost effective applications. Reusing suitable removed items (defined as "reconstruct") within the same project is highly desirable as opposed to removing, disposing, and providing new materials for installation due to the cost savings.  Other removed items with adequate remaining service life are salvaged and stockpiled at a central storage facility or a district recycle center for use on future construction projects. A computer supported inventory management system maintains records of salvaged materials statewide.  This system also produces a database for designers that identifies salvaged items available for construction and maintenance work.  Salvaged items include sign posts and spacer blocks (wood, metal, and laminated); overhead sign structures; flared end sections (concrete and metal); drainage inlet frames, grates, and covers; manhole frames, covers, and adjustment rings; chain link fence fabric; wood and metal posts; gates; metal beam guard railing; metal beam barriers; lighting standards and high pressure sodium lights; and traffic controllers.
<P>
The largest volume hardware item that is reused, salvaged, and reconstructed is metal beam guard railing (MBGR).  For the 1994 fiscal year, Caltrans salvaged <B>41,341 feet of MBGR</B>, reconstructed <B>199,813 feet of MBGR</B>, and reinstalled from salvage<B> 656 feet of MBGR</B>.  The hardware recycle program continues to provide Caltrans with an available source of reusable materials that can be "State-furnished" on many projects.  In this way, Caltrans material recycle program strives to reduce construction and maintenance costs by taking advantage of the full service life of highway hardware through salvaging and reinstallation.
<P>
<H4>Recycled Materials in Pavement Sections</H4>
Caltrans has been working with recycled materials in pavement sections for many years.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) may soon require states to either use asphalt paving materials containing crumb rubber and other recycled materials or be subjected to reduced funding penalties.  Therefore, Caltrans  is striving to meet these requirements mandated by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA).  The use of rubberized and recycled asphalt concrete is selected for project locations on a case by case basis.  State design engineers and planners used <B>68,894 tons</B> of recycled asphalt concrete and<B> 71,098 tons</B> of rubberized asphalt concrete on State highways in 1994.  These last two figures do not include what is produced by local agencies.   Caltrans' Office of Local Programs is receiving preliminary reports from California's local agencies indicating that they are approaching the 25 precent level for recycled materials. 
<P>   
The use of reclaimed materials such as slag and glass in subbase and base are not being documented by Caltrans at this time.  There are no project specifications requiring any percentage level of recycled or reclaimed materials to be used.  Specifications, do however, allow for the inclusion of those reclaimed or recycled materials into the structural section provided that all State design criteria and standards are met.  Economics drive the use of reclaimed or recycled materials.   A good example of reclaiming material is the ongoing Cypress Freeway reconstruction.  The 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake destroyed a large portion of an elevated double-deck concrete freeway structure in Oakland.  The collapsed concrete structure demolition yielded a large amount of concrete rubble.  This rubble is being processed into usable base material.   Some of the economic factors which made this possible are (1) new construction work is close to the demolition site, (2) no disposal for concrete will be required, (3) new aggregate will not need to be purchased, and (4) concrete source was large enough to feasibly utilize a rock crusher. When it is in the contractor's best economic interest, they will use reclaimed or recycled material. 
<P>
Other  materials made from recycled materials are being used on the State's freeways.  Recycled glass beads are used extensively in thermoplastic and painted traffic striping and pavement marking to reflectorize traffic stripes and pavement markings.  Recycled plastics have also been used for soundwall noise barriers at two locations and these soundwalls meet all normal design criteria including those for deflecting sound and structural integrity.
<P>
<H4>Other Miscellaneous Programs  </H4>
Caltrans has a recycling program for paper, glass bottles, aluminum cans, etc.   Purchased paper has a minimum percentage of recycled-paper content.  Caltrans' Division of Maintenance has a program of using re-refined automotive lubricants such as motor oil, power steering,  and transmission fluids for its trucks, snow plows, earth moving equipment, and other vehicles.
<P>

<H1>About the <BR>
Recycled-Content Product Database</H1>
This is your link to the California Integrated Waste Management Board's Recycled-Content Product (RCP) Database.
<P>
The RCP Database has information on RCPs as well as manufacturers, distributors, reprocessors, mills, and converters who procure or produce these products or the recycled materials needed to make them.  The result is a growing list of over 10,000 materials, products, and businesses.  The creation and maintenance of this data is a crucial part of the Board's strategy to bolster and stimulate the RCP market.
<P>
The quantity and variety of recycled-content products grows daily.  The RCP Database does not include all recycled-content products that are available or even all of the distributors of the products listed, but it's a good starting place.

<P>
Each of us influence which products are supplied to the market.  We do it every day by our choices of what  products we demand.  And the best way to get the attention of those suppliers is through the specification and procurement process.  Every time we buy any product, the supplier of that product gets immediate feedback.  There's no question about whether their product was marketable or not.  The only question is how many other consumers also bought their product?  When a sufficient number of consumers start demanding products that contain minimum percentages of postconsumer content, you will then have the undivided attention of that supplier.  That supplier wants to keep your business and will find a manufacturer that will be able to meet your specifications.  Procurement specifications should also be reviewed to ensure that unnecessary requirements that have nothing to do with product performance are not included.

<A NAME="Guidelines for Purchasing RCPs">Guidelines for Purchasing RCPs</A>
</H3>
<P>
We encourage you to keep the following guidelines in mind when considering your purchase:
<OL>
<LI><B>Is the product readily available?</B> <BR>By "readily available" we mean: Will the product get to you in time to be of use to you?  Many times you know in advance what your procurement needs are.  You don't wait until you are out of the product before you order it.  Sometimes it takes longer to get a product with a certain amount of postconsumer content in it.  If, by adjusting the lead time, you can get the specified product in plenty of time for its intended use, it is usually worth the extra effort.  However, if the product is not readily available or it is urgently needed because of unforeseen circumstances, you must purchase whatever product is available to fulfill your immediate needs.
<P>
<LI><B>Has the product been commercially demonstrated?</B> <BR>This is important in order to establish that the product is reliable and safe and has predictable performance characteristics under actual commercial conditions.  A product that hasn't been commercially demonstrated is an unknown factor.  It is our experience that consumers are hesitant to use products that have only recently become commercially available.  When considering your product purchases, stay within your comfort zone.  But, through education and training, strive to expand that comfort zone to include new products.
<P>
<LI><B>Is the product cost-competitive?</B> <BR>There are a number of recycled-content products currently on the market that are cost-competitive.  For other products it is not as simple as comparing up front costs.  Some RCPs have lower maintenance and replacement costs than their virgin counterparts.  To accurately compare these you must consider the life cycle costs of both and then make your decision accordingly.  You will find that sometimes recycled-content products are more expensive than similar products made from virgin material.  Each day the infrastructure to reduce the costs of manufacturing recycled-content products gets better.  It gets back to supply and demand.  If we keep demanding products that meet our specifications, manufacturers will make them and distributors will supply them.
</OL>
<P>
We hope the RCP Database will increase your knowledge of the recycled-content product possibilities and your awareness of where you might purchase many of these products.

</H3>
<P>
The RCP Database is structured to help you find products quickly and easily.  Pull-down menus help you find just the right product to fit your needs.  The database is a national listing, but you can narrow your search by state if you prefer.  Within California you can further narrow your search by county.  Each time you access the database you will be limited to printing a maximum of five companies that meet your search criteria.  The companies are accessed randomly so that if you use the database on successive days you may receive five different companies that meet the same search criteria.   You cannot copy the database, and electronic extracts are not possible because of copyright considerations.
<P>
<B>Type of Business</B>
<P>
This pull-down menu lists five categories:
<OL>
<LI><B>Distributor</B>: Sells a finished product.
<P>
<LI><B>Converter</B>: Adds value to a recycled material by sorting, cleaning, baling, chipping, etc.
<P>
<LI><B>Manufacturer</B>: Makes a finished product.
<P>
<LI><B>Reprocessor</B>: Changes the form of a recycled material so that it can be used in the manufacturing process (pellets, flakes, etc.).
<P>
<LI><B>Mill</B>: Makes an interim product (bolts of cloth, rolls of paper, etc.).
</OL>
<P>
The default selection is "Distributor."  If you want any of the other four choices, put the pointer on the arrow to the right of "Distributor" and click the left button on the mouse once.  Then put the pointer on one of the other choices and click the left button on the mouse once to select it.
<P>
<B>Recycled-Content Product List</B>
<P>
This pull-down menu is a listing of all of the recycled-content products in alphabetical order.  In addition to the recycled-content products, parentheses indicate the materials that the product was manufactured from.  You make your selection from this menu by putting the pointer on the arrow next to the window and click the left button on the mouse once.  Then put the pointer on your product choice and click the left button on the mouse once to select it.
<P>
<B>Total Recycled Content</B>
<P>
This window shows the minimum percentage of total recycled content you are looking for in your product.  The total recycled content of the product includes material recycled at the manufacturing site.  This is not a pull-down menu so you must enter the percentage you are looking for (20, 30, 40, etc.).  To enter a percentage, put the pointer in the box and click the left mouse button once.  Then type the percentage you desire.  You do not need to add the percent sign or specify the percentage as a decimal portion (i.e., type 20 rather than 0.20).
<P>
<B>Postconsumer Content</B>
<P>
This window shows the minimum percentage of postconsumer content you are looking for in your product.  The postconsumer content is the amount of material that has been recycled after the product has been used by a consumer for its intended purpose. This is not a pull-down menu so you must enter the percentage you are looking for (20, 30, 40, etc.).  To enter a percentage put the pointer in the box and click the left mouse button once.  Then type the percentage you desire.
<P>
<B>State/County</B>
<P>
This pull-down menu is a listing of the states and protectorates of the United States.  The default selection is "All States."  You can choose any state or protectorate by putting the pointer on the arrow next to the window and click the left button on the mouse once.  Then put the pointer on the state or protectorate you want to search and click the left button on the mouse once to select it.  To select California you can either follow the above procedure or go directly to the "Search in California only" button at the bottom left corner of the page.
<P>
If your search is limited to California you can also search by county.  The county pull-down menu replaces the state menu.  The default selection is "All Counties."  You can choose any California county, listed alphabetically, by putting the pointer on the arrow next to the window and click the left button on the mouse once.  Then put the pointer on the county you want to search and click the left button on the mouse once to select it.
<P>
<B>Search/Reset Buttons</B>
<P>
The RCP Database is now ready to search its records for any businesses that meet your criteria.
<P>
There are two buttons at the bottom of the screen:
<OL>
<LI><B>Search</B> - If you are happy with your criteria, put the pointer on this button and click the left button on the mouse once to search the database.
<P>
<LI><B>Reset</B> - If you would like to change all of your criteria, put the pointer on this button and click the left button on the mouse once.  All of the search criteria windows will be set to their default settings.  It may be easier to reselect individual criteria if you want to change only one or two.
</OL>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Once you have clicked on the "Search" button, the RCP Database searches for businesses that meet your criteria and displays up to five for you.  You can print the search results by moving the pointer to the word "File" at the top left of the page.  While pointing at "File" click the left button on the mouse once.  Another pull-down menu will be shown.  Point to the "Print Frame" selection and click the left mouse button once.  A "Print Screen" will come up with options for print range, print quality, and setup options.  Under normal circumstances you don't need to adjust any of these settings.  Just point to "OK" and click the left button on the mouse once.  Your search results should be printed at your printer.
<P>
<B>Changing Criteria for a New Search</B>
<P>
If you want to refine or change your search criteria in any way, click on the right button on the mouse once and continue to hold it down and select "Back" to go back to the "Product Selection" screen.  From this screen you can choose your search criteria again.  At any time during your use of the RCP Database, you can click on the right button on the mouse once and continue to hold it down and select "Back" to go back one frame or "Forward" to go forward one frame.  If either "Back" or "Forward" are dim, then that selection is not available.

  <B>II. Supply of Postconsumer Recovered Paper</B>
</H3>
<P>
<I>Potential</I> lack of postconsumer recovered paper supply to meet
demand-particularly for office papers and OCC-is one of the most pressing
concerns facing the paper recycling industry today. This is a rather novel
situation, because only a few years ago the primary concern about paper recycling
was lack of adequate demand for the paper that was being recovered!
<P>
Postconsumer recovered paper shortages have yet to materialize, except during
the "panic buying" of mid-1995. Furthermore, today's market prices, which
are extremely low, do not suggest any shortage of postconsumer recovered
paper supply. Yet there is no question that growth in paper recycling capacity
the past few years has significantly outpaced growth in paper recovery, and
recycling capacity continues to grow at a quick pace (both domestically and
in foreign countries). Without correspondent growth in paper recovery, it
is conceivable that recovered paper shortages could develop before the turn
of the century.
<P>
While California has a well-developed paper collection infrastructure, the
state's "supply" of postconsumer paper-in contrast to the amount of postconsumer
paper generated- is surprisingly low. In 1995, California only recovered
about 4.5&nbsp;million of the nearly 13.4 million tons of postconsumer paper
generated in the state, equivalent to a 33.25 percent "utilization" (recovery)
rate. This means that over 8.8 million tons of postconsumer paper were disposed.
Most of the paper that was disposed was recyclable paper, although approximately
10 percent was-as always-not recyclable, such as toilet paper, paper towels,
fast food packaging, etc.
<P>
The California Integrated Waste Management Board (the Board) annually calculates
a recovery rate for postconsumer paper generated in California, an in so
doing determines the available supply of recovered paper during a given year.
In addition to calculating an annual recovery rate for overall postconsumer
paper generated in California, the Board also calculates recovery rates for
postconsumer OCC, ONP, and "all other" paper. As with calculating the overall
postconsumer paper recovery rate, calculating the recovery rates for OCC,
ONP, and all other paper involves estimating the available supply of those
paper grades. For postconsumer OCC in 1995, the Board estimated that 2,520,643
tons were recovered out of the 4,865,273 tons generated, equivalent to a
51.8 percent recovery rate. For postconsumer ONP in 1995, the Board estimated
that 1,398,620 tons were recovered out of the 2,384,539 tons generated,
equivalent to a 58.7 percent recovery rate. For all other paper, the Board
estimated that in 1995, only 513,658 tons were recovered out of the 6,102,553
tons generated, equivalent to a low 8.4 percent recovery rate.
<P>
The Board has yet to determine a way to calculate the supply of and recovery
rate for recovered office paper. Such figures would be extremely useful,
as office paper is clearly the paper grade in shortest supply relative to
demand in the U.S. and worldwide.
<P>
It is difficult to evaluate California's paper recovery rates relative to
the rest of the country, due to the lack of annually updated recovery rates
for other states and the U.S. The American Forest and Paper Association
(AF&amp;PA) annually determines postconsumer recovered paper "utilization
rates" for U.S. paper mills, but these rates are different than recovery
rates because they do not take into account the amount of paper that is generated
<I>overall</I>, including that which comes from outside the country (such
as corrugated packaging).
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency publishes postconsumer paper recovery
data for the U.S. each year; the latest figures are for 1994. The 1994 recovery
rate for total postconsumer paper was 35.3&nbsp;percent; for OCC was 55.3
percent; and for ONP was 45.3 percent. The corresponding 1994 California
estimated recovery rates were as follows: total postconsumer paper = 31.4
percent; OCC = 45.7 percent; and ONP = 53.2 percent. Judging by the EPA figures,
in 1994 California was moderately below the national average for total paper
recovery, even further below the national average for OCC recovery, and
considerably <I>above</I> the national average for ONP recovery.
<P>
Most of California's postconsumer recovered paper originates in the commercial
sector. In 1994, an estimated 2.64 million tons of the postconsumer paper
recovered in California, or 65.4&nbsp;percent, originated in the commercial
(and industrial) sector; about 1.4 million tons, or 34.6 percent, originated
in the residential sector. The predominance of commercial paper recovery
in California is typical for the entire country: a 1994 study performed by
Franklin Associates for Keep America Beautiful estimated that 68&nbsp;percent
of U.S. paper recovery originated in the commercial sector, while 32 percent
originated in the residential sector.
<P>
While the Board annually estimates <I>statewide</I> postconsumer recovered
paper supply and recovery rates, there is presently no mechanism to quantify-on
a statewide basis-<I>local and regional</I> postconsumer recovered paper
supply.
<P>
This is extremely unfortunate, because local and regional supply information
is critical for manufacturers to assess the feasibility of constructing new
paper recycling facilities in California.
<P>
The most "current" local postconsumer recovered paper supply information
available for <I>all</I> jurisdictions is for 1990. This data is stored in
the Board's "interim database," a compilation of all the waste characterization
data provided in the "source reduction and recycling elements" (SRRE) submitted
by local jurisdictions as part of the reporting requirements mandated by
AB 939. The data that will update the SRREs for the year 1995 will not contain
the same type of detailed recovery information as did the 1990 SRREs, so
the Board will be unable to update local postconsumer recovered paper supply
data on a statewide basis.
<P>
Postconsumer recovered paper supply data means very little by itself-it takes
on its real meaning when compared and contrasted with demand data. The next
section addresses demand for California's recovered postconsumer paper in
the near term.

  <B>III. Demand for California Postconsumer Recovered Paper</B>
</H3>
<P>
Demand for postconsumer paper recovered in California originates primarily
from three sources: overseas paper mills, California paper mills, and
out-of-state domestic paper mills. While current figures are unavailable,
a study performed for the Board between 1992-1994 estimated that 1990 demand
for California postconsumer recovered paper was characterized as follows:
<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>
    California Paper Mills: 47.6%
  <LI>
    Foreign Exports: 40.6%
  <LI>
    Domestic (out-of-state)
  <LI>
    Paper Mills: 11.8%<BR>
</UL>
<P>
A small percentage of demand for California postconsumer recovered
paper-primarily ONP-is also provided by producers of products other than
paper, such as cellulose insulation, hydromulch, and wallboard.
<P>
It is almost a certainty that the percentage figures for domestic (out-of-state)
paper mill demand has grown since 1990, while consumption at California paper
mills has likely declined. A number of new paper recycling operations in
Oregon and Washington have started up since 1990, and many of those operations
draw considerable amounts of paper from California. Furthermore, there has
been little expansion in the capacity of California's paper recycling mills.
In fact, it has been over ten years since a new paper recycling mill was
built in California. Foreign exports in 1995 represented approximately 43
percent of the demand for California postconsumer recovered paper, a 5.9
percent increase over 1990.
<P>
Source of demand for California postconsumer recovered paper vary considerably
by grade. For example, most OCC recovered in California is consumed by in-state
paper recycling mills, due to the large number of recycled paperboard mills
in the state, which rely on OCC as their primary feedstock. In contrast,
most of the office paper recovered in the state is exported, due to the lack
of high-grade deinking facilities in California. (In fact, the only high-grade
deinking facility in California-at Simpson Paper Company's paper mill in
Pomona, was idle as of April 1996.)
<P>
As mentioned in the previous section on supply, one of the greatest concerns
in the paper recycling industry is that the supply of postconsumer recovered
paper will not be adequate to meet new demand from both domestic and foreign
sources. This concern is based on the proliferation of new recycling projects
in recent years. For example, in 1995 alone, five new "high-grade deinking"
(HGD) facilities came online in the U.S., increasing HGD capacity from 1.5
million tons/yr. to 2.1&nbsp;million tons/yr. Six additional HGD facilities
are scheduled to be completed by the end of 1996, which would increase total
U.S. HGD capacity to approximately 3&nbsp;million tons/yr.
<P>
Demand for OCC has also grown at an astounding rate the past couple of years,
and is projected to continue to grow significantly through the year 1997,
due to recently constructed or proposed OCC recycling projects in the U.S.
In 1994, U.S. OCC consumption was approximately 14.54 million tons. Between
1995 and the year 1997, an additional 3.72 million tons of OCC recycling
capacity were either added or scheduled to be added, which would ultimately
increase U.S. OCC recycling capacity by over 25 percent.
<P>
Most new U.S. paper recycling facilities have been or will be constructed
outside of the western U.S. In fact, of total U.S. paper recycling capacity
added since 1990, and of capacity projected to be added by the year 2000,
the west accounts for only 17.4 percent. When recent and projected Canadian
paper recycling capacity is added to U.S. capacity, the western U.S. accounts
for only 14.1&nbsp;percent of the total.
<P>
In spite of the fact that little new paper recycling capacity will originate
in the west, California still benefits from new demand outside the region.
As domestic demand for postconsumer recovered paper increases, it eases
competition on foreign markets, which theoretically should lead to higher
export prices for postconsumer recovered paper. Also, as more paper recycling
capacity is built in the midwest, it increases demand for California postconsumer
recovered paper by paper recycling mills in the Pacific northwest, since
Pacific northwest mills "draw" postconsumer recovered paper from the midwest
and new midwest mills will provide competition for that paper.
<P>
Postconsumer recovered paper demand from foreign markets-particularly Asia
and Mexico-is projected to grow significantly through the year 2000. Such
growth in demand will certainly benefit California, which, as previously
noted, relies on foreign markets to consume approximately 43 percent of its
postconsumer recovered paper. One country that presently does not provide
much demand for California postconsumer recovered paper, but which could
potentially provide a considerable amount, is mainland China. As this country
becomes "industrialized", their requirements for paper products will grow.
Since China-like most countries in Pacific Asia-is timber poor, they will
have to rely heavily on the U.S. and Europe to provide them with postconsumer
recovered paper to produce new paper products.
<P>
In summary, demand for postconsumer recovered paper both domestically and
overseas has grown significantly over the past few years. Domestic demand
is projected to continue growing over the next few years, but at a slower
rate than over the past few years. Foreign demand, however, is projected
to continue growing at its current rate into the year 2000. California will
benefit from growth in both sources of demand, but particularly from the
foreign demand. The big question is how well California can respond to the
new demand by boosting its recovery of postconsumer paper.

  <B>IV. Primary Barriers to Increasing Postconsumer Recovered Paper Supply</B>
</H3>
<P>
<B>OCC</B>
<P>
Before serious efforts can be made to increase OCC recovery in California,
it must be recognized that there is considerable room for growth in OCC
recovery-growth which can be achieved economically for both generators and
collectors. This report maintains that such room for OCC recovery growth
does indeed exist, and can be achieved economically. This statement is based
on the Board's finding that 1995 California postconsumer OCC recovery was
only 51.8 percent and that there are several businesses in California profitably
collecting OCC from small businesses-the source of most the unrecovered supply.
<P>
A fundamental barrier to increasing OCC recovery is the misperception that
OCC recovery is at or near its peak, and that any incremental growth in recovery
will cost more than disposal. This misperception is largely based on claims
by the American Forest and Paper Association that, nationwide, 70 percent
of OCC was recovered in 1995. However, this recovery rate is well above the
Board-determined California rate (51.8 percent), for two reasons:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>
    It includes preconsumer scrap (trim from box-making plants), which represents
    an estimated 10.8 percent of recovered OCC.<BR>
  <LI>
    It assumes that the amount of new corrugated packaging (cardboard boxes used
    to package products, new cardboard boxes and unconverted linerboard and medium)
    that is exported equals the amount of new corrugated packaging that is imported.
    <BR>
</UL>
<P>
If preconsumer scrap is removed from AF&amp;PA's OCC recovery rate, the rate
falls to 63 percent. However, that still leaves open to dispute AF&amp;PA's
assumption that exports of new corrugated packaging equals imports. This
report contends that, at least in California, net imports of new corrugated
packaging far and away exceed net exports, and thus California has a much
greater amount of OCC generated than AF&amp;PA's national figures would suggest.
Higher generation equates to a lower recovery rate, recovery being equal.
<P>
One barrier to increasing the supply of OCC looms large above the others:
the<I> difficulty in capturing OCC generated by small businesses</I>. Most
large generators of OCC, such as supermarkets and department stores, already
have OCC collection programs in place that recover nearly all the OCC generated.
Yet despite this fact, the recovery rate for OCC in California in 1995 was
still barely above 50&nbsp;percent. It follows, then, that most unrecovered
OCC is generated by small businesses.
<P>
Why is the recovery of OCC from small businesses so low? The answers are
numerous, but the primary reason is <I>poor collection economics</I>. The
unit cost (hourly worker wage, vehicle operation, etc.) of collecting OCC
from a small business is the same as for a large business, but the amount
of OCC generated by small businesses is much smaller. Thus, there is a much
higher cost:revenue ratio for collecting OCC from small businesses than from
large ones, and less financial incentive for collectors to service such
businesses. In fact, most collectors that do collect OCC from small businesses
have to charge a fee for such service, as the collection costs exceed material
revenues.
<P>
The fee that collectors have to charge small businesses to collect OCC is
typically much less than the fee that those businesses pay for refuse disposal,
but collectors are often hesitant to charge a fee for collection due to the
association of fee-charging and solid waste collection. While collecting
source-separated paper is not a state-regulated activity, collecting solid
waste is, involving permits, fees, and reporting requirements.
<P>
Courts are still deciding what constitutes solid waste collection versus
source-separated recyclables collection, but presently the act of charging
a fee for collection appears to separate the two.
<P>
If the source-separated materials that a businesses collects are designated
as solid waste, the business is subject not only to state regulation, but
may even be precluded from collecting the material by local solid waste
collection franchises.
<P>
Another barrier to charging small businesses a fee to collect OCC is that
many businesses can not benefit from reduced refuse disposal fees because
such a fee is built into their building rent or lease fee. Without the incentive
of reduced disposal costs, few small businesses are willing to incur additional
costs to have their OCC collected for recycling.
<P>
One factor that makes collecting OCC recovery from small businesses so difficult
is <I>lack of storage space</I>. Collection of OCC typically requires at
least a 1 cu.yd. storage bin, and more realistically a 3-cu-yd bin ("dumpster").
However, many small businesses lack the space to keep an extra dumpster behind
their establishment, and storing OCC inside in a smaller bin creates additional
labor for a collector, further reducing the cost:revenue ratio for collecting
OCC.
<P>
<I>Low recovery of OCC generated in the residential sector</I> is still another
barrier to increasing OCC supply. In 1995, 39&nbsp;percent of the residential
curbside recycling programs in California did <I>not</I> collect OCC.
Furthermore, those programs that did collect OCC did not recover a significant
percentage of what was generated. In 1995, only 82,668 tons of the 2,520,643
tons of OCC recovered statewide were recovered through California's curbside
recycling programs, or about 2.6 percent of total OCC recovered. Yet the
residential sector accounts for about 10 percent of the OCC <I>generated</I>,
according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and up to 30 percent
in some communities.<BR>
<P>
<B>Office Papers</B>
<P>
Without a doubt, increasing the supply of office papers is one of the most-if
not the most-pressing issues for the U.S. paper recycling industry today.
Explosive growth in office paper "deinking" facilities in the U.S. over the
past five years has created unprecedented demand for recovered office papers.
However, the supply of such papers has not increased at such a rapid pace.
<P>
Five years ago, only a few deinking facilities existed in the U.S. By the
end of 1995, however, there were about 27 U.S. deinking facilities, including
7 independent facilities (i.e., those not integrated with a paper mill) producing
"deinked market pulp." The emergence of the new facilities has dramatically
increased demand for office papers, creating some concern that there will
not be adequate supply of office papers to meet demand.
<P>
The number one barrier to increasing the supply of office papers is the
<I>inherent difficulties in collecting paper from multi-tenant office
buildings</I>. A great deal of paper is generated by businesses in multi-tenant
office buildings, yet only a small percentage of such buildings have in-house
paper recovery programs. (A substantial amount of office paper <I>is</I>
recovered at material recovery facilities from mixed refuse generated by
multi-tenant office buildings located in large-city business districts; however,
it is difficult to estimate the prevalence and effectiveness of such recovery
efforts.)
<P>
The main difficulty with recovering office papers from multi-tenant office
buildings is that individual offices typically do not generate enough paper
to make it worthwhile for a paper collector to service each office; therefore,
<I>some coordination between offices is necessary to make a collection program
practical</I>. The coordination of a paper recovery program in a multi-tenant
office building typically requires the effort of a building manager, who
has a "voice of authority" and maintains contact with each business in the
building. Unfortunately, building managers have many competing responsibilities,
and coordinating a paper recovery program is not often a high priority, even
when desired by some of the businesses in a multi-tenant building.
<P>
Another barrier to increasing the supply of office papers is the difficulty
in capturing office papers generated by small businesses in <I>detached</I>
buildings. While such businesses do not generate nearly the tonnage of office
papers that larger businesses and businesses in multi-tenant buildings do,
they still are a significant source of unrecovered office papers. The
difficulties in recovering office papers from small businesses in detached
buildings is the same as for recovering OCC from small businesses, with poor
economics of collection topping the list. <BR>
<P>
<B>Mixed Paper</B>
<P>
The primary barriers to increasing the supply of mixed paper are:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Consistently low market value.
  <LI>
    Poor recovery rates in existing curbside recycling programs.
</UL>
<P>
Mixed paper is recovered primarily in the residential sector; thus, the greatest
barriers to increasing mixed paper supply are barriers to increasing residential
recovery. While mixed paper can also be recovered in offices, offices typically
sort out their high-grade papers (computer print-out, white ledger, and other
office-type papers) from low-grade papers (magazines, phone directories,
newspapers, etc.) that, together, would constitute mixed paper. The low-grade
papers generated in offices are typically disposed, due to their low monetary
value and space constraints to store them for office paper recycling programs.
<P>
The low value of mixed paper serves as a barrier for municipalities to add
the material to their curbside recycling programs. Typically, the value of
mixed paper is lower than the cost of collecting and processing the material.
While factoring in avoided disposal costs generally gives mixed paper recovery
a positive value, municipalities have traditionally <I>not</I> used avoided
disposal costs in deliberating whether or not to add a new material to their
curbside recycling programs.
<P>
Market price for mixed paper shot up considerably during the latter half
of 1994 and the early part of 1995, spurring a number of California
municipalities to add mixed paper to their curbside recycling programs. During
1995, the number of California curbside recycling programs collecting mixed
paper increased from 149 (in 1994) to 250, and the amount of recovered mixed
paper increased from 114,375 tons to 175,514 tons.
<P>
In spite of tremendous growth in the number of California curbside recycling
programs that collect mixed paper, the recovery rate for mixed paper via
these programs was relatively small. Although mixed paper represented about
20 percent of all paper recovered in California curbside programs in 1995,
it represented considerably more than 20 percent of recyclable paper
<I>generated</I> in California residences. According to U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency data for 1993, mixed paper represented 43 percent of recyclable
paper generated in U.S. residences. <BR>
<P>
<B>ONP</B>
<P>
Before any discussion about increasing ONP supply begins, it should be stated
that postconsumer ONP recovery (supply) is presently very high in California:
an estimated 58.7 percent in 1995. This recovery rate compares favorably
with the rate for the entire U.S., which was estimated to be only 45.3 percent
in 1994 and was projected to reach only between 55-65 percent by the year
2000. Nonetheless, achieving an ONP recovery rate higher than 58.7 percent
is certainly realistic, and this section addresses the barriers to achieving
that higher rate.
<P>
The greatest barrier to increasing ONP supply could well be <I>poor ONP recovery
in curbside recycling programs</I>. Most ONP is generated in the residential
sector: 85% by U.S. EPA estimates. California has a tremendously strong curbside
recycling infrastructure, with nearly all major cities providing such service.
Yet, in 1995, curbside programs accounted for only 43 percent of ONP recovery
in California. While it is understandable that a large percentage of ONP
generated in the residential sector is recovered through means other than
curbside recycling-such as school paper drives and buy-back centers-one would
still expect curbside programs to account for well more than 43&nbsp;percent
of ONP recovery.
<P>
Another barrier to increasing ONP supply is the <I>poor economics of recovering
the material from the commercial sector</I>. Even in office buildings that
have well-developed office paper collection programs, ONP is typically not
collected because of its relatively low volume and low market value. While
only an estimated 15 percent of ONP is generated in the commercial sector,
if as much as two thirds of that amount is not recovered-a likely scenario-
then that would account for the disposal of at least 10 percent of all ONP
generated. Clearly, opportunity exists in the commercial sector to increase
the overall ONP recovery rate.

  <B>V. Strategies to Overcome Barriers to Increasing</B>
</H3>
<P>
<B>OCC</B>
<P>
The first step that the Board could take to overcome barriers to increasing
OCC supply is educating municipal recycling coordinators that there is still
considerable OCC to be recovered- primarily that generated by small
businesses-and that there may be a pending OCC shortage.
<P>
The Board's next step could be determining precisely what types of small
businesses are generating the majority of unrecovered OCC, and to devise
strategies to capture that material. Some studies have already been conducted
that identify key areas of the commercial sector for targeting OCC recovery;
one such study identifies shopping malls, school systems, constructions sites,
and convention centers as key OCC generators, and describes approaches used
to recover the OCC. The Board could compile the information in these studies,
draw conclusions, and publish a guidebook to assist municipal recycling
coordinators develop small scale commercial OCC recovery programs.
<P>
In an effort to improve the economics of collecting OCC from small businesses,
the Board could explore the feasibility of nearby businesses combining their
OCC supplies to make it possible for a collector to pick up the material
for free or to pay the businesses for it. This concept is similar to the
practice of "cooperative marketing" in which rural communities combine their
relatively small quantities of recovered recyclables to maximize their market
price. It is likely that some small businesses are already participating
in some kind of cooperative OCC collection, most likely in business parks
or shopping centers. The Board could document such efforts, and promote them
to small businesses through its Business Waste Prevention and Recycling
Assistance Kit ("Business Assistance Kit"), distributed by the Business Education
Assistance Section in the Waste Prevention and Market Development Division.
<P>
To provide incentive for more collectors to service small businesses, the
Board could take a more active role in resolving the dispute over whether
or not charging a fee to collect source-separated recyclables is tantamount
to collecting solid waste. While this is a very politically and legally loaded
issue, no entity is in a better position than the Board to aid with the
resolution of the dispute, and it is certainly in the Board's interest to
do so if such resolution leads to greater diversion of OCC and other materials
from the state's landfills.
<P>
The fact that many small businesses can not benefit from reduced disposal
costs (resulting from increased OCC recovery) due to the inclusion of refuse
disposal costs in lease or rent payments is a difficult barrier to overcome.
However, there are likely cases where a small business has influenced their
building manager to pass on disposal cost savings, or has revised their lease
or rent agreement to exclude refuse disposal costs so that they could benefit
from reduced disposal. The Board could search for such cases, learn from
them, and assemble a fact sheet describing those cases. The Board could then
make the fact sheet available as part of its Business Assistance Kit to encourage
small business owners to work with their building managers to pass on refuse
disposal cost savings resulting from increased OCC recycling.
<P>
One step the Board could take to help overcome the <I>space limitations</I>
barrier that small businesses face in recovering OCC would be to identify
small businesses that have creatively overcome their space limitations. The
Board could then develop a fact sheet highlighting these creative approaches
and make the fact sheet available as part of its Business Assistance Kit
to encourage small business owners to establish space for OCC recycling.
<P>
To increase the amount of OCC recovered from the residential sector, the
Board could develop a campaign to encourage local curbside recycling programs
to add OCC (as well as mixed paper). A central theme of such as campaign
would be potential <I>avoided disposal costs</I> that municipalities could
achieve by adding OCC to curbside recycling programs. Potential avoided disposal
costs could be projected using the Board's Curbside Collection Cost Model,
developed by the Board's Policy and Analysis Office. Additionally, such a
campaign could spotlight curbside recycling programs that added OCC with
little additional cost or labor, but which benefitted by increased revenues
and landfill diversion.<BR>
<P>
<B>Office Papers</B>
<P>
The first step to increase the supply of recovered office papers is to spread
the message that there may be a potential shortage of recovered office paper
and that recovery efforts need to be increased. The Board held three public
workshops between January and March, 1996, focussing on market opportunities
and program options to increase paper recovery; much of the focus of these
workshops was on increasing recovery of <I>office papers</I>. The target
audience for these workshops was local government recycling coordinators
and officials, whom the Board is relying on to work with their local business
communities to increase office paper recovery.
<P>
Board staff plans to compile the primary messages from the three paper recovery
workshops into a document that will be promoted to local government recycling
coordinators, as well as to paper collectors, refuse haulers, and private
consultants. This document will reach a much larger audience than did the
workshops, and hopefully will help increase awareness of the <I>need</I>
to increase office paper recovery, as well as provide practical information
on <I>how</I> to increase recovery.
<P>
Not only does the Board need to promote <I>new</I> office paper recovery
programs, but it needs to emphasize the need to "revitalize" <I>existing</I>
programs through promotional campaigns and perhaps evaluating how recovery
can be improved through different collection methods (such as switching to
a sorted office paper grade from white ledger/colored ledger only). The National
Office Paper Recycling Project is presently focussing on revitalizing existing
office paper recovery programs, and the Board could possibly adapt some of
the materials that the Project is developing for the Board's use. The Board's
Business Assistance Kit would be an excellent tool for distributing the
customized materials.
<P>
One critical area that the Board needs to address to increase office paper
recovery is how to work with building managers to facilitate office paper
recycling programs. The important role that building managers play in developing
such programs was emphasized repeatedly at the Board's paper recovery workshops.
A simple item that the Board could develop is a fact sheet on how private
businesses, refuse haulers, and recycling coordinators can all work with
building managers to set up office paper recycling programs. The fact sheet
could be distributed through the Board's Business Assistance Kits.
<P>
Another approach that the Board could take to involve more building managers
in setting up office paper collection programs is to work with the local
chapters of the California Building Owners and Managers Association (CalBOMA)
to educate their members about how office paper recycling programs can reduce
their disposal costs as well as achieve the Board's goal of increasing paper
recovery. The National Office Paper Recycling Project (NOPRP) recently published
a recycling guidebook for building managers that would make an excellent
instructional tool. The Board has already obtained NOPRP''s permission to
reproduce the guidebook.
<P>
The Board could also help CalBOMA set up a comprehensive program for its
members who want to set up office paper recycling programs in their buildings,
in which one or more paper collectors are contracted by CalBOMA to provide
collection service to its members. BOMA of British Columbia has such a
comprehensive program, and the increase in paper recovery attributed to the
program is reportedly phenomenal.
<P>
Another important step the Board could take to increase office paper recovery
is to develop a "How To Start a Paper Collection Business" guide to encourage
establishment of new paper collections businesses. There is currently great
interest on the part of entrepreneurs to start up office paper collection
businesses, but presently the Board has no resource to specifically assist
these individuals. Preparation of a "How To Start a Paper Collection Business"
guide would go a long way toward increasing supply of office papers. <BR>
<P>
<B>Mixed Paper</B>
<P>
While there is nothing the Board can do to directly overcome the barrier
of consistently low market prices for mixed paper, through efforts to increase
<I>demand</I>-and therefore increase market prices-for mixed paper (as well
as for sorted grades), the Board can improve the economics of collecting
mixed paper.
<P>
An immediate step the Board could take to increase mixed paper
<I>recovery</I> is to encourage more municipalities to include mixed paper
in their curbside recycling programs. As with OCC, the key to influencing
municipalities to add mixed paper is to promote potential <I>avoided disposal
costs</I> that would be achieved by collecting mixed paper. As suggested
in the section for OCC, above, the Board could encourage addition of mixed
paper to curbside recycling programs through a campaign that integrates the
Board's Curbside Recycling Collection Cost Model.
<P>
To increase mixed paper recovery in curbside recycling programs already
collecting mixed paper, the Board could promote unit-based disposal fee systems.
Unit-based disposal fee systems, commonly known as "variable can rates",
have been demonstrated to significantly increase recovery of all materials
in curbside recycling programs. The Board has already developed a series
of documents to assist municipalities implement unit-based disposal fee systems,
yet few municipalities have adopted such systems. The Board could more
aggressively promote its unit-based disposal fee documents to municipal solid
waste officials in an effort to boost recovery of mixed paper and other
recyclables generated in the residential sector.<BR>
<P>
<B>ONP</B>
<P>
Since the greatest barrier to increasing ONP supply appears to be low ONP
recovery in curbside recycling programs, then the best way to overcome that
barrier is to try to increase recovery in curbside programs. Operation and
promotion of curbside recycling programs is primarily the purview of local
governments, but there are some actions the Board could take to help local
governments identify means to increase ONP (and other materials) recovery
from their curbside programs. One action would be for the Board to promote
unit-based disposal fee systems, as discussed in the preceding section on
mixed paper.
<P>
Another action the Board could pursue to increase ONP recovery is to provide
municipalities with information about which curbside program collection methods
(i.e., three-bin sort or one-bin commingled) yield the greatest volumes of
marketable ONP.
<P>
As mentioned in the previous section on office papers, the Board recently
conducted two paper recovery workshops, and one of the topics addressed was
the costs and benefits of recovering paper source-separated or commingled
in curbside recycling programs. The Board plans to compile the conclusions
from the workshops and provide this information to local recycling officials
to help them choose the collection method that will yield the greatest recovery
of ONP and other materials.
<P>
Any efforts by the Board that lead to an increase in <I>demand</I> for OCC
will lead to higher market prices for the material, thus improving economics
of collecting OCC from small businesses. However, there is very little that
the Board can do directly to help improve the economics of collection.
Additionally, the Board could review other studies of the most effective
ONP collection methods, compile the information, and make it available to
local recycling officials.
<P>
Regarding the barrier of poor economics of ONP recovery from the commercial
sector, the Board could help educate businesses about the options available
to them to include ONP in their office paper collection programs. Even though
ONP is not a desirable material for office paper collectors, it generally
does not require much additional effort for collectors to include the material
in an existing program. Businesses that generate a large amount of high-grade
office paper are in a good position to require that their paper collector
also collect ONP; if the collector refuses, there may be other service providers
that would be willing to collect ONP if they were also are able to collect
the high-grade paper.

<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  <B>VI. Primary Barriers to Increasing Postconsumer Recovered Paper Demand</B>
</H3>
<P>
<B>OCC</B>
<P>
The primary barrier to increasing demand for OCC, ironically, appears to
be <I>uncertainty that OCC recovery (nationwide) can increase significantly
over current levels</I>. As stated previously in Section IV, the American
Forest and Paper Association (AF&amp;PA) claims that 1995 OCC recovery in
the U.S. reached 70&nbsp;percent. However, AF&amp;PA projections (made in
1993) for OCC recovery in the year 2000 ranged up to only 69 percent. Projected
"economically feasible maximum recovery rates" have been exceeded time and
time again over the years. However, without assurances that the necessary
supply of OCC will be available as feedstock, paper recycling companies have
grown hesitant to commit to building new OCC-consuming mills.
<P>
Concern that OCC supply will be insufficient to meet demand is largely due
to the fact that so much new demand has emerged over the past few years.
Over 1 million tons of new OCC recycling capacity came online in the U.S.
during 1995, and about 700,000 tons is scheduled to be added during 1996.
While U.S. OCC recovery increased by approximately 1.47 million tons in 1995
compared with 1994, such significant growth in recovery is not expected to
continue, and much of the additional recovered OCC will be exported.
<P>
A second barrier to increasing OCC demand is the lack of reliable, current
<I>local and regional</I> OCC recovery data for California. One of the very
first types of information that paper manufacturers seek when considering
building an OCC-consuming paper mills is the available and potential supply
of feedstock. If good supply information is not available, manufacturers
are much more hesitant to commit to building a recycling mill.
<P>
As mentioned in Section II, the last detailed local waste characterization
studies (including recovery data) performed on a statewide basis addressed
the year 1990. Recycling has grown tremendously since then, so the 1990 data
is not reliable enough to base a multi-million dollar recycling facility
on. Some municipalities have elected to update their 1990 waste characterization
studies on their own; these municipalities have an edge in recruiting
recycling-based manufacturers such as companies that produce recycled paper.
However, recycling mills draw postconsumer recovered paper from a wide
region-some from throughout the state and beyond-so <I>regional</I> postconsumer
recovered paper data is really what is needed. Up-to-date regional postconsumer
recovered paper data is especially rare, because it requires that most the
jurisdictions within the region have current data.
<P>
A third barrier to increasing demand for OCC-at least at the time of
publication-is the sluggishness in industrial demand for containerboard.
Because of generally low consumer goods demand and production, production
of containerboard (paperboard used to make cardboard boxes) to ship goods
declined significantly during the latter half of 1995, and consequently demand
for OCC also declined. Through April 1996, domestic consumer goods production
had yet to recover to the point that containerboard mills were running at
full production. Until there is a clear sign that demand for containerboard
by U.S. consumer good manufacturers will recover over the long term, paper
recycling companies will remain hesitant to build new OCC-consuming mills.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Office Papers</B>
<P>
Similar to OCC, the greatest barrier to increasing demand for recovered office
papers is concern that future <I>supplie</I>s of office paper (nationwide)
will not be adequate to meet both existing and projected demand for such
papers. Unlike with OCC, however, there is little concern that office paper
recovery lacks significant <I>potential</I> for growth. The concern is that
office paper recovery will not grow as fast as demand, causing market instability
and possibly production slowdowns due to postconsumer recovered paper shortages.
<P>
Growth in recovered office paper demand has been explosive the past few years,
spearheaded by a number of new high grade deinking (HGD) facilities constructed
in the U.S. In 1995 alone, five new HGD facilities came online in the U.S.,
increasing HGD capacity from 1.5 million tons/yr. to 2.1 million tons/yr.
Six additional HGD facilities are scheduled to be completed by the end of
1996, which would increase total U.S. HGD capacity to approximately 3 million
tons/yr.
<P>
Growth in office paper recovery has not kept pace with the growth in office
paper deinking capacity. It is difficult to quantify the gap between deinking
capacity growth and office paper recovery growth, because there does not
appear to be any good current estimates of office paper recovery in the U.S.
However, the difficulty which deinking mills have experienced obtaining new
supplies of recovered office paper makes it fairly obvious that growth in
demand has exceeded growth in supply.
<P>
Like with OCC, the lack of reliable, current state and local office paper
recovery data is itself a barrier to increasing demand for recovered office
papers. Paper recycling companies must first be assured of adequate supplies
of postconsumer recovered paper before they will venture forward to build
a deinking plant or other paper recycling facility.
<P>
The recent downfall in prices for <I>virgin</I> bleached kraft market pulp-fueled
by unprecedented expansion in virgin market pulp production-has posed a
tremendous, if perhaps temporary, barrier to increasing demand for office
papers. Virgin bleached kraft market pulp is used to produce fine printing
and writing papers and tissue-the same products that recovered office paper
is ultimately recycled into. Thus, virgin market pulp competes with recovered
office paper for the same end-markets. See the following table.

- June 1996</FONT><BR>
<P>
Deinked market pulp-produced by deinking recovered office papers-is typically
less expensive than virgin bleached kraft market pulp. Some paper producers
will pay a little more for deinked market pulp than virgin pulp so that they
can produce recycled paper, which has its own niche market. However, when
the price for virgin bleached kraft market pulp falls below that of deinked
pulp-as it did during the first quarter and most of the second quarter of
1996-some paper producers that rely on deinked market pulp for a portion
of their feedstock switch to virgin pulp.
<P>
Low virgin market pulp prices will continue to pose barriers to increasing
demand for recovered office papers, as existing deinked market pulp producers
have had to scale back production and plans to build new deinked market pulp
capacity have been put on hold. While virgin market pulp prices once again
climbed above those of deinked market pulp in June 1996, there still exists
a large surplus of new virgin market pulp capacity that may keep prices down
for awhile.
<P>
Another barrier to increasing demand for recovered office papers is the technical
problems that several new deinking plants have confronted deinking "sorted
office paper" (also known as "office pack"). Apparently, many deinking systems
have had difficulty handling the relatively high level of contaminants typical
of sorted office paper. In response, some of those deinking plants have elected
to use less sorted office paper and more white ledger, which is more expensive
but typically contains very few contaminants. Substitution of white ledger
for sorted office paper will reduce demand for recovered office paper in
general, because sorted office paper includes many individual paper grades
for which there is very little demand-such as carbonless forms and envelopes
with plastic windows-while white ledger is always in demand.
<P>
Yet another barrier to increasing demand for recovered office papers is that
demand for <I>recycled-content</I> office papers has yet to reach a truly
influential level. Most office papers produced in North America still contain
<I>no</I> postconsumer content, in spite of the growth in high grade deinking
systems. One of the main factors that has held back demand for recycled offices
papers has been the continued price premium on recycled office papers over
non-recycled papers. While the premium has declined in some cases, the higher
price for recycled office papers still acts as deterrent for many would-be
buyers. Without strong consumer demand for recycled office papers, high grade
deinking facilities will not have strong demand for recovered office
papers.<BR>
<P>
<B>Mixed Paper</B>
<P>
The greatest barriers to increasing demand for mixed paper are the very barriers
that limit demand for sorted paper grades, primarily OCC and ONP. In the
U.S., mixed paper is still used primarily as a less expensive alternative
to sorted paper grades, rather than as a preferred feedstock. (There
<I>are</I> some U.S. paper mills where mixed paper is a regular part of the
"fiber recipe", but these mills only account for a small percentage of mixed
paper demand by themselves.)
<P>
When demand is strong and price are high for OCC and ONP, many mills-primarily
mills producing corrugating medium and recycled boxboard-substitute mixed
paper for OCC or ONP. However, when demand for OCC and ONP is not strong
and prices are low, most mills will choose to use sorted OCC and ONP in lieu
of mixed paper, since the latter has less predictable fiber characteristics
and higher levels of contaminants.
<P>
As with OCC and office papers, concerns about inadequate existing supplies
of mixed paper act as a barrier to increasing demand. Paper mills that want
to begin using mixed paper as a consistent part of their fiber recipe typically
must install expensive cleaning equipment to handle the higher level of
contaminants in mixed paper; before making this investment, paper mills want
assurance that there will be adequate supplies of mixed paper to meet their
needs. However, the infrastructure for mixed paper collection is still in
its infancy (at least for <I>residential</I> mixed paper), and recovery rates
are still very low, as indicated in Section IV. Existing recovery of mixed
paper in California is still not high enough to provide a strong incentive
for paper mills to install capacity to consume mixed paper. <BR>
<P>
<B>ONP</B>
<P>
One of the major barriers to increasing demand for ONP is that there is limited
projected growth in newsprint production, so very few new newsprint
mills-recycled or otherwise-are likely to be constructed during the next
few years. Newsprint mills provide by far the greatest demand for ONP of
all end-uses for the material; in 1994, newsprint accounted for slightly
more than half of all ONP consumed in U.S. paper and paperboard mills.
<P>
Two factors might limit future newsprint production: reduction in newsprint
use by newspaper publishers, and anticipated growth in electronic communications.
Publishers of daily newspapers, in efforts to reduce material costs, reduced
consumption of newsprint by 5 percent in 1995 compared to 1994, even though
advertising revenues and circulation increased. Newsprint consumption reductions
were achieved primarily by using more newsprint with shorter width and lighter
weight.
<P>
The growth in electronic communications may also have newsprint producers
wary of the effect that growth will have on newsprint demand. While the newspaper
industry downplays the impact that electronic communications will have on
hard-printed newspapers, there is no question that newspaper publishers are
rushing to go "online." The number of North American daily newspapers on
the Worldwide Web tripled to 175 in 1995, according to the Newspaper Association
of America (NAA), and the NAA projects that 350 dailies will be online by
the end of 1996, or about one out of every five dailies.
<P>
Another barrier to increasing demand for ONP is uncertainty by manufacturers
of how much they will have to pay for ONP. In 1995, ONP prices soared to
unprecedented levels-due to numerous market factors-and some newsprint mills
actually scaled back their use of ONP because virgin pulp was cheaper to
use at the time (considering the costs of deinking and cleaning ONP). While
ONP prices have since fallen back to "normal" levels, the specter of ONP
prices soaring again and steadily increasing overseas demand for ONP serve
as barriers to domestic paper mills increasing their demand for ONP. <BR>

  <B>VII. Strategies to Overcome Barriers to Increasing Postconsumer Recovered
  Paper Demand</B>
</H3>
<P>
<B>OCC</B>
<P>
There is a great deal that the Board can do to help overcome the primary
barrier (potential OCC supply shortage) to increasing OCC demand. Several
actions are suggested in Section V.
<P>
One action that the Board could take to help overcome the OCC demand barrier
of outdated local supply data is to <I>estimate</I> current local OCC generation
and recovery data. The Board could develop a statistical method to estimate
current local OCC recovery and disposal levels, based on the "OCC" category
from each of the 1990 SRREs compiled in the Board's "interim database." This
revised information could then be distributed to the local governments that
compiled the original OCC recovery and disposal data, as well as to Recycling
Market Development Zone administrators. The revised information could be
used to assist paper recycling manufacturers looking to establish a facility
in a particular area of the state.
<P>
Another approach the Board could take to update local OCC recovery data is
to determine which local governments have recently performed waste
characterization studies that include OCC, and to obtain and compile such
information. The Board could determine what current OCC recovery data is
available through a survey or through an announcement in a Board publication
such as <I>InfoCycling.</I>
<P>
Regarding the OCC demand barrier of sluggish industrial demand for
containerboard, there is obviously little that the Board can do. Demand for
postconsumer recovered paper, like demand for virgin pulp, is dependent on
the production strength of the industries that consume the feedstocks. As
the economies of the U.S. and its foreign trading partners improve, demand
for packaging materials such as containerboard will improve, and paper producers
will increase their demand for OCC. Until then, the best the Board can do
is to educate the recycling community about the relationship between economic
productivity and demand for secondary materials. The Board's <I>Quarterly
Report on California's Recycling Markets</I> provides information is each
issue that explains the relationship between the state of the U.S. economy
and California's recycling markets.
<P>
<B>Office Papers</B>
<P>
There is much that the Board can do, and is doing, to help overcome the "lack
of supply" demand barrier for recovered office papers; several suggested
actions are presented in Section V.
<P>
To address the office paper demand barrier of lack of current supply data,
the Board could first estimate office paper recovery in California. Such
an estimate could be performed using the method the Board developed to annually
calculate California's utilization rates for postconsumer paper, OCC, and
ONP.
<P>
The Board could also develop a method to estimate current <I>local</I> "high
grade ledger" recovery and disposal levels, based on the information in each
of the 1990 SRREs compiled in the Board's interim database. This updated
information could then be distributed to the local governments that prepared
the original information, as well as to Recycling Market Development Zone
administrators, so that it could be used by paper recycling manufacturers
looking to site in a particular area of the state. Also, the Board could
determine what current local office paper recovery data is available, and
obtain and compile the data.
<P>
Regarding the negative impact that depressed virgin market pulp prices have
had on demand for recovered office paper, there is obviously little the Board
can do, since prices are determined by a free market. However, recognizing
that low virgin market pulp prices (relative to deinked market pulp) could
ultimately reduce the amount of <I>recycled</I> office papers produced, the
Board could step up its efforts to promote the purchase of such papers. If
demand stays strong for recycled office papers, paper manufacturers will
be less likely to abandon deinked market pulp in favor of less expensive
virgin pulp.
<P>
To address the demand barrier of excessive contamination in sorted office
paper, the Board could publish educational materials for local government
recycling coordinators and office recycling coordinators stressing the importance
of minimizing contaminants in office paper collection programs. These materials
could be included in the Board's Business Waste Prevention/Recycling Assistance
Kits.
<P>
The Board is already addressing the demand barrier of lack of demand for
<I>recycled</I> office papers through a couple of programs carried out by
the Buy Recycled Section of the Waste Prevention and Market Development Division.
The primary program is promoting membership in and growth of the Recycled
Paper Coalition. The other is general promotion of recycled products procurement
targeted at the private sector, as guided by the Board's Private Buy Recycled
Strategy. These programs are critical to keeping pressure on office paper
manufacturers to produce <I>recycled</I> office papers, and should be continued
and expanded. More information about these programs is provided in <I>Market
Status Report: Buy Recycled Programs</I>.
<P>
Since the price premium of recycled bond paper is one of the primary barriers
to increasing procurement of such paper, the Board could determine methods
that private companies can employ to minimize the higher cost of recycled
bond, and promote these methods through the Buy Recycled Coalition. Also,
where misinformation is being spread about the price disparity between virgin
and recycled bond, the Board could provide accurate information to potential
buyers of recycled bond. <BR>
<P>
<B>Mixed Paper</B>
<P>
Strategies to overcome the demand barrier of lack of mixed paper supply were
already addressed in Section VII.
<P>
In order to increase mixed paper demand and make it less reliant on OCC and
ONP demand, new end-uses for mixed paper must be developed. Perhaps the greatest
potential market for mixed paper has been largely overlooked: construction
materials. A number of producers of construction materials-such as wallboard,
floor substrate, construction blocks, and medium density fiberboard-have
already demonstrated mixed paper's suitability as a feedstock to produce
these materials. However, the construction materials industry as whole is
still largely unaware of the availability, low cost, and strength characteristics
of mixed paper as a suitable alternative to wood-based feedstock.
<P>
To stimulate demand for mixed paper, the Board could promote the benefits
of using mixed paper to produce appropriate construction materials. The Board
could spotlight particular construction materials made with mixed paper,
and promote these products through fact sheets and/or newsletters targeted
at both the construction materials industry as well as users of these products
(builders and homeowners). The Board's Buy Recycled Section in the Secondary
Materials Assistance Branch is presently developing a "Building Industry
Alliance", which would be an excellent vehicle for promoting the use of mixed
paper in construction materials. <BR>
<P>
<B>ONP</B>
<P>
If ONP demand continues to fall due to publishers streamlining the size of
their newspapers, it should be of little concern to the Board, since there
will be less ONP generated in the first place! Similarly, if electronic
communications reduce the amount of newsprint produced and consumed in the
U.S., this will ease the need to develop demand for ONP.
<P>
<I>Existing</I> U.S. and Canadian newsprint mills could certainly increase
their consumption of ONP. In 1993, recycled fiber represented only about
22 percent of total fiber used for newsprint in the U.S.; while that figure
has surely increased, it is unlikely that it has exceeded 30 percent.
<P>
However, it would be a daunting task for the Board to try to stimulate further
demand for ONP by newsprint mills. Both mills and newsprint publishers have
resisted any efforts to mandate increased ONP consumption. In fact, newspaper
publishers in some states with minimum recycled-content laws for newsprint
have been successful in <I>scaling back</I> requirements for the minimum
recycled content in the newsprint that they use.
<P>
Finally, in an effort to smooth out the erratic price swings for ONP that
serve as a barriers to increasing demand, the Board could promote trading
of ONP as a commodity on the Chicago Board of Trade's (CBOT) secondary materials
exchange. At the urging of the National Recycling Coalition and other recycling
advocates, CBOT recently began listing ONP and other grades of postconsumer
recovered paper on their electronic marketplace. It is hoped that by providing
easier access to supply and price information, the CBOT secondary materials
exchange will lead to more stable markets. The Board could promote the CBOT
secondary materials exchange to existing paper collectors and brokers, and
especially to those individuals seeking to start up paper collection businesses.

<FONT  SIZE=+3><B>Why Reduce Office Paper? </B></FONT>
<HR>

<P>More than half of the 45 million tons of waste produced in California each year is generated by the commercial and industrial sectors.  Office paper makes up a significant percentage of the commercial paper wastestream, and is by far the largest component of solid waste generated by offices.  It's no wonder, then, that there is such great potential for offices to save money and conserve resources by reducing, reusing, and recycling office paper.  With the appropriate information, businesses that reduce their office paper use can significantly reduce the total amount of waste they generate, thereby benefiting their bottom line as well as the environment.
<P>
A successful campaign will include office paper reduction and reuse as well as collection of recovered paper and purchasing of recycled-content paper.  We suggest emphasizing paper reduction and reuse in your campaign.  Paper that is never used, or used twice instead of once, adds up to big savings for offices and the environment.  We've got lots of ideas to help you.  <STRONG><A HREF="gop.htm#campaign"> Take a look!</A></STRONG>

<FONT  SIZE=+2><B>Vendors for Office Paper Collection Containers, Sorting Systems, Etc.</B></FONT>
<P>
<HR>The California Integrated Waste Management Board has created a list of vendors for office paper collection containers, etc. from Resource Recycling's 1996-97 Recycling & Composting Equipment Directory, with permission from the publisher.  If your office is interested in sorting and collecting paper for recycling, this list may be a resource for you.  
<P>
To order the list of vendors directly from the California Integrated Waste Management Board, e-mail your request to <A HREF="mailto:bzassist@mrt.ciwmb.ca.gov">bzassist@mrt.ciwmb.ca.gov</A>, or you can obtain a complete copy of Resource Recycling's 1996-97 Recycling & Composting Equipment Directory by purchasing the July 1996 issue of Resource Recycling  from the publisher; call 503-227-1319.
<P>
The list of vendors for office paper collection containers, sorting systems, etc., contains contact information for the vendors, as well as a brief description of their products.   The list also contains contact information for all the vendors listed in Resource Recycling's  Equipment Directory, which includes vendors for all types of recycling and composting equipment.  The Directory classifies the vendors broadly by purpose, such as "paper processing", and more specifically by equipment type, such as "horizontal balers" and "paper shredders." 
<P>
Many of the products listed in the directory can be ordered through California recycling equipment distributors.  Two well known California distributors are Recy CAL in Temecula (1-800-927-3872) and Business Ecology Products in Walnut Creek (1-800-932-2235).
<P>

<P>
<HR>This section outlines resources to help your office purchase recycled content paper products. Contrary to common misperception, recycled content paper can look and function as well, or better, than virgin fiber paper.  While many procurement officers think of recycled paper as that "earthy, grainy, artsy paper" found in greeting card boutiques, the truth is that most all office paper requirements can be fulfilled with recycled content stock.

The CIWMB has two collections of graphics for public use in developing waste reduction educational materials. You are welcome to use them in your home, office, and community for producing waste prevention materials of your own, (non-commecial use only). Many of the images have large dimensions and may need to be resized for specific use. They are viewed online in GIF format, but can be downloaded in GIF, PCX, and TIF formats.

			The following waste reduction terms are used throughout the
application. You should be familiar with these waste reduction ideas and the
terms below as you complete your WRAP application. We would like to emphasize
that waste prevention is the best solution for minimizing the amount of waste
sent to landfills. While recycling and composting are important components in
our solution to the waste dilemma, preventing waste before it is created is the
ultimate goal in waste reduction.

							PDF file printing can be troubling if your Page
Setup preferences are not correct. Here are some tips:
							<BR>
							<BR>
							<B>
								A)
							</B>
							Make sure to test your print-output before printing
the entire file. To do this, print one or two pages of the file. Choose a text
page
							<I>
								and
							</I>
							a page with graphics. Print these and take a look to
make sure they are suitable before sending the entire document to the printer.
							<BR>
							<BR>
							<B>
								B)
							</B>
							PDF printing can be RAM (random access memory)
intensive. The "spooling" of a large PDF file (as with any filetype) can take a
while. The nice thing about PDF files is that they are true pages, and can be
sent in sections, based upon need, to the printer. If your system or printer
does not have a lot of RAM, print the file in 10 page sections (this suggestion
is for files larger than 300k). This will reduce the amount of print time for
large PDF files because the amount of information you are sending from your
computer to the printer is minimized.
							<BR>
							<BR>
							<B>
								C)
							</B>
							Suggested Printer Settings:
							<BR>
							<BR>
							Laser printer settings:
							<BR>
							For black and white output (as the majority of Laser
printers print black ink only) in your Page Setup dialog box,
							<B>
								set the "Graphic Mode" to "Raster" or "Black and
White"
							</B>
							.
							<BR>
							<BR>
							DeskJets, InkJets, DeskWriters, etc. (both color and
black and white):
							<BR>
							Grayscale and black and white PDF files will print
fine if the Page Setup dialog box is set to "black and white". This is because
the grayscales of the document are embedded.
							<B>
								DO NOT print black and white or grayscale PDF
files in the "Grayscale" mode
							</B>
							. This can often corrupt the graphical output. Color
PDF files should print fine on all color printers.
							<BR>
							<BR>
							Again if your not sure of the output, test your
settings on one or two pages of a large PDF file before printing the entire
document.

		33. A waste evaluation is an analysis of the wastes generated at your
facility. A waste evaluation includes information on the types of waste
materials that are generated, how much of each material is generated, and which
operations generate the materials. It can be a systematic survey of your trash,
or you can sort, weigh, and measure the volume of all the materials in your
garbage to get more detailed information. Have you performed a waste evaluation?

		38. So that we may promote WRAP winners to the media with as much
enthusiasm as possible, please write a profile of your company according to the
format below:
		<P>
		<UL>
			1. Make it NEWSWORTHY! Tell the media what's exciting about your
program and give them numbers.
			<P>
			2.
			<b>
				Please write one complete paragraph containing five sentences in
the order requested below. Strive to highlight unusual or interesting practices
that might make your business stand out to the media.
			</b>
			Although it is tempting to pack as much information as you can into
the five sentences, please keep them short, simple, and concise. Doing so will
increase your chances of receiving media coverage.
			<P>
			3. Since the media reports from the third person point of view, it
is imperative that you write your profile in the third person (e.g., "Bob's
Widget World recycles" instead of "We recycle").
			<P>
			<b>
				4. Your profile must contain the following and only the
following:
			</b>
			<P>
			<DD>
			A. One sentence that describes what your business is or does;
			<P>
			<DD>
			B. Two sentences outlining your most newsworthy, unique,
			<BR>
			<DD>
			or successful recycling and/or waste reduction activities;
			<P>
			<DD>
			C. Two sentences that explain any cost savings and
			<BR>
			<DD>
			quantify your waste reduction.
			<P>
			5. For example: Bob's Widget World manufactures widget parts and
accessories. Bob's donates their surplus widgets to a charity organization that
distributes them to schools in developing countries. To minimize the amount of
packaging waste it generates, Bob's reduced the size of their widget box by 20%
and reuses packaging materials whenever possible. Bob's waste reduction and
recycling program has enabled the company to reduce its weekly trash pick-ups
from five to one. This has saved them $20,000 annually.

During the 4th quarter of FY 1994/95, <B>7 ,623 tons</B> of material were reported collected for recycling from State of California facilities. This compares to <B>5,772</B> tons collected during the same quarter of FY 1993/94.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="upd_1095.gif"></CENTER>
The largest material type collected for recycling was old corrugated containers with 1,113 tons or 15 percent of the total recycled, followed by mixed paper at 757 tons or 10 percent.
<P>
During FY 1994/95, <B>26,634 tons</B> of material were collected for recycling, which is a<B> 17 percent increase</B> over the <B>22,706 tons</B> collected during FY 1993/94.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="recycle.gif"></CENTER><BR><P>
<DT><LEFT><H3><B>Recycling Plan for New State of California Building</B></H3></LEFT>
<P>
Last Spring, Project Recycle helped the Department of General Services, Office of Project Development and Management (OPDM), plan recycling space for the new Elihu M. Harris State Office Building in Oakland. The 700,000 gross square foot building will house about 2,400 employees from twenty-five State of California entities at a fixed construction and office furnishings cost of $97 million.
It is scheduled for occupancy in April 1998. 
<P>
Because of local competition to collect mixed recyclables (dry commingled), high waste disposal costs, and the size of the building, two main recommendations were made. First, allocate office and loading dock space for a traditional source separation program.  This should ensure adequate space to adapt to unforeseen change.  Second, implement source separation of recyclables only at high volume, high market value, low contamination functional areas, and implement dry commingled at all other functional areas of the building. This would mean collection of computer printout in the Computer Room, white ledger in the Copier/Duplicating Room, corrugated cardboard at the Sundry Shop and General Retail Space, and dry commingled in all office areas. The dry commingled would be compacted at the loading dock, then separated by material type at a Material Recovery Facility (MRF). Cafeteria and restroom waste, and food &amp; beverages from all functional areas, would be kept separate for landfilling.
<P>
The result should be a relatively simple program with a high waste diversion rate, low overall cost to the State of California, and minimal burden on custodial staff. Stay tuned for a progress report in 1998!

<B>by Sara K. Pence, State Park Aide<BR>Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park</B>
<P>
When I think of State of California Parks, I think of preservation of our recreational and historic resources. Recently, I looked around Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park and saw beautifully preserved historic monuments and buildings, wonderful picnic areas and river access, but something was missing! People were throwing away all their garbage! At our next team meeting we agreed we should do something about this and recycle our office waste paper, cardboard, newsprint, and aluminum, but would need some help to get the program started.
<P>
It takes a lot of folks to make recycling happen.  All of our office paper is now collected by the M. O. R. E. Crew (a local rehabilitation enterprise) who also clean our comfort stations. Our local waste hauler provides a bin for cardboard in the park that they pick up weekly and they also take our newspapers.  We wanted to have our aluminum can collection containers fit in with the historic aspect of the park and to be economical as well.  The Gold Discovery Park Association bought used wine barrels from local wineries to make the recycling containers more attractive. Project Recycle at the California Integrated Waste Management Board helped us immensely by providing us with can-crusher lids for our barrels as well as paper recycling boxes and cans for our offices and museum. Wes West and Paul LaFata of park maintenance assembled the lids to the barrels for our aluminum recycling program and they look great located out in the park. Thanks to everyone for all your help, and remember, if you're not recycling, you're throwing it all away!
<P>
<I>Good job Sara! For more information on the project at Marshall Gold Discovery State Park contact Jesse Adams (CIWMB) at (916) 255-2489, or Sara Pence (DP&amp;R) at (916) 622-1116.</I>

Of the 29 million used tires generated in California last year, nearly 18 million or 62 percent were diverted from landfills for reuse, retreading, or combustion. This compares to 9.2 million tires diverted in 1990. Reasons for the increased diversion are threefold: increased use of tires as an energy source, increased use of tires for Rubber Modified Asphalt (RMA), and increased research and development of rubber derived products. 
<P>
lmost 40 percent of the total tires diverted in 1994 was for combustion purposes. Half of the tires combusted were used to generate electrical power for re-sale to utilities, and the other half were used as a fuel supplement in the production of cement.
<P>
Last year alone the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and local governments used more than 800,000 tons of RMA or about 1.5 million used tires. The amount of tires used in road paving is increasing because more public works departments are discovering that RMA meets a wide variety of needs. RMA lasts longer than conventional asphalt and a thinner layer of RMA will last just as long as a thicker layer of conventional asphalt. Other advantages of RMA are: it retards cracking due to its pliability, absorbs sound, and has a de-icing capacity since water doesn't penetrate RMA as easily as it does with conventional asphalt. 
<P>
In 1994/95, the Board awarded $1.3 million to businesses and local government for research, tire pile clean-up, and development of new products made from old tires. This money comes from a 25 cent fee per used tire left with a dealer. Some of the products under development include roofing shakes, soil amendments, highway noise barriers, and playground safety mats. 
<P>

<DT><LEFT><H3><B>Can and Should Shredded paper be Recycled?</B></H3></LEFT>
<P>
A frequently asked question of Project Recycle staff is, &quot;can we recycle our shredded waste paper?&quot; The answer is that almost any material can be recycled. However, many recyclers either won't pick up shredded paper or don't want anyone to bring it to them. Recyclers are paid by weight, not volume. Shredding waste paper turns a small weight into a big volume. It may not be cost effective for a recycler to collect just shredded paper. Also, a recycler cannot easily inspect shredded paper for contaminants.  However, a recycler may accept shredded paper if kept separate from other waste paper. It's important to check with your recycler to determine their requirements for shredded paper collection.
<P>
Another major consideration is whether or not your shredded paper satisfies State of California requirements for confidential destruction (see SAM Section 1690). Check with your Records Management Coordinator to see if the shredder in your office shreds the material sufficiently to render the paper nonconfidential. Even though recycling is important, it is more important that confidential information remains confidential.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="recycle.gif"></CENTER><BR><P>
<DT><LEFT><H3><B>Small Offices in Rural Areas Can Recycle! </B></H3></LEFT>
<P>
Over the past few months Project Recycle increased its work with State of California offices in rural areas to set up recycling programs. For example, DMV, EDD, Caltrans, Forestry and Fire Protection, Corrections, CHP, and Fish &amp; Game offices located in Quincy and Bishop were contacted to start new office paper recycling programs. These small offices did not individually meet Project Recycle's criteria for the minimum number of employees to support a recycling program.  However, when there are several offices located close to one another that want to recycle and there is a recycler nearby, they may be able to jointly support a recycling program.
<P>
The key element in Project Recycle's assistance to rural areas is finding a recycler. If there isn't a local recycler, it is very difficult to have the materials collected. Once a local recycler is located, Project Recycle and/or the recycler visit individual offices, provide recycling containers, and explain how the program will work. When the containers are full, designated office staff simply call the local recycler. The good part about rural area recycling is that if the office needs a pick up of recyclables, the recycler can usually respond promptly.

<DD>During the 3rd quarter of FY 1994/95, <B>6,214 tons</B> of material were collected for recycling from State of California facilities.  This compares to<B> 6,972 tons</B> collected during the same quarter of FY 1993/94. 
<IMG SRC="upd_0795.gif" ALIGN=CENTER>
<DD>Old Corrugated Containers was the largest material type collected for recycling at 1,642 tons or 26% followed by White Ledger at 603 tons or 10%.
<P>
<DT><H3><B>MOVING AND RECYCLING CONTAINERS</B></H3>
<P>
<DD>One of Project Recycle's challenges is to keep up with State of California office movement, consolidation, and name changes.  To properly administer the State of California's recycling program, Project Recycle must have current information on each recycling program.  Data is needed on materials recycled at each program location, the company or organization collecting the recyclables, site contact name and phone number, and mailing addresses.  We need to coordinate new  pickup locations with the recycler and make certain they aren't trying to collect materials from a location that may be closed or occupied by a new (non-state) tenant.  When your office is planning to move, please notify the assigned Project Recycle staff person at least one month prior to the move date.
<P>
<DD>To ensure that metal 20-gallon recycling containers don't get stuck together or damaged when moved with other office materials, put them in separate boxes.  If you must pack one inside the other, place at least 4-1/2&quot; of crumpled newspaper or corrugated cardboard between the containers.  If they do get stuck, spray liquid glass cleaner between the containers, slowly roll them on a carpet, then try to separate them.
<P>
<DT><H3><B>RECYCLING HOTLINE</B></H3>
<P>
<DD>At the tag end of each Project Recycle Update, readers find the California Integrated Waste Management Board's Board's Recycling Hotline number.   Use it to find where recyclables can be taken if the material is not accepted by your recycler(s).  The hotline may also be used by any California resident to find collection facilities for individual recycling needs.
<P>
<DD>The hotline is linked to an electronic database of nearly 4,000 recycling centers in California.  They accept a wide variety of  materials from the public, including telephone books, used motor oil, aluminum, plastics, metals, glass, newspaper, corrugated cardboard, and other paper products.  The database also has information on household toxic &quot;roundups&quot; and collection facilities.  Dissemination of recycling information is coordinated with other State of California departments, including the Department of Toxic Substances Control (hazardous waste) and the Department of Conservation (curbside recycling information and beverage container certified redemption centers).  County contact names and telephone numbers are also included in the database.  The number is <B>1-800-553-2962</B>.
<P>
<DT><H3><B>QUARTERLY RECYCLE PRO</B></H3>
<DD><B>Dan Pollock, Area Superintendent, Woodland, CA</B>
<P>
<DD>In December 1993, CalTrans purchased 48 bins to collect aluminum, glass, and plastic beverage containers at 11 Roadside Rest Stops in Sacramento, Yolo, Colusa, Glenn, and Nevada counties.  An additional 12 bins were installed at the Aliso Creek Roadside Rest Stop on I-5 north of Oceanside in San Diego County.  Aliso Creek is the most visited Roadside Rest in the State of California with an annual visitor use of over 10 million people.
<P>
<DD>The recycle bins installed by CalTrans have been well received by the public.  Half of the 89 Roadside Rests that CalTrans operates will eventually have these recycling containers.  Some of the Roadside Rests will not have collection programs, because of their location or the low number of visitors.  A reported 1,612 pounds of aluminum, 17,769 pounds of glass, and 1,817 pounds of plastics were collected from Roadside Rests in Northern California in 1994 during FY 94/95. 
<P>
<DD>Aluminum can collection has presented a challenge because of continuous theft.  Working with the bin manufacturer and changing the lock design, they may now have an effective design to discourage  theft by people.  The recycle bins were designed to be bear proof, but not people proof!
<P>
<DD>So when you travel this summer, look for CalTrans' recycling containers.
   Thanks Dan! 
<P>
<DT><H3><B>UNIVERSITY WASTE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING STATUS REPORT</B></H3>
<P>
<DD>In some communities, one of the largest generators of solid waste may be a college or university.  For example, the University of California, Santa Cruz, has generated as much as 10% of the materials disposed in the local landfill.  One of Project Recycle's responsibilities is assisting public university and college waste reduction programs.   A recent report on the state of waste reduction, recycling, and product procurement at all California public universities and colleges has some interesting findings.
<P>
<DD>According to this report, California's public universities and colleges are the largest generators of solid waste among State of California facilities, with 2.2 million people generating over<B> 400,000 tons per year</B>.  This represents 51% of the waste generated by State-owned and leased facilities. 
<P>
<DD>While local jurisdictions (cities and counties) have State-mandated goals to reduce solid waste, there are no specific mandates requiring these institutions to divert solid waste from landfills.  Current university waste diversion (recycling) rates range from less than 1% to 45%.  Waste diversion reports from these institutions are incomplete, especially from Community Colleges.  However, waste diversion reported has increased from <B>2,882 tons</B> in FY 1992/93 to <B>10,874 tons </B>in FY 1993/94.  Successful campus waste diversion programs could significantly help some local governments meet their State-mandated waste diversion goals.  Campuses reported the diversion of a large number of material types including:   paper, beverage containers, plastics, food waste, landscape waste, manure, textiles, mattresses, electronic equipment, furniture, tires, motor oil, freon, solvents, pallets and construction and demolition debris.  However, there is substantial room for improvement in campus waste diversion and reporting of this activity to CIWMB.
<P>
<DD>Major barriers to successful waste diversion include:  insufficient administrative support, policies, mandates, and funding; insufficient knowledge of waste reduction methods and benefits; and lack of full-time recycling coordinators.

<DT><H4>Recycled Product Procurement</H4>
<P>
<DD>Recycled product procurement varies widely from campus to campus and from system to system.  In Calendar Year 1993, approximately 25.4% (over $800,000) of the CSU's total reported purchases were made with recycled materials.  In FY 1993/1994, the UC spent<B> $4.917 million</B> on recycled paper alone. California Community Colleges have no system-wide recycled product purchase reporting requirements.
<P>
<DD>Major barriers to the procurement of recycled content products by California public universities and colleges include:
<UL>
<LI>insufficient knowledge of sources, prices and quality; 
<LI>insufficient mandates, policies and administrative support;

<LI>decentralized purchasing, and  
<LI>a large workload for purchasing officers.
</UL>

<P>
<DT><H4>Project Recycle Assistance</H4>
<P>
<DD>To divert such a large waste stream from landfills and provide resources for California's economy, Project Recycle provides:
<UL>
<LI>technical assistance;
<LI>waste reduction and recycling training;
<LI>intermediate and desktop recycling containers; and
<LI>referrals to other Board assistance programs.

<DT><H3><B>LASER TONER CARTRIDGE RECYCLING</B></H3>
<P>
<DD>The Department of General Services (DGS) contract for purchase of remanufactured laser toner cartridges (LTCs) expires on June 30, 1995.  The DGS, Office of Information Technology, will soon award a new contract for the purchase of remanufactured LTCs.  The proposed new contract does not provide for recycling LTCs not returned in exchange for a remanufactured LTC.  To recycle LTCs which will not be exchanged for remanufactured ones, Project Recycle maintains a list of recyclers who will accept old LTCs and other printer components for recycling.  The list includes the recycler's name, address, and phone number.  To recycle used LTCs, contact the recycler nearest your office (if compatible with your department's procedure).  To purchase LTCs at discounted prices, under the new contract, call Paul Apfel, Office of Information Technology, at (916) 323-3235.

		Welcome to WRAP 1996, the 4th annual Waste Reduction Awards Program for
California businesses. The California Integrated Waste Management Board is
pleased to sponsor WRAP as an important part of its efforts to find new ways to
help California businesses save money by reducing waste. WRAP is an exciting and
growing program, with a presence on the Internet's World Wide Web in 1996.
		<P>
		This year the Board also takes pride in announcing the WRAP of the Year
Awards, the winners of which will be selected from among the major industry
types represented by 1996 WRAP applicants.
		<P>
		Thank you for taking the time to complete this application. The Board
applauds your efforts to voluntarily prevent and reduce the waste you generate.
Since over half of California's waste is generated by the commercial and
industrial sectors, the active participation of the business community is
central to the Board's mission to reduce, reuse, and recycle California's
wastes. By recognizing exceptional businesses with the WRAP award, we hope to
stimulate additional private sector advances in waste reduction and gain
information on how to provide additional assistance to businesses. If you have
questions about how to reduce waste, I invite you to call the Business Education
and Assistance Section at (916) 255-2354. Thank you once again. The Board looks
forward to receiving your application.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT>ince its foundation in 1983, the Research Centre
for International Law has become an important forum for the exchange of
information and ideas for international lawyers from around the world.
It fosters critical and constructive research on the role, content and

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Centre's interests cover the whole of the law
governing the peaceful relations between states including: systems of international
dispute settlement, limitations on the use of force and the regulation
of hostilities, international human rights, the development and operation
of international organisations and the emergence of new legal regimes in
such fields as international economic, maritime and environmental law.</P>

<H4>Visiting Fellows and Scholars</H4>

<P>Providing a home in Cambridge for visitors from many parts of the world
is an important aspect of the Centre's activity. Visitors are welcomed
for periods varying from a few weeks to a year to pursue their own research
projects. While in Cambridge, they meet with other scholars in their fields
and gain encouragement and direction from the many distinguished international
lawyers associated with the Centre and the University. Visitors are encouraged
to participate fully in the activities of the Centre and to attend lectures
and seminars on international law and related subjects in the Faculty of
Law and elsewhere in the University.</P>

<H3><A NAME="anchor281143"></A>FOUNDATION AND DEVELOPMENT </H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Research Centre for International Law was established
in 1983 within the faculty of law of the University of Cambridge by its
founding director <IMG SRC="lauterpacht1.gif" HSPACE=5 HEIGHT=200 WIDTH=180 ALIGN=LEFT>(now
Emeritus Director), <B>Professor Elihu Lauterpacht, CBE, QC</B>. Over the
decade of his leadership, the Centre gained wide recognition for the significant
contribution it made to the development of international law. In 1985,
the Centre moved to its present home at 5 Cranmer Road, a short walk from
the new <A HREF="http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/">University Law Faculty</A><B>
</B>at the Sidgwick Site. A spacious Edwardian house situated in pleasant
gardens, the Centre enjoys a congenial and friendly atmosphere.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Centre houses a basic international law library
which supplements the extensive holdings of the University Library and
Squire Law Library (to both of which its fellows and scholars have access).
It also maintains a unique collection of pleadings and other documents
from international litigation and arbitrations of interest to scholars
and practioners alike. It is hoped that the Centre's collection will soon
be part of the&nbsp;online <A HREF="telnet://ul.cam.ac.uk">Cambridge University
Libraries Catalogue</A> system. The Centre has recently improved its computing
facilities, networking PCs and providing direct internet and email access
to individual offices. The telephone system has been upgraded to include
voicemail services. The completion of a sizeable extension to the building
in November 1996 will provide much needed additional office, library and
conference space for the Centre.</P>

<DT><FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT>ince 1995, two new directors have continued the
work of Professor Lauterpacht:</DT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Research Centre for International Law is partially
funded by the University of Cambridge, and in addition has been generously
supported on a project basis by the Ford Foundation, the John D. and Catherine
T. MacArthur Foundation and the Commission of the European Union among
others. The Centre has also been the beneficiary of many individual acts
of philanthropy, especially towards the expansion and improvement of facilities.
In particular, the Centre would like to acknowledge Earl Snyer of Indiana
for the establishment of the Snyder Scholarship, and his general support
of the Centre over many years. Donations are gratefully received and are
subject to tax relief. </P>

Sites of that type are kept on a <A HREF="USELESS.HTM"> separate list</A>.   <P>This list does not cover electronic subscription services.</H2><BR> <UL><H2><LI><A HREF="http://www.abanet.org/journal/home.html">ABA Journal </A>  Selected current articles and news, from April 1995.  <LI><A HREF="http://www.law.indiana.edu/law/v-lib/journals.html">Akron Law Review</A> Recent articles.<LI><A HREF="http://www.wcl.american.edu/pub/journals/lawrev/aulrhome.htm">American University Law Review</A> Text of recent numbers.<LI><A HREF="http://www.antitrust.org/">Antitrust Policy</A> On-line resource.<LI><A HREF="http://www.primenet.com/~crh4/">Appellate Decisions Noted</A> California legal professional newsletter.<LI><A HREF="http://server.berkeley.edu/BTLJ">Berkeley Technology Law Journal (formerly High Technology Law Journal)</A> Full contents, with abstracts, full text of book reviews, and subscription information.<LI><A HREF="http://www.callaw.com/recorderad.html">Cal Law</A> Daily briefing for California lawyers.<LI><A HREF="http://www.cma.ca/newsltrs/cbr/">Canadian Bioethics Report </A>  Full text from January 1995.  <LI><A HREF="http://yu1.yu.edu/csl/journals/aelj/">Cardozo Arts and Entertainment Law Journal</A>   Full text from vol. 13 no.1 (1995); index of past issues.   <LI><A HREF="http://www.gelso.unitn.it/card-adm/Welcome.html">Cardozo Electronic Law Bulletin</A>  Full text electronic journal on Italian Law (some in English, some in Italian).<LI><A HREF="http://www.abanet.org/buslaw/cln696.html">Commercial Law Newsletter</A><LI><A HREF="http://www.abanet.org/genpractice/compleat/home.html">Compleat Lawyer</A> American Bar Aossociation<LI><A HREF="http://gahtan.com/alan/cln/">Computer Lawyer News</A> US electronic newsletter for lawyers in media and technology fields.<LI><A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/clr/clr.htm">Cornell Law Review</A> Full text of current numbers, and subscription information.<LI><A HREF="http://www.patriot.net/users/crouch/fln.html">Crouch &amp; Crouch Family Law</A> Virginia Family Law; full text.<LI><A HREF="http://www.DROIT.umontreal.ca/CRDP/CyberNews/index_eng.html">Cyber News</A>  Information Technology Law.

<BODY>
<H1><IMG SRC="/GIFS/SHIELD.GIF" ALT="[University Shield]" ALIGN=MIDDLE>The University of Cambridge</H1>
<BR>
The University of Cambridge, which came into existence in the thirteenth century, now has about 7,000 staff and an undergraduate population in the region of 10,500.  It is also an international centre for advanced study and research, with over 4,000 postgraduate students.<P>
It is governed by the Regent House, which consists of all the "dons" - the teaching, research and graduate administrative officers - and acts as a democratic legislature if a new measure is put to the vote.  The administration is overseen by three "central bodies": the Council, the General Board of the Faculties, and the Finance Committee.  The principal administrative officer is the Vice-Chancellor.<P>
The University prescribes minimum requirements for admission and lays down regulations for residence and study, provides lectures and seminars, conducts examinations, confers degrees, and is generally responsible for maintaining the principal libraries, laboratories and museums.  It is also an employer: most (but not all) of the dons are employed primarily by the University, as are the University assistant staff. <P>
A complete text of the statutes governing the University, and of all the current regulations made by the University, may be found in Statutes and Ordinances of the University of Cambridge (1991, with annual cumulative supplements).  Changes made during the year are published in the weekly Cambridge University Reporter.<P>
The Cambridge University Guide to Courses 1995-96 provides a summary of the regulations and of the courses offered throughout the University.<BR>

</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1><IMG SRC="/GIFS/SHIELD.GIF" ALIGN = MIDDLE>The Colleges</H1>
<BR>
Another dimension of the University is that it is a federation of independent self-governing colleges.  The thirty colleges, which range in date of foundation from 1284 to 1977, are charitable corporations, each separately governed by a head and a variable number of fellows.  Most University teaching officers are at the same time fellows of colleges, and those in the Arts and Humanities (including law) usually work primarily from their college rooms.  The colleges augment the University's teaching strength by employing in addition their own teaching officers; those who are paid solely by a college are known as College Teaching Officers (CTOs).  The colleges also support research by electing research fellows.<P>
Since it is impossible to become a student member of the University without first being a member of a college, the colleges have considerable control over the admission of students.  The colleges are responsible for the welfare and academical progress of all those whom they admit.  Each student has a Director of Studies and a Tutor.   The Director of Studies is responsible for settling an appropriate course of study, advising on methods of study, and (in the case of an undergraduate) arranging supervision.  The Tutor is responsible for helping with personal questions.  Colleges also provide accommodation, meals, library facilities and recreation for their members.  <P>
Undergraduate supervision takes the form of small-group teaching arranged by the colleges, usually fortnightly in each Tripos subject, with assignments of written work.  All postgraduate teaching and research supervision, on the other hand, is provided by the University.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>History of the Faculty of Law</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1><IMG SRC="/GIFS/SHIELD.GIF" ALIGN = MIDDLE>History of the Faculty of Law</H1><BR>
Law has been studied and taught in Cambridge since the thirteenth century, when the core subjects of legal study in all European universities were Civil law (the law of ancient Rome) and the Canon law of the Church.  Early graduates of the Cambridge Faculty of Canon Law held the highest judicial positions in Europe - in the Rota at Avignon - and two of them (William Bateman and Thomas Fastolf) wrote the first known law reports in the ius commune tradition.  The principal commentator on medieval English Canon law, William Lyndwood, was another graduate of the Faculty.  The Faculty of Canon Law was closed by King Henry VIII in 1535, but the Faculty received some compensation when the same king appointed the first Regius Professor of Civil Law in about 1540.  Academical legal learning was cosmopolitan; Cambridge doctors of law practised in the ecclesiastical and admiralty courts, assisted the nation on foreign embassies, and discoursed of law, justice and government in philosophical and comparative terms.  Here lay the roots of the Faculty's long standing tradition of excellence in international and comparative law, jurisprudence and legal history.  <P>
English law was added to the curriculum in 1800, with the foundation of the Downing Professorship of the Laws of England.  Examinations in law for the B.A. Degree began in 1858, and the Faculty has grown steadily since then in size and in the range of its interests.  The other established chairs in the Faculty are: the Whewell (International Law, 1867), the Rouse Ball (English Law, 1927), the Wolfson (Criminology, 1959), the Arthur Goodhart Visiting Professorship (1971), the Professorship of Law (1973) the S.J. Berwin (Corporate Law, 1991), the Professorship of Law (1992), the Herchel Smith Professorship of Intellectual Property Law (1993), and the Professorship of European Law (1994).

<H1><IMG SRC="/GIFS/SHIELD.GIF" ALIGN = MIDDLE>The modern Law Faculty</H1>
<BR>
There are at present thirteen professors (three of them holding <I>ad hominem</I> chairs), six readers, and nearly 60 other University, Faculty and college teaching officers.  They include specialists in almost every aspect of English law and its history, the laws of other countries (especially European), European Community law, public and private international law, Roman law, legal philosophy, and criminology.  A list of teaching members, with their principal research interests, is given below.<P>
At any one time around 7% of undergraduates are reading law.  The student body, which is one of the largest of any law school in the United Kingdom, comprises nearly 750 undergraduates and over 200 graduate students.  Graduates from the Faculty are prominent in academic life, in the judiciary, and in both branches of the legal profession.  Cambridge judicial alumni include a former President as well as a current member of the International Court of Justice, two former judges of the European Court of Justice, the Lord Chief Justice, and several members of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords and of the Court of Appeal.<P>

<H1><IMG SRC="/GIFS/SHIELD.GIF" ALIGN = MIDDLE>The Centre for European Legal Studies(CELS) </H1>

Since 1991 the Centre for European Legal Studies (CELS) has provided a new focus in the Cambridge Law Faculty for activities in the field of European Community Law and European Comparative Law.  Consistently with the traditions of the Faculty, the interests of the Centre embrace not only the new legal order which, since the 1950s, has been evolving on the basis of the European Community Treaties but also the national jurisdictions of the different European countries, including those of the former Eastern Bloc, and their relationship with the common law.<P>
The main concerns of CELS are to encourage individual and collaborative research of the highest international quality on matters falling within its remit and, through a programme of lectures and seminars, to disseminate knowledge and understanding of those matters among the academic and the wider community.  Participation in its work by distinguished specialists from outside Cambridge has been facilitated through the establishment of Visiting Fellowships.  <P>
CELS is also playing a leading part in developing the study of the common law and European Community Law in Poland and other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, by helping to organise teaching on the spot, as well as a distance-learning programme.  It is active in arranging exchange schemes for staff and students between Cambridge and the other leading Law Schools of Europe.<P>

<BR>
At Cambridge all first-degree courses, in whatever subject, lead to the B.A. Degree with Honours.  In order to qualify for this degree, an undergraduate must pass two "Tripos" examinations.  (The word Tripos is derived from the three-legged stool used in former times at B.A. examinations.)  These do not have to be in the same subject, and it is therefore possible to read a combination of two different subjects, taking them separately and in sequence; at present about 50 students every year change to law from other subjects.  <P>
There are three Law Tripos examinations: Part IA, Part IB and Part II.  Law IA and Law IB cannot be counted as two separate Tripos examinations to qualify for the B.A.  Law IA is taken at the end of the first year of residence.  Law IB is taken in the second year by those who have passed Law IA, or by those changing into law from another Tripos.  Law II is only for those who have passed Law IB.  The B.A. requires three years of residence (two in the case of Affiliated Students, i.e. graduates of another university).  There is also a further option of a two-year Part II in which one year is spent in a Continental law school as part of the qualification for the B.A. Degree.  <P>
Each Tripos is assessed by a board of examiners, assisted by assessors, who between them arrange the successful candidates into three classes, the second class being subdivided into upper and lower categories; a particularly good first class candidate may be awarded a mark of distinction.  Because of the nature of the Tripos system, there is no combined examination result at the end of the course; each year of study is classed separately, and the B.A. itself is not classed.<P>
 The undergraduate law course at Cambridge is intended to give a thorough grounding in the principles of law viewed from an academic rather than a vocational perspective.  The emphasis is on principle and technique, reasoning and explanation.  There are opportunities to study the history of law, and to consider the subject in its wider social context.  Although most undergraduates who read law do so with the intention of practising, the course also provides an excellent broad education for those who do not.<P>
For further details about Tripos courses, and admission to read for the B.A. Degree, see the University of Cambridge Undergraduate Prospectus (obtainable from the Cambridge Intercollegiate Applications Office, Kellet Lodge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QJ.  Tel: 01223-333308).  For law in particular, see the Law Faculty's Information for Prospective Undergraduate Students (obtainable from the Faculty Office).<P>

</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1><IMG SRC="/GIFS/SHIELD.GIF" ALIGN = MIDDLE>The LL.M. Degree.  </H1>
<BR>
The LL.M. Degree in its present form was introduced in 1981 to replace the LL.B. (which in Cambridge was a postgraduate degree).  It is awarded to successful candidates in the LL.M. examination which is taken at the end of a one-year taught course.  It consists of four papers assessed by means of written examination or written examination and essay; one of the four papers may instead be taken by thesis.  <P>
The examination is classed in a similar way to the <A HREF="BA.HTM">Tripos</A>; a candidate of exceptional merit in English law and legal history may be awarded the Chancellor's Medal for English Law (founded by Prince Albert in 1855).  Candidates for the LL.M. must have some suitable qualification in law, usually a law degree, and must be accepted for the course both by the Faculty and by a <A HREF="COLLEGES.HTM">college</A>.  <P>
For further details about the LL.M. course, and the method of application (which is through the Board of Graduate Studies), see the Law Faculty's Information for Prospective Graduate Students (obtainable from the Faculty Office).  The closing date for applications is 31 January in the year in which an applicant intends to begin the course.<P>

<H2>The M.Litt. and the Ph.D</H2>
<BR>
There are two degrees awarded on the basis of supervised research, the M.Litt. and the Ph.D.  Research students are not in the first instance registered for the M.Litt. or Ph.D. but are automatically registered for a one-year research training programme leading to the Certificate of Postgraduate Study in Legal Studies.  They are assigned a supervisor by the Degree Committee of the Faculty, and at the end of their first year the Committee decides whether they should be registered for a degree, and if so whether for the M.Litt. or the Ph.D.  <P>
The M.Litt. is awarded after two years of research on the basis of a dissertation not exceeding 60,000 words.  The Ph.D. is awarded after three years of research on the basis of a dissertation not exceeding 80,000 words.  In each case there is an oral examination by the two examiners of the dissertation.<P>
For further details about applications to undertake research, see the University of Cambridge Graduate Studies Prospectus (obtainable from the Board of Graduate Studies, 4 Mill Lane, Cambridge, CB2 1RZ.  Tel: 01223-338394/95), and the Law Faculty's Information for Prospective Graduate Students (obtainable from the Faculty Office).
<BR>
<HR>
<H2>The LL.D.</H2>
<BR> 
The LL.D. is awarded to established scholars who have given "proof of distinction by some original contribution to the advancement of the science or study of law", almost invariably in the form of published works.  The University also has the power to confer an Honorary LL.D. on a person of distinction; Cambridge lawyers on whom this degree has been conferred in recent years include Sir Robin Cooke, Sir Robert Jennings, Lord Lane, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, Lord Mackenzie-Stuart, Lord Oliver and Lord Richardson of Duntisbourne.

<HEAD><TITLE> The Squire Law Library</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1><IMG SRC="/GIFS/SHIELD.GIF" ALIGN = MIDDLE>The Squire Law Library</H1>
<BR>
The Squire Law Library is one of the largest university law libraries in this country.  It was founded out of a bequest from Miss Rebecca Flower Squire which enabled the Faculty Board of Law, at the turn of the century, to erect a new Faculty building and Library in Downing Street.  The original Library was opened on 1 March, 1904 by King Edward VII.  In 1935, when the new University Library was built, the Law Faculty moved from Downing Street into the buildings previously occupied by the University Library in the Old Schools.  The Law Library was transferred to the north buildings designed by C. R. Cockerell and built between 1837 and 1840.  It began as a Faculty library and, although in 1982 it became part of the University Library, it has its own Librarian and is governed by a special Sub-Syndicate of the Library Syndicate.<P>
The Library holds over 130,000 volumes (including about 1,300 current serial titles) and provides seats for over 500 readers.  The Library is open to every member of the University; borrowing is not permitted since it is intended to be in constant use as a reference collection but most of the holdings are on open access.  <P>
The Library has received several major benefactions over the years, including books from the libraries of Dr H. J. Roby, Professor E. C. Clark, Professor W. W. Buckland, Professor H. D. Hazeltine and Professor Sir Ivor Jennings, Commonwealth materials purchased through the Smuts Memorial Fund, and medico-legal materials purchased through the Ver Heyden de Lancey Fund.  The Library has also received generous grants from the City Solicitors' Educational Trust and the Isaac Newton Trust for the support of the European collection.  There are good specialist collections in international law, legal history, comparative law, and Roman law, and the Library maintains the American National Reporter System and the law reports of most Commonwealth countries.<P>

Chairman of the Law Sub-Syndicate: Professor J. Crawford, Jesus College.<P>
In addition, most colleges have their own law libraries, and there is a law collection (including rare books and official publications) in the main University Library.<P>

<BR>
In 1991 the University gave its approval for the construction of a new Law Faculty building in West Road, designed by Sir Norman Foster and Partners, subject to the necessary funding being obtained.  Building work commenced in July 1993 is now complete.  The building brings together on one site the Squire Law Library, the Faculty's lecture and seminar rooms, the administrative offices, and common-room facilities; it has doubled the shelf capacity of the library, increased the space for readers and provides a focus for Faculty activities, such as formal meetings, informal gatherings, and moots.  There is a separate scheme to rehouse the Institute of Criminology.<P>
Initially, in order to raise funds for the building project, but also to increase the teaching and research strength of the Faculty and to improve the holdings of the Squire Law Library, the Faculty launched an appeal.  The first fruits of the appeal are the S. J. Berwin Professorship, four new junior posts, the Beckwith benefaction and a Professorship in Intellectual Property Law generously endowed by Dr Herchel Smith in 1993.  The establishment of a Centre for European Legal Studies in 1991 is mentioned below.<P>
The Law appeal is one of the key projects selected by the University for priority in its fund-raising.  It is managed by an Appeal Director, assisted by the University Development Office and a Faculty Appeal Committee.<P>
Appeal Director: Professor <STRONG>J. Beatson</STRONG>, St John's College.  (Tel: [College] 01223-338673; [Faculty] 01223-330033.)<P>
Potential benefactors are encouraged to contact Professor Beatson or Mr C. Hesketh, Development Officer, University Development Office, 10 Trumpington Street, Cambridge CB2 1QA.  (Tel: 01223-332288. Fax: 01223-460817.)
