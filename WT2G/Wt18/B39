<H3><center>INVOLVING THE COMMUNITY </center></H3>
<center>Lindsey Taylor, Director,
The Evergreen Foundation</center>
<p>
<p>

 
<p>Involving the community in your project will without hesitation be the make or
break factor in the project. The community will be what will sustain your project
beyond the first few years when initial excitement may have subsided.

<p>When we speak of community we are talking about the immediate school community
and the surrounding area, which includes: teachers school board parents elders in
the neighbourhood -	community centers -	church groups etc....

<p>It will become important to develop a system by which people can involve
themselves in the process to develop a sense of ownership to the project.

<p>Steps to follow to effectively generate support and involvement from the
community:
 <UL> <LI>1. Develop a comprehensive draft plan for the project that
includes details and timeline for the planting. This information will be your
communicator for the project and will be a place for people to start to begin
generating ideas.

<LI>2. Involve all community people in the process up front. Put notices around
the neighbourhood inviting people to join in on initial meetings and plans.

<LI>3. Promote the project to local papers telling people what your plans are and
asking for support and supplies. Better yet develop a newsletter that goes out to
keep people updated (perhaps this could be a class activity).

<LI>4. Once all ideas have been collected put together a comprehensive ( doesn't
have to be fancy) project plan so all can understand the stages of the project
and what is going on - with goals and objectives clearly stated.

<LI>5. Develop responsibility list and form groups or committees.

<LI>6. Key is to get commitment up front from your school to integrate the
project with the curriculum - if this is opposed the project will have a
difficult time surviving long term.

<LI>7. Other ways to keep the project active within the community is through
summer programs, after school programming, develop programs that allow outside
groups to have ownership to the site as well.

<LI>8. Always reward your volunteer support - find creative solutions for this
that do not require finances. </UL>

Things to be aware of:
 <UL> <LI>develop your project in stages so that you do not
overwhelm yourself or others 
<LI>check out liability policies with your school
district and involve your school board from the very beginning
 <LI>inquire with
your school board regarding maintenance 
<LI>vandalism </UL>

<H3><center>GLEANINGS FROM WORKSHOPS IN SOUTHERN ONTARIO</center></H3>
<center>Henry Kock, Horticultural Interpreter</center>
 <center>The Arboretum, University of Guelph</center>
<p>


<p>I would like to acknowledge Carolinian Canada Land Protection and Stewardship
Program, and co-author Steven Aboud in the publishing of A Life Zone Approach to
School Yard Naturalization. The development of this document made possible a
study tour and five one-day experiential workshops in Southwestern Ontario.

<p>The theme of this presentation is:  With community involvement, the school
yard project will "leap over" the school yard fence.

<p>To accelerate this process, we must come to terms with the human-centered
landscape: the cause of significant fragmentation and destruction of this earth's
life-support system.  I would affirm that the school yard is one of the most
important places through which the landscape of the human mind can be changed.
Children and adults experience significant attitude and behaviour responses in
relation to changes in landscape.

<p>Today's adults and children have inherited a world in turmoil.  In Southern
Ontario’s deciduous forest life zone, or Carolinian Canada, some 25 per cent of
Canadians live on one per cent of Canada's land. The average forest cover left in
Southern Ontario is about 15 per cent and we have the nerve to say that cutting
and burning forests for agriculture and clearing up to 15 per cent of Brazilian
rain forest produce  an environmental catastrophe!

<p>A goal worthy of developing is the demonstration of expansion and linkage of
the forest fragments, not just to "discover" nature, but to learn how to live
within it. Another "R" to ponder is Re-Inhabitation ... learning to live in our
place. Freeman House writes beautifully on this theme in Turtle Talk, 1990,
Christopher Plant (editor).  Students need the opportunity to be part of an
expanding landscape so that they can personally experience how hedgerows and
"linear forests" connect forest fragments to accommodate biological function.
Through becoming familiar with, and comfortable in, natural elements, students
and teachers begin to discover the value of the natural landscape.

<p>Also, the role of trees needs to be more fully understood.  The valuable role
of vegetation, and trees, in particular, in climate moderation and soil/water
protection is often overlooked.  Trees also filter the wind and play a major role
in the reduction of ground-level wind speed.

<p>The loss of vegetation cover anywhere is significant in relation to the role
of plants in moisture retention of the earth and climate moderation. When trees
and other vegetation are removed, the land is exposed and heat buildup causes
strong thermals and an increase in heavy rainfall. The force and intensity of the
raindrops dislodges tons of soil each year; the outcome is not just the loss of
soil but also the dropping of the water table as much of the rain-water drains
directly into ditches and storm-water systems. The tops of trees die first as
desertification processes advance. Jarmo, the archaeological site of the "first"
agricultural civilization in what was known as the "fertile crescent," is now in
the middle of a desert in present-day Iraq.

<p>Referring to his grade school experience, Bill Lucas spoke of the "hot air
rises" experiment which is particularly appropriate in understanding climate
moderation. All forms of vegetation transpire, releasing moisture from the leaves
to keep them cool; a large tree can deliver up to 500 litres of water into the
air during a hot windy day. Moisture-laden air does not heat or cool as rapidly
as dry air and thus reduces the severity of storm systems by reducing the
strength of thermals.

<p>In practice, the cumulative effect of hundreds of corridor plantings that
reconnect woodlots in Southern Ontario will be a significant component of
sustainable agriculture. Windbreaks, riparian (stream bank) planting and linear
forest corridors fit within existing land use and settlement patterns and, rather
than remove cropland from production, they improve the yield on the cultivated
land, increasing the net returns for farmers.

<p>An urban application of these ideas is of value since more than 90 per cent of
Canadians live in cities.

<p>The streets and parks of today's cities are dominated by the destructive
over-reliance on the private automobile. Separate zoning has caused a sprawling
growth that makes walking impossible and public transit non-functional. There is
great potential, through mixed zoning design and full-cost payment for automobile
infrastructure, to reduce automobile dependence. Associated with the health
benefits resulting from a reduction in the number of private vehicles, our
streets, parks and school yards will be filled with corridors of trees again, and
urban vegetation centres ... real parks, not parking lots. Essentially a process
wherein dignity and respect are nurtured.

<p>We are just now planting the seeds to enrich our common destiny and we are not
sure what kind of creative adults this will produce. We may yet discover the true
meaning of civilization.

<p>Slides were used to illustrate the rest of the presentation.

<p>Through successful school yard projects, one of the important outcomes for
students is experiencing nature in a passive way on a daily basis, rather than
only by an activity-related program on the rare field trip. A school yard nursery
at Aberfoyle Public School, near Guelph, is raising trees that are later planted
along county roads. At Manor and Highland Public School in London, students have
obtained parental liability waivers so that they can study and explore an oxbow
of the Thames River.

<p>At Ossington Old Orchard Public School in Toronto, a landscape paradise has
been created where previously the creek had been filled in and the area paved
from fence to fence. Ossington had had a declining enrollment, but now has a long
waiting list of parents eager for their children to be in this gentler place. It
has taken a few years, but the teachers have learned to use the school yard to
significantly enhance their programs. At Ossington Old Orchard Public School, a
significant area is planted in woodland and meadow, but I personally found very
exciting the extensive vegetable garden and orchard. I saw that the community
might understand nature does not have to be completely eliminated in order to
grow food. This ultimately demonstrates the resolution of a 9,000-year war
against nature that has pushed nature aside for human-initiated development and
created deserts out of Paradise.

<p>Projects in Ontario will be complementing activities in other parts of the
world. In Costa Rica, the 13-year-old project, Arbofilia, has restored viable
agriculture by planting linear forests along the watersheds and fields to slow
down the wind on the once-flourishing but recently barren western slopes of the
coastal mountains. In Kenya, the green belt movement is planting linear forests
from trees grown by women in village nurseries. They produce shade and valuable
firewood while protecting the land. The Great Green Wall in China is planted to
stop the advancing desert.

<p>Butterfly gardens, mini-forests and some large meadows have been initiated by
Ontario schools; most school yards are still relatively barren. Trees were once
considered the enemy of man, but we now understand that we cannot live without
the green plant world and the animals that share this earth's self-balancing food
web. Planting native plants is appropriate for restoration-type efforts. However,
most Canadians are not native, and plants from Europe and Asia have their place
in our cultured landscape as well. This is not a form of botanical racism -- just
a gentle plea for diversity.

<p>These are but a few examples of efforts today that have gone beyond what Frank
Glew referred to as the “apathy line.” Using wisdom to put knowledge into action
is a great way to build self-esteem and a wonderful introduction to living with
dignity and grace.

<p>"When the earth is ravaged and the animals are dying, a group of people from
all races will gather to put their faith in action and not words. They will be
called the rainbow warriors, protectors of the earth."     -Hopi prophesy


<H4><p>TOUR PROGRAM, THE ARBORETUM</H4>


<p>A full busload of Learning Grounds participants were divided into two groups:
one led by Steven Aboud, botanist and Coordinator of Interpretive Programs, and
the other by Henry Kock, horticultural interpreter. They were introduced to
interpretations or ways of "reading" the natural and cultural landscape.

<p>The Arboretum has many plant collections within a natural vegetation matrix.
Learning Grounds participants had the opportunity to explore plant family
relationships in The World of Trees and to get a feel for genetic diversity in
the Gene Bank plantings of Ontario's rarest trees. Several examples of planted
regeneration and corridor plantings, ranging from three to 15 years of age,
helped participants realize what they can expect from some of their own
initiatives.

<p>The leaders gave examples that demonstrated the principle objective in the
resource manual, A Life Zone Approach to School Yard Naturalization: expanding
existing natural areas and linking the fragments. The Memorial Forest is a
partnership project with the Wall-Custance Funeral Home and Chapel in Guelph that
enables the continued planting of shelter corridors throughout The Arboretum to
link the original forest fragments.

<p>Natural areas visited included a walk through a trembling aspen grove showing
a succession by invasion into grassland, ash and cherry replacement of
middle-aged aspen, and old growth maple/ash forest with decaying aspen logs on
the ground. The tour took them on a path inside and through the length of an old
hedgerow to demonstrate how these function as a wildlife corridor and wind
shelter. The groups were introduced to the value of meadow ecosystems by
discovering the presence of meadow voles (field mice) and realizing that the
foxes, owls and hawks need meadows as food sources. The presence of trees from
which all of the bark at the base had been eaten indicated the role of the meadow
vole (and other herbivores) as "keeper of the meadow."

<p>One of the highlights was a tour of the Gosling Wildlife Gardens at The
Arboretum. These five backyard-size parcels of land, from small city lot to
suburban property, were planted to attract wildlife. The combined efforts in a
neighbourhood create greater opportunities for diverse animal life within the
urban forest. The gardens are home to many species and includes dragonflies,
toads, rabbits, songbirds, butterfly larvae and butterflies. These gardens of
shade trees, shrub thickets and hedges, flower boarders, meadows and prairie are
a constant source of inspiration and ideas for  visitors.

<p>The Arboretum is open every day from dawn to dusk. There is no admission
charge, but donations are always welcome. For information on guided group tours,
please call (519) 824-4120 ext. 4110.

<p>
<H3><center>THE ROUND TABLE ON LEARNING GROUNDS

</center></H3>
<center>Ralph Ingleton, Retired Education Consultant, North York;
 Ingleton Consulting Ltd</center>
<p>
<p>


<p>The session was attended by 45 participants divided into 4 round table groups.
Their task was to examine issues, problems, concerns related to learning grounds
and to work towards a consensus as to what is required to move the idea forward. 
Each group was given the same set  of questions to help guide their discussion. 
Each group had a  facilitator and a recorder.  Total time for discussion was 50
minutes.

<p>What does Learning Grounds mean to you? What name do you give it?

<p>Responses: <p>Learning Grounds means:
 <br>Plants and grass instead of asphalt,
a new way to look at beautification 
<br>Opportunities to see and be part of
nature, connecting  relationships within the 	environment
 <br>Opportunities to
envision possibilities for the space and to meet a variety of needs <br>Seating
space, quiet areas, less institutional, a softer learning environment <br>Long
term planning and long term planting, accepting evolution as a fact  for the area
<br>A place to demonstrate and reinforce positive values which connect learning
to 	observation <br>Positively relating to the space and to each other
<br>Providing for a variety of learning and play experiences leading to
stewardship and 	attitude change, helps children get along <br>A direct and
positive opportunity to involve the community <br>Learning from the landscape
means learning to understand our environment <br>Breaking out of the classroom
but connecting to curriculum <br>Being surprised, creating a sense of wonder
through seasonal change

<p>What has been your involvement in the Learning Grounds concept?

<p>Responses came from a variety of roles represented by teachers, consultants,
parents, and administrators.  Their involvement demonstrated a wide variety of
projects, including: <br>Carolinian forest project, nature trail, wildflower and
meadow gardens, and dealing 	with non-native species. <br>School yard
rehabilitation projects <br>Need to create more healthy play areas <br>To
beautify the school and develop pride <br>To invite wildlife to the school
through habitat creation <br>To create an outdoor classroom <br>In response to
the board's policy on naturalization, we created a naturalized area <br>Belief
that we must learn from our local biosphere <br>Parents wanted a more natural
school yard

<p>What problems have you encountered in establishing your project?

<p>Responses: <br>Most round table groups did not see problems, but challenges.
<br>Lack of what to do and how, led to networking in community and beyond
<br>Although we had little help from other teachers, the administration or
maintenance 	department, we just kept pushing because we know its right
<br>Need to educate administration before starting <br>Vandalism of site, plants
taken or destroyed : "replace, replace, involve and educate" <br>Community
ownership is key to reducing and eliminating vandalism. <br>Build credibility
through good planning, enthusiasm and hard work <br>Use Ministry of Education
policies and those of the Ontario Trustees Council to give 	credibility to
projects <br>Most projects are conceived in grand terms, keep it small, simple
and low maintenance .  	These projects cost less, are easier to handle, are
less threatening <br>Soils should be checked, know what soils you have and their
condition <br>Poor, compacted soils are a challenge <br>Suit the task to the
crew: solutions to site tasks must be doubled <br>Do not plan too specifically ;
the site has a mind of its own and will change <br>Sustainability, do not impose
where it does not belong <br>Provision for water often a challenge <br>Class
management is different outdoors, so plan and organize before going to the site
<br>Take stock of the project site, what worked, what didn't, what needs to be
changed <br>Long term sustainability and use, means working with others in the
community who 	are committed and giving the site the attention it  deserves to
bring rewards of its being <br>School Board support is essential for
sustainability <br>Get seniors and others such as garden clubs involved

<p>What kinds of activities are best to help others become involved ?

<p>Responses: <br>Find out who would like to become involved with a
naturalization or garden project 	and approach them (ie. teachers,
administration, a landscape design school, master 	gardeners etc.) <br>Start a
seed growing program in class and then plan for planting on the school
	grounds <br>Focus on growing plants and branch out to include other teachers
who want to plan 	jointly <br>Link the project to earth day, arbor day, or
other special occasions <br>Plan for joint teaching with community people who
have expertise <br>Develop a clear simple plan that is easy to present to
anyone-complex plans are scary <br>Visit organic farms to learn from their
experience <br>Invite known organizations in to make presentations at the school
on naturalization and 	gardening <br>Make a joint presentation to the Board of
Education on naturalization and link the 	concept to existing policies and
curriculum <br>Promote the program by involving students, parents, businesses,
the board and the 	local media (both newspapers and TV) <br>Learn the possible
funding sources including PTA-many parents now are 	concerned about skin
cancer and advocate tree planting <br>Funders need a clear plan to use approve
funding (most funders have a screening 	committee who make recommendations)

<p>What specific policies should institutions and organizations adopt to make the
movement flourish?

<p>Responses: <br>Educate those in the decision-making roles  about the benefits
of adopting a policy to 	naturalize their grounds <br>The common curriculum
outcomes mandate regeneration  projects <br>Implementation of Learning grounds is
seen as a positive force to bring pride to the 	school as well as providing
real-life opportunities for direct  learning <br>Parks and municipalities are now
passing policies on regeneration and naturalization;	obtain these policies and
use them to present to the Board Of Education for 	consideration <br>As many
schools border parks, push for joint planning for naturalization <br>Before any
policy is made, unions, administration, parents, students and Board 	members
must be involved in deciding the future involvement of school grounds
<br>Naturalization can reduce maintenance costs after year 2, but should not  be
the 	reason to do a project- the benefits must be thought of as long term and
evolving <br>Guidance for policy making can come from other school boards and
organizations such 	as the Evergreen Foundation and the Ontario Parks
Association <br>Use "Learning Grounds" network as to obtain help and advice
<br>Visits to successful projects by decision-makers will help them to determine
policy 	direction in their jurisdictions

<p>General conclusions: <br>Get more people on our side: trustees, local
politicians and parents <br>Awareness of the benefits of learning grounds, means
educating administration and 	others <br>Link to existing policies and
curriculum <br>Promote, plan, start small, implement, then celebrate (your heart
must be in it) <br>There is no substitute for good information and expertise-get
it and use it

<center>or</center> <BR>
A NON-UTOPIAN VISION OF NATURAL PLAYSPACES FOR CHILDREN 
AND YOUTH</font size="+1">
<BR>
<center>GARY PENNINGTON, The University of British Columbia</center>

<P>
<P>
	My role here is not as an expert but more as someone wanting to share and learn with you  the kinds of playspaces and learning environments we want for our children.  I teach at a university, yet these are the least of my qualifications.  More significantly, I am a father of seven kids and thus a practical person in terms of how to deal with the playspaces of the young.  I descend from the ivory tower as often as possible and try to communicate with people at the community level.  One of the things that I am proud of doing is going back to my old elementary school and working there with people to make better playspaces for children.  Also, contrary to my language and appearance, I am a "dead end kid", which gives me other qualifications to talk on this topic.  So I ask you not to think of me as an ivory tower, pie in the sky elitist, because I try not to be.  I think of things in very practical terms.
	<P>
	I have entitled my talk a "Non-Utopian Vision of Natural Playspaces" which means a practical, realizable vision, rather than a remote, idealistic notion which cannot be achieved.  I envision the following times and places with respect to natural playspaces for our children and youth:
<P>

SUPPORT AND INITIATIVE -  A time when urban planners, architects, engineers, university professors, landscape architects, local government officials, planning authorities, lawyers, insurance assessors, public works staff and other involved professionals shed their bureaucratic cloaks to enthusiastically support play initiatives at the local neighbourhood level.
<P>
	Now, if this part of my vision is a problem for some of you, I think we should define "bureaucracy".  Bureaucracy flourishes when we get so wound up in our systems that we function for secondary reasons rather than because of our original goals; when we act for personal gain or organizational reputation rather than from a service ethic.  I submit that we don't really want that model of compliance, yet somehow this way of operating becomes the form in government and other sectors of life.
	<P>
	What I see happening in terms of providing play environments is that things frequently get accomplished when agencies, such as local government, get pressured to the point that they simply have to  respond.  In this scenario, elected officials go to their professional staff and they, in turn, act in an attempt to reduce public pressure.  In providing play areas, officials feel that if they have to provide them they might as well be safe, durable, visible and colourful in order to maximize political benefit.  However, factors such as color and community visibility are not adequate reasons for building playgrounds.  Let's break with that political and reactionary tradition and say this kind of response just isn't good enough.  Rather, we need to support local initiatives and people at the community level to enable them to do things rather than putting obstacles in their way.

<P>
COMMERCIAL ROLE - A time when manufacturers of commercial play equipment elect to work in concert with voluntary and government agencies and community groups to achieve a balance between adult devised play equipment and the many more natural play settings to which children naturally gravitate.
<P>
	Today, throughout the world, there is an unspoken struggle between what equipment manufacturers produce and what children really need.  There is a need to reconcile such issues. We don't need the confrontation/consultation model that is so prevalent.  Confrontation doesn't work well and consultation isn't very effective either.  Consultation generally means that we go to "the man" or "the woman" to give them our ideas which they take away and deal with; often, this is our last part in the exercise.  In a hierarchy of community involvement, consultation does not rank highly.  What is needed, indeed, is active cooperation,  and places and times where this active cooperation to overcome problems and resolve issues related to play and the environment becomes the norm rather than the exception.
<P>

CULTURE - Places where the play worlds of the young are reflective of the language and lore of our rich literary, cultural and mythological traditions.
<P>
	What this really means is that we need to have a context for what we do with children. We can't plonk play equipment down in a flat area and think that we are doing anything significant in children's lives.  We have great children's literature, such as The Secret Garden, as well as poetry related to children's play.  There is a whole branch of literature that we should draw upon in developing and integrating the play of children with other aspects of life.
	<P>
	Also, we must avoid an ethnocentric view of the world in respect to play.  Canada, along with other developed countries, has generally emasculated the cultures of its indigenous and immigrant peoples so that we don't see ethnically diverse cultural forms in our playgrounds and parks.  However, better ways of dealing with racial prejudice and stereotyping are emerging. The play and playground movement should be part of this new awakening.  There are many multicultural activities, forms, models, and symbols that we could adopt in our play environments if we resolved to do so.
<P>

VALUES - Playspaces where standardization, safety, efficiency and other utilitarian values are blended more appropriately with creative endeavour, aesthetic appreciation, adventure and humanistic values.
<P>
	I envision play spaces where trees and flowers are just as important as nuts and bolts, and where risk and adventure are recognized as being important parts of children's lives.  In this respect, public education is critical.  A lot of things are perpetrated and perpetuated simply because people are very uniformed concerning the values of play.  Adults will go down to local parks and say, "Isn't that new equipment nice!" and will not have a broader knowledge of what play for children is all about.  So, we need to have a network and alliances of people to talk to the masses who are not quite as privileged as we are, in order to clarify what play is really about.  This is necessary if we are to do well in our advocacies and efforts for children, because an understanding and appreciation of play and play environments breaks through to the community level.  When we all realize that, regardless of whether we are dealing with a kindergarten, a school or a backyard, we must have playspaces that really cater to the needs of children, then we will really have done something significant.
<P>	
	I would also like to mention that insurance regulations presently govern most of what is developed in public playspaces.  Insurance scams concerning premiums and coverage for playgrounds abound  in our country as in others.  Rates do not relate to the true costs of accidents, yet school and parks people are hiding behind these things in a state of naive ignorance. Insurance companies have capitalized on a modern-day paranoia regarding physical activity and public and personal liability.  There is a Senate Committee established in the United States to look into such issues.  It will likely take four or five years to get into the price-fixing dimensions of the playground insurance problem.  Simply put, insurance and liability concerns should not govern what we do with children and play.  Isolated accidents should not mean that everyone in the country lives in fear.
	<P>
	Another notion concerning this idea of values is that the whole history of the parks and recreation movement throughout the Western world has really been one of a hierarchical order where parks have come first and recreation second.  For example, when you walk through most botanical gardens, you don't dare touch or do anything there other than look and smell.  You have to be very careful of what you do.  We need interactive settings where kids are encouraged to touch, to smell,  and to pick four leaf clovers, where there are fragrant seeds and flowers, long grass to hide in, and so on. These kinds of settings will help foster play and inculcate the values we hold in common about childhood.
<P>

A CHILD'S WORLD - Places where our adult fixations about order, cleanliness and routine yield more frequently to young people's innate need for exploration, manipulation, messiness and the creation of their own particular sense of order.
<P>	I once had the privilege of talking with the late Lady Allen of Hurtwood.  For those of you who don't know her, she was the woman who established the adventure playground concept in England.  A favorite expression of hers was that adults have a strong desire for order and that children seem to abhor order and find secret order in their own messiness and in their own creations.  We have to learn to understand this distinction and to honor what children need and want.  Unfortunately, most recreational places are too manicured, and children and youth find no adventure nor challenge in such places.  They are almost as oppressive towards children's play as the massive high rise enclaves that now surround them.
<P>	
	The term "affluenza" has been used in talking about the needs of children.  This term originates from a psychologist in the USA.  It refers to the materialistic intrusion on the world of the child, where youngsters get too much too soon and ultimately don't appreciate anything.  I believe that it is critical that we re-examine our adult role in the lives of children with respect to the amount and the kinds of things which we provide for them.  If we do not, we may unwittingly be creating a new generation of materialistic, acquisitive, detached individuals who are unable to relate to the natural world around them.
<P>

COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT  - A time when collegiality, cooperation, and community involvement are the norm in creating playspaces.
<P>
	We sometimes debate the relative merits of building playgrounds at the community level. I am firmly convinced that process of building playspaces yields as many benefits and values as the actual product of the playground.  So here we have the process/product distinction that we often talk about, but so few of us actually apply in practice.  The concept of children as the builders of their own playspaces is another key component of community involvement.  When a child helps mom or dad build a structure she will always remember the creation of that structure; it was hers because she and her parents built it.  This is equally true with the planting of trees, flowers, shrubs and vegetables.
	<P>
	There is a particular irony at play in the schoolyard.  In Canada, most of our schoolyards are like prisons; they are terrible places.  They are tyrannized by too much sport, too little play, too much grass and too many goal posts.  I continually wonder why it is that we have a major transition from kindergarten, where we readily recognize the value of play, to a more formal school setting where children are mainly seat bound and really quite sedentary. After preschool and kindergarten we fail, I believe, to recognize the validity of play.
	<P>
	The ultimate irony is that we  are the only ones who can change this.  It is not them, it is us.  We can't indulge in the "we/they syndrome".  In our culture there are concepts called "participatory democracy" and "representational democracy".  The key question in this respect is whether or not our ability and our right to participate in the creation of our own immediate environment are fairly inalienable.  Bureaucratic erosion destroys such initiatives.  Those of us who work in bureaucratic agencies often unwittingly place obstacles in the way of people who want to do things such as create play spaces for children at the local level.  We create far too many channels that people have to go through in order to change things.  For example, if we approach a school or parks board official about a playground matter on the telephone and he or she puts us off, or discourages us, in my opinion, this person wouldn't be doing his or her job, but rather would be guilty of "bureaucratic erosion".  If we didn't have good language skills, organizational know-how, a high degree of conceptual clarity about children's play or much self-confidence, you can see how the problem would become compounded.  We should all function in an enabling role rather than an obstructionist one. Very simply, we should do all we possibly can to help people rather than to hinder them.  That is what our jobs are really about.
<P>

AUTHORITY - A time when what is best for children is decided by people who have studied play and worked with children in play settings; when play environments reflect our knowledge and wisdom rather than our fears of injury and litigation.
<P>
	Some of the questions about this part of the vision include:  Is play better today because of our standards, or not?  As people who design or use playspaces, do we ever get our hands dirty in actually building them?  Wouldn't it be great if all of us would spend at least half a day per week working practically in our areas of advocacy?  The benefits of working with people rather than doing things for them are enormous.  I've learned this over the course of a number of community development projects which have had play as their focus.  I  highly recommend this form of professional/lay partnership.
<P>
	The most important single question that we face in these affairs is, "Who really knows?" A man named Theodore Rosak raises this critical question.  I am sure that I  don't know what is best for a community; nor do Moura Quayle, Tara Cullis, any politician, group, or consultant. But together  we can know.  This distinction is key.  We simply have to believe it and live it.

<P>
EDUCATIONAL VALUE	- Places where children's need for play and adventure in natural settings which stimulate curiosity, imagination, problem solving, physical development and aesthetic appreciation are recognized as being equally as important as classroom forms of learning.
<P>
	Why do we have this educational dichotomy where what we learn and experience indoors is worthwhile and vital and yet what we do outside is considered to be trivial?  We have to deal with this issue.
<P>
ENVIRONMENTAL ETHIC - Playspaces which model and foster sound environmental practices, conservation rather than consumer ethics, and gentler relationships between people.
<P>
	The two major global issues which confront us today are peace and the environment.  I have a hard time continuing to live in Vancouver because it has become such a violent place. Many people don't dare walk on their city streets on a warm summer evening.  It's tragic.  In our playspaces, in natural, softer playsettings, we can foster some of the values that we are in danger of losing.  We must find ways to encourage environmental ethics and co-operative values and we can do at least some of this through provision of more natural play experiences.
	<P>
	"Harried adults make harried children," is a remark I overheard the other day which I think is appropriate to the kind of society we are becoming.  Again, we have a chance to change these negative trends and part of the change resides in the formative play experiences of our children.
<P>

PLAY LEADERSHIP -Places in which play leadership and human resources are valued on at least the same level as the provision of a rich and varied physical environment.
<P>
	Playgrounds today, for the most part, lack human resources.  We either provide no play leadership at all or we employ seasonal and part-time workers who for the most part are the least qualified to work with children in play settings.  It's obvious we have to do something about the issue of play leadership.  Administrators and bureaucrats who control the parks and recreation and school budgets have a responsibility to do something about this problem.  The rest of us have to help them.
<P>

SPECIAL NEEDS - Special places where older youth and teenagers play and create in non-competitive modes and with qualified youth leadership, where the needs of disabled and disadvantaged children are met.
<P>	We went to a skateboard area in South Australia some time ago; there were a lot of risks and great adventure to be had there.  Yet there were no girls, nor gender equality.  We need to get our equal opportunity office busy on this one.  "Project Adventure" in the U.S. is one project which is aimed at the needs of youth on a gender equitable basis.  We need to look at this program and others as models.
<P>	
	A colleague in our faculty once said, "Gary, in that garden you are building at the University, you must create some different textures and sounds for the blind children who may go there."  We tried to do just that.  Some of us are trying to do these things in our own workplaces.  I just wouldn't feel comfortable coming here to suggest things to you if I wasn't working to change things in my own workplace.
<P>

TECHNOLOGY - A time when we balance technocentric thinking about children's play with the fact that play by its very nature defies rigid classification and requires us to be creative, artistic, flexible and adaptive.
<P>
	A constant "art versus science" debate has gone on throughout the last century in all parts of society.  In education and in parks and recreation, the question is simply whether play is an artistic or a scientific and manageable enterprise.  While we must have some reasonable standards and policies, play is not quantifiable and predictable but rather a magical array of things that children indulge in.  We, as adults, have to provide these magical places where children can do things. We can't be technophobic, or afraid of technology, but we can't be technocentric either.  We must be somewhere in the middle.  It's like bad art.  If you have paintings on black velvet at home they are usually not of the greatest quality.  Someone has done them really quickly and for mercenary reasons.  That's called representative realism. Philosophers tell us that this is not real art, it is quick-fix art or representative realism, meaning a kind of painting by numbers.  Quick-fix playgrounds are not what we should be about either.
	<P>
	These are my particular visions, hopefully they are not too distant from yours.  I would like to leave you with one last vision: 
<P>

WHERE A CHILD CAN TRULY PLAY - A very special place to retreat from the hectic, noisy world of other children and adults. 
 <P>
	Somewhere I can sit and share secrets with my best friend.  Somewhere I can walk through the moist grass, look for four leaf clovers, smell and pick wild flowers, watch bumble bees and butterflies, and test a buttercup under my chin.  Discover the prickle of blackberry bushes and the joy of their dark fruit.  A hill to roll and laugh down.  A favorite apple tree whose coarse bark I love to touch and whose branches I climb to build my tree house and from which I hang my tire swing.  A small brook to float leaves down, where I can quench my thirst with dripping hands on a hot summer day and  feel the agony and ecstasy of cold water on my ankles, and if lucky, which I can dam to make a harbour for my boats. Beautiful fragrances, strange textures, creepy-crawlies and the choir of bird songs.  My own cubby.  A fence to balance on and a great gnarled old tree root to hide things in and to imagine as my bewitching, magical hideaway.  Overgrown and mysterious trellises and arbours.  A spot to build things out of bits and pieces.   A place to lie in the shade and read.  Another where I can turn upside down and do cartwheels and handstands.  A wall for ball throwing.  Real fruit and veggies that I helped plant and tend, and sometimes even a small fresh carrot to pick, chew and savour.  Somewhere to ride my old bike.  Sand and dirt to pile and bury things in.  A gentle place where I feel safe to meet and work with my friends, to try new things, to hang around, to create, to play and to dream.
	<P>
	I hope you've been able to follow some of my ideas.  I would like to talk with many of you throughout today.  Thank you for the opportunity to share my visions with you.

DIANE FOSTER, International Playground Consultant</center>

<P>
<P>




	I have been professionally involved in the field of children's play since 1978, first as a Recreation Leader for the South Australian Education Department, then as a Play and Playgrounds Advisor for the Playgrounds Association and Government of South Australia.   I was also a member of the Working Party for Australian Standards for Play Equipment, Chair of the National Safety Council for South Australia, and a committee member of  the Australian Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation. Currently, I am a self-employed play 
consultant.
	<P>
	In my work in Australia, it was my responsibility to advise community and school groups on all aspects of safety and design of playspaces using the Australian Safety Guidelines.  During my tenure with the Playgrounds Association and South Australian Government I conducted over 500 detailed safety inspections of children's play environments.  I also wrote a book entitled Adelaide's Playgrounds.
	<P>
	Designing a playspace can be a frustrating and time-consuming job unless bureaucrats in the system look for ways to assist playspace planners, community volunteers and sponsors.  All those involved should work co-operatively to ensure that safe and challenging playspaces are developed.  Unfortunately, the children's need for challenging play opportunities is in many cases, not addressed because of undue concerns regarding safety and liability.
	<P>
	The two most denied play opportunities for all children in playspaces are water and sand.  Many reasons are given by playspace managers for this omission.  It is said that with water children will drown, get wet, and that water is too messy and cannot be controlled in a school or park situation.  It is also claimed that sand is equally messy, that animals will soil the sandbox, and that syringes, glass and other dangerous objects can be buried in the sand.  These are valid fears and yet they can be overcome by use of the Canadian Guidelines when designing for sand and water play. 
	<P>
Appendix A, "Supervised Play Opportunities," gives very clear guidelines regarding water play.  It includes the following points:
<P>
"When possible, play areas should provide access to water to promote creative, social, and intellectual (cognitive) development.  Play facilities that encourage playing with water are recommended.  These could take the form of play streams, water channels, faucets, or manual pumps.  Facilities for playing in water are recommended for consideration and include wading pools and spray pool areas."  A3.3.1 Types of Water Play Areas, page 74.
<P>
Also included in the design criteria regarding water play are guidelines for water depth, surfaces around water play areas, the quality and drainage of water and recommended ways of controlling the flow of water.  
	<P>
	The following sections are pertinent selections from "A Guideline on Children's Playspaces and Equipment," A National Standard of Canada.  I believe these guidelines are appropriate to use when working with school and community groups to develop playspaces for children and youth:
<P>
1.  "Vegetation and other landscape elements should be used to create an appropriate setting for play that is appealing to and usable by children".  6.2.1. Natural Topography, page 17.
<P>
2.  "Play hills are one of the most popular facilities in a playground and are used both in summer and winter."  6.2.2. Play Hills and Skateboard Hills, page 17.
<P>
3.  "(c) Natural Features - trees and shrubs, rock outcrops, streams, and minor slopes - all may be utilized to improve the play experiences of children".  6.2.3. Layout, page 19.
<P>
4.  "Manipulative cognitive play.  Loose materials, such as blocks, boards, ropes, sand, water sprays, natural areas". 6.3 Suggested Facilities and Equipment of Play Activities.  6.3.2. School-Aged Children, page 21.
<P>
5.  "The design, location, and maintenance schedule should discourage pets from soiling the sand.  Sandbox covers, where used, should be designed to be safely secured both in the open and closed position" 6.3 3 Sand Play Areas, 6.3.3.6 Protection, page 23.
<P>
6. "(d) The sand play area may have access to water for moistening the sand. (g) Where possible, include natural elements (e.g., trees, boulders) in the sand play area".  6.3.3.7 Design Recommendations, page 24.
<P>
	I would like to address the issue of "all weather fields" which  I see in most schools around Vancouver.  These areas would not be allowed in Australia as children are clearly at risk of injury playing on such abrasive surfaces.  I would be interested in seeing the statistics regarding accidents on these fields.  My interpretation using the Canadian Guidelines is that these are not acceptable fields for children to be playing on and should an injury occur the School Board could be liable. Recommendations for school age children regarding facilities and equipment are:
<P>
"Physical Play (a) Games with balls or aerial objects,(such as Frisbee, ball hockey, or kite flying)  Recommendation  Facilities and equipment Open and level grass or hard surface.  6.3.2. page 21.  Also:"Abrasive rough material is suitable for parking areas and areas subject to wind erosion.  It should not be used where children may fall and receive abrasion injuries"  8.3.2. Crushed Stone, page 29.  
<P>
	Areas such as specific play equipment, heights and ground under surfacing of equipment, garden plots, pets and animals, and loose materials to provide creative play opportunities for children are addressed in the Canadian Guidelines.  We should not be fearful about using these protocols when submitting a proposal to the school or wider community.  Their use should give policy makers and others a sense of security in knowing that if the guidelines are followed correctly, most safety issues will be addressed, and challenging play opportunities for playspace users will be assured.
	<P>
	From my experience, an enormous amount of community involvement goes into many playspace developments.  Children spend hundreds of hours in their school or community play areas and playspace managers must be responsible for maintaining,  beautifying  and changing their play world.  Not doing so, I believe, would be irresponsible.  Ongoing maintenance schedules and guidelines should be developed during the playspace planning process.  Site clean-up, and careful play area and equipment inspections for potential hazards should be carried out on a regular basis.
	<P>
	A public playspace is designed for the people of a particular community and, in a very real sense, it is owned by the community.  I believe the community should be allowed to be involved in the design, planning and maintenance of playspaces and that access for all people in the community is essential.

C. FOXON, Grounds Supervisor, Vancouver School Board</center>

<P>
<P>





	The Grounds section of Physical Plant employs approximately 100 people in summer and 55 in winter.  We are responsible for the maintenance of grounds, which means everything from the  street, to the buildings including play area, gardens, fencing, sports fields, trees etc.  My purpose here today is to discuss  the environmental issues that we deal with throughout the school year.  From enriching a school environment by planting trees, we plant 250 per year, to converting gravel sports fields back to grass, we have completed 16, our gardeners work with elementary and high school horticultural/environmental programs and gardening clubs.  We have worked on the construction of nesting boxes for the local bird population.  We deal with school gardens, recycling,  and composting as well as with teachers, parents, and community groups all at the principal's request. 
<P>	
	I would like to make some general observations concerning the situation with the Vancouver school grounds.  Since 1988 the Board has added over 100 portables to the existing sites.  Earthquake containers are on almost every school site.  The Maintenance department has added containers for storage because the rooms within the school that had traditionally been allocated to us have been taken away  due to the school's needs.  This has caused a concern regarding space on the school grounds.  On some sites it has caused play space to be eliminated with the added pressure of having more kids on the site. It has reduced the available space for exterior play while promoting more safety/security issues.
<P>
	Due to the increasing density of the city, the shortage of park space in certain areas, the increased volume of traffic and parents' reluctance to have their kids crossing busy streets, there is more of a focus on school grounds as a community resource for a multitude of activities.  These concerns, coupled with an increased demand from user groups for better access and improved facilities for sports, bring the use of school grounds under increased pressure.
<P>	
	There are two types of projects that we get involved in: playground equipment upgrade and  school ground upgrade which may or may not include playground equipment.
<P>
PLAYGROUND EQUIPMENT UPGRADE
<P>
 Playground Standards:
<P>
	The Vancouver School Board has 170 creative play areas situated on elementary school grounds.  This totals approximately 11 acres of ground cover throughout the system.  I estimate that there are at least  2.5 million hours of school based play on these sites, not including play that occurs after school hours, during the summer, on weekends or usage by other agencies.
	<P>
	Since 1987 there have been 49 new or upgraded school sites.  All upgrading has been with pre-designed commercial play equipment.  This upgrading has included the removal of old play equipment that had been installed by parent groups many years ago and the expansion of existing creative play areas.
<P>	
	Playground equipment is traditionally installed by parent groups with a supervisor provided by the manufacturer, but this is not the case on all school districts throughout the lower mainland.  In some circumstances the playground equipment is installed by the Grounds department under contract to the school. There have been larger projects in which playground equipment has been a component of the total rejuvenation of the school site. In all cases, the playground equipment had been manufactured.
<P>
SCHOOL GROUND UPGRADE
 <P>
	These include increasing the green space, planting trees, landscaping, adding picnic tables, benches, basketball standards and planters.  Through an agreement with the union, it is still possible to have parents install play equipment or do minor projects on school board property.  There are a lot of school boards that will not allow parents to install or work on projects on school grounds because of the liability involved.
	<P>
	We have had some extensive projects involving large amounts of people and large amounts of money on the site but in all of these cases they have had to meet the guidelines set down by the school board.
<P>Keeping these areas safe
<P>
	Since safety is everyone's concern, we encourage all partners in the education system to help us monitor and report problems or concerns.  Apart from that, we monitor certain high use areas once per week.  We inspect and lubricate all play equipment throughout the system every 2 to 3 months.  At that particular point any areas of concern are addressed.  The department does a thorough examination of all play equipment every 6 months.
	<P>
	Items such as swivels are removed and checked along with such items as 'S' hooks which are routinely replaced.  Logs are checked for rot, and slides for wear.  A detailed examination of the equipment is done.  The Chief Administrator of the school is informed of any problems or potential problems.  The costs for these major renovations are calculated and the appropriate work order is developed.
	<P>
	Once the project has been completed and the community group has left, then the Board assumes an ongoing cost to maintain that project, not just for today and tomorrow, but for many years down the road.  The day after you have finished your project and it gets vandalized or is burnt down, the Board has an obligation to replace it.  The Board is very careful about projects due to the future commitments of funding and the Ministry guidelines.
	<P>
	The Physical Plant department accepted the C.S.A. guidelines and tried to upgrade the play equipment without any increased funding.  The Grounds section budget has not seen any significant increase since 1991, although costs have increased dramatically. 
<P>
Liability coverage change for 1994/1995 academic year
<P>
	The School's Protection Program has advised that if the Board were to allow construction of a structure knowing that it did not meet Board or Ministry standards, the liability coverage would no longer be in effect.  In other words, the District would not be covered if it knowingly allowed construction that falls short of Board or Ministry standards.  Therefore, the Board could be held responsible for payment of any settlements arising from this type of construction.
<P>
December 1991 Committee ii: Planning and building committee
<P>
	The Grounds section of Physical Plant was directed to conduct tests to evaluate alternative resilient ground cover material for creative play areas.  The objective of the test was to determine whether any new materials or a combination of materials could be both installed and maintained economically as an improvement in safety and durability over the standard Vancouver School Board bark mulch mix.  This standard is 4 inches of gravel with 8 inches of fir bark mulch 3/4 inch or less fine sieve.  The results were then presented in the spring of 1993.  A new standard was developed, being 4 inches pea gravel, 4 inches bark mulch, 4 inches of coarse sand/bark mulch mix as the topping layer.
<P>
GENERAL AREAS OF DISCUSSION REGARDING SAFETY
<BR>
	* Safety is the number one item;<BR>

		Maintenance of play equipment or landscape is 
	<BR>	the key to success with any project around the 
		school system;
<BR>	* In order to facilitate good maintenance it is necessary to understand the 
<BR>	* problems and concerns of the community.
<BR>
Concerns  for  grounds with a project or proposal :
<BR>
	* Will the project increase the cost of maintenance?<BR>
	* The grounds budget has not increased in size since 1991<BR>
	* Ease of maintenance: is it going to need special treatment, and can it be 
accommodated in the present system of maintenance?<BR>
	* How will the project impact the existing site?  Items to consider: fire access, 
truck deliveries, building maintenance etc. <BR>
	* Will the project affect site lines? From the police point of view, will the site be 
made more difficult to view or search?<BR>
	* Will the site be easier, or harder, to supervise?<BR>
	* Will the equipment provide hiding spaces, i.e.. Plastic tubes, playhouses, 
platform deckconfigurations etc.?<BR>
	* Has the age of the users been taken into consideration?<BR>
	* Have the traffic patterns between the various age groups been taken into 
consideration?<BR>
	* Is the project easy to maintain?  The simpler it is to maintain the better it will 
be maintained.<BR>
	* Once the project has been accepted by the board, it will be maintained while 
the budget  allows.<BR>

HISTORY AND BACKGROUND OF CREATIVE PLAY AREAS,  GREENING PROJECTS AND SCHOOL GARDEN PLOTS
<P>
	It is the general policy of the Vancouver School Board to try to create buildings and grounds that provide the best environment for learning.  Financial limitations undoubtedly have a serious impact on our ability to achieve this goal.  The Ministry of Education does not consider a creative play area to be an integral feature of an elementary school and does not share in the funding for their development.  While shareable funds for creative play areas are not available, the Vancouver School Board has, over the last 25 years, encouraged and supported the development of creative play areas.  In fact the use of Vancouver school sites for the development of creative play areas dates back to 1969.  In that year, Board policy for supporting this initiative was introduced and the first creative play area was installed at Graham Bruce Elementary School.	
	<P>
	During the 1970s, various grounds improvements projects were developed through local neighbourhood improvement projects and other parental fund raising projects.  Play areas were designed and created by parents, teachers and other community members. In terms of the type of equipment, there were many wooden platforms erected and some fitness circuits or equipment installed.  VSB reports indicate that maintenance of these playgrounds was often a concern to principals and teachers, who felt that many of these adventure playgrounds focused solely on imaginative play and did not provide opportunities for physical education activities.
	<P>
	By the 1980s, many Vancouver schools had installed playground projects, but concerns were raised about the safety of this equipment.  During the 1980s efforts were directed towards reducing potential hazards on school playgrounds, revising safety standards and generally making the existing play equipment safer for children to use.  For example, during the 1980s equipment was required to be installed with resilient ground cover underneath.  During this time period the Maintenance and Construction Division began removing some equipment which was considered potentially hazardous for use on school grounds and the Board established a separate funding account for upgrading and replacing existing play equipment.
	<P>
	Between 1987 and 1992, 50 new or upgraded/expanded projects were  undertaken.  In addition to these creative play area projects, the Board adopted a policy to permit groups to install garden plots on school grounds and a few schools initiated a variety of greening or grounds beautification activities.   		
<P>
	1992 earmarked the beginning of the first major budget cuts and the Grounds Division was seriously affected by reductions in funding.  With less funding available, it was now more difficult to maintain current play equipment and ensure that all safety issues were adequately addressed. In addition, with limited staff,  less time was available for regular grounds maintenance projects.
	<P>
	Due to an increase in the amount of play equipment and a decrease in the available budget for grounds maintenance, the Board in recent years decided to place a moratorium on creative play areas.  Since April 1993, schools can no longer request approval to develop new creative play areas or expand existing ones.
<P>
CURRENT ISSUES ON SCHOOL GROUNDS: COMPETING DEMANDS AND RISING EXPECTATIONS
<P>
	While it is interesting to trace the development of creative play areas and other grounds improvement projects, it is important to identify some of the present critical grounds issues.  The demands or expectations placed on school buildings and school grounds are vastly different than they were 25 or 30 years ago.  As the housing density increases and the amount of green space decreases, residents surrounding schools look to these sites to provide a variety of opportunities.  Community members see school grounds as playing fields for various team sports, as green spaces for passive activities or as areas to visually enhance their neighbourhoods.
	<P>
	While our limited school sites have not expanded in size over time, there are other additional demands placed on this site.   Our buildings are old and not easily adaptable to changes in education delivery. With reduced class size and more specialized services such as ESL classes, special education classes and other district support services offered in Vancouver schools, we can no longer accommodate the same number of children in our buildings.  Throughout Vancouver more portables are placed on school grounds, further reducing the amount of available land. As the number of teaching and support staff serving the school increases, so does the demand for additional parking. If additional parking is not provided on site, angry residents complain that school  parking needs should not be accommodated in their neighbourhood.
	<P>
	Our school grounds must also meet the curricular needs of  our education programs. As teaching staff and administration staff change over time our sites must remain flexible to accommodate the often diverse interests of these individuals. We require level fields for playing team sports. Often all weather fields are preferred. Blacktop areas are also required for many informal play activities and ball games. School staff often wish to have passive spaces, imaginative play areas or project space for science projects. Parents similarly request space for creative play areas and express some desire to beautify the school grounds.  
	<P>
	All these activities requested by community members, parents, teachers and administrators  are competing for space and are often requested on very restricted school sites. In conclusion, we must remember that the amount of available land is  not increasing, but instead diminishing, yet our expectations and demands on this land are still increasing.

	My own time with the Vancouver School Board dates back to the late 1960s.  Back in those days, we would be asked by the school to provide an adventure play area for the children.  The Planning Department provided drawings and then the workers would ask the kids at that school what they would like to see us build.  This was generally, balance logs, ("so we can have chicken fights"), a tree fort with a slide, a firepole and a ladder to climb, a trolley ride and a "giant stride."  No thought was given to resilient surfaces, toxic materials or even location.  The principal and P.T.A. gave their choice for a location and that's where we'd place it.
	<P>
	Off we would go to the beach with our back hoe and truck, where choice logs were loaded for the project.  Cedar was preferred but any logs would suffice; sometimes they were covered with creosites. Then, we would return to the school for the actual construction.  This construction would consist of setting the logs in concrete, making sure that they were well soaked with copper sulphate, and erect the various pieces of equipment.
	<P>
	Some of this equipment was downright dangerous by today's standards.  A "ram swing" was a large log, 14 inch in  diameter suspended from chains.  Several children would sit on this log and others would swing it back and forth as hard as they could.  Kids fell from this log with frightening regularity and had the added danger of being rammed by the swinging log as they tried to stand up.  Tire swings were often 12 inches or more in height so that, as they swung back and forth, the tire would hit the uprights with a resounding thud.  Head and back injuries were common.  Danger abounded on our equipment.  
	<P>
	Then came the 1970s. To this danger was added "Local Initiative Projects" and "Neighbourhood Improvement Projects." Designs did not take safety into account; equipment was poorly conceived in terms of material and function, layouts gave no thought to encroachment zones or other hazards.  In general, this period definitely put the adventure  in adventure play areas.
	<P>
	The Bayview School Creative Play Area seemed to be built with disaster in mind: long slides upon which children would ride their bikes, roller skate and skateboard, trolley rides with a 6 feet drop over a 100 foot cable, and a tree fort which was 15 feet high.  As most accidents on Vancouver School Board equipment result from falls, the possibility of injury from this height is much greater.  It was rumoured that lawyers would hang around Bayview School, card in hand, and wait for the inevitable accidents.
	<P>
	The 80s began with the Board recognizing the dangers and starting to make the necessary changes.  Parent groups during this time often were at odds with each other.  One group would have us remove a piece of equipment which we considered dangerous, but another group would not.  We were caught in the middle.
 	<P>
	In terms of risk management, we reacted quickly to accidents as they happened but we were not able to remove or adjust equipment before problems occurred.  This was due to pressure from parent groups to, "keep your hands off our equipment."  Ministry standards were brought in but, as usual, no money was provided to implement these standards.
	<P>
	With the 90s came the C.S.A. guidelines.  Finally a reasonable and effective standard; and one which seemed acceptable to all.  Now we had the tools with which to try and bring some kind of standardization across the system.
	<P>
	In the future, providing there is money, we foresee standardized, well designed and well maintained equipment,  wheelchair accessible equipment and sites, in addition to quality resilient surfaces as an integral part of all  new systems.
	<P>
	We all want the best and safest equipment available.  Co-operation between all involved groups, educators, parents, creative play area suppliers, and the maintenance department is the only way to achieve this end.

<P>
<P>



	Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to be here at this training session on school ground naturalization. This concept, as we all realize, is overdue, as a new attitude to school grounds is absolutely essential to the well-being of the public realm and of society.  I would like to structure the hour that we have together in the following way: (1) background context in regard to valuing children and an urban landscape perspective; (2) the importance of place in any design considerations; (3) a six-pack of strategies for developing design ideas; and, (4) time for discussion and questions.
<P>
VALUING CHILDREN: an urban landscape perspective 
<P>
	It was a rainy Wednesday in late April 1993. A small gathering of people commemorated the Neville Scarfe Children's Garden  (built in 1987 as a participatory effort and as an example of a steelyard behind the Faculty of Education at UBC), and "transplanted" the garden's spirit to the new garden, yet to be built. Despite all of our efforts to be positive about this experience, I personally could not deny a deep sadness surrounding the garden's transformation. When the Scarfe Garden was first built, Gary Pennington, JoAnne Naslund and I discussed what would happen when the education building expanded into the garden. I remember saying that it was just another opportunity to have participation in building a garden for and with another community. I think I said it would just be another adventure. Well, I was wrong.
	<P>
	On reflection, the Scarfe Children's Garden was the stuff of dreams for me. It embodied many ideals that I believe in:  the involvement of people in making their own places and their resulting "ownership" of those places; the critical importance of doing  and making  as a part of education; the opportunity to introduce an ecologically and visually diverse and productive landscape into a relatively banal and monocultural university landscape; and working cooperatively with different units on campus to create a better community.
	<P>
	Most importantly, it is people who make and transform landscapes. One of the most peculiar criticisms of the garden has actually resulted in losing the name: the Scarfe Children's Garden. People have complained: how can you have a children's garden without children? This point of view has totally missed the object of the garden in a deep and profound way. This misconception is probably the most upsetting to me personally because it means that we don't really value children as a society. 
<P>
	Firstly, we are all still part child. We all require connection with nature on a continuing basis. A place like the Scarfe Garden outside your work door is an incredible asset to one's mental and physical health. Secondly, the garden was conceived as a prototype, as a place where teachers-to-be could see the possibilities of a garden setting for their own schools. The garden was like the seed of an idea to be planted in the many people who passed by and through it. So the Scarfe Garden is a lesson for me in valuing children. This lesson can be transferred to our activities in the city and region as a whole. It is what today is all about. What would happen if all the decisions we made in Council chambers around the world were based on the bottom line criteria: is this good for children? The world would indeed be a different place.
<P>
THE IMPORTANCE OF PLACE  IN DESIGN
<P>
	Place. There is that word again. What do I mean when I say place? In everyday terms, we have a practical knowledge of places where we work, relax and sleep. However, this knowledge at a functional level is quite superficial. The significance of place in human experience goes far deeper than this.  For instance, all of us have experienced homesickness or nostalgia for a particular place. Edward Relph, in his book, Place and Placelessness, says that, "to be human is to live in a world that is filled with significant places: to be human is to have and to know your place". 
		<P>
	The concept of place has several components that are key to understanding the issues around "design" and school ground naturalization:
<BR>

* The idea of location: internal site characteristics and external connections to other locations; 
<BR>* Place involves an integration of elements of nature and culture: "each place has its own order, its special ensemble, which distinguishes it from the next place"; 
<BR>* Although every place is unique, they are interconnected by a system of spatial interactions or what we call circulation; 
<BR>* Places are emerging or becoming: with historical and cultural change, new elements are added and old elements disappear; 
<BR>* Places have meanings: they are characterized by people's beliefs -- the asphalt school ground is a symbol of a set of values; a naturalized school ground, likewise.
<P>
	Unfortunately, as a society, we experience difficulty retaining diverse and significant places, and creating new ones. Instead, we are prone to spreading a mundane, thin layer of people, food, power and entertainment on our urban landscape, which leads to a placelessness that eliminates variety, vitality and diversity.
<P>
The natural environment has a profound ability to teach us about place: 
<P>
	Place and identity: Natural landscapes which children take on as their own give them an unusual sense of privacy, autonomy, and control. The private, secret places bear marks of the adult world but are often transformed. "I was away from my parents and from suburbia, in my own world. I don't recall my parents ever being in the bush in the 5 or 6 years I played there. The bush had tall meadows with milkweed and goldenrod and a multitude of insects. I remember the bush as being golden and open and also deeply shaded and secret. We would find or dig out holes and cover them with boards as underground hidden forts. We would spend our days collecting insects in jars. It was our world".
	<P>
	Abstract position. We are generally uncomfortable if our position in the landscape is unclear. Children learn about position in the natural landscape: up in trees, down in ditches, between two stumps or in the middle of the meadow. This concept of abstract position is part of the vocabulary of place-understanding and place-making.
	<P>
	Prospect-Refuge: This is a theory built on from the animal world. We have all experienced the feeling of being more comfortable on the edge of a space, or with some sense of prospect or view, and refuge or safety. The desire that children have to climb and to hide in cosy places is related to this theory.	
	<P>Place Culture: A child place culture is full of rituals and rules with important meanings. Everywhere in the child/adult world, children have an underlife, a distant child history formed away from adult eyes, from above and below the planes of our conventional existence. Special places are given new meaning. Polakow and Sherif, architects at U. of Michigan, state that, "while many of these places reflect the insidious themes of mass media, they have also observed that the more children are permitted to develop their own autonomous and private places, the more elaborated their play and the more developed and nuanced their rituals and negotiations." This empowers them to take on life's complexities. Sometimes, the natural landscape of the child is the only one which the adult may choose not to enter -- too high, too messy, too wet.
	 <P>
	Sustainable Place: Childhood landscapes have the potential to teach about sustainable ecosystems. It is tough in the traditional play yard to experience the cycles of nature, the rain disappears into a catch-basin and there is no sense of the importance of soil as a cleansing filter, little sense of wildlife or place for the imagination to roam. These ideas about place are a key to any consideration of the "d" word: design.
<P>
SIX-PACK OF STRATEGIES:
<BR>
1. Know your site;<BR>
2. Develop intentions and program;<BR>
3. Involve people;<BR>
4. Design a beginning, not an end;<BR>
5. Start where it is easiest;<BR>
6. Keep it simple.
<P>
Thank you for your kind attention and I welcome challenges, discussion and questions.

	A school yard is a small place. It is unrealistic to think of establishing a natural hemlock-cedar forest ecosystem or lake community there. A school yard is also relatively hostile compared to surrounding natural areas. The ground tends to be compact, it is drier, nutrient cycles are extremely poor or nonexistent and the moisture holding capacity of the soil is awful. In the inner city, air pollution and the frying effects of breezes created by vehicle traffic further compound problems in establishing reasonable representations of ecosystems.
	<P>
	A school yard would not be most people's first choice of  place to plant trees or establish wildlife habitat. Nevertheless, it is possible to establish impressive plant communities which please the eye, soothe the mind, offer wildlife important habitat, and serve as valuable educational assets for schools. Especially in urban areas these small patches of vegetation in school yards could serve as valuable linkages with other fragmented habitats, increasing their value to wildlife considerably.
	<P>
	This is a challenge. How do you go about establishing an ecosystem of sorts in a school yard? The key of course is to do some careful planning and remember the basics. An ecosystem is a system of living and non-living components interacting with each other according to a particular set of relationships. The key to establishing an ecosystem instead of a sterile assemblage of plants is to pay attention to the relationships. A simple example: if you are choosing herbs to plant in an herb garden, make sure some of the plants are nettles, borage or fennel, which attract butterflies. There is a relationship, and that is an example of what ecosystems are about. 
<P>
USING NATIVE SPECIES
<BR>
	It is desirable to chose native plants to establish an ecosystem in a school yard. What could be more natural? Unfortunately, native vegetation does not  usually do well in a school ground without some effort. Have you ever noticed  the difference between urban forests and those which occur naturally around  Greater Vancouver? Our natural forests are Douglas fir, western red cedar and  western hemlock. They are all coniferous. The western red cedar and western  hemlock need a lot of moisture and shade. The hemlock especially needs to grow  in protected clumps of trees since individual mature specimens are easily blown down by wind because of shallow roots.
	<P>
	City plantings are usually sparse. The ground is drier, and stays drier for  longer periods of time. City conditions are better suited for deciduous trees, not  conifers. Many of our native deciduous trees need a lot of moisture. Our red alder  grows on drier sites but because it tends to form dense stands of saplings through  underground suckers, it may not be a suitable place for children to visit.
	<P>
	If your school yard is fortunate enough to have a stand of native trees,  protect them! It is hard to establish a new one. Besides, it takes decades of  growth to reestablish mature trees. If your school yard does not have such  vegetation, in most cases it will only be possible to use native trees to which you  can offer shaded locations which will remain reasonably wet most of the year. In  addition to shade, most native plants, especially trees, except perhaps for the red alder, require a good layer of topsoil. This will have to be brought to the school  yard by the truckload to ensure healthy growth. The trees will probably require  watering, at least for several years, because the water holding capacity of the  imported topsoil may not be enough to support trees in the otherwise dry school  ground environment
	<P>
	Trees are a universal symbol of life. Their grandeur and majesty has  meaning for everyone. They are also a large enough element of nature to stand up  to the overwhelming dominance of tall buildings. People notice trees and are  aware of nature in the city.
	<P>
	Shrubs and flowers are easier to grow. Again, remember that to establish  an ecosystem you need relationships. A popular native shrub is tall Oregon grape.  However, it is often planted by itself, forming dense stands of what now look  like an ornamental foundation planting. What might be better is to use the smaller  dull Oregon grape and plant it with some salal as would occur naturally. Bleeding  heart makes another colourful addition. The Oregon grape is usually doing  something of interest, either putting forth a beautiful bouquet of yellow flowers,  or displaying an enticing bunch of edible purple grapes, or showing off with  some brilliant red leaves in the autumn. The taller salmonberry makes for better  eating and attracts many birds. Hardhack is another relatively easy shrub to grow  and is hardier than salmonberry.
	<P>
	Some sword fern, lady fern and bracken fern would do well here, too. A  few rotting logs placed in with the shrubs make a nice final touch. As long as this  community is in a well shaded spot it should keep itself going indefinitely. It will  attract all sorts of spiders, snails, centipedes, millipedes, sow bugs, and other  interesting insects. In this community you have the producers, herbivores  (snails), carnivores (spiders and centipedes), and detritivores (snails, millipedes,  and sow bugs). A great educational display!
<P>
PRAIRIE
<BR>

	We do not live in a prairie ecosystem. Nevertheless, grass communities  are in many ways better suited to school grounds than are other plants. They can  withstand the often dry conditions, coming back to full life with the next rain.  Even when they are bone dry they are beautiful, looking more like a dried flower  arrangement. Their tree and shrub counterparts would wilt under similar  conditions and appear dreadful in the school yard, neglected and dying. 	
<P>	An important consideration in a grass community, as with all others when  playing with miniature ecosystems, is to make them aesthetically pleasing. In a  playground, we cannot rely on vastness to capture the interest and respect of the  children. The community is more interesting if it contains varieties that have  interesting leaves or seeds. Our more common lawn fescues which grow in our  yards typically have small seeds which, although they sometimes turn a pleasant  shade of purple when mature, have little else to redeem them.
	
	<P>Plant some oats! They look interesting. Foxtail barley has some very  showy seeds. Timothy grows relatively tall for a grass and has a seed head that  looks like a bottle brush. It also serves as a most impressive perch for  grasshoppers. Whatever is planted, make sure that the thatch has an opportunity  to accumulate. This will bring crawling litter insects such as crickets and again,  establish an ecosystem.
	
	<P>One thing that makes prairie communities more interesting in playgrounds  is to bring them up to eye level. Elevate the plantings using landscape ties so that  they are at eye level as children wander by. This generates an unusual perspective  of this type of community, like looking at a whale through a window in an  aquarium, and helps to capture the interest of students.
<P>
WOODLAND
<BR>

	An example of a natural woodland community, the Douglas fir / western  red cedar  / western hemlock, has already been discussed. Many school grounds  are better suited for introduced species. The solution to making the school ground  more suitable for native species is to bring in lots of topsoil. If possible, this is  the first choice. Deciduous trees like bigleaf maple, black cottonwood, vine  maple, Sitka mountain ash and red elderberry with salmonberry and huckleberry  in the shrub layer make a nice combination. Sword fern and lady fern with salal  and dull Oregon grape are an appropriate ground cover. This type of woodland  may need watering if the ground is dry and there is little natural water on the site  in summer.
	<P>
	If topsoil cannot be reasonably added to parts of the school ground, it may  be more appropriate to plant street trees. Many of these are active to eastern North  America, although some are from Europe. Some suggestions here are the grey  birch, honey locust, tulip tree, northern red oak, European mountain ash and  London plane tree. In many ways these species are more "natural" to school  ground environments than are native species. Species which draw attention to the  life history of the tree or which attract urban wildlife are especially valuable in  school ground plants.
	<P>
	The honey locust produces large, long seed pods in the autumn. They are  very impressive. Children cannot help but notice them and ask questions. The  tulip tree and northern red oak, both native to eastern North America, have  interesting leaves which turn beautiful colours in the fall - yellow for the tulip  tree, and red for the oak. The oak also produces acorns, always a favourite to  collect, and which attract grey squirrels which are becoming more and more  common in the city. The mountain ashes produce a profusion of berries which  attract birds in winter. The European mountain ash, also called the rowan tree, is  often referred to in literature.  This suggests another idea for a woodland community, that of choosing a theme such as "literary" trees.
	<P>
	Whatever the species chosen, it is important to have a cluster of trees, perhaps 10 at least. The cool shade and rustling in the wind these trees produce  will draw attention to the difference trees can make to an ecosystem. The  biodiversity itself is an important element of ecosystems.
<P>
WETLAND
	<BR>
The wetland community is difficult to establish and maintain in a school  ground. To retain specific ecosystem characteristics it will require a supply of  water year round, either from a natural or an artificial flow. It must also be quite  large, not just bath tub size, so it does not dry out completely over the summer  months. Many school grounds are unsuitable for a wetland ecosystem and it may be better to stick with terrestrial environments. There is also the question of  safety. Many parents would object to having any water on the playground more  than 30 cm deep.
	<P>
	If you feel lucky, or extremely creative, give a wetland ecosystem a try. Most students do not have daily contact with a wetland community, which makes such an environment on a school ground even more valuable. A stream environment is in many ways more desirable than a pond. The running water prevents it from becoming stagnant, and it receives its water supply from more distant areas which may be a more reliable source. It will probably not dry out if shallow, unlike a pond. If there is no cattail present already, plant some and soon the area may attract red-wing blackbirds and American goldfinches. Rushes of the genus juncus, such as wire grass are also native; they will thrive as well.  Frogs will populate the edge waters, and a small aquatic ecosystem of water striders, pond snails, water fleas, and perhaps even stickleback trout.	
	<P>There are many underground streams in Greater Vancouver contained in culverts and buried years ago to make way for urban development. Many communities are now seriously considering "daylighting" these streams, uncovering them and replanting their shores. A particularly ambitious project your school could undertake with the community would be to daylight such a stream if it occurs in the area.
	
	<P>A pond community is more difficult to establish. It requires a depression in the land and possibly reducing percolation of some of the surface water into the ground by using a plastic liner. It may be possible to redirect some surface waters from the playground, or water from the roof of the school, to the pond site to increase the water supply. The edges of the pond should be planted with grasses and the pond itself planted with lily pads to reduce water loss through evaporation. This all requires some effort but the cost is within the funds available from sources such as the Friends of the Environment Foundation, and the results are well worth the effort.
<P>
BIRD HABITAT
<BR>

	The best way to attract birds to a school ground is to provide them with sources of food, shelter, perching sites and nesting sites, in addition to water. In keeping with the theme of establishing ecosystems in miniature, a variety of food sources would be appropriate. The most conspicuous and obvious food would be berries. Native species would be salmonberry and red elderberry if there is some shade and moisture; if not, then European blackberry and European mountain ash are hearty alternatives. Trees and shrubs that provide a good source of seeds include Douglas fir, staghorn sumac and hardhack. These are all of different heights and provide a good variety for birds feeding at different levels in trees. Do not forget the insects! Trees that afford a wide range of insect life are the grey birch and bigleaf maple. The insects in bark and dead trees will attract woodpeckers. Natural food  supplies can be supplemented by bird feeders.
	<P>
	Birds need conspicuous perches. Dead branches or snags may seem like useless elements of an ecosystem but they do attract birds who appreciate the unobstructed views these perches provide.  Bird feeders and nest boxes make good class projects and are also valuable supplements to natural feeding areas and nesting sites. Provide a good range of bird seed and nest box sizes and openings.  Finally, try and include a little water somewhere on the site, either in a well maintained bird bath or a natural pool.
<P>
Butterfly Gardens
<BR>

	Some plants are more effective than others in attracting butterflies. Members of the cabbage family are very good. Borage attracts the painted lady. Flowers with trumpet-shaped flowers such as our native honeysuckles, fireweed and columbines are also effective. Some herbs such as anise, parsley and fennel are excellent. Wormwood and thistle are hardy and good for butterflies, while marigolds are preferred by skippers.
	<P>
	Colourful arrangements are available in wildflower mixes, commercially for little cost and  usually consisting of perennials which maintain themselves year after year. Planter boxes with fuchsias attract both butterflies and hummingbirds. Shrubs such as lilacs and buddleia, also called the butterfly bush, are equally good.
	<P>
	The beauty of a butterfly garden is that it does not have to be very big, just a few large containers or a small plot. It can be both colourful and aromatic. Everyone loves to see butterflies; they are symbolic of change and beauty because of their metamorphic life cycle.
<P>
CONTAINERIZED HABITAT
<BR>

	Even though containers do not look very natural they can in fact be used to create an interesting effect which has all the appearance of a natural ecosystem. Even trees are used in large containers; a cluster of these in a school yard can create a pleasant forest ecosystem. There are several advantages to using containers. Firstly, they can retain soil moisture longer; when the tree is watered the excess will be retained rather than just running off into the ground water. A second advantage to a container is that it helps to protect the plant. It puts a bit of distance between the edge of the container and the plant itself, children cannot run over it by accident, and thus are less likely to damage it.  Finally, the soil in the pot will not be trampled and compacted.
	<P>
	Containerized habitats are delineated and separate from their surroundings. They draw attention to themselves and afford the opportunity to showcase interesting species and arrangements. Their relatively small size challenges the imagination to be creative.		The small scale of this environment focuses the attention of children on small organisms, creating a good opportunity to use this habitat for discussions of soil organisms.
<P>
FOOD PRODUCTION
<BR>

	Having an edible garden somewhere on campus is important. A common complaint of our modern society is that we are no longer connected to the land. Many students do not have family gardens, so a school vegetable patch gives them the opportunity to watch food grow. Showy plants are especially important here, for even though sunflowers in such a garden would unlikely produce seeds that you would want to eat, they are easy to grow and become very big. They also have incredibly beautiful flowers which would be in full bloom just as the children are returning to school in the fall. Other suitable plants would be pumpkins, (also ready when the children return to school), snow peas with their colourful flowers on trellises, ornamental cabbages, tomatoes and Swiss chard. All of these are relatively easy to grow. A vegetable garden is not complete without a compost,  which provides a  good chance to talk about solid waste management, recycling and environmental citizenship.
	<P>
	One of the advantages of a vegetable garden is that it doesn't necessarily have to be maintained by the school, which sometimes presents a problem over the summer.  This is a good opportunity to involve the community at large with the school, as many people in communities everywhere are looking for a patch of land on which to show off their green thumbs. The vegetable patch can be open to community members who would set good examples for the children.  To be really adventurous, try an edible wilds garden with native edible vegetation. This might include miner's lettuce, nodding onion, field chickweed, red-flower currant, salmonberry and wild gooseberry.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<BR>

	Establishing miniature ecosystems is an educational experience in itself. Let the students participate in the selection of the species and their planting, and above all, have the students become the guardians. The miniature ecosystems of a school ground require the type of stewardship that children can provide.
	<P>
	The school ground offers many opportunities to establish small ecosystems, which can include showy plants which stimulate the imagination and instill wonder at their life histories. With some luck there are remnants of some of the original vegetation in the area, at least a few trees. If not, the site itself could be developed to restore some of the natural community. At the very least, vestiges of ecosystems can be established in containerized habitats. Whatever the approach, the school ground will become a much richer living space and learning environment.

<P>
<P>





	If the grounds you are working with have been asphalted or concreted over, as they were for decades at Lord Roberts Elementary School, removal of the surface and compacted granular material below the surface is a necessary first step.  Replacement of the soil with native-like material to plant in is also required.  Sources for soil might include nearby construction sites with excess topsoil once construction has been completed, municipal excavation for public services (preferably mixed with composted organic material  like leaves and garden waste) or composted agricultural waste.
	<P>
	Even if the school grounds have not been covered over with hard paving, years of soil compaction will need to be aerated.  A core-type aeration machine may be available from the school board grounds maintenance staff or parks board staff.
	<P>
	We have found that freshly laid soil is easy to plant in, but often very mucky.  Participants should be warned ahead of time to wear old clothes, boots, and gloves and to be prepared to get dirty.  If your project involves planting shrubs into turfgrass, this is not nearly as extreme a problem.	
	<P>
	Native plants should be reintroduced wherever possible.  This is a method of reacquainting students and communities to our indigenous landscape, too often invaded by ornamental plants.
<P>
TOPSOIL
<BR>

	An adequate depth of topsoil is essential to the re-establishment of plant life in a disturbed or reclaimed area.  A minimum of 5-8 cm. of topsoil with good moisture retentiveness is required to establish a self-maintaining grass or legume ground cover.
	<P>
	The requisite depth of topsoil increases with the size of the trees and shrubs to be planted in the area.  If the topsoil depth is too shallow, deeper-rooting plants will fail to attain their full growth potential.  Tree and shrub species with superficial root systems require a minimum of 25 cm. of topsoil, while deep-rooting species need at least 60-80 cm. of topsoil in order to flourish.
<P>

MOWN TURF AREAS
<BR>

	The foregoing is rarely applicable to urban park lands with mown turf.  Grading would only be necessary in sites where a change in accessibility is desired or where soil has been disrupted  due to nearby construction.  It may be necessary to lay down topsoil in some areas with a grass ground cover in order to permit the growth of forest rather than ground cover species.
<P>

SITE PREPARATION
<BR>
	The preparation of selected mown turf areas for reforestation is not difficult.  The turf ground cover must be removed; usually by tilling it under.  This provides the soil with additional nutrients and serves to aerate the soil.
<P>
SOIL FERTILIZATION
<BR>
	Organic fertilizers, such as manure and compost, have the longest-term effect on soil fertility and improve the soil structure itself.  Synthetic slow-release fertilizers, such as Sulphur Coated Urea, are similar in their long term effect, however, their use does not enhance the soil structure.  Granular fertilizers require heavy applications, have a short term effect on soil fertility, and are easier to apply than the other two fertilizer types.
<P>
ELIMINATION OF WEED AND GROUND COVER COMPETITION
<BR>
	Mown turf areas with established groundcover provide serious competition for reforestation projects of the managed succession and plantation types.  The ground cover plants and weeds will compete with the newly planted seedlings, trees and shrubs for soil moisture, nutrients and access to sunlight.  The established ground cover also serves to encourage rodent depredations in fledgling reforestation areas.  Grass can be dealt with through judicious mowing and other mechanical means.  The use of herbicides is not recommended when deciduous species are planted, so hand scalping or mechanical control is preferable.
<P>
RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF FOREST SPECIES
<BR>
	Reforestation in urban lands can be planned to provide multiple uses of the woodlots.  Community perceptions require the inclusion of landscaping or aesthetic considerations when selecting species.  Where limited use of the woodlot for forestry purposes is projected, the species selection choices will be broadened.  Similarly, the addition of soil, water and wildlife considerations to the planned reforestation will affect species selection.
<P>
Species selection criteria will include the following:
<P>
	Winter hardiness, growth rate, native plant communities, tolerance of soil conditions, shade, environmental factors, air conditions and ambient pollutants, desired successional stage at time of planting, wildlife food and habitat potential.
<P>
PLANTING TECHNIQUES<BR>
Time to Plant<BR>

	The best time to plant seedlings, trees, and shrubs appears to be in early spring.  The soil can then be worked easily, and the planting of stock before April allows the maximum period for the new plants to establish viable root systems before expending stored sugars and starches to expand leaf and blossom buds.
	<P>
	Summer planting is not recommended as the plants may die under drought stress.  Later fall plantings are also risky as the newly planted stock has little time to establish a root system, thereby increasing the likelihood of winter die-off.  The author has successfully planted bare-root seedling stock prior to mid-October; the seedlings will continue to extend root tip growth.
<P>
Pre-planting care of stock
<BR>
	Healthy plants are more likely to survive the transplanting process if reasonable precautions are taken.  Where immediate planting is impossible, plants should be "heeled in", or temporarily stored in the ground with moist mulch soil covering the roots or rootballs.  This procedure will preserve the plants for extended periods of time without injury.
	<P>
	It is essential, when planting bare-root stock, to keep the roots moist.  Root exposure on warm, sunny days may be fatal.  Containerized and balled-and-burlapped stock must be treated carefully to prevent damage to the branches, trunks and soil ball.
<P>
Hand planting of stock
<BR>
	Seedlings and young trees of up to 1 or 2 meters in height are often planted by hand.  Hand planting requires preparation of a hole of sufficient depth by shovel.  The stock is then placed upright in the hole with the roots in the ground, and the soil packed back in place around the stock.  Hand-planting is necessary on sites with steep slopes and with stony soil.
	<P>
	The wedge method of hand planting requires the removal of a V-shaped section of soil.  The seedling is placed in the hole against the vertical face of the cut.  The wedge of soil is replaced and packed back into place.  This method is appropriate in areas with heavy soil or turf ground cover.
	<P>
	Where the soil is loose and there is no ground cover, the slit method of planting may be used.  A vertical cut is made with a shovel and the blade of the shovel is pushed away from, and then pulled toward, the planter, forming a slit.  The seedling is inserted and the soil is packed around it.
	<P>
	Larger, young trees may be planted by hand, but this requires significant digging.  A post-hole auger may be used if the site is machine accessible and the soil is not stony.  The tree is placed in the hole by hand and is held upright while native soil is filled in and packed gently around the roots.  Containerized small trees should be removed from the container before planting.  Balled-and-burlapped stock should be placed in the hole and the hole partially filled before removing the rope and exposed burlap.
	<P>
	After planting, the seedlings should be watered, mulched, and mice-proofed.  Young seedling trees should be staked and pruned back.  Stakes and ties should be placed on the northwest side of all plants over 3 meters in height to prevent winter wind damage.  Pruning of one third of the plant encourages root establishment.  The young trees should then be watered and mulched with consideration given to rodent protection prior to the first winter following the 
planting period.
<P>
Machine planting of Stock
<BR>
	Seedlings and transplants are generally planted by machine when many are to be planted at one time.  A tractor-drawn planting machine makes a trench or furrow for the tree, drops the seedling and firms the soil around the stock with packing wheels.  A standard plow may be used to dig the furrow, the trees may be set in place by hand; however, this method is less satisfactory as it may remove a topsoil layer.
	<P>
	Holes for larger, deciduous trees and all conifers (over 60 cm caliper) should be dug with a back hoe or a tree spade as this ensures the retention of the soil around the roots.  Large stock should be dug, moved, and planted individually to prevent damage to the trunks.  The use of the requisite heavy machinery will cause soil compaction, which must then be dealt with.	
	<P>Preparation of large stock for successful transplanting should begin one or two years before the actual move.  Trenches are dug around the tree to cut the existing roots, thereby encouraging the growth of new young fibrous roots prior to transplanting.
<P>
MAINTENANCE<P>
Watering of New Stock<BR>

	It is important to water recently planted stock during the first in-ground growing season, especially during dry spells.  This is particularly vital for larger trees and shrubs.  In reforested urban areas, it may be desirable to maintain a watering schedule so as to prevent widespread die-off.
<P>
Staking<BR>

	Newly planted stock may be staked to prevent winter wind damage.  However, the staking ties must be removed or periodically loosened in order to prevent girdling.  Usually, the stakes and ties are removed after 2 or 3 years.  Staking is not normally required for seedling-size plantings.
<P>
Grass and Weed Control<BR>

	As noted previously, competition by grass and weeds must be controlled by mechanical, chemical or manual means.  After the stock has established itself, usually in 2 or 3 years, such control activities can be decreased or eliminated.  A mulch layer over the root system (tree lawn area) will be advantageous to growth and vigor throughout the lifetime of the tree, and should be maintained and expanded over the years.
<P>
Rodent Control	

	Rodents often damage newly-planted trees and seedlings by chewing on the bark.  In order to protect the stock, various measures are necessary.  Poisoned bait in mouse-baiting stations can be used to protect seedlings from damage, while larger trees can have their trunks wrapped (up to a height of 50 cm) with commercially available tree guards.  An alternative is the use of repellents painted on the trunk and lower limbs to discourage rodents.
<P>

The Use of Wildflowers in Reforestation Areas<BR>

	Wildflowers have been introduced successfully along highways, in certain urban parks, as well as by landscape architects in commercial and residential projects.  Wildflowers are increasingly popular for large areas as they provide a low-maintenance alternative to turf and are aesthetically pleasing.
<P>
"The cost-effectiveness of wildflowers is truly a factor.  We wanted to provide colour in our parks, and wildflowers seemed to be the best solution.  Both the purchase of the seeds and the maintenance factor are important from a cost standpoint."
<P>
	The City of Dallas Parks and Recreation Department has actively adopted the use of wildflowers in parks and along roadways.  The wildflower plantings permit pattern mowing, which serves to decrease maintenance costs.  The Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation has utilized a similar scheme of wildflower planting in order to reduce mowing cost, which totaled $31 million in the fiscal year 1980-81.
	<P>
	The National Wildflower Research Centre was opened on January 3, 1983 in Austin, Texas, and serves as a national clearing house on the use of wildflowers in the landscape.  The Centre is also involved in technical research on the cultivation of wildflowers in planned settings.
	<P>
	In Canada, W.R. Aimers Limited has provided an extensive catalogue of wildflower seeds.  This catalogue includes advice on soil preparation, companion ground cover species, fertilization, and planting techniques.  Aimers Limited also provides 14 wildflower seed mixtures for use throughout Canada.
	<P>
	The advantages of wildflowers are several.  Maintenance costs decrease, as little or no mowing is required in areas planted with wildflowers.  The use of native plants and wildflowers minimizes water consumption in areas with little available water or subject to drought.  When public spending is cut, areas planted in wildflowers do not become unsightly as do poorly maintained mown lawns.  Finally, wildflowers provide a colourful and attractive alternative to mown turf.
	<P>
	The use of wildflowers within and around reforestation areas bridges the transition between mown turf and forested woodlots.  The wildflowers provide an array of colour, thereby enhancing the visual appeal of an area undergoing early-stage reforestation.

DON ALEXANDER , Environment Fund, VanCity </center>

<P>
<P>







 
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FUNDING OPERATION
<P>
	EnviroFund, in full operation since 1992, currently gives out $90,000 a year, usually divided between four groups. The awards, which are normally between $15,000 and $25,000, are intended to provide substantial rather than token funding for projects. The deadline is once a year, most recently on August 31st, though this may change.
	<P>
	We also have some influence on the Corporate Sponsorship Awards, some portion of which goes to environment-related projects (somewhere on the order of $45-70,000 a year). With the latter, one can apply any time during the year, though the money often runs out before the year's end.
<P>
STRONGEST POINTS WE LOOK FOR
<BR>

	We have criteria  that we use to evaluate applications. In brief, these are the credentials:
<BR>
be local (Lower Mainland/Fraser Valley);<BR>
be ongoing (as opposed to one-shot);<BR>
be action-oriented; <BR>
represent a positive alternative; <BR>
be ecologically and socially responsible;<BR>
involve a community effort; <BR>
be not-for-profit (or profit in the developmental stage).<BR>

	In addition, we tend to favour projects that are on the "cutting edge" (those that link ecological issues with social justice or community economic development) and can serve as models for emulation. We often try to support projects that might not get funding elsewhere, those that are somewhat outside the mainstream. To date we have supported: the Environmental Youth Alliance, the Community Alternatives Society, Our Community Bikes (BEST), Save Georgia Straight Alliance, the Land for Nature Project, the Strathcona Community Gardeners, the Eslhayan Learning Centre, the Eco-DESIGN Resource Society, the Delta Recycling Society, and the T. Buck Suzuki Foundation.
<P>
MISTAKES TO AVOID
	<BR>
	We favour locally-based projects, so national groups are at a bit of a disadvantage. We favour requests for project-specific rather than general funding, though we understand the problem this can pose for groups that lack core funding and thus we're looking into the issue. We avoid projects that are oriented mainly towards studying something or towards education, and which may not yield tangible results. We prefer projects or organizations that have a clear focus and a clear plan of action, and that have "visibility", meaning that they are relatively easy for the public to conceptualize. We prefer applications that are straightforward and not larded up with too much support material and bulky appendices.
<P>
FINANCIAL DO'S AND DON'T'S
<BR>
	We don't ask for a super-detailed budget (revenue and expenses for year one and year two of the project, although we only fund one year), but we do expect that the information be complete, even if some of it is based on projections. We won't fund projects where most of the money is going to salaries or fees or where the overhead costs seem inflated.
 <P>
CREATIVE FUNDRAISING IDEAS
<BR>
	We encourage groups to make the acquaintance of the local VanCity branch by asking who the community development and environment liaison person is. Branches have small discretionary funds that they contribute towards projects. Canada Trust also has the "Friends of the Environment" and Shell has local project funding. One can also approach businesses in the neighbourhood for in-kind donations. Outside of that, there are a whole host of other rather labour-intensive activities that are always a bit of a gamble, for example rummage or book sales, raffles (perhaps you can get an artist to donate some art),  or t-shirt and sweatshirt sales.  In general, whenever you can use humour, it's a good idea.
<P>
OTHER RESOURCES<BR>

	Seek out teachers at local colleges who might be able to offer students credit for "hands-on" learning experiences.  Ask neighbourhood groups if they have volunteers who want to pitch in, and if you see someone who from the state of their garden obviously has both expertise and experience in gardening, try to enlist their help. Finally, I'd like to encourage you to get involved in the Eco-City Network, which is another place that you might be able to meet prospective volunteers.

	I have been working with The Evergreen Foundation for almost four years, and I would like to briefly outline the organization and our programs, which include an annual grant for Canadian schools.  I will then discuss opportunities for community-based project funding, what I call the "tree soup" approach.
	<P>
	The Evergreen Foundation, founded in 1991, is dedicated to restoring and preserving natural areas in the urban environment through education and planting projects. The goal is not just to physically  restore the health of our cities, but also to reconnect people with nature, a vital step to solving our environmental challenges.
	<P>
	Begun in 1991 in the Toronto area, School Ground Naturalization (SGN) is a national education program  designed to give teachers and students the tools to transform their school grounds into natural, outdoor classrooms. The projects are innovative and inspirational,  combining tree, shrub and wildflower planting on school property with learning programs for the students. 
	<P>
Components of the SGN program:
<BR>
* As much as $100,000 in direct grants (of up to $500 per school);<BR>
* A "how-to" training series, Learning Grounds, to inform, empower and network; <BR>
* The Outdoor Classroom  newsletter, filled with inspirational and informative stories from schools, ecologists, educators and parents across the country;
<BR>* Support & resources through "SchoolNet", national education on-line network.
 <P>
	In March of 1995, the program will provide as much as $100,000 directly to schools. Already this fall, 260 teachers and parents have taken part in Learning Ground  training sessions in Hamilton and Vancouver. 750 more are expected in other cities across Canada by the end of 1995. As well, the first issue of The Outdoor Classroom  has reached every school board in Canada.		The next issue is fundraising. While starting a community or school naturalization project can seem overwhelming, there is actually a huge base from which to generate financial and especially in-kind support for the project. One secret to a successful school project is good planning, which begins with assessing your needs and especially your resources. I think of it as the "tree soup" approach.
	<P>
	"Tree soup" is based on the story of "stone soup", where a con man comes to a medieval town and tells the wary townsfolk that he can make soup from stone. Unconvinced but curious, they give the fellow a chance to prove himself, (while guarding their purses). He builds a fire under a kettle full of water, and adds a number of stones from the area, all the while using his charm to increase the interest of the townsfolk. "This soup is going to taste great when it's done," the huckster says," but it would taste even better with a pinch of salt and pepper". Eventually someone volunteers a bit of their spice for the soup. "A couple of potatoes might make the broth a bit heartier," he says, and out come a few carefully guarded vegetables. On he goes, adding vegetables and spices until the aroma of the soup finally convinces someone to part with some meat. Voilà - stone soup.
	<P>
	The "tree soup" approach to fundraising for a school project implies that your community - the parents, local business and area residents - are the most important and effective resources of all. By creating a detailed project plan, you can then approach this community to match your needs with their abilities. Parents may be able to offer professional services such as architecture, landscaping,  or construction, or  provide contacts for local and corporate business; area residents can be approached for their labour, skills and/or contacts; parks departments have experienced foresters and may provide plant material; local naturalist clubs often have older people only too happy to share their knowledge of local plants and animals with others; and local businesses are much more likely to give items (lumber, plants, tools etc.) than cash, especially to a project where their customers and potential customers will see these donations. 
<P>
Some simple "tree soup" rules:<BR>

* Everything that you need for your project can be asked for in-kind from your local community, as well as from the extended community where these people work and socialize;
<BR>* Psychologically, people find giving goods and services in-kind to be cheaper than donating cash;
<BR>* Fundraising at a local level is more efficient because you can deal with the decision makers;
<BR>* There are lots of people willing to donate their time and skills to a community project because they can see tangible results;
<BR>* The benefits of the whole project to the community are much larger than the sum of the parts contributed.
<P>
	While corporations, school boards, government and private foundations all offer some fundraising opportunities, often these sources require intensive grant applications and long waiting periods. Their resources have to be shared between geographic areas and many different types of social needs. While their support should not be ruled out (especially programs like Tree Plan Canada and your local Canada Trust/ Friends of the Environment Foundation or VanCity branches), concentrating on fulfilling as much of your project needs as possible through in-kind donations will likely be more successful, and certainly faster.
	<P>
	Good Luck, and let The Evergreen Foundation know about your questions, projects, successes and challenges.

WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO 'CONNECT WITH THE CURRICULUM'?<P>

Language Arts:	Children like special places to write in<BR>

	Children like special places to write about<BR>
	Children can have special experiences that lend ease to writing<BR>
	Visual separation from classmates may be used<BR>
<P>
Math:	Numerous opportunities to graph and chart change<BR>
	Data from weather observations <BR>
	Sun patterns
<P>
Socials:Native plants may be useful adjuncts<BR>
	Mapping is made easy
<P>
Science:	Arthropods abound in such a place, if it has been planted correctly<BR>
	Plants can include ferns, mosses, horsetails, liverworts and the symbiotic lichens<BR>
	Observation of new microclimates would be a great thing<BR>
	Ancient ways of telling time by the sun<BR>
	Baiting and feeding animals and birds<P>
P.E.:	Wide games of all descriptions including some Project Wild games<BR>
	Climbing and swinging from trees<P>

Art:	Both things to paint on and things to paint with or do rubbings on<P>
			
Music: Performance areas <BR>
	Natural material chimes<P>

Integration of learning by means of your new school setting will be eased as the children have no constraints placed upon them by text or space.  Extending into the community becomes easier when you have an area at your school where you can invite them back.

BILL MERILEES, Naturalist,<BR>
 B.C. Parks, Author of  Attracting Backyard Wildlife</center>

<P>
<P>






	National surveys have amply documented the high value and interest Canadians place on wildlife.  In particular, much of this interest and activity occurs around the family home.  While this may be true, it is also very apparent that our education programs, in particular environmental education curricula, provide a tremendous opportunity for our children to come face to face with many fascinating creatures.  What better place than school grounds similar to these being provided here at Lord Roberts School!
	<P>
	When I was asked by the Evergreen Foundation to address this workshop, I could not help but think of the wonderful baseball movie, "Field of Dreams".  Rather than "Build it and they will come", I would like to change this concept slightly.  My title for this presentation is "Plant it and they will come".  Butterflies and hummingbirds in particular are readily attracted to certain flowering plants.  But, just like a baseball pitcher, and to continue the analogy a little further, in order to do a good job, you need the "right stuff".
	<P>
	Several years ago, a fairly knowledgeable gentleman came into my office and told me how his winter environmental project had been to build a purple martin house.  All the specifications for purple martins had been met.  However, there was just one serious problem--purple martins have a very restricted distribution in British Columbia and our area was not within this range.  What this tells us is that it is important to have some knowledge of the plant and animal species that will either grow or will likely be found in your school yard.
	<P>
	All living organisms have the same basic needs as you or I.  They need space for shelter that is large enough to provide the 'groceries' and water to keep them healthy.  For some animals such as spiders this area can be very small, and for large mammals it may be hundreds of square kilometers.  The challenge that we face, whether it be a back yard or a school yard, is to provide a diverse and as large an environment as possible.
	<P>
	Over the past thirty years I have worked with a great many teachers and one thing  I know you all have in common is tremendous ingenuity and creativity.  With a few good references and perhaps one or two knowledgeable resource people, the opportunity to create a "wild corner" on your playground is incredible.  Perhaps Attracting Backyard Wildlife will help you along this path.
	<P>
	Should any of you have read the writings of J.H. Fabre, the eminent French naturalist, his desire for a bit of land, sun scorched, barren and favored by thistles and wasps will have special meaning.  Some of these characteristics fit almost any school yard, so it does not take much to provide a host of interesting subject material.
	<P>
	Near Georgia and Burrard Streets in downtown Vancouver, among the steel and concrete towers, I spent the better part of a year undergoing bilingual training.  As winter warmed into spring, male house finches began to proclaim their territories.  These sweet, melodious song birds added a touch of nature beyond what any naturalist might expect.
	<P>
	Around Lord Roberts School, the variety of bird, mammal and insect species might not be great, but it's more than enough to satisfy many curiosities.  With a little 'green thumb' creativity, this diversity can be expanded many times.
	<P>
	As a picture may be worth a thousand words, I would like to share with you a variety of photographs in slide form.  These plant and animal species, along with a few practical ideas, are some of the "right stuff" mentioned earlier.  Because we are dealing with school grounds as learning grounds, I leave it to your imagination how you might incorporate these into your particular school settings.
	<P>
	One focus of these illustrations is on plantings for butterflies, remembering that both nectar sources for adult butterflies and food plants for their caterpillars are desirable.  Many of these plants can be easily grown in window boxes.  Another focus is on water sources, as every animal needs to drink, and many including a nice variety of the aquatic insects, require water to complete their life cycles.  For instance, large water tanks used for farm animals can easily be converted into an attractive pool complete with water-lilies and even goldfish.
	<P>
	Climbing plants such as Virginia creeper on the sides of buildings provide nesting sites for house finches, a small bracket tucked up under an eaves may provide a nest site for robins or barn swallows.  Weeds provide seeds for sparrows and juncos,  and the list of opportunities continues to grow.
	<P>
	Should I be able to share my experience or ideas as you proceed to develop your learning ground, I would be pleased to assist.  For the opportunity of addressing this workshop, I would like to thank the Evergreen Foundation for this invitation.  Best wishes in all of your environmental endeavors.

<p>
<p>
	As we approach the year 2000 and beyond, we face some difficult situations regarding our environment.  As a society, we have to make some choices and decisions about how we treat the Earth now and in the future.  We can continue to waste and pollute our world, putting our very heavy human footprints on the face of this beautiful planet, or we can begin to work on environmental solutions so we can hand a healthy, clean and safe habitat to our children.

	
<p>The environmental problems that confront us today are as varied as they are severe.  Though it is easy feel hopeless when confronted with the Earth's environmental problems and the grim statistics, there are some bright spots in the worldwide struggle to protect our environment.  The EarthWarden program believes that this is very important for children to know...it is also important that they realize they can help.  

	<p>The world is filled with beautiful sights and wonders.  Yet in our daily lives, we seldom take the time to observe the natural beauty around us to recognize and appreciate what our environment gives us.  

	<p>Helping children and adults share the enjoyment that a deep awareness of their environment can bring is the goal of the EarthWarden program,  Our aim is to help educate everyone on how fragile, precious and amazing  our environment is.  The EarthWarden also promotes the realization that the Earth is in our hands and it is our responsibility to care for it. 

	<p>The delivery of our environmental program to children is certainly a joint project, designed to be used with strong adult involvement.  Shared learning with trusted adults like parents and teachers is essential in fostering a deep and lasting compassion fro the Earth.  Children are greatly influenced by the elders.  If parents and other adults surround them with an attitude of respect and concern for the planet, they will grow up with a deep-rooted love for living in harmony with the Earth. 

	<p>"If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder...he needs the companionship of a least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement and mystery of the world we live in."  -Rachel Carson

	<p>The EarthWarden Program began as a pilot program in 1991, at the Arnold H. McLeod Elementary School in Moncton, New Brunswick, initially involving 650 students, teachers, and families.  Within one year the program spread  to six schools in the area, with over 3,000 students, teachers, and many more families participating as well as the St. Andrews area with  the Charlotte EarthWarden Program.  By taking part in EarthWarden activities, they learned that we all share this planet -the water, air, land, all living and non living things, and that because we share these resources, it is important that we protect them.  The philosophy of the EarthWarden program is the concept that "Every little bit helps...everyone working together can make a difference in improving our environment."
 
	<p>When introducing the environment to children, they may sometimes think that they are "too small" to make a difference in improving it.  But even the very young can become important players in caring for the Earth.  The EarthWarden program believes that when a love and respect for the environment are ingrained in our children at an early age, it will grow with them into adulthood.  This is the foundation of the EarthWarden program.  Without a love for its beauty and uniqueness, any adult or child will never respect the Earth as a living thing, worthy of care.

	<p>As well as introducing children to the environment, its beauty and its wonders, the EarthWarden explores the problems affecting our planet, and most important- solutions to those problems!  It strives to inspire children  and adults alike to get involved and helps them to realize that they "can make a difference!"  

	<p>The Earth is more to be admired than to be used!" -Henry David Thoreau

	<p>Tired of observing and bemoaning environmental destruction, I decided it was time to do something - anything!  I thought, "every little bit would help...together, we can make a difference."  

	<p>I involved other parents, teachers, and various community members and, with funding from the Government of Canada's "Environmental Partners Fund,"  I developed a hands-on, fun and educational environmental awareness program.  The EarthWarden has visited many classes and community groups, and has proven to be extremely successful; because of the shared learning and keen interest of parents, teachers and students.  Together, we are making a difference!

<p>HOW TO SET UP AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAM FOR YOUR SCHOOL, GROUP OR COMMUNITY

	<p>"Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a little." -Edmond Burke

	<p>The EarthWarden program has played a big part in helping a whole generation in the Greater Moncton Area develop environmentally friendly lifestyles and an attitude of responsibility and love for their environment.

	<p>The EarthWarden program has many components, each very distinct and  well organized, which could be used as a single project or in combination with others.  Though it is designed for children, the EarthWarden program is not restricted to schools; anyone within a community, be it a home and school association, neighbourhood organization for boy/girl guide group, can us the EarthWarden program to promote environmental awareness.  Add new ideas of your own or vary projects to best meet your needs.

	<p>A loving relationship with nature will help promote the health of our planet as well as the health of our children.  The field trips, experiments and activities outlined in this book have proven to be effective and powerful tools in promoting environmental awareness in children.  Through them, they will learn, understand and appreciate their environment.  The best way to discover the Earth's natural wonders is to explore them.  This can be done by going outdoors or bringing the indoors in!

	<p>"I hear and I forget...I see and I remember...I do and I understand." -Anonymous

	<p>In bringing our environmental knowledge and appreciation to children, EarthWarden has found that parent volunteers are a very valuable and important resource.  In fact, they are the backbone of the EarthWarden program.  Once parents have been introduced to all the fun activities and field trips incorporated in the program, most not only lend support, commitment and enthusiasm, but take the initiative to extend the awareness outside the classroom, within family time.  Parents also become more involved in their children's schooling, which creates improvements beyond environmental issues.  The EarthWarden program benefits both those who give to it and those who receive it.

	<p>A valuable lesson learned by the EarthWarden's program is that the community is filled with abundant resources; government agencies, schools businesses, individuals - the list is endless.  And with society's emphasis on protecting our environment, they are almost always willing to help.

<p>	Use all the resources available to you and your group to make your program the best it can be!

	<p>Partnering with your community can really make things happen!  It takes time  and patience to incorporate many aspects of the community project, but the benefits are tremendous!  By including as many community groups as possible into your project, you are fostering an attitude of "family"... a family learning, growing and working together toward a common cause!

	<p>"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world:  indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."  -Margaret Mead

	<p>Once your group has decided to promote environmental awareness in your school and organization, a plan is needed.  Some tips on getting started are:

<p>Get others involved.  The power of many will help your efforts.  Use all your volunteers to help 	plan a program that fosters ownership among all of you.

<p>Ask the community for help when you need such things as buses for field trips, trees for 	planting, and other materials.

<p>Once you've decided what area of the environment you wish to study, pick activities to promote 	awareness of this area.

<p>	Enlist the aid of others in your community to enrich your program, such as bird watchers, 	government fisheries and oceans employees, naturalists, etc.

<p>Go out, observe, see, do and HAVE FUN!

	<p>The EarthWarden feels it is the combination of feeling, seeing, hearing and touching that will achieve the most satisfying and complete understanding of the Earth.  Only then will we all want to live with the Earth as one.  An EarthWarden guidebook is available for any interested person who wishes to spread environmental awareness   This guidebook is funded by the New Brunswick Environmental Trust Fund and the only cost to you is shipping.  It is hoped that you enjoy the book and that it inspires you  and your children to help make our world clean, safe, peaceful place to live!

	<p>"Let us remember in our deliberations the effect our decisions may have on the next seven generations."  Iroquois council invocation that began each meeting.  Any vote taken was only for those present, but also for those who would live two hundred years in the future.

<p><H4>WHERE DO THE RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE EARTH COME FROM?</H4>

<p>A native legend tells of the birth of four brothers which explains these responsibilities:

<p>Long ago, it is said, we were all spiritual beings.  There came a time when there were those who wanted to experience "limitation".  The four beings approached the Creator with their wishes. The Creator agreed that these spirits could become part of a planet which was evolving, our earth. 

<p>The first to be born was the white brother, who was told that responsibility came with limitation.  He would be responsible for the element of fire.  "Take care of it and share it with your brothers."  And so, there was light brought to the darkness.  Warmth was created.  With warmth came movement. 

<p> The second brother to be born was the yellow brother who would take care of the element  of air.  He would be given the same instructions, "take care of it and share it with your brothers." 

<p>The third brother was created to take care of the element water.  He to was given the same instructions, "take care of it and share it with your brothers".

<p> One more brother, the red brother needed to be born but became undecided because he wanted to remain close to the Creator.  The Creator said, "You must go and take care of the element air.  Without it, your brothers will perish".  And so the red brother saw that his brothers needed him, and agreed to take the responsibility of taking care of the earth and sharing it with them. 

 <p> But before this happened, the Creator said to the red brother, "I know that you want to remain close.  Four gifts will be given to you which will maintain contact between us.  Sweetgrass, sage, tobacco, and cedar must be used in ceremony when you want my help.  But you will also have the added responsibility of taking care of the creatures of the earth and the planets of the earth.  And so it is, that the people of today, who have these four brothers as ancestors, inherit the responsibility of the elements.  They also inherit the same instructions of caring and sharing.  

<p>These are teachings long forgotten.  Most people today do not know them.  But, because of the destruction of these elements, so rampant in industrialized and technological societies, these are teachings which must return.

<p>Participants were invited to smell touch, touch and feel the four gifts.

<center>MARY MAJKA, Educator, New Brunswick Naturalists</center>
<p>
<p>


	<p>My work on behalf of the environment started so many years ago (over 30) that words such as environment, habitat and ecology were not yet in common use.  Whatever I was talking about or believed in was taken with more of a grain of salt.  I literally felt like a voice in the wilderness.

	<p>As I look at the great number of participants in this workshop and listen to the reports of their activities, achievements and goals, I can say that I am extremely happy and gratified.  The understanding of the need to teach our young people the basic principles of environmental awareness and ethics has grown   by leaps and bounds.

	<p>Many years ago, I approached one of the district superintendents of schools in our area and tried to make clear to him that we need to take our children out of doors to educate them about nature.  He told me that teachers would not be able to control children outside of the classroom, would not know what to teach them, since outdoors they would encounter unexpected and surprising things, and finally that this approach to education was a "frill".  

	<p>I showed slides to the workshop participants of children exploring seashore, forest and pond.  I talked a bit about the nature program for children which I have conducted for seven years on local TV, and of my children's nature centre in Fundy National Park.  I ended with pictures of the interpretive center and marsh boardwalk at the shorebird reserve at Mary's Point, where I now work and reside.

<p>
<p>

<p>There are many logical connections between science curriculum and using the school yard as a resource.  Some of the following illustrate this link:
<BR>
<p>Grade 1: 		Living and Non-Living, The Earth, Seasons of the Year
<p>Grade 2: 		Habitats of Plants and Animals, Environment and Plant Growth
<p>Grade 3:		Communities of Living Thing, Atmosphere is Air, Measurement
<p>Grade 4: 		Plants, Aquatic Habitats
<p>Grade 5: 		Weather and Climate 
<p>Grade 7: 	 	Living Things
<p>Grade 8: 		Diversity of Living Things, Interactions
<p>Grade 11:	Environmental Science
<BR>
<p>DIFFERENT STYLES OF LEARNING

	<p>Students are encouraged to learn in a variety of ways in order to find that which is most appropriate for them in a given topic.

<p>AUTHENTIC EXPERIENCE

	 It is recognized that, where possible, actual experiences are far more instructive than reading, viewing video or watching a demonstration.

<p>BALANCED CURRICULUM

	<p>Learning involves knowledge, skills and attitudes.

BEYOND KNOWLEDGE 

	<p>As students experience learning, they should not simply accumulate knowledge but also develop generic skills which may be used to improve learning and communication.

<p>STUDENT CENTRED

	<p>School grounds and local nature trails provide a place for authentic (student controlled) observation, data collection, hypothesis development, and experimentation.

<p>PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE

	<p>It is recognized that students develop better understanding and appreciation when new knowledge is, "constructed" on previous experience.  Local outdoor resources are most familiar to students.

<p>EXTENDING THE LIMITS

	<p>As students progress from primary through senior school, the limits and range of local resources may vary.  The concept of environment and community takes on a broader context.  Students may assume greater responsibility for directing their inquiries and presenting their learning.

<center><H3>HOW TO INVOLVE THE COMMUNITY</H3></center>
<center>ANNA LEBLANC President, New Brunswick Home and School Association </center>
<p>





	<p>In the past, Home and School Associations have been perceived as the fundraisers for school projects.  These projects usually complemented the operational budgets of the school and were "the icing on the cake", so to speak.  Today, with budget cutbacks and restraints at the departmental level, we are no longer funding the "icing", but are purchasing part of the "cake".  Such basic materials as photocopier supplies, stickers and art supplies are funded through the Home and School.  

	<p>There are two opinions which parents express about fundraising.  One group simply disagrees and feels that students and parents should not fundraise to supply the goods which should be part of their budget.  These parents feel that we are feeding into the hands of the government who will only create further cutbacks and expect further public funding.  The other group of parents believe that their children should not ,and will not ,do without.  This is the group of parents who will brainstorm and fundraise, involving community participation.

	<p>Home and School Associations have been involved in a number of large projects, which include playgrounds and learning grounds.  Three are a number of good examples such as the St. Andrew's project, where the community raised $25,000.  Claude D, Taylor School in Moncton developed nature trails fro their students.  Presently, Frank L. Bouser is in partnership with the community and they are developing an expansive playspace for their students. 
 
	<p>As parents and educational partners, we realize the importance of outdoor playspace and learning grounds.  Children, not only need fresh air and exercise, but need to develop respect and understanding of the world around them.  The children of today must be taught to preserve their planet.  Teaching can go beyond the four walls of the classroom and into a more natural setting.

	<p>I believe there are a great many benefits which can be derived from learning grounds, not just for students, but for teachers and the community at large.  Learning grounds should be a project sponsored by the community and nurtured by those who live within a community.  With the help of Home and School and other interested groups, I am sure these projects can become very successful.

<p>HOW TO INVOLVE YOUR COMMUNITY

<p>1) Form a Committee.  If there is a Home and School Association in your school, 	make sure that the president or a member of the executive is on your committee.

<p>2) Set clear goals and objectives; a feasibility study would be a useful tool.

<p>3) Present a proposal to your school board and make sure that you have their  consent for your project.

<p>4) Present your project to the community, utilizing school facilities. 
 	You should invite:
<UL>
<LI>	MLA's
	<LI>School Board members
	<LI>prominent Business Partners
	<LI>Parks and Forests
	<LI>Town Planning
	<LI>Members of the community
	<LI>Parents 
</UL>
<p>5)	 Conduct a personalized follow-up to individuals.  Do not be pushy.  Ask if they would 	like to support your project and in what capacity.

<p>6)	 Start your fundraisers involving students, parents and teachers.

<p>CAUTIONS

<p>1) 	Develop your project in phases.  Do not overwhelm yourself or others.

<p>2) 	Check out liability policies with your school district.

<p>3) 	Inquire with your school board regarding maintenance.

<p>4)	Supervision of the area

<p>5)	 Vandalism

<p>
<center><H3>JOHN CALDWELL SCHOOL LANDSCAPE PROJECT</center></H3>

<center>BEATRICE LONG, Vice Principal, John Caldwell School </center>
<p>


<p>FUNDING

	<p>The John Caldwell School had undergone an expansion from a junior/senior high school to a kindergarten to grade 12 school.  With the construction completed, the school was expected to hold an official opening.  The community was anxious to be invited to our new facility, so we took these opportunity to combine the opening with a celebration.  The idea was brought to a staff meeting and teachers were asked for input  It was decided to issue invitations for a Saturday afternoon opening followed by a reception.  In addition, we planned a dance for the evening.  We booked the Thomists to play for a St. Patrick's Day dance and planned the opening for that time.  Tickets were sold for the dance and profits were to be used for our landscaping project.

<p>RESEARCH

	<p>As with the opening, the idea of landscaping was taken to a staff meeting.  A committee was struck to oversee the project.  One teacher took the idea to her Biology 102 class.  They developed a landscape plan.  They began with the cement boxes in the front courtyard which was measured.  Students at all levels were surveyed for their ideas on plants, trees and shrubs as well as colour combinations.  The biology class  visited a local nursery to investigate appropriate types of trees and shrubs as well as prices.  The students used the information  to complete the landscape plans, which were recorded and presented at the next staff meeting.  

<p>ORGANIZATION

	<p>A committee was set up to oversee the landscaping project.  Students from K to grade 12 were surveyed to see who was interested in planting trees and shrubs.  Fifty-three teams were set up, each consisting of older and younger students.  With the  plan from the Biology 102 class and help from the principal and the local nursery, the trees, shrubs and perennial flowering plants were chosen. The list of teams was posted along with planting instructions.  The Biology class staked and identified each planting site and paired each with a team.  The instructions were reviewed in homerooms  and students were invited to search out the site to which their team was assigned.  The date was set for the morning of May 17, 1991, rain or shine.  This day was chosen because it was a half day for students.

	<p>Arrangements were made with the nursery for delivery of plants, plastic for soil, fabric, mulch, stakes, fertilizer, and a representative from the nursery to be present.  One student was designated photographer.  Students were asked to bring shovels.  The measurements were double checked by the teacher and maintenance person.

<p>PLANTING

	<p>May 17, 1991 began with a downpour that lasted all day.  Students gathered in their homerooms as usual.  They had been advised to dress appropriately for the weather and for the job.  The level of excitement was very high.  Students were called by teams to the cafeteria and brought to the planting sites.  They followed the plan which had been distributed. First, the grass was removed and placed on the plastic provided.  The top soil was shaken from the grass onto the plastic and saved for later.  A hole was dug to the appropriate width and depth for the plant and the soil placed on the plastic.  A nursery supervisor was available for advice, as were the teachers.  Once the tree or shrub was planted, the hole was refilled placing the best topsoil first, near the roots.  The soil was smoothed and fabric and mulch placed as directed by the supervisor.  The trees were staked but since it was raining, it was not necessary  to water the plants.  Once the job was finished, the plastic sheets containing the sods were taken to the flatbed.  The photographer was called for a group picture of a job well done.  There was a tremendous atmosphere of co-operation and pride.  By the end of the morning, the landscaping was completed and the site was clean.

<p>UPKEEP

	<p>The students enjoyed a tremendous boost in school spirit.   They can still be seen pointing out their tree to classmates, parents and visitors.  Most of the trees and shrubs have not been touched or damaged.  The 1991 graduating class erected plaques identifying the trees in the front flower boxes and the occasion on which they were planted.
  
	<p>Only two trees have been lost and have since been replaced in Arbor Day ceremonies.  The flower beds at the front of the school are tended by various science classes as the need arises.  Each year, one teacher brings in her geranium cuttings to be used in  the biology class.  Some of the cuttings are also given to the kindergarten class.  Both groups root them and tend them for replanting in the spring.  The experience has nor only improved the look of the school, it has been the instrument for science lessons over the years and has given everyone a sense of ownership in their community school.  As a new group of students come to us each year, we feel the need to find other opportunities to work as a community for our school.

<p>

<p>The session was geared for discussion. The presenter shared resources currently available to schools related to playground design, use and maintenance, as well as materials available for outdoor instruction of survival skills.  The information shared made reference to:

<p>A Guideline on Children's Playspaces and Equipment:
<BR>A National Standard of Canada- Canadian Standards Association

<p>The Universal Playground: A Planning Guide
<BR>Province of BC Special Education document #FCG 129

<p>Community Collaborative Playgrounds: Conference Proceedings
<BR>available through the Department of Education or Early Childhood Centre at UNB

<p>Looking at Playgrounds: A Collaborative Approach to the Assessment and Development of Community Playspace
<BR>Available through the Early Childhood Department at UNB

<p>Publications from CMCH
<BR>Creative Playgrounds kit-Playspaces for Pre-schoolers
<BR>Play opportunities for School-aged Children

<p>Lost and Found : An Outdoor Survival for Children
<BR>Targeted for grades 4-6; teacher's guide and posters available through the Department of Education, Department of Municipalities Culture and Housing:Recreation Branch or the New Brunswick Outdoor Recreation Council

	<p>Further discussion centred on the concept of residential outdoor centres where children would visit on extended 3-4 day trips to continue classroom learning, only while in the outdoor environment.  The development of outdoor leisure skills would be combined with multi-disciplinary focus on the theme approach to instruction.  As this discussion took students away from the school facility, the group brainstormed all of those teaching and learning concepts available just outside the classroom window.

<p>

	<p>The emphasis in this session was to provide many examples of how the natural world is or can be made an integral part of the existing curriculum.  The presenter shared with the group specific references to outdoor learning in New Brunswick curriculum documents,  as well as suggestions received from colleagues in the Curriculum Branch.  These were discussed, with participants contributing examples from their own experience.  The conclusion was drawn that all areas of the curriculum  are enhanced by outdoor learning.  It was agreed that most outdoor projects are inherently cross-curricular, which we saw as an advantage to both teachers and children.

	<p>The following example is drawn from Elementary School Science: Life Science, Grade Three, Communities of Living Things, New Brunswick Department of Education
 
<p>An environment can be sampled: Use the school grounds, a local park or an open space.  Give groups of students a hula hoop or string and four popsicle sticks.  Ask each group to define a site with the hoop or string, and to examine the animals and plants in the site using a magnifier.  Sketches of the observations should be made for later identification.  What were the features of the site? List the type and number of creatures found.   How are these creatures related?  

<p>Re-create the site environment:  In a transparent container, have children build a terrarium for the classroom.  Stock this with plants and some creatures found in one of the sites.  Observe the interactions in the terrarium.

<p>Simple creatures are important:  Build an earthworm farm and have students observe the activity within the community.  What important functions do worms perform?

<p>Plants and animals have methods of protection: Study reveals that communities exhibit predator-prey relationships.  Plants and animals have developed methods of protection.
<p>(a) Camouflage:  Have pairs of students find and explain how a selected plant/animal protects itself through camouflage.
<p>(b) Behaviour: Have pairs of students find and explain how a selected animal protects itself, and other members of the community, from predators.

<p>Students may enjoy dramatizing these behaviours.

<center><H3>PREPARATION OF SOILS IN SCHOOLYARD PLANTING</H3></center><BR>
<center>BOB OSBORNE, Corn Hill Nursery</center>
<p>

<p>>DEALING WITH COMPACTED SURFACES

	<p>Schoolyards are subject to intense compaction from people and vehicles.  Highly compacted soils contain little oxygen, which soil microorganisms and plant roots use to grow and reproduce.  Without such activity a soil is infertile.  Moisture cannot easily penetrate compacted soils.  It will  generally run off where it cannot be used by the plant.  Roots also have a difficult time penetrating compacted soils.  Trees planted in such soils will grow very little if at all.  

	<p>When planting trees or shrubs the compacted surface must be loosened to a depth where the bulk of the root systems will be.  Width is at least as important as depth because most roots travel horizontally, generally within 30 cm of the surface.  Once planted, the area around the plants should be protected from compaction.  If possible it is advisable to plant in groups, with an organic mulch wherever possible.  A grouping  of plants is less likely to be trod around than an individual plant.  As they grow together, the plants shade the ground, lowering ground temperatures in summer and reducing light levels of the surface, making weed growth more difficult.  This reduces the penetration of frost into the ground.  Mulches also help in this process.  In larger groupings, provide pathways to keep traffic to certain areas of the bed.

	<p>It is important to make the children understand why their foot traffic is detrimental to the growth of the plants.

<p>MAINTAINING SOIL DENSITY

	<p>It is critical that the soil underlying the prepared topsoil does not change density radically.  If the topsoil layer is underlain with a very dense layer such as clay, or heaven forbid, asphalt or cement, the water will not be able to move down through the soil and saturation of the soil can occur.  Roots of larger shrubs, and particularly trees will be able to anchor in the ground and will be apt to blow down.  They will often die. Very porous materials such as crushed rock or gravel can be equally injurious .  The soil over such material will dry rapidly, causing stress, especially in summer dry periods.  Such materials are virtually devoid of organic matter, the source of plant food cannot sustain plants.

	<p>It is important to dig a test hole to examine the underlying material and, if necessary, to remove it and replace it with a suitable subsoil of similar density to the topsoil.

<p>CREATING LIVING SOILS

	<p>The soil in which the plants are placed will have the most immediate effect on the short and long term growth of those plants.  Be sure to incorporate organic matter in the form of compost, rotted materials such as sawdust or bark.  While these materials can be valuable, they contain a very high percentage of carbon.  When the soil microbes attack the carbonaceous materials to break them down, they will use any available nitrogen  in the soil, temporarily depleting the plants of the nitrogen that they need for growth.  If using such materials be sure to include an ample supply of nitrogen-rich materials such as animal by-products.

	<p>Mulches are a good way to provide organic material on a continuing basis.  As mulches are digested by soil organisms, they should be replaced.  This can be done each year or two.  By simply adding a light layer of mulch to the surface there is no appreciable drop of nitrogen levels in the soil zone used by the roots.  You create a situation similar to the yearly rain of leaves and twigs in a forest.

	<p>It is of the utmost importance that the children be taught how plants feed.  They need to know that soil is not simply ground up rocks but is a complex world of animal and plant life, an ecosystem as important as the systems that inhabit the surface.  It is the soil life that feeds the plants in their schoolyard.

<p>THE IMPORTANCE OF PH

	<p>The acidity level of the soil is extremely important in plant growth.  It is important to find out the optimum acidity level or pH of the plants you are using.  Once this level is confirmed by a soils lab, you can get recommendations as to whether or not you need to adjust it.  Most plants grow best in a pH range of 6-7 (7 is neutral).  If the soil is lower in, you will need to add ground limestone.  If it is too high you may need very acidic soils to thrive.  The importance of establishing the soil's and the optimum levels for each plant species cannot be overstated.   This simple adjustment can be far more effective in optimizing growth than any amount of fertilizers or other amendments.

<p>INVOLVING THE COMMUNITY

	<p>Children should be involved in all of the above mentioned processes.  By teaching children how plants grow in the soil and how the soil life and chemistry influence growth, you will get them much more intimately involved in their garden.  You will hopefully also teach them that the soil is as important as the rainforest or the oceans to their health and survival.

<center><H3>THE GLOBAL GARDEN PLOT: MAKING THINGS HAPPEN</H3></center><BR>

<center>ANN COFFEY, Green School Project Coordinator</center>

<p>Sir Joseph Banks, the 18th-century traveller and naturalist, accompanied Captain James Cook on the first great voyage of the HMS Endeavour to Tahiti to observe the transit of Venus, and then on to New Zealand and Australia.  Banks kept a detailed journal throughout the voyage.  Among the wealth of information in his writings the following incident is of particular relevance today.

<p>Sailing into what is now known as Botany Bay, he records that the Endeavour passed four Aborigine canoes, in each of which was a man spearing fish.  He writes, "The ship passed within a quarter of a mile of them and yet they scarce lifted their eyes from their employment; I was almost inclined to think that, attentive to their business and deafened by the noise of the surf, they neither saw nor heard the Endeavour go passed them.

	<p>"A little later the ship anchored opposite a small village of six or eight houses.  Women and small children were on the beach. They looked often at the ship, but expressed neither surprise nor concern.  In a while the four fishermen returned to the village, hauled up their canoes and went about their business, again totally ignoring the Endeavour which was anchored just half a mile away."

	<p>Banks did not speculate further on this remarkable behaviour.  Is it possible that the Aborigines were looking at the ship but, in a way, not seeing it, unable or unwilling to take in something so far beyond their everyday experience?
	
<p>We have the equivalent of an Endeavour sailing towards us, something that will inevitably change our lives in the next few decades.  We know the very real threat of forced change is there, but we are collectively refusing to face reality, refusing to see it, refusing to recognize the danger and act to prevent the collapse of the world as we know it.

	<p>In 1941, the global population was 2.3 billion. Now, in 1994, it stands at almost 5.7 billion.  At the current rate of increase of about 2% per year, it will be around 8.2 billion by 2025.

	<p>More that 90% of the additional 2.5 billion people will be living in the underdeveloped nations of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. How can the global environment - the atmosphere, the water, the soils, the forests - support the economic aspirations of the developing world together with the ever-increasing demands of the developed world?

	<p>The answer is that it can't.  We know that it can't.  But isn't it an extraordinary thing that we can carry on our daily lives as though this were not happening?  We are not so very different to the Aborigines who refused to see the Endeavour.

	<p>However, we are in a better position than the Aborigines to understand why we are in denial mode globally.  Denial is both an understandable and a perfectly natural reaction resulting from the shock of being confronted with the unprecedented threats to our survival.
	
	<p>Denial is a natural mechanism the body uses to help heal psychological pain.  Along with shock, anger and despair, denial is one of the phases of the grieving process we experience following the loss of a beloved family member, friend or pet. 

	<p>It is quite possible that we are grieving prematurely for the anticipated loss of the natural world as we know it. Simultaneously though, we are denying that this can ever happen because it has never before happened in human history.  

	<p>At least part of our collective inaction seems to result from not knowing how to personally start the ecological restoration process.

	<p>I am convinced that global environmental, economic and social health will be the outcome of millions of small-scale, locally-based greening projects initiated at the grassroots level.

	<p>There is a rapidly spreading global movement to create outdoor classrooms on school grounds with the cooperation of the school community and all sectors of the broader community.  Of all the global movements currently underway, the transformation of school grounds holds the most promise for the rehabilitation of the Earth.  The way we do business with the Earth must change.  We are essentially living in a failed system.  Our system obviously doesn't work otherwise we would not be transforming fertile ecosystems into deserts, eliminating one entire species every six minutes, precipitating global climate change by overloading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, dismantling the ozone layer, and pouring millions of tons of wasted resources into landfills and incinerators.

	<p>It is a biological axiom that no living organism can survive long in its own wastes.  In Nature everyone's waste is someone else's diet.  We are creating wastes that nothing else can use.  These often toxic wastes are bio-accumulating and interfering with natural processes.  Therefore, our primary task is to help ourselves and others, and especially the young, learn how to work with, instead of against, Nature.  Aldo Leopold said, "We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us; when we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect."  

	<p>It has often been stated that there is no greater teacher, or healer, than Nature.  There are many interesting cases to show how working with the natural world can not only teach us important life lessons but also, in the process, modify our patterns of behaviour.  For example:

<UL>
<LI>	In Boys Town, Nebraska, Father Flaherty founded a home for "wayward" youth who are successfully rehabilitated through participation in intensive gardening as well as religious/ spiritual programmes.  The Boys Town "Garden of the Bible" is composed largely of plants referred to in the Bible.

<LI>	In San Francisco State jail, twelve acres are under cultivation. The inmates grow produce which is donated to a local soup kitchen.  A much lower recidivism rate is reported among the prisoners occupied in the production of plant foods.

<LI>	In Dorchester penitentiary, an inmate tended a garden for several years.  Only a fortnight following his release, he reappeared requesting a return to prison that he might look after his garden again.

<LI>	During the recent Los Angeles riots, the only things that emerged unscathed were the community gardens; that is, patches of urban land that were completely in the care of residents.

<LI>	In many cities in the USA where street crime has worsened over recent years, municipal officials have experimented with blocking off streets to traffic and encouraging residents to cooperate in planting shade trees and gardens of flowers and vegetables. Crime levels have dropped and community interaction has greatly improved in these experimental areas.

<LI>	The Greening of Harlem project involves planting school yards, "waste" open spaces, roadway verges, and the soil around the base of street trees with the participation of different sectors of the community.  A young black carpenter has enlisted unemployed black youth to help with the building of wooden play structures designed with children's input.  All reports on these projects emphasize the resulting positive changes in attitudes and behaviours as well as in community values.

<LI>	On Vancouver Island, B.C. Mental Health funds a successful programme whose purpose is to rehabilitate psychiatric patients through horticultural therapy.

<LI>	Studies show that in geriatric care illnesses associated with the elderly can be prevented or their severity reduced by having seniors engage in gardening activities.

<LI>	In hospitals, it has been proven that patients' post-operative recovery time is faster when patients grow plants, have plants around them, or simply have wall-sized views of woodland scenes to look at.

<LI>	When the Council of Women began the Halifax Playground movement in 1901, it was soon discovered right across Canada that anti-social behaviours declined in the areas served by the play grounds.
</UL>

	<p>In Britain, the Learning Through Landscapes (LTL) projects to green up school grounds has had some remarkable results.  In 1990, four years after the start of the LTL project, some 20% of British elementary schools were actively involved in "greening" initiatives to transform their expanses of pounded grass and asphalt into exciting biologically and socially-diverse spaces for play, study and delight.  Children who hitherto had hated school were suddenly eager to get there, resulting in a drop in absenteeism.  Anti-social behaviours such as violence, vandalism, littering, graffiti and bullying either completely disappeared or dramatically declined in schools where the greening projects were ongoing.  "Knock and bump" school yard accident levels were down by as much as 80% because obstacles in the form of raised planters, seating and trees calmed the school yard by diminishing the speed of children.  By developing interest and intricacies in the school landscape, the children's wild movement through it was arrested - rather like the way in which speed bumps and changes in surface textures on residential roads have a traffic-calming effect.

		<p>In 1990-91, impressed with the attitudinal and behavioural changes that had taken place in so short a time at the elementary level, some British high schools began to directly involve students in making similar educational and environmental improvements to their school grounds and, once again, the results are noteworthy.  Within one year, drop-out levels decreased as school life became more relevant and meaningful.

		<p>In 1991, the small county of Hampshire in southern England engaged four researchers to track the rate and kinds of changes among young people in the county's schools that are implementing outdoor greening projects. Positive changes happened so fast that researchers could not keep pace with them.

		<p>It has been well-documented that environmental improvements lead to positive changes in behaviour patterns.  Students involved in the planning, development and care of school grounds transformation projects experience an increased sense of belonging and a sense of ownership.  Aggression and vandalism are all less likely and less tolerated in a school community where everyone is cooperating to create and sustain an enjoyable environment.

		<p>The movement to create outdoor classrooms on school grounds has now spread across Europe. The Swedish government is funding the re-greening of 15 schools and will be monitoring and evaluating the changes over time.  Sweden's Skolans Uterum (the outdoor school), which is the Swedish equivalent of the Learning Through Landscapes Trust, hosted the first International School Gardens conference in May 1994: the second three-day event is planned for May 1995.

		<p>455 Malaysian schools are participating in a "School Within a Garden" programme.  Down under, Australian and New Zealand schools are re-greening in much the same way as the British and European examples.  Many positive things are happening in schools and neighbourhoods in the United States where communities are organizing to improve their environments and, therefore, their quality of life.  Russian schools are also joining the movement.
	
		<p>In Canada, The Evergreen Foundation in Toronto has recently received funding for several conferences across the nation. Considerable interest is being shown in this "hidden curriculum" approach to solving many of our environmental, educational, social and economic problems.

		<p>Some of the more progressive school boards in southern Ontario are leading the way.  For example, the Wellington County Board of Education has recently approved the development of an outdoor environmental education centre on every school site.  The Scarborough Board has recognized Canada's signing of the Biodiversity Treaty, and intends to support this by promoting local, national and global habitat conservation, starting with their own property.

		<p>The Waterloo Board is in the process of naturalizing the grounds of twenty-three schools, with another eight ready to start work. The Etobicoke Board's West Humber Collegiate has been an environmentally-focused school for five years.  Other area school boards are preparing to follow their lead.

		<p>Canada, in conformance with the recommendations in the Brundtland Report "Our Common Future" and the Environmental Summit at Rio, has agreed to set aside 12% of land to be preserved as wilderness.  At present, Canada has only 5.2% of land protected as wilderness areas; however, this is an improvement of 1.8% over the 3.4% of two years ago.  Many people are working hard to protect the remaining 6.8% of our commitment.  We need to concern ourselves with the rest - the unprotected 88% which presumably is up for grabs for the logging, mining, hydro-electric, sports and agricultural industries.

		<p>In order to be able to understand the value of the natural world and our total dependence on ecosystem health, children need to be in regular contact with Nature.  In spite of Canada's having a huge share of the world's remaining wilderness, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society estimates that only between 3% and 5% of Canadians ever experience wild areas.
	
		<p>In fact, Canada has one of the most urbanized populations in the world with about 85% of Canadians living in an urban setting.  It is not enough to take children periodically out of urban environments to experience Nature at outdoor education centres. We have to concentrate on working together to bring Nature back into our daily lives in a way that will help us learn to live within the ecology of the land, and, therefore, within the Earth's carrying capacity.

		<p>Greening up the global school grounds with the active participation of young people and the community through every stage of the planning, development and maintenance process will without a doubt prove vital for wilderness and non-wilderness land protection in the future.  It also has the potential to help reduce anti-social behaviours and restore community integrity, to teach us how to become a conserver rather than a consumer society, and to work within the Earth's regenerative processes.

		<p>In creating "outdoor classrooms" on your school grounds you will run into obstacles and at times you are bound to feel discouraged to the point of abandoning your project.  I speak from my own experience as well as that of others.  Once, when I had almost resigned myself to the disintegration of a particular greening project, a friend gave me a timely boost by reminding me that perseverance is often the difference between success and failure. Failure is not an option.

		<p>Here, I'd like to pass on to you the concluding remarks of participants at the Durham Board of Education's Third Environmental Summit:

	<p>"Nothing we are doing in education from math, music and drama to science, history and geography will matter at all to the children in our charge if Planet Earth is damaged beyond repair."

	<p>"If we fail to make environmental education happen, we will have failed in our primary mandate as parents and teachers."

		<p>We must not fail.  It is vitally important that everyone working to promote the greening of school grounds keep networking and keep encouraging and supporting one another.  We have an obligation not to give up.  Quite literally, everything is at stake.  As members of the local and global community, each one of us has a tremendous responsibility to help this global school greening movement succeed, not only to present and future generations of our own species, but to all species.

		<p>Regarding school grounds restoration, the question is not usually whether to begin, but how.  Generally speaking, people often have difficulty getting started, in knowing what to do, when and where to do it, who to involve, and how to include their input.  One of the most effective ways to develop a cooperative, whole-community approach to school grounds transformation is through the consensus decision making process.  We have a tremendous amount of expertise within our own communities.  The greater the range of community expertise among the participants in school greening approaches, the more exciting and dynamic the process, as well as the end product.  The first step in the consensus building process is talking about whether to talk.  In this case, school greening concepts would be presented to various constituencies for their consideration.

		<p>The next step, talking about how to talk, involves identifying and including all parties with a significant interest in the outcome.  Next, it is very important to ensure that all parties have equal opportunity to join in designing the process and in participating effectively throughout the process.  Finally, at the implementation stage, talk is turned into action.

		<p>Some excellent guiding principles for consensus building have been jointly developed by the provincial and territorial round tables on the environment and the economy.

<center><H4>SLIDE PRESENTATION NOTES</H4></center>

	<p>		After the presentation, several delegates requested a copy of the set of slides shown.  Forty-six slides have been selected from the sixty-seven shown at the conference. The following notes on individual slides and groups of slides, together with the showing of the slides themselves, should help presenters explain the need for, as well as the scope of, school grounds transformation.  In addition, they should also feel comfortable describing the social, educational, environmental and economic benefits of creating outdoor classrooms on school grounds with the active participation of young people.

	<p> 3)	Typically, school  yards are barren, windswept spaces with asphalt  and/or pounded grass surfaces.  Usually, there is little or no seating, shade or shelter.  Apart from traditional fixed play structures, there is very little in the school yard to interest children.  School grounds are an under-used resource with enormous environmental, educational, and social potential.

	<p>		Children spend over 25% of the school day outside in the school yard.

	<p>4)	Solitary natural features such as shade trees are literally loved to death since they attract children. This tree is the only shade tree on this school's grounds in Ottawa - for 550 K-6 children!  The Canadian Dermatology Association estimates that one in seven Canadian children will get skin cancer in their lifetime - so why do we not ensure that the provision of shade facilities, and sun smart education on skin and eye protection, become commonplace at school?

	<p>5)	The appearance of the front of the school, the image presented to the outside world, is generally of greater importance than the educational quality of school yards.

	<p>6)	Natural areas on school grounds naturally attract children, but they are often out-of-bounds.  Sometimes access routes to the school are through areas of unmanaged or unmanicured natural vegetation.  These areas are often considered dangerous by urban parents concerned about their children walking through them on their way to and from school.

	<p>		There is a definite paranoia towards naturalized spaces in urban areas which can only be overcome over time through education and whole community involvement in re-naturalization processes.

	<p>		The task of re familiarizing communities with Nature to the point where the reintroduction of wilder, or less- intensively managed, spaces into the urban environment is not only acceptable but desirable, can be accomplished through the creation of outdoor classrooms on school grounds.

	<p>7)	Over the past decade, the success of the Learning Through landscapes approach to school grounds transformation has now spread across Europe, and to Australia, New Zealand, Russia and North America.

	<p>		This school yard is surrounded by heavily-trafficked roads.  The 15-25 ft. wide banks of vegetation now screen the ugliness of roadways, and help to filter out dusts, vehicle exhausts and noise.  Recent studies show that vehicle exhaust and noise reduce concentration and learning ability in children.

	<p>		There are numerous areas within the banks of shrubs and trees where teachers hold classes.  The outdoor classrooms are used for math, geography, language, science, art, drama, history and music.

	<p>8)	Providing niches planted with native species that offer food and shelter for wildlife has brought a wide variety of birds, small mammals, amphibians, butterflies, pollinators, and self-sown plants into the school environment.  The potential for incorporating well-planned outdoor classroom experiences into the curriculum is limitless.

	<p>		Many inner city schools are receiving financial assistance from Esso Britain, who are working cooperatively with LTL, to break up the severity of asphalt rectangles, to create wildlife habitat, make exciting play spaces, provide seating, build amphitheatres, and plant vegetable, herb, shade, sun, perennial, annual, water-efficient, and wildflower gardens.

	<p>		It is vital to ensure that grounds transformation happens at a rate that is slow enough to allow the school community to get into the habit of using the outdoor classrooms on an on-going basis.  The objective is not just to improve the aesthetics of the grounds, although this will be one of the outcomes, but to develop grounds for learning.

	<p>9	Pond-building has captivated the imagination of a high percentage of the British schools engaged in school grounds transformation projects.  The pond gardens are varied in design, shape and size and planted with an assortment of aquatic plants such as cattails, pond weeds and water lilies.  Schools report that within two to three weeks of adding the water, wildlife such as frogs, damsel flies and dragonflies have miraculously appeared.  Children throughout the country are tremendously excited about their ponds.

	<p> 	Southern Ontario, one school prohibited the addition of a bird bath in case someone drowned in it! Considering the depth of puddles and springtime meltwater on school property, this precaution seems quite absurd.  In over ten years of school pond-building in Britain, there have been no accidents.

	<p>		This pond has been constructed in an asphalted area that was unused by the school, between the front of the building and the high street.  It attracts a lot of attention from passers-by, particularly when a class of children are out catching aquatic creatures to study pond life.

	<p>		This kind of spontaneous community contact has resulted in offers of help and donations of plants for the school gardens from neighbours and local businesses.

	<p>10)	The playground of this same urban school was once nothing but asphalt.  Following breaking up the asphalt around the edges of the yard, the children participated in planting the shrubbery.  They planned and planted it, and have thus taken ownership of "their" green space and protect it accordingly.  The trees have been planted in raised beds to not only safeguard them from being accidentally mown down, but also to provide seating along the planter edges.

	<p>11-12)	Two examples of school ponds.

	<p>13)	A remarkable diversity of gardens can be developed in even relatively small spaces.  These can include vegetable, wildflower, perennial, herb, pond, and edible wild food gardens; banks of native trees and shrubs with bird feeders, nesting boxes and bat boxes; checkerboard gardens laid out chessboard-style with two feet square mini-gardens in between concrete pavers; mazes made of bales of straw or earth covered with turf; composting gardens; sculpture gardens; gardens with raised planters where the wooden, stone, concrete or brick retaining walls serve double-duty as seating space.

	<p>		Small shrubs and ground cover can also be planted around shade trees that are strategically placed around play structures, sand boxes and sports areas to provide protection from ultra-violet B radiation.  Due to the depletion of the ozone layer, it is essential to provide shaded spaces on school grounds.

	<p>		One child interviewed in Britain commented that before the greening process began the school yard had only one bit; afterwards, it was "a place with millions of bits" (which is a great definition of biodiversity).

	<p>14-15)	Composting organic lunchtime and school yard waste is an important component of grounds transformation. Composting reduces the quantity of organic waste going to landfills (typically one third of domestic waste), cuts the cost of waste disposal and the purchase of commercial fertilizers for the school board, and teaches that this valuable resource can be used to improve the health of impoverished soils.

	<p>16)		Logs left to rot naturally provide a space to study soil decomposers and the processes of death, decay and regeneration.

	<p>17-19)	In British and European schools keeping livestock such as sheep, goats, ducks and chickens is becoming increasingly popular.  Goats and chickens are particularly useful for reducing cafeteria waste unsuitable for composting on school grounds.  Sheep in movable pens are used to both mow and fertilize grassed areas.  Several schools are also engaging children in beekeeping activities.

	<p>20-24)	School gardens can encompass a remarkable variety of learning opportunities.  Gardens of annual and perennial edible flowers can be grown to expand children's gastronomic experiences.  Pansies, nasturtiums, clover, violets, edible chrysanthemum, chicory, borage, soapwort, and primroses can all be added to salads.  There are also many wild plant leaves used as salad greens, but they must be carefully researched or assistance and advice gained from local botanists.

	<p>		In Vancouver, the Canadian Office of Urban Agriculture's City Farmer programme is helping a local school with food production projects.  It is ecologically beneficial for children to learn that the average mouthful of North American food travels 2-3,000 kilometres, to connect their food needs to different geographical regions and peoples of the world, and to know the impacts of our dietary intake on important ecosystems such as tropical rain forests.

	<p>		In England, schools have grown small patches of different kinds of grain which children harvest and grind into flour using a pestle and mortar.  Such activities help children make vital connections between their own needs and the needs of the land.

	<p>23-29)	Schools in Britain and Europe are using their grounds for all areas of the curriculum.  Outdoor art activities include drawing, painting, designing, sculpture, pottery using clay dug out of the ground on site, and tie-dyeing using dyes made from plants specifically grown for that purpose.

	<p>		One school built a planter, filled it with soil and waited for plants to move in.  Children identified the plants as they appeared, and studied methods of seed dispersal.

	<p>		Amphitheatres of mounded earth have been built for the performing arts.  Math is taken outdoors to measure, calculate, and analyze real objects and spaces, and come up with group findings.  Reading, writing, researching and investigating are based on the activities generated by outdoor classrooms.  Science and geography become more meaningful in an outdoor environment.

	<p>		And even looking at the historical use of the school lands can add another dimension to history lessons. For example, one school in Britain found fragments of clay pipes buried in the soil.  Upon investigation, it was discovered that an early Victorian pipe factory had once stood there.  The school extended this experience further by inviting an archaeologist in to demonstrate the excavation of artifacts.  The school then went on to research the history of the neighbourhood.  

	<p>		Painted lines, mazes and games on paved playgrounds add interest to gym, and traditional community activities such as maypole dancing are being revived.

 	<p>25-26 )	Playgrounds can be very exciting places; however, more often than not children find school play structures quite boring.  An exemplary playground in England has painted a variety of activity-generating designs on the asphalt.

	<p>		There are capital and lower-case alphabet snakes (each snake divided into 26 sections, one for each letter of the alphabet), a hundred square (a square divided into a hundred, one for each number from 1-100) where children can count in ones and in multiples of twos, fives, tens, etc., a maze and a magic circle.  In addition, there is a pile of large tree trunks to climb and sit upon, several tires and tunnels to climb through, and quiet seating areas for children to sit and just talk "secrets".  The play space also has several unusual-looking objects designed with children.

	<p>		Painting chess boards on asphalted yards and playing with huge, made-at-school chess pieces is a popular whole-class activity.

	<p>30)	In schools where removing areas of asphalt is impractical or too costly, inexpensive raised planters can be built on top of the paving. This enables individuals and groups of people confined to wheelchairs to participate in school gardening activities.

	<p>31-32)	The Malaysian Ministry of Education runs a "School Within a Garden" programme with about 455 schools currently involved.  There are garden competitions between schools and students must raise their own funds for plant material. Some fund raise by collecting newspapers to sell by the ton for recycling.

	<p>33-34)	The monotony of large expanses of bare walls and fences, which often give a factory or prison-like feeling to the school, can be easily relieved with the use of climbing plants, ceramic bas reliefs and painted murals. 

	<p>35)	The school grounds can become exciting spaces for learning and experimenting in a creative and meaningful way.  A wide variety of multi-purpose projects designed to integrate different subject areas can be built on the grounds.

	<p>36-38)	Recycling and reuse can be demonstrated by salvaging materials that would otherwise be landfilled and using them in an imaginative way.  Local municipalities are often willing to rescue, for example, stones and construction wood waste, as well as tractor tires and large concrete pipe sections from the landfill free of charge.  Old bath tubs, sinks and toilet bowls can be used as planters.

	<p>39)	Displays such as these puzzles (the answers to the questions are under the puzzle pieces) help to raise awareness on our impacts on the environment.

	<p>40-41)	Some schools are using their grounds to explore renewable energy technologies.  Such projects help young people understand that we can and must develop technologies that work with rather than against nature.

	<p>42-44)	The acceptance of school grounds transformation by the school community and the wider community has led to the ecological restoration of backyards and city parks. London, England now has 53 wildlife parks.  "Waste" land is being cleared of many years' accumulation of garbage.  One such site in London, Camley Street Gardens, now attracts a great deal of attention worldwide.

	<p>		Instead of highly manicured gardens, home owners are now developing spaces for wildlife.  An off-shoot of this is that nurseries have started to grow wildlife-friendly native species hitherto unavailable commercially.

	<p>		Increased environmental sensitivity has created new consumer demands.  For example, the depletion of wetland habitats has led to the development of moisture-retentive alternatives to peat moss.

	<p>45-46)	In Europe, the spill-over from school grounds to backyards, city parks, roadway verges, and waste spaces was almost the inevitable result of involving the whole community in their planning, development and maintenance.  This German example of an ugly intersection with a dangerous crossing for pedestrians was transformed into a more aesthetically-pleasing roadway which provided pedestrians with street safety as well as interesting green space.

<P> 
<H3>Acknowledgements </H3>

<P>

                                
     It may be impossible to thank everyone that made the Hyland Butterfly 
Garden a reality as so many people played a part in this project. First we 
must recognize the students of Hyland Elementary, especially those in the 
Environment Club, who wished for a garden and spent many hours working to 
prepare the ground for planting. One teacher in particular must be thanked 
as well, Ms. Linda George, for without her leadership and hard work the
garden would never have become a reality. Many parents too were instrumental 
in supporting and working on the project, and the co-operative partnership 
between the PAC, represented by Kim Denman, and the school staff was the 
key to our success. In this experiment of community partnership, it has 
become apparent that the organizational role of parents is necessary in 
the process of naturalizing school grounds. We also owe thanks to :
<P>
Mr. Harold Reesor, a retired civil engineer who provided invaluable advice, 
seeds, and generous amounts of time to help us raise butterflies & design
the garden.    <P> 
Mrs. Lucy Bain, Principal, who gave approval and support to the entire project.
<P>
Mr. Burt Deeter, Principal, Acting, who continued with unflagging support and was              there to open the school and
participate in planting on a Saturday. 
				<P>		       
Kindergarten Students of Ms. Bryson, decorators of the butterfly's lovely 
flight cage.<P>

Div. 3 Students of Mr. Lewis builders of cement stepping stones.
<P>
Div. 1 Students of Mrs. Uren the muscle power who spread a load of top soil.
<P>

<P>
Div. 2 Students of Mrs. Morrison growers of borage plants & ground cultivators.
<P>
Div. 6 Students of Mrs. Davies  grass & weed excavators
<P>
Div. 7 Students of Ms. Danielson more grass & weed excavators 
<P>
Shane Wilkinson, Lindsay Couture, Stevhan Worboys, Jason Maruschuk, and  
Shere Mahnke -  feeders and guardians of the butterflies in the school.
					     <P>

<P>

	There are many more plants which could be added to the garden
as time goes on, but those listed are an excellent start. We also considered 
that some of the trees, shrubs and wildflowers that already exist in the 
area nearby are part of our garden ecosystem. They include:
<P>
Red Alder alnus rubra: Larval, Swallowtails  <BR>
Paper Birch  betula papyrifera: Larval, Swallowtails<BR>
Pacific Dogwood cornus nuttallii: Larval, Gossamer Wings<BR>
Trembling Aspen populus tremuloides: Larval, Swallowtail <BR>
Fireweed  epilobium angustifolium: Nectar        <BR>               
Clover  trifolium repens(introduced European species): nectar & larval food <BR>
Thistle cirsium arvense: Larval food for the Painted Lady     <BR>              
Stinging Nettle urtica dioica: only known wild larval food for Red Admirals<BR>
Wild Borage boraginaceae symphytum (also commonly called Comfrey):Larval food
for the Painted Lady <BR>
Dandelion taraxacum officinale (introduced European species) Nectar<BR>
Foxglove  digitalis purpurea (introduced European species) Nectar<BR>
<P>
Note: Also found in the garden is Red Flowering Currant (ribes sanguineum), 
a pretty native shrub attractive to hummingbirds, as is Columbine
(aquilegia formosa), a perennial flower.



<H3>GROUND COVERS</H3>
	 
	While not directly beneficial to butterflies, we included some
native ground cover to keep down weeds, hold soil, and create an 
"understorey" in the section of the garden located at the top of the hill.  
All of them  produce berries which are popular with birds.
<P>
Bunchberry  cornus canadensis<BR>
Salal  gaultheria shallon    <BR>
Oregon Grape  mahonia nervosa<BR>
Kinnikinnick  arctostaphylos uva-ursi<BR>

		     <P>

<H3>WISH LIST:      </H3>
Some plants that would be nice additions are:
	
High Bush Cranberry  viburnum edule: Larval, Swallowtails         <BR>
Thistle: Nectar        <BR>                                           
Hops   humulus lupulus:  Larval,  Red Admiral      <BR>       
Joe-pye Weed  eupatorium:  Nectar <BR>
Pacific Crabapple  malus fusca: wonderful for birds <BR>
Garry Oak  quercus garryana  - would provide acorns for squirrels; 
	   (best if planted north of the garden on the slope)<BR>
Dill: Larval,  Swallowtails               <BR>       
Alfalfa: Larval, Gossamer Wings          <BR>        
Forget-me-not: Nectar<BR>

	This butterfly garden is an ecosystem created for our winged companions.<BR>
	  It is our legacy, and will grow with us into our futures.

<br clear> <br>

<P> 
<H3>Raising Painted Lady Butterflies</H3>

<P>

 


	In April of 1995, Hyland obtained 35 Painted Lady butterfly
caterpillars from North West Laboratories. These larvae came with a food 
supply and small individual containers into which they were placed. No 
special care was needed at this time, other then to keep them relatively 
quiet and out of bright light. Within about 10 days they positioned themselves in a "J",
hanging head down from the lid of the containers and  shed a final layer of 
skin to reveal the hard chrysalis "shell" beneath. At that time the lids of 
the containers were removed and with the chysalis' attached, they were taped 
to  the "ceiling" of a specially prepared flight cage. This flight cage
was a large cardboard box with a door, two large viewing windows covered with 
the clear plastic used to  insulate inside house windows, and several 
ventilation holes covered with fine netting. It was beautifully painted on 
the exterior by our Kindergarten students and lined inside with pink 
construction paper. The bottom was lined with layers of paper that could be
removed as needed for clean up.<P>
	 In about one week, the lovely Painted Lady butterflies began to 
emerge. This was an exciting time for students, staff and parents alike! 
Everyone was captivated by the emergence of this delicate new life. Nectar 
flowers, including lilac and creeping phlox from pesticide free gardens, were 
placed in water jars in the cage, and soon seed grown borage plants (the 
larval food) were added. Shallow pans with paper towel soaked in sugar water 
( 2 teaspoons sugar per cup of water) were also placed in the cage to provide 
additional nectar for the butterflies. With the nectar and larval food 
supplied, the butterlies were able to mate and lay eggs. And lay eggs they 
did! Hundreds of tiny blue pearl-like spheres were laid on the borage, 
and elsewhere too as the butterflies were forced to lay in any place that 
seemed available. This was due to the artificial conditions they found 
themselves in; as a butterlfy lays its eggs, it leaves behind a scent that 
warns other butterflies away. In the wild, butterflies would be free to 
travel a wide area and distribute their eggs more equitably. <P>
	 The Painted Lady adult butterfly only lives for about two weeks, 
and we soon had to release our butterflies. A few died before this was done, 
and a few of the caterpillars never emerged, but our success rate was about 
90% overall.   Most of the eggs were taken out and distributed in several 
locations on wild borage and thistle plants. Some were adopted by students
who were able to provide the proper conditions for raising them, and about 
50 remained in the school so that we could enjoy a second generation of 
butterflies. These we look forward to releasing as they emerge, in the garden 
that has been specially prepared for them and their relatives! <P>
	By far the most rewarding part of this project has been the truly 
enjoyable learning that has taken place. Many students never knew that 
caterpillars became butterflies, and many parents and staff never considered 
the need of butterflies to have larval food plants available for reproduction. 
The balance of ecosystems was demonstrated through the study of this species, 
and the realization that pesticide free plants, especially native plants, 
are truly valuable in our environment was made by many. It seems likely that 
the sheer delight of sharing the butterflies company will be a lasting memory 
for many Hyland students, and judging by the number of caterpillar observers 
we have, (every caterpillar found outdoors is a subject of interest) they 
will value them highly now too.

Our tour of the North Vancouver Outdoor School (NVOS) begins
before 7am PST.  In our case we left by train but, we could have also chosen a bus. We met Principal Victor Elderton at the BC Rail station in North Vancouver British Columbia, where he organized the tickets and made sure everyone was ready to leave. Victor starts each week of the school year by meeting a new group of students bound for NVOS either here at the train station or at a bus pick-up point in North Vancouver.
<p>
We board a 1 CAR (!) BC Rail train and head north towards
Brackendale. Our trip will take about 1 hr 45 mins (Traveling with us are skiers, tourists and others, most of whom are taking the luxury route to Whistler. Round trip cost for them is $52, including a great breakfast or dinner). It's one of the greatest short train rides in the world.

Project Summary</H2>
	<P>

   
 
<IMG SRC="resnsbchaarergazebo.jpeg" align=right border=0>
The goals of our project are to involve the children in 
planning, building, planting, and maintaining their school 
grounds that will become a stimulating place to play and learn.  
We began with our "Imagine Your School Grounds" project where 
each child drew up a plan of the grounds.  All these ideas were 
incorporated into a Master Plan, drawn up by Grade 2/3 & 7 students.  
We are now implementing parts of this Master Plan.  Phase I was a 
gazebo and raised bed structure; this provides shelter, seating, a meeting 
place and a place to garden.  Phase II, now complete  with help from the 
Evergreen Foundation was to create a Butterfly Garden.  This garden was 
planted by the entire school; the Grade 4/5 studied butterflies and nectar 
plants and raised Painted Lady Butterflies in the classroom.  
They were released on June 4/96 into the Butterfly Garden.  The 
whole school was invited to the 4/5 class to observe the process and 
the release.  Every Wednesday the parent committee gardens with children.
<p>
<b>Helpful hints/suggestions:</b>
Involve the children in planning and planting.  Consult with all the staff 
and Maintenance staff of school board.  Have a strong and enthusiastic core 
group of gardeners (5 to 6 people; and 2 or 3 willing to help with classroom 
activities).  Keep good records so everyone is clear as to procedures etc.  
Keep activities with children to small groups and be clear as to the activity.  
Keep good records especially photos of past projects for future fundraising or 
grant applications.  Thank everyone--especially donors.

<H3>Ecole Pauline Haarer,
<p> Naniamo, BC
<p>
A Butterfly Garden and Gazebo</H3>
	<P>

    Two years ago the schoolyard of Pauline Haarer Elementary, a  French
Immersion School in downtown Nanaimo, began a quiet transformation.  Inspired by
the work of the Evergreen Foundation, Victoria Drakeford a landscape architect
and Darcy Johnston a garden designer, both with two young children at the school,
drew a parent committee together.  They hoped, with the students' help to create
a more interesting, diverse and natural schoolground.
<P>
     In the spring of 1994, the committee was ready for the first phase of the
project and we asked each student to "Imagine Your Schoolyard".  On small site
maps students filled the  paved and open landscape around the buildings with
their visions of the perfect schoolyard.  The process of being consulted for
their opinion delighted the students and they let their imaginations run from
waterslides to rollercoasters.  Along with the unfeasable was a resounding
request for more vegetation, trees, vegetable and flower gardens, pathways, ponds
and a covered area outside for gathering in the rain or sun.  Armed with the
childrens' plans and with the support and co-operation of the principal, teachers
and schoolboard, a masterplan for the grounds was drawn up.
<P>
    A garden gazebo was top priority and we set about gathering the materials and
manpower.  In the end the gazebo was built with over $2000.00 worth of donated
materials and volunteer labour, including children hammering nails.  It was
completed in the summer of 1995.  In September it was dedicated to the outgoing,
long-time principal and the students filled its raised beds with bulbs and winter
vegetables.
<P>
    Later that winter students gathered with shovels and wheelbarrows along the
front of the school as each class planted a street tree, provided through the
Green Streets Program.   In the spring of 1996 we received a Healthy Schools
Initiative grant as well as an Evergreen Foundation grant for native plants.  We
were ready to start our next project!  With the generous help of schoolboard
machinery and donated soil we prepared a 30' by 40' plot which had been a
neglected piece of lawn.  Over the course of the day each student in the school
participated in planting our butterfly garden.  By the end of the day we had put
in over 100 specimens of native rose, ocean spray, mock orange, elderberry, 
saskatoon, highbush cranberry, shrubby cinquefoil, red-flowering currant, and
salal as well as wild cherry, hazel and garry oak seedlings.  Students seeded
plants useful to butterflies, tending them on classroom window ledges, then
planted them out.  Among the framework of  native shrubs and trees were many annuals, 
bachelor buttons, cosmos, nasturtiums, poppies
and perennials like daisies, buddleia, sage and artemisia.   On one fine day in
late spring the school gathered in the garden and set free Painted Lady
butterflies which the grade four class had raised from larvae.
<P>
    By mid-summer, after careful watering and weeding by the volunteer committee 
the butterfly garden was in full riotous bloom.  One of the students, sitting in
the shade of the gazebo gazing through its strings of scarlet runner beans, at a
Western Tiger Swallowtail pausing briefly on a huge sunflower, said incredulously
"I can't even remember what was here before".
<P>
    The schoolyard committee is still going strong and ready to move on to the
next phase of creating a richer landscape for learning and for play at Pauline
Haarer School.

<P> <br>
Removing  asphalt is a bold step - but one which will dramatically change
the face of any school yard.  This June, most of the pavement at  Christ
the King Elementary  in Whitehorse, Yukon, was broken  up and replanted
with the natural vegetation of the area, lodgepole pine.   The final plan
was developed by  landscape designer,  Marianne Darragh, after she was
taken on a tour of the schoolyard by students, who advised her on how the
schoolyard was used and then suggested changes. that they would like to
see.
<P> <br clear>
<IMG SRC="nsykchristking4.jpeg" align=left border=0>
<P> <br>
In this case, two sections of asphalt were removed, measuring 100 by 100
feet and 100 feet by 60 feet respectively, at the cost of approximately
$3500.  Costs can be reduced by contracting a company that recycles
asphalt.    The total cost of the naturalization project at Christ the King
was $60,000, one third of which was funded by the Yukon Board of Education.

<P>
<center><H2> Queen Mary Greening Project</h2> 
<h3> Vancouver, BC</h3></center>
 <br> <br>
 <IMG SRC="resnsbcqueenmaryboy.gif" align=left border=0>
	Thank you for your interest in our Greening Project.<p>
	
  Our goal was to improve the outdoor environment in which our children 
  learn and play.  Although our school is set in a beautiful neighborhood
   the schoolground more closely resembled a concrete pit.  Our committee
    was struck in September of 1994 and immediately set to work on designing
     a plan to bring nature into our schoolyard.  Meanwhile, the students 
     raised funds to finance this project by way of a walkathon and the 
     sale of the school trampoline.  <p>
	

	After much effort and fine-tuning the building began in March 1995. 
	 The courtyard area was graced with beautiful decorative pear 
	 trees which are covered in fragrant white blossoms in spring. 
	  The planters are filled with interesting, even quirky varieties 
	  of plants.  We chose things which would provide the children with
	   different textures, colors and fragrances, taking care to choose 
	   varieties that bloom during school months. 
	   
<p>
The cedrus will grow across the back of the fence and droop down 
to create a dragon effect!  We have left room for the children to 
plant bulbs in the fall and the teachers will be free to use the garden 
for their class science projects.  <p>
	  <IMG SRC="resnsbcqueenmarytree.gif" align=left border=0>	
	The benches are built double-wide to allow several children 
	to gather together.  We took special care to design the height 
	of the planters so that they would provide seating for parents 
	and children.   We have placed more benches around the school
	 area to provide pleasant seating areas for many more children.  

	 Another area of improvement is down the main driveway into the school.
	   Here we have planted young maple trees of a variety which will grow
	    upright so as not to interfere with the tall fence surrounding the
	     field.  The finishing touch is our "Welcoming Tree ", 
planted at the entrance to the school property.  It is a big maple 
tree which will turn scarlett in fall.  We then built a hexagonal
 bench around the base of this tree to create an inviting meeting 
 spot for parents and children.  <p>

	Our final purchase this year was two special garbage 
	containers which add a splash of color to the play area and 
	are designed to prevent the crows from scattering garbage all 
	about.  These have been such a hit that we are hoping to purchase 
	several more next year and in time we may eradicate the problems
	 of the crows altogether.        
<p>
	I hope this summary of our project, and the "before and after"
	 photos help to illustrate to you how this sort of endevour can 
	 benefit your community and enrich your child's schooling environment.
	<p>
  	<b>Yours truly,

	Janet MacPhail, 
	
Greening coordinator</b><p>

<P>
<center><H2> Queen Mary Greening Project<p>
Planning</h2> </center>
 <br> <br>
<p>
	
The Queen Mary project began with a simple suggestion from our new principal, Murray Stephenson.  He felt that the look of the schoolyard was a little bleak and that it could be improved by the planting of a few trees.  The idea really took off and the result is a stunning improvement.  I hope that these suggestions will help in your own planning process.
<p>
 <IMG SRC="resnsbcqueenmaryteam.gif" align=right border=0>
<b>Strike a committee<br></b>
-Interested parents will offer to take on this project.  The best people for the job are; an organizer, an architect, an expert gardener, and several interested helpers.  The organizer, architect, and gardener form the core group.
<p>
<b>Early meetings<br></b>
-these will be brainstorming sessions and may be frustrating as the focus seems to switch and change.  Try to view this as a good thing, as it will allow you to speak confidently about your choices when they are challenged later.  There are bound to be critics as the job gets underway and it is comforting to know that you have considered lots of options prior to making the final plan.  Eventually, the ideas will be honed down to a workable plan which can then be presented to the school board.
<p>
<b>Involve as many people as possible<br></b>
-ask for parental input through the newsletter and at monthly meetings.  Send a committee member to speak to the students' council asking for student ideas and priorities.  One or two teacher representatives will inform you of the teachers' thoughts for outdoor classroom opportunities.  If your project involves neighbouring community facilities, speak to their representatives to get valuable support and interest.
  <p>
<b>Later meetings<br></b>
-Once you have canvassed many people at the start of the project it is necessary to reduce the number of active committee members to the core group, the principal, and one or two others which may change from meeting to meeting.  This will allow for more decisive meetings and less frustation.  Other members will still be called upon to help, but it isn't necessary to try and get all members out to each meeting.
<p>
<b>Fundraising<br></b>
-Your project must be funded, or at least promised to be funded, before the planning goes too far so that you know what the scope of the work will be.  Student, parental, and community fundraising is beneficial in creating a sense of pride in the project.  This will be important over time to help prevent vandalism and deterioration through neglect.  Fundraising should also include the application for funds from local groups such as Evergreen Foundation, Vancity, local merchants associations, etc.  ö      
<p>
<b>School board involvement<br></b>
-Once you have a rough idea of what you would like to do, contact the school board maintenance department to arrange a meeting at the site.  These people are vital to your project and have years of experience in dealing with the restrictions and special limitations of schoolyards.  You will discover that some of your ideas have been tried in other schools and have been disastrous.  Your meeting with the maintenance department will surely result in changes to your plan but they will be for the best.  Once again, remember that you will be asked to defend your choices later and it helps to have considered many options. ≈      
<p>
<b>Drawing up the plans<br></b>
-This is where your architect is invaluable.  The best thing to do is to obtain a copy of the schoolyard blueprint and work from that.  It will tell you of underground waterpipes etc. and will be a good starting point.  Be as specific as possible, including measurements of planterboxes, materials preferred and plants desired.  If your site is near roadways, be sure to find out about firelane restrictions.  û      
<p>
<b>Plant Materials<br></b>
-Choose plants which are native to the area, reducing the need for maintenance and improving the chance of freedom from disease.  We chose plants which would be intriguing to children by way of appearance, texture, color, and smell.  Plants were chosen so that they would do their thing during the school months.  Room was left to allow space for children to plant bulbs in fall.  *      
<p>
<b>Formalities<br></b>
-Once your project is fairly definite, write to the school board facilities services department to obtain a budget for the work.  They meet at specified times during the month and once your plan is received and approved it will be passed on to maintenance for a quote. P      
<p>
<b>Getting quotes<br></b>
-As with any building project, it is recommended that you get at least three quotes.  This is where the school board can be very competetive.  They are able to provide many plant materials at minimal cost and the labor is reasonable.  Be sure to discuss all plant and building material choices with maintenance as there are many restrictions for schoolyards.  Once you receive all quotes and adjust the plan to meet available funds, write to facility services again.  This time you are informing them of your plan to go ahead, and how much you plan to spend.
<p>
<b>Work begins<br></b>
-The starting day of the project will be very exhilarating.  It will also bring out many people who now feel compelled to offer advice!
<p>
 <IMG SRC="resnsbcqueenmarykidsjump.gif" align=left border=0>
<b>Completion<br></b>
-The job, once started, should be completed as soon as possible to avoid the problem of vandalism. The coordinator may need to pressure the crew to stay on task if they have more than one project on the go.
<p>
<b>Maintenance<br></b>
-Summertime maintenance is especially necessary during the first year.  A schedule of parent volunteers for the hot months from early May to October will be necessary to allow plants to become established.  Encourage all parents, students and teachers to "own" the garden.  Everyone should feel welcome to pull a few weeds while waiting to pick up their children, or resecure a new plant which has become loosened from its bed.  This ownership was wonderfully illustrated by an event which happened at our garden in May, soon after it was completed.  One weekend, as part of a child's birthday party activities a group of several children came to the schoolyard.  The parents distributed purple pansy plants amongst the girls who proceeded to plant them all around the beds.  Those pansies came as such a delight to everyone, and they continued to bloom right through to the fall.  In addition, the day care planted tomato, corn and sunflower plants which grew wildly and provided a fabulous surprise to the students returning to school in September.
<p>
<b>Finally<br></b>
-This is a huge undertaking and requires a lot of time.  The coordinator's job will be to pull it all together and constantly prod the other committee members to do the job they have been assigned.  The results will be well worth the effort.

				<p>

<P>
<center><H2>Hyland Elementary School(Surrey, BC):<BR></H2>
	This butterfly garden is an ecosystem created for our winged companions.<BR>
	  It is our legacy, and will grow with us into our futures.</center>



<P> 
<H3>Introduction </H3>

<P>

                                


	The Butterfly Garden at Hyland Elementary was planted on Earth
Day, April 22, 1995, by  parents, students and staff. Approximately 30 
enthusiastic volunteers turned up and in 3 hours accomplished a great deal 
of work. They planted, shoveled dirt, cemented in the log post wall and 
constructed planter boxes for the playground shade trees.  Students in the 
school Environment Club wished for a garden, and the club leader, Ms.Linda 
George, felt they could obtain the optimum benefit from a native plant 
garden. This could provide a place that demonstrated how ecosystems function 
and also give children a concrete opportunity to have a positive effect on 
their environment. <P>

<A HREF="resnsbchyland1.html"><IMG SRC="nsbchyland95during1.gif" align=left hspace=10 border=0></A>The decision 
to focus the garden on butterflies evolved from meeting 
with Mr. Harold Reesor, a local butterfly expert, and from the opportunity 
to raise Painted Lady butterflies in the school. Butterflies, as well as 
other insects, are considered indicator species for our environment similar 
to the historical canary in the coal mines. Butterflies have declined quite 
dramatically in the Lower Mainland, largely due to loss of habitat and such 
things as aerial spraying for the Asian Gypsy moth. A garden planted for 
butterflies is pesticide free and includes nectar flowers for the adult 
butterflies to feed on as well as the larval food plants required by the 
caterpillars. While adult butterflies seem fairly adaptable in finding the
nectar they require from a variety of flowers, the caterpillars tend to be 
very specific in their food requirements. 
<P>
	Not surprisingly, many of the larval plant foods required by our 
native butterflies are those plants that are indigenous to this region.  
In making our plant selections, we  included the larval food plants we were 
able to obtain, while at the same time we needed to meet other criteria such 
as avoiding toxic species and those non native nectar flowers which could 
become invasive. The availability of native nectar flowers is extremely
limited, so other flowers were included to attract the butterflies to our 
garden. A few of the plants we chose were not directly beneficial to 
butterflies at all, such as the native ground covers, but it was necessary 
to include them for the overall health of the garden. They serve to hold the 
soil in place and to reduce the chance of unwanted plants  introducing 
themselves. 
<P>
	It is also worth noting that the garden will benefit other local 
wildlife such as birds, providing either the nectar required by hummingbirds 
or the berries eaten  by others, and even caterpillars themselves as food. 
A number of the native plants also have an interesting history of use by 
indigenous peoples; they were used for such things as basket weaving, food,
tools, and for medicinal treatments. 
<P>
	It is our hope that the garden will become an outdoor classroom, 
enjoyed by students and staff as place of beauty and used as a place to 
interact with and observe nature in their own "backyard."  We hope that the 
students will feel a sense of empowerment too, in realizing that they can 
make positive contributions to their environment. The garden may need
alterations in the future, but that is the nature of a garden, and the 
possibilities for additions are numerous. One parent suggested a collection 
of large rocks for geological interest, and the element of water would 
greatly enhance both the ecological and educational value. Frogs and 
tadpoles may show up,  butterflies require damp areas to absorb soil 
minerals, and birds always  enjoy a chance for a drink and a bath.
<P>
	Finally, the garden would not have been possible without the
commitment of parents to take on the task of maintenance, particularly those 
who will come to water throughout the summer. This will be essential to the 
garden's survival, and Hyland is fortunate in having enough volunteers to 
have undertaken the project.      
<P>

<BR>
Geoff Cape<BR>
Executive Director, The Evergreen Foundation</center>

<P>
<P>




In 1990, The Evergreen Foundation established itself as an organization dedicated to the protection and creation of natural urban areas through education and action. Since that time projects have grown to a national level with a broad spectrum of community involvement. Through community efforts, Evergreen is working to help change cities from concrete jungles into liveable and more balanced environments and to put people back in touch with the natural world. 
<P>
For many of us, cities offer hope and represent the future. The bright lights and prospects of economic opportunity have attracted over 70% of Canadians. Unfortunately, these cities are becoming increasingly unhealthy environments. The development of our urban centres with sky scrapers, shopping malls and industrial complexes has, to a large extent, excluded a place for nature. Asphalt tends to dominate our children's school yards and concrete dominates the corporate environment. The green spaces that remain are usually artificially designed and maintained with chemicals and watering techniques that are unnecessarily harmful to our fragile environment.  
<P>
Recently the environmental movement has been characterized by a focus on problems that lie beyond our cities. Issues such as the logging of old growth forests, oil spills in the arctic, fishing practices in the oceans, vanishing plants and animals and the depletion of atmospheric ozone have taken the forefront while the environmental issues closest to home have been somewhat overlooked. The sustainability of our urban centres depends on our ability to rehabilitate our cities and, in the long term, integrate our lives with nature. This process will depend on a coordinated community effort. 
<P>
In the past, we have tried to control nature. In our efforts to control it we have tried to add order to apparent disorder.  Consequently, our cities have, to a large extent, excluded a place for nature. The urban landscape is replete with examples of this need to control the natural world. We have constructed buildings to follow a grid of streets, channelled rivers to flow around and under our homes,  paved playing fields to hold the spring time mud at bay and designed the remaining green space with lawns and gardens that must be maintained with fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides.  All of this has been done in an effort to establish control and predictability.  
<P>
In our efforts to maintain control, we have applied our view that nature is disorganized and wild and in need of being tamed. We have failed to understand that order is lost when we try to add our sense of control. Those of us who live within the urban environment can move through an entire day without ever coming in contact with nature.  As a result, we have become disconnected from nature and we have distanced ourselves from nature to such an extent that we are incapable of regarding ourselves as part of the natural world. We have upset the inherent balance of nature, throwing the system into an unpredictable and unprecedented state of disorder.  
<P>
We pour chemicals on our lawns to kill the weeds without understanding that those same chemicals will end up in our drinking water. We clear our land of trees without understanding that trees filter the pollution from our air. We plant exotic plants without understanding that they invade and disrupt the existing natural balance of native species.  We pave our cities with concrete without understanding that we are destroying animal and bird habitats. We tend not to respect nature. 
<P>
Naturalization, a concept endorsed and practiced by The Evergreen Foundation, is a process of ecological restoration that encourages the natural environment to return to developed  areas. This alternative approach to landscaping blends environmental concerns with an appreciation of nature's inherent beauty. Instead of fighting natural processes, naturalization embraces them. Naturalized landscapes are intended to replace traditional high-maintenance landscapes with vegetation native to the local environment. Naturalization welcomes wildlife and lets vegetation take its natural course, allowing nature to exist freely and harmoniously with us in our developed world.
<P>
Through the process of urban naturalization, nature will be returned to our cities. We will begin to understand and respect the complex dynamics of nature and ensure the long term health of our urban centres. There are tremendous benefits in rethinking our reliance on traditional landscaping and reintroducing natural spaces to the city. These benefits include: a reduction of up to 80% in maintenance costs;  improved recreational areas; reduced use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides; natural filtration of air and noise pollution; reduced water use; improved  animal and bird habitats; and ultimately more beautiful and more livable cities.
<P>
As the 1990's progress, naturalization techniques are being adopted by a variety of urban landowners. Home owners are naturalizing their yards, corporations are converting their barren landscapes to forests, public parks are encouraging nature to return to open fields and schools are creating outdoor wilderness gardens. 
<P>
The concept of naturalization is a relatively new idea for urban landscapers and represents a significant departure from traditional  practices. This fact presents the need for education and community involvement to teach people to appreciate the beauty and value of natural areas as opposed to traditional, high-maintenance landscapes of mown lawns and formal gardens. 
<P>
In order to multiply the benefits and add depth and longevity to each project the naturalization process must involve the community. Involving academic institutions, government agencies, local businesses, schools and neighboring residents will help inform and educate the public about each project, develop community pride and encourage respect for the natural environment. 
<P>
Any given naturalization project takes a great deal of time and energy. For this reason it is essential to develop broadly based community support. Because one of the goals of each project is sustainability, it is essential that community members feel responsible for the success of the project.  Although most projects are initiated by one enthusiastic and dedicated person or organization, they succeed with the support of many people. Too often, most of the responsibilities fall on a select few, and the project can fail if the coordinators become too busy, lose interest in the project or leave the area. The entire community must be involved, for the process of establishing natural urban areas is as important as the end itself.
<P>
The idea of involving the community is to create tens of thousands of "stewards" for the natural areas in our cities. It is one thing to establish natural urban areas but the future of these spaces can only be guaranteed through the involvement and dedication of the entire community. 
<P>
Local community efforts concerned with urban environmental improvements require an integrated strategy. Although a strategic framework can be provided through policy statements and Royal Commissions, there is a need for a coordinated implementation system. Natural landscaping concepts call for the support of the larger community and must be adopted by the social infrastructure of governmental departments, urban planning offices and academic institutions.  
<P>
Governments must learn that cooperation is needed. Natural areas often cross political boundaries resulting in jurisdictional disputes. Political boundaries must be put aside to ensure that complete natural systems are preserved into the future. Governments must see a common end and work together in the planning and implementation of their respective mandates. 
<P>
Planners must ensure that a mechanism is in place to provide for the efficient implementation of valuable research. Proposals are all too often presented at great expense only to sit on a shelf. Planning departments must use their power to implement long term changes to create more natural urban landscapes through planning, implementation and management of public land.
<P>
Universities and academic institutions need to develop programs to prepare students to plan, implement and manage the developing natural urban spaces and assist with the research and study of these sites.  The process of naturalizing urban spaces can require extensive technical research and study of soil conditions, water and air quality and sources of pollution.  Within the urban community, universities represent the best mechanism to facilitate such work. Furthermore, academic institutions have a responsibility to society to  prepare its members for the future. Since the future sustainability of our urban centres depends on our ability to rehabilitate our urban centres, our academic institutions have a clear role to play. 
<P>
Community involvement from every corner is necessary to ensure the rehabilitation of our urban centres and ultimately this process depends on a coordinated community effort. 
<P>Urban life has given us everything we desire and more. But through it all we have failed to realise that the development of our urban centres is, in its present state, unsustainable. We must rehabilitate our cities through organized community efforts and, in the long term, integrate our lives with nature.  
<P>
Increased interest in natural landscaping and the environmental concepts that accompany it have given The Evergreen Foundation an important role to play in encouraging and facilitating the process of urban naturalization. As a result Evergreen has developed three core programs: School Ground Naturalization, to initiate and support educational naturalization projects on school grounds across Canada; Corporate Naturalization, to encourage corporate landowners to adopt natural areas on their lands; and Community Naturalization, to assist public landowners and local communities to establish more natural public open spaces. The goal is to improve the urban environment and help put people back in touch with the natural world by reintroducing natural spaces to our cities. 
<P>
This is an important movement, one that will have historical significance as it changes the face of our urban centres and the way we live our lives.

BILL GRANGER - METRO TORONTO REGION CONSERVATION AUTHORITY</center>

<P>
<P>





The Evergreen Foundation mission to promote and create natural areas in urban environments through education and responsible action is a good fit in partnering with many agencies, municipalities and community groups.
<P>
Partnership has become key to getting anything established - school boards, resident's groups, conservation authorities, provincial and federal agencies all speak of the importance of natural area regeneration, but none of these groups alone can establish plantings without co-operation and assistance (and often permits and funding) from other agencies.
<P>
A typical early community planting for Evergreen involved MTRCA, City of Toronto, Metro Roads, Evergreen Foundation staff, students from a local school and the local resident's association.  Amazingly, Evergreen didn't give it up in the face of this entangled process.
<P>
A number of similar and innovative partnerships, including some European private-public examples will be discussed.  Most of the partnerships have been great successes; at least one failed to navigate the entire inter-agency/ association process.  The lesson from each example is that if we are intent on leaving a greener more natural environment for generations to come, we all must work in co-operative partnerships to achieve this end.

PETER MEISENHEIMER <BR>past COORDINATOR OF THE SPEED RIVER PROJECT
GUELPH<BR> ONTARIO PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP </center>

<P>
<P>



PREHISTORY
<BR>

The Speed River Project was organised using the volunteer base provided by an existing annual garbage clean-up that had broad support in the community.  The Speed River Clean-up provided an opportunity to enlist volunteers interested in environmental work.  Because it was media-genic, media representatives were introduced to new ideas through a recognised and respected project.
<P>
We took names and addresses of volunteers at the annual clean-up.  Work team leaders gave the volunteers a pep-talk about our proposal and suggested that they might like to be involved in the project on an on-going basis.  We also scheduled alternatives to garbage clean-up on the clean-up day.  Volunteers were asked if they were interested in planting trees (or another habitat project) and we were able to assess the productivity of the crew through discussion. 
<P>
The clean-up ran during Environment Week, and through community contacts who were aware of our proposed work, we organised a public school to provide each student the opportunity to plant a tree.  We learned a great deal about the hazards of working with large groups but succeeded in generating a lot of positive energy in the community.
<P>
On the basis of the feedback and evaluation of the initial effort, we recognized the potential for a very popular project. 

<P>
ISSUES
<BR>
Tree planting seems like a pretty nice thing to most people.  However, there are many different ideas about why, where, and how trees should be planted.  There are some people who think that trees simply obscure their view of the river.
<P>
Identifying the issues to be addressed by our efforts was key to retaining our focus and eliminating confusion.
<P>
The tree planting we undertook was premised on a desire to improve habitat.  As a group initially involved in a river clean-up, we were concerned on the one hand that our garbage removals were not addressing the fundamental problems of habitat degradation in the urban watershed, and that we were keen to provide our growing base of volunteers with new opportunities to work in the watershed.
<P>
We identified three key issues which centered on the river and its habitats: channel habitat destruction, river impoundment and riparian deforestation.  We have undertaken work in all three areas but it is clearly the reforestation of the stream-banks that has generated the most interest in the community and provided the greatest opportunities to put volunteers to work.
<P>
Through all of our work we have kept the issue of habitat rehabilitation front and centre.  We make it very clear that we are not just planting trees, but planting habitat.  We seek to educate volunteers about the benefits of their work and explain to them the unique nature of the riparian habitat, the benefits to the river, and the importance of planting a diverse native plant community to speed the establishment of a healthy ecosystem.
<P>

SITES
<BR>

Once we had the idea clear, we went looking for sites.  Guelph is fortunate in having ample parkland adjacent to its rivers.  Most of this space is old landfill and in need of attention.  The parks department was interested in naturalization for a number of reasons, not the least because it would be cheaper to maintain natural parks in the long run.  They assisted in choosing priority sites and were clear about limits they wanted on the work.
<P>
Some areas had existing forest or ornamental plant cover that was either of low diversity or fragmented.  We tried to use these areas as nuclei for our efforts, seeking to connect woodlots to the river system, and to provide linkages between riparian habitats.
<P>
We participated in discussion that led to the formation of a parks naturalization policy that favoured the elimination of maintained turf along the river in any area with natural banks (i.e. not encased in concrete).
<P>
We were keen to work with private landowners upstream.   Agricultural activity has a significant impact on the quality of water coming into the city.  The Grand River Conservation Authority identified potential interested parties who were working with the GRCA on other matters, and we were able to gain their permission after an introduction and brief explanation of our goals.

<P>
DONORS
<BR>

Our first experimental efforts were fairly easy to fund.  We used our Environment Week budget to buy some gloves and refreshments, and convinced the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources to provide us with a modest budget for purchasing materials.  The GRCA kicked in some trees for the school to plant and the city provided us with some technical staff to keep us out of trouble. 
<P>
Once we had a sense of what was needed to achieve our objectives, we  developed a clear work plan and shopped  around.  We were refused by a city committee at one point, but generated enough news coverage of the rejection that several companies, service clubs and private individuals came forward to assist with donation.
<P>

POLITICAL SUPPORT
<BR>

If you can manage to build support in the community, people will start coming to you with ideas and donations.  We  enjoyed our greatest success by integrating diverse communities within the larger community of Guelph.  There is something very satisfying about watching the mayor hanging out in the river with green-haired punks.
<P>
Political support is attainable  if there is a general sense of gain through the association. I have managed to get good work out of the mayor, several councilors, the MPP for Guelph, and several aspiring candidates whose tree-planting efforts were just not enough to put them over the electoral top.
<P>
We learned this lesson well through the aforementioned snub from the city.  One of the committee members had an axe to grind with 'environmentalists' and was quite unpleasant.  A couple of years later she made the presentation speech at which we received an award honouring us for our work with the river.

GUELPH<BR> ONTARIO PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP </center>
 


KNOW YOUR SITE
<BR>

Understanding the physiography, existing plant community and history of your site are key to making informed decisions about what and where to plant.  Soil type, moisture and acidity, neighboring habitats, human use patterns, and potential for rodent and vandal damage are all important considerations.  For example, most of our sites have poor soils (many are abandoned landfill sites), are depressed by considerable human use and are prone to beaver and vandal damage.  Consequently, we plant mostly large stock (capable of withstanding human traffic), go to considerable lengths to beaver proof our trees and use hardy species such as cedar, silver maple as our basis.
<P>
Some areas are simply unsuitable for tree planting and the threat of destruction to another valuable habitat is ever present.  Meadows, wetlands, and shrubbed areas are as valuable as forests.  We would encourage the inclusion of these other types of naturalization in your project.  At the very least, think twice before over-planting a meadow with trees.
<P>

VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT
<BR>

You will need to recruit two types of volunteers; those interested in planting trees and those with specialized skills or resources applicable to the project.
<P>

TREE PLANTERS
<BR>

The Public
<BR>

The key here is raising your profile in the community.  Learn to work effectively with the press (see below). Develop a mailing list and newsletter, and write articles for other special interest publications. (e.g. naturalist club newsletters).  Develop a good display for community events and put up posters asking for volunteers.  
<P>
Schools
<BR>

High school students are a major source of volunteers.  In the past two years they have contributed the vast majority of volunteer hours to the Speed River Project.  A successful program, however, requires that your project fulfill their educational needs.  We present a 40 minute slide show on the environmental history of the Guelph River system, outlining the process of habitat degradation from deforestation, to storm sewers, to river channelizations.  This provides a basis to talk about local ecology and the need for naturalization.  We also provide planting and safety instruction.  This occurs several days before the field trip.  Alternatively we cover the same material on a walking tour of the naturalization site before the planting.
<P>
Service Clubs
<BR>
Forging a partnership with a service club will greatly improve your access to resources, particularly from the private sector.  The clubs are also able to pull out large numbers of volunteers and tend to be excellent fund raisers.  We have little experience with service clubs, but have received several donations and participated in community events they have organized.
<P>

SPECIALIZED VOLUNTEERS
<BR>
Chances are that you are not an expert in plant identification and selection, naturalization techniques, landscape architecture and educational programming.  Chances are equally slim that you own a large truck, 50 shovels, a desk-top publishing system and all the other resources you will need.  Fortunately all are available in your community - probably for free.
<P>
Naturalist Clubs
<BR>
Local amateur naturalists possess a wealth of knowledge about native plants, habitat types, and historical changes in wildlife populations - and they are usually delighted to share it.
<P>
Universities and Colleges
<BR>
Faculty, staff and students can be an enormous resource.  We receive much of our volunteer training and advice on species selection and site planning from the staff at the University of Guelph Arboretum.  We also regularly borrow shovels, hip waders, large BBQs, cold storage space etc.  Students and Faculty are also constantly looking for real life projects to work on.  Much or our historical research and site design were done by students working for course credit.
<P>
Municipalities
<BR>
As most of our work has occurred on city land, we work very closely with the Guelph Recreation and parks department.  They have donated many staff hours, equipment ranging from dump-trucks, to shovels, to back-hoes, to detailed site maps, to advice on tree maintenance.
<P>
Consultants
<BR>
In the past two years we have been fortunate enough to have a professional consultant specializing in habitat restoration volunteer with us.  He enjoys applying his skills to community work and makes valuable contacts with city staff.
<P>
Private Sector
<BR>
Many local businesses are willing to donate resources in exchange for a bit of free publicity.  There is no need to spend the going rate on food and refreshments for volunteers, truck rentals and pamphlet publication.  Some will even be willing to fund raise for you.  A local bar here in Guelph, the Woolwich Arms has raised thousands of dollars for us through golf tournaments, raffles, and soliciting donations from other businesses.  The larger your profile in the community the easier the support is to procure.
<P>

THE PRESS
<BR>
Few activities are easier to generate favourable press coverage than  naturalization.  The photo opportunity of a group of students planting trees seems irresistible.  Detailed coverage that includes the rationale for your work, however, requires more than a press release and a few phone calls.  Reporters are badly overworked and have little or no time to devote to research.  You will need to provide them with all the information they need for the story including the names and numbers of additional people they can interview.  Many press opportunities are not directly related to planting days.  Receiving a grant is a story.  Launching your school program is a story.  The historical information you gather, the invasion of exotic plants and the lack of availability of native plants from nurseries are all additional examples of stories that will highlight your project.  Take advantage of any and all!
<P>

NOT EVERYONE WILL LOVE YOUR WORK
<BR>
Naturalization has it's share of detractors, particularly when practiced on public lands.  Some people simply prefer manicured lawns.  You need to put as much effort in to educating the public and the decision makers as you put in to the actual work.  Our experience has been that most people support the work when informed of it's purpose.  Always have literature on site with you.  We've included the fact sheet we use in your package [proceedings, immediately after this section - ed.].  Take advantage of opportunities to conduct talks, site tours, and to take displays to public events.  An effective school program will also help immensely.
<P>
In the face of media controversy generated by a few vocal critics, we launched a survey of park users last fall.  The results showed overwhelming support for our work and assisted in City Council's reaffirmation of their park naturalization policy.
<P>

A FINAL WORD
<BR>
The real secret to establishing and keeping your project growing is opportunism.  Be prepared to shift direction, take on new partnerships, and even to abandon promising avenues that are simply not working out.  You are unlikely to have access to all the resources we have outlined - but will undoubtedly find many others unique to your own community.
<P>
Good Luck!

TIPS FOR LARGE PLANTINGS

<UL>
	<LI>Break your planting area into smaller units each with a couple of trained supervisors.

<LI>Mark out planting zones or even individual plant locations directly on the ground.  We use soccer field paint.

<LI>Be conservative in estimating how much will be planted.  Having 10% of 100 tree left over is a lot different than 10% of 5000 left over!

<LI>Ensure that you can care for the trees on site.

PRIOR TO AN EVENT


<UL>
	<LI>Seek expert advice regarding what trees and shrubs to plant


<LI>Trees and shrubs should be:
<UL>
	<LI> native
	<LI> hearty
	<LI>appropriate for the site conditions
	<LI> available from local nurseries
	<LI> salt tolerant (if planting next to roads)

</UL>
<LI>When dealing with nurseries, make sure you specify that all species substitutions must be cleared and that non-native plant material will be refused at the time of delivery.

<LI>Give yourself lots of time to arrange for utility stake-outs, mulch delivery, shovels, buckets, water, planting captains (core volunteers).

<LI>If you want to have a picnic or public relations event associated with your planting, have these things organized by someone other than the person organizing the planting.

<LI>Match the number of volunteers with the number of shrubs to be planted.  having a surplus or shortage of plant material can be problematic.

<LI>Establish good communication with your volunteers and volunteer groups.  Make sure volunteers know how to get to the site, what to do in case of bad weather (plant rain or shine), and what to bring.  Make sure you know, plus or minus, how many volunteers are expected (you may have to pressure volunteer group leaders to be realistic).

<LI>You may want to split the volunteers into smaller groups.  Split the site up and assign groups to parts of the site.  Assign planting captains to manage groups.

<LI>Make lists and pay attention to detail.

</UL>
DAY OF EVENT
<UL>
	<LI>Planting events are controlled chaos.  As long as people have clear instructions and are well supplied with materials, your event will be a success.

<LI>Supply of plant material, tools, mulch and water; have planting captains assigned to helping people find the supplies they need.

<LI>If you are not set up properly before the planting you will be in trouble.  Prepare!

<LI>Make sure there is someone on the site to care for the plant material.  Dry roots will kill a tree or shrub before it is planted.  Watch that material is not trampled by over enthusiastic children.

<LI>Reward the planters if possible - serve muffins and juice.

<P>







Restoration plantings require good planning in order to assist the regeneration of native plant communities and wildlife habitat.  The use of native species is paramount to preserve the bioregional integrity of your area.  Exotics either die out or conversely, take over.  The problem of invasive exotics such as purple loosestrife and Norway maple is becoming well-known, but it is not a central topic for this presentation.

It is not enough to simply approach a nursery, request a selection of native plants, order them, and get them to the site.  A number of things should be taken into consideration.  They fit under two main categories: the needs of the site and the availability of reliable, suitable native plants.
<P>

NEEDS OF THE SITE
<BR>

These include the "needs" of the land itself and your own needs and circumstances.  Under the former, one should consider the following:
<P>
What are the historic vegetation patterns on the site, or of the general area?  It is often good to use this as a basis for the planting plan, especially when expanding an existing natural area.
<P>
What are the conditions of the site now?  e.g. soil type, moisture, shading, disturbance conditions, etc.  It is important to match species to conditions (e.g. white oak prefers light, well drained soil whereas burr oak grows well in clay, even fairly disturbed; silky dogwoods like it open and wet, while alternatively, leaved dogwoods like shady slopes).
<P>
Biodiversity.  It is not necessary to plant an arboretum, but there should be a reasonably wide number of species used.  Do not plant just one or two species.
<P>
Then there are your own needs and plans:

<UL>
	<LI>Are you planting specifically for wildlife food and shelter?  Certain species are notable providers for wildlife.


<LI>How about aesthetic concerns?  Landscaping aesthetics can be a component of naturalization plantings, e.g. by roadsides.

<LI>Are you aiming at a specific habitat, e.g. wetland, meadow?

<LI>Once you have a planting plan, it may need to be modified according to the availability and quality of stock desired.  The selection of reliable plants requires research.  Native species are still somewhat difficult to obtain, although many nurseries now carry them.  BUT... it is wise to consider the following concerns:
</UL>

SOURCE
<BR>

Do the plants originate from population within the bioregion?  This is preferable though not always essential.  Or is the source of stock from a far-away part of it's range?
<P>

GENETIC BREADTH
<BR>
Many shrubs are cloned from cuttings.  All cultivars are single clones.  Seed grown material is preferred wherever possible, or find an array of cuttings from different genotypes.  Perhaps order from one nursery.
<P>

SUBSTITUTIONS
<BR>
Do not accept random substitutions which often mean you get exotics instead of the native plant you ordered (e.g. "we don't have Carolina rose so we sent you multiflora instead").  Designate specific substitutions BEFOREHAND for hard-to-obtain species (e.g. "If you don't have Carolina rose, please give us wild blackberry or sumac instead).  This way, you retain control.  Or specify that there be no substitutions.
<P>

MIS-IDENTIFICATION
<BR>
This is a very serious problem with several popular species used in restoration work (e.g. cranberry viburnum, alder and willows).  The stock is labelled as one of the species but is in fact another, since most growers do not know the difference.  Avoid notorious mix-up species or have a botanist check the stock before it gets planted.  Many invasive exotics have found their way in to restoration plantings this way.  Send the stock back to the nursery--"they will learn".

<P>
ALLELLOPATHY AND DISEASE HOST COMPATIBILITY
<BR>
Some species are not compatible with others because they secrete substances which inhibit growth (e.g. black walnut suppresses a number of other species); or because they form a duet of alternate hosts which pass the disease back and forth.  For example, currants and gooseberries are the alternate host for white pine blister rust; hawthorns and junipers also pass a rust back and forth.  Design the planting accordingly.

<P>
SPECIAL-NEED SPECIES
<BR>
Some plants are perfectly appropriate, but have special needs which must be considered.  Beech needs to have a mycorrhizal fungus around its roots to grow well.  Inoculate the planting hole with soil from a natural grove of beech.  Hemlock needs shelter from sun and wind especially during the first few winters after planting.
<P>

ETHICAL PRACTICES
<BR>
Do not accept material that you think has been dug from the wild (rescue sites excepted).  Try to work with nurseries that use good, fair business practices and that use a minimum of chemical pesticides or fertilizers.
<P>
Consider growing your own stock, with suitable instruction about propagation techniques.
<P>

WHY ARE ALIEN PLANTS A SERIOUS THREAT? 
</font size="+1">
<BR>
GAVIN MILLER, ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION</center>

<P>
<P>





Plants that are not part of the indigenous (native) vegetation, but that have been introduced into a region are called aliens.  For the most part, introduced, or alien, plant species form an important part of our environment, contributing immensely to agriculture, horticulture, landscaping, and soil stabilization.  But among the thousands of plant species introduced to our area, some have displayed unexpected aggressive growth tendencies.  The purpose of this fact sheet is to identify some of the more problematic species which, in many circumstances, threaten, or degrade native vegetation.
<P>
While most alien plant species do not persist in the wild, introductions since European settlement have substantially changed the composition of native plant communities throughout North America. Of the roughly 2600 vascular plant species that grow in the wild in Ontario, some 700 are not native to the province.  While many of these are restricted to roadsides and other heavily-disturbed sites, others readily invade natural and semi-natural landscapes.
<P>
Invasive alien plants typically exhibit the following characteristics:
<UL>
	<LI>Rapid growth and maturity;
	<LI>prolific seed production;
	<LI>highly successful seed dispersal, germination, and colonization;
	<LI> rampant spread;
	<LI>ability to out-compete native species; and
	<LI>high cost to remove and control.
	</UL>
Invasive aliens thrive on disturbed sites.  Native plant communities fragmented by human disturbances are most vulnerable to invasion, but even intact ecosystems can be invaded by the most aggressive alien species.  Invasive plants leave behind the natural controls (usually insects) that kept them in check in their native habitats.  Some aliens can hybridize with native species, suppressing genetic characteristics that are adapted to local conditions.  Biodiversity is further threatened when alien plants harbour pathogens, fungi, or other organisms that decimate native species, such as Dutch Elm Disease.
 <P>
AWARENESS IS CRITICAL
    <BR>

Awareness of the problems caused by invasive alien plants is the first step in preventing their continued use.  Public awareness will help increase responsible landscaping and conservation practices.  Awareness by resource managers will help prevent the introduction of these species on public lands and preserve our natural heritage.

<P>
HOW YOU CAN HELP
<BR>

Learn what species are native to your area.  Use native species, grown from local stock if available, for conservation and landscaping purposes.  If alien plants are used, avoid highly invasive species. Support public policies that restrict the introduction of invasive plants and get involved in organizations and agencies that work to protect biological diversity.  Ask your nursery to sell native plants propagated from local stock.  Plan and implement sound practices for the control of invasive alien plants in natural areas.  A list of invasive alien plants of Ontario is provided [below]

<P>
<P>







SITE PREPARATION
<BR>

Site preparation means getting the site ready for the planting operation.  What method you choose will depend on your budget, permission from the landowner, and after-planting care of the trees.  Good site preparation can greatly contribute to tree survival and fast growth.  No site preparation often results in high maintenance costs and/or high mortality.
<P>
Methods of site preparation
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>Mowing of grass<BR>
	The absolute minimum requirement will make planting easier but will not contribute to long-term survival.  Post-planting maintenance is vital.

	<LI>Clearing planting spots<BR>
	Usually done by hand.  Very labour intensive and planters will tire quickly.  All grass, weeds and their roots must be removed to be effective.  Make sure you turn grass up-side down around the cleared spot to prevent  the grass from re-rooting.
	<LI>Machine plowing or roto-tilling by tractor<BR>
	Clears all vegetation temporarily but will grow back more vigorously afterward.

<LI>Furrowing by tractor<BR>

An eight-inch wide strip of grass is flipped over to expose soil and planting is done in rows.  Bare soil will last about two years before weed invasion.  Easy for planters to follow the pattern and to mow the grass.  Good survival.
<BR>
Once the site is cleared temporarily of competing vegetation, it will need maintenance  after planting.  This will be covered later under site maintenance.

</UL>
PLANTING TECHNIQUES
<BR>
There are as many methods of putting the tree in the ground as there are people.  As long as the tree's requirements are met, any of them will do.  Choose one method and train planters to use it well and quality planting will be easier to achieve.
<P>
It takes only five seconds for a professional to plant a seedling (in prepared ground).  Planting operations, even community ones, need not be time consuming if we train people to plant efficiently and with quality.  Proper planting will get the job done faster and with less fatigue, so you can enjoy the party after.
<P>
Planting must be done by trained people to be successful.  A short training session at the beginning and practice under close supervision is necessary.  Do not let anyone plant without being trained and checked.  Even professionals make mistakes.
<P>
Planting should be done by people who have the physical size and strength to dig the hole with the equipment provided.  Often larger people can be teamed with small children to make things easier.  A larger person can dig a bunch of holes and the smaller ones can put the trees in.  Use an appropriate size shape and shovel for the stock.
<P>
Always water trees after planting, but do not pour water directly in the hole.  The soil will turn to mud and be hard to firm up, or be too hard packed when it dries.

PLANTATION MAINTENANCE
<P>
All tree planting groups should plan maintenance strategies for their plantations concurrently with plantation design.  From the first inspection of an abandoned farm field or grassy school yard, the scale of the restoration effort, the selection of the appropriate tree species, choice of planting stock (ie container or bareroot, seedling or sapling), and the allocation of financial resources is best made in recognition of the needs and costs associated with tending planted tree/seedlings.  Remember "community foresters" must think beyond planting day if they wish to successfully establish forests.
<P>
When a tree is planted, its root system must form new contacts with the soil before it can effectively absorb water and nutrients at rates necessary to support vigorous growth.  Hence, recently transplanted trees and shrubs are extremely susceptible to moisture stress during the establishment and significant mortality may occur during this time.  Grasses and thistles are also fierce competitors for soil water and nutrients and they effectively reduce tree growth and vigour.  Also, some regions of southern Ontario experience very short spring seasons and new plantations may face high summer temperatures and low levels of rainfall before their root systems have been able to exploit soil resources.  Tending operations must therefore begin immediately following the planting to have a maximum benefit.  Soil texture and drainage  also influence moisture and nutrient availability.  Therefore it is important to match pioneering species with these site variables.
<P>
10,000 Trees for the Rouge Valley has attempted to control competing grasses with wood chips supplied by local municipalities.  Mulch piles were strategically placed on the planting sites while the ground was frozen.  On planting day, volunteers were asked to mulch their trees.  Extremely large quantities of wood chip mulch were needed (1/2 wheelbarrow load per tree) and unfortunately, this extremely labour intensive approach only suppressed the growth of grasses and thistles for 2-3 months.  Wood chip mulch may be more effective on site with poorer soils where grass competition is much less vigourous.
<P>
In cooperation with the forestry consulting company, Neighborhood Environmental Studies, 10,000 Trees for the Rouge Valley began to experiment with plastic mulch mats 120 cm by 120 cm, home-made from construction grade vapour barrier and porous landscape fabric to control competing vegetation.  Early results of this technique are promising.  These barriers also worked extremely well to enhance the effectiveness of wood chip mulch.
<P>
The group has also tried to inter-crop white pine seedlings with white clover and crown vetch to alleviate grass competition.  For this technique, the sod layer must be tilled and mineral soil exposed in order to seed and germinate the cover crop.  In our experiment, insufficient germination of the inter-cropping species allowed grass to invade the sight and minimized the treatment effect.
<P>
Competing vegetation was also cut using gas powered weed-eaters in a portion of a floodplain meadow which was dominated by 2 metre reed canary grass.  Although this technique successfully reduced competition for sunlight among the planted white cedar, it did not reduce competition for water and nutrients.  It did, however, prevent the winter snow from matting the tall grass on top of the young cedar trees.
<P>
10,000 Trees for the Rouge Valley has also contracted to have high value hardwoods watered twice per week during the hoot and dry months of July and August, using their own portable 5 horsepower gas water pump.
<P>
Tree shelters such as TOBEX will be tested this year (1994).
<P>
Tree stems have been successfully protected from gnawing rodents by installing spiral tree guards at ground level.  Volunteer planters place these guards on the trees on planting day and maintenance personnel continue to install guards on missed trees the following week.
<P><P>

MONITORING
<P>
Neighborhood Environmental Studies has been contracted to conduct regeneration surveys of the planting to describe their stocking and estimate survival.  Permanent sample plots are being established to accurately assess the survival of selected species such as bur oak, black ash, and red maple.
<P>
Permanent sample plots have also been established to survey the floristic composition of these sites so that the successional impact of the tree planting on the vegetation composition of these meadows and riparian areas may be documented.
<P>
A summer bird census of each plantation has also been conducted to collect baseline data on the birds using these areas so that future populations may be contrasted with the current species.
<P>
A report summarizing the results of these monitoring studies will be available later this year (1994) from:
<P>
Marshall Buchanan<BR>

Neighborhood Environmental Studies, <BR>137 Fitzgerald Ave., <BR>Unionville, Ontario,<BR> L3R 1R5, <BR>(905) 477-3523
<P>
Although the act of tree planting and the publicity highlighting the big day is a major component of community based reforestation, it frequently receives more attention than is given to species selection and plantation tending.  Only through tending and monitoring will a community group learn the reasons for the success of failure of thousands of hours of planning and labour by volunteers.

</font size="+1">
<BR>
STAN KOZAK - WELLINGTON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION</center>

<P>
<P>







Welcome to this presentation involving school curriculum and tree planting.  I'm here with Sandy Moore, our habitat restoration coordinator, to briefly share with you some of our thoughts and experiences about students, their involvement in habitat restoration and how this relates to curriculum.
<P>
I am going to spend the first part of this presentation talking about what environmental education is in its broadest perspectives and how this relates to curriculum guidelines that educators use to guide our work.  Sandy will follow with an overview of some of the contextual activities we think are required when students get involved in habitat restoration.
<P>
As an aside let me say that it is a real pleasure to be here today, to cross paths with so many of you on your individual journeys - our journeys as educators, as environmentalists and ecologists and maybe most importantly our journeys as individuals in search of our true selves in relation to the world around us.  I think that if we cast the details aside, we would be surprised at the unity of the direction we travel in.
<P>
I'm excited and moved to realize that we are awakening to the call of an inspirational world, but also a wounded one.  I may have caught your attention right away when I introduced Sandy, our Habitat Restoration Coordinator.  The fact that we have this position gives some indication of how seriously we feel direct student involvement is.  What does a habitat restoration coordinator do?  Lots of vital things that need time and effort, such as keeping an active data-base of all our local groups and organizations involved in any kind of project that might be able to involve students;  communicate to the school system and all of the community groups and individuals through a regular newsletter;  help with the actual organization of projects with student involvement;  assist directly with classes doing practical field work and the biggest project--habitat restoration through tree planting.  This year about 125 classes will participate, that is over 4000 students and almost one in 5 of Wellington County's students.  I'm not giving you those numbers for the sake of bravado but to emphasize that we feel this activity is important to students' environmental curriculum.
<P>
I also am not telling you this to discourage those of you who as individuals are going the extra mile to make these things happen with your individual class or group.  I acknowledge your work and efforts.  On the other hand, if we are going to really start to explore how curriculum needs match the ecological restoration opportunities we have to be organized and there are many ways to start.
<P>
What is curriculum?  In the past most have considered it to be that range of studies offered in a school.  That no longer suffices.  To be vital and meaningful we have to reach out from beyond the school building, and reach into the depths of our individual selves.   [Take] one step out of the school yard where we can do many things including naturalization activities.  Take another step and we are in the community and I mean the community in the broadest sense, maybe it's ecological sense.
<P>
This is a good place to put tree planting and habitat restoration into context.  Should we not be spending as much of our energy and time trying to keep those remnant natural areas that still exist?  By valuing what is already in existence don't we bring more meaning to our restoration activities?
<P>
A group of local educators came up with a guiding definition of environmental education.  This is a difficult and long process for a number of reasons.  In the end, three main themes emerged and I'll paraphrase them.
<P>
The first and most important - environmental education should invite students and provide opportunities for them to form a deep personal relationship with non-human nature.
<P>
[Second,] students should understand how the world works, how we as humans are connected to it and the influence we have on the world.
<P>
[Third,] the curriculum should provide students with opportunities to participate directly in activities and projects such as habitat restoration.
<P>
The first theme or major objective - a personal relationship with non-human nature or the natural world as some would call it.  A relationship involves some level of familiarity.  We have to experience the natural world and most of our students do not.  In Guelph, a medium sized city, we have students who reach the end of elementary school who have never touched soil.  A relationship with the natural communities about us is vital if we are to develop a concern and be able to respond to that concern.  From there we can begin to identify with our bioregion and maybe even begin to live authentically within it.  Does having students involved in tree planting help meet this goal?
<P>
The second objective which follows from some of Van Matre's writing, is really the nuts and bolts of the science of ecology.  Let's acknowledge that we will never be able to fully understand how things work out there--they are just too complex.  But we should know about the major events and processes, how we're connected, things like where we get our water from.  Of the three major objectives I have mentioned, this one is most often thought of as environmental ed.  It is time to end the confusion here, environmental education and environmental science are not the same thing.  Environmental science is only a small part of environmental education.
<P>
Regardless of that consideration we can see that if we work at it, having students involved in habitat restoration can contribute to this objective as well.
<P>
The third major objective deals with student involvement in solving some of the mess we are in.  By it's nature it is positive, it is a response, it is action.  It brings environmental issues into students lives and makes the study of it all so much more meaningful.  A number of students have said, after their full day in the field tree planting, something to the effect that the day was the best school experience they had ever had.  I wonder how many more thought it and how many more felt it.  Getting your hands dirty, making a contribution, valuing your work, valuing your community, valuing each other, valuing our selves; these are essential to any successful environmental education program.
<P>
So curriculum moves from talking and listening and learning about issues, to doing, and being part of that doing.  And through this we prepare students for true citizenship.  I can't think of anything more basic than that.
<P>
If you are aware of the Common Curriculum, or haven't taken time to dig into it you may be surprised to learn that this document supports the definition of environmental curriculum as I have been describing it.  Last February the Ministry of Education and Training released the Common Curriculum.  It is the official policy guiding curriculum in grades 1 to 9 in Ontario schools.  It is a working document meaning that during this year it is under revision.  It superceedes all earlier policy for these grades.
<P>
Let me quote some of the learning outcomes found in the common curriculum as they relate to environmental education (pp 33, 36, 37).
<P>
When we pull all the environmental ed. from the common curriculum it results in a sizeable lot.  There are tools here for educators and members of the community to use, they are powerful and I invite you to use them.
<P>
As I mentioned, this is a working document.  Response is being sought for revision for the December 94 version.  If you're interested in responding I'd be happy to supply you with a copy of the report that details the environmental ed. content of the common curriculum.

ADVICE FROM EXPERIENCES IN WATERLOO REGION
</font size="+1">
<BR>
TED CHESKEY- WATERLOO COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION</center>

<P>
<P>






CONSIDERATIONS IN PLANNING HABITAT RESTORATIONS
<P>
Follow the model of natural areas - visit local natural areas and get a feeling of what they look and feel like.  Then visit a more traditional garden.  How are they different?
<P>
Use local native species!  By far the best source of plant materials are located in natural areas.  Plant material should be limited to seeds, and cuttings.  Mature growing plants should not be removed, unless from sites where their destruction is inevitable (road widening or housing development).
<P>
Plants can be propagated at school or home, a great part of the learning process.  Why have students grow beans?
<P>
Be patient in preparation of the seed beds.  Repeated cultivation of small sites over a growing season is effective in reducing numbers of exotic weeds.
<P>
Avoid over weeding.  Some acceptance of weeds in the early stages will avoid soil disturbance from weeding that favours the opportunistic weeds anyway.  If weeds are dense, cut off flower heads before seeds are set.
<P>
Plan for communities and not individual plants (e.g. meadow community) - allow the community to evolve "naturally", within your limits.
<P>
Develop a nursery for trees and shrubs:
<UL>
	<LI>needs protection from harmful influences (people, animals)
	<LI>use leaf or straw mulch in the winter.
	<LI>can be very small (a few square metres).
</UL>


Design the habitat to be interactive.  The more hands on the environment, the better.  Everyone, particularly the children need to forage in nature.  Allow opportunity for foraging, collecting and imaginative play.  Fenced-off, or do not pick habitats should not be all that you do.
<P>
Active gardening, including the cultivation of edibles should be a part of the project if possible.
<P>
Recognize the benefits to the informal curriculum as well as the formal curriculum.  Design area for informal (unsupervised), and formal (supervised) use.  Three design principles should be choice, comfort and safety.  The design of the site for informal use should be driven by the theme of choice to students.  Through choice, decisions are made.  Choices recognize that people have different needs.  Some people need to be away from the crowd for instance.  Offering choice through the physical environment likely contributes significantly to the reduction in violence that schools with interesting school yards experience over more traditional yards.  Comfort is rarely something that a school yard accords.  Yet healthy social interactions require comfortable settings.  Seating, shade and protection from the wind are fundamental.  Finally safety from environmental hazards such as ultraviolet radiation should be a priority.  Too many sets of climbing apparatus are in areas totally exposed to the sun.
<P>

SAFETY
<BR>

Projects should not be hidden in the back corner of the school, but rather they should be in prominent areas, visible from the street and neighbors.  In informal areas that offer students choice through structural variety, including hiding spots and private areas, all students should be safety conscious, familiar with the areas, and follow some basic rules such as buddy systems.  A safety plan for the area should be part of the official project plan.
<P>

Vandalism<BR>

Deal with vandalism swiftly.  Replace any damaged materials immediately, so that the act does not gain the attention that it seeks.  Involve as many people as possible in projects so that the need for antisocial expression is minimized.  Finally, in areas prone to acts of vandalism, develop a plan to deal with vandalism, and make this a part of the official project plan.
<P>

<center>SUMMARY OF HABITAT RESTORATION 
WATERLOO COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION</center>
<P>
It has been six years since the Wrigley Corners Outdoor Education Centre commenced the first habitat restoration within a WCBE school: their "ecogarden", a prairie and woodland restoration.  Three to four years ago, the first regular schools initiated habitat restoration projects.  Presently, about 15 to 20 percent of all elementary schools have initiated projects, while many more are in the early planning mode.  Projects have germinated through grassroots interest, making each project unique.  Teachers, parents, administrators and students have all initiated projects.
<P>
The WCBE has an official policy on Habitat Restoration that is permissive in its substance.  Schools may do as they wish to their yards, provided that they develop a plan (requiring approval), and take full responsibility of finances, management and maintenance, as well as any other consequences of the project.
<P>
Typically, schools commit the first year to building support among staff, parents, administrators and students.  Schools that rush into projects without a solid core of support, appear to struggle in subsequent years, after the big effort goes in to the design and construction.  Many of the projects underway have emphasized the aesthetic of formal use of the areas, and involve large numbers of students in the planning, and construction phases.  Typically, the site plan is made by someone in the school community (e.g. parent), with experience in drafting, landscape architecture, or graphic design.  Many schools have located projects in sites that are out of bounds during informal school time (e.g. recess).
<P>
Most schools with established areas are facing new challenges of maintaining interest, developing curriculum, and bringing new people into the project.  After the euphoria of the first years of establishment, comes the reality of the area, its maintenance, and use by teachers lacking confidence in working outside.
<P>
The next ten to twenty years will probably see the great majority, if not all elementary schools, and perhaps most senior elementary and high schools establish some sort of habitat restoration areas.  The main selling point is that these areas can contribute to a reduction of violence within the school yard, and not that they are "good for the environment"!  This argument is too compelling for schools to avoid, as will be the pressure to do something since everyone else has. 
 <P>

FINAL THOUGHTS
<BR>
In order to squarely face the issue of school yard violence, the informal use of the area must be paramount in its design.  This has not been the case so far.  Likewise, few, if any projects are used to their potential as a formal curriculum resource.  Finally, there is a need to document the impact of the projects on the student body, staff and community through surveys and interviews based on a pre-, and post-test model.

PLANTING & THE CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY(CANADA'93)

<P>
<P>






We should ask ourselves what we are planting for in relation to the environment, and are we really maximizing our efforts?  The planet is now experiencing a major biodiversity crisis.  Why not make biodiversity conservation a goal of the planting effort?  However, before proceeding we should be well aware of what we are doing.  For example, many programs now advocate planting for biodiversity under the assumption that more species diversity is necessarily better.  From an ecological point of view this may be a dangerous perspective.  Expert advice is a must.
<P>
One example of biodiversity loss is the decline of many migratory songbird populations.  Here on the breeding grounds the principle cause of the declines are thought to occur through the process of habitat fragmentation and associated "edge" effects such as increased predation and parasitism etc.  These problems may be mitigated by expansion of forest fragments, creation of corridors between habitat where appropriate, and reducing edge.  Plantings could have a major role to play in this process if undertaken carefully.  This kind of approach is possible with many willing partners such as local municipalities and landowners.  However it is time to start thinking about where we can put the energy and funding available for community plantings to greatest use.

Mark Crofts - Tree Plan Canada</center>

<P>
<P>



Through our work on the Tree Plan Canada Program, Huibers and I are fortunate to visit and have contact with a wide variety of tree planting projects across the province and - through our counterparts - with projects in other regions in the country.
<P>
In order to identify trends and future directions in community based tree planting it is important to look at the past. (We viewed a series of slide images of deforested areas across the province while volunteers read historical accounts of the original forest which covered much of southern Ontario.  For instance - Catherine Parr Trail (1850's) wrote: "the frowning woods somber pine, oak and maple give a grandeur to the scenery that is very impressive."
<P>
Other historical quotes documented the massive changes wrought on the land by these "pioneers" as they used "water, fire and steel" to clear the land for agriculture (we viewed slide images of erosion and flooding).
<P>
A new sort of pioneer - the conservation pioneer- using different tools such as shovels, seedlings and conservation ideals began to recognize the value of preserving trees and forested areas and even began to plant trees (slides of early tree planting efforts in Northumberland County, 1950's).
<P>
(Slides of contemporary community tree planting events)  The people present at this workshop are also pioneers.  We are restoration pioneers, and our tools are more sophisticated.  Our knowledge of issues and topics discussed today such as: biodiversity and naturalization; watersheds and ecosystems; native seed sources; and state of the art tree growing, planting and maintenance techniques are evidence of this.
<P>
Our approach to involving the community in planning, planting, advocating and maintenance aspects can further be enriched by learning more (slide of Journal of Arboriculture) and by adding an element of education (slide of Focus on Forests and Federation of Ontario Naturalists tree education kit) and celebration (music, games, poetry) to all of our community planting events.
<P>
This workshop has brought together representatives of over 80 groups; and there are many more across the province and across the country (slides of Tree Plan Canada supported project locations across the province).
<P>
This workshop is a celebration, a sharing of ideas and experiences which have rejuvenated us.  We will return home as pioneers, to encourage others to join us towards achieving our very ambitious goals of restoring our environment.
<P>
I would like to thank Kirk Biggar and all the staff at the Evergreen Foundation for all of their hard work and creative ideas towards making this workshop work so well.
<P>
Thank you for coming!

Opening Welcome: <BR>

Paul Daminato, New Westmister Parks Director</center>


<P>

It is my pleasure to welcome you all here today on behalf of the City of New Westminster. I hope that you will have some time today to enjoy our city, our parks and natural areas. Holding this function at Douglas College id particularly significant since we are only a few blocks away from one of the natural wonders of the world... the Fraser River.
<P>
In welcoming all of you to New Westminster, I must say that the timing of your workshop is most appropriate. New Westminster is one of the Lower Mainland communities targeted by the Greater Vancouver Regional District for significant higher density. It is estimated that the current population of the City 48,000 with growth predicted as high as 80,000 by 2021. As density increases there will be increased demand and competition for park land, open space, and natural areas.
<P>
The timing is also significant as the city is in the beginning steps of reviewing its Official Community Plan. "Envision New Westminster" is the name of a two year process that will involve extensive public participation in visioning and determining the future of the city. The first stage of this process is a series of public forums to identify major issues facing our community in the future. One of the forums is "Sustainability: Parks, Environment and energy planning". This is an opportunity to raise such issues as naturalization.
<P>
It is also a time of competing or conflicting values, standards, uses and concerns when it comes to public parks and open spaces. Our ever increasing cultural diversity further complicates this issue. Some individuals in the community se parks and open space simply as potential activity areas and want them 'developed' (e.g. tennis courts, athletic fields, lacrosse boxes, etc.) Others feel parks should be manicured with formal  gardens,  perfect lawns and clean edges. Many residents fear for their safety and demand that trees be limbed up and all ground vegetation removed to provide clear views through park spaces.
<P>
Finally, it is a time for resource reductions both in money and labour to maintain and improve our parks and open space areas. Community involvement from individuals such as yourselves and your neighbours will become increasingly important as we attempt to accomplish out goals through initiatives such as naturalization projects.
<P>
I commend you on your program today since it addresses many of the issues mentioned above and I wish you great success in your efforts to further naturalize our communities. Once again, welcome to New Westminster. Enjoy your day and enjoy our City!

SOME THOUGHTS ON THE NATURE OF NATURE AND SOCIETY:<BR>

We are in the middle of two major crises.  We are in an environmental crisis; we are also in an experiential crisis.  Earth is suffering under the onslaught of poorly considered human activity.  Humanity is also suffering;  more people live a vicarious existence, alone, and separate from both nature and their community.  We are detached from nature to such an extent that we lose touch with what the impacts of our demands are upon the environment.  We also lose touch with the meanings, joys, and discoveries that nature can offer us each and every day of our lives.  Ultimately, we can not solve the environmental crisis without solving the experiential crisis at the same time; any solution must resolve both crises.  To restore the earth requires that we care about the earth at the same time.
<P>
"It is the marriage of the soul with Nature that makes the intellect fruitful, and gives birth to the imagination."
<BR>
---THOREAU,from his Journal, July 12, 1840.
<P>
An important "way in" to resolving the crises is to begin by returning nature to her central role in the intellectual discussions of the times.  At several times in the past nature has been the dominant focus of all philosophical, scientific, artistic, and poetic thinking.  In the 1700s in Europe and in the middle to late 1800s in North America, nature was widely celebrated and discussed.  Nature was seen as a moral teacher, as a civilizing influence on society. Respectable, caring societies considered it essential that nature be everywhere in the city, not just in the countryside.  In his plan for Central Park in New York City in 1857, Frederick Law Olmstead asserted that the creation of a park landscape in the middle of the New York would, like the countryside and for those unable to get to the countryside, teach urban residents about how to be gentle, considerate, and refined. 
<P>
By the time the modern movement assumed dominance at the beginning of this century, however, nature was becoming incidental to the lives and thinking of most.  Wilderness was vanishing and in our attempts to save a semblance of our landscape, we established a series of national parks and wilderness reserves.  We put a boundary around such landscapes, in effect making them a garden; and we became the gardeners.  We now are no longer surrounded by nature; instead, we surround nature.  Our position in and with respect to the world has fundamentally and permanently been altered.
<P>
Yet we still live as though nature was the dominant force in our lives.  We continue to hold onto Arcadian images of the world in which the ideal place to live is in a gentle, beautiful pastoral landscape safe from the cruelties of both the "untamed wilderness" and the "corrupt city".  We seek this Arcadian landscape at every turn.  In its most insipid form, we blanket that very same landscape with our childish replication of Arcadia that we call the suburb.  And, with the same intentions, we continue to create "picturesque" parks.  Yet Arcadian images are valid if and only if there is a real wilderness.   Without wilderness the Arcadian vision, as with the suburbs, is a shallow and outdated dream.
<P>
At the same time nature has a new competitor - the vicarious experience of nature offered by the television and the emergence of "virtual reality" competes directly with the experiences of the outside, nature and wilderness (when real nature is rough and dirty, why not just sit back and watch images of nature in the comfort and safety of your own home?).   And the more time one spends in this vicarious existence the less and less one has time for, or is indeed interested in spending time in nature.  Nature is eventually forgotten, supplanted by the images of the real thing.
<P>
"...a society becomes modern when one of its chief activities is producing and consuming images, when images that have extraordinary powers to determine our demands upon reality and are themselves coveted substitutes for first-hand experience become indispensable to the health of the economy, the stability of the polity, and the pursuit of private happiness."
<BR>
 ---SUSAN SONTAG 1972, in The Aesthetics of Silence.

THE IMPORTANCE OF NATURE:<BR>

Nature in its real and full presence is, however, essential to the human condition, above and beyond our obvious environmental needs.  More and more, current research asserts that nature is crucial to the learning experiences of the young child.  It is in nature, that children develop a sense of themselves, learn to plan and think about the future, and become aware of issues of time, and life and death.   For others, nature is a restorative environment.  People who are sick, hurting in heart, or suffering from altzheimers and other debilitating diseases find comfort and rest in the garden.  Nature also challenges our thinking.  For the artist, writer or poet, designer, and scientists  nature is the place where the imagination continues to be fostered and challenged. And ultimately nature is the pragmatic "reality check".  Nature serves as the measuring stick against which we weigh our behaviours, attitudes, thoughts, and ideas.  Nature offers to human action the ultimate set of checks and balances. 
<P>
"Let children walk with Nature, let them see the beautiful blendings and communions of life and death, their joyous and inseparable unity...and they will learn that death is stingless indeed, and as beautiful as life, and that the grave has no victory for it never fights."
<BR>
---JOHN MUIR, 1916 in A Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf.

<P>
OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVING THE ROLE OF NATURE IN THE CITY:<BR>

There are an endless number of ways in which we can bring nature back into our cities and our daily lives.  In all these instances we are changing our prepositional relationship with nature; we are no longer living in or around nature, we must be livingwith  nature and nature must be living in  us.  At the same time we need to understand and make better use of the processes of nature. The processes of nature must be our dominant technological processes in society; in this respect we need to do many of the things we currently do, differently.  Consider the following possibilities:
<P>
1. DRAINING THE CITY:  We have taken the surface drainage of our city, as well as many of our smaller streams, and buried them.  The storm drains are expensive to build and maintain, and do not help to oxygenate and clean the various pollutants in the storm water.  By surfacing the drains and streams of our city, and resolving drainage problems on a site by site basis, we can use storm water more effectively while, at the same time, improving the quality of that water.  Remember the old cisterns, rain barrels, and ditches!
<P>
2. TREATING SEWAGE:  Solar aquatics, reed beds, and marshes can be used to effectively treat raw sewage as effectively and in a more environmentally friendly manner than most of our current sewage treatment systems.  The marshes can also serve as important wildlife habitat.
<P>
3. ENERGY EFFICIENCY:  Deciduous trees can be used to allow sunlight to penetrate a building in winter, providing passive solar energy, or shading a building in summer thereby reducing air-conditioning and other energy demands.
<P>
4. PROVIDING BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY:  The many different kinds of niches and corners in a city contain a wide variety of plant, insect, and animal life.  This diversity should be inventoried, monitored, and increased.   The urban landscapes of the Lower Mainland must be seen as containing a diverse and vibrant gene pool.
<P>
5. MAKING BETTER STREETS:  As we now, more than ever, begin to realize the need to calm, or reduce the impact of the traffic in our cities and communities, we are provided with a unique opportunity to re-examine what our local streets look like and do.  Lane widths can be reduced, curbs eliminated.  Our streets can become more like playgrounds and gardens than ever before.  Street rights-of-way occupy some 30% of the land area of our communities; they dominate the public realm of our communities.  When we realize that we can make our local streets function in a different manner, one that is more sympathetic to nature, we can then do much to redefine the character and quality of our communities.
<P>
6. DIVERSITY AND BACK LANES:  The old back lanes of our cities are rough, pleasantly untidy.  They contain a wide variety of places for plants to grow and a diversity of environments.  Policies that maintain such places, rather than "upgrading' the lanes by paving them over, are important.
<P>
7. MAKING BETTER SCHOOLS AND PARKS:  Many of our school grounds are little more than barren wastelands.  Yet it is clearly hypocritical to teach about nature and environment in the classroom and then send our children out into such landscapes at recess or the end of the day to "play".  Such school yards may be "safe" in the legal sense, but they are not morally or intellectual safe.  At the same time many neighbourhood parks have tended towards being neat and tidy and for many, particularly the child, offer few places to explore, play hide and seek in, or simply and delightfully "get muddy".
<P>
8. DEVELOPING A DIFFERENT AESTHETIC:  With the advent of the lawnmower, we have become overly focused on the "trimmed", or the neat and tidy in our view of what makes an attractive landscape.  We are given the power to, and seem to like to see nature controlled.  But nature can present to us a much wider range of aesthetic possibilities. We can learn to "read" the beauties in other landscapes - in a bramble, a weed patch, an allotment garden, or a tangled garden.  And when we consider a greater diversity of possible landscapes, the front as well as the back yards of our cities will assume a wonderful diversity of landscapes we have not considered to date.
<P>
9. CREATING GREAT PLACES:  At the same time we have not used nature to create great places in our communities and cities.  We have no great city orchard, no magnificent grove or grand allee, no field of clover for a moonlit night, and no wild and wonderful topiary gardens to tease our senses.  We have no great laburnum arch or bramble arcade, no urban vineyard or gigantic pumpkin patch, and no magical tidal garden to reveal to us the beauties of an ever-changing sea and shore.   Such great places can not only challenge our own imaginations, they can encourage us to create a place of such dimensions as the world has never seen before.  When we do, the tourists will come to see the Vancouver region in numbers greater than ever before.
<P>
10. LETTING NATURE STRUCTURE THE REGION:  Nature, as a series of processes, recognizes no boundaries.  She moves, absorbs, cleans, and recycles.  When the region and its cities can be structured to reflect the structure and processes of nature we will create both a productive and beautiful order to our place.  Systems of open spaces, greenways, streams and marshes, woods, aquifer recharge zones, wildlife corridors and reserves, and numerous gardens will give a natural order to our region that satisfies our spiritual as well as other needs.
<P>
 Nature can also enter the fabric and spirit of our cities and region in many other ways: in our celebrations, ranging from special thanksgiving ceremonies to a grand celebration of the summer solstice; in the ways we use nature to work for us in stream and bank erosion control;  in the provision of urban agriculture and urban farms; or in the development of a variety of urban commons, or lands that people can use for a variety of other land related needs.  In virtually every aspect of our existence there is a role for nature.
<P>

IDENTIFYING WAYS FOR GIVING NATURE A MORE SIGNIFICANT ROLE:<BR>

Bringing nature back into the city and region has never been and will never be an easy task. As with any worthwhile human endeavour, it requires constant attention and effort.  There are, however, a variety of programs, changes, and possible actions taking place in the region that would suggest that these are particularly good times for making a number of important changes, for wining several victories for nature.  They include:
<P>
1. THE GVRD LIVABLE REGION PLAN:  In addition to setting aside a large green zone, this plan describes which communities will be responsible for assuming various levels of growth in the region.  This more planned approach to the region can only improve our ability to plan for improved public transit, better community development, and the manner in which we handle the issues of automobile pollution, sewage treatment, etc. There is, of course, much work yet to be done at the regional level.  The distribution of the green zone areas in the region needs to be supported by a more structured and imaginative series of greenways and wildlife corridors throughout the region.  The end of the single-family residential development is also needed (despite the likely protests to the contrary) if we are to reduce our tendency to continue to cover the region with the ubiquitous subdivision.
<P>
2. VANCOUVER: CITY PLAN:  The final draft of the two-year, city-wide, public planning process in Vancouver has just been completed.  It is an exciting document.  It calls for strengthening the role of our local communities, creating urban villages, and developing a set of public realm places around which community functions can occur, and it suggests that there is a strong desire in the public at large to see the basic quality of our environment improved.  The vision is a gentle vision.  And it is a vision in which nature has a place.  The City Plan process is also one which other communities in the region could well emulate.
<P>
3. GREENWAYS: PUBLIC WAYS:  In response to Vancouver's significant, highly innovative and far reaching Urban Landscape Task Force report in 1992, the City of Vancouver is now examining a greenway system for the city in greater detail.  The system consists of a city-wide system and a neighbourhood system.  The city-wide system allows people to move on foot or bicycle throughout the city, gives the overall city a greater sense of order, and gives people better access to the waterfront and major parks and other facilities of the city.  The neighbourhood greenways allow residents of various communities to come together to improve the streets and other components of the public realm in their neighbourhood assuring safer access for children to school, and a greater diversity of landscapes and natural places in each neighbourhood.  The Greenways program is another excellent model for other cities and municipalities in the region to emulate.
<P>
4. OTHER PROGRAMS:  There are a number of other excellent programs available to assist communities in improving their communities.  The Neighbourhood Initiatives Program of the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation is a notable example, providing matching funds for up to $5000.00 for communities interested in upgrading some aspect of their public realm.  At another level, the City of Vancouver's Engineering Department recently announced their rain barrel program, in an attempt to encourage people to use collected rain water for their gardens, particularly during the summer season when there is little rain and heavy demands for watering.   These programs sow the seeds for many other forms of community and environmentally friendly programs.  And no doubt there are many other programs operating in the region and many other new possibilities that we can encourage our local governments to consider.
<P>
In addition to the initiatives mentioned above there are other activities and possibilities that we need to consider.  School and park boards appear to be talking more and more about assisting one another in their public realm policies and programs.  The need for traffic calming in virtually every neighbourhood allows us to reconsider the street.   The densification of single-family residential areas gives us new opportunities for improving the public realm and the natural diversity of the subdivision.   And the beauty and diversity of the Lower Mainland landscape should encourage us to look at new ways for creating an even more beautiful environment that attracts tourists from around the world; we can and must prove that nature in community "pays"!  
<P>
A BRIEF CONCLUSION:<BR>

In all of these various activities that attempt to return nature to the city, to reconnect people and nature there are four things that I believe are essential to the task.
<P>
1. Maintain Vigilance:  First, we must be constantly critical of and do battle with those activities that in some way destroy or lessen the effectiveness of nature in the city.  This includes calling the public's attention to the hypocrisy of the lack of nature in the environment of Vancouver's Science World, or the insistence in Port Coquitlam that another Mary Hill development will never happen again!
<P>
2. Develop Long-Term Visions: Secondly, our visions for nature in the city must be long term visions.  While we can and must win many short term victories there is a real need to remember that the "naturalization" of our communities and suburbs, and the reclaiming of many of our highly disturbed lands will take many, many years to realize. In this respect we must be constant yet patient in our efforts.
<P>
3. Encourage Experimentation: Thirdly, we must insist that our various city, municipal, regional and provincial governments experiment in improving the condition of nature and environment in the city.  This is essential if we are to move forward in the realization of sustainable environments. The experimentation is needed in virtually every aspect of nature and city from storm drainage and sewage treatment to landscape reclamation, water conservation, and food production.
<P>
4. Create a Rich, "Thick" Environment:  Finally, in everything we do we must remember that nature is "thick"; she consists of layers upon layers of life cycles and interactions. In this respect, we should not think that when we re-create "thin" definitions of nature (i.e. planting trees at the Cassiar Connector) that we are in fact naturalizing such a place. In a similar vein we should also understand that the thickness of nature should serve as an inspiration for us to make our own human places thick.  This implies that our communities must be complete places, comprehensive places, places where we can grow food, produce goods, live, rest, and play all within walking distance of each activity. Then, and only then will we truly have real communities again, communities which can be in touch with and embrace nature within their borders.
<P>
As so many recent environmentalists have stated we have not inherited the earth from our forefathers, we are in fact borrowing it from our children.  In short, if our efforts at creating cities and communities don't work for children at the outset, they simply don't work!  Ultimately what we do in bringing nature back into the lives of communities is not for ourselves, but for the children that follow.

<font size="+1">Naturalization: An Introductory Definition</font size="+1">
<BR>

Mark Tilbe, Durante Kreuk Limited</center><P>

 



After completing some research, and thinking about my personal experiences, I have come up with what I feel is a definition for naturalization and how it takes place. 
<P>

Naturalization is the process of allowing nature to take its own course in the landscape around us. This is a very broad definition and the process can take several forms and can have different levels of human involvement. 
<P>
Where does it take place? Naturalization implies a transition from an unnatural to a more natural state through natural processes. Therefore, naturalization does not take place in a natural untouched environment. 
<P>
Humans are an integral part of the process because of our manipulation of the landscape. As humans we manipulate the landscape and maintain it in an unnatural state in order to produce crops, provide housing, work and recreation places, transportation corridors etc. We hold the natural processes at bay through extraordinary maintenance procedures to produce the landscapes we desire. Many of these procedures used by us are very financially and environmentally expensive. The process is taking place all around us in the landscapes we have created. We are in a constant battle with the natural processes which are trying to reclaim the landscapes we are trying to control. Naturalization takes place in these areas, in the landscapes that humans have altered. 
<P>
Naturalization takes place in at least two ways: 1) Naturalization takes place in the landscapes created and neglected by humans:  old abandonned industrial sites, edges between different land uses, cemeteries, etc. The natural process of plants recolonizing these areas takes place without human intervention. 2) Humans can try to engineer the process of naturalization to speed it up, or have some control over its outcome. The process of naturalization goes through many stages from the first colonizing plants to an eventual climax plant community which will dominate the specific site. Through experience and environmental knowledge we can speed up the process by planting the climax species and letting the process take over from there. The actual outcome is never certain because there are so many influences on the process.  
<P>
It is a misconception that naturalization is the planting and maintaining of only native plant communities such as some of the work going on in Stanley Park. Although, native plants are the only appropriate material for naturalizing adjacent to undisturbed natural landscapes, there should be no limitations in the urban setting.  Urban naturalized landscapes will never become completely natural and we should not pretend that they are.

<font size="+1">Surrey Park Department's Perspective on Naturalization:</font size="+1">
<BR>

Greg Ward, Surrey Parks And Recreation</center>
<P>

-'Wild Thing'- Naturalization is a feeling for all that is wild and free in our spirit and in our world. Through a variety of mediums, whether song, poetry, or photography, the philosophy of naturalization with all its' inherent beauty can be related to people and communities. As passion and devotion are an integral part of our lives in things we hold dear, to foster this in communities within the context of naturalization must be a starting point for all of us. 
<P>
The "new" City of Surrey has experienced unprecedented growth in the last 15 years, accounting for 60-70% of all new housing starts in the Lower Mainland. A population that has leaped from approx. 105,000 in 1975 to approx. 290,000 today. New single family dwellings have been in the order of 4,000 new units per year in many years. Of course with this growth has been a considerable impact on the natural environment, either in outright loss to subdivisions, or degradation of streams and wild areas due to associated development. The Parks and Recreation Department of the City is mandated to offset development impact with the provision of park land and programs. 
<P>
THEMES: <BR>

Perceptions - integrating naturalization into the park space requires educating the public and professional park practitioners and planners. The gardening community with their penchant for control of the natural environment has been the pervading conceptual approach. In order to address this conceptual approach the very idea of what is beautiful must be addressed- ie is the long grass meadow filled with beauty and virtue as the well kept, manicured lawn is perceived to be. Yes!!!!
<P>
Planning - integrating naturalized areas into our open spaces, developed parks etc. at the planning stage is critical to success.  Often the natural amenities of the land, be it large trees or rolling meadow stocked with wildflowers, are detrimentally affected by development to the point where they are lost (root damage to trees). Once the cultured design criteria is set into place going back to a naturalized theme, even in small sections throughout the site, is unsuccessful.
<P>
People - Involvement, stewardship challenges, education, responsibility; are key concepts involving the community. If the people in the community do not buy into the naturalization concept success will not be with us. 
<P>
Through our various Park programs we are addressing the concepts of stewardship, involvement, and responsibility:
<UL>
	<LI>VIP - parks of various sizes and nature are being built and maintained by neighbors with neighbors;
	<LI>Releaf Days - trees of many types and sizes are being planted by the thousands throughout the community, in Parks, detention ponds, road boulevards etc. in concert with the community and Parks' staff;
	<LI>Partnerships - with the Evergreen Foundation, Douglas College Institute of Urban Ecology, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, local rate payers and community groups, elementary schools, Brownie and Scouting groups the Parks Division of Surrey is enhancing natural areas through planting, riparian rehabilitation, fish release in streams and creeks, and general debris removal from parks and open space.

<font size="+1">NATURAL AND  SAFE -- The options for safety in natural areas<BR></font size="+1">

James B. Jarvis, Landscape Architect</center>
<P>



BACKGROUND: CPTED PRINCIPLES <P>

Safety & Security<BR>

Recently I became interested in personal and public safety and I am now convinced that safe site geometry is good design -- schools, hospitals, social housing, market housing, commercial, and downtown core projects.  I found that the principles of community policing  were similar to those concepts I learned when I was working for my masters degree in Sociology (before the BLA). I have found that most of those concerned with what is now described as Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design have either been police or municipal planners.  What seemed to be missing in the equation were the people who actually do the project design.
<P>
JAMES JARVIS & ASSOCIATES LTD. is associating with DON JETTE, a 23 year veteran with the RCMP.  This is the first time a landscape architect and police officer have joined forces to provide site design services with a focus on public and personal safety.  
<P>
The following principles guide our work:
<OL>
	<LI>INCREASE SOCIAL INTERACTION.
	<LI>INCREASE SURVEILLANCE AND PERCEPTION OF DETECTION.
	<LI>REDUCE THE FEAR OF CRIME
	<LI>CREATE AN "URBAN VILLAGE".
	<LI>CREATE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND A FEELING OF TERRITORIALITY.
</OL>


We support the concept of natural areas wherever and whenever possible. We concur with the value of natural areas in urban settings -- Water filtration, noise abatement, wild life, educational benefits, natural ambiance, wildness, and the ability to escape the city. Natural ravines, isolated areas, places that are first and foremost wild areas, are important and should have priority in our policy making.


<P>
Natural areas are not necessarily any more dangerous than other landscapes -- parks, commercial or residential areas.  It depends on many factors.
<P>
Architecture & CPTED principles
<UL>
<LI>Details: 
		<UL>
		<LI>Preventing concealment
		<LI>Fencing
		<LI>Locating children's play
		<LI>Lighting
		<LI>Surveillance (site lines)
		</UL>
<LI>Education: Where to walk; When to walk; Walk with a companion; Keep  contact w/ children;
<LI>Planning & CPTED Use conflicts:  ATM & natural area; Natural area between a school  convenience store
<LI>Policing:  Parks personnel;  Block  watch;  Community policing & Police patrols
</UL>

Here we are going to  concentrate on the architectural/design component of making natural areas more safe.


<P>
PROBLEMS WITH NATURAL AREAS:<BR>

Poorly understood amenity.  To many people, a natural area appears to be junk  land, messy, unusable, and many times they stink -- a bog or marsh for instance.


<P>
The public is abusive to these areas. They are always dumping in the forest and in the bush. In natural areas in cities you see litter (tires, bottles, pop cans, to drug paraphernalia), refuse (chairs, clothing, junk) , toxic liquids (oil, gas, paint, etc.), vandalism, and encroachment (beating down vegetation, making paths, breaking furniture, walking through vegetation or marsh).
<P>
Maintenance is tricky and difficult. Just how do you clean some of this stuff up?  Its not like mowing a lawn or pruning a tree.
<P>
The more natural and uncontrolled, the more many people will fear these areas as an amenity.  Nature is not everyone's cup of tea.  The tendency and history has certainly been to slash and burn. Not all of it has been driven by just economics.  
<P>
In England early efforts to control highwaymen -- clear  the  forest back 50' from the roadway. Fine the landowner who did not and had a robbery on his property.
<P>
We have our work cut our for us to get these valued assets in place  -- the last thing we need are natural areas that are unsafe!
<P>
CONCLUSION:  Any real or perceived problems with safety will severely restrict public support for these natural features.
 
<P>
WHAT CRIMES ARE WE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT?
<P>
CRIMES AGAINST THE PERSON.
<BR>

Please remember,  that these crimes are not common place, but  they do occur and today, people are very concerned about them. Such crimes include:
<UL>
	<LI>Abduction - Child/adult
	<LI>Robbery/mugging
	<LI>Assault
	<LI>Rape
	<LI>Murder
	<LI>Exhibitionists
</UL>
<P>

HOW TO APPROACH SAFE DESIGN FOR NATURAL AREAS:
<P>
To determine proper design of a particular site it is very beneficial to know the crime rates in the area and what kinds of crimes are prevalent. Is the crime rate high? Is it Low? The design for one threat may not work for another. Some examples include:
	<UL>
	<LI>Crimes against property;
	<LI>Theft from auto and vandalism for instance;
	<LI>Crimes against the person;
	<LI>Assault.
	</UL>
<P>
To properly design and/or site a project, one must understand the demographics of the areas. Who uses the area and who will likely use the park?  Students? Families? Teens? Children? Vagrants? Transients?  Drug users? Old? Young?  Potential problem groups.  Each area is  different. Some examples include:  
	<UL>
	<LI>Crab Park
	<LI>Stanley Park
	<LI>Mt. Seymour Water Shed
	</UL>
	<P>
Fear among the public exists and use patterns are affected by fear of assault? This is a problem that must be addressed through design. Some use and design considerations include:
<UL>
	<LI>Knowing the site: Where are the exits and entrances; Circulation patterns and conflicts; Dead ends and entrapment; Blind spots?
	<LI>What is the shape of the land: Ravines, slopes, tree cover, high shrubs, etc.  
	<LI>What urban features border the site: Parking lot, Convenience store, Pub, School, Transit stop, Residences (institutional, private), Transition houses, Group homes? 
</UL>

	<P>
EXAMPLES OF SOME NATURAL AREAS WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH:
	<P>
WRECK BEACH:<BR>

There is a main pathway which runs down the bluffs through a natural band of forest and bush leading down to Wreck Beach. These natural bluffs are a transition zone between the urban campus and the 'clothing optional' beach.
	<P>
This pathway is shared primarily by the students, the homeless, exhibitionists, and vendors (of alcohol and drugs). From this high use path between two distinct zones we get considerable conflicts such as sexual and physical assaults, drug and alcohol trade and exhibitionism.
	<P>
The safety of both the beach and the residences are effected by this conflict.  The women at the beach, children, and the women residences -- now they do not allow women to live on the ground floor.  
	<P>
Problems associated with placing university residences next to a natural area -- the natural bluff between two such disparate uses.
	<P>
LIGHTHOUSE PARK:<BR>

Lighthouse Park is a natural area within an upper middle class residential area at English Bay and Howe Sound - Point Atkinson. The primary users of the park are families, young people, and seniors.
	<P>
There are no user conflicts here and no crime beyond theft from automobiles. Why is this auto theft happening? The parking lot of this park is a natural  target because it is isolated from the neighborhood and the shrubs and bushes come right up to the parking lot edge. This creates an easy place to hide and watch for women placing their purses under the front seats. 
	<P>
CRAB PARK -- A VANCOUVER WATERFRONT PARK:<BR>

Who uses this park? Originally it was designed for the residents of the downtown/east side area. The real users are the homeless, vagrants, mentally ill, people with substance abuse, some prostitutes, office personnel, and some neighborhood families, children and seniors.  Generally, Crab Park is poorly used when compared to other parks.
	<P>
It is located near Water street and East Hastings St. These areas have the highest crime rates in Western Canada (assault, murder, public intoxication, drug use, drug sales, incivility, prostitution).  There is an extremely high population of single men in these areas.
	<P>
What are the conflicts?  Potentially a great deal between drunks and families, prostitutes and mentally ill.  On  the other hand, it is well patrolled by Ports Canada Police, parking is not isolated, and there is good surveillance. Additionally, the park is used at different times by different people. Potential conflicts are there if one is not smart about when they use the park.  
	<P>
The neighbourhood does not use the park at night.  Vagrants use the park very little because they are very territorial in their habits. There are some prostitutes and some drug addicts at night.
	<P>
There is a natural area on the edge of this park which is generally avoided by women and families. There are a few problems associated with this natural area but nothing that cannot be rectified. People have penetrated the edges of it, littering it with needles, bottles, and debris. There is no buffer zone between pedestrians and the bush providing good concealment for unwanted activities.
	<P>

SOME  OF THE TOOLS WE USE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES:<BR>

<UL>
	<LI>Lighting and signage:
	<LI>Site Lines, surveillance - natural and formal (police):
	<LI>Entrapment Spots:
	<LI>Location of activity  generators:
	<LI>Planning for a range of activities:
	<LI>Encouraging night time use or not:
	<LI>Avoid predictability of movement:
</UL>

SUMMARY:<BR>

Natural areas are not intrinsically dangerous. Yet, crime and fear will certainly bring pressure on any natural area which is poorly designed for its local. We must place and design natural areas to prevent these issues from becoming problems.

Sarah White, Britannia Neighbours In Action</center>
<P>

I would like to explain my involvement in this process as a  neighbour, a designer and someone who believes strongly in community involvement. I have a degree in landscape architecture and part of my role in the group has been to help facilitate involvement through the "Green Napier" project which was a pilot project of Design Week '94. Their intent was to bring together residents, business people and designers from a particular neighbourhood and get them to work on a design project. Currently, our group is working on two projects, "Green Napier" and "Charles and MacLean Park". Later, I will give a synopsis  of thge how we went through the design process for these projects.
<P>
The vision of Britannia Neighbours is to create more green space through a process of community involvement, in the most park-deficient neighbourhood in Vancouver. By being committed to this process, we are not only building parks, we are also building community. It seems that a park is an appropriate vehicle (or bicycle!) for community building in these times. Working together on anything tends to break down our isolation from each other - working together to build a park provides an opportunity to deal also with our alienation from nature and our responsibility to the environment. The cliché 'think globally and act locally' is very relevant to this process. It is crucial to work at both levels and in this age of increasing disconnection we need to find ways to learn respect for each other and respect for the earth. Offering people an opportunity to have real input in shaping their community we have found to be very educational and empowering.
<P>
We are attempting to change the way in which a public space is created and also to change our relationships to those spaces. Firstly, the ideas for these parks have come directly from the community and the community has seen those ideas take initial form in the concept drawings. Already, people feel a connection to there parks, and a sense of ownership which many do not feel for other public spaces in the area, These parks should not look or feel like any other parks in the city, they should truly reflect the particular character of this neighbourhood. Our job is to bring form to community spirit.
<P>
THE DESIGN PROCESS<P>

"Green Napier"<BR>

As I mentioned, the first project that this group worked on was "Green Napier",  a proposal to transform the half block of Napier Street West of Commercial Drive into a pedestrian friendly community green space. Design Week '94 brought together designers and residents from the neighbourhood to work on  a design project with the theme of sustainability.
<P>
Our first task was to explore ideas for possible projects, which allowed the opportunity to introduce different ways of defining 'park'. We looked at alleys, streets, corners, connections and linkages as well as improving existing parks. The group decided on Napier Street because it had the potential to be a community wide space as well as create a more significant entry to Britannia Community Centre.
<P>
The next step was to hold the first public meeting where we had short presentations on sustainability and greenways and then we got to work. We explained that our goal for the evening was to come up with a program statement. By that we meant that people should not only talk about functional ideas but also how they wanted this place to look and feel. We broke into small groups and brainstormed and then each group presented their ideas which were recorded. We went back into groups again and tried to make the list smaller and also hash out some of the more controversial ideas. The end result of the first meeting was that the designers were instructed to generate five concepts to be reviewed at the next meeting.
<P>
The designers presented five concepts and we worked out how we would take the ideas from those and work them into one concept. There was another meeting where more feedback was given on the final concept which the designers took back again and produced what was presented at Design Week. During Design Week, we closed Napier Street and had the drawings and information on display. We had a parade with the help of Public Dream Society and ended with a tree planting ceremony. We had a lot of fun and a lot of interest and positive feedback from people passing by.
<P>
This project is still in the works but because it involves partial street closure, it is a lengthy process. We have had support and encouragement from the City of Vancouver and continue to talk to them about this project.
<P>
'Charles and MacLean'<BR>

During the course of the Napier project we learned that the Park Board had funds available for land acquisition so members of our group approach them about purchasing a piece of land at the corner of Charles Street and MacLean Drive. To our surprise they did in fact purchase the land - but they did not have funds to develop it. Our group approached them and asked to be involved in the design process based on our success with the Napier project. Again to our surprise they said yes, and we have taken on the responsibility for both the design and the fundraising for this park.
<P>
The design process was similar to that of Napier though our outreach was different as Charles and MacLean is a neighbourhood park rather than a community wide park. We leafleted neighbours and businesses and provided translations on the leaflets. We held public meetings at Britannia as well as Saturday 'Tent Days' at the park to try and reach as many people as possible. We again produced concept drawings which were approved by the Park Board. Since that time we have been focused on fundraising and trying not to be overwhelmed by the work ahead.
<P>
COMMUNICATION<BR>

We have found that the best way to find out what the community wants is to listen. Providing a forum where people express their ideas and then see those ideas take form created excitement and also commitment. Our group has built a level of trust which allows us to work well together. It has helped to have designers in the group who are not representatives of any institution because the built-in 'flack factor'  is removed - i.e. the historical mistrust of public officials and the belief that one's ideas will not be heard. If the designers are neighbours as well, then their investment and interest is similar to everyone else's. As we continue, we will need to do more outreach to truly reflect the diversity of this community. We hope to accomplish this in part through the Mosaic Creek Public Art Project, a component of the Charles and MacLean park.
<P>
In terms of communicating with government, we have not come up against significant road blocks yet. This has to do in part, with the political climate in which we are working. Initiative such as Greenways, and the Urban Landscape Task Force have in a sense laid the groundwork for groups like ours to be well received and encouraged. There is generally much more support for grassroots projects like ours and many more are springing up as we speak. It seems that there is far more understanding of the importance of decision making and involvement at the community level. 
<P>
It is very exciting and empowering to be involved in this project, but we have to be careful and clear about the meaning of partnership. Volunteers cannot be expected to plan, design and fundraise for a park without some kind of administrative help. It is an enormous amount of work, and a democratic process can make the process even longer! It is important for groups to have control but realistically they need support. We are managing to successfully deal with these issues as we go along and are very committed to seeing these projects through. We want to demonstrate that if people are involved in planning, designing and building pubic spaces they will have a sense of ownership and pride in these spaces and therefore will both enjoy and watch over them in that spirit.

ACTIVE LIVING - GO FOR GREEN!</center>
<P>



Active Living - Go For Green!  is a national "community based" initiative that encourages Canadians to be physically active in the outdoors while protecting and enhancing the environment.  The program was initiated at the federal level in 1991 by Fitness Canada to coordinate the following two principles:
<UL>
	<LI>To support and encourage Canadians to engage in more responsible, more active and healthier outdoor physical activities that are environmentally friendly;
<LI>To enhance their collective capacity to preserve or create quality environments for active living.
</UL>
<P>

Over the past two years, there have been a number of policy initiatives at the federal, provincial and territorial levels to coordinate the concepts of active living and environmental citizenship.  Some of these initiatives include:
<UL>
	<LI>working with transportation organizations and agencies to promote cycling/walking as legitimate alternative "active forms of transportation";
<LI>liaison with Health Canada to develop strategies to reduce pesticides/herbicides in home gardening and public parks;
<LI>promoting and supporting Canadian Rails to Greenways Network to acquire abandoned rail lines for public recreational use.
</UL>
<P>
In conjunction with the policy component of the program, an Active Living - Go For Green! grant program was established to financially assist non-profit organizations to promote active living and environmental citizenship in their local communities. 
  <P>
The Active Living - Go For Green!  program is administered in the province of British Columbia by the Outdoor Recreation Council and the Ministry of Housing, Recreation and Consumer Services. Community projects that address at least two of the four Active Living - Go For Green! objectives (building partnerships, developing safe and accessible environments, enhancing participation/education, and promoting active transportation) and meet the program's other funding guidelines can receive financial assistance for up to a third of the project to a maximum of $5,000.  To date, the grant program has supported a number of projects across the province ranging from the trail restoration projects, seniors' walking programs, urban organic demonstration gardens, cycling map, and to conferences such as the GroundWorks '95 Workshop.
<P>
For more information about the Active Living - Go For Green!  program or to obtain a copy of the grant application form (the next deadline for the Active Living grant program will be May 15, 1995), please contact Dawn Kelly at the Outdoor Recreation Council office at 737-3058.    
<P>

THE ELAINE BURKE AWARD<BR>

Do you know of a completed project that demonstrates the qualities outlined in the program's guidelines?  If so, Active Living - Go For Green!  would not only like to hear about these success stories, but would also like to recognize these achievements through the Elaine Burke Award!  The award is named in honour of Elaine Burke, who spearheaded the Active Living and the Environment Program initiative three years ago. The award was established to recognize communities or organizations that have demonstrated outstanding leadership in active living and environmental citizenship.

ACTIVE LIVING - GO FOR GREEN! NATURALIZATION SURVEY
<BR>

The national Active Living - Go For Green! staff are studying the current status of pesticide use, environmental turf management, and naturalization in policy and practices across the country.  In doing so, they are preparing a survey to document this information.  If you are interested in taking part in this study, please see me after the presentation and I will be sure to pass your name onto the study coordinator. 
<P>
In closing, on behalf of the Active Living - Go For Green! program and the Outdoor Recreation Council, I look forward to speaking with many of you about both the projects you have been undertaking and those that you are planning for your communities. Good luck and we look forward to receiving your innovative project proposals and nominations for the Elaine Burke award.  Enjoy the rest of your day.

Randy Butcher, Tree Plan Canada<BR></center>
<P>

Tree Plan Canada is a national program delivered through the National Community Tree Foundation.   The objectives of Tree Plan Canada are to:
	<UL>
	<LI>Offset CO2 emissions;
	<LI>Increase the environmental benefits (eg.natural climate, pollution and erosion control, and habitat diversity)
	<LI>Promote education and awareness of the importance of trees;
	<LI>Provide national leadership;
	<LI>Support enhancement and beautification of our communities.
	</UL>
<P>
EDITOR'S NOTE:<BR>
Until the summer of 1995, this program was delivered regionally through the Canadian Forest Service, and provided ane xcellent source of funding for trees for community-based projects. However, the NCTF has changed its organization structure and programs in response to funding cuts. While they still may be able to help with projects, it may be more technical or other support.
<P>

Canada Trust - Friends Of The Environment Foundation</center>
<P>

In 1990, Canada Trust established the Friends Of The Environment Foundation. The foundation, which has over 115 chapters across Canada, funds local environmental projects which range from recycling and composting programs to wildlife preservation and tree planting. The foundation's approach is straight forward, local initiatives under local direction.
<P>
Each local chapter is governed by a volunteer advisory board made up of Canada Trust employees and customers from the community. The board reviews and approves project funding requests according to the guidelines that have been established. Board meetings are held a number of times throughout the year.
<P>
Funds are raised through customer donations and matched donations by Canada Trust.
<P>
To apply for funding, an application must be received by the branch in the community where the project is based. (Chapters are located wherever there is a branch of Canada Trust) Funding applications and informational brochures are located at all Canada Trust branches.
<P>
If someone is a Canada Trust customer who has "greened" their account, they also have an opportunity to become a chapter board member and can inquire at the Canada Trust in their community.
<P>
If the information or forms are not available at the branch, contact Canada Trust B.C. Region office or Andria Teather @ 1055 Dunsmuir - Main Branch.

<P><font size="+1">Creating a Natural Space</font size="+1">
<BR>
Ron Myers, The District of North Vancouver</center>


<P>
Perceptions of man made natural spaces have changed over time. We have evolved from a 'man over nature' attitude in the 17th century to an 'awe of natural beauty' in the early 19th century and back to an exploitive attitude towards nature in the Late 19th century and 20th century. With the millennium approaching, attitudes are once again shifting and we are looking to restore natural areas disturbed by our activities. This presentation will attempt to give you an indication on some of the technical details of how to get the job done.
<P>
LOCATING THE PEOPLE<BR>
Volunteer groups can be located in many places. Generally all you have to do is provide the organization and the incentive and the interested parties will show up. Various levels of schools can be approached and often the planting can be incorporated into part of their curriculum. The elementary level can handle the smaller and simpler sites and the older high school students can tackle the tougher jobs.
<P>
Corporations often have organized groups of employees interested in environmental issues. These groups are usually more than willing to participate if some organization is provided. Other sources of participants include community service groups; neighborhood organizations; Scouts and Guides.
<P>
SITE SELECTION<BR>
Sites can be found anywhere that there is some sort of disturbance. Windfall areas adjacent to newly opened areas are common and new housing developments are a good examples. Greenbelts adjacent to these site often have to be removed for safety reasons. 
<P>
The site can be prepared for planting to insure a high rate of success or the sites can be left as found but planting is more difficult and the success rate is lowered. The difficulty of site planting should also be tailored to the ability of your group
<P>
PLANTING SELECTION<BR>
There are several types of planting stock to choose from. Regardless of the stock type, the right species for the right micro-climate should be used. Examples of planting stock include:
<P>
Bare root stock is common. It is inexpensive and large numbers can be planted. Handling can be a problem as the roots quickly dry out when exposed to the air. The plants are small and can be trampled or mowed over. Fast growing brush can also shade out the seedlings
<P>
Plugs are also seedlings with a 'plug' of soil around the roots. These have a better survival rate but still have similar problems as the bare root stock.
<P>
Container stock is another common product in the landscape trades. These trees are larger and more tolerant to unskilled planting. The 1 gallon size is appropriate for most jobs and its size gives immediate impact. The cost of this material is higher and the holes are more difficult to dig but the success rate is high and the impact is more immediate.
<P>
Ball and Burlap stock are larger trees for areas that require immediate impact. These trees are heavy and are more difficult to plant but with proper supervision can be a great success. A significant budget is required for these trees.
<P>
LOCATING THE PLANTS<BR>
Funding is an important consideration before you begin to look for your trees. If funds are available commercial nurseries are a good source. Seedlings may be obtained from various forestry nurseries Regardless of where you get the trees, be sure the plants are in good shape and are the right plant for the right spot.
<P>

PLANTING AND DESIGN<BR>

Site design can vary depending on if you are planting an unprepared site or a manicured area. Generally the less prepared site requires more trees of a smaller size. Training and supervision is essential for a successful job and there are many good references available on how to properly plant trees - successfully planted trees are most likely to survive.
<P>
Locating and preparing the planting holes before the planters move in is good, especially for the younger planters, and planting details can be copied and distributed ahead of time. Not everybody likes trees and taking measures to prevent vandalism is important. Displaying signs to let the neighborhood know why suddenly there are several dozen strangers in the area is also important. Finally, be patient and be prepared for a few failures before success!

<font size="+1">CASE STUDY: COMMUNITY TREE PLANTING<BR> 
IN THE DISTRICT OF NORTH VANCOUVER</font size="+1">
<BR>
	
Phil Chapman</center>
<P>



My talk will encompass some of my experiences as they relate not only to naturalization planting but also to the other types of tree planting programs we have in the District of North Vancouver. I want to preface my remarks by saying that the District has a Street Tree Master Plan, a volunteer Street Tree Advisory Committee and was 1 of only 3 municipalities to receive a Green Streets Canada grant in 1994. The grant was for $75,000 with matching funds coming from the municipality. And I'm now in the rather embarrassing position of having the Parks Department staff worrying about how they can coordinate and plant all these tree projects and still take care of the rest of our parks system.  
<P>
The Green Streets grant ensured the swift implementation of the District Master Plan. And, in fact, due to the condition that the recipient plant a combination of seedlings, whips and saplings it also spurred development of an extensive program of naturalization planting projects to compliment the planting of street trees.
<P>
As well, and perhaps because of my urban planning background, the grant also allowed development of a Community Gateways program where we will combine third party sponsors financial contributions for pavers, benches, banners and signage with our grant funding for tree planting to create specially landscaped areas to identify various communities in our municipality.
<P>
Because of the Green Streets grant we expect to plant some 200 street trees and some 3200 containerized stock and seedlings. This will involve some 20 to 25 new tree planting projects and over 500 volunteer participants. Already we've planted over 1100 trees and involved 250 volunteers in our first 6 plantings. But it wasn't always so ....
<P>
Up until 3 years ago the District's approach to tree planting was an ad hoc one.  Street trees were provided as part of larger scale developments by private developers and as part of business revitalization, beautification or local improvements initiated by adjacent property owners. The Parks Department did all the tree planting and the little "naturalization planting" that was done was for restitution in newly developed neighbourhoods. There was little or no public input into the planning or implementation of these activities and no coordinated approach to the provision of these trees.
<P>
The District's approach began to change in 1992 when the Planning Department, in recognition of the urban trees value as desirable elements which unify streetscapes, establish community identity and create an attractive urban character, initiated the formation of a Street Tree Committee.
<P>
The Street Tree Committee was created of citizen volunteers, established by Council, to be advisory to staff.  The Committee was to be 1/2 experts and 1/2 interested individuals.  The experts were to represent the professions of landscape architecture, urban designers, aborists and horticulturists.  The new committee's role was to :
	<UL>
	<LI>Develop overall program objectives;
	<LI>Assist staff and consultants in developing a comprehensive Street Tree Master Plan;
	<LI>Develop implementation strategies for the plan through effective public participation programs;
	<LI>Advocate program funding and/or secure community donations; and
	<LI>Promote public involvement.
	</UL>
<P>
So right from the start this citizen group had a dual mandate - 1st to develop the Street Tree Master Plan and then 2nd to promote its implementation through PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND SPONSORSHIPS rather than strictly through municipal actions.
<P>
The first committee meeting was held in June 1992 and the Street Tree Master Plan, completely reviewed by the public and revised accordingly, was adopted by Council in early November 1993.
<P>
Ten days later the first street tree planting project took place - just in time for the Mayor to get his picture in the paper before election day. And after the planting the Street Tree Advisory Committee held a small reception to celebrate the beginning of implementation of the Street Tree Master Plan.
<P>The LESSONS are:<BR>

Have a plan; Include the politicians; Be aware of timing; and Recognize the success of the volunteer group.


<P>
It is imperative that you support your volunteers. Examples of how we did this include the letterhead and business cards created especially for the Advisory Committee members. Now I can tell you the Municipal Manager questioned the expense of the business cards but you can't expect volunteers to attempt to raise funds for these projects from big corporations and businesses without some props. And the Committee members are proud to have them - it makes them unique.
<P>
The LESSON is:<BR>

Create a sense of pride in your volunteers.
<P>
We prepared a display to advertise the District's Green Streets Award. It was displayed at several community meetings and a local shopping mall. We had sign up sheets and a video produced to get the word out about the District's community tree planting programs. The video, done in-house by staff on a volunteer basis was not very successful. Despite good intentions and adequate equipment the results weren't up to the professional standards most potential sponsors would expect. It was not used much.
<P>
Another way the Committee tried to promote the Green Streets program was to get a local artist to do an original artwork to illustrate the 3 types of planting programs in the typical North Vancouver setting. The art work would then serve as a basis for developing a "family" of promotional and support materials for fundraising. The Award Certificate and the "Partners in Planting" brochure are examples of how the painting was used as a multifunctional promotional tool.
<P>
The LESSON is:<BR>
Don't be afraid to experiment but don't use low quality material if you want money from others.
<P>
We had local school children prepare park designs as part of a naturalization planting project for a new park site next to their school. The teachers and kids really got behind this project and made it part of their educational curriculum. Their works were on display at the school's annual Environmental Fair the day we went to plant a ceremonial tree to officially start the park development.
<P>
Unfortunately an accidental sewage spill in the creek running through the park temporarily canceled the project. The spill was the same day as the Fair naturally! However, something good came out of this. The Engineering Department will now be doing the site preparation work for the park, necessary to create a little pond, as part of the work to fix the sewer line. This will save a major amount of volunteer labour.
<P>
The LESSON is:<BR>
You can't anticipate everything but sometimes you can turn a negative into a positive.
<P>
We prepared 3 display boards for our "Tree Planters Reception" night.  We invited 200 community service groups and leading businesses to this event. Only 30 came - even with follow up phone calls. We will, in the future, not mix groups and start meetings with business representatives at 5:30-6 not 7:30.
<P>
The LESSON is:<BR>
Use debriefing to identify how to improve for the next time.
<P>
For the Gateways and some Street Tree projects the Committee has  developed specific proposals in some detail. For example each of these proposals have full boards which are being used for presentations at the Real Estate Board. Rotary and Lions Clubs and others.
<P>
The LESSON is:<BR>
Target your efforts and tailor your projects to your target. (eg. Honor Row for the Legion)
<P>
The Real Estate Board is currently trying to fundraise $20-25,000 to undertake this Gateway project, that includes major signage and banners, to establish a sense of community identity at 3 locations. We've been back to the Real Estate Board 3 times now.
<P>
The LESSON is:<BR>
You need support materials, some staff resources and lots of persistence if you want other people's money.
<P>
We have many successful naturalization projects already completed. In most of these projects the volunteers have been coordinated by the Evergreen Foundation with whom we've had a very successful relationship. Even with that assistance, these naturalization projects cost the municipality considerable expense as the planting sites need preparation, materials need to be determined, sourced, delivered and some supervision provided on the planting day - which is usually during non-working hours.

<P>The LESSON is:<BR>

Municipalities, especially those without Green Streets funding, may not be able to undertake as many tree planting projects as they wish even if much of the project is done by volunteers.
<P>
To summarize, the District of North Vancouver has a variety of community based tree planting programs which have been developed as a result of having 3 things:  1)  a Street Tree Master Plan; 2)  an active citizen volunteer group; and, 3)  a Green Street grant.
<P>
In support of these planting programs a wide variety of advertising, promotional materials, information, publicity events and staff support has been tried.  Some things have worked better than others.  The key to success, particularly in fundraising and community involvement seems to be in adopting a flexible approach, not staying with things that don't work, and targeting sponsors with tailor made projects.

EVERETT CROWLEY NATURE PARK ENHANCEMENT PROJECT</font size="+1">

"Few of us can hope to leave a poem or a work of art to posterity but, working together or apart we can yet save meadows, marshes, strips of seashore and stream valleys as a green legacy for the Centuries."
<BR>----Stuart L Udall

<P>
PARK NAME: Everett Crowley<BR>
DEDICATED: 1987<BR>
LOCATION: S.E. Marine Dr. & Kerr St. Vancouver<BR>
SIZE: 100 Acres<BR>
<P>
Dedicated by the Parks Board in 1987, the Park is named after the late "Everett Crowley" who passed away in 1984 at the age of 76; the park is a living legacy to his honor. Mr. Crowley's father founded AVALON DAIRY which his family still operate. As a town planner and Park Commissioner, Everett Crowley was instrumental in the concept and development of the Killarney Park Complex and neighbourhood.
<P>
The generosity of the Crowley Family has greatly assisted enhancement of the Park. Everett Crowley's widow, Jean, financed a $5000.00 aerial photograph that enabled accurate mapping of the Parks topography and a $4000.00 donation for native trees and flowering shrubs. 
<P>
Unsuccessful grant applications did not bring in the requested funding but we did receive unanimous support and numerous letters supporting this project. These letters were most useful as supporting documents requested by other funders. Subsequently, further funding was awarded from the GO B.C. grants (now defunct), The City of Vancouver, The Environment Youth Corp, Champlain Lions Club, Avalon Dairy, Mrs. Jean Crowley and the Evergreen Foundation.
<P>
Everett Crowley, Vancouver's fifth largest park, was reclaimed by nature over the last twenty five years. Formerly, this site was a City disposal area until 1965 and was monitored for methane gas emissions for the next twenty years. In 1985 it became a Parks Board storage and works yard for top soils, bark mulch and landscaping materials.  Today a unique natural environment and varied habitat has redeemed this park, to include cool shady woods, tranquil marshes and meandering Kinross Creek. Though even this is a far cry from the site's natural beauty 100 years ago when Kinross Creek cascaded over the cliffs in a waterfall and salmon spawned along it's banks. 
<P>
The Park now boasts a migratory song bird population unique to South East Vancouver. Wintering Finches, Sparrows, Robins, Cedar Waxwings, Towhees, Pheasants and Thrushes are attracted to the plentiful seed and fruit bearing plants such as hawthorn, yarrow and the plentiful blackberry. Numerous predatory birds are attracted to the large rodent population and the proximity to the Fraser River. A stroll along any trail might find you in the company of a Stellar Jay, Woodpecker, Hawk, Owl, Red Winged Blackbird, the rare Virginia Rail or Blue Heron.
<P>
After 2 years of arduous work by dedicated community residents to begin initial clean up of visible refuse, the VANCOUVER NATURAL HISTORY SOCIETY was contacted in order to ascertain the potential of the site for a low development nature park. Under the leadership of Kevin Bell and the Conservation Committee a survey of the site was done. An inventory of trees and plants was recorded as well as species of resident, predatory and migratory song birds. This survey by the Vancouver Natural History Society was presented as a brief to the Park Commissioners requesting their support. 
<P>
The brief included the following recommendations for future park development:
	<UL>
	<LI>Leave as much scrub, brush, undergrowth, etc., as possible. 60%  of song bird species nest in this sort of habitat.
	<LI>Develop marsh area as a pond-marsh system keeping pond shallow    
	<LI>Leave much of area in wild "untidy" state
	<LI>Plant native trees and shrubs
	<LI>Develop a long-term plan 
	</UL>
<P>
Following the presentation to the Park Commissioners the following motion was passed unanimously:
<P>"That this Park Board commit itself to preserving this area in its naturalness and to any enhancement that will achieve this objective".
<P>
With this support, the Everett Crowley Planning Committee submitted an application to the Park Board Capital Plan and received $50,000 to improve existing trails, to develop a new trail system that is now 5 kilometers long, and to construct three southern view points by broadening, leveling and applying a trail surface of clay topped with bark mulch. The committee worked very closely with a Landscape Architect from the Vancouver Park Board who shared our vision.
<P>
TROUBLE SHOOTING<BR>

One of the first challenges facing the planning committee was building a relationship of trust with the Park Board Operations Staff. They had had unlimited, unaccountable use of this site for twenty years and were unfamiliar with this kind of community involvement. By maintaining an ongoing dialogue with the Managers and Unionized Staff we have developed a shared respect for each other and each others relationship with the Park
<P>
Few direct incidents arose from the history of the site as a disposal area except for the initial clean-up of exposed refuse (car engines, batteries, tires, washers etc). One very startling event required immediate and long term action. Roofing companies, in the later years of the land fill were allowed to dump barrels of unused tar in a particular dried-up ravine. Eventually the barrels rusted, causing the tar to leach into the surrounding ground. Environment Canada was consulted and they instructed that the area should be buried, as removing the barrels was an uncalculated risk and cost. So for the last six years the Operations Staff have been covering the site with landfill and rock generated by Park construction and maintenance.
<P>
Another unforeseen event was opposition by residents, whose property bordered the Park, to any form of development. Many had purchased their property because of its proximity to this wild, undeveloped site. One resident even held to the promise of his Real Estate Agent, that "this property will never be developed and you will always have your privacy. So, when planning trails, tree planting or future projects, we must observe the unmarked no-man zone bordering the single family homes. There has been encroachment into the Park by the residents in the form of vegetable gardens, evergreen hedges for privacy and composting.
<P>
One ongoing dilemma is vandalism and all night bonfires in the Park by the communities youth. The police cannot possibly monitor this situation because of the isolation of the site. The Community Youth Worker has sought to establish relations with the youth in an effort to help them develop respect for the Park and take responsibility for they actions within it.

NATURE PROGRAMMING AND SPECIAL EVENTS<BR>
This site has always been a favorite destination for community residents young and old. Prior to the enhancement, project activities ranged from walking, jogging, cycling, blackberry picking, fort construction, aquatic adventures, handgliding and off road motorcycling. But unfortunately the image as a disposal site was never far from view. Garbage, construction materials and garden litter continued to find its way to the site.
<P>
The ongoing enhancement and Community awareness has lessened this problem and dumping of unwanted waste has almost ceased. One of the reasons for this change in attitude is program planning by a trained naturalist and by advertising family nature walks, children's nature programs and special events held in the park.

Edmonton, Alberta 
 </h2> <br></center>



<h3>Planning Phase, fall'96 / winter'97 update </h3>


We're just beginning a school learning grounds project.  
We have students, parents and teachers on the committee.  As
students on the committee, we would like to communicate with other
interested students who have done or are doing a school learning grounds
project.  
<p>
We have managed to get the project off
the ground by establishing a student working committee and a parent advisory
committee to support the students. The school principal and a teacher are also
part of the working committee along with a landscape architect. We will certainly
draw on your wealth of experience as the project gets actioned - hopefully with
phase one this spring.
<p>
By January 1997, we are nearing completion of input by students,
 teachers and parents for our
school learning grounds project. A pond appears to be a number 1 priority. While
this is good news, there are a number of pond related issues that we will have to
deal with before the pond becomes a reality. We would like to be able to respond
to initial questions that arise from the community eg. 
<UL>
	<LI> safety - "kids will get wet or worse, drown", 
	<LI> how will it be maintained etc. 
</UL>
<p>
We're looking for advice on what we can expect in terms of community questions and in 
turn, responses to these
questions? Information received will be used to help the students problem solve
for this aspect of the project. 
<p>
Secondly, in relation to some of the issue areas, is there any advice on locating
the pond on the school ground (the general area identified for the project is a
strip of land approximately 20m wide on the east side of the school), as well as
suggested size and depth for the pond and landscaping techniques to maximize the
benefits?

<center><H2>The Sundance School Garry Oak Meadow Project 
<br>(Victoria, BC)</H2></center>

 <p>
Sundance Elementary School is located in Victoria, British Columbia, on a site historically occupied by a Garry oak meadow ecosystem. Considered endangered, Garry oak ecosystems are restricted primarily to the southeast coast of Vancouver Island and the sothern Gulf Islands. Over the last 150 years, most of the native Garry oak ecosystems have been destroyed by agriculture and urban development, resulting in the loss of habitat for many rare species of plants and animals.
 <p>
<IMG SRC="nsbcsundance1.jpeg" align=left border=0>In the spring of 1994, a group of parents and students at Sundance School decided it was important to restore the school ground to its natural state in an effort to preserve a little piece of this vanishing ecosystem. Our first task was to educate ourselves and the rest of the school community about Garry oak ecosystem. We arranged for two biologists to speak to the school about Gary oak meadow ecosystems and why they were important. In the Fall of 1995, we formed a Garry oak meadow group of 15 students from the age of 6 - 12, and 2 parents. We hired a landscape architect, Michael Bocking, and together we planned a strategy for restoration.
 <p>
An important component of the process was a series of field trips that the group took to Uplands Park, a natural Garry oak meadow loocated only a few minutes drive from the school. We visited the park on three occasions from early to late spring so that we could document the changes in the trees, shrubs and wildflowers throughtout the growing season. We dug test holes to learn about the different soil depth and moisture requirements of each plant. Each student chose one native plant to study over the course of the field trips. From the information the students gathered, a 'phenology' or plant progress table was prepared.
 <p>
The knowledge and enthusiasm gained by the students over the period of these three field trips was transferred back to the rest of the school in the late spring. The students mapped the schoolyard and developed a planting plan, locating plants only in areas agreed upon by the entire student body. In May, an all-school "plant-in" was held, resulting in the planting of over 150 trees, shrubs and wildflowers, and the builfding of a chip trial to create a natural boundary to remind people not to trample the meadow.
 <p>
Over the summer, the planted area is being watered regularly by volunteer families from the school community. Signs are currently on order, asking people not to walk on the meadow areas, and in the fall, we have an outdoor 'Garry oak meadow' mural, and more field trips and plantings planned. Our greatest problem has been keeping the school district groundskeepers from mowing the meadow area. Our greatest hope is to get a teacher involved with the group.

We arrive at the BC Rail whistle stop called Cheakamus Station, its only 3 kms north of NVOS. NVOS is on the Cheakamus River, about 10 kms north of where it meets the Squamish River (about 55km north of Vancouver, and 45 kms south of Whistler). Victor lead our group on a wonderful walk to the school, putting things in context and giving everyone a sense of place. 
<p>
Since the last ice age ended (approx. 8,000 BC), this river valley has been
in constant change. Seasonal flooding and changes in river course are dominate forces on the land. These changes even presist today after the construction of the Daisy Lake Dam near Whistler. Evidence of these changes can be seen in the landscape and the vegetation. Valley bottom"old growth coniferous" forest has been kept in constant cycles of renewal by the river. The changes and braiding of the Cheakamus River encourages tree species such as Black Cottonwood and Alder to grow at river's edge. This is crucial for bald eagle winter feeding habitat. It also produces excellent salmon spawning channels, which make salmon carcasses easy for eagles to dine on. 
<p>
Since European settlement, and especially since the river has been used to create electricity, humans have become the dominant force of change in what has been named Paradise Valley.

The Outdoor School is a175 hectare (420 acre) environmental education and ecological conservation preserve. Its focus is hands-on
educational activities for students of all ages (most of whom are from
North Vancouver S.D., but all are welcome). Close to 100 000 students have studied at the school since it began in 1969. As a residential field school NVOS has developed special teaching facilities for forests, agriculture, wildlife conservation, streams and rivers, and Coast Salish traditional culture. The school is also available as a conference centre, an especially important source of revenue for this increasingly self-supporting educational center.

Our group had been invited to NVOS on this crisp, almost-clear December day, as the first in-service for the NVOS Associates program. NVOS Associates is an initiative started by Outdoor School to improve communication/networking with teachers and other educational partners like the Evergreen Foundation. Special Associate in-service days are sponsored by NVOS and its friends such as, Canada Trust "Friends of the Environment" and Nature Conservancy of Canada. Each Associate day focusses on NVOS, how it works, what to expect, how to prepare and integrate it into classroom curriculum. It is also an opportunity for educators to learn more about other environmental education initiatives like School Grounds Naturalization. The goal is to provide "training" for Associates so they can act as lead teachers within their schools, school districts and communities.

Nothing can prepare you for the first time that you see salmon streams
during spawning season. The green and grey camouflaged backs Chum salmon are everywhere.<p>

<IMG SRC="nvosdieingsalmon.gif" border=0><br>

This year about 20 000 Chum salmon (10 000 males / 10 000 females) spawned at Outdoor School. Each fish averages about 8 kg in weight, which is 160 000 kg of salmon carcasses. Is it any wonder why the bald eagles congregate around Outdoor School in late December and January? Each female salmon produces about 3000 eggs, that's 30 000 000 eggs. In the spawning channels of Outdoor School about 80% of the eggs become fry so that's 24 000 000 fry. Is it any wonder why the work of Outdoor School is so important?

NVOS has embarked on a major program of salmon enhancement with the help of Save the Salmon Society, Coho Festival, Nature Conservancy of Canada and Federal Dept. of Fisheries and Oceans. This enhancement has focused on habitat, although there has also been some teaching hatchery work too.
<p>
The grounds of the Outdoor School have had a lot of work to their streams,
with attention to the specific habitat needs of various types of salmon
including Chum, Coho, Chinook and Pink salmon.
<p>
On this early December day, these streams were OVER-FLOWING with spawning Chum salmon. These salmon lay there eggs in the gravel beds of the school's spawning channels and Cheakamus River. In the spring the eggs of Chum and Coho that spawn in November and December hatch. The Chum head out towards the ocean. The Coho search out river pools for their first year, then make their way to the ocean. About four years after their birth the salmon adults which have survived, now weighing 15 000 to 20000 times what they did at hatching, battle their way back up the rivers and streams to spawn - and then die.  When we visited even the pathways which had been flooded but, were now above the water line, as well as the stream banks were littered with near-dead salmon and bodies of those that had finished their life's journey. This massive number of salmon carcasses are a critical winter food for crows, gulls, mergansers, dippers, bald eagles, and other birds. The rotting bodies and droppings of the birds and other animals that feed on them fertilize the forest, improving its health. Insects falling from the branches of the surrounding healthy forest are important first food for ravenous emerging salmon fry.
<p>
Streams around the Outdoor School are also home to the endangered Coho
salmon, which has a tougher time of it since they spend their first year
living in the streams (which are under tremendous stress in many places in
B.C.) and often end up as food for young Chum salmon.
<p>
This area around Brackendale, with its amazingly healthy salmon habitat, has
become THE LARGEST WINTER NESTING GROUND FOR BALD EAGLES.

Just arriving in early December, bald eagles from across North America will soon converge on the healthy salmon habitats of British Columbia and Alaska. They depend on this salmon feast during the winter months, heading back to their summer nesting areas in late Janaury and February. It is estimated that are 60 000 baldd eagles in North America and about 8% of them stay the winter in Brackendale and NVOS.<br clear>
<IMG SRC="nvoseagle1.gif"align=right hspace=10 border=0>
<br>

In 1994, a WORLD RECORD eagle count took place around Brackendale, with over 3,700 bald eagles counted in a single day.
The eagles feed on salmon, using the open branches of Black Cottonwood trees as daytime feeding perches. At night, the eagles return to mature conifers in the surrounding hills for communal protection from the elements. This critical winter habitat is a complex mix of food and
various forest types around the river and streams. It is likely that the area around Brackendale has seen an increase in the number of eagles wintering here due to a reduction of suitable habitat elsewhere.
<p>
Threats to habitat can include careless and/or greed-based forestry, damming of rivers, road building, toxins released into water by industry &
residents, housing and golf course development, increased human use, even
airport expansions.
<IMG SRC="nvoseagle2.gif"align=right hspace=10 border=0>
<p> In order to protect this improtant eagle winter habitat, The North Vancouver
Outdoor School is looking at putting an ecological covenant on their property, 
joining a larger effort led by the Nature Conservancy of Canada (with the
support of the Steelhead Society of
BC, Brackendale Art Gallery, Squamish Estuary Conservation Society 
and <A HREF="http://www.eagletree.com/think/lowermainland.html">@Eagletree</A>).(These are the only photos on the tour not taken with Kodak's DC 40 digital camera)

The NVOS Associates program involved morning and afternoon familiarization trips around the
property and facilities, which include an animal farm area, salmon streams and quite varied forest
types, including some "old growth areas". (Although most cedars, true firs and Douglas Firs
are only a hundred or more years old, there are a few areas where these confires dominate the
forest as they would in an older forest. There are also a few ancient cedars on their
 last legs, left behind by forestry activities in the 1920's & 1930's, as well as snags
and dead goliaths fallen over and beginning their long journey to becoming soil, such as this
cedar which could easily have lived for 1,000 years.)

On the bus ride back to North Vancouver, it was
apparent to all that the North Vancouver Outdoor School has a truly incredible 
geographic location, 
facilities, staff and programming. It offers students, educators and conference-goers alike 
an excellent opportunity to learn first hand about the unique seasons and cycles of
British Columbia's river ecology.

<P> The Earth Observing System (EOS) is the corner stone of NASA's
Mission to Planet Earth (MtPE) program and is an integral part of the
U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). NASA's Mission to Planet
Earth will use space- and ground-based measurement systems to provide
the scientific basis for understanding global change. EOS, Earth Probe,
Pathfinder, and related data products will be available at the Earth
Observing System Data Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active
Archive Centers (DAACs).

The CEOSIDN List, which was merged with the INTEROP List, was also
archived in a similar manner.  The CEOSIDN List was originally
receiving the INTEROP messages after INTEROP participants had given
initial responses.  The CEOSIDN list was for discussions relating to
the use of the DIF format by The Committee on Earth Observation
Satellites International Directory Network (CEOS IDN).

<A NAME="use"><h2>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h2></A>
<P>
The GCMD staff is presently exploring the nature and feasibility
of distributed directory systems through their work with the 
<A HREF="http://hollywood.gso.uri.edu/DODS/home/home.html">Distributed Oceanographic Data System (DODS) </a>in collaboration 
with developers at the University of Rhode Island and with the
<A HREF="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/ceosidn">CEOS International Directory Network </a>nodes.  The opportunity to 
explore "distributed" technology will be helpful in guiding the 
feasibility of implementing such technology for <A HREF="http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov/">GCDIS </a>and in
guiding extended capabilities for the CEOS IDN.  In addition 
to concentrating on this distributed capability, the GCMD 
project's strategy seeks to extend its utility by:


(1) concentrating on methods for automatic updating of directory 
    information and providing better tools for data set providers to
    share the information on their products, 
(2) exploring avenues for increasing population efforts beyond the
    public sector, 
(3) integrating with other levels of information services, such as 
    the future EOSDIS Advertising Service, 
(4) dealing effectively with data set descriptions of widely variable 
    spatial scales,
(5) developing an extended thesaurus for Earth science data set 
    discovery, and
(6) serving in a maintenance capacity for evolving keyword sets
    associated with Earth science data sets.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The GCMD Oracle database can be queried for dataset descriptions (DIFs) by 
using the fill-in-the-blank form 
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/mainquery.html"> mainquery.html</a>. Several 
fields are presented and the user may either enter text or select a list of
valid values from which to choose. Once the boxes are filled in with the desired
selection criteria, the form may be submitted to query the database for DIFs
which match the criteria. A user may fill in as many or as few fields as 
desired. However, a limit of 300 DIFs are retrieved, so if the query is 
sufficiently broad as to exceed that number, the user will be asked to further
refine their search. When a form is submitted, either by clicking on a "Valids"
or "Submit Query" button, a C program is called that will submit SQL-based 
queries to the Oracle database using the GCMD software libraries, as described 
in the <a href="ftp://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/md/docs/">GCMD system 
documentation and programmers guide</a>. Supplementary information (i.e. data 
center, satellite, instrument and project descriptions) 
can be retrieved by using the fill-in-the-blank forms available from choosing 
the<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/query2.html"> Supplementary
Information Search </a>at the top of mainquery.html.

<h2>Dataset Description (DIF) Query </h2>

<ol>
<li> 
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/mainquery.html">
mainquery.html</a> -- This text file is the fill-in-the-blank form for 
                 starting a database query. A click on any of the "Valids" 
                 buttons or the "Submit Query" button will initiate a call to 
                 MD-dif-query<p>

<li> MD-dif-query -- This C program receives and processes the information from
                the mainquery form. The input query string is parsed to 
                extract a list of name=value pairs from the query form. If a
                request for valids is detected this program will query the
                database for a list of valid values for that particular field. 
                Procedures from the GCMD software library
                are used to access the Oracle database. 
                After retrieving a list of 
                values from the database, the program redraws the 
                form with the list presented in a selection box. 
                The user may then choose or not choose a selection from the 
                valids list.  It is possible to enter the starting 
                letter or fragment of a word and then click on the "Valids"
                button to narrow down the list of valids. Selection criteria 
                also may be typed directly into the blank boxes. 
                This process is iterated until a DIF query is selected with the
                "Submit Query" button. The program then queries the database 
                for DIFs that match the criteria specified in the form. If no
                DIFs satisfy the selection criteria, an informational message is
                displayed. If there are more than 300 DIFs that satisfy the
                criteria, a message is sent advising that the search be
                further narrowed. Otherwise a list of DIF titles is presented. 
                One may click on the title to view the DIF. This will initiate
                a call to the program getdif.<p>

<li> getdif --  This C program queries the database for the selected dataset
                information. The DIF entry_id is specified
                as part of the URL that invokes this program. The desired 
                display format is also part of the URL and is provided by an
                option selected in the original mainquery form. The URL used to
                invoke getdif has the form http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=requested_format&entry=requested_entry_id&form=form_server.
                The DIF entry is then displayed in the format specified. 
                A DIF may also
                have a list of related supplementary information at the 
                bottom. A click on a Supplementary Information title will 
                initiate a call to getdif.<p>

</ol>

<h2>Supplementary Information Query </h2>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/query2.html">
query2.html</a> -- This text file provides a menu of hypertext links to the
                 4 different fill-in-the-blank forms provided to query for
                 supplementary entry descriptions. They are data center, 
                 source (e.g. satellite), sensor (e.g. instrument) and 
                 project/campaign.<p>

<li>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/dcquery.html">
dcquery.html</a> -- This text file is the fill-in-the-blank form for 
                 starting a database query for data center information. 
                 A click on either of the "Valids" buttons or the "Query" 
                 button will initiate a call to MD-supp-query<p>

<li>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/sourcequery.html">
sourcequery.html</a> -- This text file is the fill-in-the-blank form for 
                 starting a database query for source information.

                 A click on the "Valids" buttons or the "Query" 
                 button will initiate a call to MD-supp-query<p>

<li>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cpquery.html">
cpquery.html</a> -- This text file is the fill-in-the-blank form for 
                 starting a database query for project information. 
                 A click on the "Valids" buttons or the "Query" 
                 button will initiate a call to MD-supp-query<p>

<li> MD-supp-query -- This C program receives and processes the information from
                the 4 supplementary information forms. The input query string 
                is parsed to extract a list of name=value pairs from the query 
                form. If a request for valids is submitted this program will 
                query the database for a list of valid values for that 
                particular field. Procedures from the GCMD software library
                are used to access the Oracle database. After retrieving a 
                list of values from the database, the program redraws the 
                form with the list presented in a selection box. 
                The user must then choose a selection from the valids list. 
                It is possible to enter the starting 
                letter or fragment of a word and then click on the "Valids"
                button to narrow down the list of valids. Selection criteria 
                also may be typed directly into the blank boxes. 
                This process is iterated until a Supplementary Information 
                query is selected with the "Query" button. The program then 
                queries the database for Supplementary Information that match 
                the criteria specified in the form. If nothing satisfies the 
                selection criteria, an informatative message is displayed. 
                Otherwise a list of Supplementary Information titles is 
                presented. One may click on the title to view the 
                Supplementary Information. This will initiate a call to the 
                program getdif.<p>

<li> getdif --  This C program queries the database for the selected 
                supplementary information. The DIF entry_id is specified
                as part of the URL that invokes this program. The desired 
                display format is also part of the URL and is provided by an
                option selected in the original mainquery form. The URL used to
                invoke getdif has the form http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?suppmenu=supp_type:supp_name. The supplementary entry is then displayed.

<h1>GCMD's MD-Isite Information Page</h1>
<h3>(Felded/Full Free-Text Search with Z39.50 Prototype)</h3>

</center>
<hr>
The Global Change Master Directory (<A HREF="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov">GCMD</a>
) offers a comprehensive
 source of information about worldwide Earth science data holdings 
available to the science community.  All data set descriptions and supplementary information (data centers, sources, sensors, and campaigns) are 
managed under a relational database.  On a periodic basis, text based 
<A HREF="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/difguide/difman.html">DIFs</a> and Supplementary entries 
are extracted from the relational database and then indexed using Iindex in 
conjunction with the DIF and SUPP document types.
<p>
Included in MD-Isite is an implementation of a Z39.50 search
and retrieval prototype.  GCMD's release of MD-Isite (with fielded/full free-text searching and Z39.50 capabilities) is based on the Isite software package developed by the Center for Networked Information
Discovery and Retrieval (<A HREF="http://cnidr.org/">CNIDR</A>) which includes a Z39.50 server (zserver) and a WWW-Z39.50 gateway
(zgate).  
In order to support the DIF and Supplementary formats, CNIDR's Isite software
was enhancemented by
 the GCMD development team.  MD-Isite will be operational at many nodes in the International Directory Network <A HREF="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/ceosidn">(IDN)</A>.
<p>
Our Z39.50 server is configured to search our text based DIF and Supplementary
Information databases using Isearch.  Data set descriptions can be displayed
in the Raw DIF, Display DIF, 
<A HREF="http://www.fgdc.gov">FGDC</a>, and
<A HREF="http://info.er.usgs.gov/gils/">GILS</a> formats. 
<p>
Once a user accesses the MD-Isite query page,a stateful connection
is maintained between the gateway and the Z39.50 server.
The gateway and server act within client-server communications.
Searches and DIF presentations can be conducted during the same session. 
There is a 15 minute idle timeout.  If the user does not interact with the
session for more than 15 minutes, then the session will end.
<p>
The following flow diagram (in text) describes the high level architecture of 
the MD-Isite search system.

<A NAME="1"><H4>Fiscal Year 1996 Accomplishments of the GCMD</H4></A>

<p>
*Usage of the system increased more than three-fold when
 comparing the first six months of FY96 with the first six
 months of FY 95.

<p>
*Volume of DIF entries for the first six months of FY96
 almost doubled those for the first six months of FY94.

<p>
*DIF population strategies were developed to target various
 segments of the data producer population to increase the
 number of data sets referenced in the GCMD.  A sample result:

<UL>
  <LI> Twenty-two data set descriptions were received from Electric
   Power Research Institute.  This  was the first time the GCMD
   had received completed data set descriptions from industry.

</UL>
<p>
*New software tools were written for DIF writers - DIFmacs,
 DIFweb, and DIFwrite, eliminating the chore of plowing
 through complicated documentation to correctly write a DIF.

<p>
*Major emphasis on streamlining the data flow and improving
 the database "loading" software propelled the turn-aroundtime 
 for loading DIFs from weeks to minutes.

<p>
*GCMD statistics were used to analyze the trends of usage.
 They showed a significant move from the use of dedicated
 clients to WWW applications.  Important and timely decisions
 were made to discontinue the development of these dedicated
 clients and redirect efforts to WWW applications.

<p>
*The GCMD Internet site was selected by the McKinley Group's
 professional editorial team as a "3-Star" site.  This rating
 is a special mark of achievement in Magellan, McKinley's
 comprehensive Internet directory of over 1.5 millsion sites
 and 40,000 reviews.

<p>
*A new ecosystem/biological science coordinator, funded through
 the National Biological Service (NBS), joined the GCMD staff.
 The coordinator will populate both the GCMD and the National
 Biological Information Infrastructure, a distributed computer
 network of different sources of biological data and information.

<UL>
  <LI> The first five DIFs for the NBS were loaded into the new database.
   These DIFs also comply with the demands for metadata content by
   the NBII.  To meet the mutual goals for population efforts of the
   National Biological Service's NBII and the GCMD DIF, the NBS/FGDC
   metadata records will be stored in html files separate from GCMD
   DIFs with hyperlinks between the DIF and the more detailed NBS/FGDC
   metadata record.


</UL>
<p>
*An article entitled "Global Change Master Directory Enhances Search
 for Earth Science Data" appeared on the front page of EOS, Transactions, 
 of the American Geophysical Union.  An electronic supplement
 to the article was offered on the Web through the AGU.  A second
 article appeared in Government Computer News entitled, "NASA,
 biology service enrich databases for Web sites".  Also, a graphic
 using a Landsat image overlay on Chesapeake Bay GIS data was
 completed for a GIS World article on the GCMD/NBS collaboration.
 An updated bookmark advertising the GCMD capabilities was also
 completed.

<p>
*An internal software capability, named DIFmorph, was written
 to provide for multiple and evolving format options for
 displaying DIFs.  It was created originally to output the
 DIF using the Content Standard for Digital Geospatial
 Metadata format (FGDC) and for the Government Information
 Locator System (GILS).

<p>
*Successful coordination and cooperation were achieved in
 adding 10 new fields to the Directory Interchange Format
 (DIF) through the effective use of the GCMD ListServer.
 These changes were agreed upon by U.S. agencies and participating
 CEOS countries.

<p>
*Coordination efforts continued with Mission to Planet Earth's
 EOSDIS Version 0 and ECS.  Both V0 and ECS have accepted the
 GCMD keywords.

<p>
*Parameter keywords were upgraded and fine-tuned for consistency, mutual
 exclusivity, and proper specificity.  The results of this important
 effort have gained wide acceptance throughout the Earth science community,
 with the new keywords being requested for use by other Federal agencies.

<p>
*The status, progress, issues, and plans of the GCMD were presented
 to the Science User Working Group in April, 1996.  Specific responses
 to recommendations from the July 1995 UWG were presented.  A report
 dated June 12, 1996 documents the result of the latest meeting.

<p>
*The space science entries were extracted from the GCMD in order
 to offer a more direct route to locating Earth science data sets.

<p>
*GCMD's freshly baselined and documented Release 4.0 software was
 successfully ported to the NASDA (Japan), ESA (Italy), CCRS (Canada),
 and CSIRO (Australia) CEOS IDN Coordinating Nodes.  The port included
 implementations of the GCMD's generic WWW module interface to the
 database.  This port required cross-platform modifications.  Assistance
 was also provided to DLR (Germany).

<p>
*The Z39.50 distributed fielded-text/full-text Boolean search was
 demonstrated at the CEOS meeting in Japan.  One NASDA machine and two
 NASA GCMD machines stored different DIFs.  One query was entered via
 the World Wide Web and results from all three Z39.50 servers were
 displayed.  GCMD acted as the WWW-to-Z39.50 gateway.

<p>
*The prototype Z39.50 Stateless Gateway using Isite 1.05 software was
 made operational on the gcmd machine. http://gcmd,gsfc.nasa.gov/query1.html

<p>
*Staff modified the Center for Networked Information Discovery and
 Retrieval's (CNIDR) Isite WWW-Z39.50 gateway to prevent the main
 process from hindering CPU utilization and shared the diagnosis with
 other users through CNIDR's List Server.

<p>
*Outreach was expanded to include local activities, such as
 the Save Our Streams Project and joint projects with Universities,
 as well as broader scale projects with the United Nation's Environmental
 Program (UNEP), with the European Commission's Joint Research Center in
 Ispra, Italy, and the Australian Oceanographic Data Center.  A GCMD
 representative also served as an invited member of the EPA's EMAP
 Data Management Review Team in May, 1996.

<p>
*The DIF Writer's Guide was updated and stabilized as DIF
 Version 5 to correspond to the upcoming Version 5 Software
 Release.  A postscript version of the document was made
 available on the ftp site, along with a DIF template.
 In addition, a  WWW page on proposed fields for DIF Version 6
 (Aggregation, Language, Location, and YBP) was written.

<p>
*The population strategies, statistics, development and operations
 efforts, and the status and plans for the GCMD were presented at the
 GCDIS Contacts Meeting in June 1996. Also in June, the logic and
 rules used in development of the GCMD's valid parameter keywords
 were presented to FGDC Clearinghouse participants in anticipation
 of the adoption of these keywords by the FGDC Clearinghouse.

<p>
*GCMD representatives visited the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis
 Center (CDIAC) and other DOE Oak Ridge Laboratories to provide information
 about GCMD and discuss cooperative activities.  Also, the GCMD staff hosted
 NOAA staff members representing the National Environmental Data Index (NEDI)
 to discuss NEDI-GCMD connectivity issues.

<p>
*Lola Olsen was selected to lead the interagency USGCRP Global
 Change Data and Information System (GCDIS) subgroup work.

<p>
*As part of investigating Directory Interchange Format (DIF) population
 strategies, packages of DIF registration tools were mailed to University
 researchers in an effort to identify data sets residing within universities.

<p>
*The personnel database (3700 records) on the GCMD was reviewed,
 updated, and quality-controlled for the upcoming Version 5 release.

<p>
*The automapping program was run for all of the baselined DIFs and
 manual editing for new keywords was initiated for the Release of
 GCMD Version 5.

<p>
*Staff created an animated GCMD logo by generating 20 gifs, each
 depicting a different aspect of the Earth's surface.  These images
 were then loaded into an animation generation software package to
 produce the final product:<BR>
 http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/gcmd_animate.gif

<p>
*Two GCMD staff developers attended the Distributed Oceanographic Data
 System (DODS) Developers Meeting in Boulder on August 5-6.  GCMD staff
 and DODS core developers agreed upon an initial technical
 implementation and partition of effort for the use of the GCMD as a
 DODS locator service.  Architecture, population, and data location
 issues were also discussed.

<p>
*The GCMD Staff met with representatives from UNEP/GRID concerning
 interoperability of metadata between GCMD and GRID.  Discussion included
 conversion of GRID DIFs to GCMD DIFs (including parameter and location
 interoperability), IDN Coordinating Node status, and eventual z39.50
 distributed searching.

<p>
 (UNEP GRID   United Nations Environmental Program's
             Global Resource Information Database)

<p>
*A GCMD staff member attended the Ecological Society of America Annual
 Meeting in Providence, RI, August 11-13 to present an overview of the
 GCMD at the ESA Long Term Studies Section Meeting.  Many ecologists
 expressed surprise at the existence of such a service, indicating that
 more work needs to be done to promote the GCMD to the ecological community.

<p>
* Options were added to the GCMD's operational system administration
interface to enhance database communications for CEOS IDN node
administrators.

<p>
* Representatives from the Japanese Institute for Science and Technology
(JICST) visited the GCMD to discuss their role as a Cooperating Node
of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) International
Directory Network (IDN).  JICST is prepared to begin sharing data set
descriptions through the IDN.

<p>
* Several presentations were given at the biannual CEOS Meeting in
Sioux Falls, SD, concerning the IDN.  Plans to establish the synchronization
of valid parameters were successfully negotiated, as well as improved
procedures to share information among the nodes.  

The operational aspects of adding, changing, and deleting data set
information were delineated in an effort to work toward achieving
synchronization through automated transfer of information among the
Cooperating and Coordinating Nodes of the IDN.

<A NAME="mission"><h2>The GCMD Mission</h2></A>

<blockquote><h3>The mission of the Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) 
is to assist the
scientific community in the discovery of and linkage to Earth science data,
as well as to provide data holders with a means to advertise their data to
the Earth Science Community.</h3></blockquote>

<P>
The GCMD offers data set descriptions in a standard format, the
Directory Interchange Format (DIF).  The DIF holds a specific set
of information fields in a database to assist in normalizing the
search for data set information.  The GCMD philosophy for use of 
the Directory Interchange Format and thus the specific set of 
attributes, <b>metadata</b>, is that the predetermined set of fields is 
the critical set needed for a user to determine if the datasets 
returned from a database query are those that define viable 
alternative data sets for the user's needs. 

<P>
Definition of <b>Metadata</b>: "Descriptive information that characterizes 
a set of quantitative and/or qualitative measurements and distinguishes 
that set from other similar measurement sets." - Lola Olsen. 
 
 
<P>
Fringe benefits of the GCMD work support other efforts:  (1) The
translation package, DIFmorph, has been shared with several groups. 
This software package permits translation among several metadata formats and
permits greater flexibility in handling the needs of diverse communities
that require varying levels of metadata detail.  (2) The GCMD assisted
other groups in understanding and thus determining the essense and intent
of the Federal Geographic Data Committee's Content Standard for Digital 
Geospatial Metadata.   (3) The GCMD's work in structuring hierarchical
sets of parameter keywords has been enthusiastically accepted and
implemented for use by numerous groups, including the
<A HREF="http://fgdc.er.usgs.gov/fgdc.html">FGDC Clearinghouse</a>, 
<A HREF="http://www.noaa.gov/">NOAA </a>scientists,
the <A HREF="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/ceosidn/">CEOS IDN</a>, 
and <A HREF="http://spsosun.gsfc.nasa.gov/EOSDIS_main.html">EOSDIS</a>. 
(4) The GCMD staff serves as the maintenace body for Earth science data
set parameter keywords (additions, changes, or deletions) and also serves
as the maintenance body for the Directory Interchange Format standard
through the "Interoperability Forum" from the Home Page, thus contributing
a distinctly valuable service to the Earth science user community.  Other 
<A HREF="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/about_us/accomps.html">
GCMD accomplishments </a> for Fiscal Year 1996 can be viewed.

<P>
The Global Change Master Directory staff plans its work in keeping
to its mission statement; in conjunction with the goals of the interagency 
Global Change Data and Information System (GCDIS), the goals and 
responsibilities as the American Coordinating Node of the Committee 
on Earth Observation Satellites' (CEOS) International Directory 
Network (IDN), and the shared goals with EOSDIS; and in response 
to feedback from the GCMD Science User Working Group.


<br>
<P>

<A NAME="uwg"><h2>GCMD Science User Working Group</h2></A>


<P>
Representing the broad range of Earth science disciplines including life
sciences, oceanography, geophysics, and atmospheric science is an active
GCMD Science User Working Group.  Members have been chosen for their interest
in NASA's directory effort, for their knowledge of available data sets,
for their ability to understand the importance of high quality data
management and the essential aspects of effective searching for the
presence of appropriate data for research.  The current UWG is led by
chairman and USGS scientist, Dr. Lou Steyaert, who concentrates on 
land-atmosphere interactions research and development, and Dr. Dorothy Hall,
who represents NASA/Goddard's Laboratory for Hydrospheric Processes and
does research in the field of ice and snow.  Other members include Dr.
Peter Cornillon, oceanographer from the University of Rhode Island; Dr.
Bernard Minster, geophysicist at the University of California, San Diego;
Dr. John Porter, ecologist at the University of Virginia; Mr. David
McGuirk, atmospheric scientist from NOAA; and CEOS representative, Mr. Terry 
Fisher from the Canadian Centre for Remote Sensing.  The GCMD Science User
Working Group works under the

GCMD Terms of Reference


<p>
I.  Purpose:

<p>
The Global Change Master Directory's User Working Group was formed
to provide consultation on the future direction of the GCMD and
to attain discipline-specific assistance in populating the directory.
The foundation of the work stems from NASA's pioneering efforts
involving online metadata services and interoperability issues.

<p>
All members must understand the importance of high quality data
management and the essential aspects of effective searching
for locating appropriate data for research.  All
members should become frequent users of the GCMD's online system and
provide routine, interactive feedback on the direction for the
GCMD.  All members should share knowledge of known data sources
and expand the network of key contacts providing dataset
descriptions to the GCMD staff, providing timely information
on new data sets.


<p>
II.  Organization:

<p>
There shall be one chairman selected with NASA HQ, GCDC, and Code 900
approval from outside NASA, who will serve for a maximum term of
four years in this position but may serve a total of 6 years on the
committee.

<p>
There shall be one Project Scientist representing Code 900 from Goddard
Space Flight Center, who will serve a maximum term of four years in
this position but may serve a total of 6 years on the committee.

<p>
There shall be one member chosen to represent the CEOS IDN, who may
serve a maximum of 6 years.

<p>
There shall be four additional members chosen to represent major
Earth science disciplines, who represent either Universities, data centers,
or other U.S. Federal agencies and may serve a maximum of six years.

<p>
The GCMD UWG shall meet minimally once each year and no more than
twice each year.  Other urgent matters will be handled through the
Chairman or the Project Scientist via electronic mail and/or
telephone contact.


<p>
III.  Role

<p>
NASA Headquarters determines the total amount of the GCMD
Project budget, and the GCMD Project Manager determines how that
amount will be allocated.  All recommendations by the GCMD UWG
should be directed to the GCMD Project Manager for action.


<p>
IV.  Goals

<p>
The GCMD UWG's ultimate goals are to give scientists confidence
that they can avoid the information maze in their search for Earth
science data set descriptions through the GCMD and to help establish
the GCMD as the premier source of metadata for scientific research,
applications development, and environmental risk assessment within
the academic, government, and private sector communities.  The UWG
hopes that global change scientists, environmental modelers, research
students, applications developers and other users of scientific data
will "think GCMD first" as they begin their research and development.
Expanding the number and quality of the metadata citations in the GCMD
is paramount in meeting these ultimate goals.


<p>
V.  Specific Activities

<p>
+  Review progress on stated ambitions and recommendations.

<p>
+  Provide guidance on the upcoming FY Work Plan.

<p>
+  Assist in assessing the user and data provider trends for GCMD
   constituents.

<p>
+  Help define new directions and assist in setting goals.

<p>
+  Use the UWG multidisciplinary expertise to provide ongoing
   information concerning new data sets, new resources to information
   sources, technological innovations, and other items of interest to
   the appropriate GCMD disciplinary coordinators.

<p>
+  Recommend approaches to enhance the visibility of the GCMD, especially to
   reach new potential users and to obtain their feedback.

<p>
+  Provide guidance on strategies to identify and acquire new
   metadata sources, while also suggesting search scenarios that will
   enhance the user's ability to locate "their data needs" in the GCMD.


<p>
The draft recommendations of the UWG will be integrated into the GCMD's
overall organizational strategy and reflected in the 1997 project
document governing environment information service activities.

<h1>GCMD WWW/Database Interface </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Data set descriptions (DIFs) and Supplementary Information can be retrieved
by using fill-in-the-blank forms to submit database queries. Several fields
are presented and the user may either enter in text or pull up a list of
valid values from which to choose.<p>
Access the GCMD homepage with the URL http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/. Select the 
"Search the Global Change Master Directory" Option on the homepage. This will
retrieve the document query1.html.<p>

<h2>DIF Retrieval </h2>

<ol>
<li> query1.html -- Select the "Forms-based search" for data set descriptions
                 option from this WWW document. 
                 A call will be made to the CGI program MD-main-query.<p>

<li> MD-main-query -- The blank query form is drawn.
                A click on a valids button or the query button (with selection
                criteria filled in form boxes) initiates a call to the CGI
                program MD-form-query.<p>

<li> MD-form-query -- 
               <ol>
               <li>Queries the database for valids and redraws the form
                with the requested valids list displayed.
                A click on a valids button or the query button (with selection
                criteria filled in form boxes) initiates a call to 
                MD-form-query<p>
OR <p>         
                <li>Queries to the database for DIFs based on selection
		criteria filled in the form and returns a list of DIF titles
                (if the selection criteria are met).
                A click on a DIF title initiates a call to getdif.<p>
                </ol>

<li> getdif --  Queries the database for the selected DIF contents and displays
                the DIF information in the format requested. A DIF may also
                have a list of related supplementary information at the 
                bottom. 
                A click on a Supplementary Information title will initiate a
		call to getdif.<p>
</ol>

<h2>Supplementary Information Retrieval </h2>

<ol>
<li> query1.html -- Select the "Forms-based search" for Supplementary Information
                 option from this WWW document. 
                 A link is be made to the WWW document query2.html.<p>

<li> query2.html -- Select from a menu of four types of "Supplementary 
                 Information". 
                 A call is made to the CGI program MD-main-query.<p>

<li> MD-main-query -- A blank query form is drawn, depending on the type of 
                Supplementary Information selected.
                A click on a valids button or the query button (with selection
                criteria filled in form boxes) initiates a call to the CGI 
                program MD-supp-query.<p>

<li> MD-supp-query --
<ol>
               <li>Queries the database for valids and redraws the form
                with the requested valids list displayed.
                A click on a valids button or the query button (with selection
                criteria filled in form boxes) initiates a call to 
                MD-supp-query.<p>
OR <p>         
                <li>Queries to the database for Supplementary Information 
                based on selection criteria filled in the form and returns a 
                list of Supplementary Information titles (if the selection 
                criteria are met). A click on a title initiates a call to 
                getdif.<p>
</ol>
<li> getdif --  Queries the database for the supplementary information and 
                displays it.<p>
</ol>

Queries to the database make use of the GCMD system software libraries 
documented in the GCMD System Documentation and GCMD Programmers API.<p>

NASA GCMD plan for participation in the National Spatial Data Initiative
</title>

<img src="../Images/nsdi.gif">
<h2> GCMD participation in NSDI</h2>

The Global Change Master Directory will participate in the <A HREF="http://fgdc.er.usgs.gov/nsdi2.html">National Spatial
Data Infrastructure</A> by complying with the <A HREF="http://fgdc.er.usgs.gov/metaover2.html">Federal Geographic Data Committe (FGDC)
Metadata Content Standard</A> mandated by Executive Order 12906 signed on April 11,1994.<p>
Compliance includes an option to display dataset information in adherence to 
the FGDC Metadata Content Standard as well as  the establishment of an <A HREF="http://fgdc.er.usgs.gov/fgdc.html">FGDC Clearinghouse node</A>. This means the availability of the 
GCMD metadata on the Internet and the development of a full-text and 
fielded searching method which uses the
<A HREF="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/z3950/zhelp.html">Z39.50</A> (version 2) protocol to query the GCMD. 
To accomplish the display of metadata in compliance with FGDC, there must be a <A HREF="../dif_mapping/fgdc_dif_map5_0.html">
mapping of DIF fields to FGDC fields</A>.
Several new fields have been added to the DIF to facilitate compliance with the
FGDC Metadata Content Standard.<p>

<title> Space Science Transition</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1> Transition of Space Science Descriptions to NSSDC </h1>
<P>
Until 1994 the <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nssdc/nssdc_home.html"> 
National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC)</a> 
was responsible for archiving and distributing both Earth and Space data.  
 One Master Directory contained descriptions of both Earth and Space 
science data.  About that time, a new policy from the Earth Sciences and 
Applications Division at NASA Headquarters divided the responsibility for data 
archiving and management for the Earth and space sciences.
As a consequence, a plan to migrate Earth science data from NSSDC,  
(see the <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/earth/earth_home.html"> 
NSSDC Earth Science Transition Plan</a>) to the <A

Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) </a> was implemented.  As 
part of this transition plan, Earth science data set descriptions were 
scheduled to be held soley by the Global Change Master Directory, while  
space science data set descriptions were scheduled to be held in 
a directory of similar structure at NSSDC called the <A 
HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmd/nmd.html"> NASA Master
Directory (NMD)</a>.  In early 1995, most of the Earth science
descriptions in the NMD were deleted, while the GCMD retained all of
the Space science descriptions (i.e. those directory entries with a Discipline keyword of "Astronomy", 
"Planetary Science", Space Physics", or "Solar Physics") <P> <b> 
However, by October 31, 1995, space science directory entries will be removed from 
the GCMD.</b> 

The following steps are being taken to insure continuity: <P>
<ul>
<li>All directory entries with the Field "Discipline" 
 (see the <A HREF="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/difguide/discipline.html">DIF 
manual</a>) 
keyworded as "Astronomy", "Planetary Science", or "Space Physics" in the GCMD will be 
checked with the contents of the NMD.  Any of those entries not in NMD will be transferred and 
subsequently registered into the NMD. 

<li>The GCMD will retain all "Astronomy", "Planetary Science", and
"Space Physics" entries that ALSO have "Earth Science" Discipline 
keywords.  "Solar Physics" directory entries will be retained in the GCMD 
(and NMD) as these descriptions are important to both the
Earth and solar communities.  

<li> The user will be able to link directly to the NMD from the GCMD upon entering the search page.

<H2>What is a DIF?</H2> <p>

DIF is the acronym for Directory Interchange Format, a de-facto standard
used to create directory entries which describe a group of data.  A DIF
consists of a collection of fields which detail specific information about
the data.  Six fields are required in the DIF; the others expand upon and
clarify the information.  Some of the fields are text fields, others require
the use of valid values.  
<p>

Seven fields have been added to the DIF to facilitate compliance with the
U.S. federally mandated Federal Geographic Data Committee's (FGDC) Content
Standard on Digital Geospatial Metadata.  The new fields will add
information for users to make a better decision on the usefulness of a
dataset.  FGDC is one over several format offerings, to which the DIF may
be mapped: see <a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/dif_mapping/format_options5_0.html">
http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/dif_mapping/format_options5_0.html</a>. 
<P> 

Skinny DIF is a DIF which consists of only the required DIF fields. 
Skinny DIFs are put into a directory to alert users of the existence of a
particular data set, and may be modified at a later time.
<P>

This document provides information about each field of the DIF, including
its syntax, recommendations, and examples.  A DIF example and a DIF
template are also provided.  For a list of software tools which aid in the
writing of DIFs, see <a
href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/software_docs/dif_tools.html">

<title>Tips for DIF Writing</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Tips for DIF Writing</h1>

A key question when writing a DIF is what should be described in a single
entry?  In some cases, a group of data, commonly known as a data set, should
be described by a single DIF.  In other cases, related data may be grouped
together even though they may be identifiable in smaller subsets at the
catalog or inventory level.  However, your determination of the appropriate
group of data to describe should be the primary guideline<P>

All applicable fields for a given data set should be completed.  Some
information may not be available or cannot be recovered, and some fields
do not necessarily apply to every data set.  Other fields are critical
for use in data set selection (<i>i.e.,</i> parameter, time coverage,
discipline) or user understanding of the data (<i>i.e.,</i> summary,
reference).  When the information cannot be obtained or would not make
sense, the field should be omitted.<P>


<h2>Suggestions:</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Data set characteristics that might suggest separate directory entries
may be:

   <UL><LI>a unique sensor/platform/project combination

   <LI>a unique parameter, parameter combination, or set of independent
       variables contained in the data set

   <LI>a unique processing level.
   </UL>

<LI>Data set characteristics that do not indicate a need for separate entries
include:

   <UL><LI>identical data sets available on different media

   <LI>data held at multiple locations, except when significant differences
     exist between the data archived in different places (<i>i.e.,</i> different
     processing algorithms)

   <LI>distinct spatial or temporal resolutions or coverages for a given group
   of data

  <LI>data used for the interpretation or organization of a data set (<i>i.e.,</i>
      map overlays, indices to data), which would not be listed separately but
      which would be mentioned in the summary

Group: Summary
 
This data set contains global SSM/I antenna temperatures (19.0, 22,
and 37 GHz), with derived measurements of water vapor, cloud water,
and wind speed, only over the oceans.  The antenna temperature dataset
is not complete as some channels have been screened according to the
underlying surface classification.  The SSM/I is a seven-channel,
four-frequency, dual-polarized, passive microwave radiometer which
measures the atmospheric, oceanic, and land surface microwave
brightness temperatures at 19.3, 22.2, 37.0 and 85.5 GHz.  The orbit
of the satellite is near- circular, sun-synchronous, and near-polar
with an inclination of 98.8 degrees.  The ascending equatorial
crossing time for the F10 satellite is approximately 7:42 pm local
time.
 
This SSM/I geophysical products data set is produced by Remote Sensing
Systems.  Each logical record corresponds to a single SSM/I scan,
which contains sixty four 25km resolution cells.  Time, latitude, and
longitude are given for the cells.  In addition, for each cell there
is is a surface classification index (e.g., 7-land, 5-sea ice,
0-water) and a set of 5 parameters that correspond to some combination
of antenna temperatures and geophysical parameters.  Land cells are
recorded as antenna temperatures for the SSM/I 19V, 19H, 22V, 37V, and
37H sensors.  Ocean cells are recorded as antenna temperatures for the
SSM/I 19V and 19H, wind speed (W), water vapor content (V), and
cloud/rain liquid water content (L).
 
These data were taken by the SSM/I aboard DMSP F10.

End_Group
</pre>

<h2>Specifications   </h2><P>
<UL>
<LI>May be used as often as necessary
<LI>Each field in the text group may appear only once
<LI>Longitude must be specified in whole degrees, 0-180 east or west of
the Prime Meridian (Greenwich).  The letters E or W should come right
after the number with no space in between.
<LI>Latitude must be specified in whole degrees, 0-90 north or south of
the Equator.  The letters N or S should come right after the number with
no space in between.
</UL>
 
<h2>More Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minimum Altitude = the altitude level which represents the lower 
limit of data coverage
<li>Maximum Altitude = the altitude level which represents the higher 
limit of data coverage
<li>Minimum Depth = the depth level which represents the upper-most depth 
level of data coverage
<li>Maximum Depth = the depth level which represents the lowest depth 
level of data coverage
</ul>

<h2>Recommendations </h2><P>
<ul>
<li>Pay careful attention to coordinates when specifying the bounding box
of the data set.  Remember that the Southernmost_Latitude may be in the
northern hemisphere.  Likewise for the other coordinates:
Northernmost_Latitude may be in the southern hemisphere,
Westernmost_Longitude may be in the eastern hemisphere, and
Easternmost_Longitude may be in the western hemisphere. 
<li>Some examples of altitude and depth units are 'M' (Meters), 'KM'
(Kilometers), 'FT' (Feet), 'SURFACE', 'hPA' (hecto Pascals), and 'MB'
(Millibars).

<h1>Catalog Link</h1>  

<h2>Definition</h2>
Data centers which supply data access via Telnet may use this field to
provide the capability for users to access their data center directly from
the Directory via the LINK command on the classic Curses Client. 

<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre>
Catalog_LINK:
</pre>

<h2>Specifications</h2><P>
<UL>
<LI>The value in this field is a short acronym for the data center.
<LI>DIF writers must notify the GCMD so that the complete Telnet 
information for the data center can be entered into the GCMD 
database.
</UL>

<h2>Recommendations</h2><P>
<UL>
<LI>A short acronym should be used.
<LI>The complete Telnet information is not supplied in the DIF.  The DIF
only contains the acronym for the data center.  When displaying a DIF, the
Curses Client reads the acronym, and then accesses the GCMD database for the
complete Telnet information.  If the user chooses the LINK command, a
Telnet link is established from the Directory to the data center.

<PRE>Group:  Summary
   Seasat was launched on June 28, 1978 carrying a five sensor payload.
   The objective of the Altimeter (ALT) was to determine ocean
   topography with a height measurement precision of 10 cm.  The ALT
   carrier frequency was 13.5 GHz and operated in chirp pulse mode with
   a 3.2 micro-sec uncompressed pulse width and 3.125 ns compressed
   pulse width.  The pulse limited footprint diameter was 1.2 km for
   calm seas; beam-limited footprint diameter was 22.2 km.

   The primary parameters telemetered to the ground processing system at
   10/sec rate were height, significant wave height, and Automatic Gain
   Control (AGC).  The height, described herein, is the sea surface
   height with respect to the reference ellipsoid.  From altimeter
   workshop results, the height measurement bias has been determined as
   0.0 +/- 0.7 m when the sea state bias effects are modeled.

   Height data are available on 1600 or 6250 bpi magnetic tapes for:
   Level 1 Sensor Data Record, Level 1.5 Sensor File and Level 2
   Geophysical Data Record.  Level 2.5 data sets are maintained on-line
   by the NODS archive system.  Full tape copies will be made on
   request. Please specify the period of interest when ordering.  Allow
   1-3 weeks for delivery depending on the order size.

<PRE>Group: Summary
   The Solar and Meteorological Surface Observational Network (SAMSON)
   3-volume CD-ROM set is now available from the National Climatic Data
   Center (NCDC), Asheville, North Carolina. This dataset was developed
   jointly by the NCDC and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
   (NREL), Boulder, Colorado. The 3 CD-ROM's are divided geographically
   into regions (eastern, central, and western U.S.--1 CD-ROM/region),
   and contain hourly solar radiation and meteorological data for the
   period 1961-1990. They encompass 237 National Weather Service (NWS)
   stations in the U.S., along with stations in Guam and Puerto
   Rico. The dataset includes both observational and modelled data. The
   5 solar elements are: extraterrestrial horizontal and
   extraterrestrial direct normal radiation; global; diffuse; and direct
   normal radiation. The 16 meteorological elements are: total and
   opaque sky cover, temperature and dewpoint, relative humidity,
   station pressure, wind direction and speed, visibility, ceiling
   height, present weather, precipitable water, aerosoloptical depth,
   snow depth, days since last snowfall, and hourly precipitation.

   The cost is $100 per region or $300 per 3-volume set.

<title>Chapter1</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Chapter 1: <A NAME="Intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
<h3>1.1 <a name="Back">Background</a></h3>
<p>
The Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) was originally developed in support of the Catalog Interoperability effort (CI).  The CI effort strives to facilitate interactions among science data cataloging systems.  A long term goal of this effort is to provide science users with the ability to find and view information about science data regardless of what data system actually holds the metadata.<p>  

The initial impetus for this activity came from NASA.  However, early in the process it became desirable to include other U.S. government agencies involved in the collection and distribution of data of interest to scientists (e.g., NOAA, USGS, NCAR, etc.).  As a result, representatives from several agencies work together with NASA to further the CI goals.  The work of the CI effort attracted the interest of the international CEOS program, specifically the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites Data Working Group (CEOS-DWG). As a result, CEOS international participants began to attend the CI workshops and interact directly with the CI working group.  
<p>
In the ensuing years, CEOS agreed to sponser an experiement to make available and exchange directory information.  This experiment became what is now refered to as the International Directory Network (IDN).   The GCMD software is installed at numerous sites in the CEOS community and functions as the primary operational component of this directory system.  The CEOS IDN was the first successful experiment in an expanding international cooperative application of interoperability.
<p>
The CI working group targeted directory level metadata as its first attempt to establish interoperation among data systems.  The CI science advisory group determined that directory level metadata should be very broad in its coverage and not extremely detailed. It was felt that directory level metadata should assist a scientist in learning about what data was available for his work. It should also be possible to determine whether a data set was interesting enough that additional specific information should be sought.  Directory level metadata can, therefore, be used to reject a particular entry. However, to fully determine whether the data set located in the directory is of real interest to the scientist, more information about that data set would have to be located at another level of the metadata hierarchy. The directory, therefore, serves to locate data sets of potential interest to the scientist.
<p>
The CI science advisory group authorized its working group to tackle the directory metadata interoperability through two mechanisms:  1) the development of a directory metadata interchange format (DIF); 2) the development of a master directory based on the DIF that would contain data across agencies, disciplines, and international boundaries. 
<p>
The CI working group developed the DIF format during a series of teleconferences and workshops.  The DIF contains the core and most important information which directory level metadata must have to fulfill its purpose as outlined above. The DIF was also provides the syntax and semantics with which data systems would exchange their directory level metadata. The DIF was approved by the CI science advisory group at a CI workshop in 1988. At that time the DIF syntax came under configuration control to ensure continued syntactical and semantic compatibility of all changes.
<p>
Once the initial DIF syntax was developed, the MD development team at the NASA Space Sciences Data Center (NSSDC) at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) began the design and implementation of a master directory based on the DIF syntax. The basic design parameters of the original system were as follows:
<ul>
<li>Because access to the directory was to be over a network via many different types of terminals, character based input/output should be minimized and the use of terminal specific function keys should be avoided.

<li>The interface to the directory must be simple enough that users can use it without requiring detailed written documentation.

<li>The DIF syntax and its controlled list of keywords should form the base of the querying mechanism for the directory.

<li>Users should not be required to learn the data dictionary nor the SQL query language.

<li>The software should be flexible and portable. 

<li>It was allowed to be dependent upon SQL but it should not be dependent upon any particular vendor's relational database system (RDBMS).
<li>The software should be written so as to make movement to differing operating environments possible with a minimum of re-coding.
</ul>
<p>
The original version of the software developed with the above specifications became operational in September 1988 under the VAX VMS environment using a SmartStar database.
<p>
With increases in network performance and connectivity, along with increased hardware capability, it became desirable to evolve the GCMD software functionality.  A client/server architecture was designed and implemented which offers expanded user services and options while fulfilling the basic requirements.  Using the client/server model, the GCMD has been opened to access by alterative systems via independant client implementations.  Currently, the GCMD is operaterational under both the Unix and VMS operating systems with an Oracle database.  
<p>
Continued expansion of the directory into the Earth science community fostered a transfer of the GCMD responsibilities within NASA from the NSSDC to the Global Change Data Center (GCDC).  As such, recent and further developments of the GCMD system are sponsered by the GCDC.
<p>
<h3><a name="Organization">1.2  Organization of the Document</a></h3>
<p>
The MD System Documentation provides an overview of the overall MD system, its component subsystems, and the operating system environment.  The structure of the database and its relationship to the DIF are contained within.
<p>
This document is divided into 10 chapters:  chapter 1 and 2 provide an introduction and overview of the Master Directory system; chapter 3 contains the MD database description and information; chapters 4 though 8 discuss the environments of  the major MD subsystems; chapter 9 lists the MD global environment variables; and chapter 10 contains compilation and linking information for the MD.
<p>
In addition, there are several useful documents which may provide further insight into the Master Directory system.   
<ul>  
<li>The MD <i>Programmer's Guide</i> details the software interaction of several key components of the system.  
<li>The MD <i>Operations Guide</i> directs the usage of the many utilities which aid in the day to day support of the operational MD system.
<li>The MD <i>Users' Guide, Alphanumeric Interface Version 2</i>, provides comprehensive instruction on the functionality of the GCMD clients.  
</ul>
These above-mentioned Guides are only available in hard copy format at this time.

<title>Chapter 2:</title>
</head>
<body>
<A NAME="Client"><h2>Chapter 2:  MD Client/Server Architecture Overview</h2></a>
<p>
The Master Directory query interface has been converted to the client/server architecture.  This architecture divides the MD system into 3 components: client, network, and server.   In this chapter, the word client refers to a MD user interface client.
<p>
The client software interacts with the users and handles interface and presentation of information.  When information is required from the database, the client produces SQL statements and sends them to the database server.  The database server processes the SQL statements with a database product (such as Oracle) and returns the results of queries to the client.  The client and server 'talk' to each other over a network via the TCP/IP protocol.
<p>
Any MD client can connect to any MD server.  This means if one server is down, the user can still use the client software by switching to another database server.  The server is defined by system environment variables that can be set before the start of the client application.  If the database server is in a location that is farther away, the database queries may take longer, but the speed of the user interactions with the local client will remain the same.

<A NAME="Database"><h3>2.1  Database Server</h3></A>
<p>
The Master Directory database server is a connection-based, TCP/IP server.  The server accepts database queries and send results using Berkley TCP/IP sockets.  A log file is maintained of machines that connect to the server. 
<p>
The database queries are in the form of SQL statements or special query commands.  By using a GET command, a client can ask for a formatted section of a DIF or the entire DIF.  By using the formatted sections, a client need not know the SQL statements needed to query for the information. 
<p>
The database servers use the following system variables to set the IP address and port number.  Refer to <A HREF="system9.html">chapter 9</a> for more information on these variables.
<pre>
                     SERVERDOWN
                     SERVHOSTADDR
                     SERVTCPPORT</pre>

<A NAME="Log"><h3>2.2  Log Server</h3></A>
<p>
The log server is used to maintain a record of the use of the MD clients.  The clients send the log file to the log server when the user chooses Quit from the clients.  The log information is stored if the TRACKLOGS variable is <i>set in the client environment</i>.
<p>
The log information stored by the log server is described in <A HREF="system7.html">chapter 7</a> of this document.
<p>
The log servers use the following system variables to set the IP address and port number.  Refer to <A HREF="system9.html">chapter 9</A> for more information on these variables.
<pre>
                     SERVHOSTADDR
                     SERVTCPPORT</pre>
<p>
Please see written documentation for the MD Functional Design Diagram.
<p>
<A NAME="User"><h3>2.3  User Interface Clients</h3></A>
<p>
Different clients can be built to take advantage of terminal characteristics and access the Master Directory database server.  The MD distribution supplies three types of clients: line-oriented, text windows (vt100), and X Window based.  All client programs use the same SQL building and network routines to send SQL queries and receive databse results.  The differences with the clients deal with how the information is displayed to the user.   
<p>
The MD clients and server were written so they could be built into one program and run as a stand-alone application.  When building a client to run stand-alone, the network modules are not included in the executable.  The client is linked directly with the database server and the database product.  The advantage of this arrangement is the application will be faster as interactions with the database will be quicker.
<p>
The clients can be built so they connect to either a local database server and run stand-alone, or another server and run in the client/server mode.  In this case, both the network modules and the database server are built into the client application.  The server is determined by setting the system environment variables.  This situation has the advantage of fast database interactions with the local database product and the ability to connect to distant database servers.
<p>
Client software consists of several distinct layers.  The top-most layer is the interface itself.  This is what the user sees and interacts with by pressing buttons on a keyboard or moving a mouse pointer.  The interface interacts with the memory management layer which holds information like what the user typed and what is displayed on the screen.  The memory manager stores the values needed by the SQL generator and the results from the database server.  At this point, the client consists of the modules needed to interact with the user and the database product.  If the client is built to be able to connect to distant database servers, the network modules are included.  The network modules provide the client with the ability to talk to the database server over the network.
<p>
The database server is also built in layers.  The primary function of the server is to interact directly with the database product.  The servers have the ability to build SQL statements and format the results when the clients ask for preformatted DIF information.  The final layer is the network modules which allow the server to correspond with the clients over the network.
<p>
When the client is built for stand-alone use, the database server is linked directly into the client application.  The network module is no longer necessary in this model as the client and server layers can interact through shared memory space.  If the client application is built is run in stand-alone and in client/server modes, the network module is included, but only used when the application connects to a distant database server.
<p>
All of the Master Directory interface clients share two dictionary files.  All SQL statements used to retrieve information and validate user input is in the file sql.dic.  fields.dic contains definitions for global variables used in the SQL templates and the MD clients.  
<p>
All help files for the clients can be edited to best serve the user community. <p>
The following system environment variables are used to determine what mode the clients will operate in.  Please refer to <A HREF="system9.html">Chapter 9</a> for the definitions of these system variables.
<pre>
                     CLIENTSERVER 
                     SERVHOSTADDR 
                     SERVTCPPORT 	
                     LOGTCPPORT 
                     TRACKLOGS</pre>

<b>MD Classic Client</b>
<p>
The MD Classic client is the original alpha-numeric user interface.  It uses the curses library for its screen layouts and was designed to be used with any terminal that is supported by the system the program is running on.
<p>
The MD Classic client also supports generic TTYs that are not defined in the curses library.  If a terminal type is not recognized, the information will scroll on the users terminal.  No screen positioning or highlighting codes will be used in this mode.  This is the only MD client that supports TTY mode.
<p>
This interface was first released in 1988.  In its original form, the interface was linked directly to the database product.  This application now has the ability to run in either stand-alone or client-server mode.
<p>
<b>MD JAM Client</b>
<p>
The JAM Client is an alpha-numeric windows based application.  This interface provides a windowed interface for the VT series terminals.  Information is displayed in seperate windows and the user is presented with items such as radio buttons and pull-down menus.
<p>
This client was built with a commercial product called JYACC Application Manager (JAM) from JYACC Inc.  JAM was used to build the interface screens and menus.  The screen files are loaded as the user accesses the screen while using the interface.
<p>
The JAM screen files can not be edited without the screen editing tool from JYACC.  This client can not be built from source code without libraries provided by JYACC.  This client has been built for Sun OS, SGI Irix, and VAX VMS and is distributed as an executable.  Since the client cannot be built from source code, this client cannot be linked with a database product and can only run in client-server mode.
<p>
We suggest using a terminal with VT-100 emulation with a seperate Escape key.  This client has the ability to use keyboard short-cuts know as <i>Hot Keys</i>.  Using these keyboard sequences, a user is able to quickly perform commands without using the menu bar.
<p>
<b>MD X Motif Client</b>
<p>
The X Client was created as a result of increasing demand for an X application to access the Master Directory.  This client is very similar to the JAM client in that information is displayed in seperate windows and the user is presented with X widgets such as radio buttons and pull-down menus.
<p>
The X Client does not require special commercial libraies as the JAM Client does.  The source code is available for programmers to compile with the X libraries.  Seperate help files were created to explain the functionality for this client.  As an X application, this client uses several resource files that define the properties of the display widgets.
<p>
This client supports selecting multiple titles from the Query Results screen and two display options for viewing a DIF.  See the Operations Guide for more information about using the special features of this client.
<p>
See written documentation for the Client-Server Interaction diagram.

<A NAME="Data"><h2>Chapter 3:  Database</h2></A>
<p>
The Master Directory uses a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and maintain the DIF entries.  In a relational database, data is stored in tables constructed of one or more columns.  Data is accessed through the use of a database query language.  Using this query language, data may be inserted, updated, deleted, or selected for output.  In addition, data from multiple tables may be logically joined in a query to permit simpler or more complex views of the data.
<p>
Through the loading process, the DIF information is segregated and stored into multiple database tables.  The directory software accesses the database information using the Standard Query Language (SQL).
<p>
<A NAME="Architect"><h3>3.1  Architecture</h3></A>
<p>
<b>DIF Entry Tables</b>
<p>
See written documentation for more information about each of the following tables.
<p>
DC_CONTACT is an associative table intersecting DIF entries and data center personnel information.  The data_center name is used to group the personnel information by data center.  The data_center column in this table matches the data_center column in the DE_CENTER and DE_DATASET tables.
<p>
DE_CONTACT is an associative table which stores the associations between DIF entries and personnel information.  The contact_type indicates the disposition of the personnel attached to the DIF entry (A=author, T=technical contact). 
<p>
DE_CAMPAIGN stores the names of projects and campaigns listed in the DIF entries.
<p>
DE_CENTER contains the names of data centers listed in the DIF entries.  The center_name column in this table matches the center_name column in the DC_CONTACT and DE_DATASETS tables.
<p>

<A NAME="Generation"><h3>3.2  Generation Scripts</h3></A>
<p>
Scripts are available to create the Master Directory database and the tables.   The database creation scripts are located in the directory  /usr/people/oracle7/gcmd of the GCMD machine.  MD table creation and associated scripts for Oracle Version 6 is located in the directory  MDDISK->MDPROD->DBA, whereas the table creation and associated scripts for Oracle Version 7 is located in MDDISK->MDPROD->DBA/v7 directory.
<p>
Please refer to written documentation for more information on MD database creation files.
<A NAME="Server"><h3>3.3  Database Server</h3></A>
<p>
This section briefly discusses the Master Directory database server.  The full documentation for the server including client-server interactions is included in the <i>Programmer's Guide</i>.
<p>
The Master Directory (MD) server provides a generic application program interface (API) for communications between various MD clients and the MD database server.  This API has been developed independent of any one specific relational database product and allows standard SQL statements to be processed.  The server has been implemented to allow two modes of access: <i>batch and interactive</i>.
<p>
When the database server is activated in batch mode, all of the database results from a single SQL command are returned at once.  In this mode, there is no way of interrupting the flow of data being returned from the server.  The client must worry about storing the data that is returned.  Therefore, one must be careful when composing the SQL statements as to expect a certain amount of data.
<p>
With interactive mode, the client controls the flow of data returned from the server and has the ability to stop the query being executed.  The server fills one buffer and waits for another call to fill the next buffer.  Therefore, the client can issue additional server commands between the buffers.  The client also has the ability to execute concurrent queries by specifying SQL commands on different server channels/cursors.
<p>
In addition to any standard SQL statement which may be sent to the MD database server, specialized queries may be issued which return formatted sections of DIF information.  These sections represent a logical partitioning of the DIF information for the purpose of display and reporting.  Each of these sections may be retrieved in batch or interactive mode.  A list of the currently available specialized queries appears at the <A HREF="#example">end of this section</a>.
<p>
<b>Valid Input Commands:</b>
<dl>
<dt><b>Command</b>: OPEN database [mode]
<dd>Opens the database with the given mode.  The mode may be either interactive or batch.  The mode controls how the client and server interact.  If no mode is given, batch mode is assumed.  (In batch mode, all subsequent server commands are processed on a single channel.  The client should not send a channel number with the command as it will be ignored.)
<dt><b>Command</b>: CLOSE
<dd>Closes the connection to the database server.
<dt><b>Command</b>: CANCEL
<dd>Cancels the query on the current channel.  This command is intended as a means to stop the flow of data from the server in interactive mode.  This has no effect in batch mode.
<dt><b>Command</b>: GET section_name
<dd>Gets the specified formatted section from the database server.
<dt><b>Command</b>: any valid SQL statement
<dd>The server will execute any valid SQL statement.
</dl>
<p>
<b>Return Status Code Descriptions:</b>
<p>
The errors a client should expect are:  MD_NORMAL, MD_ENDTAB, MD_CANCEL, MD_NODATABASE, and MD_SYNTAX.  For information on other possible server errors, please refer to the <i>Programmer's Guide</i>.
<p>

<b>Dictionary Files</b>
<p>
The database server requires two dictionary files.  These files provide the server with the formatting and SQL statements needed to generate the formatted DIF sections. These files are located in the dictionary directory defined by the MDDICT system environment variable.
<pre>File                 Function
query.sel            Provides the server with the SQL statements needed for DIF
                     sections
query.fmt            Provides the server with the formatting information needed
                     for DIF sections
</pre>
<b>QUERY.SEL</b>
<p>
This file contains the SQL select statements needed to fill the text for each of the formatted sections.  The default  location for this file is pointed to by MDDICT. 
<p>
This file allows programmers to add values to sections or totally  change  the content.  However, it is imperative that the programmer using correct SQL syntax within the structure of the file.  Failure to do this will almost certainly lead to erroneous results or program crashes.
<p>
Each screen is described by one or more select sections in the QUERY.SEL file.  Each select section is composed of 4 parts:
<p>
<pre>	Section Name
	Processing Information Line
	Select Clause
	Where Clause
</pre>
<p>
<i>Section Name</i> - This is the name of the actual query section available on the database server. There can be any number of select statements for any one section.  However, each select block must always begin with the section name.
<p>
<i>Processing Information Line</i> - This is a line of integers that provides the query system with instructions about how this select statement is to be identified and processed.  Each integer on the line is separated from the next by at least one space.  Each line contains the following information:
<pre>	
QueryID	     An integer uniquely identifying the select.  It must begin at 1
             not 0.  Each QueryID must be one greater than the select preceding             it regardless of the section.  Only one select statement may have
             a particular ID number.
NestFlag     When set to Zero, this integer indicates that this select should
             be completed before the next QueryID is processed.  So, if a query             returns multiple rows, all rows will be retrieved before the next
             query is processed.  If this integer is set to 1, one row from
             this table will be retrieved and then the next QueryID will be
             processed concurrently.  
Level        This integer contains the nesting level.  It is also used as the
             channel with which to query the database.  When one query is 
             nested within another, its level will be one greater than the
             query within which it is nested.  This convention is required and
             ensures that concurrent queries are processed on different 
             channel numbers.  All queries at the same level of nesting will
             have the same channel number.  Level numbers begin at 5.
SeqNo        SeqNo integer is an ordinal at 0 for any particular level.  Each
             additional query at a level will have a SeqNo 1 greater than the
             previous one.  For example, If QueryID 0 has its nest flag set
             and its level would be 5, then QueryID 1 would have a level 6, 
             SeqNo 0.  If its nest flag is not set and there where another 
             select at level 1 then its QueryID would be 2 and SeqNo would be
             1.  The query system would retrieve one row from QueryID 0, then 
             it would retrieve all the rows from QueryID 1.  After retrieving 
             all the rows of QueryID 1, it would retrieve all the rows of 
             QueryID 2 before processing additional at level 1 or returning to
             the next row of level 0.
</pre>
<p>
<i>Select Clause</i> - This contains the select clause of an SQL statement.  The appropriate syntax for the production database must be used otherwise errors will occur.  The select portion also includes the FROM phrase.  The select may contain joins or any other valid SQL technique.  It is also acceptable to use database specific utilities.  However, in the latter case, they would need to be changed, if the production database is changed.
<p>
The select clause is terminated by placing the @ character on a line by itself.
<p>
A select statement may be spread over multiple 80 character lines.  Programmers<b>MUST</b> not use more than 80 characters on a single line.  The query subsystem automatically concatenates the multiple 80 character lines.  Also, the total select and where phrases may <b>NOT</b> exceed the 2000 characters.
<p>
<b><i>Where Clause</i></b> - This part of the SQL statement is optional.  If no where clause need be included in the select statement, then the following syntax does not apply.
<p>
If a WHERE clause is required, the line on which the where appears must have the ~ character in the first column.  Lines may not exceed 80 characters.  The where clause and the select clause combined may <b>NOT</b> exceed 2000 characters.
<p>
The where clause may contain any valid  SQL syntax for where.  When LIKE or  equal (=) is used, values from previous selects may be used on the right side of the LIKE or =.  When using a value from the previous select, the syntax specifies the channel number and buffer position as follows:
<p>
<pre>:6.1  where 6 is the channel number of the query from which the
           value has been retrieved and 1 is the position in the query
           buffer which contains the value.  Since the return buffer
           starts with the server status code, this position value is 
           effectively 1 based.</pre>
<p>
The where clause is ended by placing a ~ character on a line by itself.  This character must appear in the first column of the line.
<p>

<b>QUERY.FMT</b>
<p>
The selection of formatted sections via the database server is flexible and changeable because it is driven by database selection criteria and  formatting instructions contained in external files.  As a result, programmers can easily change the content and format of these selectable sections by editing these external files.
<p>
Programmers <i>must</i> be absolutely certain that they understand both the format used in creating the file and the purpose of all the fields and lines in the format file.  Incorrect modifications will almost certainly lead to serious problems and perhaps crashes of the database server.
<p>
Each data item to be placed in a formatted section is described by four lines in the format file.  The values required on each line are:
<p>
<pre>
			     <b>LINE 1</b>

QueryID      Number of the select statement providing the data. <b>This is 
             one-based.</b>

PromptIndent Provides the number of spaces to indent before the prompt text is
             displayed.

SameLine     A 1 indicates that the prompt appears on the same line as the 
             data value specified in line 2.  A newline is not printed.  A 0
             indicates that the data value will be placed on the next line 
             therefore a newline is printed.

RepeatPrompt A 1 indicates that the prompt should be repeated for each data
             value retrieved from the database.  The prompt string will be
             printed followed by the data value.  A 0 indicates that the
             prompt should appear only with the first value but not be
             repeated with subsequent values.

Multiple     A 1 indicates that the next data item is to be linked with the
             current item.  A 0 indicates that the data item is formatted 
             individually.

VarSize      The number of characters that should be used in printing a
             database value.  If the value is smaller than the number, it will
             be padded on the right with spaces.  If the data value is larger
             than the number, it will be truncated on the right.

Indent       The number of spaces to indent before the data value is printed.

PrintBlanks  A 1 is used to specify that blank values returned by the database
             query must be included in the formatted section.  A 0 instructs
             the formatter to ignore blank values.

WrapLines    The column number at which the wrapped text will begin on the 2nd
             - nth line of the data item.  This is a 1 based value.  Therefore
             a 0 is used to specify that the formatted line should be 
             truncated to 80 characters.</pre>
				
                             <b>LINE 2</b>
<pre>
Line 2 contains the prompt text string to be used for the data item.  This can be a space or a newline if no prompt text is desired with the data item.  Using the "\" character within the prompt string will force a newline to be printed each time the prompt string is used.</pre>

                            <b>LINE 3</b>
<pre>
VarName    The channel number and buffer position of the value to be printed.
           Since each line of query results buffers always starts with the
           server status code, the buffer position is effectively 1 base.  
           The channel number must match the channel number specified by the 
           select statement in the query.sel file.  The syntax of VarName is
           channel_no.buffer_position (i.e., 6.2).
<p>
VarSuffix  A suffix to be added to the data value (e.g.  km, mi, etc.) This
           value must be preceded by at least one space.</pre>

<b>LINE 4</b>
<pre>
This line contains a concatenation  string to be used when the multiple flag is set.  This string will appear between the value from this description and the next item.</pre>

<b>Database Server Environment</b>
<p>
The following symbols must be set in the operating environment either in a header file or at the command line before activation of either the database server or a client program.
<pre>
SERVHOSTADDR   the IP address of the MD server platform. Currently, the MD 
               server is residing on a SGI machine address 192.107.190.77
SERVTCPPORT    the designated port number that will accept connection requests
               from MD clients.  Currently this is set to 5502.
DATABASE       the MD database which one intends to access.
</pre>

<b>Other Issues:</b>
<p>
The MD server will close the connection and exit within a specified time, if no information is available to be read from the client.  Currently, the server waiting time is set to 20 minutes.  A new connection should be established before a new query is sent to the server if the time between queries exceeds the wait time specified. If Network_Request() is used as the main client driver to access the MD server, the reconnection process will be done automatically.  There is a similar timeout flag that a client program can specify for MD server results as well.

<A NAME="Interface"><h2>Chapter 4:  User Interface Clients</h2></A>
<p>
<A NAME="Introduction"><h3>4.1  Introduction</h3></A>
<p>
There are three MD user interface clients.  Each client supports different terminal characteristics:  line-oriented, text window based, and X Window based.  
<p>
All of the Master Directory user interfaces have been built using the client/server archetecture.  The interactions of the different clients with the database server are the same.  For more information on the client/server protocol, see the <A HREF="system3.html">Chapter 3</A> of this document and the <i>Programmer's Guide</i>.
<p>
<b>External Files</b>
<p>
The MD was designed to be as flexible as possible.  One aspect of this design decision was to be able to modify many of the features of the system without changing the source code, re-compiling and re-linking.   This flexibility was implemented using a dictionary driven approach.  These dictionaries are implemented using external binary and text files.
<p>
All of the user interface clients use the same external dictionary files for formulating the SQL statements to send to the database server.  These files are sql.dic and fields.dic in the dictionary directory defined by the MDDICT system evironment variable.  For more information about these files, see the <i>Programmers</i> API document.
<p>
Specific dictionary files required for each type of client is discussed under each individual client section.
Each file description will contain a brief statement of its purpose, its layout and its location in the logical directory hierarchy.  The logical hierarchy designation will use the following syntax: each level of the hierarchy will be separated from its sublevel by the -> operator (example: MDDISK->MDPROD->DICTIONARY). This approach is used rather than using the specific syntax for directories for any particular operating system because the MD uses the same name for its hierarchy whether in the UNIX or VMS version.
<p>
<A NAME="Curses"><h3>4.2  Curses Client -- MD Classic</h3></A>
<p>
The curses client uses a handful of external files allowing for a great deal of flexibility.  These files allow the following items to be changed without needing to modify the source code:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Menu format and valid commands for form
<li>Menu and form calling sequence
<li>Form layout and valid commands for forms
<li>Change help files for menu options and form fields
<li>Change the name of commands used to execute MD actions
<li>Specify display attributes for commands when using certain terminals
<li>Change the content and names of help files
<li>Provide a bulletin message during the initialization
</ul>
<p>
<b>Free Text Files</b>
<p>
Free text files are used to display text directly from the file into the MD Classic client. Users may arrange text in the file in any manner they wish.
<p>
<b>BULLETIN.TXT</b>
<p>
This file contains the entry level text data displayed just after the user has logged in.  The file has two basic purposes:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Provide a bulletin board feature where the operations staff can insert appropriate and timely information.
<p>
<li>Provide something for the user to read while the initialization process is being executed.
</ol>
<p>
This file has one format restriction -- it may not contain more than 16 text lines of 78 characters each. 
The text may be arranged in any manner.
<p>
<b>*.HLP</b>
<p>
Files containing the suffix '.HLP' denote that they are text files used to display on-line help.  Users may include as many lines as they desire.  They may also arrange the text in any way they feel is appropriate for providing the best help on the designated field, screen, or selection option.
<p>
Help text files are topically oriented. Their names are entered in the appropriate menu text file or form text file.  Names entered in this feature may even use a different suffix. However, help for the MD commands assumes that the name of the help text file will be composed of the suffix '.HLP' concatenated to the name of the command (for example, if the command is exit, then it is assumed that the help text will appear in the file named -- EXIT.HLP).
<p>
Help text files are located in the directory defined by the MDHELP system environment variable.  Normally, this variable points to the MDDISK->MDPROD->HELP->CURSES directory.
<p>
<b>Fixed Format Files</b>
<p>
These files provide the basic dictionary files for the MD Classic client.  Some are text files which are used directly by the system in its display and command segment. Others are text files which are transformed by utilities into binary files of structures which are then read into internal buffers.
<p>
Readers are directed to the header files SCRNBUFTYPE.H, and DISPLAYBUF.H.  These contain the definition of the structure type used.
<p>
These files are located in the MDDISK->MDPROD->DICTIONARY directory.
<p>
<b>COMMANDS.DEF</b>
<p>
The MD Classic client was designed to avoid too much hardcoding into the software itself.  This was as true about the names to be used for certain actions as it was for the content of menus and forms.  As a result, the functionality provided by a command was established by the use of an enumerated type. This external file ties the user designated name to the MD command functionality.  The file also allows the user to specify what display attribute should be used for the command text.
<p>
There are three basic groups of commands:  Paging commands, screen movement commands, and execution commands.  Individual commands within each of these groups was assigned an enumerated type. The following listing lists the command function and its enumerated type sequence number.
<p>
Paging Commands: These allow movement through multiple pages of text for a single screen.
<p>
<pre>Command Function		     Default Name		Enum No
<p>	
	Display the Next Page		  NEXT			9
	Display the Previous Page	  PREV			4
	Display the page number listed	  PAGE			3
</pre>
<p>
Screen Movement Commands: These allow movement from one screen to another.
<p>
<pre>Command Function		     Default Name		Enum No	
<p>
Goto to the screen listed with command	  DISPLAY		2
Exiting from one level to level above	  EXIT			0
Going to the Main menu from anywhere	  MAIN			10
Go to the search selection screen	  SEARCHSEL		12
Go to the supplement screen		  SUPPLEMENT		13
</pre>
<p>
Execution Commands: These cause the MD to activate a designated function.
<p>
<pre>Command Function		     Default Name		Enum No
<p>	
Activate the comment system		COMMENTS		14
Get help for the designated option	HELP			 5
Activate an automated link		LINK			 8
Special system activation		MD			15
Leave the MD system			QUIT_MD			 6
Repaint the screen			REFRESH			11
Start a search of the database		SEARCH			 1
Move from form field to command line	.		         8
</pre>
<p>
A new name is assigned to a command by replacing the default name with the one that the user desires.
<p>
This file also contains a character indicating the display attribute desired for that command. The following display attributes are currently supported:
<pre>A	all attributes together
B	bold
N	normal video attribute (white on black in monochrome)
R	reverse video attribute (black on white in monochrome)
U	underline
</pre>
<p>
<b>FORMS.DEF</b>
<p>
The form definitions file, FORM.DEF, in the MD system is used to define and modify the forms for the MD Classic client.  Once this text file has been created or modified, it is used to generate the FORMS.DIC and MD.DIC dictionary files.
<p>
The content of the forms definition file specifies all aspects of the user interface for each form.  Titles, commands, fields, and database associations are included in the definitions.  All of the MD Classic query forms and display forms are included in FORMS.DEF.  Below is a description of the individual text blocks which comprise a form definition.   
<p>
The <b>TITLE</b> block is used to specify the content of the titles window on the display screen.  Titles may be up to three lines in length.
<p>
The <b>COMMAND</b> block is filled with all of the commands which will be available on the form plus the desired command prompt.  Each command definition begins with a "-C" and must include the command token id, the command help filename, and the command text for the display.  The command prompt specification begins with "-T" and includes the line number in the command window at which the prompt will appear and the text for the prompt.
<p>
The <b>DISPLAY</b> block contains the field specifications.  Each field may have up to two header lines in addition to a prompt.  The field specifications must be listed in this block in the order in which they should appear on the screen.
<p>
Each field definition in the display block begins with a "-F".  In order of appearance on the definition line following items must be included:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Field Type
<li>Display Window Line Number
<li>Display Window Column Number
<li>Field Input Size
<li>Field Token ID
<li>Field Helpfile name
<li>Database Table
<li>Database Column
</ul>
<p>
The header lines (if any) for each field should be listed directly before the appropriate field.  Each header line begins with a "-H" and includes the display window row number and the header text.  The prompt text definition begins with "-T" and must appear directly below each field definition line.
<p>
<b>FORMS.DIC</b>
<p>	
This file is the binary file of screenbuffer structures created from processing the FORMS.DEF file.  In essence, a utility reads the text forms definition file and puts the data into the appropriate buffer structure and then writes it to this external binary file.
<p>
The structure type used for the buffer is defined in the header file scrnbuf.h
<p>
<b>MD.DIC</b>
<p>
This is the binary dictionary file which combines the forms.dic and the menu.dic files. This is the actual file used by the MD Classic client to determine the content of the menu and forms screens.  The MD system contains a utility which combines these two binary files and creates a text file (mddic.rec) which lists the name of the screen and its relative position in the combined binary file.<p>
The structure type used for the buffer is defined in the header file scrnbuf.h
<p>
<b>MDDIC.REC</b>
<p>
This text file is created by the utility which mergers the forms and menu dictionary files into a single binary file.  On each line, this file contains the name of a screen and its relative record number within the binary dictionary file.
<ul>
<li>ScreenName1  RecordNumber1
<li>ScreenName2  RecordNumber2
</ul>
The basic purpose of this file is to provide an index into the binary dictionary file so that the MD Classic query software can quickly locate the values of a single screen used in its system.
<p>
<b>MDDIC.SRT</b>
<p>
This text file has the same format and content as MDDIC.REC.  However, the operating system SORT utility has been used on MDDIC.REC to produce MDDIC.SRT.  This file contains the data sorted in ascending order of screen name.
<p>
This sort by screen name allows the MD Classic query software to use a binary search to locate the screen name and then obtain the relative record location within the binary file. Using this relative record location the software locates the appropriate screen buffer in the vector of screen buffer structures read in during the initialization process.
<p>
<b>MENU.DIC</b>
<p>
This file is the binary file of screenbuffer structures created from processing the MENUNAME.M files.  In essence, a utility reads the menu text file, puts the data into the appropriate buffer structure, and then writes it to this external binary file. 
<p>
All menus are described in separate MENUNAME.M file.  However, the utility which scans these ".M" files appends them into this single binary file.  The buffer structure is the same as that used for forms.  
<p>
The structure type used for the buffer is defined in the header file scrnbuf.h
<p>
<b>MENUNAME.M</b>
<p>
The menu text files are used to define the user interface menus for the MD Classic client.  They are essentially fixed format text files. Each of these files contains the complete definition for a single menu.  Special utility software is provided which translates the menu text files and produces the MENU.DIC dictionary file.  
<p>
The basic format of this file is as follows:
<ol>
<li>up to 2 78 character lines of text entered exactly as you wish them to appear on the screen.
<li>two hyphens (--) to denote separation between the title window and the text window.
<li>The name of the menu or form screen inside curly braces, the text entered as you wish it to appear on that line, the name of the help file for that option inside curly braces.
<li>two hyphens (--) to denote separation between the text window and the command window.
<li>up to 2 78 character lines of text entered exactly as you wish them to appear on the screen.
</ol>
<p>
A menu is defined in three sections; one for the titles window; one for the display window, and one for the command window.  Each block is separated from the other by a line containing two dashes, "--".  Each of these blocks is described briefly below.  
<p>
The <b>TITLES</b> block contains text for the titles window.  Up to three lines may be specified in the title of a menu.
<p>
The <b>DISPLAY</b> block is used to specify all of the options which are available from this menu.  Each option definition includes; the screen token for the menu or form which will appear when this option is selected; the text for the option, and the help filename.
<p>
The <b>COMMAND</b> block contains the text for the command window.  Each command must be listed and separated with commas.  The command window is limited to two lines; the available commands are listed on the first line, and the command prompt appears on the second.
<p>
<b>MENUCONTROL.DIC</b>
<p>
This file provides menu and form activation control information for the menuhandler functions.  Each screen in the MD Classic client is listed on a separate line for each of the main menu screen. Each line has the following format.
<p>
PathNo  ScreenName  LevelNo  SequenceNo  Multiple  Resetform   Selection  QueryID

The purpose of these values are as follows:
<pre><b>Value                          Purpose</b>
PathNo                 Number corresponding to an option number on the main
                       menu.
ScreenName             The name of the screen to which the data pertains.
LevelNo                Number representing the screen hierarchy in a
                       particular path. 
SeqNo                  Number representing the sequence of the screen for a
                       particular level. At any level it is possible to have
                       many screens which should be displayed in sequence.
Multiple               Boolean flag indicating whether or not multiple options
                       may be selected on the corresponding menu; a value of
                       1 is True.
ResetForm              Boolean flag indicating whether or not a form in the
                       path should be built using the option number from a
                       search selection menu; a value of 1 is True.
Selection              Boolean flag indicating that the corresponding form is
                       associated with a search selection menu and is 
                       therefore dynamically created; a value of 1 is True.
Queryid                Token representing the type of query to be performed
                       when filling the corresponding screen. 
</pre>

Each of these variables are part of the MENUCONTROL structure described in scrnbuf.h.

<A NAME="Jam"><h3>4.3 JAM Client</h3></A>
<p>
The MD JAM client is a text-windows based client.  It provides a windows look and feel while still being a character based client.  It requires the use of a terminal with VT-100 emulation. 
<p>
<b>Text Files</b>
<p>
<i><b>Help Files</b></i>
<p>
The JAM client allows the operations staff to change the help and bulletin text files.  These files are located in the MDDISK->MDPROD->HELP->JAM directory.
<p>
The following table describes the various text files:
<pre><b>File Name       Function</b>
*.hlp           Help file for a particular screen
bulletin.hlp    Bulletin text for the client
support.hlp     User support information
tutorial.hlp    Full tutorial explaining how to use the JAM client
</pre>
<p>
The first text line in the help files is used as the title of the help window when it is displayed to the user.  The help screens on the JAM client are designed for 40 column text.  The help function will read lines of a maximum length of 80 characters and format them to the help screen width.  The tutorial screen for the JAM client is designed to display 78 columns.
<p>
The following text is the help text for the Data Center display screen for the JAM client.
                <pre>                DATA CENTER WINDOW
                This information includes the name of
                each archive at which the data set is
                held, and a contact name, address, phone
                number and electronic mail information.
                Data set identifiers used by each data
                center may also be listed.</pre>
<p>
<i><b>Link Files</b></i>
<p>
A link file contains a login procedure to connect to a remote data system.  To associate a DIF or a data center description to a data system, a login procedure file must first be written and placed in the specified link directory.  The user can then use the link utlility to add the link association to the MD database.  Please refer to the <i>GCMD Operations Guide</i> on how to use the link utlity.  Because the JAM client is residing in a Unix platform, the login procedure must contain internet-based access procedure.  The most common remote login commands used in the link scripts are telnet and rlogin.  The link files for the JAM client are located in the directory pointed to by the environment symbol MDLINK.  The link files for the JAM client are currently located in the /usr/people/mdprod/clib/jam directory.
<p>
<b>Binary Files</b>
<p>
The MD JAM client was developed using the JYACC Application Manager.  The JAM application was used to design the text windows and the objects such as the menu bar and push buttons for each screen.  The JAM application creates binary files with the screen information for the client to read at run-time.  These files cannot be edited.  The screen files are located in the MDDISK->MDPROD->CLIENT->JAM directory.
<p>
The JAM client requires five binary dictionary files.  These files contain interface messages and terminal emulation sequences.  These files cannot be edited.  The screen files are located in the dictionary directory pointed to by the MDDICT system environment variable (usually MDDISK->MDPROD->DICTIONARY).
<p>
<pre><b>File Name           Function</b>
jam.lib             Run-time library
msgs.bin            Interface messages
pckeys.bin          MD keyboard mapping 
smvars.bin          JAM system wide function key definitions 
vt100vid.bin        Terminal emulation
</pre>
<A NAME="Window"><h3>4.4  X Window Client</h3></A>
<p>
The X Window client is self contained in that there are no binary files needed to execute the client.  
<p>
<b>Text Files</b>
<p>
<i><b>Help Files</b></i>
The X Window client allows the operations staff to change the help and bulletin text files.  These files are located in the MDDISK->MDPROD->HELP->XW directory.
<p>
The following table describes the various text files:
<pre>
<b>File Name              Function</b>
*.hlp                  Help file for a particular screen or field
bulletin.hlp           Bulletin text for the client
support.hlp            User support information 
tutorial.hlp           Short tutorial explaining the X client 
</pre>
<p>
The first text line in the help files is used as the title of the help window when it is displayed to the user.  The help screens on the X Window client were built to be used with a proportional-spaced font with a width of about 40 characters.  The help screens can be resized by the user to be any width.  The help function will read lines of a maximum length of 80 characters and format them to the help screen width.  The tutorial screen for the X Window client is no different from the other help screens.
<p>
See the help file information for the JAM client to see an example of help text.
<p>
<i><b>MD X Resource files</b></i>
<p>
The resource files contain attribute definitions for the X client.  These files are in the MDDISK->MDPROD-> CLIENT->RESOURCE directory.  The settings within these files have been set to work with the X client and should not need to be changed.
<p>
The resource files are added to the X resource server before executing the X client.  The .mdxrc file in the MDDISK->MDPROD directory will load the necessary resource files to the X server.
<p>
<i><b>Link Files</b></i>
<p>
A link file contains a login procedure to connect to a remote data system.  To associate a DIF or a data center description to a data system, a login procedure file must first be written and placed in the specified link directory.  The user can then use the link utlility to add the link association to the MD database.  Please refer to the <i>GCMD Operations Guide</i> on how to use the link utlity.  Because the X client is residing in a Unix platform, the login procedure must contain internet-based access procedure.  The link script for the X client contains an xterm command to open a local xterm session in addition to either the telnet or rlogin command..  The link files for the X client are located in the directory pointed to by the environment symbol MDLINK.

<A NAME="Usage"><h2>Chapter 5:  Usage Tracking</h2></A>
<p>
This chapter describes valid input buffers that may be sent to the MD log server.  The current design of the log server is such that it does not perform an interactive dialog with the clients.  The communication between the log client and the MD log server is thus one-way.  In the current implementation, the log server expects one or more buffers to be written to the stream.  After receiving a buffer, the log server either writes it to a log file or a comments file.  The log server does not send any status back to the socket stream.  This may change in the future.
<p>
<A NAME="Input"><h3>5.1  Input Format Specifications</h3></A>
<p>
The format of the input buffer to the log server is as follows:
<ul>
<li>the input buffer must start and end with a tilde (~). 
<li>the content of the input buffer must be Null terminated following the last tilde.
<li>the first field must contain one of the valid keywords to indicate the type of information that is being sent to the log server.
<li>a second valid keyword must be used for the keyword <i>userlog</i> buffers.
<li>the fields following valid keywords will be recorded in either the comments or the user log file.
</ul>
Valid first field keywords:
<p>
<pre>
comments   indicates to the log server that the current buffer sent contains
           comments information
userlog    indicates to the log server that the current buffer sent contains
           either the header information or the user activities information.
close      request the log server to exit the current connection.
</pre>
<p>
Valid second field keywords: (userlog activities only)
<pre>
header     indicates to the log server that the current buffer sent contains
           only header information
logfile    indicates to the log server that the current buffer sent contains
           the activities of a full user session
</pre>
<p>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>~comments~user comments can be sent via the keyword 'comments' on the first field of the input buffer to the log server~tildes can be used to separate lines in the comments file~ this is the last line of user comments~(null terminator)
<li>~close~
<li>~userlog~header~header information only~(null terminator)
<li>~userlog~logfile~contains the user activities of a user session~(null terminator)
</ul>
<A NAME="Master"><h3>5.2  Master Directory User Logs</h3></A>
<p>
The Log file is a temporary file created on the client every time a session starts.  This file contains all the user activities during an MD session.  At the end of the session, the file is sent to the server and then it is removed from the client.  The new file is located on the gcmd mdprod/sqllog directory where eventually it will be loaded into the user_log and md_session database tables.
<p>
The format of the file is basically three types of lines:  introductory, sequence, and closing.  Each field on each line is separated by a "~".
<p>
The introductory lines contain the information that will be used to load the md_session table and it has the form:
<pre>
<b>Fields              Meaning</b>
session_id          the session id
table_name          name of database table where line fields should go 
                    (first line should be md_session table)
user_id             the user id
date                date when session took place
begin_time          time when session started 
login_name          login name from host
system_node         system node
user_node           user node (this could be the ip address)
terminal            terminal type
client              client type (valid values are X, JAM, or CURSES)
</pre>
<p>
<pre>
Example:
	~22485743~md_session~224~1992-10-15~18:08:22~Node~vt100~JAM~

	A user_id with value -1 means that the user was a guest.
	The session id starts with the same values of the user id.
</pre>
<p>
The sequence lines contain the information needed to load the user_log table with the user activities that need to be tracked in MD2.  These lines have the form:
<pre>
	table_name	name of database table where line fields
			should go (on middle lines should be user_log
			table)
	user_id	        user id
	time		time when activity took place
	instruction	activity of user
	screen_name	name of screen where activity took place
	type		command type for activity
	sequence	sequence of activity within the session
Example:
	~user_log~224~18:08:33~OK~SEARCHSEL~1~3~

	A user_id with value -1 means that the user was a guest.

	The values for type are 0 through 6.

	Type 0		Begin session
      			Indicates user initial login.

	Type 1		Button command
			The user issues this command by hitting a button at
                        the bottom of a screen.

	Type 2		Hot key command
			The user issues this command by entering a hot key
                        such as ESC b.

	Type 3		Menu choice command
			The user issues this command by selecting one option
                        on a menu.

	Type 4		Results or errors
			This command is issued when the system issues returns 
                        a result.

	Type 5		Value entered
			The user issues this command by entering a value on a
                        screen.

	Type 6		Error
			This command is issued when the system 
			issues an error
</pre>
<p>
The closing line contains information needed to update the md_session table with the time when the session ended.  The form of this line is:
<p>
<pre>
<b>Fields             Meaning</b>
table_name         name of database table where line fields should go (on
                   last line should be md_session table)
user_id            user id
date               date session took place
end_time           time when session ended
session_depth      depth of session

Example:
	~md_session~224~1992-10-15~18:09:24~.2.S..~

	A user_id with value -1 means that the user was a guest.

<A NAME="Extractor"><h2>Chapter 6:  DIF Extractor</h2></A>
<p>
<A NAME="Overview"><h3>6.1  Overview</h3></A>
<p>
The MD extraction subsystem provides the operational staff the ability to extract data from the various MD tables into external files for printing or editing.  The extractor subsystem provides three major types of output:
<ol>
<li>an MD entry is output in full DIF syntax.  
<li>an MD entry is output in a "pretty printed" format rather than in a DIF format. This pretty printed format provides headers for the individual sections and then lists the values for that section.  It does not have the Group syntax or keyword=value syntax.  This style is very suitable for printing.
<li>a number of MD entry titles with some additionally selected MD fields can be extracted into a "titles" report.
</ol>
<p>
The user interface of the extractor a slightly modified version of the MD Classic interface.  The user views provide two additional query attributes: the Entry ID and the Author.  Users may also preselect the entries which they want extracted. 
<p>
<A NAME="External"><h3>6.2  External Files</h3></A>
<p>
<b>Dictionary Files</b>
<p>
The extraction subsystem uses the same type of files as the MD Classic client.  Therefore, the forms, menus, commands, and menu control files are based on the external files used by the MD Classic client.  While the content is different for these files, their format is the same.  See section 4.2 of this document for detailed information on these files. 
<p>
The dictionary files for this software are located in the directory:  MDDISK->MDPROD->DICTIONARY-> EXTRACT.  
<p>
<b>Output Files</b>
<p>
Users may specify the name of an output file which is then an additional external file used in the extraction subsystem that is not used in the MD Classic query subsystem.  If no name is given, a default name of 'extract' is given.  The extension for the file is determined by the type of information extracted.  The following table explains the possible extensions:
<pre>
<b>Extension         Information Type</b>
.camp             Project/Campaign supplementary information
.dc               Data Center supplementary information
.dif              DIF information
.source           Source supplementary information
.sensor           Sensor supplementary information
</pre>

This file will be placed in the user's current directory.
<p>
<b>Help Files</b>
<p>
Help files for the extractor subsystem are located in the same directory as those for the MD Classic client query subsystem.  See section 4.2 of this document for more information on the help files.
<p>
<b>Executable files</b>
<p>
The extractor subsystem is made up of Borne shell script and program executable files.  The following table describes the files of this subsystem:
<p>
<pre>
<b>File Name        Function</b>
extdif           Extractor Menu shell script for DIF format output
extmain          Extractor program executable
ppdif            Extractor Menu shell script for Pretty Print output
preselect        Preselector program executable
sepdifs          Program to separate DIFs into different files

<A NAME="Loader"><h2>Chapter 7:  DIF Loader</h2></A>
<p>
<A NAME="Over"><h3>7.1  Overview</h3></A>
<p>
The main function of the loader is to translate a DIF text file into ANSI standard SQL statements that can then be used to enter the information into the database.  This is accomplished by comparing the DIF file to a syntax dictionary and verifying the DIF values with values already in the database.
<p>
The loader validates fields and creates insert statements one DIF at a time.  As the loader comes across a DIF, it is scanned to allow for random access into the DIF file.  Each line in the DIF is read, parsed, and validated.  The parser copies the DIF values into Field IDs.  With the values in Field IDs, validation SQL statements are generated and sent to the database.  The loader makes one complete pass over the DIF to validate the entire DIF before insert statements are created.
<p>
If the DIF is valid, SQL insert statements may be generated.  The DIF is read again and copied into Field IDs.  The values are then used to create the SQL insert statements.
<p>
The actual insertion of DIFs into the database is done by activating the SQL interpreter for the particular RDBMS being used with the SQL file generated by the loader.
<p>
The loader interacts with the user through a curses based interface.  If there is an error within the DIF, a panel will appear on the terminal screen indicating what the problem is and present options to the user.  The user can choose to accept a value that failed validation (thus making the value valid for all future DIFs), delete an older copy of a DIF from the database and insert the newer version, and add fields and groups that are not defined in the DIF manual to the database.
<p>
The loader can produce a log file for each DIF file processed.  The log file retains any errors and parsing messages  encountered in the DIF file.  The amount of information put into the log file is defined by a command line argument.  The logged information can range from being very brief to very annoying.
<p>
The loader will process multiple DIFs in a single file.  The only requirement is that the DIF label Entry_ID must be the first DIF label for each DIF.  The loader will load Data Set DIFs as well as Supplementary Information on Data Centers, Projects and Campaigns, Sources, and Sensors.
<p>
<A NAME="Running"><h3>7.2  Running the Loader</h3></A>
<b>Command Line Arguments</b>
<pre>loader [-bdsvx] [-D#] [-lfile] dif_file

Arguments		Description

b		Turn off terminal beep.  The default action is for the
                terminal to beep when there is input required by the user. 
                The terminal beep is not available on the VAX systems.

d		Use defaults.  Do not prompt the user for input.  Use the
                default option for each prompt.  Using this mode is comparable
                to the silent mode except the progress of the DIF parsing
		is displayed on the terminal.

s		Silent mode.  Do not display any indication of the progress of
                the DIF parsing.  Uses the default options for all user
                prompts.  Useful when loader is run in the background.

v		Validate only.  Do not attempt to create SQL statements to
                insert the DIF.  This is useful for syntax checking and field
                validation.

x		Auto delete.  Do not ask if the DIF should be removed from the
                database.  This option should be used with care.

D#		Debug level.  Determines the level of output in the log file.
                The numbers can range from 0 (debugging off) to 5 (annoying).
                The default level is 1.

dif_file	The file with the DIFs to process.
</pre>
<b>Environment Variables</b>
<p>
The loader relies on several system environment variables to locate files.
<pre><b>Variable   Explanation                     Value</b>
MDDICT    Location of all dictionary files $MDDISK->$MDPROD->dictionary->loader
LDROUT    Location of SQL and log files    $MDDISK->$MDPROD->loader->dbl
</pre>
<p>
If the loader is to be executed as a client to a remote database server, the following environment variables must also be set:
<pre><b>Environment Symbol         Description                       Value</b>
CLIENTSERVER               Client-Server switch              1
SERVHOSTADDR               Internet address of remote server 192.107.190.77
SERVTCPPORT	           TCP/IP port number                5504
</pre>
<A NAME="Messages"><h3>7.3 Messages Encountered While Loading</h3></A>
<p>
<b>Prompts</b>
<p>
The loader will offer the user the following options when an error panel pops up.  The default option appears in square brackets ([ ]).  The Quit option is available on all prompts.
<p>
Each prompt can be associated with several types of error messages.  The error messages are described on the next page.
<p>
<pre><b>Prompt                         Meaning</b>
Accept, Reject, Quit [R]       A DIF label was not recognized or the value
                               failed validation.  This is normally due to a
                               misspelling of the label or value.
                               Accept-Insert the label/value into the database.
                               Reject-Do not allow this label/value.  The DIF
                               will fail validation.
Skip, Delete and reload, Quit  A duplicate DIF was found in the database.  
                               This occurs when the Originating Center and
                               Entry ID are the same for a DIF in the database
                               and the DIF the user is trying to load.
                               Skip-Do not create insert statements for this
                               DIF.
                               Delete-Create delete statements to remove the
                               DIF from the database and then insert
                               statements to add the new DIF to the database.
Continue, Quit [C]             This prompt occurs when the DIF can not be
                               inserted into the database. Continue-Continue
                               processing other DIFs in file.
Ok, Cancel [Ok]                Used for warnings. OK-Continue processing DIFs.
Press Return                   Used to indicate something to the user.  This
                               may be due to an invalid field that requires
                               the DIF to be edited.
</pre>
<b>Error Messages</b>
<pre>Example Message:			Meaning

                                        by using the Accept command.  However,
                                        in most cases, the label is incorrect
                                        and should be be rejected.  Check the

                                        as a keyword.

EMAIL failed validation (email.network) The given network type is either
EMAIL: intnet>user@machine...           misspelled or needs to be added to the
                                        control list.  In this example, the
                                        network type should be 'internet'.
                                        If the network type in the DIF is
                                        correct, add the new type by using
                                        the accept command.

Attention: Label <i>label</i> contains         This occurs when there is more
more levels of information than is      information on a DIF line than is
defined in the syntax dictionary        defined in the syntax dictionary.

<b>Example:</b> Location: North America>Maryland>Greenbelt Since location is
defined to have 2 levels of information, the loader flags the extra level of 
'Greenbelt' as a warning.  The loader will combine the last two levels 
('Maryland>Greenbelt') and try to insert that into the database.  This is 
shown to the user because the user needs to determine if it is legitimate to
allow the extra information.  For example, Originating_Center should not allow
this information.

Error: Extra Information for label       The loader tried to combine levels of
*label can not be inserted               information (see above), but failed.
                                         The addition of the extra information
                                         most likely made the string too long
                                         to insert into the database table.  
                                         The extra level of information should
                                         be removed from the DIF.

The following line is too long:          A text line in a text group is too

<p>
<A NAME="Diction"><h3>7.4  Dictionary Files</h3></A>
<p>
The loader requires four dictionary files.  These files provide the loader with a path from the DIF values to the internal Field IDs to the SQL statements.  Two of the dictionary files are fields.dic and sql.dic; see the <i>Programmers</i> API document for more information on these files.
<p>
The other two dictionary files are syntax.dic and rules.dic.  The syntax dictionary describes the syntax of the DIF by using the actual DIF labels and Field IDs to hold the DIF values.  The rules dictionary is used to describe specific loader rules such as checking for required fields and updating certain tables after creating insert statements.
<p>
<b>Syntax Dictionary</b>
<p>
The syntax dictionary maps the values in the DIF to Field IDs identified in the Fields dictionary.  The format of this file is very similar to the DIF itself.  Lines start with a DIF label followed by Field IDs for the DIF values.  Text groups also require a label even though one is not in the DIF (see the Summary group below).
<p>
Examples:
<p><pre>
entry_id:    :dif.entry_id
entry_title: :dif.entry_title
discipline:  :disc.discipline > :disc.subdiscipline > :disc.text
parameter:   :param.param_group > :param.parameter  > :param.text
location:    :location.location > :location.text
sensor_name: :sensor.short_name > :sensor.long_name > :sensor.name
source_name: :source.short_name > :source.long_name > :source.name

Group: Summary
   text: :summary.text
End_Group

Group: Data_Center
   Data_Center_Name:  :dc.center_short > :dc.center_long
   Dataset_ID:        :dc.ds_id > :dc.ds_text
   Group: Data_Center_Contact
      last_name:      :person.last_name
      first_name:     :person.first_name
      middle_name:    :person.middle_name
      email:          :email.network > :email.addr
      phone:          :person.phone
      Group: Address
         text:        :address.addr
      End_Group
   End_Group
End_Group


Example DIF line:  
Parameter:  Atmospheric Composition > Clouds

Following the mapping described in the syntax dictionary, these Field IDs would get values:
	param.param_group		ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION
	param.parameter		        CLOUDS
	param.text			
</pre>
<b>Rules Dictionary</b>
<p>
The rules dictionary was created to provide special rules for DIF processing.  While the Field ID dictionary defines actions for Field IDs, there are instances where actions need to be taken on the DIF field and group labels as opposed to the individual values.  The rules dictionary defines special commands such as getting DIF and personnel identifiers, updating a table at the end of the DIF, and putting checks on the number of times a field or group may be used.
<p>
<b>Valid Commands</b>
<p>
The rules dictionary and functions only support three commands at this time.  These are:  Appear,  SQL, and Group_Insert.
<pre>
Appear x to n Indicate special restrictions on the appearance of a field/group.
	      1 to 1	Required field that can be used only once
	      1 to n	Required field that can be used n times
	      0 to 1	Non-required field that, if used, can only appear once
	      0 to n	Non-required field -- can be used n times
                        Since this is the default field appearance, fields 
                        that are not required and have no appearance limit
                        should not be defined in this file.

SQL          Execute given SQL statement(s) upon coming across this
(label,...)  field/group during the insertion pass. Statement labels must
             appear in parentheses ( ) separated by commas.
	     Channel/cursor number is given after the labels (on #).

Group_Insert Insert the information found in this group at one time at the
             end of the group.  Default insertion occurs as fields are
             processed. 

Examples:

# Definitions in the form of:
#Document Type     Group/Field  Label                  Verb        extras...
#
Data_Set_Info         field  entry_id                Appear 1 to 1
Data_Set_Info         field  parameter               Appear 1 to 999
#
Data_Set_Info         group  Data_center_contact     SQL (loc_id, i550) on 1
Data_Set_Info         group  investigator            SQL (loc_id, i500) on 1
#
Data_Set_Info         group  data_center_contact     Group_Insert
Data_Set_Info         group  investigator            Group_Insert

Note:  The Group_Insert command also appears in the Field ID dictionary.  
</pre>
<b>Document Types</b>
<p>
Each type of DIF information is identified in the rules dictionary file.  The document types are defined with SQL labels that can be executed before and after each pass of the loader (validation and insertion). 
<p>
This method of attaching SQL labels to the passes of the DIF is necessary because the loader assumes no order to the fields in a DIF.  These SQL labels therefore could not be attached to Field IDs in the fields dictionary or the field/group labels in the rules dictionary since we do not assume a starting or ending field (even though Entry_ID is required as the first field).
<p>
Each line defining the document types contains the document type, pre-validation SQL label, post-validation label, pre-insertion label, post-insertion label, and the channel/cursor on which to executes the queries.  In the example below, the post-validation check is to determine if there is only one document in the database.  The pre-insertion  SQL label gets a de_id for all the DIFs to start the insertion pass.  The post-insertion SQL label is used to update a database table depending on the type of DIF (i.e. for a Data Set Description, the md_entry table needs to be updated which is done with SQL statement i100).
<pre>#Type                          SQL Labels              Channel/cursor
#                           Validation          Insertion
#
Data_Set_Info              0  one_dif        de_id   i100       0
Data_Center_Supp_Info      0 one_center      de_id   i1000      0
Project_Supp_Info          0  one_camp       de_id   i1100      0
Source_Supp_Info           0 one_source      de_id   i1200      0
Sensor_Supp_Info           0 one_sensor      de_id   i1300      0
</pre>
<b>Fields Dictionary</b>
<p>
The following Field ID commands are defined in the fields dictionary.  These commands are used to operate on individual field values in a DIF.
<p>
<pre><b>Command              Description</b>
Add(#)            Add the given number to the Field ID after use in an SQL 
                  statement
Ask(expression)   Prompt the user for choices if the given expression is true
DontClear         Do not clear the data in the Field ID
Group_Insert      Place this Field ID on the internal group insert queue 
Group_Validate    Place this Field ID in the internal group validate queue 
NotNull           This Field ID is not allowed to be blank 
OneOf(list)       The value in the Field ID must equal one in the list of
                  values 
StripBlanks       Remove leading and trailing blanks
Upcase            Change the value in the Field ID to upper case

<p>
<A NAME="Adding"><h3>7.5  Adding New DIF Keywords</h3></A>
<p>
The loader software was designed to allow changes to the DIF.  Changes with the DIF should only require updating the loader dictionary files.  The dictionary files provide a mapping from the DIF syntax to Field IDs and then to SQL statements.  The loader software contains special validation functions for validating dates, geographic coordinates, and the free text groups.  All other validation is handled directly through SQL statements.  
<p>
The first step is deciding what the DIF syntax will be to support the new field or fields.  New DIF keywords must be defined before any work can be started on changing the database structure.  
<p>
The next step is adding additional tables (or fields to existing tables) to the database table structure.  The database table creation scripts (discussed elsewhere in this document) should be updated and used.
<p>
After changing the database tables, the SQL statements needed to support the DIF change should be created and tested interactively with the database product.  This process of testing the SQL statements before inserting them into the SQL dictionary file will ensure that the statements are correct and reduce the need for debugging.  After the statements are working as expected, create SQL template statements in the SQL dictionary.  SQL statements need to be created and tested for field validation, insertion, and deletion.
<p>
The syntax dictionary needs the mapping from the DIF labels to the Field IDs used to hold the DIF values.  The syntax dictionary is very similar to the DIF itself.  The DIF label is followed by Fields IDs in the syntax dictionary just as the DIF label is followed by DIF values in the DIF file.  
<p>
The fields dictionary links the syntax definitions to the SQL statements via Field IDs.  The Field IDs are defined in the fields dictionary.  Each Field ID is defined with the SQL labels from the SQL dictionary that will be executed for validation, insertion, and deletion.  
<p>
The sections describing each dictionary file have more information about the format of each file.  The examples given on adding validation queries will give insight on how to add queries to the SQL dictionary and update the fields dictionary. 
<p>
<A NAME="Personnel"><h3>7.6  Personnel Loader</h3></A>
<p>
The person loader is a large and relatively complex subsystem. While the functionality of the subsystem are the same for UNIX or VMS, the implementations are slightly different because of the different way in which the two systems interact with the curses environment.
<p>
DIF files can contain information about many people who are connected with a particular entry (e.g., principal and co-investigator, data center contact, DIF author , etc.). Since a single person can occur in many DIFs, it was imperative that the loader system not duplicate the same personnel information just because it appeared in the DIF.  That particular information might already have been entered previously.
<p>
Also, the DIF manual states that complete personnel information need not be repeated in every DIF for a particular person just so long as the complete information about a particular person was included in at least one DIF.  Preparers could expect directories to be able automatically to attach peoples names with information already loaded about them. When an entry is displayed to users of the query subsystem, they should be able to see complete personnel information, if available, even if the DIF didn't have the complete personnel information.
<p>
This, of course, causes some difficulties because the only information in the DIF might be the name of an individual.  While a complete name in a DIF may uniquely identify a person 80% of the time, 20% of the time it may not.  For example, if only John Smith appears in a DIF, there many be one or more John Smiths on file in the MD. An operations person must determine which set of complete information actually pertains to any particular DIF. Any duplicate information must then be deleted.
<p>
As a result, of the difficulty of this personnel reconciliation problem, the personnel loader subsystem was created.  The entry loader loads all personnel information into temporary tables within the database.  When the loader has completed loading a DIF all the information, but personnel information, is available to the user of the query subsystem.  Before the personnel information becomes available the person loader subsystem must be run by the operations staff.
<p>
The person loader subsystem provides the following functionalities:
<ol>
<li>Load the temporary information into permanent automatically eliminating duplicate personnel information when this is possible.
<li>Provide interface to allow the operations staff to reconcile possibly conflicting personnel information by merging with existing data or accepting the temporary data as permanent.
<li>Delete all information from the temporary tables when reconciliation is complete.
<li>Provide interface to resolve address, phone and email conflicts.
<li>Update addresses directly in the database rather than require a total DIF re-load.
<li>Allow operations staff to view complete personnel information outside the context of the query subsystem.
</ol>
<p>
The person loader matches last name, first name and middle initial of the DIF data with the data already on file to ascertain whether an individual is the same.  If all of these match, it is assumed that the same person is being entered. However, if the addresses of the matched individual are different, the person loader keeps both sets of information and flags the action as an address reconciliation problem.  The operation's staff must then use the other components of the person loader subsystem to finish the personnel process. 
<p>
The person loader subsystem is curses based. To operate correctly, the terminal being used to run it must be described in the terminal definitions file used by the curses package on the target machine.

<A NAME="Utilities"><h2>Chapter 8:  Utilities</h2></A>
<p>
<A NAME="Data"><h3>8.1 Database Utilities</h3></A>
<p>
<b>Validation Update</b>
<p>
The validation update software is C based. It uses curses for its screenhandling as a result it requires that the terminal used be supported in the terminal definition file used by curses.
<p>
The purpose of this software is to insert or delete the acceptable values for DIF fields which require the use of controlled lists as documented in the appendices of the DIF manual.  These valid lists are stored in a database table which is then used by the loader backend to determine whether the values in any particular DIF are valid.  
<p>
The basic role of this component of the subsystem is the maintenance of this validation table. The software works directly on the database; it does not require the direct use of the SQL interpreter.
<p>
<b>Source and Sensor Alias Update</b>
<p>
The source and sensor alias update software is C based. It also uses curses for its screenhandling and therefore requires that the terminal being used is supported by the definition file used by the curses package.
<p>
Every DIF may contain the names of sources and sensors which were used to collect the data described by the DIF.  However, not all sources and sensors have common names which are agreed upon by all users of the data.  In order to ensure that a particular source or sensor can be queried and found with a variety of different variation in name, the MD maintains alias tables for both sources and sensors.
<p>
The basic role of this component of the subsystem is the maintenance of the source alias table and the sensor alias table. The software works directly on the database; it does not require the direct use of the SQL interpreter.
<p>
<b>Delete Utilities</b>
<p>
DIF and supplementary entries (campaign/project, data center, source, and sensor) may be deleted from the directory database using this utility.  Supplementary entries consist of descriptions of data center, project/campaign, source, and sensor.  These entries may be deleted by the acronym or the Short_Name.
The user may elect to delete DIFs from the directory without entering into the delete utility.  The DIFs must first be selected into the auto_delete database table. 
<p>
<A NAME="General"><h3>8.2  General Utilities</h3></A>
<p>
These utilities are used throughout the Master Directory system.  They are located in the MDDISK->MDPROD-> MDUTILS directory.
<p>
<b>notab</b> 
<p>
This utility allows the removal of a number of different characters from text files. Initially, its purpose was to remove TAB characters (ASCII 9) from DIF text files. The DIF manual states that TABs are not allowed in DIFs.  It was decided that no DIF should be rejected because of the use of TABs; instead these characters are just replaced with a space.
<p>
As the logging system was activated in the MD query subsystem, it was soon noticed that the data communications sometimes inserted non-printable garbage characters into the log insert statements.  The RDBMS would not process any insert statement containing these characters. So, it became important to remove them also.
<p>
notab replaces the TAB with a space and deletes any characters with an ASCII code of less than 32 (i.e., space) or greater than 127. 
<p>
<b>fixtty</b>
<p>
This utility is used to reset terminal attributes.  On a Unix system, fixtty is a shell script that calls the Unix command stty with parameters to set the terminal characteristics properly.  Under VMS, fixtty.com is a DCL command file that uses the VMS command  set term  with the appropriate parameters.
<p>
<b>mdsql</b>
<p>
This shell script provides a consistent mechanism to access an SQL interface.  mdsql[.com] is used in all  scripts that activate an SQL instruction file rather than the specific SQL access syntax.  This script expects two arguments:  the database name/password and a file of SQL statements to execute.
<p>
<b>transexe</b>
<p>
This shell script is used to move recently built software from the LIBS directory to the proper running environments.  If used when logged into the production account, the software is copied from the development directory as there are no source files in the production account.

<A NAME="Operating"><h2>Chapter 9:  Operating Environment</h2></A>
<p>
This section discusses the environment variables used in the MD software.  The format used here is UNIX.  The environment variables also exists under the VAX VMS version of the directory.  To obtain the symbols in the UNIX environment, use a $ in front of the symbol.  In the VAX VMS environment, use apostrophe (') marks around the symbol.  e.g. $MDDISK for UNIX and 'MDDISK' for VAX VMS.

<A NAME="Link"><h2>Chapter 10:  Compilation and Linking</h2></A>
<p>
<A NAME="Archive"><h3>10.1  Archive Libraries</h3></A>
<p>
The Master Directory consists of many individual C modules which are compiled separately and inserted into object libraries.  The main module for each of the subsystems and utilities are compiled individually and remain separate from the libraries.  These libraries and object modules are then linked together to create the executable files.

<pre><b>Archive Library   Description</b>
gutils            contains general utility modules used throughout the MD
                  system
ldr               contains the modules used in the Personnel Loader subsystem
loader            modules for the Entry Loader
logutils          logging utilities
md                modules for the MD Classic client and Extractor subsystems.
                  These modules handle the interface interaction and 
                  initialization.
md2               modules used by the JAM client
mdx               modules used by the X Window client
mdinfo            memory management and SQL building modules
both_mdutils      contains utility modules for the MD system.
cs_mdutils        cs_mdutils includes modules for Client/Server network 
                  routines.
sa_mdutils        sa_mdutils is a stand-alone system that links directly to the
                  database libraries.
                  both_mdutils contains modules for both client/server and 
                  stand-alone operation.
server            database and network modules for the log and database 
                  servers.
</pre>
<A NAME="Pre"><h3>10.2  Precompiling</h3></A>
<p>
The Oracle RBMS product has a C precompiler.  This precompiler makes it possible to include SQL statements directly into the C program modules.  Through precompilation, these statements are converted into the appropriate C assignments and function calls for the Oracle object libraries.  These files include db_server.pc, db_open.pc, and db_close.pc.  The precompiler produces the corresponding .C file.
<p>
<A Name="Vax"><h3>10.3  VAX VMS Compilation</h3></A>
<p>
The VMS operating system allows modules to be compiled in both debug and non-debug mode.  For debug mode, it is necessary to also use the NOOPTIMIZE switch.  In the case of NODEBUG compilation, the OPTIMIZE switch should be used to direct the compiler to optimize the generated machine code.  
<p>
There is one exception to use of the optimize switch for nodebug compilation.  The C modules which are produced by precompilation <i>must</i> be compiled with the NOOPTIMIZE switch.  The command procedures which build the MD system allow these compilation switches to be selected.  Please refer to the VMS system documentation for more information on compiling C source code modules.
<p>
In the MD system, the logical C$INCLUDE is used to a point to the location of all of the C header files.  
<p>
<A NAME="Vms"><h3>10.4  VAX VMS Linking</h3></A>
<p>
The components of the complete MD system require varying combinbations of MD object libraries and VAX Run Time libraries.  In all cases, the VAX C Run Time Library (RTL) is required.  Many of the subsystems also require the Curses Screen Management package.  The involvement of the Curses Package requires that the link library logicals be reassigned to ensure that the C RTL rather than the GRTL is included.  The MD.COM contains the definitions and symbols for the VAX VMS MD environment.  The following library logicals should be defined (in the order given):
<p>
       <pre>       $ define lnk$library sys$library:vaxccurse.olb 
       $ define lnk$library_1 sys$library:vaxcrtl.olb </pre>
<p>
<A NAME="Unix"><h3>10.5  Unix Compilation</h3></A>
<p>
For the Unix operating systems, the MD system is compiled by a combination of shell scripts (called build scripts) and make files.  The build scripts have the same names as the archive library with a .bld extension.  The Unix operating systems allows modules to be compiled in both debug and non-debug mode.  For debug mode, it is necessary to use the -g option when using a build script.  
<p>
In the MD system, the system environment variable INCLUDE is used to a point to the location of all of the C header files.  
<p>
<A NAME="Linking"><h3>10.6  Unix Linking</h3></A>
<p>
All linking for the MD subsystem is done through make and slink files.   slink files are shell scripts while make files use the Unix make utility.

<h1>ABOUT DIFS</h1>

<hr>
<H2>What is a DIF?</H2> <p>

DIF is the acronym for Directory Interchange Format, a de-facto standard
used to create directory entries which describe a group of data.  A DIF
consists of a collection of fields which detail specific information about
the data.  Six fields are required in the DIF; the others expand upon and
clarify the information.  Some of the fields are text fields, others require
the use of valid values.  
<p>

Seven fields have been added to the DIF to facilitate compliance with the
U.S. federally mandated Federal Geographic Data Committee's (FGDC) Content
Standard on Digital Geospatial Metadata.  The new fields will add
information for users to make a better decision on the usefulness of a
dataset.  FGDC is one over several format offerings, to which the DIF may
be mapped: see <a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/dif_mapping/format_options5_0.html">
http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/dif_mapping/format_options5_0.html</a>. 
<P> 

Skinny DIF is a DIF which consists of only the required DIF fields. 
Skinny DIFs are put into a directory to alert users of the existence of a
particular data set, and may be modified at a later time.
<P>

This document provides information about each field of the DIF, including
its syntax, recommendations, and examples.  A DIF example and a DIF
template are also provided.  In addition, the various DIF-writing tools
are listed.

<h1>DIF-Writing Tools</h1>

Several software and Internet tools exist for writing DIFs:

<ul>                                                                            
<li>DIFmacs:  a UNIX tool using the Emacs editor 
<li>DIFwrite:  a PC-DOS tool  
<li>DIFent:  a PC-Windows tool
<li>DIFweb:  the DIF-writing tool on the World Wide Web
</ul>                                                                           


<h2>DIFmacs</h2>

This tool is based on the Emacs text editor on UNIX platforms.  DIFmacs is
especially useful for people who write many DIFs. <p>

You will need to have Emacs on a UNIX platform.  DIFmacs consists of Lisp
extensions to Emacs which are available for free by anonymous ftp.  
Download the file <b>difmacs.tar.gz</b> from <a 
href="ftp://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/md_install">
ftp://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/md_install</a>.
<p>
DIFmacs was developed at the GCMD.

<h2>DIFwrite</h2>

DIFwrite is the simplest DIF-writing tool.  All that is required is an
IBM-compatible PC (minimum 286) with DOS.  The software is available for 
free by anonymous ftp.  Download the file <b>version1.zip</b> from <a 
href="ftp://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/DIFwrite">
ftp://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/DIFwrite</a><p>

Also, diskettes can be obtained free of charge from the GCMD User Support
Office:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/mail?gcmduso"> 
gcmduso@gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov</a><br>
phone: 301-441-4202<br>
fax: 301-441-9486<p> 

DIFwrite was created by GCMD staff.

<h2>DIFent</h2>

DIFent is a Windows-based DIF-writing tool for the PC.  It is available
for free by ftp after registering with Smith System Engineering at <a
href="http://www.smithsys.co.uk/dif/">http://www.smithsys.co.uk/dif/</a>

<p>
DIFent was created by Smith System Engineering, U.K.

<h2>DIFweb</h2>

DIFweb is a World Wide Web forms-based DIF-writing tool on the Internet. 
It can be found at <a
href="/cgi-bin/difweb">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/difweb</a>
<p>
DIFweb was developed by GCMD staff.

<title>Tips for DIF Writing</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Tips for DIF Writing</h1>

A key question when writing a DIF is what should be described in a single
entry?  In some cases, a group of data, commonly known as a data set, should
be described by a single DIF.  In other cases, related data may be grouped
together even though they may be identifiable in smaller subsets at the
catalog or inventory level.  However, your determination of the appropriate
group of data to describe should be the primary guideline<P>

All applicable fields for a given data set should be completed.  Some
information may not be available or cannot be recovered, and some fields
do not necessarily apply to every data set.  Other fields are critical
for use in data set selection (<i>i.e.,</i> parameter, time coverage,
discipline) or user understanding of the data (<i>i.e.,</i> summary,
reference).  When the information cannot be obtained or would not make
sense, the field should be omitted.<P>


<h2>Suggestions:</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Data set characteristics that might suggest separate directory entries
may be:

   <UL><LI>a unique sensor/platform/project combination

   <LI>a unique parameter, parameter combination, or set of independent
       variables contained in the data set

   <LI>a unique processing level.
   </UL>

<LI>Data set characteristics that do not indicate a need for separate entries
include:

   <UL><LI>identical data sets available on different media

   <LI>data held at multiple locations, except when significant differences
     exist between the data archived in different places (<i>i.e.,</i> different
     processing algorithms)

   <LI>distinct spatial or temporal resolutions or coverages for a given group
   of data

  <LI>data used for the interpretation or organization of a data set (<i>i.e.,</i>
      map overlays, indices to data), which would not be listed separately but
      which would be mentioned in the summary
      </UL>

Group: Summary
 
This data set contains global SSM/I antenna temperatures (19.0, 22,
and 37 GHz), with derived measurements of water vapor, cloud water,
and wind speed, only over the oceans.  The antenna temperature dataset
is not complete as some channels have been screened according to the
underlying surface classification.  The SSM/I is a seven-channel,
four-frequency, dual-polarized, passive microwave radiometer which
measures the atmospheric, oceanic, and land surface microwave
brightness temperatures at 19.3, 22.2, 37.0 and 85.5 GHz.  The orbit
of the satellite is near- circular, sun-synchronous, and near-polar
with an inclination of 98.8 degrees.  The ascending equatorial
crossing time for the F10 satellite is approximately 7:42 pm local
time.
 
This SSM/I geophysical products data set is produced by Remote Sensing
Systems.  Each logical record corresponds to a single SSM/I scan,
which contains sixty four 25km resolution cells.  Time, latitude, and
longitude are given for the cells.  In addition, for each cell there
is is a surface classification index (e.g., 7-land, 5-sea ice,
0-water) and a set of 5 parameters that correspond to some combination
of antenna temperatures and geophysical parameters.  Land cells are
recorded as antenna temperatures for the SSM/I 19V, 19H, 22V, 37V, and
37H sensors.  Ocean cells are recorded as antenna temperatures for the
SSM/I 19V and 19H, wind speed (W), water vapor content (V), and
cloud/rain liquid water content (L).
 
These data were taken by the SSM/I aboard DMSP F10.

<PRE>Group:  Summary
   Seasat was launched on June 28, 1978 carrying a five sensor payload.
   The objective of the Altimeter (ALT) was to determine ocean
   topography with a height measurement precision of 10 cm.  The ALT
   carrier frequency was 13.5 GHz and operated in chirp pulse mode with
   a 3.2 micro-sec uncompressed pulse width and 3.125 ns compressed
   pulse width.  The pulse limited footprint diameter was 1.2 km for
   calm seas; beam-limited footprint diameter was 22.2 km.

   The primary parameters telemetered to the ground processing system at
   10/sec rate were height, significant wave height, and Automatic Gain
   Control (AGC).  The height, described herein, is the sea surface
   height with respect to the reference ellipsoid.  From altimeter
   workshop results, the height measurement bias has been determined as
   0.0 +/- 0.7 m when the sea state bias effects are modeled.

   Height data are available on 1600 or 6250 bpi magnetic tapes for:
   Level 1 Sensor Data Record, Level 1.5 Sensor File and Level 2
   Geophysical Data Record.  Level 2.5 data sets are maintained on-line
   by the NODS archive system.  Full tape copies will be made on
   request. Please specify the period of interest when ordering.  Allow
   1-3 weeks for delivery depending on the order size.

<PRE>Group: Summary
   The Solar and Meteorological Surface Observational Network (SAMSON)
   3-volume CD-ROM set is now available from the National Climatic Data
   Center (NCDC), Asheville, North Carolina. This dataset was developed
   jointly by the NCDC and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
   (NREL), Boulder, Colorado. The 3 CD-ROM's are divided geographically
   into regions (eastern, central, and western U.S.--1 CD-ROM/region),
   and contain hourly solar radiation and meteorological data for the
   period 1961-1990. They encompass 237 National Weather Service (NWS)
   stations in the U.S., along with stations in Guam and Puerto
   Rico. The dataset includes both observational and modelled data. The
   5 solar elements are: extraterrestrial horizontal and
   extraterrestrial direct normal radiation; global; diffuse; and direct
   normal radiation. The 16 meteorological elements are: total and
   opaque sky cover, temperature and dewpoint, relative humidity,
   station pressure, wind direction and speed, visibility, ceiling
   height, present weather, precipitable water, aerosoloptical depth,
   snow depth, days since last snowfall, and hourly precipitation.

   The cost is $100 per region or $300 per 3-volume set.

<title>Proposed Fields for DIF v.6</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Proposed Metadata Fields for Directory Interchange Format, Version 6</h1>

The following metadata fields have been or will shortly be officially
proposed to the Interop Listserver, the listserver which discusses issues
related to the Directory Interchange Format (DIF).  If approved, these
fields will be included in DIF Version 6.  To see a hypertext listing of
the postings on the Interop Listserver, click <a
href="/hypermail/interop">here</a>. 
<p>

DIF v.6 will include all fields from DIF v.5 in addition to the fields
listed below (if approved).  Keep in mind that the fields below are
proposed only.  These fields will undergo a comment and revision period on
the Interop Listserver before being sent to the DIF Interop Voting
Committee.  The fields, as they are proposed below, may undergo
substantial revision.  Under no circumstances should this document be used
to indicate finality of the DIF structure.  
<p>

DIF v.6 is targetted for release in October, 1996.  The software to
support these new fields is targetted for release in December, 1996. 
<p>

For a complete description of the current DIF Version 5, see the <a 
href="difman.html">DIF Writer's Guide</a>.
<p>

Comments on the fields below should be sent to the 
<a href="mailto:interop@gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov">Interop Listserver</a>. 

<p>
<hr>
<h2>Aggregation</h2>

<h3>Definition</h3>

This optional field can be used to point to other DIFs that describe more
detailed information about the same dataset.  Thus, large datasets can be
described by writing multiple DIFs about the sub-datasets, thereby
allowing very specific information about the dataset.  The sub-DIFs are
linked by URLs listed in the super-DIF.  Because the URL fields are
hypertext linked, the sub-DIFs (very specific DIFs) can be held and 
maintained at remote sites. 

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre>
Group: Aggregation
   Aggregation_Criteria:
   SuperDIF_URL:
   SubDIF_URL:
End_Group
</pre>

See the <a href="/hypermail/interop/0029.html">proposal</a> on the Interop 
Listserver for specifications and examples.

<p>
<hr>

<h2>Language</h2>

<h3>Definition</h3>

This optional field describes the language of the textual information of 
the stored data.  If a data set is available in two or more languages, 
the field may be repeated.

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre>
Language:
</pre>

See the <a href="/hypermail/interop/0033.html">proposal</a> on the Interop
Listserver for further description and examples. 

<p>
<hr>
<h2>Location</h2>

<h3>Definition</h3>
This field already exists in the DIF, but the valid keywords and/or the
structure of the field will be modified to incorporate country names, 
which are currently missing from the list of valid keywords.

<h3>Possible Syntax</h3>
<pre>
Group: Location
   Continent:
   Region:
   Country:
   Oceans_and_Seas:
   Vertical_Location:
End_Group
</pre>

<b>Or</b>
<pre>
Location: Category > Location Name
</pre>
<p>
This field has not yet been officially proposed.

<p>
<hr>
<h2>Years Before Present (YBP)</h2>

<h3>Definition</h3> 
Geologic and prehistoric data sets are often associated with an age in
years before present (YBP). This optional free-text field can be used to
indicate that numeric age.  This field will be incorporated as a subfield
in the Temporal Coverage group. 

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre>
Group: Temporal_Coverage
   Start_Date:
   Stop_Date:
   YBP:
End_Group
</pre>

<p>
This field has not yet been officially proposed.

<p>
<hr>
<h2>FAX</h2>

<h3>Definition</h3>
The current method of specifying FAX numbers is to write the FAX number 
in the Phone field, followed by the letters 'FAX'.  A new FAX field will 
avoid confusion.  This new FAX field will appear after the Phone field in 
all personnel groups (i.e. Investigator, Technical Contact, Data Center 
Contact, DIF Author).

                   INTEROP LISTSERVER PROPOSAL #6<br>
<p>
Replacement of the DIF Field "Aggregated" with an Aggregation Group<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Presently, the field, "Aggregated", takes either a yes or no value and<br>
indicates whether or not a DIF is aggregated, i.e. whether the DIF<br>
provides general information about many specific datasets or not. <br>
<p>
We have found the following inadequacies with the current aggregation<br>
field: the user does not know how the specific information was organized<br>
in the aggregated DIF, and the user has no way of directly accessing the<br>
more specific DIFs (if they exist). <br>
<p>
In order for the DIF to be useful in providing information about<br>
aggregation, we propose the following new DIF group to replace the current<br>
aggregation field: <br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
    Aggregation_Criteria:<br>
    SuperDIF_URL:<br>
    SuperDIF_URL:<br>
    .<br>
    .<br>
    .<br>
    SubDIF_URL:<br>
    SubDIF_URL:<br>
    .<br>
    .<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
The field Aggregation_Criteria is a free text field which allows DIF<br>
authors to describe how the underlying DIFs were organized in the<br>
aggregated DIF. <br>
<p>
The URL fields provide access information for the underlying DIFs in the<br>
following way.  An aggregated DIF (or super DIF) points to underlying DIFs<br>
(or sub DIFs).  The sub DIFs can point back to the generalized overlying<br>
(super) DIF.  Thus, aggregated DIFs can point to sub DIFs, and sub DIFs<br>
can point to super aggregated DIFs. <br>
<p>
No DIF would have both fields SuperDIF_URL and SubDIF_URL.  Super DIFs<br>
would only have SubDIF_URLs listed in them, and sub DIFs would only have<br>
SuperDIF_URLs listed in them. <br>
<p>
URLs would all be hyperlinked.<br>
<p>
The existence or nonexistence of the group indicates whether the DIF is<br>
involved in DIF aggregation or not.  Thus, inclusion of the group in the<br>
DIF is optional.  If the group is included, the field Aggregation_Criteria<br>
is mandatory, but the fields SuperDIF_URL and SubDIF_URL are optional. <br>
The field Aggregation_Criteria may only be used once, while SuperDIF_URL<br>
and SubDIF_URL (if included) may be used as often as necessary. <br>
<p>
Please see the examples below for further clarification on how the<br>
Aggregation Group would be implemented in the DIF, both for existing DIFs<br>
and new DIFs. <br>
<p>
The addition of the Aggregation Group is a step in bringing the DIF into<br>
the age of distributed systems.  Two primary advantages result from the<br>
inclusion of this group in the DIF:  users will be able to access numerous<br>
related DIFs directly from a single DIF, and data centers will be able to<br>
maintain their own DIFs while still allowing user access from outside<br>
systems.  Remember that the group is entirely optional, as is the listing<br>
of URLs within the group. <br>
<p>
<p>
EXAMPLES FOR CURRENT DIFS in the GCMD<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
<p>
1) A GCMD DIF describes a NOAA Library book collection of information on<br>
meteorological observations at various temporal coverages for Lithuania.<br>
An Aggregation Group will be inserted into the GCMD DIF, containing the<br>
URL's for the underlying DIFs (SubDIF_URL) that pertain to the book<br>
collection. In this case there are 4 SubDIF_URL fields pertaining to the<br>
varying temporal coverages. <br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
  Aggregation_Criteria: separated by temporal coverage<br>
  SubDIF_URL: <br>
<a href="http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NCL0<br>
0032&amp;form=noaadir<br>
  SubDIF_URL: <br>
<a href="http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NCL0<br>
0033&amp;form=noaadir<br>
  SubDIF_URL: <br>
<a href="http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NCL0<br>
0034&amp;form=noaadir<br>
  SubDIF_URL: <br>
<a href="http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NCL0<br>
0066&amp;form=noaadir<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
<p>
2) There are 2 GCMD DIFs representing the a) Nimbus-7 ERB MATRIX<br>
(ERB-MATRIX), and b) Nimbus-7 ERB Solar Irradiances (N7-ERB). These data<br>
sets also exist in the GCMD GEDEX CD-ROM DIF. An Aggregation Group will be<br>
inserted into the 2 DIFS, containing the URL for the overlying DIF<br>
(SuperDIF_URL). In this case there is 1 SuperDIF_URL field pertaining to the<br>
GEDEX CD-ROM. An Aggregation Group will also be inserted into the GEDEX<br>
CD-ROM DIF containing the URL's for the 2 underlying DIFs (SubDIF_URL). In<br>
this case there are 2 SubDIF_URL's pertaining to the CD-ROM. <br>
<p>
a) ERB-MATRIX DIF:<br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
  Aggregation_Criteria: This data set is also located on the GEDEX CD-ROM<br>
  SuperDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=GEDEX<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
b) N7-ERB DIF:<br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
  Aggregation_Criteria: This data set is also located on the GEDEX CD-ROM<br>
  SuperDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=GEDEX<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
c) GEDEX CD-ROM DIF:<br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
  Aggregation_Criteria: The URLs below point to DIFs with more <br>
information about the data on this CD-ROM.<br>
  Sub_URL:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=RB2/EN67-2<br>
  Sub_URL:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=N-7-ERB<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
<p>
EXAMPLES FOR NEW DIFS in the GCMD<br>
---------------------------------<br>
<p>
1) NSIDC has snow cover data sets for North America for the last 10 years.<br>
They have generated 10 DIFS on their system and would like to generate a<br>
GCMD entry to represent the 10 data sets. The GCMD DIF would contain an<br>
Aggregation Group containing the URL's for the underlying DIFs<br>
(SubDIF_URL). In this case there are 10 SubDIF_URL fields pertaining to<br>
the 10 years of snow cover data. <br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
  Aggregation_Criteria: separated by year<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1986<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1987<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1988<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1989<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1990<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1991<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1992<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1993<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1994<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1995<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
Please note in this example, NSIDC need not submit its ten DIFs to the<br>
GCMD, only the one super DIF, if it so chooses.  In addition, the ten<br>
individual DIFs at NSIDC can point to the super DIF at the GCMD using the<br>
SuperDIF_URL field, if NSIDC chooses to do this. <br>
<p>
<p>
2) USGS has a digital line graph (DLG) dataset for Pennsylvania.  In<br>
addition, USGS has two CD-ROMs which incorporate this dataset.  One CD-ROM<br>
contains digital line graph data for the entire U.S.  The other CD-ROM<br>
contains a GIS of Pennsylvania including a Pennsylvania DEM, Pennsylvania<br>
hydrography, roads, land cover, and the Pennsylvania DLG. The DIF for the<br>
Pennsylvania DLG subset would contain an aggregation group with two<br>
SuperDIF_URLs.  In this case, the GCMD holds all three DIFs. <br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
   Aggregation_Criteria: There are two CD-ROMs, see the URLs below, which <br>
incorporate this data set.<br>
   SuperDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=USGS_US_DLG_CDROM<br>
   SuperDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=USGS_PA_GIS_CDROM<br>

Further to our report at the CEOS meeting held in Japan last week<br>
we are making the following proposal to provide a language field in the<br>
IDN DIF.<br>
<p>
In 1994 the Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB) accepted<br>
Document No. CGSB-171.3  Directory Information Describing Digital<br>
Geo-Referenced Data Sets.<br>
<p>
Last summer we compared the new requirements of the CGSB with<br>
the current DIF (at that time), and the proposed changes by Lyne<br>
Halpern for the IDN DIF to meet the new FGDC metadata standard.<br>
We accepted the changes proposed by Lyne as they were similar<br>
to the new requirements of our CGSB.  The differences were the<br>
choice and use of alternate field names.  (They would ultimately<br>
gather the same information.)  For example, the CGSB uses Data<br>
Manager instead of Technical Contact.  The only addition was a<br>
language field. Since Canada has two official languages - English<br>
and French, this was necessary to meet the CGSB standard.<br>
<p>
As there is no other additional information that is required to<br>
accompany the field, I suggest that we simply add the following<br>
field to the IDN DIF:<br>
<p>
   Language: language_name<br>
   &lt;This optional field describes the language of the textual<br>
     information of the stored data.&gt;<br>
<p>
The field should be repeated if the data is available in more<br>
than one language.<br>
<p>
For example:  Language: English<br>
                     Language: French<br>
<p>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
<p>

In reference to the recommendation to add a language field to DIF, please<br>
consider the possible applications and complexities of language identification<br>
when creating a field or fields. Examples can be obtained from other<br>
systems. They include (1) language of the information object, and it is<br>
possible for the information object to be in more than one language, e.g.,<br>
English and French; (2) language of the metadata record; and (3) language<br>
description at the data element level, e.g., an English version of the<br>
title, a French version of the title.<br>
<p>

<p>
<p>
Buffam, Andrea<br>
<i>| </i><br>
<i>| </i><br>
<i>| Further to our report at the CEOS meeting held in Japan last week</i><br>
<i>| we are making the following proposal to provide a language field in the</i><br>
<i>| IDN DIF.</i><br>
<i>| </i><br>
<i>| In 1994 the Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB) accepted</i><br>
<i>| Document No. CGSB-171.3  Directory Information Describing Digital</i><br>
<i>| Geo-Referenced Data Sets.</i><br>
<i>| </i><br>
<i>| Last summer we compared the new requirements of the CGSB with</i><br>
<i>| the current DIF (at that time), and the proposed changes by Lyne</i><br>
<i>| Halpern for the IDN DIF to meet the new FGDC metadata standard.</i><br>
<i>| We accepted the changes proposed by Lyne as they were similar</i><br>
<i>| to the new requirements of our CGSB.  The differences were the</i><br>
<i>| choice and use of alternate field names.  (They would ultimately</i><br>
<i>| gather the same information.)  For example, the CGSB uses Data</i><br>
<i>| Manager instead of Technical Contact.  The only addition was a</i><br>
<i>| language field. Since Canada has two official languages - English</i><br>
<i>| and French, this was necessary to meet the CGSB standard.</i><br>
<i>| </i><br>
<i>| As there is no other additional information that is required to</i><br>
<i>| accompany the field, I suggest that we simply add the following</i><br>
<i>| field to the IDN DIF:</i><br>
<i>| </i><br>
<i>|    Language: language_name</i><br>
<i>|    &lt;This optional field describes the language of the textual</i><br>
<i>|      information of the stored data.&gt;</i><br>
<i>| </i><br>
<i>| The field should be repeated if the data is available in more</i><br>
<i>| than one language.</i><br>
<i>| </i><br>
<i>| For example:  Language: English</i><br>
<i>|                      Language: French</i><br>
<i>| </i><br>
<i>| </i><br>
<i>| Sincerely,</i><br>

        Reply to:   RE&gt;INTEROP: Aggregation Proposal<br>
<p>
Ron Vogel,<br>
<p>
I agree with much of what Linda Hill had to say, but wish to expand on it<br>
somewhat.<br>
<p>
Your Pennsylvania example had both sets containing DLG, while the second<br>
CD-ROM had additional data which could result in "several" 'subDIF_URL' and<br>
'superDIF_URL' links.  Therefore, I think you should not limit the number of<br>
subs and supers in an aggregation.<br>

                   INTEROP LISTSERVER PROPOSAL #6<br>
<p>
Replacement of the DIF Field "Aggregated" with an Aggregation Group<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Presently, the field, "Aggregated", takes either a yes or no value and<br>
indicates whether or not a DIF is aggregated, i.e. whether the DIF<br>
provides general information about many specific datasets or not. <br>
<p>
We have found the following inadequacies with the current aggregation<br>
field: the user does not know how the specific information was organized<br>
in the aggregated DIF, and the user has no way of directly accessing the<br>
more specific DIFs (if they exist). <br>
<p>
In order for the DIF to be useful in providing information about<br>
aggregation, we propose the following new DIF group to replace the current<br>
aggregation field: <br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
    Aggregation_Criteria:<br>
    SuperDIF_URL:<br>
    SuperDIF_URL:<br>
    .<br>
    .<br>
    .<br>
    SubDIF_URL:<br>
    SubDIF_URL:<br>
    .<br>
    .<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
The field Aggregation_Criteria is a free text field which allows DIF<br>
authors to describe how the underlying DIFs were organized in the<br>
aggregated DIF. <br>
<p>
The URL fields provide access information for the underlying DIFs in the<br>
following way.  An aggregated DIF (or super DIF) points to underlying DIFs<br>
(or sub DIFs).  The sub DIFs can point back to the generalized overlying<br>
(super) DIF.  Thus, aggregated DIFs can point to sub DIFs, and sub DIFs<br>
can point to super aggregated DIFs. <br>
<p>
No DIF would have both fields SuperDIF_URL and SubDIF_URL.  Super DIFs<br>
would only have SubDIF_URLs listed in them, and sub DIFs would only have<br>
SuperDIF_URLs listed in them. <br>
<p>
URLs would all be hyperlinked.<br>
<p>
The existence or nonexistence of the group indicates whether the DIF is<br>
involved in DIF aggregation or not.  Thus, inclusion of the group in the<br>
DIF is optional.  If the group is included, the field Aggregation_Criteria<br>
is mandatory, but the fields SuperDIF_URL and SubDIF_URL are optional. <br>
The field Aggregation_Criteria may only be used once, while SuperDIF_URL<br>
and SubDIF_URL (if included) may be used as often as necessary. <br>
<p>
Please see the examples below for further clarification on how the<br>
Aggregation Group would be implemented in the DIF, both for existing DIFs<br>
and new DIFs. <br>
<p>
The addition of the Aggregation Group is a step in bringing the DIF into<br>
the age of distributed systems.  Two primary advantages result from the<br>
inclusion of this group in the DIF:  users will be able to access numerous<br>
related DIFs directly from a single DIF, and data centers will be able to<br>
maintain their own DIFs while still allowing user access from outside<br>
systems.  Remember that the group is entirely optional, as is the listing<br>
of URLs within the group. <br>
<p>
<p>
EXAMPLES FOR CURRENT DIFS in the GCMD<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
<p>
1) A GCMD DIF describes a NOAA Library book collection of information on<br>
meteorological observations at various temporal coverages for Lithuania.<br>
An Aggregation Group will be inserted into the GCMD DIF, containing the<br>
URL's for the underlying DIFs (SubDIF_URL) that pertain to the book<br>
collection. In this case there are 4 SubDIF_URL fields pertaining to the<br>
varying temporal coverages. <br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
  Aggregation_Criteria: separated by temporal coverage<br>
  SubDIF_URL: <br>
<a href="http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NCL0<br>
0032&amp;form=noaadir<br>
  SubDIF_URL: <br>
<a href="http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NCL0<br>
0033&amp;form=noaadir<br>
  SubDIF_URL: <br>
<a href="http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NCL0<br>
0034&amp;form=noaadir<br>
  SubDIF_URL: <br>
<a href="http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NCL0<br>
0066&amp;form=noaadir<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
<p>
2) There are 2 GCMD DIFs representing the a) Nimbus-7 ERB MATRIX<br>
(ERB-MATRIX), and b) Nimbus-7 ERB Solar Irradiances (N7-ERB). These data<br>
sets also exist in the GCMD GEDEX CD-ROM DIF. An Aggregation Group will be<br>
inserted into the 2 DIFS, containing the URL for the overlying DIF<br>
(SuperDIF_URL). In this case there is 1 SuperDIF_URL field pertaining to the<br>
GEDEX CD-ROM. An Aggregation Group will also be inserted into the GEDEX<br>
CD-ROM DIF containing the URL's for the 2 underlying DIFs (SubDIF_URL). In<br>
this case there are 2 SubDIF_URL's pertaining to the CD-ROM. <br>
<p>
a) ERB-MATRIX DIF:<br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
  Aggregation_Criteria: This data set is also located on the GEDEX CD-ROM<br>
  SuperDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=GEDEX<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
b) N7-ERB DIF:<br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
  Aggregation_Criteria: This data set is also located on the GEDEX CD-ROM<br>
  SuperDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=GEDEX<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
c) GEDEX CD-ROM DIF:<br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
  Aggregation_Criteria: The URLs below point to DIFs with more <br>
information about the data on this CD-ROM.<br>
  Sub_URL:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=RB2/EN67-2<br>
  Sub_URL:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=N-7-ERB<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
<p>
EXAMPLES FOR NEW DIFS in the GCMD<br>
---------------------------------<br>
<p>
1) NSIDC has snow cover data sets for North America for the last 10 years.<br>
They have generated 10 DIFS on their system and would like to generate a<br>
GCMD entry to represent the 10 data sets. The GCMD DIF would contain an<br>
Aggregation Group containing the URL's for the underlying DIFs<br>
(SubDIF_URL). In this case there are 10 SubDIF_URL fields pertaining to<br>
the 10 years of snow cover data. <br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
  Aggregation_Criteria: separated by year<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1986<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1987<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1988<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1989<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1990<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1991<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1992<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1993<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1994<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1995<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
Please note in this example, NSIDC need not submit its ten DIFs to the<br>
GCMD, only the one super DIF, if it so chooses.  In addition, the ten<br>
individual DIFs at NSIDC can point to the super DIF at the GCMD using the<br>
SuperDIF_URL field, if NSIDC chooses to do this. <br>
<p>
<p>
2) USGS has a digital line graph (DLG) dataset for Pennsylvania.  In<br>
addition, USGS has two CD-ROMs which incorporate this dataset.  One CD-ROM<br>
contains digital line graph data for the entire U.S.  The other CD-ROM<br>
contains a GIS of Pennsylvania including a Pennsylvania DEM, Pennsylvania<br>
hydrography, roads, land cover, and the Pennsylvania DLG. The DIF for the<br>

        Reply to:   RE&gt;INTEROP: aggregation flag<br>
<p>
I have a problem with associating "false" with any dataset.  Can the field and<br>
description not be set up so that the term "multiple dataset description" is<br>
indicated as pertaining by an "X" in a box in front to the term, and indicated<br>
not to pertain by leaving the box blank?<br>

Dear Interoplist Participant:<br>
<p>
An "aggregation flag" has been integrated into the GCMD database and<br>
is displayed as a DIF field.  The aggregation flag can be viewed by<br>
the user or populated by the DIF writer.  The purpose of this field is<br>
to alert the end-user that the dataset description (in DIF) describes more<br>
than one dataset.  The aggregation flag is set to "TRUE" if the DIF<br>
describes more than one dataset; the flag is set to FALSE (default) if<br>
only one dataset is described.<br>
<p>
If more than one dataset is being described (aggregation flag set to<br>
"TRUE"), the DIF writer may want to uniquely identify each dataset<br>
using the "Dataset_ID" field.<br>

Dear Interoplist Partcipant:<br>
<p>
<p>
PROPOSED CHANGES TO GCMD KEYWORD QUERY SCHEME <br>
  <br>
PRESENT SCHEME<br>
--------------<br>
An expanded list of keywords is proposed to enhance the current Global<br>
Change Master Directory (GCMD) database query scheme.  The current<br>
keyword structure consists of the following categories:<br>
  <br>
 DISCIPLINE (e.g. Earth Science) <br>
 SUBDISCIPLINE (e.g. Atmosphere)<br>
 PARAMETER GROUP (e.g. Atmospheric Composition)<br>
 PARAMETER (e.g. Carbon Dioxide)<br>
 <br>
Presently all of the keywords (disciplines, parameters, etc.) are<br>
"controlled" and are presented to the end-user and DIF writer as a<br>
list of "valid" keywords with cross-validation among the four<br>
categories (PARAMETERS are associated with a PARAMETER GROUP which is<br>
associated with a SUBDISCIPLINE which is associated with a<br>
DISCIPLINE).<br>
  <br>
  <br>
PROPOSED CHANGE<br>
--------------- <br>
The proposed change would:<br>
 <br>
 - Rename the four categories to:<br>
    <br>
   DISCIPLINE * Actually NO CHANGE except that we expect only 3 major <br>
                disciplines.  The DISCIPLINEs will be Earth Science,<br>
                Socio-Economics, and Space Science.<br>
  <br>
   TOPICS (e.g. Atmospheric Science)  *  This combines the former<br>
                                         SUBDISCIPLINE and PARAMETER<br>
                                         GROUP categories and is labeled<br>
                                         TOPICS.  <br>
<p>
 <br>
<p>
  <br>
   Earth Science Topics are:<br>
   -------------------------<br>
   Atmospheric Science<br>
   Biosphere<br>
   Hydrosphere<br>
   Land Surface<br>
   Ocean Science<br>
   Paleoscience Data<br>
   Radiance and Imagery<br>
   Solar Radiation<br>
   Solid Earth<br>
   Transient Phenomena<br>
   Potential Fields<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  <br>
  CONTROLLED KEYWORDS (e.g. Clouds) * This is the former PARAMETER category<br>
                                     with many changes incorprated. <br>
 <br>
  UNCONTROLLED KEYWORDS (e.g. Total Cloud Cover) * This is an<br>
                                      "uncontrolled" list of keywords<br>
                                      cross-validated with the<br>
                                      "controlled" keywords.<br>
 <br>
 - Retain the cross-validation scheme that presently exists.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 HIGHLIGHTS<br>
 ----------<br>
- Users can choose a DISCIPLINE (e.g. Earth Science) and go directly<br>
 to a list of CONTROLLED KEYWORDS (e.g. Clouds), or filter the list by<br>
 choosing a TOPIC (e.g. Atmospheric Science).<br>
  <br>
- Controlled keywords are presented if the user wishes to directly select from<br>
 the controlled (i.e. predefined or "valid") list.<br>
<p>
<p>
  <br>
  - The user can also choose to search a list of "uncontrolled" keywords<br>
  that are associated with the controlled keywords, but are searchable<br>
  as free text.<br>
  <br>
 - DIF writers are free to add any keyword that is appropriate for the<br>
 dataset being described.  Any new keywords will be added to the<br>
 growing thesaurus of "uncontrolled" keywords and will be maintained by<br>
 directory personnel.<br>
  <br>
 <br>
 <br>
  Over the past year, several groups have participated with the GCMD in<br>
  developing the expanded list of keywords.  Participants include<br>
  include the Version 0 Information Management System (IMS), the EOSDIS<br>
  DAACs, the EOS Science Processing Support Office (SPSO), the National<br>
  Biological Service (NBS), the Consortium for International Earth<br>
  Science Information Network (CIESIN), the National Snow and Ice Data<br>
  Center (NSIDC), and the German Climate Computer Center (DKRZ).  The<br>
  GCMD staff thanks these groups for their interest and assistance in<br>
  developing the keyword list.<br>
  <br>
 <br>
 ACCESS<br>
 ------ <br>
 The complete list of keywords is available on the GCMD Home Page at:<br>

I would like to comment on the structure that has been proposed (Gene Major,<br>
24 Apr 1995) for GCMD "keyword query scheme". The scheme moves away from<br>
some of the elaborate structure now in place but it doesn't go far enough<br>
toward freeing the system from a limiting structure of pre-coordination of<br>
concepts.<br>
<p>
My background is in library and information science. I have managed<br>
thesaurus development and maintenance for the exploration and production<br>
segment of the petroleum industry and worked with the lexicography and<br>
indexing staff of NASA's Center for AeroSpace Information (the NASA<br>
thesaurus). I have also participated in the writing of the recent revision<br>
to the NISO standard on thesaurus construction. My language may not be the<br>
same as the GCMD participants are used to using. Therefore, I will try to<br>
use both sets of terms in the brief explanation of my concerns that follow.<br>
<p>
A set of controlled keywords can be a thesaurus where synonomous terms (or<br>
nearly synonomous terms) are 'controlled' (i.e., one term is chosen as the<br>
approved term to use and the others are referred to it) and ambiguous terms<br>
are clarified; where the relationships between terms are established in<br>
broad term/narrow term and related term relationships; where definitions and<br>
explanations of use are available, if necessary. Such a set of controlled<br>
keywords or thesaurus terms is used to represent the content of the objects<br>
in the database (e.g., datasets or documents).<br>
<p>
This set of terms is usually available to describe the database items<br>
without specific links to broader categories or discipline groups. The link<br>
between a category or discipline and controlled keywords or thesaurus terms<br>
is made at the time of retrieval (post-coordination) rather than a priori<br>
(pre-coordindation). In other words, to describe a data set one would choose<br>
one or more broad categories for the data and several controlled keywords to<br>
describe the content. At retrieval, the user could make the match between<br>
the cateories (disciplines) of interest and the controlled keywords of<br>
interest or could simply search by the controlled keywords.<br>
<p>
The notion of uncontrolled keywords can work in two ways. First, terms and<br>
phrases can be added to the data set record to augment the description<br>
contained in the summary or abstract. [The assumption is made that all of<br>
the words of the summary, title, and 'controlled keywords' are available to<br>
be searched as 'free text' - essentially the same as uncontrolled keywords.]<br>
These terms are created as needed; it is difficult to impose any syntax<br>
controls on them since they are created at the time of the creation of the<br>
record.<br>
<p>
The second way to incorporate 'uncontrolled keywords' into the scheme is to<br>
use them as references to the controlled keywords so that DIF creators are<br>
instructed to use an approved form of the term instead and searchers are<br>
informed of the decision to use another form of the term or automatically<br>
switched to the approved form. This is called 'lead in' vocabulary to<br>
thesaurus terminology.<br>
<p>
My recommendation for the GCMD is to <br>
1. Establish Discipline categories as needed. Three have been proposed.<br>
2. Establish a set of 'controlled keywords' that can be used to describe the<br>
data sets. Treat this list like a thesaurus with links between terms and<br>
with definitions and notes of usage as needed. Use the NISO thesaurus<br>
standard as a guide.<br>
3. Permit the use of 'uncontrolled keywords' as needed to augment the title,<br>
summary and controlled keywords.<br>
4. Do not try to 'cross validate' or link controlled keywords with<br>
discipline categories or uncontrolled keywords. Let these relationships be<br>
dynamic and discoverable at the time of retrieval.<br>
5.Provide a retrieval system where searchers can use the controlled<br>
terminology and the free text of the metadata records alone or in<br>
combination to meet their needs for precision or recall in finding data<br>
sets. (There are many techniques that have been developed for using thesauri<br>
to help in retrieval. I would be glad to demonstrate or describe some of these.)<br>
<p>
An overall recommendation is to be very careful about making the controlled<br>
vocabulary scheme overly complicated and needing a lot of maintenance to<br>
keep it up-to-date and responsive to changing terminology and topic structure.<br>
<p>
I invite you to have a look at the NASA thesaurus that was put online as a<br>
test a year or so back. The URL is <a href="http://www.sti.nasa.gov">http://www.sti.nasa.gov</a> and choose 'NASA<br>
Thesaurus'. <br>

Dear Readers of the Interoperability Listserver,<br>
<p>
	In order to better serve our users, the GCMD staff is proposing a<br>
modification to the current Earth science location keywords.  The new list<br>
improves upon the old (see Directory Interchange Format Manual, 1993, p. <br>
D-3) by adding locations, especially ocean locations, but also such<br>
locations as Middle East and Southeast Asia.  Ocean locations were chosen<br>
by identifying those bodies of water with a surface area greater than<br>
100,000 square miles (Hammond Atlas of the World, 1992).  Please comment<br>
on the usefulness of the proposed locations, and suggest additional<br>
locations.  Keep in mind that this list includes location words pertaining<br>
to solid earth, atmosphere, and ocean depth, in addition to traditional<br>
geographic words of major areas. <br>

        Reply to:   RE&gt;INTEROP: GCMD keyword structure<br>
<p>
I've completed my SEB assignment, so ought to be able to respond in a more<br>
timely manner now.<br>
<p>
I have a few thought on the proposal at hand, as follows.<br>
<p>
The purpose of " DISCIPLINE, SUBDISCIPLINE, PARAMETER GROUP, PARAMETER,<br>
TOPICS, CONTROLLED KEYWORDS, etc." (that is, reference words) is to organize a<br>
mass of data/papers/data sets/etc. into manageable, searchable subgroups, and<br>
to try to assure that the searcher has a good chance of finding the pertinent<br>
information with a marked reduction in extraneous hits and a minimum of misses<br>
of pertinent information.  Symbols could be used as well, except for the<br>
natural associations generated by carefully chosen reference words.<br>
<p>
Computers are essentially dumb beasties, and do not know that when you specify<br>
"datum", you would also be willing to accept its plural, "data".  That is why<br>
key words are chosen - to specify the exact symbol (word) and the exact<br>
spelling under which an entry may be found - because synonyms, mis-spellings,<br>
etc. will not find the desired entry.  Until free text search is readily and<br>
freely available, key words will be a necessary evil.<br>
<p>
I am therefore against "UNCONTROLLED KEYWORDS" for two reasons.  First, if<br>
they are uncontrolled, not as much thought will be put into their selection. <br>
Some enterers will select "uncontrolled" words which no one else will ever<br>
use, creating a jumble of reference words that may or may not be useful to the<br>
searcher.  Second, when "UNCONTROLLED KEYWORDS" are created, one, two or five<br>
years from now who will go back through the database to make sure that<br>
previous datasets get that new tag if it is appropriate?  And if not, how many<br>
datasets will the searcher miss by using the "new" word which he has every<br>
right to assume will capture the data he is interested in?<br>

Dear Interoplist Partcipant:<br>
<p>
<p>
PROPOSED CHANGES TO GCMD KEYWORD QUERY SCHEME <br>
  <br>
PRESENT SCHEME<br>
--------------<br>
An expanded list of keywords is proposed to enhance the current Global<br>
Change Master Directory (GCMD) database query scheme.  The current<br>
keyword structure consists of the following categories:<br>
  <br>
 DISCIPLINE (e.g. Earth Science) <br>
 SUBDISCIPLINE (e.g. Atmosphere)<br>
 PARAMETER GROUP (e.g. Atmospheric Composition)<br>
 PARAMETER (e.g. Carbon Dioxide)<br>
 <br>
Presently all of the keywords (disciplines, parameters, etc.) are<br>
"controlled" and are presented to the end-user and DIF writer as a<br>
list of "valid" keywords with cross-validation among the four<br>
categories (PARAMETERS are associated with a PARAMETER GROUP which is<br>
associated with a SUBDISCIPLINE which is associated with a<br>
DISCIPLINE).<br>
  <br>
  <br>
PROPOSED CHANGE<br>
--------------- <br>
The proposed change would:<br>
 <br>
 - Rename the four categories to:<br>
    <br>
   DISCIPLINE * Actually NO CHANGE except that we expect only 3 major <br>
                disciplines.  The DISCIPLINEs will be Earth Science,<br>
                Socio-Economics, and Space Science.<br>
  <br>
   TOPICS (e.g. Atmospheric Science)  *  This combines the former<br>
                                         SUBDISCIPLINE and PARAMETER<br>
                                         GROUP categories and is labeled<br>
                                         TOPICS.  <br>
<p>
 <br>
<p>
  <br>
   Earth Science Topics are:<br>
   -------------------------<br>
   Atmospheric Science<br>
   Biosphere<br>
   Hydrosphere<br>
   Land Surface<br>
   Ocean Science<br>
   Paleoscience Data<br>
   Radiance and Imagery<br>
   Solar Radiation<br>
   Solid Earth<br>
   Transient Phenomena<br>
   Potential Fields<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  <br>
  CONTROLLED KEYWORDS (e.g. Clouds) * This is the former PARAMETER category<br>
                                     with many changes incorprated. <br>
 <br>
  UNCONTROLLED KEYWORDS (e.g. Total Cloud Cover) * This is an<br>
                                      "uncontrolled" list of keywords<br>
                                      cross-validated with the<br>
                                      "controlled" keywords.<br>
 <br>
 - Retain the cross-validation scheme that presently exists.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 HIGHLIGHTS<br>
 ----------<br>
- Users can choose a DISCIPLINE (e.g. Earth Science) and go directly<br>
 to a list of CONTROLLED KEYWORDS (e.g. Clouds), or filter the list by<br>
 choosing a TOPIC (e.g. Atmospheric Science).<br>
  <br>
- Controlled keywords are presented if the user wishes to directly select from<br>
 the controlled (i.e. predefined or "valid") list.<br>
<p>
<p>
  <br>
  - The user can also choose to search a list of "uncontrolled" keywords<br>
  that are associated with the controlled keywords, but are searchable<br>
  as free text.<br>
  <br>
 - DIF writers are free to add any keyword that is appropriate for the<br>
 dataset being described.  Any new keywords will be added to the<br>
 growing thesaurus of "uncontrolled" keywords and will be maintained by<br>
 directory personnel.<br>
  <br>
 <br>
 <br>
  Over the past year, several groups have participated with the GCMD in<br>
  developing the expanded list of keywords.  Participants include<br>
  include the Version 0 Information Management System (IMS), the EOSDIS<br>
  DAACs, the EOS Science Processing Support Office (SPSO), the National<br>
  Biological Service (NBS), the Consortium for International Earth<br>
  Science Information Network (CIESIN), the National Snow and Ice Data<br>
  Center (NSIDC), and the German Climate Computer Center (DKRZ).  The<br>
  GCMD staff thanks these groups for their interest and assistance in<br>
  developing the keyword list.<br>
  <br>
 <br>
 ACCESS<br>
 ------ <br>
 The complete list of keywords is available on the GCMD Home Page at:<br>
   <br>
  <a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/</a>    <br>
  <br>

<p>
 <br>
  The lists on the Home Page include hypertext links between the<br>
  Controlled keywords and the Uncontrolled keywords and an area to leave<br>
  comments or add words.  The entire list of words is also available via<br>
  anonymous ftp:<br>
   <br>
  ftp gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov<br>
  cd /pub/md<br>
   <br>
   To obtain the file containing the Earth Science keywords:  <br>

        Reply to:   RE&gt;INTEROP: location keywords<br>
<p>
Not my area, so take my comments with a large grain of salt (from one of those<br>
seas if you wish).<br>
<p>
It seems to me that a quick search of the number of earth science references<br>
to bodies of water would be a better selection criterion than size.  Several<br>
of the near-east gulfs (Aden?), however small, probably have more impact (as a<br>
result of the Gulf War) than the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, or Caribbean<br>
Sea in terms of earth science.<br>

I saw Robbie Rand in Baltimore and she said that ASK now has a <br>
gazetteer from DMA.<br>

(A former UWG member was adamant that we use a gazetteer.)<br>

Not my area, so take my comments with a large grain of salt (from one of those<br>
seas if you wish).<br>
<p>
It seems to me that a quick search of the number of earth science references<br>
to bodies of water would be a better selection criterion than size.  Several<br>
of the near-east gulfs (Aden?), however small, probably have more impact (as a<br>
result of the Gulf War) than the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, or Caribbean<br>
Sea in terms of earth science.<br>

Dear Readers of the Interoperability Listserver,<br>
<p>
	In order to better serve our users, the GCMD staff is proposing a<br>
modification to the current Earth science location keywords.  The new list<br>
improves upon the old (see Directory Interchange Format Manual, 1993, p. <br>
D-3) by adding locations, especially ocean locations, but also such<br>
locations as Middle East and Southeast Asia.  Ocean locations were chosen<br>
by identifying those bodies of water with a surface area greater than<br>
100,000 square miles (Hammond Atlas of the World, 1992).  Please comment<br>
on the usefulness of the proposed locations, and suggest additional<br>
locations.  Keep in mind that this list includes location words pertaining<br>
to solid earth, atmosphere, and ocean depth, in addition to traditional<br>
geographic words of major areas. <br>

Does anyone have an updated URL for ASK?  My latest is <br>
<a href="http://www.esdim.noaa.gov:8080">http://www.esdim.noaa.gov:8080</a>, but this one has not worked in quite a <br>
while.  I would like to look at their DMA gazetteer.  Maybe their list <br>
includes some bodies of water which we left out (or provides a better <br>
definition of which bodies of water to include).<br>

Told you it wasn't my area, and you have just proved it!  What's up with the<br>
sea ice of the Sea of Okhotsk?<br>
<p>
Never-the-less, I think it demonstrates my point - that investigator interest<br>
is more important than size.<br>

I took a part in last CEOS meeting and IDN splinter meeting held at Hotel<br>
Herio Cavara.<br>
I felt a deep impression about IDN activity.<br>
<p>
So, I am sorry but it is the first time to talk and send the question to<br>
this ML.<br>
I have a very simple or foundamental question about DIF proposal.<br>
There are 3 DIF proposals so far and DIF items increased.<br>
But I do not know what is the directory information.<br>
Now, the DIF is very detail and has many information.<br>
But, I wonder how we should add items?<br>
There are so many parts of research regions of earth science and we need<br>
many items.<br>
But, If we do not unify the method of adding items, we will confuse to deal<br>
with them.<br>
<p>
I also work for CINTEX. <br>
So, I have another wondering the distinguish of directory and inventory.<br>
How about you thinking of IDN-work and CINTEX-work.<br>
Each works will aim to nearly same purpose, I think.<br>
So, can we divid into each works clearly? or can we unify each works some day??<br>
If we lose these concept or thought, I think we go into a labyrinth...<br>
<p>
Anyway, I would like to hear about the consept about how to increase DIF items..<br>
Are there somebody else teach me??<br>
<p>
But we agree with all of proposals.<br>
<p>
Thanks and Best regards.<br>

Hello All,<br>
<p>
For those DIF writers who have not seen the FORMS based DIF Authoring <br>
Tool, you can get to it from the GLOBAL CHANGE MASTER DIRECTORY <br>
DOCUMENTATION selection off our home-page (<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov</a>) or <br>
use the URL:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/mduser_dir/dif_template.html">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/mduser_dir/dif_template.html</a><br>
<p>
With the form you can create a simple DIF, e-mail it to yourself, <br>
or e-mail it to the GCMD if you wish.  The form does not handle multiple <br>
data centers or personnel but these can be added to the text version <br>
e-mailed to the author.<br>

Hi Sue,<br>
Can you tell me how you were conducting your search?  I did a search for <br>
your DIFs by choosing the Data_Center field, looking up the valid for <br>
JPL/PODAAC and submitting a query...I got back 39 hits, all from PODAAC.<br>
Were any DIFs missing??<br>
<p>
Thanks!<br>

Interop Group - I have used the Web interface to search the<br>
GCMD for NSIDC's data descriptions, and have found all that I<br>
would expect to find, using parameters, locations, and sensors<br>
that I would expect to use.  I have also retrieved all the NSIDC<br>
descriptions by entering only "nsidc" as the center name.<br>
<p>
Sue Digby and I just talked about this by phone, and tested some<br>
things online as we talked.  I was able to obtain the descriptions<br>
of JPL data sets that Sue was looking for, so she is going to continue <br>
testing.  -Claire Hanson<br>

To anyone who uses the DIF manual<br>
<p>
I wanted to communicate to anyone who uses the DIF manual Version 4.0, dated<br>
December 1991, that an error was encountered.<br>
<p>
On page A-6 with title "A.3 Field Syntax", at the bottom of the page, there is<br>
a description of the syntax of the Dataset_ID that looks like this:<br>
<p>

<p>
After analyzing the difs and the database, the correct syntax should be:<br>
<p>

Dear Readers of the INTEROP Listserver,<br>
<p>
Recently, the GCMD staff has received some feedback from the CEOS IDN<br>
nodes (most notably from Hartwig Schroeter at DFD/DLR in Germany) about<br>
the applicability of the term "data center."  Technological advances have<br>
altered the traditional concept of a "data center" as a centrally-held<br>
repository for data.  As more and more electronic systems become available<br>
online, data can be accessed by various means from many sources across the<br>
Internet.  For example, a traditional data center may offer several<br>
different "information systems" which allow online access to the<br>
centrally-held data.  Distributed systems are another example of how data<br>
may be accessed electronically. <br>
<p>
We are asking the Interoperability community for their comments on the<br>
usefulness of the term "data center" in light of a changing technology.<br>
Some believe that the term "information system" better conveys the way<br>
data is now being made available.  Others, however, believe that the term<br>
"information system" is beginning to have negative connotations.  Still<br>
others prefer the term "data provider" or "data distributor." <br>
<p>
Please comment on the following points:<br>
1.  Should the term "data center" be used in the DIF? <br>
2.  If not, what term should be used?  (e.g. information system, data <br>
provider, data distributor, data distribution site, etc.)<br>
3.  Should a new DIF field be created for online data access systems,<br>
perhaps as a new field grouped under the "data center" field?  What name<br>
should this subgroup have? (e.g. information system, data access system,<br>
etc.)  Should there be more than one of these subgroups, each conveying <br>
information about online access? (e.g. FTP server address, URL, Telnet <br>
address, etc.) <br>
4.  Should there be no changes at all? <br>
<p>
Send comments to interop@gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov<br>

Thank you for considering this matter.<br>

I think the term 'information system' is a good one, and does not have any<br>
negative connotations to me.  A new DIF field for on-line data access would<br>
be a good idea.<br>

So, like Ron Vogel was saying to me just the other day:<br>
<i>&gt; 1.  Should the term "data center" be used in the DIF? </i><br>
<p>
It's only my opinion, of course, but I think "data center" is<br>
sufficiently generic to cover all types of archival-type operations,<br>
on-line or otherwise.  The term "information system" tends to be far<br>
more specific, relating in particular to on-line data and/or metadata,<br>
and to a particular interface (or user interaction paradigm) in<br>
particular.  The GCMD is an information system.  The NSSDC is not,<br>
although they have built several information systems internally.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2.  If not, what term should be used?  (e.g. information system, data </i><br>
<i>&gt; provider, data distributor, data distribution site, etc.)</i><br>
<p>
Why change?  Everyone knows what a data center is.  We could use the<br>
something else, like "archive" but, in general, they all seem to mean<br>
the same thing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3.  Should a new DIF field be created for online data access systems,</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps as a new field grouped under the "data center" field?  What name</i><br>
<i>&gt; should this subgroup have? (e.g. information system, data access system,</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc.)  Should there be more than one of these subgroups, each conveying </i><br>
<i>&gt; information about online access? (e.g. FTP server address, URL, Telnet </i><br>
<i>&gt; address, etc.) </i><br>
<i>&gt; 4.  Should there be no changes at all? </i><br>
<p>
This is a more interesting idea.  A URL field would probably be<br>
sufficient, either by pointing to some general entry point (like the top<br>
of the FTP server directory tree) or to the data set specifically<br>
described by the DIF, where available.  There's certainly some need to<br>
identify and retrieve DIFs for only on-line datasets.<br>

I agree with Archie Warnock, the Data_Center concept and terminology should <br>
be left as it is - it does the job.<br>
<p>
As far as the introduction of URL fields goes, these are covered<br>
in the proposals for DIF changes from the GCMD - I include the relavent <br>
section below :-<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
   <br>
                        DIF CHANGES FOR FGDC COMPLIANCE<br>
                                       <br>
   The GCMD has proposed some additions/modifications to the Directory<br>
   Interchange Format (DIF) data structure in order to facilitate our<br>
   compliance with the new federally-mandated FGDC Metadata Content<br>
   standard. We believe that adding this information will assist Earth<br>
   science users in locating data.<br>
   <br>
   The following 10 items are proposed to meet compliance with the new<br>
   FGDC Metadata Standard. These may not apply to all data sets and<br>
   therefore are not required. Syntax, definitions, and examples are<br>
   included.<br>
<p>
		--------- snip --------   <br>
   Definition<br>
       <br>
       Data_center_URL - the Internet Uniform Resource Locator of the<br>
       data center. This field may be repeated as many times as necessary<br>
       within the data center group. These may include gopher and ftp as<br>
       well as WWW servers.<br>
       <br>
       Examples<br>
       <br>
<p>
Data_Center_URL: <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov">http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov</a><br>
Data_Center_URL: <a href="ftp://seazar.jpl.nasa.gov">ftp://seazar.jpl.nasa.gov</a><br>

         Reply to:   RE&gt;INTEROP: comments on data center field<br>
<p>
I agree with Archie, for the most part, with some additional comments and some<br>
different reasoning.<br>
<p>
1.  Should the term "data center" be used in the DIF? <br>
<p>
I think "data center" is sufficiently generic to cover all types of<br>
archival-type operations, on-line or otherwise.  The term "information system"<br>
tends to be far more specific, relating more to "build", "organization" and<br>
recovery engines/particular interfaces (or user interaction paradigm).<br>
<p>
Additionally, "data center" also implies an entity responsible for the<br>
organization, proper representation and 'validation' of the data/metadata. <br>
When 'everyone' is responsible, no one is, and the database/archive begins its<br>
deterioration.  Decentralize input/interaction if you want, but keep<br>
responsibility centralized!  If you need a new term for the dispersed units,<br>
"data provider" is a good term, but those 'disbursed' unit should be<br>
subservient to a "data center".<br>
<p>
2.  If not, what term should be used?  (e.g. information system, data <br>
provider, data distributor, data distribution site, etc.)<br>
<p>
Why change?  Everyone knows what a data center is.<br>
<p>
3.  Should a new DIF field be created for online data access systems,<br>
perhaps as a new field grouped under the "data center" field?  What name<br>
should this subgroup have? (e.g. information system, data access system,<br>
etc.)  Should there be more than one of these subgroups, each conveying <br>
information about online access? (e.g. FTP server address, URL, Telnet <br>
address, etc.) <br>
4.  Should there be no changes at all? <br>
<p>
This is interesting.  An identification of the data provider in a field, and a<br>
URL field would probably be sufficient.<br>

         Reply to:   RE&gt;INTEROP: comments on data center field<br>
<p>
I agree with Archie, for the most part, with some additional comments and some<br>
different reasoning.<br>
<p>
1.  Should the term "data center" be used in the DIF? <br>
<p>
I think "data center" is sufficiently generic to cover all types of<br>
archival-type operations, on-line or otherwise.  The term "information system"<br>
tends to be far more specific, relating more to "build", "organization" and<br>
recovery engines/particular interfaces (or user interaction paradigm).<br>
<p>
Additionally, "data center" also implies an entity responsible for the<br>
organization, proper representation and 'validation' of the data/metadata. <br>
When 'everyone' is responsible, no one is, and the database/archive begins its<br>
deterioration.  Decentralize input/interaction if you want, but keep<br>
responsibility centralized!  If you need a new term for the dispersed units,<br>
"data provider" is a good term, but those 'disbursed' unit should be<br>
subservient to a "data center".<br>
<p>
2.  If not, what term should be used?  (e.g. information system, data <br>
provider, data distributor, data distribution site, etc.)<br>
<p>
Why change?  Everyone knows what a data center is.<br>
<p>
3.  Should a new DIF field be created for online data access systems,<br>
perhaps as a new field grouped under the "data center" field?  What name<br>
should this subgroup have? (e.g. information system, data access system,<br>
etc.)  Should there be more than one of these subgroups, each conveying <br>
information about online access? (e.g. FTP server address, URL, Telnet <br>
address, etc.) <br>
4.  Should there be no changes at all? <br>
<p>
This is interesting.  An identification of the data provider in a field, and a<br>
URL field would probably be sufficient.<br>

Dear Readers of the INTEROP Listserver,<br>
<p>
Recently, the GCMD staff has received some feedback from the CEOS IDN<br>
nodes (most notably from Hartwig Schroeter at DFD/DLR in Germany) about<br>
the applicability of the term "data center."  Technological advances have<br>
altered the traditional concept of a "data center" as a centrally-held<br>
repository for data.  As more and more electronic systems become available<br>
online, data can be accessed by various means from many sources across the<br>
Internet.  For example, a traditional data center may offer several<br>
different "information systems" which allow online access to the<br>
centrally-held data.  Distributed systems are another example of how data<br>
may be accessed electronically. <br>
<p>
We are asking the Interoperability community for their comments on the<br>
usefulness of the term "data center" in light of a changing technology.<br>
Some believe that the term "information system" better conveys the way<br>
data is now being made available.  Others, however, believe that the term<br>
"information system" is beginning to have negative connotations.  Still<br>
others prefer the term "data provider" or "data distributor." <br>
<p>
Please comment on the following points:<br>
1.  Should the term "data center" be used in the DIF? <br>
2.  If not, what term should be used?  (e.g. information system, data <br>
provider, data distributor, data distribution site, etc.)<br>
3.  Should a new DIF field be created for online data access systems,<br>
perhaps as a new field grouped under the "data center" field?  What name<br>
should this subgroup have? (e.g. information system, data access system,<br>
etc.)  Should there be more than one of these subgroups, each conveying <br>
information about online access? (e.g. FTP server address, URL, Telnet <br>
address, etc.) <br>
4.  Should there be no changes at all? <br>

Comments from GRID-Warsaw (only the under-signed opinion expresed):<br>
<p>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Please comment on the following points:<br>
1.  Should the term "data center" be used in the DIF?<br>
2.  If not, what term should be used?  (e.g. information system, data<br>
provider, data distributor, data distribution site, etc.)<br>
<p>
In fact it does not matter which one we choose. Considering the data<br>
is stored in the same physical place but only in different systems,<br>
the term "data centre" seems OK for me to remain.<br>
<p>
3.  Should a new DIF field be created for online data access systems,<br>
perhaps as a new field grouped under the "data center" field?  What name<br>
should this subgroup have? (e.g. information system, data access system,<br>
etc.)  Should there be more than one of these subgroups, each conveying<br>
information about online access? (e.g. FTP server address, URL, Telnet<br>
address, etc.)<br>
4.  Should there be no changes at all?<br>
<p>
I think including only URL (as it was suggested) is not enough. From<br>
the users in developing countries point of view (or even the countries<br>
with economy in transition, as Poland) it is important to have other<br>
systems included (as WWW is not yet widely popular there). - Especially<br>
addresses for the basic Internet services (i.e. FTP, Telnet, E-mail)<br>
So personally I am for sub-fields in Data_Centre group constructed<br>
as follow:<br>
<p>
FTP&gt;    <a href="ftp://ftp.host.address/full/path/access">ftp://ftp.host.address/full/path/access</a>         (optional)<br>
Telnet&gt; <a href="telnet://remote.host.address">telnet://remote.host.address</a> userid password    (optional)<br>
URL&gt;    <a href="http://www.server.address/full/path/access">http://www.server.address/full/path/access</a>      (optional)<br>
E-mail&gt; man-in-charge-name@domain.host.adrress          (optional, useful<br>
                                                         when on-line access<br>
                                                         is not available)<br>
<p>
Now it seems to me that the sub-field names can be ommited and the<br>
four addresses put in one Data_Centre_Group, but I am getting the<br>
experience in DIFs so I am not sure about constriction rules.<br>

 <br>
Actually, although the concept of URL (Universal Resource Locator) *comes* <br>
from WWW, it *refers* to several types of on-line resources other than WWW. <br>
Thus ftp, telnet, www, email, WAIS can all be described with URLs and used as <br>
such within a WWW environment. The above would then be written as :-<br>
<p>
URL:    <a href="ftp://ftp.host.address/full/path">ftp://ftp.host.address/full/path</a><br>
URL:	<a href="telnet://remote.host.address">telnet://remote.host.address</a> <br>
URL:    <a href="http://www.server.address/full/path">http://www.server.address/full/path</a><br>
URL: 	<a href="mailto://man-in-charge-name@domain.host.adrress">mailto://man-in-charge-name@domain.host.adrress</a>                  <br>
<p>
Users without WWW can still refer to these to obtain an email address, for <br>
example.                                            <br>

<i>&gt;From Paul Kuin (Astronomical Data Center, NASA)</i><br>
<p>
I agree with the comments made by Archie Warnock. In my past <br>
experience as MD Astronomy Coordinator, the use of this field has <br>
encompassed a large variety of "DATA CENTERS". The term in generic <br>
enough and well enough understood by those who use english less <br>
frequently. Also, there is a definite need to add URL's to ACCESS <br>
POINTS to the data. Perhaps Universal Names would be preferable. <br>
These access points can be anything from a simple ordering/question <br>
desk (form) to access to an underlying inventory to access to <br>
a full-blown data analyses system. It is noteworthy that some data<br>
centers have multiple access points, often different access points<br>
for different data. Any additions to the data center field in the <br>
DIF should provide enough clarity to make appropriate choices.<br>
<p>
I propose a new repeatable sub group of the data_center group:<br>
<p>
  Group: Access_Point   (repeatable)<br>
    NAME: (a one-line description of the access point)<br>
    DATA_CENTER: ( the pointer to the directory description of the <br>
           access point. Current practice is to call these "DATA CENTER"  <br>
           too, and provide a description as supplimentary information.)<br>
    URL: <a href="http://www.somewhere.org/order_this_data.html">http://www.somewhere.org/order_this_data.html</a> (the pointer to<br>
           the WWW site/ FTP site/telnet access/etc. which provides the <br>
           access point.<br>
    UN:  (here we put the universal name - I don't know the <br>
          appropriate format)<br>
    Dataset_ID: (optional data centre name_of_dataset )<br>
    Dataset_ID: (this is a repeatable repeatable field )<br>
  End_Group<br>
<p>
There is also a relation between the DATASET_ID and the access points.<br>
Since the DATASET may be accessible trough all or only a few access <br>
points, I would propose that the DATASET_ID can also appear in the <br>
main DATA_CENTER group as now. In addition, in our archive, similar <br>
catalogs have a similar naming convention and I would like to use a <br>
wildcard character in the designation of the dataset ID. I used a dot <br>
(".") for each symbol that may have any value a-zA-Z0-9_ which is for <br>
illustation purposes. <br>
<p>
For example:<br>
<p>
Group: Data_Center<br>
   Data_Center_Name: Astronomical Data Center <br>
   DataSet_ID: ADC_POINTER1<br>
  Group: Data_Center_Contact<br>
    ... We desire to add a URL here too:<br>
    URL: <a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/request">http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/request</a>[B.html<br>
    ...<br>
  End_Group<br>
  Group: Access_Point   <br>
    NAME: ADC FTP archive of astronomical catalogs of positional data <br>
    DATA_CENTER: ADC<br>
    URL: <a href="ftp://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/adc/archives/catalogs/1/">ftp://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/adc/archives/catalogs/1/</a><br>
    Dataset_ID: 1...<br>
    Dataset_ID: 1...a<br>
    Dataset_ID: 1...b<br>
  End_Group<br>
  <br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
Comments are welcome. <br>

Dear Readers of the Interop and CEOSIDN Listservers:<br>
<p>
Several months ago, the GCMD staff posted a proposal through the Listserver <br>
requesting modifications to the current keyword scheme.  Since that time, we <br>
have received comments on this proposal and have prepared a revised version<br>
incorporating some suggestions that were made.  We are re-submitting this<br>
proposal for a final round of discussion before sending it out for<br>
majority consensus.<br>
<p>
A summary of comments and corresponding responses to the original proposal<br>
is included as Appendix A.  Please note that the history of the <br>
ListServer communications are available as an archive through the URL:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/mduser_dir/interop-archive.html">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/mduser_dir/interop-archive.html</a><br>
  <br>
Please also note that those DIFs identified ONLY with the space<br>
sciences have been moved to the NASA Master Directory<br>
(<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmd/nmd.html">http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmd/nmd.html</a>).  Those DIFs that overlap<br>
with the Earth sciences in any way remain in the Global Change Master<br>
Diretory.  We appreciate your taking the time and effort in<br>
participating in the Listserver activity.<br>
<p>
Best regards to all,<br>
<p>
<p>
Global Change Master Directory Staff<br>
<p>
===========================================================================<br>
<p>
                       DIFOP Listserver Proposal #5<br>
                   CHANGES TO GCMD KEYWORD QUERY SCHEME <br>
              ----------------------------------------------     <br>
<p>
<p>
To meet the changing needs of the user community and the future<br>
demands on the directory, the Global Change Master Directory staff are<br>
proposing a new keyword structure and improved keywords.  The current<br>
keyword structure was designed and implemented over eight years ago to<br>
meet the needs of NASA and the space science community.  After the<br>
Global Change Master Directory became part of the Global Change Data<br>
Center (GCDC), the increasing needs of the Earth science community as<br>
well as the Internet community at large, are specifically being addressed.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
1. SUMMARY OF PROPOSED CHANGES<br>
------------------------------ <br>
The proposed changes will modify the hierarchy, the naming<br>
conventions, and content for the current DISCIPLINE, SUBDISCIPLINE,<br>
PARAMETER GROUP, and PARAMETER fields.  They are proposed to be<br>
renamed as follows:<br>
 <br>
The SUBDISCIPLINE, PARAMETER GROUP and PARAMETER fields are to be<br>
replaced by the new descriptors TOPIC, TERM, and VARIABLE,<br>
respectively.<br>
<p>
In addition, new descriptors of Earth science TOPIC, TERM, and<br>
VARIABLE are being proposed. See:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/keywords/tempk/v30_earth.html">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/keywords/tempk/v30_earth.html</a> for a complete<br>
listing of Earth science descriptors.<br>
<p>
The entire list of descriptors is also available via anonymous ftp:<br>
  ftp gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov<br>
  cd /pub/md<br>
<p>
  To obtain the file containing the Earth Science keywords:<br>
  get v30_earth.html<br>
<p>
  To obtain the file containing the Socioeconomic keywords:<br>
  get v28_socio.html<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The proposed hierarchy will be modified from:<br>
<p>
DISCIPLINE<br>
   SUBDISCIPLINE<br>
PARAMETER GROUP<br>
   PARAMETER<br>
<p>
To: <br>
<p>
DISCIPLINE<br>
   TOPIC<br>
     TERM<br>
       VARIABLE<br>
<p>
<p>
DISCIPLINE<br>
----------<br>
DISCIPLINE field will retain the same function as the current<br>
DISCIPLINE field, EXCEPT that now there will only be two DISCIPLINEs<br>
(Earth Science and Socioeconomics) that may be used for searching the<br>
database. Space-related DIFs (Astronomy, Space Physics, Planetary<br>
Science) have been transitioned to the NASA Master Directory (NMD) at<br>
NSSDC.  The user interface will provide a direct link to the NMD for<br>
those users wishing to search for space-related data and information.<br>
<p>
<p>
TOPIC<br>
-----<br>
TOPICs will consist of broad areas within Earth Sciences. The following<br>
TOPICs are proposed:<br>
<p>
Atmospheric Science<br>
Biosphere<br>
Charged Particles<br>
Hydrosphere<br>
Land Surface<br>
Ocean Science<br>
Paleoclimate<br>
Radiance and Imagery<br>
Solar Radiation<br>
Solid Earth<br>
Transient Phenomena<br>
Potential Fields<br>
Engineering Instruments/Parameters<br>
<p>
<p>
TERM<br>
----<br>
TERMs will consist of descriptors associated with each TOPIC.  For example,<br>
under the TOPIC, "Atmospheric Science", 14 TERMs are proposed:<br>
       Aerosols<br>
       Air Quality<br>
       Altitude<br>
       Atmospheric Pressure<br>
       Atmospheric Temperature<br>
       Clouds<br>
       Evaporation<br>
       Greenhouse Gases<br>
       Atmospheric Heat Budget<br>
       Lightning<br>
       Precipitation<br>
       Trace Gases<br>
       Water Vapor<br>
       Winds<br>
<p>
<p>
VARIABLE<br>
--------<br>
VARIABLEs will consist of measurements or descriptors associated with<br>
each TERM.  For example, under the TERM "Aerosols", there are<br>
presently 8 VARIABLEs; however, as new data sets are added, additional<br>
variables will be included in the GCMD.<br>
<p>
VARIABLEs:<br>
        Ash<br>
        Aerosol Extinction<br>
        Aerosol Extinction Profiles<br>
        Dust<br>
        Dust Veil Index<br>
        Tephra<br>
        Volcanic Ash<br>
        Volcanic Dust<br>
       <br>
<p>
<p>
2. USAGE SCENARIOS<br>
------------------<br>
Scenario 1: The Hierarchical Approach to Searching<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
A user will be able to select keywords from a pre-defined list of<br>
Earth science TOPICs.<br>
<p>
After a TOPIC is selected, the user may then select valid keywords<br>
from a list of pre-defined TERMs that are dependent on the TOPIC<br>
chosen.<br>
<p>
After a TERM is selected, the user may then select more detailed<br>
keywords from a list of VARIABLEs that are dependent on the TERM<br>
chosen.<br>
<p>
<p>
Scenario 2: The Direct Approach to Searching<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
The user will be able to select keywords from the TOPIC, TERM, or<br>
VARIABLE list WITHOUT going through the hierarchy.  A user may select<br>
a valid keyword from the TERM list without first selecting a TOPIC.<br>
In this case, all of the TERM keywords will be available.<br>
<p>
The user may also choose to ignore TOPIC and TERM and just choose to<br>
select from the list of VARIABLEs.  In this case, all of the VARIABLEs<br>
will be available to the user.  However, there is a danger that the<br>
user may overlook data sets with the same basic measurement,<br>
therefore, this approach is not recommended.  Choosing only from TERMs<br>
will not create the same danger.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. IMPACT ON DIF WRITERS<br>
------------------------<br>
An added feature to this modification will be the ability for DIF<br>
writers to add their own VARIABLEs to the VARIABLE list where they see<br>
fit.  When the DIF is loaded into the database, validation software<br>
will check the VARIABLE for duplication and spelling and add that<br>
VARIABLE to the database. The user will then be able to find that DIF<br>
(or DIFs) using the recently added VARIABLE.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. MODIFICATION OF CURRENT DIFs<br>
-------------------------------<br>
Software will be developed to automatically map the current<br>
SUBDISCIPLINE, PARAMETER GROUP, and PARAMETER keywords to the new<br>
TOPIC, TERM, and VARIABLE keywords.  This software will be made<br>
available for anyone who wishes to convert their DIFs to the new<br>
structure.<br>
<p>
The GCMD science coordinators will also manually review each DIF in<br>
the system and will repopulate DIFs with new descriptors that couldn't<br>
be automatically mapped.  Coordinators will use currently available<br>
DIF writing/validation tools (such as DIFmacs) to assist in the effort.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. SOFTWARE RELEASE<br>
-------------------<br>
Software will be made available as part of a system release after all<br>
of the changes have been made and thoroughly tested.<br>
<p>
<p>
6. ACKNOWLEDGMENT<br>
------------------ <br>
Over the past year, several groups have participated with the GCMD in<br>
developing the expanded list of keywords.  Participants include the<br>
Version 0 Information Management System (IMS), the EOSDIS DAACs, the<br>
EOS Science Processing Support Office (SPSO), the National Biological<br>
Service (NBS), the Consortium for International Earth Science<br>
Information Network (CIESIN), the National Snow and Ice Data Center<br>
(NSIDC), NOAA/NODC, NOAA/NGDC, and the German Climate Computer Center<br>
(DKRZ).  The GCMD staff thanks these groups for their interest and<br>
assistance in developing the keyword lists.<br>

APPENDIX A<br>
<p>
Comments and Response Summary from earlier List Server discussions<br>
during April - May 1995.<br>
<p>
Interop Listserver Proposal #5(A): Changes to GCMD Keyword Scheme<br>
<p>
Please keep in mind that these comments and responses apply to the<br>
original Keyword Change Proposal.  The original proposal terminology<br>
'controlled keywords' and 'uncontrolled keywords' has been replaced by<br>
'TERM' (controlled keywords) and 'VARIABLE' (uncontrolled keywords).<br>
<p>
A. Buffam:<br>
- Questioned how uncontrolled keywords ('VARIABLEs') would be updated <br>
(particularly within context of CEOS IDN DIF transfer procedures) and reviewed <br>
for accuracy, spelling, duplication.<br>
- Cited duplication examples (Atmospheric Dynamics, Temperature,<br>
  Temperature) in list.<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
Plans call for including an updated list of VARIABLEs (uncontrolled keywords)<br>
with DIFs transferred to CEOS IDN nodes.  This list will most likely be in the <br>
form of an SQL statement, which would be run before DIFs are loaded.  Thus <br>
all new VARIABLEs (uncontrolled keywords) would be entered into the IDN <br>
databases.  Software would ensure accuracy of spelling and non-replication <br>
of words.<br>
<p>
There is some unavoidable duplication in the keyword lists as words<br>
such as 'Temperature' may apply to more than one TOPIC. TOPICs<br>
and/or TERMs (controlled keywords) may be used to filter such<br>
duplicate keywords.<br>
<p>
<p>
P. Callahan:<br>
- Purpose of 'reference' keywords (e.g. DISCIPLINE, etc.) is to<br>
  organize [meta]data such that searcher has greatest potential for<br>
  retrieving pertinent information with minimum chance for missing such<br>
  information or retrieving extraneous information.<br>
- Therefore, uncontrolled keywords ('VARIABLEs') should not be used because:<br>
  1) not as much thought will be put into their selection, potentially <br>
  creating a 'jumble' of reference words that may or may not be useful to the <br>
  searcher, and 2) problem tagging previous data sets with potential for <br>
  users to miss information not tagged with 'new' (uncontrolled) words.<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
Plans have been discussed for developing a DIF normalizing process by<br>
which new VARIABLEs (uncontrolled keywords) could be checked against<br>
existing ones for the purpose of controlling the proliferation of<br>
variable names.  It was determined that revised data sets could be<br>
tagged with new VARIABLEs using this process to avoid the "jumble of<br>
reference words".  It is presumed that VARIABLEs will be used to<br>
specify measurable quantities.<br>
<p>
The VARIABLEs are to assist DIF writers (in addition to being<br>
searchable).  DIF writers will be able to add VARIABLEs that are not<br>
on the list of VARIABLEs. This will allow writers to check existing<br>
words and help avoid the proliferation of new variables.  These<br>
VARIABLEs will then be checked against existing VARIABLEs in the<br>
database.  Users (as opposed to DIF writers) will NOT be able to input<br>
VARIABLEs into the database. However, a mechanism for providing<br>
suggestions for new variables from users will be provided.<br>
<p>
J. Faundeen, S. Delaney:<br>
- Some time would be needed to incorporate changes.<br>
- Changes overall are positive.<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
Software will be made available in the next release which will incorporate <br>
these changes.  The GCMD will assist in the DIF updating process.<br>
<p>
<p>
P. Grimm:<br>
- Questions the need for linking disciplines to keywords citing <br>
  unnecessary complexity; does not expect searches to be conducted on <br>
  broad scope of discipline, subdiscipline, parameter groups.  Combining <br>
  former subdiscipline and parameter groups does not alleviate problem.<br>
- New keyword list is OK; however, 'transient phenomena' and 'potential <br>
  fields' are ambiguous.  'Paleoscience data' is only topic with word <br>
  'data'.<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
DISCIPLINE and SUBDISCIPLINE fields are currently used to filter<br>
PARAMETERs.  In the new structure, DISCIPLINE is a "given" and<br>
therefore no search is expected to be conducted on that broad<br>
scope. TOPICs will be used to filter TERMs and VARIABLEs (as<br>
DISCIPLINE and SUBDISCIPLINE fields are currently used).  A user may<br>
skip the filters and proceed directly to the keywords.<br>
<p>
The TOPICs 'transient phenomena' and 'potential fields' may at first<br>
appear to be ambiguous; however, a perusal of the TERMs and VARIABLEs<br>
associated with those TOPICs will show that the keywords have been<br>
analyzed in depth.  Suggestions for changing specific keywords needs<br>
majority concensus and should be offered as in the form of a proposal<br>
to the entire group.<br>
<p>
The TOPIC 'Paleoscience Data' was re-named 'Paleoscience'.<br>
<p>
<p>
L. Hill: - Scheme does not go far enough toward freeing system from limiting <br>
structure of precoordinating and concepts.  <br>
- Recommendations:<br>
1. Establish Discipline categories as needed. Three have been proposed.  <br>
2. Establish a set of 'controlled keywords' that can be used to describe <br>
   the data sets. Treat this list like a thesaurus with links between terms <br>
   and with definitions and notes of usage as needed. Use the NISO thesaurus <br>
   standard as a guide.  <br>
3. Permit the use of 'uncontrolled keywords' as needed to augment the title, <br>
   summary and controlled keywords.  <br>
4. Do not try to 'cross validate' or link controlled keywords with disci-<br>
   pline categories or uncontrolled keywords. Let these relationships be <br>
   dynamic and discoverable at the time of retrieval.  <br>
5. Provide a retrieval system where searchers can use the controlled <br>
   terminology and the free text of the metadata records alone or in combina-<br>
   tion to meet their needs for precision or recall in finding data sets.  <br>
6. An overall recommendation is to be very careful about making the <br>
   controlled vocabulary scheme overly complicated and needing a lot of <br>
   maintenance to keep it up-to-date and responsive to changing terminology <br>
   and topic structure.  <br>
- References NASA Thesaurus (<a href="http://www.sti.nasa.gov">http://www.sti.nasa.gov</a>).  <br>
<p>
Response: <br>
<p>
The first three recommendations have been incorporated into the<br>
proposed keyword structure.  There presently are two DISCIPLINEs<br>
proposed, 'EARTH SCIENCE' and 'SOCIOECONOMICS'.  The recommendation to<br>
treat the list as a thesaurus with linkages is being considered.  For<br>
recommendation 4, at this time we plan to retain the cross-validation<br>
(hierarchical) structure that currently exists and plan to apply the<br>
new keyword structure in a hierarchical manner.  Users DO NOT have to<br>
use this particular search method. For recommendation 5, we will be<br>
incorporating Z39.50 free-text searches with controlled DIF fields.<br>
Lastly, the proposed keyword structure was designed specifically to be<br>
simple and to retain the infrastructure of the current keyword scheme.<br>
The proposed keyword scheme was carefully considered and designed to<br>
minimize the impact on database maintenance requirements.<br>
<p>
G. Saxton:<br>
- Will the proposed changes require that we modify our existing DIFs in order<br>
  to conform to the new DIF "standard"?  Have you determined whether such<br>
  modifications could be done by automated processes (i.e., scripts)?  If so,<br>
  are you planning to provide such scripts to cooperating nodes?  If not (or<br>
  if not entirely), do you know how much, or in which situations, human<br>
  intervention would be required?<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
We plan on having automated mapping software that will map the old<br>
PARAMETER GROUP &gt; PARAMETER to the new scheme.  This software will be<br>
provided for your own (non-GCMD) DIFs.  There will be human<br>
interaction, at least on the part of GCMD staff, to manually update<br>
ALL of the DIFs in the GCMD database after the automapping process is<br>
complete.  This will include updating the CEOS IDN node DIFs that are<br>
in the GCMD.  The manual updating will be a necessary step to ensure<br>
that each DIF is properly populated with the new keywords. This may<br>
mean replacing some keywords from the DIF 'Keyword' field with<br>
descriptors from TOPIC, TERM or VARIABLE or adding descriptors to<br>
each DIF from the new list. For the non-GCMD NOAA DIFs, the<br>
automapping software will, at a minimum, provide compatibility with<br>
the new scheme.<br>
<p>
G.Saxton<br>
- Will any of the proposed changes involve modifications to the underlying<br>
  Oracle database structure?  --to the associated software for serving,<br>
  loading, or maintaining the database?  --to the dictionary files used for<br>
  validating or loading DIF's?<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
Yes.  We are proposing to modify the database so that there will be a<br>
link (dependency) between what we are now calling 'TOPIC' and<br>
'Controlled Keywords' ('TERM') (analogous to the present link between<br>
'Subdiscipline' and 'Parameter Group').<br>
<p>
In the present scheme, there is dependency or hierarchy between<br>
DISCIPLINE and SUBDISCIPLINE and between PARAMETER GROUP and<br>
PARAMETER.  There is no dependent link between PARAMETER GROUP and<br>
SUBDISCIPLINE or DISCIPLINE (except through the de_id).<br>
<p>
In the Oracle database, however, DISCIPLINE &gt; SUBDISCIPLINE (the<br>
de_discipline table) and PARAMETER GROUP &gt; PARAMETER (the<br>
de_parameter table ) all share the DIF entry identifier ('de_id'),<br>
which ensures that at least one DIF will be found by the user no<br>
matter what combination of DISCIPLINE &gt; SUBDISCIPLINE and PARAMETER<br>
GROUP &gt; PARAMETER is selected.<br>
<p>
The user interface software all allow the user to ignore the hierarchy<br>
or dependency by allowing the user to choose to see all of the valid<br>
TERMs, for example, without choosing any of the other fields.  From<br>
the user point of view, nothing will change with the proposed scheme<br>
except the nomenclature and true linkages between TOPICs and TERMs.<br>
<p>
The proposal does call for a change in the way the new fields are<br>
linked in the database. There will still be a link between<br>
'DISCIPLINE' and 'TOPIC' (analogous to SUBDISCIPLINE).  And there will<br>
still be a link between TERM (controlled keywords) and VARIABLE<br>
(uncontrolled keywords) (analogous to 'PARAMETER GROUP&gt;PARAMETER').<br>
But now, there will also be a link between TOPIC and TERM (controlled<br>
keywords).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the user point of view, if the user selects 'Atmospheric Science'</i><br>
from the list of valid TOPICs, and then chooses the list of valid<br>
TERMs (controlled keywords), only those TERMs linked to the TOPIC<br>
'Atmospheric Science' will be shown.  The user, however, may choose to<br>
ignore TOPICs and go right to the list of valid TERMs; in which case<br>
ALL of them will appear.  This is still no different than what the<br>
user can do now.  The user will not be restricted to a hierarchy and<br>
will have the freedom to choose which field to start a search (as is<br>
done now).<br>
<p>
Any modifications to the system software, dictionary files, etc.  will<br>
be made available.<br>
<p>
G.Saxton<br>
- As you know, we use the DIF database as the source file from which we<br>
  extract information for gopher, WWW, and field-indexed WAIS servers.  Do <br>
  you think the proposed changes will require that we modify our procedures <br>
  for running these servers or maintaining their files?  Do you think we would<br>
  have to re-extract and re-generate the files for these servers?<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
The ONLY thing you would have to do is to re-index the collection of<br>
DIFs and make sure those new fields (DISCIPLINE, TOPIC, TERM<br>
(controlled keywords), VARIABLE (uncontrolled keywords) are included.<br>
Just replace 'SUBDISCIPLINE' with 'TOPIC'; 'PARAMETER GROUP' with<br>
'TERM'; and 'PARAMETERS' with 'VARIABLE').<br>
<p>
G.Saxton<br>
- As I look over the list of Earth Science keywords, I see that none of the<br>
  Topic terms have an asterisk.  Does this mean that *none* of them correspond<br>
  to existing subdiscipline terms?<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
We didn't put asterisks on them...most are replacing old SUBDISCIPLINEs<br>
and PARAMETER GROUPs...but we will add asterisks in the documentation<br>
to indicate which ones correspond to existing SUBDISCIPLINE terms.<br>
<p>
G.Saxton<br>
- All in all, I don't see very many asterisks.  Does this mean that most of<br>
  the existing Controlled Parameters are being replaced?  Is there a<br>
  one-for-one mapping for such replacements?  --for some of them, at least?<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
We have asterisks on all of the old PARAMETERs.  Some current PARAMETERs <br>
have been dropped.  Yes, there is a one-one mapping and it will be used as <br>
a basis for developing automapping software to map the old keywords to the <br>
new ones.  We have it as an Excel spreadsheet right now and could make it <br>
available.<br>
<p>
G.Saxton<br>
- It appears that the proposers are trying to place Earth Science parameters<br>
  into several distinct categories, but in my mind, many of these categories<br>
  overlap.  For example, is 'Hydrosphere' always distinct from 'Ocean<br>
  Science'?  Are 'Charged Particles' distinct from 'Solar Radiation'?<br>
  Shouldn't 'Marine Zoology' (listed under 'Ocean Science') sometimes be<br>
  considered a part of the 'Biosphere'?  My main concern here is that users<br>
  may not be able to figure out which categories apply to their interests,<br>
  especially if they come in with a presupposition about their field of<br>
  interest.  (e.g., "I'm an Atmospheric Scientist.")<br>
<p>
Response:  <br>
Yes there is overlap (as we have in the current structure).  It's true<br>
- a novice user, coming in with presuppositions about their field, may<br>
want to explore the keyword lists to determine how the fields are<br>
categorized.  The oceans ARE part of the hydrosphere, so a novice user<br>
will only be able to see that oceans are separated from hydrosphere<br>
after gaining some experience with the hierarchy.  There is no<br>
standard hierarchy for all of Earth science.  This is true for any<br>
kind of classification scheme.  Users need to become familiar with any<br>
scheme in order to be able to use it effectively.  The positive aspect<br>
of this scheme is that Earth scientists will be able to find some word<br>
which they would have categorized differently. The proposed system,<br>
though, has flexibility to ignore the hierarchy and allows the user to<br>
go straight to the list of 'TERMs' (controlled keywords) without any<br>
filtering (as is currently done).<br>
<p>
As for 'Marine Zoology', we have responded to requests from several members <br>
of the marine biology community who wanted the term placed under 'Ocean <br>
Science.' A strict biologist may have placed the word differently, but we <br>
are trying to avoid excessive overlap and an overly long list (an overly <br>
long list becomes a chore for users to trudge through until they find their <br>
word).  Good point about 'Charged Particles'....it's a left-over from the <br>
Space Physics set of words and perhaps should be included under 'Solar <br>
Radiation'.  There are several upper atmosphere experiments that measure <br>
these parameters (PEM on UARS, for example).<br>
<p>
G.Saxton<br>
 - The Topic 'Too General' seems particularly bad to me.  How many users would<br>
   be motivated to explore such a topic when they know they are doing<br>
   Atmospheric Science or Geology (i.e., 'Solid Earth')?  Have you considered<br>
   allowing the same terms to be entered under two or more Topics?  For example<br>
   'Climate Change' might be used under 'Atmospheric Science', 'Biosphere',<br>
   'Hydroshpere', 'Land Surface', 'Ocean Science', and 'Paleoscience Data'.<br>
   [[Why use the word 'Data' in that last topic?  'Paleoscience' alone should<br>
   be just as explanatory as 'Ocean Science'.  Using the same term in<br>
   multiple categories isn't the problem that most people assume.  It is<br>
   analogous to using the same name in multiple families.  Everyone knows that<br>
   giving the same name to two or more kids in the same family would be a<br>
   problem (..."my other brother Darrell").  But nobody has much problem with<br>
   Darrell Green, Darrell Washington, and Darrell Berkowitz.<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
Agreed...'Too General' is not a valid topic and will not be used (nor was <br>
it intended to be used...that category just got copied to the web document....<br>
these are keywords you might find in the existing DIF field 'Keyword'). <br>
Paleoscience has been changed to Paleoclimate.<br>
<p>
G.Saxton<br>
- I don't understand what is meant by 'uncontrolled' list of keywords<br>
  cross-validated with the 'controlled' keywords".  My GUESS is that you are<br>
  actually controlling both lists (so that you can validate that the<br>
  'uncontrolled' keywords have been used in correct combination with<br>
  Topic/Controlled Keyword) but that you are allowing DIF authors to add<br>
  'uncontrolled' keywords at any time, so long as the term hasn't been used<br>
  elsewhere.  This leads to problems with distinct terms having the same<br>
  meaning (e.g., 'sea surface temperature' and 'SST') and with the same term<br>
  having different meanings in different DIF's (e.g., 'plasma').  I see that<br>
  my first example is already in the proposed list, as are several similar<br>
  cases.  How many users would think that they should look for 'SST' when they<br>
  have already found several good references under 'sea surface temperature'?<br>
  If my guess is correct, please consider these issues; if my guess is wrong,<br>
  please explain what is really proposed.<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
Maybe we used some poor terminology here.  The intent is to allow DIF<br>
writers to add VARIABLEs (uncontrolled keywords) that are not on the<br>
list of the 'VARIABLE' (uncontrolled keyword) category.  The added<br>
word would then become part of the list of 'valids' that the user<br>
would see when searching for data.  SST could be an alias for Sea<br>
Surface Temperature and we are considering adding an alias table to<br>
the database for variables like "SST" or trace gas chemical names.<br>
<p>
G.Saxton<br>
-  I don't fully understand what is meant by "The user can also choose to<br>
   search a list of 'uncontrolled' keywords that are associated with the<br>
   controlled keywords, but are searchable as free text."  Does this imply <br>
   some new functionality for directory software?  Again, I am concerned that <br>
   users may not be able to easily discover the keywords that they need to <br>
   use to search effectively for DIF's of interest.<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
What is meant here is that the user can select the VARIABLEs<br>
(uncontrolled keywords) and see the entire list without going through<br>
the TERM (controlled keyword) hierarchy.  The hierarchy is a way to<br>
organize the keywords; the user does not have to go through it....you<br>
can select 'TERM' and get the entire list of terms, too.  This is no<br>
different than what a user can do now.  In the present system, a user<br>
can select 'PARAMETER' and get a list of all of the valids parameters.<br>
As mentioned in the response to P. Callahan, the primary purpose of<br>
the VARIABLE category is for DIF writers to be able to add their own<br>
keywords to describe their data.<br>
<p>
G.Saxton<br>
- Finally, what does "growing thesaurus of 'uncontrolled' keywords" mean?  <br>
  Is this just a list of the keywords and their associated Topic/Controlled<br>
  Keywords?  Or is it a real thesaurus with the ability to associate terms<br>
  with similar meanings?<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
Not really a thesaurus...This is a list of variables for which there may be <br>
many for any one broadly defined 'parameter'.  <br>
<p>
<p>
Summary:<br>
Concern was raised regarding database management of VARIABLEs<br>
(uncontrolled keywords).  Plans have been discussed for developing a<br>
DIF normalizing process by which new VARIABLEs could be checked<br>
against existing ones.  It was determined that revised data sets could<br>
be tagged with new VARIABLEs using this process.  The primary purpose<br>
of the VARIABLE category is to allow DIF writers to specify their own<br>
keywords (if the one they want is not on the list of variables) to<br>
describe their data.  It is presumed that VARIABLEs will be used to<br>
specify measurable quantities and will assist the writer in<br>
restricting (not proliferating) new keywords if their words are the<br>
same (or similiar) to those that already exists in the VARIABLE list.<br>
<p>
Concern also was expressed that the proposed keyword structure may be<br>
unwieldy and difficult to maintain.  Clarification was made that this<br>
structure was designed specifically to be simple and to minimize the<br>
impact on database maintenance requirements.  In addition, questions<br>
were raised as to how these changes will impact system operation and<br>
maintenance.  The GCMD plans to provide software which will<br>
automatically map the new keywords to the existing ones.  Any<br>
modifications to system software also will be provided.  Although<br>
there will be some initial effort required on the part of operations<br>
personnel, the overall impact of these changes should be minimal.<br>

I have read over your Aggregate Group proposal. I see why you need it and<br>
its advantages but I think you should think about the following in your<br>
design of it:<br>
<p>
1. Do you want to accommodate intermediate levels of aggregation? For<br>
example, a high level description for a CDROM set, a mid level description<br>
of a particular CDROM in the set, and descriptions of the data sets on<br>
that particular CDROM. If so (and I think you should make allowances for<br>
this), then a DIF could have both 'subDIF_URLs' and 'superDIF_URLs'.<br>
<p>
2. Your first three examples represent hierarchical relations between<br>
the DIFS: a 'parent' that includes the 'children'. The NOAA book collection<br>
has parts for different time periods; the GEDEX CDROM contains two<br>
data sets; the NSIDC super DIF would have 10 parts. But your fourth example<br>
is different. In my view, the DLG for the US could have sub parts for each<br>
of the states and that is the same hierarchical relation as the other<br>
examples. But the inclusion of the PA DLG in another product - the PA GIS<br>
CDROM - is like a 'see also' link to me. It is a reference to where this<br>
data can also be found. Suppose the USGS issues an updated set of<br>
DLGs for the US. You would expect the included PA part to also be re-released,<br>
maybe even updated itself. But the PA GIS CDROM might continue to use<br>
the older version because the two products are not tightly bound.<br>
<p>
If you agree with this thinking, then a DIF would only have one superDIF<br>
link but could have multiple subDIF links. And, to accommodate intermediate<br>
levels, a DIF could have both super and subDIF links. There should be<br>
a way to reference 'related' DIFs, such as the PA GIS record.<br>
<p>
Also, a comment on the Criteria text examples you give. I think you<br>
want to be more explicit than 'The URLs below point to DIFs with more<br>
information about the adata on the CD-ROM'. You could say instead 'The<br>
following URLs point to individual data sets (or files) on this CD-ROM.'<br>

I fully agree with Linda Hill that a language field can be used for several <br>
different applications.  Each of these applications have their own benefits<br>
for directory users or for directory computer systems.<br>
<p>
In my opinion, the one application mentioned by Linda Hill, which is of<br>
most interest to directory users for evaluating the usefulness of a<br>
dataset, is the language of the information object. <br>
<p>
The second application mentioned by Linda Hill, the language of the<br>
metadata record, may be a useful application for the IDN in the future. <br>
With software such as DIFmorph, which displays DIF information in a given<br>
format, displaying field names in different languages is already a<br>
possibility.  When the system software becomes advanced enough to accept<br>
information in different languages, then a "language-of-metadata-record"<br>
field will be important. <br>
<p>
However, for now, I support keeping the language field simple and useful<br>
for directory users, limiting the field to Andrea Buffam's original<br>
intent: a field that describes the language of the textual information of<br>
the stored data.  This field should be called "Dataset_Language."  In the<br>
future, as the system evolves to handle the complexity of multiple<br>
languages, another field called "DIF_Language" can be added. <br>

Yes, Andrea Buffam's proposal is worth to be included. I agree with Ron Vogel's position - and would consider a 'dataset_language' field to be an optional item. For a worldwide used system - should there be defined some abbreviation list for most appropriate languages or should there be used the adjective expression? <br>

        Reply to:   RE&gt;&gt;INTEROP: Proposal for a New Field in the IDN DIF<br>
<p>
I agree with the comments made so far.  It would be useful to the reader to<br>
populate this field in the language of the document, and to follow it with the<br>
english translation in parentheses, as in the enclosure (in MS Word).<br>

I fully agree with Linda Hill that a language field can be used for several <br>
different applications.  Each of these applications have their own benefits<br>
for directory users or for directory computer systems.<br>
<p>
In my opinion, the one application mentioned by Linda Hill, which is of<br>
most interest to directory users for evaluating the usefulness of a<br>
dataset, is the language of the information object. <br>
<p>
The second application mentioned by Linda Hill, the language of the<br>
metadata record, may be a useful application for the IDN in the future. <br>
With software such as DIFmorph, which displays DIF information in a given<br>
format, displaying field names in different languages is already a<br>
possibility.  When the system software becomes advanced enough to accept<br>
information in different languages, then a "language-of-metadata-record"<br>
field will be important. <br>
<p>
However, for now, I support keeping the language field simple and useful<br>
for directory users, limiting the field to Andrea Buffam's original<br>
intent: a field that describes the language of the textual information of<br>
the stored data.  This field should be called "Dataset_Language."  In the<br>
future, as the system evolves to handle the complexity of multiple<br>
languages, another field called "DIF_Language" can be added. <br>

<i>&gt; | </i><br>
<i>&gt; | Further to our report at the CEOS meeting held in Japan last week</i><br>
<i>&gt; | we are making the following proposal to provide a language field in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; | IDN DIF.</i><br>
<i>&gt; | </i><br>
<i>&gt; | In 1994 the Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB) accepted</i><br>
<i>&gt; | Document No. CGSB-171.3  Directory Information Describing Digital</i><br>
<i>&gt; | Geo-Referenced Data Sets.</i><br>
<i>&gt; | </i><br>
<i>&gt; | Last summer we compared the new requirements of the CGSB with</i><br>
<i>&gt; | the current DIF (at that time), and the proposed changes by Lyne</i><br>
<i>&gt; | Halpern for the IDN DIF to meet the new FGDC metadata standard.</i><br>
<i>&gt; | We accepted the changes proposed by Lyne as they were similar</i><br>
<i>&gt; | to the new requirements of our CGSB.  The differences were the</i><br>
<i>&gt; | choice and use of alternate field names.  (They would ultimately</i><br>
<i>&gt; | gather the same information.)  For example, the CGSB uses Data</i><br>
<i>&gt; | Manager instead of Technical Contact.  The only addition was a</i><br>
<i>&gt; | language field. Since Canada has two official languages - English</i><br>
<i>&gt; | and French, this was necessary to meet the CGSB standard.</i><br>
<i>&gt; | </i><br>
<i>&gt; | As there is no other additional information that is required to</i><br>
<i>&gt; | accompany the field, I suggest that we simply add the following</i><br>
<i>&gt; | field to the IDN DIF:</i><br>
<i>&gt; | </i><br>
<i>&gt; |    Language: language_name</i><br>
<i>&gt; |    &lt;This optional field describes the language of the textual</i><br>
<i>&gt; |      information of the stored data.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; | </i><br>
<i>&gt; | The field should be repeated if the data is available in more</i><br>
<i>&gt; | than one language.</i><br>
<i>&gt; | </i><br>
<i>&gt; | For example:  Language: English</i><br>
<i>&gt; |                      Language: French</i><br>
<i>&gt; | </i><br>
<i>&gt; | </i><br>
<i>&gt; | Sincerely,</i><br>

Embedding different languages in DIFs is a completely different matter than<br>
adding a keyword to indicate that the information object is supplied in<br>
another <br>
language.  I am opposed to any attempt to embed other languages in DIF<br>
entries.  <br>

Hello Lilo Lenz,<br>
<p>
The spatial list of keywords discussed on this Listserver (we call them<br>
location keywords) originated from NASA's National Space Science Data<br>
Center (NSSDC) for the NASA Master Directory (NMD).  The list is not<br>
currently related to FIPS or any standard. <br>
<p>
The NMD has undergone substantial changes in the past 2 years, including a<br>
shift in focus toward Earth science.  Users of the current directory<br>
system, the GCMD, have found that the specificity of the location keywords<br>
is inadequate for their needs.  For example, one cannot specify country<br>
names when conducting a metadata search.  In light of this, we are<br>
exploring possibilities of a new location keywords list that includes<br>
country names.  ISO 3166 is one possibility.  In addition, we have had<br>
much luck with the country names in the World Fact Book from the U.S.<br>
Office of the Director of Central Intelligence; see<br>
<a href="http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/95fact/index.html">http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/95fact/index.html</a><br>
<p>
A proposal to incorporate country names in the location keywords will be <br>
posted to this Listserver soon.<br>
<p>
I hope this answers your question. <br>
<p>
Good luck, <br>

It may be worth investigating the current state of UNEP's INFOTERRA Thesaurus <br>
of Environmental Terms. One of the top-level categories is "Geographic <br>
Attributes" which has a list of country names grouped into continental sub-<br>
categories.<br>
<p>
The edition I have (1990) is out of date - obvious example being the former <br>
USSR and Yugoslavia regions. There were plans for an update, but I don't know <br>
what state they are in. Anyone out there know ?<br>

A new Infoterra thesaurus should be ready by July 96 to replace the 1990 version.  We'll let you <br>
know how to access it when it's ready.<br>

Concerning the request on spatial keyword list and responding to Gareth<br>
Lloyd's question I send a complete excerpt of the "Geographic Attributes"<br>
category from the new (draft version) UNEP's INFOTERRA Thesaurus of<br>
Environmental Terms as it was used by UNEP/GRID centres for our Meta-data<br>
Directory activity.  It is not the latest - although there are numerous<br>
former Russian republics included, there is is still Czech and Slovak<br>
Federal Republic quoted as it was just before splitting.  Hope that will<br>
be updated by the official Infoterra version in July.<br>

Dear Interop Participants,<br>
<p>
Thank you for your input with regards to the new Language field proposed<br>
for the IDN DIF (June 7, 1996) as follows:<br>
<p>
     Language: language_name<br>
     &lt;This optional field describes the language of the textual   <br>
information<br>
       of the stored data.&gt;<br>
<p>
     The field should be repeated if the data is available in more than   <br>
one<br>
     language.   For example:   Language:English  Language:French<br>
<p>
______________________<br>
<p>
We have considered the following input:<br>
<p>
On June 7 Linda Hill wrote,<br>
<p>
    "...consider the possible applications and complexities of language   <br>
identification<br>
    when creating a field or fields. Examples ... include (1) language of   <br>
the<br>
    information object, and it is possible for the information object to   <br>
be in more<br>
    than one language, e.g., English and French; (2) language of the   <br>
metadata<br>
    record; and (3) language description at the data element level, e.g.,   <br>
an<br>
    English version of the title, a French version of the title."<br>
   <br>
<p>
On June 12 Ron Vogel wrote,<br>
<p>
    "... the one application mentioned by Linda Hill, which is of<br>
    most interest to directory users for evaluating the usefulness of a<br>
    dataset, is the language of the information object."<br>
<p>
    "... the language of the metadata record, may be a useful application   <br>
<p>
    for the IDN in the future.   ... When the system software becomes<br>
   advanced enough to accept information in different languages, then<br>
   a "language-of-metadata-record" field will be important."<br>
<p>
    "... I support keeping the language field simple and useful<br>
    for directory users, ... a field that describes the language of the<br>
    textual information of the stored data.  This field should be called<br>
    "Dataset_Language.""<br>
<p>
<p>
On June 13 Hartwig Schroeter wrote,<br>
<p>
    "Yes, ... consider a 'dataset_language' field to be an optional item.   <br>
<p>
    For a worldwide used system - should there be defined some<br>
    abbreviation list for most appropriate languages or should there be   <br>
used the<br>
    adjective expression?"<br>
<p>
<p>
On June 14 Paul Callahan wrote,<br>
<p>
    "... It would be useful to the reader to populate this field in the   <br>
language of<br>
    the document, and to follow it with the english translation in   <br>
parentheses, ..."<br>
<p>
<p>
On June 15 Mike Martin wrote,<br>
<p>
    "Embedding different languages in DIFs is a completely different   <br>
matter than<br>
    adding a keyword to indicate that the information object is supplied   <br>
in<br>
    another  language.  I am opposed to any attempt to embed other   <br>
languages<br>
    in DIF entries."<br>
<p>
_____________________________<br>
<p>
As a result of the input, we have revised our proposal to more accurately   <br>
define the new field.<br>
<p>
     Dataset_Language:language_name<br>
     &lt;This field describes the language of the textual information of the   <br>
stored<br>
      data.  It is the language of the information object, NOT the   <br>
language used to<br>
      describe or interact with the metadata record.  This is an optional   <br>
field and<br>
      can be repeated if the data is available in more than one   <br>
language.&gt;<br>
<p>
It is our intention to only provide a field that identifies the language   <br>
of the information<br>
object.  Dataset_Language is a more descriptive field name.  We expect   <br>
that an<br>
abreviation of the languages won't be necessary as the number of   <br>
characters used<br>
to describe a language will be minimal.  We agree that it would be nice   <br>
to populate<br>
the language field using the native language alphabet however this would   <br>
require the<br>
use of special characters which are not universally supported.<br>
   <br>
<p>
We propose that the new Dataset_Language field be accepted.<br>
<p>
Thank you.<br>

As a result of the input, we have revised our proposal to more<br>
accurately define the new field.<br>
<p>
     Dataset_Language:language_name<br>
     &lt;This field describes the language of the textual information<br>
       of the stored data.  It is the language of the information<br>
       object, NOT the language used to describe or interact with<br>
       the metadata record.  This is an optional field and can be<br>
       repeated if the data is available in more than one language.&gt;<br>
<p>
It is our intention to only provide a field that identifies the language<br>
of the information object.  Dataset_Language is a more descriptive<br>
field name.  We expect that an abreviation of the languages won't<br>
be necessary as the number of characters used to describe a<br>
language will be minimal.  We agree that it would be nice to<br>
populate the language field using the native language alphabet<br>
however this would require the use of special characters which<br>
are not universally supported.<br>
   <br>
<p>
We propose that the new Dataset_Language field be accepted.<br>
<p>
Thank you.<br>

<i>&gt; Dear Interop Participants,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thank you for your input with regards to the new Language field</i><br>
<i>&gt; proposed for the IDN DIF (June 7, 1996) as follows:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Language: language_name</i><br>
<i>&gt;      &lt;This optional field describes the language of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;        textual information of the stored data.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      The field should be repeated if the data is available</i><br>
<i>&gt;      in more than one language.   For example:</i><br>
<i>&gt;                             Language:English</i><br>
<i>&gt;                             Language:French</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ______________________</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We have considered the following input:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On June 7 Linda Hill wrote,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     "...consider the possible applications and complexities of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      language identification when creating a field or fields.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Examples ... include (1) language of the information object,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      and it is possible for the information object to be in more</i><br>
<i>&gt;      than one language, e.g., English and French; (2) language</i><br>
<i>&gt;      of the metadata record; and (3) language description at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      data element level, e.g., an English version of the title, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;      French version of the title."</i><br>
<i>&gt;    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On June 12 Ron Vogel wrote,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     "... the one application mentioned by Linda Hill, which is of</i><br>
<i>&gt;     most interest to directory users for evaluating the usefulness</i><br>
<i>&gt;     of a dataset, is the language of the information object."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     "... the language of the metadata record, may be a useful</i><br>
<i>&gt;      application for the IDN in the future.   ... When the system</i><br>
<i>&gt;      software becomes advanced enough to accept information</i><br>
<i>&gt;      in different languages, then a "language-of-metadata-record"</i><br>
<i>&gt;      field will be important."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     "... I support keeping the language field simple and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      useful for directory users, ... a field that describes</i><br>
<i>&gt;      the language of the textual information of the stored</i><br>
<i>&gt;      data.  This field should be called "Dataset_Language.""</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On June 13 Hartwig Schroeter wrote,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     "Yes, ... consider a 'dataset_language' field to be an</i><br>
<i>&gt;       optional item. For a worldwide used system - should</i><br>
<i>&gt;       there be defined some abbreviation list for most</i><br>
<i>&gt;       appropriate languages or should there be used the</i><br>
<i>&gt;       adjective expression?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On June 14 Paul Callahan wrote,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      "... It would be useful to the reader to populate this field</i><br>
<i>&gt;       in the language of the document, and to follow it with</i><br>
<i>&gt;       the english translation in parentheses, ..."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On June 15 Mike Martin wrote,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     "Embedding different languages in DIFs is a completely</i><br>
<i>&gt;      different matter than adding a keyword to indicate that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      information object is supplied in another  language.  I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;      opposed to any attempt to embed other languages in DIF</i><br>
<i>&gt;      entries."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; _____________________________</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As a result of the input, we have revised our proposal to more</i><br>
<i>&gt; accurately define the new field.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Dataset_Language:language_name</i><br>
<i>&gt;      &lt;This field describes the language of the textual information</i><br>
<i>&gt;        of the stored data.  It is the language of the information</i><br>
<i>&gt;        object, NOT the language used to describe or interact with</i><br>
<i>&gt;        the metadata record.  This is an optional field and can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;        repeated if the data is available in more than one language.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is our intention to only provide a field that identifies the language</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the information object.  Dataset_Language is a more descriptive</i><br>
<i>&gt; field name.  We expect that an abreviation of the languages won't</i><br>
<i>&gt; be necessary as the number of characters used to describe a</i><br>
<i>&gt; language will be minimal.  We agree that it would be nice to</i><br>
<i>&gt; populate the language field using the native language alphabet</i><br>
<i>&gt; however this would require the use of special characters which</i><br>
<i>&gt; are not universally supported.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We propose that the new Dataset_Language field be accepted.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thank you.</i><br>

Dear Interop Participants,<br>
<p>
Thank you for your input with regards to the new Language field<br>
proposed for the IDN DIF (June 7, 1996) as follows:<br>
<p>
     Language: language_name<br>
     &lt;This optional field describes the language of the<br>
       textual information of the stored data.&gt;<br>
<p>
     The field should be repeated if the data is available<br>
     in more than one language.   For example:<br>
                            Language:English<br>
                            Language:French<br>

Regarding:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As a result of the input, we have revised our proposal to more</i><br>
<i>&gt; accurately define the new field.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Dataset_Language:language_name</i><br>
<i>&gt;      &lt;This field describes the language of the textual information</i><br>
<i>&gt;        of the stored data.  It is the language of the information</i><br>
<i>&gt;        object, NOT the language used to describe or interact with</i><br>
<i>&gt;        the metadata record.  This is an optional field and can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;        repeated if the data is available in more than one language.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is our intention to only provide a field that identifies the language</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the information object.  Dataset_Language is a more descriptive</i><br>
<i>&gt; field name.  We expect that an abreviation of the languages won't</i><br>
<i>&gt; be necessary as the number of characters used to describe a</i><br>
<i>&gt; language will be minimal.  We agree that it would be nice to</i><br>
<i>&gt; populate the language field using the native language alphabet</i><br>
<i>&gt; however this would require the use of special characters which</i><br>
<i>&gt; are not universally supported.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We propose that the new Dataset_Language field be accepted.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Karen Zanter and I support the revised Dataset_Language field proposal<br>
as it is described above.<br>
<p>
******<br>
<p>
On the topic of Group:  Aggregation<br>
<p>
The proposal has merit, but aggregation may be difficult to maintain.  If<br>
implemented, I believe it would have to be used with EXTREME caution.  For<br>
example, the update or deletion of DIFs could lead to dead links.  In the<br>
case of multiple DIF authors at the same facility, a matrix of aggregated<br>
DIFs may be required.<br>
<p>
As for the following:<br>
<p>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://nsidc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NSIDC1995<br>
<p>
If for any reason, the DIF display format needed to be changed (from Display<br>
to FGDC for example), the URLs for the SubDIFs or SuperDIFs would require<br>
updating at the same time.<br>
<p>
Depending upon certain factors including the number of DIFs that someone<br>
chooses to aggregate, the longevity or transitory nature of the data<br>
collection affected by the aggregation, the number of individuals who may<br>
be modifying DIFs, etc., tracking and keeping aggregated DIFs current could<br>
be maintenance intensive.<br>

Thanks to all who responded with comments on the Aggregation Proposal.  <br>
The comments have been considered and are addressed briefly below.  The <br>
overriding concern in rewriting this proposal was to minimize the cost of <br>
maintenance that could occur if many kinds of URLs were allowed per <br>
Aggregation group.<br>
<p>
Comment by Linda Hill, 8 May 1996:<br>
"Do you want to accommodate intermediate levels of aggregation? ...to<br>
accommodate intermediate levels, a DIF could have both super and subDIF<br>
links." <br>
<p>
Response:<br>
Since maintenance of URLs is a primary concern, perhaps only two levels of<br>
hierarchy should be allowed: high-level descriptions and low-level<br>
descriptions.  Thus, a DIF could contain one superDIF link or multiple<br>
subDIF links, but not super and sub links in the same DIF. <br>
<p>
Comment by Paul Callahan, 14 May 1996:<br>
"I think you should not limit the number of subs and supers in an <br>
aggregation."<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
A DIF _may_ contain multiple subDIF links.  However, since maintenance of <br>
URLs is a concern, pointing to related "see also" information, i.e., DIF <br>
information that falls outside the hierarchical parent-child <br>
relationship, should not be permitted.  Thus, a DIF might contain <br>
multiple subDIF links but only one superDIF link (i.e. no "related DIF"<br>
links).<br>
<p>
Comment by K.C. Wehde, 1 July 1996:<br>
"The proposal has merit, but aggregation may be difficult to maintain. <br>
...tracking and keeping aggregated DIFs current could be maintenance <br>
intensive."<br>
<p>
Response:  <br>
The proposal is reworded below to limit the number of URLs per Aggregation<br>
group, thereby minimizing maintenance.  A parent DIF may point to several<br>
child DIFs, and those children may point back to that single parent.  This<br>
simple hierarchy will provide the necessary functionality of linking to<br>
detailed descriptions but should also be manageable.  <br>
<p>
Remember that the field is optional.  If DIF providers do not want to<br>
write additional descriptions (be they superDIFs or subDIFs) there is no<br>
requirement that they do so. <br>
<p>
In addition, we have explored how other organizations are dealing with the <br>
"aggregation" concept.  In particular, the Catalog Interoperability <br>
Protocol (CIP) of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) <br>
Working Group on Information Systems and Services (WGISS) Protocol Task <br>
Team (PTT) as well as the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) <br>
Global Resource Information Database (GRID) metadata have been examined.<br>
<p>
CIP:<br>
<p>
CIP introduces the collections concept whereby high-level collection<br>
descriptions point to members.  The members of collections can be provider<br>
descriptions or other collection descriptions.  A collection description<br>
contains location information of the members. Since the resultant<br>
hierarchy of multiple levels of cross-referenced descriptions can easily<br>
develop into a complex web, we think that the maintenance of such a web<br>
(especially updating the location information) will be an overwhelming<br>
burden.  Note that the concept of using location information to point to<br>
further descriptions is a shared concept between CIP and this DIF<br>
proposal.  <br>
<p>
UNEP/GRID:<br>
<p>
UNEP/GRID introduces the members concept in their metadata.  Members are<br>
fields containing detailed information.  These fields are part of the<br>
directory-level metadata descriptions themselves.  With these member<br>
fields, detailed information about components of datasets may be included<br>
in the metadata.  Members may be one of six types: vector, raster, image,<br>
map, table, or report.  Each member type has its own set of descriptive<br>
subfields.  Multiple members and multiple types of members are allowed per<br>
metadata record. <br>
<p>
Below is the revised proposal.  If no comments to this proposal are posted<br>
on the Interop Listserver, this proposal will go to the voting committee. <br>
If approved, the software necessary to support this field will be<br>
available in V6. <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
                   INTEROP LISTSERVER PROPOSAL #6<br>
<p>
Replacement of the DIF Field "Aggregated" with an Aggregation Group<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Presently, the field, "Aggregated", takes either a _yes_ or _no_ value <br>
and indicates whether or not a DIF is aggregated, i.e. whether the DIF<br>
provides general information about many specific datasets or not. <br>
<p>
The following inadequacies were identified with the current aggregation<br>
field: the user does not know how the specific information was organized<br>
in the aggregated DIF, and the user has no way of directly accessing the<br>
more specific DIFs (if they exist).  In addition, the field "Aggregated: <br>
Yes or No"  did not solve the "aggregation problem" of identifying the<br>
level of detail at which data centers may describe their datasets so that<br>
the metadata is functional at both the directory and more-detailed levels. <br>
<p>
In order for the DIF to be useful in providing information about<br>
aggregation and in allowing user access to more detailed dataset<br>
information, we propose the following new DIF group to replace the <br>
current field, "Aggregated": <br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
    Aggregation_Criteria:<br>
    SuperDIF_URL:<br>
    SubDIF_URL:<br>
    SubDIF_URL:<br>
    .<br>
    .<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
The field, Aggregation_Criteria, is a free text field which allows DIF<br>
authors to describe how the underlying DIFs were organized in the<br>
aggregated DIF. <br>
<p>
The URL fields provide access information for the underlying DIFs in the<br>
following way.  An aggregated DIF (or super DIF) points to underlying DIFs<br>
(or sub DIFs).  The SubDIFs can point back to the generalized overlying<br>
(super) DIF.  Thus, aggregated DIFs can point to SubDIFs, and SubDIFs<br>
can point to the super aggregated DIF.  The URLs would all be hyperlinked.<br>
<p>
No DIF would have both fields, SuperDIF_URL and SubDIF_URL.  SuperDIFs<br>
would only have SubDIF_URLs listed in them, and SubDIFs would only have<br>
SuperDIF_URLs listed in them.  This insures a two-level hierarchy, which <br>
is advantageous from the standpoint of information maintenance.<br>
<p>
The existence or nonexistence of the group indicates whether the DIF is<br>
involved in DIF aggregation or not.  Thus, inclusion of the group in the<br>
DIF is optional.  If the group is included, the field Aggregation_Criteria<br>
is mandatory, but the fields SuperDIF_URL and SubDIF_URL are optional. <br>
The field Aggregation_Criteria may only be used once.  The field<br>
SuperDIF_URL (if included) may only be used once.  The field SubDIF_URL<br>
(if included) may be used as often as necessary.  Thus, a strict <br>
parent-child hierarchical relationship is maintained between the <br>
high-level descriptions and low-level descriptions.  This eliminates the <br>
maintenance-costly "related-DIF" relationship.<br>
<p>
Please see the examples below for further clarification on how the<br>
Aggregation Group might be implemented in the DIF, both for existing DIFs<br>
and new DIFs. <br>
<p>
Two primary advantages result from the inclusion of this group in the DIF: <br>
users will be able to access more detailed information about datasets<br>
directly from a single directory-level DIF, and data centers will be able<br>
to maintain their own DIFs (no matter how detailed) while still allowing<br>
user access from outside systems.  Remember that the group is entirely<br>
optional, as is the listing of URLs within the group. <br>
<p>
<p>
EXAMPLES FOR CURRENT DIFs in the GCMD<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
<p>
1) A GCMD DIF describes a NOAA Library book collection of information on<br>
meteorological observations at various temporal coverages for Lithuania.<br>
An Aggregation Group will be inserted into the GCMD DIF, containing the<br>
URL's for the underlying DIFs (SubDIF_URL) that pertain to the book<br>
collection. In this case there are 4 SubDIF_URL fields pertaining to the<br>
varying temporal coverages. <br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
  Aggregation_Criteria: separated by temporal coverage<br>
  SubDIF_URL: <br>
<a href="http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NCL0<br>

0033&amp;form=noaadir<br>
  SubDIF_URL: <br>
<a href="http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NCL0<br>
0034&amp;form=noaadir<br>
  SubDIF_URL: <br>
<a href="http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://esdim1.esdim.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=NCL0<br>
0066&amp;form=noaadir<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
<p>
2) There are 2 GCMD DIFs representing the a) Nimbus-7 ERB MATRIX<br>
(ERB-MATRIX), and b) Nimbus-7 ERB Solar Irradiances (N7-ERB). These<br>
datasets also exist in the GCMD GEDEX CD-ROM DIF. An Aggregation Group<br>
will be inserted into the 2 DIFS, containing the URL for the overlying DIF<br>
(SuperDIF_URL). In this case there is 1 SuperDIF_URL field pertaining to<br>
the GEDEX CD-ROM. An Aggregation Group will also be inserted into the<br>
GEDEX CD-ROM DIF containing the URL's for the 2 underlying DIFs<br>
(SubDIF_URL). In this case there are 2 SubDIF_URL's pertaining to the<br>
CD-ROM. <br>
<p>
a) ERB-MATRIX DIF:<br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
  Aggregation_Criteria: This dataset is also located on the GEDEX CD-ROM<br>
  SuperDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=GEDEX<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
b) N7-ERB DIF:<br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
  Aggregation_Criteria: This dataset is also located on the GEDEX CD-ROM<br>
  SuperDIF_URL:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=GEDEX<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
c) GEDEX CD-ROM DIF:<br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
  Aggregation_Criteria: The URLs below point to DIFs with more <br>
information about the data on this CD-ROM.<br>
  Sub_URL:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=RB2/EN67-2<br>
  Sub_URL:<br>
<a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/getdif?format=Display</a>&amp;entry=N-7-ERB<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
<p>
EXAMPLE FOR NEW DIFs in the GCMD<br>
---------------------------------<br>
<p>
1) NSIDC has snow cover datasets for North America for the last 10 years.<br>
They have generated 10 DIFs on their system and would like to generate a<br>
GCMD entry to represent the 10 datasets. The GCMD DIF would contain an<br>
Aggregation Group containing the URL's for the underlying DIFs<br>
(SubDIF_URL). In this case there are 10 SubDIF_URL fields pertaining to<br>
the 10 years of snow cover data. <br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
  Aggregation_Criteria: individual datasets separated by year<br>
  SubDIF_URL:<br>

Please note in this example, NSIDC need not submit its ten DIFs to the<br>
GCMD, only the one super DIF, if it so chooses.  In addition, the ten<br>
individual DIFs at NSIDC can point to the super DIF at the GCMD using the<br>
SuperDIF_URL field, if NSIDC chooses to do this. <br>

Lola,<br>
<p>
I go the INTEROP: revised aggregation proposal via email, so I realize<br>
it has already gone out, but I have a few comments for future<br>
consideration.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Below is the revised proposal.  If no comments to this proposal are posted</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the Interop Listserver, this proposal will go to the voting committee. </i><br>
<i>&gt; If approved, the software necessary to support this field will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; available in V6. </i><br>
<p>
I would word this: "If approved, the software coding necessary to<br>
support this field will be scheduled to provide feature availability<br>
in V6."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; In order for the DIF to be useful in providing information about</i><br>
<i>&gt; aggregation and in allowing user access to more detailed dataset</i><br>
<i>&gt; information, we propose the following new DIF group to replace the </i><br>
<i>&gt; current field, "Aggregated": </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Group: Aggregation</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Aggregation_Criteria:</i><br>
<i>&gt;     SuperDIF_URL:</i><br>
<i>&gt;     SubDIF_URL:</i><br>
<i>&gt;     SubDIF_URL:</i><br>
<i>&gt;     .</i><br>
<i>&gt;     .</i><br>
<i>&gt; End_Group</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The field, Aggregation_Criteria, is a free text field which allows DIF</i><br>
<i>&gt; authors to describe how the underlying DIFs were organized in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; aggregated DIF. </i><br>
<p>
Currently, we limit simple text fields to 80 characters.  A true free<br>
text field of unlimited length is now defined via a text group. As is<br>
the case with Use_Constraints, for example.<br>
<p>
So, the definition you may want here is:<br>
<p>
Group: Aggregation<br>
    Group Aggregation_Criteria:<br>
	&lt;text&gt;<br>
    End_Group<br>
    SuperDIF_URL:<br>
    SubDIF_URL:<br>
    SubDIF_URL:<br>
    .<br>
    .<br>
End_Group<br>
<p>
This is a "safe" definition, using an existing, working method.  <br>
<p>
In general though, we have an issue with the need for text fields<br>
longer than 80 characters, and the fact that allowing these may cause<br>
problems throughout the software suite because of undocumented<br>
assumptions previously made that lines would not exceed 80 characters<br>
in length.<br>
<p>
The most obvious place we will need these longer lines is for URLs.<br>
Choosing to allow longer lines seems like it is inevitable, but making<br>
sure the system remains reliable with long lines will require a major<br>
effort for testing and at least some recoding.  This effort should be<br>
explicitly allowed for in schedules and actually completed before we<br>
can offer longer lines without risking embarrassing system failures.<br>
Also, longer lines bring up presentation issues for the Classic<br>
client.  This is obviously a post-V5 consideration, but one we should<br>
keep in mind when committing to future phases of work.<br>

<p>
As some of you may recall, it was Joe King who pushed hardest for<br>
"aggregated" DIFs as a labor-saving device to prevent having to write a<br>
DIF for each of a large group of datasets related to each other in some<br>
way.  A number of DIFs have already been written which have no<br>
aggregation field in them and simply describe the dataset relationship<br>
or aggregation criteria in the summary.  I assume this would still be an<br>
acceptable way of doing things.  The advantage of the aggregation group<br>
would be the ability to show the parent-child relationship of URLs, but<br>
in many of the cases we have, there would not be a URL or a DIF for each<br>
of the children. <br>

Dear Readers of the Interoperability Listserver,<br>
<p>
Below is a proposal for changes in the Location field of the DIF.  If you<br>
have comments on the proposal, please post comments to this listserver at<br>
interop@gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov<br>
<p>
Deadline for comments: 17 January 1997<br>
Summary of comments and revised proposal available: 24 January 1997<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Ron Vogel<br>
Global Change Master Directory<br>
<p>
=========================================================================<br>
Proposed Changes to the Location Field in the DIF<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
The Location field in the DIF has been criticized for not providing the<br>
level of detail which users and DIF writers expect; namely country names<br>
are conspicuously absent from the list of location valids. <br>
<p>
The current procedure of adding country names after the valid name (e.g. <br>
Location: SOUTH AMERICA &gt; Colombia) has been an unsatisfactory solution<br>
because the additional names are not searchable.  In this example, SOUTH<br>
AMERICA is a valid searchable term, whereas Colombia is not searchable. <br>
Those users wishing to search on the location Colombia are not given the<br>
opportunity to search at this level of detail.  Furthermore, simply<br>
supplementing the current valids list with country names is also an<br>
unsatisfactory solution because the numerous country names would overwhelm<br>
the current list. <br>
<p>
To address these problems, we propose the following changes.  These<br>
changes would be scheduled for development for the release of MD Version<br>
6.<br>
<p>
A)  Proposed changes to the DIF structure:<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<p>
We propose no changes to the DIF structure.  The field will remain as<br>
before with the following syntax:<br>
<p>
Location: [valid] &gt; [free text]<br>
<p>
This allows all organizations and agencies using the DIF to continue to<br>
use the Location field in the manner most appropriate to their needs,<br>
without requiring unnecessary changes. <br>
<p>
B)  Proposed changes to the Location valids list:<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
The Location valids will be based on those already in use as of DIF Manual<br>
4.1 (and continuing in DIF Writer's Guide 5.0a) with the following<br>
additions. Country names will be added, using the UNEP INFOTERRA list. <br>
Names of additional oceans and seas will be added, as per Interop message<br>
of 11 May 1995.  Several new regions will be added, covering important<br>
areas (example: Southeast Asia).  Extraterrestrial locations will remain<br>
unchanged from the list in DIF Manual 4.1.  For a complete list of<br>
Location valids, see the Appendix below. <br>
<p>
The UNEP INFOTERRA country list will be used because INFOTERRA has already<br>
done the work in developing a list of countries.  The UNEP INFOTERRA list<br>
is similar to the ISO 3166 list of country names.  Other lists which were<br>
consulted in the process of developing this proposal include the USMARC<br>
Code List for Countries from the U.S. Library of Congress, the World Fact<br>
Book of the U.S. Office of the Director of Central Intelligence; the List<br>
of Independent States and Dependencies of the U.S.  Department of State; <br>
and Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and their<br>
Principal Administrative Divisions of the U.S. Federal Information<br>
Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 10-4. The U.S. Defense Mapping<br>
Agency bases its country names in its Digital Gazeteer on the FIPS<br>
Publication 10-4.  The UNEP INFOTERRA list was chosen because of its<br>
similarity to ISO 3166 (the latest version of ISO 3166 is currently only<br>
in draft form) and because of the opportunity to interoperate with UNEP.<br>
<p>
The valids list will be divided into six categories: Region, Continent,<br>
Country, Ocean_or_Sea, Vertical_Location, and Extraterrestrial_Location<br>
(see Appendix).  Keep in mind, while the assignment of location valids to<br>
these categories may appear hierarchical, there will be no hierarchical<br>
relationships among the locations themselves (see example in Part E).  The<br>
assignment of valids to categories is only for the purpose of creating<br>
organized lists in the search interfaces and writing tools (see Parts C<br>
and D, respectively).  The categories do not affect the actual DIF syntax.<br>
<p>
The valids in five categories (excluding Extraterrestrial_Location) will<br>
be controlled through the database loader.  Location names may be added or<br>
modified when needed. <br>
<p>
It will still be possible to specify greater detail by including<br>
uncontrolled words of free text after the controlled valid.  Thus,<br>
constructions such as this will still be allowed: <br>
Location: GERMANY &gt; Bavaria &gt; Oberpfaffenhofen<br>
<p>
C)  Proposed changes to the search interface:<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
The search interface (WWW client) will be modified so that users will have<br>
two choices for selecting a location valid: selecting a valid from a<br>
single long list of valids, or first filtering the long list by selecting<br>
a category and then selecting a valid.  There will be two lines in the<br>
search interface: <br>
<p>
Location Category:  _______ [press here for options]<br>
                            options:<br>
                            Region, Continent, Country, Ocean_or_Sea, <br>
                            Vertical_Location<br>
Location Valid:     _______ [press here for options]<br>
                            see Appendix for options<br>
<p>
Thus, by first choosing a category, the user may filter the valids and<br>
see only those valids associated with that category.  Alternatively,<br>
by not choosing a category, the user may see the entire list of<br>
alphabetized valids. <br>
<p>
Only the selected location valid is passed to the database to query the<br>
field Location.  The category itself is not passed to the database.  In<br>
other words, category is only a means of filtering the many location<br>
valids into a more organized and understandable form.  The search is<br>
actually performed with the location valid only.<br>
<p>
D)  Proposed changes to DIF writing tools:<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<p>
The DIF writing tools (DIFwrite, DIFweb and DIFmacs) will be modified so<br>
that DIF writers may select Location valids by first choosing one of the<br>
categories.  After choosing a category, the writer will be presented with<br>
the valids associated with that category, from which the writer may select<br>
one or more valids.  Once selected, only the valids are written to the<br>
field.  The categories themselves are never written to the field.  The<br>
categories exist merely for the convenience of the DIF writer because the<br>
categories organize the many valids into understandable lists.<br>
<p>
In addition, the field may be repeated, so the writer will be able to<br>
choose valids from any of the categories multiple times.  The field is<br>
optional, so a DIF writer need not fill in the field.  Writers will be<br>
able to enter uncontrolled words of free text after the selection of each<br>
valid.  Each selected valid (and accompanying free-text) will be written<br>
to the field Location.  <br>
<p>
E)  Proposed changes to existing DIFs:<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Existing DIFs will all be revised to add the new words.  GCMD coordinators<br>
will add Country valids and Ocean_or_Sea valids to all DIFs held at the<br>
GCMD. <br>
<p>
Constructions in current DIFs will be left unchanged.  For example:<br>
Location: ATLANTIC OCEAN &gt; West Indies<br>
will remain as is.  However, this will be augmented by adding the<br>
appropriate Country valid and/or Ocean_or_Sea valid like this:<br>
Location: ATLANTIC OCEAN &gt; West Indies<br>
Location: DOMINICA<br>
Location: CARIBBEAN SEA<br>
<p>
Existing words (both searchable and unsearchable) will be left unchanged<br>
because of their advantage to the fielded free-text search.  In this<br>
example, West Indies is not a searchable Location valid, but will remain<br>
in the DIF because users may search on it with the fielded free-text<br>
search.  Keep in mind that this scheme is non-hierarchical, so a link<br>
between West Indies and Dominica is unnecessary.<br>
<p>
<p>
The above changes to the current DIF Location field are advantageous<br>
because they organize the various kinds of Location valids into their<br>
respective categories.  In the past, the DIF has been criticized for<br>
having "vertical" locations because users didn't understand the variety in<br>
the valids list.  Additionally, the proposed changes impose no burden on<br>
agencies not representing Earth science data who do not wish to make any<br>
change in the Location field.  Furthermore, this proposal allows the<br>
addition of new types of valids such as country names, adding greater<br>
specificity to the DIF and meeting users' and DIF writers' expectations. <br>
While new information will be added, existing information will remain<br>
unmodified.  Thus, the DIF will evolve to meet greater expectations<br>
while minimizing the effort to make these changes.<br>

 Dear Colleagues,<br>
=20<br>
 I have just seen the proposal about an extended and revised=20<br>
 LOCATION field in DIF and would like to propose some=20<br>
 additions.<br>
=20<br>
 I like the REGION, COUNTRY, OCEAN_OR_SEA, VERTICAL_LOCATION=20<br>
 entities. However, the World Meteorological Organisation=20<br>
 (WMO) has some similar tables, encompassing similar=20<br>
 attributes. Specifically, there is TABLE C1, 'Geographical=20<br>
 Designators for use in abbreviated headings', documented in=20<br>
 the WMO Manual on the Global Telecommunication System,=20<br>
 Volume I, Part II, last updated 1994, with 1996=20<br>
 internationally approved updates in the pipeline, and=20<br>
 routinely available in English, Russian, French and=20<br>
 Spanish.<br>
=20<br>
 The extra entries in the C1 tables are islands,=20<br>
 dependencies and other territories that do not appear in=20<br>
 the UNEP list of (strictly) countries (e.g. Greenland). WMO=20<br>
 have taken a pragmatic geographical, rather than political,=20<br>
 approach, mainly because many isolated islands are=20<br>
 important data sources, and we don't need to keep track of=20<br>
 who 'owns' them. The table is prefixed with the following:=20<br>
=20<br>
 "The designations employed and the presentation of the=20<br>
 material in this table do not imply the expression of any=20<br>
 opinion whatsoever on the part of the Secretariat of the=20<br>
 WMO concerning the legal status of any country, territory,=20<br>
 city or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the=20<br>
 delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries."<br>
=20<br>
 1. The extra ('COUNTRY') entries in Table C1, but not in=20<br>
 your list, are below.=20<br>
=20<br>
 2. Also, in the second part of the table, are some regions=20<br>
 and sea areas that have finer 'resolution' than the=20<br>
 proposal's 'REGION' and 'OCEAN_OR_SEA'. Some of them=20<br>
 encompass both sea and land areas.<br>
=20<br>
 3. For vertical location, WMO routinely uses 'Land or Sea=20<br>
 surface'. I consider this preferable to 'Sea surface' or=20<br>
 assuming the data must be 'Troposphere' or 'Boundary=20<br>
 Layer'. (I assume it is atmospheric 'Boundary Layer'.)<br>
=20<br>
 You may wish to consider adding them.<br>
=20<br>

SIR-C IMAGES REVEAL NEW CLUES ABOUT EARTH'S CHANGING CLIMATE

Scientists on the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture
Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) mission, carried aboard the space shuttle
Endeavour in April and October 1994, presented findings today on the
workings of Earth's climate system -- its past, present and future --
using new data from some of the hottest and coldest regions of the
world.

"The radar data are providing clues to the workings of Earth's climate
system that no other remote sensing system can provide," said
Dr. Jeffrey J. Plaut, experiment scientist for the SIR-C/X-SAR project
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. The team
presented their findings at the spring meeting of the American
Geophysical Union in Baltimore, Md.

During the October 1994 flight of the space shuttle, observations were
taken of the area near the Kufra Oasis in southeast Libya, a region of
the Sahara Desert in North Africa.  The SIR-C data revealed a system
of old, now inactive stream valleys, called "paleodrainage" systems,
which during periods of wetter climate, carried running water
northward across the Sahara Desert. That region is now hyper-arid,
receiving only a few millimeters of rainfall per year, and the valleys
are now dry "wadis," or channels, mostly buried by windblown sand.

Prior to the spaceborne imaging radar missions, the west branch of
this paleodrainage system, known as the Wadi Kufra, was recognized and
much of its course had been outlined by German researchers who are now
serving as co-investigators on the SIR- C/X-SAR science team.  The
broader east branch of Wadi Kufra, however, was unknown until SIR-C
revealed its dimensions: at least 5 kilometers (3 miles) wide and
nearly 100 kilometers (62 miles) long. The two branches of Wadi Kufra
converge at the Kufra Oasis.  The farms at Kufra depend on irrigation
water from the Nubian aquifer system.

"This paleodrainage pattern revealed to us by the SIR-C data suggests
that the location of productive wells at the confluence of the old
river valleys is no accident," said team member Dr.  John F. McCauley,
a researcher holding joint appointments at the U.S.Geological Survey
and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Ariz. "Quite likely, the
water supply for the Kufra Oasis has been recharged by episodic runoff
and by groundwater that moved northward in the alluvial fill of the
old stream channels."

Rainfall was more abundant in this region during parts of the late
Quaternary -- the second period of the Cenozoic geologic era which
includes the last 2 million to 3 million years -- when "stone age"
Paleolithic and later Neolithic people left their tools along the
riverbanks.  The SIR-C image, which clearly shows river channels cut
into the surrounding bedrock, provides geoarchaeologists with a "road
map" to locate artifacts and to better interpret the history of early
people and climatic conditions in this region.

The recent SIR-C/X-SAR missions also obtained important new
information about the Patagonian ice fields of Chile and Argentina
that will enable future monitoring of this important region of the
Southern Hemisphere.  The ice fields are poorly known because of their
remoteness and inhospitable climate. The area has only been traversed
during a few very challenging mountaineering expeditions. Much of the
region is nearly always covered by clouds, so that remote sensing by
reflected visible or infrared radiation is often not possible.

"The SIR-C/X-SAR radar system penetrates the cloud cover to produce a
unique new view of this enigmatic landscape of snow and ice," said
Dr. Bryan Isacks, a geologist at Cornell University and a SIR-C/X-SAR
team member.

Images of huge areas of the ice fields and outlet glaciers were
obtained over successive days during each of the two radar imaging
missions. They reveal glacier movements and the effects of changes in
weather on the characteristics of the snow and ice.  Comparisons
between the two missions provided new views of two different weather
conditions during fall and spring in the Southern Hemisphere.

JPL's imaging radar system is capable of discriminating different
characteristics of snow and ice by using multiple radar wavelengths
and being able to examine the directional characteristics -- called
polarization -- of the radar echoes.  The effects of the passage of a
storm, for instance, can be seen clearly on successive daily
images. The Patagonian ice fields are subjected to frequent storm
systems, which carry enormous quantities of moisture to the mountain
belt. These new SIR-C/X-SAR images have provided scientists with a
first assessment of the distribution of snowfall from storms as they
move across the entire ice field.

During the last few days of the April 1994 mission, a special series
of radar images were taken of the west side of the northern Patagonian
ice field to measure its detailed topography and the movement of the
San Rafael Glacier, using a new method called "radar interferometry."
These measurements confirmed previous ground observations at the
glacier terminus, or glacier end, that astoundingly high rates of
movement -- upward of 15 meters to 20 meters per day (49 feet to 66
feet) -- rank San Rafael as one of the fastest moving glaciers in the
world. The San Rafael Glacier maintains high velocities due to complex
interactions between high snowfall, topographic control and the exit
of the glacier directly into an arm of the Pacific Ocean.

Limited studies have suggested that the ends of many of the Patagonian
glaciers have receded during this century, but how this recession is
related to changing conditions on the ice fields and in the atmosphere
is still not known. These new measurements will set the stage for
continued radar monitoring of the area, which in conjunction with
satellite sensing of changing weather conditions, will reveal how the
ice fields are changing in response to changes in global and regional
climate.

The Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar project
is a joint mission of the United States, German and Italian space
agencies. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory built the radar system and
manages the SIR-C portion of the mission for NASA's Office of Mission
to Planet Earth.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Chapter 1:  Introduction</TITLE><META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Microsoft Word 2.0"></HEAD><BODY><H1><CENTER><A NAME="_Toc374170355">Chapter 1:  Introduction</A></CENTER></H1><H2><A NAME="_Toc374170356">1.1  Background</A><BR></H2><P><FONT SIZE=2>The Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) was originallydeveloped in support of the Catalog Interoperability effort (CI). The CI effort strives to facilitate interactions among sciencedata cataloging systems.  A long term goal of this effort is toprovide science users with the ability to find and view informationabout science data regardless of what data system actually holdsthe metadata.  <BR></FONT><P>The initial impetus for this activity came from NASA.  However,early in the process it became desirable to include other U.S.government agencies involved in the collection and distributionof data of interest to scientists (e.g., NOAA, USGS, NCAR, etc.). As a result, representatives from several agencies work togetherwith NASA to further the CI goals.  The work of the CI effortattracted the interest of the international CEOS program, specificallythe Committee on Earth Observing Satellites Data Working Group(CEOS-DWG). As a result, CEOS international participants beganto attend the CI workshops and interact directly with the CI workinggroup.  <BR><P>In the ensuing years, CEOS agreed to sponsor an experiment tomake available and exchange directory information.  This experimentbecame what is now referred to as the International DirectoryNetwork (IDN).   The GCMD software is installed at numerous sitesin the CEOS community and functions as the primary operationalcomponent of this directory system.  The CEOS IDN was the firstsuccessful experiment in an expanding international cooperativeapplication of interoperability.<BR><P>The CI working group targeted directory level metadata as itsfirst attempt to establish interoperation among data systems. The CI science advisory group determined that directory levelmetadata should be very broad in its coverage and not extremelydetailed. It was felt that directory level metadata should assista scientist in learning about what data was available for hiswork. It should also be possible to determine whether a data setwas interesting enough that additional specific information shouldbe sought.  Directory level metadata can, therefore, be used toreject a particular entry. However, to fully determine whetherthe data set located in the directory is of real interest to thescientist, more information about that data set would have tobe located at another level of the metadata hierarchy. The directory,therefore, serves to locate data sets of potential interest tothe scientist.<BR><P>The CI science advisory group authorized its working group totackle the directory metadata interoperability through two mechanisms: 1) the development of a directory metadata interchange format(DIF); 2) the development of a master directory based on the DIFthat would contain data across agencies, disciplines, and internationalboundaries. <BR><P>The CI working group developed the DIF format during a seriesof teleconferences and workshops.  The DIF contains the core andmost important information which directory level metadata musthave to fulfill its purpose as outlined above. The DIF also providesthe syntax and semantics with which data systems would exchangetheir directory level metadata. The DIF was approved by the CIscience advisory group at a CI workshop in 1988. At that timethe DIF syntax came under configuration control to ensure continuedsyntactical and semantic compatibility of all changes.<BR><P>Once the initial DIF syntax was developed, the MD developmentteam at the NASA Space Sciences Data Center (NSSDC) at the GoddardSpace Flight Center (GSFC) began the design and implementationof a master directory based on the DIF syntax. The basic designparameters of the original system were as follows:<BR><P>  Because access to the directory was to be over a network viamany different types of terminals, character based input/outputshould be minimized and the use of terminal specific functionkeys should be avoided.<BR><P>  The interface to the directory must be simple enough that userscan use it without requiring detailed written documentation.<BR><P>  The DIF syntax and its controlled list of keywords should formthe base of the querying mechanism for the directory.<BR><P>  Users should not be required to learn the data dictionary northe SQL query language.<BR><P>  The software should be flexible and portable. <BR><P>  It was allowed to be dependent upon SQL but it should not bedependent upon any particular vendor's relational database system(RDBMS).<BR><P>  The software should be written so as to make movement to differingoperating environments possible with a minimum of re-coding.<BR><P>The original version of the software developed with the abovespecifications became operational in September 1988 under theVAX VMS environment using a SmartStar database.<BR><P>With increases in network performance and connectivity, alongwith increased hardware capability, it became desirable to evolvethe GCMD software functionality.  A client/server architecturewas designed and implemented which offers expanded user servicesand options while fulfilling the basic requirements.  Using theclient/server model, the GCMD has been opened to access by alternativesystems via independent client implementations.<BR><P>Continued expansion of the directory into the Earth science communityfostered a transfer of the GCMD responsibilities within NASA fromthe NSSDC to the Global Change Data Center (GCDC).  As such, recentand further developments of the GCMD system are sponsored by theGCDC.<BR><P>From the mid-1990's onwards, GCMD software development has beenconcentrated in the Unix and WWW environments.  Currently (late1996), the GCMD software, as distributed, is operational undermultiple implementations of the Unix operating system.  VAX/VMSis no longer supported.  Some portions of the software as distributedare loosely tied to the Oracle database through low-level accessmechanisms.  Knowledgeable database programmers could easily substituteaccess routines appropriate for other databases if it were requiredto host the system on an alternative RDBMS.<BR><BR><BR><BR><H2><A NAME="_Toc374170357">1.2  Organization of the Document</A><BR></H2><P>The MD System Documentation provides an overview of the overallMD system, its component subsystems, and the operating systemenvironment.  The structure of the database and its relationshipto the DIF are contained within.<BR><P>This document is divided into 10 chapters:  chapter 1 and 2 providean introduction and overview of the Master Directory system; chapter3 contains the MD database description and information; chapters4 though 8 discuss the environments of  the major MD subsystems;chapter 9 lists the MD global environment variables; and chapter10 contains compilation and linking information for the MD.<BR><P>In addition, there are several useful documents which may providefurther insight into the Master Directory system. <P>  <P>  The MD <I>Programmer's Guide</I> (Version 4 ) details the softwareinteraction of several key components of the system.  <BR><P>  The MD <I>Operations Guide</I> (Version 5 ) directs the usageof the many utilities which aid in the day to day support of theoperational MD system.<BR><P>  The MD <I>Users' Guide, Alphanumeric Interface Version 2</I>,provides comprehensive  (but slightly dated) instruction on thefunctionality of the GCMD clients.  <BR><BR></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Chapter 2: MD Client/Server Architecture Overview</TITLE><META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Microsoft Word 2.0"></HEAD><BODY><H1><CENTER><A NAME="_Toc374170358">Chapter 2: MD Client/ServerArchitecture Overview</A><BR></CENTER></H1><P>The Master Directory query interface has been converted to theclient/server architecture. This architecture divides the MD systeminto 3 components: client, network, and server. In this chapter,the word client refers to a MD user interface client. <BR><P>The client software interacts with the users and handles interfaceand presentation of information. When information is requiredfrom the database, the client produces SQL statements and sendsthem to the database server. The database server processes theSQL statements with a database product (such as Oracle) and returnsthe results of queries to the client. The client and server 'talk'to each other over a network via the TCP/IP protocol.<BR><P>Any MD client can connect to any MD server. This means if oneserver is down, the user can still use the client software byswitching to another database server. The server is defined bysystem environment variables that can be set before the startof the client application. If the database server is in a locationthat is farther away, the database queries may take longer, butthe speed of the user interactions with the local client willremain the same.<BR><BR><H2><A NAME="_Toc374170359">2.1 Database Server</A><BR><BR></H2><P>The Master Directory database server is a connection-based, TCP/IPserver. The server accepts database queries and send results usingBerkeley TCP/IP sockets. A log file is maintained of machinesthat connect to the server. <BR><P>The database queries are in the form of SQL statements or specialquery commands. By using a GET command, a client can ask for aformatted section of a DIF or the entire DIF. By using the formattedsections, a client need not know the SQL statements needed toquery for the information. <BR><P>The database servers use the following system variables to setthe IP address and port number. Refer to chapter 9 for more informationon these variables.<BR><P><FONT FACE="Courier">SERVERDOWN</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">SERVHOSTADDR</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">SERVTCPPORT<BR><BR></FONT><H2><A NAME="_Toc374170360">2.2 Log Server</A><BR><BR></H2><P>The log server is used to maintain a record of the use of theMD clients. The clients send the log file to the log server whenthe user chooses Quit from the clients. The log information isstored if the <FONT FACE="Courier">TRACKLOGS</FONT> variable isset <I>in the client environment</I>.<BR><P>The log information stored by the log server is described in chapter7 of this document.<BR><P>The log servers use the following system variables to set theIP address and port number. Refer to chapter 9 for more informationon these variables.<BR><P><FONT FACE="Courier">SERVHOSTADDR</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">SERVTCPPORT<BR><BR><BR></FONT><P><CENTER><B>Insert the MD Functional Design diagram here<BR></B></CENTER><H2><A NAME="_Toc374170361">2.3 User Interface Clients</A><BR></H2><H3><A NAME="_Toc374170362">Non-Web Clients</A><BR></H3><P>Different clients can be built to take advantage of terminal characteristicsand access the Master Directory database server. The MD distributionsupplies two types of non-Web clients: line-oriented, and textwindows based (vt100 compatible). All client programs use thesame SQL building and network routines to send SQL queries andreceive database results. The differences with the clients dealwith how the information is displayed to the user. <BR><P>The non-Web MD clients and server were written so they could bebuilt into one program and run as a stand-alone local application.When building a client to run stand-alone, the network modulesare not included in the executable. The client is linked directlywith the database server and the database product. The advantageof this arrangement is the application will be faster as interactionswith the database will be quicker.<BR><P>The non-Web clients also can be built in network-only mode, orin dual mode. In dual-mode, both the network modules and the databaseserver are built into the client application. The server is determinedby setting the system environment variables. This situation hasthe advantage of fast database interactions with the local databaseproduct and the ability to connect to distant database servers.<BR><P>Non-Web client software consists of several distinct layers. Thetop-most layer is the interface itself. This is what the usersees and interacts with by pressing buttons on a keyboard or movinga mouse pointer. The interface interacts with the memory managementlayer which holds information such as what the user typed andwhat is displayed on the screen. The memory manager stores thevalues needed by the SQL generator and the results from the databaseserver. At this point, the client consists of the modules neededto interact with the user and the database product. If the clientis built to be able to connect to distant database servers, thenetwork modules are included. The network modules provide theclient with the ability to talk to the database server over thenetwork.<BR><P>The database server is also built in layers. The primary functionof the server is to interact directly with the database product.The servers have the ability to build SQL statements and formatthe results when the clients ask for preformatted DIF information.The final layer is the network modules which allow the serverto correspond with the clients over the network.<BR><P>When the non-Web client is built for stand-alone use, the databaseserver is linked directly into the client application. The networkmodule is no longer necessary in this model as the client andserver layers can interact through shared memory space. If theclient application is built in dual-mode, the network module isincluded, but only used when the application connects to a distantdatabase server.<BR><P>All of the MD non-Web clients rely on dictionary files. SQL statementsused to retrieve information and validate user input are in thefile sql.dic. The file fields.dic contains definitions for globalvariables used in the SQL templates and the MD clients. Thesefiles are found under the ~/dictionary directory tree in the softwaredistribution.<BR><P>All help files for the clients can be edited to best serve theuser community. <BR><P>The following system environment variables are used to determinewhat mode the clients will operate in. Please refer to chapter9 for the definitions of these system variables.<BR><P><FONT FACE="Courier">CLIENTSERVER</FONT> <P><FONT FACE="Courier">SERVHOSTADDR</FONT> <P><FONT FACE="Courier">SERVTCPPORT</FONT> <P><FONT FACE="Courier">LOGTCPPORT</FONT> <P><FONT FACE="Courier">TRACKLOGS<BR></FONT><H3><A NAME="_Toc374170363">MD Small Client</A><BR></H3><P>The MD small client (smcl) provides a very simple line interfaceto allow the user to type in SQL or GET commands and receive aresponse from the MD server. The small client is quite usefulfor diagnosing the system, as it does no significant memory ordisplay processing of its own, but merely returns the &quot;raw&quot;data as supplied by the server in MD Server API format.<BR><H3><A NAME="_Toc374170364">MD Classic Client</A><BR></H3><P>The MD Classic client (mdmain) is the original alpha-numeric userinterface. It uses the curses library for its screen layouts andwas designed to be used with any terminal that is supported bythe system the program is running on.<BR><P>The MD Classic client also supports generic TTYs that are notdefined in the curses library. If a terminal type is not recognized,the information will scroll on the users terminal. No screen positioningor highlighting codes will be used in this mode. This is the onlyMD client that supports TTY mode.<BR><P>This interface was first released in 1988. In its original form,the interface was linked directly to the database product. Thisapplication now has the ability to run in either stand-alone orclient-server mode.<BR><BR><H3><A NAME="_Toc374170365">MD X Motif Client</A> <BR></H3><P>Beginning with Version 5, the X client (mdx) is not part of theGCMD software distribution. Since the advent of the World WideWeb, use of the X client has dropped to a very minimal level.Thus, the effort which would be required to maintain the X clientis better expended elsewhere. <BR><H3><A NAME="_Toc374170366">Web-based Access to the GCMD</A><BR></H3><P>Access to the GCMD is available through the World Wide Web (WWW)at http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov.<P>The GCMD's WWW implementation is quite extensive, and is beyondthe scope of this document.<BR><BR><BR><BR><P><CENTER><B>Insert the Client-Server Interaction diagram here<BR><BR></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<P>
The Master Directory uses a relational database management system
(RDBMS) to store and maintain the DIF entries. In a relational
database, data is stored in tables constructed of one or more
columns. Data is accessed through the use of a database query
language. Using this query language, data may be inserted, updated,
deleted, or selected for output. In addition, data from multiple
tables may be logically joined in a query to permit simpler or
more complex views of the data.<BR>

<P>
Through the loading process, the DIF information is segregated
and stored into multiple database tables. The directory software
accesses the database information using the Structured Query Language
(SQL).<BR>

</H3>

<P>
The MD database has a set of tables dedicated to storing the information
for the DIF entries. In each of these tables, the DIF is identified
by an internal number called DE_ID. The DE_ID is a unique number
and is assigned automatically during the loading process. In some
tables the DE_ID alone acts as the primary key. In others, DE_ID
is combined with other fields to form the primary key. Indices
have been created for each table to ensure data integrity and
to optimize data selections and collating.<BR>

is an associative table intersecting DIF entries and data center
personnel information. The data_center name is used to group the
personnel information by data center. The data_center column in
this table matches the data_center column in the DE_CENTER and

</H2>

<P>
This section briefly discusses the Master Directory database server.
The full documentation for the server including client-server
interactions is included in the <I>Programmer's Guide</I>.<BR>

<P>
The Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) server provides a generic
application program interface (API) for communications between
various GCMD clients and the GCMD database server. This API has
been developed independent of any one specific relational database
product and allows standard SQL statements to be processed. The
server has been implemented to allow two modes of access: <I>batch</I>
and <I>interactive</I>.<BR>

<P>
When the database server is activated in batch mode, all of the
database results from a single SQL command are returned at once.
In this mode, there is no way of interrupting the flow of data
being returned from the server. The client must worry about storing
the data that is returned. Therefore, one must be careful when
composing the SQL statements as to expect a certain amount of
data.<BR>

<P>
With interactive mode, the client controls the flow of data returned
from the server and has the ability to stop the query being executed.
The server fills one buffer and waits for another call to fill
the next buffer. Therefore, the client can issue additional server
commands between the buffers. The client also has the ability
to execute concurrent queries by specifying SQL commands on different
server channels/cursors.<BR>

<P>
In addition to any standard SQL statement which may be sent to
the GCMD database server, specialized queries may be issued which
return formatted sections of DIF information. These sections represent
a logical partitioning of the DIF information for the purpose
of display and reporting. Each of these sections may be retrieved
in batch or interactive mode. A list of the currently available
specialized queries appears at the end of this section. <BR>

This file contains the SQL select statements needed to fill the

for this file is pointed to by <FONT FACE="Courier">MDDICT</FONT>.
<BR>

<P>
This file allows programmers to add values to sections or totally
change the content. However, it is imperative that the programmer
using correct SQL syntax within the structure of the file. Failure
to do this will almost certainly lead to erroneous results or
program crashes.<BR>

<B>*** The penalty for disregarding this rule is massive server
malfunction! <BR>
</B>
<P>
Each screen is described by one or more select sections in the
<FONT FACE="Courier">QUERY.SEL</FONT> file. Each select section
is composed of 4 parts:<BR>

<P>
Section Name
<P>
Processing Information Line
<P>
Select Clause
<P>
Where Clause<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Section Name</B></I> - This is the name of the actual query
section available on the database server. There can be any number
of select statements for any one section. However, each select
block must always begin with the section name. The section name
should always be in upper case because the utility program which
provides a sorted list of the section names identifies them by
case.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Processing Information Line</B></I> - This is a line of
integers that provides the query system with instructions about
how this select statement is to be identified and processed. Each
integer on the line is separated from the next by at least one
space. Each line contains the following information:<BR>

<P>
<TABLE >
<TR><TD WIDTH=108>QueryID</TD><TD WIDTH=360>An integer uniquely identifying the select. It must begin at 1 not 0. Each QueryID must be one greater than the select preceding it regardless of the section. Only one select statement may have a particular ID number.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=108>NestFlag</TD><TD WIDTH=360>When set to Zero, this integer indicates that this select should be completed before the next QueryID is processed. So, if a query returns multiple rows, all rows will be retrieved before the next query is processed. If this integer is set to 1, one row from this table will be retrieved and then the next QueryID will be processed concurrently.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=108>Level </TD><TD WIDTH=360>This integer contains the <I>nesting level.</I> It is also used as the channel with which to query the database. When one query is nested within another, its level will be one greater than the query within which it is nested. This convention is required and ensures that concurrent queries are processed on <B>different</B> channel numbers. All queries at the same level of nesting will have the same channel number. Level numbers begin at 5.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=108>SeqNo</TD><TD WIDTH=360>SeqNo integer is an ordinal at 0 for any particular level. Each additional query at a level will have a SeqNo 1 greater than the previous one. For example, If QueryID 0 has its nest flag set and its level would be 0, then QueryID 1 would have a level 1, SeqNo 0. If its nest flag is not set and there where another select at level 1 then its QueryID would be 2 and SeqNo would be 1. The query system would retrieve one row from QueryID 0, then it would retrieve all the rows from QueryID 1. After retrieving all the rows of QueryID 1, it would retrieve all the rows of QueryID 2 before processing additional at level 1 or returning to the next row of level 0.
</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Select Clause</B></I> - This contains the <FONT FACE="Courier">select</FONT>
clause of an SQL statement. The appropriate syntax for the production
database must be used otherwise errors will occur. The select
portion also includes the <FONT FACE="Courier">FROM</FONT> phrase.
The select may contain joins or any other valid SQL technique.
It is also acceptable to use database specific utilities. However,
in the latter case, they would need to be changed, if the production
database is changed.<BR>

<P>
The <FONT FACE="Courier">select</FONT> clause is terminated by
placing the @ character on a line by itself.<BR>

<P>
A select statement may be spread over multiple 80 character lines.
Programmers <B>MUST </B>not use more than 80 characters on a single
line. The query subsystem automatically concatenates the multiple
80 character lines. Also, the total select and where phrases may
<B>NOT</B> exceed the 2000 characters.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Where Clause</B></I> - This part of the SQL statement is
optional. If no where clause need be included in the select statement,
then the following syntax does not apply.<BR>

<P>
If a <FONT FACE="Courier">WHERE</FONT> clause is required, the
line on which the where appears must have the <FONT FACE="Courier">~</FONT>
character in the first column. Lines may not exceed 80 characters.
The <FONT FACE="Courier">where</FONT> clause and the select clause
combined may <B>NOT</B> exceed 2000 characters.<BR>

<P>
The <FONT FACE="Courier">where</FONT> clause may contain any valid
SQL syntax for <FONT FACE="Courier">where</FONT>. When <FONT FACE="Courier">LIKE</FONT>
or equal (<FONT FACE="Courier">=</FONT>) is used, values from
previous selects may be used on the right side of the <FONT FACE="Courier">LIKE</FONT>
or <FONT FACE="Courier">=</FONT>. When using a value from the
previous select, the syntax specifies the channel number and buffer
position as follows:<BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Courier">:6.1</FONT> where 6 is the channel number
of the query from which the value has been retrieved 
<P>
and 1 is the position in the query buffer which contains the value.
Since the return
<P>
buffer starts with the server status code, this position value
is effectively 1 based.<BR>

<P>
The <FONT FACE="Courier">where</FONT> clause is ended by placing
a <FONT FACE="Courier">~</FONT> character on a line by itself.
This character must appear in the first column of the line.<BR>

The selection of formatted sections via the database server is
flexible and changeable because it is driven by database selection
criteria and formatting instructions contained in external files.
As a result, programmers can easily change the content and format
of these selectable sections by editing these external files.
<BR>

<P>
Programmers <I><B>must</B></I> be absolutely certain that they
understand both the format used in creating the file and the purpose
of all the fields and lines in the format file. Incorrect modifications
will almost certainly lead to serious problems and perhaps crashes
of the database server.<BR>

<P>
<B>*** This file should never contain any blank lines. *** <BR>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Chapter 4: User Interface Clients</TITLE><META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Microsoft Word 2.0"></HEAD><BODY><H1><CENTER>Chapter 4: User Interface Clients<BR></CENTER></H1><H2><A NAME="_Toc374158981">4.1 Introduction</A><BR></H2><P>Prior to Version 5, there were three MD full-featured user interfaceclients (mdmain, md2, mdx), and two very simple SQL query clients(smcl, xsmcl). The various clients supported different terminalcharacteristics: line-oriented, text window based, and X Windowbased. <BR><P>As of the release of Version 5, the JAM-based client (md2) hasbeen permanently discontinued. The X Window client (mdx) has beententatively discontinued, and is not part of the Version 5 release.This client will only be updated to and re-released if demandcan be shown to exist for it.<BR><P>The only remaining full-featured user interface client is theClassic Client, which has been updated for compatibility withVersion 5 of the DIF. The and two very simple SQL query clients,smcl and xsmcl, are supplied as well.<BR><P>All of the Master Directory user interfaces have been built usingthe client/server architecture. The interactions of the differentclients with the database server are the same. For more informationon the client/server protocol, see the chapter 3 of this documentand the <I>Programmer's Guide</I>.<BR><P>Note: Access to the GCMD is available through the World Wide Web(WWW) at http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov.<BR><P>The GCMD's WWW implementation is quite extensive, and is beyondthe scope of this document.<BR><H3><A NAME="_Toc374158982">External Files</A><BR></H3><P>The MD was designed to be as flexible as possible. One aspectof this design decision was to be able to modify many of the featuresof the system without changing the source code, re-compiling andre-linking. This flexibility was implemented using a dictionarydriven approach. These dictionaries are implemented using externalbinary and text files.<BR><P>The classic client (mdmain) uses external dictionary files whichcontain the SQL statements to be sent to the database server.These files are <FONT FACE="Courier">sql.dic</FONT> and <FONT FACE="Courier">fields.dic</FONT>in the dictionary directory defined by the <FONT FACE="Courier">MDDICT</FONT>system environment variable. For more information about thesefiles, see the <I>Programmers API</I> document.<BR><P>Note: Dictionary files relating to GCMD's WWW implementation arefound in the directory given by the environment variable $MDDICT/WWW.<BR><P>Specific dictionary files required for the classic client arediscussed below. Each file description will contain a brief statementof its purpose, its layout and its location in the logical directoryhierarchy. The logical hierarchy designation will use the followingsyntax: each level of the hierarchy will be separated from itssublevel by the <FONT FACE="Courier">-&gt;</FONT> operator (example:<FONT FACE="Courier">MDDISK-&gt;MDPROD-&gt;DICTIONARY</FONT>).This approach is used to make clear the relative directory relationships,regardless of the actual directory names on any specific machine.<BR><H2><A NAME="_Toc374158983">4.2 GCMD Classic Client (curses-based)</A><BR></H2><P>The classic client uses a handful of external files allowing fora great deal of flexibility. These files allow the following itemsto be changed without needing to modify the source code: <BR><P>Menu format and valid commands for forms<P>Menu and form calling sequence<P>Form layout and valid commands for forms<P>Change help files for menu options and form fields<P>Change the name of commands used to execute MD actions<P>Specify display attributes for commands when using certain terminals<P>Change the content and names of help files<P>Provide a bulletin message during the initialization<BR><BR><H3><A NAME="_Toc374158984">Free Text Files</A><BR></H3><P>Free text files are used to display text directly from the fileinto the MD Classic client. Users may arrange text in the filein any manner they wish.<BR><BR><BR><P><A NAME="_Toc374158985"><B>BULLETIN.TXT<BR></B></A><P>This file contains the entry level text data displayed just afterthe user has logged in. The file has two basic purposes:<BR><P>1) Provide a bulletin board feature where the operations staffcan insert appropriate and timely information.<BR><P>2) Provide something for the user to read while the initializationprocess is being executed.<BR><P>This file has one format restriction -- it may not contain morethan 16 text lines of 78 characters each. <P>The text may be arranged in any manner.<BR><BR><P><A NAME="_Toc374158986"><B>*.HLP<BR></B></A><P>Files containing the suffix '.HLP' denote that they are text filesused to display on-line help. Users may include as many linesas they desire. They may also arrange the text in any way theyfeel is appropriate for providing the best help on the designatedfield, screen, or selection option.<BR><P>Help text files are topically oriented. Their names are enteredin the appropriate menu text file or form text file. Names enteredin this feature may even use a different suffix. However, helpfor the MD commands assumes that the name of the help text filewill be composed of the suffix '.HLP' concatenated to the nameof the command (for example, if the command is exit, then it isassumed that the help text will appear in the file named -- <FONT FACE="Courier">EXIT.HLP</FONT>).<BR><P>Help text files are located in the directory defined by the <FONT FACE="Courier">MDHELP</FONT>system environment variable. Normally, this variable points tothe <FONT FACE="Courier">MDDISK-&gt;MDPROD-&gt;HELP-&gt;CURSES</FONT>directory.<BR><BR><H3><A NAME="_Toc374158987">Fixed Format Files</A><BR></H3><P>These files provide the basic dictionary files for the MD Classicclient. Some are text files which are used directly by the systemin its display and command segment. Others are text files whichare transformed by utilities into binary files of structures whichare then read into internal buffers.<BR><P>Readers are directed to the header files <FONT FACE="Courier">SCRNBUFTYPE.H</FONT>,and <FONT FACE="Courier">DISPLAYBUF.H</FONT>. These contain thedefinition of the structure type used.<BR><P>These files are located in the <FONT FACE="Courier">MDDISK-&gt;MDPROD-&gt;DICTIONARY</FONT>directory.<BR><BR><P><A NAME="_Toc374158988"><B>COMMANDS.DEF<BR></B></A><P>The MD classic client was designed to avoid too much hardcodinginto the software itself. This was as true about the names tobe used for certain actions as it was for the content of menusand forms. As a result, the functionality provided by a commandwas established by the use of an enumerated type. This externalfile ties the user designated name to the MD command functionality.The file also allows the user to specify what display attributeshould be used for the command text.<BR><P>There are three basic groups of commands: Paging commands, screenmovement commands, and execution commands. Individual commandswithin each of these groups was assigned an enumerated type. Thefollowing listing lists the command function and its enumeratedtype sequence number.<BR><P>Paging Commands: These allow movement through multiple pages oftext for a single screen.<BR><BR><P><U>Command Function Default Name Enum No </U><P>Display the Next Page NEXT 9<P>Display the Previous Page PREV 4<P>Display the page number listed PAGE 3<BR><P>Screen Movement Commands: These allow movement from one screento another.<BR><P><U>Command Function Default Name Enum No </U><P>Goto to the screen listed with command DISPLAY 2<P>Exiting from one level to level above EXIT 0<P>Going to the Main menu from anywhere MAIN 10<P>Go to the search selection screen SEARCHSEL 12<P>Go to the supplement screen SUPPLEMENT 13<BR><P>Execution Commands: These cause the MD to activate a designatedfunction.<BR><P><U>Command Function Default Name Enum No </U><P>Activate the comment system COMMENTS 14<P>Get help for the designated option HELP 5<P>Activate an automated link LINK 8<P>Special system activation MD 15<P>Leave the MD system QUIT_MD 6<P>Repaint the screen REFRESH 11<P>Start a search of the database SEARCH 1<P>Move from form field to command line . 8<BR><P>A new name is assigned to a command by replacing the default namewith the one that the user desires.<BR><P>This file also contains a character indicating the display attributedesired for that command. The following display attributes arecurrently supported:<BR><P>A all attributes together<P>B bold<P>N normal video attribute (white on black in monochrome)<P>R reverse video attribute (black on white in monochrome)<P>U underline<BR><BR><BR><BR><P><A NAME="_Toc374158989"><B>FORMS.DEF<BR></B></A><P>A form is a screen which interacts with the user and displaysinformation from the database. The form definitions file, <FONT FACE="Courier">FORMS.DEF</FONT>,in the MD system is used to define and modify the forms for theMD classic client. Once this text file has been created or modified,it is used to generate the <FONT FACE="Courier">FORMS.DIC</FONT>and <FONT FACE="Courier">MD.DIC</FONT> dictionary files.<BR><P>The content of the forms definition file specifies all aspectsof the user interface for each form. Titles, commands, fields,and database associations are included in the definitions. Allof the MD Classic query forms and display forms are included in<FONT FACE="Courier">FORMS.DEF</FONT>. Below is a descriptionof the individual text blocks which comprise a form definition.<BR><P>The <B>TITLE</B> block is used to specify the content of the titleswindow on the display screen. Titles may be up to three linesin length.<BR><P>The <B>COMMAND</B> block is filled with all of the commands whichwill be available on the form plus the desired command prompt.Each command definition begins with a &quot;-C&quot; and mustinclude the command token id, the command help filename, and thecommand text for the display. The command prompt specificationbegins with &quot;-T&quot; and includes the line number in thecommand window at which the prompt will appear and the text forthe prompt.<BR><P>The <B>DISPLAY</B> block contains the field specifications. Eachfield may have up to two header lines in addition to a prompt.The field specifications must be listed in this block in the orderin which they should appear on the screen.<BR><P>Each field definition in the display block begins with a &quot;-F&quot;.In order of appearance on the definition line, the following itemsmust be included:<BR><BR><P>Field Type<P>Display Window Line Number<P>Display Window Column Number<P>Field Input Size<P>Field Token ID<P>Field Helpfile name<P>Database Table<P>Database Column<BR><P>The header lines (if any) for each field should be listed directlybefore the appropriate field. Each header line begins with a &quot;-H&quot;and includes the display window row number and the header text.The prompt text definition begins with &quot;-T&quot; and mustappear directly below each field definition line.<BR><BR><P><A NAME="_Toc374158990"><B>FORMS.DIC</B></A><P>This file is the binary file of screenbuffer structures createdfrom processing the <FONT FACE="Courier">FORMS.DEF</FONT> file.In essence, a utility reads the text forms definition file andputs the data into the appropriate buffer structure and then writesit to this external binary file.<BR><P>The structure type used for the buffer is defined in the headerfile <FONT FACE="Courier">scrnbuf.h<BR><BR></FONT><P><A NAME="_Toc374158991"><B>MD.DIC<BR></B></A><P>This is the binary dictionary file which combines the forms.dicand the menu.dic (see below) files. This is the actual file usedby the MD Classic client to determine the content of the menuand forms screens. The MD system contains a utility which combinesthese two binary files and creates a text file (<FONT FACE="Courier">mddic.rec</FONT>)which lists the name of the screen and its relative position inthe combined binary file. <BR><P>The structure type used for the buffer is defined in the headerfile <FONT FACE="Courier">scrnbuf.h<BR><BR></FONT><P><A NAME="_Toc374158992"><B>MDDIC.REC<BR></B></A><P>This text file is created by the utility which mergers the formsand menu dictionary files into a single binary file. On each line,this file contains the name of a screen and its relative recordnumber within the binary dictionary file.<BR><P>ScreenName1 RecordNumber1<P>ScreenName2 RecordNumber2<BR><P>The basic purpose of this file is to provide an index into thebinary dictionary file so that the MD Classic query software canquickly locate the values of a single screen used in its system.<BR><BR><BR><BR><P><A NAME="_Toc374158993"><B>MDDIC.SRT<BR></B></A><P>This text file has the same format and content as <FONT FACE="Courier">MDDIC.REC</FONT>.However, the operating system SORT utility has been used on <FONT FACE="Courier">MDDIC.REC</FONT>to produce <FONT FACE="Courier">MDDIC.SRT</FONT>. This file containsthe data sorted in ascending order of screen name.<BR><P>This sort by screen name allows the MD Classic query softwareto use a binary search to locate the screen name and then obtainthe relative record location within the binary file. Using thisrelative record location the software locates the appropriatescreen buffer in the vector of screen buffer structures read induring the initialization process.<BR><BR><BR><BR><P><A NAME="_Toc374158994"><B>MENU.DIC<BR></B></A><P>This file is the binary file of screenbuffer structures createdfrom processing the <FONT FACE="Courier">MENUNAME.M</FONT> files.In essence, a utility reads the menu text file, puts the datainto the appropriate buffer structure, and then writes it to thisexternal binary file. <BR><P>All menus are described in separate <FONT FACE="Courier">MENUNAME.M</FONT>file. However, the utility which scans these &quot;.<FONT FACE="Courier">M</FONT>&quot;files appends them into this single binary file. The buffer structureis the same as that used for forms. <BR><P>The structure type used for the buffer is defined in the headerfile <FONT FACE="Courier">scrnbuf.h<BR><BR></FONT><P><A NAME="_Toc374158995"><B>MENUNAME.M<BR></B></A><P>The menu text files are used to define the user interface menusfor the MD Classic client. They are essentially fixed format textfiles. Menus offer the user fixed choices, and do not displayinformation from the database. Each of these files contains thecomplete definition for a single menu. Special utility softwareis provided which translates the menu text files and producesthe <FONT FACE="Courier">MENU.DIC</FONT> dictionary file. <BR><P>The basic format of this file is as follows:<BR><P>1) up to 2 78 character lines of text entered exactly as you wishthem to appear on the screen.<P>2) two hyphens (--) to denote separation between the title windowand the text window.<P>3) The name of the menu or form screen inside curly braces, thetext entered as you wish it to appear on that line, the name ofthe help file for that option inside curly braces.<P>4) two hyphens (--) to denote separation between the text windowand the command window.<P>5) up to 2 78 character lines of text entered exactly as you wishthem to appear on the screen.<BR><BR><BR><P>A menu is defined in three sections; one for the titles window;one for the display window, and one for the command window. Eachblock is separated from the other by a line containing two dashes,&quot;--&quot;. Each of these blocks is described briefly below.<BR><P>The <B>TITLES</B> block contains text for the titles window. Upto three lines may be specified in the title of a menu.<BR><P>The <B>DISPLAY</B> block is used to specify all of the optionswhich are available from this menu. Each option definition includes;the screen token for the menu or form which will appear when thisoption is selected; the text for the option, and the help filename.<BR><P>The <B>COMMAND</B> block contains the text for the command window.Each command must be listed and separated with commas. The commandwindow is limited to two lines; the available commands are listedon the first line, and the command prompt appears on the second.<BR><BR><P><A NAME="_Toc374158996"><B>MENUCONTROL.DIC<BR></B></A><P>This file provides menu and form activation control informationfor the menuhandler functions.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Chapter 5:  Usage Tracking</TITLE><META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Microsoft Word 2.0"></HEAD><BODY><H1><CENTER>Chapter 5:  Usage Tracking<BR><BR></CENTER></H1><P>This chapter describes valid input buffers that may be sent tothe MD log server.  The current design of the log server is suchthat it does not perform an interactive dialog with the clients. The communication between the log client and the MD log serveris thus one-way.  In the current implementation, the log serverexpects one or more buffers to be written to the stream.  Afterreceiving a buffer, the log server either writes it to a log fileor a comments file.  The log server does not send any status backto the socket stream.  This may change in the future.<BR><P>The external files created when a connection is made to the logserver are:<BR><P> logserver.stat  -  created on first connection, records subsequentconnection requests made to the log server<P> &lt;unique_number&gt;log.log  -  individual log file for a singleuser session <P> &lt;unique_number&gt;comments.log  -  user comment file, whichis deleted after the comment is sent<BR><H2><A NAME="_Toc374158999">5.1  Input Format Specifications</A><BR></H2><P>The format of the input buffer to the log server is as follows:<BR><P>  the input buffer must start and end with a tilde (~). <P>  the content of the input buffer must be Null terminated followingthe last tilde.<P>  the first field must contain one of the valid keywords to indicatethe type of information that is being sent to the log server.<P>  a second valid keyword must be used for the keyword<I> userlog</I>buffers.<P>  the fields following valid keywords will be recorded in eitherthe comments or the user log file.<BR><P>Valid first field keywords:<BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD WIDTH=72>comments</TD><TD WIDTH=216>indicates to the log server that the current buffer sent contains comments information</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=72>userlog</TD><TD WIDTH=216>indicates to the log server that the current buffer sent contains either the header information or the user activities information.</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=72>close</TD><TD WIDTH=216>request the log server to exit the current connection.</TD></TR></TABLE><P><BR><P>Valid second field keywords: (userlog activities only)<BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD WIDTH=72>header</TD><TD WIDTH=216>indicates to the log server that the current buffer sent contains only header information</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=72>logfile</TD><TD WIDTH=216>indicates to the log server that the current buffer sent contains the activities of a full user session</TD></TR></TABLE><P><P>Examples:<BR><P>   ~comments~user comments can be sent via the keyword 'comments'on the first field of the input buffer to the log server~tildescan be used to separate lines in the comments file~ this is thelast line of user comments~(null terminator)<BR><P> ~close~<BR><P> ~userlog~header~header information only~(null terminator)<BR><P> ~userlog~logfile~contains the user activities of a user session~(nullterminator)<H2><A NAME="_Toc374159000">5.2  Master Directory User Logs</A><BR></H2><P>The client's file (&lt;md1_xxxx&gt;.log  or  mdx_xxxx.log ) isa temporary file created on the client every time a session starts. This file contains all the user activities during an MD session. At the end of the session, the file is sent to the server andthen it is removed from the client.  On the server side, the newfile  (&lt;unique_number&gt;log.log) is located in the mdprod/sqllogdirectory where eventually it will be loaded into the user_logand md_session database tables.<BR><P>The format of the file is basically three types of lines:  introductory,sequence, and closing.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Chapter 6: DIF Extractor</TITLE><META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Microsoft Word 2.0"></HEAD><BODY><H1><CENTER>Chapter 6: DIF Extractor<BR></CENTER></H1><H2><A NAME="_Toc374159002">6.1 Overview</A><BR></H2><P>The MD extraction subsystem provides the operational staff theability to extract data from the various MD tables into externalfiles for printing or editing. The extractor subsystem providesthree major types of output:<BR><P>1) an MD entry is output in full DIF syntax. <P>2) an MD entry is output in a &quot;pretty printed&quot; formatrather than in a DIF format. This pretty printed format providesheaders for the individual sections and then lists the valuesfor that section. It does not have the Group syntax or keyword=valuesyntax. This style is very suitable for printing.<BR><P>The user interface of the extractor a slightly modified versionof the MD Classic interface. The user views provide two additionalquery attributes: the Entry ID and the Author. <BR><P>The extractor is also able to extract from the database thoseDIFs whose Entry IDs have been previously entered into the database'sPreselect table. The executable named &quot;preselect&quot; offersseveral methods of populating the Preselect table. The preselectexecutable is also available via the GCMD Ops Menu. <BR><P><IMG SRC="Image2.gif"><H2><A NAME="_Toc374159003">6.2 External Files</A><BR></H2><P><B>Dictionary Files<BR></B><P>The extraction subsystem uses the same type of files as the MDClassic client. Therefore, the forms, menus, commands, and menucontrol files are based on the external files used by the MD Classicclient. While the content is different for these files, theirformat is the same. See section 4.2 of this document for detailedinformation on these files. <BR><P>The dictionary files for this software are located in the directory:<FONT FACE="Courier">MDDISK-&gt;MDPROD-&gt;DICTIONARY-&gt; EXTRACT</FONT>.<BR><P>The environmental variables MDDICT and EXTDICT need to be setprior to invoking the extractor. These variables contain the pathsused by the extractor to find it's dictionary files. When theextractor is run via the Ops Menu, this is done automaticallyby the system. <BR><P><B>Output Files<BR></B><P>Users may specify the name of the output file(s) to be writtenby the Extractor. If no name is given, a default name of 'extract'is used. The extension for the file is determined by the typeof information extracted.

After doing this, an operator can extract the verysame DIFs and use a tool such as xdiff to examine any differencesbetween DIFs pulled from the database at any given time, and theoriginal DIFs as they existed prior to being loaded in the database(provided the original file(s) has been saved).</BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Chapter 7: DIF Loader</TITLE><META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Microsoft Word 2.0"></HEAD><BODY><H1><CENTER>Chapter 7: DIF Loader<BR></CENTER></H1><H2><A NAME="_Toc374159006">7.1 Overview</A><BR></H2><P>The main function of the loader is to translate a DIF text fileinto ANSI standard SQL statements that can then be used to enterthe information into the database. This is accomplished by comparingthe DIF file to a syntax dictionary and verifying the DIF valueswith values already in the database.<BR><P>The loader validates fields and creates insert statements oneDIF at a time. As the loader comes across a DIF, it is scannedto allow for random access into the DIF file. Each line in theDIF is read, parsed, and validated. The parser copies the DIFvalues into Field IDs. With the values in Field IDs, validationSQL statements are generated and sent to the database. The loadermakes one complete pass over the DIF to validate the entire DIFbefore insert statements are created.<BR><P>If the DIF is valid, SQL insert statements may be generated. TheDIF is read again and copied into Field IDs. The values are thenused to create the SQL insert statements.<BR><P>The actual insertion of DIFs into the database is done by activatingthe SQL interpreter for the particular RDBMS being used with theSQL file generated by the loader.<BR><P>The loader interacts with the user through a curses based interface.If there is an error within the DIF, a panel will appear on theterminal screen indicating what the problem is and present optionsto the user. In some cases, the user can choose to accept a valuethat failed validation and/or add fields and groups that are notdefined in the DIF manual to the database. Beginning with Version5, these cases are strictly limited. In the future, this capabilitymay not be offered at all. Instead, as of V5, procedures are inplace to allow valid values to be submitted to the GCMD for centralposting and rapid worldwide availability. (Please see the GCMDweb site for more information.)<BR><P>The loader can produce a log file for each DIF file processed.The log file retains any errors and parsing messages encounteredin the DIF file. The amount of information put into the log fileis defined by a command line argument. The logged informationcan range from being very brief to very annoying.<BR><P>The loader will process multiple DIFs in a single file. The onlyrequirement is that the DIF label <FONT FACE="Courier">Entry_ID</FONT>must be the first DIF label for each DIF. The loader will loadData Set DIFs as well as Supplementary Information on Data Centers,Projects and Campaigns, Sources, and Sensors.<BR><BR><H2><A NAME="_Toc374159007">7.2 Running the Loader</A><BR><BR></H2><P><B>Command Line Arguments<BR></B><P><FONT FACE="Courier">loader [-abdepsvwx] [-D#] [-l<I>file</I>]<I>dif_file<BR></I></FONT><P>Arguments Description<BR><P><FONT FACE="Courier">a </FONT>Use Accept as the default responseto all 'Accept, Reject, Quit' dialogs<BR><P><FONT FACE="Courier">b</FONT> Turn off terminal beep.

These files providethe loader with a path from the DIF values to the internal FieldIDs to the SQL statements. Two of the dictionary files are <FONT FACE="Courier">fields.dic</FONT>and <FONT FACE="Courier">sql.dic</FONT>; see the <I>ProgrammersGuide</I> document for more information on these files.<BR><P>The other two dictionary files are <FONT FACE="Courier">syntax.dic</FONT>and <FONT FACE="Courier">rules.dic</FONT>. The syntax dictionarydescribes the syntax of the DIF by using the actual DIF labelsand Field IDs to hold the DIF values. The rules dictionary isused to describe specific loader rules such as checking for requiredfields and updating certain tables after creating insert statements.<BR><BR><P><B>Syntax Dictionary<BR></B><P>The syntax dictionary maps the values in the DIF to Field IDsidentified in the Fields dictionary. The format of this file isvery similar to the DIF itself. Lines start with a DIF label followedby Field IDs for the DIF values. Text groups also require a labeleven though one is not in the DIF (see the Summary group below).<BR><P>Examples:<BR><P><FONT FACE="Courier">entry_id: :dif.entry_id</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">entry_title: :dif.entry_title</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">discipline: :disc.discipline &gt; :disc.subdiscipline&gt; :disc.text</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">parameter: :param.param_group &gt; :param.parameter&gt; :param.text</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">location: :location.location &gt; :location.text</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">sensor_name: :sensor.short_name &gt; :sensor.long_name&gt; :sensor.name</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">source_name: :source.short_name &gt; :source.long_name&gt; :source.name<BR></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Group: Summary</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">text: :summary.text</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">End_Group<BR></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Group: Data_Center</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Data_Center_Name: :dc.center_short &gt; :dc.center_long</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Dataset_ID: :dc.ds_id &gt; :dc.ds_text</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Group: Data_Center_Contact</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">last_name: :person.last_name</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">first_name: :person.first_name</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">middle_name: :person.middle_name</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">email: :email.network &gt; :email.addr</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">phone: :person.phone</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Group: Address</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">text: :address.addr</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">End_Group</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">End_Group</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">End_Group<BR><BR></FONT><P>Example DIF line: <P><FONT FACE="Courier">Parameter: Atmospheric Composition &gt; Clouds<BR></FONT><P>Following the mapping described in the syntax dictionary, theseField IDs would get values:<P><FONT FACE="Courier">param.param_group ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">param.parameter CLOUDS</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">param.text</FONT> &lt;empty&gt;<P><B>Rules Dictionary<BR></B><P>The rules dictionary was created to provide special rules forDIF processing. While the Field ID dictionary defines actionsfor Field IDs, there are instances where actions need to be takenon the DIF field and group labels as opposed to the individualvalues. The rules dictionary defines special commands such asgetting DIF and personnel identifiers, updating a table at theend of the DIF, and putting checks on the number of times a fieldor group may be used.<BR><BR><P><B>Valid Commands<BR></B><P>The rules dictionary and functions only support three commandsat this time. These are: Appear, SQL, and Group_Insert.<BR><P><B>Appear <I>x to n</I> </B>Indicate special restrictions on theappearance of a field/group.<P>1 to 1 Required field that can be used only once<P>1 to <I>n</I> Required field that can be used <I>n</I> times<P>0 to 1 Non-required field that, if used, can only appear once<P>0 to <I>n</I> Non-required field -- can be used <I>n</I> times<P>Since this is the default field appearance, fields that are notrequired and have no appearance limit should not be defined inthis file.<BR><P><B>SQL <I>(label, ...)</I></B> Execute given SQL statement(s)upon coming across this field/group <I>during the insertion pass</I>.<P>Statement labels must appear in parentheses ( ) separated by commas.<P>Channel/cursor number is given after the labels (<FONT FACE="Courier">on#</FONT>).<BR><P><B>Group_Insert</B> Insert the information found in this groupat one time at the end of the group.<P>Default insertion occurs as fields are processed. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><P>Examples:<BR><P><FONT FACE="Courier"># Definitions in the form of:</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">#Document Type Group/Field Label Verb extras...</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">#</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Data_Set_Info field entry_id Appear 1 to1</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Data_Set_Info field parameter Appear 1 to999</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">#</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Data_Set_Info group Data_center_contact SQL(loc_id, i550) on 1</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Data_Set_Info group investigator SQL (loc_id,i500) on 1</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">#</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Data_Set_Info group data_center_contact Group_Insert</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Data_Set_Info group investigator Group_Insert<BR></FONT><P>Note: The Group_Insert command also appears in the Field ID dictionary.<P><B>Rules Dictionary (continued)<BR></B><P><B>Document Types<BR></B><P>Each type of DIF information is identified in the rules dictionaryfile. The document types are defined with SQL labels that canbe executed before and after each pass of the loader (validationand insertion). <BR><P>This method of attaching SQL labels to the passes of the DIF isnecessary because the loader assumes no order to the fields ina DIF. These SQL labels therefore could not be attached to FieldIDs in the fields dictionary or the field/group labels in therules dictionary since we do not assume a starting or ending field(even though <FONT FACE="Courier">Entry_ID</FONT> is requiredas the first field).<BR><P>Each line defining the document types contains the document type,pre-validation SQL label, post-validation label, pre-insertionlabel, post-insertion label, and the channel/cursor on which toexecutes the queries. In the example below, the post-validationcheck is to determine if there is only one document in the database.The pre-insertion SQL label gets a de_id for all the DIFs to startthe insertion pass. The post-insertion SQL label is used to updatea database table depending on the type of DIF (i.e. for a DataSet Description, the <FONT FACE="Courier">md_entry</FONT> tableneeds to be updated which is done with SQL statement <FONT FACE="Courier">i100</FONT>).<BR><P><FONT FACE="Courier"># Type SQL Labels Channel/cursor</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier"># Validation Insertion</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">#</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Data_Set_Info 0 one_dif de_id i100 0</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Data_Center_Supp_Info 0 one_center de_idi1000 0</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Project_Supp_Info 0 one_camp de_id i11000</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Source_Supp_Info 0 one_source de_id i12000</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Courier">Sensor_Supp_Info 0 one_sensor de_id i13000<BR><BR></FONT><P><B>Fields Dictionary<BR></B><P>The following Field ID commands are defined in the fields dictionary.These commands are used to operate on individual field valuesin a DIF.<BR><BR><P><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD WIDTH=108><B>Command</B></TD><TD WIDTH=288><B>Description</B></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=108><FONT FACE="Courier">Add(<I>#</I>)</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=288>Add the given number to the Field ID after use in an SQL statement</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=108><FONT FACE="Courier">Ask(<I>expression</I>)</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=288>Prompt the user for choices if the given expression is true</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=108><FONT FACE="Courier">DontClear</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=288>Do not clear the data in the Field ID</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=108><FONT FACE="Courier">Group_Insert</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=288>Place this Field ID on the internal group insert queue </TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=108><FONT FACE="Courier">Group_Validate</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=288>Place this Field ID in the internal group validate queue </TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=108><FONT FACE="Courier">NotNull</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=288>This Field ID is not allowed to be blank </TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=108><FONT FACE="Courier">OneOf(<I>list</I>)</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=288>The value in the Field ID must equal one in the list of values </TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=108><FONT FACE="Courier">StripBlanks</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=288>Remove leading and trailing blanks</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=108><FONT FACE="Courier">Upcase</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=288>Change the value in the Field ID to upper case</TD></TR></TABLE><P><BR><BR><BR><P>See the section <I>Memory Management and SQL Templates</I> inthe <I>Programmers API </I>document for more information on theFields dictionary file.<BR><P>See the function <FONT FACE="Courier">FieldCommand</FONT> in the<I>Programers API</I> document.<BR><BR><P><CENTER><B>Insert the Loader System Context Diagram here<BR><BR><BR></B></CENTER><H2><A NAME="_Toc374159010">7.5 Adding New DIF Keywords</A><BR></H2><P>The loader software was designed to allow changes to the DIF.Changes with the DIF should only require updating the loader dictionaryfiles. The dictionary files provide a mapping from the DIF syntaxto Field IDs and then to SQL statements. The loader software containsspecial validation functions for validating dates, geographiccoordinates, and the free text groups. All other validation ishandled directly through SQL statements. <BR><P>The first step is deciding what the DIF syntax will be to supportthe new field or fields. New DIF keywords must be defined beforeany work can be started on changing the database structure. <BR><P>The next step is adding additional tables (or fields to existingtables) to the database table structure. The database table creationscripts (discussed elsewhere in this document) should be updatedand used.<BR><P>After changing the database tables, the SQL statements neededto support the DIF change should be created and tested interactivelywith the database product. This process of testing the SQL statementsbefore inserting them into the SQL dictionary file will ensurethat the statements are correct and reduce the need for debugging.After the statements are working as expected, create SQL templatestatements in the SQL dictionary. SQL statements need to be createdand tested for field validation, insertion, and deletion.<BR><P>The syntax dictionary needs the mapping from the DIF labels tothe Field IDs used to hold the DIF values. The syntax dictionaryis very similar to the DIF itself. The DIF label is followed byFields IDs in the syntax dictionary just as the DIF label is followedby DIF values in the DIF file. <BR><P>The fields dictionary links the syntax definitions to the SQLstatements via Field IDs. The Field IDs are defined in the fieldsdictionary. Each Field ID is defined with the SQL labels fromthe SQL dictionary that will be executed for validation, insertion,and deletion. <BR><P>The sections describing each dictionary file have more informationabout the format of each file. The examples given on adding validationqueries will give insight on how to add queries to the SQL dictionaryand update the fields dictionary. <BR><H2><A NAME="_Toc374159011">7.6 Personnel Loader</A><BR></H2><P>DIF files can contain information about many people who are connectedwith a particular entry (e.g., principal and co-investigator,data center contact, DIF author , etc.). Since a single personcan occur in many DIFs, it was imperative that the loader systemnot duplicate the same personnel information just because it appearedin the DIF. That particular information might already have beenentered previously.<BR><P>Also, the DIF manual states that complete personnel informationneed not be repeated in every DIF for a particular person justso long as the complete information about a particular personwas included in at least one DIF. Preparers could expect directoriesto be able automatically to attach peoples names with informationalready loaded about them. When an entry is displayed to usersof the query subsystem, they should be able to see complete personnelinformation, if available, even if the DIF didn't have the completepersonnel information.<BR><P>This, of course, causes some difficulties because the only informationin the DIF might be the name of an individual. While a completename in a DIF may uniquely identify a person 80% of the time,20% of the time it may not. For example, if only John Smith appearsin a DIF, there many be one or more John Smiths on file in theMD. An operations person must determine which set of completeinformation actually pertains to any particular DIF. Any duplicateinformation must then be deleted.<BR><P>As a result, of the difficulty of this personnel reconciliationproblem, the personnel loader subsystem was created. The entryloader loads all personnel information into temporary tables withinthe database. When the loader has completed loading a DIF allthe information, but personnel information, is available to theuser of the query subsystem. Before the personnel informationbecomes available the person loader subsystem must be run by theoperations staff.<BR><P>The person loader subsystem provides the following functionalities:<BR><P>1) Load the temporary information into permanent automaticallyeliminating duplicate personnel information when this is possible.<P>2) Provide interface to allow the operations staff to reconcilepossibly conflicting personnel information by merging with existingdata or accepting the temporary data as permanent.<P>3) Delete all information from the temporary tables when reconciliationis complete.<P>4) Provide interface to resolve address, phone and email conflicts.<P>5) Update addresses directly in the database rather than requirea total DIF re-load.<P>6) Allow operations staff to view complete personnel informationoutside the context of the query subsystem.<BR><P>The person loader matches last name, first name and middle initialof the DIF data with the data already on file to ascertain whetheran individual is the same. If all of these match, it is assumedthat the same person is being entered. However, if the addressesof the matched individual are different, the person loader keepsboth sets of information and flags the action as an address reconciliationproblem. The operation's staff must then use the other componentsof the person loader subsystem to finish the personnel process.<BR><P>The person loader subsystem is curses based. To operate correctly,the terminal being used to run it must be described in the terminaldefinitions file used by the curses package on the target machine.</BODY></HTML>

The allowable values are commonly knownas &quot;valids&quot;. The valids update software provides a non-SQLinterface for maintaining the ORACLE database tables used to holdvalids information.<BR><P>The purpose of this software is to insert or delete the acceptablevalues for DIF fields which require the use of controlled lists,which are generally found on-line at the GCMD WWW site. Theselists of valids are stored in database tables, which are thenused by the loader backend to determine whether the values inany particular DIF are valid. <BR><P>The valids update software is C based. It uses curses for itsscreenhandling as a result it requires that the terminal usedbe supported in the terminal definition file used by curses.<BR><P>Most of the programs which allow direct manipulation of the databasevalids tables have been reserved for the use of the GCMD staff,and are therefore not accessible via the OPS Menu at other nodes.Instead, PERL scripts are provided (and accessed via the OPS Menu)to read HTML lists of valids directly from the GCMD WWW site andload these lists into the database at the requesting site. ThePERL scripts are found in the ~mddevel/dba/v7 directory. <BR><BR><H3><A NAME="_Toc374159015">Source and Sensor Alias Update</A><BR></H3><P>*** Source and sensor alias functionality is disabled in the MD5 software. It is expected to return in MD 6.<BR><P>The source and sensor alias update software is C based. It alsouses curses for its screenhandling and therefore requires thatthe terminal being used is supported by the definition file usedby the curses package.<BR><P>Every DIF may contain the names of sources and sensors which wereused to collect the data described by the DIF. However, not allsources and sensors have common names which are agreed upon byall users of the data. In order to ensure that a particular sourceor sensor can be queried and found with a variety of differentvariation in name, the MD maintains alias tables for both sourcesand sensors.<BR><P>The basic role of this component of the subsystem is the maintenanceof the source alias table and the sensor alias table. The softwareworks directly on the database; it does not require the directuse of the SQL interpreter.<BR><BR><H3><A NAME="_Toc374159016">Delete Utilities</A><BR></H3><P>DIF and supplementary entries (campaign/project, data center,source, and sensor) may be deleted from the directory databaseusing this utility. Supplementary entries consist of descriptionsof data center, project/campaign, source, and sensor. These entriesmay be deleted by the acronym or the <FONT FACE="Courier">Short_Name</FONT>.<P>The user may elect to delete DIFs from the directory without enteringinto the delete utility. The DIFs must first be selected intothe <FONT FACE="Courier">auto_delete </FONT>database table. <BR><BR><H2><A NAME="_Toc374159017">8.2 General Utilities</A><BR></H2><P>These utilities are used throughout the Master Directory system.They are located in the <FONT FACE="Courier">MDDISK-&gt;MDPROD-&gt;MDUTILS</FONT> directory.<BR><BR><P><B><FONT FACE="Courier">notab <BR></FONT></B><P>This utility allows the removal of a number of different charactersfrom text files. Initially, its purpose was to remove TAB characters(ASCII 9) from DIF text files. The DIF manual states that TABsare not allowed in DIFs. It was decided that no DIF should berejected because of the use of TABs; instead these charactersare just replaced with a space.<BR><P>As the logging system was activated in the MD query subsystem,it was soon noticed that the data communications sometimes insertednon-printable garbage characters into the log insert statements.The RDBMS would not process any insert statement containing thesecharacters. So, it became important to remove them also.<BR><P><FONT FACE="Courier">notab</FONT> replaces the TAB with a spaceand deletes any characters with an ASCII code of less than 32(i.e., space) or greater than 127. <BR><BR><P><B><FONT FACE="Courier">fixtty <BR></FONT></B><P>This utility is used to reset terminal attributes. On a Unix system,<FONT FACE="Courier">fixtty</FONT> is a shell script that callsthe Unix command <FONT FACE="Courier">stty</FONT> with parametersto set the terminal characteristics properly. Under VMS, <FONT FACE="Courier">fixtty.com</FONT>is a DCL command file that uses the VMS command <FONT FACE="Courier">setterm</FONT> with the appropriate parameters.<BR><BR><P><B><FONT FACE="Courier">mdsql<BR></FONT></B><P>This shell script provides a consistent mechanism to access anSQL interface. <FONT FACE="Courier">mdsql[.com]</FONT> is usedin all scripts that activate an SQL instruction file rather thanthe specific SQL access syntax. This script expects two arguments:the database name/password and a file of SQL statements to execute.<BR><P><B><FONT FACE="Courier">select_BOTH</FONT></B><P><B><FONT FACE="Courier">select_CS</FONT></B><P><B><FONT FACE="Courier">select_SA<BR></FONT></B><P>These shell scripts copy the files with the chosen trailing charactersinto files of the same name without the trailing '_CS', '_SA'or '_BOTH'. This action takes place in the $LIBS directory. Inthis fashion, one of the three versions is chosen for subsequentdistribution to the directory where the OPS Menu accessible executableis known to reside. (see transexe, below)<BR><P><B><FONT FACE="Courier">transexe<BR></FONT></B><P>This shell script is used to move recently built software fromthe LIBS directory to the proper running environments. If usedwhen logged into the production account, the software is copiedfrom the development directory as there are no source files inthe production account.<BR></BODY></HTML>

<H1>Earth Observing System (EOS) Data and Information</H1>

<P> The Earth Observing System (EOS) is the corner stone of NASA's
Mission to Planet Earth (MtPE) program and is an integral part of the
U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). NASA's Mission to Planet
Earth will use space- and ground-based measurement systems to provide
the scientific basis for understanding global change. EOS, Earth Probe,
Pathfinder, and related data products will be available at the Earth
Observing System Data Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active
Archive Centers (DAACs).

<title>Proposed NASA Budget Cuts</title>
</head>
<h1>NASA Mission To Planet Earth (MTPE) Program News</h1>
<body>
<pre>

This message was posted on the CLIMLIST bulletin board May 18, 1995
<hr>


URGENT CALL TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND GLOBAL CHANGE SCIENTISTS:
MTPE/EOS/EOSDIS THREATENED AGAIN

Republicans in Congress are seriously threatening NASA's budget for
the Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE), particularly its ground based data
system --the Earth Observing System Data and Information System
(EOSDIS). This system is already operational and distributing data to
users.  (For more information on EOS refer to <A HREF="http://eos.nasa.gov/">http://eos.nasa.gov</A>)

According to the May 15-21 issue of _Space News_, House and Senate
Republicans are proposing a 20% cut in NASA spending by the year 2000.
This follows previous cuts in EOS of 50 percent since 1992.  In
particular, House Science Committee Chairman Robert Walker (R-Pa) is
proposing to cut $2.7 billion from MTPE primarily from the ground
system designed to collect and disseminate data from Earth Observing
System (EOS) satellites.  This flies in the face of the original
concept for EOS where scientists urged NASA to focus on making
scientific data useful and readily and swiftly available, unlike in
some of its earlier space programs.  Furthermore, according to NASA's
Dixon Butler, NASA has only allocated about $1.5 billion to the EOS
data system making a $2.7 billion cut there a "mathematical
impossibility".  Clearly, Mr. Walker and some of his colleagues are
not taking a rational or scientific approach in their micromanagement
of NASA and its budget.

Meanwhile on the other side of the aisle, Rep. George Brown (D-Cal) is
proposing that Congress look at the entire NASA budget when
considering NASA cuts.  In other words, the space station should be
put on the table as well as the Mission to Planet Earth and other NASA
programs.

We urge you to contact your congressional representatives and the
budget committee chairmen immediately (see below), and urge them not
to target EOS and particularly EOSDIS with their ill-conceived cuts.
It is simply nonsensical to eliminate the data management and
distribution system for MTPE as it would make the entire program
worthless.  You may also wish to contact Mr. Brown to make known your
concerns about MTPE cuts.

Please contact the following and urge them not to eliminate EOSDIS:

<title>GCMD Version 5 Release</title>

<h1>GCMD Version 5 Release</h1>
</TD></TR></TABLE> 

<P>
<hr>
<pre>

Version 5 includes ten new fields and several revised fields; new
parameter keyword valids, as well as new and revised source, sensor,
campaign/projects, and data center valids.  MD5 offers two search
options for the Version 5 DIF: MD5-Oracle and MD5-Isite.

MD5-Oracle is the search and retrieval option based directly 
on the Oracle database.  The package contains a server, two
clients - the Classic Client and the Web Client, and
the complete internal operations functions.  A completely
refurbished operations segment offers greatly improved
capability to generate usage statistics.  

MD5-Isite is based on the _contents_ of the Oracle database;
however, the contents are extracted from the database as ASCII 
files and subsequently indexed for searching as fielded or full 
free-text with the GCMD's modified version of the Isite software.  
The Isite software was developed by the Center for Networked Information 
Discovery and Retrieval.  The package contains a server, an indexer, 
and a gateway.

Both MD5-Oracle and MD5-Isite will be also installed at the ESA
(Europe) and NASDA (Japan) Coordinating Nodes of the <A
HREF="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/ceosidn/">Committee on Earth Observing
Satellites' (CEOS) International Directory Network (IDN)</a>, as well
as at the CCRS (Canada), DLR (Germany), and CSIRO (Australia)
Cooperating Nodes.  The MD5-Isite will be installed at CNES (France),
UNEP (UNEP-GRID/Nairobi), CONAE (Argentina), JICST (Japan), and INPE.
Build and configuration requirements will be available on GCMD's newly
revised Web Site and will be distributed to all IDN nodes.



Also Announcing DIF Version 5 Authoring Tools
---------------------------------------------

Several DIF authoring tools for DIF Version 5 have been completed by the
GCMD staff.  These include:
 
DIFmacs - This tool is built on the Emacs text editor on UNIX platforms. 
DIFmacs is especially useful for those who write many DIFs.
(<A HREF="ftp://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/md_install/">ftp://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/md_install/difmacs.V5.tar.gz</a>)
 
DIFweb - an interactive WWW form that allows users to select the fields
they wish to complete, enter the information, then send the DIF to themselves
or staff (<A HREF="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/difweb">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/difweb</a>)
 
DIFwrite - a simple PC DOS based tool that is useful for authors without
internet access (<A HREF="ftp://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/DIFwrite/">ftp://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/DIFwrite/difwri_5.zip</a>). 
 
Other tools available include DIFent (from the Commission of the
European Communities) and the United Nation's Environmental
Program's Housekeeping Tool.

All of the above tools include the new fields, valids, and format.  
The GCMD staff has completed the work needed to load, extract and
display Version 5 DIFs from the database.  All Version 4 DIFs currently
held by the GCMD have been updated and reloaded in the new Version 5 
format by the GCMD staff.  For more information on the new fields, format 
and valids, please see: 
<A HREF="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/difguide/difman.html">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/difguide/difman.html</a>


*Note:  Perl scripts are available to assist in converting Version 4 DIFs
to Version 5 DIFs.  You may obtain this conversion package from the
American Coordinating Node (GCMD) anonymous ftp site:

ftp gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov 
<A HREF="ftp://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/conversion_scripts/">ftp://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/conversion_scripts/</a>
login:  anonymous
password:  your email address
cd pub/conversion_scripts/difV4_2_difV5.tar.gz

However, please be aware that _all_ DIFs in the directory have already been
converted.

<title>Remote Sensing for Marine & Coastal Envts</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Fourth International Conference<br>
Remote Sensing for Marine and Coastal Environments</h1>

<h2>Orlando, Florida<br>
March 17-19, 1997</h2>

The Fourth International Conference on Remote Sensing for Marine and
Coastal Environments is organized by <a
href="http://www.erim.org/">ERIM</a>. 
<p>

This conference focuses on applying remote sensing technologies to solve
real-world problems in marine and coastal environments.  The conference
will encompass all aspects of remote sensing of the marine environment,
including fundamental principles of sensor evaluation, data
interpretation, algorithm validation, advanced processing techniques, and
data integration using GIS.
<p>

The following sessions are planned:
<ul>
<li>Oil Spills & Marine Pollution
<li>Florida Ecosystems
<li>Currents, Waves & Nearshore Processes
<li>Air-Sea Interaction & Sea Ice
<li>New Sensors & Information Systems
<li>Living Resources
<li>Optics & Models
<li>Hyperspectral Sensors & Applications
<li>Charting & Mapping
</ul>

GCMD staff will be presenting an interactive poster in the session on New
Sensors & Information Systems.  The title of the poster is "Combining
Controlled-Vocabulary and Free-Text Search Options in Order to Enhance the
Retrieval of Directory-Level Metadata for the Discovery of Environmental
Data".
<p>

More information about the <a
href="http://www.erim.org/CONF/marine/4th_marine/4th_marine.html"> Remote
Sensing for Marine and Coastal Environments Conference</a> is available
from ERIM.

Ultraviolet Level Information Available at NCDC    9/26/94

An experimental program designed to provide the public with an
important new addition to the daily weather forecast-prediction
of solar ultraviolet radiation levels-has debuted in 58 cities
throughout the United States.

Joint NOAA-EPA Program
----------------------

The program, announced jointly by NOAA and the Environmental
Protection Agency, will offer citizens a look at the next day's
level of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, helping them guard against
overexposure.  Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation has
been associated with an increased incidence of skin cancer and
cataracts.  It is known to inhibit the immune system.  EPA's
Office of Research and Development initiated the program in 1992
when it approached the National Weather Service to start a
program following the success of a similar service in Canada.

"With the UV Index forecast, the public should be better informed
to take simple actions to reduce overexposure to UV radiation,"
said EPA assistant administrator Mary Nichols.  "Because
scientists have estimated that people receive about 80 percent of
their lifetime exposure to the sun by the age of 18, we think
this is particularly important information for children and their
parents."

Dollar Savings Potential
------------------------

Since Medicare's biggest 1993 line item was for 1.2 million
cataract operations, protection against ultraviolet rays-a
leading cause of the eye disease-has the potential to save health
care dollars.

As the weather service continues to refine the science behind the
daily UV forecasts, it will distribute them to 58 cities during
the experiment.  EPA will work with the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and a coalition of health, medical and
environmental groups to provide information to the public about
the UV Index and risks of overexposure to UV radiation.

NWS meteorologists began issuing the experimental forecasts for
the 58 cities this month.  During the course of the experiment,
NOAA and EPA will work with the private sector in a partnership
to evaluate the level of service provided by an ultraviolet index
and develop plans for the future of this service.

Stratospheric Ozone Changes Measured
------------------------------------

The ultraviolet forecasts will account for observed and predicted
changes in stratospheric ozone data for all 58 cities and include
the effects of computer-generated cloudiness for 56 of them.
Clouds generally decrease the amount of ultraviolet radiation
reaching the earth's surface.

Forecasts for Honolulu and San Juan, Puerto Rico, will not
include the effects of cloudiness because the computer-generated
cloud forecasts are not yet available for these locations.

Forecasts will be centrally issued by the weather service's
National Meteorological Center in Camp Springs, Md., and sent to
forecast offices around the country.  Meteorologists at local
forecast offices will voice the daily index over the NOAA Weather
Radio network; forecasts will also be distributed to public and
private meteorologists over the NOAA Weather Wire Service and
other weather service information dissemination channels.  The
NCDC will ingest the UVI in near real-time for retrospective
analyses and for its customers.

The daily forecast value in the ultraviolet index will be
for approximately 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. Daylight Savings Time in
each U.S. time zone.  The index is on a scale from 0 to 10, or
higher in some areas, with corresponding exposure levels ranging
from minimal to very high.

Effects on Eyes and Skin
------------------------

The daily index, along with educational materials provided by
EPA, will help people make informed personal decisions about the
effects of UV rays on their eyes and skin.

Various private companies may produce similar forecasts that
have different numerical values, but retain the same action
messages and descriptions of exposure.


The NOAA/EPA Experimental Ultraviolet Index (UVI) Forecast
is now available in the anonymous ftp area on workstation
hurricane. The forecast is automatically ingested and should be
available for downloading at approximately 3:00PM daily.

TOPEX/POSEIDON BUILDS CRITICAL DATA BASE ON CLIMATE CHANGE

     Scientists, using data from the U.S.-French oceanography
satellite TOPEX/Poseidon, say they appear to have detected a rise in
the average global sea level over the past two years.  If scientists
detect a global, long-term rise in sea level, they will be able to
test theories about the effects of climate change.

     "A rise in global mean sea level is an important indicator of
global change, because it can be caused by thermal expansion of the
oceans and melting of glaciers and the polar ice caps," said Dr. R.
Steven Nerem of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD.
"Therefore, if a long-term rise in global mean sea level were
detected, this would provide further evidence to support the global
warming predicted by some climate models due to an increase in the
'greenhouse' gases."

     This and several other findings were announced today at the
American Geophysical Union's fall meeting in San Francisco.  Other
topics at the meeting related to TOPEX/Poseidon include an experiment
to study phenomena that can disrupt offshore drilling and the study of
deep-ocean tides.

     The insights from TOPEX/Poseidon add to data collected from
tide gauges over the last century which suggest that average sea level
has been rising at a rate of about .04 to .08 inches (1 to 2
millimeters) per year, roughly equivalent to the rate expected from
global warming, Nerem said.  "The data (from Dec. 1992 to Sept. 1994)
show a rise in average sea level of about .12 inches (3 millimeters)
per year, which is in reasonable agreement with the tide gauge
results," Nerem explained.   However, tide gauge measurements can
be affected by the movement of land masses and are too sparsely
distributed to provide global coverage.

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://topex-www.jpl.nasa.gov"> TOPEX/Poseidon Data and Information at JPL Home Page</A>
</UL>

     TOPEX/Poseidon was launched on Aug. 10, 1992, to study how
long-term ocean circulation affects climate change.  The satellite
measures the sea-surface height along a groundtrack that repeats once
every 10 days.  The satellite also measures absolute sea level
relative to the center-of-mass of the Earth.  The measurement data is
unaffected by land movements.

     Nerem cautioned that the results are preliminary and could
change as a longer time series is collected and as the measurement
errors are better understood.

     "It should also be noted that since the sea level rise is
only measured over two years, it could represent a short-term
variation unrelated to the long-term signal expected from global
warming.  Nevertheless, TOPEX/Poseidon appears to be providing
corroborating evidence that global sea level is indeed rising," Nerem
said.

     TOPEX/Poseidon data are helping scientists and a U.S. oil
company in the Gulf of Mexico study potentially dangerous ocean
phenomena that can disrupt offshore oil drilling.

     "Oil industry operations in deep water can be adversely
affected by high ocean currents," said Dr. George Born of the
University of Colorado's Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research
(CCAR).  "In the Gulf, eddies spun off from the Loop Current have
caused serious operational problems, including delays of several
weeks, lost and damaged equipment and millions of dollars
in unproductive expense."

     The Loop Current is a strong ocean current that circulates
around the Gulf. Roughly once a year, a large eddy is spun off from
the Loop Current and moves west through the Gulf.

     "An eddy can be thought of as a hurricane in the water," Born
said.  "The Gulf of Mexico has some of the largest eddies in the
world, ranging up to 180 to 250 miles (300 to 400 kilometers) in
diameter."

     In late summer 1994, a large eddy, called Eddy Yucatan, broke
off from the Loop Current.  Oceanographers from Texaco, Inc. used
TOPEX/Poseidon data to augment their drifting buoy data and track this
eddy.  As of late October, Eddy Yucatan  was located approximately 93
miles (150 kilometers) southeast of the Texaco drilling site where it
appeared to be moving away from the site.

     "However, the predictive models available for the Gulf are
still under development and it is impossible to predict the future
path of the eddy with great certainty," Born said.  "Work is currently
underway at CCAR to use TOPEX/Poseidon data to produce a more reliable
forecast.  This work ultimately will benefit not only offshore oil
drilling, but many oceanographic activities in the Gulf of Mexico."

     In another application, the precision of the TOPEX/Poseidon ocean
measurements has enabled scientists to calculate global tides across
all the open oceans, an important step toward monitoring global ocean
circulation from space and understanding the complexities of global
climate change.

     "Using the first year of data we can now predict deep ocean
tides everywhere over the areas covered by the satellite with an
accuracy of 0.8 to 1.1 inches (2 to 3 centimeters)," said Dr.
Christian Le Provost, of  the Institut de Mecanique de Grenoble in
France.

     "We need to precisely understand deep ocean tides so that we
can remove their influence from the ocean circulation data," said Dr.
Lee-Lueng Fu, the TOPEX/Poseidon project scientist at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA.  "It is ocean circulation that is
the key to understanding global warming and global climate change."

     Precise knowledge of global ocean tides helps scientists
better understand how pollutants are dispersed by tidal currents.  The
knowledge also will have applications to shipping, oil drilling and
exploration, and fishery development.

     TOPEX/Poseidon is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, a
coordinated, long-term research program to study the Earth as a single
global environment. TOPEX/Poseidon's sea-surface height data are
essential to understanding the role oceans play in regulating global
climate, one of the least understood areas of climate research.  The
Jet Propulsion Laboratory manages the TOPEX/Poseidon mission for NASA.

NASA'S UARS CONFIRMS CFCs CAUSED ANTARCTIC OZONE HOLE

Three years of data from NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite
(UARS) have provided conclusive evidence that human-made chlorine in
the stratosphere is the cause of the Antarctic ozone hole.

UARS instruments have found chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)--human-made
products used in electronics and refrigeration systems--in the
stratosphere.  The satellite's global data set also has traced
worldwide buildup of stratospheric fluorine gases corresponding to the
breakdown of CFCs, according to NASA scientists.

For many years, scientists have warned that the widespread use of
chlorofluorocarbons in refrigeration, spray cans and foam packaging
was responsible for stratospheric ozone loss.  The stratospheric ozone
layer protects people, animals and plants from too much ultraviolet
sunlight.  The Antarctic ozone hole is a dramatic example of
stratospheric ozone loss, which most scientists believe is a new
phenomenon caused by the release of chlorine from human-made
chlorofluorocarbons.

In the past few years, some debate has occurred over the origin of
ozone-destroying chlorine.  Sea spray and volcanic gases have been put
forth as possible sources for chlorine reaching the stratosphere.  The
UARS data have ended that debate.

"These new results confirm our theories about CFCs," said Dr. Mark
Schoeberl, UARS Project Scientist.  "The detection of stratospheric
fluorine gases, which are not natural, eliminates the possibility that
chlorine from volcanic eruptions or some other natural source is
responsible for the ozone hole."  In addition to CFCs, UARS has
detected hydrogen fluoride, a product of the chemical breakdown of
CFCs, in the stratosphere.

"Hydrogen fluoride has no natural source, it is not produced by
volcanic eruptions or salt spray," said Dr.  Anne Douglass, UARS
Deputy Project Scientist.  "Furthermore, scientists can calculate how
much chlorine in the stratosphere is man-made using the hydrogen
fluoride data."  This calculation shows that almost all of the
chlorine in the stratosphere comes from human-made
chlorofluorocarbons.

The UARS measurements of chlorofluorocarbons were made with the
Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer, operated by Dr. Aiden Roche
of Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory.  The hydrogen fluoride
measurements were made with the Halogen Occultation Experiment,
operated by Dr.  James Russell of NASA's Langley Research Center,
Hampton, VA.

Each year since 1979, the ozone layer thins dramatically over
Antarctica.  This sudden change in the ozone was first noticed by
researchers in Antarctica and soon confirmed by NASA satellites.  The
unpredicted Antarctic ozone loss gave scientists a challenging puzzle.
Aircraft observations in 1987 showed convincingly that the high
concentrations of chlorine monoxide over Antarctica were destroying
ozone in the lower stratosphere.  Most scientists were convinced that
a series of chemical reactions involving chlorine monoxide and ozone
led to the formation of the ozone hole.

Two questions, however, remained: why was the change in the ozone
layer taking place over Antarctica, and what was the source of the
chlorine monoxide?  Meteorologists long have known that the Antarctic
stratosphere can be one of the coldest places on the planet.  Air is
so cold that wispy clouds can form even in the super-dry stratospheric
air.  These clouds, called polar stratospheric clouds, form in the
dead of winter.  Scientists believe that chemical reactions on the
surface of the cloud crystals release chlorine from "reservoir" gases,
which do not react with ozone.  The chlorine reacts quickly with ozone
to form chlorine monoxide.  This reaction begins the catalytic cycle
in which one chlorine atom can ultimately destroy many ozone
molecules, leading to the polar ozone hole.

UARS has measured the winter build up of chlorine monoxide within the
south and north polar regions every year since its launch.  UARS has
found that chlorine monoxide appears suddenly in the stratosphere
after the formation of the polar stratospheric clouds.  Infrared and
microwave sensors on board UARS are able to track stratospheric clouds
and the chemical changes they cause.

UARS measurements have confirmed that the chlorine monoxide can build
up to extreme levels in the polar regions after polar stratospheric
clouds appear.  UARS data also have shown that the meteorology of the
polar stratosphere prevents the chlorine monoxide from dispersing,
thus increasing the ozone loss.

"We are getting daily polar maps of ozone-destroying chemicals," said
Douglass.  "These measurements are adding tremendously to our
knowledge of the stratosphere."

The UARS data set also has provided a clearer picture of the overall
chemistry of the stratosphere.  UARS instruments have tracked the
levels of chlorine "source" gases (CFCs), intermediate products
(chlorine monoxide) and reservoir gases (hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen
chloride and chlorine nitrate).

Under international treaties controlling the use of ozone-depleting
chemicals, the amounts of CFCs in the atmosphere no longer are
increasing.  However, CFCs survive in the atmosphere for many years
before being destroyed by ultraviolet light, and the ozone hole is
expected to persist at current levels through this decade.  (Their
stability was one of their biggest assets when they were developed for
industrial use in the 1930s.)  Unless other conditions change,
scientists expect the ozone hole to weaken and disappear in the 21st
century.

UARS was the first satellite launched as part of NASA's Mission to
Planet Earth, a comprehensive study of how the Earth's global
environment changes, and how human activities contribute to that
change.  Mission to Planet Earth includes satellites, Space Shuttle
instruments, aircraft research and ground teams.  Goddard Space Flight
Center, Greenbelt, MD, manages UARS for NASA's Office of Mission to
Planet Earth, Washington, DC.

the Clouds," describing the UARS mission, are available from NASA's

<TITLE>EUROPE CLIMATE ASSESSMENT</TITLE>

<body>
<H1>Latest Press Release on the First European Climate Assessment from
the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI)</H1>
<pre>

This message was posted on the CLIMLIST Bulletin Board Friday March 24, 1995
<hr>
<P>
KNMI Press Release  ---  number WO 95/06E  ---  date 23 March 1995

                 First European Climate Assessment:
           most of Europe shows a rising in temperatures,
      but cooling in Eastern Mediterranean and North Atlantic

During the present century almost all stations across Europe have
indicated a warming. Observations of precipitation show an increase
over most of northern Europe and a decrease or unchanged situation
over Southern Europe.  Sunshine duration, all over Europe, shows
irregular changes but no systematic trend.

These are the most important conclusions of the First European Climate
Assessment, initiated by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological
Institute (KNMI) at De Bilt. Being a co-production of the members of
the European Climate Support Network (ECSN), this first European
Climate Assessment focusses on Western Europe. Its purpose is a
discussion of the present climate of Europe and its recent past in the
perspective of predicted changes due to the increasing greenhouse
effect of the atmosphere.

Objective analysis of the available observations shows the following:

*  Most European stations show a rising in temperature. For the decade
   1981-1990, as compared to 1951-1980, the warming was of the order of
   0,25-0,50oC, but cooling was observed over the eastern Mediterranean and
   over a large area of the North Atlantic, including Greenland.

*  Observations of precipitation show an increase over most of northern
   Europe and a decrease or unchanged situation over southern Europe.
   Changes are of the order of 20% plus or minus.

*  Sunshine duration, like temperature and precipitation, shows irregular
   changes, but no systematic trend. However, for the stations considered a
   tendency towards increasing cloudiness is observed. This remarkable
   change can be explained by the increase of nocturnal cloudiness and
   cirriform clouds, which allow transmission of solar radiation.

*  The occurrence of climate extremes like droughts, heat waves, storms and
   heavy precipitation has certainly not been restricted to recent years.
   Because of the rareness of such events and the limited extent of the
   observational records no attempt was made to derive systematic time
   changes. Available data however show that the frequency of occurence of
   certain extremes is independent of the average climate conditions at a
   particular station during the present century.

Compared to the predicted changes due to the enhanced greenhouse
effect, some of the observed changes are in line with the predicted
pattern while others are not. In the assessment this is shown in a
special table, summarising at the same time some of the results of
European climate models. It should be stressed however that these
European climate predictions do not take into consideration the
cooling effects of atmospheric aerosols.

Basically the first European Climate Assessment, that at the beginning
of April will be presented to the delegations at the first Conference
of the Parties of the UN Climate Convention in Berlin, should be
considered as a reference, rather than a document on the detection of
the greenhouse effect in the climate of Europe. Observationally, as
well as theoretically, we may conclude that at this stage the climate
change of Europe is still mostly affected by natural variability. On
the other hand we know that the limited support for the predicted
changes we get from observations at the present stage does not mean
that these predictions for the next century are wrong or not
reliable. In this sense the first European Climate Assessment may
constitute a starting point, for in the next 25 years the climate of
Europe may indeed show clear signals of change exceeding the limits of
natural variablity.

The European Climate Support Network (ECSN) is a joint venture of
National Meteorological Services (NMSs) of Europe to promote greater
collaboration in climate data collection, data processing, modelling,
exchange of personnel and the united development of
recommendations. This follows the signature, in December 1992, of a
Memorandum of Understanding and the agreement of a programme of
Collaborative Scientific and Technical projects.

The sixteen National Meteorological Services which are the signatorics
of the MoU are those of: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,
Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom. Also, the NMSs of
Germany and Italy have the status of regular observers in ECSN.

A Board of Directors, a Scientific and Technical Advisory Group and a
Secretariat are the ECSN governing bodies. The Secretariat is located
in Madrid.

For the publication of the first European Climate Assessment financial
support was received from the ENRICH Office of the EU in Brussels.

NASA STUDY HELPS ANSWER KEY CLIMATE QUESTION

Evidence that clouds absorb more solar radiation than previously
believed should improve researchers' ability to predict climate
change, according to NASA scientists.

The work resulted from simultaneous flights of NASA's ER-2 and DC-8
aircraft above and below cloud decks.  By using identical instruments
on the aircraft, scientists were able to measure solar radiation as it
reached the clouds and after the clouds had scattered it.

The team found conclusive evidence that existing computer models
significantly underestimate the amount of solar energy absorbed by
clouds.  Theoretical estimates of cloud solar absorption are
substantially smaller than what actual measurements show.  "This
finding directly impacts our understanding of present climate and,
therefore, our ability to predict future climate," said atmospheric
physicist Peter Pilewskie of NASA's Ames Research Center, Mountain
View, CA.

"Existing global climate models are unreliable when it comes to
predictive capability," said Pilewskie.  "One of the primary reasons
is that the amount of solar energy absorbed and scattered by clouds, a
key determining variable in such models, is very poorly understood."

For almost 40 years, atmospheric physicists have tried to estimate
solar absorption by clouds.  Several studies have suggested that
clouds absorb more radiation than prevailing models have indicated.

"Now, for the first time, NASA's research aircraft have provided
consistent evidence that clearly supports this contention," Pilewskie
concluded.

The cloud-absorption study embodies the ultimate goal of NASA's
Mission to Planet Earth: to increase our knowledge of how large-scale
phenomena such as cloud cover and solar energy influence the Earth's
global environment.  One of the least understood areas of climate
change is the role clouds play.  This study represents one piece of a
very large puzzle that Mission to Planet Earth will address over the
next 20 years.

Previous attempts at direct measurement of solar absorption have been
hampered by an inadequate number of aircraft or a lack of identical
instruments to make consistent measurements.  In this study, a NASA
ER-2 flew at approximately 12 miles altitude.  Simultaneously, a NASA
DC-8 aircraft or a Learjet flew at altitudes between approximately
five to seven miles.  Each aircraft carried identical instruments for
simultaneous measurement of solar radiation at both flight levels.

Estimates developed by Pilewskie and Francisco Valero of the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography, San Diego, CA, using the improved data
sets showed a considerable variance with the predictions of
theoretical models.  Their findings were consistent with other recent
studies and, for the first time, demonstrated that measured cloud
absorption consistently exceeds theoretical estimates.

The reason for this high absorption is unclear, and scientists say
further study is required.  While several factors are being
considered, there are hints that it may be due to the structure and
dimensions of clouds.  The study was funded by NASA's Office of
Mission to Planet Earth.

<TITLE>GCMD Z39.50 Help and Examples</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1><img src="/Images/gcmdlogo_new.gif">Global Change Master Directory</H1>
<H2>Z39.50 Query Help and Examples</H2>

<A NAME=intro><H3><IMG SRC="blu_bullet.gif" alt="[graphic]">Overview</H3></A>

This interface provides access to a Z39.50 gateway to the contents of
NASA's <A HREF="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Global Change Master
Directory</A> (GCMD), a collection of descriptions of datasets relevant
to global change research.  The gateway is implemented using a
customized version of Isite, a suite of Z39.50 tools written by the
programming staff of <A HREF="http://cnidr.org/">Clearinghouse for
Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval</A> (CNIDR), and intended
to serve as the eventual replacement for freeWAIS. <P>

The use of a Z39.50-based query system for the GCMD is fundamental to
the development of a robust information system for locating resources
for global change research.  It will allow the GCMD to provide
information in GILS- and FGDC-compliant forms, to permit users to
specify the particular format of result sets, and to build a fully
distributed database system. <P>

The basic materials for the GCMD are dataset descriptions in a
structured format called Directory Interchange Format (DIF).  The DIFs
have been extracted from the underlying GCMD database and placed in text
file.  The text files contain multiple DIFs in "raw" DIF format, so that
fields are labelled in a standardized way, and can be easily parsed. <P>

The DIFs have been indexed using Iindex, the text indexing component of
Isite.  This version of Iindex has been modified to handle geographic
and fielded searching by Jim Fullton of CNIDR.  These modifications will
eventually be incorporated into the general distribution of Isite. <P>

A separate program parses the DIFs to find the locations of particular
fields within the DIFs, to enable searches to be restricted in scope -
<I>e.g.</I> to search for terms only in the title or summary fields, or
to perform geographic searches. <P>

Users submit queries to the database through the use of a World Wide Web
(WWW) client, like Netscape, which passes the relevant information back
to the WWW server on the host machine.  That information is passed from
the WWW server to the WWW/Z39.50 gateway, zclient, the Z39.50 client
program in Isite.  Zclient builds and passes a Z39.50 query to zserver,
the Z39.50 server program in Isite.  Zserver calls the Isite search
engine to actually perform the search and to provide the results.  The
results of the query are then passed back to zclient, which formats them
into HTML and sends them on to the user. <P>

<IMG SRC="bar.gif">
<A NAME=text><H3><IMG SRC="blu_bullet.gif" alt="[graphic]">Text Searches</H3></A>

The search query is made up of textual terms that you want to search 
for in the collection of DIFs.  Enter the search query terms in the
text box.  The search is not case sensitive.<P>

<UL>
<LI>Examples:
<UL compact>
<li>Pathfinder
<li>temperature
<li>astronomy
</UL>
</UL>

Multiple words can be searched for individually (<I>i.e.,</I> as a list
of words), or as a phrase.  Use the selection buttons labelled "Word
List" or "Phrase" to indicate your preference.  Phrase searching will
only match the exact sequence of words specified.  The results are
combined using standard information retrieval scoring techniques.<P>

<UL>
<LI> Examples:
<UL compact>
<LI>sea ice
<LI>atmospheric models
<li>wind speed
</UL>
</UL>

To search for words/phrases that begin with a sequence of characters,
but end with any sequence of characters ("right truncation"), just
append a "*" to the desired sequence (not implemented yet).

<p>

<UL>
<LI> Examples:
<UL compact>
<li>cloud* 
</ul>
</ul>
 <P>

The example below shows how to specify a search in the DIF titles on the
phrase <B>sea ice</B>.  DIFs with the words "sea" and "ice" in the
title, but not adjacent to each other will not match, nor will DIFs with
the phrase "sea ice" in the text of the DIF, but not in the title field.

<A NAME=geographic><H3><IMG SRC="blk_bullet.gif" alt="[graphic]">Geographic Searches - Not Implemented Yet</H3></A>

By default, searches are global.  That is, DIFs which match the text
query are presented without regard to the stated geographic coverages.
You can restrict the search to particular geographic regions by entering
values for the four boundary fields - <I>Northernmost Latitude</I>,
<I>Southernmost Latitude</I>, <I>Easternmost Longitude</I> and
<I>Westernmost Longitude</I>.  Latitudes should be entered in degrees,
from +90 to -90, and longitudes should be entered in degrees from 180E to
180W. <P>

In the example below, the search has been restricted to the region
between 60 and 75 degrees N latitude, and between 60 and 90 degrees
west longitude. <P>

Once a geographic region has been defined, there are three ways in which
a match can be defined.  You can require that the match be contained
entirely within the specified region, or that the match be entirely
excluded from the specified region, or you can allow any match which
overlaps the specified region. <P>

The example below only matches DIFs which are completely contained
within the region specified above. <P>

There are two ways to combine the text and geographic searches.  You can
require that both conditions be met (Boolean <I>and</I> - the text must
match, and the geographic coverage must match), or that matching one or
the other (text or geographic coverage) is suffient (Boolean
<I>or</I>).<P>

The example below will only yield matches if the text is found, and if
the geographic coverage of the DIF matches the specified region. <P>

You can limit the number of matching documents to some pre-assigned

but it will take longer for the results to be presented and

The example below limits the search to returning no more than 10

The GCMD Z39.50 gateway supports a limited Boolean search capability.
Two word lists or phrases can be combined with a Boolean operator (AND,
OR, ANDNOT).  Each list or phrase can be applied to the entire text of
the DIFs, or can be limited to the title or summary field.  There is a
separate <A HREF="zsearch-bool.html">Boolean search page</A>.  A full
Z39.50 client (like Willow) will permit more than two fields to be

<H2>Z39.50 Query Help and Examples</H2>

<A NAME=intro><H3><IMG SRC="blu_bullet.gif" alt="[graphic]">Overview</H3></A>

This interface provides access to a Z39.50 gateway to the contents of
NASA's <A HREF="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Global Change Master
Directory</A> (GCMD), a collection of descriptions of datasets relevant
to global change research.  The gateway is implemented using a
customized version of Isite, a suite of Z39.50 tools written by the
programming staff of <A HREF="http://cnidr.org/">Clearinghouse for
Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval</A> (CNIDR), and intended
to serve as the eventual replacement for freeWAIS. <P>

The use of a Z39.50-based query system for the GCMD is fundamental to
the development of a robust information system for locating resources
for global change research.  It will allow the GCMD to provide
information in GILS- and FGDC-compliant forms, to permit users to
specify the particular format of result sets, and to build a fully
distributed database system. <P>

The basic materials for the GCMD are dataset descriptions in a
structured format called Directory Interchange Format (DIF).  The DIFs
have been extracted from the underlying GCMD database and placed in text
file.  The text files contain multiple DIFs in "raw" DIF format, so that
fields are labelled in a standardized way, and can be easily parsed. <P>

The DIFs have been indexed using Iindex, the text indexing component of
Isite.  This version of Iindex has been modified to handle geographic
and fielded searching by Jim Fullton of CNIDR.  These modifications will
eventually be incorporated into the general distribution of Isite. <P>

A separate program parses the DIFs to find the locations of particular
fields within the DIFs, to enable searches to be restricted in scope -
<I>e.g.</I> to search for terms only in the title or summary fields, or
to perform geographic searches. <P>

Users submit queries to the database through the use of a World Wide Web
(WWW) client, like Netscape, which passes the relevant information back
to the WWW server on the host machine.  That information is passed from
the WWW server to the WWW/Z39.50 gateway, zclient, the Z39.50 client
program in Isite.  Zclient builds and passes a Z39.50 query to zserver,
the Z39.50 server program in Isite.  Zserver calls the Isite search
engine to actually perform the search and to provide the results.  The
results of the query are then passed back to zclient, which formats them
into HTML and sends them on to the user. <P>

<IMG SRC="bar.gif">
<A NAME=text><H3><IMG SRC="blu_bullet.gif" alt="[graphic]">Text Searches</H3></A>

The search query is made up of textual terms that you want to search 
for in the collection of DIFs.  Enter the search query terms in the
text box.  The search is not case sensitive.<P>

<UL>
<LI>Examples:
<UL compact>
<li>Pathfinder
<li>temperature
<li>astronomy
</UL>
</UL>

Multiple words can be searched for individually (<I>i.e.,</I> as a list
of words), or as a phrase.  Use the selection buttons labelled "Word
List" or "Phrase" to indicate your preference.  Phrase searching will
only match the exact sequence of words specified.  The results are
combined using standard information retrieval scoring techniques.<P>

<UL>
<LI> Examples:
<UL compact>
<LI>sea ice
<LI>atmospheric models
<li>wind speed
</UL>
</UL>

To search for words/phrases that begin with a sequence of characters,
but end with any sequence of characters ("right truncation"), just
append a "*" to the desired sequence (not implemented yet).

<p>

<UL>
<LI> Examples:
<UL compact>
<li>cloud* 
</ul>
</ul>
 <P>

The example below shows how to specify a search in the DIF titles on the
phrase <B>sea ice</B>.  DIFs with the words "sea" and "ice" in the
title, but not adjacent to each other will not match, nor will DIFs with
the phrase "sea ice" in the text of the DIF, but not in the title field.
